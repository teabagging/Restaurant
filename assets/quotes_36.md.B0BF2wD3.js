He recognized that we had a hard time understanding the menu but he really didn't go out of his way to make recomendations or engage us to figure out what we wanted to eat (I think it's because he was too busy). We just kinda pointed to an item and chose. The food was good but not the best I've had. Deserts however were awesome!

Based on many nice reviews, my three friends and I decided to check it out on a nice spring New England weekend. On the way, we thoroughly enjoyed the scenic drive through beautiful Lexington and gorgeous houses and found the restaurant nestled in the center of the town. I found Lexington town center to be very cozy, warm, and charming. I believe the restaurant has its own private parking lot, but there were ample street parking available so it was very convenient to park.\\n\\nThe cute signage outside and the small entrance are bit deceiving as to the size of the place as it's much bigger than I had anticipated. When we walked in, I was immediately impressed by the new d√©cor, cleanliness, and openness. We were seated promptly after staff asked what type of dining we are planning. I was under the impression from reading Yelp review that this place only served all you can eat BBQ, but there are other options such as sushi, normal order service, and hibachi. We went for all you can eat BBQ.\\n\\nEverything in the restaurant is brand new and each BBQ tables have open gas grill and fan that sucks the smoke out from the side so the tables don't get hot or smoky. Very smart and nice equipment! We were pleasantly surprised that all you can eat BBQ also comes with all you can eat stews, appetizers, side dishes, and veg. While I wasn't drinking, my friends were impressed with the full bar and the beer options.\\n\\nWe ordered so many items, ate, and then ordered more. They didn't rush us at all and even changed the grill few times without us asking to. We were there for a while not because the service was slow, but we enjoyed being there - talking and eating. Food was delicious and we definitely got our money's worth. =) It was a busy Saturday dinner shift, but the staff were friendly and service was good. We made sure to give a nice tip for taking good care of us. \\n\\nWe'll surely go back and as good as all you can eat BBQ was, next time I will check out sashimi.

I'd guess lunch is where they make their money, because it appeared half of downtown came with me on my quest to quell a chili craving.

Not really sure. \\n\\nAnyway, on to the food. The chili, under the romantic mood lighting of neon beer signs, looked surprisingly dark. Like, dark enough that somebody's Mexican grandma might mistakenly think TCP stole her famous Mole recipe and has started passing the stuff off as \\"Real Texas Chili\\". Oddly enough, it kind of had a mole consistency too--thick, slightly bitter, and a little gritty. As they say, if it walks like a duck and talks like a duck, well... \\n\\nAs you've probably gathered by now I wasn't super impressed by my meal. At least they made sure no beans were sacrificed for the making of this chili, as no self respecting Texan would. Other highlights?

I was on the look out for the place I had seen one night coming home from the Shameful, that had $10.95 pitchers of Sapporo. Couldn't find it so we opted for Ogenki as it had a $6.50 lunch special, and figured we may as well give it a whirl.  I had the spicy tuna roll and some agadashi tofu. My fella had beef teriyaki and a dynamite roll. He also had a Kentucky roll which seemed like a California roll, but instead of crab, it had fried chicken, which he loves, so he figured he'd try it. I believe that was an additional $8.95. \\n\\nOverall, bleh. I wouldn't go back. The tuna didn't seem fresh in the roll, and the sauce for the tofu lacked flavour.  The teriyaki was apparently fine, as was the dynamite roll but the Kentucky roll was not too good at all. I'd say the food was definitely below average. The service was Ok, not great. It took ages to get my tofu, and his Kentucky roll. \\n\\nOn a side note, the atmosphere really sucked, though this was not the fault of the restaurant.

Other patrons should not be disturbed while they are eating because of a temper tantrum. \\n\\nFor the record, my low score is not because of the screaming kid.

I was hesitant to order much because I wasn't sure a chain restaurant could offer the authentic tacos I was looking for so I just got the 2-fish taco combo that came with beans and rice.  My brother ordered the seasoned pork, carne asada, and fish tacos individually.  Right off the bat, I noticed that they had switched out the traditional cabbage slaw for regular iceberg lettuce that was soggy.  The fish was fried but the oil must have not been changed in awhile so it had a burnt look to it, but it wasn't actually over-fried.  Beans and rice is beans and rice but it didn't do much to improve my disappointment in the fish tacos which I'm still craving.  However, Muchas Gracias' redemption came in the form of the carne asada taco that had lots of flavor and matched perfectly to the [2] corn tortillas they were served on.  Not sure if I'll be back anytime soon, but will definitely choose this over Taco Bell because it does taste more authentic and they do have so many locations that it's easy to just stop in."},{"name":"McDonald's","address":"346 Great Rd","city":"Bedford","stars":"3","text":"It's McDonalds.

Both pizza's are excellent, but they are different. \\n\\nYou can purchase pizza's by the slice, individual 12\\", or large sized. My recommendation is to order the individual or large size, the reason being, is that the individual slices can come out a little soggy from time to time.

Don't get me wrong, the taste is still fantastic. The individual and large pizzas are cooked to order and I've yet to have any sort of complaint. If you are frequently in Pine Street Market, it's worth trying the different types since many have unique tastes despite looking similar. \\n\\nAnother point worth noting is the quality of ingredients at Trifecta Annex is fantastic.

I have celiac disease and ordered from them because they choose to specify on their menu what is vegan and gluten free. I ordered off of grub hub, in which the Gobi 65 cauliflower fritters said gluten free right next to it. Trusting the restaurant who chooses to specifically specify what is gluten free on their menu, I didn't think there would be an issue. Proceeding my meal, After some intuition and stomach pains, I decided to look at the actual website, which does not specify that the Gobi 65 is gluten free. I confirmed this by calling and speaking with them today as they told me that they use a mixture of wheat and chickpea flour. Now I look forward to a week of being very ill because of the laziness and lack of education pertaining to a very serious autoimmune disorder which is activated by gluten ingestion. What baffles me is why a restaurant would take the time to specify gluten free and vegan options but not follow through carefully to make sure these specifications are correct. For people with celiac disease, Gluten free is not a lifestyle choice like being vegan is, it is a necessary dietary restriction that needs to be taken seriously by restaurants who choose to participate in the gluten free label. So if you have celiac disease, a gluten allergy, or any other type of food intolerance or allergy I would suggest NOT eating here as they clearly do not take this seriously."},{"name":"gusto!","address":"782 Ponce De Leon Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"I can always count on gusto! to provide me with some healthy, affordable, and filling foods.

Sorry!\\"  That seemed a bit funny, actually (trying to \\"figure it out\\"?) but I was starving by that time and was hoping she might offer to bring me a little something to snack on while I waited.  She didn't offer, so I asked for some of the soup my friend had.  She left to get that, and then I waited.  And waited.  And WAITED some more.  My friend's soup was clearly getting cold, so I told her to go ahead and start eating.  Just when I was about to start eating my napkin, she appeared with my originally ordered mozzarella, tomato, and basil pesto panini.  She said, sorry, this has never happened before, plopped it down, and left.  I was SO hungry that I ate it all in about three bites (and it was fairly tasty).  The portion size was small so we were both still hungry, and when the waitress came back we ordered some hummus to share and one more glass of wine.  The hummus was good, but seemed a bit expensive ($7) for a small plate.\\n\\nFinally, we were ready to go, and there was no sign of the waitress for quite a while.  When she brought us the check, we had a question about it and no one came around to help us for quite some time, even though we were both looking around the room pointedly.  I think what sealed the deal for this poor review is that no one offered to comp us any of our meal or drinks to make up for the fact that I'd waited an hour for a tiny panini that should have taken about 15 minutes to prepare, at most.  If they'd even given me ONE $4 glass of wine on the house, I would've been writing a much nicer review.  It's just about being courteous to your customers.\\n\\nI did notice another wine bar across the street from Apothecary, so my friend and I decided to try that next time instead!"},{"name":"Bouchee","address":"159 Newbury St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Went over the weekend for dinner on Saturday.

At the bar!\\n\\nHalf hour until we received our appetizer, another half hour before we received miso soup (don't they just ladle it from a big pot?), and another half hour before the sushi. (We were starving and ate quickly, hence only an hour and a half total).\\n\\nGranted, the waitress could have just not liked us - the couple who sat at the bar next to us arrived after us, finished their meal (many many dishes), and left before we had even gotten our entrees.\\n\\nAfter a half hour after we finished our miso soup (ew), my boyfriend asked our waitress if she could check on our sushi. \\"Sushi?\\" she looked at us blankly.

And the curry cauliflower soup was really good.  I do have to say that I'm not fond of the many  children that seem to frequent the place -- they have actually designed it to attract families with children -- they have a play space in the back.  So if you're looking for quiet and a place to relax for chow, skip this place.

I tried to express my dislike for them, but I simply found myself comparing their lack of service and good things to my favorite coffee joint in town, Caf√© Brioso.\\n\\nI first happened upon Brioso as a lunch choice with a friend, as we both worked downtown. I thought that the sandwiches were very good, but I am too much of a penny-pincher to spend over $5 on lunch unless it is a special occasion. That said, at Brioso I can spend $8-9 on soup, a sandwich AND a coffee drink. However, when I go to similar establishments and order this much food, it often totals $10-15, so I think that Brioso is still a value if it is in your budget!\\n\\nThe love affair REALLY began when I ordered my first cappuccino...I was given a substantially wide mug (on a saucer) for optimal coffee drink viewing. The foam was swirled into an intriguing design and a small spoon was placed to the side with two little chocolate drops! The temperature was perfect to start enjoying my drink right away, and the flavor was full bodied, with the Hartzler milk  adding just enough sweetness that I would NEVER have opted to sweeten the drink - it was perfectly balanced as is.\\n\\nThey have two sizes of cappuccino , and they are $2-3! They are big (non-traditional sizes) and served in a cup that is just the right size for the portion. The guys that make the coffee are always VERY friendly (not creepy flirty but genuinely nice!) and let me watch while they swirl the cream. They even leave the lid off when I order  \\"to go\\" so I can look at the design in the cream first!\\n\\nI feel like Amelie plunging my hand in the baskets of grains and legumes at the market, seeking the small pleasures in life when I decide to take a time out and walk to Brioso for a treat. From lime poppy seed scones to the pour-over coffee(s) of the day, I find something new to try each time, even if I opt for my trusty, proven cappuccino. \\n\\nNOTE: Check out Hartzler milk if you haven't before. I know a lot of folks opt for Snowville Creamery a la Jeni's exposure, however, if you are a hard-core dairy lover like myself, you might enjoy Hartzler. It comes in  1/2 gallon glass jars (have to pay a deposit fee) and watch the colors of the lids, because red is NOT whole milk at their company - I think it is green. So go to Whole Foods or Clintonville Co-Op, get some of their whole milk, and open it - DON'T Shake! Inside the lip, you will find the cream at the top, and I love to take a knife and spread this on my toast - the texture is divine. After you remove the cream, I'd suggest you recap and shake the bottle well to distribute the milk fat unless you love it as much as I do. This is the real deal folks - milk as it was intended! If you're looking to save calories and cut some fat from your diet, even the skim tastes like 2% milk of other brands - it is NOT watery. Oh, and Hartzler is NOT organic - they're better - they have wonderful farming practices and are hormone/pesticide free!"},{"name":"North By Northwest Restaurant & Brewery - Stonelake","address":"10010 Capital Of Tx Hwy N","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Meh.

The beer I ordered (Coors Light on tap) was warm and flat.  The chili on the nachos was lukewarm and all clumped together like it had been sitting out all day.

I ordered scrambled eggs, bacon, home fries and wheat toast. Pretty basic and hard to mess up. My friend ordered the breakfast pizza. After a 50 minute wait the food finally came. My eggs weren't scrambled so the waiter took them back and immediately came out with scrambled eggs. Clearly they weren't made fresh. They were cold and tasted like egg beaters or had been sitting for a while. I didn't get my toast. I asked the bartender and she went to the kitchen and came right out with cold hard toast. Again, clearly not just toasted. The potatoes had some weird sauce on them. Overall not a good experience this time. A long wait for horrible food. \\nBut my friend enjoyed her pizza.

The owner was annoyed as well, sticking his finger in the part of the English menu with a few special dishes and said \\"it's in there\\".\\n\\nI ordered Hong Kong style pork chop, which I had in Chinatown and loved... I got badly done sweet and sour pork with pineapple. The waitress angrily declared it to be the right dish.  She also has a charming habit of looking at the menu for 15 or more seconds when you point to your choice, in silence, so you are never sure if she actually got your order. \\n\\nOther \\"highlights\\" from the previous visits: ordered salty-spicy scallop and got a few thinly sliced scallops with a drizzle of hoisin. Ordered Vietnamese fried rice and received a plate of rice with ketchup, I kid you not...Pad Thai definitely had a very remote resemblance to what you get at even mediocre Thai restaurants.  Fried wantons were fried so hard my mother was afraid to eat them for fear of loosing her teeth...The only positive thing to report is that the egg drop soup was OK.\\n\\nThere is \\"sushi\\", but given the dismal quality of cooked food it seems like a very bad idea to try.

It sounds like a ton of beer, but since they were about 4 oz.  pours, we each had about 24 oz. total. Enough to get a bit \\"happy\\" during dinner, but nothing too crazy.

I'm inclined to think that it might be the result of a phenomenon I affectionately refer to as the \\"Scoutmob Effect\\", where group marketing deals bring in patrons that are neither inclined nor equipped to appreciate the quality of the menu offerings. Contrary to what some of these reviewers may lead you to believe, H. Harper offers some very well-executed food, as well as one of the most impressive drink menus in the city. \\n\\nFood: H. Harper Station specializes in traditional southern comfort fare with a contemporary twist. During my recent visit, our party of three started with the candied bacon cracker jacks, homemade potato chips, and relish tray (deviled eggs, pimento cheese, pickled carrots), all of which were flavorful, generously portioned, and artfully presented. For an entree, I opted for the crispy pork belly, which was equally as enjoyable. However, the real standout of the evening was the baked alaska banana pudding, which was among the best desserts I've had this year. The texture was impeccable and the accompanying fried banana slices were a perfect complement. Although I enjoyed a glass of wine, H. Harper also offers an array of novel cocktails, which is undoubtedly attributable to the owner, Jerry Slater, a former mixologist from One Flew South. \\n\\nService: We arrived approximately 10 minutes prior to our reservation. Instead of seating us immediately, we were asked to wait at the bar for a table that was available the whole time. This practice thoroughly agitates me, particularly considering that it shafts the waiter out of tips from the drink order. Fortunately, the caliber of the service picked up from there - in fact, our waiter was so attentive that we almost had to ask for some privacy. \\n\\nAtmosphere: This restaurant is located in a former rail station (Atlanta and West Point), but this wouldn't really be apparent unless you had prior knowledge. The owners have done an excellent job of decorating the space in a manner that pays tribute to the building's history, but isn't necessarily kitschy. Dress is casual and the clientele are mostly in their 30's-50's.\\n\\nCost: Expensive by some standards, but not \\"overpriced\\". Snacks are $5-$12, small plates are $7-$12, large plates are $12-$25, sides are $4, and desserts are all $7. \\n\\nOther: Valet parking is compulsory, by complimentary. H. Harper is closed on Mondays. In addition to dinner (Tuesday-Saturday, 5PM-12AM), they also serve weekend brunch (11AM-3PM) and a prix fixe ($20) Sunday Supper (5PM-10PM)."},{"name":"Banger's Sausage House & Beer Garden","address":"79 81 & 81.5 Rainey St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I've only been once but I would like to go back.

The sushi that was served was fresh and firm, and I find sushi of this quality rare in Boston, or at least in places where you'd pay an arm and a leg for them. That would have given this place a 5-star rating from me.  \\n\\nThe mood-killer for me was the hibachi/teppanyaki.

Juicy chicken breast is not easy to achieve and he did a great job with my salmon. The vegetables were okay, the fried rice was very wet, salty and disappointing.\\n\\nThe chef was, as hibachi chefs should be, very entertaining and had crowd tricks to show off.

The kung pao special with shrimp, beef and chicken was great; lots of meat, celery and tons of peanuts. At first the kung pao didn't seem spicy enough but the after burn caught up with us. My husband loved the tangy pork, which was lots of shredded pork, veggies and large water chestnuts. We also ordered the assorted appetizer, which at $4.50 per person is a great deal.

The name anyway....And felt it wise to stroll in.\\n\\nThey make their own sausage and they do it in a creative way that pays homage to traditions around the world such as Bratwurst (Bavaria); Currywurst (Berlin); Bangers+Mash (UK);  Hot Dog (Chicago); Andouille (French-German Southern Lovechild); Dak Bulgoki (Axis of Evil make meat). You can get your meat in a bun or on a salad if you happen to be a lost diabetic.\\n\\nSuperlative selection of beers. Quite amazingly categorized and curated.\\n\\nSo much of the cool old austin seems to be compressed and squeezed into tiny enclaves between skyscraping condo complexes. Rainey is one for sure.

My wife and I worked with the chef and Christine to really come up with something for everybody to enjoy, whether that was lobster rolls for adults and burgers for the kids. The dessert was a real standout as the chef suggested a Left Hand Brewery Milk Stout ice cream and bread pudding; nothing but compliments all around. \\n\\nBesides the food, the drinking and the friends, a real treat for the rehearsal dinner was a band that started playing in the restaurant around 9 o'clock.

I also don't always want tacos to go, but the Airport location has no space.  Because of this, I never knew they had plates!\\n\\nThe east side location is still counter service with food served in to-go containers, but it makes up for all that is lacking in the Airport locale.  The courtyard area is so sweet, there is tons of parking, and the food is incredibly delicious.  You can enter from 5th or 6th Streets, but the parking is on 6th.  In a few words, it's simple Tex-Mex done right. \\n\\nThe family headed there during the Viva La Streets! festival last Sunday. I had the cheese enchilada plate which is now, hands-down, my favorite in the City.   The gravy-like chile con carne sauce is delicious, and the rice and beans were great.  I ate the entire thing easily where I normally leave the sides or share.  The husband got the migas plate and devoured it.  He added cheese, and it looked outstanding.  Each plate comes with 2 tortillas, but you can ask for extra, if needed.  Our 3 1/2 year old daughter got an egg and cheese taco.  She wolfed down the entire thing.  Food can be hit or miss with her, so she clearly loved it.  \\n\\nThe staff is so friendly.  One guy was incredibly patient as my daughter asked him a million questions about the fountain in the courtyard while he cleaned it out.  \\n\\nWe love the location, the site is gorgeous, and I'm curious to know what they will do with the interior (someone we saw there mentioned it might be turned into a wine bar?).\\n\\nThis location is pricier than Airport, but there are seats, albeit all outdoors from what I can tell.

No. Only difference? Add mustard, remove ketchup and smash sauce = $1.30 more??

I've always thought that their menu is so varied, that they must have something for just about everyone.  Well, even though there is such a variety, I always end up ordering the same thing every time, Grilled Pork Tenderloin.  It seems like pork tenderloin is hard to find in most restaurants, and I know that Sckavone's is always dependably good, so I ordered my \\"usual\\" tonight for dinner.  Theirs is grilled and sliced then topped with mushrooms and a red wine reduction.  It was accompanied by mashed potatoes and asparagus.  Everything was tasty as usual.  Well, maybe the meat was just slightly TOO charred tonight but that's not a big deal because it's usually perfect. . .besides, I'd rather it be that than not charred at all.  My friend is pretty much just like me whenever she goes to Sckavone's. . .she always orders the same thing too.  Her \\"usual\\" is Meatloaf. . .she loves it.  I tried a couple of bites of it and, yeah, it's good.  The meat is very flavorful and is seasoned just right.  It also has a bit of char on it and is topped with housemade marinara and shaved Parmesan.

I appreciated the plate presentation as the chunks of feta were large and the yogurt dip was on the side, so you had the option of adding these as you wanted, or skipping them altogether. The dish was good but the meat was cut in to very small  strips and I think I would have liked it better just cubed. A few pieces had gristle but it was still moist even with the small size.

We had reservations so we were seated immediately. We were also lucky enough to get a table located on the outside of the interior right next to the big windows overlooking the Chattahoochee River and the back gardens. Our waitress (can't remember her name) was super cute and very knowledgeable of the menu. We started off with an order of the sticky buns. Omg! They were the best sticky buns I have ever tasted! Warm, flaky, and sweet. Mmmm. For my main dish I ordered scrambled eggs, bacon, and hash browns. My bf ordered the duck and beef burger with fries which he said was pretty tasty. My eggs were a little too soggy for my taste and my hash browns were too hard/over cooked, but the bacon was good. After brunch we walked out back toward the river which was nice.

In France, wait staffing is taken as a serious career and I think this is the goal of Niko to have the wait staff take their job seriously and not just as a college kid trying to earn spending money. \\nThe food was good- I had escargot, shepherd's pie and coq au vin and 2 desserts.

We made a reservation for 8:00 PM (on a Wednesday night) and, unlike most of the other reviewers, we were immediately seated upon arrival at the hibachi table. Then again, it wasn't busy and we probably would have been seated immediately without the reservation.  After seating us, they gave us iced water, but it was quite a while before a waiter took our order. My date ordered an iced tea that never arrived.  \\n\\nFor our appetizers, we ordered the tuna tartare and the tuna dumplings.  It should be noted that we waited an extremely long time for them to serve us our appetizers.  We were contemplating leaving the restaurant at one point.  Both dishes were beautiful in presentation but tasted almost identical to one another.  Unfortunately, neither appetizer was particularly good.  Though they both contained a decent amount of fresh tuna, the tuna itself was not cold and it was mediocre in quality.  Overall, they were very bland.\\n\\nFor dinner, we both ordered the steak and lobster hibachi.  Though the menu states that the hibachi dinner comes with a salad, neither of us received a salad.  This could have been because we were ordering off of the Restaurant Week menu.  The hibachi chef was nice and entertaining enough and the food was decent.  The rice and vegetables were fine, the steak was cooked to order, but the lobster was a bit overdone and rubbery.  Though I must say that we were each given quite a bit of lobster and steak.  If you're expecting a range of tastes, flavors, and spices, do not order the hibachi dinner.  Like all hibachi, everything pretty much tastes the same.  Good salty, buttery, garlicky flavor, but all one-note.\\n\\nFor dessert, we ordered the mochi ice cream and fried banana.  They were out of the fried ice cream.  The mochi ice cream was a generous portion and delicious.  The fried banana was one banana on a plate with whipped cream and chocolate sauce.  Though it was fine, it would have been better had the banana been sliced and then fried or if it had the accompaniment of some ice cream or a fresh garnish.  It was an oversimplified dessert that could have been executed better.\\n\\nOverall, Osaka deserves only two stars.  The ambiance was fine, the hibachi chefs seemed great, the service was terrible, and the food ranged from decent to mediocre to worthy of sending back.  Nothing, except for maybe the mochi ice cream, was delicious or worth re-ordering.  There is better hibachi out there and there is certainly more-delicious and fresher sushi-quality fish all over Boston.  I'd only go here if you are out with a bunch of friends who can't travel and want sake sprayed into your mouth."},{"name":"Freshii","address":"24 School St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Absolutely love this place!

We waited about 15 minutes before we got to the front of the line (moves pretty quickly) and after putting our names down, we went into the bar and got some mimosas and biscuits. The mimosas were tasty and the biscuit (you must buy food before buying alcohol before noon) was buttery, aka heavenly.\\n\\nAbout 20 minutes later, we got called and the hostess took us to the outside benches, where we were greeted by an amazing brass band that played this from the 2000's and today. The variety of sausage they have here is unmatched. From antelope and venison to duck with bacon and fig to rabbit and mushroom, there is definitely no shortage of creativity around this place.\\n\\nAfter staring at the \\"House-Cured Half Pound Bacon Steak\\" for 10 minutes, my friends and I decided to order that as an appetizer (I know, only in Texas...) The thick cuts of bacon (3) were flavored 1) traditional 2) bourbon infused and 3) Asian flavor (a little bit sweet, a little bit salty). Ladies and gentlemen, the thickness of the bacon blew. My. Mind. The salty flavor mixed with the various sauces for each bacon were incredible. Imagine seeing your favorite band live, in an empty room with just you and the band. This was the food equivalent to that feeling. Yeah.\\n\\nI ordered the fried chicken sausage with waffles - what a great twist on an already amazing dish. The fried part of the sausage was a little much for me so I took most of the fried batter off - it was good but I didn't feel like sausage needed any additional oils. The waffle was soft on the inside but crunchy on the outside and the maple syrup that came on the side complimented it perfectly. Was this as good as chicken and waffles? Well, depends on where you go but generally, no. Was it something good to try whenever you're here? Most definitely.\\n\\nRainey Street has really made itself a name in Austin the past few years, and with something as authentic as Banger's, it's easy to see why."},{"name":"Metropolitan Bistro & Bar","address":"16755 S W Baseline Rd","city":"Beaverton","stars":"3.5","text":"The good: awesome waiters & fantastic hummus plate.\\n\\nUnfortunately,  the terrible main dishes, mediocre beer options, & unpleasing (to us, not everyone else there) musician are all reasons why we won't be back.\\n\\nI ordered the Hungarian Goulash.

They charge 15% extra if you waste any food. Also, $18.95 AYCE for 10 year olds and up. The price is half for children ages 3 - 9. Children under 3 years eat for free. There has to be at least two people for the AYCE option. \\n\\nBased on their website, you choose your soup base first. Options available are Spicy, Spicy/Nutrition, Nutrition, and Plain. On the website, it's House Spicy, House Original, and Half/Half. Next, you select your meats and seafood. Seafood options are extra, ranging from $3.00 - $6.50 and not included in the $18.95 AYCE deal. Meats listed on the website are more plentiful compared to the options on the sheet they give you upon seating. After that, you select your veggies and a main dish. Supposedly, there's a sauce bar. There were a few sauce containers on the table, but that was it. No sauce bar on site. Seems pretty organized right? Not quite. \\n\\nGiven that they recently opened, it's chaotic. My friend and I wasn't sure if we were supposed to circle the options we wanted or note the quantity. We ordered the half/half broth with a medley of meats and vegetables. Both are delicious, but I really liked the spicy broth more. It wasn't too spicy, but has more flavor than the nutrition broth. The downside? They got our selections mixed up with another table. We never got the main dish and a few selections that we ordered. Also, we didn't get the accompanying bowls and spoons used to scoop out the goods. Be sure to ask for those. \\n\\nThey really need more staff. Service is slow. Throughout the whole night, I only noticed three waitresses working the tables.

She took our drink orders right away. It took awhile for the main waitress to come back and take our order. I ordered a California chicken sandwich and hubs ordered the meatball sandwich. We proceeded to wait 45 minutes for our food, with no one providing updates on the status of our order. Within that time, another party was seated after us and received their food (pizzas). We got our meals with 10 minutes to spare before our movie and asked the waitress for the check as soon as she brought the food. She dropped off the check and left so quickly we couldn't ask for refills on our drinks, which were empty ( a water and a coke, not mixed alcoholic drinks, easy stuff). Hostess reappeared with the folder back after running our card. SHE offered refills, not the waitress, but we were already standing up to go, having had to seriously chow our food to make it to our movie. Hubby told her it was a little late for that and she apologized. As far as the food goes: both of our meals were cold. His meatball sub had clearly been sitting awhile because the once melted cheese slid off of the meatballs as soon as he cut into it. Mine had good flavor, would have been better if it was warm. We would have sent the meals back if we had been asked how everything was and been able to request refills, but nobody asked, and the check was there and we needed to go by the time she ran our card. We're not on that side of town often - a day date with Cinetopia and lunch while the kiddo is at daycare is a treat for us - but we won't be going back. I'd rather eat at Cinetopia next time."},{"name":"Waffle House","address":"5565 Northside Dr","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"So it's been a minute since I've been here--because my last experience wasn't that grand.

Ask your server about anything new or off the menu too.  Our server, Keely, was amazing!!

So what's a Plate Party?  For a mere $18 you can join their club where every beer you drink is tracked through their system.  Along the way you can earn discounts and get the requisite t-shirt.

My partner and I are in our both professionals in our mid-twenties and have been treated like scum there on three consecutive (and now final) occasions. Neither of us have ever experienced this kind of discrimination elsewhere. Example: we made a reservation on a weeknight and I was seated looking directly into the sun. I'm not usually one to complain, but given that 85% of the over tables were available, I asked if we could move to another table. Somehow this caused a big stink, and we were eventually moved... to the next table. The manager muttered something along the lines of \\"geez, its only going to be like that for a couple more hours...\\" By the time we finished (which was way longer than it should have been, but that's been covered in other reviews), all of the previously empty tables still remained vacant, which made us ponder what the fuss had been all about. It's bizarre, and certainly trumps the \\"snappy service\\" of the templeton or the foundation. If you look around the restaurant, you can see that they seem to prefer old patrons, an observation reinforced by the fact that we used to go to Nu (before the new menu) with our family and never had any issues.\\n\\nIf your over 35, I'm sure you can go there, order properly and have a wonderful meal.

I can't move on with this review until I first say that they employ the friendliest people in the city (state? world?). I'm not kidding. All we did was walk up to the door and someone, who I presume was the owner or manager, came outside to immediately greet us, apologize that there was not a table immediately available, and assure us that the wait would only be a matter of minutes. This was true sincerity--no fake niceness to be found in this place.\\n\\nMatt was our waiter. By the end of the meal, my friend and I wanted to be best friends with Matt and invite him to hang out with us for the rest of the day. Except that is weird. But I think he would have been down. Maybe.\\n\\nAnyway, I guess I should talk about the food. Thankfully, it was right on par with the service! I had the caramelized apple cinnamon french toast. It was just as good as it sounds. It was an extremely generous portion of french toast topped with lots of apples in a gooey sauce and, of course, a mountain of whipped cream.

My friend often goes here for lunches with co-workers and described the food as being decent so we checked it out.\\n\\nAfter eating here, I have to agree with a previous Yelper review and advise that you skip it. For the price and the quality of the food, you could dine at several other nearby places and enjoy a much better meal. I didn't think the menu was that expansive, but everyone in my group ordered something different. That being said, we weren't very impressed, but couldn't say we were dissatisfied either. The food was simply okay. Nothing special.\\n\\nWe all agreed that that Roasted Garlic Bulbs were great. The orange chicken was also good. I had the herb crusted rotisserie half chicken and found it to be alright. The chicken was juicy and the side of blue cheese scalloped potatoes achieved my vote as the best part of the meal. It wasn't spectacular though and I was frankly pretty disappointed. \\n\\nThe beer flight was good though and we purchased a growler of the Bavarian Hefeweizen. It was fairly tasty and we would probably venture back for a refill. On a side note, Growlers are $25 and each additional refill is $10.\\n\\nService was friendly and fast. The high ceiling does not lend itself to a quiet acoustic arrangement though. It gets loud in there, especially as the dinner crowd descends. \\n\\nIn summary: the fairly steep price and the fairly mediocre food are not complementary to an awesome dining experience.

The complimentary bread was crisp on the outside but with a soft middle and came with oil and vinegar for dipping. The boyfriend had the chicken piccata and it was also above and beyond delicious and much better than any Italian food in Atlanta. But the kicker was dessert. We had the cannolis and they were by far the best I've had in the states. I spent summers growing up in New York and have had my fair share of authentic Italian desserts.

On this occasion, the outer tortilla was room temperature, to be expected, and once I bit into it I realized that my burrito was a mix of food ranging from cold to room temperature. It was a cold day outside so that kinda pissed me off because I was looking forward to a nice warm meal after a long day. I also encountered some burnt grains of rice? Which is actually ridiculous because the rice wasn't even warm.\\n\\n~My room mates salad bowl looked pretty fresh, but she said that there were a few soggy pieces of lettuce and that she bit into a piece of undercooked chicken. She said it was mostly cooked but still raw and gummy in the center. \\n\\n\\nCUSTOMER SERVICE:\\n~The staff at this location seemed to rush our ordering process, but there was still a large portion of food served to us so it wasn't really a problem, but there wasn't anyone there at the time we went so I don't know why they felt a need to rush us and not even be friendly other than greeting us when we walked in.\\n~None of the staff working there seemed happy, not even in the slightest!

Sorry for partying.\\n\\nAt any rate, though it wasn't as spicy as I'd hoped, the XXX Frito pie was still fairly solid, and came with a generous serving of jalapenos and onions.  Perhaps I'm just a chili/Frito pie idiot, but I was a little put off by the meat in my chili.  Is it normal for there to be just ridiculously huge chunks of meat in the chili?  Like I said, maybe I'm the douchebag here, but I'm used to chili that's based with ground beef, not 2-inch meat cubes.  So I left a fair bit of meat on the plate because they were kinda putting me off, but everything else was reasonably solid.  Our nacho appetizer was a little bland and more expensive than it probably should have been, so don't think I'd order it again.\\n\\nAs for the service: our waiter was understandably annoyed with us when we walked in with 11 people and started moving tables together.  Also: I was wearing a bright green shirt and I'm like 85% certain he called me \\"Kermit\\".  WHATEVER DUDE.  But once the beer started flowing and the tab built up, he was great.  Sassy, but great.  They split our checks basically without us even asking and it made life a whole lot easier.  This was at 3 PM on an icy Friday in Austin, so I can't confirm that this level of attention is paid when the place is packed.  But our drinks kept getting refilled, everybody in our group of 11 got what he/she ordered, all was well.

We went to our second choice...closed on Sundays!  So Nuvi to the rescue and we ended up here.\\n\\nThe location is small but the layout is nice so it doesn't seem too crowded.  We had several items on the menu.  Udon soup (I had chicken and my husband had tofu), vegetable tempura, California rolls and cucumber rolls.  \\n\\nThe sushi was good and they use real crab rather than the Krab alot of places put in their rolls.  The cucumber rolls were a pretty small portion though for the price of the serving.  \\n\\nThe tempura was hot and the vegetables were not over cooked at all.  The sauce was bland and there was not much of it.  \\n\\nThe udon soup was pretty disappointing.  There was a good amount of vegetables in it which you don't normally see in udon soup.  Those were pretty tasty.  However, the soup and noodles were both really bland.  We had to add quite a bit more chili powder than usual and it was still noticeably bland.  The chicken was okay but once again bland.  The tofu was actually spiced pretty well and had a nice texture.\\n\\nThis place also has a pretty large Saki selection so if you like Saki you might rate this restaurant higher than I did.\\n\\nOverall This place was okay but I'd only go again if my other places were closed or a friend wanted to try it.

We ordered The french cake sushi, French onion soup, Crispy dumplings and the steak tips for lunch.I'll give our praise first where it is due.  The French cake was great as were the dumplings.                                                                                                                                                             \\n        Now the downsides,The server was extremely slow and inattentive. The French onion soup was different than before in that it tasted very bland (Unsalted maybe or not carmelized properly?) And the steak tips were horrible. I asked for Med-rare they were very overcooked and burned, the \\"Hand cut fries\\" were soggy and you only get about 4 small tips and the rest of the plate was mainly the soggy fries and onions and peppers, very little mushrooms. I sent it back after tasting it. It was that bad. I usually never send food back unless it's really not up to par. And on a housekeeping note, there were tons of flies flying around in the restaurant dining room. Landing on our dishes. The waitress did however come back and notify us the tips were taken off of the bill and she gave us a free brownie dessert. Which was nice and all. But again, I just wanted the team to know so that in the future they don't repeat this as the restaurant is normally great and it's not cheap. For a place that I'm consistently paying well over $100-150 for each visit, there should be NO flies in the dining room, and something as simple as steak tips should not be a problem. Also, having to ask that the meal be removed from the bill and not having a manager even come out to speak to us? There are too many good places around here at the same price point.

Yeah its a food court, but the coolest food court. It has a gorgeous old rotunda , loved it. For someone who lives in an area nearly devoid of old buildings this is awesome. Exposed brick,  old agricultural signs , and that rotunda , it's just plain ole neat-o.\\n\\nSecond you have some tasty food stands , I am guessing they are chains , but if so they aren't too shabby.

The portions are on a small side but if you get an appetizer, entree and dessert (and a slice or two of the bread going around) then you should be just fine. Everything looked really presentable and like fine dining.  Can't say it's absolutely the best food I've ever had but I think the whole package of food, presentation and the service makes it a memorable experience. \\n\\nAtmosphere: it's a little confusing. It's a high end place with fancy food but it's also kinda like a bar atmosphere, especially after 7pm. \\n\\nOutside: they are right on the river and they have a beautiful backyard area. We go there ahead of our reservation at times and just chillax in some of their seating outside with a drink.

Ok, yeah we've been lamenting all the changes occurring in Portland over the past 20 years, and my husband has turned into one of those naysayers who has nothing good to say anymore about Portland cuz all those young people are taking over (he cracks me up).  Me, much less so. Change is inevitable, but I sometimes miss the Portland of my youth.  Perhaps that's why we have become regulars at Skavones.  First, the building & decor still feels like the Portland of the 60s and 70s, and the friendly & conscientious wait staff mostly remind me of the hip, art school types of the same era.  Next, the food.  It is consistently good, old school, American faire!  Try the meat loaf, fried chicken or chicken and ribs combo dinner.  We have ordered pretty much everything on the menu, and we don't recall a single bad meal. Okay, there was that time they kept running out of their garlic mashed potatoes, but no more!  Breakfast is good too, and I agree the precious, baby scones are such a special treat with my coffee.

Looks like the theme is a German (Bavarian/Octoberfest) feel. \\n\\nSausage is good but the combinations of different ingredients and toppings hides the meat flavor. I had the Duk Bulgogi, it's was a bit too overwhelming with powerful and different flavors. It had a little too much going on. I love spicy food but I wanted a sausage.

I can see why but it was more of a shock of something different and exotic hindering what would just be a good sausage sandwich. \\n\\nI'd recommend this place as a chill spot to hang with some friends on a nice spring day.

We looked at the menu prior to going and it seemed intriguing. After hearing a moto of \\"Eat, Meat, Repeat\\", who wouldn't want to check this place out!\\n\\nThe atmosphere is very low key. If you are looking for a classy/fancy place, this is not it. It is a 'cozy' place and has limited seating. The d√©cor is planks of wood and stag antlers. Your drinks come in mason jars (not the cleanest), and seating was not the most comfortable.\\n\\nThe serving staff was very friendly and honest about the product they serve. There were only 2 servers on at the time which did delay my re-fills of soft beverages, but the food made up for it. \\n\\nThe menu is defenantly geared towards meat lovers. They have some very comfort-driven foods on their menu. I had the pulled pork sandwich which came with a side of fries and navy beans. The sauce of the pulled pork was just right, and not over-powering. The fries are made in house along with the ketchup. The ketchup was so good that I purchased a jar for $5.00 (yes...it was that good). The navy beans I did without-they had a very bland flavor to them. \\n\\nMy partner had the mac and cheese. The portion is more of a side than an entree (which it is categorized as). It was good, but more on the dry side and lacked a bit of the \\"cheese\\" factor that usually is expected, which is cool if that's what you're into!\\n\\nWe also ordered the fried dill pickles. These were amazing. I am quite certain they jar their pickles in-house. The pickles are not breaded, just fried. This was an awesome change. \\n\\nI would recommend this place to someone/people that are looking for a southern graving to fill but doesn't want to be too full after having your meal. Their price per portion I think is accurate. I am curious to try this place again, but it doesn't have me running back."},{"name":"Apothecary Cafe & Wine Bar","address":"4800 Burnet Rd, Ste 450","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"General Consensus: Moderately priced food and wine by the glass.  Food overall prepared and came out in a timely matter and executed well with a tiny exception.  Loved the experience and service enough to go back and try more of their selection of wines. \\n\\nFood:\\n\\nStarters: \\n\\n     Proscuitto Mac and Cheese: tiny bits of prosciutto with an incredibly     creamy, tangy cheese sauce--looks like they used orecchiette pasta (shaped like little curved domes). There were bits of what tasted like buttered bread crumbs on top that add a nice bit of texture. This was an appetizer that I shared with my friends.  I wish I had ordered this as my entree, as it is portioned large enough to be so.  I loved this.  \\n\\n    Charcuterie: 4 assortments of meats, the only one I can remember off the top of my head was prosciutto.  I think there was soppressata and calabrese and chorizo as well.  It was also served with chopped sun-dried tomatoes, hearts of palm, olives and a chimichurri sauce and 2 warm rolls with a touch of butter and parsley on top. Also had 3 hearty slices of manchego cheese.  This was an excellent appetizer, and large enough to order as a dinner.  I would order this again.  Very savory. \\n\\n    Candied Pumpkin and Camembert on toast: This is an incredible mix of very sweet and savory.  Beware if you are not a fan of mixing the two.  I personally liked this.  The pumpkin was candied such that it had a soft crunch, and the camembert was warm and melty.  There were shaved bits of basil I think which brought down the sweetness only a little bit. \\n\\nEntree: \\n\\n   Smoked chicken and goat cheese crepe: Had a tomato sauce and served with artichokes and red pepper.  This was a little disappointing, especially with how wonderful our starters were. Goat cheese (although incredibly delicious) was a dollop on top.  It really balanced out the acidity in the tomatoes, and I was hoping it would be inside the crepe rather than on top.  I just instead smeared my goat cheese across the top.  The chicken was a touch dry for me, which was odd considering how much tomato sauce was put around the crepe.  If the presentation suffered for better taste, I would've preferred the sauce and goat cheese on the inside, as the flavors married really well and probably would've hidden the fact that the chicken meat was a little dry. \\n\\nDesserts:  My friends and I ordered a different dish each, and we tried each others dishes. \\n\\n  Key Lime Cheesecake (special): Layers of a vanilla cake (I think) with light and fluffy key lime filling.  I swear there is an aftertaste of Fruity Pebbles, which is not a bad thing.  It makes me keep coming back for more, and it's not an overly sweet dish.  \\n\\n  Cuatro Leches cake (special):  An added goat milk.  I loved this.  Served with cajeta on the bottom of the dish, so you can scrape your spoon to get a bit of caramel with the cake.   It was wet and spongy in texture. \\n\\n  Cajeta and Mascarpone Crepe:  More caramel wrapped in a crepe with mascarpone cheese.  Tasty. \\n\\nWine: I'm not experienced in picking choosing or necessarily tasting wines on my own, so take my opinion with a grain of salt. I really liked their Sorcerer '08 blend.  Big, fruity with a long wet finish.  Tried a friend's Malbec- can't remember the specific name, but I could taste the oak and vanilla, a little bit more dry finish. \\n\\nService and Atmosphere: \\n\\nServers were friendly and attentive, also knowledgable and passionate about their wines.  A plus!  Trying to convince one of them to carry or acquire Don Baltazar Cab Franc 2008 from Argentina.  They specifically look for more unique grapes and they have wines my more knowledgable husband had never even heard of.  Atmosphere is intimate, dark and rich red/brown color walls.  Liked the atmosphere.  They also have an outdoor patio.  Come here if you're feeling adventurous with wines and want to try something new.  The food I personally liked, although from the menu it leans towards a heavy mix of sweet and savory with entrees and appetizers as well as lots of delightfully cheesey things, which might not appeal to some people.   I know Simplicity is right across the street.  I personally like both for different reasons.  Simplicity if you want a more savory palate for food and you have a solid idea of what you want in wine--it is also a lot more low key which I kind of like (I don't need to be bedazzled by atmosphere).  Apothecary for more sweet-savory food with a bit more upscale decor and some unique wines."},{"name":"Capa Steakhouse & Bar","address":"10100 Dream Tree Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Capa is the Spanish themed restaurant in the Four Seasons Orlando.  It serves up small plates (tapas), steaks, drinks, and offers a balcony in which you can catch the Magic Kingdom fireworks show from a distance.\\n\\nMy Overall Rating - 4 Stars (Atmosphere, Service, Food, Return)\\n\\nAtmosphere - Like everything else at the Four Seasons Orlando, Capa is beautiful.  The restaurant sits atop the 17th floor of the hotel.  There is a bold, red, full service bar in the entrance.  The restaurant itself has a red theme throughout, including a beautiful red art piece hung from the ceiling.  The kitchen is open and exposed, so you can see the hustle happening in the background.  But what really sets Capa apart is the fact that you can exit to the balcony and see the fireworks from Disney's Magic Kingdom. 1 Star.\\n\\nService - Nothing but great Four Seasons service.  Our server was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and the concept.  He walked us through the tapas options in addition to some additional new items off the menu.  I love servers who are passionate about food and do a great job describing the potential entr√©e.  Also, our server even replaced our dessert order (churros) because it got cold while we stood outside watching the fireworks. 1 Star.\\n\\nFood - Our meal was very high quality; however, other than having tapas/small plates, I really did not get a true sense of a Spanish theme. The dishes that were the most memorable were the tender, braised pork belly in apple butter and flash-fried cauliflower. We also tried a new item that was off the menu:  it was a series of carrots prepared multiple ways with quinoa.  Honestly, I really enjoyed this dish but I think there were just too many flavors and textures on one plate that I really couldn't get a consistent feel for it all.  For our main course, we selected perfectly grilled, succulent lamb chops along with a bone-in filet.   The filet was a bit overdone, and honestly quite forgettable.  The meal ended with an order churros that we happily dipped in dulce de leche and chocolate sauces.  One last note, Capa is very expensive.  The meal was a great experience, but it was also a great expense.  1 Star. \\n\\nWill I Return? - Yes.  If I ever get the chance to stay at the Four Seasons in Orlando again, I will definitely revisit Capa.  However, my next visit may simply be to order some churros while I sit out on the balcony to enjoy the fireworks. 1 Star.\\n\\nMy Yelp Rating Scale (Sum of all parts):\\n1 Star - Atmosphere - Is it a cool dive?  Perhaps an upscale place?  No matter the type, atmosphere plays a big part and I'll give a star if I like it or thinks it has great charm.\\n1 Star - Service - You can have a great meal with bad service.  But that's also what can make a five star joint drop to four.  It's important to the dining experience that service is great and on point.\\n2 Stars - Food - I'll award up to two stars for the food, since this is the main reason we dine out.  Sometimes the extra star is given for value, but it's really all about the food.\\n1 Star - Will I come back? - If I know for a fact I'll return, I'll give this a star. A place has to make an impression for me to return. \\n\\nEach Category can be given up to 1 star except food (2 stars) because I consider all these categories important to the overall dining experience.

I certainly don't think so.\\n\\nGrowing up in the metropolis that is Lexington with its handful of restaurants, I have been dragged to Mario's many a time and I don't think I ever ate anything that resembled decent.

Pizza that is mushy with too much sauce, fresh from the can, and too much cheese.

Not because of the food. \\n\\nI mean, at Red Lobster the food could have been cardboard with crayon-colored tones to give the illusion that I was supposed to care about it, and I still would have been ecstatic. Why? BECAUSE I GET TO TAKE THE LIGHTHOUSE GLASS WITH MY SHIRLEY TEMPLE IN IT HOME. \\n\\nEverything about the Grass Skirt Tiki Room went up twelve points (abstract measure of yay) when I found out I got to keep the Tiki cup.  Keep that in mind moving forward, because there are alligators ahead. \\n\\nOne of the big gotchas was parking. There's a parking lot next to the restaurant. I used to park there now and then when I worked off of High St. (professionally, not moonlighting on a bench).  The rate was 3 bucks, sometimes. The sign is the same from five years ago, claiming $3 for daytime, $2 for night. The machine you use to pay now says $5. This is a little weird. Central Parking Systems problem, not Grass Skirt, I know, but still, beware. \\n\\nNext, we voyage into the dark unknown.  No seriously, it's dark. Bring a flashlight. If you run into a server they'll be very polite about it and no less welcoming. Service is completely about promptness and efficiency. I'm not asking for a song and dance, mind you, but our server seemed a little rushed. He was still on point with most things and gave a good vibe about food options that were preferable. \\n\\nThe drink special was a $3 spiced rum and 7. It was tasty but a little lightly poured. Let's talk about drink expectations: When I go to Betty's, Surly, Tip-top, and Dirty Franks, and I order the $3 drink, I get a drink that will try to kill me. I mean that with absolute reverence and love. The drink will appear and I will cry because it's just the right blend of sugar and alcohol to make me think I stumbled into being five years old again and fell face-first into the boy scout bug juice. \\n\\nThis drink did not do that. This drink made me think I was on a remote island, enjoying the sun, and suddenly a storm washed over and dumped me back at the restaurant. It was heavy on the rocks, low on the drink. Things I've learned from bartenders: don't complain about the drink pours unless you know the policy of the bar. Skully's pours precise. Axis pours like you don't want to remember what you ordered and don't care. Typically Lessner-grade bars pour precise and elegantly. This felt like I was shorted. It was elegant, but slim. I've got enough opportunities in my life to buy skinny jeans, I'll take my drinks boot cut, straight, or even loose/relaxed. \\n\\nThe tiki cup pour was far healthier, and I will say getting to keep the cup makes it feel as though I got a $5 drink with a $2.50 cup, which feels great. That makes me suspicious though that the lean is towards the tiki pours. \\n\\nFood! Ah yes, we did eat. So, the Spam is delicious. I never thought I would ever utter that phrase in any way again. My wife was unenthused, but I could not stop eating the little cute sammich (yes, sammich) on a Hawaiian bun.  \\n\\nThe Hawaiian burger was equally tasty, though strangely half the patty tasted more tender than the other. For a 1.5\\" diameter patty, that's weird. \\n\\nOur server was pretty sure the Sweet Potato Fries would fill us up, and I think if only one of us were to eat the serving we were given, he would have been correct. For sharing, the fries are a good add-on, about the contents of one sweet potato. They were perfectly prepared and the dip was tasty. Definitely a do-over. \\n\\nAlas, we were still hungry after all the little teeny burgers, so we ordered the chicken salad sandwiches. Presentation on these was adorable.  Pineapple chunks in the center of each pile of salad, with the bun tops set off to the back at an angle to give the feeling of a hood being pushed up so you can see the quality of the engine of the car you bought. The chicken salad itself was a good consistency, no weird chewy chicken surprises as I'm used to with other chicken salads, and the mix was great overall. Flavor-wise it was bland, and left me thinking \\"well... that was nice?\\"\\n\\nAfter attempting to close out our bill twice, we paid and left. I'm pretty sure I'll return, but I do hope the kinks get worked out. They usually do with places like this, and I think there's some good possibility. There may be a need for a few revisions to the menu, and the drink menu is still in the works. \\n\\nOverall, I left with an adorable blue cup, and some fond memories of a dim room with some good food. I'm pretty sure my wife was sitting next to me, but I forgot my flashlight, so I'll have to ask to be sure."},{"name":"Tamale House East","address":"1707 E 6th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"The guy at the front was very friendly and gave us recommendations on what were good dishes.

We had the 5 course tasting menus...we ordered the Chef's Tasting and Farmer's Menu to get the best of both worlds. The winner? Farmer's Menu. Don't get me wrong both were great but the Farmer's menu was just a bit better than the other. It's not on the menu at this time but our favorite was the cold corn soup. It was just so refreshing. The chef must like mustard because you'd find a lot of the plates with that flavoring...especially the delicious rolls. If they were made in a store, I'd hoard them and eat it everyday. The only thing I thought was odd was the same dessert on offered for both tasting menus. What if you didn't want chocolate? Odd and I felt robbed. \\n\\nThe service was alright.

Plain dining room but pretty big.  service was friendly but not necessarily all that helpful (how often is it on Buford Hwy for someone who only speaks English?).  \\n\\nSo the food . . . Had the 3 dumplings soup which was very tasty with 3 different varieties of dumpling that all had shrimp and a vegetable in them - one had mushroom, another had some greens, forgot the other. A bit of chili oil spruced this one up right to where I like it.\\n\\nThe crispy chicken with garlic was given a GUARANTEE by our server and he was to be trusted b/c this was the definite highlight.  Fried chicken skin worthy of consumption in the finest of southern chicken shacks but the chicken had been marinated in soy sauce giving it a great salty/sweet flavor that was complimented nicely by the bits of garlic and pepper that were scattered all over the chicken.  Worth going back for that\\n\\nBeef chow fun was tasty and not very greasy but maybe a tad more grease than I would like - hard to find any thats not though.  We also had some bok choy with garlic that was a necessary green/fresh/crunchy addition to the meal.\\n\\nFunniest moment of the meal was when we got our bill they brought us each a bowl of something that looked like black bean soup.  That's actually what it turned out to be but it was sweet with some kind of small tapioca balls in it . . .  Anyone know the name of this dish? We decided that it was strangely intriguing but had it not come out after several successful dishes then we would have been much more wary of its murky appearance.\\n\\nOverall it was some good food with the crispy chicken being a standout (probably better than Bo Bo Garden) and for 3 of us it was just over $30 and all were content.

So, this review is somewhat more of a first impression. Having had many mediocre meals lately, and many more where the chef had a heavy hand with the salt, I wondered if Bistro Niko, one the newest editions to the Buckhead Life Restaurant Group would live up to the reputation that the Group has always exuded.\\n\\nI waited until just a couple days before said Restaurant week began to make my reservation at Bistro Niko, believing I could easily snag one in this sad economy. I was floored to see that Bistro Niko in Buckhead was full almost every night and I was lucky to get a reservation for 6:30 pm on Tuesday.\\n\\nAs we entered the restaurant from what seemed like the rear, we passed by the open kitchen. I watched as staff hussled to get dishes out of the kitchen and to the diners in the full and vibrant dining room. As the name would suggest, Bistro Niko is a French Restaurant and most of the menu is in French with English translation, a tactic I don't much care for. Really - who is reading the French?\\n\\nSo, our server, Corey brought us the menu and told us about some specials which went right over my head as I was fixated on the restaurant week menu. When we asked him about Bistro Niko's special menu, I braced for the friendly smile on his face to disappear as he learned we were only there for the Prix Fixe menu, but it never did. He graciously pointed to a small square space on the bottom of the menu where Bistro Niko's Prix Fixe menu is. Turns out, you can always get a 3 course meal here, it will just cost you about 5 bucks more than during restaurant week.\\n\\nI was a little disappointed that the menu was somewhat different than the one posted online. There were no piquillo peppers stuffed with cod and potatoes, or Veal Osso Bucco, or Coq Au Vin, to be had. But all was not lost. One of the managers even came over to explain to us that they change out the 3-course menu quite frequently. Very nice touch.\\n\\nSo, we ordered the rabbit ravioli and smoked salmon sammies. Yeah, that's not their official name, but you get the idea. Both were excellent choices, each with its own distinct flavor. And at around $10- $11 per appetizer, a superb deal. Corey even made sure to leave the broth of the pasta as he could see we were sopping it up with our bread.\\n\\nFor entrees, we ordered the duck breast and the shrimp in fried wontons. The duck was tender and juicy. I expected it to be a bit more dried out but it wasn't at all. The outside could have been a tad more crispy but that's my only criticism. As for the shrimp, this was the highlight of the evening. It seems simple shrimp with fried wontons I know. By the way, that's not the proper menu term either, I just can't think of what it is. It was crispy and delicious. And the lemon aioli that came with it was the perfect accompaniment for dabbing our shrimp wontons.\\n\\nAs our dinner was nearing the end, I looked around at the packed dining room. I assumed it was incredibly busy due to the Buckhead Restaurant week, but when I inquired with Corey, he said no, it's just always like that. Perhaps it is a reflection of the very reasonable menu pricing. Although Bistro Niko looks all fancy pants inside, most menu items are under $20 and many appetizers under $10. Or then again, maybe it is just the well-seasoned food, not overloaded with salt and other unnecessary seasonings.\\n\\nOh, and the service? Still outstanding like I've come to know at all the Buckhead Life Restaurants. Our server, Corey was helpful, friendly and extremely efficient. He was jovial and could interact with us, but left us alone to enjoy our dinner. All in all and great experience. Definitely go check this place out.

When we walked into the lobby, it smelled like nag champa incense. Not a smell I associate with an appetite. Like someone is trying to cover another smell of I-dunno-what, ok. Enter the dining area. Dirty floors, and another smell that could only be described as a mop that sat in old dirty water and used to Clean the floor. We sat by the play area inside and the glass was dirty, and I don't mean like just a few smears which would be expected during a food rush, but it was smears on top of smears. The play yard, which is clearly marked for children, was occupied by teenagers...lots of them.

I'd been before and sat at the bar for drinks and had a great experience -- loved the beverages and the bartender.  But this most recent experience left a seriously bad taste in my mouth.  Pun totally intended.\\n\\nFirst, credit where credit is due:  All our drinks were delightful.  As was the relish tray, the confetti salad, the fried chicken, and the chicken pot pie small plate which was brought out as a replacement app after we were served a batch of seriously bad mussels.\\n\\nJust to reiterate: Bad mussels.  Really, indisputably, shockingly foul seafood.  And  the fact that we were served a bowl of mussels that reeked like rotting flesh from 5 feet away was not as bad as the way the restaurant handled it.  When we informed our waitress (the blond chick that used to work at Pure) that our mussels were putrid, her response was:  {shoulder shrug} \\"Sometimes we get to the bottom of the barrel and there are bad mussels.  Sometimes there are bad oysters too.\\"....  Seriously?  That is your response to serving us something that could have made us all violently ill?  Its not like we were complaining about stale bread here.  Allegedly she told the kitchen about the bad batch, but less than 5 minutes later we watched them send out another order of mussels.  I'm telling you, the way that bowl smelled, there was no way the kitchen could have been unaware of what they were sending out.  Flabbergasting.  We then watched the tables faces morph into disgust upon trying said mussels, and they sent them back too.  We then approached the owner to let him know that his kitchen was sending out bad seafood.  He too seemed remarkably unconcerned, responding with a nonplussed  \\"This is the first I've heard of it.  I've been making drinks at the bar.\\"\\n\\nFinally a nice female employee (perhaps a manager, I'm not sure) came over and for the first time apologized and actually acknowledged that the restaurant messed up.  By that point we were so amazed at the flippant reaction that our waitress and the owner gave us that the damage had been done.  If the mussel situation had been handled appropriately we would have forgiven the kitchen snafu, because everything else was delicious.  But I doubt any of us will be patronizing an establishment that doesn't give a f*$# about whether it gives its patrons food poisoning."},{"name":"Bombay Kitchen Authentic Indian Cuisine","address":"4107 Lawrenceville Hwy","city":"Tucker","stars":"4","text":"I ordered the number 15 chicken Korma and it was delicious.

The 5 course tasting menu was $50 per person and you can add wine pairings for an additional $25. Given that the cheapest bottle of wine on the menu was $40 we thought it was definitely worth the extra $10 for the wine pairings which comes to about 3 glasses of wine each. So we go in knowing we're going to do the tasting, let the fun begin. The first thing they brought out was a fantastic amuse-bouche of strawberry soup with minted salt rim. It was delicious and we knew we'd be in for good, innovative food. The 1st course was a piece of pork belly with all sorts of interesting things that I cannot remember. It was savory yet sweet yet fatty and delicious, but really how can you go wrong with pork belly? The 2nd course was an escarole salad with pear puree, goat cheese, and candied nuts. The bitterness of the greens was nicely offset by the sweet pear puree and my husband just loved it. The 3rd course was a shrimp dish and the details escape me again. I was very good though and it came with three huge, succulent shrimp. The 4th course was a yummy duck breast and I swear they gave you a whole breast. The 5th and final course was their decedent flour less chocolate cake. The cake was perfect, like a silky dark chocolate truffle. The orange creme was a bit much for me. I thought it took away from the deliciousness of the chocolate cake. I like dark chocolate and the cream was a little to sweet for me. The food itself was very good and the portions were fairly substantial for a tasting menu. We left stuffed which was surprising and we thought the food was a good value for what you got. Where I think they missed the mark was on the service and the wine pairings. It felt like they were rushing us through our tasting menu and on more than one occasion they either brought out our next wine before we were finished with the last or actually tried to take my plate away before I was even finished with the course. The wine pairings were really disappointing as well. They weren't offensive, but they weren't amazing either. It felt like they were pairings I could have come up with myself at home. \\n\\nOverall we enjoyed our Zoot experience. They are a little less expensive than Wink, but we enjoyed our experience at Wink a hundred times more. The tasting menu is a decent value for a 5 course meal, but skip the pairings as they aren't that fantastic. I'm not sure that I'd be back unless another coupon came my way.

We looked forward to revisiting to celebrate Christmas and our 10th anniversary.  Let me preface this by saying that the service was impeccable. The waitstaff were wonderful and very accomodating.  We started by sampling a few different appetizers which included the smoked salmon, the calamari and something new the chef introduced, Australian octopus.  Both the salmon and calamari were wonderful, but the octopus put off everyone in the group.  While the pieces were tender, it was WAY over seasoned as if someone dumped a whole jar of powdered cinnamon and red pepper into the dish.  It was inedible.   For entrees I had the Shitaki encrusted venison, my wife had the NY strip with truffled augraten and my daughter had the smoked duck breast.  My son had buttered noodles, but he's a picky eater so I'm not going to review that.  The first thing I noticed with my dish was the lack of Shitake mushroom.  There were 3 or 4 caps laying in the broth with the udon noodles, rather than \\"encrusted\\" on the venison the way it was described.  The meat was very tender and not gamey, but the flavor profile of the broth was a head scratcher.  With Shitake and udon in the dish, I was expecting an Asian type broth to pull together the dish but it was ambiguous and didn't seem to commit to any direction.   Almost like an au jus but bland.  It wasn't horrible, but not what I come to expect from the stellar reputation of Canoe.  My wife's steak was ok, but she certainly wasn't singing it's praises.  The real disappointment with her dish was the truffled augraten.   She said it tasted as if they forgot the truffles.   Truffles can be very overpowering and just a pinch is easily detectable in any dish.  Not sure what happened here.  My daughter's smoked duck started well, the meat was succulent and well seasoned, but as she got to the pieces underneath, they were extremely bitter as if they were encrusted with orange zest.  She couldn't eat it and didn't want to take it home either.  After all the let downs I was really looking forward to dessert.   I thought, there's no way this can get screwed up . . .   I was wrong.  If you've ever dined at Canoe, you may know their flagship dessert is their popcorn ice cream sundae.  I had been craving this dessert for well over a year and thought about coming into Canoe just for this alone.  My first bite was a shockwave of despair: extremely bitter.  They had burnt the friggin caramel! I wanted to cry at this point.  With everything said, we will not be returning to Canoe.  We had always regarded this place as a treat to take visiting relatives and friends to, but I don't know what the hell happened with this place.

It's a great time in a unique location for a bar, i.e. a strip center housing Target and a number of Asian stores/restaurants. That said, and given the sad attendance even on trivia night, I cannot envision a scenario where this place will be around for the long haul...albeit, I'd be happy to be wrong. \\n\\nOne slight irritant at the top. I understand it's a \\"European\\" sports bar. Great, I get it, ten TV's with futbol. Knock yourself out one guy in the Manchester United jersey. But, what's with five TV's set to bowling? There's nothing European, or entertaining for that matter, about bowling. Five TV's? An NBA playoff game, starring a team about sixty miles down I-35 was playing...like 'em or not, one shouldn't have to ask for ONE television to be playing said game. \\n\\nNow to the goods. The happy hour beer choices, which are available to 11:00, are adequate and the prices of these selections are good. Yet, it's a serious headscratcher that the local brews, notably those from Live Oak, cost $5.75. That's insanity...people, the brewery is about five miles away...so, it's not the transportation costs. How can that price possibly be justified? The same can be said for the 512 selections, and the Real Ale options to a lesser extent. \\n\\nThe food is good in spots, and okay in others. One of the highlights is the Brie Pizza. The combination of brie, pesto, garlic, pecans and figs is mighty tasty. The pizza portions are also large enough that it can be split between two people. Another standout is the Club sandwich. Their version varies from the usual recipe in that they serve the sandwich with chicken, instead of ham, along with avocado and pesto mayo. \\n\\nMoving along to some of the less stellar options...the pork sliders are good, although they come in three bite size portions. The Drunken Chips and Cheese and Drunken Fries are pedestrian. The name is catchy and implies there is something unique going on, but in reality it's just chips and fries with their smoky queso poured over them. The wings, both the Hail Mary and BBQ flavors, were enjoyed by my trivia partner, but honestly, I didn't find anything memorable about them. The onion rings are equally passable, but not something that I'll seek out. \\n\\nThe service is pretty spotty. When the servers are around they are very friendly, but you can go twenty minutes without seeing anybody...and then they'll be spells when they'll stop by twice within a five minute span. This is when there's about ten folks in the place, total. Also, I never really know who our server is there. I'm left wondering, can I flag down this guy, or is she or waitress...well, wait, that guy took our last drink order...hell, I don't know! \\n\\nSo, good for a drink...great for trivia.

It's time for a question and answer session, I think.\\n\\nQ ::: Is there anything better to do on a Saturday night in Dorchester?\\nA :::: Well, me, a pair of local couples, a group of Vietnamese kids in hoodies and a posse of Khmer kids who'd driven down from Lowell couldn't find anything better for sure. The menu of Pho 2000 does offer lots of other gems - fried squid, fried fish, quails, all that pho... but look around, and nearly all of us here were going for their specialty - the 7 course beef dinner.\\n\\nQ ::: How does this work?\\nA ::::Yeah,  I really needed someone to tell me as I was a bit mystified at first but you start out with some basics laid out:\\na. a plate of uncooked rice paper circles and a bowl of hot water\\nb. a plate of rice noodles\\nc. a (wonderful) plate of fresh raw vegetables - basil, cilantro, lettuce, cucumber, apple etc.\\nd. a gravy of some kind - salty, probably squid with a rice base.\\n\\nQ ::: OK - what are all these for?\\nA :::: They're for making your own summer rolls with stupid! You spin the rice paper in the hot water to melt it until it's loose. You lay it on your plate, put the noodles, veg and meat in, add some hot sauce, roll it up, tuck in the ends and then dip it in the gravy and eat away. You'll suck at first but you'll soon be the expert.\\n\\nQ ::: So what about the meat? 7 courses of beef?\\nA :::: Yeah, let's talk about them. I'm not sure there is an order but here is how they came for us...\\n1. Beef slices and a vinegar hot pot (on a flame heater) for us to cook them with.\\n2. Garnished beef slices and a butter frying pan (on the flame heater) to cook them in.\\n3. Top quality raw beef in lime juice with peanuts to eat RAW (yeah!)\\n4. A thick and rich rice-based beef soup - almost like porridge.\\n5. A beef, herb and noodle meatball with crackers.\\n6. A skewer of beef sausages grilled with leaves around them.\\n7. A skewer of marinated onion slices wrapped in beef.\\n\\nQ ::: Anything else?\\nA :::: What more do you want??! We were so full it was ridiculous. A good bit of advice would be to take it easy on making the summer rolls - you can get too full too quickly, don't rush. Also it's probably not wise to get their gorgeous avocado shake - that's not exactly lite fare either. Instead be brave and have the lovely salty plum soda.\\n\\nQ ::: Going back?\\nA :::: For sure. The 7 course dinner was a bit too much and is probably better with a large fun group (it's 30 dollars for 2 people minimum). The rest of the menu looks very tempting though, and despite the terrible decor and out of the way area I'll have to be back to try other dishes before I upgrade to 5 stars."},{"name":"Banger's Sausage House & Beer Garden","address":"79 81 & 81.5 Rainey St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"This will be the 99th review for a place that has only been open for 2 months!

I added Salmon to it which was a great choice- it was cooked and seasoned perfectly enough to be normal...but nothing special. My poor springs were covered in this gross citrus dressing. It wasn't even lightly tossed onto the salad, the leaves were soaked with it. It made the greens taste like they had rotted- i.e. I ate maybe one or two leaves on my dish. Everything else was OK. I got sweet potato hash on the side and I wasn't impressed at all. It barely tasted like sweet potatoes and there was no seasoning. \\n\\nAtmosphere was ok, the place is pretty cramped. My friend and I grabbed a seat next to the fire (it is 20 degrees out, okay?) and were fairly cozy until the bar started getting crowded.

The Yelp reviews are pretty much spot on about this restaurant.  Wan Lai is located in the same strip mall/shopping complex on Buford Highway, just south of the Chamblee-Tucker intersection, with Pho Bac, Mini Hot Pot, Viet Tofu, and the Hoa Binh super market.  It looks like there are two entrances to the restaurant, one north and one south, be sure to enter from the south (next door, to the left of Pho Bac).  It's easy to get fooled.\\n\\nWan Lai specializes in Cantonese food and has an extensive, colorful menu selection.  To my parents' pleasant surprise, our chatty 21-year old server Kevin spoke the same Chinese dialect (Teochew) as them!  We ended up ordering Manila clams, gai-lan (Chinese broccoli), steamed half chicken with ginger and scallions, and fresh whole perch.  This was a lot of food (we accidentally ordered the perch and did not plan on it), but everything was so good that the three of us finished it completely.  My dad is a huge fan of the steamed/boiled chicken with ginger and scallions and orders it at almost every Chinese restaurant he goes to and he loved the version they serve at Wan Lai.  See my local pics for photos of the dishes.  We were given complimentary mango pudding to end the meal.\\n\\nWe were attended to by Kevin and another older gentleman and the service was excellent.  Very friendly and the owner/chef came out to talk to us twice.  I think Wan Lai may be one of the better Cantonese restaurants in Atlanta.

I also tried some of my friend's cochinita pibil, which had a better mole flavor to it than my taco, and one of each of the tamales, the only one of which was remotely good was the pork one.

The Curry Puffs and Hot & Sour Soup are amazing, and the Malaysian dishes are all great.\\n\\nSo instead, a couple of tips for future diners:\\n\\n1) What's on the menu is what's on the menu. Don't try to get cute with your orders (\\"Can you make some kung pao less spicy?' \\"Can you make this without peanuts?\\"). If you don't like the way one dish sounds, look around on the menu - I guarantee there will be another dish that is almost exactly the same, but without the thing you don't want. They'll genuinely try to accommodate you, but will fail, and you will then write a bad review, which makes everyone sad.\\n\\n2) Don't order something with an ingredient you know you aren't going to like. If you don't like eggplant, don't \\"try the eggplant.\\" If you don't like octopus and scallops, don't order them. If you don't like okra, don't order anything with okra. This is an asian restaurant, and they're going to accentuate the nature of the food -- if you don't like, say, okra because it is slimy, I'm going to make a wild prediction that you won't like a dish where the sliminess of the okra is the centrepiece of the meal."},{"name":"Angelina's Greek Gyros","address":"112 NW Couch St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Definitely worth the wait!

Right off the bat, she knew exactly what size to suggest (10 in round cake).  I also asked her if she'd be able to draw a motorcyle- and she said she's done some before.  She asked what kind of bike it was- I said it was a 2007 harley road king with no ferring on the front.  She said she'd find a picture online to draw it from and she'd add a cute saying if she thinks of one.  She was also very flexible with pick-up and was so nice and easy-going on the phone. Ordering was a synch.\\n\\nAll week I was anticipating the cake.... and it did not let down!!! It was quite a hit and the birthday boy LOVED it!  The bike she drew on looked exactly like his bike!

However, the new crew of servers is not the dream team. One of the servers told us one of their tables as \\"only for parties of 8.\\" First of all, that's absurd. Secondly, our party of 6 included my 90 year old grandmother who needs a cane and cannot stand at the door indefinitely for a different non-8-specific table to open up. Thankfully a different server stepped in and intervened. Later when we were placing our orders the server took ours in absolute silence. There was no nodding or verbal acknowledgment to anything we said. It was very uncomfortable for everyone involved. I understand that waiting tables is not the most amazing job in the world, we have all been there, but while you're here you might as well take some pride in your work, or like just pretend you don't loathe everything and everyone around you. This lack of investment in the job is reflected in the physical restaurant too, the establishment is also coated in a very distinctive film of grease and we see a lot of people rinsing off their utensils before using it. \\n\\nAll that being said the food is fast and hot. I find the pho a bit bland compared to the other places I frequent. The meat is tough and the broth is not very flavorful without a heaping amount of fixins.

It was a good call.\\n\\nThe facilities. Very stylishly decorated with clever lighting that makes it very easy to see your dinner and--had I any tonight--your dinner companions, but leaves everything else in relative darkness. This creates a surprising sense of intimacy with those around the table and your waitperson...even though it's a bit loud and you can hear the many other people around you constantly.\\n\\nThe Food. I had the wilted spinach appetizer. I say appetizer instead of salad b/c it's not quite a salad...and isn't listed with the salads. It's very slightly wilted, definitely still a lot of the tooth left...wilted might be too strong even...perhaps warmed. with an understated dressing that I couldn't really identify. on top of that is some crumbled/shredded Parmigiano-Reggiano...the real stuff...completely unrelated to that stuff in the green bottle your parents got out with the bottle of Ragu. Nutty, crispy, salty. Perfectly balancing the earthy greenness of the spinach, and adding in a little richness without upsetting the overall healthiness of the dish. Perhaps the most healthy appetizer I've ever seen in a restaurant known for its meat dishes.\\n\\nFor mains I had the French Dip with fries. The fries were truly superb...shoestring style--my favorite--cooked perfectly so that they are uniformly crisp, but not crunchy...and not sparing the salt. Some folks might think they are oversalted...but that's OK with fries...occasionally. the sandwich itself was great, but not fantastic. The bread was of good quality and toasted very nicely...which is an oddly rare thing. The roast beef was of very high quality...clearly not brought in house in a cryovac bag, precooked. They take their roast beef very seriously. Two things kept it from being fantastic though: 1) it was slightly cool (not luke warm) in the center, which is disappointing after the superb execution on the fries and spinach, 2) it was slightly stringy...I'm very picky about this...it's not hard to cook a piece of meat like this and leave it perfectly tender throughout. \\n\\nFor dessert--which I almost never do, but a friend commended it so highly I tried it--I had the 5 nut warm brownie, ToGo. I was very impressed with the attention to detail in how this was prepped for ToGo (I will upload photos of this and the spinach). The ice cream was of good quality as was the cream sauce. The caramel sauce was ok...but I'm not a fan of that sort of thing. The brownie itself was not oversized as is so often the case with desserts in these kinds of restaurants, and was made nicely. It was probably the best brownie dessert I've ever had...but I did think it was a touch too sweet.\\n\\nThe service. My waitress was named Amy, I believe. She was superb...one of the best waitpersons I've had in a long time. She was attentive without going overboard...she made sure to come to the table and ask how every thing was a seemingly timed 1-2 minutes after it had arrived, giving me time to assess before her arrival. There was a small miscommunication about horseradish sauce for the sandwich which I attribute to the noise level...I'm sure she thought I said I didn't want any, but when I asked for some after the sandwich was delivered, she immediately got some without any indication that she thought I was at fault or was an idiot...she just made sure I had what I wanted.\\n\\nI'd be happy to go to Houston's again then next time I'm in the ATL."},{"name":"First Watch","address":"1600 Hancock Rd, Ste 105","city":"Clermont","stars":"4","text":"Best place for either breakfast or lunch.

They're not shy with soy and sesame oil here, but you can offset that nicely with fresh greens & veggies. I also confess I really can't tell much difference among Chi'lantro's Korean BBQ meats, so go with whatever you like. They also offer grilled vegetables and marinated tofu. \\n\\nAll in all, it's good stuff, and an interesting twist from the other Chi'lantros. My noodle bowl was $8.43, and remember they no longer take cash. Maine Root soda fountain. Bright & cheery, with a happy staff. And you may have to share tables. Let's see...oh yeah, Kimchi fries: In the Chi'lantro restaurant system, places without Kimchi fries are considered especially heinous. So yes, you can get them here.

Then I said, \\"ATTENTION EVERYONE I NEED EVERYONE'S ATTENTION!  I just want to wish everyone a happy fourth of july, DONT DRINK AND DRIVE!  I LOVE YOU ALL\\" and then i walked away.

There was at least one scuffle in the pen as well, but that's to be expected and it doesn't bother me (it's how dogs communicate, people!) but at least 5 people got all bent out of shape about it - so that was annoying too.

One of their staple blends is an Ethiopian Harrar; this coffee blew my mind! It has some crazy bright fruity flavors and very light and clean. Always get the pour over if available as it is significantly more delicious than their drip blends. I am not really into the espresso but I have heard they have an awesome light roast espresso. If you are a big spender and want to try some of the styles not available that day, they will make you an individual pour over of any of the blends but it is five or six dollars a cup.\\n\\nThe food is alright. They pull a huge lunch crowd from downtown, so If you are going during the week expect a big wait between 12-2. Mostly soups salads and sammies. For my money's worth I think their salad is the most solid thing they offer. They also do some sweet and savory baked goods that pair well with their awesome coffee. \\n\\nOne thing Brioso has on most other places is the location. Columbus did not have good spots downtown for a long time, so it is great to see the Gay street area has developed a solid set of unique businesses. The previous reviewers were correct in that trying to park around Brioso is a nightmare. Most of the meters around area 30 minute limit so if you are trying to camp out and do some work do not try to park on Gay. After a few frustrating outings I have found that if you go one block north on Long street you are almost guaranteed to find a spot that has a 3 hour limit, so much easier than trying to park on Gay.\\n\\nI often work remotely on Fridays and love to get up and drive to Brisos to camp out.

Nothing's ever really been wrong with the food, so it wasn't an issue when we decided to stop in yesterday for lunch.

I got some waters and went outside to wait for my husband. Ten minutes later, he walks out, undeniably pissed off. He puts my plate in front of me and goes back in to wait for his food. In that time I looked at my sandwich. I'd ordered their season cranberry turkey deal. All I saw was bread. Bread touching bread. So I opened it and it looked SO DISGUSTING. I would seriously never, ever serve something like that to someone - wilted piece of spinach pressed up against one side with some cranberry jelly, and on the other, THREE little slivers of turkey that looked like it was covered in mayo.

The manager looked like he was the most miserable man at a job, ever. He genuinely didn't seem to care that we'd had to wait, that our food was cold, that it looked inedible, that we wanted a refund, nothing. He just muttered, \\"I'm sorry about that,\\" once or twice, and we were done. He refunded the money, not saying a word to us the whole time, and we left to find somewhere else to have a quick lunch.

We arrived at 3PM on a Saturday and were told that it was a 20 minute wait for inside and 45 for outside. We were starving so we asked to be put on the inside wait list. The problem was (we later found out) they only called people off the outside wait list. I finally went up and complained after 45 minutes of waiting (and sooooo many open tables) and was told that we couldn't be seated because there were no flags available (the flags that tell the food delivery people where to bring the food). Finally, we were seated inside. We sat there for 20 minutes and saw a ton of waiters walk by us but no one to take our order. I finally walked up to a man who appeared to be in charge and he said \\"you don't get a waiter inside, you order at the bar\\". We were soooooo pissed. His only response was \\"I am surprised no one told you that\\". My husband went up to the bar to place our order and the man came back and said we can move you outside where you can have a waiter. I said \\"and we will have a waiter right now? Bc my husband is at the bar ready to order\\". He confirmed that he would have a waiter to our table immediately. We sit down and 15 MORE minutes go by. A group of guys get seated next to us and a waiter immediately comes over to take their order. At this point we are furious and rudely ask the waiter if we can please order. Now enter SETH - the most amazing waiter I have ever had. He nicely told us that we weren't in his section but once we told him what happened he happily took our order. We received the best customer service from Seth throughout our meal. I hope management reads this. If it weren't for Seth and the delicious food and beer I would NEVER come back. Hopefully someone will read this and make sure the staff is better trained when it comes to first time customers. (There was a group next to us that experienced the same thing and we saw them reaming the hostess). It also would have been nice if the manager checked on us to make sure we were served, offered us free peanuts, anything. Other than Seth - the customer experience was the worst I've ever had."},{"name":"Du Kuh Bee","address":"12590 SW 1st St","city":"Beaverton","stars":"4","text":"What a cute little restaurant.

Today (a Wednesday) my husband called on my behalf and was told that they don't take reservations, but tonight when we saw people arriving after us seated before us my friend and I were told that those people had reservations.

Everything tasted fantastic! Each course was simple, refreshing, and had great depth in flavor.  Umi is a high-end Japanese restaurant located in the heart of Buckhead. It sets the mood for a romantic evening with dim lighting and trendy light fixtures, to match their stylish take on traditional Japanese food. \\n\\nObservations of the night:\\nWe had a reservation for 7:30pm on a Monday, and the first impression I received when we entered inside Umi was that it was loud! The amount of people crammed into the bar area/come and go eating was a bit astonishing. There was no real waiting area, so we were forced to dodge waiters and guests our entire wait. This being my first time at Umi, I asked the host if it was normally this crowded, and he found nothing extraordinary about the situation.\\nThe dining area was shielded behind a giant wall, giving me hopes of a quieter evening. After waiting 20 minutes to be seated, we were seated along the left wall, which is similar to communal style dining. There was one long booth along the wall and the only thing separating diners from one another were small tables about 2ft apart. Having a more curvaceous figure, I definitely interrupted the diners on the left of us as I attempted to wiggle into the booth. The smile and welcoming demeanor of our hostess was a wonderful distraction from the awkward seating arrangements.\\n\\nFood:\\nUmi has a vast menu which can be a bit overwhelming, but they offer combo meals chosen by the chef. There are three levels to choose from: Umi ($85), Miyabi, and Ito-Kase. The Umi is what we chose which entails: miso soup, an appetizer, sashimi, a hot dish, nigiri, and dessert. The first appetizer was a spicy tuna tartare with a slice of serrano chile on top of crispy sticky rice. The second appetizer was thinly sliced yellow tail served in olive oil, lemon, and black pepper. Our hot dishes included cod and bass served with their separate sauce. Our dessert was pannacotta served with fresh blueberries on top and a side of mochi with raspberries.\\n\\nCons:\\n-Their front door was impossible to find on our own, and the exterior is dimly lit.\\n-We waited 20 minutes for our reservation that was made days in advance. In addition, it seemed as if patrons without reservations who were regulars were seated before us. \\n-The bar area and the dining area were both unbearably loud. My boyfriend and I were yelling across the table to hear one another.\\n-They used way too much wasabi on the nigiri. It became painful at one point, and we had to remove the rice from the fish. \\n\\nPros:\\n-The fish used was incredibly fresh and treated carefully. Everything was so silky, the consistency reminded us of butter. \\n-Hot dishes were cooked perfectly and came in the most incredible sauce.\\n-The panna cotta was light, creamy and not too sweet. \\n\\nOverall: we loved the food!!! You definitely cannot find better quality seafood, however do not expect to have a in-depth conversations here, it is just too loud. Also, I do wish the bar area and waiting area was better regulated. It was a bit off putting quantity of people allowed to squish inside and the wait was also frustrating."},{"name":"Ball Square Cafe","address":"708 Broadway","city":"Somerville","stars":"4.5","text":"A legit breakfast joint.

Annoyed at having waited 45 minutes to eat, I told my server that I would skip the entree and just have dessert. He brought out the dessert and then a bill for $51.00 and another bill for $8.50. I was shocked! The manager, Vladimir, was embarrassed and apologized profusely. I had eaten nothing - the very first bite of scallops in both cases had sand - not even my dessert yet, and I was being charged $60!! Vladimir cancelled the 8.50 for dessert. The $51 was a pending charge on my card for a week before it was cancelled. My server was inattentive, and there is no excuse for how much I was charged. I am glad, though, that I spoke with the manager, who seemed to be a nice guy. I am really disappointed - people around me were eating their food, enjoying, and my server was giving a lot of attention to the other table he was serving (they had 8 men in their party, while I was dining alone, and I resent that I was not given the attention and service that I deserve).

With local heavyweights like Pattycake, Omega, Jeni's, and Mozart's all being represented at the various stands that line the walls of this enormous warehouse-like space right in the heart of downtown, it's absolutely impossible for one to not find something that hits their sweet spot here. If you get here around 11 pm on a Saturday afternoon, you're set to experience the entire spectrum of the flavors, faces, and feelings that Columbus has to offer. You'll find fixie-riding hipsters noshing on vegan pastries in one corner; you'll see a heard of businessmen doing powerlunch with sandwiches and espresso in another corner. This truly is the melting pot of Columbus. In fact, I'm pretty sure The Melting Pot might even have had a booth here at one point in time. \\n\\nFrom my personal experience here, the only vendor that i would recommend staying away from is the Thai place located near the western entrance that looks out to Park Street.

However, not because it tastes bad (because let's be real, it tastes pretty amazing), but because it makes me feel like I need to hibernate afterwards.  So overall, for college students, this is a cheap and good place to get some food for those long, late nights, but I would personally go elsewhere for a heartier meal.  \\n\\nDishes I've had are their pizza, mainly the buffalo chicken pizza, which is good and the slices are like twice the size of my face (not an exaggeration), but it's pretty oily and greasy so I'm not a fan of how that makes me feel when I'm done.  \\n\\nTheir pasta dishes are even more oily and greasy than the pizza to the point that you can feel your arteries clog a little after each bite!!!  I ordered their pesto pasta thinking that pesto would be less creamy and thick, but their pesto was pretty much the same consistency of Alfredo sauce, just with the pesto flavor.  As a huge pesto lover, that creamy pesto sauce is something I'm not a fan of.  I really don't think that's how pasta should be done.  Also, if you save the pasta and have it again later on, the separation of the amount of oil from the rest of the sauce is disheartening.  \\n\\nThey have healthier options like salads available, but after trying their other dishes, I think my inner health nut will refrain from ordering anything from IL Mondo.

It's a nice way to make friends since you are at communal tables, but not so great if you don't want to be in everyone's conversations. \\n\\nThe Really Bad:\\nIt is insanely loud inside. There is no way that you can sit in there and comfortably hold a conversation. So, you have to sit outside. Outside is divided into a Drinks Only section and a food section. As other people have mentioned, keeping people from merging into the food section is probably impossible. And, if you haven't noticed, it is hot outside. Not everyone wants to sit out there and roast while they drink. I'm sure it drives up beer sales, but it would have been nice to be able to sit inside."},{"name":"Vendetta","address":"4306 N Williams St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"This is my 1st review! Finally! I had never heard of Vendetta so I meet a friend there last last for a quick beer  before going to out to a show. Must have been an old garage turned into a trendy getaway bar that  pretty much typical design that had no identiy.  While the bar was just a bar- half packed with people enjoying each others company. I was mostly impressed with the outdoor sitting section where the we drank 8% beer underneath the heaters. I love the design of this patio and like Steve B wrote in the summer it will be hopping. It looks alot better than broken down cars in it though loose gravel could bring havoc to a sloopy lush. Didnt look at the menu for food and really didn't pay attenion to prices. For sure I would make another drive by and might even suggest having live music if the zoning allows.

They were a little over-cooked and we had trouble telling the difference between the chicken and the beef ones. The Ponce location makes them better in my opinion. I also had a mojito. Made to perfection. Most times I get the jerk chicken sandwich and fries and I can never finish them because it's so big. \\n\\nATMOSPHERE: I love the atmosphere. The lights are dimmed and there are tons of Cuban decorations scattered throughout. They also have all types of Latin American songs playing. The atmosphere is definitely authentic to the culture. \\n\\nSERVICE: Our waiter was super nice, but the service was a little slow. There weren't that many people at the location when we went so I don't understand why. Other than that, I have no complaints. He was still a very nice guy and we were a low maintenance table so he probably just lost track of us. \\n\\nPARKING: There are two parking decks nearby. We went on a Sunday so the parking was free in both of them. Im not sure about any other day or if Papi's validates, but I would call and ask before going. \\n\\nOverall I love Papi's. The food is always good. This location can accommodate big parties, and the drinks are delicious."},{"name":"Cha Yen Thai Cookery","address":"613 Mt Auburn St","city":"Watertown","stars":"4.5","text":"Soooo delicious!!!

I always order the Fancy Chicken Salad and it is always delicious and plentiful. I will continue to crave it's flavors and freshness. We also like to order the fried ravioli because the sauce is so freakin decadent. (Note: this is not an approved New Year's Resolution item.) My BF also really likes their burger. The 13 Spice Chicken was above average but nothing special. $12 taco platters just don't excite me when we live in Austin, Texas, and the rest of their menu items make me yawn.\\n\\nMy real beef with Jack Allen's is the service.

Highly recommend all of those items! We also tried the Scallops which had a great presentation, but was a little too strong on the ginger for me to love it.

It's like going to a Melting Pot and getting the cooking style that isn't the oil; cooking things in boiling broth.  I'm also a glutton, and I typically want large quantities of food to shovel into my mouth in an efficient fashion, and the general procedure of throwing things into broth, waiting for them to cook, retrieving a few bites at a time, and then repeating never sounded like a particularly efficient manner of having a gluttonous dinner.  This is also probably why I'm fat.\\n\\nAnyway, I was persuaded to give this place a whirl, and ultimately since I'd never actually went to a restaurant to have hot pot, perhaps it would be different if the majority of the work involved were cut out of the equation.  Little Sheep Mongolian Hot Pot is located on, try not to be surprised, Buford Highway; like the vast majority of successful ethnic dining establishments.  It leans a little towards the I-285 side of Buford Highway, but could be fairly easily accessed via Midtown from the Buford-Spring Connector, or getting off on one of the various exits on I-85 before you pass Spaghetti Junction.  It's located in one of the double-decker shopping plazas, on the ground level, and has a substantial amount of free parking.\\n\\nEntering the restaurant, it's not like traveling to another country, like some restaurants try to set the ambiance to eleven.  It's actually kind of an atmosphere that I'd use the word 'sterile' to describe, on account of its fairly nondescript white walls with low-effort decoration and vinyl artwork, and the chairs and tables are nothing out of the bare minimum at needing in order to serve customers.  Frankly though, stuff like ambiance and convenience are secondary factors to the important stuff, being the food.\\n\\nI'm not going to sugar coat the ordering process was a little puzzling.  The 8.5x11\\" sheet of paper consisting on all available meats, vegetables and other submerge-ables is a little overwhelming, and looks like a End User Licencing Agreement, or the monumental wall of text that 100% of people hit the OK button without reading, whenever they need to update their iTunes.  \\n\\nBasically, my girlfriend and I ended up ordering stuff that was not mentioned as being specials from the server, with a split-pot between regular broth and spicy broth, since I like spicy.\\n\\nInitial service is pretty quick, as not long after ordering, did our first cart come from the kitchen with our broth and our initial order of meats, vegetables and noodles.  Most of the meat is obviously frozen or spends some time in freezers, and sliced thinly as tissues, in order to make them efficient to cook in broth.\\n\\nThe quality of the food is perfectly fine.  Three stars and an A-OK description is more than sufficient at describing my mindset as I ate.  As I mentioned above, it's a lot of dunking, waiting, retrieving, eating a few bites, and then repeating.\\n\\nI used the term \\"initial service\\" a few sentences ago, because although the first order was pretty expedient, any subsequent orders were noticeably slower.  I get that every additional order is money out of their pockets, but dragging their feet on providing it kind of defeats the purpose of advertising \\"all you can eat.\\"  Not to say it never came, but they certainly weren't in any rush to inquire, either.\\n\\nIn the end, depending on how much you're able to order and eat, for roughly $20 a person, it's a pretty good deal.  Personally, I ended up leaving not at all full, but not quite to that satisfied rate, because frankly they're slow to take additional orders, and what they do bring seemed to get smaller and smaller.\\n\\nThree stars and A-OK hits the nail on the head as far as I'm concerned with this place.  The food is decent, the service a little slow and seemingly deliberately so, to save themselves money, and if you're goal is to NOT stuff yourself silly, this is a place to come to."},{"name":"Bao Down Gastropub + Raw bar","address":"115 2nd Avenue W","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"The food was mediocre which I can live with but what really sets this place for a 1 star is their bar/bartender.

I just thought it looked a little sloppy. \\n\\nOn another note, I went with a scoop of the triple dark chocolate chip on a sugar cone which was excellent. The mint chocolate chip was just too minty for me and that says a lot considering it's my favorite flavor!  For one scoop, it cost me $3 plus tax. It's College Park so enough said. \\n\\nThe interior is really cute and it looks like they encourage people to draw on the walls which are predominantly chalkboard.

I liked it too, but the only falafel I've had previously is what he's cooked for me, so me liking it isn't all that indicative of it being good compared to other restaurants.\\n\\nNevertheless. It was warm, tasted good, and there was more food than I could eat even though we only paid about five bucks each. Service was a little cool but not bad - she kept our water glasses full, which is a big OCD fixation of mine when dining out. And it was relaxed and casual inside. I've always thought it was a fancy place and was pleasantly surprised to find that it wasn't.\\n\\nWe plan to go back, so I'll edit this if they suck the next time we're there.

My fiance and I came to Portland and on our first full morning here, decided that we wanted to try a breakfast place that focused on local ingredients, as well as had some creativity behind their menu. After some digging through fellow yelpers, we settled on the The Original due to their Eggs and Poutine dish and our subsequent love of gravy on anything, especially at 8AM. I am pleased to say that our first experience with Portland breakfast was a positive one. Our waiter Shane was very good, and gave us some good tips on some other places to consider throughout our stay. \\n\\nI myself ordered the Eggs and Poutine, which was not on the menu, but they were extremeley accomodating and prepared it a la carte, however it did cost double what it would have when it was on the menu. The fries were crispy, the gravy was a good brown gravy that wasn't overpowering, and the cheese was the absolute star of the dish. The portion was huge, and I made sure to take the option for $4 to add a piece of chicken, which was a large fried piece that came plopped on top. My initial impression of the chicken visually was admittedly not super positive (the crisp was darker brown, which from my kitchen days usually indicated older oil), however upon first bite i realized i was wrong; the flavor was outstanding and the knife that he brought along with it was courteous but unnecessary as you could easily cut through it with a fork. \\n\\nMy fiance ordered the fried polenta with candied bacon and honey syrup. This combination of sweet and savory will absolutely be stolen and taken back to Baltimore where we will be working on the homemade version of it. I was presently surprised by the fried polenta in a cake form - think super textured grits that you can slice and smear with honey syrup before laying a piece of candied bacon on top and crunching it while you think about how you could continually do this over and over until sweet & savory induced vomiting occured, and then probably more. Definitely the absolute star of the show and I very highly recommend it. \\n\\nThe coffee was also great, albiet it 3 dollars per cup, which I do not know yet if that's par for the course in Portland, but i'm assuming so. Overall i would definitely recommend folks to check out The Original - good for the adventurous and conservative pallate alike."},{"name":"Arts At the Armory Cafe","address":"191 Highland Ave","city":"Somerville","stars":"3.5","text":"A place that supports local comedy?!

THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE AND FACIAL I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE!!\\n\\nIf I could give zero stars I would. My groupon was purchased for a Swedish massage in October that was good until January. I called yesterday (December 14 2018) to make my appointment everything was fine until I received a call a couple of hours later. Apparently they moved locations and did not offer massages anymore.  It was a red flag because they already accepted my appointment and talked about massages with me. They offered me an upgraded facial because of the inconvenience and I told them I would call back after I looked at their services because I was working. After work I called back and spoke to a manager. I told him my issue and he was no help. He tried to up charge me for a facial even after the person I spoke to earlier in the day said I could get one instead because it was an issue on their end. So I called today to see if there were any openings and I was told to come as soon as I could even if there's traffic because they could get me in. While checking in the man at the counter was telling me I was late even though HE WAS THE ONE THAT TOLD ME TO COME AS SOON AS I COULD GET THERE!!! So I asked multiple times to ensure I receiving a service at an equal value. While I was told many times I was receiving above the value, the woman doing my facial was talking prices and said my facial would be 30 dollars. So I asked and she made up an excuse and continued.  The facial was extremely basic and honestly the worst I have ever had. There were exfoliant beads left in my hair, on my neck, and on my chest.  I asked for a receipt, but their \\"printer was down\\". So I had them email it to me and it took awhile but when I got home it said the facial was 30 dollars and it should've been 60 minutes. It was definitely not 60 minutes maybe a half hour if that. They lied to me about numerous things and essentially took my money because I payed more for my groupon. I called back to ask why I was told wrong information about payment and the prices of things. The man was extremely rude and hung up on me. NEVER GO HERE.

All of the good stuff was in the middle instead of covering the entire chip spread like I would hope. The bruschetta was good; we were happy we only paid half price.

The bun to patty ratio is perfection. The beet ketchup which accompanies a side of fries is phenomenal and I think all restaurants should ditch the red sauce in lieu of the root veggie concoction. Be mindful that the burger has a pork in it, but I think that's what makes it one of the best burgers I've ever had. \\n\\nI am counting the days until crawfish season arrives. Last season, I tried  a handful of restaurants serving the seasonal mudbugs but found that Dai Due's was far superior. While many establishments are a little heavy handed with the Old Bay seasoning, Dai Due creates their own spicy blend and cautiously seasons their crustaceans.\\n\\nI've had two of their seafood Supper Club meals which is moderately priced and can easily be shared amongst three people (it's billed on the menu for two). Skip this. Visit the restaurant on a night they serve their seafood chowder. The bowl is filled with fresh seafood and topped with a slice of bread and homemade aioli that is to. die. for. Sadly, it's not offered everyday so call the restaurant before you stop in. Also, do not mistaken the seafood chowder for the oyster chowder because you will be sadly disappointed. If you accidentally order the oyster chowder, don't plan on kissing anyone unless that person loves garlic.\\n\\nDai Due has some great Happy Hours. I like to frequent the cozy restaurant during Blue Crab season when they are only $5 during HH. The mudbugs are $10/ lb during HH.\\n\\nThe seafood chowder and the burger are the reasons Dai Due gets 5 stars. While the rest of the menu is tasty, they are not as memorable nor do they hold a candle to the aforementioned dishes.\\n\\nAlso, Tracy has been our server the last three times I visited and she is wonderful.

The name of this place threw me for a loop when I first walked up, but this turned out to be the best banh mi I've had yet. Yup, white girls making Asian food really can work out great.\\n\\nI definitely didn't expect to have this experience when I walked out for lunch today. I was thinking falafel, or a burger. Sure am glad I skipped both. The aroma of sizzling meat coming through the back of this truck was intoxicating, and a quick look at their menu piqued my curiosity. It's a pretty short menu, just a few banh mi options and some rice bowls. But it all looks great. The service is really friendly too - the owners will chat you up, flatter you, and make it the most cheerful order you've ever placed. And when they get down to cooking, they're 100 percent on the money. I had the bulgogi chicken banh mi, and man, what a great choice. The flavors were intense, an almost perfect mix of salt, sweet, and spice. The chicken was tender on the inside but crispy and smoky on the outside, with only a little fat on it. The meat absorbed tons of flavor from the sauce, which was nice and tangy. And the veggies (cucumber, daikon, carrot, cilantro), which are usually just an afterthought for me, were a key part of the show. All the veggies seemed fresh, and they all made the sandwich even better when they were covered in sauce. I generally hate cilantro as a rule, but here it was a natural complement to everything else. And the jalapenos, instead of being overused, were tucked in the background to add just a little extra heat from time to time. It was all served in a giant, soft baguette that made for an amazing last few bites after all the sauce and aioli had soaked in. Simply awesome food.\\n\\nThis was definitely a quality meal. There are some complaints that it's overpriced compared to the amount of meat you get, but I didn't find this problem. The sandwich is huge, and mine had a pretty healthy amount of chicken (and more than enough flavor). Plus they offer complimentary drinks.

We figured this would happen since we were 10 minutes early. They recommended for us to order drinks while-we-wait at the extremely busy bar (left of hostess booth). Shortly after ordering a Moscow Mule (served generously with a large slice of ginger) and a Paloma, we were directed by an asian gentleman with glasses that our table was ready.\\n\\nEven at 9:30PM, the restaurant was still buzzing, couples and business partners were still being sat at tables.

We were happy with the fresh selection of nigiri, sashimi and hot dishes.\\n+ The Black Cod Misoyaki was similar what I could make at home (less sweeter) but still enjoyable.\\n+ Chilean Sea Bass Yu-an Yaki was subtle, sweet and flaky.\\n+ The Kobe-Beef Nigiri, definitely one of my favourites every time I visit.\\n+ Dessert: Chocolate Kyu (chocolate sphere with interactive mallet), Green Tea Souffl√©, pressed Lamill coffee were sold out for the night. We ordered a matcha-infused cake / brownie? This was an extra dessert on top of the desserts that were included for the Miyabi Omakase, but was a wonderful surprise. I'm a little biased because I'm matcha crazy.\\n\\nBill total was $340.00 (tips included) so prepared to spend a little more for a fantastic, memorable dinner.\\nService was wonderful and attentive.

One, the menu is more Greek-oriented than I expected from a place called Marakesh. Two, everything about it seemed to go wayyyy downhill in a very short time.\\n\\nThe first time I ate at Marakesh was for dinner, and it was marvelous. Good atmosphere and music, prompt service. I asked for mint tea, which wasn't on the menu, and the waiter (who appeared to be Middle Eastern or North African but I have no idea from which country) was very happy that I'd asked for it & went back to the kitchen, made me a pot, and brought it to the table. It was one of the best things I've ever tasted, ever. The food was also quite good, but as I am a tea freak, the mint tea is the thing that really stayed on my mind.\\n\\nThe next time I went there was for dinner again, and the service wasn't quite as good. I asked for mint tea and the waitress acted like it was a bit of a hassle & then brought me out a pot of tea decidedly inferior to that which the waiter had made for me last time. The waiter's tea actually had mint leaves in it and was already sweetened when I got it, whereas this was hot water with a mint-tea teabag in it. If I wanted inauthentic mint tea made by a grumpy chick, I would've had tea at home.\\n\\nThe third time I went there was for lunch. The atmosphere and service were both really bad. I felt like I was in the Mediterranean equivalent of Mel's Diner. I haven't been back since.\\n\\n(And by the way, Lumiere M., I have to agree -- the couscous there is just nasty.

There is a very leisurely attitude once you're in so we left about 10:15 and there were 15-20 people waiting outside in the 20 degree weather. Mike was happily chatting them up but cold is cold and waiting is waiting.\\n\\n3) The open door - In an effort to increase capacity, Ball Square patrons sit in the empty Victor's Deli next door.

The flavours are spot on. As good as butter chicken, masala [insert meat] and all the other Northern Indian food is (which can be found in abundance in Vancouver), there's something about the rawness of South Indian food that really gets my tastebuds dancing. The spices are just tangier, spicier, bigger, bolder and more. Don't need to put my finger on it, so long as I can put my tongue to it. This place gets it right. \\n\\nThe boys are also so friendly and sincere. There's nothing they won't tell you about their food. Personally, I love the Lamb Vindaloo dosa. It's what I always get - the handful of times we actually drove out here. The Vada here is also delicious. It's just not a meal without it.\\n\\nDon't be fooled by its humble decor.

The lamb roll was equally delicious, the wrap held everything in nicely and somehow these fucking wizards pressed it without wilting the lettuce and cucumber. Again, a steal for only $7.

When we were next in line, a gentleman (that wasn't the cashier) popped his head over the espresso machine to take our order, (I quite prefer this, especially when it's busy, it keeps things moving) then we continued on to the cashier to pay. We were waiting for our drinks and observing the baristas. My drink was made promptly and placed on the counter while we continued to wait for my sister's drink (a tall Caramel Macchiato). The one barista seemed new and definitely a little inexperienced. She plopped a tall sized cup on the counter and yelled out Coconut Mocha. I immediately thought that's supposed to be my sister's drink, but she must have though the CM on the cup stood for Coconut Mocha. The gentleman who took our order immediately realized the mistake and informed the barista. She then began to make the correct drink, while the gentleman brought over a coupon for a free drink to apologize for the mistake! The mistake was resolved so quickly, there was hardly a moment's worth of concern! This one gentleman was just a great employee who acted truly invested in his job!

I've gotten a few gift cards in the mail from the corporation that owns all these restaurants and to be honest, I ate for free. That, however, is completely not the point. The point is, their sushi sucks ass, plain & simple. I'm not going to dog their other food because I have not eaten any of it. I have only tried their sushi and boy oh boy is it the WORST that I have ever had, even Fred Myer's deli sushi is better than these guy's rolls. To start with, both rolls I ordered were completely devoid of flavor. I had the Hawaiian roll and the Golden California roll. The Cali roll was so bland that I had to put each piece into soy sauce just to get some flavor, when I did not use any soy I tasted something with a HINT of sweetness and nothing else. The Hawaiian had the mango on the inside of the roll when most places put it on the top of the roll, but then again, this is a seafood joint & not a sushi place so maybe they just don't know what they're doing. The tuna and the mango were both bland and I couldn't taste either one and to top it all off, both rolls were room temp. Now don't get me wrong sushi, when properly prepared by the Japanese can be served at room temp and be outrageously wonderful. But definately NOT this stuff. Now enough of my bitching.

Stortini's calzone was a lot closer to Leo's than to Pizza Hut. The presentation impressed me, first of all.  The calzone, was  pre-sliced and served on a metal stand. I think this helps maintain a proper crust texture, and it definitely looks neat.  The crust was fresh and toasty, overflowing with delicious, melty cheese, fresh spinach, and pepperoni.  The dipping sauce had a great flavor, like fresh tomatoes with just a hint of sweetness. The pepperoni tasted kind of like the Hormel stuff I bought at Randall's one time, but the overall meal was really excellent.  Plus, it was huge.  I ate about one third of it before asking for a box. My server kindly boxed the food for me, even putting the sauce in its own container and labeling the top of the box \\"Calzone, 8/5.\\" I appreciated that extra effort and thoughtfulness, especially because at the beginning of my meal, the server was borderline neglectful. The greet time after I sat down was close to 10 minutes, and our first interaction was pretty short and to the point. I only saw 2 servers on duty in the whole dining area, and I did arrive at noon, so perhaps eating at an off peak time would result in more personal service. The server did bring me a particularly large basket of bread.  Unfortunately, the bread failed to impress me and the butter was nearly frozen. As others have noted, the bread isn't anything special. Try not to fill up on it! \\n \\nI hadn't read the reviews before coming here, so I didn't know what to expect as far as atmosphere. I found Stortini clean and interesting, though not particularly warm or inviting.  The ceiling is sky blue; the walls, white with dark brown trim; the booths, a matching dark brown; the floor and front door red.  Two large, picture windows give the dining area an abundance of light (along with a view of a street and some parking lots). A line of chandeliers provide additional light, some visual interest, and a bit of formality.  White table cloths and fresh flowers on each table also add a touch of class. A variety of shapes and sizes of mirrors hang on the walls, making the space seem slightly larger but still impersonal. The hard floors and open dining area resulted in a slightly loud atmosphere, but this might be different at dinner if more couples and fewer large groups are dining.\\n\\nHere's a tip-- get a reservation.  I read 45 pages of a sci-fi novel while waiting at Stortini.  Part of that time was waiting for a table, part was waiting for food, but nevertheless, I got a pretty good chunk of text finished before I got some grub. If that's your thing, cool, but if you're on your lunch hour, call ahead."},{"name":"Karam Lebanese & Syrian Cuisine","address":"316 SW Stark St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Disclosure:  This was my first time eating Lebanese food.

The best choice award goes to my girlfriend who ordered the meat mezza. The waiter must have gone back to the kitchen three times in order to bring out all the food that came with her $14 order. A little of this and a little of that, she had chicken, beef, falafel, hummus and some of the best pita I've ever had.\\n\\nI'd have to recommend ordering the meat mezza, yet her sister got the chicken feta which you wouldn't regret stuffing your pita hole with either.\\n\\nThe wait staff is very friendly (if not a wee bit hard to understand) and the service was rather prompt for how busy they were New Years' eve. \\n\\nThe bathroom is shared with a restaurant next door and is pretty dank.

I'm still craving them! Seasoned fries, a great, meaty chili, covered in a white cheese sauce. These beat out their   Poutine no questions asked. \\n\\nThe Bad:\\n1) To me, the sausages tend to err to the bland side. The ideas behind the sausage are really unique, but there is something lacking in the final product. The last time I was here I got the Smokey and the Boar sausage- plain, to really get the gist of the meat. It was a good blend of meat, smooth and not gamey. But really, really dry. I know boar meat is incredibly lean, but a dry sausage isn't really satisfying. \\n\\n2) There is no consistency to the \\"heat\\" of the sausages. Some are labeled/implied as being spicy, and at any given day, the same sausage will range from being tolerable to caustically hot. The waiter we had even commented on this phenomenon. My boyfriend had the Louisiana Lightning sausage which is listed as made with Cajun spices. He liked the sausage at first, but a few bites into it, it became so hot he could hardly eat it. But he did (of course). The guest we had with us had the same sausage and was in the same amount of pain as my boyfriend. Both of these guys are no spice-virgins, so this was a buzzkill for my boyfriend. For the REST OF THE WEEKEND, my boyfriend was laid up in the bathroom bemoaning the overload of cayenne in the sausage.

First off, our server, Kim, was absolutely wonderful. She was the nicest, most helpful server I have had at any restaurant in recent memory. She must have worked there for years to be as knowledgeable about Houston's as she was. If it wasn't for her I would have given Houston's probably only 1 star. The following is the reason I left that restaurant not fully satisfied. My wife had ordered the steak Diane medium well and it came out a little bit too pink so we politely asked the server if she could have the chef put it on the grill a little longer. So as she was taking the plate back, this lady with a Puerto Rican accent quickly came up to her and was treating her as if it was her fault the steak wad undercooked, when in reality she had nothing to do with that, it was the chef. This lady started yelling at our server because of this and it made us very uncomfortable. We felt horrible that out server was being yelled out because our steak was undercooked; again there was nothing she could have done about that. But I started watching that person who had been doing the yelling more and I became disgusted with how she treated her employees. Just in the hour we were eating there, she must've yelled, very loudly and rudely that I am sure the entire restaurant must've heard her, at different servers 5-10 times. I am writing this review because I was sickened by the way she was treating all her employees. It was the worst display of a \\"power trip\\" I have ever seen. I do not usually review restaurants, but I could not let this go. I asked the hostess when we left her name so I could document it with this complaint. Her name is Natalia and apparently she is the general manager. I refuse to eat at that restaurant ever again as long as she is in charge there. I am hoping one of the owners of this Houston's will read this and do something about it. It left me in complete shock. Never in my life have I seen someone treat other people he or she was working with with such detest. This woman should be fired so she can never treat those poor servers that badly again. She made me incredibly uncomfortable by yelling and treating her coworkers so badly and there is no way I am the only one who thinks this way. I saw other people eating around us look up when she would start one of her rants and take all her energy out on these poor defenseless servers. I do not know how they can put up with her.

Good beer choices and a full bar.  The only complaint I have is the wine menu. Winchester is a town with many wine drinkers and the choices are standard low quality wines. With the many low cost options available for drinkable wine, they could find reasonably priced wines of better quality. I know they are addressing improvements all the time.\\nThe menu is good with many daily specials.

After we finally ordered our wine a large group sat down next to us and ordered a few bottles for the table, she brought those right out and quickly attended to them.

But every time she would come to the table she was rude, and short and would leave the table before we could ask for anything she was gone. Once we tried to stop her and she gave us the \\"one second\\" finger and she kept walking. Not to mention all night we had to deal with her... she decided after the party got up that she was going to stand right in front of us and count her tips blocking the show. Then she started stacking chairs around us making me feel like I was being rushed out and the show wasn't even over. I could not believe how this night went. After paying 70 dollars for a ticket to a show, I would expect to be taken care of at the table like any other high dollar restaurant in the area. This girl was the absolute worst and I won't be coming back. The girls at the door seating we're talking and laughing and chatting while people were standing waiting to be sat or shown where to go. At the end of the night the hostess at the computer had her music playing pretty loud. Totally unprofessional.

It was moist and light and the frosting was very tasty as well, not too sweet. Both my friend and I were literally trying to eat the cupcake paper, to get the remaining crumbs off, YES that good!  Then we were off to SV2. They have a great, attentive male staff (not to mention, quite attractive:); however we did have to search for our waiter at one point. Had the Pocket Gyro with the thinly sliced Kalebone roast, which was very flavorful; I would never mistake it for meat, but it is very tasty and not being a vegan I would still eat all the time! The cucumber sauce was amazing! The flavor of garlic and cucumber were perfectly matched and really made the gyro. Only complaint was there was too much sauce, so the pita began to get very soggy. I couldn't finish all of mine, but they gave me an extra pita to take home. My friend had the same as well as the BBQ tofu, which was lacking flavor, taste like sauce was just poured on top, but will definitely return!"},{"name":"Tan Tan Cafe & Delicatessen","address":"316 SE 123rd Ave, Ste A3","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Pho #1 avocado shake with bubbles = good and full-filling, thanks guys!"},{"name":"BaRa Sushi House","address":"2625 SE 21st Ave, Unit B","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Fantastic sushi bar.

I have always been a fan of Panara bread, their mission and their product etc. Since they just opened up a month ago they still need time to work out their kinks.  We came here on a Sunday night. We were greeted a the front counter by a person who seem to be having a bad day. We were the only patrons in line to place an order so I am not sure what the problem was. Customer service should always be jovial and attentive even if a person doesn't feel like coming to work that day. The floor plan is a little confusing as the window where one picks up their order is down the hallway. A most unusual floor plan. It is a good thing that they now offer a buzzer that rings when your order is ready. I ordered the hummus chicken salad.  It was good it would have been better if an additional salad dressing was offered. The hummus by itself just wasn't cutting it. The broccoli and cheese soup was good but it was served just warm and not piping hot. Mr.mr. loved his mac & cheese and he says he would order it again. He also enjoyed his mozzarella and tomato flatbread. I like how they have sort of sectioned off areas. This would be ideal to bring small groups of 15-20 for a working lunch or a book club meet up.  I would imagine it would be pretty easy to reserve a one of the many sectioned off areas. I like the indoor fire place feature and that they have and packets of fancy spiced mustard and hot sauce.

He told me of a tiny restaurant in Marblehead owned by a man who reminds him of Jiro, named Junji, that serves up wicked fresh and wicked tasty sushi.\\n\\nJohn took me to this restaurant last night, and it was incredible. Junji is, in fact, a tiny restaurant, very quiet, and sparsely decorated. I felt most comfortable speaking softly, almost at a whisper, with John for the duration of our dinner, and the restaurant was less than half full on this particular Saturday night. \\n\\nWe ordered the miso, uni nigiri, baby octopus, monkfish liver in ponzu, 5-piece nigiri omakase, negihama maki, negitoro maki, and green tea tempura ice cream. Aside from the waitress never bringing to us our miso, and the marinated tuna, seabream, and squid nigiri being quite tasteless, I had some of the best sushi of my life last night. I never expected to have such a life-changing experience in a ex-sub-shop in Marblehead, MA, but here we are.\\n\\nThe baby octopus was the first dish to be served. (2 babies for each of us). I had a good feeling about Junji as soon as I tasted this. It was a flavor explosion of octopus, sauce, and sesame oil -- a wonderfully delicious start to our meal.\\n\\nThe negihama maki and uni nigiri came next. The first bite of negihama I took, I think my eyes rolled into the back of my head, and I remember thinking, \\"I DO NOT want this bite to end!\\" The hamachi and green onion combo was the most intense I've ever had in a negihama roll, so I took care to slowly savor the other 2 pieces. Minimal wasabi and soy sauce needed. I'm not a huge fan of uni, but I it tasted was I anticipated -- like sea urchin innards.\\n\\nWhile browsing the menu before we began our meal, John mentioned that he wanted to try a selection of the chef's selection. We didn't want to go crazy and order the full omakase since we wanted to try other dishes, so we decided the 5-piece was a good compromise. It consisted of marinated tuna, jack, madai (seabream), squid, and black cod. We were somewhat surprised by the mild flavor of the tuna (maguro), especially considering it was marinated, but mildness is kind of to-be-expected from seabream and squid. I would definitely come back to order the jack and black cod nigiri, separate from an omakase.\\n\\nWe weren't quite full at this point, so we perused the menu and added the monkfish liver and negitoro maki. These dishes were both excellent. The monkfish liver was a pleasant surprise. I was expecting it to be good, based on the recommendation of another Yelper, and I wasn't disappointed --  it was light but fishy, liver-like but not dry. The negitoro was kind of a no-brainer. Who would turn down fatty tuna? I usually prefer maguro over toro, but I was really glad John suggested we order this. It was amazing. Honestly, this roll and the negihama, with a small pat of wasabi soy sauce...that's all I need in life.\\n\\nI can't believe we had room for dessert, but Japanese food usually isn't very filling. The dessert menu offered ice cream, mochi ice cream, ice cream served tempura style, and a homemade flan. We shared the green tea ice cream served tempura style, and it turned out to be a larger serving than I was expecting. A giant ball of tempura-battered fried ice cream cut in half and topped with whipped cream and a maraschino cherry. It was a great ending to a great meal. \\n\\nTL;DR\\nTry the negihama and negitoro maki, baby octopus, jack and black cod nigiri, and monkfish liver.

The salmon was way overdone and there was a thin layer of charcoal to the top of everything. When I got into it the dish was very tasty. I typically judge French cuisine by their cassoulet or their bouillabaise and I look forward to being able to dip the bread into the sauce at the bottom of the pot/pan/skillet.

He insisted I owed $10.89 and didn't understand what the coupon meant. Nor did he seek help from his co-workers.

She honored the coupon and said it wasn't my fault it printed wrong (WHAT PRINTED WRONG FOR THE LOVE OF JEEBUS!?!?!?). \\n\\nSo that was obnoxious. And then to boot, I got the pizza home and it was not well made. There were random other toppings mixed in our order, and the pizza fell apart. I mean, took a bite and everything slid off.

For my other 1/2 I got the Broccoli Beer Cheese Soup (which comes in a bread bowl). Now this was interesting as the soup is infused with Shiner Rock. Good flavor - definitely unique!

So what I'll say about the service is simply this: despite the speed of service (which I blame entirely on the atypical circumstances), the quality of service was excellent.  Our server, a tall guy with short spiky hair, had to check with the kitchen about five different times for us (does this have nuts in it? what about this, does the batter have cornmeal in it?) and did so cheerfully.\\n\\nLet's talk about the food.  The vanilla maple bread pudding we \\"shared\\" was so delicious that we'd be missing limbs if those spoons had been sharp.  My quesadilla was pretty good (I went with the boring old cheese option), and I could have eaten a pint of that pico de gallo with a half-pint of guacamole.  The grilled cheese was bland, but how exciting do you expect grilled cheese to be? It's probably for the kiddos, who wouldn't appreciate fresh jalape√±os in their dinner.  And for a menu price of $5, a grilled cheese and a side of fries is pretty darn affordable. The brisket, I'm told, was absolutely delicious.\\n\\nWould we come back at full price?  Yeah, probably.

As it turns out, there was a UT Football game that I hadn't even thought about, and plenty of people seem to be aware that this place is awesome to watch games at. A ton of fun, even though I typically shy away from game-watching bars when I'm not personally invested in watching the game.\\n\\nWe hit the standard: chili. I went with the popular Spicy Chili, and my comrade went with the Black Bean chili. Both were superb. A close call for mine, because I went at the Jalapenos with reckless abandon before ever giving the chili a taste, and DAMN it was hot. A subtle reminded that I am, after all, white. So, to soothe the palate, I went with some water *ahem* Tecate and lime, and all was well. We ripped through 2 baskets of crackers, and the small was plenty to fill me up.\\n\\nThe joint itself is really ragtag looking, but it's oozing with character. Featured in a movie, I can see just why. A thorough beer selection (no lonestar, for those who might even consider it beer), and lots of options food-wise, meat and sans-meat. Overall, a fun experience, and definitely worth hitting up for a game. Just be prepared to sit in traffic after you eat because everyone and their mom takes 15th street to get home after a game (if it's played in Austin, that is).\\n\\nCan't wait to go back and try some of their other stuff, and once again, mind your heritage and choose the level of spice accordingly."},{"name":"QDOBA Mexican Eats","address":"1956 N High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"I like this Qdoba more than the Chipotle further south down high street.

The best thing I can say about Du Kuh Bee is their service is great. These are the hardest working people in the business.\\nThe place is a hole in the wall but that doesn't bother me. What bothers me was the prices for the quantity and quality of food served. It was prepared fine but I have a major complaint with the very hard squid in my spicy squid noodles which was the most expensive item on the menu at $14. I know Korean food as being large quantities, served very hot, very edible and reasonably priced. This has not been the case here. It is however a good place to eat good food. I recommend you get the spicy BBQ pork plate as an appetizer (because it is an appetizer size but priced as an entree at $8) and get the veggie noodles for $8 because adding the meats to this dish adds only cost to the dish without adding any value to the flavor. Just take a pass on the $4 dumplings, their just frozen store bought and boiled, save your $4 for some beer. I will say that the Hite beer is really good but at $6 for a big bottle I felt a bit high because let's face it this is a 'HOLE in the WALL' Things are supposed to be cheaper than a nicer restaurant. I have to give them equal $'s to stars because to get the same amount of food as a regular Korean restaurant you have to spend 1 1/2 times as much $.  Two beers an appetizer and an entree cost me $34 and after tip I was $40 shy and still a bit hungry.
