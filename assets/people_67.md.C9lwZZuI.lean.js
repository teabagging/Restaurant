The Enchiladas were so good that I ended up ordering the Enchiladas Rojas as well. This one was slightly different, it came with a spicy red sauce and feta cheese. On this order I switched the Chicken for Beef and also added a side of guacamole. The guac was so tasty and fresh, I wonder if they sell it?! If they do I would totally buy it! I absolutely loved both orders of the Enchiladas, they were so rich in flavour. You could really tell that they use quality ingredients!\\n\\nThey really don't mess around here. The authenticity and food quality is top notch! I absolutely love Mexican cuisine and they did NOT disappoint.

Get there early (7 or before during the weekdays) if you don't want to wait but if you do have to wait the bar area is a great place to grab a drink.  I'm a martini drinker and the martinis are always perfectly chilled with a thin layer of ice floating on top.  \\nFood:  Appetizer - I recommend the tuna tartar which i believe is the best in Austin.   Entree - I enjoy the sea food mixed grill but the pizzas, seafood stew and short ribs are all great choices too.  Dessert - I always order the blackberry zeppoli for dessert which is basically 3 cake style cinnamon sugar donuts with blackberry puree in the middle and is also served with vanilla gelato... yum so delicious.  \\n\\nOn top of the delicious food and romantic ambiance Vespaio is located on South Congress, one of the last neighborhoods that still has the Austin original feel and is also located across the street from the historic Continental Club.  \\n\\nHere is the website: www.austinvespaio.com"},{"name":"Mike's Pastry","address":"300 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"yeah, this place is worth the hype...and the wait. best cannoli I've ever had. our group sampled 8. the pistachio was very good. plain ricotta was a winner. they didn't skimp on the chocolate with any of our choices that included it. for about $3 a piece, I'd definitely consider this a good deal. be prepared for the lines, and bring cash."},{"name":"Parma Trattoria & Mozzarella Bar","address":"1132 W Dillon Rd","city":"Louisville","stars":"4.5","text":"Oh so good!.

The global small plates were nearly universally successful - our only miss was the overly salty and spicy poke - and were big enough that each person got a good sampling of each dish. We spent about $150 for 4 people, which is pretty good for a Saturday night out a trendy new place.\\n\\nOur favorites were the lamb bacon lettuce wraps, the matzo ball ramen, the short rib tacos, the fluke ceviche and the matcha profiteroles. I don't love lamb but the combo of crispy, thick bacon, tomato jam, pickled onions and (I think) red pepper/cheese dip made for an amazing wrap. The matzo ball ramen was super comforting and I liked that they gave us four small bowls and chopsticks so we could share (we got the full portion). The short rib was fatty in the best way; it melted in your mouth with every bite you took. The fluke ceviche was light and bright and a great way to kick off the meal. The matcha profiteroles were a revelation. Dessert is often a letdown at restaurants, so to get four sizeable profiteroles filled with matcha ice cream that actually tasted like matcha, all drenched in a strong dark chocolate sauce, was absolutely amazing. \\n\\nAs I said, the poke is the only thing I wouldn't order again, but there were also a few dishes that were good but not amazing. I was really excited to see manti, Turkish dumplings, on the menu. But they were bigger than the ones I'm used to and not served with as much yogurt and oil, so they weren't my favorite. We also got a kale dal dish that tasted good but didn't quite compare to some of the highlights. \\n\\nI'd love to come back and try the rest of the extensive menu, especially the burger that people rave about. \\n\\nService was friendly and consistent all night. Our water was refilled often but not in an intrusive way, and we got clean plates in the middle of the meal, which I appreciated. The only little miss was not getting small plates for our profiteroles at the end, which definitely needed them because they were pretty melty and messy, but our waitress quickly remedied that.  \\n\\nFair warning, though: This place is dark and loud. We weren't the only table that broke out our phone flashlights to look at the menu, and we definitely felt like we were shouting at each other to have a conversation."},{"name":"Austin's Pizza South Lamar","address":"1817 S Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"Someone from the establishment reached out shortly after I posted my intital review and expressed her concern regarding the condition of the bathroom.

And with the nice, warm weather we had on Monday, my girlfriend and I, both being hungry and not wanting to stay inside decided to take the car across the river from Cambridge to Brookline. We parked on Harvard street, a couple of blocks down and walked over under a bright, warm sunshine on a very pleasant afternoon.\\n\\nWe stepped in the place around 1:25pm, the nearing end of the lunch rush and service and we were lucky enough not to have to wait for a table. We were promptly greeted and seated on the right side of the restaurant, on a clean table. The tables on both of our sides were busy and the atmosphere was quite nice. The place has dark tones but they get a lot of natural lighting in there; a very pleasant contrast... It balances out quite well.\\n\\nWe were served matzo bread with fresh, herb cream cheese which was smooth and delicious, and most likely homemade. It's the first time I've had such a thing served to me in a deli or restaurant as a freebie and I found that pleasant and original. It was tasty too.\\nWe decided to share the BBQ brisket quesadilla to start; they arrived all warm and gooey, filled with delicious, tender pieces of brisket with a rich, smoky flavor. We quickly cleaned up the four pieces and were already feeling pretty full and guilty. But then our entrees arrived; the misses had a cob salad while I ordered a corned beef sandwich on challah bread. She enjoyed her salad but I was a tad disappointed with the corned beef. The cheese and the meat were both very, very dry and although the meat was tender it wasn't even remotely close to being as good as the deli I hit up in New-York a couple of weeks earlier in Rye, New-York. I was stunned as I had high expectations but will try it again just to make sure that it could have been a bad \\"batch\\" just in case. I still ate it and enjoyed it, but wasn't as happy with it as I could have been. The pickle with it was good.\\n\\nThen came the bill... it was a tad higher than it could have been in my opinion but being in Brookline I guess the prices automatically are higher than if it would have been in another location. The service was efficient although the guy did forget about us completely for about 15 minutes as we waited with our empty plates for a sign of life and the bill. I will most likely return here at some point although I really want to try out this place in Cambridge/Somerville called S&S to see if their corned beef sandwiches are better.

Quick tips - they don't take reservations, so if you're coming on a busier night or an evening during the weekend, be prepared for a small wait. Depending on what time you come, you can either walk around the market (they'll take your phone number and text you when your table is ready), grab a drink at the bar, or - if you're there later at night - you might be able to listen to a live band they have on stage. My group of 6 waited for about an hour and twenty minutes before we were seated for dinner on a Friday evening. Wait time might be less if you choose to sit outside! \\n\\nThe food, like many of Ford Fry's other restaurants, is delicious. I tried the guacamole, parilla mixta and margarita de la casa. The guacamole was good - it just tasted extremely fresh and simple, without a lot of other flavor tones (like lime juice or cilantro or onions) - the avocados were chunky and the most prominent flavor/texture in the appetizer. Every table also gets 2 different salsas (a green and red) along with 2 different types of tortilla chips (a regular and puffy/fried), so you get a good amount of variety at the start of your meal. For the main entree, I ordered the parilla mixta - the mixed fajita dish that comes with wood-grilled chicken, skirt steak and carnitas. This is a filling option, so I'd definitely suggest splitting the dish with another person. The meat and charred onions is served on a skillet with small cups of guacamole, salsa fresca, a frothy flavored butter, tortillas, rice and beans. I like this mixed option because it gives you a little taste of every meat they offer on the fajitas menu - my two favorites were probably the carnitas and steak. The chicken was good, but I feel like chicken can only go so far in a dish when it's served in grilled strips. The steak was super tender and flavorful (skirt steak marinated and grilled right!). But the highlight of the meal was probably the carnitas, their twice-cooked pork belly. The meat will melt in your mouth! I'm not an avid eater of pork meat (I'm more of a beef person), but I loved their carnitas dish; definitely a specialty here.

They have a good amount of parking and even have a shuttle to the place. When you get closer, you can see that this place is huge. I didn't even get to the brewery side. The wait is long so plan ahead. You can not call ahead, it's first come first serve, so just know you will be hanging out before being seated (they have a bar, gift shop-very cute, must go in and check out all the stuff, and brewery so this is ok) however, no food is served at the bar. Wish they had at least some munches like chips and salsa or something while you have a drink. But anyways, so when you walk up, they have staff everywhere so you can ask questions and they reach out to help guide you. You get in line to make a reservation which they take on iPads and then wait until you get a text telling you to go to the hostess desk to be seated. We were seated outside and it was hot for awhile, but it is nice that they do everything they can to block the sun for you. We sat down and ordered drinks. The Oasis Daydreamer was amazing. Would reorder in a heartbeat. And you get to keep the glass. Our waiter (Blake) was amazing and even brought us clean glasses at the end so we could take them home and not have them sticky from our drinks. When we ordered, Blake was more than helpful as we tried to find out what we wanted to eat. He told us everything that was amazing and it sure lead us into making the right decision. Some have said that the food is not that great. This made me skeptical about staying for dinner, but I think it's really you just need to know what is good to order and what is just sub-par. My friend got the bbq brisket sandwich and I had the shrimp tacos. Both were good and I would order them again. The shrimp was cooked perfect and had good flavor. As for the view, it was amazing. It lived up to the talk. After the sun goes down, the weather is perfect. You could see the owners house from where we were sitting. Our waiter also was very awesome at informing us about the area (about the owner) which was nice to hear about since we knew nothing about the place.

Yes, I do enjoy Japanese food, especially hibachi as well as sushi.

I do have to say that for the price, Urban Hibachi isn't bad. \\n\\nAs a few other reviewers have noted, the portions are definitely huge. We decided to get sushi as an appetizer and then each ordered hibachi dinners and it was certainly more than enough food for two people. That being said, my food tasted fresh and delicious, and for some reason I distinctly remembered the oil that they cooked the vegetables and noodles in tasting incredible. The sushi that we ordered was tasty as well, but in all fairness I also have to note that the roll we ordered was pretty basic, and in the future I would love to try out some of their specialty rolls. \\n\\nAs far as the atmosphere is concerned, the bright colorful lights and modern furniture give Urban Hibachi an enjoyable feel. My one complaint would probably be that the restaurant itself is small, and the tables definitely seem packed in tight. If you go to Urban Hibachi for dinner, I would suggest arriving early due to this. Also, I do distinctly remember that the night we tried out Urban Hibachi, our waitress was difficult to get ahold of...it seemed as if she was serving almost every table in the restaurant, which for a Friday night is definitely a deal breaker. \\n\\nBecause of this bad service, I am giving Urban Hibachi 3 stars for the moment rather than 4.

Arrived @4, wait time was 45 min to an hour for outside. No problem, we walked around to the shops and killed some time. It was starting to get a little cold, so we decided to change to inside. We got seated right away on the second floor by the window. There were plenty of tables open outside, and the inside was mostly empty. We waited about 10 minutes for a server, and ordered everything. Drinks came, good margaritas, food took another 40 minutes, and this is where the regrets really begin. The seafood enchilada with crawfish cream sauce was more like a cream cheese and spinach dip wrapped in a tortilla with shrimp and sauce on top. Sadly, the cream cheese was clumpy and slightly congealed because it used to be hot (maybe) but it wasn't anymore.   Also, no evidence of any seafood in the enchilada, just some sad shrimp hitching a ride on top. What I really want to know, do they use Philadelphia cream cheese, or is it the H-E-B brand?  The combo fajita was a complete dud, it came out on a semi hot fajita skillet, and there was no sizzle, just meat and veggies on a skillet,  might as well have been on a paper plate. And finally the fish tacos. Uninspired, and only memorable because the fish was also semi hot and for some reason it was loaded with  chopped hot peppers. I don't like to complain about food, but we mentioned the issue to the server and he didn't have much of a response. We ate around what we could, paid and left. When we left, the second floor inside and outside were nearly empty, and there were still people being told 30-45 min for seating.

Slick in design with modern lighting and exposed beams over distressed floors and dark woods it was with good coffee unfortunately reliant on an overburdened bartender/server for refills that I began and with an order substantially delayed for the same service reasons it was with good fortune that Austin's free WiFi kept me occupied through a nearly hour long period of blaring noise and a door repeatedly bumping my seat before food arrived, the resulting plates largely justifying the wait, if not the seat.  Starting savory before trending sweet it was with the three meat plate that my tasting kicked off and although brisket was dry and muddled with sugar both the pork options were quite good - the aromatic pulled version in particular when taken bite for bite with the best mac n' cheese I experienced in the state.  Moving next to the French Toast, a buttery crisp block of brioche resting in a golden pool I personally would have preferred the bread sliced slightly thinner or further infused with custard but featuring top quality berries and pure maple syrup this was a small quibble, the result good enough to sell me on a seemingly similar dessert that improved on the concept in every fashion with the same bread base completely saturated with butter wrapped around toasted pecans and baked to molten before being doused in lightly peppered caramel and crowned with a ball of smooth citrus; a multitude of discrepant flavors proving to be one of the most dynamic takes on the rustic dessert that I've had to date."},{"name":"Mother‚Äôs Bistro & Bar","address":"121 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Awesome place and food..!!

My office is up the road and I saw via Yelp you could do an online order for pickup via GrubHub. Amazing! Put in my order and immediately ran to my car to go pick it up. Now, I have been to Ola Poke several times before, at this exact location. I have never used their online ordering platform partners, today was the first. Any time I have ordered from this location, my poke is served in the large clear bowl, comes with a top and all. Today when I picked up my order, it was in a much smaller black bowl, I noticed it immediately. If you look at the bowl sizes in the pictures, you'll notice they are different in size. I didn't have time to question so I grabbed it and left. But when I got back to my office, it was very obvious the portion sizes are different. When I went into the restaurant to pick up my order, I noticed others in there with the regular, clear bowl. So I am not sure if this is a common practice for them to utilize a smaller bowl for online ordering/delivery? I would assume it's because any time you use a service for online ordering/delivery they take a commission from the restaurant, so the restaurant is making up for it in serving smaller portions?

I know that after I take the food I wait no longer than 2 minutes to return and ask if everything is tasting alright and If I could get anything for you. When he did come though he asked is everything okay? When he clearly saw my cup was empty. I needed a refill for like 5 minutes!

It was Sarah's second Mother's Day and I wanted to take her some place special for Mother's Day breakfast.  I had heard other people talk about Mother's so I figured...sure why not.  Being at breakfast with the family was awesome...sadly my choice of breakfast that morning paled in comparison.  Let's just say I recommend staying away from the Migas...and no that isn't a dirty Mexican word used to refer to a selection on the menu...that's really what it's called.  For those of you who do like it...sorry if I offended you.  It just isn't for me I guess.  \\n\\nAnyhow, I refused to give up on Mother's because I had read so many good things about it and although my first attempt resulted in a fail for tummy satisfaction...the second time around was light years beyond that first visit.  I had the stuffed fritatta and...WOAH!  Someone had the bright idea of taking what breakfast should be...bacon, eggs, cheese, potatoes and morphing it into something bodacious and topping it with sour cream and green onions.  Very niiice!  I could have that again and again and again.  To drink, Mother's proudly serves Stumptown coffee and has a varied selection of blends.  I am a Stumptown fiend because of Mother's.  Thank you Mom for turning me on to a new kind of crack.  The Ethiopian blend is delightful.  All in all, this second experience was more like a rave for my taste buds compared to the chaperoned middle school dance they had suffered through on the first visit.  If I just stay away from the Migas I believe all will be well going forward.  \\n\\nOn another visit, I had the breakfast nachos...again with a French press of one of the addictive Stumptown selections.  I think this time around it was the Guatemalan.  I could be mistaken but anyhow the nachos were simply home fries topped with cheese, onions, bacon, sour cream, and little bit of love...because Mother made it (sorry, had the urge to throw in a little extra dash of cheesiness).  It was simple...and simply delicious!  If you haven't guess by now I am very much a fan of meat, cheese, and potatoes with my morning coffee.  Actually, I'm a fan of meat, cheese, and potatoes anytime of the day with or without coffee.  \\n\\nTo sum it up, Mother's has a varied menu that is likely to please all or at least most of you.  We haven't tried lunch there yet, but that's just because breakfast is sooo good.  The service there has always been awesome with each of our visits.  I do recommend planning ahead and making reservations especially if it'll be your first visit.  I find the wait to be a deal breaker for some especially if it's their first time trying a food joint.  Always reserve when and where you can.  This place is also awesome for kids.

Then ordered the vegan square meal and vegan version of the high street veggie pizza. Then went to go sit outside (you seat yourself) was given a tracker. Didn't take long to get my drink then my pizza came. I thought hmm they have vegan cheese kool then I smelled it and knew it had at least parmesan cheese on it. A different waiter almost walked past me and I stopped him to say this is not vegan and he took my pizza. He left behind food that was in a bowl didn't know if it was mine and didn't know it was vegan or not. It took them 7 minutes to bring out the vegan pizza and asked now then waitress what the bowl was and it was mine and if it was vegan. She said she didn't know and asked who was my waiter and I said I didn't know they didn't introduce themselves. So she went back got a new waiter to come out and he said I don't know if it's vegan you have to move the beans to see if there's sour cream there, and there wasn't. He then apologize for the inconvenience and left. No other waitress or waiter came to my table to check on my food. I had to wait ten minutes once I was done to wave down another new waiter to get me boxes for my food, who he told another waiter to get because he couldn't find whose food he was carrying belong to. The waiter gave me the boxes then left and had to wait for him to come back to tell him he forgot to give me a bag.

The tempura battered fish tacos weren't something I'd typically order at a Ming Tsai restaurant, but again I was not let down.

We arrived around 9:15 with the hope that we would land a couple of seats at the bar and the ability to hear the live music that would be playing upstairs.  In about 5 minutes, mission accomplished.  Chris, our bartender, was awesome.  We told him we weren't hungry enough to order everything we wanted to try, and he suggested we order the 1 meat plate from the bar menu with a side order of another meat and another side.  It was the perfect amount.  We ordered the 1 meat plate with brisket, slaw and collards, a side order of the hot link (1 link), and a side order of the brussel sprouts.  \\n\\nThe brisket came with 2 slices of lean and 2 pieces of \\"moist\\".  The lean will never be my favorite at any restaurant, but Lambert's does it just fine.  The moist pieces were very nice and the standout on the plate, IMO.  Next time, I would just ask for the moist pieces.\\n\\nThe hot link was very well done with the heat coming slowly and building gradually.\\n\\nOf the sides (slaw, collards, and brussel sprouts), the brussel sprouts were the most complex and interesting.  They do have some spice, so if you're sensitive to spice at all, you may want to order something else.  I would have preferred them to be just a touch more cooked as the size (the sprouts were rather large) made chewing just a tad arduous.  The collards were very very good, and the slaw is always nice as a palate cleanser.\\n\\nLambert's, to me, is about the entire experience.  It provides a slice of Austin in one location between the ambience, the music, the food, and the topnotch service.

It's alright for pub grub for after class when all the other sit down places on campus is closed.  Their basics (yam fries, nachos) are above average.  But when you factor in price, I'd drop it down a star.  \\n\\nSome reviewers have commented on the waitreses and the skirts they wear.  It's nothing anyone really noticed or talked about from UBC.  For instance, no one has ever said to me, \\"Hey, let's go to Mahoney's, there are hot girls there.\\"  It's not that type of place at all, this place survives largely on it's central location on campus, and the fact that it's the only non-fast food place that's consistently open after 7pm that doesn't require a good knowledge of UBC to find.  That's really why people go here, because they're too lazy to hop on the 99 to 4th ave or Kits for 10 minutes.   \\n\\nMight just be because in Vancouver, it seems like every bar/lounge/pub tries to hire waitresses in their twenties that dress to a strict dress code.  Combine the fact that I'm guessing all of the waitresses go to UBC, where there's a high amount of attractive, fit girls, it could appear to international students or to out-of-towners to be weird.  \\n\\nThis place is overpriced.  If you just want a late night drink, the gallery is a way better deal (though they have far less food options, it's of no worse a quality).  \\n\\nAlso, Mahoney's is almost never packed unless it's super sunny and everyone is out on the deck.  It can get busy on Thursday nights but I've never had trouble finding a seat.   It's not even really a \\"fun\\" pub considering it's great location.

We were the only people sitting outside and the girl was slow! She brought our drinks and then didnt come back to take our order until almost 15 minutes later!  My brother had already finished his 'fancy' drink by the time she came back. And then my brother wanted to order another drink at the end of the meal but by the time she came back, we were all done eating and he was over it so he just asked for the check.  She did not deserve the tip we left her. We were generous.\\n\\nAlso, Im not sure where the hostess is from but who sits someone outside on the patio in the only area where there is NOT a fan blowing on it!  We wanted to enjoy the outside ambience since we saw they had fans and this would make it a little 'cooler'.  The patio was completely empty and she seriously sat us where there were no fans when she had a completely empty patio to choose from! Obviously, we ended up moving to the other side of the patio where we could get a breeze. \\n\\nSecond, the prices are outrageous!  Be prepared to pay at least $10 for one of their cocktails and $15 for a pizza.  The quality is not worth these prices.  \\n\\nThe food.  Well, first of all, the waitress was misleading.  She said we would not have any leftovers if we ordered 2 pizzas for 3 people.  So, based on that, we ordered 2 pizzas... the Margherita and the Meat.  The pizzas werent bad.  They were just good.  Nothing spectacular about it.  But, 1 pizza is enough for 3 people!!  We had an entire pizza left over!!  We also decided to get the Mac because it sounded delicious.  It cost $15 for a bowl of Mac that didnt even have jalapenos in it like the description claimed it had.  It was just mediocre and for sure NOT worth $15!!! \\n\\nDrinks.  The drinks were good and strong but holy cow for the size of the drink you get the prices are way too high!  I had the strawberry mojito and the cucumber margarita.  Both were refreshing and tasty.\\n\\nOn to the bill.  It cost OVER $100 for 3 people to eat pizza and have a few drinks!!  When did pizza night turn into costing an arm and a leg?!  They really need to adjust their prices!\\n\\nIf, I ever go back to this place it will be for Happy Hour.  I would also recommend getting pizza by the slice and a beer because the fancy cocktails are over-priced.

Seriously Papa John's...heartburn....every freaking time.  Ugh.  So, On to Promise Pizza.  The other night we saw Promise while taking in a healthy meal at Jason's and since mama bear had an appointment this evening, I decided to guinea pig the kids on the place.  I called and placed the order from the simple, easy to read menu we procured the other night on the way to the car.  I opted to pick up because it was $2.00 cheaper and 20 minutes faster.  We arrived, and though our order was not quite ready, the service was friendly, and the gentlemen behind the counter offered me a complimentary drink and offered the kids an overly generous  sample portion of Italian ice cream; I was glad the order wasn't ready on account of my need to be nosy and check out the kitchen, and the kids didn't mind the free ice cream.   We ordered \\"The Range\\" on thin crust, which is your basic carnivore selection, and the cinnamon knots.  The pizza crust was crisp yet chew if that makes any sense, which is the perfect texture in my book.  The sauce was on the sweet end of the spectrum, but not overly so, and the meats were all flavorful without tasting overly cured or chemically.  The cheese, which is a mozzarella-provolone blend was mild and melted evenly and had a nice mouth feel.  All in all a win, though admittedly, not life changing, though I consider it a feat to have passed muster with organic and all natural ingredients.  The cinnamon knots were off the freakin' chain.  They were hot, light and fluffy, not oily at all, and the icing style dip with which it was served was creamy and sweet, but didn't make me feel sick like it's High Fructose Corn Syrup equivalents.  And yes, you brain dead uneducated HFCS naysayers, it is horrible for you, and if you don't choose to accept that, then have fun ordering your diabetes supplies from Wilford Brimley and working on pronouncing it \\"Dia-beet-us\\" just like he does.  Noteworthy is the fact that all of the ingredients are offered in organic, and there are several all natural food and drink items, and they offer gluten free and dairy free options.    All this and it's no more expensive than say Austin's Pizza or Pizza Hut.  The menu also boasts salads, garlic knots, chicken wings, stuffed mushrooms and jalapenos, cookies and brownies.  My first experience was full of \\"win\\" and I'm sure it won't be my last.   I give Promise a resounding thumbs up and encourage anyone who cares about putting quality organic food in their body to treat yourself to a slice of the good life."},{"name":"Urban Hibachi","address":"3120 S Kirkman Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"3","text":"The customer service is horrible!

She purposely shorted my change of .22 cents and when I asked if she could give all the change she said \\"oh, you want your .22 cents?\\" This made me fully aware that she purposely shorted my change.

We visited The Oasis while in Austin honeymooning at Lakeway Resort And Spa.\\n\\nThe Oasis is a tex-mex restaurant. And no, the food isn't amazing, 5-star stuff and that's the biggest complaint people have. But when you compare one place to another place you have to compare apples to apples. People are giving this place a bad review because they're rating only the food and comparing it to other more upscale restaurants where you just go sit in a dining room. \\n\\nBut you don't go here simply for the food. This restaurant isn't about just enjoying a meal. It's about enjoying a meal while watching an amazing sunset over Lake Travis. Practically the whole thing is chiseled out of the side of a cliff, over 400 feet high over the lake. Watching the sun drop behind those hills at the other side of the lake from a table on the side of a cliff is why people line up and wait 45 minutes EVERY night of the week to eat here. We were here on a Wednesday night and the place was packed. \\n\\nAs far as the food goes, honestly I'd say the food was on par with maybe an El Phoenix or something similar. It's not amazing but it's certainly not bad. We enjoyed what we had. But again, if you rate it only on the food you're simply missing the point of coming here. \\n\\nAnother big complaint I see in reviews is the price. Our bill for two was just under $40 not counting 2 margaritas we had while we waited. Those ran another $17. That brings our tab to a poverty-inducing $57, guys. Not what I'd call terribly expensive for the whole experience. For the food only? Absolutely. \\n\\nBut let's be honest. You're being naive if you expect this place not to charge a little more for the experience of having dinner jutting out of the side of a cliff, 400 feet above Lake Travis while counting down the last seconds of a beautiful sunset. With cheers and bells ringing and picture-taking at that. This place absolutely celebrates the setting of the sun every single day.\\n\\nI really want everyone reading this to \\"get\\" that, because I think this place isn't getting reviewed for what it is.

You'll get it then.\\n\\nListen, go somewhere else for mind-blowing tex-mex while you look at ugly pictures on yellow walls and listen to really annoying music. Come here to sit at a table on the side of a cliff overlooking Lake Travis with a bunch of other people, watch an amazing sunset and cheer at the end.....and oh yeah, have some food while you do it. \\n \\nYou do need to get there about an hour early though to get a good spot for the sunset because they don't take reservations.The exact time the sun will set is posted on their website every day."},{"name":"Massimino's","address":"207 Endicott St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"This is my favorite restaurant in the north end, hands down!!

We had lunched at Enoteca Vespaio on numerous previous visits to Austin, but this was our first dinner in the more upscale surroundings of Vespaio. It is a beautiful restaurant, very romantic Italian with brick oven, walls filled with wine bottles, and a sense of food taken seriously. We opted for two of the evening's specials: my wife suffers from IBS-D, so cannot have gluten, onion, garlic, mushrooms, cream, and more, so as much as she loves scallops, there was no easy way to adapt the menu recipe. Instead, after a conference with the kitchen, John returned to tell my gleeful wife that they could prepare her scallops especially for her with lemon, butter, capers, and spices. It was beautifully envisioned and just as beautifully prepared. I always seem to order cioppino when it is available, tried to talk myself into another seafood option, but John steered me right back to the cioppino, which was perfectly spiced, just brothy enough, with more than ample shrimp, clams, mussels, calamari, and fish, served with grilled baguette. Salads were wonderful, as was the reasonably priced bottle of Poderi Dolcetto. Add espressos and heavenly coconut sorbet with just enough crispy coconut crunch.

Little did I know, their salads and sandwiches are pretty good too.  It's an ideal place to stop by and pick up a salad or sandwich to-go with quality greater than or equal to the likes of Panera Bread or similar deli.  This review is based on the dine-in experience only, not the hams, big entrees, or catering orders.\\n\\nThis location is inside the Akers Mill Shopping Center, near the Cobb Cloverleaf (I-75 and I-285 interchange), at the corner of Cobb Parkway and Akers Mill Road.  Over the past few years, the store moved to a new location within the shopping center.  It's now in the strip mall connected to Bed Bath & Beyond.  The current location is relatively new, nice, and clean.\\n\\nLike most HoneyBaked Ham stores, the space is small.  Limited seating is available inside if you choose to dine-in.  Most people order to-go.\\n\\nA dozen sandwiches and four salads are available for roughly $7.00 each.  You can build your own sandwich too.  Each sandwich comes with a pickle spear.  A deli side + fountain drink can be added for $2.50.  So you might be looking at $10.00+ for lunch (or dinner).  Some salads and sandwiches I recommend include:\\n\\nChef Salad - mixed greens topped with ham, turkey, cheddar, Swiss cheese, and tomato\\nHam & Turkey Pesto - ham, smoked turkey, provolone, lettuce, tomato, red onion, and pesto aioli on multigrain flatbread\\nTavern Club - ham, smoked turkey, bacon, cheddar, lettuce, tomato, mayo, and honey mustard on multigrain bread\\n\\nThe nice thing about having a salad or sandwich from HoneyBaked Ham is that the meats come directly from the HoneyBaked kitchen.  The ham is tasty and has that sweet honey glaze on it.  The sandwiches are served in healthy portions and the ingredients are typically fresh.  The flatbread in the aforementioned Ham & Turkey Pesto sandwich is toasted to an appetizing crisp.\\n\\nOne sandwich I've yet to try that looks delicious is the Ham & Turkey Bella.  I'll probably order one next time I go.  It comes with ham, smoked turkey, Swiss cheese, lettuce, tomato, red onion, banana pepper rings, balsamic vinaigrette, and comes on toasted ciabatta bread.\\n\\nDeli sides include potato salad, broccoli salad, and pineapple salad.  They're OK.  I prefer the broccoli salad.\\n\\nFriendly service.\\n\\nThis store gets busy at lunchtime, so you might have a small wait."},{"name":"The OASIS on Lake Travis","address":"6550 Comanche Trl","city":"Austin","stars":"2.5","text":"Horrible service, group of 12 came in and rude service from the moment we walked in.

While overpriced with Pixie Dust, Le Cellier is a solid steakhouse in its own right.\\n\\nYes, the cheddar cheese soup is awesome. One review said that it tasted too strong of bacon. If you're like me and don't think that even bacon could taste too much like bacon, order the soup.\\n\\nThis last visit, I had the sirloin (rare) with an au poivre sauce. It could have used a bit more sauce, and it was highly seasoned. Still, it was cooked perfectly and was delicious. If you like your steak rare, they do a good job. If you like your steak well done, just order chicken. You don't like steak, anyhow.\\n\\nThey serve a nice selection of Unibroue that made me not even look at the wine list.\\n\\nThe North American steakhouse palate is not known for delicate subtlety.

A young lady (who seem to be giving us a weird look like- we don't belong there), smiled and softly asked what we wanted. \\"All the appetizers,\\" I said (my friend laughed). Once that was done, we sat outside and waited for our food to be served. In a matter of minutes (too fast I say), it was brought out. In my opinion, any food that is brought out in a matter of minutes after we place the order was freshly-frozen served.\\n\\nFOOD\\nFishook Shrimp was my favorite out of all the appetizer only because the sauce was super tasty (I don't really want to know how they make it- I do not know if I can handle the truth). Crispy Calamari was my second favorite- even though it was frozen (the rubber-ness gave it away). The worse was the Wings with Lemon Herb flavor. Maybe we should've chosen barbeque sauce (so much for trying something new). None of the appetizer left an impression, unfortunately. However, they did give a rather large amount for appetizer size thus, I wouldn't mind spending that amount of $ for them. Quantity over quality I guess, for them.\\n\\nVERDICT\\nPerhaps it is the name of the dishes/entrees and the description provided on the menu that I would actually consider of returning to try the other options. I would not, however, recommend this spot to others."},{"name":"Pizza Bruno","address":"3990 Curry Ford Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"The Orlando pizza scene is severely lacking, and this place is a welcome addition!!!

Though I don't know any of the details about it, I have even read and heard that these guys sell their bread to other area restaurants, a major plus in my book!\\n\\nSince I had never been exposed the amazing Vietnamese sandwiches that are banh mi, we ordered a Lee's Special for myself and a grilled pork one for my partner-in-crime. We opted to eat inside so that we could take in the interior, relax and check out the pastry selection before heading back out. I am not sure that I have ever been somewhere that was so quick to do so much in such a non-intrusive manner. Our order was taken as soon as we had made up our minds and we had water glasses before we had even set-in to looking at the menu. In addition, after we placed our order we were served our food in little short of a flash, reassuring me that the kitchen was moving rapidly, but that our food had not been pre-made and left to hang out until someone came along to claim it. Needless to say, I am very happy about my first experience with Vietnamese sandwiches. The Lee's Special sandwich that I ordered was filled with roasted pork, ham, pate spread and head cheese (at the least) for the meats and was enhanced with strips of cucumber, fresh jalapeno peppers, carrot, daikon radish, cilantro and reasonably-placed butter. Wow, what a combination of flavors!!! I could even have used a little less butter, as it got just a little gloppy, but my better half commented on the fact that it seemed scaled back and in better moderation than on previous visits.\\n\\nI cannot wait to get back to Lee's to try other options like their pho, bun, egg bahn mi, com and fruit smoothies. I am a sucker for avocado bubble teas and smoothies, so I cannot wait to slurp up! We left only about $10 lighter after purchasing two bahn mi for dine-in, a 6-piece bag of giant, buttery croissants and a massive filled bun of currently-unknown insides.

Only ONE of the 5 did i say, this is good, i like it. The rest was more of me forcing myself to eat it then really enjoy it.

That said, I wasn't blown away.  I may just be categorically unimpressed by cannolis.  I thoroughly enjoyed this one, but it wasn't the kind of dessert that made my eyes sparkle and my glands go wild.

It moderated a bit over the dinner, or perhaps the diner noise started to drown it out, but be prepared for a bit of hip-hop and rap with your Chinese food. Also, although the \\"hot\\" icon is next to many of the dishes, ask your waiter, because many of them are not hot at all.\\nThat aside, the interior was spacious and clean, the kitchen is open to view, and our waitress was exceptionally good. Well trained, pleasant, motivated, and knew that menu backward and forwards. She asked us a few questions and then guided us through the options (some of the dishes are available in larger or smaller sizes and so you choose based on how many you are feeding and how many dishes you are ordering.\\nWe stuck with water for the evening so I can't speak to the cocktails/wine/beer selection but it was generous so I think you will find something there you like.\\nOn to the five-star food. We started with Vegetable Spring Rolls for the table and a couple of us got the Hot and Sour Soup. I am an H&S Soup aficionado and I must have had a look of bliss on my face with the first spoonful because the table started laughing at me. Don't care. Don't miss the rich, subtle flavors and textures of this soup!  It has spice but not burning heat, making it one of the top preparations I have ever had.\\nNext came Dry-Fried Green Beans that were fresh, crisp, savory, sweet, and had little crunchy bits of onion that made them irresistible. We downed two bowls in spite of having a lot of other food! We keep it somewhat low carb so we passed on the noodle offerings and went straight to the Crispy Royal Shrimp (hot, crunchy, and so flavorful) and Char Siu (Chinese tacos with soft buns, succulent BBQ Tender Pork Belly with fresh cilantro and onions) and something none of us had eaten before, Black Pork Hot Pot with dark soy, fresh herbs and egg. Think of the most excellent, melt in your mouth pot roast you have ever had and then turn the flavor up to 11. It was rich, savory and very filling.\\nWe ended our meal (at the waitress' suggestion) with a little dish I like to call heaven. They call it General Tso's Chicken but it was unlike any other I have eaten. Lightly breaded, not greasy, with a sauce that was both savory and piquant with a little sweetness, but the item that took this over the top was the slivers of tangy, sour apple. I could have eaten that for days, but my stomach was pleasantly full and I felt totally sated.\\nOld Thousand was reasonably priced enough to be our neighborhood go to and it has takeout if you want that. I don't think we would trade the experience of getting food so fresh and hot from the kitchen that it sang, but other options are available.\\nWe will be back and bringing friends!

Not to all the fun places like Paris or London, but to places where you sometimes have to worry about kidnapping. So when I say this was absolutely the worst service I have ever had, you need to understand just what goes in to that comment.\\n\\nI arrived and had 6 friends meeting me. I asked for a table and was told that there was open seating and to sit anywhere. I picked a table and within about 15 minutes my friends arrived. Shortly after that, we were told that we had sat at a \\"reserved\\" table. I asked how one would know it was reserved since it was \\"open seating\\" and there was no sign on the table. I never received a response to that. So then we get sat at another table for 8 that was maybe 20 feet from the first table. So then I ask how the second table for 8 is so much more different than the first table for 8. No answer to that one either.\\n\\nThe waiter at first was quick to assist us. He took our drink and food orders and we thought all was fine. How mistaken we were. We didn't time it, but the delay in getting our drinks so was long, that 2-3 people joked about storming the bar to get our drinks. Finally the drinks arrived and one beer glass had to be sent back since it was fresh out of the washing machine and almost too hot to touch.\\n\\nSo not too long after the beer glass festivities, the food starts showing up. Well, that is, everyone's except my mine and one other persons. We were told when everyone else's food showed up, that ours would be up shortly. We continued talking and most everyone was eating. Again, I don't recall the times, but over the course of what I believe was 45-60 minutes, I asked the waited no fewer than 4 or 5 times where my hamburger and friend's salmon was. On one trip by, the waiter asked if my friend needed another beer. I asked if that beer came with a hamburger attached to it and I was promised it was coming soon. A few minutes later the beer shows up with no hamburger. It was then that I expressed that I was done waiting that and  something needed to be done now.\\n\\nA few minutes later the manager comes by and I ended up not being impressed at all. I understand that mistakes happen, but how you deal with those mistakes is what is important. It didn't take long for me to realize that he really didn't care and was just telling me how sorry he was because that's what you are supposed to say. I'm sure he wasn't real happy with me when I told him I didn't want to hear his apologies, that he needed to go manage something, and get my burger done immediately.\\n\\nA few minutes later the burger came out, and unfortunately, we weren't done. I had asked for the bacon cheese burger with no veggies. What I got was a bacon cheeseburger with nothing on it. No cheese, no bacon, no nothing. Just meat and a bun. I expressed my disgust to the waiter and told him I was just going to eat the burger since I really didn't feel like waiting for another hour. It was at that time that I started sending text messages to friends describing the ordeal I had been going through. To my surprise, a good number of my friends responded that they had also been to this Kona and had similar poor service. One friend even commented that he had emailed the CEO of Kona who apologized and promised to send him a gift card. I'm sure everyone will be surprised to hear that this gift card never showed up.\\n\\nThen, as we were preparing to leave, I get my check and was charged full price. So after all the failures on the part of your team, you want to charge me full price for a meat and bun burger I had to wait for over an hour to get."},{"name":"Northstar Caf√©","address":"4015 Townsfair Way","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"This place is a great find in an upscale mall location.

My table mates indulged in ribs, burgers and steak and all said their food was amazing. \\n\\nWhile I can't speak for the bbq (the main attraction), the fact that the mussels were so good, just meant the bbq has to be out of this world.

The inside of the restaurant was cold but bearable. I don't think that they had the heater on. I went with a group of 5 people and so we split the chicken that would feed 2-3 people. We ordered 2 sets of chicken, the sweet and spicy and soy garlic are the 2 that we ordered. It said on the menu that it comes with potato wedges so I was excited. Before the chicken comes out, as a complimentary mini appetizer/side dish, they brought out salads. The salad dressing was I believe a homemade sauce and it was not to sweet, it was good. Then the chicken came out and I didn't see the potatoes. I was wondering where it was and it was integrated inside with the other chicken and covered in the same sauce as the chicken. At first, I was not sure about it because I haven't tried the sauce yet and I also like my potatoes not covered like that. I like it plain. But I ended up really loving the sauces, so I was okay with it being covered on the wedges. For sure I would give the sauces a 10, however I give this place a 4 Star because the way the chicken were cooked on the inside was inconsistent. Some would be cooked well, while others seemed like it needed to be cooked a little more or a little less. I think once they perfect the chicken, this place will surely be on the rise for competition to other places. I would def want to come here again after some time to see if they have improved on the chicken."},{"name":"Menya Ramen","address":"331 W Bridge St","city":"Dublin","stars":"4","text":"I've been to this new location a few times before I realized that my previous review was for the old location.\\n\\nAmazing ramen, amazing service, very accommodating with customer's request (even some of the specific ones like myself).

The patio of the restaurant overlooks the turquoise water of Lake Travis. You get to look out over the water, boats, and homes and enjoy the sights.... That is if you are lucky enough to be along an edge. Otherwise, they cram a ton of seats, tables, and umbrellas in a small space, turn a bunch of fans on to circulate the hot Texan air. That is the positive. The negative: Everything else! We order our food, fajitas with cut avocado (No raw onions on the dishes). They come out with Pico (raw onion, tomatoes, and cilantro) on the queso (melted cheese). I peel it off and move on. My meal comes out... Raw onion in my black beans, Pico with the lettuce, sour cream, and cheese. I send the bowl back, so all I am left with is my chicken and peppers. I tell the server that there weren't suppose to be onions on anything, he leaves. Our waitress comes to check on us - I'm not eating. I tell her the issue and she tells me she will check on it. She comes back, empty handed and tells me that they cook the rice in the morning with onions. I tell her that's fine, I can eat cooked onions, not raw onions. She asked why, so I notified her that in allergic to them (my throat closes up)! Waitress tells me that I should announce it when ordering. Actually if I don't want something and order it without, I should get it how I order it! She leaves and delivery boy comes back; raw onions in my black beans, guacamole with onions, no rice, no sliced avocado. I send the beans back, and figure I will just move the guacamole out of the way. Waitress comes back, I tell her the issue, she says she'll look into it and walks away. My fajitas and peppers are now cold, the tortillas are hard and cold like cardboard. I am trying to eat it while the deliverry boy comes back with an overflowing cup of black beans (on raw onions on top) and nothing else. He leaves and I stir the beans, the raw onions are in it, they just poured more on top to hide them. Glad I didn't eat them, there food is NOT worth going to the hospital for! Never got my sliced avocado, never got any rice, NEVER saw the manager. And my check? They gave me a discount of not having to pay for the black beans or cheese, guacamole, or lettuce... Oh how nice of them! I would NEVER RETURN! The manager should be fired for not training the employees well and for not coming to talk to a customer when the food was wrong, not once, not twice, but THREE TIMES and all the requested food didn't come out!

We had tried to point out that they needed to be split both when we ordered and when we asked for our order to be wrapped for take-away, but the server disappeared before we could get the words out. We were ready with our funds when he appeared to give us the checks, and we almost had to restrain him from running away again so we could give him our money - we feared that if he was out of sight again, we'd never see him again.\\n\\nI'd also like to point out that when we came in and were seated, the place was nearly empty, so not sure why others who came in after us and were seated around us were served before we were.

The beet salad was absolutely disgusting, just over drenched in an incredibly overpowering balsamic vinagrette, the beets themselves were mushy and looked like they were from a can.  The lobster cannelloni had maybe a teaspoon of lobster and again was LOADED with cheddar cheese.

The boar ribs came stacked like a game of Jenga, so you had to pay attention what you were grabbing or else you knew you could make a huge mess.  They were good...some meatier than others (a few only had crispy skin and no meat) but a nice way to get ready for a meal.\\n\\nThe BF and I shared our entrees of quail and and lamb chops.  Both were very, very good.  The lamb was cooked perfectly, which is sometimes difficult because I like them medium rare.  But voila...just as I ordered.  My favorite lamb chops are still at El Greco, but I digress.  The quail was really good too.  Absolutely no complaints.  The sides of mac & cheese and collard greens were OK.  Mac & cheese was appropriately cheesy, but I had to add pepper and the greens needed lots of help with pepper and Tabasco.  I was happy to see that they did use pork instead of the paltry turkey substitute.\\n\\nMy friend ordered the brisket.  It looked dry to me, so I didn't sully my taste buds with any of it.

The popovers were okay, but the tartare tasted mostly of hoisin sauce, the Asparagus Tempura was no better than anything you'd get in a Japanese restaurant, Gnocchi was fair, Fried Chicken Sandwich was flavorless except for the papaya slaw which tasted like papaya salad from any Thai place, and the foie on the Burger was overcooked (on the dry side).  I was hoping dessert would save the meal, and ordered the Tres Leche Meringue--it was terrible, hard, dry and overly sweet, so sweet that it leaves a sugary aftertaste in your mouth; the dessert consisted of a hard meringue bowl with a piece of cake at the bottom and a few slices of cooked strawberry on top, it was probably the worst part of the entire meal.

Austin TX...not Louisiana. Don't whine about how it's not like the crawfish in LA. If you want LA style crawfish, make a road trip. Otherwise, enjoy it for what it is.\\n\\n2. Do not wear anything that you really like if you plan on eating said crawfish. You'll get it messy...guaranteed! \\n\\n3. If they don't offer you wet naps, don't complain on it here after the fact. Ask while you are there. They are much more helpful than you may give them credit for. They just can't read minds.\\n\\nNow that the housekeeping is over, let's get to it. This is my first restaurant crawfish experience, hence the 4/5 until I have something to compare it against.\\n\\nThe crawfish was well seasoned in a very flavorful well spiced butter sauce. Laden with corn, sausage, and potatoes, I could have easily spooned this sauce directly into my gullet! We also ordered a dozen oysters on the half shell. Sweet and briny, they satisfied my craving. Steamed shrimp came out perfectly steamed with a nice meaty bite and mild seasoning. Fried soft shell crabs. Cute little critters, a little on the small side. They were well fried and flavorful, but they were crabs that were harvested toward the later part of their molting period, which results in a not so soft shell. They also neglected to remove the gills first, which results in a slightly rough texture and bitter flavor. The staff was friendly and attentive. (they brought ME wet naps...without asking). \\n\\nOne more word of warning.

And I can fry a mean pan of chicken so when I find a place that does chicken and does it well it makes me feel good because I don't have to help with the clean up. \\n\\nHCT is new to me as I am new to Cbus but it did not take long for me to hear the chatter about its gloriousness. I did not have any interest in dealing with weekend crowds so I planned to stop by on my way to work after a meeting and I was not disappointed. \\n\\nI love spicy food, I mean the burn your tongue off, sweating and nose running spicy kind of food, but I don't like for the spice to overpower the food so I decided to go with the hot wings for my first try. I added a banana pudding because um why not...and filled up a cup with some good sweet tea which is the only tea I thought I existed until I was 25yo. The tea was sweet, not southern sweet but was refreshing with the meal.\\n\\nso the chicken comes out piping hot from the grease and loaded on top of 2 slices of white bread. YES GAWD YES!! (side note: now I have seen some reviews that have been pondering why the plain white bread is there, saying that it adds nothing but here's some education, bless your hearts. In the south white bread is king. It's a hamburger bun, hotdog, bun, sandwich bread, all the above and all at once. It is there to soak up the crunchy pieces that fall off the chicken along with some of the spice and to sop up (yes I said sop) any and everything that is left on the plate. If you ever visit Harold's Fried Chicken in Chicago you know what is lining the bottom? WHITE BREAD. If you get a chicken box in Baltimore from the famous Lexington Market, what is it served with? WHITE BREAD.) You do have the options of upgrading to a waffle and they provide syrup for you if you do.\\n\\nAnyway the chicken was spicy enough to have me taste the spice but not overwhelming so that you can enjoy the food. For people who REALLY like spicy food this will be enjoyable and the Holy will definitely be hotter but I think could potentially be distracting. I will order the Holy one day just so I can get a good comparison between the spice levels though. I had a side of the housemade ranch and it was good though I usually eat my chicken naked anyway unless I'm adding some Texas Pete hot sauce but the ranch had a good flavor to it and complemented the chicken well.\\n\\nThe mac and cheese was good, tastes like they use real cheese and not any cheese product crap. it was a nice way to calm down the tastebuds after taking a bite of the spicy chicken. The slaw is another hot topic amongst the Southern transplants in Cbus. Yes it's not creamy and mayo based and honestly I am usually not a fan of vinegar based coleslaw but this one was actually pretty good, had a slightly sweet taste and did was crunchy and fresh. \\n\\nThe banana pudding was topped with whipped cream and crushed nila wafers and was definitely NOT from a can or box. you could taste the actually banana which to me is the only way that banana pudding should be made.\\n\\nI really enjoyed HCT. I was not disappointed at all. If going on the weekend I would definitely call ahead and would not risk walking out with a case of the sads because the ran out of the chicken I wanted. good fresh food is what I expected and got and I will def be back."},{"name":"Mother‚Äôs Bistro & Bar","address":"121 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Always a good time!

Lunch is very affordable, their service is top notch, and if you're looking for sushi on the east side, Seito is probably one of the best choices you can make. I actually stumbled into Seito for the first time last year upon discovering they served ramen. Before this, the closest place for me was Sapporo and I often had to be in the mood to make the trek and have their ramen. But after having the Tonkotsu Ramen at Seito, there better be a damn good reason why I need to drive that far. \\n\\nThe vibe at Seito is comes off more laid back. The booths are perfect, clean, and not over decorated. They are often playing a nice chilled out Hiphop playlist to the tune of Nujabes that you won't notice unless you stop and listen. Despite feling like an open area, the seating arrangement is done in that you're probably not going to find someone staring your face off while your slurp down your ramen noodles. \\n\\nI've had quite a few things here so I'll convert to a list format to be brief: \\n\\nSpicy Tuna Kobachi: Perrrrfect! It's a perfect share if you and a friend/date want to eat something other than sushi BUT still want a bite or two of some good fish. I recommend it spicy (it's about the level of Sriracha, which isn't spicy to me). The spice & oil is not overpowering and you can still taste the fish pretty well. It comes with sliced pickled cucumbers which complement the flavor of the spicy tuna very well. This also leads me to believe anything they have with spicy tuna is delicious. \\n\\nTonkotsu Ramen - The real star here is the seared pork belly that comes with the Ramen. Although I always wish there was more in my bowl, it's perfectly portioned for lunch. Don't let the bowl fool you either. After the pork, it's the soy-seasoned soft boiled egg that also shines. I usually save this for last but it's not overly salty and has never been overcooked for me. I also love that they top it with shredded seaweed instead of the strips as some places will do. \\n\\nIf you don't eat pork, I heard the Shoyu with Chicken is really good. PLEASE note that Shoyu means it's a soy sauce base, which can be quite salty. I'm hesitant to order the Gyu because they describe it with \\"Pho spice beef broth\\", which the elitist food snob in me believes is completely different. (I should probably try it anyways though, so... grain of salt, yeh?) \\n\\nPork Loin Katsu - Think of it as a pork chop breaded in panko crust. It's basically daikon hash (daikon looks like a white carrot), pork loin, pork gravy, a fried egg, topped with some green onions and spices. If you don't know what daikon is, don't fret. It's going to taste like potatos to you. Perfect for your friend who is not accustomed to Asian food or if you're feeling like something a little heavy.\\n\\nRoasted Salmon Lunch Deal - Want something light and healthy? The roasted salmon is perfect. It's a 6-7 oz salmon steak over vegetables with a side of rice. They also include their white miso based sauce that pulls it all together nicely. If you're a big eater though, go for their Roasted Faroe Island Salmon as it's a larger portion.\\n\\nPork Belly Bao Buns - Their bao buns used to be on a rotation, but I think they've made it just pork belly now. If you're asian, these aren't the bao buns you get from the asian market. They're more like bao tacos, flat round (but fluffy) pieces of steamed bread wrapped around tender delicious slices of pork belly. This is a great appetizer for ANYONE. I've taken my coworkers here and suggested it and they're crazy over it. \\n\\nThe soup and salad that comes with their lunch deals is good too. I can't speak much to them but the salad is crispy and not soggy. Miso soup is miso soup, I suppose. I can't tell you the difference between real and the paste-made to be honest, lol. \\n\\nI LOVE LOVE their scallop nigiri. They're just huge, irresistable juicy pieces of scallop. I have never gotten them the same anywhere else. This is also true of their crab nigiri, which is not imitation crab. Their tuna and salmon also fall in line with the high quality fish they use. I definitely trust the quality here. \\n\\nI'm also a big fan of their tea selection. All of which come with a small kettle and is actual loose tea, not bagged. They usually bring them to you in these cool cups that will not burn your hand for holding them. \\n\\nNot really a downside but...\\n\\nI've been somewhat bugged by the fact that their Tonkotsu ramen is more expensive at dinner than it is at lunch, but is the same portion. I believe this is due to the cost involved with keeping the ramen going for dinner (but I'm only assuming here). At $14 (or 15?), it is slightly out of the reasonable range for me. I also think because their lunch is such a good deal ($9) it just sort of confuses me. I get that Seito is a bit upscale either way.

Very tasty, it reminded me of the Ethiopian lentil curry, kik alitcha.  The soup was served with bideena \\"bread,\\" which seems almost identical to Ethiopian injera, a spongy sourdough flatbread/pancake.\\n\\nMy entree was the  Foon Hoolaa Diimaa, lamb stewed in beri-beri sauce (comparable to Ethiopian berbere).  The flavor was exceptional.  My only complaint was that it seemed as though the meat had not really been stewed in the sauce, as it was rather tough, and had not taken on the spicy flavors as one would expect from stewing; this might be a difference between Somali and Ethiopian cultures, but I doubt it.  More bideena was served with the lamb stew.\\n\\nI will add that service is extremely friendly, and food is delivered very quickly, and freshly prepared.

There are lots of workers around the whole restaurant but no one is ever willing to help you. My friend ordered some drink they offered, where it is unlimited refills. Every time she wanted a refill no one brought it. Only when the workers were bringing refills to the table next to us, they gave her a refill and it always seemed like they were reluctant to do so. We were still hungry and wanted to order more food but we were so fed up with how slow and bad the service was we wanted to leave. We asked at least 3 workers to give us the cheque and no one ever did. Finally a worker told us to go up to the cashier to pay.

The menu changes seasonally (the filet, for example, has gone from mushroom, to pea, to spinach risotto).\\n\\nPre-Steak: First things first, the bread. The pretzel bread is amazing (crunchy but soft, warm, slightly salted). The maple/salt combo on the butter is good and unexpected.\\nThen we ordered the cheese soup and original poutine. The soup is delicious and perfect with the pretzel bread. The poutine is great. I've had this once before in Toronto in a fast food place, and this was by and far more delicious. My only tip here would be to see if they will leave the red wine sauce on the side, as by the time we got to the bottom, the fries were soggy, and the sauce is a bit strong.\\n\\nSteak: Filet was 8 oz of tender. Perfectly cooked and seasoned. The spinach bacon risotto that came with it made for a perfect bite if eaten together. The rib eye was a 16 oz monster. It was huge and I stared at my boyfriend in wonder as he actually ate the entire thing. I am told the garlic butter is \\"incredible\\" but he devoured it before I had a bite. Both steaks were cooked perfectly to order.\\n\\nPost-Steak: We ordered a meyer lemon curd torte. And we got a second one for my birthday surprise. I sort of wish we would have known about this, because I would have asked for 2 different desserts. The torte was tart and sweet. It's good and a new favorite.\\n\\nOverall, I would not pass up this dinner if you have a chance and can afford to go.

We stumbled upon Massiminino's...saw the menu looked decent and that it had solid reviews and then stepped inside. \\n\\nWe sat in the basement which wasn't too bad. The decor was cute and simple and the atmosphere screamed authentic italian. \\n\\nOur waitress was extremely nasty and abrupt.

Our waitress, without looking, slammed my friends pasta dish on the table and spilt lots of the sauce on the cloth without even noticing or apologizing. My other friend ordered a linguini and calimari dish that simply looked sickly. Instead of a pasta dish topped with crisp, fried calimari, he received a watery linguini with probably steamed squid. The squid tasted extremely fishy and rubbery and probably explains why he has been on the toilet for the last 20 minutes as I watch the Bruins game alone. He described the squid as \\"Vermicular, or wormlike for laymen, which tastes as if it had been laid out in the sun all day.\\" He should have sent the dish back but simply left it two-thirds uneaten. The rest of the dishes (mostly chicken dishes) were average at best and the portions were extremely small save for the pasta dishes. \\n\\nNot once during the meal did the waitress ask how things were. She seemed to care more about schmoozing with her coworker by the bar rather then providing any service. When it came time to split the bill we decided we would leave a below-average tip (about 15%). When the waitress came to collect the credit card receipts she stared at them and then said \\"This isn't an acceptable tip...it's not even 10%.\\" Besides being just wrong with the math, she neglected the cash tips that two others left, this was horribly unprofessional. While we explained to her the tip was 15% and reflected the poor food/service, she whipped out a calculator to demonstrate her version of the math and added that she didn't cook the food.

My boyfriend and I are both white, and while I do understand some Spanish, I never gave any indication of such and we were treated no differently because of this. \\n\\nI think bad service can happen anywhere. Sometimes you just have a bad server, or sometimes a server is just having a bad day, or sometimes the cook is having an off day. That doesn't make it okay, but it happens, even at the best of restaurants. So I have to wonder if some of those comments are the result of someone of non-hispanic descent walking into a restaurant filled with 99% Hispanic patrons and feeling a little insecure as a result and just assuming their bad service is due to their race. I could be wrong, and I realize that. But all I know is that we didn't have that experience as everyone was very friendly and attentive, and we were definitely the only white, non-Hispanic people there at the time. \\n\\nI think this place is a hidden gem and I would definitely come back.

My potatoes were cold and the poached eggs were undercooked. I took two bites and put my napkin on top of it, assuming my server with the cute curly hair behind the bar would have noticed I didn't eat and ask if something was the matter. That didn't happen unfortunately. In fact the entire time I was there I only saw my server a few times whenever I flagged her down for a refill on my coffee (and on a side note to her: when someone is looking at the menu for less than 60 seconds don't ask them if they're ready to order yet. When they're ready to order they'll put their menu down. Then you can ask them, otherwise you're making them feel rushed.) As if all that wasn't bad enough the banana stuffed French toast was made from a piece of bread was clearly stale. I'm 34 years old and have been going to Zaftigs since high school and after this experience I will never be going back. I just can't justify spending $50 on below average food. I'm not sure if the owners have changed or the management changed or what the deal is, but definitely not going back and I wouldn't recommend you go either. RIP Zaftigs."},{"name":"Se√±or Frog's","address":"8747 International Drive #103","city":"Orlando","stars":"2.5","text":"We went there this past Sunday afternoon.

Total came to $36 each person (that includes tip) I personally think it should be worth $30 because the quality wasn't that good, but the food--like I said-- still fills you up and it was decent. I'd come back here! Without a booked room or section, the seating around looked pretty crowded. If you want privacy, I suggest booking a room of section, and have at least 4-5 people. TIP: For the AYCE paper where you can number off boxes, just know that it's by one single piece. So if you want 6 pieces put 6 beside the name of the item -- Unless it has brackets with (6) meaning it comes in 6. I was sad because my friends like their coffee jello or whatever it was.

I love having lunch with them because they're my 'foodie group' - the circle of friends who want to dine where they've never dined before and will try anything once. When we were deliberating where to eat, one suggested they want Malaysian/Singaporean food, and Banana Leaf came up. Since none of us have dined here in years, we decided to give it a go.\\n\\nMy friend who's dined here before told me she had a bad experience before but was willing to give it another shot. As we walked in, one of my fears came to life: abysmal service. The hostess gave me attitude after I had asked a simple question (do we need a reservation to eat here?) The nerve of this girl. I've worked in the service industry before and I would never respond the way she did, so I was ready to walk out. But since I've never had a bad experience here, I thought I'd let it slide. Thank goodness that was just a little hiccup, because our server couldn't have been nicer. He was very attentive and knew when to check on us. Any trace of the venomous encounter with the hostess is gone.  \\n\\nWhen he asked what we wanted to drink, I ordered one of the best drinks I've had in my entire life: Pineapple Slush Colada. Anyone who knows me knows I LOVE coconut (used to hate it, now love it). Coconut water, coconut cream cake, coconut macaroons, coconut milk, coconut trees (because it reminds me of paradise),  coconut erry'thang, me loves it. The combined sweetness of the pineapple and coconut mixed together in slush form was definitely fireworks in my mouth. Or-gas-mo. When we tried each other's drinks, it was unanimous that my drink was the best. High five, me.\\n\\nThen our orders came. We started off with the Appetizer Sampler which was a small plate of vegetables in a tangy dressing. It was okay, not the very best. Just Plain Jane in my opinion. Then we were served with a big platter of calamari, spring rolls, and roti. The spring rolls were quite delicious, and the roti was actually pretty good, but the calamari didn't quite take off as the other 2. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't superb either. \\n\\nWe had some chicken and beef satay as well. I'm not a big fan of beef satay, so I guess I'm a bit more bias - but I preferred the chicken satay better. The beef tasted a little chewy, whereas the chicken was quite moist. The sauce that came with it tasted average, just okay. Then our fried rice arrived. It was served in a half-gutted pineapple. Raised my eyebrow a little bit on the presentation, because I learned that anything served on the plate should be edible. That half eviscerated pineapple was definitely not, but it's ok because the fried rice was pretty good. It was the Pineapple Fried Rice with Seafood & Chicken. I liked it. Then our last main dish arrived, which is the Braised Lamb Shank. I don't normally have lamb anywhere except when I dine in Greek restaurants so I was a bit skeptical. But as I'm with foodie friends and I'm willing to eat anything once, I tried it. Fall off the bone and marinated in a flavorful sauce, I liked this dish as well. Delish!\\n\\nOf course we wouldn't be a foodie group without finishing off with dessert. I can't have chocolate so my friends were kind enough to order dishes with no chocolate: Pisang Goreng and Kuih Dadar. Pisang Goreng is deep fried banana served with vanilla ice cream topped with crushed nuts and palm sugar. I love deep fried desserts served with ice cream, so this was a hit for me. Kuih Dadar is another coconut dish, so you know that I'ma be raving about it. According to their website: \\"Sweet coconut crepe made with pandan leaves with palm sugar and grated coconut\\". KABOOM. More coconut goodness in my mouth. The presentation of both desserts delivered, so that definitely helped with the experience.\\n\\nAmbiance, experience, food, and service. I would give this place a stellar 5/5 had it not been for that insufferable hostess. I'm giving it a 4.5/5, bumping it 4/5 (I really gotta campaign for those half star ratings). Would I come back?

Clean, though.\\n\\nThe menu is relatively small and doesn't use any of the buzzwords I've seen in all the reviews and such.

They were cold in the center which of course leads them to be less stringy and more chewy...figured we could warm them in the marinara but that was ice cold, too.  Tasted alright, though.\\n\\nNext up, side-salad.  Basic iceberg lettuce, three slices of onion, some diced tomatoes, house vinaigrette.  It tasted like they took a bottle of olive oil and shook it, then drizzled it.  Maybe some pepper in it, too?  Spliced with vegetable oil?  Absolutely zero flavor from herbs, wine, anything.  Very oily, very thick, an almost 'frothy' texture.  Very difficult to describe.  Very unappealing.  The receipt lists it as 'vinegar and oil'.\\n\\nOur entrees arrived.  We ordered the grilled pork tenderloin and pancake tacos.\\n\\nMy meal, the pancake tacos, was instantly 3* tops because the bacon was clearly microwaved.  Eating the taco was literally like eating matter.  Tasteless matter.  Slightly textured during the odd bite of microwaved bacon.  The only flavor was the syrup.  It came with house chips which, at first, were fantastic.  A really unique, fresh taste with a hint of salt.  Perfectly crisp.  Then the waves of salt came.  Every bite was like a tablespoon of salt.  Then the disgusting chemical/gas taste came. More on that in a sec.\\n\\nMy guy's pork tenderloin was fantastic!  ...at first.  The meat tasted so good, cooked perfectly, well seasoned...  Then he tried the broccoli...and it was so, absolutely, utterly disgusting.  He said it was a burnt taste so when I took a bite I about threw up when I was hit with the taste of gas/melted plastic/chemicals.  I could NOT get that taste out of my mouth.  It's the taste you get when using new cookware (or actually melting plastic on your current cookware), cooking too early on coal, letting gas build up with propane, etc.  IT'S NASTY!\\n\\nI spit it out on the plate instantly.  It was on multiple random food items after that and I don't know if it was the lingering taste in my mouth or the actual taste.  The chips, the noodles, the meat, everything.  EW!\\n\\n...so finally, we can't stomach any more of our ...nasty...'matter' food and decide on the fried cheesecake.  Everyone raves about their dessert.  Fried cheesecake it is!  NY, please!  ...tastes like Key Lime Pie...  Not what we ordered.  Still, it tasted great.\\n\\nThe server asks if we want to-go boxes for our food and we say yes and also if we can have to-go drinks.  She says sure, grabs 'em, gives us everything, walks away.  To our amazement, our check lists a price of $1.79 for each to-go drink.  These aren't giant big gulp cups like what were sat at the table with, either.  These are those small, one size larger than a water cooler cup, maybe 6 oz, cups.  Charging for to-go cups is absurd either way but it really pisses me off when there are upcharges and extra charges not explicitly mentioned or explained.\\n\\nThe receipt does not appear to make sense.  The tax isn't listed, the total is wrong for both a before and after 5% off discount with and without tax applied.  Granted, I'm bad at math but no receipt should list solely 'discount' and 'total'.  No sub total, no tax, no nothing else.\\n\\nI don't understand why nearly every restaurant on the island serves crap or has crap service.

The noodles would clump together, and thought chewy, tasted doughy. They ruined what would have otherwise been a good bowl of ramen. I highly highly recommend eating at another establishment with better noodles, as it's hard to eat ramen with improper noodles.

Wait staff needed to consult the kitchen multiple times to clarify gluten free options. Also had to waive the bread basket at the start.\\n\\nWait time for dinner was long - reservations were for 5:00pm, but we were not served dinner until well after 6:15pm. Surprisingly even though the wait for dinner was long, we were rushed through  our appetizer, as wait staff asked to clear the table twice before we were done. After we let the first waiter know we were still working on our appetizer, a different wait staff member came and simply took it away without asking - and we had quite a bit of our appetizer left.\\n\\nOur seating near the children's play area was noisy as parents were hollering to each other over our table and cold as a nearby door that led outdoors that wasn't meant to be accessed kept being opened by disoriented patrons looking for the front door. It also felt cramped where we sat one of our chairs nearest the walkway kept getting bumped into.\\n\\nThe food and drinks were just OK, but the atmosphere and service was disappointing.

The hardest thing is deciding which pastry, muffin or scone to order.

I also love the cinnamon rolls and nut breads. The banana chocolate-chip muffin is a tad sweet for me but otherwise perfect - the banana flavor sings loud, which is unusual in a pastry. The cookies, or the ginger cookie anyway, is good, but not great. It's a little sweet and not spicy enough - I like ginger and gingerbread cookies to smack me around a little.

We came here for lunch and all the side dishes that arrive before the actual food is delicious, as any other Korean restaurant. The only dish I was not impressed of was the steamed egg... not my favorite, since it doesn't have much flavor and it's kinda too dry for me. I got a bibimbop and my husband got a short rib  bulgogi. To be honest I think the bibimbop was better than the bulgogi. But overall they were both delicious! The meet is juicy and well marinated with the sauce, the vegetables in the bibimbop are well marinated in sesame oil. Do not forget to put the Korean spice paste!! That brings out the flavor even more, and creates that korean food explosion in your mouth. The one reason this place gets 4 stars is that I prefer to go to another Korean restaurant. Yet, if you come here you can get authentic and delicious food!

My first visit to their food truck last year was outstanding (see my previous review)..but I just haven't been impressed with the North Market location in the two times I've gone. Both times I waited over 15 minutes to get my food.. one was in the middle of lunch rush so I understand but the other was 10-15 minutes after they opened and they weren't that busy yet. The chicken was decent both times but nothing extraordinary. I'm not a fan of the purely vinegar flavored slaw (and I usually prefer it that way), but I do enjoy the mac and cheese. Also, for me at least, paying $12 or more for a decent fried chicken meal without waiter service and having to wait a long time seems just a bit high. \\nMy one experience with the food truck really blew me away, but both visits to north market have left me disappointed with the taste of the chicken and especially with the wait time."},{"name":"Long John Silver's","address":"704 E Williams Cannon Dr","city":"Austin","stars":"2.5","text":"OK, back in the late 1980's this little fast food fish joint opened up in my home town, up in Oregon.

Amazing.\\nOh, the entrees are so good that you forget about the pasta you get on the side, and good riddance. The pasta is overcooked and gummy. It's really not good, but the entrees are so great that I overlook the terrible pasta side dish. I don't know if this applies to the regular pasta dishes! I will update my review once I get sick of my chicken dish and try a pasta dish!\\nBeware, this place does get busy Friday and Saturday nights.

All I cared about was the complimentary pretzel bread, which is sooo good - perfect salty balance with doughy goodness.  We ordered the bacon cheddar cheese soup, the filet (done rare) with mushroom risotto, and because we couldn't pick between the poutines (well, also because we are fatties), we ordered both the Le Cellier poutine (red wine reduction with truffle) and Farmhouse poutine (tomato jam with poached jam).  The cheddar cheese soup was heavy and bursting with bacon and cheese flavor.  The only problem is that it doesn't leave much room for the other dishes yet to come but it is a must-have dish.  Next came our two poutines.  I preferred the Le Cellier over the Farmhouse because the fries were crispier and the truffle and red wine reduction were very well balanced.  I didn't get the bitterness that I usually find in red wine reduction sauces.  Rather, the flavor of the red wine was enhanced by the truffle.  The fiance liked the Farmhouse poutine because of the egg but the fries are soggier.  This was probably enough for two people but we still had a filet coming, which I'm glad we ordered.  The filet was cooked and seasoned perfectly and the risotto was great.  \\n\\nI admit, the restaurant is a bit pricey but it's pretty average for either a steakhouse or a French restaurant, however you want to categorize it.

The diet coke served up was flat. This food had no discernible smell nor did it have any detectible texture. It was lukewarm food too. The bits of grated, orangey cheese were rubbery and completely devoid of taste, I mean cheese is meant to have a taste, the sour cream was served in a tiny paper pot and priced at 59 cents was  more like plain yoghurt and the guacamole also at 59 cents served in a small paper pot just tasted metallic, it certainly didn't have an avocado taste.

One cool feature is that you can customize your cannolis to the way you want it. \\n\\nUsing really rough estimates, the cannoli is 10.5 cm long end to end, and roughly 3.5 cm wide at the midsection, so it's somewhat smaller to the bigger cannolis of Mike's Pastry down the street. \\n\\nI had a regular cannoli with vanilla custard. I took a bite, closed my eyes, and began to chew. My taste buds and palate communicated to me:\\n\\n\\"MMMMM..... this is really good.... creamy sweetness.... whoa... you should have got some more of this stuff!\\" \\n\\nYeah, my taste buds and palate experienced a flying dash of elation from the creaminess of the vanilla custard. \\n\\nI also got a regular cannoli filled with riccotta cream with almonds topping the cream. Although my taste buds and palate did not experience much of a flying dash of elation, it tasted really fresh, not too sweet and had a nice creaminess. The riccotta definitely tasted fresher and creamier compared to the cannolis at Mike's Pastry. The almonds also tasted really good and the mixture with the riccotta cream combined with the crisp shell made this cannoli a really tasty treat. \\n\\nAs for the other pastries, I have not had Tiramasu in a long time, so I decided to get a Tiramasu cake with my cannolis. It was also really tasty and had the right amount of creaminess and sweetness. It also had a good amount of softness, so this is probably one option I would definitely get if I am not in the mood for cannoli. \\n\\nBased on my personal experience, when it comes to comparing the two bakeries on Hanover Street in terms of cannolis: if you want big and good tasting cannolis, go to Mike's Pastry. If size does not matter, and want great tasting cannolis, go to Modern Pastry. If I really want the Riccotta Florentine Cannoli, I go to Mike's Pastry (Modern Pastry does not have it). If I want a yellow cream/vanilla custard cannoli I go to Modern Pastry.  So I think both bakeries are pretty good, but Modern Pastry beats Mike's Pastry by a small margin in terms of vanilla custard and ricotta cheese."},{"name":"Mad Hatter","address":"969 Washington St","city":"Weymouth","stars":"4","text":"My first brunch at sub urban Boston was not the best. \\nFood - I had the quiche with coleslaw.

The restaurant is located in an upscale strip/retail mall next to a private school and ice cream shop. They had nice seating out front and plenty of parking. We were quickly received and seated and then all seemed to slow way the hell down. \\n\\nThe restaurant was relatively full and had a muted but palpable energy to it. I think by and large its hard to get a very high rating when you're an italian restaurant because there are only a billion other italian restaurants and there is far less room for innovation, impact, and differentiation. Nobody ever got fired for going with IBM and nobody every truly regretted their decision for a restaurant when having Italian.....but I digress. \\n\\nThe menu was \\"typical\\", thrown together and I just figured it would be a 6/10 experience and just happy to see my old friend and his family which is fine enough but the overall experience just wasn't congruent with the prices so we often found ourselves asking \\"where's the beef?\\" The menu looked like Olive Garden \\"Plus\\" but the prices seemed to imply otherwise\\n\\nThe service was simply juvenile. Again, when you offer elevated prices to a basic italian menu the spot light is on you to justify exactly why, and these guys were just so far off target. The service staff wore cheap lazy black pants and un-ironed white shirts. They were all very very young, inexperienced, tense, rushed, forgetful, and didn't really \\"connect\\" with their patrons. \\n\\nI asked for a seltzer, ya know, cuz I'm a Jew from greater New York. 10 minutes later I got a Tonic, ya know, cuz when you're a unexperienced waiter in Atlanta, what's the figgin difference, right? After another several minutes of trying to get his attention I tried over and over to explain and describe exactly what is \\"Seltzer\\". Needless to say it was soon drained followed by a second \\"Seltzer\\" request (I know, I'm powerless over that first Seltzer. I have one and just cant stop. Someone get me to a Church basement NOW) Several minutes later my beverage came and.......Tonic Water. Really? I called over the waiter and he was honestly genuinely confused by my description of \\"Seltzer, the bubbly water that people drink?\\"  I spoke with the owner, a very nice guy. I just figured it was a NY/GA thing and I was using the wrong word or something. They were kind enough to bring me a bottle of Pellegrino. \\n\\nThe actual food was, in all honesty, quite nice. I had the Cappelini with grilled chicken and fresh pasta. The pasta was al dente to perfection. Granted not the highest quality pasta but it was certainly cooked well. The chicken was done well and the balance of tomato, garlic, basic, olive oil was just to my liking.unfortunately, the portions were absolutely meager which was frustrating because it was tasty and pricier than it should've been given the portions and service.\\n\\nDinner wound up being $25.00 per person, 2 kids 3 adults. So while not egregiously expensive it was that tricky 15% too much. You know what I mean? Not material enough to say to yourself \\"Meh....maybe another time\\", but just enough to say \\"Come-on people, gimme something to feel good about!\\" \\n\\nIn short I am going with 2 stars because while the kitchen did a good job the staff elsewhere didn't and the owner ought to consider re-thinking portions and the general customer experience."},{"name":"Bamboo Wok","address":"2432 Sand Mine Rd","city":"Davenport","stars":"3.5","text":"Service was good person greeting me was great.Food was ok we started with fried wontons no flavor.

When she dropped the check, without even asking if i needed anything else, she dropped it and then immediately without even looking at me started talking to a different table of her ethnic background.

But overall the service was good.\\n\\nFood - so i went with the 2 wing, 2 fish and waffle combo that way i could try a little bit of everything.  The food came out without any real decent looking presentation but then again it is just fried food.  I also opted to have one of my waffles to be red velvet, and i was glad i did.  So first of the waffles were really good.  Had a wonderful flavor and very fluffy but still cooked completely.  The red velvet was great, lots of red velvet flavor and also very fluffy.  The fish was breaded perfectly and came out smoldering hot.  Heck yeah.  The seasoning on the fish was also very flavorful and well seasoned.  I only had one bite that was like nothing but seasoning that made my face pucker for bit but overall that was damn good fish.  Fried perfectly, great flavor and cooked completely.  The wings were very surprising to me as i thought i would be getting smaller pieces but they were actually very decent sized wings.  Score!  These deep fried chicken wings were amazing.  They were fried perfectly, nice and crispy.  The wings were also breaded and seasoned very well.  They had a great flavor and were also cooked well.  This was a very amazing meal.  Good ole chicken and waffles.  These were some of the better chicken waffles i have had as well.  Everything was cooked perfectly and all sported some great flavor.  Nice and juicy, seasoned well and fried amazingly.  I left a very happy camper.\\n\\nOverall - originally about halfway through my meal i knew i was going to do a great review.  This was almost a 5 star review but the one thing that perturbed me was the last few minutes i was there.  Breaking the cardinal rule is bad, yeah.  But to break it and not even make eye contact with me to say thank you left me rubbed the wrong way.  Then also forgetting, or not caring, to get my togo box was disappointing.  I get it that i as soon as i walk in i get the stares of \\"omg, is that a white boy\\" but that doesnt bother me.  What bothered me was the blatant disrespect at the end.  She was friendly yeah in the beginning but at the end it felt like she just wanted me gone.  I still tipped her very well because i dont believe in tipping poorly no matter what the situation.  But i still give 4 great stars for the wonderfully deep fried dead animal goodness that i got to experience.  This was some serious chicken and fish.  I would definitely order again... but maybe togo instead since i guess i dont quite fit the dine in profile."},{"name":"Bikinis Sports Bar & Grill","address":"6901 North Interstate 35","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"I never thought in a million years I would be sitting  in a sports bar with my wife and son with our waitress in bikini top and short shorts. \\n\\nMy wife is having a blast and so is my son.

I know that I personally had been waiting for what seemed like years for this place to open once I had heard that Dave's Fresh Pasta had bought the space next door to open a wine bar, but it was definitely worth the wait, and this is an awesome addition to the Davis Square area and another great place that when you come here, you really do feel like you are out for a night on the town--well a night on the 'ville? \\n\\nThis place is a wine lovers heaven--but pretty much if you don't get a bottle, spending $10-12 a glass will add up very quickly, so make the economical choice and go with one of their hand selected bottles of wine that are actually pretty reasonably priced. Our server helped pick each of them and you could see how pumped he was to be talking about his prized possessions with us He also had tried literally every item on the menu and was a huge help in Deanna D and my ordering of nibbles for the night. That being said, when we both said we wanted to try their pork dish that was a fancy sliced pastrami like piece of pigs head that had been cured and dried in a special way while also wanting their porchetta panini, he kind of did call us  oinkers in a sense, since he thought we weren't sharing at first and that was a lot of pork ha ha So we were slightly offended, but then took it as a fun challenge and ordered both of those dishes and their anchovies and their piquillo-almond spread. \\n\\nThe verdict? The pigs head dish was awesome. I loved every bite of it. The panini was good, but since Deanna D. had just gotten back from Italy, she wasn't 100% impressed with the porchetta and said the real Italians do it better, but I mean when is that not the case? ha ha But the panini itself was still very tasty. The anchovies were awesome though. Paired perfectly with some crunchy bread crumbs and their cauliflower wow. Just wow those things were good. And the piquillo-almond spread was also pretty flavorful but they definitely served it not with flatbread as advertised but another tasty type of bread instead, which was addicting on its own level, probably because of the salty crust it had. Really there seemed to be a lot of salt action in our dishes in general which is great since we had a whole bottle of nice French wine! \\n\\nAll in all, this place is pretty awesome. Both of us ate with a bottle of wine for $40 each, the service was awesome (with a slight delay between courses but that is to be expected during their first week of service), the decor is great, and I am so pumped to finally have a wine bar to call home in this beer loving city of Boston!"},{"name":"Waterloo Ice House Southpark Meadows","address":"9600 S Ih 35 Frontage Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"No, it's not awe-inspiring awesome, but it's good.

As we waited for our drinks (the bar was bustling) we enjoyed the soundtrack of Bollywood tunes and snacked on some complimentary rice papads with a very sweet date chutney and a really nice, fresh-tasting mint chutney. \\n\\nFor apps, this time we tried vegetable pakoras and the Delhi chaat. Oh my, what good pakoras. Dusted with chaat masala, these really were veg pakoras - I tasted cabbage, broccoli, and cauliflower in addition to the usual onion/greens elements. Maya smartly uses rice flour in their pakora batter, which makes for a super light and crispy texture. The Delhi chaat was sort of like a  cross between papri chaat and aloo chana chaat - spiced chickpeas and potatoes covered with crispy chips and yogurt and seasoned with chaat spices. It was wonderfully spicy and flavorful, with a good mix of textures.\\n\\nFor entrees, we had Tandoori Vegetables and Dum Aloo, with sides of roti and naan, respectively. Both dishes were fantastic. Tandoori veg included generous portions of deliciously tandoor-charred cauliflower, broccoli, paneer, peppers, and onions, all marinated in a tangy yogurt sauce. Side rotis were perfectly done with a hit of butter. Dum aloo was fragrant and awesome with a perfect hit of North Indian spices and the sweet, rich texture of cashew paste in the sauce. Side naan was fluffy and just right.\\n\\nSo glad to have had another great experience here, and to see Maya finding a home here in town.

I realize this is a chain, but I do not recall any strong memory of visiting this chain before and this was my first visit to this location.  I read many reviews from Yelpers and thought this would be a nice place to try.\\n\\nUpon entry we were greeted and handed a pager and quoted 10-15 minutes.  It was early dinner on a Sunday, and they still had open tables.  I didn't question it and we waited.  Other parties of 2 were called and seated, including those who arrived after us; however, we were seated somewhat close to them so I let it slide.  We were seated in a booth for 4, which made me question the wait to be seated... unless they were short staffed with servers or in the kitchen.\\n\\nOur server was decent, but nothing special.  I really felt like he was bothered to be there and that we were disrupting his day... talk about welcoming!  I ordered the rib-eye with the special mac & cheese (which they charge $1.49 additional for the special side) and it also came with a salad.  My dining partner got a new your strip with fries with the salad.  I ate from both of the salads as my dining partner prefers neither, which was nice so I could eat a fully green salad between the two.  Lots of iceberg lettuce in the \\"mixed greens\\" salad, so I think they should just call it a house salad.\\n\\nThe food runner was timid, but obviously trying.  The steaks were both cooked wonderfully right to were we asked them.  Unfortunately, the mac & cheese I was paying extra for was cold.  When the server came by I informed him, he asked me to put it on a plate and he would get me \\"a new one.\\"  Another individual who I'm guessing was a manager (no introduction) apologized and blamed the kitchen for making it too early.  (He didn't allow us to say anything to him.  He said that and left.)  The mac & cheese I received was obviously the same one (not a \\"new one\\" like the server said as I could see the seasoning from my steak on the side of the dish)... but regardless, it was enjoyable.  My taste preference was that the seasoning on the steaks was nice, but very over-powering and peppery.  If I return, I will be asking for less of it.\\n\\nThe server did keep up well with our drinks, except when he brought my dining partner a cherry coke instead of a coke.  That's when he stopped drinking anything and placed it on the edge...the server never came back at that point except for the bill.  We experienced poor table maintenance, which made me happy we were at a larger table as our dishes and glasses simply accumulated on the other side of the table.\\n\\nThis is a classic example of how good food (minus the salad) can't over power the service.  From the hostesses in the front and their lack of eye contact, smiling, and flat out ignoring us as we left... to the poor service from our server, to the manager (I think) who tried to help but instead blamed it on the kitchen... your table touch would of been more effective if you would of allowed us, your dining patrons, to say something to you before you disappeared."},{"name":"The Downwind Restaurant and Lounge","address":"2000 Airport Rd, Ste 201","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Went here in Oct with some work associates.

We didn't try the sushi but went straight for Korean to order spicy codfish stew (daegu-maeuntahng), bibimbap, and yahngyum chicken.  The menu had a good number of Korean items so we were initially excited.\\n\\nService was slow, even though it wasn't very busy - while the waitress was friendly, dishes weren't collected, beverages weren't refilled, and generally we had to flag her down and make specific requests for service that establishments routinely provide.\\n\\nBut I can't go beyond 2 stars, though, because this is the first time in my life the bibimbap showed up and my first thought was...that's it??  At first I thought it was an optical illusion with the huge steel bowl, but we found the portions to be very small with bigger portion prices.  The thing that really killed it for me was when they brought out spicy pork bulgogi (daeji bulgogi) and called it yahngyum chicken.  As a red-blooded Korean carnivore, there was no way it was chicken, and everyone at my table agreed.  We asked for the right dish and it came back - from the host (owner?) saying that this was how they do their chicken.  I dunno - do chickens like to frolic in the mud and say 'oink'? (Seriously, correct me if I'm wrong here...I don't want to lob accusations).  For what I paid and tasted, I'm probably better off buying a batch of pre-marinated pork bulgogi from h-mart.\\n\\nI'm not local to Newton and with other options to get Korean food I won't be back.

For all but the pickiest West-Indians that will not mean anything about the quality of the food and unless you are West Indian, that distinction will not mean anything to you. (And a bunch of Trini's come here.) \\n\\nBut where that difference does matter is in all the things they sell that are not Guyanese/Trini. That means I have not tried, nor do I recommend their Jerk Chicken. That's a Jamaican dish and I'll leave it to my Jamaican brethren to make. Also, they sell some Soul Food for African Americans. Again, I'll leave that to my African American brothers and sisters to make. I only buy the Roti, and sometimes just the skins because I make the filling at home.\\n\\nAs for the Roti -- which really is about the only thing you should get -- unless you are Guyanese and then maybe you'll ask about some of the other specialty dishes they sell on the weekend, it's very good. Atlanta is not Brooklyn. There are not places that sell roti skins like Flatbush Avenue. So International Roti has the run of the place. \\n\\nRoti skins, as opposed to buss up shots, are called Dhali Pouri, and are thin breads which have yellow chick peas in the middle. (Buss up shots look liked busted up shirts and do not have the chick peas. Skins are Dhail Pouri.)  \\n\\nFor this particular item, International Roti house is excellent. I often will call ahead and then order them to go. \\n\\nSometimes I don't feel like cooking and I'll get the potatoes and Channa (chickpeas). Both are pretty good. I'd prefer the curry to be a little less bitter and more buttery, which is why I make my own.\\n\\nThis place is in a sketchy area, to be completely honest. There's a liquor store next door that adds a bizarre element to the strip mall. Plus, there's not much else on that stretch of Covington Highway. Inside, it's not really a place to sit and eat, though there are seats. I'd recommend just taking it  (the Roti) to go.\\n\\nA good sign of it's popularity is the fact that the Guyanese/Trini community supports the place. It always has a line of folks waiting to talk to (or in some cases flirt with) the staff. They are guarded, but friendly.\\n\\nSo, if you are looking for some authentic Roti, International Roti House lives up to its name. Take it to go, enjoy at home and take a piece of West Indian culture along with you."},{"name":"Strip","address":"245 18th St","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"I have visited Strip on several occasions and have always walked away feeling like I enjoyed the experience.

Liquid-soaked cakes and dense, overly-sugared cookies have just never done it for me.\\n\\nLiving a 10-minute walk from Hanover St., however, I figured I should give my heritage one last shot at impressing me in the baking department. If a North End bakery can't do it, no one can. After hearing much debate between Mike's and Modern, I decided to go with Modern.\\n\\nThe Saturday afternoon trek involved a 10-minute walk to Hanover St., a 10-minute struggle through the farmer's market, and about a 50-minute wait in a line that went out the door (into the 90-degree heat) and past the next business over. All this, I thought, for one cannoli and maybe a piece of cake.\\n\\nThe woman at the counter then informed me that there was a $10 credit card minimum.\\n\\n\\"All right, I waited so long, I guess I'll just get $10 worth of stuff.

Surprise me.\\"\\n\\nThe woman smiled and ran off to fill my cannoli, then grab my cookie and whatever a paragina is. She came back and proudly announced that she'd given me a piece of tiramisu.\\n\\nI trekked back and had a bite of each (and instinctually finished the cannoli) and was immediately full, still having 90% of my food left for later. For ten bucks! Amazing!\\n\\nThe cannoli was extremely fresh and delicious; the best I've had, so so so creamy. The black and white cookie was impossibly light; even the frosting was nice and airy. As for the paragina and the tiramisu, I'm still just not that into spongy cakes soaked in liquid, but for what it was, it was well-done.\\n\\nSo am I a convert?

I'll explain in a moment!\\n\\nOn a rainy Saturday, after a good workout at the gym, this name was brought up as the choice to attempt to fill our hungry appetites. I've had this place bookmarked and was just looking for an opportunity to go, well I guess this was the day. Located in the former Caf√© R√©galade spot along 4th and MacDonald, it wasn't too hard to find, and also was not too hard to find free parking (it's all along the street). We came in, and it reminded me of other French-like bistros around Vancouver... black-boards found with special items on the menu, and their regular servings, a very open and comfortable space, plenty of room for you and your party, also a place where you can come as you are.... as we just came from the gym you can only imagine how we were dressed!!\\n\\nAs my friend has some affixiation for pho, I already knew right from looking at the menu what he was going to order... so Pho Bo it was. I, on the other hand decided to go as light as possible, the omelette, no fancy names, just a description of what was in it... 2 eggs, mixed mushrooms, fresh herbs, potato and salad.... and then the waitress asked me if I would like to add cheese to that... Swiss Chees, yeah sure take my money! My friend had to add extras to his order.... like a side of sausage (and let the party begin!). There is a nice selection for brunch at this place, from the stuff you can sit down and order... to a portion that says 'Grab & Go' (sandwichs you can eat on the run)... and not sides.. but what they call small orders... one of those was the tube of meat that was ordered.\\n\\nWhen our orders came.. mine first, it was nicely presented on a crisp white plate, a little browned on the omelette, with some green leafy salad on one side... the hash mildly hidden under the egg, a nice big piece of French bread on the side, and some special sauce. My friends order of pho came not too long afterwards, and once his came.. I decided to stick a fork in it and to my surprise this was one tasty omelette. Good thing I ordered the additional cheese (yummy gooey cheese)... as what else could be a better combination of mushrooms and cheese on a rainy hungry day! Like biting into a melt, the soft bites of nicely sliced mushrooms, and stringy cheese is like evil comfort food, and an omelette that was not runny by any extent, but still moist.. hard to explain, but the whole package just made my day.\\n\\nI viewed my friend, who was wolfing down his soupy bowl was giving me the thumbs up on his dish...and urging to share his side order of sausage with me... (this sounds all wrong.. but oh well!) so I had half, this wasn't your cheap breaklist link sausage... more like a full sized one you would be serving up on the BBQ. We were stuffed, and satisfied, as the service was great on this day... the coffee's kept on being topped up with more morning motor oil, and the water glasses constantly topped off. I would think of coming back, maybe to try their dinner menu, I know my friend came back the next day to repeat his order (that good huh.. maybe I will try you next!).\\n\\nSo the story with the first line is this.... right when I was about to leave, after finishing up paying the bill.... there are metal bars up front that I leaned on.. and somehow they dislodged, creating a big bang, bringing the bar done crashing onto the table and tipping over the filled water glass.

And once you get there, the place is usually packed.  Fortunately for me, I learned how to duck and weave through the crowd to get to the front of the pack, because unless they've changed things at Mike's it's not first come first serve, it's more like whoever's at the front first gets served first.

They don't have an overwhelming number of selections on their menu, but everything that they do prepare is really quite good. I'm not a person who can tolerate a huge amount of hot flavors, so the \\"cool\\" version of their meat is just that -- no hot flavor. However, I could handle the warm quite well and  really enjoyed it. Some other people in the group I went with had the hot -- those were people who could usually tolerate spicy foods, but they felt that the hot was pushing it in terms of heat level. I can't imagine what the holy must be like! I give a 5 stars for their chicken. \\n\\nI also had subbed their waffles (instead of bread), because...chicken and waffles are awesome. I also got their traditional sides that come with a meal, mac & cheese and cole slaw. I normally don't like cole slaw, but thought that Hot Chicken Takeover's version was pretty good, not too heavy and mayo-y, not too vinegar-y either. The mac & cheese was alright. Waffles were decent taste-wise, but mine were kinda cold and hard, but the maple syrup was fantastic. Sweet tea was not as sweet as the usual Southern sweet tea I've had before, but that was quite welcome because I'm totally okay not drinking my entire day's sugar in one cup. \\n\\nBe prepared to wait in line; however, we went during peak brunch/lunch hours on a weekend, and the line moves pretty quickly and we only waiter about 25 minutes to order, then 10-15 minutes for the food itself.

This is the same familiar food I had growing up in Brazil. The flavors remind me of times past, and there is absolutely no other restaurant in the US (Brazilian or otherwise) that had the same effect on me.\\n\\nFirst the bad: it is hard to spot on a rundown strip mall on the back of Universal Blvd. First time we went, we were afraid we made a mistake going there. Second, it is tiny, about 6 tables or so, and you may need to wait 1 hour or more to get in (although the owners/servers will bring you drinks and appetizers while you wait on the chairs outside) - no reservations taken. Lastly, the hours: they are only opened for lunch. If you are a local, it should not be a problem, but if you are a tourist in town for the parks, it breaks your day (considering you also may have a long wait).\\n\\nNow for the reasons of the 5 stars: the food, the food, the food, the food and the service! The food is divine, typical home cooking from family gatherings in Brazil. The portions are huge - 2 can share one plate, or if you want to get more for yourself, share with a kid! I eat one by myself just because it is sooo good! The servers are attentive and very nice. I speak the language, so I don't know how an English or Spanish speaker would fare, though - the menus and boards are bilingual, but the restaurant is clearly focused towards Brazilian locals and tourists missing their hometown food.\\n\\nI wish they stay in business forever - they are our required stop in town besides the visit to the parks."},{"name":"The Living Room","address":"101 Atlantic Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Went here for a birthday party and found the staff very accommodating and friendly.

However, the staff allowed us to use all the tables and couches in our area, giving us the space and freedom to mingle, order drinks, and order food.  It was great!  I hate going to a party at a restaurant, sitting on the outside of the conversation, and never getting to really chat with the birthday girl/boy, the real person I came to see!  This eliminated that frustration.\\n\\nI definitely recommend the quesadilla.  It sounds simple, but comes out piping hot with cheese oozing from the sides and has generous helpings of veggies and, if you so choose, your meat of choice.  The angus cheeseburger was a little boring unfortunately, but I liked that they gave you a smaller menu on top of their normal dinner menu that allowed you to choose several plates so you can share.

And this business about bad service because the gratuity was included is just plain ludicrous.  18% on $1.50 is less than .30 a person, because the majority of you guys were cheap asses anyway that just ordered water.  So I hardly doubt, your 4.00 tip total was even close to being enough to deal with a group of negative nancys like yourselves!  Maybe you guys should go out and experience a real dinner  on a standard night and write a real review, so people can get an accurate depiction of this restaurant and not a skewed reality because you had to wait a little longer to be cheap asses. maybe they should rename it national cheapass night."}]`),H={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:z},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:6,poemsData:O,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.poemsData.filter(n=>{const e=this.searchQuery.toLowerCase();return n.name.toLowerCase().includes(e)||n.city.toLowerCase().includes(e)||n.text.toLowerCase().includes(e)}).slice(0,this.visibleCount):this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},j={class:"search-container"},D={class:"card-container"},E=["disabled"],N={key:0},R={key:1};function L(n,e,s,f,i,r){const c=p("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"üéâ Restaurant Reviews ü•≥")])],-1)),t("div",j,[e[2]||(e[2]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"üîç",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=h=>i.searchQuery=h),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[v,i.searchQuery]])]),t("div",D,[(a(!0),o(y,null,m(r.filteredPoems,(h,g)=>(a(),k(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),r.hasMorePoems?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:i.isLoading,onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=(...h)=>r.loadMore&&r.loadMore(...h))},[i.isLoading?(a(),o("span",R,"Loading...")):(a(),o("span",N,"See more"))],8,E)):w("",!0)])}const F=u(H,[["render",L],["__scopeId","data-v-b322014d"]]),V=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"people/67.md","filePath":"people/67.md"}'),G={name:"people/67.md"},Y=Object.assign(G,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(a(),o("div",null,[I(F)]))}});export{V as __pageData,Y as default};
