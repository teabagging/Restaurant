My cocktails were made wonderfully and consistently every time I had one served to me.\\n2. Quality of the food is excellent. We all indulged on appetizers, different entrees and desserts. The Creme Br√ªl√©e was fantastic. My only qualm was that my NY strip ordered rare (lcool and red center) was served on the higher end of medium, center almost hot and pink throughout. It was however well seasoned and delicious. However, taking into account the flow of service from the waitstaff, and how all of our meals arrived to the table at the same time, it wasn't something at that point that I'd make noise about.\\n3. Erin and Dan served our party that evening, both were polite, professional, well groomed and well versed on their menu and specials that evening. They were also attentive to my shellfish allergy. My only qualm was that they were a little hard to track down for a water refill or for a new cocktail. However, as referenced above, they were managing a large group of very different personalities, and doing an excellent job of it, so I managed to not care either way.\\n4. The manager visited us to see how our meal was going. I can't stress that enough. Restaurants in which managers don't visit the table at least once are not restaurants that focus on quality of service. Thumbs up to One Bistro for SHOWING they are interested in our business, it's becoming more and more rare in the hospitality business.\\n\\nAt the end of the experience, the entire group was well taken care of, had full bellies and we all had a great time in a restaurant that had excellent and comfortable ambience.

It ain't cheap, and it wasn't quick, but boy was it good. Let's start with the space. KRS is almost the anti-thesis of the original Rathbun's. Whereas Rathbun's is an open space, with plenty of light, KRS sports dark wood paneling, dark color tones, and little overhead light. For a steakhouse, this masculine feel not only works, but for me, is a necessity. It tells me they take their beef seriously.\\n\\nKRS offers a different approach to the cold seafood tower appetizer. Unlike places like Chops, where they price the appetizer at a flat rate per person, you create your own tower at KRS. Each seafood item is priced around $8-9 dollars making it more financially feasible than the strict per person charge. You don't get as much food, but if you are about to indulge on a 21oz. bone-in ribeye, do you really need more? Our group of three had a tower of shrimp (3 jumbo shrimp), ahi tuna sashimi (5-6 pieces) and hamachi sashimi (5-6 pieces). There could have been an extra shrimp or two for $9, but I was not at all disappointed with the sashimi quantity (or quality).\\n\\nThe menu is fairly traditional for a steakhouse. A good selection of seafood and non-steak items. The sides are a la carta, but the quantity is not like other steakhouses where one side is good for 2 people. For the three of us, we had 2 sides and we probably could have gone for a third. One interesting note on the sides- the twice baked potato is listed as \\"Market Price\\", which led of us to ask what has happened to the price of potatoes lately to warrant market pricing.\\n\\nBut let's face it, the real reason you come to a place like this is for the steaks. KRS offers multiple choices here including two dry aged porterhouses- one for 2 people and one for 4 people. I couldn't even think about what this beast looks like on a plate. Two of us went with the 12 oz filet (a 6 oz version is also available), while one friend went with the bone-in ribeye. You have your choice of various sauces for your steaks. My choice- the peppercorn au poivre- was served in a side dish so you can regulate how much you wish to use. My filet was outstanding- a great cut of meat that I could have cut with a butter knife.\\n\\nI am already planning my next trip to Kevin Rathbun Steak. My anniversary is at the end of the month, and since Lady Steakhead didn't join us last night, this would be a great occasion to introduce her to it. I probably better my make my reservations now, though. If it's anything like Rathbun's, weekend reservations at KRS will be hard to come by.\\n\\nSteakhead Recommends: Yes\\nPrice: $$$$"},{"name":"Hit The Spot Cafe","address":"5121 Albert Brown Rd","city":"Garfield","stars":"4.5","text":"A real texas gem.

It's consistently good. The steaks are excellent. I typically get the 6 ounce filet, medium, and it's always delicious. I've added peppercorn sauce, garlic butter, and, tonight, simply au jus. Perfection. The atmosphere is urban, romantic, and, yes, loud. Diners, many I assume are on business accounts, are enjoying the conversation as much as the food. Even if dining alone at the bar, as some of us were tonight, it feels cozy and comfortable. The sides vary by personal taste. I think the seasonal options are best -  brussel sprouts in the fall, asparagus in the spring. I've had the jalape√±o creamed corn, which is delectable. Tonight, I had the scalloped sweet potatoes with gueryere. I could barely taste the sweet potatoes. It was a very heavy, greasy side dish. I wouldn't  order next time. Again, a matter of taste. If price is a consideration, go to Rathbun's on a special occasion. Dinner for two (steak and one side each, which you can share) and a couple of glasses of wine each will run you about $175 with a 20 percent tip. That doesn't include appetizers, salad, dessert or a tip to the car valet. That would easily be over $200 for a couple.

Unfortunately I was not very hungry due to a weekend of stuffing myself with junkfood, so I really only nibbled at a few things.\\n\\nHowever!  My scant nibbles proved to be exceptionally tasty.  The fried pita chips were crisp on the outside, yet soft on the inside,  Fresh, delicately seasoned and not terribly greasy.  If I hadn't already been enormously full I could have easily inhaled a large portion of them.  And they are definitely large portions; one order of chips and hummus is enough for 2-3 people.  Speaking of hummus, I did sample the avocado hummus, which was really delicious.  You'd think the addition of fatty, creamy avocado might make this a little too rich, or over the top, but it still tasted light and fresh and delicious.\\n\\nMy dining companions ordered gyros and falafel sandwiches which all summarily disappeared down everyone's gullets.  I can only surmise they must enjoyed them immensely. The only complaint was that someone did not like banana peppers and \\"other pickled, vinegary crap\\" on his sandwich...but I think he probably forgot to ask them to leave it off, so I do not think that was the restaurant's fault.\\n\\nThey have a really, really wonderful soup that sits out in a cauldron in front of the counter; they leave little cups and spoons out so that one might sample it, if one is so inclined.  And we were.  And it was so amazing that we ordered 2 big containers of it to bring home with us the next day.  I may be mistaken, but I think it is a soup-y form of koshari/y, which I believe to be an Egyptian street food full of chick peas, lentils, macaroni, tomatoes and lots of wonderful spices.  They serve it with a tangy house made hot-sauce that really just elevates what is already a fantastic dish to an entirely new level.  I highly, highly recommend it.\\n\\nThe waitstaff was friendly (VERY friendly), the establishment looked clean, and yes, as one other reviewer mentioned, there is some interesting, albeit rather confusing wall-art.

The horchata was very milky from the starch of the rice and very high in almond flavor. The limonada was fresh, a little on the sweeter side and refreshing. The tortillas were the real standout; perfectly warm, tender, delicious. These are the tortillas that all other tortillas aspire to be and I might even say better than my grandmothers. The sope was really well fried and held up until the end of the meal and the amount of crema fresca was not overbearing. Meats were delicious and the filling size was pretty large, I'd say about 2oz per taco. In order of my favorites- al pastor, lengua de rez (beef tongue), barbacoa de chivo (goat cheek), carnitas. Al pastor had a lovely charred burned flavor, the lengua was silky soft and cut into big nonfatty chunks, the chivo was incredibly flavorful, the carnitas were tasty and soft though not my favorite variety and not something I would order again with a plethora of other options.  \\n\\nI like that you get to add on as much cilantro and onion as you like and the firey green sauce at the table was on the cusp of crack addiction.

Boy, am I glad I didn't give up! This is the closest I've had yet. I ordered the tonkotsu shoyu ramen, which comes in two sizes. I ordered a small, and halfway through found myself wishing I'd gone for the large.\\n\\nSo what makes this ramen worth coming back for? I've got three reasons: 1) the broth. Rich, sweet, succulent and porky. Closer than anything I've yet had to the stuff I used to get in Tokyo, which I recall was a borderline religious experience. 2) the noodles. Shigezo makes their own noodles, and it's a small but crucial difference. They have a good, firm bite and don't sit like a pile of rocks in your stomach. 3) the cha-shu pork. This is the one area that I didn't have particularly high hopes in, but Shigezo delivered in spades. The single thick slice falls apart at the merest prod of a chopstick, and has none of the dry, chemically-induced blandness that so many local ramen shops seem unable to avoid.\\n\\nMy one gripe tonight is that service was a bit slow- but this was probably due to the restaurant being near full capacity with not enough staff.

Granted the tile floor is old, but it could do with a good scrub. A sweeping would help.  And the stools at the sushi bar are in need of good cleaning. But all was forgotten when our ramen appeared.  I had the Okinawa noodles.  Delicious. Not salty and full of flavor. I could find no fault with the food. Granted I'm not a ramen expert but I know what I like!  My companion had the Tokyo ramen with a hard boiled egg and cabbage. As expected, with a soy sauce infused broth, it was a bit salty for my taste but he said it was wonderful.

I read many of them and  decided to go there tonight. I thought the service was great this evening. We didn't have a reservation, but at 7pm on a Saturday night we put our name and cell # down and were called back within 20 minutes. Of course they had about 12 tables out on the sidewalk so it's probably a bit easier than in the winter.  We ordered the Antipasto Italiano which is a very large appetizer so we hardly had room for dinner.  It had squash, tomatoes, mushrooms, roasted red peppers, lots of salmon, and some sort of large white bean. I could eat just that for dinner. I wish we'd only ordered one of the pasta dishes after that instead of one each -- oh well, i have a great lunch for tomorrow!  The Penne all'Arrabbiata was good, but I wish it had some veggies in it. The red pepper flakes made it nice and spicy.  The Spaghetti Mare e Monti is a pesto dish with shrimp and mushrooms. I wouldn't change a thing on that dish. With a half a carafe of wine, an appetizer and two dinners, the bill was $54.  One downside is that I thought maybe I'd catch the Timbers game on the TVs there, but they just show Fox Soccer News. (Ordinarily I hateTVs in establishments, but when the Timbers are playing that's a different story.)

A college friend of hers and the friends husband live in Boston and recommended this restaurant to us and met us there.  We are from Charleston, SC so we understand the hospitality industry, world class restaurants, and world class fresh seafood.  Especially oysters.\\n\\nThe Good: The service was 5-Star  and the staff and upper management should be proud of themselves on this regard.  From the moment we walked in it was a first class experience.\\n\\nThe Average: The Food.  Oysters are Oysters.  We tried 3 different varieties and there is nothing the cooks could do about this.  They were shucked properly, easy to eat, and had all of the appropriate accouterments.  We all had different entrees from monkfish, salmon, cod, and the special (forgot what that was).  It was all cooked properly.  It all tasted good but I'm a little over a week away from eating there and I can't remember anything distinct about our meal.  For a meal on vacation I expect something to WOW me---or at least make me want to tell someone about  it.  That didn't happen.\\n\\nThe Bad: PRICE.\\nListen, when I'm on vacation and looking for a memorable meal I have no problem dropping a good amount  of dough.  Dinner, Apps, Drinks for 2 I fully expected  to spend upwards of $150.  Neither of us are big drinkers but definitely like to try signature cocktails at good restaurants.  \\n\\nI can't remember everybody else's meals so I'll just replay mine.\\n\\nWe got to the restaurant before the other 2 in our party so we went to the bar for a drink.  I ordered a simple Vodka and Soda.  The house vodka was $10.  TEN DOLLARS FOR A SHOT OF HOUSE VODKA.  I've dined at world renowned 5-star restaurants and paid an arm and a leg for wine, specialty cocktails, and entrees but I don't think I've ever been charged $10 for a shot of house vodka.  I know it was a shot because the bartender measured it out.  That is another problem I have.   If I'm spending $10 for house vodka you better give me a legit pour.  At a place like this the bartender is either  a career bartender or has the skill set to be a career bartender.  If they are that good at their job then trust them to pour from the bottle and not in a shot measure.  Give them the authority and leeway to hookup a simple Vodka/Soda.\\n\\nI would have liked to order a bottle of wine but my palette is not sophisticated when it comes to wine.  We usually pick a bottle of $30 wine and enjoy it.  Most restaurants, even upscale ones have some sort of economy wine for the non-snobs.  I don't remember seeing anything under $60.\\n\\nI ordered the Monkfish which was around $30.  This is not an outrageous price however monkfish is not an expensive fish and not of the additions were exotic products.  I believe they could have priced this at $22 and still made a healthy margin on it.\\n\\nLastly this restaurant has no dedicated  bathrooms.  In order to use the bathroom you have to go to the hotel that is attached which is up a flight of stairs and is not comfortable when you are spending a long evening eating and drinking.\\n\\n------------\\n\\nI want to praise the service and hospitality again.  While egregiously overpriced the the money that goes back in to training and service is the one place where there is value.  \\n\\nI look forward to another trip to Boston but I won't be dining at The Island Creek Oyster House.

The food is so deliciously flavored and well-prepared that I felt I was back in SE Asia, and what's more, it is home to probably the only affordable James Beard Award-winning chef in the world, Andy Ricker. I especially appreciate the care that is taken to create traditional accompaniments such as fresh herbs, pickled vegetables and bread, which are a standard part of every eatery in Thailand and Vietnam. The cocktails are equally superb and the bartenders seem to enjoy their craft. All said, this place is legitimately awesome.\\n\\nThat is why I am bothered by certain elements of recent reviews which I now feel compelled to address. First, the chicken wings that people criticize for being 6 for $12 are crazy good. The flavor is explosive and the wings are whole, meaning you get 12 wings worth, but they're just not all hacked up American style. The meat is also naturally raised for those of us who like to eat meat responsibly. Finally, you can order them spicy and if you're a person who really likes the spice, then you have to indicate \\"Thai spicy\\" so they don't think you're just an adventurous New England-er.\\n\\nAnother person commented on the menu restrictions between 2 - 5pm daily. Yes, they do serve a limited menu to allow for dinner prep, however it is NOT limited to only TWO items, NO JOKE. There are more like six or seven very delicious items on that menu, but certainly try to arrive during the peak lunch and dinner hours for the full experience.\\n\\nFinally, people of Yelp, please do not negatively review a place based on your singular experience. Think before you write, what is your purpose? For example, if you sat outside on a cold day, do not say that the ambiance was uncomfortable because patrons have to sit outside. There is an indoor section as well and it is very comfortable - and bug-free! Let's remember the point of Yelp when crafting our reviews, and certainly not be flat out untruthful. This will benefit all of us, business owners and patrons alike."},{"name":"Powell's City of Books","address":"1005 W Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"This place is downright AMAZING.\\nFew experiences in the real (non-digital) world allow you to explore that childlike feeling of overwhelming curiosity in a physical setting among other people that feel the same way... this may simply be the best.\\n\\nEven with all the expectations coming into this place, I was still blown away and an estimated half hour visit turned into a full 3 hours... and this is coming from someone that does regularly consume information/stories in book form.

So we decided on Kevin Rathbun Steakhouse, this was all unplanned and we were hungry!!! The service was OK but the food is not at all a fine dine type. The collard greens that my cousin ordered was very, very salty and I'm not exaggerating. The salmon we ordered was cooked the way we like it but the sauce for it was way too salty as well. Our steak was cook the right temperature we wanted but the only problem was for some reason it was very burnt at the top. Since we wasn't dressed the way we should've by the way the restaurant is set up as fine dinning, we sensed a feeling that we were looked down apon and kind of judgmental. Mind you that this was all unplanned and unexpected so we decided to go anyways because we were hungry. Another thing I didn't like is, I guessed because of the way we were dressed, I asked the server which red wine he would prefer for us and he pointed out  the cheapest bottle and said this was more in our price range, which was $56 by the way, so I decided to go with $150 bottle instead. He gave me that look like, \\"are you sure\\". I'm not very picky and don't complain too much, I should've complained last night but like I said the way we dressed would've said it all. It would've looked like, to me, that it would've been expected for us to complain so I kept it to myself. The money was not an issue for us, its just that the food was not worth for what we paid, I even tip the waiter $100 and that dumb on my part. I'm highly upset about the food and like I said I'm not a picky person but that restaurant from my experience was not worth it, I'd rather go to Burger King than to go to that restaurant again, sorry guys but I had to do this. I wish it didn't have to come down to this but it had to be done, I never wrote a bad review online before about anything so this will be my first one.

The hostess said they texted and having a problem with the text program. So they gave our table away. If you know you are having a problem with the system you use, couldn't you come out and look for your customer outside- we weren't even far from the main entrance of the restaurant. Or they couldn't simply call me? That was kinda iffy but was ok. \\n\\nThe service: our waitress was sweet. Drinks took a while to be served because the bartender was done with her/his shift. Food runners were kinda rude. Came out of nowhere, and sliding our food on the table without saying anything- not even eye contacts/ saying hello. She slided our food on the table as if we were peasants. You are buying the dining experience not just paying for foods when you are in a restaurant.

Good chance to learn some culinary skills. And it's great to hear him bicker with the salty waitress that may have been there since it opened. It seemed that they got the tables into a rotation so that they would seat all 7 or 8 tables at the same time, then after taking orders and cooking, the chef would then go on his smoking break out front on the street in front of the waiting line of people for like a half hour while everyone ate, then return when the people paid and left and started the process all over again.

Delicious food, but highly overrated.  Would it be worth it to wait in line for the chicken wings?  No.  Luckily for my friends and I there was no line that day.  We were seated within 10 minutes.  Score!  If there was a line, we would've headed over to the sister restaurant (Whiskey Soda Lounge) across the street.  They serve the same food with no wait in line. \\n\\n----------FOOD - Delicious, but overpriced---------\\n1) Water- Most delicious water I've had.  It had a hint of either rice or coconut.\\n\\n2) Ike's Vietnamese Fish Sauce Wings - Tastiest dish here imo.  We should've only ordered this dish.  Medium spice was perfect.  The chicken was savory and the sauce on the wings wasn't overwhelming.  However, the cucumber slices on the dish were not fresh.  You can tell they were left out for a long while as they were dried and wrinkled. We had to ask for new slices.\\n\\n3) Pork Belly Curry - Pork was flavorful and tender, but I wish more pork pieces were given.  I think there was only about 5/6 pieces.  What I did in the end was throw rice in to soak up the curry.  Delicious!\\n\\n4) Sunny's Yam Wun Sen- Spicy glass noodle dish with bits of nem (raw meat).  It was an ok dish. Good, but not memorable.  I wouldn't reorder this dish.\\n\\n----------SERVICE----------\\nTruthfully this is what caused the low rating.  The service sucks. Not only did they mess up my friend's drink order, it took forever to get our food (over half an hour for 4 dishes). Even the table next to us left, had the table bused and a new party seated after 15 minutes.  That new party still received their food before ours.   I believe they forgot our order.  Our server knew that we didn't get our food in a timely matter, too.  We didn't have to bring it up because they brought us shrimp chips to munch on.  Yeeeea... nothing like a few cents worth of shrimp chips to turn our favor around. Jeez....\\n\\nLastly, dishes aren't cleaned very well, so make sure to check yours before eating.  Two dishes at the table had bits of food still stuck to the plates.  Blegh.  \\n\\nOverall, between 4 dishes, our total was about $70... Kind of pricey for viet/thai food.

We ordered our drinks, guacamole, and then our entrees, Baja fish tacos and barbacoa enchiladas. Guacamole was great and full of flavor. But, it took roughly 1.5 hrs to receive our entrees  to which we didn't finish because the tacos were somewhat cold, bland, and flavorless. The beef barbacoa was very salty but was very hot (temperature wise). My guess is that the kitchen didn't get our ticket completed at the same time. Also, the tacos were to be accompanied by beans and rice, but they ran out of rice. \\n\\nWe requested our check from our server and I guess we were noticeably disappointed with the food. So our server requested for us to speak with the manager. We initially declined but our server urged us to give him honest feedback. So we did and the manager was very kind to comp our entrees.

I went around to the back of the bar because there was no one else back there, so I wouldn't bother anyone else by changing the TV. Bartender said he'd have someone change it right away. After about ten minutes it still wasn't on, so I asked him again and he acted like it was the first time he'd ever seen me, but again said he'd get it switched. Another five minutes with no change, I asked another bar tender, who also said he'd change it and took off around the corner, then came back a few minutes later and still no change. Asked a third bartender a few minutes later, same story. Service for food/drinks was equally bad, I sat there for several minutes at the bar before they even acknowledged me to take my drink order, I had to ask twice to get a food menu and after I did it took them another 10-15 minutes to get back to me to take my order, took them a very long time to clear my empty plate and refill my beer.  The staff pretty much couldn't have cared less that I was there; I was just an annoyance to them. \\n\\nThe food was mediocre. The Reuben was pretty good, no complaints there, but the fries were lukewarm and soggy when they got to me, and don't think they would have been that good even if they were fresh. \\n\\nI won't be going back; there are too many other good sports bars in the area to put up with the terrible service at this place."},{"name":"Powell's City of Books","address":"1005 W Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"The people who work at Powell's have great spirit and I have always had kind and thoughtful interactions with them; this means a lot.

I went for Sunday Brunch when it was $26 for an all you can eat buffet. Moonshine has various rooms and a couple of patios. There were stations throughout the building and in one of the patios. The buffet featured meats, Southern comfort food, and breakfast foods including breakfast burritos and pastries. There was a large selection and variety. I loved some things, liked others, and did not care for some of it. The three exceptional items were the leg of lamb, prime rib, and red velvet pancakes. In my opinion, those three things made the price of admission worth it. The lamb was cooked perfectly and tender. One of recurring issues I have with lamb is it can be gamey. It was not an issue at Moonshine. The prime rib was amazing. It was tender and marinated perfectly. The red velvet pancakes were also delicious. They had great chocolatey flavor and the perfect soft yet solid texture for a pancake. Next, the buttermilk biscuits were great. I also thought the pecan Danishes and deviled eggs were excellent. Again, it is a buffet on Sunday so you can try a little bit of everything and figure out what you like. One of the items I was disappointed in were the kolaches, which were really pigs in a blanket masquerading as kolaches. Nevertheless, Moonshine was a great spot for Sunday Brunch. Definitely get some sweet tea too. It was sweet but not a sugar bomb. Not surprisingly, Moonshine gets really busy on Sunday for brunch. I went there when it opened at 9 AM and did not have to wait in line. You are probably fine if you get there between 9-9:30 AM. When I finished and left after 10 AM, the line outside was long.\\n\\nIf you are visiting and planning a trip to Austin and looking for recommendations, feel free to message me for my itinerary.

But I'd probably take my business elsewhere.\\n\\nI was hoping that the store wouldn't be as pricey as it was. Almost everything was full price and the used books were more expensive than what we could get at Half-Price Books (oh how I wish there was one in Portland). My friend likes to read weird old sci-fi stuff and when he finds a book that was published several decades ago and sold for $3, you'd still find that book for $1.50 at Half-Price. At Powell's, they sell the same book for $4.50. And there are definitely better deals to be had on new books at Amazon. I still ended up paying over $75 in books despite knowing all this and I'm happy with my purchases, but I have learned for the future.\\n\\nPlus, the employees were kind of jerks. I find the people in Portland to be generally nicer as a whole than those in DFW, but srsly. My friend put his basket of books on the counter and the cashier was all, \\"Please put your books on the lower shelf *LIKE THE SIGN SAYS*,\\" totally snotty. The sign, by the way, is against that lower shelf, far out of line of sight of a fairly tall dude. You know how they put the kiddie cereals down at the bottom and the gross adult cereals at the top? Well, that's how I end up buying Grape Nuts instead of Lucky Charms (sigh) and if we were six, we probably would have seen it.

After about 12-15 more mins, we received our food.  The penne was fine, but the fra diavalo had hot sauce but cold to a little warm seafood.........This left us feeling like the same seafood from our incorrect meal was just used again in our new meal.

My father LOVES the Illuminations fireworks display and refused to miss the fireworks on account of poor restaurant management.\\n\\nThe manager sat us immediately at a table overlooking the lake. He informed us that we were welcome to stay as long as we liked, so that we could watch the fireworks display while eating dessert. We enjoyed an EXTREMELY delicious meal, but the incompetence we had to deal with in order to receive that meal put a damper on the evening. As we left the restaurant, we noticed that people we had been waiting with were STILL waiting for a table... another forty-five minutes later!!!\\n\\nThe food was authentic and memorable, so I would like to return someday.

We opted for the counter instead of a table, which probably helped, and we enjoyed being able to see into the kitchen. \\n\\nOur server was very patient with explaining the menu to us and her recommendations. We each ordered a pork belly bun; hubby got spicy miso, and I got traditional miso and added a half-boiled egg. \\n\\nThe pork belly buns were so good. I thought they were good on their own, but my husband enjoyed his with each of the three sauces they delivered to our spot. The pork slices were decently-thick and bigger than the buns; the little slices of cucumber helped to cut the saltiness of the pork. These were executed better than what I've had in Chicago. \\n\\nOkay, on to ramen. The noodles were cooked to the right chew, and there was a good amount of them. The broth was well-flavored without being salty. I enjoyed the pork that came with the ramen; and the half-boiled egg was perfectly done; just the right amount of soft yolk without being too leaky, and they gave me the whole egg too! Never had that before. \\n\\nThere were a couple of issues I had. First, the broth was tasty, but not hot; closer to lukewarm. I'm not sure if this has to do with how they keep it warm in the kitchen, or if there is too much time between dishing out broth and delivery to the table, but it was a disappointment for the broth to not be hot.\\n\\n(Or...maybe it's because there's been too many lawsuits in this country from people who scald themselves because they're too careless to think that HOT soup could HURT if they drank it TOO FAST, but I digress...)\\n\\nThe other issue I had was the price of my egg. I know that they can't put all possible toppings into a bowl of ramen, which is fine. But somehow, charging $1.50 for an egg seems...well...crazy, to say the least. I mean, a $1.50 for corn is crazy, unless it's corn with special powers. But I'm not flying or wielding a big hammer yet, so I don't think the food has magical powers...\\n\\nOverall, we liked this place better than Boxer.

Guacamole is definitely one of those things that's hard to get super fresh so you can't get it any fresher than this. \\n\\nOther stuff is pretty good here too. I've only been there twice so I can't point out too many things on the menu but I can say that the Enchiladas Veracruz was pretty good although I thought that the Camaron Poblano Asada was great.

Will have to try something one of these days though since they have the usual cocktails plus an insanely long list of spirits. I've had the green chile macaroni, fried chicken salad, and their chicken fried steak across my visits here. If you're making your first visit, I would 100% go with the macaroni. The spice will surprise you, and you probably won't ever think about macaroni the same way again. I suggested that my date get it this morning, but she told me that she didn't like noodles, which is a funny thing to say when talking about macaroni. When the food got here though, I insisted she have a bite and she told me that it was one of the best things she's had recently.\\n\\nI'm sure many people make use of the valet, but I generally park on the streets about a three minute walk away. The reviews on Yelp have good things to say to about the appetizers, but I still have yet to try any since an entree will surely fill you up, especially if it's your first meal of the day.

I debated whether I was going to be seated or going to seat myself; I did the latter since it's pretty casual. The server came and took my order.\\n\\nI ordered the horchata and MIchoacana style steak under specials I believe. She came out with chips and salsa as well as a little cup of spicy noodle soup with beef (don't know what it's called). I think it's just a starter that they have for everyone, but it was delicious! The horchata was a bit sweet for me. I prefer the slightly less sweet versions, but it ended up balancing ok if you're eating spicy food. The steak came with was flavorful but might have been slightly overcooked because it was a little tough. The server didn't ask how I wanted the steak cooked either. \\n\\nI've heard the carnitas and menudo are awesome and only on the weekends.

Maybe you are craving the melted cheddar of the Adventurer or the Emperor (as well you should be - it's so good it really shouldn't be legal). Or maybe it's the tamari almonds of the Swami or the Innocent that your heart is set on tonight. Choose what you want and then swap out the elements you don't want (quinoa instead of brown rice, curry sauce instead of ginger sauce). The bottom line is, you will get a bowl of delicious vegetables and whole grains, with a plate-licking-good sauce and some magic dust mixed in. You can't go wrong -- everything is doggone good. Whenever I take the first bite, my stomach takes a little upward leap of delight, just to be able to meet the food that much faster.\\n\\nThe salads are good for summer -- perhaps not filling enough for a winter dinner, unless paired with a warm butternut squash soup or vegan chili. There is a whole range of smoothies, on the fruitier side or the ice-creamier side (a non-dairy coconut milk base). There are juices for the adventurous (including one with raw garlic, ginger, cayenne, spirulina, and apple cider vinegar, among other ingredients) and for those who want their juice to taste a little more like fruit.\\n\\nThey have interesting wines and bottled beers, including St. Bernardus ABT (_love_).\\n\\nThey are open for breakfast and offer a large selection of organic teas, as well as chicory \\"coffee\\".

Ignored after the main order was taken and left with empty wine glasses for going on 20 minutes - inexcusable.  We had half dozen oysters, shrimp cocktail, steamed clams, wild salmon, and cauliflower side.  The starters all came out relatively quickly and were terrific. Maybe I'm spoiled, but I have great oysters all the time in CA, so that's nothing to write home about.  The steamed littlenecks in a bacon and leak broth were the show piece. Shrimp cocktail was very good, but the large prawns were a bit tough and not tender. Our salmon arrived tepid at best, and my mom sent her portion back to be warmed; I decided to push on.  The cauliflower side was also cool and we sent back as well.  Salmon was delicious, but the cauliflower didn't make it back in time before we finished our meal.  When I asked the server to cancel the order and remove it from the bill, she asked \\"are you sure you don't want to take it to-go as a snack for later?\\"  HA!   Yes, sometimes when I watch tv before bed, I like to munch on some cold, take-out cauliflower....  The manager made an equally humorous comment and said \\"Well, I will take the cauliflower off the bill since you didn't get a chance to eat it, so it wouldn't be fair to pay for it.\\"  Um, you think?\\n\\nOverall experience was disappointing even though the manager seemed genuinely  conciliatory.  I couldn't bring myself to leave our smug, ineffectual server a gratuity. \\n\\nOther low points: \\n\\nWhen we arrived 30 min. before our very early reservation (at 4:45) we were told the dining room didn't open until 5:00 - ok, totally reasonable.  We asked if we could sit at one of the many empty high-tops in the bar to have a cocktail, and were told we could not be accommodated.  Interesting given how early it was, and the fact that we were clearly going to be moving onto the dining room in short order.  Ended up having amazing cocktails next door at Eastern Standard.  Poor floor management = lost revenue. \\n\\nCleverly, ICOB doesn't offer any chardonnays by the glass (it is the most popular white on the planet).  They do, however, offer chardonnays by the half bottle, and the prices for the half-bottle start around the $50 mark.  I'm sorry, but that's a ludicrous starting point for half bottles.  There's a very decent French sauvignon blanc for $11 by the glass, but I saw most tables fell into the half-bottle trap.\\n\\nInnocently, a bus boy lifted my plate with half my shrimp cocktail still sitting there, and I had to ask to please finish it.  I don't think it's always necessary to ask before clearing plates, but if half the item is still on the dish, it may be wise to ask. \\n\\nAll in all, I kept wishing I were at Hog Island Oyster Co.  http://hogislandoysters.com California is so spoiled with frutti di mare, patrons can afford to be selective and service counts."},{"name":"Rudy's \\"Country Store\\" and Bar-B-Q","address":"11570 Research Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Wow, I don't know when I have ever received such friendly, enthusiastic service.

All but one (in Brookline) of the SG restaurants are tucked into nondescript suburban strip malls, so we were glad to find it easily at the Rte 3 end of Burlington Mall Road at Middlesex Turnpike, in the plaza with Golf Galaxy and Liberty Travel. \\n\\nFrom the clean parking lot in front, the typical strip mall glass facade gave way to a surprisingly sleek, modern and attractive dining space, with one wall and high ceiling painted in vibrant red opposite a blue lava light window wall that draws children to its slo-mo upward bubbles. Must return to see it at night! The gracious and friendly hostess greeted the Saturday lunch crowd of all ages and many Chinese diners--always a good sign for good Chinese food!\\n\\nWe ordered some of our favorites (almost always the Sichuan authentic dishes, as they're the best) from the menu, in SG's standard generous portions--fresh bamboo shoots w spicy Wonder sauce; pea pod stems w garlic (the best anywhere, must-have in season); the all-time go-to dry fish fillet; lightly battered but not too salty and peppery shrimp on a bed of cool, shredded lettuce; soft tofu w napa cabbage and celery in chili sauce, and mild pork meatballs (lion's head) mixed w chopped mushrooms and napa. Should they ever offer it, I'd love to try a spicier version of the meatballs, too, the way they make two sauces for some dishes--maybe chop the mushrooms and cabbage finer, add a little shredded carrot, a bit more 5-spice powder, fish or rich soy sauce, mixed w their delicious, toothsome, short-grain brown rice? The accompanying baby bok choy was a bit undercooked this time, but that's easily remedied, as it's been perfect all other times.\\n\\nThe menu is SG's basic, but owner Li Zhong said they will eventually add new dishes as they learn this community's tastes, a practice at their other restaurants. As the Burlington location is not far from its Billerica location, it might not be too different, unless Burlington continues to attract more shoppers from the large Mall, especially for the dinner hour. Count me in when I want to avoid rush-hour traffic after an afternoon of shopping! I'm already making my list for next time--Sichuan cold noodles, chicken with napa cabbage and chili sauce, family style tofu, cellophane noodles, ma po tofu, winter's balm of fish and broccoli in spicy chili broth...\\n\\nPerhaps many ethnic restaurants are similar, but as a long-time fan of Sichuan Gourmet in Framingham and Brookline, with sojourns to Billerica, Sharon, and now Burlington, I continue to be impressed with how well the founding brothers-in-law and their families and their old friends who help staff each location have maintained the quality of their food over the years. Each location becomes a welcome neighborhood institution (not to mention the best take-out!). The managers are welcoming, and the best of their wait staffs are friendly and helpful and remember your likes and dislikes, and will accommodate individual tastes by adjusting the spiciness, etc. Finally, the affordability of these restaurants allows diners to make Sichuan Gourmet a regular dining option, rather than just a special treat, even as many of their dishes will always be special."},{"name":"Starbucks","address":"44 Main St","city":"Wayland","stars":"3.5","text":"Great starbucks... kristina was very friendly and attentive to my order...

Ceviche buzzes with life and noise -- the clank of dishes, live music and the dull roar of diners shoving their forks across the table, insisting, \\"Try this!\\"\\n \\nIt's a gorgeous space and if I lived in Orlando, I would definitely be needling The Boy into throwing our wedding reception there.\\n \\nI went with a relatively large group (10 diners) on a Friday night and I'm so glad we made reservations. The place was packed when we arrived but thanks to our reservations, we were seated immediately.\\n \\nOur server Michael was prompt, courteous and personable. The bread basket and drinks appeared quickly and like the ravenous hordes we are, we obliterated them with the quickness.\\n \\nI ordered the white sangria and those things are dangerous. They go down smooth and it's not until you're fishing out fruit chunks out of your glass that you realize you might just be a little more than buzzed. The red sangria is equally dangerous so if you're planning on ordering a pitcher -- make sure you've got a cab lined up to take you home.\\n \\nThe extensive menu is vegetarian-friendly which meant lots of delicious options for both my sister and myself. We ordered four dishes between us:\\n \\nGazpacho Andaluz - I just discovered gazpacho last year and am always on the lookout for it on menus. I've had incredible gazpacho (from Georges in Wayne, PA) and terrible gazpacho that was more salsa than soup (from Trader Joe's...I mean, Trader Quixote's). This dish fell firmly in the middle. It was a little salty and a little too well-blended for my liking (I like rustic chunks of veggies in mine), but a tasty option for a warm night. Drizzle a little olive oil in it -- trust me. \\n \\nEnsalada de la Casa - The house salad featured fresh vegetables (no wilting iceberg here) and came well-dressed in a morish honey-lemon vinaigrette. Light and tasty. Coupled with the Tortilla Espanola, this would make a perfect lunch.\\n \\nPatatas Bravas - These were actually more a combination of patatas bravas and patatas ali oli but they were delicious. We ordered the large potion, thinking it would be enough for two and were shocked by the amount of food that came out. A huge plate laden with chunks of potatoes covered in a delicious (albeit slightly salty) aioli that was more than enough for four diners.  \\n \\nBerenjenas Fritas -- I was initially hesitant about ordering this. Eggplant's tricky and I've ordered plenty of dishes that were either woefully undercooked or greasy. Also, honey as a dipping sauce? Really? However, my favorite Yelpistador, Dana H convinced me it was delicious and she was right -- paper thin, light and amazingly crispy. I could have eaten plates upon plates of the stuff. Oh and honey as a dipping sauce? The perfect accompaniment -- eggplant and honey. Who knew?\\n \\nA friend ordered the Calamares Fritos and it came with an amazing paprika aioli that I mopped up with my bread.\\n \\n$40 at Ceviche got two people four dishes (not counting the many bites that were passed around the table), a glass of white sangria, loud conversation resulting in the constant eruption of laughter and a band who had me shimmying my shoulders all night long.\\n \\nWorth every penny.\\n \\nI can't wait until I'm back in Orlando -- good food, strong drinks and raucous dinner conversation punctuated with laughter?

A lot of veggies, not enough noodles.  Now don't Get me wrong. I actually love the fact it comes with tons of veggies as I enjoy them. And most places don't put enough!  But sometimes I like a nice forkful of noodles and with this dish, its not possible.  Having the noodles all broken up makes it even more difficult to get a forkful of noodles as well.

This is not the place for that. I was a little disappointed when we walked in. It does not look like a \\"cafe\\". It looks more like takeout deli.

The owner was very hospitable and accommodating. He clearly takes pride in his business, his food. and really wanted to make us happy. Three of us ordered breakfast items and one ordered lunch.  I ordered the Mediterranean Omelette. The omelette had super fresh, perfectly saut√©ed veggies (spinach, peppers, & onions) as well as touches of feta and olives that were not too overwhelming. I usually hate when diners put too much cheese in omelets.  Pretty reasonable for $7.99!  Husband enjoyed his Gyro Omelet. I do not usually eat home fries but these were crisp and not greasy at all.  13 year old's waffles were each a little small but there were three of them. 12 year old ordered a Lamb Kabob. It came with rice, pita, and a small hummus.  I did not try the lamb but my son loved it. I did try the hummus which was flavorful but a little on the thin side. \\n\\nI like the varied menu at Reunion Cafe which includes breakfast, deli sandwiches, salads, kabobs, flat breads, butter chicken, tandoori chicken, falafel, and desserts. The owner himself made all of our food so it was not really fast. I would not recommend coming here if you are in a rush.

At some other locations, I've seen them list what the flavor of the oyster is like (i.e. more salty, more fruity, etc).  We had 4 different kinds and all were great.  Definitely fresh.\\n\\nFor other apps, we had fried clams and oyster sliders.  The clams were pretty good but not outstanding - I think their batter is not airy enough.  The best app was definitely the oyster slider?  That was so delicious.  The burger bun was a home made bread and the inside was a fried oyster instead of meat.  There was 1 picked veggie in it that gave just the right amount of tang.  This is a must try!\\n\\nFor entrees, I had the lobster roe noodles.  That was good.  But I wished I could taste more roe flavor in the noodles.  Husband had the Monkfish.  Both were pretty good dishes but I didn't get the WOW factor from these as I did with the oyster slider.  The portions are on the smaller side as well.\\n\\nWe had the cookies and milk for dessert.  I love the way they did the milk.

I showed up (sober) at 12:49am on a Friday night and was told that nobody was allowed in. I asked Kelsey (the woman running the door) what the normal time for cutoff was at this venue, in case I ever made plans to return (I'm new to town), and she said, \\"Right now\\". I respectfully inquired a bit further and asked if 12:49 or 12:30 was the cutoff time, and that I was here to meet a large group already inside. She was clearly not happy to deal with me and answered less than pleasantly before walking away to shut the door - as if I was preparing to run inside or something. I understand the struggle door staff go through later in the night, but all sense of courtesy and service was lost with her. Unfortunately, her attitude is the kind that instigates conflict and escalates situations further than they need to be (as I witnessed with the next few groups that had the misfortune of hearing the bad news with her attitude). After a small huddle of people started forming sharing their disdain - another staff member, Chris, took notice and came over to iron things out.

He explained that once the ID scanner was brought inside, they could no longer accept new guests. It totally made sense and everyone was satisfied with the explanation. It's unlikely that I'll return here on my own accord; based off their work uniform - it seemed that Kelsey was some kind of management.

Also among my favorites is the raw platter for 4, which I usually whorf down myself. It features oysters, clams, a sashimi like dish, lobster, and shrimp. \\nThe people here are like family to me, and the more I go there, the more I learn that it is this attitude and passion for creating relationships with people and sharing the joys of fine dining and drinking that have propelled ICOB to be one of the best restaurants in Boston. The owners are always on the floor, delivering oysters and taking the time to get to know the people who join them every evening. The bartenders are amazing and have a sense of urgency while still being engaged and making you feel like you are the only person at the bar. This is an establishment that really focuses on old school values in service.

The servers have to wear this rather gaudy off-the-shoulder traditional silk outfit that reminds me of a figure skating get-up, but I guess it is classy even though it looks uncomfortable. I'd prefer to wear all-black and long sleeves when heaving heavy plates brimming with bubbling sauces and the like, but maybe that's why I never waitressed. I already received my share of arm burns working over the concession stand making popcorn with cheap oil and smelling like pure fat.\\n\\nThe servings are large and eminently shareable. We only waited about 15 minutes for the courses to emerge, and they came quickly thereafter. Not all of them come with rice, and you have a choice of jasmine or coconut. One of my dining companions liked the seafood curry sauce so much (well, she also liked the seafood that came with the sauce and so I did not have much access to this dish over the course of the evening), so she announced twice that she planned to take it home. She was marking her territory and claim, if that's possible in the sauce realm--I guess so. They obliged and packed her a little styrofoam container with the inch of remaining sauce in it. I was reminded of Bikram yoga founder Bikram Choudhury who bragged that women would spend $1 million for one drop of his sperm. I have never encountered so much sauce territorialism as I did today with the seafood curry.\\n\\nOne petty thing I didn't like was the restrooms are single-stall and some lady before me was on a date, so my bladder nearly burst standing in the narrow hallway as she adjusted her face and arranged her hair prior to re-emerging oblivious to the urinary tract infection she was giving me.

The name Ceviche derives from an age-old Peruvian dish that consists of a citrus marinated seafood salad.  It is a Latin American delicacy which consists of white fish, octopus, shrimp and chunks of tuna or crab. The marinade used in ceviche serves a dual purpose, to cook and to season.  The citrus based liquid the fish soaks in consists mainly of lemons and limes to pickle or to \\"cook\\" the fish without heat . This unique way of preparing the seafood allows it to remain tender and succulent. \\n   \\nThis unique Spanish restaurant that originally opened in 1997 in Tampa Bay, Florida has already been voted 'Top Twenty New Restaurants in Florida' by Florida Trend Magazine.  So needless to say my palate was piqued and dying to feast from its overwhelming menu that offers an impressive 100 different hot and cold Latin tapas (in the $6 to $12 range) as well as paella and cazuelas.  Most tapas dishes originate from Northern Spain and Ceviche imports its ingredients to keep alive the authenticity of the food.\\n\\nUpon my arrival, I take note that Ceviche is a romantically dark, yet surprisingly spacious venue.  The eatery takes over a seasoned part of Orlando's history at Church Street Station where Rosie O'Grady's once was.   The gorgeous Spanish tile married with deep shades of red adorn the floors, walls and tables.  Incorporating natural materials of wrought iron and dark walnut give it the restaurant old world flair.  In the middle of the dining area, I was surprised to see wreaths of garlic and meaty legs of cured ham hung to entice my hunger.  Although the interior and dark lighting feel dreamy and cozy, I do not recommend this restaurant for a romantic dinner on a Friday or Saturday night as the high ceilings cause voices to carry and it becomes quite noisy.  I felt myself almost yelling to my fellow diners.  Keep the romantic dinners to the middle of the week when the restaurant is sparse with patrons. \\n\\nMy party and I started with cocktails and decided no good time goes unpunished without Ceviche's exclusive wine list. We grabbed a bottle of red for about $30 bucks.  I highly suggest ordering a bottle.  If you order by the glass, you will pay through the nose for the amount served. I also tried the Sangria which has been voted \\"Best in Tampa\\" and the reputation was well deserved.  It was the most authentic sangria I have had next to Columbia Restaurant located in Celebration, Florida.  Fruity and rich with the Spanish wine not overpowering the brandy. If wine isn't your forte, they also have an extensive beer and liquor selection for your cocktail indulgence.\\n\\nEach of the more than 100 tapas dishes has its own character.  The menu has something for everyone including a huge list of vegetables dishes.  For starters, I tried the Portobello Relleno. The sheer size of the juicy mushroom cap was overwhelming as was the stuffing of spinach and manchego cheese abed twin sauces, a creamy and velvety peanut bchamel complimented by  a savory, thinner red gravy sauce. \\n\\nThe beauty of Ceviche is you do not order your entire meal at once.  It is a tradition in Spain that dining is a slow tango to the finish.  The orders come out so quickly, you can relax and take your time to treasure every dish and order more when you are ready.  If you have a large party however, I did notice that the restaurant could use some more staff as they seemed stretched too thin.  My party consisted of over ten people and we had one person attending to our ferocious appetites.  \\n\\nAfter the delectable Portobello, I choose to be adventurous and try their signature, traditional Ceviche which was by far, one of the best starters on the menu!  It is served in an elegant martini glass and is bursting with heaps of white fish, tuna, shrimp and octopus in the lemon-lime marinade with red onions for a zesty crunch.  The dish was light and filling enough for two even though I cleaned my cocktail glass thoroughly with no piece of fish left un-devoured.\\n\\nMy main tapas selection was a prime fillet decked with a wine sherry mushroom sauce that I should have ordered on the side.  The meat was cooked perfectly but the flavor was deluged by this rich sauce.  I recommend this dish with the sauce on the side for dipping au jus style.   My party and I polished off our meal with some espresso and a sugary piece of caramelized flan drizzled with dark chocolate.  The flan was creamy with a milky taste similar to tres leche and the trickles of dark chocolate were seductive.\\n \\nCeviche lived up to its name and this epicurean plans on going back to try more of their delicious fare.

Flavor of the chicken here is pretty awesome.  The chicken skin is light, crispy, and has a subtle hint of char.  Chicken meat is moist & delicious.  It also has a pleasant, distinct lemongrass & garlic flavor to it, which you can combine with the stuffing & sticky rice in each bite for a wonderful mixture of flavor and texture.  The cilantro & pepper used was fairly subtle.  It's also not spicy at all.  \\n\\nVery delicious dish, and one of the best rotisserie chicken I've had.  The tamarind dipping sauce was fairly compatible, but could over-power the more delicate flavors of the game hen & stuffing.  I opted without it.  The was the strongest dish of our meal.  I also feel that it's Pok Pok's best value, as half the bird is only $7.  A rotisserie chicken at organic food store would cost about the same, only it's nowhere near as delicious.  I could eat this once a month if not more.    \\n\\nKung Phao (grilled prawns with lime/chilli dipping sauce).  The prawns are shelled.  Prawn is fairly moist.  Not a bad dish.  The spices in the dip were wonderful.  At $9 for three medium sized prawns, the value isn't the best, but nonetheless reasonable.  Dipping sauce complements the shrimp nicely.  This is a nice dish to pair with a light larger & some jasmine rice.  I feel it will grow on me.\\n\\nPhat Si Ew  (stir fry wide rice noodles with pork & broccoli).  Temperature and char from the wok I feel is probably the most important element of a good authentic stir-fry dish, regardless of the cuisine.  I think Pok Pok does a great job in that respect.  Having had a good deal of great authentic Thai in Los Angeles, and some great stir fries living in Hong Kong for a few years, I think Pok Pok does well in delivering some of the authentic flavors and technique here.  At the same time, it doesn't particularly stand out.  It's solid, but honestly I feel it introduces nothing new if you're already acquainted with good Thai or Chinese.  \\n\\nPapaya salad isn't bad here.  I opted without the salted black crab.  I requested 'medium' level spicy and felt it worked well.  The peanuts and mini dried shrimp mixed in were welcome.  My dining companion felt the spiciness was overbearing hot, but for me it was well balanced.\\n\\nKhao Phat Puu (dungeness crab fried rice) was probably my least favorite dish.  The crab or rice here was very salty in an overbearing way.  I really felt that this obscured all other elements in the dish.  Not sure if this was intentional, but it turned out to ruin the fried rice imo.  I think it would have been a solid dish otherwise.  All other elements were there.  The wok work is obviously very good again, and it would have been a great fried rice otherwise.\\n\\nKhao Niew Mumang ( dessert of mango with pandanus, sticky rice, salted coconut cream, and toasted sesame seeds) again isn't something atypical of authentic Thai.  What is exceptional is that the execution here is top notch.  I love this dish and nobody does it better than Pok Pok.  The fresh mangoes, the sweet and salty coconut creme, and the toasted sesame seeds here are perfectly balanced.\\n\\nDrinking vinegars here are delicious & refreshing.  Didn't care for it at first, but it grew on me.  It's a refreshing concoction of bitter, sweet, and tart.  One of the best non-alcoholic drinks ever.  Pomegranate was my favorite flavor.

And not only that, but TOTCHO's? What?!\\n\\nParking is valet only only (minimum of $2) or street parking. Street parking wasn't that easy to find on weekend nights, so we forked up the $2 for valet. And even then, the valet wasn't the most skilled at driving manual, so my friend had to valet park his own car. So essentially, it's a $2 paid lot.\\n\\nSitting outdoors in the beautiful fall weather is worth braving the elements. The wind kept blowing and acorns kept hitting people in the head or falling in drinks. Guard your waters. Sitting indoors was pretty noisy, the constant bar noise is definitely not for an intimate date.\\n\\nThe first thing we did once seated was order a Fish Bowl. In the two times I've been to the Nook, I've tried the Mangito and the Lanced Up and Quirky. The 128oz of liquid contains 16oz of liquor, whatever the recipe calls for. Both drinks were both sweet, tasty and easy to drink. Give them a try! One fish bowl is more than enough for 3 people and perfect for 4.\\n\\nThe Mac Daddy Totcho's were a little disappointing. I was expecting more to it than the scarce toppings we found on the tater tots. Oh well, nothing a little ketchup can't fix. I would go with a different totcho order next time, for sure. The flash fried calamari wasn't the greatest either, but the Shrimp and Grits? They aren't coined \\"award winning\\" for nothing. I liked the deconstruction of the dish with two andouille sausage grit cakes, a couple leaves of spinach and more than half a dozen fresh shrimp soaking in the sauce. \\n\\nThere is such an expansive burger and sandwich menu that I'm sure there is something for everyone. There was even a Shrimp and Grits burger, which my friend noted wasn't as good as the entree version, but was very satisfied with the size of the burger (almost as big as his face!)\\n\\nOverall, food is alright, service is ok.

We should have asked for more of it and skipped the ordering part altogether. That's saying something. \\n\\nBut alas, we fell for the \\"ambience\\" of the place, which wowed us right from the start, but naturally, it was all downhill from there.\\n\\nI won't dispute they have a great, wide -- huge even -- selection of tapas, but what's the point when everything tastes bad???\\n\\nWe started badly with the gaspatcho, which was delivered without spoons, so we were forced to sit there staring at it for 5 minutes until our waitress was found. The first spoonful revealed that instead of being a fresh, cold tomato soup, that it seemed ot have been made entirely out of cream and overloaded with god-knows-what little pieces of food to try to distract one from the taste. That said, we could taste the tomato, but only just as it was thickly overpowered by the cream. We were burping it up until the next day.\\n\\n2nd on the menu was the croquetas, which turned out to have the consistency and taste of baby food. but hey! they were deep fried FTW, which masked the taste a little and helped me at least get something in my belly.\\n\\n3rd was the spicy chorizo. i was REALLY looking forward to this dish and was intrigued to see it arrive in a luke warm lake of tomato-based liquid. Nevertheless I plunged in, ready to make the \\"mmmmmm\\" noise, only to find myself chewing instead of into a lovely, spicy and crispy piece of chorizo, into a waterlogged piece of mystery-meat devoid of any spice or hint of flavour. i almost gagged.  Our waitress was a nice girl, but inattentive and curiously didn't seem all that  surprised when we asked to send the dish back to the kitchen.\\n\\n4th, and last in the order, was the ceviche. We still guarded a glimmer of hope that a restaurant called \\"Ceviche\\" would at least have a damn good ceviche. And the verdict -- it was the best of a bad bunch of dished. Too chewy, the opposite of \\"delicate\\", but once the dressing was dredged up from the bottom of the cocktail glass (what's with that??) and reapplied to the fish on top, it was edible.\\n\\nWe debated getting the hell out of there right then, but my partner was still terribly hungry so we decided to chance it by ordering the omlette espagnol -- the traditional spanish omlette stuffed with onions and potato. Not much in there to screw up, right? Wrong. Flavor, where was it? Texture? Think of a omlette you'd cooked in the microwave. Are they employing prison cooks in this restaurant or what?\\n\\nWe paid our bill and headed over to the dessert lady opposite who filled our bellies with nice cake while we attempted to forget the fate which had befallen us.\\n\\nMy best advice to any adventurers who follow. Save yourselves. By all means, come and enjoy the building (which is amazing), poke your head in and savour the ambiance and this wonderful building (especially when they're playing music), but make reservations elsewhere.

And there we went.....\\n\\nWow. What a wonderful save from the cold. The place was warm and cozy. It almost felt like Christmas with the lights, and the pile of snow covering the outside tables. We were greeted by the wonderful bar server, Kenneth, as we took a seat at the bar. The ambiance was very chill and there were probably only 12 to 15 tables in the cafe. The bar has beautiful arrangements of stacked brownie squares and pies that were ooooh so tempting to touch and scarf down. I also noticed a few beers on tap and bottles of wine at the bar. \\n\\nBut as planned, we were there to get something to warm up our almost frozen used-to-California-weather bodies.\\n\\nThe menu was posted on a chalkboard at the top of the bar. They do have a good selection of caffeine filled drinks, paninis, salads, sandwiches and other entrees.\\n\\nI decided to get the Salted Caramel Hot Chocolate. Oh my. This is bloody ooh to the goodness, best fancy hot chocolate I've ever had. It is made with their own homemade caramel and hot cocoa, with a dash of organic sea salt. I definitely tasted the blast of salty and sweet in my first sip, and savoured every liquid traveling down my throat. Soooo Gooooood!!! the last sips were the best as all the salty goodness and the caramel glaze that settled at the bottom of the cup just flowed together and created the irresistable yummy flavor to my tastebuds\\nThis magic cup of goodness is part of their Specials. So definitely try it while they still have it....(However Kenneth said it might make it to their daily serves as it's a big HIT to the crowd)\\n\\nMy friend ended up with the Hazelnut Hot Chocolate and said it was like eating a spoonfull of Nutella. \\nWho hates Nutella?\\n\\nKenneth: if you're reading this..thanks for the chat! and So sorry we didn't make it to brunch! our waking times were pretty screwey...But we'll definitely see you when we come back to Boston!"},{"name":"Spinelli's Deli","address":"767 Neil Ave","city":"Columbus","stars":"3","text":"Spinelli's Deli is easy to miss on a visit to Columbus because there are so many fantastic food options right on High Street and this little deli is tucked away in Victorian Village right next to a giant grocery store.\\n\\nHaving lived in New York, I can't say that the bagels quite stack up to a good Jewish water bagel, but they do serve up quite a mouth watering menu to choose from.

We had previous been to numerous tapas joints in and around Boston, from Toro and Dali to Solea in Waltham. This one was new to both of us.\\n\\nWe were seated downstairs and immediately had to ask to switch tables as we were right under the A/C vent and were freezing our asses off. I don't understand why the A/C was on in the first place, it wasn't warm inside and the temperatures outside were right under 32 degrees. Regardless, we switched and our waiter arrived. We ordered a couple of exotic beers, Aguila (Columbia) and Cusque√±a (Peru) and both lagers arrived ice cold but were somewhat flavorless. I wonder if it was really worth importing, they tasted very generic.\\n\\nThe decor itself was nice and the atmosphere quite remarquable and very unique, and after a brief discussion of the menu with our waiter, we established that ordering six items should and would be enough.\\n\\nWe went ahead and ordered the following:\\n\\n- Tabla de Quesos ($16) - assortment of cheese\\nThis lovely cheese assortment featured montenebro, cabrales and tetilla, sided with some guava preserve, a fig stuffed with dulce de leche and some salted spanish almonds. The cheese was good, the pairings were good, especially the fig that was stuffed with the dulche de leche. However no cooking was required so it's hard to be wowed by this. I could go to Formaggio Kitchen in Cambridge and get these results very easily myself at home. Good but not great.\\n\\n- Yuca a la Brava ($8)\\nWho can resist fried yucca, with some Spanish paprika sauce? I can't. It was great and we devoured our way through that plate quicker than with any other plate we had. This is a classic and it is executed well.\\n\\n- Tortilla de Maduros Con Salsa Rosada ($8)\\nThis was a plate of onions and plaintains made into an omelette with some 'pink' sauce (aka crack sauce - it was great!) and covered with a few microgreens. A bit pricey but delicious as well. \\n\\n- Rollitos de Aguacate Con Salsa de Ciruelas y Cilantro ($8)\\nThese were crispy avocado rolls which came plated with a side of prune and cilantro sauce - the whole dish was kind of bland and one dimensional. Needs more kick somewhere. Maybe incorporate a spicy element in there to contract and cut the richness of the avocado? \\n\\n- Chorizo a la Plancha Con Yuca en Salsa de Coco ($9)\\nThe Chorizo was absolutely delicious but apparently there's supposed to be coconut somewhere in this dish? And the Yucca was mushy as hell and very bland. Meh.\\ngrilled spanish sausage, yucca in coconut sauce\\n\\n- Alb√≥ndigas en salsa de guayaba ($10)\\nThe beef meatballs were on the small side and the guave was almost inexistent. The tomato sauce was slightly spicy but overall I didn't feel like the dish worked. It was okay but far from great.\\n\\n- Corazones de Pollo en Licor 43   ($9)\\nThose were chicken hearts cooked in Spanish vanilla and citrus liqueur. At least that's what they claimed. I found that they had the texture of erasers and quite frankly couldn't taste the vanilla or any other flavor in there. Just chewy, chewy, chewy hearts. You get the point. Never again. \\n\\nOur service was friendly and pretty attentive although they did bring food to our tablet that wasn't ours... twice. A bit disorganized but the recommendations were okay and my favorite part was that we got to pay using an Android tablet and the Leaf software which enabled us to split our bill effortlessly.\\n\\nAll in all the place has some potential but I found a lot of the dishes to come off as slightly lazy in terms of execution and very inconsistent. Some are amazing and others fall flat on their face. There's some creativity in there and potential though but with Toro just  a few miles away in the South End, Casa B needs to step up to the plate as they aren't anywhere near as good and also more expensive.

We put in our name and they said it would be an hour wait which is to be expected for likely one of their busier times. After walking around the area for 45 minutes we came back to the restaurant and waited outside to be seated. After another 20 minutes they hadn't called anyone's names or seated anyone despite there being 3-4 open tables and 4 open bar seats. I asked the hostess if we were close to being called for seats and she said we had 2 groups ahead of us. We waited for another 20 minutes and still nothing. At this point we were running out of time for dinner so we decided to just go to the take out window and order to go. After ordering take out and waiting for our food to be cooked, the hostess finally called our name as we were on our way out. She was about to sit us at 2 of the 4 bar seats that had been empty since we first got to the restaurant. She had us stare at empty seats for nearly an hour on top of the 45 minutes we initially waited only to offer to them to us as we were already leaving. \\n\\nPok pok is a perfect example of a restaurant which likely was great to begin with but has gone downhill with popularity.

The in-store menu has less options than the online menu. We also used a 15% off coupon we had so our order totaled  about $42. \\n\\nI had the Double Diablo burger and it was good! I enjoyed it, it was a little spicy and the flavor was good.  Portion sizes were average to many other places.  We were full when we finished. Friends liked the chili cheese fries which was exactly what it is called. No complaints on flavors. The shakes were good, I had the strawberry one which was really good. Did not taste artificial. \\n\\nThe employees were friendly. There seemed like there was a manager on the floor proactively walking around to make sure things were running smoothly which I always appreciate seeing. There was also a good effort to keep the place clean and well stocked. \\n\\nWould I come back? Probably not anytime in the near future. There isn't anything super memorable about Mooyah.

I'm not a huge fan of tater tots so these things are lost on me.  It is of note that they are designed to share but seem to be a very small portion,  which brings me to my major gripe with this place: for a neighborhood tavern this place seems to be very \\"corporate\\" and sort of stuffy. From the skimpy portions, to the extremely high drink prices ($9.50 for a Ketel One and tonic, really?), they seem to be running this place like some sort of chain restaurant in a touristy mall.

I had a GIGANTIC bowl of bi bim bap, it came with soup and the all-you-can eat kim chee bar that Matt mentioned, and the total was just $6!  The soup was a little boring, but the kim chee were delightful - there were four kinds, including the traditional cabbage version, one made with what seemed like shredded turnip, one made with radish chunks, and one that was made with cucumber.  They also gave us a couple of small bowls of some slightly scary-looking, very yellow potato salad that I didn't venture to try.\\n\\nHonestly, the bi bim bap was a hair on the bland side, but then we spotted the bottles of spicy sauce next to the pickled veggie bar and once I'd slathered my meal in that, it became quite tasty, indeed.  I gobbled it all up and patted my stomach, happily reminded of my first and many subsequent Korean food meals (all involving bi bim bap - I could never bring myself to branch out) during my college days in Ann Arbor.  \\n\\nAt first blush, I didn't really think the food here quite fit any of the various definitions of manna, but now that I think about it, that endless supply of kim chee may just qualify as divine."},{"name":"The Daily Catch","address":"323 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"This place doesn't mess around.

For a normal large pizza, it's as spendy as anywhere else in Newton, but their secret weapon is the extra-large pizza, which allows you to rationalize the expenditure over an extra night or two, or feed more folks for less.  They also won us over with their pretty vast array of tasty toppings.  The pizza, including the crust is very good in general, and just the right shade of greasy.  It also warms up outstandingly well in a toaster oven, which is pretty important to me, too.   Their other stuff is all right, but really, the pizza stands out.  They deliver really quickly (of course, they're just three blocks away), and it's also nice that they don't just keep track of credit cards, but also multiple ones, so that one roommate doesn't inadvertently usurp another's.  User-friendliness is key for people as lazy as us. \\n\\n\\"Default pizza place\\" is a lucrative position for my household, but one that comes with a great deal of responsibility.  Or something.

We were greeted at the door by the hostess; she called upstairs and told us to head up as our table was ready.  We were brought to a cozy table by the windows, and there was an ice-bucket with wine next to our table, which belonged to another table (a little odd, as there were other \\"open\\" places it could have been placed).  A few minutes later our waitress came by and brought us menus (twas a little odd to us they didn't provide menus when seated, but I chalk it up to being a fancier place...).  We perused the menu, and a few minutes later the waitress came by to take our drink order, but I was focused on choosing my meal, so we asked her to come back.  A few minutes later she returned, and we ordered drinks, and she asked if she could explain the menu to us (there's an option for a chef's tasting, and then a regular menu on the right).  We said sure, go ahead and explain... which is pretty much what I said a moment ago, not sure why it needed explaining!  Anyway, the chef's tasting has to be ordered by the entire table, which was a no-go since my wife's allergic to shellfish (otherwise I probably would have splurged!).  She tells us of the evening special, which was $75 for a pasta dish with truffle-sauce.  Sounded tasty, but it must be high-end truffle sauce for $75! so we opted for other fair.  Orders placed, drinks in hand (which were expertly prepared might I add!).  Our starters were brought out fairly soon after; my wife ordered the pork bellies, I ordered the squash soup.  I liked both; my soup was probably the highlight of the meal.  I tasted my wife's app, the pork belly was quite tasty, the lentils were a bit too potent a flavor for me (over-shadowing the pork), and left a lingering aftertaste.  Main course, my wife ordered the gnocchi pesto/parmesan, I ordered the ribeye.  The gnocchi was quite good, though a bit larger portion size would've been nice (so I could have stolen more!). The ribeye was the thinnest cut of ribeye I've ever seen at a restaurant.  It was tender, and had a good amount of marbling for flavor.  Similar to the lentils, the bordelaise sauce had a strong flavor, which took away from the steak a bit in my opinion.  The gratin dauphinois (potatoes au gratin) had a good texture, but lacked a bit of flavor.  Onto dessert (I ordered the chocolate souffl√© alongside my main course), my wife ordered 2 scoops of sorbet (blackberry thyme, & lemon olive oil).  She wasn't a fan of either, though warmed up to the blackberry thyme.  My souffl√© was tasty.  \\n\\nAll & all, it was a decent meal.  The staff was very friendly/welcoming, we saw the manager interacting with many different tables throughout our stay.  The decor was interesting; it had a mix of modern and rustic (random wood beams in the middle, sliding \\"barn doors\\" to one of the side rooms.  A little disappointing the entire table needs to order the chef's tasting, I can understand for pacing purposes, but not everyone's going to want (or be able to eat) all the options, so it's a missed opportunity.  The chef employed many bold flavor choices throughout the various courses, some worked better than others for me, but I do think it's up to personal preference (so if you enjoy a bit of non-traditional flavor, I'd recommend giving them a try).  This is a higher end restaurant, overlooking the common, so prices are a bit steeper, but not unreasonably so.  I'd waiver between 3 & 4 stars.  My wife had an allergic reaction to something (they must have shellfish in one of the food items, unexpectedly!), so I had to opt for 3 stars."},{"name":"Great Wok","address":"1181 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Arlington","stars":"3","text":"I'm not sure what happened here.

The enormous menu intimidated me, but I had seen those ducks hanging in the window when I entered Din Ho, so I knew  one thing I wanted to try.  I found duck on the bbq section of the menu but decided to get a duck/pork combo since I wasn't sure if I liked duck.  That was a good call because, as it turns out, I don't actually like duck.  What I got primarily consisted of fat and bones and wasn't very warm.  Also, things with bones are VERY hard to eat with chopsticks.  I loved the pork though.  Lean, tender, and well seasoned (though still not very hot), the bbq pork was one of the more interesting Chinese dishes I've tried.  To be on the safe side, we also ordered General Tso's chicken.  I will never forget how amazingly delicious it tasted.  Try it, you'll like it.\\n\\nAs others have noted, the waiters might benefit from some customer service training, but that didn't really bother me.

Recently opened in an area \\"hungry\\" for Portland's best things: great food and craft brews.  Sadly, missing the mark in the first few days and my first two visits I've left I unsatisfied. Here's why: 1. Brisket was overly dry and tasteless but was barely made edible by the au jus, 2. Guest tap tasted skunky (not fresh), 3. It wasn't even half way through happy hour and the kitchen was already out of half the happy hour menu, mid week! 4. The spinach/artichoke dip wasn't really a dip, something more like artichoke petals doused with a little cream and wilted spinach, 5. Pita served with alleged artichoke dip was burned in spots, 6. The place was awash with frantic help but we couldn't actually order or get attention from our \\"server\\" (literally Von Ebert shirts were running every which way but we were told multiple times, \\"I'm not your server but I'll try to find him,\\") 7. The pretzel was good but the mystery cheese dip was scary, or was it mustard, no, I think it's cheese... hmmm 8. So we tried a pizza. The sausage didn't seem cooked, sigh. 9. Only good beer I've had there so far was Chapter 3, but of course, it wasn't available on second visit. And 10! TEN concerns in one review! 10. Seas were covered with crumbs when we finally got a table. Bleh. Points for steak bites tho, with a nod to Ringside Grill to which I'll add, thanks Ringside for leaving this bit of sanity for us. Good luck. I really hope you pull it together. Our area really wants an awesome local watering hole.

And I bring people here, and they spend money here too.  \\n\\nI really want to like this place, and I did at the beginning but slowly there's issue after issue, yet I still come because I really wanted to support local small business.  Until today, they piss me off so bad that I am going to list out the issues I have been having with them.\\n\\n1.  On more than one occasion, I came here and they were not open even though it is supposed to be open per business hour posted on the door.  \\n\\n2.  I was required to tip 10%.  Yes, required, not suggested.  Yes, at a order-at-the-counter, get your own water kind of place.  (10% is a not huge amount but I just don't like \\"mandatory\\" tipping, if you feel that 10% is warranted for the workers, pay them more, charge it to the food).  \\n\\n3.  There is usually one person working at the counter, so the tables are usually not cleaned before next person sit down.  When no one is ordering, the counter person come clean, spraying windex next to you.  I really don't like inhaling windex.\\n\\n4.  I brought a friend, we ordered the same food, he also had a bubble tea, we had to leave in a hurry because he got violently ill and didn't want to stink up their bathroom.  He didn't make it home to my bathroom... \\n\\n5.  The portion of vegetable had gotten smaller and smaller since I started coming here.\\n\\n6.  I ordered extra soup and extra veggies, sometimes it comes in the same bowl as regular portion, sometimes it comes in a tapered bowl that has less volume than the regular bowl.  Sometimes I get more veggies, sometimes I don't.  But I always PAID extra.\\n\\n6.  Today I ordered a large order of Bok Choy like I have been doing (since the amount of Bok Choy I get had been diminishing as stated in #5, and since I don't actually get extra when I pay for it as stated in #6). My Bok Choy came with black hair (multiple)in it (I picked them out), and an unknown substance (I picked it out, put on the lid), maybe a bug, not sure.  And I only got the white part of the Bok Choy, the green part was missing.  I told the counter lady about the missing green part, she went back to the kitchen to tell the cook/owner.  She came back and told me the cook said this is how they have always cut it (not true, as I have ordered this many times), and next time just tell them I want the green part.  I wanted to give back what I did not eat (majority of the Bok Choy) and get HALF of the Bok Choy money back.  A younger guy (owner or cook I assume) came out and started arguing with me, saying that's how they have always cut the Bok Choy (not true, I called him out on it), that's how Bok Choy is served (not true, I called him out on it), and then he said they cut off the green part because it wasn't fresh so it was yellow.  I said if the veggie isn't fresh to the point they have to cut out a vital part of it, then don't serve it, I could have ordered something else.  Then he told me he has no control over the quality of produce delivered to them.  I told him I didn't want to argue, and told him I can't believe I am being treated so poorly and that I can't believe they are willing to lose a customer, and that I will be writing a bad review.  He walked away, counter lady kept trying to grab my container, and she grabbed bare handed from my container, the piece of unknown substance and threw it in the trash.  \\n\\nI won't come here again, nor recommend it.  \\n\\nTo the other counter girl:  good luck with your accounting degree, you will do great."},{"name":"The Daily Catch","address":"323 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"The mussels appetizer was amazing and so much of it!!

Our server was excessively friendly, but one of the kids had to wait at least 10 minutes, possibly more, for her food that had been given to a different table.

However, my bf and I agreed that Island Creek just wasn't on their A-game last night.\\n\\nWe got the Bicyclette and Air Mail, as well as the Island Creek, Moon Shoal, Tumblers, and Turtle Cove oysters to start. Both cocktails were light, refreshing, and had just the right balance of flavors. As for the oysters, our least favorite were the Turtle Coves, which just didn't have a unique flavor.  I think my bf ordered them to serve as a comparator to the other oysters. Our favorites were the Island Creek (very meaty) and the Moon Shoals (best flavor). I ordered the Lobster Short-rib pasta since it got so much praise on Yelp. Although I enjoyed the combination of lobster and short-ribs, the lobster was over-cooked and rubbery. We weren't impressed with the East Coast Halibut with Ricotta Gnocchi, Cherry Tomatoes, and Roasted Eggplant. The Halibut was very bland and there weren't enough tomatoes, sauce, or eggplant to add flavor to each bite. For dessert, we ordered the Hot Fudge Sundae. After being won over by the waitress's description of chocolate \\"gushing\\" out of the cake, we were disappointed when we broke the cake and nothing come out. The cake was overcooked and there wasn't enough butter pecan ice cream. \\n\\nHowever, the service and ambiance was perfect.

However, that did not make up for the overpriced, mediocre Thai food. I paid $17 for sticky rice (which I could make better at home) and a boar collar dish. The portion size for the boar seemed like an appetizer. Only some of the food was decent and some of it was just not tasty, such as the \\"perennial favorite\\" eggplant with prawn salad. I would rather take my money to another joint. Portions were small and not worth the price. \\n\\nYou know an Asian restaurant isn't good if there are hardly any Asian people there. If you are looking for overpriced Thai food this is the place for you. Only some of the food was just barely decent, definitely not mind blowing.

My daughter is only 2 but understood the idea of what they were saying and started to cry. These people where mid 30ish- they should known better. We didn't stay, and when were walking off, the maitre d' who heard the conversation had a large smile on her face, rudely asked if we were coming back. I politely said no, and left- no apologies, though I didn't expect one- apparently I am not douche enough to dine here. \\nShortly after that experience, I was there with a  group of work friends- they all wanted to go for the food, I am a very go with the flow guy- didn't say anything, as I think the food is very good. 1 hour wait, but no biggie, they have a pretty good shaded area, we decided to get drinks. The bar was full but not too busy, but I felt I was being ignored by the bartenders. I have been a bartender all through college, and know that you do not harass them, and wait patiently. I always have a humble smile on my face, but still they just sat there talking with another customer- it was obvious I wanted a drink. So when the bartender got to me, I ordered a Lite beer, and she was trying to talk me into another drink on special- all my friends ordered it, kindly and politely I said no, that I couldn't drink it and would like a lite beer- she pressed it, I kindly explained i was diabetic and those drinks have too much sugar- though they do look tastey, I am very careful of my diet. She told me that was a lame excuse and laughed. She also forgot to give me my beer. Though the other bartender I think saw what had happened, cause after waiting a few more minutes he asked me what I needed and I explained i had order a lite beer from the other bartender, he quickly popped one and gave it to me- no charge. I guess I can't say everyone there is pretentious, but two bad experiences in a row is enough for me not to return, and feel I have to give a honest warning to other people. \\nIf I was rating on food- at least 4.5 stars the food is really good, but I just can't get over how we are usually treated every time we are there- there are plenty of places that have just as good food, and we are treated a lot better."},{"name":"Pho Basil","address":"177 Massachusetts Ave, Ste A","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"This quaint restaurant is centrally located on mass ave (one a the few restaurants in the strip worth checking out).

The menu is pretty extensive -including pad thai, curry, seafood, veggie, and pho. I got a pho dish with pork dumplings in a chicken broth, as I've gotten here the past three times. It was delicious and a pretty good serving size considering the price. The only reason for a one star deduction is for the way my boyfriend and I felt as if we were somewhat rushed to leave upon finishing our dinner and paying the bill -which in it of itself is not a big deal, it just bumps it out of a 5 star rating.

I had haddock parmesan , lightly fried fish served over wheat pasta with red sauce.  It was as good as any I've had in the North End.

The tiramisu can't compare with Modern Pastry but its still good, the cake slices are humongous and prices are reasonable.  Kids loved the giant cookies.

Also, as a North Carolinian, I was pretty stoked to see that they have Sun Drop soda in the market!\\n\\nIf you are looking for actual Mexican food (that's not the Ohio 'Mexican', you know the only vaguely edible food that gets served in Columbus at places claiming to be Mexican), then go here.  I have eaten at a good number of other 'Mexican' Restaurants in Columbus and have been sad each time.  Who knows why I keep trying other places and don't just come here!  Every time I come here I leave pleasantly full and dreaming about the next time we come.  At La Michoacan you won't find silly cheddar (or mozzarella) cheese on anything, boring un-salsa like salsa, or Americanized things on tacos.  \\n\\nThe salsa is what salsa should be- cilantro, onion, tomato, jalape√±os, etc perfectly balanced with a heat to match.  Sauces brought to the table are also balanced and delicious.  The interactions with staff have always been pleasant with them being quite attentive.  Having some knowledge of Spanish will be a help but I'm sure you can manage without.  There are so many drink options from bottled Mexican sodas, to beer galore, to horchata, a tamarind drink and so on.  \\n\\nThe carnitas has been specifically delicious.  While I have noticed on a few visits that the dish does look different (based on what meat cut is used in the carnitas).  This totally doesn't bother me at all.  Regardless on the cut the carnitas has been delicious.  Slower cooked to tender and then oh so nicely crisped on the outside.  Just typing this I am thinking that La Michoacan is where I should go for lunch.  Tacos have been great!  Cilantro and onion, just what I love to see.  \\n\\nThe rice is what I like to see in rice.  No weird peas or carrots in it- not so much what I want in my rice at a Mexican restaurant.  Plus the beans, oh the beans!  The best beans I've had.

We were also given the wrong bill and it took time to get that settled.  Despite that experience, we decided to give U & I Thai another chance.\\n\\nWe decided to come for dinner on a weeknight and there were maybe 5 tables in total that were occupied at that time.  There were 3 servers working and one guy that looked like he might've been in training or bussing tables.

I was starting to get a feeling of deja vu at this point.\\n\\nThe food wasn't bad but it wasn't anything great that I would come back for----the spring rolls were hard and there was a pathetically small amount of chicken meat in the chicken curry that we had ordered (we'd never encountered this problem before in all the other times we'd been there).  By contrast, there must've been about a pound of onions in that dish (translation=a lot of cheap filler) so we really found that to be a disappointment and a rip-off.

It's a good sign when the menu reminds you of food you'd make at home but with an interesting twist and new concepts.  The grass-fed burger is the best in town (sorry, SoCo Caf√©).  The Heirloom Tomato pizza was also fantastic, and don't even get me started on the tzatziki...crazy good).\\n\\nSo why only 4 stars?  The service was great except for two things:  when a drink was spilled we were promised replacement napkins but none arrived, and our leftovers were whisked away to be boxed up but never returned to us (and I was really looking forward to enjoying that!).

We started off with the sandwich de bistec (beef tenderloin, sauteed onions, crispy shallots)... which were stupendous. Don't let the simple name stop you from ordering it! Then, we tried to bollo con jamon serrano (serrano ham on top of white corn toast, guava jam spread on toast), which was also tasty--my dinner partner LOVED this dish. And--again, don't judge just based off the name / description--but the albondigas (meatballs in guava sauce) were SPECTACULAR! So tasty! Imagine at least 15 mini meatballs, drenched in this delicious sauce, with crispy crostinis on which you can put your albondigas, and/or dip it in the aforementioned sauce. It is so incredibly satisfying and delicious--highly recommended. We also got the atun salteado (sesame seared tuna), which was aptly described by a fellow Yelper as a Latin sushi kind of bite. And we ended with the camarones rellenos de yuca (yucca-stuffed, bacon-wrapped shrimp!), which was damn good, too.\\n\\nBy this point (5 plates between 2 people), we were stuffed.

It's really amazing how small the burrito bowl was. And both menu items I ordered weren't even that good.. I was really disappointed, because it looks modern and like a place with good, big portions.

On the inside they have picnic tables both inside as well as an \\"outdoor\\" covered area.  The outdoor covered area is all weather and stays warm even in the colder months so there is a fair amount of seating. \\n\\nService: There isn't any outside of getting your food.  That being said, they're always friendly and even if you're really anal about them getting the amount of meat you want they're always  polite and friendly about it.   I've yet to have a negative experience with any of the employees at this location.\\n\\nFood:  This is personally my favorite BBQ place.  I'm a sucker for their pork loin and creamed corn, those are the 2 things I ~always~ get, I mix it up with chicken or turkey or ribs from time to time, but imo their pork loin is underrated and the creamed corn is actually my favorite thing on the menu!\\n\\nTheir breakfast tacos are also pretty good, not as good as the bbq but good nonetheless. \\n\\nPrice:  The price is on point, it's the other reason why I like this place. I go here with my husband all the time we spend a little over 30 bucks total and we take home left over 9 times out of 10 which is enough to make a couple of sandwiches for the next day.\\n\\nOverall:  Always a good experience.  The employees are always on point, the food has always been great and the price is appropriate.\\n\\nThis is one of my favorite places to bring people visiting Austin.

Our waiter had an excellent grasp of both the menu and wine offerings. We sampled items from their regular menu. All was good. Started with a scallop carpaccio with cauliflower. The scallops were sliced thin, were impeccably fresh, and rested in a succulent vinaigrette. The cauliflower added a nice touch of color (purple) but overpowered the delicacy of the scallops. I had a stew for my entree, braised short ribs in a wonderful wine sauce. The short ribs were beautifully braised and rich in flavor. My hubbie started with the beet and goat cheese salad (for a man that grew up hating vegetables he sure loves beets) and a pumpkin ravioli for his entree. Both, he declared were superb.

Wings! Wings! Wings! That's all I ever hear about when anyone mentions Pok Pok.  Everyone suggests trying those popular wings...especially since they are \\"Vietnamese\\" style wings...and I am Vietnamese.  We did order other items, but this review is mainly about these hyped up wings. \\n\\nSo, of course, I order the wings.  The wait time for the food is extremely long.  However, that is to be expected since the wait time to actually get a seat there is long as well.  I guess the longer you wait, the more hungry you become....and by the time the food arrives, you're about to die of starvation and any food is passable for delicious.  \\n\\nThe \\"Vietnamese\\" style wings are the typical Vietnamese wings prepared with fish sauce.  Most Vietnamese people should be familiar with this.  It's basically wings marinated in fish sauce and sugar....then deep fried and tossed in more fish sauce, seasonings, garlic, etc.  Pok Pok's wings were way too salty.  It was a disappointment.  They were also very overpriced at $14.50 for about 6 whole wings.  There are so many other authentic Vietnamese restaurants that serve up the same kinda of Vietnamese \\"fish sauce\\" wings at better prices and better flavor.  These Pok Pok wing were underwhelming and did not live up to it's hype at all.  I guess the reason why they are so hyped up is because people are still generally unfamiliar with \\"fish sauce wings\\" so the flavor is new, novel and interesting?!  It's nothing special and definitely nothing you can't make at home.   \\n\\nThe staff was attentive and friendly though.  \\n\\nWait time is horrible.

My boyfriend is hardcore about ramen and I don't eat meat so it was an occasion on our vacation to actually enjoy \\"authentic\\" ramen meal together.  I made the mistake of thinking the ramen I ordered was in a fish broth, as I'm a Pesco and eat fish.  The other ramen indicated pork or chicken broth so I thought I was safe.  I noticed the vegetarian option but knew it would lack flavor - hence My ordering the \\"bonito\\" flavored broth.  When it came out with pork, I immediately said I was sorry but needed to reorder.  I've worked in the food industry.  I get why people don't like clients like me - but I made a mistake.  So a woman comes over to assist others at the table with their order - a white woman with purple in her hair and says something to the effect of, \\"she didn't want what she ordered so we had to make her meal on the fly, that's why your order hasn't come out yet.\\"  Wow.  I couldn't believe the level of rudeness.\\nI've been in Portland for five days and have commented to everyone now friendly and kind they are.

We finally came on a Friday night, expecting a long wait time but surprisingly we only waited a few minutes. It's nicely decorated inside, very modern but a little too dimly lit. We were seated at one of the high chairs by the window, so it wasn't really a table, which made it a bit uncomfortable and tight. \\n\\nI knew we had to order the oysters so we got some Island Creeks ($2.50 each), which are my favorite. They were very fresh and the best part of our meal. We also ordered the following:\\n\\n-Fried Fish Sandwich ($17): I enjoyed the bun that it came with but the fish itself was a bit lackluster, not a lot of taste and piece of fish was small. The old bay fries that accompanied it were way too salty. I did like that our waiter knew we were sharing so they were nice enough to split it for us and serve it on two separate plates. \\n\\n-Fried Clams ($17): The small order did not come with much clams at all. It was a bit deceiving as they put the clams over a pile of fries, making it look as though there were a lot. The taste was also nothing spectacular. I thought I would be wowed by it, but sadly I was disappointed. Definitely have had better fried clams for cheaper.\\n\\n-Crispy Oyster Sliders ($4 each): Ordered two of these. Not much oyster flavor, probably because of the breading. If I had not known it was an oyster slider I wouldn't have been able to tell what I was eating.\\n\\nOverall I was a bit disappointed with the food. Not really worth the price that I paid. If I ever come back I would probable just stick with the raw oysters. \\n\\nParking can be a bit tricky depending on what time you come.

We did some searching on Yelp and settled on Pho Basil - this place is pretty tiny inside and for a Tuesday night pretty packed. There were two groups ahead of us waiting and standing near the door. I will say that their layout is not ideal - it was kind of awkward with 6 of us smushed in the corner right next to the doors where people were going in and out and no host stand to wait nearby. It took kind of awhile before someone came to us and took our info, but then never told us how long the estimated wait would be. \\n\\nOriginally, I wanted yellow curry and was craving it, but the yellow curry on the menu wasn't what I expected it to be or what I wanted. I wanted chicken yellow curry with onions and potatoes and even though there was a large selection of curry dishes to choose from, none of them had potatoes and almost all of them had a really odd medley of vegetables and fruits that I was not expecting or really feeling tonight. Example, their yellow curry ok the menu had pineapple, tomatoes, onions and mushrooms (among some other things I can't remember right now). Kind of weird/interesting right? I ended up getting the veggie puffs as an appetizer (second choice - I wanted the roti and curry originally but they were out of it), the Thai basil fried rice with crispy chicken, and milk tea bubble tea. Milk tea was good but not great - the tapioca pearls felt kind of hard rather than soft and chewy but the tea had a good flavor and was not too sweet which I like. Fried rice surprisingly had a lot of flavor and I appreciated that they offered crispy fried chicken with it as an option- that was unique and it tasted good. Veggie puffs were like little samosas but made with spring/egg roll wrapped. \\n\\nDespite the weirdness with waiting around awhile without being acknowledged or given an estimated wait time, not having the yellow curry I wanted, running out of the roti, and the OK milk tea, I'm still giving it 4 stars for the following reasons: it was packed for a Tuesday night and is a very small space; despite that, once we were seated the service was very good. Food was hot and fresh and arrived quickly and I enjoyed what I ordered overall. Portions were huge and prices relatively cheap.

We got a bit greedy and ordered the 9-piece dessert sampler and a molten chocolate cake.  I didn't like their Apple Spice Cake or Apple Cranberry Tart.  I've had better at other restaurants that don't specialize in sweets.  I also didn't care for the cheesecake or the sorbet.  I did, however, really like the Hot Fudge Sundae (brownie with vanilla ice cream).  It was so misleading because when I stuck my spoon in it, it was very hard.  I assumed it was going to be tough and dry.  Instead, it was rich and just the right level of sweet for me.  I also enjoyed the whoopie pie and creme brulee.  The Manjari Mousse and Boston Cream were okay.  Next time, I'll know which ones to ask for! \\n\\nI would've given this place 4 stars except the service was exceptionally slow.

This has been one of those places that initially left me a bit cold due to the inconsistency - the first time I went (it was called Monado then) it was fantastic, the second not-so-much, the third very good, the fourth not great (warm sushi rice? ugh.) - you get the idea. I'm happy to report that the handful of times I've gone in the past year it's been very good and it seems that they've vastly improved the consistency. I do believe this is the best sushi buffet I've experienced in Atlanta - there may be better but I haven't found it. It's really something to be experienced - one note, the prices vary a bit depending on when you go - the least expensive is during week-day lunches (price goes up for dinner regardless). The weekend prices are higher as are holidays - and this place does get packed during weekends and holidays. I visited Easter Sunday evening arriving about 7:00 PM and they were packed - by 8:30 they were nearly empty (they closed at 9:00 that evening).\\n\\nThe buffet line starts with a short hot line where you can get your bowl of udon soup or order teppanyaki (with attending chef - Americans know this as \\"hibachi\\" style cooking). I usually at some point order the shrimp and scallops - my favorite off the teppan. There are a couple of additional hot food items - usually some yakitori (chicken or steak) on skewers and sometimes some really delicious seared-rare flank steak.\\n\\nAs the line bends the first corner you hit the nigiri - they're are usually about 10 different varieties - nothing special here and it's not fresh, but I don't expect fresh from a buffet. It's all flash-frozen stuff that still has some great flavor - just not the best but like I said, I'm not picky at this kind of place. The line continues with many, many different rolls. I particularly like the spicy volcano and variations and stay away from the cream cheese - never have liked the consistency. The end of that line will have three or so types of sashimi, some sashimi and ceviche salads, crab legs and oysters when in season (I believe these last two are evening only though).\\n\\nDown the back-side of the line you get most of the cold salad options - I'm particularly fond of the sesame spinach, baby bok choy and sweet eggplant. Grab some seaweed salad here too if they have some on the line and the asparagus - oh and the kimchee of course.\\n\\nThe last part of the line is where they keep the more traditional hot dishes - large filets of broiled fish, some Chinese menu items, occasionally Thai and some noodle dishes and some short ribs. There's also usually some yakisoba, gyoza and marinated chicken or pork. For the most part I skip over these. At the end there's a chef making either meaty tacos with an Asian flair or crepes - there's usually a line so I tend to skip this last part - but do get some hot sticky rice where you're nearby (there's also some fried-rice if you're inclined).\\n\\nThe desserts are at a separate island and it's usually quite extensive - featuring those delicate Korean-style bakery not-too-sweet cakes and my favorite, the coconut cookies (they taste like flattened macaroons!). And for the last, mix the soft-serve green tea ice cream with the vanilla - you'll thank me.\\n\\nThe place is fairly large and there are always families with kids running around - and it's also usually packed with Asians. When you walk in there's a mammoth salt-water fish tank. Parking is plentiful - this is in along the right side of the inverted-U shape of buildings that make up the Northwest corner of Abernathy and Roswell Rd (the LA Fitness is on the left leg of the inverted-U)."},{"name":"Graffiti Junktion Longwood","address":"145 Wekiva Springs Rd","city":"Longwood","stars":"3","text":"Love this place.

They warned us that it was a chain, but that the food was great, so worth a try; also, they, like us, are foodies and we definitely listen when they make suggestions for dining out.  I would also like to add that I am an avid cook, and when I do decide to go out to a restaurant, it's very special and I can be fairly picky about where I decide to spend money for a dining experience.\\n\\nThat being said, I'm sorry to say that we did not even get to try the food because of the sloppy appearance of this restaurant. We went last night on a Saturday in Boulder, which is well known for its tough competition in the restaurant arena. Most places were packed with hungry patrons.  However, while we went somewhat later (8:30pm...late by CO standards), this restaurant was definitely slow compared to other options in the area. Given that, I first noticed how long it took for the hostess to come to greet us at the door. While we waited, I looked around.  I remember noting the eerie quiet in the place to my fiance who totally agreed. From what I observed, the ambiance was not very culturally sound (no hints of South West decor at all), but the contemporary corporate steakhouse decor was pleasant, and the low lighting did create a warm glow that appeals to me. Regardless, I could sense that there was just something off about the energy of the place...Anyway, after about 7 minutes, the hostess finally greeted us to take us back to our seats. I was not that anxious about the wait and I was just glad to be taken to a table, however, on our way there, I immediately noticed the chips crushed ALL OVER the carpet. There was, literally, the equivalent of a full bowl of chips lining the walkway to our table, crushed and being ground into the carpet.  At our table alone, there were about 5 crushed chips sitting there on the floor. I looked at the floor, and then up at the hostess...she just smiled at me blankly; she didn't even seem to notice! \\n\\nWe settled into the booth anyway, but all I could think was, \\"If they're this negligent with the atmosphere, they're definitely going to be just as sloppy with the food and service.\\" Despite my verbalizing this to my fiance, we decided to stay out of convenience as we were really hungry. But, there we waited....and waited. At the 10 minute mark, we still had not received a glass of water or even a, \\"Hey there, I'll be right with you.\\" \\n\\nThe final straw was the splotches of crusty residue stuck to my menu.... I was done. My fiance and I got up and left, crunching over the crushed chips on our way to the door, and we never even saw the waiter.  We went to another restaurant and had one of the best meals in a long time, with fabulous service and impeccable attention to detail...not to mention INCREDIBLE food. Sad about this restaurant though, because I will be telling my friends the terrible experience we had....so sloppy (smh)....seems like it could possibly have potential if they could pull themselves together.

However, I want to make sure people don't make the same mistake we made going here to pickup dinner tonight. Placed an order online for a falafel plate and chicken shawarma plate, got there as they were finishing making it. As I was watching I noticed they were about to put the wrong side on one of the plates, and I reminded them. They also forgot to add the side of hot sauce I paid for, until I reminded them again. After all this, I still was willing to give it a fair shot because I love shawarma, I was hungry, and the food looked great aesthetically. However, when we got home 5 minutes later and started eating this food, we were beyond disappointed. First- they ignored instructions to not add onions due to an allergy, and there were onions all over the plate. Second- the chicken was bone dry and hard as a rock, I could only chew through a few bites of it. In addition to being inedible, it was also flavorless. I tried using their hot sauce and it was all bite and zero flavor. I added sriracha and feta from my fridge, but even those additions couldn't save the meal. The hummus, tahini, and falafel all had great texture, but again NO FLAVOR WHATSOEVER. The rice was plain and also very dry. The pita bread was chewy but also stale? I don't get it. The salad and grape leaves were the only decent part of the meal, and even those weren't that great. I honestly don't know how this place has high reviews unless this was a particularly \\"off\\" night for them (even though on a Saturday night at 6pm you should have your s--- together).

Amazing chipotle sauce. \\n\\nBe warned the diablo sauce that comes with some of the tacos, like the brushfire, is very spicy! (but has a good taste still, not too overpowering). The queso is very good! They have local brewed sodas available from the fountains. FYI this place also has a \\"secret menu\\" just search online and they can whip those tacos up too!\\n\\nThis is a place where you go to the register and order and they bring the food to the table. We went during a busy lunch time, but they managed to get us through the line quickly and we didn't wait long for the food either! \\n\\nPrices are very reasonable tacos range from $3 and change to $5 a piece. Two tacos is definitely enough to fill up the average person.\\n\\nHighly recommend this place, I just wish there was one closer to home. So far they are just in Colorado, Texas, and Oklahoma."},{"name":"Simha Authentic Multi Cuisine Fine Dine Restaurant & Bar","address":"5486 Chamblee Dunwoody Rd, Ste 13","city":"Dunwoody","stars":"3.5","text":"Love this place!

So as a weird form of redemption I decided to yelp about my favorite seafood place in Boston: The Daily Catch!  I hear there are two locations but I've only ever been to the one in the North End and it is DIVINE.  As with a couple other favorites of mine in Boston, The Daily Catch doesn't take reservations and even on a weekday the wait can be long.  I end up waiting at least thirty minutes every time I go and they're really bad about time estimations here BUT you can use this time constructively to go withdraw the cash you'll need to pay for your meal (sorry, cash only).  Okay, now for the good stuff: the fish is definitely the freshest I've had here in Boston and probably in the top three for New England.  Get the calamari for your appetizer or maybe get after the recently added calamari meatballs (I've never had it so I can't say).  The Monkfish Marsala is unique and like all the fish entrees, it comes with a choice side of pasta (you choose the pasta type and sauce I think) and their tomato sauce is out of control good: it's wholesome, full of tomato flavor and I feel good about eating it! (unlike most pasta sauces that taste closer to something artificial like ketchup)  The pan-seared swordfish is pretty darn good too and no frills - just fish.  Since all the fish is fresh, you get to enjoy the actual flavors of the fish, usually masked by fishiness.  Nothing fishy about the fish here!

We had a reservation but unfortunately had to cancel it due to unforeseen events. We arrived and while the wait was approx. 90 mins, we decided to grab a drink and wait. We all had heard such good things and honestly, we were too lazy to walk somewhere else in the cold. We put our names in for both a table and for the bar. We grabbed a drink and kept our eyes peeled for people leaving! Thankfully, one seat opened that the bartender let us sit at while waiting for two other spots to open up. They had a great selection of beer, wine, and spirits as well as food! We went with oysters to start as my faux-mom and I are obsessed with oysters. We asked the bartender about the different types of oysters while she inquired back what type we liked. She recommended doing a variety of both briny and salty. We ordered a dozen and had 2 of each variety. Seriously, all of them were delicious! Row 34 might have been my favorite though. We finally all had a seat at the bar and were fine with foregoing a table since our bartender was so great. I had the swordfish complimented with some mussels. This was my first time to have swordfish and it did NOT disappoint! The f'rents were a bit nervous as they both are not big fans of the taste/texture of swordfish but I like to venture out. Once she said it came with mussels, I was convinced to try it! If I could have licked my plate clean I would have! My f'dad had the lobster roll. It was huge and also, did not disappoint.

The young gentlemen that took our order was not as bad as I had read about.  Not really enthused to be working but not at all rude.  His demeanor does remind me of many Vietnamese waiters/waitresses I have encountered at other different Vietnamese restaurants (I can say this because I am Vietnamese and know my fair share), short, not overly friendly, and unenthused.  Overall, not a bad place to get reasonable priced pho.  Just a side note for people who don't understand what to do with the dish of bean sprouts, Thai basil, and lime, the condiments are meant to go into your pho.

You will have to wait until the last week of October 2013 if you want to enjoy another unique Atlanta barbecue experience. \\n\\nI walked over here with my girlfriend because Lunacy was closed for a private event. Castleberry Hill had one of its usual art events and we wound up checking out this new barbecue place. Again, this place is technically not open. And the first night (and sometimes the first month or several months) tends to have kinks and Smoke Ring had a few. \\n\\nIt started with the pork rinds. These were covered in paprika dust. They were not warm, and some of the rinds were completely burnt and unpleasant to bite through.\\n\\nSome of the best wings I've ever had! No sauce necessary. Get a side of the spicy Georgia sauce if the white Alabama style sauce is not your thing. Or, you know, you want to live past 35 without a triple bypass...\\n\\nThis pork sandwich was really interesting. The poppy seed bun was standard and unfortunately room temperature. Whatever, pre-opening night problems. It's cool. There was a lot of slaw on top of the pork that is drenched in a thin mayonnaise. I'm not really a big fan of mayonnaise cole slaw. I like the Carolina style slaw with vinegar. Also, the cook told me that the sandwich was supposed to have a Georgia sweet-spicy sauce on it, but I couldn't taste it. I got some on the side. It's actually a really great sauce that packs a little punch. \\n\\nLet's get down to business about that pork though. This is not a pulled pork sandwich. The pork comes out in little cubes and you get a more porkerrific (TM) flavor out of that sloppy pulled pork you usually see at other bbq joints. This place put in some real effort to make their pork and it showed. I would eat a plate of just that. It tasted great with the spicy bbq sauce.\\n\\nThe sandwich came with a side of jalapeno cornbread that was overly dry. This thing was crumbly but not moist. It was almost inedible, but I was really hungry.\\n\\nThe cook actually came back to our table to solicit feedback. I told him pretty much everything on here: great wings, great pork, overly dry cornbread, burnt pork rinds.\\n\\nI'm giving an extra star because our waitress agreed to heat up our peach cobbler that we purchased down the block since Smoke Ring was not serving dessert. We asked her to just microwave the thing for us. She said she had to sell her body to get the kitchen staff to dump the thing into a pan because they don't even have a microwave.  Above and beyond service deserves a mention and recognition.\\n\\nI'll definitely be back to this place when they officially open to see if they've worked out the kinks and to see if they can serve up brisket that can go toe-to-toe with the barbecue heavyweights of Texas."},{"name":"Rudy's \\"Country Store\\" and Bar-B-Q","address":"11570 Research Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Stopped by last night since the hub got a coupon for 1/2 lb free for his upcoming b-day (thank you, Rudy's!)

I don't even know where to start. The food combination they have is absolutely mind blowing.

They have no meat whatsoever in their menu yet they have the most filling choices ever.

The apps were great! The waitress was the farthest thing from being attentive and when asked something by anyone in our party, she seemed very put out and seemed like she just wanted out of there. Waiting 20 minutes for drinks also was an issue. And being what appeared to be ignored, we would have to ask the bus boys for horseradish and other condiments for the oysters and a women who we're not sure what her role was had to get my friend his wine (twice). \\n\\nIn ending I would say all and all the food and oysters were good but I think overrated and very, very expensive. \\n\\nAs for our waitress I think she should look for another line of work.

Made a last minute decision of wanting a steak so I cancelled my dinner reservations to The Optimist. My husband had called on the same day to make a last minute reservation and the only available time was 10pm. To me it was a late but for a damn good steak? I'll take it. Even told the ladies on the phone that we will be celebrating our 1 year anniversary. I'm stoked. I did so much research before even making this reservation. Upon arriving two ladies at the host stand greeted us and even said congratulations on your one yr and asked us when are we having kids lol. I jokingly said never. She then promptly seated us at a booth next to the bar. I actually loved the booth table because it was nice and spacious. Candle lit on every table :) Our server was Shawn. He introduced himself and gave us highlights of what the restaurant was known for. Again keep in mind this is around 10:15 and they close at 11:00pm. While I was looking at the menu my husband and I were not exactly sure what to order. Called Shawn to give us some recommendations. He sounded like he was in a hurry or he just didn't really care what we were going to order. Husband and I decided to order lobster fritters, baked escargot and a glass of riesling for myself to start. For dinner we picked a 6oz filet mignon(medium), 20oz ribeye(med well... husband never liked med rare or medium that's the way he likes it), creamed corn, parmesan french fries, and creamed spinach. Our steak was also accompanied by 2 sauces. 1)House steak sauce 2)Black truffle butter. We both very much enjoyed the appetizers. My steak was a perfect medium and portion sized. My husbands ribeye was good. But I'm pretty sure it would've been much tastier if it was a medium ;) The side dishes were plentiful. Overall the food I give it a solid 4 stars. We did have a lot of leftovers so we had the rest boxed up. We asked for a dessert menu after and he brought us two. The only thing that really captured my eye was the creme br√ªl√©e. Still decided not to order anything because Hostess said that they give a complimentary anniversary dessert. Our bill came out to $177.50 I left a $30 cash tip. Now to the negative reviews. I felt like Shawn wasn't a very attentive server. Throughout the whole dinner service he forgot to refill our waters and gave all his other tables more attention. Im not sure if its that the other tables had a bottle of wine or they ordered more.. and he decided to give us less attention. It made me upset to the CORE that this was my anniversary dinner and I got NO love from my waiter. I felt like he was just trying to hurry up, make his money and get out of the restaurant. I understand that I came and made a reservation at 10pm. It just means you shouldn't treat me any different. I am still a customer, I came for a wonderful dining experience and it was my 1 year anniversary dinner that ruined. So Shawn for that I give you 2 stars for your customer service.

Can you not steal my attention away while I'm trying to finish work early to go to yoga? Ever since I had a bite of those chicken wings of yours, I realized that my life had been forever altered because I could never order wings from a mediocre Irish bar anymore. Do you realize what that means? This will create substantial financial burden onto my already dismal looking bank account, in which I should just cancel because student loans took away my savings anyway. \\n\\nChef Andy Ricker, unless you are ready for a college girl taking a risk to become even more broke than she is by taking regular trips to PDX for your wings, I think you should really come to LA and host a class. Host a class and I will call all of my friends, who are also in love with your wings, to join you in your wings revolution. It's about time that America should use fish sauce as a marinade; it's about time to ditch the god-knows-what's-in-there ranch dipping sauce that is used to cover the frozen-tasting and soggy wings. Are you ready? ARE YOU READY? Once you are, please call me at (310) EAT-WING. I will be honored to be your first follower.\\n\\nOther than the wings, everything else was absolutely amazing. So amazing that the 30 minute wait under the stormy weather was almost forgotten by the end of the meal. I felt as though I had escaped from the chilly winds of Portland with that cup of chrysanthemum Hot Toddy. I am forever grateful for your food.

To me this dish was awesome! So flavorful and super tender meat. Pair it with their coconut rice that actually tasted like coconut! Most places claim it's coconut rice but hardly has the flavor of the coconut. \\n\\nI think this place just got too hyped up for me. My husband and I heard nothing but good things about their famous pok pok chicken wings and it's a must try if you come to Portland. So of course we had to come and try it. We were already told by everyone that we spoke to, including Yelpers that you can't avoid a wait. So we were already expecting to wait for awhile since we were stopping in on a Friday. Luckily, two seats opened up at the bar right when we walked up to the hostess. Thank goodness too cause it was quite hot for an evening dinner to be sitting in the outside dining area, we visited in the later part of September. \\n\\nThe restaurant is definitely a lively one, with all the tables packed and workers rushing around to accommodate their tables.

He did a great job serving us while still keeping up with his cocktail orders from the whole restaurant.\\n\\nHere's what we ordered:\\n-Pok pok chicken: Definitely disappointed because it was too hyped up. Everyone failed to mention that the chicken is not crispy!!! Even in photos the chicken looks a little bit crispy. Instead we got overly sauced soggy chicken wings. For us the sauce was way too salty, our Filipino culture can normally handle salty things cause we use fish sauce too but for this dish it was just over powering. I can normally find something that I care for in a dish but this time I was just not feeling it. \\n\\n-Kaeng Hang Leh: Pork belly and pork shoulder curry: I would definitely get this for to-go if we come back here! The one dish I would come back for.\\n\\n-Pham buung fai daeng: On Choy dish. Also good but I would ask for it to be not spicy, way too hot for me. I do like spicy food.\\n\\n-Coconut rice: This rice can actually claim that it's coconut. Nice aroma for sure. \\n\\n-Yam tuna: Just okay.\\n\\n-Their still water: Had to mention this because it was a nice surprise that their still water had a hint of coconut as well. I liked that touch.\\n\\nRestrooms: Two separate stalls that are shared by both men and women.

Had the filet last time, wasn't anything special, also had tomato bisque which is good but not as good as 101 Beer Kitchens.  However, what surprised me was the clam chowder which is only served on certain nights....I've had a lof of clam chowder in a lot of places including New England and this was probably one of the best if not the best I've had.  Tons and tons of clams, in fact, so much clam I'm not sure how they made any money on it.  Most places have tons of potato and lack on the clams.  This chowder was thinner with fewer potatoes and more clams.  \\n\\nThe cheese plate is one of our favorites, we usually get it every other time.  Plenty of cheese for the price.\\n\\nThe short ribs like the beef tenderloin are about 3 stars out of 5, I do like them better than the tenderloin if I want beef.  \\n\\nThe kids mac n cheese is excellent, my sister in law took their leftover home for her lunch the next day.
