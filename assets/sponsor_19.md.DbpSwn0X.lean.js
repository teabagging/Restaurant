It's a shame that Greg and Mike (formerly known as Creekslice & had amazing, know-your-name type service). They had sold the business to the new owners who have been operating Megabite there since 2015.\\n\\nNeedless to say, anyone who is a local or repeat customer will tell you the miserable lady at the counter is downright rude, pessimistic, and treats you like pond scum. It's sad because the lady's husband/co-owner is actually a very nice guy and understands the concept of how to treat people like actual people. The lady, however, needs to be given a different role. \\n\\nNo sexism, this is just the downright experience you'll receive as reaffirmed by the other reviews. I've given this place a chance multiple times and have many stories about her. The last time I'll ever eat their pizza. \\n\\nI'm not expecting that of a gourmet restaurant and nor do I expect to be waited on hand and foot by any means, however;\\n\\n1). When I see her scrolling Facebook on the company computer with her back turned to the public behind the counter and she rudely says wait 2 minutes! While she finishes posting? Pathetic. \\n\\n2). When it's 8 pm and the closing says 10 pm and she'll lock the doors and deny you because it's slow and raining outside? Unacceptable. \\n\\n3). You try to take the ranch or hot sauce from the designated spot for more than 10 seconds and she'll bark at you to put it back because it might \\"confuse the other customers\\" even though there's maybe 6 stools inside and the total floor space is a 8x10 foot spot lol. Like what is that?!\\n\\n4). This summer I was sent on a staff run to buy 2 pizzas for a fireworks night and she literally took 12 minutes (yes, I timed it) for her to even address me being there. She finally did and said what do you want? Rudely, and carelessly.  She refused to even warm the slices as well because it was too busy. \\n\\nI have never retaliated nor said a word of bad towards her and I wish I had the opportunity to voice my concern respectfully, but I know she wouldn't care to hear it. I've always thought of pity rather and to sum it all up, this establishment is an embarrassment to the hard working businesses and the Granville Island experience that makes up the second most visited space in all of Canada. Especially considering the hop on hop off bus runs right out front of it. \\n\\nLady, you need to take a different position or flat out find a new career. Customer service isn't working for you and you clearly have no appreciation for the customers. To the husband, I do apologize for having to write this. I hope you keep doing your best to make people feel good when they visit; this business hangs on by a thread because of your true kindness and I hope you can seek a new avenue of general customer service.

The egg was luscious and would be my primary reason for going back.  I asked the waitress how they cooked the egg, and she actually went into the kitchen to find out.

Only one waiter manning both the front and bartending. The inside has about 9-10 tables. It's nice that both the windows and doors are open to give the place an open air vibe. \\n\\nMenu is two pages: soups, salads& appetizers, fresh mussels, entrees, viandes (meats) and poissons (fish). \\n\\n- Caesar ($7.50)\\n- Bellini ($10.00) - Stoli vodka, peach schnapps, orange juice and sparkling wine. B's mom was expecting it to be more like a slushy than a martini.\\n- Mussels ($19.50) - comes with a basket of bread and frites. The bread is perfect to soak up with the sauce but they don't give you enough. The fries were terrible; dry and not crispy. We went with the carthago sauce (cumin & spicy harissa) which was tasty but on its own, way too salty. \\n- Bread ($2.00) - an extra side of bread will cost you. Lame that they charge that much but at least it's slightly toasted.\\n- Carthage ($28.00) - a combination of merguez, sausage, lamb shank and chicken over a bed of couscous, vegetables and tomato sauce. This was easily the best main of the night. The couscous went wonderfully with the homemade sauce. Loved that you got a mix of meats. The lamb shank was excellent, fall off the bone. Sausage had a good kick to it. Chicken was tender.\\n- Chicken tagine ($24.00) - olives, peas and potatoes in lemon, cilantro and saffron broth. It doesn't come in a tagine (like it does at Moltaqa) but the sauce was tasty. Lemon comes through and B's dad brought it home for leftovers. Chicken was tender and both the peas and potatoes were good although we would have liked more. This dish desperately needed some sort of carb. \\n- Lamb chops ($26.00) - served with fries and Tunisian salad. Lamb chops were topped in a Tunisian style mint sauce. Four pieces of lamb chops (we requested medium). Cooked well but the sauce was very subtle. Barely got a hint of the mint. Salad was completely overdressed and again, the fries were disappointing. \\n- Bouillabaisse ($28.00) - catch of the day with scallops, prawns and mussels in a saffron broth. Good amount of mussels, two prawns, one scallop and a mix of salmon and a white fish (likely halibut). Salmon was flaky and tender. Halibut was the complete opposite; so dry and overcooked. Again, a carb would have been ideal. Not worth the price point here. \\n\\nAlways interesting to try a new cuisine.

Most restaurants use like a spicy cream to season their tuna, but this place uses some kind of spicy sesame kind of oil and it is delicious! \\n\\nThe one thing that wasn't great was the ramen.

Combos come with meat/seafood, a basket of assorted vegetables, and a choice of noodles, so you get a good variety if you don't want to order a la carte. Plenty of options if you want to supplement the combo or create your own dish, though.

While wine is the business' main focus, there's also a restaurant, cooking school, and private event space. The business opened in October 2012, hidden in a corner of the Georgetown Shopping Center (Kroger) just outside the perimeter, right off I-285 exit 30 (Chamblee Dunwoody Road).\\n\\nIf you love wine, you'll probably like this place. They offer over 200 wines by the bottle which, to me, is an overwhelming amount. You can sign up for a membership into their wine club to get first dibs on new wine selections, special pricing, discounts, free tastings and more. There's a wine bar, wine classes, a retail store, and Enomatic machines if you want to sample or try wines in smaller and more affordable servings.\\n\\nI think the Enomatic machines are really neat. There are three of them, one outfitted with white wines, one with reds, and one with premium wines. If you're not familiar with Enomatic machines, they are automatic wine dispensing machines that allow you to pour 1-oz, 2.5-oz, and 5-oz servings of wine into a glass while preserving (not allowing any oxygen into) the remaining wine inside the bottle and keeping it at the appropriate temperature. Vino Venue's Enomatic machines serve 8 wines each (32 wines on the Enomatic machines total).\\n\\nAnyone can sign up for a Vino Venue card and load it with money. This can only be done in-store. You can't load a card online. You insert your chip-read card into the Enomatic machine and select the wine and serving size you want. Prices vary by wine, of course, but to give you an idea, I tried a 1-oz serving of Cooper & Thief's red wine blend (aged for 3 months in bourbon whiskey barrels) for $2.40. A 2.5-oz serving was $6 and 5.0 oz was $12. I think a 750 ml (about 25 oz) bottle costs about $30 plus tax, so you are paying a small premium for the convenience of the individual servings, but you don't have to commit to a whole bottle. This is a great way to sample and try several different wines.\\n\\nFood-wise, Vino Venue serves French and New American cuisine. For example, they offer items like truffle mac and cheese ($11), duck confit flatbread ($12), coq au vin ($16), and ratatouille ($11). Appetizers and shareable plates typically range in price from $8-16 and entrees $10-20+ each. They offer cheese and charcuterie too. The Executive Chef is Patric Good who's previously worked at restaurants such as Chicken and the Egg (Marietta) and Max's Wine Dive (Midtown).\\n\\nCooking classes run the gamut from French and European cuisine to Southern food to even sushi rolling. Chef Melissa Pelkey Haas is the lead event chef and she teaches many of the classes. The classes run about $80 per class (some more, some less) and include multi-course meals with wine pairings. Vino Venue has a nice classroom with a demonstration kitchen.\\n\\nI attended the Discover France event this past Sunday, September 24, 2017 (http://vinovenue.com/shop/Discover-France.html). This was a 2.5-hour food and wine tasting event with a smorgasbord of French food and unlimited tastings of over 70 different types of wine. Tickets were $79 per person. It was a well-attended event; I think perhaps a sellout. All hands were on deck for this event. Chef Patric, chef Melissa, and the rest of the crew were on-hand to make sure everyone had a good time.\\n\\nFood included:\\n\\n* Duck rilletes\\n* Vichyssoise soup\\n* Salmon mousse\\n* Chicken liver pate\\n\\nCheese:\\n* Fleur Vert (goat)\\n* Fourme d'Ambert (cow)\\n* Comte (cow)\\n* Brillat Savarin (cow)\\n* Oussau-Iraty (sheep)\\n* Mimolette (cow)\\n\\nCharcuterie:\\n* Duck mousse\\n* Pate de Campagne (pork)\\n* Saucisson (pork)\\n\\n* Quiche Lorraine\\n* Pissaladierre (French anchovy flatbread)\\n* Gougeres\\n\\nDessert:\\n* Raspberry mousse\\n* Croissants\\n* Chocolate croissants\\n* Pot de creme (dark chocolate)\\n\\nThere was also rare steak being sliced and served (with mustard and horseradish), but I missed out. It seemed to disappear within the first 30-45 minutes of the event. In general, I enjoyed the food. Aside from the imported cheeses, just about everything else was made in-house. My favorites were the Vichyssoise (leek, onion, potato, cream soup), mousses and pates, the Quiche Lorraine, and the gougeres. The Vichyssoise was flavorful, the quiche was savory, and the gourgeres were soft, cheesy, and delectable. The cheese and charcuterie were served with a variety of crackers/biscuits along with a yummy Croatian fig spread (Dalmatia).\\n\\nAlong with the Cooper & Thief red wine blend, I also sampled Lede de Labegorce Margaux and Domaine Bulliat Morgan \\"Nature\\" Gamay (2016). These were also red wines. I'm not a wine connoisseur, but I prefer reds and I thought these were delicious. Thank you to chef Melissa for recommending them to me.\\n\\nAll of the staff I met were nice including partner/manager Rob Van Leer. Overall, I had a good time at the event.\\n\\nAlong with the bar and dining room inside, Vino Venue also has covered outdoor seating with tables and cushioned patio furniture."},{"name":"Kobe Japanese Steakhouse - Orlando","address":"5605 S Kirkman Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"I'll be honest that the last few times my family and I have been to Kobe's we were thinking of giving up on the chain, but tonight changed our minds.

That being said, we use Yelp quite frequently and used it to find this restaurant after reading good things about it.\\n\\nEach of us started out with a Mai Tai which were tasty and just the right amount of rum (though a little pricey, at $10.00 a pop).  Crab Rangoon and Pork Dumplings with Spicy Peanut sauce for starters were a mixed bag.  The Rangoons were bland and greasy while the Pork Dumplings, although flavorful arrived barely warm.  The chili sauce was wonderful with just the right amount of heat.  Just the way I like it.  \\n\\nEach of our party order their own entrees of which I had a taste of.  General Tso's Chicken was ordered with less spice but was still tasty with a light batter, tender chicken and just the right amount of sauce.  Moo Shoo Pork was another entr√©e that was very flavorful with just the right amount of pork, veggies and mushrooms and not too salty like some.  House Special Fried Rice was light and flavorful, the only issue is that they skimped on the \\"Special\\".  It could have used a little more of the \\"good stuff\\", as momma used to call it.\\n\\nHere is where it goes downhill.  I ordered the Steamed Whole Fish with Ginger and Scallions.  The platter arrived with the Tilapia swimming, and I mean swimming (no pun intended) in a pool of sauce that was mainly soy sauce.  I could taste no ginger whatsoever.  I attempted to get the waiter to oblige me by getting me some of the chili sauce that I had experienced from the Pork Dumpling appetizer to see if I could salvage the dish, but there was a communication issue that was never resolved.  After several attempts I decided that I was not happy with my dish and reluctantly sent it back.  At this point my hunger pangs had diminished after a drink, appetizer, fried rice and picking off of my co-diners dishes, but I decided to order something else thinking that I would have a few bites of it and bring the rest home.\\n\\nThis time I ordered Shrimp with Chili Sauce.  Even though all previous dishes came out in a timely manner, this one did not.  And by the time it did arrive, my dining partners were finished with their meals.  But, when the plate was put in front of me I thought to myself, this shrimp looks odd.  Well that was because it was Baby Eggplant with Chili Sauce.  Even though I was disappointed in not getting what I ordered, I kept what was served as I do like eggplant cooked in this manner.  Again, the sauce was great with just the right amount of heat.\\n\\nWhen the time arrived for us to pay our bill, we noticed that the sent back fish was not taken off the check.  One of my co-diners approached the waiter to ask him about this and was steered to the manager who informed him that he would do it this one time as this dish is expensive to make.  First of all, it is not good business to leave an item on a check after a guest doesn't like it.  Especially after consuming only a bite or two.  Secondly, Tilapia is one of the most inexpensive fish you can buy.\\n\\nObviously management needs to get a fortune cookie with a fortune in it that reads something like \\"Absolute Guest Satisfaction is our Highest Priority\\"\\n\\nI would go back though, with hesitation."},{"name":"Renata","address":"626 SE Main St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Ate here for the first time recently and was very impressed.

Their price point is about on par with other bakeries. They are always friendly when we come in to pick up a few items. \\n\\nThis is my issue with Mozart's. When I was a little girl, my mom would take me to a bakery in the short north called Giantonios. Mozart's first location was in the old Giantonios location. From what we were told when Mozart's first came here, they had bought the cream horn recipe from the owners of Giantonios. We were ecstatic since these were the pastries that always brought us to Giantonios! At first things were great. Mozart's was making the large size cream horns that we had loved for so many years! Then they had three sizes: small, medium and large. Even better! Now, they only have the small and they aren't loaded with the amount of cream that they were loaded with when Giantonios had the recipe. Also, a few times now I have bought some of the small cream horns and the cream doesn't go all the way through. It's a big disappointment. I contacted Mozart's through email a few years ago, because I wanted to put in a special order for my mom for the large cream horns to surprise her on her birthday. They said they couldn't do that. Highly disappointing. My mom loves those large cream horns so much that when they were coming from Giantonios when I was a child, and we had moved to California, my aunt brought out a suitcase full of them for my mom! So, not being able to get a special order for these, even though Mozart's has made this size in the past, was very sad. They didn't even want to help a customer who only goes to them for this specific pastry. I thought they did custom orders but apparently I was wrong. That instance put a bad taste in my mouth and we now only go to Mozart's once or twice a year. If anyone has the recipe for these cream horns, I would love to have it!"},{"name":"Pho Extreme Xe Lua","address":"457 W Broadway","city":"Vancouver","stars":"2.5","text":"I was a bit weary seeing some bad reviews for this restaurant but I was hungry and had a group of 5 people with me.

I went for Sunday brunch with three friends, arriving promptly at 11:30 AM to beat the crowds.  We sat on the patio, but probably should have opted for inside in order to enjoy the live jazz band that they have for Sunday brunch.  The inside was absolutely beautiful, and the patio was large and fabulous as well.  My two biggest gripes about Watershed are the service and price.  \\n\\nOur server was very nice, but one of the worst I've had in a really long time.  (It pains me to write that having been a server forever, but this was pretty bad, especially for such an upscale restaurant.)  Going with the fact that Watershed is a Southern themed restaurant, our server can best be summed up as follows: bless her heart, this girl was slow as molasses.  I got an unsweet tea refill when I was drinking Diet Coke.  She took forever to bring the drink menu and the drinks when the place clearly wasn't that busy.  To top it all off, she came back out to confirm how do divide up the bill.  It was really quite simple: two people on one tab, another by herself, and I was picking up the appetizer for the table.  Despite double checking how to divide the bill, I got charged for a friend's mimosa.  It wasn't even worth the effort or time of having it corrected, but it was a little annoying to get $9 unnecessarily tacked onto your already expensive meal.\\n\\nThat brings me to my next issue with Watershed.  It's kind of really expensive for small portions and not that great of food.  Don't get me wrong, everything was really good but not particularly memorable.  We had a crab and crawfish beignet amongst the table.  $10, approximately 1.5 bites per person.  I had some sort of shrimp, crawfish, and crab over grits entr√©e.  Delicious, but I'd scarfed it down in less than 3 minutes and was kind of still hungry.  There was literally one bite of crab and two shrimp.  I was least blown away looking at one of my friend's plates of eggs, bacon, and a biscuit.  Everything was way more expensive than your standard Atlanta brunch , and I would prefer the gigantic, delightful, and significantly cheaper brunch at Another Broken Egg any day.\\n\\nAll of this said, I would go back to the bar potentially or else on a dinner date (where I was not paying).  Watershed tries, but falls short as far as I'm concerned.

Sometimes, just the soup base can run for $10 at some restaurants. \\n\\nWe had the Lunch combo for $10 that comes with your selection of meat and a variety of veggies, noodles, tofu and fishballs. We chose the house original soup base since the spicy ma la one was not our style. Overall, the whole experience was good... however, I didn't find any of their ingredients to be really fresh. All the ingredients seemed lower quality.. at least what was offered in the lunch specials. Maybe if we ordered off the regular menu, the items would be more fresh? \\n\\nAlso, all the dipping sauces are extra..I guess they make the soup base salty enough where you don't require the sauces. Solid experience, but I think I prefer Shabu on Anderson Ln where the ingredients are better."},{"name":"Centro Mexican Kitchen","address":"950 Pearl St","city":"Boulder","stars":"4","text":"The food is good no doubt about it.

Have never heard of, but a yelp event tossed out the invitation. This is likely a place I would have not heard of as I live in Central Austin and rarely get downtown. Parking in the surrounding areas is not a problem so that is always a plus. Walking in was welcomed by the friendly staff and the place is a nice clean and open space. It does echo in here making it hard to hear the person across from you if there are crowds of people. I got the fries and a cheeseburger with Swiss cheese. First the fries. They were nice, a crispy exterior and fluffy on the inside. That ketchup they have can not be ignored good. Now the burger. True to it's name it is little. Like 3-4 bites inhaled little. It was a good burger but gimmicky small at the $5+tax level. For an adorable Instagram picture snack it might suffice. For an outright meal, if you are semi hungry it is underwhelming.

Several times i had ordered the cazcabel with chicken as a  meat substitute. They had always approved. My friends had witnessed several times this substitute. this day we sat for 15 minutes in an empty restaurant as the \\"manager\\" closed out a table on the patio. There was another waiter wondering but we were left unattended until we asked to be served at least drinks. When it was time to order the waiter did the usual to ask the cook for the substitute.  Then the \\"manager\\" came out and refused to substitute. What was worse was the argument that ensued with the manager repeatedly insisting that the substitute had never happened. After a shower of yelling and disrespect the \\"manager\\" asked me to leave the restaurant. Then called his owner to tell him i wanted something that was not ever on the menu. All i wanted was a substitute or at least an apology. My friend mentioned he should apologize to me then he kicked us all out. THE worsted service i have EVER received at a restaurant.

I frequently drag him to nice restaurants (poor baby!) and he grins and bares it. Kind of like the couple in Green Acres...\\n\\nMe:  The stores!\\nHim:  The chores!\\n\\nHim:  Fresh air!\\nMe:  Times Square!\\n\\nI might be exaggerating a little, but once year, dining out in Portland is all about him. And the wonderful Mr. K has a thing for BBQ. All types of BBQ, but ever since he went to Korea on business a few years ago, he developed a deep fondness for Korean BBQ where you grill your own meat at the table. Unfortunately this is a bit of a tall order in Portland.... not like Thai food which is on every corner. But thanks to a tip from the Yelp squad last year, we headed to Toji.\\n\\nYou can order individual entrees or combination meals for a larger group. I should note up front that this is a relatively expensive place to dine, so I highly recommend coming with a group so you can share the expense as well as the fun of sampling and tasting a little bit of everything. For our first experience, even though it was just the two of us, we chose a combination meal with four different meats and our favorite was the brisket. It also came with six banchan (side dishes) with spicy kimchi, green beans, bean curd, marinated potatoes, a plate of cooked calamari in sauce, rice bowls, lettuce wraps and a delicious soup.  \\n\\nIt was an enjoyable meal and the only downer was the slow start to service. It took them quite awhile to take our order, but once it was placed, things arrived quickly. When the server brought the food out, she did a nice job explaining what everything was and how long to cook the meat, etc. And she presented us with meat scissors.  I think every meal should have meat scissors.\\n\\nAfter that experience, I wanted to return, but was convinced that it would be more enjoyable with a group. I thought they wouldn't appreciate the meal (and had Gladstone Coffee and Pizza as my Plan B), but for our return visit we decided to bring the boys and they absolutely loved it.\\n\\nJust like dad, they were endlessly entertained by cooking their own meat and ate A LOT of everything. They even tasted some of the side dishes and tried to steal scraps of food from the grill. We ordered four adult entrees (chicken in a ginger marinade, steak, brisket and shrimp with scallops) and the steak was our favorite this time around. Our table was completely covered, and there wasn't a bite left.  \\n\\nToji is just a block from JacIva if you have room for dessert (not likely) and a few blocks from Sapphire Hotel if you want pre- or post-cocktails.  I definitely put this in my child friendly category since the meats aren't overly seasoned and the BBQ action keeps them occupied. They also offer a couple kids' menu items like teriyaki chicken. This is definitely our special occasion Korean spot, but I'm still on the hunt for more casual Korean BBQ joints in town. If you have any favorites, please send them my way. My kids are already begging for more Korean food.\\n\\nEpilogue - Based on the wild success of this experience, we now have a weekly family meal in a different Asian restaurant and I've downgraded my initial five stars to four now that we've dined at So Kong Dong Tofu & BBQ."},{"name":"Buffalo Wild Wings","address":"2860 Cumberland Mall SE, Ste 1630","city":"Atlanta","stars":"2","text":"Saw reviews before I went.

I loved it so much I brought my girlfriends back and raved about it. My credibility was a bit damaged after this trip. The meal started off fine with our server telling us the specials (which he did a great job explaining because each of the specials were ordered at our table :)) and getting our drink orders in right away. He was very pleasant. We were waiting on a couple of our guests to arrive (who ended up not showing up due to personal issues) and in our servers defense, we did say we were going to wait for them. We figured this wasn't a big deal because there were literally only 4 other parties in the dining room. When he came around to check on us, we said we'd give our missing guests 5 more minutes and then we'd place our orders. After 25 minutes of waiting (after we told him we'd order in 5 minutes) and then trying to make eye contact with him each time he served his other two tables (running back and forth several times to the same tables and not looking at us), he finally saw me wave and he put up the \\"one moment\\" finger and ran away again. He didn't come back again for several minutes. At this point we've only had one round of cocktails and haven't placed our food order. When he came around, he seemed flustered. We ordered another round of cocktails and our food. He brought out my bloody mary which was supposed to be made a little spicier and it had NO spice in it. I asked him for some horseradish and he disappeared only to come back 10 minutes later and tell us he had forgotten to place our food order so it was being expedited. And he didn't bring horseradish. He leaves again for several minutes and brings it back. Finally our food comes out (we've now been there 90 minutes). He did bring us another round of drinks on the house which was nice. And we were not in a hurry because we were chatting and catching up. The food was delicious (although my girlfriend had to remind him for her side of salad dressing and waited minutes for that too), but I'm just not sure how a nearly empty restaurant has service that slow for Sunday brunch.

Peter is very cordial. The bread is homemade and nothing like you've ever had before. The pies are all homemade and tasty, if you have room for dessert after eating all the bread. The dinners are ok but a bit expensive.\\nHere's the downfall. The service. Very slow. No one seems happy that they even work there. It takes forever to even be acknowledged. They have some girls working to support the ladies who are the actual servers, that really have no waitress or customer service experience. The past 3 times we visited this establishment, the same poor service. I ordered a glass of wine from one of the girls, since the ladies that wait on you are so slow, and she brought me a mini bottle and a glass and said \\"here\\". Couldn't even open it and pour it. \\n\\nYou spend your hard earned money going out for an evening of dining and fun, and you just get aggravated between each course because of the time it takes. After 3 times with the same results, I will not be returning. There are wonderful Italian restaurants in the area that are not only delicious but make it fun. This place is really geared towards the older retired set who enjoy just have nothing else to do but eat slow, ok food and try to find something to talk about in between servings.

This past Spring my sister was visiting from St Louis and always searches out seafood while veered and tried their whole fried clams.

There's nothing better than good quality, locally fresh fried seafood. \\n\\nFiguring that the restaurant would be busy on this special day,this year we decided for Pop's comfort we would take-in, so I called in the order. I was greeted on the phone by a very courteous person and at the end of the order, she informed me that the Fire River Bridge was open, and they would not start to cook our order until it was back down. They wanted to make sure the order was nice and hot when picked up. How thoughtful! \\n\\nWhen I picked up the order, the restaurant was bustling with activity. All the staff were engaged, kind and attentive to their guests. Our order was fresh from the kitchen and indeed hot. Once home, and the feast spread out, we found it hot, fresh and delicious. The fish and clams were lightly breaded, the the quality of the chicken tenders for the grandbabies was exceptional, and the fries were cooked to perfection. \\n\\nPortions were generous, quality has very high, service was fast and accurate, and staff very welcoming.

The atmosphere is very unique, with the vast indoor space (1st and 2nd floor seating available) and beautiful outdoor patio (open seating), the live music, and the waiters/waitresses dressed up in German costumes. Other people have mentioned the long wait but my friend and I were easily able to find a table outside during peak hours on a Friday night. \\n\\nAs for the food, they have an extensive menu and I had no idea what to try, but ultimately settled on the sausage dishes. I got the bratwursts (pork only) and my friend got the bierwursts (pork and beef) and then we traded one (comes with 2 sausages). I think I preferred the bratwurst as it had a softer consistency and more spices, whereas the bierwurst was firmer and meatier, but both were good. Both came with a side of mashed potatoes (super yummy!) and sauerkraut, which cut the richness of the sausages nicely. They also have a sausage of the month option and I think May's is spicy sausage if you're interested. I was amazed at how fast the food came out (around 5 min) considering how packed the place was. \\n\\nWe both got the Hefe Weizen beer since I prefer lighter beers and it was very refreshing on a warm spring day.

The crunchiness of the batter and juice from the soft shell crab was mind blowing. Too bad it was just an appetizer and only had 2 soft shells , 2 brocolli, and 2 slice carrots. And a little too expensive for what it has. But Next time , I'll try the entree instead. My husband got the tum yum soup..

We seated ourselves, waited 5 minutes to be spoken to, then were told that no tea was available yet.  Nor were any of the three(!) salsas on the menu.  Instead, my friend got the cheese dip and I got the \\"free\\" salsa.  Or at least I thought I did -- 10 minutes later, after the chips had been sitting there for 5 minutes, I reminded her about the salsa, which she apologetically brought by.  My unsweet tea appeared soon thereafter - my friend's sweet tea never did.\\n\\nI then noticed that the three menu salsas graced most of the tacos I was considering, so those were out.  I decided on a couple that appeared to involve pre-prepared meats, and the order was taken without a problem.  Alas, the preparation must have begun upon my order, because we waited for another nearly 20 minutes for our four tacos, total, to arrive.  In the meantime, I chowed down on my garlicky free salsa, my friend on his \\"OK\\" cheese dip.\\n\\nAs for the late-arriving tacos, they were fine.  Nothing special -- especially the presentation, which had them wrapped in aluminum foil and sealed into the plate.  Unsurprising, then, that they tasted re-heated, or at least heated for the first time from a cold condition.  Flavor was good, but the texture was that nearly-steamed consistency one gets after a trip through a microwave.  And this after 20 minutes!\\n\\nAfter no drink refills and another 15 minutes of waiting to ask for the check, we got paid up and headed out.

By 5:00pm both the parking lot and dining room were full, you may even want to make a reservation.\\n\\nTo that end, the Continental exceeded all expectations, and I came away with many stories to share and delight my friends.\\n\\nThe Setting:  Like stepping back into a time machine, walking into this place evokes the 50's and 60's of fine dining.   I would have to say that nothing, NOTHING, has changed since then.   After walking into the huge double set of double doors, and past the parked wheel chairs and walkers, you enter a fascinating dining room dimly light by wall mounted candelabras, burgundy overstuffed leather booths, stained glass windows, and wood paneling.   It's like eating in the Haunted Mansion ride at Disney World (minus the cobwebs).   The patrons people watching is a major plus with the expected \\"set hair\\" and comb over set, but also some unexpected fashion icons/victims among the crowd.  The dress code  ranges from full suits to acid washed jeans with wife beaters and sweat shirts.\\n\\nThe Drinks:  They have a wine list with bottles they may have gone vintage at this time, and it ranges in price from a $18 bottle of something a bum would buy to the $150 Dom Perignon (for those retirement celebrations).  Also, I'd bet judging by the lounge/bar area they can make any cocktail as long as it hasn't been invented in the past 20 years.   I figured it apropos to order an Old Fashioned and boy was it ever (with a whiskey that had probably had time to ferment a few more cycles).\\n\\nThe Food:  You will not leave hungry, but the food is soulless and reminds you of something you would get off the buffet for 200 people at a cheesy wedding reception banquet hall.  Upon being seating, you begin a steady supply chain of appetizers (amuse bouche?) including spinach pie, chicken wings, corn fritters, pop overs, bean salad (which my mother-in-law exclaimed \\"I haven't seen those in a restaurant in 30 years), and all types of rolls and crackers.   That's all on top of the Early Bird Special including salad, entree, and dessert (and all of this for $12.95!).   The food is categorically New England fare with some nursing home specialities thrown in (London Broil, haddock, shrimp and scallops).  I was hoping for a little spice, so I rolled the dice and ordered the Haddock Creole which consisted of a large piece of baked haddock in a tomato broth with some okra on top.  The potatoes delmonico (in vogue in the 80's) were somewhat dry and disappointing.  In general, seasoning does not go beyond butter, pepper and salt.   And I can't forget the dessert selection with the Early Bird Special: sundae, grape nut pudding, apple crisp, or the cafeteria favorite: Jell-O with whipped topping (yes, really).  \\n\\nThe Service:  A huge service staff of tuxedo shirt clad with individually colored bow ties (1980's called and want their uniforms back) kept us confused on who our actual server was.    You constantly have a different person bringing something new to your table or clearing a plate, but they all look similar and all can take your order or bring you whatever you need.  At one point I thought I was looking at a statue, but finally it moved and turned out to be one of the staff.\\n\\nOverall, the viewing beats the chewing, but it's worth it for the experience.

I've had great cocktails and we always enjoy the fried calamari, and desserts are generally good if poorly described (we got \\"bread pudding\\" the other day that was more like a slice of bread with ice cream on top... delicious, but not bread pudding and there was no sauce). Also, the service is VERY slow. We've had a waitress forget about our table entirely - that was shortly after they opened, so we were willing to overlook it - but most of the waitstaff we've had has been very slow. We're hopeful that they'll work out the kinks, since the restaurant is still new, because it could be great. And the decor is fantastic! Will keep going and hope they hear the feedback and improve."},{"name":"BurgerFi","address":"3298 Margaritaville Blvd","city":"Kissimmee","stars":"4","text":"great food , great service , a tiny bit over priced but well worth it ! will be going back in the future"},{"name":"Hong Kong","address":"1238 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3","text":"This was my first New Years in Boston, so I was very excited to find the perfect place to celebrate with my friends!

It was after 10 PM at night and not very busy. We went to the bar to place the order - and that's when it got complicated.\\n\\nThe bartender/server was not the friendliest chap, not mean, just not particularly sociable. He explained about a \\"to go charge\\" of $2.50 per meal. But then followed with telling us the fee would be waived if we ordered one of their $4.50 strawberry margaritas on special. At this point the whole situation just seems shady, however I've had the strawberry margaritas before, and they are good, so we just went ahead with it.\\n\\n(What I should have done: asked for the manager, asked for another server, left, any of the above. But we're tired, it's late, and we're hungry.)\\n\\nNow I understand restaurants imposing a minimum order or a charge for deliveries, but for a to go order? Who does this? Is it because they're worried about not getting tipped? Because that is certainly not the right way to handle it. I've worked a restaurant - some people are sucky tippers - but more often than not, good effort & good service = good tips. At least that's the way it's supposed to work.\\n\\nBut then when we order, the guy changes his mind and says it was $2.00 per meal. He couldn't make up his mind. EVEN MORE SHADY. So did I ask him if he understood why I was concerned about this? - Heck yes. I think he did offer to get a manager, but at 11 PM after a long day, I just wanted my damn food and to go home - hence the whole idea of \\"TO GO.\\" So beyond frustrated.\\n\\nWe finally got our order and left, only to get home and find out there was no pico de gallo or sour cream included on the side for the quesadilla, and the Ciro's Special had more onions than anything else.

The food however is less to be desired.  Brisket was dry and not even flavorful.  Had to drench it in mild sauce.  Mashed potatoes was complete waste of a side.  Not even hot either, like luke warm.  Macaroni cheese was blah.  No taste at all.  Fries were ok.  The bread was good, but portions suck.  Comparison to Sonnys u get ONE piece with your dinner...... order a side you get 2.  Lol Sonnys you get 2 with meal sometimes three.  Side is three.  See the problem here.  Beans are good but portion size is so few beans as my wife said.  Her pulled pork was moist but tasteless.  No smoke flavor really, and she drowned it in sauce.  I tried it without the sauce.  I ordered so much bread cause I couldn't stand to eat the meat by itself it was lacking so much taste.  The lemons were more skin than lemon.  Rather annoying. \\n\\nThe good parts:  In order least to best.  Tea is great not overly sweet.  Corn on cob was on point.  Cinnamon apples a bit too much cinnamon but was good over all.  Server Kimmy was good.  \\n\\nSlightly embarrassing another server got snippy when server Kimmy offered her a table and she replied \\"for what another 2 or 3 dollar tip?\\" And she went there with menus and said something back to Kimmy.

It's made of fresh squeezed orange juice, carrots and ginger. Delicious! It makes you feel alive! When I don't, I take water. They have cold and hot water and a box of sliced lemons sitting on the table to add to your water. I usually take hot water with lemon, it's good for digestion. They also offer wine by the glass and a variety of tea. \\n\\nFood: My two favorite dishes are \\"the north-star burger\\" which a yummy veggie burger that comes with simple salad (best salad I've had in Columbus) or sweet potato fries -you can order it with or without bread and the \\"Buddha bowl\\" that consists on brown rice, cauliflower, broccoli, carrots, chicken or tofu and pina sauce. Mouthwatering! The pizzas and chicken sandwiches are also really good. \\n\\nService: Staff are very friendly! They're always smiling and having a good time with customers and they're very fast. I remember one time I was with a friend and one of our meals got 1 minute later than the other one and our waiter came back to us with 2 free meals to compensate that. Customer service is a ten.

The menu has changed recently and now labels all the possible allergens in each food, which is really nice for anyone on a limited diet. They did however change the menu so now all the items are just listed by name and price, and not numbered anymore. This was actually a really nice system because then if you have a big group you can just collect the numbers off the menu of what everyone wants so it's easier to order. The only reason I gave Tasca 4 stars is because I feel like the portion sizes are slightly smaller than they used to be, so make sure you order extra tapas if you're with a bigger crowd.

After that we never saw him again for waaaay longer than we should have. He ended up bring out appetizers WITH our main meal, which defeats the 'appetizer' part of a meal.

See, I wuz born in Chicago, and, he ran The Chicago Gang.  Also, we both like to sport fedoras.  Get the connection?  The Chicago Gang liked their Diner food, and, I bet you they found it at places like this.  A place where you can go into at 0600 hours and order a big ole cheese burger, fries, and, onion rings, and, not be stared at like you have just lost your mind.  Since 1973 Dan's has been dishing out some tasty classic American breakfasts, and, added some twists from our friends from over the southern boarder to create some good migas and huevos rancheros.  Breakfast ain't all they offer.  Of course you get your classic diner lunch and suppers which are gonna include ball busting burgers, hair tingling sandwiches, and, some face smacking steaks.  Talking chicken fried people.  Yep, chicken fried, chicken fried, chicken fried!!!  Bet you are wondering if they have shakes.  Yep!  They got malts, coffee, pop, and, tea as well.  I am addicted to the breakfast tacos and the 1/2 order of # 11.  That is one biscuit with sausage gravy.  They make some pretty fat biscuits here, so, the half order will satisfy most appetites.  Their salsa is tasty, but, unimpressive.  What I like to do, is add the salsa to my taco or 1/2 11, and, then dash on the Tabasco!  Oh man, this is an orgasm on the taste buds, and, is under five bucks!! You can't go wrong!  You can also request your food to be special cooked.  For instance, I like my bacon a certain way, and, I like to have them toast my tortilla on my taco.  One other awesome thing about this location is the low turn over in staff.  I have enjoyed the awesome service from Linda (register), Paula, Claudia, and, Errol for a long time.  That speaks merits about this company.

Here's my experience. \\n\\nService was excellent.  Both attendants running the floor during the lunch buffet made sure we had enough water and naan during our 8 top gathering of friends.  We stayed a little longer than most diners as this was our first group meeting for the new year. \\n\\nA nice surprise that a glass of champagne is included in the lunch buffet (or a glass of soda), but disappointed that my (requested) tea was not; I didn't want the champagne or soda. \\n\\nFood-  decent buffet spread of the more well known foods from Saag to Chicken tandoori to Tikka masala. Flavors were spot on, albeit on the lighter side spice wise. It may be a regional thing, I've had stronger tasting dishes in the past, i felt like it was a little \\"toned down\\".  Or maybe they cater more to the local palate? \\n\\nHere's what I really ate (not just tried): \\nSaag mushrooms-  by far the best dish on the buffet in my opinion. The seasonings weren't slap me in the face and I believe that worked to the mushroom's advantage.  I was able to taste the aroma of the mushrooms, their textures and the mixing of Flavors was spot on. Ate this with some Biryani (chicken), which I will go into detail later on\\n\\nChicken tikka masala/naan/white rice: good decent sized chunks of meat, looked like breast meat to me which is great (I've had dark meat with bone in tikkas before which was different).  The sauce was creamy as per tradition, Flavors on point but a little toned down and felt like the sauce was a little runny.  Was tough to use the naan to eat it, I spooned it with the naan and eventually ate it with some plain basmati rice which was not as moist or fluffy as one would want.  The rice was very dry even with a flood of tikka masala sauce and even tried to rehydrate it with some yogurt.  I would recommend the restaurant to place a lid on both rice dishes to prevent this otherwise wonderful dish from drying out. This by far hit me the hardest as rice has to be prepared right since it's a staple and can be eaten with anything on the buffet table. If your rice is sub-par, that carries on to all the other dishes you eat it with. \\n\\nChicken tandoori-  again, on the light side with seasonings. Good char, decent portions. Meat a little past prime doneness, maybe covering this will help to retain moisture so it stays succulent? A few pieces started getting real stringy, especially the white meat portions. \\n\\nGoat stew (?) - decent spice flavors. Not too strong, almost just right, almost. The goat is goatier than most goats I've had, and I always order goat whenever and wherever I can. Some pieces were quite chewy and stringy, I assume that another hour on the pot, maybe 20 minutes more on the pressure cooker would have otherwise made this a perfect dish for me. Otherwise, good dish overall. Good balance with sweetness and saltiness. Ate this with the basmati rice, so I needed extra extra extra sauce to make up for the dryness of the rice. \\n\\nChicken Biryani-  dry. I really hope they change the way they either serve it, prepare it, display it, etc on the buffet.  I normally enjoy eating Biryani by itself but I wanted to chug my glass of water after every other bite. I resorted to creating a symphony of biryani-saag, biryani-tikka masala, biryani-water to enjoy it. \\n\\nA recommendation to the owners (which may or may not be feasible):  separate the vegetarian dishes from the meat dishes. I noticed some diners using the same spoon to scoop up some meat dishes and then use the same utensil to scoop up some dahl or pakora because it was more convenient. Maybe move the vegetarian dishes into another buffet table altogether if you have another one?  Also, the condiments, the tamarind and chutneys-  would make more sense to be on the table rather than at the buffet area. Lots of cross contamination there since diners have to spoon them onto their plates and they're a bit runny. At one point during lunch, the yogurt looked like the tamarind sneezed on it. \\n\\nOh, and please find a new home for the Gulab Jamun. Its neighbors included tandoori chicken and saag. They eventually tasted like them towards the end from other diners not being careful. Also, I saw some first time diners spoon the small round beautiful balls of pleasure onto their sauces and rice thinking they were savory meatballs or something. Watching their faces cringe after they bit into it with a mouthful of rice and masala sauce was priceless."},{"name":"Ah Sing Den","address":"1100 E 6th St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Such a fun eclectic space featuring Victorian style furnishing, lighting and decor that harken back to the appearance of an opium den.

This place is pretty tiny, but it was pretty empty at dinner considering Tuesdays and Wednesdays are $.65 wings. This place serves alcohol, but it doesn't have a bar, so don't expect to post up at one.\\n\\nThe way this place works is you order the number of wings you want, then the flavor, and then you decide how hot you want each flavor. It's pretty much identical to Wings and Rings in that aspect, and they're actually served in the same wooden bowls (I don't know who came first). I went with the Hot Garlic, the Hot Jamaican Jerk, and the ABG Buffalo. ABG is their hottest sauce, and we could only imagine what that acronym stands for but managed to come up with plenty of inappropriate ones.\\n\\nThe food comes out quickly, and man, were these same great wings. Not only were the flavors straight up tasty, but the wings were cooked perfectly with a nice crunchy skin and juicy chicken inside. They weren't too small or too big either. I could tell the ABG were hot based on me sneezing a few times before I even dug into them, but I was actually surprised that the heat was not nearly as bad as I was expecting. If you like hot wings, don't be afraid to go past the X-Hot to ABG, and it actually has a really good taste to it. The Jamaican Jerk was great, and I tried my friend's Hot Cajun, and they were just as good.\\n\\nYou should have one mission if you're coming here, and that's wings. They have other stuff on the menu, and we did try the artisanal mushroom bites as well as the waffle and curly fries, but the wings are what stands out. Everything is pretty cheap too compared to other wing spots around town. Everyone loved their wings, so we'll definitely be back this way again.\\n\\nP.S.

I don't even write yelp reviews, but this was something else. Only reason I gave it two stars was because the rice wasn't terrible and I'm just a sucker for hard-working immigrants. I've worked in the restaurant industry and have frequently visited Szechuan restaurants in the Boston area. I've had great experiences at places like Sichuan Gourmet in Brookline and 5 spices in Cambridge/Malden. That being said, I know my shit. Let me break this down for you. \\n\\nFood: 4/10. Not the greatest portion sizes. Dry spicy chicken barely had any chicken--mainly a dish full of dry peppers. Only reason it was edible was because I asked for chili oil (which didn't even have the hint of spice needed, but we'll take it) and duck sauce to drown it in. Overall, I felt that the pricing was a bit exaggerated (but not highly unreasonable) for MOST of the menu items. \\n\\nService: 1/10. If a first-timer walks into your spot, they shouldn't be wondering--or asking the bar staff--if there's any food.....someone should be at the front greeting and seating. I don't care what hole-in-the-wall you've visited--every traditional and contemporary spot, whether it's no-frills or fine dining, makes it clear that they're an open restaurant. We walked in around 3pm on a Saturday. No one was in sight. After standing around for a good minute or more wondering what the fuck we just walked into, we asked someone in the bar if there was any food. They led us to a small room where we sat and waited for our server. When we received our food, nobody checked to make sure it was right (it wasn't). In addition, a guest should not have to walk over to the next room to ask the bar staff if they can have the server bring them something. Also, the server charged us $1 extra for ordering rice with two different meats, which we agreed to, but then it didn't even come as we ordered. We didn't bother saying anything because we were already confused/frustrated and just wanted to fill our bellies and get out. They didn't even check if we wanted more drinks. It was underwhelming and off-putting to say the LEAST. \\n\\nAmbience: 2/10. If it weren't for the bar in the next room, this place would feel 100% creepy and just off. We were the only ones in the whole place. No one came to check on us. Too quiet. People even walked in, sat at one of the only other tables in the room, and decided it was best to leave--something we contemplated doing the moment we stepped in; however, we tried to give it an unbiased shot and failed miserably. \\n\\nNobody on staff said goodbye or thank you, and we walked out quietly. My partner and I barely spoke a word to one another during our meal and on our way to the car. Honestly, I hope the restaurant reads these reviews because let me tell you, I really wanted to like this place. We tried really hard, but unfortunately, no one else did.

Our food. \\n\\nI understand it's difficult when the table comes rolling in. But when the last person arrives, gets his food, AND finishes it before four others who had ordered no more than 15 minutes before him there's an issue. This issue gets even worse when:\\n\\n1. After waiting an hour and notifying the waitress, only 2 of the 4 get their food (which was wrong by the way).\\n2.

Maybe have a large well-trained staff? Maybe that large well trained staff can split the tables into more manageable sections? Maybe corporate needs to come down here and watch the B-dubs name get tarnished right before their very eyes. But can you even sue yourself for defamation? Probably not.

A great value for sure, but if it's anything like the Midtown or Windy Hill locations' buffets, the quality of the sushi is average at best.  I say that because I've only been to Ru San's Buckhead for dinner.  I ordered their Protein Builder which, while it cost over $20, was packed with over 20 different pieces of maki (rolls), nigiri, and a hand roll.  The dish also included cooked teriyaki chicken.  It takes a lot of sushi to fill me up and this plate of sushi was certainly filling, though none of the pieces were terribly delicious.

I've read a lot of reviews complaining that the meat is salty, but that's the Brazilian way of doing it -- complaining about the salt would be like going to a Mexican place and complaining about the spicy food. So you've been warned. If you are Brazilian, you're gonna love it: it tastes just like home. Obviously they weren't able to reproduce every single one of the rubs and recipes from Brazil with the ingredients they have available in Vancouver, but it's pretty close to the real deal. Besides the meat, they have a great buffet with salad, bread, feijoada, rice, shrimp, and some other things (during dinner on a Saturday -- they have less options during lunch and weekdays). It's a great value for an all you can eat buffet plus the unlimited meat. The only thing that is not unlimited is the p√£o de queijo (cheese bread), which is the house's best recipe. That's the only reason I'm not giving them 5 stars. Why isn't the p√£o de queijo included in the rodizio? Doesn't make sense to me.

This cake is layers of meringue and rum/almond buttercream and was, according to my wife, even better than the dobos torte.

Nice atmosphere and friendly staff.  No loud music or overwhelming sports TVs.  Food items for our party of two were half a chicken, small order of jo-jos, side of rice and side of coleslaw.  Two beers, they serve Kolsh which we both like.  The jo-jos were very nice, not greasy at all, light and flavorful but don't order a small, its not enough.  Both the other sides were very good, the rice was not warm but I am not sure it was suppose to be.  The chicken was not what I would have expected as a fried chicken, looked more like a baked chicken.  The coating was tasty and crispy.  The chicken was small, I noticed right off that the leg was only 4 inches long.  The wing was so small they did not cut it off as a separate piece.  Not juicy but it was tender, reminded me of a slightly moist turkey, the kind where you wonder what you did wrong.

This time I felt like switching things up a bit so I ordered the Sweet Potato and Turkey Hash ($13), which really hit the spot. The fact that I found this dish to be so delicious speaks volumes to how this restaurant creates such amazing dishes because I normally do not like sweet potato (yes, that includes sweet potato fries). I also always enjoy drinking their single origin coffees...I can't remember the name of one I've had that had hints of raspberry, but it was one of the best coffees I've ever had! Try all of them since they offer free refills!\\n\\nPrices are a little steep but I guarantee the dishes are well worth it. You're paying for good quality, locally-grown, organic artisan food.

Emmer & Rye gets our award for the worst restaurant in Austin. The food can best be described as \\"Red Neck Road Kill\\", with entree prices for micro small plates. \\n\\nWe had the Mackrel, which was ruined by the raw finely chopped parsley, all over the top of the top of the fish. Who does this, raw parsley is bitter and who wants to taste that. \\n\\nNext came the the beef tartare which was totally slathered and covered in some green mess that either resembled pistachio ice cream or vomit, well the look of it almost made us vomit. When we asked the server where's the beef, he explained this presentation was to introduce those who wanted to try beef tartare but could not bare to look at the diced beef. \\n\\nWe also had the rigatoni, not house made, but dried, accompanied with  a sauce, that was so nasty deep in dark and flavor making it very unpleasant to attempt to eat. I guess gratefully in this case you get only about eight pieces of pasta total for your twenty something bucks.\\n\\nThen there is the so called \\"Dim Sum\\" cart. Talk about cultural misappropriation. There is nothing Asian, or even at least Asian Fusion about Emmer & Rye. \\n\\nThe service comes along with a good dose of some snotty Austin attitude. We sat at a table facing the server station and witnessed a male server standing there flirting with another female server, while holding his old school butane lighter flicking it up and open, lighting it like some Jesse James character out of an old western movies, doing this over and over and over for a good 10 minutes or more.  \\n\\nWe heard Austin was having a tech explosion, so maybe the lighter was some new Tinder app coded into a lighter or some other more high tech version of how to get the girl. Hey maybe they just didn't have anything better to do, like take care of a house full of diners. \\n\\nEmmer and Rye just simply fails on all points that matter."},{"name":"Shabu & Mein","address":"148 1st St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Gluten free rating of 3 stars for the limited options of broth for the soups.

All the employees were quite friendly and and service was unbelievably fast!

After examining the menu, I settled on a pulled pork tray with the broccoli cheese casserole and the coleslaw for my sides. I also got a single biscuit on the side. \\n\\nThe whole tray was great and I even loved the coleslaw which I'm not usually a fan of. They have several sauces on the side; I went with the classic BBQ and enjoyed it a lot. My favorite items were definitely the cheese casserole (so warm and cheesy with crunchy cracker bits!) and the biscuit, which came with an incredible honey butter.\\n\\nI thought the portion sizes were more than adequate! I had plenty leftover, which my server kindly boxed up for me with an extra side of the sauce. It was enough to eat for lunch the next day, so it really ended up being two meals for me.\\n\\nThat being said, as a native New Englander I don't have much exposure to authentic BBQ so I'm not sure how it stacks up on that level.

I loved watching them make the crepes right in front of me, and the ladies seemed happy and very keen to please their customers. I asked for mine without cheese, and the lady making my crepe offered more tomatoes in replacement of the cheese. I was VERY pleased at this, since this is a rarity anywhere in Vancouver. It seems most places are skimpy when it comes to special requests such as this. Not La Boheme! Your crepe will be served cheerfully just as you asked.\\n\\nTHE FOOD, as I stated above, was cold by the time I got to it (no surprise, I had to trek about a half hour before I could eat it).

But, I really do not care about that right now.\\n\\nI am seriously frustrated with the customer service that I am receiving from this place, especially from the guy behind the counter who is probably the owner himself. My roommate friend called in to order $20 or less of roasted pork, but the person speaking on the phone kept insisting that the total will be a \\"little\\" over $20. Well, let me tell you something, they always do this. You would want only $20 or less of something, but if you don't tell them that you ONLY want max $20 or less, they will add more and then your total would be about $7 dollars more. It is frustrating when they only take cash, and you have exactly what you wanted, but then get turned away because you don't have $27 in cash for them.\\n\\nThat is not it; because this happened so much to my roommates and I, one of my roommates called in and order the same thing for a small dinner and a whole duck, and again they told my her it will cost more than what she actually wants. It took my friend 7 patience minutes to get the message across to the person on the phone that she only wants what she needed. And then, when I went to Lucky Cafe to pick up the order for my roommate and paid, the guy who is always there behind the counter roughly threw the bagged order on the counter, and he had an ugly attitude on his face too. I felt insulted and so I talked to my roommates about it, and their parents who came for dinner said that they have also experienced similar situations.\\n\\nAnother thing is that I am half Chinese so I can understand Chinese too. I don't speak it much because I am not fluent when speaking, but I can understand conversations. I have heard this guy say a lot of things to workers when they are chopping up orders, but I'll leave it for someone else who might also know what I am talking about, and let them review about it.\\n\\nI am going to restrain myself from coming here to buy anything unless someone important like my grandma or someone who is coming abruptly then I will order from here."},{"name":"Rogue Eastside Pub & Pilot Brewery","address":"928 SE 9th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"My group of friends and I were across the street and decided to stop by Rogue Brewery on a whim.

I psyched myself into eating it before we got there so we purchased it.  You can choose between hot Buffalo, mild Buffalo, honey BBQ and garlic parmesan.

This was the cleanest mojito I've ever had.  Clean, meaning not a lot of sugar and not sweet at all.  This was a very good mojito, for my taste at least.  I could have easily downed multiples of this. $10\\n\\nRoaring Twenties malbec.  I liked this too.  It's a local winery that produces this at the Urban Winery in Railtown. $10 for 9 oz\\n\\nMac and cheese:  made with white cheeses and bechamel as the base.  I should have asked what cheeses they used, but it was quite tasty.\\n\\nSliders.  Beef, bacon, BBQ sauce and horse radish.  Served with a jalapeno pepper and a pickle, with a side of house made slaw.  Very good.  I somehow got 4 instead of the three that was listed on the menu.\\n\\nChicken and rib combo.  Fall off the bone ribs in a bbq sauce, with a garlic rosemary roasted chicken leg and thigh.  If there was any weakness in this plate, I'd say it was the chicken - slightly under seasoned.  The ribs were, indeed, fall off the bone.  It needed smoke to be superb, but that's me being a stuck up smoking snob.  The ribs are very good.  Comes with a huge side salad and blob of mashed potatoes.

In my opinion Orlando does not have that many chic/well put together restaurants but Wine Bar George exceeds expectations. The food is phenomenal.. I would absolutely recommend the skirt steak for 1-3 people if you want an awesome entree to share especially if you order one or two appetizers (get the macaroni & cheese bites with honey for dipping. You won't regret it I promise!) They also have a wonderful selection of wine including Red Zinfandel which is my favorite. Let's not forge that the actual restaurant its self is beautiful!

Now before I begin on the dinner experience,\\n\\nWe arrived early for our reservations and waited at the bar with wonderful cocktails and service from the bartenders. Truly the best part of our experience. You guys get 5 stars!!\\n\\nUpon being told our table was ready we felt the atmosphere change. Our hostess was not happy when we asked to add an additional seat for a guest who we had not made a reservation for (from 8 to 9). Now I totally understand this, but if we were ok being cramped then it shouldn't bother you. Next came our waiter. I won't call him out but I should because he was the most pretentious waiter I have EVER experienced. You are in Austin!! Where do you think we are? Paris? New York? Anyway, I asked a simple question, what would you recommend? He looked at me like I had two heads. Yes I have been to hundreds of tapas/small plate restaurants. Yes I know the ordeal, 2-3 plates per person. Ok fine. Now what should I order, what is good? Couldn't even answer me and just passed right over it. We had a pregnant friend at the table who he kept asking/badgering about cocktails. To the point where she almost just ordered one. After ordering, we enjoyed conversation and may have been a little louder, but it was 9 people in a fairly loud restaurant. No one looked annoyed around us but our waiter. At one point, my husband was telling a story and pulled his chair back to show the table he had his boots on in hopes to take our out of towners to the Broken Spoke. Everyone laughed and continued on with our dinner. Again, no one annoyed but our waiter. Who let me just say we were absolutely nothing but nice to. Always offering a thank you or gracious time getting our food/drinks to us. The dim sum waiters loved our table. One stayed and enjoyed conversation for about 10 minutes. \\n\\nNow comes the real bad, he was so \\"annoyed\\" with us he could not be bothered to offer dessert/coffee until we practically had to beg him to. Then again after he was no where to be found. Now I'm a medical professional and I worked in the restaurant business in college. If there was a table I couldn't handle, I would pass it off or try to get them out of there as soon as possible, right?\\n\\nNext came the check. WE HAD TO SEPARATE IT. He couldn't be bothered to simply put it into couples tickets. Ok not the biggest ordeal but a 600 check takes a while to go through. So while me and my friend divided the check, my husband and a friend went to grab a drink at the bar and talk. Our waiter saw this and went to the manager telling the manager we were \\"over served\\" and needed to leave immediately. Um excuse me?! I had 2 glasses of wine. My husband 3 beers. And the rest of the table 1-2 cocktails each. We had been there from 645 and it is now 930. This was the first we had heard/seen that that is what his issues were. We are all professionals in our 30s, not college kids. To not cause a scene, I went to my husband and said they think we are over served and need to leave so let's just get in our Fare ride and take our out of town guest down the road to where Austin is still Austin. Not one person in my party was impressed with food or service. I've had several friends eat here and they have said the same. \\n\\nMoral of the story, the only good thing about this place was the friendly bartenders before. They took the time to make a glass of water for our pregnant friend look very fancy. WILL NEVER RETURN HERE. Do not bring someone who is not from Austin here if you are expecting Austin hospitality and experience."},{"name":"AFURI ramen + dumpling","address":"50 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"This place was fun to go to!

I ordered a beer while I was waiting and was surprised when she brought the meal out after only a few minutes. Since I didn't have a chance to finish my beer, I opened up the container and took a bite. Low and behold, the first thing I tasted was ginger, then chicken. Turned out, I had been given the Asian Chicken Wrap, with a GINGER dressing. I called her over and told her I thought I had been given the wrong meal and that I believed it had ginger. She didn't really seem to concerned and said, \\" Sorry Hun, let me change that for you.\\" Now, I had told her about my allergy but she didn't know if it was a severe allergy or if I would go into shock  or what! I asked for water, which she didn't bring to me, and she brought out the right meal a few minutes later. There was no adjustment made to the bill, no manager checking to see if I was ok, no nothing.

At first I though it was just a comercial passing but the whole time we were there we had to look at prostrate medicine and diagrams . That is just shameful. My steak was mostly fat and I understand that ribeye has fat but I barely touched it, my husbands got the 20 oz one and it was very burned on the outside he ate around it but left a lot as wells mash potatoes that came with it was warm at best.

Well here's a tip, Dante's: if your bartenders are going to be so put off by a request for water (which should actually be encouraged, judging by the number of drunk yahoos I had to wade through on my way back to the car later), why don't you follow the lead of most bars in town and put out self-serve water?

Yall are right, they barely put anything when you ask for everything on it. I might have enjoyed it all more if i got more cilantro, onions and what not. Also, the tortillas do get very soggy quickly, its from being immediately wrapped up in aluminum as soon as they make them. Traps all the steam inside and turns the tortillas very very soft, a bad soft. \\n\\nThe tongue by itself was excellent, very tender and perfectly cooked, but the barely anything else with bland tortillas made the overall taco very sub-par. \\nThe chili relleno taco, wow that was just absolutely terrible. No flavor at all, I was dousing it in the salsa verde to give it some flavor. I even had a good bite of cheese left when I was done eating it, the CHEESE was bland too. How does cheese get bland? I'm baffled at that one. \\nThe pastor pork taco, however, WAS really delicious, a little squeeze of lime and it was good to go.

The main courses we chose were the luscious steak and a rocket-prosciutto pizza. When the items arrived they were plated well, but seemed to be slightly discoloured. Specially the steak. The steak was accompanied by seasonal veggies (seemed Mediterranean in spice) and neither the side or steak were hot. This may be excused (of course!) however, we were the ONLY seated customers. This was around 1 pm during the week days. Previously when we entered we kindly asked to ensure that the restaurant was even open as there were two members of staff (the manager and one server) enjoying their meals at the front of house. Nevertheless, we sat and the steak as for mentioned (for its whopping price of $20+ ), was poorly seasoned, cold and could barely pass for \\"medium rare\\" as requested. The second issue, the pizza. This was the most preposterous (steak can always be a guessing game or risk). The pizza came, once again, cold and plated with yellowed arugula. Regardless we both tried the plates and the pizza tasted as though the dough had been frozen or that the entire pizza (with glue/plastic-like cheese) was frozen. To top it off again, the arugula was yellowed - the prosciutto was positive. \\n\\nFinally, this was my company's BIRTHDAY lunch. While we tried this new restaurant, it was a complete bust. Choosing our battles wisely (and with full, uneaten plates), we hailed our lovely Irish waitress (a brilliant girl who did her absolute best!) came over and listened to our concerns without hesitation. She was very responsive and kindly directed us to the manager, which was the most dreadful part. I am taking time with this review for this purpose, to hold this \\"manager\\", Mark, accountable in his place of work where he represents this company and unfortunately, disgraced it entirely. After being directed to Mark, we told him our concerns and he aggressively and extremely rudely, asked \\"what specifically is wrong\\" with our items. He noted that he \\"hadn't had a complaint all day\\" - I do believe we were the only customers that day (so far). We kindly (and very calmly, in our inside voices) explained our concerns. Instead of responding with understanding or comfort, Mark was offended that 'somehow' someone would not enjoy the kitchen's creations. I do understand, it is hard to take criticism, but it is important for the development of both kitchens and work environments. As he took our plates, in a rush, even spilling my cutlery into my lap, he made one final comment to my company. As we politely mentioned the visual discolouration of the arugula (we called it lettuce), Mark aggressively responded \\"that's arugula.\\" \\n\\nHe then stomped off to the kitchen and in front of ALL staff and myself with my company, he declared \\"They don't like the steak, they don't like the pizza. They say it tastes frozen.\\" Then continued to ask \\"is the Doug frozen... when was the dough made?!\\" Belittling not only his customers but his staff. He continued this and then instead of returning to table, I watched him walk through the kitchen without a look back - no remorse, no acknowledgment of his unnecessary aggression to us or his staff and a complete disregard for his management of both the restaurant and his service. \\n\\nOur server returned, extremely red and shocked (as were we), apologized and let us know our meals would be removed. It was then that I let her know we were celebrating my birthday. What a day! \\n\\nWe tipped well for our Brussels sprouts and thanked our server profusely, she was a lovely girl and helped as much as she could. After asking for the contact information of the owner, we were told that Mark was the primary contact. What a shame. \\n\\nThis was again a few months ago, and has stained my memory - so much, that I had no notes on this experience but I remember every second. \\n\\nI am extremely disappointed in Enigma's management (not even the food), but Mark if you do see this, I hope that it may teach you a lesson. Kindness is key. \\n\\nI will not visit Enigma again nor recommend it. Thank you, Yelp for letting me hold such an establishment accountable for a truly unforgettable nightmare."},{"name":"Burger King","address":"1001 Willa Springs Dr","city":"Winter Springs","stars":"2","text":"When I came, I ordered 5 items suck as 3 Fries (medium), and 2 Cheese Burgers.

But, the cocktails at Emmer and Rye were just right ;) I am not a cocktail connoisseur, but it was one of the best that I've tried. \\n\\nFinally, our server, Hillary, was very knowledgeable about the food and wine being served. She was so passionate that I believe the flavors in the food stood out. The farm-to-table concept is not new, but all the dishes were well-thought out. None of the dishes were just thrown on a plate. The dim sum servers were also friendly and explained all the dishes offered clearly. \\n\\nHonestly, I would recommend Emmer & Rye for the dining experience.

These machines seem like they're more for people who like genuine premium coffee over a pod that's got that weird signature Keurig K-cup taste.  The way the pods are made and the way the machine operates is very interesting and well thought-out/designed.  The only downside to this particular store (and the online one as well) is that they're not very price competitive -- so many people sell these and if you do your homework you can save a lot of money by shopping around online.  They do throw in free things to offset this difference but you have to weigh that against how much you're saving online.  Online a machine they were selling for $599 was less than $200 just to give you an idea.  You'd have to throw in quite a bit of free stuff to make up that difference which on this particular machine, it only included two sleeves of pods for free."},{"name":"Old Hickory Steakhouse","address":"6000 W Osceola Pkwy","city":"Kissimmee","stars":"3.5","text":"My family and I were visiting the Gaylord Palms for a conference I was attending; and, since my wife and I enjoy Old Hickory Steakhouse, we decided to have wine and cheese in the bar.  That's what we did the first time we dined here, although the cheese cart was a bit awkward inside the space.\\n\\nWe started with a Barrel Aged Negroni, which is among the best cocktails in Central Florida for me.  This version is made with Pomerol, which is very tasty.  My wife had the Dark and Spicy, a rum concoction with Chinese five-spice and ginger beer.  \\n\\nFollowing up, we chose a couple of appetizers to share; the Braised Pork Belly, which was crispy, unctuous; and, simply delicious and a Prawn Cocktail, which reminded us of a similar order we had decades ago at another local steakhouse; they were huge, firm, fresh, sweet and tasty.\\n\\nFor our main, we decided on three kinds of cheese; the cart is \\"parked\\" just outside the bar area; and, were accompanied by sweet accouterments, like honey, dates, and guava paste.  Each was, in turn, succulent, savory, and creamy.  I had the Alphabets Pinot Noir while my wife had the Indian Wells Merlot.\\n\\nFor dessert, my wife had a trio of Creme Brulee, with Chocolate, Vanilla, and Pistachio flavors; I had a \\"liquid dessert\\" of a short-pour of Lagavulin Scotch...

We asked 2 different people if we could be seated for a table of 2. A gentleman grabbed us menu and proceeded to seat us. We then sat there for over 10 minutes before a server came to welcome us and get a drink order. (The chip lady even served us before our server). The server apologized and told us there was a miscommunication with the seating chart, but he'd be happy to serve us. (clearly - because no one else was wanting to help). We thanked him, because by then we became starving. We also noticed that the menu would list \\"almost duplicated\\" menu items, but with different names and for a slightly different price.

Takoyaki: though the menu was limited, I was able to find a few things that I wanted to try. One was their takoyaki. I've tried various kinds in the past. I've tried takoyaki in Japan, Canada, and also different restaurants here, in the Portland area. This takoyaki was one of the better ones. It was freshly made and the outside had a thin layer of crisp and crunchiness and the inside was nice and smooth. Takoyaki can get mushy or sticky but I found the texture to be very nice. There was sauce on top but it didn't overpower or make the takoyaki extremely salty. $6 for 6 pieces. \\n\\n2. Fuddo Ramen ($10): I've tried lots of ramen too in general because I LOVE RAMEN!!! There were only 4 options to choose from. I was a tad sad because of the limited types of ramen but if they can master those 4 and it's good, then I'm cool with it. We also got their egg with it (yay, free topping from Yelp!) Soup base: AMAZING. Loved it! Very strong but it didn't leave an oily feeling and it wasn't salty. The noodles were a little thicker than the ones I've had in the past and I liked how bouncy it was. I believe they didn't cook the noodles ahead of time otherwise it would be really mushy and bleh. The char siu had a little bit of fat but it was very tender and since you're eating out...a little fat won't hurt ya. The egg was not as runny as the other ones I've had in the past but it had it's own flavor and I really enjoyed it. The yolk wasn't fully cooked so it was very soft and nice. \\n\\nWhy not 5 points?

Both the creamy green and the chunky red salsas are excellent. The onwer is a super nice guy and makes sure that you're treated with care.

My son's chicken dish with pasta was like macaroni soup with chicken thrown in. Again, little flavor and poorly prepared. The other two meals were mediocre. When the server was clearing the table, she asked my wife if she needed a box given most of the meal was still in the bowl. My wife explained again the toughness of the veal.

The broccoli side was larger than I thought it would be and was quite tasty. Charred but not burnt to a crisp and there was a nice kick of spice as well. Unfortunately, the sandwich was underwhelming, if not fairly bland. This was pretty much a bahn mi sandwich with a slab of pork belly. I didn't taste any spice so all I really got was the pickled veggies. The bread was good though. Maybe I came at an off time or something just got an under marinated piece.

The outside received a new paint job and got new signage, but the inside has been beautifully redone. The bar has a pretty cool mural painted on the wall with vibrant colors. Of course there are the obligatory super large TV screens with a large projector screen at the front of the restaurant. The main dining room is very open and spacious with plenty of regular tables and seating at the bar.\\n\\nIf you know ahead of time that you want Korean BBQ or Hot Pot, let the host station know and they will seat you in the section that has booths with tables that have built in burners and a table grill. Even if you decide after sitting at a regular table, they will gladly move you.\\n\\nWe started out with the Tuna Tataki that featured thinly sliced seared tuna served with ponzu sauce. The tuna was really good and delicately sliced with a very light sear.\\n\\nJust to sample the quality of the sushi rolls at Danketsu, we ordered the Combo Set D. They have a decent selection of sushi, nigiri and sashimi on the menu with some pre selected roll options in the combo sets. The combo set D features a California roll, spicy tuna roll and a spicy salmon roll. The rice was nice and sticky and did not fall apart after dipping in soy, and the fish was fresh with a nice kick to it.\\n\\nThe Yakisoba noodles were the only disappointment of our evening. The noodles themselves were cooked well and had great consistency, but really lacked any flavor or toppings. For $13.00 I expected more chicken and vegetables.\\n\\nThe Miso Ramen was a very large portion and tasted exceptional. I would advise Danketsu to put more descriptions in the menu. Quite a few items lack any information that tells the guest exactly what they are getting. The miso ramen is simply listed as noodles in miso base, and that sounds rather plain especially when you look at the picture of the dish we got. Our server was also unsure of what the ramen came with.\\n\\nOverall, we really liked Danketsu and since we live on the east side, we will certainly return. The prices are very reasonable and the portions are large.

I ordered the mac and vegan cheese but it was horrid.  The gluten-free noodles crumbled like a dry cracker in my mouth.  I am G.F. so I know that this is the sign of over cooked noodles. I didn't eat it, nor did I return it. I just walked out very disappointed. This last visit, the problem was with the flavor but more importantly, the bad attitude and shaming.

Again, the 2\\"penne noodle underwent a metamorphosis into100 crumbles inside my mouth~coupled with (an opps I tripped with spice) too spicy tomato sauce.  You should know, that I go out of my way to order spicy Thai, Indian and Mexican food. Spicy is always good, but this dish Thursday night was ridiculously heavy handed with fire.  I took one bite and could not take another.  Then, I tried the lentil balls this was a timely process, as  I couldn't get one to stay on the fork without it crumbling to dust!

Here's where it gets better...my friend told me that I should never have to pay for something that I cannot eat, so I walked up to the smoothie area and politely asked to talk to someone in charge and the girl asked what I needed. I told her that my dish was too spicy and asked if I could swap it out for something that's not so spicy.  She looked down at me and condescendingly stated \\"uh, we don't SWAP\\"! She further inquired, \\"What's your problem\\"?!  I told her that it was too spicy (even though I already told her that in the beginning).  She said \\"we don't take food back\\"! I was a little embarrassed by her raised voice over the bar and I told her that I cannot eat it because it was so spicy. She rolled her eyes and spun on her heels and with her back to me she sarcastically suggested \\"why don't you go look at what you \\"can\\" handle and get back to me.  She was so RUDE! I asked her if she'd like me to bring the dish back to the bar or if there is a bus tray to leave it in and she snapped at me with the most patronizing tone \\"Don't bring it back HERE!  IT'S NOT LIKE WE CAN SERVE IT AGAIN, YOU TOUCHED IT\\"! She was totally trying to publicly humiliate me inside her restaurant.

To me, Friday is always good albeit it is before Easter or not. A group of friends and I decided to meet at Canton Cook II since CC II is located in between Cobb and Gwinnett counties. Much to my delight, this is the sister restaurant of the original Canton Cook that I am familiar with on Roswell Road. \\n\\nOur group was prompt getting there as soon as the doors were opened for business. The eight of us were escorted by the waitress all the way back to the spacious dining room. There was one friend who was caught in traffic but the waitress still allowed us to get started with our drink orders. She joined us not too long afterwards. The menu offerings were quite extensive and had a variety of choices to have me cross-eyed for a moment. Another friend and I decided to make the executive decision of ordering for our group as they serve family style dishes here. We by passed the Americanized Chinese lunch section of the menu and ordered from the dinner section that served more authentic Chinese dishes. We had the following dishes as follows:\\n\\n*  Chicken hot pot with ginger and green onions. \\nThis dish had the most tender chicken slices combined with tasty dark Shitake mushrooms and green onions served in a hot pot. It typically comes in a clay pot that was slow cooked for a long time but here, it surprisingly came in a metallic pot. Nonetheless, it tasted spot on.\\n\\n*  Spicy & salted fried pork chops.\\nThese fried pork chops were delicious. It came with slices of jalapeno to kick it up a level. Definitely for the brave souls who does not mind a hint of added spicy flavor.\\n\\n*  Bacon with veggies.\\nThese bacons were huge and came with some mustard greens and dark seasoning sauce. It has a unique taste. Some of our American friends were really enjoying this dish that you do not normally find in other Chinese restaurants. Besides, bacon do make everything taste better, even with veggies. Your mom would be proud if you ate this too.\\n\\n*  Dry beef chow fun.\\nSlices of savory beef was stir fried with bean sprouts and wide rice noodles. The smoky flavor was just so good in this dish. A little taste of heaven on earth!\\n\\n*  Snow pea leaves.\\nThe vegetable greens are cooked with minced garlic and I am always fond of this simple dish. A very comforting dish indeed.\\n\\n* Seafood chow mein.\\nFine egg noodles are cooked with various kind of seafood like shrimps, squids and scallops mixed with some baby bok choy. At the bottom of the fine noodles, there was a seafood gravy that helps soften the crispy noodles over time. When you see this dish, it is hard to wait for the noodles to soften a bit. It called my name loudly and I couldn't wait too much longer to enjoy it. So delicious!\\n\\nAll of these dishes came with steamed rice and complimentary Chinese hot tea. CCII serve so many different kind of Cantonese dishes especially in the seafood section. Our waitress came by to check on us several times and made sure our water glasses were never empty. She also refilled our hot teapot. We enjoyed our lunch tremendously, our food was delicious, the service was good and the company of friends with laughter at the large table made it a great day!\\n\\nNext time, I will come back to try their lobster and fish. The food here is decent and affordable for its value. Besides, they stay open late and you can be sure you will go home smiling from ear to ear with a happy belly.

You used to hand out those \\"10 orders and you're 11th is free!\\" type dealy cards. I used up a couple of those. Things were hot, tasty, decently proportioned and handy for takeout, always ready in about 15-40 minutes after I called. But then... the same time you stopped giving out the deal cards, something happened and things went downhill, at least at this location. The food just didn't taste as good.

Sushi in the Crest Shopping Centre in Burnaby so I thought it was about time to repay them a visit.\\n\\nThe menu offering here is decidedly old school with a mix of classic items that you'd expect to find such as sushi rolls, donburi, and sashimi - it was this last item that drew me here as I had a hankering for some sashimi.\\n\\nThe Assorted Sashimi ($19.55) is the chef's choice and is described in the menu as coming with 12 pieces (but I counted more than that on my plate): 1 piece of tamago (cut in two), 2 pieces of hokkigai (surf clam), 3 pieces of tako (octopus) that were a bit squishy but okay, 4 pieces of Atlanic salmon, 1 piece of wild salmon, 3 pieces of shime saba (marinated mackerel), 3 pieces of tai (red snapper), and 3 pieces of tuna.\\n\\nOverall, my favourite was the salmon which had a smooth and buttery texture while the tuna was a bit on the cold side but not too bad. I couldn't immediately tell what the translucent sashimi was that resembled a firmer tuna but later found out it was red snapper (I didn't even see red snapper on the menu).\\n\\nI returned a couple of weeks later to try some of their nigiri sushi and wound up ordering the Wild Salmon ($2.40), Tuna Toro ($2.20), Saba ($1.75), Unagi ($2.65), Amaebi ($2.65), Ikura ($2.50), and Chopped Scallop ($2.20).\\n\\nI noticed that they are fairly generous with their sashimi pieces... most notably with the salmon, tuna, saba (mackerel), ikura, and chopped scallop. I especially liked the buttery tuna belly and most of the other pieces were spot-on.\\n\\nOn a subsequent visit, I opted for their version of a Chirashi Don ($18.50) which comes with miso soup. I thought the price sounded a bit on the high side but when the massive bowl arrived at my table, I could see why - this could easily feed 2 people. The sashimi, as in my other visit, was clean and fresh and consisted of 4 pieces of salmon, 3 pieces of tuna, 3 pieces of tako, 2 pieces of wild salmon, 2 pieces of surf clam, 3 pieces of mackerel, 2 pieces of squid, 4 pieces of snapper (I think), as well as tamago. For the first time in a long while, I think I bit off more than I could chew... but I did manage to finish all of the sashimi in this bowl. There's quite a bit of sushi rice underneath that went to waste because I couldn't finish it though.\\n\\nIn late November, I decided to try one of their numerous sushi rolls on their menu and ordered the Tiger Roll ($11.85) which is filled with imitation crab meat, prawn tempura, avocado, and cucumber and then topped with alternating ebi and avocado on top with a special sauce. The roll itself is quite large and the filling reminded me of a mix between a California roll and a dragon roll.\\n\\nIn late December, I returned for a quick lunch comprised of Tuna and Salmon Sashimi ($13.85) and Futomaki ($6.50). As I've stated previously, the sashimi here is pretty good and you get 8 pieces of thick sashimi in the dish. Both tuna and salmon were fresh and slid down so easily.\\n\\nFutomaki is known as a \\"fat\\" roll and this version is no exception. Filled with a combination of tamago, yellow radish, carrot, cucumber, and pickled pumpkin, it can be a bit daunting to try and pick up.\\n\\nAnother visit to LA Sushi had me picking up some more nigiri sushi... Wild Salmon ($2.40), Toro ($2.20), Chopped Scallop ($2.20), Ikura $2.50, and Unagi ($2.65). Simple but good... especially the buttery toro and the plump scallops. Their Dragon Roll ($11.95) is like a giant California roll topped with unagi and avocado. It's satisfying but I guess I've been spoiled by places that present Dragon rolls in the shape of a dragon with a \\"dragon face\\" decoration on one end.\\n\\nOverall, a nice little sushi restaurant in the area and the chef is friendly but the menu offering is a bit limiting."},{"name":"The Northern Cafe and Grill","address":"1640 East Kent Avenue","city":"Vancouver","stars":"5","text":"Very friendly service, owner knows everyone that comes in, and will personally talk to newcomers.\\nAll the food is fresh, and delicious.\\nI highly recommend this place to anyone that wants to have a filling, and satisfying meal."},{"name":"Bagel World Bakery & Deli","address":"10 Sylvan St","city":"Peabody","stars":"3.5","text":"I loved this place, wish it was closer to South Boston.

Pretty much everything they did was wrong. First, someone sent the Birthday Girl a bottle of wine, and she asked for it to be divided among 6 people who wanted it. The waitress was completely clueless, and divided it, unevenly, into 5 glasses, leaving some with more wine than others, and someone without completely. Meanwhile, my friend the Birthday Girl is a bartender/waitress who KNOWS that evenly dividing a bottle of wine is a basic skill of waitressing that should have been mastered.\\n\\nSecond, our party brought our own birthday cake- an ice cream cake to be exact. The hostess was informed that the cake was specifically supposed to be refrigerated during dinner, or it would melt. Guess who received a rousing rendition of \\"Happy Birthday\\" over Carvel Soup? The cake was obviously left sitting out on the counter in the kitchen the whole time we were eating. Then, to add insult to injury, they added a $1 plate charge per plate for bringing our own cake, which they did NOT inform anyone about beforehand, and refused to waive when someone spoke to the waitress, the hostess, and the manager about how they basically ruined our cake.\\n\\nFinally, I had some leftovers on my plate, namely a bit of (improperly cooked) burger and a pile of fries. When I opened my leftovers, there was a tiny bit of hamburger left rattling around a huge Styrofoam container with NO FRIES. \\n\\nOverall, the food was delicious and the ambiance was very cute and cozy. However, the service was so terrible, and the wait staff so incompetent and rude, we all vowed never to go back.

All the windows and doors are blacked out and it's right next to this \\"adult store\\" that also has blacked out windows so it's easy to think that it's just an extension of the \\"adult store\\" next door. Easy to miss this place even if you are looking for it!\\n\\nFood: \\n1) Kakuni ramen: I believe this is their signature ramen. I really liked the flavor of the soup, it's very rich and tasty. I was not that impressed with the noodles. The slices of pork meat were tender. Overall, it's a good dish but the noodles were a little disappointing. I actually like the noodles in the cya-syu men more. But the soup was delicious!\\n2) cya-syu men ramen: GREAT noodles! I loved the chewy texture! The soup was a simple \\"soy sauce\\" based soup so not as flavorful as the kakuni ramen but not bad. If the Kakuni ramen soup was served with the cya-syu men noodles, that would have a been a perfect bowl of ramen!\\n3) Ika sugata yaki (whole grilled squid): tasted really fresh, loved the chewy texture. It was grilled to perfection, I really liked it! It's essentially flavorless, you have to dip it in sauce, but the sauces they provided were pretty good compliments to the squid. \\n4) San Pachi Itame (stir fried snow pea tips): wanted to try this because it sounds so interesting. Turns out this is just the small snow pea stems. It was flavored really well and perfectly stir fried, although the portions were pretty small. Only got a few bites in and it was all gone. Delicious, but not enough of it.  \\n5) Motsum (stewed pork stomach): There was a photo of this dish on yelp posted by another yelper and it looked like it's supposed to be pretty soupy, but our dish was served dry. Even the description said \\"in Miso broth\\" but I guess it's a little unclear if it's just stewed in the miso broth or supposed to be served in the miso broth. But either way, I liked how soft and tender the pork stomach was, the starch cakes had a weird texture to them, but I still enjoyed them. Overall, I liked this dish, I just had a different expectation that it would be more soupy. \\n6) Japanese pudding, Green tea pudding: Served in a small mason jar, it was really cute and equally delicious. If anyone has ever had mango pudding at a Chinese dim sum place, it tastes exactly the same except this is just in the green tea flavor. I really liked it! \\n\\nService:\\nPretty attentive, good about refilling water and clearing our dishes. They were very nice and friendly. The only thing that I didn't like was that they gave us our checks without even asking us if we wanted dessert, which we DID. I almost felt like they just wanted to shoo us out of there. I almost felt bad for making her take the check bad and ordering dessert after to served us the check already, even though I'm just giving them more money for more things I'm ordering. \\n\\nAmbiance: \\nIt's a small quiet, quaint little place. Perfect for a little date or a quiet dinner with your significant other. All the dishes are very small (think tapas size) so it's nice to share and try things with another person or a small group. \\n\\nPrice: \\nBased on the price to quantity ratio, I think the food was definitely on the pricey side.The ramen was definitely worth it but the small side dishes were not. Don't get me wrong, they were delicious, but you don't get enough of it. Everything came out to be over $60 and I was just barely full. If you are just relying on the small dishes, I think you could easily drop a hundred dollars and still not be full. My recommendation is to order ramen only here if you are looking for a deal. Order side dishes if you want to splurge. \\n\\nOverall: \\nI'm glad I tried this place, the side dishes were good but pricey (they really add up and the small portions make it really hard to fill you up) but the ramen is a good deal and is super tasty. If I were to come back, I'd probably only order the ramen."},{"name":"The French Cafe","address":"16412 New Independence Pkwy, Ste 140","city":"Winter Garden","stars":"4","text":"This is a great little french cafe!

The escargot was okay (canned, with garlic), the mussels and frit√©s were good. The biggest thing that absolutely disgusted myself and my date (on my birthday, no less) was the service and sketchy management of payment. We came in with a $100 gift card from American Express. They charged the card for $100, and it got declined. After doing that, we suggested running it for a lesser amount, $96 to be exact. The manager came back telling us, \\"we're not sure what happened, but we didn't get the money.\\" After showing transaction reports of the transaction going through on our end by going on AmericanExpress.com. He claimed that he deleted the transaction. Well, after we did not receive any proof of a void, decline, or approval of the charge, except for an approval on our records without a refund, we further disputed the situation. We didn't want to walk out without proof that we would not be double-charged. About 30 minutes went by without further resolution (we were basically ignored), and finally the poor waiter, who had been dealing with this situation came by and said that he paid for the dinner himself. Working in the industry myself, I was thoroughly digested by the management practices of this establishment. I went forward to the manager and expressed my frustration and claimed that I would pay for the charge to save the waiter from paying for it. The manager took my card and charged me. I still have no proof of being refunded for the very first charge, the waiter is now out $120+, and my bank account has been charged $120.

In retrospect I think that serves as a greater reflection on Safeway as a corporation than this store as a whole. The managers here were very hit or miss. A bad one could seriously run the store into the ground. And they did. I saw it happen. Nuclear winter style. On the flip side,  I was also pressured into joining a union. This made me deeply uncomfortable as I was already making peanuts and now had to give part of my weekly paycheck to an organization that really appeared to be doing nothing on my behalf, When I inquired I was told \\"lots of talks\\" and \\"little movement at this time\\", and \\"stalled\\".

I really wanted to rate Beijing Hot Pot higher since everyone working that night was super nice and attentive, but in the end, it's all about the food. Presentation was good, but the quality was just not the same level as some other Richmond hot pot places.\\n\\nThe good thing about Beijing Hot Pot is that the style of hot pot they serve isn't as played out yet. Beijing style hot pot is more rare, but for the money, I was underwhelmed with the ingredients. All of the meat we ordered was just average in flavour, and we pretty much chose only their recommended/signature meat plates. The vegetables were also nothing special, and like the meat, didn't exude freshness.\\n\\nThe only item we enjoyed was their house sesame dipping sauce. This sauce was so flavourful that it had the unfortunate effect of overpowering the soup bases we ordered. So if you're going to drown your hot pot ingredients in this sauce, it really doesn't matter which soup base you choose.\\n\\nIt could have been an off night since they are relatively new. We also stopped by just after the prime time for dinner, so maybe we got the leftover ingredients from the dinner rush? Regardless, I think I will wait a while before giving them another try.

Well, my boyfriend eats meat. Where I encourage and don't mind it at all, I personally can't prepare raw meat because it has always made me squeamish, even when I used to eat meat. Since I can't make it for him, I'm more than happy to go somewhere that is more carnivore/omnivore friendly. I actually suggested we try this place out.\\n\\nWalking in, you wouldn't expect the high prices. It's decorated in a very casual manner, which I'd like if the prices reflected it, but it's a little irritating knowing how much everything is. If you want $6 per SIDE, I expect to be eating somewhere my chair isn't bumped every five minutes. Yes, this place is popular, but the tables are over crowded. My bf and I were seated in a row of tables for two, and the waitress had to stand really close to my bf or me when she was talking to us, and we mostly talked to her stomach. Also, the woman next to me was a tad intoxicated and we almost had a few collisions because she was moving a little disjointedly. Also, I got the feeling people were stepping on my jacket. They didn't have anywhere to hang them, so the back of my chair was the only choice, and I had to eat with my scarf in my lap. When I left, it was pretty full, and I couldn't even put my jacket on in the restaurant! Also, the music was a little too loud. I'm not an old lady, but I do like being able to talk with the person I'm with, and since the tables were so close, all the parties in our row were shouting over the music and each other. :/\\n\\nI came expecting to order a side and get some biscuits. I'd read promising reviews about the biscuits, so even though it cost $10 bucket of 4, I wasn't going to leave without trying one. However, I realized that with my bf's pulled pork sandwich came two sides (one hot and one cold) for an additional $6-- two for the price of one! This way it was less hit-or-miss for the overpriced sides. My boyfriend ordered me the potato salad without bacon and the broccoli casserole. The potato salad was definitely not the best I'd ever had, but it was okay. The broccoli casserole could be described in two words: undercooked and salty. So mushy and wet, yet the broccoli was overdone. It ended up making me sick shortly after I left, which was quite the drama since my boyfriend and I were walking back to our apt. I would definitely have been upset if I'd paid the $6 for either one. Even if they'd been good, the price didn't reflect the portion size IMO. My boyfriend says his pulled pork \\"Wasn't what he expected, but pretty good.\\" He liked the table's BBQ sauce with it. \\n\\nHOWEVER, I would still come back here for one reason: THE BISCUITS. In truth, each was about the size of two biscuits and I could only eat one despite my small meal. They are delightfully crispy on the outside, and the honey butter is to die for. Nicely whipped, it is only lightly sweetened with honey, which gives it the most delicate sweet flavor. The only thing that annoys me is that the only option is to get 4. I wish they'd also serve the biscuits individually or a half order because my bf was so full, we ended up bringing three home!\\n\\nBasically, if you're a vegetarian and coming here with some friends, I'd recommend just getting biscuits (to share) and a special drink. I didn't try the Dollywood, but if I come back I plan to because the girls on either side of me got it. I ordered the sweet tea and I liked it, but I had to stir it before I tasted the sweetener. I do wish they'd have at least one vegetarian plate, and since it's owned by a Top Chef alumni, I'd challenge her to come up with something creative."},{"name":"Dragon Court","address":"4250 Alafaya Trl, Ste 200","city":"Oviedo","stars":"3","text":"Just skip it.

AFURI Ramen + Dumpling opened in downtown Portland, right across the street from VooDoo Doughnuts. They are a little more casual than their original Portland location in that you order and pay at a kiosk, grab a number, then seat yourself. Their kiosk is very informative as there are photos and buttons describing each dish. The restaurant is clean, spacious and there is plenty of seating inside and out. We ordered the soft shell crab bun, tonkotsu shio ramen, and the AFURI special (of the day) - clam and chicken broth ramen. Every single bite of this meal was delicious! \\n\\nThe soft shell crab bun ($7) - so delicious! Crispy soft shell crab, with kimchi and spicy mayo, on a soft white bun. This was extremely good!...presentation and flavors were excellent. This dish went by quickly! \\n\\nThe tonkotsu shio ramen ($13) ~ broth was hot and flavorful, ramen noodles were thin, excellent texture, chasu was delicious, egg and other toppings were excellent compliments. \\n\\nAFURI special - clam and chicken broth ($15) - excellent!! I was a little skeptical, but the broth flavor was excellent! You can really taste the flavors of both the clam and the chicken in the broth. The bowl came with 3 pieces of clams and their delicious chasu. No egg, but you always have the option to add any toppings you like at the kiosk. This bowl was definitely a winner as each bite left me wanting more. \\n\\nOverall, AFURI ramen + dumplings is one of the best ramen restaurants ever. The flavors of their broth are so delicious. They are flavorful but not overpowering, simply just perfect. Noodles are done right and all toppings are perfect combinations. You definitely want to try AFURI downtown if you are looking for good ramen in a fast, casual setting."},{"name":"Kabsa House","address":"1128 Robson Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"3.75 star place!\\ngreat middle eastern place right on Robson! specializing in Kabsa places or meat or fish topped over a mound of rice! \\n\\nstuff tried: \\n\\nfattoush salad: nice crispy pita strips and very fresh cucumber and tomatoes spiked with sumac spice. refreshing!\\n\\nmolokhia soup: love this soup and have had it mostly in egyptian restaurants.  nice garlicky flavor\\n\\nfried basa fish with bukhari rice: dinner portion you get two ample fillets of basa which is like a milder tasting fried catfish. bukhari rice is the way to go as a side and is very flavorful and topped with raisins.  you can also get french fries or saffron rice.  \\n\\ni actually couldnt quite finish the entire meal (had some rice left) which unlike me.  will definitely try the chicken or the lamb next time as those also looked delicious!"},{"name":"Northstar Caf√©","address":"4241 N High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"I have been on yelp for several weeks now and have noticed that if I really like somewhere they get a five star review.

Home fries served along dishes come with a delightful and heaping assortment of mixed veggies - and you'll want to finish them just like mom ordered. Side dishes of meats alongside egg dishes include fresh grilled chicken - a nice addition - or one can go for the usual bacon, sausage, or ham. You really can't go wrong here.

It's essentially tuna cut up into little squares with seasoning and it's one of the most refreshing dishes I've tried in this fine city (also marked down to only $5 for happy hour). In addition, I tried the beer battered OG tacos and they weren't too bad either -- but the ceviche is undoubtedly the best thing I tried that night so it was hard to compare the two. My friend had their broccolini and seared scallops (which she didn't like but was able to switch out for shrimp tacos). We tried a variety of drinks, but the best, in my opinion, was the island time (be sure to sub out tequila for mescal if you want both a smoky and fruity taste). It's only $6 during happy hour and not too strong or too watered down but perfectly balanced. The waitress was completely attentive during our visit, got our food to us quickly, and we both thoroughly enjoyed our meals. Although the space is on the smaller side, they have both indoor and outdoor seating to accommodate people who prefer either and on days like the one we went, it's the perfect patio bar to visit for bites and to hang out with friends.

It's a cute restaurant in a busy neighbourhood with great service! \\n\\nThe food was okay, it's overall an Asian influenced brunch food. \\n\\nBulgogi hash - $16\\n- I thought this was the best of the three, they respected the traditional bulgogi flavours and elevated it with classic sides like daikon, corn potatoes, and carrots cooked with western cooking techniques. I was disappointed with the cook on the carrots and daikon. They were undercooked for me and were too crispy for my liking. I would have liked them softer, and used other textural ingredients for contrast. The corn was still on the cob, while it looked good, it was inconvenient to eat. I also think that if they took it off the cob, gave it a little char, it would have served as a perfect textural contrast and lended the hash a nice smokey flavour. I opted for the poached eggs which were great. Good quality free range eggs and good poach. \\n\\nChicken karage hash - $15\\nThis chicken karage dish looked gorgeous, chicken was well cooked, and was not a classical crust. It wasn't the best crust you would get at a typical Japanese izakaya but was a good taketo make it more elevated. The sides were the same as the bulgogi hash, and my feelings about the sides are the same. \\n\\nCoffee crusted pork belly hash - $15\\nThis was my least favourite of the 3 and was kind of disappointing. The pork was mediocre at best. The acidity of the coffee didn't come through to balance the richness of the pork and it was a tad underseasoned. I would have liked to have a different element of acidity to balance it. Something like what jam cafe does - Onion jam, or balsamic reduction would go well. Pork didn't have too much flavour and wasn't that tender for a pork belly. \\n\\nOverall, it was a nice place to have brunch, food was okay.

A few times against my better judgement I have done this as I think to myself; \\"Yay, I like spicy stuff and yay I like Tuna so what could be better!\\" More like what could be worse; when you get the mashed up or mixed potpourri of tuna mush it is mostly the cutoffs from tuna sashimi cuts and therefore not that appetizing; hence the masking via spicy sauce.

Yeah, the performance & numbers are up there, but in a chunky old school kind of way. I get that lots of people have no time for Euro sublime. Okay, I'm making a note to stop using cars in future sushi reviews. \\n\\nThe bottom line is Musashino has good fish, the nigiri pieces are huge, and if there were big changes from the Mopac venue to this new relocation at 29th & Lamar, I really couldn't tell much difference. Oh wait, there's probably more patio seating now. \\n\\nAnd most food-heads know Austin's current Sushi Kings have all worked the Musashino line at some point or another, and then graduated to their own restaurants & dynasties. Cool. I actually didn't see the current menu or service staff, the two of us just sat at the sushi bar & dealt directly with Chef Mike: \\"Bring us a pair of something, please.\\" \\"And now something else.\\" \\"And another, at your convenience.\\" That's pretty much how I do sushi at sushi places. If your sushi chef isn't putting much thought into what he's serving you, why should you put much thought into coming back? Oh yeah, our sushi chef's name really was Mike. \\n\\nAnd he's a thoughtful guy, because we were getting good stuff. If I could tell you what most of it was, I'd be at home doing it and not going out paying for it. I suppose the real bottom line here is if you can remember when Musashino was Austin's premier sushi place - long before we knew what hip & cool was - it's refreshing to know they're still around. Old school is still good school."},{"name":"Breakfast Table","address":"3014 Granville Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4.5","text":"This little breakfast-only restaurant in Fairview has become my go to place for hearty Canadian breakfast since opening this year.

Beers took 20 minutes to arrive.  45 minutes after ordering, the food arrived.  Many of the dishes were off.  Sauces were missing.  Wings had wrong sauce, waffle fries were cold and mushy.  One member of our party just never got his order (wings).  After delivering the food the waitress vanished.  We had to track her down and swap out some dishes for the correct items ordered.  Another 30 minute wait for the correct food to arrive.  Food was just OK.  The member of our party who was waiting for wings was still waiting for his original order.  We finally track down the manager since our waitress has stopped coming to our table.  After we had all finished eating, about 2 hours after we arrived, we finally get the missing order of wings.  \\n\\nTo her credit, the manager was apologetic and comped his wings and also provided some desserts and 10% off for the rest of the table.  After that and now a full 2 and a half hours into the meal we cannot find our waitress to get the bill.  We had to track down the manager again to pay.  After they gave us the bills they never came to pick them up and we ended up taking them up to the bar ourselves so we could finally leave.  The restaurant was not busy and the orders were mostly wings and burgers which should fly out of the kitchen, so I don't know what was going on that night.\\n\\nVery disappointed in our experience here.

Mind you, there were up to 4 people behind the bar.

The staff is very accommodating, friendly and attentive. The restaurant is so big and offers different types of seating (i.e., table, by the bar, outside). Their menu is quite diverse and can easily please anybody. When my main meal arrived, the spaghettini with Kobe style meatballs, I was surprised that the pasta and the meatballs were covered in different sauces. But somehow, the mushroom sauce on the pasta and the tomato sauce on the meatballs worked! Their menu items are also fairly priced (for Vancouver of course). However, their reservation system is flawed. Only 30% of tables can be reserved, so showing up without a reservation is the most plausible scenario to occur. On a Wednesday night, as a group of 4 people and on a beautiful evening at around prime supper time, we were told that we would get a table in 45 minutes. While waiting, we saw so many people trying to come here but walked away since the wait time was too long for them. We also noticed many empty sections throughout the restaurant, and we can only assume it's due to the lack of staff, but it's quite unfortunate for them as they lost so many potential customers. I'd say that the wait for the view, the food, and the service is worth it, but if they change the way they manage reservations or if they hire more staff, then it would be an amazing restaurant."},{"name":"Chela Tequila & Tacos","address":"183 S Orange Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"This is a great place to go on a Tuesday because it is $15.00 all you can eat tacos, and their are specials on Margaritas.

It is so good, my cousin and I split one of the 3 meat platter (chicken, brisket & pulled pork) with cole slaw and Mac & cheese as a side. OMG it's to die for. The meat was cooked to perfection. Brisket was my favorite by far. The cole slaw was very good, and I typically don't care for coleslaw but it wasn't over done with extra sauce and seasoning like it usually is. The biscuits...seriously was my favorite part of the meal. I would go back just to eat the biscuits.

My kids had a blueberry scone though, which I have never ever liked scones because they're either too sweet, too dry or too hard. Jim and Patty's scones are what scones are made to be. So perfectly moist but not to the point of being like a cake, more like what every scone aims for and misses. They are sweet but not overly so, and firm, but not hard.

The prices were also incredibly reasonable. The cost was on par with (or slightly less) than nearby Canary Square where we often end up, yet the food at The Haven was several notches above. My preferences skew pescatarian (I'm not one for large amounts of red meat), so I was pleased to find so many dishes that sounded hearty (seafood stew, vegetarian curry, salmon with veggies) but not too heavy. I ordered the seafood stew for an entree and my boyfriend had the shepherd's pie. We both loved our dishes!

Everything is handpicked and fits with the menu. We got the pork tacos and the burger. Both were great and the price was right. My burger was especially perfect and it had a jalapeno marmalade that made it really unique. Not to mention cooked just right with great beef.

(Sometimes restaurants go offline and need to be re-booted.) I spoke to a man with a heavy hispanic accent, who was very short, curt and dismissive of my question. He told me Uber decides when they deliver. I wasn't confident he gave me the correct info, so I asked if I might please speak with a manager. He grunted, put the phone down and walked away. He literally, intentionally left his customer holding indefinitely. \\n\\nWhat he did NOT expected was that I would actually SHOW UP to the restaurant, phone in hand, still \\"holding for a manager\\". \\n\\nWhen I arrived at the restaurant, I asked to speak with a manager. This manager was quite surprised when I held up my phone to show him that he put me on hold 38 minutes ago. He apologized and said he didn't know who would do such a thing. \\n\\nHe knew the entire time that it was HE who was so unbelievably unkind to his customer. When I asked repeatedly who was responsible, and what other males here had a thick spanish accent, this manager actually threw the server under the bus...a tall, thin, bald African American man who did not speak Spanish. He also said it could be the African American people back in the kitchen. I spoke to other employees while I was there, because I wanted to identify the man with the thick accent. Everyone I spoke to confirmed that there was only ONE person there with that thick accent. That person was the MANAGER. He was wearing a blue shirt, has greying hair. NO OTHER EMPLOYEES had any sort of accent.\\n\\nHe wouldn't tell me his name (DOM), but he kept trying to make me go away by saying, \\"don't worry, I'll find out who it is, I'll handle it.\\" But it was him all along.\\n\\nHe tried to buy me off with a burger that he put into a bag UNWRAPPED. he literally took a burger into his hand, and put it in a bag with no wrapping. He was very nervous because he knew he was guilty. He did NOT expect to have to answer for his intentional rudeness, and what's worse, threw his African American employees under the bus to save himself. \\n\\nSo to all African American employees who work at this location, be advised that your manager Dom WILL, without a second thought, throw you under the bus, BLATANTLY LIE ON YOU and say you did something awful that he himself actually did, and TIM, the Orlando Division President, and SCANLON, who is above him, don't think its all that big a deal. And he will continue to be your manager. God bless you all....you are up a creek.\\n\\nTim said he was going to terminate Dom for his egregious acts. There was video, and I suggested he check for proof. Tim BLATANTLY LIED. He saw the proof, but Dom is still there, to continue to be a poor manager and treat his Black employees with a gross lack of integrity.\\n\\nThat is the kind of company you work for. Be warned, and watch your back. Your manager has NO integrity, and he isn't really required to have any apparently.\\n\\nFor the record, I also watched guests standing forever, waiting to be seated, and there was a lady there in a white shirt who told Dom that \\"I'm not seating them.\\" and let them continue to just stand there. This place has a lot of customer service issues. Don't count on them getting fixed though, because the leadersip condones it by its inaction.\\n\\nMr. Scanlon himself, despite working for this company for decades and being in an upper leadership position, is not a good listener at all, and condescended to me in a way that was grossly offensive and made the situation worse. In addition, he is in serious need of customer relations and leadership training. He was a case study in how NOT to handle escalated customer dissatisfaction situations. Every word he said was condescending, interrupting, made me feel not believed or taken seriously, and then he somehow turned himself into the \\"victim\\". And he also made excuses for both Dom and Tim, who told me blatant LIES, and that restaurant is still a hot mess."},{"name":"Taqueria La Fuente","address":"12198 SW Main St","city":"Tigard","stars":"4","text":"Three stars for the tacos, but great service bumps the rating up to a four. For the people claiming El Fuente's to be the best tacos around, I hope someday they can make it to Las Casitas in Tualatin. \\n\\nThe good: complimentary chips and salsa were solidly decent and the waiter was really friendly and helpful in filling drinks and salsa. Tacos were huge, filled with lots of meat and cilantro. Tons of drink selections: horchata, real sugar Coke/Pepsi, Mineralagua, Jarritos, etc. Prices are extremely reasonable for homemade food (chips + salsa + 3 tacos = $9). The staff greeted clientele like family and were very attentive.\\n\\nThe not so good: the food wasn't seasoned all that well, and their red/green salsas just ain't it. The barbacoa in the tacos tasted straight up like unsalted pot roast and was slightly overcooked (stringy). The tortillas were a little dry on the edges, not deliciously soft. The radishes provided as a garnish were dry, like left out all day dry; the red/green salsas for the tacos are just okay.\\n\\nI love tacos very much. I don't love the tacos here.

This little shop is located inside Fubon Supermarket. Asian cakes have a lot less sugar compared to your typical American cake as it has a light whipped cream frosting compared to a sugary frosting. This is why we prefer to order our cakes through Asian bakeries. \\n\\nUsually we go down the road to Mei Sum Bakery but was told they wouldn't be doing custom Durian cakes until the new year. I ordered a 8\\" fresh Pandan and Durian birthday cake for my sister which costed $30. Usually the whipped cream frosting is white but I asked it to be purple since that is also my nieces favorite color. They provided a booklet of designs where we were able to chose from and adjust without any additional fee. While browsing the bakery I noticed that they make the pastries fresh in the back room and restocked them throughout the day. There was a lot of people coming in and out of this bakery which suggested this was a popular spot for a quick snack. When I picked up the cake I also picked up a Strawberry Swiss roll-- all tasted great and reasonably priced. The whipped cream frosting that was requested to be purple was very beautiful, however, it was a little bitter. They did mention that it was naturally colored and I'm sure if we didn't request the addition of a color it wouldn't have that taste. \\n\\nIn summation, I would prefer Mei Sum Bakery over Meianna Bakery but I would come back.

She gave a little blurb about Cat Cora after she greeted us, which I heard all over again when she was tending to the table next to us. And yes, we were all seated rather close to our neighboring diners; too close for comfort. It also made for a very noisy dining experience overall.\\n\\nNevertheless, the food was great! We had the Disney Dining Plan and with it, each individual is allowed 1 non-alcoholic beverage, 1 entree, and 1 dessert. We admittedly were not the most adventurous with our selection, but it was what we were craving that evening. So the entrees chosen for consumption were the Cinnamon-stewed Chicken with Tomatoes, Herbed Orizo, and Kasseri Cheese, and the Wood-grilled Rib-Eye Steak with fresh Herb Salsa, Asparagus, and Kouzzina Potatoes.\\n\\nBoth were quite wonderful. The Chicken dish was slightly better than the Steak mainly because the Steak was cooked rather unevenly. I had ordered it Medium, and the first few bites were indeed deliciously Medium, but as I progressed, I noticed that one end was close to Well Done and it progressed slowly across the Steak into Medium territory. I had to eat it in that progression as well to ensure that my last bite was actually the piece that was correctly cooked.\\n\\nAside from that minor inconvenience, the dish as a whole was really pretty good. The seasoning on the steak was great and so was the Herb Salsa (which reminded me of chimichurri in terms of looks and consistency), and the potatoes were excellent. The asparagus could have been cooked longer, but that might just be me being picky.\\n\\nThere was hardly a flaw in the Chicken dish. Everything was cooked perfectly. I was afraid that the Cinnamon would overpower everything, but that was not the case at all. You could taste just a hint of it, which created for a wonderful surprise with every bite.\\n\\nFor dessert, we chose the Loukoumades (aka Greek Doughnuts) and the Chocolate Budino Cake. The Loukoumades were definitely fresh as stated in the menu, and the \\"dipping sauces\\" of melted chocolate and raspberry made for an excellent dessert. The Cake was a little too chocolate-y for me - too dark, too bitter, and 100% chocolate. I prefer more variety and can't really handle bitter chocolate. But my dining partner loved it.\\n\\nOverall, it was a wonderful dining experience, and I look forward to visiting this restaurant again. Perhaps for breakfast next time."},{"name":"Yuzu","address":"4130 SW 117th Ave, Ste H","city":"Beaverton","stars":"4","text":"This place has pretty decent ramen and service.

Tucked away past the busiest part of Rainey St, it's a lovely space with its own garden, comfortable, spacious and elegant seating, and good service. It was the food, however, that disappointed. We had the carrots in mole(delicious, but they couldn't carry the whole meal), the snapper (the flavors and textures didn't work), the brisket (the flavors overpowered the lovely texture) and the cacio e pepe (lovely, in both flavor and texture). The oysters and rye bread course served dim sum style were nice but I found the mish-mash of service styles was distracting.

They will bring you bottled water, but if you want a drink of water from the tap, you can either go get it yourself before you're brought your other items or afterward, of wait until you have received them, but they won't bring it to you.

I went here with a couple friends for one of their birthdays durring magical dining and everyone was very happy with both the food and the service. Although we had reservations there was still a bit of a wait so my girlfriend and I got a couple cocktails while we waited. I got a blood orange Manhattan and she got a pomegranate martini. Her pomegranate martini was sweet and refreshing. The blood orange Martini was also a bit sweet but really had a good Smoky flavor. It was very strong and one of them had me on my way considering I had an empty stomach. Once we were seated our waitress offered us a wine menu and bread and made some suggestions with the magical dining menu. Throughout the night she was very attentive and pleasant. The lobster bisque was phenomenal. Large chunks of Lobster in a deliciously creamy broth. It was everything you would want a bisque to be. My steak was cooked perfectly and was extremely tender and juicy and very flavorful. It was probably one of the top three steaks I've ever eat. For dessert the cheesecake was a much bigger slice than I would have expected for Magical dining and the moose was a huge cup of rich smooth goodness.

The fried rice was perfect and then the noodles, rich and garlic infused(no one in Nashville serves noodles). The vegetables were cooked to perfection, the shrimp and scallops were on point and the filet was one of the best I've ever had (and we've had a lot of top dollar steak dinners).

At first glance, this is a very nice restaurant in its own building, in a little plaza on Lake Underhill adjacent 408. The inside is very nicely decorated, with large marble tables and matching red color theme all around. \\n\\nHowever, the atmosphere is somewhat sporadic. Sometimes, its just a normal restaurant atmosphere, but sometimes, late at night the karaoke machines come out and it gets pretty wild. I don't reeeallly mind but its a bit disruptive to the other guests who cant even hear each other speak over some really bad singing. \\n\\nTheir sushi/sashimi selection is your average selection, yellowtail, salmon, tuna, etc. lt's better than Izziban but not awe inspiring. The old sushi chef who left used to cut the cuts a bit thicker, and be more creative, sometimes searing some nigiri and adding toppings such as ikura or eel sauce. I miss that. \\n\\nThe hotpot and bbq are both very yummy, and sometimes the specials can be very easy on the pocket. However, sometimes the brisket didnt cook or fold out all the way and this was a bit detracting from the experience. I really like the hanger steak and pork belly for the BBQ, and lamb for the hotpot. \\n\\nService is.... ??? I've had both really good service, most of the time servers I know, and really bad service, mostly from the newer servers which they seem to be rotating out more often now. So i'm not saying you'll have a bad experience, its just hit or miss. One night I had spotty service, forgetting orders and small things and the server offered to cook our food even after we said we had been here before. It seemed like she was trying to milk a tip from us rather than make the whole service experience complete from the start. \\n\\nThe business tried weekday lunch for awhile, but has since stopped because I guess theres not enough businesses around.

No, it's not because I'm a super nice guy who just loves life and wants everyone to have all the stars they can, LOL.  It's because I use Yelp! to determine where I eat and shop and 99% of the time if I pick a 4 or 5 star Yelp! then I'm going to get a 4 or 5 star experience.\\n\\nNot this time.  \\n\\nThis was one of the very odd times that I was, and am not, on the same page as the majority of Yelpers!  I had purchased a Groupon from Cardones a few months back and despite the fact that they are very close to where I live I had not had a chance to get over there and the Groupon was expiring so it was time to go.\\n\\nWe arrived to a really nice and beautifully set restaurant.  Although it wasn't all that large it was bigger than one would think from the front and it certainly had a real high-end atmosphere about it.  So far so good I thought.  We were seated very quickly and our waitress came over and took our drink orders quickly as well.  We ordered our food and waited for our appetizer, which was crab cakes.\\n\\nThe crab cakes arrived and we each grabbed one (there were two total-see pic).  My fiance commented that they looked burnt and indeed they were pretty well done but the taste is what matters.  I tasted mine and unfortunately it didn't have a lot of taste.  I didn't much care for it but I figured it was just because having worked down south in the Virginia Beach area that I was too used to super high quality seafood.  My fiance however also did not care for the crabcake she had.  I mostly finished mine.  She did not finish most of hers.  I had the Mushroom and White bean soup to start with and it was pretty decent, nothing extraordinary but not bad.  Stefanie had a Cesar salad and liked it ok, again though nothing extraordinary.  It was nice they offered anchovies but she passed and I took them.  I really did enjoy the anchovies!\\n\\nNext was our main course and they arrived in a timely fashion.  Stefanie ordered lasagna which looked really good (see pic) and I ordered the shrimp scampi, which again looked pretty good but the pasta portion seemed, for the price, to be a bit small.  Stefanie ended up eating about half of her lasagna.  There were a couple of things she didn't like, first of all it had hardly any cheese in it at all.  The only cheese it had was a bit on the top as you can see from the pic, none at all throughout the rest of it.  The pasta was also a bit scarce in her entree and it was quite saucy.  A LOT of sauce in fact.  Which usually for her is a great thing but in this case it was doused in oregano and had a really peculiar flavor. \\n\\nMy shrimp scampi again was, like most of the food at this place, decent but certainly not above average and not at all worth the price of what Cardone's charges.  The shrimp was pretty good and they didn't skimp on it but the pasta tasted cheap and was definitely not homemade and there wasn't very much of it.

It's comfortable seating but do expect to wait especially on the weekends 30 to 45 minutes. As they get really crowded. They have a decent beer selection and on your way out the door you can buy a six pack of their brews that they make right there. That's 10 bucks a six pack. And it's all canned beer.  As far as the menu goes it's about like a Sears and roebuck Christmas catalog. I'm not shitting you way too much to choose from. They could cut the menu in half and there would still be too much.  As it takes quite a bit of time to go through the menu and unless you already have something in mind that you want to eat. Everything is priced close to market price same thing with the drinks.  I got the barbecue brisket burger. It comes with barbecue brisket and bacon it was pretty good. And cooked as I had it ordered.  There we're enough french fries to easily feed two people.  Which is good if you like that kind of carb. I would say less fries and add 2 to 3 more ounces of meat to the burger. Service was good we sat at the bar instead of opting for a table which was the 30 to 45 minute wait.

I picked the sakura roll (spicy tuna with chopped scallop) which is my regular, the friend on a diet recommended the volcano roll (spicy salmon with chopped scallop and black sesame sauce) with a hint of jealousy in his voice, and the rest of the choices were a queen roll, rainbow roll, and the stanley park roll. \\n\\nThe clear winner was the volcano roll. The spiciness of the salmon is neutralized by the black sesame sauce making this roll totally flavourful and very unique. It'll be my new favourite pick from now on! \\n\\nAlso loved their wakame salad, it's a good portion size and seasoned well (not too salty or oily).

He told us we were there too long already and he had a wait list and needed the table. He told us we could go to the bar, which was already full, or leave. He was a complete asshole about it too, he didn't ask nicely. We told him if he had waited five minutes we would've been out of there and we never would've had this interaction. We left immediately and saw there were barely any people waiting. The dining room inside was half empty so if people really wanted a table they could've gone inside.

After all, you hired them!  This particular bartender was so rude, accusing my partner of having an expired license, which was from out of state and was just not looking at the right numbers?

At this juncture (with all the patrons staring our way in silence), we were so embarrassed that we got up and left. I wouldn't have felt comfortable with her making a drink. Should an owner read this, I highly recommend you reevaluate this employee, watch her closely, should you wish the bar presence to be remembered as not a resentful, troubled girl who takes her personal issues and dumps them on your patrons without care for your business.

Its an outdoorsy/garden-like/ house themed and cosy eating place. The price is definitely hefty but the atmosphere and service make it worth the money. The food comes in small portions so its not super filling, but it tastes quite alright. My rating is high more for the ambiance than the food, I really didn't think the food was THAT great but the place sets a great mood for date nights, quiet dining, friend dates and such. I went to go celebrate an internship offer with my parents and they gave us drinks on the house. So I can say the service is also impeccable! Parking is a little difficult but it's manageable, there are random parking spots around the restaurant that you can take.

Let's start wih the negatives: 1) the crust is only on the top part of the pie, 2) the chicken and gravy are bland, and 3) there just aren't enough veggies, where are the peas?, in there!  I've gotten the jumbo 6 servings size twice and call ahead to have them heat it up for me.  Now on with the positives: 1) the amount of white meat chicken is very generous and makes up for it being pricey, and 2) the rolls, purchased separately, are very fresh and tasty and go well with the chicken gravy.  For someone like me, who really enjoys the veggies and seasoned gravy of a traditionall chicken pot pie - Harrow's does not hit the spot unfortunately.  I don't know if I would go back again and would rather buy frozen ones to heat up myself.

Both very, very gracious, apologized for the treatment described below, pledged to use my review and experience to better train their staff (which I was told I did not have to change).  They also offered a meal for the inconvenience, which I accepted on behalf of me and my friend's mom.\\n\\nThe food we ordered -- St. Louis ribs, collard greens, macaroni & cheese, and banana pudding for me; beef short ribs, collard greens, broccoli cheese casserole for her -- was very good. I ordered to go and met Lillian at the door, who was extremely nice. Given the prompt attention and responsiveness of Tiffani and Lillian, I will be happy to dine at Sweet Cheeks. \\n\\nThe rating has been adjusted upwards to reflect their care and attention to this matter, which from my perspective was outstanding.]\\n\\nWhat an absolute shame that my very first Yelp review is for a place that serves great food but where I experienced such borderline hostile service. To summarize, I am visiting a hospitalized friend in Boston from Atlanta. His mom had gone to dinner at Sweet Cheeks a night or two before & had enjoyed the food very much; she asked me to pick up a sandwich for her from takeout which I was happy to do.\\n\\nFrom the moment I stepped into Sweet Cheeks, the attitude of the staff completely took me off guard. I inquired about ordering takeout, and the staff person indicated where I would take my order but almost made it clear I was seemingly imposing upon him even though it was early afternoon and there were only a few patrons. \\n\\nWhen we arrived at the takeout counter only a few feet away, his poor attitude was matched by a young man who was picking up an order for a service who mockingly said \\"What's up, boss? How are you doing, boss?\\" almost sneeringly as he looked me up and down, as if I shouldn't have been in the space. I responded I was fine but otherwise ignored him. He picked up his order and left.\\n\\nI asked the staff member if they accepted mobile payment (Apple Pay) and he said they did not; I would have to use the Caviar online service to place it for pickup. I did this and sat down in at an empty counter. As I sat by myself waiting for my order, serval staff members passed by me giving me strange looks. Finally, another staff member/server approached me and asked me if he could help me -- mall security-style -- and I told him I was waiting for takeout. He kind of turned up his nose and walked away.\\n\\nFinally, when my order was ready I received a notification and went to the take out counter to pick it up. I gave the first staff member my name and order number, and he handed the bag to me without addressing me, without thanking me, and then ignored me completely as I said -- which is common courtesy -- 'thank you' to him. \\n\\nI've run into quite a bit of rude behavior in Boston, but this was the first time I felt entirely unwelcome anywhere. As a customer in general, I actually try to go out of my way to be nice, especially to anyone who is handling my food! \\n\\nThere was no reason for their behavior and attitudes other than this and I will go there:\\n\\nI'm a middle-aged African American man. I was dressed casually, but basically no different than most other people out and about on a cold weekday in Boston. All of the staff in which I came into contact with were white. There were no other African American patrons at Sweet Cheeks at the time I visited.\\n\\nI'm not prone to thinking that a singular poor experience is race-related; sometimes people are just having bad days. But when an entire staff displays attitudes just short of outright hostility, it is hard to see any other reason for it. \\n\\nWhile my friend's mom is African American, she had previously dined at Sweet Cheeks with a white friend of hers and I can imagineÔøΩ?that his mom's treatment or experience was different mainly because of who she was with at the time. \\n\\nMy friend's mom enjoyed her food. I was looking forward to tasting some items from Sweet Cheek's menu myself. But based on thisÔøΩ?experience from the moment I walked into the door until the moment I left, I won't be returning."},{"name":"Vino Venue","address":"4478 Chamblee Dunwoody Rd, Georgetown Shopping Center","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I went here for Dunwoody Restaurant week. I opted for the garlic goat cheese appetizer. It was divine and was presented in a cute little jar with some sprouts sprinkled on the top. The pita chips were pretty much bite sized. Most were crispy and fresh but there were some softer soggy ones that I tried to avoid.\\n\\nI should have read the whole title of the entree. I stopped at \\"braised beef\\" and missed the \\"filet\\" part. I rechecked the menu after being surprised I did not get the chunky tender meat that I had imagined. In fact, I got four little slices of meat on top of waffles. These didn't even taste like traditional waffles. It had an odd aroma to it. The waffles were big enough to make it filling since the little pieces of meat were not impressive. I will give the chef some credit with presentation. Au jus sauce came in a cute little pitcher but it did not add to the flavor of this strange blend of savory and sweet.\\n\\nThe last part of the meal was the dessert. I got the dark chocolate orange pot de creme. It was an interesting blend of sweet and bitter. Again, it came in little containers.\\n\\nFor those who enjoy wine... You can purchase cards and load them with money. There is a wide assortment of wine. You can swipe your cards at different stations to try different wines.\\n\\nAmbience can be romantic.

My 400th Yelp Review !\\n\\nChef's Playground Eatery was on my list ever since they opened and the beautiful social media photos made me even more intrigued to explore this Chef's playground. \\n\\nMy girlfriends and I came on a Sunday morning. We made reservations at 10am, which it the only time they'll take reservations otherwise it's first come first serve. \\n\\nThe seating area is small but there's enough tables to probably fit around 20 people. At around 10:30am the restaurant was already full of hungry people and a waitlist was started - but they'll take your number and call you when a table is ready!\\n\\nI ordered the Steel Head Gravlax Benny. I love my runny yolks - let the yolks run free, right? So I asked for the eggs to be soft poached. Big disappointment when I cut into my egg and it was practically a hard poached egg - nothing running down my bread or my chin here. Luckily my other poached egg had some runny yolk but I would still say it was cooked to a medium poach. It was the same yolk sadness for my other girlfriend's poached eggs as well. Despite the key factor in a good benny - runny yolks - was missing (henminus a star), the rest of the dish was really good. The homemade focaccia bread held itself together enough to be cut with toppings and forked to my mouth with still some fluffiness during the chew. The Gravlax was smooth and tender - very fresh with a hint of saltiness.\\n\\nThe Hand Cut Hash-browns were one of my favourites! The Chef is a potato master - he is able to make these thin cuts of potatoes, fry them to a crispy, crunchy outside that's not oily but then still leave the insides fluffy and soft. They also had a subtle coating of I almost want to say truffle oil? but it wasn't just a naked potato I was eating. Regardless, I loved this hashbrown variation and with a little dab of ketchup - these were perfection!\\n\\nMy other girlfriend ordered the Chef's Hearty Breakfast and it looked absolutely huge and amazing! She ate every single thing on there - a pretty impressive feat - definitely enough for the mom-to-be appetite!\\n\\nOverall, service was really friendly and efficient. It was delicious eating here and satisfying our stomachs while we watched the Chef play in the kitchen - I'll definitely be back at this Chef's playground for more eating soon!"},{"name":"Little Sheep Mongolian Hot Pot","address":"2400 Seton Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Terrific,best, No.1---great food, authentic Chinese hot pot!

Only a few options including the Eggs and Chorizo, Eggs and Carnita, Avocados, and a couple more which I don't remember. Coming from SoCal, my Mexican food standards are extremely high. Pepita definitely doesn't measure up to Oscars or Taco Stand in San Diego, but it's still a step up from most Boston Mexican joints. For $4.50, you get a filled 5 inch round taco that is well worth the price point. The Eggs and Chorizo has a cheddar cheese base which was extremely extremely cheesy. All I tasted was the potatoes and cheese, very little amounts of chorizo. Not bad but also not great. The Eggs and Carnitas also had very little amounts of carnitas. It did include an over easy egg on top which was nice and runny. I personally preferred the chorizo but overall both were average at best.\\n\\nThe food is a 3/5, drinks a 4/5.

As evidenced by the decorative T-shirts and conversations around us, we were not the only ones with this bright idea.\\n\\nThe line to the registers were of the single line serpentine format, which is fairer and faster, but things were rather slow at the register, so it didn't end up being all that fast.  Sometimes none of the registers were actually actively taking orders, although I was not sure what the cashiers were doing at that point.\\n\\nTo get the most taste sensation for our buck, two of us shared the following:\\n\\nBreakfast All Day Burger (730 Cal) $6.97\\nNatural Angus burger, American cheese, hickory bacon drizzled with maple syrup, fried egg, hash browns, grilled diced onions, and ketchup \\n\\n100% Wagyu Kobe Beef Dog (380 Cal) $5.57\\nAll-natural Wagyu Kobe beef dog served with choice of style or toppings \\n\\nLarge Crispy Onion Rings (980 Cal) $5.47\\n\\nCoffee Mocha Shake (910 Cal) $4.77\\nVanilla shake spun with coffee and a splash of chocolate syrup \\n\\nHuge onion rings!

Though highly touted by previous guests, it has room for improvement.\\n\\nI snagged a few fries from a third member of our party and found them to be on the soft side - I'd probably would request them \\"well done\\" as noted on their so called Secret Menu, published on their website.  They were, however, generously portioned for sharing, which was why we were encouraged to help ourselves.\\n\\nThe breakfast burger felt utterly sinful in that my DC was glad that she would be working out the next day.  The Kobe dog was good but nothing special.  I did appreciate that we were given the option of a number of toppings for free as well as a few additional ones for a price, and they were able to honor our request to have them on the side, so that we could each dress our half any way we wished.

Maybe I just ordered wrong, but I don't plan to sit in that long-ass fucking line again any time soon so this one paltry review will have to do.  \\n\\nI ordered the chicken finger combo. The best thing about it was the option to get cheerwine as my soft drink.  Fuck yeah!  Move over Coke, there's a new soda on draft and it's way better than you and Pepsi. (You're still second best in my eyes though.) I think you NC people only like the chicken fingers for nostalgia purposes because what I had was some heavily breaded, straight from the freezer chicken tenders. I think I used to buy the same brand when I had that fryer in my house for a month. I had to let the fryer go after I realized I was eating frozen chicken fingers and curly fries every.single.day. Luckily I was in college and my beer drinking workouts kept me slim. The sides I chose were onion rings and fries.  The fries were ok.  Frozen, but I do love some fried potato, especially when my diet doesn't allow me to eat them very often.  The onion rings were terrible.  Again straight from the freezer onion rings with seriously heavy breading and a teeny onion slice inside every one.  I had flashbacks to the onion rings of my public school youth. Again, you get an option of Cheerwine as your drink, and while I typically always skip the soda option I could never skip Cheerwine. \\n\\nSadly, I didn't get a shake.

I don't think, in my limited experience, some of the reviews are warranted. I've gone a couple times now (just moved to the neighborhood) and feel compelled to provide my qualifications prior to continuing with my review. \\n\\n1. I'm not a \\"fifty-something\\" - I'm in my early 30's. Who cares what the median age of the place is (unless you're trying to score and in that case, this probably helps you out. You're welcome.)\\n2. I wouldn't qualify myself as \\"working class\\", but so what if I was??\\n3. I'm certainly not a \\"loud drunk\\" - wait, I'm going to amend that, I certainly AM a \\"loud drunk\\" but not at 2:00 PM. More like 12:00 AM. \\n\\nGiven those three points, I think I can provide a realistic and balanced opinion of Next Page Cafe. \\n\\nIt is certainly a \\"working class pub in a working class town\\" as someone else put it. No one has ever been rude or mean to me. Perhaps that's because I don't walk in and act disgusted or thumb my nose at the other patrons of the bar? Just a thought.\\n\\nPart of the major appeal for the place is the love for music. They get some great bands (I saw \\"The Dons\\" this past Saturday night...and me and my other \\"thirty-something friends\\" loved the band, loved the people-watching and loved how much fun everyone at the bar was having). Yeah, it gets loud - but it's a bar! \\n\\nWhen I first came here, I was astounded at the cleanliness. The floors aren't sticky - but if you are popping by after the second shift has started on a Saturday night...I'm pretty sure that the floors start to get messy. I spill on the regular...when I'm sober. So after a couple drinks, yeah...things get \\"sticky\\" but if you come here on an \\"off\\" night - the staff keeps the place pretty damn clean. Even the ladies room was cleaner than I had expected.\\n\\nI wouldn't say to come here for the food. It's actually not bad (the bar pizzas are really good), but you will be served on paper plates with plastic utensils. There are plenty of bars that just have a rack of chips covered in a layer of dust that grace the wall of their establishment. This is not one of those places. They serve decent food, the bartenders are friendly and quick to provide service and will often stop to chat for a few seconds before moving on to the next customer, and it's a fun place to listen to great live music. \\n\\nI feel like some folks, thought their opinions are completely valid, might need to get off their high horses and have some fun!\\n\\nOther notes: CASH ONLY."},{"name":"Steak ‚Äôn Shake","address":"12163 S Apopka-vinland Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"2","text":"Horrible service.

I won't even bother to mention any specifics, as I don't anticipate experiencing any problems on future visits - and trust me, I will be back. Basically, they had reservations for about half of what turned out to be a max capacity house; so much so they ran out of menus. Busiest day since opening;  great for them!\\n\\nVery innovative restaurant located in a new space on the south end of Rainey, E&R is a great addition to the neighborhood and Austin food scene as a whole.  Farm to table, locally sourced, seasonal, regional, always changing menu served up in a streamlined modern yet a bit rustic feeling environment.\\n\\nOne fun thing (in addition to devouring fantastic cuisine) about dining at E&R is actually how you order. You can order off printed menu (currently offers about 6 small plates, 3 pastas, 3 mains, and a handful of desserts) and/or you can order directly from the dim sum (not Chinese) style carts and trays right at your table. E&R's entr√©es are larger; however, when they state \\"small plates\\" (including from dim sum) they mean it. Lots of petite servings perfect for sharing...so go with good friends that you don't mind digging into together with. \\n\\nWe tried to order the Wagyu Beef Short Rib to only be informed by our waiter after some time that they had run out. :'( Next time for sure (if they have it on menu and available)! \\n\\nNo worries, plenty of other amazing dishes to choose from; both amazing in presentation and taste:\\n\\nFrom Small Plate Menu:\\nLamb Tartare served with puffed Sonoran wheat crackers - typically don't care for raw much, but amazing flavors and the crackers just made it all work. \\nSmoked Snapper and mustard greens served on large Red Fife Toast - arguably one of the favorite dishes of the night. Highly recommend! \\nPolenta with thinly sliced shitake mushroom and marigold spuma - Super creamy polenta and the spuma added a fantastic flavor and fluff. \\n\\nFrom Pasta Menu:\\nBuckwheat Mafalda pasta with Lamb Shoulder;\\nEmmer Strozzapretti pasta served with Dewberry Chicken and sweet chilis - both pastas cooked to perfection and creamy...just wish there was a little more protein in each.\\n\\nFrom Dim Sum Cart/Tray:\\nWatermelon radish with butter - So simple it was almost laughable, but really good flavor combo. \\nJohnny Cakes with fermented pork - A-OK.\\nCauliflower cooked in black butter - if you're going to eat your veggies this is the way to do it!\\nPork Belly with fried kale and radish - I already said Pork Belly, right? \\nBrioche bun filled with cheese and other heavenly yumminess - I lost track by this point. \\n\\nFrom Dessert Menu:\\nTres Leches with Berry Glaze - Fresh and light.\\nGoat's Milk Panna Cotta with Pecan Granola - set a little less firm than I'm used to, but fantastic flavor. Not too sweet. \\nEmmer & Chestnut Chocolate Cookie Sandwich with Orange Buttermilk Ice Cream - adorbs preso and fantastic ice cream! \\n\\nBottom line:\\nI think a group of four is perfect for this style of dining. Perhaps start with one large entr√©e and then just keep going until your heart is content. Don't worry, the prices, especially for some of the super tiny portions, might frighten you a little; however, when you receive the check with a very full belly to boot, you will be extremely impressed at just how reasonable the \\"experience\\" was - and it is - at least in my opinion. Under $200 for four with a few drinks. \\n\\nTIPS:\\n* Make reservations. I have a feeling there will be a long wait to get into E&R once the word really gets out.\\n*The plates are small, some tiny (pics can be very deceiving), so be prepared to be adventurous. \\n*Don't be shy about their very interesting (never seen before) restroom setup. There is a communal basin station (that can be seen from one side of the bar) and four individual water closets with full doors; 2 for Ladies, 1 for Gentlemen, and 1 for Dames & Dudes. \\n*They have a large patio and bike parking. \\n*Street parking is free Sunday through Wednesday (other days metered). Or, there is a convenient parking garage adjacent to E&R for a small fee. Valet is also available on Thursday through Saturday for $7. \\n*Enjoy! ;)   \\n\\n[180 in 2015]"},{"name":"Stephanie's On Newbury","address":"190 Newbury St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"This place hasn't changed since it opened!

Out of all the dishes, their Fettuccini is my favourite (I'M LITERALLY DROOLING AS I'M TYPING THIS)... Not even my words or the pictures can do them justice, totally recommending ya'll to try it out. \\nThough, one thing that has disappointed me is that they don't have an alcohol permit.

But, they will face the same challenge as the other restaurants in the Marina have faced for years. How do you create a quality dining destination that can be profitable and good when it only has clientele for three months out of the year? It ain't easy. \\nOne measure that RHMB is trying to employ is a streamlined menu. One page includes chowders, oysters, shrimp cocktail and clam ceviche, with some salads and some entrees. There are also some large format shared plates that include 'petit' $60 and 'grand' $120 sized shellfish towers with lots of different items. And a cioppino $32 which is a large bowl of shellfish broth meant to be shared. This menu is concise, but no lobster ravioli, no grilled fish steaks, no traditional lobster presentation. There is a steak entree, a tuna, even a duck. I don't want to suggest that the menu is lacking in choices, but they are not as wide as some would like. \\nThe cocktail menu is a step up from the surrounding competition, but a small step. A few tequila cocktails, but no mezcal. A few rum cocktails, but no mojito. A very good beer selection on draft. Again, streamlined and focused on the not-so urbane south shore crowd. My Paloma was good, but the service ice turns it into a watery mess pretty quickly. Alas, the craft cocktail revolution has ruined me for the mediocre places. \\nThe service is about right for the environment as well. The female associates were hired for their looks first and their skills a distant second. There is one stand out though. She could run the bar herself. A bit older than the others, very athletic build, some tattoos and KILLING IT! As the three other 20 something bartenders were gossiping while I waited to be noticed this server was running her side like a champ!

B-Dubs is known for their annual draft kit that leagues can use when drafting but they have to be reserved in advance as time slots and kits are limited. This location in particular has two sections in the back to the side that are semi-private areas so you can do your draft. The draft kit itself is free and you get to see a bunch of tvs while munching on wings and drinking brews. How could you not enjoy a better draft party?\\n\\nThe kit includes a draft board with hundreds of color coded stickers sorted by position in alphabetical order. This year's kit also includes a first-place mini banner, a last place license plate cover, football field themed koozies, and coupons. The items change from year to year which is great so you get different stuff each time around! Our server/draft party host was super attentive and came to check on us regularly to see if we needed more food or drinks. He also gave us items that we may have needed such as pens, sharpies, or tape. The WIFI works great too so nobody had issues surfing the web, we even video conferenced a couple people who couldn't make it in person!\\n\\nThis was a terrific experience for a draft party and B-Dubs is one of my go-to spots for hosting draft parties each year. This was my first time at this location and definitely enjoyed it! Would recommend doing it on an afternoon as it gets crowded at night.

Had the pleasure of dining at Tasca tonight with an old friend. We started with a half pitcher of red sangria, which was perfectly light, sweet but not too sweet, refreshing, and had the make-your-cheeks-slightly-rosy-effect that is perfect for any season.\\n\\nThen a basket of tasty bread (the first of many) was delivered to the table with a red pepper hummus (hummus was fine, but nothing special), and we ordered the (in order of amazingness) mussels, duck confit (which were hands down the best two plates that we shared), and a mushroom in wine/cream sauce with phyllo dough, seared tuna, and shrimp in garlic olive oil. The food was really fantastic. \\n\\nThe mussels were by far the best dish. They tasted fresh, were served in a perfect sauce that resembled a tangy, utterly fantastic, light tomato soup, with two large toast points. The serving of mussels is more generous than other portions, which I also appreciated. \\n\\nNext, the duck confit was scrumptious. It's served with a sweet cabbage (I think it was cabbage) and the duck is succulent, flavorful, and tender as expected. The balance of the sweet cabbage with the rich duck is wonderful. \\n\\nThe mushroom plate was very rich, as it's thinly sliced mushrooms in a creamy wine sauce in between two thin layers of phyllo. This dish, especially conceptually,is not my favorite dish, as it's essentially great mushroom dip/gravy, uncreatively sandwiched between phyllo.  Obviously, that tastes very good, but it wasn't substantive, I wanted more toast (which is how I believe this used to be served) and more mushrooms and less fatty dipping sauce. \\n\\nThe shrimp wasn't special, but the garlicky olive oil they were served in was very tasty. \\n\\nAnd the seared tuna was too small to be worthwhile. Also, this dish was flavorful, the blackbean mango salsa on the plate is quite tasty, but really, it's three thin slices of fish and 3 tablespons of salsa. Not great value on this plate, especially compared with others. \\n\\nI can't wait to come back to Boston to visit and try some more dishes on the menu!\\n\\nAlso, Eric was a fantastic waiter.

The fried chicken (which practically everyone in our party ordered) was delicious and the biscuits were good, nice and fluffy, but not the best biscuit I've ever had.

Just not that 'special' unless you go in the summer months, when they open the large garage doors and people relax in a half-in, half-out atmosphere. \\n\\nOn a rainy Sunday, I went to meet up with some friends and enjoyed the special cider they make on the premises. You can see the huge tanks of brewing beer behind the glass partitions to the left of the bar. \\n\\nOf course, I was allowed to taste and decided on the grapefruit one. Fortunately for me, a flexitarian, they have delicious fried cauliflower florets. Unfortunately they were a big greasy, as were the pretzels we ordered; both orders had been left too long in the fryer. Personally I prefer a little bit of crunch when eating vegetables. That's why I gave them a 3-star rating this time, because besides the ambience, a person also wants good food to enjoy along with their drinks. \\n\\nMy companions did really like their beers. This brewery is well-known throughout Portland, so the usual accolades count for their excellent beers and beer selection. Perhaps I am becoming jaded, because this place appeared to me similar to many other, medium-sized PDX hangouts. \\n\\nThere was plenty of parking, also a nice feature of this location. The background music was popular and rock, but not such that I specifically remember it. \\n\\nTheir personnel, as usual, is fantastic, kind, and interesting.

There is a sign in the window that they are having open interviews. They NEED to do interviews for new and more people. We walked in, we were after one person who had already ordered. There were maybe two cars in the drive-thru. After we ordered at the kiosk at the entry to the store, we waited and waited and waited some more. There were about six orders inside after us and probably eight cars waiting in the drive-thru. And waited some more. The manager was very put off having to answer a question to help us after we ordered at the kiosk - Apparently the kiosk is the god of the place and the people can't be bothered with anything if you've used it. No one would even look toward the counter to see if anyone needed anything, and trying to get anyone's attention was actively ignored. The people who ordered well after us got their food before ours came up, and the kid who was calling the names on the orders was randomly picking a name to yell. Our food was announced for Jennifer - that is not remotely my husband's name. At least it wasn't as bad as the poor guys after us while we waited to get some mild sauce - the kid called out Paul, and Paul went up to the counter to get his food, but it was really Bill's food. The kid didn't even apologize, just said \\"oh, it's Bill\\" when Paul didn't recognize any of the food in the bags as his.  There was no Jennifer in the place to try to get our food, so I guess we can look on the bright side there.

There is still room for improvement if they want to draw a crowd in beyond their popular 90's night and bar scene. \\n\\nA few bumps during our visit that could still use some improvement include:\\n- Not having a fully stocked bar. It wasn't until my third attempt at ordering a drink that they had all the ingredients to make it.\\n- Not having the fight showing on their TVs that night like they originally thought. I guess they share PPV with other Donnelly Group establishments, and they were SOL that night. \\n- Other than the Vietnamese short ribs that we ordered, the food and menu could still use some work. The salmon dish we had was a bit too greasy and some of the vegetables were still raw. \\n\\nOverall, the menu still needs some work if their focus wants to be about the food.

Also they placed an uncut 1/4 head if cauliflour in the middle. If you were to attempt to cut it, the oatmeal-like risotto would have oozed out of the too-small bowl.

I had to take tums and drink multiple glasses of water. I asked for a caesar salad and I was served 6 whole baby romaine leaves completely uncut.

There is nothing better for me.  That is why Rick Bayless and I get along so well.  I must say there is a gross misunderstanding in this country on what true Mexican is.  Fajitas, gorditas and double wrapped tacos are not true Mexican - fortunately for me this restaurant is not one of those restaurants.  San Anejo Mexican kitchen is true to the name and spirit of some of my favorite parts of Mexico.\\n\\nThe restaurant is found directly of Red Bug in Winter Springs.  The brightly lit sign and restaurant is hard to miss.  As you walk in the ambiance is reminiscent of the recently departed upscale Mexican chain Cantino Laredo.  In fact, if Cantina Laredo was what this place is - they would not be departed but expanding.  \\n\\nImmediately beyond the door you will find the well staffed front desk with multiple cheery faces eager to seat you.  This restaurant knows that you pay for service.  We were sat without a multitude of menu in our comfortable booth.  Unlike many restaurants today they managed to fit everything on one menu.  Less is more when it is done right.  The menu is laid out appetizers and dips, soups and salads, guacamole and ceviche, and then entrees as well as cocktails.  The children's menu is simple but consists of everything you need for the kids; quesadilla, tacos, and a hamburger.  The only \\"issue\\" I had all night was with the quality of the menus.  For a restaurant that was only two months old, they are well worn along the edges.  They should have chosen a heavier stock with aqueous coating.  If anything that would take away a quarter of a star.  Our server greeted us quickly giving us recommendations and taking our drink order.  We ordered the pitcher of the house margarita as well as drinks for the kids.  I can easily say this is one of the best house margaritas I have ever had bursting with flavor and tequila.  I could have started a fire with my breath.  It equally complemented some of the most flavorful homemade chips and salsa I have had.  We decided to order the menu instead of two entrees.  Dinner consisted of; chicken wings, queso, fuego guacamole, Mexican street corn, and Chipolte Patron Shrimp as well as kids quesadillas.\\n\\nThe first to arrive was the traditional queso blanco dip that was good but not remarkable.  The consistency was nice and had good spice.  Next came the Mexican street corn and the fuego guacamole.  Both are worth ordering.  Let's start with the sumptuous Mexican street corn; fire roasted corn, crema, cojita cheese, cilantro, house spices and lime.  First off the presentation is enough to behold but the depth of flavors dance across the pallet.  Truly a really fun dish.  Next let's talk about the delectable fuego guacamole.  It makes all the other gimmick made at the table guacamoles look amateur by comparison.  Roccos tacos take note.  Fresh avocado, chicharron, blistered jalape√±os, queso fresco, tequila bacon, onion, tomato, cilantro, salt and lime create a magnificent dish.  The next dish to arrive was the Mexican chicken wings.  This was the only dish that was pedestrian, but I was craving wings that night.  They were cooked fine, but did not have the depth of delivery like the other dishes.  That's understandable as it was not a Mexican dish - in fact I would probably take them off the menu.  Our final dish was fantastic Chipolte Patron Shrimp.  Patron Tequila Infused Shrimp, smoky chipotle lime cream sauce, cilantro rice and great black beans created a dish that could easily have been a great appetizer.  The cream sauce was a light red hue that had a great kick.  Even though we were stuffed when they told us the flan was home made, we had to order it.  Guess what?  It was great too.  A perfect custard, not too much egg, delicate and exploding with flavor.\\n\\nI loved it I believe you will too.

We obliged and shared the burrata toast and wine country omelette. The burrata toast was basically avocado toast with a heaping portion of burrata on top. The bacon was thick and brown sugar sweet which paired perfectly with the dish. The wine country omelette tasted great with the side of chicken sausage. It was cheesy and topped with green olives, artichokes, asparagus, and tomato - all tossed in olive oil and well seasoned. \\n\\nThe dole whip mimosa tasted exactly like the dole whip soft serve you know and love at Disney. I could hardly taste the alcohol and could have drank them all day if they weren't $15 a pop. They were a decent size though served in a wine glass instead of a champagne flute. \\n\\nAlso sampled the kids Mac and cheese (white cheddar) and it was very creamy and decadent. \\n\\nOverall, it was a top dollar brunch.

I know I'm not supposed to have favorites, but it truly is my favorite place in the city to play. There's just an easiness about it; it's so comfortable. And Copious is a fantastic fit for the neighborhood.\\n\\nCopious has three parts:\\n1. The main level -- The main level is the dining room and bar, and it looks like an art gallery... because it kind of is an art gallery. There are beautiful white walls filled with rotating local art. I know a lot of places have rotating art, but something is different here... the art is gorgeous, colorful, and affordable! Like, I could actually buy pieces for my house!\\n\\nAs a contrast to the white walls, the floors are a beautiful dark wood and the tables are made from reclaimed wood from the original ceiling. Also on the main floor is a private event space where you could host 20-ish people -- perfect for a birthday party or even a corporate lunch (since they have the technology for it).\\n\\n2. The upstairs is a gorgeous ballroom that could fit 200-250 people, with its own bar. This is an event planner's dream.\\n\\n3. The basement is called Notes, and think of it a lot like Brothers Drake. It's dark, more casual, has a music stage, its own bar, and plenty of places to lounge and chat.\\n\\nThere are so many things I love about Copious -- I'm going to do a list:\\n+There is PARKING. Like, a whole private lot that's FREE. (hand on forehead, dramatically falls to the floor)\\n+The views! So many great views of the city and the Brewery District.\\n+The food! I almost forgot I was technically reviewing a restaurant (because it's so much more!). I was there in time for the new spring menu, and everything is hyper local. The produce, the meats, the cheeses... even the booze is local. The menu is legit and incredibly well thought out. \\n+The cost is just right lunch, so you won't feel guilty about going out. The brunch and dinner menus also look AH-mazing.\\n+The menu is diverse, so meat folks, vegetarians, and gluten-free people should be happy. \\n\\nIt's obvious I love this place, and I know they're going to keep making things better and better. On that note, I hope I can provide some helpful feedback:\\n\\nI believe a restaurant can have delicious, well-prepared food and impeccable service AND still be conversational and casual. Think: The Whitney House or Wolf's Ridge. IMO, Copious should be in that same direction. Right now, the service comes off a bit stiff and TOO formal. For example, don't talk to me like I'm at The Refectory. There's no need for \\"Helloooo gentlemen, insert more formalities, yada yada yada.\\" Another example would be -- you left me a pitcher of water on the table so I can serve myself. Let me serve myself instead of refilling every single sip I take. I guess my point is, just unclench a little. I promise you can still have high standards -- and you'll get a few more Bryants in there and not just the Suits (no offense at all to the Suits).\\n\\nI hope that was helpful and not gripey?

The server did mention that the chef was getting settled in so the wait would be a little longer. The ramen themselves were nice and chewy, had good broth that was a good balance for the toppings. My Red Miso had a hint of spice and wasn't overpowering. I did find a peanut in my ramen which was odd and wasn't a big deal but wonder if that was normal or what would happen if someone had allergies (I don't think it was listed as an ingredient on the menu). Also, one thing we found disappointing in a way was the one piece of chasu, though a bit larger compared to other restaurants we wished for more. The bill is brought to your table as well. \\n\\nOverall, I solid spot that has a simple base of ramen and a variety of appetizers that I want to come back and try.

The place is a bygone era beautifully preserved. We thought it looked really cool. The menu traditional steak and seafood. The prices were reasonably average. \\nWe received the \\"bean dip\\", aka tarter sauce with kidney beans served with what tasted like outdated saltines. Then came the popovers and corn fritters.  I happen to come from a professional popover maker and have mastered the art myself so these do not compare to what is served at our house, my son was quick to point that out. The corn fritters were sweet fried balls in a sticky sweet cherry sauce, they were sweet and fried and were tasty for the one we each had. Salads were fresh and a good size they were served with dressing on the side, which is nice, but my blue cheese was not, it was mixed with milk or something thinner than mayo and no blue cheese taste.\\nWe ordered two swordfish steaks which you could smell coming and were as tough as a bad steak. We had to send them back they were just that awful. My mother ordered the bad sirloin steak, it arrived swimming in an overly celery salted Au jus. She ate a third of what she could cut and chew, she sent it home for the dog, who did not complain. My husband ordered the Chicken Marsala, which did not have a drop of the sweet wine in it, it had small canned carrots that tasted like school lunch and the sauce was reminiscent of Campbell\\"s cream of chicken soup. My son and I reordered two small Filet Mignons, these were cooked to perfection but they did add some of that weird celery salted au jus.\\nUpon arrival we talked how we should go here every year for Mom's Birthday, before the meals arrived we knew we would have to look for another venue. \\nAlthough the waitress did apologize for the cat-food steaks, she never offered more than to let us not pay for them, I would have thought that they would have offered a comp dessert or coffee.\\nWe still tipped more than 20%, it wasn't the waitress's fault the cook, (definitely not a trained chef) sucked.

It was light and tasted like a chilled summer morning. The wine wasn't the best match for our food, but I'd get it again in the right setting (like a patio deck watching butterflies dance across a shallow stream). \\n\\nAs an appetizer, we split a tempting Tuna Stack (4 stars - $17.75) with Ahi Tuna, Nori (seaweed), Sesame, Avocado, Cilantro, and Wonton Chips with a Citrus Tamari Vinaigrette. The avocado was fresher than the tuna and with a better sauce this might be more memorable.\\n\\nMy entree was the Blackened Creole Chicken (4 stars - $25) flavored by Cajun Spices & Creole Butter and served with Mashed Potatoes and Roasted Asparagus. I hoped for more spicy heat and much juicier chicken, but it was still satisfying and filling.\\n\\nOlivia went with the Ravioli & Prawn Trio (3 stars - $14.75) that features three Butternut Squash and Mascarpone Ravioli topped by three Saut√©ed Jumbo Prawns and Pine Nuts in a Truffle Butter Sauce. These went together like peas and chocolate. They didn't. \\n\\nThe food was inconsistent and the service nonexistent, but there was one constant at Cactus Club Cafe: noise. It was so loud.

The food was presented well, even as take-out, and I love the compostable take-out boxes. More restaurants in Austin should do the same.

There were definitely a few standout food items (as well as some surprising misses), service was good, and we were digging the ambiance. We certainly didn't have any of these issues with hostess / service that others have reported. \\n\\nFrom a logistics standpoint, Watershed shares a parking deck (behind the restaurant) with other retail / restaurants in the area. Go down the side street on either side of the restaurant  and you can't miss it. \\n\\nReservations not required but this one is on OpenTable, if you use it and want to get your points. \\n\\nI was seated right away upon arrival and the waitress was good enough to come by and check on me while I waited for my friend. (I hate just sitting there without anything to drink while they awkwardly hover somewhere nearby.) \\n\\nWe are both eaters and wanted to try a lot on the menu, so went all out and split the following for lunch (and yes I know this is completely excessive): \\n- Deviled Eggs ($5.25)\\n- Pimento Cheese ($8.50)\\n- Brunswick Stew ($16)\\n- Seared Virginia Flounder ($15.75)\\n- Mac-n-Cheese ($7.75)\\n- Crispy Onion Rings ($6)\\n- Hot Milk Cake \\n\\nAPPETIZERS\\n- Deviled Eggs ($5.25): OK let me just first say that while I like deviled eggs, I mostly just ordered them because my friend loves deviled eggs... but Y'ALL. The deviled eggs! There is bacon on them! And ham INSIDE the egg! Literally the best deviled eggs I have EVER had - and I'm a born and bred Georgia girl. I wish this plate was more like one of those big round barbecue platters just covered in eggs. \\n- Pimento Cheese ($8.50): house-made pimento cheese with pickles, cauliflower, and red pepper jelly. Also a very solid starter! I like creamy pimento cheese. In fact, I get pissed when I order P.C. and it's all lumpy and hard to spread. WTF is that about. This is NOT like that. It's served with benne wafers which have an interesting texture - less crispy, more crumbly. Also recommended!\\n\\nENTREES\\n- Seared Virginia Flounder ($15.75): served with spicy collard greens, Carolina rice grits, and brown butter crumble. Portion was smaller than we expected; I'd guess it's nearly a perfect 4oz serving. Excellent sear on the fish - crispy and golden on the outside, white and flaky on the inside. I did add some pepper vinegar to add a kick to the mild collards (I mentioned I'm a GA girl, right?). We really enjoyed this dish. \\n- Friday \\"Daily\\" Brunswick Stew ($16): the menu offers a daily special - kind of a take on the blue plate special at less swanky spots. I'm a big Brunswick stew fan and was sad to say that this version just didn't do it for me. (My mama's is SO much better, I can't even explain it.) This iteration was almost more like veg (tomato, squash, chickpeas) + pulled pork served atop rice... IDK. The flavor was lacking for me and I prefer a real stew, not a wet hash. Kind of bland.\\n\\nSIDES:\\n- Mac-n-Cheese ($7.75): this was really strange. It was almost like a souffle texture? I'm not sure I like this light, eggy take on mac & cheese. My friend agreed it was a little too weird for her. (Maybe we are just a little too traditional with our Southern sides.)\\n- Crispy Onion Rings ($6): these were ON POINT. Portion was massive. We really liked how thin the onions were cut; it added so much more surface area to carry that yummy crispy batter. We also really enjoyed the spicy roasted red pepper sauce. (It was good on the Flounder, too!) \\n\\nDESSERT\\n- Hot Milk Cake: ordered this one exclusively because Yelp told me to. Not my fave, but at the point dessert arrived I'd already stuffed myself so not sure I fully appreciated it. \\n\\nRecommended!

I was in a rush, but BurgerFi is 5 minutes from me, so I called in advance to see if I could get three cheeseburgers made so I can run in and pick them up and be on time for my appointment. When I got to BurgerFi 15 mins later, my order wasn't even started, then the cashier insisted that it was because I didn't have the app. Remember, I called in advance to assure that everything was as it should be my order, timing, etc. I kept telling the cashier that the Facebook post didn't say anything about a app, but she was insisant. Then the manager came over and said the problem isn't the app, it's that you can only have one order per person and I told him that that's not what I read, he told me technically I can go in and out of the establishment three separate times, but since I've already had a challenging experience, he would let me buy the burgers without going in and out of the establishment three times. (thanks?) Then he couldn't get the register to ring up $15 plus tax for three $5 burgers, so I ended up paying $19 plus tax and the managers justification of the extra $4 was that he still saved me money! I don't have a problem paying full price but in this case, It felt like a bait and switch! I said sure I'll pay extra because I needed to go. Then my order was finally processed after an additional 15 minutes for the 3 cheeseburgers that I had ordered 30 minutes before. I know it's a new store and they have their growing pains, but 45 mins for 3 cheeseburgers that you ordered in advance is painful and I think it could have been handled better.

I made reservations on the Open Table app (specifying it was for my parent's birthday) with great ease and we actually arrived earlier to be seated immediately. The front part includes the bar, a lounge style area and booths along the side. They walked us down the stairs to the backroom. It was this great big room, dim elegant lighting, with large booths. All the tables and seats were seated far away from the rest (minus the few smaller tables in the middle) so you had some privacy. \\n\\nOur waiter was fantastic (I wish I could remember his name). He was very detailed oriented, spoke slowly, and was very knowledgeable of the menu, wines, and food. He kept our glasses full and came back at a steady pace. I always hate when waiters say they will give you time to look over the menu and come back 1 minute later. He was great. We were able to enjoy ourselves and take our time without waiting too long. \\n\\nWe had the steak and Brussels. OMG to both. However, I ordered my steak medium and it was definitely more toward the rare side. At that moment, I didn't care because I was hungry. It wasn't too rare so I still ate it and it was still delicious. My dad also ordered his steak medium well and his was pretty rare as well. \\n\\nAfter dinner, they surprised my parents with a free dessert for each of them. The chocolate cake was to die for!

It does not stand ground against Texas BBQ and please don't expect it to or you will be disappointed.  The BBQ sauces lack depth of flavor needed to be really good BBQ.  That sounds much snobbier than I mean for it to be, sorry. The pork belly was amazing. Order this. It's incredibly delicious and almost makes the rest of the experience worth it.  The brisket was mediocre and I would not order it again, the pulled pork was about average (nothing to write home about but better than most I've had up here), BBQ beans were lacking; however, the mac and cheese was awesome.  Rumor has it that the collard greens were also good. I passed on anything remotely green as it is BBQ. All in all, the food would be four stars relative to my other Boston BBQ experiences (two compared to Texas). \\n\\nThe reason why it's getting one star is for the absolutely terrible service and my overall annoyance with the experience. Oh, and the fact that they not only have Lone Star on the menu, but that it's $5 and the waiter recommended it! To my friend who specifically said she liked craft beer and didn't want anything like Budweiser or Miller Light.  I was so incredibly shocked that I may have given the waiter a slight bit of education around how Lone Star is perceived in Texas (aka. it's the Milwaukee's Best of Texas...even below Narragansett). After that poor beer recommendation, she clarified that she wanted a craft, non-hoppy beer, to which he then recommended a hoppy beer.   Finally, she gave up and settled on wine, which the waiter finally dropped off about two minutes before he came to wrap up our leftovers so we could go home. \\n\\nMy other friend specifically mentioned his gluten allergy but wasn't told about the gluten in the BBQ sauce until after food had already been served and enough time had passed for him to eat some of it. They were good about replacing the food with a new order, but that was about it.\\n\\nAll of our water glasses were empty and the two of us who did have alcoholic beverages were ready for another round half way through our meal but were never given the opportunity to order another one until the wine finally showed up.  When the drinks came (including the long awaited water), it was after the waiter had already run the credit cards.  It's super annoying to enjoy your food and beverages separately, especially when paying to eat somewhere where they should be served together. \\n\\nOnce we got home, we discovered the waiter messed up our to-go containers, even though he specifically stated what was in each one when passing them out.  \\n\\nOverall, disappointing.

Looking at all the pastries they have is mouth watering! Everything looked delicious. My group tried their veggie and meat quiches and the croissant aux amandes.

The quiches were light but filling. The croissant was a bit tough to simply tear apart or cut through, but the flavor was quite good. The reason I don't give them 5 stars is that their space isn't ideal, we weren't sure where the line began to order, there were only menus right up by the cash registers, and they clearly need more seating.

What blew us away when we tasted the benny was the pork belly, it was perfectly charred and was packed with immense flavour. I really enjoyed the bearnaise sauce on it as well which was a nice change from the typical hollandaise. After tasting this we didn't think the karaage would be just as delicious, but it was. It was the perfect amount of crispy, didn't feel greasy at all, and the different flavours used on it just melded beautifully.\\n\\nThe only thing I thought could have been better was the potatoes. Many brunch places seem to have mastered potatoes since they are such a common staple, but these just didn't live up to the expectations we had after trying the meat.  They weren't very mushy inside and didn't have that nice crispy edge, but the potatoes were still good enough for me to keep my 5-star review.

Takes his time to put gloves on & answers my questions in a sharpish & perfunctory manner.

The drinks were strong and the bartenders definitely didn't water them down. However, they were a bit on the pricier side. A prosecco and a rum and coke were $21. Other than that, the music was fantastic. Everyone had a blast and the crowd wasn't rowdy.

They have a good variety of sushi and cooked dishes to keep me coming back. I'm trying to find a balance of getting something I enjoy while exploring the menu each visit. The following are things I've had that I can recommend:\\n\\n- Yakisoba - since I get the pre-packaged stuff all the time from the grocery store. It was a fair enough dish, nice soy sauce flavor, tender noodles. \\n\\n- Ramen (warm, aka traditional) - Not the 30 cent kind we all ate during college. This is on a different level, yet retains enough simliarities for our taste buds to not freak out. The warmth and flavor was exactly what I was craving.\\n\\n- Ramen (cold, summer months only) - This felt more like a noodle salad than anything. Only a small bit of broth, but it does change the flavor dramatically. Still good, very refreshing, a lot of crunch from the veggies, but it's not the flavor I think of when I think ramen. \\n\\n- Salmon sushi 2 piece - one of my sushi favorites, and they do it well here. The fish was fresh, the rice nicely seasoned, went down easy and left me wanting a second order!\\n\\n- Rainbow Roll (crab in the middle, assortment of fish and avocado on the outside) - my go to roll. I would say theirs is solid, but not quite spectacular. One roll is quite filling in itself.\\n\\n- I also ordered some cold sake, which was quite nice and not too sweet. \\n\\nNow for some things off the beaten path: \\n\\n- Yamakake as an appetizer. It is grated yam with a very gooey consistency. The waitress even warned me that some people don't like it. It's certainly different, but add a touch of soy sauce in it, and it's quite tasty. Try it out if you're feeling adventurous!\\n\\n- Gyutan Tare (grilled beef tongue with teriyaki sauce) - surprisingly good! Of course the meat had a little fibrous texture, but they were thinly sliced so it wasn't chewy. \\n\\nThe price for all these dishes are very fair too. You can often eat for two with appetizers, one roll or noodle dish, and still come in under $30. You almost always get a complimentary small ice cream for dessert too.\\n\\nDecor tries to keep some traditional Japanese elements, although the repeating plastic fish on the wall was somewhat funny.

We come up and sit there for probably 2-3 minutes while she if fumbling around with something under the counter and never even looked up. Another cashier comes up and says take a 10 minute break and she leaves and he is like be with you in a couple minutes and walks off. Really?? Yes really. Two people in line behind me grumble and walk out after I asked what in the world was going on. Cashier comes back after a minute or two takes our order, we get a number, and sit down. In a reasonable time one of the managers with read shirt comes out with a partial order of food. He sets everything down and says I owe you fries and I remark and a milkshake. He says they are cooking and he will get them to us right away.

We booked a 12:30pm reservation on our last day of the trip before heading to the airport. We all were excited for the brunch menu and were seated upstairs. When we looked at the menu I immediately asked our server if we could see the brunch menu and were told that they only serve brunch on the weekends (I was so sad as I was looking forward to trying the avocado toast with burrata on it). After looking over the menu which had 2 sandwiches on it, steak frites, a salad, and I forget the last item. The other menu had large entrees intended to feed 2-4 people and priced at over $50 an entree, and small plates. We ordered 3 of the steak frites, 2 burratas, two Mac and cheese balls, and 1 meatballs. All the food we ordered was delicious but small portions. I wish the burrata had an extra baguette under it but only one on the plate. One of the steak frites was so late that my friend ate after everyone else and we were the only table seated upstairs. Downstairs only had about 5 people at the bar so it definitely was not busy. The server was so nice and apologetic and had that item taken off the bill. I really wish that they offered the brunch menu on weekdays as it looked SO good. The wine list is extensive and features all price points so that was impressive. The dole whip frozcato was TO DIE FOR!!!!! I highly recommend ordering this if you get to try this place.

It was too good to leave leftovers.\\n\\nAlso, the folks who work here were SO nice!

The service was ok.  The guy was nice enough but I would have expected more attention since the place was so empty.  The best part is that they have a full bar, including some good craft beer, and a nice outdoor dining area overlooking the water.  Like many of the other reviewers, we purchased the deal where you get dinner and seating for the Cinematic Spectacular show.  I think that is a bit of a rip off since you can see the show for free from many parts of the park (which I did not know when I bought the tickets). However, after a long day walking around in the hot sun, we did not mind having a hearty dinner and then kicking back with a couple beers out on the deck and getting comfy for the show (though I could have skipped the dessert bar, nothing I tried was worth eating).\\n\\nWe started with the spinach and artichoke dip; I was not a fan but my husband seemed to enjoy it and the chips they served with it were decent. I ordered the fried clams for my entree.  They were a little gritty but not overcooked (like so many places do) and I was pleased that they were the whole body, not just clam strips.  They came with sweet potato fries which are always a good thing in my book.  Hubby had a steak which he enjoyed as well.  I really like the amber beer from San Francisco they had on tap (can't remember the name) and they had a few other good beers as well as some specialty cocktails (those were way overpriced but sounded good).\\n\\nI would not recommend getting the package deal for the show unless you are at the park in a really peak time where there is a possibility you might not get a clear view anywhere else.  The show itself is really cool and definitely worth watching. Otherwise, this is not a bad place for lunch or dinner in Universal Studios. I think it was the best meal we had at either park.

We ordered the family meal spaghetti and meatball, fettuccine Alfredo, chicken piccata, asparagus, and the lemon cookies. So good, love the hearty meatball on the spaghetti. It's a big mama nonna style one, that you gotta cut into chunks. The meal itself as a whole was very hearty and filling. I particularly enjoyed the lemon cookies!! They were special, the have a soft crumbly texture that I loved. Over all I recommend this place for family events, or maybe even a date with a girl you're serious about.

Hey, it's a chain steakhouse, right?  But the gaggle of staff who work at the register, as well as the people who work behind the butcher case, are so rude and disinterested, that most recently, I simply walked out.  Nobody so much as blinked!  This must be among the worst places in the chain, as staff are not trying to help or assist, so much as chat with each other.  I don't see this location as having any chance in the long term, unless management hops to!!"},{"name":"Old Hickory House","address":"2202 Northlake Pkwy","city":"Tucker","stars":"3.5","text":"I grew up in this area and the Old Hickory House was always great. Twenty plus years later I am back in the area renovating a home and unless I want a burger, pizza or bar food the options are unfortunately limited for dining out.  I remember eating here about 5 years ago and it just wasn't the same as when I was growing up.  In need of some veggies and tired of the other family owned place in Tucker we stopped in late one afternoon for carry out.  I drive by the restaurant regularly and it's continuously packed so I thought why not give it a try.  We got in right before 4:30 to avoid the dinner crowd.  There were several people picking up carry out orders.  We both opted for the veggie plate with 4 choices and 2 corn muffins for $8.50. All I can say is this is my new favorite place. Between the two of us we had broccoli casserole, cole slaw, collards, mac n cheese , creamed corn and sweet potato casserole. Every dish was outstanding and true to traditional southern recipes. The corn muffins were moist and sweet and certainly don't need butter. The servings size is about one cup per veggie. We had plenty left over for a second meal. As we were leaving with our food there was a rush of guests,  young and middle aged, coming in the door. The parking lot was almost full before 5pm. I noticed another review said this is where the retirees hang out. To me that says it all because they scout out great food at good prices and that is exactly what we experienced. FYI, if you check out some of my other reviews you will notice I tell it like it is. We used to be a huge fan of a particular tea room located on Ponce de Leon but got tired battling the tourists and dealing with limited parking.  I can say without hesitation the meal we had at Old Hickory House was just as good and about $5 less."},{"name":"El Taco Veloz","address":"5084 Buford Hwy NE","city":"Doraville","stars":"4","text":"You come to this place for the food & only the food.

Because in my opinion it is the best thai food i've come across in Boston. If you reopen, i would make some minor changes: location and staff. The location is not ideal because it can be hard to find parking and not close to public transportation for people to come.

What's sad is that this restaurant has great food, quite possibly the best thai food in all of boston. What's hurting this business is the lack of professionalism by the owner and staff.
