The wait for my party of 5 was around half an hour, which wasn't too bad considering how busy it was. The service was quick and efficient. We ordered the thai flavor hot soup, beef hot soup, cheesy milk hot soup, and seafood lobster hot soup. My favorite is the beef hot soup, which I ordered with rice because it already comes with vermicelli in the pot. I ordered it with mild spiciness and I'm glad I did because the hotness of the soup added an extra kick of spice to it. I can tolerate pretty spicy foods, but I wanted to be able to taste the full flavor of the soup. However, I was starving and thought the small pot wouldn't fill me up, but it really did! Additionally, I didn't think cheesy milk hot soup sounded appealing, but it tasted amazing! It tasted similar to corn chowder and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who doesn't like spicy soups.The thai flavor hot soup was good, but mediocre compared to the seafood lobster soup. The seafood lobster soup had a spicy sour flavor to it (similar to kimchi) and was more tasteful than the thai flavor hot soup. The only thing I didn't like that came with the soups were the beef balls because it had a lot of noticeable fat on them. Lastly, the passion fruit green tea and rose matcha latte tasted good (although I never usually order either drinks). The matcha latte tasted just like a sweeter milk tea. One downfall to my experience is that the waitress said didn't have anymore boba (it was only 1 pm). Yet, I saw that other drinks that were brought out after ours had boba.

While I'm not usually a fan of the flavored ales, I had been wanting this particular beer for a few weeks.  It was $4.50 a pint, not a bad price.  \\n\\nNegative points for the waitstaff.  Our waitress pretty much ignored our table, even after the rest of the crew had ordered appetizers and food.  At one point she was sitting with what appeared to be her friends, then she overcharged us on the bill.  Still, it was a busy night and she was nice enough.  \\n\\nI'm going to have to say this spot was \\"ok.\\"  I probably won't ever initiate going there.

We used to love this place and it was one of the first places we ate when we moved to Austin 11 years ago.  In fact one of my favorite desserts I have ever had was at this location.\\n\\nTonight we had dinner with 4 of our friends (6 people total) and it was a disaster.  One of our party ordered Nachos without sour cream.  The waiter came by and explained sour cream was added by mistake so they were rushing out new nachos.  We were about 1/2 done eating by the time her replacement nachos came out.  No offer for anything while she waited except for chips.  Ok this is fine I wouldn't normally ding a restaurant for this because I personally don't expect to be comped when something happens.\\n\\nMy wife ended up with a hair in her food.  She was starving so she cut out that part of her food and ate the rest because they had already messed up the nachos and the waiter took forever to come back.  So we didn't say anything because we were enjoying the company of our friends.\\n\\nThen the final straw was the waiter enticed me with a \\"chocolate cheesecake with raspberry sauce\\".  I love chocolate and raspberry and I knew my favorite dessert was a cheesecake from Z'tejas so I figured I would order it.  So then when the dessert came out the waiter stood there with a slice of cheesecake awkwardly and told me it wasn't really a chocolate cheesecake but a prickly pear cheesecake.   Then he asked if I would like to try it and I thought he was honestly offering it to me for free.  I said I would try it and would even be willing to pay half.  Then he said \\"Oh I would have to talk to a manager about that.\\"  I thought I was being nice because I thought he was giving it to me for free.  No he was offering for me to try it at full price.  Usually waiters should come to the table and tell you that there was a mistake and offer something else if the dish you ordered was not available not bring you the wrong dish and offer for you to try it for full price.  Then after this awkward exchange he said he would go see if the manager would comp the cheesecake for me.  He then comes back after I had 2 bites and said \\"If you eat it you have to pay full price for it.  Do you want me to take it away from you or not\\".  Being with friends and not wanting to be awkward I offered to pay for it.  I also mentioned for reference that my wife's food also had a hair in it. And he said \\"Oh I could have comped that if you would have told me earlier.\\"  I didn't say anything else.  The cheesecake was ok but if I was offered it as what it was I would have never ordered it.\\n\\nThen on the way home my wife told me that she didn't even think the waiter talked to the manager.  She said he went and stood at the top of the stairs for awhile scratching his head and then came back to the table.  I couldn't see as I was facing outside and she was facing the restaurant.  I have to say this was the worst display at a restaurant I have ever seen.

The chocolate cake was fine, but I tried some of the Bananas Foster, which is ice cream and caramelized bananas, and it was absolutely delicious! The amount of food was pretty good as well. The steak was 12 oz. I finished half of my fianc√©e's steak as well, and after the meal I was so full I had to take a 2 hour nap.\\n\\nThe service was also great. Our waiter was prompt about clearing our table, and there was minimal wait between courses.

You have to turn down a street and then wend your way through the plazas and find it tucked away in a strip mall. Prepare to get lost. But persevere, it is so worth it! It's tiny, 7 X 4 tops. The service, however, is the absolute epitome of hospitality. This place is also a miniature Italian grocery packed with goodies from the old country. The food was fresh, interesting, and tasty. I love restaurants where every detail of the food is attended to and delicious. My first night, I had fresh ravioli filled with veal Osso Bucco and topped with both Bolognese and pomodoro sauce.

The bun was nice and fluffy but the lack of flavor really killed anything positive it had going for it. My friend said that her buns needed seasoning as well. Soy milk was also meh.

The pork is cooked to perfection, the chicken is tender and the marinade for the sauce is not intoxicated with Teriyaki sauce but just the right amount of flavor to accentuate the natural flavor of the chicken. The mac salad is unique because its not overbearing with the flavor of mayonaise but I believe they use boiled eggs to bring out the creaminess of it. \\nThe rice is seasoned with the japanese seaweed seasoning over the top and the slice of pineapple is a nice finish to a hearty meal. \\n\\nI'm always a little up in the air about food carts.

The exterior of the building is a strip mall and it does not suggest upscale dining in any way; however, there were several signs directing us to the parking lot in the rear of the building, so I knew we were at the right place.  Walking in the front door, we were stunned at the interior decor - heavy drapes cover the walls, soft candlelight, ad the decor is pleasing and seems very well thought out.  We ate there on a Saturday night, and I called in a reservation two days in advance for 6 PM.  When we got there, the host didn't have our reservation on file!  That's simply unacceptable.  Minus one star.  If you go there, then I suggest making a reservation online through their website, and then call to confirm the reservation a few hours in advance because it seems they can't get their act together.  \\nFortunately, they had a few open tables at 6 so they were able to seat us.  The host took our coats and lead us to a small table in the back.  Before dinner service rally got started, I saw someone who appeared to be the chef mingling with customers at a few other tables - a nice touch, especially at a fine dining establishment.  Plus one star.\\n\\nThe menu is a fusion of Asian and Mediterranean food.  I'm writing this review several weeks after we ate there, so I can't remember what we ate, but we didn't have any complaints about the food.  The wait service was prompt but not intrusive.  The room was filled with quiet conversation most of the night, which is what we were looking for.  Then they seated a loud part of eight at the table next to us.  Now, I know they had to scramble to ge us a table (because they screwed up the reservation) and that the restaurant isn't responsible for the behavior of their guests, but their obnoxious behavior ruined the quiet, romantic atmosphere and almost ruined the night for me.  I would hope that they would seat larger parties in a private room separate from the main dining room, like at many other restaurants in the area.\\n\\nIn short, this restaurant is worth a visit, but confirm your reservation before you set out (if you've made one) and ask for a quiet table if you're going for a romantic evening."},{"name":"Petit Robert Bistro","address":"480 Columbus Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"A nice french restaurant, quiet, classy and simple. \\n\\nexcellent food and service.  will be back."},{"name":"P.

I got their Margherita pizza and a cup of their soup for later. Bad choice. The pizza was so greasy I could barely eat it. I mean I know a pizza is a lot of calories anyway, but I don't like to be reminded of it by the grease. Obviously, this is an express place, but I didn't think that the freshness of ingredients would have to suffer. The soup wasn't much better and upon asking an employee I understood why. Their soups aren't freshly made and are probably flown in with the pizza. My opinion: if you want something fresh, don't eat here...save money by going to Burger King."},{"name":"Urban Farmer","address":"525 SW Morrison St, 8th Fl","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Finally got a chance to try this place! I'd have to say it was pretty tasty! I had the bone-in ribeye steak, caesar salad, and twice baked fingerling potato tart with aged cheddar, bacon, & chives. I am a huge fan of their steak; I'd probably say it's the best I've had in Portland. It was perfectly seasoned, had a nice crust on the outside, and very succulent on the inside. Overall, the food and drinks were great! The only thing I found sort of odd is that the restaurant is set in the atrium on the 8th floor of the Nines Hotel. Most of the tables were about an arms length from each other, so if privacy or intimacy is what you're seeking, this is probably not the place....."},{"name":"Urban Farmer","address":"525 SW Morrison St, 8th Fl","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"I usually write off hotel restaurants as being bad by nature, but this place slapped me upside the head. We googled \\"Best steak house in Portland\\" and on all the websites we looked at, this place had been on all of them and if not the top 2 definitely in the top 5. Once we got there we were taken back by the Atrium, and then into the restaurant which is nestled in the rear of the Atrium you pass through really nice spaces to sit and have cocktails. These spaces were all unique in styles which was very relaxing. The restaurant decor was very well done, loved the bench styles seating. The food was also very good, we ordered the New York steaks with foie gras on top, and the Oregon 1/2 chicken.... all done with very good flavor. I do believe that they need to up the quantity of the Foie Gras they give you, like most restaurants it's small, if you as a patron like it then you willing to pay for it, because obviously you know what the going rate is for it, so up the cost $20 to $40 total and actually do a decent amount of it. All in all great place will definitely come back when I'm in Portland again.

Sorry for asking questions on my first visit I will learn my lesson for next time like not to have a next time. The food was reheated. Its a pet peeve of mine. I was not expecting McDonalds like service. There is a sign on the trailer telling you this is not fast food and don't be impatient good food takes a long time to cook. I wonder when the good food is served because it was not on a Saturday in the middle of the day. The owner could also be heard complaining about customers and the fact that he had to cook. Well thank for feeding me with that attitude. I think it comes through in the taste. Bitter with out any sweetness and lacking on the sharp side. The chicken was extremely dry and in some spots hard. I could not say any better for the tri tip which was then also dunked in the beans of the bowl I ordered which did not fit the description at all the way I envisioned it. The corn bread was taken out of the freezer and I am guessing a combination of microwaved and then thrown onto the propane stove they have going for a couple minutes. So, the outside was kind of burnt and the inside was kind of still frozen. When you are looking for and thinking of good corn bread and this is what you get. You are extremely disappointed. The beans well what can I say about the beans. They seem to be the only item not reheated. They were hot and had some flavor however the overwhelming flavor was sugar. Not honey. Not molasses. Not brown sugar. Just sugar. I should have known not to even order here. When the only thing that everyone at the counter is getting excited about is the sauce in a squeeze bottle you put on yourself. Be warned there is a reason they want you to use so much sauce.

I've been a fan of Kevin Gillespie since Top Chef and always wanted to dine at one of his restaurants. We didn't have reservations but arrived shortly after opening (on a Saturday) and waited at the bar in hopes that something would open up. We'd just received our cocktails when we were told that they had a no show that night and they were ready to seat us.\\n\\nThe one thing I'm not a fan of at Gunshow is the communal tables. It allows them to pack a lot more people in, which to be fair probably contributed to us being able to get in without a reservation. But we were uncomfortably close to the couples on either side of us.\\n\\nThe concept of the restaurant is that although you do get a menu, it's only to let you see what's available for the night. You don't place your order with a server. Instead the food is brought directly to the table and you decide whether or not you want to order it. If you don't take it when they come by, you won't get the option for that dish again later. What I liked was that it gives you a chance to see the food before ordering. There was a scallop dish on the menu that sounded good, but when it came by it wasn't what we were expecting and decided to pass. And vice versa, there was a dish we probably wouldn't have ordered off the menu but looked so good that we grabbed it. The concept does lead to some odd pacing of the meal as we started with a lot off the bat and then had to wait for the other items that interested us. And we ended with potato beignets which normally would seem more appropriate as an appetizer.\\n\\nI won't go specifically into the dishes we ordered because I'm guessing they change regularly, if not daily. But as a whole everything was delicious and we loved all of it. For dessert, they brought out all 3 options on a tray for us to choose from, and it all looked amazing. We got the warm old fashioned banana pudding because I just had to dig into all the fluffy meringue on top. It was incredible and a perfect ending to the meal.\\n\\nWith 4 cocktails, 4 main dishes, and a dessert, the bill including tip came to $138 and we were stuffed. I thought it was a great value considering the quantity, variety and overall quality of everything we ate and drank. At the moment Gunshow tops the list of my favorite restaurants.

I had to tell them that it would be easier to have someone bring the key to us, and after being put on hold for 10 mins did they reluctantly say someone will bring the new room key up (what!?! We're staying at a resort for this type of  service!?) Similarly, service at breakfast was non-existent; waited to be seated bc hostess was off to the side socializing with wait staff, then I had to ask our server 4-5 times to refill coffee/orange juice for our party of 6 and to take plates away. If you are going to charge me 25 dollars per person plus 18% gratuity for breakfast, I expect our drinks to be filled and our table clean.  Valet was pretty terrible as well, it took longer for us to get our car from valet than for our guest to retrieve their car from self parking (which was on the other side of the hotel!).

Simply stated, the contribution that Chef Gillespie is making to the food scene in Atlanta via his brainchild should not be undervalued. In having eaten here twenty plus times, there's never been a bad night. The food is on point every time.

I've had a life changing salad from the adorably monikered Swedish Chef. On NYE we dined on Sole ala Fernand Point that was the literally the best thing I've ever put in my mouth.

It's not a real big place. . .I would describe it as dark and cozy.  It's great that they have a full bar along with beers on tap, and they serve food too.  They girl behind the bar was very nice, and we felt welcome there.  There's nothing particularly special about Hawthorne Public House, but it's a good new option as a place to go for a drink in the neighborhood."},{"name":"Pho Gia","address":"1944 NE Sandy Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"I ordered the udon noodle soup with tofu and \\"crispy\\" veggie spring rolls. The rolls were not crispy--they were just the clear wrapper and not fried, which was not what was indicated on the menu. The soup was not that tasty at all. In fact, the noodles kinda tasted raw? They def needed to be cooked some more. There were maybe five cubes of tofu, very bland, not fried or seasoned. I wouldn't recommend to a fellow vegetarian, frankly.

There were a few instances where it took some time to get in touch with anyone regarding receiving a quote for our wedding cake despite calling during business hours. We finally received a quote and made our deposit for two different flavors for our cake. 2 weeks leading up to our wedding,  communication was great and Lisa was very attentive and had great suggestions.  However, I was informed during this time that the initial quote I received for our cake was off by $35 as the cost for the gold leaf on the design was not taken into account. I was of course OK with paying this as the wedding was so close. \\n\\nOn wedding day the cake arrived on time and was exact what I wanted.  Their design work is amazing. My 2 stars is due  the early poor communication and also the awful taste to the red velvet cake on my wedding day.  The taste of the red velvet the second time around  was much different than the mini cupcake we tested. A few guests thought it was undercooked.  It was doughy and tasteless.  The Italian Cream was  as tasty as we remembered it.  I do not recommend anyone purchase the red velvet cake for your wedding. Don't waste the money. Maybe stick to basic cakes or maybe the Italian Cream because red velvet is not something they do well at least not for weddings.\\n\\n Sweet Treets gets many points for their design work but for actual taste I probably could have made a better tasting cake. In fact, I almost wish I had my aunt or myself make the cake and paid Sweet Treets to do the design work.  Let's just say more than 1/2 of the red velvet cake was thrown away. Thank goodness we had the second flavor and thank goodness I purchased more than 200 cookies from Tiff's Treats as additional desserts or I'd have been so much more disappointed."},{"name":"Casablanca Crepe Taste of Morocco","address":"1610-108 Robson street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"5","text":"If you're hesitant to try this place based on the small number of reviews, don't be.

I opted out of the flour tortilla so it came in a bowl instead. I also added potatoes ($0.49) and guacamole ($1.29) to my order.\\n\\nI wasn't exactly impressed by my meal. The eggs were lukewarm and it didn't help that the salsa and guacamole were chilled. The guacamole had an interesting taste that seemed a little off. It didn't exactly taste very fresh. Perhaps it was left over from the night before? Maybe I just ordered the wrong item at Currito, but I didn't feel the dish came together very well. The beans and potatoes will definitely fill you up though.\\n\\nOn a side note, the owner/server was very friendly and even added a little more salsa to my order without any extra charge.\\n\\nBottom line, there was great service, but the food was lackluster."},{"name":"Bar Congress","address":"200 Congress Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I started with the Manhattan 13, which was strong.

I realized that if I wanted to leave satiated, I'd better get something substantial, so I went for the burger, a bit steeply priced at $14 but good.

This is delicious choice meat (short rib, brisket, and chuck), and if you know your food, you can see that it makes a noticeable difference in taste.

Leave that alone. And y'all need to clean up these toys too, it's a hazard.\\" What?! We were literally the only ones out there for over an hour! What do you think pets will do on your patio?! More than just run their hot wheels in the dirt! He could have addressed it politely with us-the adults! Not our 2 preschoolers! Meanwhile the only  2 other couples outside, left! Because they waited but were never served! Good thing they left because nobody ever came out to check on them to even realize they were gone! They were busy inside but it seemed like they were relatives of the owners. So it's up to you but on a Friday night during happy hour, I'd expect more preparation for the 1 family outside!!

They call it shaved steak, and I think that's a fair description... it's not that third rate gristle you get in low-end pizza joints, or the steak-tip concoctions that taste good but are NOT cheesesteaks. \\n\\nThe tenders are good, although alone there are plenty of wing/tender places in the world, this place holds its own. Oh yeah, I also snagged a Tuna Melt Paninni (Tuna Meltini) and that was also really good. Someone else here mentioned that it was messy, which is true... but I'm yet to eat a good and tidy tuna melt.

I appreciate that they have some affordable wines, I like that it's not downtown, and I am (theoretically) always drawn to a place that offers happy hour. But it has never come together for me.\\n\\nFor one thing, it's dark in a weird/unsettling way. I'm all for a low-lit restaurant now and then, but this is like college apartment dark, because there's only windows at the front of a relatively long, narrow rectangle. I like that you can get up and pick your wines (what? I pick wines based on their label art. Don't even play like you don't do this) from the wall display, but it's kind of overwhelming!\\n\\nOn that note, the wines are various in both style and origin, and pretty good overall. I'm no wine snob, but I can say categorically that these are better than Boone's Farm. The markup here is perhaps less than other wine bars, but I'm always frustrated by the fact that I can buy many of the same bottles at my local grocery store for 1/3 the price.\\n\\nThe location, when it's not crowded, is good. But it's really no better than downtown when this area is crowded, because even their lot fills up quickly and you still have to park down the street. So the location advantage is small.\\n\\nThe happy hour is a disappointment. First of all, 5:30 to 7? why not 5 to 7? why not 5:30 to 7:30? What is this, Uchiko? The only discount on wines is $2 off by-the-glass wine. In my opinion, the whole point of coming here is for the bottles, so that's pretty much worthless. The food happy hour is extremely stingy. 'Select appetizers' (Read: the cheap, easy-to-make ones) are half off.The calamari is chewy in a bad way. The mussels went from okay sometime last year to pretty bad in recent months, and the bread they serve for the mussel broth keeps coming in smaller and smaller portions. I'm sorry, but a 3-inch segment of baguette is not going to suffice for a 4-top! Sheesh. The cheese plate suffers from the same lack of carb-based delivery vehicles as the mussels. I have always been so disappointed after appetizers that I haven't wanted to order entrees, and the prices are a little high for the entrees anyway. \\n\\nMost of my friends that insist on going here for happy (um, sad?) hour have moved away.

Perhaps it was because I was more in the mood for it but everything that we had was delicious.\\n\\nWe started with the duck scallion pancake which I LOVED.  My boyfriend however, was not a big fan...but that wasn't because it wasn't good, it's because he doesn't particularly like onions and just got it to share with me since we were celebrating my birthday dinner.  We also got a small plate of chicken dumplings which he enjoyed a lot.  For our salad course, we split the beef Carpaccio which was fresh and light.  I enjoyed how they split the salad for us prior to bringing it out.\\n\\nFor dinner, I got the bang-bang shrimp which was flavorful and filling.  It came with four huge pieces of shrimp and a wonderful rice and vegetable medley.  My boyfriend tried the carbonara which he said was good...but a little too creamy for his liking.  I think he liked mine a bit better and had what I like to call \\"order envy\\".\\n\\nWe had a few of the specialty cocktails as well...a coconut, mint and rum concoction as well as a fresh watermelon margarita.

It took us more than 10 minutes to get silverware and menus. It took another 10 to get a glass of water and another 10 to place an order. If they were busy, I might be a bit more sympathetic, but we watched as people stood around and did nothing. A bus boy actually noticed us blankly staring around the place.\\n\\nOur server never checked in on us with the exception of taking our food order and bringing/taking the check. She was neither friendly or attentive.\\n\\nI'm an enormous fan of Rosebud's shrimp and grits. It's the only thing I order there and I'd confidently put it in a top 5 dishes in Atlanta list. So when I saw shrimp and grits on the menu I was comforted, since that's what I was in the mood for anyways. There were only three shrimp in there in that bowl. Shocked by the measly number of shrimp, I was also surprised they were fried  as that application doesn't really lend itself to shrimp and grits but I wasn't turned off by the idea. I was turned off by the rubbery overcooked doneness.\\n\\nGirlfriend got the waffle sliders. I don't know what happened in the kitchen, but the waffle batter was acrid. It's was completely bitter/sour rendering the waffles inedible. Had someone ever checked on us, this might have been the one time I sent something back.

The salmon salad barely had anything on it other than greens. I can't believe i spent $50 on this meal and everything came back all wrong and not how i wanted it.

The biggest complaint I had here was the amount of time we spent waiting around between dishes.

After shopping our asses off, we were starved, and looking to try some real BBQ. We rolled up to an authentic southern style BBQ joint that our GPS recommended, only to find it closed.  As we were trying to find our way back to our hotel, we stumbled across Famous Dave's and decided to give it a whirl.  I had never heard of it, didn't realize it was a chain (once I got home I learned there was one across town from me in Tucson, where I was living at the time, I just hadn't noticed!).  Maybe it was because we were on vacation, maybe it was because we were deliriously hungry, but it was one amazing meal. I've been a fan ever since, and was excited to find one had sprouted in the metro area when I moved back. \\n\\nLet me preface this: I'm not a BBQ connoisseur. I don't have any real southern experiences to compare to.  I just like food.  I'm a fan of FD's Georgia Chopped Pork - which is sometimes pulled instead of chopped, but it still hits the spot.  I recently tried the tri-tip for the first time, and it was a little tougher than I'd expected, but still full of flavor.  Their ribs are supremely tasty - and I'm not normally a fan of ribs.  I like their choices of sides - I love the drunken apples, mashed potatoes, mac and cheese (with a jalapeno kick), and damn, those simple green beans are mega-yum.  I could eat a dozen of those cornbread muffins - the perfect level of sweetness.  I think they've got a nice variety of sauces, but normally go heavy on the Rich 'n' Sassy.   \\n\\nI agree their prices are a bit high, but I always have enough left for lunch the next day, and the husband always leaves full (which isn't always the case at other places).  I think the combos are a decent value, as you can try several different meats with the muffin and 2 sides.  They range $16-$21ish.  Their BBQ sandwiches and burgers seem very on-par with other restaurants in the area - $10 or so, including sides.  Not bad. \\n\\nWhat I don't like: their entrance. The front door faces the street, around the corner from the parking lot.  I seem to only visit when it's raining, and I hate having to park and walk alllllll the way around the building in the rain - there isn't even an awning, even at the door area.  I always get soaked.  Come on Dave - its Oregon!  They also took the catfish off the menu as an entree, which was one of my all-time faves, and replaced it with cod.  Again, this is Oregon, I can get that anywhere.  Super mega sad face.  \\n\\nAll in all, I am definitely a fan of the FD. It's not in our 'hood, so we usually only visit during our birthdays, when we have our BOGO coupon from their email club.  Sign-up, you'll get one too."},{"name":"Nud Pob Thai Cuisine","address":"738 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Mediocre at best. The portion is pretty much the only redeeming factor. \\n\\nI ordered the Chang Mai curry noodles and the Tod Mun minced shrimp appetizers. It tasted basically like overly salted shrimp McNuggets (McShrimpets?). So was the Chang Mai noodles; it came with a heavily spiced and salted thin curry broth and skinny yellow noodles, garnished with a few pieces of onion and pickled vegetable. The broth was way too overwhelming in an unsubstantiated way, as in MSG-laden rather than flavorful. \\n\\nI've had better Chang Mai at Sugar and Spice in Porter, and that place is a solid 3. \\n\\nOh, while Espresso Royale next door is closed for renovation, Nud Pob does offer a decent Thai iced coffee. It tastes like a mild Vietnamese coffee, which is pleasant.

Great good, service, and people. It's interesting that as I read some of the reviews, as expected, there were some not so good reviews but one in particular stood out! In response to that particular one, no one has displayed ANY kind of racist behavior... Everyone's very kind and friendly and very helpful. There is not a hostess stand so the employees grab you as they can when you walk in the door! I work in the service industry and at no point is it ok for one guest to ask another guest to move out of their current seat to accommodate them and their larger party as if they're more important... Unfortunately, reviews like this leave a lasting impression on others, but the fact that you have nothing nice to say about any restaurant in the complex might mean that it's not the restaurants that are not accommodating and nice, if you get my drift... Sometimes we have to evaluate what we may be doing to get the same results... Overall this a local tavern where people will remember you and welcome you!

But my recent experience at Babs was just SOOO BAD that 1 is the only appropriate rating. \\n\\nOkay, so it's day 2 of my friend visiting. This time I'm like, \\"hey, lets try a breakfast spot, I heard Babs is super delish\\". So, we take a stroll down Juniper, and find it nestled in a corner/on the side, right past Mu-lan and that other restaurant. It's easy to miss, so be sure to keep your eye out for the sign. We go in, the guy tells us we can sit wherever-- there's only 2 other people in there.  (It's about 1:20ish)\\n\\nSo cool, we sit down and get the menus. We're in breakfast mode, he tells us the specials, and we both nod, attentively listen, smile, yanno we give him ad-lib \\"oo-aww\\" \\"that sounds good\\" \\"mmm\\" etc. He leaves, we go through the menu... hmm, no true to heart breakfast stuff, ok yea there's eggs and what not, but no waffles, pancakes, or french toast.\\n\\nHe comes back over, we explain to him that we're in the breakfast mood. In a sort snarky way he says \\"Sorry, we don't have breakfast, that's only on the weekends\\" \\"I can bring you the brunch menu.\\"  So, I'm thinking he has an attitude and doesn't want us to eat breakfast items, but will go ahead and bring us the menu so that we can order from that. He brings it to us and repeats that brunch is ONLY on the weekends, but that they have other stuff AKA 'here's the menu to look at, but you can't order anything off it.'\\n\\nMy friend wanted to leave, but I'm like let's just stay and order something small. It can be our appetizer to the place we'll actually go eat at. He comes back over we explain that we really did want breakfast, but since we've heard such great things, we want to try something. And that's when the rant began.. Nothing BUT attitude. Passive aggressive attitude.\\n\\nSERVER GUY: \\"Well, I mean y'all can just leave I won't be offended\\"\\nMY FRIEND AND I (PATRONS): \\"Oh no, we understand, but we've heard such great things about Babs, so we wanted to at least try something since we're here\\"\\nSERVER: \\"Don't think you have to stay just because I brought you water\\"\\nFRIEND AND I: \\"Yea, we understand, and we did want breakfast, but we'll still try something\\"\\nSERVER: I don't know where you're gonna get breakfast at this time of day anyway, but there's a IHOP down the street\\"\\n\\n*screetch* (step on the brakes) Did this fool say that THE ONLY breakfast spot open in Atlanta right now is the IHOP off Ponce?! Are you brand new to the A? Or do you just think we're not from here so you can just make reckless comments like that? Either way that comment alone REQUIRED a negative yelp review. \\n\\nDespite his attitude, we decided to order the sweet potato fries. The sauce wasn't too complimentary, but the fries were very tasty  (the 1 star on the rating). We eat, drink a little of the disgusting tap water (worst restaurant water ever, smelled like it came from the toilet). Then left. We should have NOT tipped, but we did. Fries were just $4 we gave him like $7. So pretty much a 75% tip, but whatevs... my friend just gave what he had in his pocket. \\n\\nSUMMARY:\\n1.) You close at 3PM. 3PM!! So for u to be mad & give me attitude for wanting breakfast/brunch is bananas, like straight rachel zoe \\"BA-NA-NAS\\". It's crazy!  You're in the freaking breakfast brunch category for goodness sakes. Its pretty much the MAIN reason people come to u. Don't give me attitude for wanting that!\\n\\n2.) The fact that you showed me a menu that has waffles on it, MEANS you have the ability to not just make waffles, but pancakes too. Sure it's not Saturday or Sunday, but there's literally, like LI-TE-RA-LLY 4 people in this restaurant and 2 have already finished their meal. You can make us some effin waffles if you want. I mean, wtf happened to customer service?! You have a waffle maker in the back, and it does not take much to whip up a small batter. BUT NO. BABS, THE BRUNCH & BREAKFAST PLACE, *ONLY* MAKES BREAKFAST ON WEEKENDS, ONLY 2 DAYS-- SATURDAY & SUNDAY. How dare they tell us such foolishness, you betta get in the back and make my waffles!\\n\\n3.) IHOP?! Really. The server/front man/possibly owner at Babs tells me that IHOP is the ONLY place at 1:40PM that I can get breakfast. I'm just hoping that you're blissfully ignorant, otherwise... what a douchy thing to say. And just FYI, let me tell you a few places I can get breakfast on a Tuesday afternoon in Atlanta, Ga sir:\\n\\n- Let's just start w/ the basics: The Majestic (24 hours) & The Silver Skillet. Sound familiar? They've only been here since, idk, like FOREVER!\\n\\nNow I'll go into places that are BETTER than Babs, definitely better ambience and service: \\n- Ria's Bluebird \\n- West Egg Cafe \\n- Thumbs Up Diner \\n- Highland Bakery\\n- I mean do you not realize The Flying Biscuit is within walking distance of you?! I basically walked passed it coming here. \\n\\nAnd that's just a few.\\n\\nBasically...

The evening started out very well...prices are a little high for what you receive, but service was good, staff was caring and drinks, appetizer and entrees arrived nicely timed.  My friends ordered escargot and they said the dish was extremely good and well-presented.   The steaks that the men ordered were quite different in size, though they ordered the same steak, and one was nearly raw, though that was not what was ordered.   Crab legs were ordered and my friend was quite happy with them.  I ordered the sea scallops and was disappointed....4 and one-half (??) scallops for $32.00?  I'm sorry, but Fogo de Chao is a much better restaurant if you want a great evening out, have high quality food,  and are going to spend this kind of money.  \\n\\nService was excellent until a very large party came in, and I am very understanding of the demands placed upon a restaurant when a large party comes in.  After that, the evening went downhill, however.  We felt pressured into dessert, ordered espresso, coffee for our friends, desserts, everything came out ill-timed, coffee was fine and refilled, but our espresso was lukewarm.  One dessert came out, ten minutes later the other one came out.  The espresso was gone, it would have been so nice to have that with the dessert.  Again, we are very understanding about the demands that a large party places upon a restaurant, and it seemed that the kitchen just wasn't able to keep up.

So with expectations being low, we decided after 3 weeks to try  Weeyums based off of Yelp reviews and conveniency. To our surprise, our philly style steak  & cheese, mayo, onions was super tasteful, cheesy and well seasoned. The soft sub was full of meat, cheese and just enough of grease. \\nAs far as the service is concerned, the staff seemed very polite and had put our sandwich together just as we walked through the door (20 minutes after initial call). \\nIt's nice to know I have a place to write home about.

It's a professional atmosphere and they make some really great food. \\n\\nI went to UMass for undergrad and this place reminds me so much of the dining commons. \\n\\nFor breakfast, they have amazing omelets, pretty good breakfast sandwiches, and a fruit & yogurt bar. They also have pastries and bagels. \\n\\nWhen I am looking for a substantial lunch I head to The Blue Glass. They've switched around their lunch set-up a little recently,so sushi, the main meal, and salads are all by the pound. I personally prefer a hot lunch to a sandwich 9 times out of 10. If you're looking for a gourmet, hot lunch, like mom would make, this is the place to go. They constantly have pork, chicken, turkey, beef and sides like couscous, orzo pasta, potatoes, and yummy vegetable mixes cooked just right. \\n\\nYour lunch options here are, sandwich, soup, salad, main meal, pho, or sushi. \\n\\nTheir sandwiches are slightly lacking and don't compete with other cafes in the area. Their Pho as well, wasn't my favorite. I would recommend getting a curry broth if they don't already have it. \\n\\nAs for snacks and beverages. They have a lot of different earthy crunchy varieties of chips, power bars, and drinks.

She seemed to like the other things that were with it as well. \\n\\nDecor: It is in the former engine room of Southern Dairies so it has high ceilings and was a little industrial but they managed to warm things up. My one thing about the decor was that while the light coming from behind the bench seating looked nice, you could see the bare bulbs fairly easily when sitting there so finishing that off might look a little better.\\n\\nDress code: It's listed as dressy, but as normal in Atlanta, there were people there wearing golf shirts like they were out for a night at Chili's. \\nMost people were dressed business casual with a few people really, decked out (evening gown type dress and guy in a suit and tie). \\n\\nOverall, it was a nice experience and I would go back again and try some of the other things on the menu."},{"name":"Counter Cafe East","address":"1914 E 6th St, Ste A","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Stopped for brunch.

I wasn't a huge fan of it the last time I went, but I thought I would give it another shot. Sadly, this time was about the same. \\n\\nCharlie's is a fairly average bar. It has a decent beer selection, fairly OK mixed drinks, average food, and standard prices. I think it is supposed to be considered a casual, unpretentious, dive bar. But to be honest, the ambiance seemed really forced. It seemed to be one of those places that is only a dive bar because dive bars are hip and trendy with the college age crowd. To me, Charlie's came across as being snobby about the fact that is was so casual. Like the place is pretentious about being unpretentious. If that makes any sense. \\n\\nI got this feeling based on the fact that: A) The servers and bartenders were all fairly rude and spoke to me as if I were wasting their time B) Most of the patrons of the bar were pretentious and rude and C) when I went outside for a smoke at 9pm (which took almost ten minutes to get from my seat to the door because the place was filled well past fire regulations {which I know because they had the max capacity listed on the wall next to the door}) there was a very long line of people at the door who were all complaining about having to wait to get in. \\n\\nAs a bar, Charlie's is definitely decent. But it is no where near being good enough to have to deal with the amount of crap that goes with trying to enjoy a drink there.

We arrived just before 7:30 and were \\"greeted\\" by two managers in a yelling match about who's responsiblilty it is to seat guests and who's it is to serve wine. I was shocked to hear (not sure his name, call him Froddo Baggins,hes very short) say that it was his job to pick wines, not to seat tables. IMHO as a restaurant business owner, the management should do everything it takes to reach success...everyone pitches in. We made our way past the scuffle and had to wait for seats at the bar. While waiting, two other managers were fighting about the same thing, two different managers one foreign and one shorter with curly hair. Some professional restraint would be nice. \\n\\nThe taller bartender Kevin took very good care of us once we got two seats at the first floor bar. He suggested the dry aged ny strip for my wife and she loved it! I had the hand harvested scallops, my choice, and they were terrible.

A few of us went downstairs for after-dinner drinks and we interrupted by the waitress Nina who waited on us upstairs. She was literally whining to the foreign manager to try the wines that we paid for. She had arms full of wine bottles and wanted to \\"try\\" them all. It seems she didn't offer us a take home wine bag so that she could drink all of our leftover wine on her own. That manager told her no and she raised her high-pitched voice and was practically yelling at him (in her best Roseanne Barr impersation...she nailed it).

The waitress said they couldn't take any special orders because they were so busy (the indoor section was half full) and I could get a side of spinach.  I let it slide and ordered the side, which was just saut√©ed spinach in oil (not even seasoned).  It was fine, but I would've preferred it I'm the omelette so it wasn't so greasy.  Fast forward to us getting the bill (after asking two people three times for it), and they charged us $8 DOLLARS for the side of spinach on top of the cost of the omelette.  It was straight out of an episode of Kitchen Nightmares. Apparently not only is the customer not always right, but you can charge them an arm and a leg when they make special requests.  We will not be back."},{"name":"Fellini's Pizza","address":"1991 Howell Mill Rd NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Normally get pizza here but ordered 40 minutes ago, when quoted a 20 minute wait, waited an additional 20 minutes and picked up a pizza that was burnt, so when I asked to trade this out, they immediately quoted me another 30 MINUTES!

A very cool environment to hang out in, if you appreciate modern aesthetics (we do!)\\n\\n2.) The Happy Hour food and drink were very good and inexpensive. Our service was good, but we sat in the actual restaurant, not lobby. We will definitely go back for Happy Hour again.\\n\\n3.) Dinner at the Urban Farmer was fine...but just not fantastic vis a vis their price point. We don't mind splurging on amazing food, but this food was just...fine. And you can get ok food ALOT of places here in Portland for 1/5 the price of their steaks, apps, etc.  \\n\\nFor another thing, several of the cool novelties other reviewers mention (such as a box of steak knives to choose from) are no longer present. Our food server told us they stopped doing that because people were stealing them. Man, a few really lame people ruin everything. Which brings me to the next point.\\n\\n4.) As the day progresses, this place turns into--not only a meat market, but a wanna-be-hipster/hoochie hangout. Sorry, but it's true.

Not at all in a cool-'Portland 'way either. \\n\\n(We walked into The Library to hear a loud conversation between two caucasian dudes bragging to two African American guys about 'how they  haven't dated white women in ages and how they hear that the hot women are in Arizona.' ?????????????????? After walking out of that room and on the way to the elevator, a different pig congratulated a passing bride and groom and loudly commented that he would happily join a threesome back in their room.) \\n\\nMy husband and I agreed (and we're early 30's and not totally uncool) that it reminded us in a very yucky way of L.A.

When you go to leave the venue and there is literally no food left, you know you had a successful choice. The staff was also well equipped to serve up drinks and keep everything refreshed.

Well looks like Cabo Bob's hopped onto that\\nlist because they have some really awesome deals: BOGO burritos\\noccasionally, taco +chips combos, food item + drinks...yesterday I got\\n3 fish tacos and a drink for $5.49. That's right with tax that's under\\n$6. It's not like Cabo Bob's was pricey to begin with (always been\\naffordable and filling) but getting a drink thrown in for that really\\njust puts it over the top.\\n\\nFuel for the journey eh?

How do you pass up on eating at a steakhouse called \\"Moo...\\"? Luckily, I went on a Monday night when they have a Prix Fixe for 35 bucks. It came with a bowl of soup/salad, an entree, a side dish, dessert. I opted for the Clam Chowder (got to try New England Clam Chowder), 12 oz New York Strip, Saluted Mushrooms, and the Ice Cream Sundae. Holy Cow! The Clam Chowder was nothing I've ever tasted. It had a generous portion of sweet, delicious whole clams. It tasted so fresh and not over cooked. The New York Steak was a little tough and slightly bland, but I think that was my fault. It's served with \\"Bone Marrow Butter\\", which came in a piece of bone. It wasn't until I finished 99% of my steak when I realized that bone was part of the meal and not just garish. The Saluted Mushrooms are done in a Bourbon butter and  finished in the oven.  I'm glad they weren't playing music, because I was so drunk after finishing the mushrooms that I probably would have been kicked out for stripping and dancing on the tables. The sundae was a cool concept. It was stacked like a chocolate smores, with homemade marshmallow. It was pretty sweet, but the smaller portion made it alright. Overall I'm glad I went into the restaurant. I was a little intimated by the fancy decor and the high prices, but the Sunday/Monday Prix Fixe allowed me to enjoy their food without breakin' the piggy bank. \\n\\nA little about my credentials:\\nI first got into cooking & food when I was in college. After being rejected by numerous girls and getting zero action, I decided it was time for a change. I needed a new makeover to boost my geeky, engineering image. I applied for a cooking position at a Mediterranean-Italian  Restaurant near my home and learned to cook all sorts of pastas and dishes.

Okay bread, not great, and somehow I expected pita bread. At no point were we presented with utensils (customary, apparently), so we ate everything with our hands and the bread. Pita would have made things much less messy.\\n\\nNext was a Moroccan salad with diced vegetables which tasted fresh, but were difficult to eat.

Served with caramelized onions, a perfect compliment to a juicy steak. \\n\\nWe shared truffled tots as a side. These were amazing. So hot and tender. They melt in your mouth and will be hard to stop eating if you like truffled flavor. \\n\\nShared creme brulee as desert. Vanilla flavor. A nice way to end a rich meal. Paired with madeira.\\n\\nOverall if you are looking for a great steak and wine this is your place. It is expensive but consistent. The service is attentive and friendly without being too in your face."},{"name":"Coopers Hall","address":"404 SE 6th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Great venue, large selection of wine, service was pleasant.

Everyone should try it at least once!\\n\\nThey have a good variety of dishes to choose from...you pick 5 entrees: one from each category (pork, beef, chicken, seafood, veggies) and it comes with white rice, spring rolls, longganisa (sweet sausage), and plaintain bananas & halo-halo for dessert. The food was super good and a lot of fun to enjoy & share together. They prepare waaaaay more food than the number of people you book, so we had tons of leftovers for everyone! Everyone was incredibly accommodating and service was attentive, they even came to our table afterwards to chat & make sure we were satisfied with everything.\\n\\nMy only criticism is that the halo-halo was pretty underwhelming, and they charge quite a bit for children. Their website says that all kids under 10 are $15 each (no exceptions), which is more than half the price of an adult. We had a 4 year old and a 1 year old attending, so I really  felt that I had to ask about the 1 year old...but thankfully they said that he's free. It's still kinda pricey for a 4 year old, it's not like they really have to prepare THAT much more food...so I had to take one star away for that.

She asks if I'm ready to order and as I start to run my finger down the menu, she walks off AGAIN!  Comes back and says she'll be right with me only to busy herself with busing dishes behind the counter.  Really?  That couldn't have waited the 30 seconds it would have taken to take my order?  I get the same thing every time so I knew what I wanted when I walked in and at this point, I'd been waiting to order for over 30 minutes.

The delivery of the food felt like death by a thousand paper cuts;\\n- I saw the owner wandering the floor and politely approached her, and said EXACTLY the following, \\"I have to tell you, I've eaten here for over 20 years, and today has been the worst service ever...\\".   The owner/manager proceeds to yell at me how today is crazy because of take out orders and in a hostile tone replies, \\"I've already apologized...\\".   I was left befuddled thinking who the heck did she speak to (maybe we all look the same :)).  Apologized to who?  She had never spoken to me anytime prior.  She then tries to explain how they have stations in the kitchen and depending on what we ordered things are made at different times.   She didn't even bother to ask nor care about the fact that both my sister and I ordered exactly the same dry noodles.  Why did mine come out well before hers?\\n- the owner then comes over to our table singling out my sister that she didn't like my sister pointing at her.   Let me remind you, my sister was like me dumbfounded because she was minding her own business with her back turned to the earlier conversation I had had with the owner.  The owner proceeded to scold us more to not point at her.   The experience was classless, bizarre, odd...you name it.   It was like someone was playing a practical joke.  No one had pointed at her period, but surely now everyone knows what ticks her off.\\n- the waitstaff...see for yourself.   Just RUDE.   They need an interpersonal training class.\\n\\nThe food.   No love.   Sloppy presentation.  Mushy chicken wings, but flavor good.  Be prepared to fall asleep on your couch within one hour after eating from the MSG induced nap.\\n\\nTo owner and staff.

Ok, so....I've been going to cappa's for almost 2 years. Why would I go to a place that I've given 1 star? Well the answer is this... It is kind of hard to find good breakfast in the area and when we found cappa's we thought the food was good and gave up searching. The food at cappa's is pretty good which is the main reason we overlooked the cleanliness, and service... The place is not that clean, that brings it down from 5 to 4. The food is actually good, but just enough to put this place at 3 stars....now, the juicy part... The whole time we came here the service was crap.

Some other people come in she goes up to them and asks then how many, they say oh he was here first i say I've been here for 20+ minutes and she says oh I didn't see your party so she gave my table away. I'm like yeah my party is here they live 2 seconds away (they were actually parking).  Long story long she wanted me to wait another 20 mins i said no thank you and she practically kicked me out.

Salad and soup are serve yourself, but you go to the kitchen for seconds of the entree. We were there on Guatemalan night, so there were beans and rice and a corn tortilla taco with uninspiring mushroomy filling. The desserts looked good but we skipped it in favor of getting a glass of wine elsewhere. One whole star docked for not being able to even bring in your own wine.

This is a review of my Birthday dinner, we attended as a family of 4, two kids under 10. I've been to The Melting Pot several times, in 2 other states. This was my first inexcusably unpleasant experience. My husband was a chef for 12 years...we've had Taco Bell experiences that far surpassed this. \\n\\nAmbiance: Dimly lit is nice, this place was overly dark. Possibly, to mask the misaligned cooktops on our table which gave our table a haphazard look. \\n\\nService: The waitstaff did the best they could with what they were working with. I do not understand why we were seated next to a couple, obviously on a date while only 1 other booth in the room was occupied. While our kids are well behaved, we felt bad for the couple next to us...we didn't want to intrude.\\nAt one point, we spoke to the \\"manager of the night\\". Who gave us a wide eyes, tight lips, and a couple of nods, and a single \\"I'm sorry about that\\" without offering an excuse or explanation for any of what we were presented with. He left and never returned to the table. \\n\\nAppetizer: We started with the Cheddar Cheese Fondue. We watched the items go into the pot, there was cheddar...but NO Emmenthaler Swiss anywhere in sight. It was omitted, we did not complain, the cheddar alone was tasty. We were presented with a small bowl of veggies that were to be \\"seasonal\\". We got what looked like the contents of a bag of grocery store cauliflower/broccoli/carrot mix, they were obviously not freshly prepped and served to us in a ramekin, the vessel used to serve sauces. Other photos show bowls, we did not get a bowl. Upon close inspection (dim lights made it difficult), I found my cauliflower to be blemished...as if it spent too many days in the fridge. We bought 3 portions. We got 1 bowl of bread and 1 ramekin each of veggies and Granny Smith apples. \\n\\nMain Course: Spinach and Artichoke Ravioli. Two of two servings of quarter-sized ravioli came out to our table with frozen centers, a couple showing evidence of freezer burn. Our kids were hungry...we had no choice but to cook one portion. The waiter agreed that it was \\"unacceptable\\" to serve frozen pasta. He brought out a plate of thawed pasta. The 'manager of the night' said that they always come out cold, he shrugged his shoulders when we said they were frozen. That was the last we saw of him. I ordered the Bourguignonne and Pacific White Shrimp, presented to me with a bowl of vegetables. The vegetables were button mushrooms/broccoli/potatoes. I have never been offered a quartered, raw, potato to be cooked in tempura. Absurd. The tempura batter was thick, heavy, and ORANGE! The antithesis of Tempura. It took so long to cook the batter, the veggies just absorbed the oil and still, after submerging 3 times, the batter was raw within the broccoli. I gave up. My broccoli was mostly stalk...the mushrooms were ok. The sesame batter was not quite as thick as the tempura, and better tasting, but still thick. I tried the Ginger Plum Sauce, which is boasted to be \\"Our own unique recipe with red and green bell peppers, ginger and just a hint of plum\\". It is from a bottle, a taste I recognized instantly, because I've purchased that bottle for use at home. The waiter confirmed that it is bottled. Disappointment. We did not venture to try the curry and teriyaki sauces, expecting the worst. \\n\\nI have never bailed on a dinner before. I have never felt like it would be better to leave and order a pizza from somewhere. We skipped dessert and asked for our check. Our waiter took one ravioli order off of the check and apologized, he got a good tip, poor guy has a mess of an operation to smooth over and no support from his superior. We apologized to our kids..the night was a bust. Never again."},{"name":"Phnom Penh","address":"244 E Georgia Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Last night I finally got around to trying Phnom Penh. I heard many great things about this place over the years and I couldn't believe I hadn't been here till last night.\\n\\nFirst off I'd like to say the line is really long. It made me question what was so great about it for people to want to wait an hour just to be seated. Fortunately enough I had reservations so it was fine. This place only takes reservations of 6 and more so if you really do want to try this place, please find 5-6 friends.\\n\\nOriginally I heard that Indochine and Phnom Penh are owned by the same people. Indochine is like Phnom Penh with the bar atmosphere and much less people therefore it is less crowed with good music. Now, I've tried Indochine and they also have the infamous chicken wings, butter beef, as well as their beef luc lac. So, coming to Phnom Penh I honestly wasn't expecting much. Customer service definitely lacks here because the lady that had seated us was just yelling left and right.\\n\\nNow let's talk about the food. We only ordered the butter beef, chicken wings, beef luc lac, and beef pho. I've seen butter beef being made from scratch before and with the way Phnom Penh made it, you can tell the meat had been sitting in the sauce for quite some time for the meat to have been that done already around the edges. The butter beef has to be a no from me and I think it's honestly better at Indochine and from the person I watched make it. The beef pho I did not order however my friend's boyfriend ordered it and he mentioned how it was good however it was not the best. The beef luc lac was definitely one of my favourites, it goes with the rice perfectly with the side of egg however it is not something I would crave nor would it be worth waiting an hour in line for. As for the chicken wings, I am not a fan of the pepper and lemon dipping sauce simply because I don't like pepper and I think the lemon gives off too sour of a taste for me to enjoy. The chicken wings to me were best left untouched. Super crispy with a hint of sweetness, although they are definitely not the best wings I've ever had.\\n\\nAll in all, great place in Chinatown for food. Definitely come earlier if you wish to experience the food here too, but I don't see myself coming again for a long time. I can get all the items except pho at Indochine if I really wanted to, with a pitcher on the side. However neither places would be my ideal go to spot.

We were attempting to put salt and pepper on it because of how bland they were.

I go here at least once per week and get the same thing each time: the Chickenburger combo. \\n\\nThere are so many things I love about P.Terry's. I love that it's local food, and that they treat their employees well. On average, employees at P. Terry's rake in $11/hour. Not your average McDonald's, huh? The food is also organic, so although it isn't exactly 'healthy', you don't feel like a greasy behemoth after finishing a combo. What's more is that you get A LOT of food for a reasonably small price tag. The Chickenburger combo is $6.44 (which includes tax), and you get at least 25% more food than you would get paying the same amount at a typical fast food establishment. \\n\\nThe ONLY negative is that fresh food = long wait. I work 9-6, so when I get off of work and feel like some P. Terry's, I end up waiting at least 30 minutes in line at the drive-thru. The walk-up window isn't much better, unfortunately. They make all of their food fresh on the spot, so at least there's a reasonable explanation. Still, don't go to P. Terry's if you're in a rush.   \\n\\nThat's all.

We went on a Wednesday night, and despite the day, I couldn't believe how many old-ass people were there. Not really the crowd I was expecting.\\n\\nWe were seated at a two-person booth, which seemed intimate at first glance. But the table was too long to really lean in for conversation. I felt isolated from the person I came to dote over.\\n\\nWe ordered cocktails, nothing signature, just a vodka tonic and a Jack and Coke. Amazing. Granted, they're bar stand-bys, but whoever was behind the bar knew what they were doing. Refreshing, strong, fairly good size, if not a bit on the small side.\\n\\nWe each decided to smart with the small plates from the regular menu. I ordered the heirloom tomato salad, and my girlfriend ordered the field greens with beets. Both were tremendous. A great, bold start to the meal. My heirloom tomatoes were pretty much perfect. The melon sorbet perfectly countered the savory shaved cheese, but also rounded out the acidity of the tomato. Great start.\\n\\nMy girlfriends field greens were well dressed. The beats were creamy and fresh, and the cheese (whatever it was) was perfect. A nice, upscale take on the traditional beet salad. She loved it.\\n\\nThe bread comes. It's as good as people say. There's a couple sour dough rolls, and a couple sweet rolls. Crispy, flaky crust. Amazing,  Best restaurant bread I think I've ever had. \\n\\nBut that doesn't really make the meal, does it?\\n\\nI order the club steak on the daily menu. Medium. My girlfriend orders the salmon. Rare as possible.\\n\\nWe wait. And wait a bit more. probably a good 40 or so minutes. The first small plates and bread were paced perfectly, but the gap between that and our meals was a bit too long.\\n\\nThe meals come out. And, even given the 4th and Swift's M.O., I was a bit shocked at the portion sizes. Wussy. Even for fancy-pants, farm-to-table spot like this.\\n\\nIt's pretty clear our meals were overcooked. My steak, although flavorful was dry and chewy. The asparagus was bland. My potatoes were ok, but nothing special. My girlfriend's salmon was unseasoned, overcooked, and just boring. Her clam chowder reduction was laughable.\\n\\nWe felt the small plates were very well thought out. The large plates left us wanting a second meal somewhere else.

All the prices are suggested so if you have more or less money you pay what you think is a fair price.

There are some things I really love, and somethings I just, well, don't\\n     One thing Fellini's seems to lack for me is consistency.  One day I get great pizza, the next, it's \\"meh\\" at best.  Sometimes it's over-sauced, sometimes it's undercooked, sometimes it's perfect.  \\n     I have learned to stay away from the slices.  They seem to just be slices of pre-made cheese pizza with your choice of toppings piled on top, then extra cheese piled on top of that, which is then thrown in the oven for just long enough to melt the cheese.  I have no problem at all with premade slices of cheese, but I *do* have a problem with barely melted cheese on pizza.  For whatever reason, I'm completely grossed out by it; I want my cheese browned!\\n    The salads and the white pizza, however, are consistently delicious.  I especially love the salad, topped with thick, long shreds of mozzarella and creamy Italian dressing. Yeah, I could pretty much eat that every day.\\n     The prices are decent, though I wish there was a size in between \\"slice\\" and 14'' \\"medium.\\"  Beer selection and prices are also decent in my book.

It is as exactly as described.....decent layer of pimento, tomatoes, and lettuce on rye and that's all. The sandwich itself was a little disappointing since the menu proclaims \\"SOUTHERN FAVORITE\\", but I guess they meant that in a general sense.  The roasted vegetables should be called \\"roasted broccoli with a few carrots\\".  It had a vinegar-y flavor.  Overall, the meal filled me up, but I was already thinking about what I wanted for dinner.\\n\\nMy roommate opened up his spinach wrap and I couldn't help myself, but I busted out laughing.

The only thing I have ever sensed from the waitresses there are that they feel anxious and rushed during those times, and it has made me feel bad enough not to show up right before closing time ever again, because I understand that they have been working hard all morning and afternoon, serving a large customer base of hungry people and would love nothing more than a few minutes of rest that must feel further and further away during the last half hour of time before the end of their shift.\\n\\nMaria's has a great breakfast/brunch menu. I have had breakfast there on all but one occasion, where I tried a bacon cheeseburger which I enjoyed very much. Otherwise, I stick with the eggs, bacon, and home-fries combo that does not disappoint. The service there is always pretty good, and it is convenient to receive your bill from the waitress, and then pay at the cashier next to the cooking station on your own time before you leave. They have a little jar of free Dum Dum lollipops there, too! I always snag one before I walk out of the door. Just a little something extra that puts a smile on my face.

Sadly, the early and late hours have been trimmed back, so it's no longer an option during the morning commute for coffee and breakfast.  This is particularly unfortunate as they've now started to produce baked goods in-house, where in the past they used to source them from other bakeries.  We came late on a Friday night for dinner, so pastries weren't really an option, but what was in the bakery case looked pretty good.\\n\\nOn the plus side, the most recent personnel change has been the hiring of Tyler Minnis, one of the three chefs of Angry Bear Kitchen (hereafter referred to as ABK), along with his brother Colin.  When Angry Bear Kitchen was open, it was one of the bright spots of the Columbus fine dining scene; casual but creative and well-executed; now that Tyler's at the Market, the menu has started to reflect his influence.\\n\\nThe menu has been re-conceptualized as a selection of plates - snack-sized, small, \\"from the oven\\", and large.  It's worth noting that the small plates are pretty large; our cavatelli small plate was exactly the same size as our freeform lasagna large plate.  You may want to inquire with your server, so you don't over-order small plates and look like total gluttons, which is how we undoubtedly appeared to our fellow diners.  Plus, they almost didn't fit on our small 2-top table.\\n\\nMany of the touches from ABK are visible in the dishes, such as mixing of different techniques in a single dish, and unconventional presentations.  One of the highlights of our meal was the burnt carrot dish; a small helping of true baby carrots, some orange, some purple; the purple ones with their fine roots left on, slightly charred and edible, accompanied by a blend of goat cheese and harissa as a spread, and a foam seasoned with black olive.  The Market also had a slightly modified version of ABK's stellar freeform vegetarian lasagna (see my review of ABK), which while not quite as good, was still some consolation for the loss of ABK.\\n\\nService, it should be noted, is still a little discombobulated, but sincere and friendly.\\n\\nAnd, yes, the big red cock is still there, right above the front door."},{"name":"Sweet Water Brewing Company Draft House and Grill","address":"Hartsfield Jackson Atlanta International Airport, 6000 North Terminal Pkwy, Terminal B","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"If you have time (we had to wait 10 minutes or so) this is a great place for a craft brewed beer and a quick bite.

It reminds me of Frank's noodle House noodles) For being called spicy I wouldn't mind them kicking it up a notch on the spice level. (I asked for sriracha which I guess is kind of an unthinkable thing to ask but they obliged) We then got the beef noodle soup,  unsure of what it was going to taste like cause Pho is the King of Beef Noodle, this soup came in a good second.

I needed one that delivered since I had surgery on my two big toes this past week and cannot drive myself or sit up for more than a minute or two due to pain. \\n\\nI knew there was a pizza place that was new to GC so I went looking online. I found it. So I checked out their website and was glad to see they now deliver! I looked at the menu and was very happy with the prices! a 16 inch cheese pizza is only $10.50. Nice! I got a 16 inch pepperoni and banana pepper pizza, 8 inch garlic bread and 2 mini cannoli's. I wanted to sample the garlic bread (I love garlic bread!) and was interested in the cannoli's because I had never tried one before.\\n\\nI'm still eating off of the 16 inch pizza from dinner yesterday (by myself as my parents are out in Nevada preparing for our new home we just signed for, buying appliances, setting up utilities, etc)... I have yet to try the garlic bread but it smells okay. \\n\\nThe pizza is pretty good. I kinda like the spongy texture. Though I might ask for it to be crispier next time. It is very greasy. I haven't experienced that greasy of a pizza yet in my pizza-career. :P But there was nothing gross about it. So if you are NOT a fan of greasy pizza (or food in general) look elsewhere.\\n\\nThere is enough cheese and it covers nicely. I noticed the banana peppers were very skimpy, and the pepperoni could be more numerous. But the price was good. On the website they said it was Hormel pepperoni which i really like so that was a plus.\\n\\nIt wasn't a superb pizza but then again I've never experienced \\"sicilian-style pizza\\" before since I've never been to New York and have never been to Sicily. I would order it again mainly due to the lower cost compared to other pizza chains. I still prefer Papa Johns and Pizza hut pan pizza, but when you are on a budget and you really want pizza sometimes you have to do what the money tells you to do. Sorry.\\n\\nI haven't yet tried the garlic bread but it didn't smell amazing. Just kinda smelled like pizza crust with a hint of garlic. There was a small serving of pizza dipping sauce included in the box. \\n\\nThe canolli's were pretty good. I had never had one before but I liked it. It was an excellent dessert yesterday. I would think though that the price was a bit high for how small they were. $1 for a mini cannoli seems a little expensive for what they are. But I don't know the going rate for a mini cannoli. *shrugs* I would order the cannoli's again.\\n\\nSo all in all I think the pizza was just okay. It was worth it for being lower cost. Their delivery time estimate was pretty accurate. I think they may have even been a little early which was fine by me. \\n\\nTheir ordering system on their website needs fixed. I tried to order prior to calling and when I hit Check Out it sent me to an error screen with PHP code or something. I tried it 3 times in Safari on my Mac and then once in Firefox on my Mac and all times it did the same thing. So they definitely need to fix that.

SHE (i'd give a name, but no name tags were to be seen And i have no receipt) was so rude I almost left before they finished making my food. This young lady is absolutely not a good person to have at the front of a store speaking to customers. She barks orders about where people are supposed to stand (which is completely stupid because this is like a subway with fewer options..not exactly rocket science) and I stood there for a full minute before realizing my transaction was complete (as evidenced by her yelling at the next customer about how he wasn't standing in the right place to ask for lettuce). I was told by this 16 year old child where to stand, gruffily asked \\"what else\\" \\"what else\\" and \\"what else\\" I might want. When I was given permission to move to the register, I was told \\"12.61 do you want a bag?\\" And then she swiped my card, set it on the counter by my keys and was barking at the man behind me.

The first time I had the kobe steak. Maybe it's me or that cut of beef, but it didn't melt in my mouth like I've heard that kobe should. The second time I had the steak au poivre. The sauce was a bit on the salty side so I asked for the bernaise sauce instead, which was very good. My friend had the New York strip, she thought it was a little tough. She liked their filet mignon though. I like their sides and the sorbets come in unusual fruit flavors.

When you turn onto that street you'll see pretty much nothing (it's a rather dead part of town)...and then a bunch of people looking like they're waiting for something -- that's how you find the place. One of my friends got there at 6pm (on Labour Day Monday) and was told it would be 45 minutes. They were relatively accurate; we waited just under 45. There was an even longer line when we left around 8pm. Unfortunately no reservations taken for parties smaller than 6.\\nThe food wasn't necessarily amazing, in my opinion. I'm not a chicken wing fan so didn't even go for that one. The raw beef dish was pretty (good-)interesting, but the price was good too (read: expensive). The other dishes we got (can't name them all, but there were spring rolls in there) were just so-so, maybe partly because one of my friends had to be vegetarian so we went light on meat. \\nService was surprisingly good for a Canto-speaking place (other than the fact that they didn't give us menus when they seated us......). My friends were especially happy about the way they took care of my birthday cake: they willingly kept it in the fridge when we got in, dimmed the lights when they brought it out (with the candle lit), AND provided fresh plates & cutlery with a legit cake knife! I haven't had too much experience with bringing cakes into restaurants, but I was pretty impressed with how Phnom Penh handled it. Overall a good birthday dinner!\\n\\nTip for parking: I was driving north on Main and found some no-restriction street parking just before crossing Prior St, and it turned out to be a great spot.

One of the best Vietnamese/Cambodian restaurants anywhere.  A must go if you are in Vancouver.\\n\\nThe place isn't easiest to find but google maps helps, very nondescript location in Chinatown and an unassuming and quite store front.  You have to be looking for it to find it.  There's always a wait, and it took us about 20 mins to get a table and that was at Friday around 8:30.  The place would probably benefit from a full time hostess, since there were quite a few people lining up at the storefront before they took our name down.\\n\\nThe menu is extensive over 5 double sided pages long, full of Vietnamese, Cambodian, and even some Chinese dishes.  We asked the staff for some recommendations and we were blown away by our food.  The chicken wings is a signature item, fried in a light batter to a very crispy texture; it's one of the most unique asian wings I've had.  The flavor combination was excellent but maybe a little too salty for some.  Another must have is the hot and sour soup, which has a distinct salt/sour/sweet combination.  We topped it off with some Chinese sausage fried rice.  The beef dish we ordered was a miss on my opinion but the rest of the food more than made up for it.  Although we were tempted but ultimately did not order the famous \\"butter beef\\" dish, and later regretted it after seeing another customer having it.  If you like your beef rare, then go for it.\\n\\nThe staff was friendly and helpful, but lacked personality; typical \\"asian\\" restaurant service.

The different cuts, smoking it in the tradition of southern barbecue, eating it raw like a crazed daredevil, or indulging in those pricey imported chunks of decadent Kobe. I've had all of the above...and yes, I concur, they're all different and worth traveling any distance on foot through the snow. But not all that recently, according to many a food writer, food network personality, or just your average psycho foodie, no form of beef exemplifies the \\"you have arrived\\" special occasion dinner, like that of a thick cut of dry aged American steak. \\nGrill 23 is one of the few institutions in New England where you can experience a dry aged steak from a respected American cattle ranch/farm. After many recommendations (and warnings of the price tag) from coworkers, writers, and friends, my bigger half and I decided to make a reservation for an anniversary dinner. Upon walking through the door and wondering whether or not it is a good idea to check one's jacket...I really like that jacket...we were seated in a rather grand room with high ceilings dark wood, brass virtually everywhere, and a tapestry along one wall that would make the MFA feel a little bit of penis envy. The dining room was grand, to say the least, but far from intimate. Other dinners included some seriously under-dressed noobs, a whole bunch of old money Bostonians, and suits upon suits upon suits. It was loud, but obviously boisterous due to numerous patrons partaking in copious amounts of vino from a most impressive wine list. \\nAfter selecting our own wonderful glasses of Malbec and cab franc to go with the meat-fest to follow, we spoke to the waiter and placed our order. The Cotuit oysters were a duh, and so, we thought, would also be the hash browns as steakhouse hash browns are supposed to be a thing of beauty. (See Ruth Reichl's Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise.) However, our waiter, ever so subtly recommended that we select another side. Why? Pray tell. \\"Because they're not very good. I tire from bringing back orders to the kitchen.\\" Now, I don't know about you, but I'm always glad to hear a server make recommendations, and though this is the first time it has ever happened, I'm equally as happy when he saves me like superman from disappointment. I guess the moral of this story is: a) listen to your server b) don't order the hash browns c) go to this restaurant for the steak, not the sides. \\nA bread basket arrived, as did the oysters - delicious, make sure to try the cucumber mignonette. and so also followed the steaks. Now, there are a few dry aged steaks on the menu. Of course, please make sure to order one of  the dry aged steaks... otherwise what's the point of coming here and dropping the big big money? But I would generally recommend the strip steak or the ribeye. Cooked to a perfect medium rare, my strip steak tasted of concentrated beef flavor: grassy, juicy, and deeply savory with every chew. Likewise, the ribeye was delicious, with a bit more of the prime rib flavor that one expects. To cut to the quick, they were truly special steaks.\\nThough the sides weren't fantastic, as warned by our server, one goes here for the dry aged beef... worth at least a once in a lifetime indulgence, or if you are truly a follower of naturally raised beef, dry aged despite ants in your pants anticipation, in the setting of a fine dining institution, then this might become more of an annual destination. I enjoyed Grill 23, right down to that big-ass tapestry."},{"name":"Tapphoria","address":"13815 SW Pacific Hwy, Ste 40","city":"Tigard","stars":"4.5","text":"Came on a Friday night right before closing time so I missed the crowd.

The environs are absolutely gorgeous with two large seating areas and ornate wall, ceiling, and table ornamentation.  The lighting is mostly indirect, and the place is clean. It is quiet, even if there are a lot of people in the space.  Really great place to meditate.\\n\\nYesterday, I had the 5 course meal.  Simply put, it was too much food.\\n\\nFirst, they start up with the lentil soup.  It was good!  I liked it quite a bit.\\n\\nNext, they had a salad that was also pretty good.  I'm OK with eating with my hands, but that usually includes flatbread, naan, or enjara.  Here, you have regular bread, which makes things pretty awkward.  It soaks up sauces well, but it is also pretty filling.  I was starting to fill up already.\\n\\nNext came the ground chicken and scrambled egg tarts in filo.  Topped in powdered sugar, this was what I remembered most about this place: sweetened meat.  Also difficult to eat by hand. Pretty much done at this point...\\n\\nAfter that, the main course was brought out.  There were 7 of us, so there was a lot to choose from.  Sticky-sweet chicken in apricot or date syrups, an olive-based sauce with chicken, a very tender braised lamb that was otherwise sort of flavourless, a couscous dish with veggies and lamb.  The best thing there were the skewers of... you guessed it, chicken.  I love me some chicken, but man... we need some variety.  And eating couscouse with your hand: Is that a dare to completely mess up your entire restaurant?  I'm amazed that they keep the place as clean as they do.\\n\\nNormally, I wouldn't complain about too much food, but all 7 of us struggled to even make a dent in this after the previous courses and breadiness.  What would have been better: half the portions, half the cost and use a friggin' flatbread!  We were stuffed, and then they brought dessert, which was a milk-based pudding with toasted almonds on it, we nearly groaned in despair.  It was good, but hey-zeus, there's just too much sugar in this meal all around.  We all got leftovers, but who knows how well it will keep... or if I'll even want to bother.  Maybe I'll pawn it off on some friends.\\n\\nThe orange-blossom water rinse before dessert left a nice, lasting scent, and the server was very nice.  But all in all, there are lots of amazing places to go to for the money, and I prefer a lot less sugar in my meat.\\n\\nIf you want to take your mom for a large birthday party, this is safe enough for that.  But it generally feels too safe: there's no spice, there's no challenge.  It is just a lot of meat and sugar. Great 'white people' blandish food.

So after 10 minutes go by of us looking at each other and our steaks sitting on the table untouched, despite being in proximity of the manager who was only a table away, we continued to stew.

We were looking for a cheesesteak place we hadn't been to before and something that wasn't Philly Connection (puke).  When we pulled up I wasn't sure what to expect because it is a very small place with no seating inside other than a few chairs where you sit while they cook your food.  So don't come here expecting to be able to sit down at a table to eat.  We each ordered a cheesesteak which we watched them make since you are standing directly in front of the cooking area.  When it came time to hand over our food I nearly crapped when I saw how big they were.  We could have easily ordered one and split it.  No chinsing on anything here!  We grabbed our grub and sat down on one of the concrete parking blocks to eat.  It was fantastic!  Just remember when you come that you can order one and easily split it between two people.  They're huge!  \\n\\nAnd on a side note, this is more of a personal thing, but contrary to what some other posters have said this place is NOT in Atlanta.  It is in Stone Mountain.

For appetizers, we had a blue cheese salad with pecans and pears ( 4 stars) and the escargot ravioli ( I wanted my 13 year old to try new foods--3 stars;  I'd had escargot only once before and this wasn't as good).

Not like other places I've tried where the chicken was too dry. The mix of chicken, waffles and syrup was really an awesome flavour in the mouth! There are lots of burgers to choose from and they're decently priced. The only thing was that the burgers didn't come with fries. You have to buy the fries on the side. I don't understand why they do this. Kind of like Romers as well. The burger itself is decent price. But if you add the fries as well, it can begin to get pricy. \\n\\nThe atmosphere is OK. Not great. But definitely not poor. It feels more like a coffee shop. But they do offer a lot. Food. Pastries. Coffee and drinks. It's a great place to just hang out for a bit or to do some work there. Pretty quiet after the lunch or brunch rush. So it could potentially be a good place for work or study.

I've had the opportunity to check them out for lunch today, where I had their Orient Express, which according to the description on the menu, consisted of two eggs, your choice of meat, garlic fried rice and fruit. The food did take a while to come out (I waited about 25 minutes), and I suspect that they might have forgotten my order as they don't appear to have a ticket system. When the dish did arrive, it came with plain rice (as opposed to garlic fried rice) and no fruit. I don't know if it's because they made a mistake, or if they've changed the dish but had not the chance yet to update the description. In spite of these shortcomings however, I did still quite enjoy my meal, and I'm willing to overlook the problems in their service seeing that the restaurant is still quite new. Moreover, the staff were incredibly friendly and hospitable, and possibly the NICEST people that I've ever encountered at a restaurant. They apologized for the long wait, gave complimentary pieces of chocolate to everyone, and even offered me extra rice free of charge. I strongly recommend checking this place out if you happen in the area.

Now, the description in the menu states that it's supposed to be served with garlic fried rice and fruits, but I didn't receive any fruits and plain steamed rice. Now I didn't really mind not having fruit, but I was admittedly a bit disappointed about not getting garlic fried rice (which sounds delicious). Nevertheless, the food was still tasty. I had requested for my eggs to be cooked with a firmer yolk, and they came out perfectly, and were actually well-seasoned. The tocino (which I think is best described as a Filipino-style bacon), however, was the definite highlight of the meal. The meat (which I think is pork belly) was very tender, juicy and incredibly flavourful. It was glazed with a sweet sauce that's similar to that of Chinese Char Sui, except the flavour's more intense here and the meat's got a wonderful char to it.

It tasted really good and the spread (apple butter) made it even better. The bread tasted a lot like breakfast biscuits, which I personally fancy so I really enjoyed it.\\n\\nFor the main course, I ordered the Kilkenny Pot Pie (kind of like a chicken pot pie, I believe), and it was ok but nothing special. The dish basically consisted of a thick chicken/veggie soup topped with a crust. I should mention that this was my first pot pie ever, so maybe I had a fantastic pot pie but just didn't know it - basically I don't really have anything to compare the taste experience with. However, I didn't quite fancy the dish and wouldn't plan to order it again. Also, the vegetables on the side were subpar, in my opinion. The vegetables themselves were pretty plain and the sauce that coated some of them tasted kind of sour - again, not my favorite.\\n\\nOverall, an average experience.

The best? I'm not too sure I can judge that, as I'm not a Vietnamese food aficionado.  \\n\\nBUT! I would agree though that they have the most extensive list of traditional Vietnamese cuisine at reasonable prices. \\n\\nYen Ha is a Vietnamese restaurant tucked within a hole-in-the-wall wanna-be strip mall off of NE Sandy Blvd and NE 68th Ave. The location may seem a bit random and surrounded by a questionable neighborhood. But don't let the neighborhood deter you from dining here. The restaurant is located across the street from Safeway.\\n\\nI came to Yen Ha one Saturday evening with a group of buddies as a mini reunion. We chose this location because they serve you \\"family style\\" and we wanted to see what their \\"7 courses of beef\\" was all about......\\n\\nAs you walk in, the decor seemed a bit run down and the lighting was dim. The space is a bit narrow, but they have enough room for large parties and small groups. Granted as you can imagine, it's not your fancy schmancy resto, but it'll do for good, cheap eats. \\n\\n*XA XIU (#8 on appetizers off of menu) - if you wanted a fried egg roll filled with BBQ pork and fresh veggies, this is a good option. For $3.95 you were able to get about a dozen egg rolls to allow a party of six to consume at least 3 rolls each!\\n\\n*GOI SUA TOM THIT (#11 in the salad section of menu) - feel like eating pickled sweet and sour veggies with some shrimp, jelly fish and BBQ pork? This dish was topped off with chopped peanuts and fried onions. It was a bit saucy, but it was very refreshing. It was a good palate pleaser to start off our meal. A small plate $9.95, and large $13.95. I wouldn't mind ordering this dish again!\\n\\n*BO 7 MON (#118 under specialties section of menu; aka \\"7 COURSES OF BEEF\\") for $26.95, one order is good for a party of 3-4. We decided to only have one order as we were ordering a bunch of other foods to devour. I'm not too familiar with the 7 courses of beef, but as my friends were giving me some food-a-macation, I learned that there's usually a skewer dish, soup dish, meatball dish, a stuffed meat dish and they forgot the others, but it was a decent amount of food considering that we ordered a lot of other stuff. So as being a 7 courses of beef newb, I didn't really have that much expectations, but overall thought the dishes were decent. \\n\\n*SEAFOOD SOUP (I don't recall what # it was on the menu) but we ordered a large! This soup was similar to what you would think hot-pot is. We had a little sterno and the bowl in the middle full of the savory broth. The top of the bowl's shelf was decorated with our seafood and veggies! On the side, they had some chopped up fresh veggies and some of your traditional Vietnamese noodles. What I loved about the broth was that it reminded me of a blend of a Tom Yum soup combined with a tamarind based flavor. There was hint of spice and it was wonderful, tasty and healthy (I think haha)\\n\\nSee pic here =  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yen-ha-portland?select=jm7QUHLjvy1DNocP37xmHw#Oq_Fa2xoFYUylQ9qBEbfFg\\n\\nOur server was nice, but odd. He kept on insisting for us to order the \\"ELK\\" and that it was local. I'm not too familiar with Vietnamese cuisine using elk on their menu, but our table wasn't going for that. \\n\\nMy only gripe about this place was that it was super cold! Even when going to the restroom, it felt like a freezer in there! I was a bit disappointed they didn't have any paper towels in the bathroom. They had one of those recyclable cloth towel dispenser that rotates around - eeek! Who knows how clean those things were, I ended up using the toilet paper to wipe my hands =X\\n\\nAdjacent to the restaurant is their bar/lounge - where they have kareoke and also a DJ. Prior to us leaving, we walked through the bar/lounge area where it was a bit dead - there was a pool table and a patio available if you wish to hang out there (IMHO - I probably wouldn't)\\n\\nOverall, for a party of six our meal came out to be a little over than $100. It wasn't too shabby considering the amount of food we ate and some of us ordered beer (Singha and Tiger beers are available). I wouldn't mind coming back to Yen Ha for some Vietnamese eats. \\n\\nYelp 2013 100 for 100 Challenge - Review #15"},{"name":"Grill 23 & Bar","address":"161 Berkeley St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Told I had to try Grill 23 while in Boston.

My Dad had the original baby back ribs, which were (at the time) outstanding.\\n\\nSo, last night I talked the wife into a trip down to FD's.  Wow, the place was busy.  Fortunately, they were pretty good at accurately estimating our wait time.  I ordered the Rib-Rib combo, choosing the original baby back ribs and the \\"Memphis-style\\" baby backs, which are served with a dry rub and no sauce.  Corn on the cob, cinnamon apples, fries and a cornbread muffin accompanied the ribs.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the ribs didn't evoke the same reaction in me that they did when I hit the place with my Dad earlier this summer.  The Memphis ribs were fairly burned and on the salty side.  The originals were coated in an unremarkable barbecue sauce and were too greasy for my liking.  Speaking of grease - the corn on the cob had a greasy, slimy texture.  Ick.  The fries are fine, as is the cornbread, but I can get those anywhere.\\n\\nI want to like Famous Dave's, but I really can't.

My coworker and I have tried to go here at least 6-7 times and they have only been open 2 times.  And, yes, all 6-7 times were during their posted hours. If they actually opened when they said they would, I'd give this 4 stars.  The food is pretty good. I've tried three things.   The kalbi is as good as any Korean BBQ place in Beaverton or Portland.  Had a good char taste.  The sauce was a little sweeter than I would have liked, but not necessarily sweeter than the kalbi at Hae Rim, for example.  The kalua pig was decent, but nothing special.  Not enough smokiness, I don't think (not very memorable so I don't remember exactly what it tastes like- I remember it just tasting like slow cooked pork- NOT kalua pork).

They have grits... it's like the holy grail for me!\\n\\nIt's the morning before we leave the ever-so-wonderful Portland and go back to the drudgery of reality. We passed by this place the night before and I mentioned to the hubby that we should go here. He remembered the next morning and steered me in the right direction. On the way, we saw two girls get out of a cab asking each other if they knew where they were... since they were wearing last night's attire, I assumed they were on their walk of shame. \\n\\nWe were following another couple vying for a table at the Urban Farmer... luckily, we were early risers and there were many tables. We were seated by the bar and our server promptly appears offering us coffee and orange juice. Yes please! I got a coffee and my husband got a coffee and a juice. \\n\\nThis place is swanky. I am very impressed with the decor... the courtyard has various seating areas... the bar, tables, an outdoor lounge that looks like it should have tiki torches all ablaze around it... the taken tables are spread out so I am not really forced to hear about anyone's legendary night before... except for the wedding party experiencing the Bloody Mary Bar. They give you a naked Bloody Mary and you get to go and put in your own fixings... it's like that place in Vegas, except they've already chosen your tomato juice.\\n\\nThey seem to be all about the local food. There is a huge chalkboard near the kitchen telling you about all the local companies that supply them.\\n\\nI see it. My eyes made a beeline for it. I have only had grits twice in my lifetime before this. The first time was made by my ex-boyfriend's mother who made them for her Southern born husband and instant--- the grits I went searching for the last time I went to Seattle. I order the shrimp and grits because I think I was meant to have them. I am sure my husband is cringing, hoping that the combination will nourish me instead of hampering me right before our six hour drive home.  My husband as per usual orders an Eggs Benny. \\n\\nOur food arrives really fast. I am glad because I am hungry. I noticed that everyone's food arrives really fast though... I am blown away by shrimp and grits. It came with some pulled pork and a poached egg on top. I think I could have done without the sour, tangy vinegar of the pulled pork sauce. It didn't really mix well with the savoury shrimp sauce floating atop my grits. I break the yolk of the egg and it runs and mixes with the shrimp sauce. Wow. The shrimps are huge and are somewhat chopped up so I can just fork the whole thing. Dammit. Now I am ruined for grits. So what if it was my third time ever having grits. It was the best I ever had. I love the porridge-y thick cream-of-wheat texture. I could eat this all day long. \\n\\nOur server was really attentive, always around bringing us more coffee and water. For the price we paid, I thought it was an amazing brunch. I always feel robbed when we go out to breakfast and pay more than $20, but this place was awesome. I could never have this kind of experience back home for this price... I thought it was way reasonable. \\n\\nI want to come back and get a steak, but I shall have to wait for another trip."},{"name":"Kulinarya","address":"2922 Glen Drive","city":"Coquitlam","stars":"3.5","text":"Been looking for a nice, no fuss lunch place close to my place and this may be it!

First and foremost before this goes real far south, our waitress was very friendly and even interacted with our daughter on several occasions throughout the evening. Let's begin- 1) Order to food arriving was just shy of 60 minutes. We did have the one kids meal brought out about 10 minutes earlier after asking us if that was okay. My wife and my meal came a few minutes apart and from two different people. 2) Drink refills only happened once during that long wait time and only after asking me after my tea had been empty for at least 10 minutes. 3) I ordered a dozen oysters on the half shell and every single oyster had shell pieces. I am not exaggerating.  It was almost like it was done on purpose. 4) Oysters came without lemons, asked for lemon and had to wait about 5 minutes. 5) After picking the shells out of each oyster, and being a glutton for punishment (and they were on sale for 1 dozen for 1/2 dozen price), I actually ordered a second dozen. This time only 10/12 had shells and they arrived again with no lemons. 6) My crab bucket arrived with no butter (a few minutes later, that eventually arrived after being requested). 7) After I got my butter I had to then request the nut crackers (bib, plate, etc). These actually came a little faster with an apology. 8) Everything took forever even just getting a to go box for my daughter's leftovers. 9) The pinnacle of the evening is when the hostess finally brought us our check (not waitress) and couldn't find a pen so asked if I could sign the credit card statement with a big black sharpie....\\n\\nCost (0). Usually Joes is pretty reasonable but the service issues and overall experience lead to an overall value that was substandard. \\n\\nAtmosphere (0).

The hostess at one point helped clear some dishes at a neighboring table while apologizing for short staffing issues. \\n\\nPalate (+). Thank goodness for the seasonal bairdi crab. The crab was absolutely excellent, probably one of the sweetest, best tasting crab meals I've had in a decade.  However, my wife's fish and chips were very mediocre.  The fish was quite greasy and there were chunks of grease soaked batter pieces that were dumped on the plate like it had come from the bottom of the fry baskets.  We had also ordered the peel and eat shrimp. They were very good but for some reason extremely difficult to peel. I've never had that issue before, so I am not sure if that is a preparation, freshness or some other issue. They didn't seem or taste old. \\n\\nEverything Else (0). Extremely disappointed. I've been to this location a couple dozen times in the last 15 years. Sitting outside on the deck overlooking Ladybird Lake, having a beer (or three), late dinner and business meetings have never disappointed in the past.

Yeah, yeah -I know it's mean to write about the Keg's Lobster Fest once it's gone until next year, but oh MAN is it ever good. This year on my birthday I was a very lucky girl, and my sister bought me a hundred dollar gift card for the Keg. She said \\"I know you've never had lobster before [yes, you read the right] so I want you to treat yourself.\\" Now, it's not that I've never tried lobster because I am against it for any reason. Sure, they mate for life and there are lonely lobsters out there because of predators like us, but I had honestly just never ordered it because it seemed so indulgent.\\n\\nWell, it was high time for a change. One August evening, my husband and I decided to head to the Keg in Yaletown for their Lobster Fest before it was over, and boy, am I glad we did. We both ordered the steak and half lobster dinner (ohhhh baby), as well as the lobster au gratin starter and a bottle of wine. Yep, we were livin' large. Being that it was my first time eating lobster, there was a bit of a learning curve, especially when it came to cracking the claw. At one point, the claw slipped out of my hands and flew onto the floor. I'm not ashamed to admit that I still ate it, and subsequently my friends have told me they'd do the same thing. Either my friends and I are gross, or it's totally normal. I'll let YOU decide.\\n\\nOverall, the meal was quite possibly one of the best I've ever had thus far in my life. The service we got was excellent: the waitress was attentive and friendly, but not too stuffy and formal like you get in some steakhouses. The location itself it, like the neighbourhood its in, trendy and upscale. My only qualm is that we didn't get to sit on the patio, which I hear is amazing and thus everyone tries to snap up a seat.

I had really really wanting to try this place now I have my chance.  The restaurant sits just off the corner, I passed it up the first time but was able to find it and park pretty quickly.\\nExcitedly, I went inside and I was astonished by how few patrons were inside and the sparseness of the decor, who cares right?  I am here for the food.  \\nAfter reading the reviews online for weeks I knew i had to have ribs and brisket.  And that is just what I ordered 1lb. of al a carte brisket and one rib to go.\\nImmediately upon receiving my food I rushed to my vehicle as I wanted to get home while my food was hot.  I did not have far to go, I just wanted to make sure.  On my drive I noticed the barbecue smelled, like barbecue sauce on bad meat.  I assumed it was the box the meat was in getting wet, I am not sure, but the nasty smell got stronger and stronger until I finally arrived home.  \\nUpon opening the container I was shocked.  i have been around barbecue my whole life and I can look at brisket and tell if its gonna be tender, not good-but tender.  This meat looked terrible.  The meat looked very dry, almost no smoke ring and very little bark.  While looks can be deceiving, in this case they were not.  The meat was terrible,  it was very dry with no smoke flavor at all.  The most surprising thing about the meat was the texture, it was nasty, like a rawhide chew toy I would give to my dog.  The difference being the rawhide chew smells better than this barbecue and my dog can actually eat the rawhide chew toy.  There was no way I was going to eat this barbecue, or give it to my dog, I love her.\\nOnto the rib, I think it was a rib but I am not sure.  It looked like a rib.  There was a rib like feel to it, kinda.  After smelling it and remembering I do have insurance I took a bite, or tried to-there ain't no way any meat is coming off of that thing.  Can you chew rubber off of a tractor tire? No.  Well there is no way you are eating this rib.  It was also slathered in some kinda glaze, I don't want to think about what that was.\\nAll in all this is the worst restaurant I have been to in Portland by far and I can only think of one or two restaurants I have been to in my 40+ years as bad as this.  How in the hell do they stay open?  I'll never figure that out.\\nSorry this review is a wall of text but I had to get this out quick while the wretched taste is still in my mouth so I can share my pain and absolute waste of $15.00.

The outdoor seating was wet...staff could have wiped the benches this morning to allow people to sit down while they wait. And again heating lamps may allow individuals willing to sit outside some form of warmth. They do not have an updated party notification system so if I chose to sit in my car to be warm and wait, chances are I would miss the host calling me for my table. To make it even worse the one thing I came for...French toast...well they ran out along with expresso beans. Someone needs to order more produce! There is nothing on the menu to replace the sweet craving I've had for the French toast I waited to get for the last two weeks. No pancakes or waffles. They should consider another sweet breakfast dish. I ended up ordering the PBLT with a fried egg...absolutely lacked taste. I was sooooooo disappointed.

Fortunately, there is a Publix right next to this location.  So we politely asked if they could replenish there stock of A-1 sauce that day from Publix.  The staff (who were super friendly btw) said that they did not have the means or authority to do that.  So then I asked for contact information for the franchise owner to submit a complaint. The employee got the franchise owner on the phone.  The owner refused to speak with me however, and just instructed the employee to give me an email address.  At the time it seemed odd that the Franchise owner would not speak to me right then and there.  I just assumed that perhaps now was not a good time to speak.  Within an hour I sent an email to the franchise owner explaining the situation.  That was two weeks ago.  I still haven't heard anything.  Honestly, Firehouse Subs as a whole is a great sub joint.

The chicken was so flavorful and wasn't overpowered by too many add ons. I'm usually a fan of tacos with tons of toppings, but the flavor of the chicken was so good that additional toppings would have just gotten in the way. Now, if that wasn't enough, I then moved in to the pork taco... That's when I fell in love. It was juicy. It was flavorful. It was spicy without being hot. It was gone in an instant. The tortillas were also amazing. They were soft without being mushy. I then moved on to the fried plantains. I had never had plantains before, so I had nothing to compare them to, but I have high hopes that all future plantains will be as amazing as these. They weren't over fried, but had a nice exterior and the insides held up nicely. They had a gentle butter flavor without being too overwhelming. I would highly suggest them. We then moved on to dessert. We had the flan as well as the tres leche cake. The flan was delightful! The texture was much more of a mouse consistency, and had a nice little kick at the end. The greatest leche cake was delicious! Incredibly moist and flavorful. It was definitely my favorite between the two.

My friend and I sat outside, it was a small but nice patio right under a tree -- waiter said there were no birds to poop on me :) There were however, ants and other fly bugs, but it is spring and good weather out.\\n\\nOur waiter...gosh our waiter, a bumbling man of later 40s/50s who was friendly but mumbled and fumbled, maybe he was new? He definitely memorized all the specials and things on the menu, but was difficult to understand...he could've been nervous. Anyhows, we first ordered two cocktails, then one appetizer then two entrees [the latter portion: 1 appetizer and 2 entrees covered by Groupon]. We got our bread in a bit of slow time, I always like bread to arrive by the time we get our drinks...The bread was soft inside and crispy on the outside, but only 3 slices/pieces for 2 people. Strange.\\n\\nThe food didnt take too long to arrive, and it seemed fresh and hot, and the appetizer Fried Green Tomatoes were good but also in 3 slices for 2 people. WTH is with restaurants these days...can you make 4 small slices or 2 big slices instead of 3 equal slices? Most people go out in even numbers, not odd and so you should make your menus that way!\\n\\nThe two appetizers were a New York Steak and Lobster Mac N'Cheese, both were pretty good and flavorful, we shared with each other. Large portions, enough to fill one person each. Service was decent, our water was refilled [not by the waiter] and plates got taken away promptly when we finished eating. We were too full for dessert, so we just got the bill to pay.\\n\\nThis is where the problem happened! Since I bought the Groupon, I handed the waiter the printout, he left and came back with a bill. I usually never double-check the bill, since I assume restaurants know what they are doing, but apparently not --- at least not our waiter! I got a bill back with a pen scrawled \\"Original bill was $80, now is less\\", even though I saw the price of the bill total was almost $55 dollars [rounding up], I always tip 20% on Groupons, so I tipped $16 thinking it was $80 right --- that's what the waiter wrote! But then I got home and was suspicious of the math, I looked at the bill, if the Groupon covered the 1 appetizer and 2 entrees, then it was just the 2 cocktails plus tax. Of course, that did not equal $80 at ALL!!??!! So I have no idea where the waiter got that figure, I even added the original prices back of the appetizer/entrees and tax and etc and did not get that number, I did get $55 [but then Groupon was of no value????]. So what happened is still a mystery, and basically I got charged $55 for 2 $10 cocktails, and paid the waiter a 80% tip.\\n\\nBasically I didn't save any money with the Groupon, just goes to show you...don't buy them anymore, always check your bill, and don't go to Park's Edge.

I'd give it 4.5 stars for beer 1.5 stars for everything else.\\nLet's start with the positives.\\nBeer\\nThe tap list while not the longest in Austin, carries a number of different styles, and features many local breweries.  The best part is the pricing.  Their beer is priced very reasonably, and they sometimes have specials on beers that make them downright cheap.\\nThe bottle list is vast, carries many different styles, from breweries all over the country, and has seasonal selections. They did not seem to fall into the trap of having hundreds of bottles 99% of which are past their best by date.  The 4 IPA bottles we ordered were quite fresh.  Again, the prices are very, very reasonable.  Some bottles that stood out to me as being exceptional were only $4 more than Spec's for 22Oz.  \\n\\nAtmosphere\\nThis place is a classic local bar, updated with a great beer game.  I enjoyed the table tops which features labels from breweries last open in the 80's, in the back room they have a classic bottle collection from long closed breweries like Celis and Pete's wicked (before they got bought out and ruined), and even a Zima bottle, fun little trip down memory lane.\\nIt is definitely a regular's bar, but the interaction I had with the regulars was great.  Everyone in the place seemed really nice.   There was none of the cold shoulder you can sometimes get as a newcomer in a local's bar.\\n\\nNow, on to the negatives.\\n\\nThe food\\nLook, the food is terrible.  Everything they serve seems to start out frozen and/or pre-packaged.  The burger, clearly a frozen patty.  The cheese on the Nachos?  From a can.  The Macaroni and Cheese bites, frozen in a bag.\\nThe chili may be from scratch, but wasn't very good.\\nHave not had the Pizza personally, my friend who has eaten there before said the Pizza is passable, if greasy.\\n\\nThe Service\\nThe service was just as bad.  Yes, I was there on a busy night for them.  However, it would not have been a problem for any other restaurant of a similar size. They had 2 servers, a bartender and a manager.  So, plenty of staff.  I asked for waters for the table 3 times, I never got them.  We had to resort to grabbing the attention of whichever waitress we could to ask for another round of beers. Our check took over 20 minutes to arrive, and I had to flag the waitress down to even ask for it.\\n\\nHaving said all that, I'll be back, I'll just eat first."},{"name":"Zpizza","address":"860 Peachtree St, Spire Building, Ste D","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"My first time in, and I was craving a meatball parm sub.

Since I am so new to Austin and probably won't go to too many restaurants twice unless it is absolutely amazing - I would say I probably won't go back to Vino Vino until I do a little more exploring. \\n\\nSERVICE:\\nThe service was a little too overwhelming.

I had already looked at the menu online, and although it was a light menu I went with the $18 scallops because our server said they were his personal fav.  Ugh, the boy needs to get out more.  Not only were they NOT good, they were borderline bad.  And there were only THREE of them on a bed of wilted lettuce (at least I hope that was lettuce).  It was more of an appetizer serving size for a full fare price.  I was still hungry so opted again for the server's high recommendation of the cheesecake.  I've had better cheesecake out of the freezer section at Wal-Mart.\\n\\nOverall it's a fun place if you are with friends and sucking down the wine (although a bit pricey I thought), and the patio is quaint and I bet the fireplace is a hit in the cooler months.

My favorites include the lamb shank (available as a special), shawarma, Lebanese surf and turf, and another special entr√©e, the pureed eggplant, meat, and pine nut dish I think is called shek-la-ma.   The lamb shank has a unique wine colored red sauce unlike no other I have tried.  Many times, I ask for an extra cup of that sauce so I can cover the grilled tomatoes, onions, and peppers that come with the dish in that sauce. (I usually order grilled vegetables instead of rice, although their rice is also very good).  The lamb shank itself is also excellent.  The shawarma is home made, and the tahini sauce complements it nicely.  The Lebanese surf and turf consist of small lamb ribs and jumbo shrimp.  The shrimp is outstanding.  The shek-la-ma is also a worthy special to try.  In terms of vegetarian options, Madras (lentil and onions) and the vegetarian kibbeh are both of our favorites.  The vegetarian kibbeh is a unique blend of pumpkin, spinach, and other subtle spices that add up to a uniquely satisfying meal.   In fact, we both prefer the vegetarian kibbeh to the meat kibbeh.   The Madras is surprisingly good, a simple dish of lentils and onions, but done just right.  Finally, the hummus has its own unique quality to it.   We have been going to Byblos for over 20 years, and we have gotten to know the owners well.  The owners, Maurice and Nellie, are just wonderfully eloquent, polite, and warm hosts.

I believe he got the roasted chicken again, and I had the salmon. The salmon entree was really light and exactly what I wanted. \\n\\nThis time our service more than met our expectations. It was moderately busy when we arrived but had slowed down quite a bit by the time we left. Our bartender (Kaylah I believe) was sweet, attentive, and helpful with drink and food recommendations.\\n\\nI'm not sure how often I'll come back, but I'm glad this location was able to make up for what was lacking the time before.

I even remarked to my fianc√© while we were waiting for our food that, \\"I wouldn't be shocked if this place used to be a dive bar.\\" His response: \\"I think it was.\\" So, the decor leaves much to the wanting, and the numerous hand written signs are alarming, funny, and have a slight charm. That is only part of the score of a place (in my book anyway). There are many other factors at play in a rating; there is service, which this place did okay at, and, of course, the food. \\n\\nWalking in here, I was dubious; the marathon numbers on the wall just seemed an oxymoron for a Chinese food place. There are also (what look like) fish bath toys hanging from the ceiling fans, and ALL of the plants are dusty. Yet we stayed and actually chose to eat at the restaurant. When we walked in we were the only people in the place, save the lone woman, (wo)manning the counter. She told us that we could sit anywhere that we liked, so we chose our table and were promptly handed a menu. Not a laminated menu mind you, a paper one, the same ones that they staple to the out going food orders. I know this is true because I witnessed the stapling first hand. \\n\\nWe took a while with the ordering. Like any Chinese restaurant, the menu is quite dense. I was pleased to see that they are not just Chinese food, though; they have Cantonese and some curry dishes too. The latter of which my boy ordered. I ordered... you ready? What I ordered is the reason for the 4 stars, so you should prep a bit? You know what, I will give you a second for the awesome that I am about to write. Do some breathing exercises.  \\n\\n.\\n\\n.\\n\\n.\\n\\nReady now? Did you do some stretches? Limber up for the shock? No? I suggest you do. \\n.\\n.\\n.\\nOkay, ready now? All right. This is what I ordered: General Gau's SHRIMP! See, aren't you glad you warmed up for that? I know that you have heard of General Gau's Chicken, everyone has, but have you heard of General Gau's Shrimp? I had never heard of it; had only heard of the chicken. Dang that food was tasty. So tasty that I did not want to share with my fianc√©, but then he pouted so I gave him one bite. That is it, just one bite. About four bites in I knew that that plate of food was going to become a \\"craving food\\", you know what I am talking about? The kind of food that you just know there will come a time at four o'clock in the morning and you will want it so bad you could kill for it. Yeah, that is this. Everything was cooked perfectly too: the rice, the broccoli, that sauce.  See, now I am running into a slight problem. In writing all this I want to eat it again and right now I can't. This is just torture.  \\n\\nGo eat this food, you will not regret it. Do not be scared off by the empty Nantucket Nectar's bottles that are strewn around the pots of plants.

It holds a special place in my household's heart.  But I gotta be real.  The food is alright, but never (ever) worth the extraordinary amount of time it take for them to actually make an order.  For real.  It defies all logic.  From simple to complicated, expect at least an hour for your order -- usually more.  This goes for delivery and pick-up.  Ordering online?  Pick literally any delivery time you like.  Won't matter.  Picking up?  Bring a book, or just people-watch the 5 or more people somehow not working on your order.  If you're lucky you may see the owner either yelling about a customer or yelling about something else -- whatever it is, he's yelling about it.  I worry about him a little sometimes.\\n\\nIf you're in the mood for some serious crazy, check out their social media accounts.  The inexplicable ranting is matched only by the absolutely insane grammar.  Normally I wouldn't fixate on grammatical issues online, but wow.

If you decide to have cheese as an appetizer she will come over to your table with her cart and hand cut the cheese in front of you while making a caricature plate on the side. It's pricey but worth it for the experience. After a seamlessly timed delivery of appetizers and drinks our entrees arrived all at the same time. I myself am not a huge steak person so she suggested something not actually on the menu, a painted hills beef burger. Her suggestion was spot on, the second I bit into the hamburger the beef melted in my mouth. My food was so fresh, something I know I can always count on this restaurant to deliver.

That is not my favorite cut of beef, but I will order that steak 10 times out of 10. The rack of lamb got a huge thumbs up, and the shrimp an grits were a hit with all who ordered it. As I look at some of the recent reviews here that are unfavorable, I certainly don't have any right to dispute them, but I can honestly say that I didn't see any evidence to support what I read below (racist owner, inadequate portions, etc.). There were 12 satisfied people in my party, and I think that's worth something. I think it's a great comeback story at Park's Edge, and I hope that those who dine there agree. I will definitely eat there again the next time I'm in Atlanta. (I live in Birmingham, AL.)

Especially when many of his concerns are clearly addressed. My reservation was on Valentines Day, as indicated in my review and by a verified check-in. I actually booked a table via Yelp and OpenTable.com for that evening.  I utilize my real name as a Yelp Elite and a current photo of myself which can be verified across my other social media pages. I realize that some who review other businesses may not take the time and careful consideration to give a business the adequate time and elecution they may desire, but the average Yelp user is also not a professional reviewer. For professional reviews, you should seek out the media, not a local review site. I will not downgrade my rating, as I still believe it is a fair representation of my experience that evening, but  you certainly will not see any more check-ins from me here, nor updated reviews. Also, as someone who has a bit of experience in the legal industry, but is not an attorney, I'd strongly encourage the owners and management cease posts like these if they wish to purse legal action until they actually speak to legal counsel, as I can't see how any competent attorney would endorse blaspheming restaurant patrons under pending litigation."},{"name":"Ki Sushi","address":"45 Eighth Street","city":"New Westminster","stars":"3.5","text":"Everything I orderer was delicious.

If I could find a way to survive on nothing but biscuits from here on out, I'd move in to Redd's. They brought butter and two homemade spreads for the biscuits -- one was like something midway between applesauce and apple butter and the other was a sweetish spicy spread which was awesome on the potatoes. My husband loved his omelette, too. It was just the right amount of food to feel like we had sufficiently overeaten slightly for a Sunday morning, but not so much that we felt awful afterwards. The Looney Tunes cartoons were a nice touch, to have something on the tv but have it not be sports or news. Also, crazy enough, there wasn't a wait at noon on a Sunday.

We've been there twice, and been pleased both times with the food. It's a very small establishment, which is smart for a business trying to test the shark-infested waters of the restaurant business. \\n\\nThe owner's parents do all the cooking, and they do a terrific job of it. We've tried all three of the bao rolls. Instead of the doughy, under-stuffed baos that you normally find in Chinese restaurants, these are more like a puffy mini-taco: freshly made, stuffed with either chicken, pork or beef, and folded into a delicious two-bite appetizer. Another excellent appetizer is the scallion pancakes. About the thickness of a crepe, they are crisply layered, light and tasty.\\n\\nFor the larger items: We've tried the spicy pork noodle bowl (not a soup), the vegetarian soup, and the beef soup. These are very generous portions. The beef soup has a very rich and flavorful stock base with liberal amounts of tender, braised beef, noodles, spinach, etc. A very small dollop of their house-made hot chili sauce made it perfect. The pork bowl was flavorful and plentiful, although some chopped veggies on top would be a plus. My wife liked the vegetable soup with glass noodles, which has tofu instead of meat, of course.\\n\\nA condiment table has the usual soy, soy vinegar and Huy Fong Sriracha choices, along with their own hot chili sauce, which, if you really want serious heat, will light up your life.

Oh, I do not think so, Yelp!  I am a frequent regular here and check-in with Yelp all the time.  Sam's Boat, did you somehow manage to get Yelp to push a reset button in order to erase all of your past reviews?  My dismal 2-star review I wrote a couple of years back is gone?  What's up with that?!\\n\\nWell, fine.  I suppose you deserve a second chance because the majority of those reviews were miserable.  If that is the way you want to play, Sam's Boat, then so be it.  I figure you deserve another review from me, anyway, since my last one was so awful.  So here is your NEW review, Sam's Boat!\\n\\nI have been a regular at this Sam's Boat since the place opened sometime nearly 20 years ago.  Over the years, it has had its ups, and it has certainly had it downs.  Nevertheless, I keep coming back.  Consistently, Sam's Boat knows how to boil crawdads the way I like'em, and I really love their crab balls.  During the past year, I have had no complaints whatsoever with the food or service.  \\n\\nRecently, they have changed the menu to include some new items.  Like calamari and shark.  I have not tried the tentacles yet, but the shark is very yummy.  I am not even sure who else serves shark in Austin, but the shark bites have quickly become one of my favorites here.\\n  \\nSome of the changes they made recently include a fancy presentation of their classics.  For instance, my crab balls came out the other day on a platter with an extravagant design squirted all around with remoulade sauce along with some sort of green-leafed garnishment sprinkled in.  Seriously, Sam's Boat is not a place where any of your regular customers are demanding artistic expressions in our food.  Totally unnecessary.  Just chunk my balls down in a basket with a side of sauce and bring them to me.  I do not need any \\"chef inspired\\" presentation of crab balls, shark bites, or anything else for that matter.  It is just a waste of time in the kitchen and only slows my food from reaching its destination in my belly.\\n  \\nLately, the service has been excellent.  Over the years, I have experienced the very best service here.  With that said, I have also experienced the very worst service here.  It has been a couple of years now since I have had any sort of poor service or problems with management (which was the main cause of my previous 2-star review I mentioned earlier).\\n\\nWhenever I have ordered raw oysters here, I am typically disappointed, so I stopped taking the chance on them here a number of years ago.  In fact, I have learned to stick with foods which are fried, steamed, or boiled at Sam's Boat.  You may be taking a chance if you order something raw, seared, or grilled, but then again, it could turn out delicious.\\n\\nMost importantly, Sam's Boat has never poisoned me.  Not even once."},{"name":"Victoria's Station & Vic's Boathouse","address":"86 Wharf St","city":"Salem","stars":"3","text":"We had good experiences today for our dinner with friends and family.

I've passed it many times and always noted that it was crowded, so the food must be good. The music was VERY loud and when asked to turn it down, they did. Coffee was great, no problem there. When I asked (and should not have had to ask if the waiter was attentive) for a refill and thanked him, his response was 'no problem' as if I was bothering him; the correct response from a waiter is 'you are welcome' or 'my pleasure'. The food was OK, but for $9.95, two strips of bacon, scrambled eggs and a biscuit, it seemed to be excessively priced. Then the coup de grace was when the check was paid, the waiter debited my account for someone else's bill for $62+ instead of our charges which were for $25+. When pointed out, he said he would fix it and ran my debit for the correct amount. But, I had to ask for the credit receipt showing that it had been credited back to my account, as he forgot to bring it. Management needs to train their servers with proper customer service. The proper response to the incorrect bill should have been 'I am so sorry sir - I will make this right for you, I don't know how that happened and it will never happen again'. Granted, the place was busy, but with proper training, and a willingness to provide a good experience for customers, waiters can still be busy and serve everyone in a way that will make them want to come back.

We did and the owner was nice enough to walk us along the wall and point out a half dozen good choices.  The food was great, with smoked samon that melted in the mouth.  They were serving Paella as a special, but as we only wanted snacks we passed on it.  The prices were really reasonable.

I did your Tasting Menu ages ago, but wanted to try your famous duck as well before writing my review. Unfortunately, that took almost a year. In my defense, you *are* across the street from Craigie, my boyfriend's favorite restaurant.....\\n\\nAll right, then. Here's the skinny on Salts:\\n\\nTasting Menu: 4 stars\\n\\n- No doubt different now than it was back then. Some of the dishes we tried included beef medallion, some juicy chicken and a fantastic dessert with chocolate foam, cookie and cookie crumbs. I was treated to my meal, so I don't know how much it cost, but if it seems reasonable to you, I'd say go ahead and try it. I certainly liked it better than No. 9 Park and there's no way Salts is more expensive than that snob factory.\\n\\nDuck for Two: 4.5 stars\\n\\n- Yes, you're not going to feel all that unique when you realize every other table around you is having the same thing, but once you bite into that plump, tender, juicy, perfectly-roasted bird, you won't bloody care. I wanted to lick my plate at the end. The accompanying veggies and sliced pear are just as delicious. You can tell the whole thing's been roasting in its delicious gravy for hours because it all tastes like duckfection (that's \\"duck\\" + \\"perfection\\").\\n\\nOther fun things to get while you're here: the Wild Japanese Hamachi and the Brown Butter Pecan Panna Cotta. I am....how you say....OBSESSED WITH HAMACHI!!!!! I could eat slices of beautiful, delectable yellowtail all day and night if it wouldn't bankrupt me and possibly kill me with mercury. This is one of the best hamachi apps I've come across, both in terms of value and presentation. The cuts were beautiful and thick, and perfectly accented with citrus, vegetables and other garnishes. \\n\\nThe Panna Cotta, with vanilla compressed apple, maple, caramel, and apple cider was incredibly light and delicious, despite the seemingly heavy ingredients. It's what I call a \\"silencer': one of those dishes that's so good, you and your dining companions completely stop talking as you busily stuff your faces with it.

The bartender saw we were waiting awhile so he went to check our reservation which was kind of him and we ended up getting sat after a hour, little longer of a wait but no big deal. We take our drinks to the table and get greeted by our server, she offers us another round and a app but I explained we already had one and our drinks were full and her response was \\"You're really pisssing me off\\" I'm sure she was joking but no laugh or even smile and she walked away. We then ordered and asked for a water she tells us no which we were confused if she was joking again but then she doesn't come back with water for about 20 min smelling like smoke, so I'm guessing smoking is more important than a customer. We got one glass of water each and she never refilled it once the entire hour we were there, my sister ended up eating the ice! Our meal came out, my boyfriend got the prime rib which he loved, me and my sister split a 8 oz filet medium which came out almost well done, I have never sent a meal back but I couldn't eat a steak that cooked. It came out when my boyfriend was finishing his meal so we had to box it up. The manager did take care of the filet but didn't apologize at all just dropped it off. We saw her talking to multiple tables asking about their meals but couldn't even aplologize that we weren't  even able to enjoy a meal together.

Out the the multiple times I've been here I have never left feeling less then 100% satisfied. Although it is on the pricey side (probably averages at least $5 a bite), it is money well spent!\\n\\nApps:\\n- crab cake: VERY SMALL. I like my crab cakes with large lumps of crab.

Both of us love wine and good food and we usually pay pretty money for pleasant experiment.

It was like Tuesdays with Morrie minus the tragic backdrop.   \\n\\nLike a grandfather who experienced life in another era, my mentor was well versed in various topics including art, photography, politics, music, and food, and the common theme throughout all his proclivities was a gravitation towards the classics.   His recommendations on where to eat, what to read, where to travel were always the old masters, shying away from the zeitgeist.  \\n\\nCaffe Umbria encapsulates the classic Italian expresso bar, based out of Seattle and founded by a third generation roaster with roots in Perugia, Italy, way before coffee found its way into  American culture.  The artistry and passion put forth into their product has not been ignored by the masses, having expanded to four locations and being served in a multitude of venues including the Bellagio Hotel in Las Vegas and the Culinary Institute in Napa.   My mentor insisted the best way to enjoy an Italian roast was in the form of a macchiato (Italian for \\"marked\\" or \\"stained\\"), an intense shot of expresso marked with a dollop of foam, unlike the bastardized forms drizzled with caramel and doused with cream one finds at Starbucks/Dunkin Donuts.    A little sugar is optional, but the point is to enjoy the essence of the expresso with the milk serving to moderate the flavor and adding a touch of sweetness.    Like having one's first shot of scotch, my first few experiences were a bit jarring, but after many weeks I grew accustomed to the subtle nuances and it's now my go-to drink whenever I step into a quality roastery.    I can't comment on the authenticity of the sandwiches/pastry but the gelato is respectable with limited flavors and the venue is sleek with lots of natural light and clean lines, much like I would imagine the original roastery would appear in Italy.   \\n\\nThe pacific northwest has a wide abundance of coffee options to choose from, but Caffe Umbria is a vicarious portal into experiencing expresso in its most classic form."},{"name":"Liz's Grill","address":"11003 Harris Branch Pkwy","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I haven't been able to get past the burgers and tacos as they are my favs, but do plan on getting up early one morning to give the breakfast tacos a try.

There are times when delivery is our only option and I've called this location proactively and offered turn by turn directions.

Outside of breakfast, I am virtually always in the mood for pizza.  Anyhow, checked yelp to see what was close by, liked what I saw and was off to Figs.  I went on a Saturday around 5 p.m. which as it turned out could not have been better timing.  Only had a about a 10 minute wait for a table for two.  Had we come an hour later we would've been standing in line out the door like many others that arrived after us.  Get there early or plan on waiting as this seems to be a popular destination.  \\n\\nIn terms of space, this restaurant is cozy (i.e. small).  Yeah, it's pretty tight in there when it starts to get packed.  Figs creates an enjoyable lively ambiance, but I can see how some might not like dining in a somewhat confining space like this.  Personally I kind of like it as long as no one is spilling drinks on me or obliviously bumping into me while I'm trying to enjoy my dinner.  \\n\\nOnto the dinner, we ordered a Bronx Bomber (pepperoni pizza) and mixed green salads.  The salad was perfect.  A nice blend of leafy greens with a perfect drizzling of a lemony vinaigrette.  Portions were perfect.  The pizza - let me preface by saying that I'm something of a pizza snob and I love thin crust pizza like this, although with pepperoni it's sometimes a hit or miss affair.  This pie came LOADED with pepperoni, which I am normally a fan of, but this was too much for a thin crust IMO.  The crust was so drenched in grease that I literally could not eat a slice by hand.  There should be a balance of ingredients that compliment, not kill each other.  The ingredients, by the way,  were all delicious. Although I really am not a fan of soupy consistencies and having to use utensils when it comes to pizza, which for this particular pie was absolutely necessary.  So, I was a bit disappointed where this is concerned.       \\n\\nThe service was very good and on that alone I would've given Figs 4 stars.  Hostess got us promptly seated as soon as a table opened and our server was politely attentive.  During my dinner, I noticed other tables had ordered pies with different toppings and they looked (and smelled) excellent. So, I'm willing to give this place another try next time I'm in town and hopefully have that 4 or 5 star experience."},{"name":"Urban Farmer","address":"525 SW Morrison St, 8th Fl","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"I saw a sign on the street advertising a steak house. It was 4.45 pm. I took the elevator to 8th floor and ended at a hotel reception. There i asked for the steak house i was after. I was told about anothet option an adian style restaurant but i was told there the portions might be too small. So i stayed with the idea going to the steak house. I saw the waitress and was given the menu. The menu was titled happy hour menu. Oh i thought its cheaper until the deadline 5pm. I picked an item with tenderloin and potatoes. Guess what i got. I got three miniature tiny pieced of meat each of the size of a 25cent coun and two mini pieces of potato of about the same size. I told the waitress that i have never seen such a ridiculous size of meal before. She asked if i wanted the check for my coke. Ha? Now as i critisize she wants me to leave? I asked for the manager. He was friendly and offered to prepare a bigger portion. He also offered corn bread. Ha? Why i never got this offered before? When i checked out the waitress told me generously that the three mini samples of meat had been taken off the bill but all remaining items stayed abd i had to pay full price. I did get nothing to make up. Not even a cheap cup of coffee. After experiencing all this i read through all the entries on yelp and noticed that there are serious service deficiencies in this place.

I think they have more recently started their dinner service, so that probably explains it. Anyway, we started with two orders of Fried Green Tomatoes, one that came topped with Pimento Cheese and the other with Smoked Trout and Horseradish cream sauce. We all agreed that we liked the ones with the trout and horseradish sauce the best. When I read this item on the menu I worried that the horseradish would be too clear your nose spicy, but it was actually very subtle which I liked. The trout had a deep smoky meatiness to it that paired well with the crisp tomatoes. The pimento cheese version we all felt was lacking, what we weren't sure of. \\n\\nFor my main course, I ordered the Salmon cooked Medium. What I got was a perfectly cooked piece of well done salmon, which was tasty and nicely cooked but not what I was expecting. The salmon was pretty plain, but the sauce surrounding it was incredibly salty. The kale sauteed kale served with it was delicious, but my only complaint was that I wish there had been more of it.

But at the prodding from a co-worker started a relationship with this place that lasted a long time. To anybody who has worked along the KIngsway corridor , lunchtime can be a tricky thing-disappointing to many, as the fly-by-nightism and sporadic nature of the restaurants means brown-bagging it for most of the commuters and KIngsway /Cedar Cottage lunch-crowd.Thus began my affair with this clean, and friendly restaurant, whose employees are one of the reasons, it consistently fills up at noon, and late night. Waitress is cute and friendly, always making conversation...not that this is a criteria, usually that turns me off of the place, but I have a non-personal job, and one which requires not much socializing, so it really was ok.I can honestly say, and after testing, almost every other Pho Tai in the downtown/Broadway area, that this is easily the best broth, Best Rare Beef in the City. In addition , it arrives fast and friendly - at a pricetag below the $10 mark with a Coke....the meal was enough to get back to work with a smil thrroughout the year, and performance was guaranteed to improve after a chat with Lai(?), and a Pho Tai - Total Popeye Spinach Effect. Writing this review makes me want to go there now, and although I am not close, I know it will be worth it. Kudos to a restaurant that not only smiles at the sight of a caucasian man covered in grease enter a Vietnamese restaurant at lunch, daily, but welcomes them back with the same treatment every time.
