We immediately asked if we could get a different table.  We then picked a table towards the middle of the restaurant and it seemed to have solved the bug issue. Now on to the food,  we ordered the #3 and #4 noodles and the beef wrap roll as well. As we were sitting there waiting for the food, it got really hot inside because there was no AC. Even though all the blinds were down, the heat still seeped through and it felt extremely hot. Not sure why there's no AC since the plaza had AC. \\n\\nWhen the food came, we tried the noodles and it was good. Then came the beef wrap and one bite into it, I felt it was weird. Not being able to pin point exactly what was weird i kept taking consecutive bites. My friend took a few bites and also felt the same. A third friend took one bite and immediately knew something was off. The wrap did not have the same taste as what we were accustomed to and there was a sour taste. Since we couldn't figure out what caused the sour taste, I decided to eat item of the wrap separately. First I tried the wrap, it seemed ok. Then i tried the beef  and that seemed fine too.  Lastly I tried the cucumber and it seemed ok. But weirdly when you eat it all together it tasted off. My friends and I finally gave up and stopped eating it (which was more than half the plate left) because we didn't want a stomach ache on the plane ride. On our way out, my friend saw the container of cucumber sitting on the counter top in the kitchen and we immediately came to the conclusion that the cucumber must have gone bad.\\n\\nSo funny thing is, we try to pick a place that didn't have a location in CA and what do you know?

Never once did we get asked \\"how was everything?\\" Or \\"sorry for the wait, our kitchen is quite busy tonight\\".. Nothing of the sort, just a lot of ignoring and avoidance from our server. When it takes half an hour between courses, it's normal to get impatient.\\n\\nAfter deciding to say something, and getting some attention from our only connection to the kitchen that we wondering how about the main seafood course? We were unblessed with a very uptight French girl as our server who condescendingly responded, \\"IT'S COMING\\" O_O. We mentioned to her it had been about half an hour since the last course and her response: \\"yes. well, it's coming\\". Then, the other server nearby decided to chime in and tell us that the style of the restaurant's course serving is such that they would assume that we would be enjoying each other's company and want to spend time together thus the timing of the courses being delivered slowly out of the kitchen. \\n\\nWhat happened to professional & pleasant service? Many other top Vancouver restaurants prove that it exists. This reaction was unbelievable. The delivery of the overall good food that was prepared was so bad and quite rude, it's almost hilarious! What a joke. I've had better service at hole-in-the-wall diners.\\n\\nI do not recommend this restaurant for these reasons. I don't recommend this kind of dining experience for the price tag to anyone. Very disappointing.

We used the time to figure out what we wanted.  In a 180-turn-of-events, I went with the salad while my wife went with the burger option.  She had the Terlinga Burger and I had the Baby Kale Salad.  The burger was underwhelming as the bread kind of took over the show.  I appreciate that it's fresh baked, but it was a little too thick and chewy for my taste.  The flavor combo of Chile Con Carne, Fritos, and Sassy Sauce was good, but not original. As for the salad, more of the same.  The Vinaigrette was ok, but the unique combo of sunflower seeds, watermelon, and pickled red onions (which I love) gave it a little bit more of a wow factor.

The noodle dish I had was slightly spicy and it was filled with more veggies than noodles so calling it noodles was annoying. I live for a great hand pulled noodle but this was mostly veggies that were smoked and lovely but the noodle wasn't the star of my dish. The chocolate mousse was obviously not something I anticipated going to an asian focused restaurant but it was the best I have ever had vegan. It was a tofu base and had chocolate nibs but didn't taste even slightly bitter. The texture was perfect which I have never seen in veganized mousse so they definitely know what they are doing. Overall I would've liked this more without expectations and maybe with more mousse... or all mousse. I will def go back for dessert and maybe a small plate but I don't think this will be a regular haunt for me. I also won't drag my work people there again for a business meeting. It's pretty small. The staff there however is definitely excellent so if that gets a Michelin star then I would hand it over to the servers in a heartbeat. Try it just water down any crazy expectations. It is very good."},{"name":"Phoebe's Diner","address":"533 W Oltorf St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Incredible breakfast at Phoebes!

I recently ordered wings and they were really fatty...I mean globs of fat, really disgusting.  The fries were soggy and the salad seemed thrown together with lettuce and onions sticking out of the box and swimming in way too much dressing.  Another pet peeve is that they put the ketchup and sauce and utensils in the box directly on the food. Doesn't seem very hygenic (why not just put the sauces and untensils in the bag? Can they even spare a napkin?).     \\n\\nI tried to give them the benefit of the doubt a few times, but I'm sorry I just don't agree with some people who gave them good scores.  I could try to look beyond my bad experience with subpar food for my past orders and experiment with other items on the menu if the service wasn't so terrible.  If you dare to call here, be prepared to be treated poorly and to be rushed off the phone.  Since there's not a ton to choose from in the area for delivery, I think they're a default for some people, so they really don't appreciate their customers.

That small box fits more food than you would guess; there's a lot of Asian (and other) places around that also deliver unexpectedly in this way, and like those places, Song La fills half the box with rice, but fortunately the rice isn't dry, and they didn't skimp out on meat or veggies.\\n2. The meat was flavorful, had good texture, and was portioned well.\\n3. The cabbage! This was the most important factor in this 5 star review because it was great steamed cabbage that gave veggie balance, something that neither Don ($3 for steamed veggies) nor Pinch (bland veggies) can do well.

The kind of night you think could lead to an eerie tail of a disastrous evening of dining out.  We had heard so many mixed reviews about this place and debated weathering the storm to get here or not.  But let me tell you - this was no gloomy story.  It's a melt in your mouth, happy taste bud kinda tale!\\n\\nAfter making a mad dash to the door in the rain we were greeted with a warm smile from a nice young lady and seated at our table of choice for the evening.  I was immediately very comfortable in this rustic contemporary designed restaurant that may have the best view of Boston I've seen thus far.  A quick glance at the menu already had my mouth watering at the thought of delicious oysters.  So I decided that would be my theme for the evening.\\n\\nWe were then greeted by the extremely lovely and knowledgeable Laska.  Laska means Love by the way in Czech and that I was!!  I mean this lady was the finest waitress I've had in some time.  Polite, professional, knew almost everything about the menu and what was in each dish and if she didn't know - she didn't pretend and went and found the answer to even the most obscure questions.   She checked on us right at the perfect moments and made sure we were pleased with everything that was placed in front of us.\\n\\nThe Dirty Texan -Tito's vodka, what can I say - this Texas lady loves it!  Just the right amount of salty spiciness to make this a sipping pleasure.  The Bloody Mary was requested spicy as well and didn't disappoint!  The Loose Cannon was a fresh squeezed mulled jalapeno margarita recipe that I need to bring back to Texas!  It gives you a nice pucker with a hint of fire on your tongue.\\n\\nThe food was also a delight to consume.  We started with a raw oyster sampler.  They were cleaned very well and nicely presented.  The only wish I had was that they had fresh horseradish with them, next time I will ask for that.  We moved on from there to share the shaved fennel salad and beet salads.  The kitchen even split them for us to keep their presentation in tack which I felt was very nice touch.  The beet salad was my preferred choice.  They played with flavor combinations and found a real winner here.  The bite of dill with the saltiness of feta was a great contrast to the roasted sweet beets.  The fennel was also fresh, light and pleasing.  For our main coursed we had the scallops and fried oysters.  The scallops had a perfect sear and were soft and delectable.  The oysters were lightly fried and paired so well with the crisp celery leaves and beautiful house made tartar sauce.  We were so delighted with our meals that we just had to try dessert, even though we really didn't need it.  But can I just say - holy happy taste buds - we were so glad we did.  That rhubarb shortcake was absolutely divine! \\n \\nI really couldn't have asked for a better evening.  It may have been one of the best dinner experiences I've had in a while.  I don't know if this is the norm for this place, but if so - I'm not sure who these people are that gave them a bad review.  I will certainly not hesitate to come back here when I'm in town.  Thank you Peir 6 chefs and staff, with Laska getting high honor, for a brilliant rainy evening!\\n\\n**If suggestion were requested - I'd get rid of a few of the very large TV's that seem to consume the bar/dining area and to serve up some fresh horseradish with those amazing oysters**"},{"name":"Yoree Korean Cuisine","address":"1700 W Parmer Ln","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"My first visit wasn't memorable.

Why do I keep going back?  Because it is freakin delicious!! Probably the best fried chicken in town and that I have ever had.  We have taken friends here, parents and other random people that come into town and every time it is always a hit! \\n\\nHow do they get the batter and skin so crispy and perfect?  and all at the same time keeping the chicken so moist?  I have no clue, but it is working well for them.  The flavor of the batter is slightly spicy and so good that if they just sold their battered chicken skin my fiance and I would buy by the bag full.  Seriously now - I think this is the best fried chicken around! \\n\\nI always get the fried green tomatoes, they are a must.  The batter on these is super crispy, but be careful they are usually pretty hot when they come out.  You can drown it in ranch to help cool it off if you need to.  The mac and cheese is my favorite side from here for sure!  The other sides for me are hit or miss, but I don't really come here for the sides to be honest!  It is the all about the chicken ... and the pie ... oh yes the pie! The chess pie I got on my first visit as I had never had chess pie and was intrigued.  I have had buttermilk many, many times throughout my life, but not chess.  Chess is made with corn meal, but similar to buttermilk.  It is yummy!  Oh and get the scoop of ice cream on top - it is worth it!  I honestly have not tried any of the other pies they offer because this one is so good!  \\n\\nAnother reason I think we tend to go here often with people is the price.  The prices are great!  For a 20 piece family meal it is $40.  This was plenty of chicken for 4 large dudes the other night and 1 lady (myself).  The sides are priced separate but are not bad at all as well. \\n\\nAnyway if you have not been to Gus's yet ... then you are missing out!"},{"name":"FLIP burger boutique","address":"1587 Howell Mill Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"FLIP Burger is one of my favorite burger joints in Atlanta!

So fun!\\n\\nRegarding food, I've loved every burger that I've tried but I always go back to the Oaxaca.

The onion rings are huge and the sweet potato tots are a crowd favorite too. Split the sampler with a friend if you want to try all 3 sides!\\n\\nDrinks are good too! The liquid nitrogren milkshakes are so fun, it comes out smoking from the kitchen. My favorite is the Strawberry Shortcake as it comes with chunks of cheesecake, but other ones I love are the Burnt Marshmallow and the Krispy Kreme. None of them disappoint - but beware these are RICH. Definitely more a dessert than a drink alongside your meal, so I always order my milkshake LAST after I've finished my burger and fries. The milkshakes can also be spiked I believe.

It's $99, but apparently catching these succulent scrappers is very costly now days. I have tried other restaurants and either the portions or too small or they have completely given up on serving this delicacy. In general, it's easier to find snow crab or Dungeness crab; this girl wanted thick and juicy Alaskan King Crab Legs! \\n\\nIt was everything I had hoped for with very large, meaty legs, precut for easy access to that delicious flesh; cooked perfectly and served with a small side of drawn butter. The crab dinner was 3/4 Lb of crab and was accompanied by coconut rice, green beans and tomatoes. It was about 5 large legs. \\n\\nTo start our meal we ordered the Crab dip. I was actually a little disappointed in this dip because it had more potato pieces than crab and I found the potato took away from the crab flavor. It's possible that maybe there just wasn't enough crab to adequately flavor the dip. It came with a generous portion of toasted pita style pizza wedges. For $15 I wouldn't reorder it. \\n\\nWe also ordered the Lobster Gnocchi. The lobster was perfectly cooked and very tasty, served on top of the gnocchi for presentation. The gnocchi was was cooked perfectly as well, but I found the tomato dill rose sauce a little boring.

This was the prized dish at the restaurant.  Recently the dish now comes with three waffles, one small piece of chicken, a substandard mousse and no fruit cup.  When we asked about it, we were first told the dish hadn't changed.  Then the story changed to we stopped serving the fruit cup because nobody ate the fruit.  When asked why they reduced the chicken to one piece they denied it ever had two.  So basically they have down graded what they served and kept the high price.\\n\\nThe other dish that was once a favorite but has had similar treatment is the quinoa avocado bowl.  They eliminated the pomegranate as a key ingredient and doubled the onion (making it inedible).  When asked about the change in the ingredients the server denied it.

Some of my friends ate here prior to my visit and they told me that the chicken was big and that a 3 piece was hard to finish & so I took their advice and got the two piece instead. The environment is pretty dope. It feels like a sports bar. The staff is super friendly and our server was excellent to us as we told him that it was our first time trying it.\\n\\nI ordered the two piece white and it comes with two sides; beans and slaw; and a slice of white bread. I'm not a fan of either of those so I decided to sub my sides for something I like which was fries and mac&cheese. They charge $0.50 to sub so in total I only spent $1 to sub for sides that I'd actually enjoy. The chicken was crispy on the outside and steaming juice as I bit into it. Definitely better than popeye's or church's chicken in my opinion. I feel like it has more flavor and it felt like it was made with love. That true southern soul food. That's the kind of feeling you get when you eat here. Soul. The fries were average, but fries are fries right? Regular salted fries are going to taste like regular salted fries. The mac&cheese was spectacular. Maybe it was the light seasoning they had on it but it was definitely super enjoyable. Also when you order sweet tea or soda, they let you keep the cup! Great place to go eat and get a souvenir too!\\n\\nOverall I'd definitely recommend this place to my peers.

So I finally got to try this place out, and unfortunately it was somewhat of a let-down.  Good BBQ, really salty brisket, solid ribs, overcooked sausage, lots of fresh bread, all for a premium price.  \\n\\nI like the cafeteria style set-up, I dig the sides are there for you to scoop on.  I opted to skip the sides @ $1.99 each and went straight for the meat.  The potato salad looked really appetizing, same with the mac-n-cheese.  The bread and fixings are at the end - very fresh and good, but it's the meat I'm dying to try. \\n\\nI asked for a sample and he cut me a smidgen of lean and fatty brisket.  Lean = dry, fatty = pretty good.  I got about 5-6 slices of brisket which was about 1lb, then got 2 pork ribs and half a jalapeno sausage link - which he said is made in-house.  Everything was peachy until the rang me up.....$33.50..!  \\n\\nYikes.  $33.50 for 5 brisket slices, 2 pork ribs, and half a sausage.  No sides, no drink.  I'm sorry but that's pretty steep if you ask me.  I hope it tastes as good as it costs.  \\n\\nSausage was a solid B, it just seemed overcooked to me.  Pork Ribs were fall off the bone and I'd say an A- grade.  The brisket was moist but the rub was very salty - - and that's the downer here.  If I pay premium price for BBQ then I expect premium quality taste all the way.  Everything should be an minimum of A- grade......but the brisket's saltiness was a big let-down.  It was moist, but very salty.  That's why this experience was just 3-stars A-OK.  \\n\\nThere are 3 sauces here - - which I did like, but they're all very sweet and taste similar to each other - - just a minor tweak to each (sweet has more sugar, hot has more spice).  I mixed all 3 together to find the right combination, but I couldn't get away from the sugary sweetness.  It would be nice if there was some variation between the 3 (meaning less sugar in 1 or 2) of them.  \\n\\nEven thought it's 3-stars I would still go back here and recommend this place, it's just some minor tweaks and adjustments.  I definitely want to try their poto-salad, it looked so tasty and may have dill in it?  I just hope the brisket's rub isn't too salty the 2nd time around."},{"name":"Blue Star Donuts","address":"1155 SW Morrison St, Ste 102","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"$20 for 6 donuts...while these are very high quality and taste delicious, it better walk itself in my mouth for that price. \\n\\nWe ordered the OG which we assumed was a basic glazed donut but it's actually a Horxata Glaze.

It's texture was very classic and very fresh.\\n\\nWe also got the buttermilk old fashioned which is a cake like donut that has an amazing crispness on the outside with fluffiness on the inside. Apparently it has the same glaze as the OG yet we didn't tase any citrus flavor. This was our favorite!\\n\\nThe Chocolate Almond Ganache is a chocolate lover's dream. They use 100% natural cocoa powder and the marcona almonds make the texture perfect.\\n\\nFinally we tried the blueberry cake, which was the sweetest out of the half dozen.

The fries are the thinly sliced fried do they were crispy. \\n- FUSION SPECIALTY BENTO BOX ($16): if you are looking for variety, then this is what you should order. It comes with your choice of three  sides, half a roll from the three they have listed, and a featured mini burger of the week. For my bento box, I chose the sides: edamame, fried pickles, and sweet & spicy Thai cucumbers.\\nI chose the Mark's Roll and the mini burger of the week was a mushroom Swiss burger.

I like the greens to balance all the meat on my plate \\n*Peach cobbler: A must have for those sweet cravings; not overwhelmingly sweet. If you get both peach cobbler and banana pudding, you might not have room for both, but it's oh so good\\n*Banana pudding: This is my favorite!!! I highly recommend it! I love the cookie on top, and use it to dip into the custard. Man oh man, a bite of the freshly sliced banana makes me happy\\n\\nAfter you have all the sides, go straight to the meat. There you will see all the meat waiting to be cut up. Here's your opportunity to admire the smoky aroma and decide the quantity sold by lbs. \\n\\n*Pork ribs: Appreciable smoke flavor and well-seasoned. The smoke penetrated into about 1/3 of the meat, which takes a long time to achieve. Meat is juicy, glazed, fatty, and readily falls off the bone. Surprisingly good! \\n*Brisket: The meat was tender and moist. We were given free burnt ends since it was around closing time. Woot woot! \\n*Sausage: Choice between original or jalapeno cheese sausages. I love the jalapeno cheese sausages - how can you refuse that cheesy, heated, savory bite \\n\\nIn regards to the sauces, they have sweet, spicy, and regular sauces; all three were equally delicious. They also have complimentary bread & pickled onions. If you're in love with everything, you can buy packages of rub & sauces for home. They also sell frozen briskets by the block ~ $17/lb and sausages (package of 10) that are about $1 each sausage.

The quality of the food is superb for its price and the variety of selections was impressive. Service was 9/10. Few things to watch out for, but you can't go wrong with most of the dishes. Having grown up on solely authentic Korean food, I can definitely say you're not going to find an all-you-can-eat for this price, quality, and authenticity in Austin!\\n\\nRound 1: Salads\\nI was quite surprised by the quality of salads at the buffet. Most of the ones I've been to offer build your owns, but the salads here are not only pre-made but delicious! I tried both the Asian-style Caesar salad and the imitation crab meat salad. Both were delectable and I went back for more the second round.\\n\\nRound 2: Meats\\nGenerally speaking, the meats were what you would expect from a Chinese/Korean buffet. If you want some solid galbi, orange chicken, fried nuggets, etc. you'll get that here. The tteok-galbi was exceptional. Be wary of the bossam (). The meat itself as well as the ssamjang (dipping sauce) was not very good. \\n\\nRound 3: Rice/Noodles\\nThe fried rice and stir-fried noodles were at best OK. I've definitely had better at buffets, but then again this is not what you want to be eating the most of at buffets so focus your time elsewhere.\\n\\nRound 4: Sushi\\nThis was probably one of the best parts of the buffet. For a buffet, they have quite an arrangement of sushi ranging from your classic California rolls to tiger rolls and spicy tuna rolls. If you look around the middle they have hand rolls, too! The spicy rolls were a little spicier than I expected but still very good. Flavor is great for all the rolls!\\n\\nRound 5: Seafood\\nThis was probably the pitfall of the buffet. The seafood was not good. The fish fillet was bland and whatever they put on top didn't help it any. The crab was not seasoned properly and had very little meat. This is usually where you get your \\"money's worth\\" at a buffet, but it'll be an uphill battle at this location.\\n\\nRound 6: Desserts\\n\\nThe desserts here are also not very good. Virtually everything is too dry (cakes/bread). Go for the fruit because they were surprisingly sweet and ripe. The pineapple was the best for me (it also helps with digestion!)\\n\\nService - Was seated quickly and everything we requested was brought promptly. Only issue was when we paid and forgot about the coupon, they refused to redo the check. It was our fault for forgetting, but most restaurants will void the transaction and redo it to include the discount but we were told they couldn't do that. The waitress still seemed genuinely apologetic so all is forgiven.

Secondly, it took over 20 minutes to get two pitchers of sangria (which is understandable to an extent, since it was so busy), but we watched them sit on a side table while she talked with another server. She then walked over and took our food order before we even got the drinks, and then finally, several minutes later, brought us the drinks. She took food away from the table before we were even halfway done, and even grabbed a plate while someone at our table literally had a fork in her hand (and was just pausing to converse with another person). The worst was when we asked for water and she just took the water pitcher and filled our DIRTY empty sangria glass with water and left it for us to pass around instead of filling our individual glasses (we didn't drink it obviously - there was actual FRUIT floating in it). Lastly she put the check in front of the youngest person at the table, and then after another person paid, put it back in front of the youngest.

I don't understand why the kitchen didn't tell the waitstaff that they were out. It is a limited menu and the problem could have been resolved before it became a problem. I ended up with a mediocre fish and chips which was overly salted. My guest ordered a caesar salad and grilled chicken sandwich. The salad had wilted greens and the grilled chicken was mayonnaise with some chicken. Unbelievable in a restaurant such as this!  He returned the sandwich which was replaced with a steak sandwich however,  a steakhouse should have been ashamed to serve the reheated steak cooked well done.

I received a complimentary mackerel appetizer to wet the pallet and immediately knew this was going to be a special meal. As I bit into each plate I could taste the chef's balance of salt, fat and acidity perfectly.  As each course came afterwards they seemed to keep trumping the next, which was hard to believe.  Because of this fact it was hard to pick out my favorite dishes because each was truly was amazing. If had to pick I would say the \\"Shishito Pepper T√≥male\\" and the \\"Tomato, Blueberry, Grains, Green Chile Salad\\" we're best of all. I will have to dine off the main menu the next time I am here, and there will most certainly be plans for a next time, as I am told it is equally appealing.

I called the place a couple times and apparently the driver got lost on the delivery before mine. The owner apologized and promised a free entree for my troubles.\\nThe food was surprisingly fantastic! The Naan was huge and flooded with cilantro, the Rose Lassi rocked!, the Keer was superb, the tandoori chicken knocked my socks off, and the chicken tiki masala was to die for! Don't worry, I didn't eat all this myself. I had help from my BF Kenny.\\nIf you want great Indian food downtown, (for the Love of God) don't eat Haveli downtown but give Chutneys a try.

My friends and I actually came here based on the yelp reviews and we were not disappointed. Yelp said they play live music, there was a man playing the guitar. Yelp said atmosphere is slightly hipster/casual, that's pretty true. People tend to be on their laptops doing school work and what not. Yelp said their food was worth it, and yet they are right once again. \\n\\nI highly recommend the Shrimp and Grits! It is pure perfection with the grits being the right consistency and the shrimp having the right amount of spice. They are also quite generous with the amount of shrimp given in the plate (approx. 10). I would give my plate a 10/10. My two friends got their Crawfish Egg Benedict and said that it was tasty. My other friend got a normal burger and said it was juicy. They all gave their dishes an 8/10. \\n\\nOnly downfall with this place is that they are pretty slow with bringing out everyone's food. They did it one by one, so by the time someone was done, they brought out another person's plate. They also forgot my friends order, so he actually had to go in and bring the plate out to the patio himself.

The chatsu was very tender and its fat was well rendered.  However, it tasted too strongly of soy and it overpowered the delicious inherent flavor of the pork belly.

When the mussels arrived I was immediately struck by the lack of broth.  Then we tried them, and discovered they were simply inedible.

The waitress said the chef may come talk to us, but that never happened. \\n\\nThe appetizer was a complete failure, but I was hopeful for the main course. My hopes were dashed in one bite of the Bucatini all amatriciana. The undercooked pasta sat in a pool of grease, and again was completely inedible.

You need more distance between the tables, or just less tables. Yeah, you don't make as much in the short term, but you will have more satisfied customers that will come back, leading to a more successful restaurant. \\n\\n2.  If you are going to provide bread with dinner, provide more than three minuscule slices of a baguette. If that is going to break the bank, then charge for the bread. Whatever you do, make it good. The bread provided was tasteless. \\n\\n3.  I am not sure if your chef was having a bad night or what, but the food was terrible.  I don't say that lightly.

The thing absurd is when they see us fight for the bill, they decided that we don't know we've been charged for tip, so they didn't print out the tip charge in credit card slip, expecting us the pay more tip. I did actually, leaving 20 on top of that, considering my friend won the tab picking up game, I were about to tip 40 to 50. Since the moment they see me put out the cash, they quickly come over to clean everything on the table even many of the group still out there looking for fruit or dessert. We have to pick up the fruit with hands.Grandparents and kids are happy, so I think it still worth 3 stars.

I had been gone from my bf for the week and happened to be with our mutual roommate so we FaceTimed him to say hi from the bar after a long week... Right away the bartender (I believe her name was Rachel) started yelling \\"You should snap my sign! Get a video of my sign!\\".. I thought she was being funny so I did pan the phone to look and to my surprise it was a sign that stated \\"limited cell phone use FaceTime/speaker\\" and right away I felt bad and sorry and turned my phone off on my bf... but it didn't stop there... she continued to go on a huge rant with everyone seated at the bar explaining the importance as to why you don't FaceTime or talk on the phone at the bar... which again, I get.. but it was just a bit \\"above and beyond\\"... I get you made it clear what the rules were I obliged and yet you still had to put on a show?.. anyways I ordered a second drink and asked what the wells/house vodka was and the other lady bartender told me it was Tito's so I ordered another Tito's vodka soda tall... my tab ended up being 27 something for 2 drinks...

The blonde (possibly Rachel) in a condescending attitude said it's because we pour an ounce and a quarter.. which I responded with \\"ok I just wasn't sure..

Mainly bc I love meat and most vegan dishes I've seen on the internet didn't look appetizing.  So when I heard all the ladies in the salon raving about this spot I decided I must check it out.  I got the spicy kale wrap and not only was it delicious and packed full of flavor, it was huge, and it was filling.  I love the textures as well because they make the wrap complete so you don't feel like it's missing something (like meat since I'm an omnivore and usually always have meat with most meals).  On a serious note, this wrap has me considering trying to eat vegan more often.  Even my fianc√© loved it.  Lastly, kudos for the location! I think that often in communities of lower socioeconomic background the food options made available are usually unhealthy and fried (church's and other fast food chains) so the fact that this is an affordable option that allows the community in that area a chance to eat more healthy is a plus! Tassili, we need more locations and more people willing to educate society and the black community about healthy eating.\\n\\nP.S. I started getting the spicy kale wrap mixed to even out inconsistencies in how spicy it is each time I order it.  I now get 90% mild and 10% spicy.  My only issue with this place is it's not consistent with spice level.  One day it's perfect, the next inedible it's so hot, the next it could be mild almost.

These giant hot dogs are placed on a giant grilled bun, sliced down the middle and loaded with condiments like chili, onions, mustard, and their special bbq type sauce.

Now, keep in mind that this place is one of the most popular restaurants in Columbus!  We drove around the beautiful German neighborhood and watched part of a movie in the minivan while we waited.\\n\\nOnce we were inside and seated (no easy feat), our cute waitress immediately started our drink orders.  Of course, we ordered beer.  I asked her what the most popular beer was and it was their 'house dark', which I promptly ordered 22 ounces of.  \\n\\nThe ambience, artwork, and history here is unmatched elsewhere.  The beer was flowing, the food smelled and looked delicious, it was jam-packed, and the German spirit was alive and well here, 128 years after it was built!\\n\\nI definitely wanted schnitzel, but I wasn't sure what kind to get.  The waitress recommended Wienerschnitzel as it is their most popular dish.  I usually take the advice of restaurant staff when it comes to meals and drinks and tonight was no exception.  Interestingly, Schmidt's has a buffet, which offers all the sides that are on the menu, including sausage and excluding schnitzel.  Sorry!  If you want schnitzel, you have to order it from the menu.  And that's what most of us did.  However, a few in our party ordered the buffet.\\n\\nThe menu has a rule: 'If you eat at the buffet, please do not share your food with other guests\\".  Well, I must admit that we broke that rule.  The various sausages were quite tasty.  \\n\\nBut nothing I tasted at Schmidt's came anywhere near close to the amazing flavor of the sausage stew.\\n\\nGet in your car, drive to Schmidt's and try this sausage with noodles.  Actually, dump the noodles on the floor and keep the sausage.  If you accidentally drop the sausage on the floor, I'll still eat it!  The seasoning in the sausage of the sausage stew was one of the most savory, sweet, spicy, and delicious things I've ever tasted.  The flavor of this sausage created a new genre of 'good' in my brain.  I mean, it was like the first time I tasted good barbecue.  Just wow!  It's that good.  And I didn't even order the sausage stew, I simply tried some of my sisters.  Loved it!  See!  Good things do happen when you break the rules!\\n\\nWe ordered a couple creme puffs to go.

The wipeout is basically a surf and turf in a taco form. The voodoo comes in the option of either fried, grilled, or blackened. I prefer fried as it gives an extra crunch to the taco. Also, their mojo fries are a must have. The zestiness of the sauce and seasoning of the fries makes this the perfect side order. \\n\\nPrice: Tacos range from $3-4 per taco but they come with a bedding of chips. I got a big appetite and two orders always leaves me satisfied.\\n\\nService: This is a self order and seat yourself kind of ordeal but the food comes out pretty fast.\\n\\nAtmosphere: Very chill environment, great place to eat with friends and socialize over some great tacos.\\n\\nOverall I love Jimmy Hula's!

I ordered a caipirinha which was weak, didn't have enough muddled lime and I wouldn't order it again. We ordered the Pelua arepa which was good but it lacked seasoning, however, the beef was tender and the arepa was fresh. The tostones were excellent and the sun-dried tomato sauce had a slight kick which was enjoyable once we were able to try it. The waitress brought these to the table with an empty dish on the plate and we asked if it came with the sauce. She didn't seem to realize what was missing and went to ask the kitchen what else came with the dish... I would have loved if the tostones were blotted so they were not so greasy though. We each ordered the Parrilla Caraquena. We ordered the steak medium rare---on the rarer side, especially when it's not a thick piece of meat. It was so overdone, I wanted to send it back. I feel like that's always awkward to do but I hate when people can't cook a steak properly. The chicken was fine, something an amateur cook could make at home and the chorizo was not house-made.

Either they feel they are putting too much chicken in it (which they aren't) or something that is causing them to serve small side portion sizes.

We got the Zuni roll with potato salad on the side and the Parish Chicken Sandwich with cole slaw on the side and a couple of local beers. The Zuni roll was pretty good and a unique take on a wrap but nothing to write home about. The turkey was essentially just deli meat but the cranberry sauce is delicious. I was originally annoyed that the wrap sits in the sauce and gets soggy but the sauce is tasty enough to overlook that! The potato salad on the side was the star. Thick cut red potatoes with just enough mayo to make it creamy but not too much that it overshadows the potato. The Parish Chicken Sandwich was okay.

I learned about it from FoodSpotting app which had special for 50% off. I am giving this place a 2 because the food was edible and filled my tummy, fast service, friendly server, and clean place. This is not authentic Greek. I ordered gyro wrap with Greek salad with Sprite. The salad came first. It was smothered with dressing (not cool) and I think the vegetables could of been fresher and more colorful. I still ate all of it because I was hungry and the loaded feta cheese made the salad yummy. In few minutes (fast service), my gyro came. The gyro meat is both lamb and beef, according to my server. The gyro wrap had little meat and mostly loaded with veggie toppings like lettuce, onion, tomato, dressing. I ate all of it because it was good in average sense; it is not \\"quality, sophisticated\\" good. The food is supposed to be around $9.50 but because of the app special, I paid half price. I wouldn't be happy if I had to pay full price because it was not worth it. With that price $9.50 (maybe a few cents more or less) I could get sophisticated, large, extra meaty, well put together, professional and authentic gyro somewhere else with nice atmosphere like Myokonos Tavern which is just two minutes away and actually an authentic Greek restaurant.

Quality-wise, food is made the morning of and I think it's good for what it is. Bear in mind that this is a caf√© and not a Michelin-star restaurant. My personal fave is the Beef dip sandwich accompanied by a bowl of soup. For the indecisive, they let you sample the soups before signing your life away. Value-wise, Stock up is above average.

Creamy, nutty and spicy.  We opted for a medium spice level with chili on the side.  I thought it was perfect - you knew the heat was there but could still enjoy it.  The Lamb Saag was great, super tender.  Saag is generally my favorite, it was just out-shined this time.  \\n\\nNaan...this is the first time I've actually used (all) naan to soak up my meal.

A true Pac NW Icon that will leave a void in the hearts of anybody that has one. While back in town and driving by the old location I looked over to pay homage to a legendary pizza joint only to see that there was another pizza place and its spot.  I had to look it up. The Smokey's name, menu, and decor were all mentioned so I had to look further. I saw pics on this website. I saw a pepperoni pizza that looked familiar... I saw a Hot oven Combo that took me back to my youth! Could it be true? No, not possible. Is Smokey's hiding in plain view with another name? The phone was right there so an order had to be placed immediately. I was greated by an extremely friendly person over the phone and both a Pepperoni and Hot Oven Combo were ordered. My mouth was already watering in anticipation. Getting these two pies home was the longest 10 minutes of my life. There I was, standing in front of a pizza box, ready to open it, expecting the Golden Glow like the briefcase in Pulp Fiction. I opened the box and although similar, I knew it wasn't the same. The pepperoni wasn't the same, the sauce wasn't the same, the crust may have been although I wasn't sure. Same goes for the Combo. Similar but not the same. I think we all agreed that it was a good pizza and maybe my memories have elevated Smokey's a bit but I doubt it. I'd go back for sure. Had a beer while waiting and it was Ice Cold.

I know a few years ago they revamped their menu and I have been a frequent, local visitor ever since. There's nothing quite like strolling around the resort with a beignet in hand (and their chocolate chicory dipping sauce in the other) listening to the big band atmosphere music. Unless, of course, you decide to sit down with a massive bowl of their shrimp and grits. I was honestly beyond shocked when I saw both the process of how FRESH and QUICKLY they made this. They make it from scratch! The grits are the only thing pre-made (pre-prepped rather?), but still done in house for breakfast lunch and dinner. Then they sit in their giant pot just begging to be slopped out and devoured. All of it is thrown into this big wok-like pan and created before your eyes. This is especially nice if their are any ingredients you care to omit, or even add! For myself, I was sure to add plenty of extra mushrooms. I am honestly getting hungry all over again just writing this review and looking at this picture. I try shrimp and grits any time it is featured on a menu, as it is my absolute favorite dish of all time. To think that I can come to this place and get an almost unbelievably authentic version of this meal that makes me feel so at home, and at such an affordable price, is something I don't take for granted.

We ordered a variety of tacos including shrimp, pork belly, duck, Portabella mushroom and guacamole. The pork belly tacos stole the show ...marinated, crispy, crunchy, sweet,... they were awesome. Shrimp tacos for the wife and kids. Loved em! Duck tacos were great but could've used a little bit more flavor. Maybe hoisin sauce would have rounded out flavor. They were Juicy and well cooked, but not a ton of flavor with minimal toppings. Wife said portobello mushroom was just OK. It could've been marinated more, and possibly grilled, but instead they were rather bland. Guoc was good and fresh, whole family ate it up pretty quickly. That said, could've had more onions more cilantro more garlic, or at least offered us the option of adding ingredients to our taste. This takes me to the weak spot of this restaurant. The food was good overall, fresh tasty and enjoyable. However the service was 'meh' at best. Our waiter was relatively nice, but as I think back on our experience from the time we walked in to greet the hostess, the trip to the bar, to our waiter, not a single person in the entire restaurant ever smiled. It became tedious to ask for plates to share food, a fork, or a drink refill. To me this speaks to leadership. This restaurant would be a runaway hit if it was just about the food and ambiance but there's something lacking about how leadership trains and educates the staff on how to treat customers. As they say in the restaurant business, people come for the food, they return for the service. The service was sterile at best. It felt like Kim Jong Un was the GM. By the end of our meal, it began to feel like this place was staffed by automatons. I want this restaurant to be a success.

For a Sunday afternoon on a fairly busy street, I was surprised to see that there weren't many folks dining, but we were craving barbecue and really wanted to give this place a try.\\n\\nSince there was no wait, we were seated right away by a helpful server who ended up explaining a few menu items to us when we were perusing our options. We both ended up ordering whiskey mules (delicious for the warmer day!), and I ended up getting the fried chicken sandwich with a side of potato gratin, and my husband got a brisket sandwich with a side of their mac and cheese.\\n\\nWhen our food arrived, we were pretty much blown away with the flavors. The chicken was nice and crispy but not dry at all on the inside, and that potato gratin was AMAZING. The mac and cheese was also enjoyable (although we both agreed the potato gratin was the winner in terms of sides here - it would be tough to beat!), and my husband said his brisket sandwich was very satisfying.\\n\\nThis is a nice spot for a meal, and I think prices were reasonable, as well.

I thought I just found another awesome restaurant to add to the rotation.... then the experience changed slowly over the course of the night.  Our waiter didn't seem in the best mood but we were happy and having a good time so didn't really pay too much attention...but then ... as the dinner went on we noticed that he missed a course for two of our party.  So we mentioned it and the waiter actually seemed almost to argue a bit and was like ok I'll get the kitchen to make it for you now...but we had already eaten our mains and the table was getting ready for dessert so the guests didn't want to have starters at that point.  Then when the bill came, he tried to not show us the bill prior to taking our cards.  We paid our half of the bill without thinking or looking over the bill but then when our other guest went to pay and asked to look at the bill he said why should I pay for the three course menu when you only gave me two courses?  He argued for a bit and then said I'll get the manager.  The manager then told us that he would deduct $9 and just charge us the other dishes at the \\"a la carte\\" price.  However, I pointed out that the real problem is that the waiter did not try to resolve this and tried to sneak us into paying for something we didn't have... and it was his fault he didn't put the order in correctly.  There is proof all over the place since the tickets into the kitchen would show he only entered two dishes and that there isn't even a 2 course menu option...so it's just overall strange to only resolve what shouldve happened in the first place.  We bought cocktails, we bought two bottles of wine each $100 and overall we were not a super fussy table so it was weird to have the waiter argue with us over this simple resolution.  He never appeared near our table or the restaurant in the front of the house prior to us leaving.  We dine often all over the city and at fine dining restaurants all the time and I have never gone to a restaurant with such beautiful surroundings, great food... and yet with such poor poor service.  In fact I'm shocked that the manager also didn't do anything to resolve the issue that the waiter was clearly trying to get it passed us and that he showed poor attitude.  I won't be returning to this restaurant.

The beef in both bowls was good, with a sufficient amount of moist, juicy, tender beef. I liked the thinner noodles better though, because while I felt like they were slightly undercooked/hard in both bowls, it was a lot more noticeable in my thicker noodles. My clear broth was also quite light, did not seem like it was flavoured with MSG. Also ordered the shredded soft dried pork & egg wrap which was phenomenal, and which I think was probably the best I've ever had anywhere, ever. I loved that it was not greasy at all, but wasn't dry either, and was so delicious. The pan fried sliced radish cake was okay but nothing to rave about. Prices are typical for a casual Asian dining chain. If I lived in Vancouver I would probably come again, it gets the job done at a reasonable price - would have liked the noodles to be cooked a little longer, but other than that I guess I can see why the awards were won."},{"name":"Terry Black's Barbecue","address":"1003 Barton Springs Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"What we ordered jalape√±o cheddar sausage, brisket, turkey breast, pork rib, beef rib, mac & cheese, green beans, corn bread, creamed corn, and banana pudding. \\n\\nBest dish for me was the pork ribs.

I go to Spelman College and during my last semester I came here at least 50 times. Probably 100. Literally. Anyway, let me bottom line it. The food is INCREDIBLE. I am addicted to the kale wraps and cannot stop coming back. It's like a secret addiction. I'm not sure if it's the yeast they use or whatever but I knew I had a problem when I saved pictures of the wraps on my phone to lust after in my spare time. I would recommend getting a mixed wrap. One time I got the spicy wrap only to suffer from extreme pain and a reddened face. I had to drink juice for 30 min to no avail. While the food is amazing and addictive, the service is ok. It definitely has improved. I have had completely wrong wraps made for me, wraps not made at all, or waiting literally for an hour when I called ahead. There have been times when they only took cash and my addiction forced me to go to the bank. I have not experienced ANY of this recently though.

I apologize for the extreme length of this review but feel it's necessary to truly explain the horrific experience. The first hint something was amiss was the patio doorknob came off in my husband's hand. We later learned this meant those dining outside could not get back in through the same door, no big deal. We sat at a lovely patio table facing the lake. I did notice that there were two large metal patio covers, one over each section of tables. A server greeted us rather unenthusiastically but again, no biggie. We ordered drinks, mine was a double vodka, soda, cranberry. When they came out, mine was a a tiny short glass. I asked to make sure it was a double as I am not used to seeing short doubles, server assured me it was. Upon tasting, it was weak, even for a single. I had my husband, who has been a bartender for 18+ years try it and he agreed it was weak but we just decided that I wouldn't order another mixed drink. \\n\\nAs we were deciding what to eat, my husband noticed rain across the lake and remarked that it would raining on us soon. As we were covered we weren't too concerned but within literally moments that would all change. It began to pour rain and blow horizontally at us. Not a second or two later both huge, metal patio covers lifted way up off the ground, well over our heads. That's right, they were not secured at all. I immediately jumped out of my chair, grabbed my purse and rain inside calling for my husband to follow. I was actually scared for my life. As soon as I got inside, one of the four steel poles of the cover slammed down right into the chair which I had just left. Terrifying!! My husband was able to run in carrying our drinks. The entire staff did not seem too concerned though the hostess did apologize as she sat us at an inside table. I would have at least expected a manager to come around, but nothing. I was literally shaking but we stayed and ordered our food anyway as we were starving. \\n\\nMy husband ordered a burger topped with an egg and I the chicken club sandwich. Soon after we started to eat, my husband said that the lettuce on his burger tasted chemical. He said like model car glue/super glue. Even after removing the lettuce it tasted weird, to me like soap. It was gross. He was so hungry that he ate it anyway. Side note - He never got to ask for condiments or get a refill on his tea before finishing because the server never came to check on us. He had to get up, go to the bar and ask another server for s refill. My meal was just okay. \\n\\nFinally server came and I ordered a glass of Pinot Grigio. The menu stated it was $4, which I thought was an awesome price. Finished the wine, got our check and we were charged $6 for wine. No big deal, we thought but mentioned it to the server when she came back. This is where it got weird. She looked at the menu and said, \\"Oh no, the menu is wrong. All glasses are $6. It's a new menu.\\" She then just looked at us like we were expected to know that and pay the $6. After everything that happened that day and not complaining once, we were not going to let this go too. She seemed extremely irritated and said something like, \\"I guess I could ask the manager but I'm not sure they will change it because it is $6.\\" We were like, omg. So she comes back and says, \\"We changed it but for future reference when you guys come back, it's $6.\\" To this I said, \\"Oh, we won't be back.\\" The server looked very personally offended and asked, \\"Why not?\\" I unleashed everything that had happened to her and her response was yelling, \\"I can't control the weather!\\" She then turned around and walked away and into the back. I commented that she could control her attitude. I am purposely leaving out the server's name as to not get her in trouble but she really needs to treat her customers better or she has no business being in the service industry. (A job I did for years and my husband still does.)\\n\\nIn hindsight, we should have sent the burger back and definitely complained to a manager but we just wanted a relaxing meal. What we got was the polar opposite. Beware if you eat here, especially sitting on the patio. It's seriously a law suit waiting to happen."},{"name":"FLIP burger boutique","address":"1587 Howell Mill Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Excellent food and excellent service!

We began with the Queso A La Mexicana, labeled as \\"melted cheese with guacamole, pico de gallo and tortilla chips,\\" which we took to mean as all those things being *IN* the queso. Nnnoooo. What came out was a tiny ramekin of bland queso, some decent pico, and very sad guacamole that needed seasoning. Disappointing start, but the frozen margaritas were awesome, so at least there were those.\\n\\nFor dinner we shared the Dona Maria (essentially an enchilada trio) and the burrito with chicken fajita. The enchiladas were spectacular: each one was bursting with flavor and all the meat was tender. Great beans too! The burrito was...we hate to say...awful. The chicken was chewy and in massive pieces and there wasn't much \\"burrito\\" to it--just seemed like they wrapped some fajitas up in a tortilla with a wet bean sauce and called it a day.\\n\\nBottom line: this place is really cute and seems to have that mom-and-pop Austin spirit.

As my friend put it in regards to the corn, \\"it's like they took corn and added corn to it!\\"\\n\\nWe tried an assortment of meats including beef ribs, pork ribs, and brisket. The beefy ribs (of note, you have to order it by the bone which might end up being 1.5 lbs / bone) were absolutely incredible - rich in flavor, super tender and fell right off the bone. The pork ribs were mediocre, I was not particularly impressed by the dry rub of the way it was cooked. The meat was a tad tough for pork ribs. The brisket was quite solid - it wasn't the most tender or flavorful, but it was cooked quite well. It went perfectly with their house BBQ sauce.\\n\\nOverall, Terry Black's BBQ has me excited for the remaining food adventures of the week. The meats were decent, I was a big fan of the beefy ribs.

You can all sit together and enjoy BURGERS as is our basic human right!  Gone are the days of going to the burger joint and feeling bad for your vegetarian friend as they stare forlornly at their black bean patty that was cooked from frozen and is soggy and cold in the middle.  Flip Burger gives great tasting burger options to all, no matter what your eating persuasion.  AND, if you happen to like the taste of a beef burger, but don't want the consequences (environmental or dietary*) of actually eating a beef burger, THEY HAVE THE IMPOSSIBLE BURGER!!!\\n\\nfood/drink: My wife and I decided to have a bite with an old friend, and we ended up deciding on Flip Burger.  I typically avoid burger places as my wife is a vegan, and the only animals I eat come from the sea (technically called a pescatarian, but I dislike labels).  Yes, I know this is a change if you read my previous reviews, but my doctor insisted and I trust the guy who I pay to keep me alive.  In any case, I read the menu for Flip and decide, what the heck.  The place has a full bar, lots of different overpriced cocktails, and a cool selection of microbrews.  The food menu is where the magic happens.  Our friend had an Impossible Burger, my wife had the fauxlafel (see what they did there?) burger, and I had the shrimp burger.  No one left a SINGLE crumb.  My shrimp burger was literally shrimp fused into a burger patty with a fried lemon on top.  Delicious!  According to our friend, the fries were also amazing.  But more awesome is the fact that there are more sides than fries!  I wanted the sweet potato tots, but the voice of my doctor inside my head made me choose the grilled cauliflower.  Luckily, it was delightful.\\n\\nservice:  We arrived at 11:15am on a Saturday morning, so your mileage may vary.  We were greeted and seated instantly.  Food came out within minutes.  Extra points for giving my kiddo a plastic cup of water and crayons.  Server was personable and engaging.\\n\\nambiance: It's west midtown, so hipsters.  Plenty of free parking.  Howell Mill can be a traffic nightmare at rush hour, so don't plan on making a southbound left turn into this place.  The decor is modern, neat and clean, but nothing stands out.  A few TV's above the bar properly tuned into CNN.\\n\\nx-factor:  I will be back.  Great food and great food options are a big deal to me.  Atlanta is getting there, slowly but surely.  Flip Burger is now officially on my short list.\\n\\n*My daughter reminds me that in terms of calories, fat, and likely sodium, the Impossible burger duplicates everything that's wrong with a beef burger minus the cholesterol.

With its close-in location, BB should be a stop on anyone's brew tour of Portland. \\n\\nAs far as a place that will continue to draw me back on the regular, BB does lack a few options that tend to keep me hooked on drinking establishments. For one, no booze. For two, the menu doesn't really guarantee many vegetarian options (which complicates things since I often hang out with folks who don't eat the meat). \\n\\nAside from these two minor complications, Burnside Brewing is definitely a place I can get behind. The bar has an upscale, gastropub feel (which to me is weird for a place that only serves beer) and the menu is designed to match. The dishes are creative and even push here and there into the molecular gastronomy realm. For instance, we heard they were injecting their pastrami with brine to get it to cure faster, and the duck cohiba with edible \\"ash\\" stands out well above anything you're going to see at your average PDX brewpub. For as adventurous as the food is, I have yet to be totally blown away by it, but I can see from the reviews that others are, so that's awesome!\\n\\nThe beer itself is good. And I like good beer.

I am so glad I tried it because this is now one of my favorite dinner spots in Atlanta!! My friend and I got to Desta around 9pm on a Monday, and it was quite lively. We were seated at the bar at first, but then the nice hostess found us a table. Our waiter did a great job of explaining the menu to us. We ended up ordering two signature entrees--one with lamb tibs, the other with tilapia. Both were cooked with yummy spices and saut√©ed onions. Along with the meat, we got tomato fitfit (a cold cubed tomato paste), ater (a yummy corn soup), rice, and injerea (spongey bread). I've never had anything like injera before, but we ate with our hands as our waiter instructed and put it all together on the injera! So delicious, this is the best meal I've had in AGES! Another really cool thing about Desta is that they have Ethiopian beer and wine.\\n\\nThis place is totally authentic.

It's a wonderful place to grab lunch for salads or sandwiches. For someone who's never been I might describe it as a much better (and non-chain) Panera style food. Soup, sandwiches, salads, and a few extra things here and there. \\n\\nThings I love:\\n- Salads are huge! Truly a meal salad, even without meat. \\n- Awesome drink selection. Wide variety of cans and bottles. They carry Clearly Canadian.  \\n- Bread is fresh and delicious. I'm obsessed with their sourdough especially. \\n- Variety of topping choices.\\n- Plenty of vegan, vegetarian, and dairy free options. \\n- Ample searing for the building size. Low key outdoor tables. \\n\\nThe things I don't love:\\n- Menu is listed on the wall on opposite sides. When it's busy it's REALLY hard to read because people sit/stand in front of it. The first two times I went I honestly couldn't see half of the menu. It was overwhelming as a new customer. \\n- Dessert: it always looks and sounds delicious. But I've tried three different things, and they've all been lackluster. The cheesecake tasted like it had been sitting in a refrigerator without being covered. \\n\\nOverall, I really love Brown Bag and will continue coming in.  My advice is skip the dessert.

REALLY????, you couldn't tell us that before we ordered or when the bartender came to our table to confirm the drinks we wanted. Then a manager-like person came to say we had to pay full price.  So, for the cost of about $2.50 (full vs discounted price) x 6 people, you lost 2 stars in my review.\\n\\nHopefully the owner (Mr. Smalls) will let his staff know that it's good service to be upfront and tell customers when they are not eligible for a certain discount. Especially when they ask for (repeatedly) a certain special.  As I stated before, the food, especially the greens, cabbage and pork chops (despite the small size) were good.

The sweetness of the sourdough was just right to where you could eat it on it's own with just the whip cream and not have to use syrup.

The couple who we walked in with had already paid and left, and here we were getting our first dish.\\nMy girlfriend was upset, you could definitely see it on her face. I told her, foods here let it go, maybe the service will pick up now that we are on their radars. They should be treating us as VIP's now, check up on us, fill our waters, ask if we would like another beverage; or so i would think.

Unfortunately, I was disappointed with how things turned out. I'll start with the positives. The food was served hot and the waitresses assigned to my party were accommodating. That's about it for the good. Now, for the bad. It was extremely difficult to plan a private event here. The private events coordinator is basically unreachable. Apparently, she manages all the locations and therefore cannot meet with you in person to show you the space, plan an event etc. I am fine with e-mails and phone calls but needed just one in person meeting to talk out the details, see the space etc. She did say she could meet with me on one day, but only gave me a day's notice and a two-hour window to meet her. Sorry, I am busy too and couldn't make that work with such short notice. Despite this, I still decided to hold my event here based on the reviews. This event was a surprise, therefore I showed up early to decorate the private room. When I walked in, NOTHING was organized. There were tables and chairs still dirty from the night before and no one knew what was going on. I had to basically set up the room myself with the help of my friends. We moved chairs, arranged tables etc. I mentioned in my e-mails that I am a stickler for details and presentation. Also, the event coordinator was not present to facilitate anything. I paid for open bar, but there was no bartender which meant the drinks had to be ordered from the waitress or poured ourselves from the wine/beer on the designated bar table. I don't think you should ever have guests pouring their own alcohol - what a waste and liability! Some of the wrong food came out too - things I did not order or want. Again, not the kitchen or waitresses' fault.

Weren't that impressed with the sides... The beans did not feel like they were cooked all the way through. Mac & cheese was just OK. Corn was just OK. Definitely a must eat in Austin. Next time though I would reduce the sides... I.e. maybe just get one coleslaw so I can load up on more ribs!!

The vestibule checking area is too small and makes the check in process challenging. \\nOnce inside, there's various rooms you can sit and and a small bar right behind the checking stand. We sat upstairs which was more enjoyable to not be on top of other tables. Overall the food was on par with your standard mall food court Chinese offering. We had the egg rolls, poke, orange chicken and a kids noodle dish. The only good and palatable item were the egg rolls. The poke was literally inedible. It was really bad with an overly bitter and acrid taste (definitely not fresh tuna) - we sent it back. The orange chicken was bland and was likely the same stuff you get frozen in a bag at Walmart. The kids noodle dish was super bland but it was the kids dish so not looking for super gourmand. \\n\\nI am disappointed that we chose this option for our lunch  and would not recommend."},{"name":"Whole Heart Provisions","address":"1350 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4.5","text":"The best vegan bowls in the square!

It was actually not really all that stormy.  Windy, yes.  Dark, sure, because it was wintertime and my daylight hours are spent in an office.  So really, it was a cold, windy night that happened to be dark and there were tiny flurries for a split second.  \\n\\nBut you have to admit, it sounds better the first way, right?\\n\\nSo there Jeremy K. and I were, a bit early for our reservation at Myers + Chang, rushing in out of the (dark, stormy) wind and cold, and immediately I was impressed by the place.  The decor was perfect, the vibe was fun, and the placemats were Chinese newspapers.   There were crazy straws available.  It was the best possible combination of funky and classy.  \\n\\nAnd then there was the menu.  \\n\\nI spent some time before going to dinner looking over the menu, trying to figure out what I would want to order when I got there.  Even with all that planning, by the time I got inside the restaurant and held the menu in my hands, I wanted to try so many things.  Everything jumped out at me.  I was beyond overwhelmed, but in the best possible way.\\n\\nThe braised belly pork buns... can I just say, \\"wow\\"?  OK, I just did.  What can top \\"wow\\"?  How about \\"MORE?\\"  Let's just say that I was thrilled that there were more than one on the plate.    And then another plate arrived, this time with the shiitake mushroom and greens dumplings I ordered.  And while this was the dish that wound up impressing me the least, it was by no means mediocre.  A little too heavy on the soy sauce but seriously delicious.  \\n\\nI couldn't decide between the beef and broccoli chow fun and the triple pork mushu stirfy, so I had the waitress decide for me. I was secretly thrilled when she told me I absolutely had to go with the triple pork.  And when it arrived at the table, it was one of those experiences where every bite I took, I was so happy because of how perfect and tasty it was, and sad at the same time because it was closer to being finished.  \\n\\nThe wind, in the meantime, kept pounding against the windows.  And Jeremy and I were seated in the corner so we had windows surrounding us and it was hard not to look outside every so often.  You know, when we weren't engrossed in our food.  \\n\\nAbout ten scrumptious bites into the triple pork, I noticed something outside my window.  And it scurried to a garbage can.  And ran to my window again.  \\n\\nI tried not to think about it, and tried not to look.  I took another bite of my pork and tried to take my mind off of it, but then another one joined it.   \\n\\n\\"Rats.\\"\\n\\nJeremy looked up at me.  \\"What, something wrong with your food?\\"\\n\\n\\"No,\\" I said.  \\"I mean, yes.  I mean... rats.\\"\\n\\nHe followed my eyes out the window and realized what I'd meant.  \\n\\nInstant appetite killer for me.  My almost perfect meal, ruined by critters.  I just can't love a place fully when I am trying to enjoy my meal and there are rats running around in plain sight.  Granted, they were outside and not running around my table, but one's mind starts to wander.   \\n\\nMy waitress definitely thought I did not like the pork.  I could tell, and I felt awful for disappointing her.  I really did love it.  I don't normally take food home because of diet reasons (I'm a huge late night snacker so if it's not there for me to snack on, I won't eat it), so I am sure I seemed crazy when I told her I loved it, even though I only had a handful of bites, and yes it was fabulous but no I do not want to take it home.  But I also didn't want to tell her the real reason why my dinner was cut a bit short.\\n\\nI want to go back - really - but maybe I'll ask for a seat not by the windows.   And I'll start with the pork again so I can finish what I started.  I haven't stopped thinking about how delicious it was since I went.  That's gotta mean something.\\n\\nBut man, I wish the rats weren't dancing around the place like that."},{"name":"Myers & Chang","address":"1145 Washington St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I really had high hopes for M&C, but unfortunately it was overpriced cheap Chinese food.

The onions and tomatoes tasted really lemon-y fresh also. However, some of the vegetables in the top left corner of the picture had a weird after-taste to me. I'm not sure if it was a vinegarette that they put or the vegetables themselves. The vegetables also had fava beans which were crunchy. The bowl itself had a hummus layer all around. The hummus had a lack in flavor, but when mixed with the vegetables it added a nice element to it. My favorite part about this place though was the soda.

The Cobb salad was full of flavor, the textures and colors of this salad were as mesmerizing as the taste, large enough for 2-3. To finish it off we had their \\"flag ship\\" dessert, the Texas sheet cake, as they are one of the few places that has GOOD coffee (that's the brand) ice cream. This decadent chocolate cake was just that, decadent, not full of sweet fillers but just enough to bring out the richness of the coffee ice cream. The roasted nuts topped this dessert to bring a very  crunchy texture that brought sweet notes that just set it off!

Food and service were excellent.  Our waitress came back several times to check on us and refill our tea cups.  The Hokkai Yaki Maki (spicy scallop) was goooood; I am looking forward to going back to try the other maki rolls.  There was also a special menu with sushi pieces starting at one dollar!  I tried the tempura udon noodle soup (I luuuuuv soup!).  I got a nice selection of tempura (eggplant, squash, green beans, pepper, broccoli, and shrimp).  The noodle soup was simple with some added imitation crab meat and nappa cabbage.  It hit the spot!

The texture was coarse, too. I wish they'd had a fluffier consistency. For the Dom, I wish the strawberry flavor could have been more evident -- the strawberry came out faint, and it felt like I had eaten a slightly tart vanilla cake. The cake from The Dough Dough Bird, aside from the previously mentioned issues, did well in the flavor department; and I enjoyed the (eggless) raw cookie dough inside.\\n\\nLuckily, the frosting saved the cupcakes for us. OMG -- possibly some of the best frosting I've ever had. If perfection had a form, it would be their champagne buttercream. It was decadent, light, fluffy, creamy, and flaky all at once; and it looked beautiful. With the homemade strawberry cream cheese in the center, it looked like a rose.

To be fair, it's a prejudice I've formed while living in San Diego, where brunch is just an excuse to wake up hung over at noon and then go swill another fifth of tequila without putting shoes on. If you're familiar with the area, check out the scene on a Saturday or Sunday in North Park sometime.\\n\\nThus, the prospect of brunch in Vancouver was not one I was looking forward to, but one I walked away from pleasantly surprised and gastronomically satisfied, thanks to the venue: Cafe Medina, a bustling cafe with competent service and delicious food. The crowd of people was also a refreshing change--all grownups behaving normally and no one swinging from the light fixtures blotto. Speaking of light fixtures, they're hung from a high ceiling that opens to a dining room, a spacious bar, a waffle station, and an open kitchen. There are industrial accents throughout mismatched with mosaic flooring, large windows, and retro wall art for a comfortable and modern vibe.\\n\\nThe pi√®ce de r√©sistance was the Cassoulet, a serving of two sunny-side eggs, smoked bacon, andouille sausage, Saucisson de Paris, white beans, red wine, tomatoes, and grilled focaccia. Basically it's a delicious full English breakfast in a cast-iron skillet. Every component was expertly cooked and prepared and the flavors were exceptional, from the savory grilled meats to the sweetness brought by the beans and the pur√©ed Roma tomatoes. Breaking the egg yolk and allowing it to run into the medley beneath, then sopping it up with the grilled focaccia bread was especially delightful.\\n\\nMoving on, a certain quantity of Li√®ge waffles are made here daily and we were fortunate to score two with accompanying dipping sauces. The iron used to make these puppies weighs 100 pounds, heavy enough to hold down rising yeasted dough. The outcome is a golden waffle that's fluffy on the inside and crunchy on the outside, thanks to the caramelized pearl sugar that is their claim to fame. My side of white chocolate pistachio rosewater dipping sauce added an additional touch of sweetness, while my dining partner's passion fruit sauce added a welcome tart note.\\n\\nChef Jonathan Chovancek graces Cafe Medina with a menu that is classic yet bold and largely inspired by Middle Eastern flavors. As such we couldn't leave without trying the house-made sourdough flatbread paired with a serving of creamy baba ganoush. Spices and herbs are also introduced into many of the drink selections including our orders of Turmeric Elixir and Jamaiquita Lemonade. More classic brunch beverages such as mimosas are also available and priced even more affordably during Happy Hour (9 a.m. - 11 a.m. daily).\\n\\nNote that there will surely be a wait to experience breakfast nirvana so choose your arrival strategy wisely.

Being from Toronto, I find the tapas restaurants relatively expensive and I found this menu to be reasonably priced, even with the poor exchange rate!\\n\\nWe split 6 tapas, along with some Jamon and Manchego, with two rounds of their fresh, warm bread, and a pitcher of red sangria ($26.50). In order from least favourite to most favourite:\\n- Patatas Bravas ($6.50): I've had better, so the bar is high on this one.\\n- Croquetas ($5.50): Decent tapas staple.\\n- Blistered Shishitos ($6.50): Never had this is Spain, but will definitely order this next time I'm there. Be careful of the odd, super spicy pepper!\\n- Grilled Hanger Steak ($11.50): The truffle vinaigrette was a bit overpowering, but the steak was cooked to a nice medium-rare.\\n- Grilled Pulpo ($11.50): Not quite pulpo Gallego (which is my all-time favourite tapas dish), but the octopus was cooked perfectly with that \\"grill\\" taste.\\n- Roasted Brussels Sprouts ($7.00): I don't think I've had brussels sprouts that I didn't like. The hollandaise and fried garlic were the perfect accompaniment.\\n\\nThis was definitely more than enough food and we were surprised that our bill came to less than $100. Other than the Patatas Bravas, I was VERY happy with our selections and impressed by the attentive service, including a visit from one of the managers.

I really don't understand the appeal. Sure it's a brunch place with a twist, but the food overall is not impressive. The flavors and overall experience was really disappointing to me. I love my brunch and I'm pretty picky about it so I might not be the easiest critic in this arena. \\n\\nAs expected, I had to wait about 45 minutes before getting seated. Classic for any Vancouver place that is over-hyped. \\n\\nThe waffles, which I was expecting to be heavenly were lackluster. It was STALE. Now that is unacceptable for any restaurant. The sauces that came with it was the highlight of the whole experience. I just cannot get over the waffle though. Their sausage was overcooked and lacked the moisture that I expect from a good sausage. It was also really lacking in the flavor department \\n\\nIf you are going to come here, skip on the food and get a drink - they have some really cool hot caffeine beverages that were pretty good.

We had a group reservation for about 40 people from 7-9 PM. \\n\\nFinding the place can be tricky. If you're not looking for it, you'll pass it. It's on the right side of the road just beyond Red Hot Yoga will small signage. You can either park in the street or valet parking. Valet parking is normally $2 (plus tip). The valet parking was a bit tricky as well, because the driveway to pull in is almost unmarked. \\n\\nWhen you walk in the giant door, it definitely doesn't feel like a bowling alley. The word that came to mind when I walked in was....plush. Or maybe posh. They both describe it well to me. The place has statutes of lions scattered around the place. Fake, manicured bushes pepper the place. It makes me think of an old school man cave. Where men sat in deep, leather couches, drank scotch and smoked cigars. Complete with velvet-looking walls. \\n\\nThe bowling lanes are the typical hardwood lanes. Instead of annoying twisty chairs, they have small sectional sofas for each lane. Balls were already placed in our lanes, so I'm not sure if we get to pick them out, or just choose from what's already there. Same with the computer. We didn't put our names in, but they just appeared on the screen. The computer, by the way, is just a flat-screen TV above the bowling lane. \\n\\nThey have a kitchen here as well, not a concession stand, as well as a full-bar. You can order pretty much any drink you want and order from their food menu at your lane. Because we were a large party, some foods were already picked out for us. We had a fruit plate with hummus. French fries served with garlic aioli. Loaded fries with sour scream, chives, cheese and bacon. Chips with some sort of meat dip, edamame with sesame glaze, corn on the cob with butter and chives, and corn dogs cooked in waffle batter. We had quite the spread! \\n\\nHummus - pretty decent, but nothing special. When served, there was quite a bit of oil on top of the hummus. The carrots, cucumbers, cauliflowers and pita slices went well with it.\\nFries and garlic aioli - a crowd favorite. The aioli was delightful and full of flavor. The fries were standard - crispy and soft.\\nThe loaded fries - another crowd favorite. Topped with sour cream, chives, bacon and cheese - full of flavor and a bit messy for bowling.\\nCorn on the cob - I didn't try this, but it looked really good. Who would want to eat corn on the cob at a work event and get corn stuck in your teeth?\\nEdamame - my favorite dish of the night. Whatever they put on the edamame was amazing. Full of flavor. Absolutely addicting. I didn't mind shelling them myself because it tasted so good.\\nWaffle-battered corn dog - Just okay. Nothing inherently waffle-y about it. Plus, I am boycotting Belgians waffles since the World Cup loss. '\\nChips and dip - The chips were your standard tortilla chips, fried and crispy. The meat sauce was interesting. Not a lot of cheese, but not quite a salsa texture. And it was pretty spicy.\\n\\nThe best part was the food kept coming! As soon as one plate was empty, it was being replaced with another just like it. It was never-ending. I pretty much ate a dinner of french fries. \\n\\nWe also had drink tickets to use for that night. When we first arrived, the server told me to order anything from the menu because it was covered by my drink tickets. Well, after I ordered a cranberry and vodka, she told me that I was actually supposed to order from a select menu. She said she would honor my drink order since I placed the order before she knew about the limited menu. It took quite awhile though, to get the drink. A dozen people who ordered after me got their drinks first. And I had to search for this woman and tell her my order was never received. In all, it took about 30 minutes to get the drink. After that little hiccup, things got better. My second drink was the Moscow Mule slushie. An interesting twist on the Moscow Mule that was good, but not good? It was definitely boozy, but the slushie concept was lost on me. After the two drink tickets were taken, you could order whatever you wanted at the cash bar.\\n\\nThe bowling alley also has some booth seating if you'd like to sit down for dinner and then bowl afterwards. I saw several shuffleboards around the place, I think I saw corn hole as well? In the back, hidden by a curtain and unbeknownst to be, there was ping pong and basketball in the back. Didn't get to try it out, though.\\n\\nI could definitely see this as a really cool place to hang out and do several different things. You could order dinner, bowl, play shuffleboard, ping pong and some other games as well. It's a great place to keep everyone entertained. I saw a lot of young adults there, a lot of 20 & the young 30 crowd. Some of the women were dressed up really, really nice to go bowling and some of the men were wearing suits.

That's how you know a place is good, when two people with different tastes BOTH want to try it out. \\n\\nWe arrived at 11:00 and were told we'd have a thirty minute wait ahead of us. The very nice hostess said that we could put our names down (which we of course did) and return then. When we'd left Medina's initially it was indeed busy, but nowhere near the level of chaos it was at when we returned. There were easily a dozen people in line trying to snag a seat with even more people waiting outside. We couldn't have been more glad that we'd written our names down earlier (that did NOT please the people in line however). \\n\\nMy boyfriend got the cassoulet with eggs over hard and I got the saumon fum√©. Size-wise the cassoulet was far bigger than the fum√© but I definitely preferred the fish dish. I've never had salmon, avocado, and an egg together before but by God it was one of the most incredible food pairings I'd had in a long time. If you're a fan of lighter breakfast's and enjoy interesting textures this is the order for you. My only issue (a tiny one) is that the tartine was a bit tough. The woman next to me (who also had the fum√©) and I had a good laugh about how hard it was to cut through the bread.\\n\\nAfter hastily devouring my dish I was still peckish and we ordered the avocado toast side which came out within minutes. Although not as good as our mains it was still a rather strong dish. The salsa was incredibly flavourful and they put a portion of avocado that would put all NYC hipster joints to shame. Despite being overwhelmingly busy our waitress still managed to stay on her toes and get all portions of our meal out to us in a pleasant time and manner, so kudos to her. \\n\\nWhile this place isn't actually 5 stars (more of a 4.8) I do recommend it, especially since it was the best tasting brunch I've had in years.

You spend a majority of the experience waiting in line and then the actual fun part happens relatively quickly. Whether or not you will like Hopdoddy depends on whether you think their burger justifies a long wait. Like at a theme park, the whole time you are in line you observe other people enjoying themselves. Akin to listening to people screaming from a roller coaster ride, we inhaled the aroma of the food and saw diners on both sides of us enjoying their burgers while we slowly inched forward. It is definitely not a fun line to wait in. When my wife and I visited Hopdoddy last month, we spent 45 minutes in line before we finally reached the front and placed our orders.\\n\\nI ordered the Llano Poblano (beef burger with bacon, poblano peppers, and chipotle sauce), and my wife chose the Continental Club (turkey burger with guacamole and bacon). We decided to share an order of fries. \\n\\nWe then waited about another 10-15 minutes for our food to be prepared. When the food finally arrived, we were super hungry. I ate my burger fairly rapidly but I do have a few observations to note. The fresh baked bun was excellent and soaked up all of the juice from the burger as well as the chipotle sauce. The poblano pepper was really just a small slice of poblano pepper that was gone in one bite. It probably would have been better if they chopped it up. The bacon was thin and a little too crispy for my liking. I appreciate that they chose to make bold choices with the ingredients (like making the bacon super crispy), but those choices didn't align with my own personal tastes. I thought the fries were crispier than I liked too. I normally prefer thicker fries though.\\n\\nI had some of my wife's Continental Club. I thought the Turkey burger was cooked well but was a little bland. \\n\\nIf we didn't have to wait so long for the food, Hopdoddy would definitely be four stars. Given the long wait and all of the hype though, I think three stars is more appropriate."},{"name":"Andiamo Ristorante","address":"2521 Rutland Dr, Ste 325","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Oh my gosh. This place is amazing! The first time I came here was almost a year ago. I'd seen a picture of a dish posted on some instagram account so I looked Andiamo up and it looked pretty good. So my sister and I came for dinner on a week night. When we pulled up we both thought we had the wrong address. The outside of the building is a little misleading, it has a very plain front and is just another store in a strip mall. It really doesn't look like anything special. But once you walk inside it all makes sense. It's very dimly lit and is decorated with paintings and photos of scenes in Italy. \\n\\nThe food. Oh man the food. So I don't remember what I ordered the last time that we visited but I do remember that it was delicious and I have been wanting to come back ever since. This time around my parents were in town and we were going out for lunch to celebrate my mothers birthday together. We started with a calamari appetizer. It was a good portion but it was a little small for a group of four, but it was very tasty. My sister got the gnocchi al forno and it was delicious but I don't think I could have made a meal out of it. Gnocchi is just a little rich and heavy for my taste. My dad got the fettuccine ragu e caprino and I didn't try it but he said it was great and finished the whole plate. My mom and I both ordered the linguine cozze e calamari. It was delicious! There was a decent amount of seafood and the sauce really wasn't spicy at all. I would highly recommend this dish if you're like me and love the seafood/pasta combo. We also got desserts because we were celebrating so of course we would! My sister got the bocconotti (a sort of apple ravioli) and she wasn't really a fan but I thought it was pretty good, although I am more of a chocolate person myself. I got the zabaglione which was more or less flavored whipped cream and fresh fruit in a dark chocolate shell cup. Yum yum yum. It was pretty small, but it was really the perfect size. My mom and dad split the tiramisu and really enjoyed it.\\n\\nThis place is a little pricey so I try to reserve it for a celebration or special occasion. But it is amazing.

The arepas are all really delicious, albeit small. The Empanada Mechada is where it's at, though. Moist, juicy shredded beef full of flavor is packed into two fried little pockets, each halved and beautifully plated around a lightly dressed, tangy mixed greens salad topped with cheese.

Either way this is the blandest meal I have had in a very long while.\\n\\nI had the chicken shawarma over rice. \\nHere's the list of issues: \\n- the salad had no dressing. no oil, no vinegar, no lemon juice - nothing. Was lettuce and veggies. Even a spray of lemon juice would've made the salad tasty. \\n- the chicken had no flavor. As in it clearly was not marinated or even seasoned. Common seasonings used in this style of cuisine: lemon, garlic, olive oil, oregano, tumeric, yogurt. Even using just two of these things would have given the chicken some flavor. It was just plain chicken. Hell some salt and pepper would elevate the chicken by 90%. \\n- Garlic Sauce tasted like mayo with a hit of lemon juice. But mostly mayo. I've had garlic sauce in other places and after one bite the garlic content of my breath could knock out an elephant. People rave about this in other reviews. Again this tasted like watered down mayo. I didn't taste any garlic. \\n- Hot Sauce was actually good.\\n\\nTypically not huge on chains but once Naf Naf Grill hits Austin this place is going to go out of business and Austinites are going to lose their mind over decent middle eastern food.

I said to her that this guys won't serve me or I have no idea what is going on. So gave her the money. The bartender walked right to her and told her that he'd be happy to serve her but not me. She told him that I was dead sober. He said that didn't matter - he just didn't like \\"my kind\\".\\n\\nI understand that Boston has a racist label because of the bus riots and general larger concentration of Caucasian people. However, I was born in Boston and have had very few experiences like that. Most people that I have met in the area are enlightened and appreciate diversity.

And remembering her word's when I passed by this place, went in and ordered a Chicken Biryani. It did not blow me away, but I am Indian and I have high expectations when it comes to Indian food. Ordered the usual Naan, curry combo the next time which was spicy like I requested. The Kheema Naan was awesome, with spicy minced lamb inbetween the naan, it added a flavor of its own. They guy was nice enough to point out the items that were already spicy when I asked for extra spicy.

We had been to this Chilis twice on a Saturday afternoon and had a good experience. However, last Saturday we did not. Within minutes of sitting at the bar, a former bartender and server in my twenties, I could tell that Ryan the bartender was extremely lazy. It looked like a bomb went off at the bar. There were dirty plates everywhere including on the surfaces by the taps and the back bar where the liquor bottles are. We sat at a filthy counter for nearly 10 minutes, while other customers that came in after us were served beers (with beer spilling everywhere mind you). Just as my fiance said, we can go, Ryan asked us if he could get us something while wiping the counter in front of us with a stack of paper napkins! Or should I say spreading the spills in front of us. We ordered margaritas off the menu and he had to look at the menu to see what was in them. He still managed to make mine incorrectly. It was horrible and so I didn't drink it. I am not sure why someone who can not be bothered to say thank you or hello would be in the service industry, let alone a bartender. I honestly was afraid to eat or drink anything for fear of getting food poisoning. He was making some watermelon blended drink and cutting up the watermelon on the back bar alongside the dirty plates. I can only imagine the filth in the shakers he was using. He moved at a snail pace and never checked on anyone, they had to get his attention if they needed something. Also, I can't forget the customers at the bar who apparently thought they were sitting in their own living room when demanding the manager to put the sound to the red sox game on. The manager was very gracious in his response however that did not stop the men at the bar from complaining to the bartender who did not defend the restaurant or manager in any way! I was absolutely horrified that these men thought they were justified in speaking to someone this way. I would like to write what I really thought of them but I will refrain.

It looked like every other table had ordered it as well.

Only one batata cham/potato patty was served (the menu indicated an order was more than one).  The pakoras, crab cakes and batata cham were cooked a tad too long and came out very brown, almost burnt.  The chicken tandoori tasted fine but some bites were lukewarm, some were cold, something I was not expecting.  The calamari was very small and greasy; the batter on some of them fell apart when you picked it up.  \\n\\nNonetheless, we had a good time as we enjoyed each other's company.  When the bartender came over to check on us, he provided even more entertainment.

Here however its just average BBQ.\\n\\nThe plus to going here is that there is an ample amount of places to park and no lines. I had people in from out of town the first time we went to visit so it was super convenient. \\n\\nI really hate the way you go scoop up your sides yourself then get charged. When I get near the sides I'm tempted to get some of everything because it almost feels like a sides buffet which really runs up the price per ticket. \\n\\nThe BBQ is quite expensive too with our average per plate price coming in somewhere at 35 dollars per plate.. I did have a friend buy a 30 dollar rip so I excluded him from the average but that's still a heck of a lot to pay for BBQ.\\n\\nTerry Blacks is good BBQ but its not as good as either of the other somewhat related Blacks BBQ locations.

For the food I must say that every single item we ordered off the menu was delicious! Me personally I had ordered the chicken and biscuits which were soo tasty.  The chicken was a nice hearty piece super light and crispy and the biscuit was oh so moist, it had also came with a side of rosemary tots, and of course who doesn't like tots! My friends had gotten the avocado toast, shrimp and grits, and the crab Benedict and they were all equally as pleased with there dish as I was of mine.  Now for 14.99 extra we had added on the unlimited mimosas which was well worth it, it came with your choice if either pineapple, cranberry, grapefruit or orange juice.  The only reason that I had not rated this hidden gem a 5 star is because finding parking at the Waterfront was a bit difficult due to the fact that since this is a smaller restaurant it also had a smaller parking lot, I actually had to park in the grass off of the paved parking lot.

As someone from Texas I grew up with breakfast tacos every Sunday morning...so I thought eh, what could be special about that. The migas orginales breakfast taco shattered that thought completely. Hands down the best breakfast taco I have had, ever. The flavors and different textures are so wonderfully balanced! I never knew I needed this in my life until my visit, and now I understand why people wait in lines in 100+ degree weather for a breakfast taco. I highly recommend and will definitely be back. \\nPro tips: 1) if you're starving after that wait, make sure to order the chips and guacamole. They give them to you as soon as you order so you have something to munch on while you wait on the tacos!\\n2) you can ask for one agua fresca (highly recommend the mango) to be split into two cups so you can share that goodness with someone you love. Or you can always just get the one 32oz fresca for yourself, because treat yo self.\\n3) If waiting in lines in the Texas heat isn't your thing they also have 2 brick and motar locations in Austin, so you can at least wait in the AC."},{"name":"Gourdough's Public House","address":"2700 S Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Omg sooo good!

Compared to Starbucks, it deserves 5 stars, there is no question. But that is not what they seek to be compared to.\\n\\nThere are two ways to order a latte at Render. You can order a latte, or you can order a \\"cappuccino.\\" When asked why the cap is so wet, they said \\"none of us like much foam in our drinks.\\" Fine, so they don't like cappuccinos; but that is nevertheless the drink I ordered, not the one I was served. I don't blame them really; the Render staff know their stuff and likely don't get paid enough to care beyond a point, whereas management at places like Thinking Cup (and apparently Render too?) want to sell latte art instead of a proper cappuccino.\\n\\nThe espresso is up and down. On one occasion they served me a shot of Counter Culture's Apollo, which came very well. On the next, they served an Ethiopian natural process coffee that had a lot of great flavor but the espresso was muddy relative to other single origin espressos. \\n\\nMore importantly, the vibe at Render is off. They take pleasure in snickering at customers, and they make no pains to keep it secret. It is blatant. There are more subtle ways certain staff expose their undervaluing of their customers opinions or experience, but I won't carry on. Suffice it to say that while I can go to NYC or other Boston shops and meet plenty of baristas who buck the stereotype behind the counter, unfortunately at Render I had difficulty.\\n\\nThe sandwiches are lovely and the person making them entirely pleasant. The dining room has a fine atmosphere and more seating than average, plus a patio which can be nice. Sometimes they take your order to your seat which is kind of them.\\n\\nBottom line: I do recommend going there for good food, good coffee, and a fine experience, but not necessarily for consistently great coffee and consistently pleasant staff."},{"name":"Hopdoddy Burger Bar","address":"1400 S Congress Ave, Ste A190","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Hands down, best burger my husband and I have ever had.

The overcooked bacon really screws it up for this one.  The SEC are fairly decent and the guy is usually generous with the portion.  They both could use more cheese.  This chain has great potential.

Just really sloppy service from start to finish.  We made a 7pm reservation, we sat down at 7:40pm.  No line, and no real reason given as to how that happened, but they didn't have a table for us and it sucked as one of us was pregnant.\\n\\nWe wanted to get appetizers at the bar, but the bartender was elusive and it took three tries over about 15 minutes to get her attention, get a food menu, and put in an order--that we had to eat at the table and have transferred which was no issue.\\n\\nThe waitress then took our orders and forgot to put one of the four entrees in.  Just flat out forgot, served all dishes, came back to the table twice and didn't think to ask why one person had no food in front of them and was sitting there awkwardly while no one ate and just waited.  We had to bring it up, and then watched her stand at the kitchen and think as hard as possible to figure out what she had forgotten to write down i guess?  \\n\\nPooring wine was super fun.  We had four people, and one was pregnant.  The wine tasting was offered to not the person who ordered it, and then wine was poored into two and half glasses only, and the person who tried it didn't get more wine.  Don't really care here, we poored the bottle ourselves, but it was just one more thing that made this whole experience feel extremely unpolished and unprofessional.\\n\\nWe also just got skipped on bread altogether.  Which was bizarre as we were there for 2 hours in full, so PLENTY of time without any food in front of us where bread would have been welcomed.  Also, we ordered mussels as an appetizer, and so we were all looking forward to bread so that we could dip into the mussel sauce - sort of one of the best parts of ordering a good plate of mussels.  No bread came.  Again, wouldn't have cared much, but bread + mussel broth - COME ON MAN.\\n\\nOtherwise, it was a nice meal and the place is in a great spot - off the main N.E. strip.

Extremely slow service, no check in to see if things were ok, appetizers came out at exact same time as food.  Literally everything was wrong.  Waitress even had audacity to ask if we were finished paying check, ignored entire table of dirty dishes to make sure she got to the check and walked off.  \\n\\nIn speaking with some strangers in a store afterwards - they echoed our same concerns.  Specifically noting how bad the service has become in addition to the food.  \\n\\nI really used to like this place.   My guess: they know they'll get the business due to the location (tourists, shopping, etc) - so why care about quality service or quality food?  Sad.

For such a nice restaurant, I found it weird that you order like you do at Which Wich, on a clipboard by ticking off the items you want. It seemed pretty unnecessary because there was also a server that presumably took your order form and put it into the computer like any other restaurant. The clipboards also took up almost the entire table (we were at a small two person table) so it felt very awkward trying to find an appropriate place for it. Additionally, it was so non-descriptive with menu items literally named very vague things like \\"Bird\\" (chicken in smoky sauce apparently). Overall, those clipboards and the menu in general seemed like an unnecessary middle man to the whole experience because we had to ask the server for clarification on many items.\\n\\nMy disappointment with the food started with the bread, which by the way, has to be ordered separately from the butter or olive oil. And I'm sorry, but in what world do people not want butter or dipping oil with bread? Just include this in one menu item! Anyway, the bread was completely cold. It was good hearty bread, but cold bread at a fancy place is pet peeve of mine.

And n-o-t-h-i-n-g...can possibly...come close...to the donuts they serve here! And that is no exaggeration either. Sure they're not your run of the mill donut place. And why? Because it takes 14 unicorn tears, fairy dust, a secret formula crafted by the Dalai Lama, milk from a magical cow of Atlantis and a blessing from the Queen of England to make just 1 donut. That's right...just 1! So you can only imagine what variety they have. Chocolate covered, filled this, stuffed that, glazed here, sprinkled there + 2 parts laughter and 3 parts joy. Good god, these things are as immense as they are filling. And hell, if that wasn't good enough, well go ahead and add some donut burgers, some beer, some chicken cluckers and all kinds of ginormous whatnot you won't get aaaanywhere else.

Chopsticks Asian Bistro is proof. \\n\\nI had never heard of this place before last week. But one of their guys stopped by my workplace to drop off their menu. Normally, we stick most of the menus and crap that restaurants bring into File 13, but Chopsticks included a gift certificate for $5 (no strings attached)...so I was intrigued. Their menu offers most of the regular deep fried, sticky sweet & sour, overly salty things you'd expect from a typical Chinese takeout joint, but their menu stressed that they never use MSG. Now, I've been to other places that claim not to use the stuff...and then wondered why I was feeling all MSG-y after eating there. So, I'm a bit of a skeptic when places swear up and down that they don't use it, and you can still clearly taste (and feel) it when they do! Arg! \\n\\nAnyway, another one of their menus showed up on my doorstep at home the day after that...so I figured it was a sign or something. I had to try it. That night, we ordered the family dinner for two complete with: mongolian beef, sweet and sour chicken, spring rolls, \\"chicken on the sticks\\", fried rice, and a choice of soup, plus a fortune cookie. For $24 (plus tax and tip for delivery) it was a LOT of food (And did I mention I'm married to a human bottomless pit?)!  We had plenty left over for lunch the next day. \\n\\nThe mongolian beef was really good. Greasy, but not too much. The sweet and sour chicken was good too. Breaded all white meat, green pepper, carrots, pineapple, and sauce on the side. For spring rolls, we were impressed! You could tell that there were real fresh vegetables inside, yet all of the crisp, deep fried loveliness surrounding it! \\"Chicken on the sticks\\"? I think the name is funny, but the taste was impressive. Juicy and moist with star anise seasoning! Nice! With the family meals, you have a choice of soup: egg drop, won ton, hot and sour or vegetable. We opted for vegetable fearing the worst (you know, dinky square micro-carrots, a few peas and maybe a thing of baby corn) and hoping for the best. We got better than the best! There were TONS of fresh veggies! Nice large chunks in a simple broth!  I love veggies, and they came through for me!  Best of all, I waited for that MSG feeling and it never came!

We were seated at the communal table and while this feels a bit awkward at first, you warm up to your table mates. The food is definitely the conversation starter, everyone wanted to know what everyone was eating. \\nFirst, the customer service is absolutely spot on. I believe our waitresses name was Kelly and she was so incredibly excited about their food and what they do, it was contagious! We told her just to pick 6 dishes that she thought we would enjoy. Many things on the menu are not things we would order ourselves (like the PigFace) but low and behold, we ate that whole face like it was nobody's business. Kelly even gave us a spatula to wipe our dishes clean of their delicious purees and sauces. \\nThe cost wasn't outrageous and we left completely satisfied. The only downside to this place is that they have a new menu every month and I'm going to be begging my husband to try each one out, even if it is a little out of the way for us. Bottom Line: Go.

I used the napkin to wipe it as best i could but as you know, those napkins aren't very water absorbent. I asked the guests if they knew what happened. They said the waiter spilled it. \\n\\nAs i picked up the jacket to smell it, they told me it was beer. The waiter comes over a little while later to wipe the table and he was pushing the water off the table to the side. I asked him about the jacket. He goes, it's beer, continued to finish wiping the jacket and walked away. He didn't apologize. I asked if I can get some napkins. At this time, my jacket was still wet. \\n\\nMinutes later, a different guy comes over with napkins. We asked to speak the manager and he said he was. He didn't apologize either but asked if I was a guest of the hotel so that he can send it to dry clean. I told him no because I wasn't. And I had plans to go out that night and therefore couldn't part it since I'd be cold. He didn't know what to say or do it seemed and didn't apologize. I asked him, since he wouldn't be able to offer reimbursement for dry-cleaning, would it be possible to do something else. He ask us what we would like to be done. Is that normal practice? To not apologize than asks your guests what they want to be done? I don't know. I don't work in the restaurant business but i have gone to many restaurants and eaten at a number of low end and high end places and customer service was definitely a lot friendlier than here. He agreed that he would do something about the bill and left. \\n\\nI realise it was a very busy night with so many games going on. And when the bill was brought to us, nothing changed on the bill. I was more than a little upset at this point but i asked our waiter if that was the final bill or was the manager meant to look over it. He at this point apologized and said it was busy and he just probably haven't had a chance to look yet. Shouldn't this have been communicated so that the guest doesn't get a wrong check? He returns with the revised check and my Apple Martini was comp'ed on the bill. \\n\\nI felt the waiter in the beginning of the night was doing Ok. It took him a few minutes to get my drink but he did return several times to check on us and see if we needed refills or if we wanted to order my food. At the time of the incident, it was the beginning of the 3rd quarter of the Celtics game. We were nearly done by that point but wanted more food and drinks, but we were all too scared to order anything else as horrors stories are heard/read about what waiters and waitresses do to guests foods and drinks. To be on the safe side, we just finish the rest of the food and drinks and left. \\n\\nDespite the incident, we still left the waiter nearly an $11 tip, on a $69 bill. Now, every bone in my body would have not, nor did my friends. But, we also know they don't get paid much and are dependent on tips to make a living and as is, the economic is bad, we wouldn't feel comfortable adding more stress to it.

She never bothered to see if we were happy with our meals or if there were any other drinks we needed.  It was very odd?  Again, the place wasn't busy and no follow up on diners?

To start, we ordered the Gomen-Siljo dip. It was made of tofu and gomen (collards), seasoned with garlic, ginger, hot mustard and olive oil. It was an excellent start to the meal and got us excited about the rest to come.\\n\\nWe ordered the veggie platter because we knew that would get us a great deal of variety and the chicken tibs.  The vegetarian platter included shiro (chick pea stew), misir (red lentil stew), ater (split pea stew), dinech wot (potato stew), gomen (collards), cabbage, salad, azifa, beets and potato salad, and fit fit (tomatoes, onion, peppers, and garlic). The beet and potato salad was a surprising show stopper (and I don't even like beets!). All of the veg dishes were great and went perfectly with the fluffy injera. The winner of the meal, however, was the tibs! If I had it to do again, I may order an assortment of tibs and make the whole thing a meatfest. The chicken was simply outstanding.

The spicy turkey had a kick to it which is good because I don't like when menu items say spicy and have no heat at all.  The club was pretty much what you would expect.  The PB&G was a hit with the kids.  A little messy, but good flavor combo and the granola gives it a little crunch.   I don't like cinnamon and it tasted like there was some in it, possibly in the granola??   Everyone else loved it.  My five year old ate a whole wrap and I was still a little hungry after finishing mine.  So I would say it's a place for a light meal or quick stop on the go, just done expect to sit down and be stuffed when you leave unless you have a small appetite.

I mean, really this was one of the best-tasting dishes I have eaten in a long time. It was crispy, salty, filling, and paired really well with the garlicky sauce that it came with (I think this was garlic? someone else can correct me). This really was the center piece of the meal and has guaranteed my repeat business.\\n\\nI also ordered two chicken and cheese empanadas, which I imagine would have been good if that's what I actually received. The labels must have been switched around because I pointed to the tray that said chicken and cheese and I audibly asked for \\"chicken and cheese\\" but my first bite at home was ground beef. No worries, they were freakin' delicious but not what I ordered and the person serving me didn't seem to know if there was a difference. The silver lining is I paid for chicken empanadas ($2.50 each) which were slightly cheaper.\\n\\nFinally, I really wanted to try the stewed oxtail so I ordered a small ($12) over rice. The server started to scoop from the stewed beef so I stopped her and re-iterated that I wanted the oxtail. She said \\"oh sorry\\" and stared at the stewed meats for a few seconds and then resumed scooping from the beef. I again tried to specify that I meant OXTAIL and was informed that there was none left. Again, no problem but it would have saved me interrupting her if I was told that in the first place. \\n\\nWhen it came time to pay, the server seemed to be endlessly tapping away and canceling items on the register. I don't know what she was doing but she gave me a few nervous laughs and apologies. I noticed the empanadas still sitting on the counter so I asked her about them and she seemed to forget that I ordered them. By this point a line was forming and there was nobody else manning the food station so I just wanted to get the transaction over with and get home. My total rang up as $37!! This was absolutely a mistake because the mofongo ($10.50) wasn't even listed, the stewed chicken was in there instead for $9, the two empanadas rang up as $2 each (even though the menu shows $2.50), and the small stewed beef should have been $9 but rang up as a large for $22 (there were about four slices of beef so there is no way I accidentally got a large)! In a moment of embarrassment and not wanting to try and have her re-do the transaction (it had taken her at least  5 minutes up to this point), I paid and left.\\n\\nAm I pissed about overpaying? Absolutely but whatever I won't buy coffee for a week to make up for it. Was the food amazing to an ungodly degree? You bet.

My son had grilled shrimp skewers with wild rice. The shrimp was good, rice was so bland and had no flavor. My husband had a bunch of fried fish and shirtless and well you can't really screw that up. My youngest son had chicken fingers. We made sure we had cheddar bay biscuits at all times as that was the most flavorful thing I think. Our drinks were kept filled and that was nice. But I have been a server and bartender and I am huge into customer service. I guess I expect too much because that is the level of service I deliver.

Secondly, my enchiladas oaxaquenas (with mole sauce)-- my usual order at the SM Casa Maria-- did not deliver. The sauce was flat and one-note, and I had to wonder whether they were using jarred mole sauce, because it  did not compare at all to the mole sauce at the other location (flavorful, complex, perfect balance of sweet and spicy).  The refried beans also seemed a little bit watery. (The rice was good, though.)  Also, our server forgot to bring flour tortillas, which came with my order. I was bummed about this because the tortillas at the San Marcos Casa Maria are insanely good (pillowy, doughy, delicious homemade tortillas). However, I did not remind my server to bring them because, hey, the enchiladas were fattening enough and God knows I can't control myself around homemade tortillas.\\n\\nThe panaderia, however, offers a much bigger selection of pan dulces than the San Marcos restaurant, and I'm glad to report that they were just as tasty."},{"name":"Gourdough's Public House","address":"2700 S Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Shitty customer service but good donuts.

The cashier didn't seem to quite understand  that I didn't want the bun but we quickly got past that. I paid ($16 bucks) and received a pager to wait. The buzzer went off after about 5 mins and my order was up. \\nMy togo order was bagged and ready to go but something told me to double check it (which I NEVER do...bad habit). I'm glad I did because my smokehouse  cheddar burger was missing the cheddar. An employee behind the counter saw me standing around and lackadaisically asked what I needed. I told him what I ordered and that this didn't look right. He lackadaisically took the burger from me and walked over to a sauce pump where he proceeded to pump and shake my burger (I guess to get the cheese sauce distributed evenly). He then put it back in the bag without as much as a word. \\nThe togo box was odd....it was like half a box....no top. I asked the same guy if they had a top you know to cover the food and keep it warm. He seemed annoyed but oh well! He out the top next to my bag.

The staff was friendly and helpful and the ingredients were fresh. Like most sandwich chains, you order at the counter and can choose from a pre-designed menu or you can do a make your own version. They construct it in front of you. I call it a sandwich because really that's what you get - a sandwich where in this case the \\"bread\\" is a big crepe. But the crepe is merely a vehicle to convey the ingredients it is not the star here. \\n\\nThey are very generous with the toppings so if you like lots of ingredients you'll be happy. They fold the crepe in half and then wrap it around the sandwich ingredients in a cone shape and put the whole thing into a likewise shaped paper sleeve. Without this sleeve the thing would be impossible to eat. It's the only thing that holds it all together. Even with the sleeve I reached a point where I was having a major ingredient blowout. We didn't try one of the dessert crepes so I can't speak for those but in the case of the \\"savory\\" version it read as a sandwich not a crepe to me. There were just so many ingredients that they overpower the crepe itself and even the make your own comes with the same amount of stuff - you just pick it out yourself. \\n\\nIt would be nice if they offered an a la carte ingredient option so you could opt for a more traditional edited down crepe experience, choose just a few ingredients and have them actually folded inside the crepe. That would also leave you with enough room to be able to try a dessert crepe too. As it is we could only finish half of ours. We ate the second half for lunch the next day. They do have a kids menu that seems pared down but it only has six options.\\n\\nSo if you are hungry for a Boars Head deli sandwich and are tired of the usual chain options of a sub roll, or a pita, or a flour tortilla give Crepevine a try. You won't be disappointed. If you are looking for a more delicately filled, traditional French crepe experience where the crepe in on equal footing with the ingredients - this is not the place."},{"name":"McPeets Portland Pub","address":"4501 NE Fremont St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"The food is okay (standard pub fare) and the brunch burger usually hits the spot.

We got the Cointreau creme br√ªl√©e donut. It was so fun! Definitely recommend that for the 21+ crowd. It was complete w a tiny little mini shot squeezer. It also cracked on top like a creme br√ªl√©e. So good. So. Good. We also got the almond ganache donut. That was interesting but was a strike out. So sad. So. Sad. It was messy and lacked flavor. It wasn't overly sweet which was great but it was just not good. I would not recommend taking kids here. The flavors are for a more mature palate. The prices also were high.

After standing on a long, slow-moving line for half an hour with a barker yelling \\"Cash! Cash! Cash!\\" in your face, you pay the hefty tab for admission ($37 for four adults and three kids) and are thrust into a claustrophobic series of blind alleyways populated by thieves and bunco artists in ratty stalls trying to lighten your wallet even further with dismal \\"crafts\\" and vastly overpriced and over-greased snacks. Bewildered fellow patrons, who mostly seem to be wondering how they got here and where the exit is, bump you along your way until you come to one of the Market's two main attractions -- a rickety stage upon which garishly costumed dancers perform regional dances while an unseen woman shrieks ear-splitting ditties into a crackly microphone... and a merry-go-round. The merry-go-round, which will set you back another $4 per child and more than that (I think) for an accompanying adult, is run by a 14-year-old gum chewing mouth-breather. She will not run the merry-go-round unless every seat is occupied. This can take some time so be prepared for a long sit on your horsey. Once the merry-go-round is at full capacity, she takes it for a 60-second spin without music (so as not to interfere with the howling of the woman at the dance performance), then you and your kids are back on the pavement. A quick $20 snack and you are ready for the trip home. Even the kids seemed eager to get out of there. Total tab for perhaps 15 minutes of Christmas Market frolics? About 60 bucks for admission, 60-second ride, and snacks. Folks, I have been cheated at sleazy carnivals and cheapjack amusement parks from North Carolina to California, but this was the absolute worst con job I have ever encountered -- a street mugging plain and simple.

Live jazz in lounge area was very nice. We went because we found the place on groupon. We had as described in the groupon, $50 worth of entrees and sides for 2 people, which was not honored upon opening the voucher to the waiter after he got management out on our request. We called in advance to inquire about using the groupon voucher and weren't told about any restrictions for it to be only applicable to entrees in the dining area and not entrees in the lounge area, which is not indicated on the groupon. The groupon says $50 towards any 2 entrees, not specifying any area or room. The management apparently made that rule up then or it's their own hidden rule once you try to use the voucher. They seem sneaky and very hard up to just not simply allow the voucher to be used and then take action to clarify the restrictions with groupon, which they apparantly don't seem to care about and don't care about losing a customer with a lot of influence to bring in 1000s of other customers over $50! They're idiots and jerks! I've never been to the establishment before and I test a place out by it's honor and loyalty to customers first, because anyplace can have great food if they spend the money for a great chef! However, customer care, service and concern comes from restaurant business ethics and honor, which this place doesn't have because they don't honor what they sign up for and thus I don't trust them because they are sneaky liars and pushy over $50 and I would have eventually brought them in $500k or more in business but they lost that now over a stupid $50 groupon voucher. If they don't want to honor vouchers, they shouldn't sign up for vouchers to be used via groupon and they need to learn how to be honest in identifying the restrictions.  Having any restrictions for use of vouchers that an establishment signed up for is obviously a sure sign of being hard up and possibly going under!

But, as with most traditions, change is always inevitable. In this case, the big change for 2016 was the change in location from the Queen Elizabeth Theatre Plaza to the Jack Poole Plaza (site of the 2010 Olympic Cauldron).\\n\\nThe Christmas Market bills itself as German-inspired so we were looking forward to checking them out this year mainly for the food. While they do have a limited number of non-food related stalls selling knick knacks like soaps, jewellery, and ornaments... I don't think there's a huge selection of non-food stalls.\\n\\nIt costs $8 per adult to get into the market but that includes a season pass so you can revisit (handy if you live or work downtown). Definitely a good option to buy the tickets online so you can bypass the lineup to buy tickets at the market.\\n\\nPretzels have always seemed like a quintessential German snack so that's where we started our visit... at the Bavarian Beer & Pretzel Haus. Let me just say that this pretzel was rather disappointing. I expect freshly baked pretzels to be warm and soft in the middle. Unfortunately, this pretzel was rather cold and dry. I've had better pretzels from the mall (like Little Monk Pretzel). Perhaps it was due to the frigid cold morning that we were having but I'd definitely pass on this one.\\n\\nOn the other hand, one of the best things that we had at the Christmas Market this year was the Chimney Cakes. We've seen pictures of similar chimney cakes during the summer night market but I'm not sure if they are the same vendor. The chimney cakes here are made-to-order which means you have to wait a bit for your order but everything is fresh. It's neat seeing them wrap the dough around the rotisserie spit and them spin around the grill until they're baked to a golden brown.\\n\\nWe had ours dusted with cinnamon and then added lemon curd to the middle. They just spread a coat of lemon curd on the inside so it's not overpowering. This was soooo good! You just peel off a piece of the chimney cake and you get a crispy exterior and warm and soft interior. They also have nutella filling if you're more into chocolate but I think I prefer the lemon curd.\\n\\nSince our admission included a season pass and we were off during the week, we came back a couple of days later to try out some more food. The weather was bright and clear but bitterly cold so we figured we should get something hot. Das Gulasch Haus looked like the best bet... come on... who doesn't love food served in a bread bowl? They were having a special for their Austrian beef stew at $11 and the amount of beef that you get in the stew is generous. Since we arrived just past 11am during the weekday, there weren't any crowds so it was easy to find a spot at one of the nearby covered stand-up tables.\\n\\nNo visit to a German-inspired Christmas Market would be complete without a brat so we headed over to the Freybe Brat Haus. This company, whose products you can also find in the grocery store, has been around for 172 years so they know brats. We ordered the original das brat for $8 which is served on a bun with sauerkraut and grilled onions. The brat was a bit on the small size but had a hard time staying in the small bun that was provided.\\n\\nWe also had our eye on the Perogies Haus because the smell of grilled onions was wafting through the air. Since we arrived right when the market opened, the perogies weren't ready yet and we had to come back ten minutes later to grab this order.\\n\\nThey do have some rides for the kiddies or the young at heart but if you're like me, the main reason to come here is for the food. Although our first visit started out a bit slow, there are some good food options here and there are plenty more that we didn't even have time to try.\\n\\nThe Vancouver Christmas Market is open until December 31st this year (ironically closed on Christmas Day)."},{"name":"Wild Ginger","address":"124 Washington St","city":"Norwell","stars":"4.5","text":"Love their noodle dishes!

No one asked us if we wanted anything despite 5 of us sitting in front of the counter waiting. When we got seated, Griffin took our orders fine and told us he would check if he had any cinnamon buns left for one of our orders (spoiler: he didn't). Drinks and food came out randomly and not all at the same time, again not a huge deal but you would think they wouldn't make one server bring over all the food himself. \\n\\nI got the Spicy Chicken Sandwich and the fries were good and I ate about half of the sandwich until I realized my sandwich was about 90% raw. Only reason I didn't notice was because the pickles that were on the sandwich fell off and it felt chewy/mushy. I didn't make a big deal, and waited to get attention from Griffin because other servers didn't want to make eye contact with us. I simply said, my chicken was raw and still had plenty of fries and melon because my appetite was ruined. When they brought me a new sandwich, it was not what I ordered but instead a simple chicken sandwich with crushed bun with ketchup and lettuce, instead of cole slaw and pickles and decided to put no fries?? They didn't say sorry about that until we asked for the check. I had to ask for fries because they didn't ask me. And while we all ate, they didn't come to check if we were doing all right, if we wanted refills or if any one else's food was raw.

This took about EIGHT minutes.  I then realized that I had left my credit card in the checkbook at Gusto.  I immediately called the restaurant.  I spoke to a woman I believe was the manager on duty that night (she was the only one NOT waiting tables when we left).  I gave her my name and explained that I left my card.  She said let me check and came within a few minutes.  She said \\"I have it!  Is it an Austin Telco card with a city scene?\\".  YES I told her.  I said I know you are trying to close, can I come in the morning.  She said \\"YES, I will have it for your in the office, no problem\\".  TODAY before noon I went to Gusto to pick up my card.  The waitress at the bar said she would look for it.  She went into the office, came out, looked in the register at the bar and turned to hand me a blue CHASE bank card.  I said that that was NOT mine.  She replied \\"well then we don't have it\\".  I asked if I could speak to a manager.  She said \\"you want to speak to a manager?\\"  I said yes.  The manager Cameron Lockley came out of the office, walked behind the bar to me and said \\"We don't have your card\\" with a blank face.  Explained my conversation from the night before.  He again looked at me blankly and said \\"We don't have your card, she must have been mistaken that card is the only one we have\\".  I asked him if he could contact the woman I had spoken to the night before.  He responded \\"you want me to call her?\\"  I said YES. He said \\"you want me to call her now?\\"  I said YES, I want you to call her now.  He went back into the office and I assume called her.  He came back a few minutes later and said \\"we do not have your card\\".  Once again staring at me blankly.  I expressed my concern - very irritated at this point, I even checked all around the booth where we had been sitting. NO HELP.  Not until I told him that that was unacceptable did he offer to \\"take my number call if it showed up\\".  BEWARE - I will not say that someone stole my card and it is MISSING but the lack of concern, lack of willingness to TRY and figure out what happened is completely UNACCEPTABLE.  How would the woman know what bank my card was????  Needless to say I have cancelled my card."},{"name":"Burger King","address":"3462 Broadway","city":"Grove City","stars":"2.5","text":"On our way to Cleveland.  Stopped for breakfast.

I'd definitely recommend it for that alone. \\n\\nI think my friends ordered the chicken tikka masala and there was also a taco plate.

I tried the ribs, sausage, and of course brisket. I got sides which were tasty, I don't think you'd be disappointed with any of them but the real star of the show is if course the meat. The meat was fall off the bone good, you could literally cut the meat with a fork. I am a fan of the fatty brisket, and the fat just melted when you ate it. The one thing I did not like was the price. I realize I ordered quit a bit but $40 for lunch for 1 person...ouch. I can eat a nice steak for less.

I like the fact that your table is numbered so once the food order is placed it will be delivered timely versus the waitress bringing it.\\n\\nNow here is why I gave it 3 stars....the waitresses that they have are slow and must be new to waitressing. We ordered daiquiris at the bar because we sat so long without a waitress coming by to take our drink orders. But you are going to have to flag one down or stop one to get some service....I also watched a waitress who barely serviced us take the tip off the table and look around before she did it...it looked shady.\\n\\nMy food came on real plates but I didn't get real silverware. Now this may just be a pet peeve of mine but if I'm eating off of a real plate, I want real silverware. \\n\\nI really hope this place gets in front of the learning curve with their waitresses. Once they work out those kinks, this will be a nice spot to grab a quick bite and have a drink."},{"name":"Burger King","address":"2892 South Orange Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"1.5","text":"Broken Drive Thru Box-  Long backed up lines.

For us, it was way too salty. Like unpleasant to eat salty. For me it seems they just put too heavy of a hand on the dry rub. Yes there is a great smoke smell when you first arrive, but the salt was so over powering in the rub that I could taste anything else. The meat was better when you drown it in sauce and eat it with a pickle and onion. But at that point it feels like you're masking something instead of accentuating. The sides we're good, but probably because they were lightly seasoned. The banana pudding...was light, but not what I was expecting for a banana pudding. Again, long line of people so I think some people enjoy it. I just know when I put a piece of the bark of the beef rib on my tongue, it started to hurt from the amount of salt. If you dislike heavy salt, I wouldn't not recommend this place."},{"name":"Signal Station Pizza","address":"8302 N Lombard St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I don't like writing bummer reviews. I just don't. It seems to go against my grain. However, sometimes I feel like it's necessary. I've eaten probably 50 slices of pizza from here. I give the pizza 3 stars, but the overall place only 2. As to the pizza, the crust is pretty bland put the sauce and toppings make it an okay pizza. For a quick easy slice, it works. The problem I have with the place is that the folks there just don't seem to care much about what you think or even if you come back. It's just the feeling I get. On more than one occasion I've interrupted their smoke break to get a slice. It just feels awkward and they don't seem too happy about it. I've also noticed that the place is getting dirtier and dirtier. If you go there, check out the window sills in that cool old front room. Pretty scary. I just can't go back anymore.

What's the MCLE Back Alley, you ask?   Well, if you are walking on Winter Street towards Park Street, as you're passing through the craziness that is DTX, there's a little side street (Winter Place) off to your left where lawyers go for continuing legal education.    Something always struck me as odd as I never equated continuing legal education and valet parking to be a necessary match, but that was before I knew about the institution that is Locke-Ober.\\n\\nThat's right, institution.   Locke-Ober has been around since 1875, at a time where ladies such as myself were not even allowed to dine within the walls of the Victorian masterpiece.   Of course, that fact alone makes the MCLE building now standing alongside it all that more appropos. \\n\\nContained within the walls of Locke-Ober is a rich history which on its own merit will likely leave you awestruck.  The decorated ceilings, wallpaper etched in golden trim,  electrolier chandeliers, stained glass, and plate glass mirrors to reflect it all around you provides an experience for you like no other.  Locke-Ober is so enchanting that one could almost forget that they are there for some food and cocktails.\\n\\nOh, the delectable, glorious food.  \\n\\nPerhaps start with the \\"potted\\" Escargots Bourguignons, or if you're not as daring, the Jumbo Sea Scallops, Smoked Bacon \\"Hash\\" & Cauliflower Fritters.   Or the \\"JFK Lobster Stew\\", which words can't possibly do justice.\\n\\nA Lobster Savannah as my entree served me quite well, and frankly, I'd recommend a lobster entree of some sort to anyone going to Locke-Ober, at least their first time.   But if that is not your thing,  a Scottish Salmon Roast with Finnan Haddie Potatoes might just be what you are looking for.  Or perhaps the Crisped Sweetbreads with Braised Bacon & Salsify and the Truffle Honey.   If only there were more dishes in the world involving Truffle Honey.  I'm thinking that might be how we could strengthen relations between troubled countries.   'I do not agree with your terroristic attacks on my country, sir, but here's some Truffle Honey.

The parking lot is small (if you went to Kerbey Lane when it was in this location it will take you back) and we had to park back down the side street. There was one party of 6 waiting for a table to be cleaned and us. We were quoted 20-30 and the wait was about half that. \\n\\nThe beginning of service was a little slow. The restaurant seemed busy but not slammed. Tables began to open shortly after we arrived and a few tables stayed open. We ordered soft drinks after around 5 minutes and they arrived around 5 minutes later. We were ready to order but there was another wait to order. \\n\\nThe appetizer was slow to come. We were ok as long as the meals didn't come immediately following. We had time with the appetizer but the pacing was a little off. \\n\\nFrom there, everything was great with service. They seemed to catch up from the rush that must have finished before we arrived. \\n\\nThere was nothing to complain about in service but it was like being in a restaurant in the middle of a rush that wasn't in the middle of a rush. \\n\\nNow the food. Great! Everything we had was good. \\n\\nThe trippple play appetizer had something for all of us (family of 5). The kids gravitated to the queso and ranch based dip. I loved the pimento cheese. The queso was good but not unique. The ranch dip was unique with diced tomatoes and blue cheese crumbles. I love pimento cheese, this was good, and you don't get it at a lot of places. The potato chips were good but the 3 dips were the stars (although my daughter really liked the chips). \\n\\nThe fried chicken (think chicken and waffles) were very good. Great preparation and cooked perfectly. My youngest loved it. The meat loaf I had was good. It was a stack of a savory donut, a potato latke, meat loaf, and an over medium egg. My oldest enjoyed his CFS (basically swap the proteins on what I had). My wife's salad was the most surprisingly good thing we were served. Nice salad with candied pecans, strawberries, and fried chicken. I will order a salad on my next visit. \\n\\nThe dessert deserves a new paragraph. We're were stuffed but ordered a \\"cherry bomb\\" to share. Homemade donut holes with spiced cherry sauce (like pie filling) and a glaze (pretty sure there was some cream cheese in the glaze).
