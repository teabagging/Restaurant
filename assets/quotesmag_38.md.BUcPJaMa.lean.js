Though I still visit Sherman more frequently, I've come to love Bloc 11 for a few things.\\n\\nFor one, you can always find a seat here - this space is cavernous.  Diesel in Davis Square is probably about the same size but it's rare to find an open seat there even in off-hours.  I love the outdoor seating complete with a well-maintained patch of grass and ivy-covered wall.  People watching in Union Square has never been better!\\n\\nThe coffee and tea is high quality, or at least the iced varities are (I almost never drink hot beverages).  The sandwiches are tasty but I feel like there's not a ton of variety in the selection - many feature similar combinations of ingredients.  And they come only in one size - at Sherman you can order a half sized, and Oxford Spa offers a small for a few dollars less.  The baked goods are decent - Sherman has them beat by a mile, but Bloc 11's selection is solid and aside from a rock-hard cookie, everything I've had is great.\\n\\nOther plusses - you can usually find a discarded newspaper to read, and there's a very good chance it will be today's paper.  Grab yourself a few random sections of the Globe and the Times and kill an hour or two!\\n\\nThey have occasional performances in the early evening hours, including an open mic night that seems to attract cute girls.\\n\\nThe downside - no free wifi.  While laptop campers annoy the hell out of me, it would be nice to check my email someplace besides my sunless apartment sometimes.  Sherman seems to have the best solution - you can pay for it, or get an hour free with a purchase.  Because after all, who's going to be so lame as to go into a cafe and set up a laptop without buying something? \\n\\nI think it's great that there are two very cool independent cafes in my neighborhood - it's kind of like how Davis Square was a few years ago when they had Diesel and the Someday.

The squid was very chewy, and the batter was made soggy by the raw pickled peppers. I also got a few raw clams on the half shell, which were also very tough. I've never had raw bar I didn't enjoy so I don't think my standards are that high - but these were borderline inedible. The fact that they were riddled with shell shards didn't help.\\n\\nI got the burger, which would have been decent if it weren't for the roll, which was either stale or just plain dry or poor quality - it completely disintegrated in my hands.\\n\\nThe best (least bad) things we ordered were items it's pretty easy for any greasy spoon restaurant to get right: kids' chicken fingers, french fries, and cole slaw. Everything else was mediocre at best. Especially for the surprisingly high prices they charge, the food quality was very disappointing. \\n\\nThe waitress was nice enough, but wasn't all that good at her job.

And we longed to return to the restaurant upon every visit to Vancouver. \\n\\nWe started a family and moved overseas so we had a long break where we didn't visit our Canadian sister city.  We returned in 2016 and visited the new location. 1/2 of our dishes were amazing. 1/2 were not much to write home about.

We raved about the amazing food, the service and the ambiance. The best part of the night?  An 8 minute wait for a table on Canada Day. We sat next to Elijah Wood.  While kind and hospitable, our server didn't know much about the food. The lamb was easily forgettable and needed more seasoning. The saag paneer was as good as any in every Indian restaurant I've ever dined in. Definitely not a $25 dish. The short ribs were severely lacking in flavor. The samosas, naan and goat curry were strong.  At the end, we were charged for another party's drinks. An additional $100 in alcohol. We caught it, but it should not have happened. \\n\\nI grew up in a Southern California town which had a significant indian population - lots of authentic food in my childhood friend's homes and lots of good food in neighborhood eateries.

Both of these bastardized forms of Indian food can compete with Vij's fine dining. I don't they should be able to. Vij's was once amazing. It can be again. Dishes require innovation.

For me, I'm all about the atmosphere and if I feel a restaurant is lacking in theme, then it just doesn't draw me in.  It looks like your typical fine dining restaurant and though the view during the day (overlooking Bay Lake and the grand pool) would be wonderful, in the dark, you cannot really see much out the windows.  There is a large mural, which is neat, but since the restaurant is L-shaped, you must be sitting on one side of the L to enjoy the mural (I was not).  In addition, even though there were numerous open tables near a window and open tables in the room with the mural, we were sat in a rather crowded corner next to another couple near the entrance of the restaurant.  I should have asked to be moved, but I really didn't feel like making a stink...However, I can say that the food was great (as was the service...although, I really have yet to have poor service at a Disney restaurant...in particular the Signature Restaurants).  We got the Cedar Plank Salmon and though I usually do not enjoy salmon, I have to say, this was delicious.  It was fresh and had a much-less fishy flavor than I have come to associate with salmon.  For dessert, we enjoyed the artist point cobbler, which was wonderful, but not quite as good as I had expected (because I had such high expectations of it from other's reviews).

The food I had here was OK (hits and misses). I would come back.\\n\\nThis is more of a takeout joint, but they do have seating if you want to dine in. There's table seating inside for about 15 and outside for about 12. The tables are small and placed closely together. Our table was wobbly. There are only 2 parking spaces assigned to Pita in the tight lot out front, but there are plenty more spaces behind the building.\\n\\nIt's hard not to compare this place to Tannour Grill, another fast casual Mediterranean restaurant, which opened a month prior just two doors down. Tannour is a bigger operation. It's got a decent-sized dining room with a Chipotle-style serving line, two (visible) spits in the kitchen, and a fountain machine. Poppin Pita doesn't have any of that stuff and is really just a hole in the wall.\\n\\nI think I prefer Tannour over Poppin Pita because they have more space, service is quicker, and their food seems better to me, particularly their meats and rice. However, I do think Poppin Pita's hummus and falafel are superior to Tannour's. Generally, both places serve relatively healthy Mediterranean food in large, satisfying portions and are good for takeout.\\n\\nPoppin Pita's menu includes appetizers like hummus, falafel, labna (yogurt), and rice; salads (tahini, Jerusalem, grilled chicken, yogurt and cucumber); and meats like chicken and beef shawarma, chicken and beef kabobs, and kofta (seasoned ground beef) kabobs. The meats can be ordered as sandwiches (in pita bread or a wrap) or as platters which come with rice, salad, hummus, and pita bread. Apps run about $3-4 each, salads and sandwiches $6-8 each, and platters $7-8 (half size) or $10-12 (full size).\\n\\nWhether you're dining in or taking out, all food is served in white foam disposable containers. If ordering takeout, the employees will bag your order up. There's a table with self-serve plastic cutlery and napkins.\\n\\nWe went for dinner and ordered:\\n\\n* Falafel (4 pieces, $2.99) - ground chickpeas mixed with special blend of herbs, fried\\n* Mixed Shawarma Platter ($11.99) - marinated char-grilled chicken and thin-cut marinated sirloin beef with onion, parsley, and sumac; and rice, hummus, salad, and pita bread\\n* Mixed Kabob Platter ($11.99) - cubes of boneless chicken breast and beef marinated in garlic and spices; and rice, hummus, salad, and pita bread\\n\\nThere was only 1 customer in front of us and it took a while (about 10-15 minutes) for our order to come out. The guy behind us had to wait even longer and was apologized to for the delay.\\n\\nThe falafel was terrific. It tasted fresh and hot out the fryer. Crispy and delicious with specks of parsley on top. They came with a side of tahini. I recommend them. You can also get 8 pieces for $4.99 or 12 pieces for $6.99.\\n\\nI was disappointed in the meats, both the shawarma and the kabobs. I thought they were dry. Maybe we came at a bad time (weeknight dinner) and got dried out batches. The only meat that I really enjoyed was the beef shawarma. The other meats were so dry that I felt they needed some sort of sauce (I resorted to eating them with the tahini and hummus that came with our meal) to make them more palatable. The beef kabobs in particular seemed overcooked.\\n\\nThe shawarma and kabob meats were served over rice. I also found the rice to be disappointing. It wasn't very flavorful and, like the meats, seemed dried out. A couple pieces of pita bread were served with each platter and I thought they were fine. The mixed shawarma platter came with a side of tahini while the mixed kabob platter did not.\\n\\nThe salad and hummus that came with the platters were tasty. I believe the salad was Jerusalem salad (lettuce, cucumber, red onion, tomato, parsley, salt, lemon, olive oil, pepperoncino). It was tangy and refreshing. I like how the salads come with one pepperoncino each. The hummus was excellent. They put whole green olives in their hummus and it comes with plenty of olive oil, parsley, and sumac (spice). I wish the amount of salad and hummus they serve with the platters was bigger, but they are limited by the size of the boxes.\\n\\nThe staff was friendly. Payments are handled over tablet via Square so you can receive automatic receipts via text and email.\\n\\nThis place is so small that there is no dedicated customer restroom. If you ask, they might let you use the one behind the counter in the back.\\n\\nOh and by the way, Poppin Pita is endorsed by Shaq: https://twitter.com/shaq/status/672581333927919616."},{"name":"Story Book Dining at Artist Point with Snow White","address":"901 Timberline Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"This is a Disney simulation of fine dining, and not a very good one.

Staff were super relaxed, friendly and attentive.\\n\\nThe Tom Yum Koong started the meal off nicely, with a moderately bright kick of lemongrass and galangal. Appetites whetted, the anticipation grew. But to our dismay, each subsequent dish fell flat, and flatter. The beef in the salad was overcooked, the salad was missing acidity; the fish curry overly sweet, and the duck curry contained very few bland, flaccid pieces of duck. Pad Thai, while indeed there was no ketchup present, there was also not much other presence; a little on the tart side. For our palates, we all found the dishes missing balance in their flavour profiles. (A thai iced tea was ordered half-sweet, and was still way too sweet for the three at the table who tasted it.)\\n\\nPerhaps if I'm in the area and in need of a Thai fix, I will give BLT another go.

I ordered the Enchiladas Diablo last night for take out. First of all Taco Bell's mild sauce is spicier than that so-called chipolte sauce they top it with. It's also very citrusy like ceviche. Not cool, considering it wasn't the flavor I was looking for. So I called up to the place and spoke with the same person I placed my to go order with, who was pretty pushy both times considering I tipped her on the take out order. Being in the service industry I know many of these cheap people out here in Austin do not do that. I then spoke to a woman who claims to be the manager or such. Who also contradicted herself when she was making up excuses for why the menu item was misleading and then admitted later that the chipotle sauce did have citrus in it as I expected. She also stated that due to guest complaints that they made it mild. She also asked me if I used the Avacado with it? How is that supposed to make it spicier? Once again Diablo en engles es Devil, hell is hot? The only thing she could offer me was 50% off the next time I came in there I politely rejected considering the best thing in our order was the Chicken Tortilla Soup that wasn't even that great. I will not be returning to Texican Cafe at my own will let alone if I was invited for free the answer is hell no. I'm not gonna let  anyone I know waste their money on the surprise you may get when ordering from there.

Add an over-priced bottle of Embruix or two at $60 per bottle ($25 online) and four people can easily pay $350 including tip, hardly the advertised $30 per person. In good Catalonian tradition, this is tasty bar food, not gourmet food, but it does offer interesting alternatives to the omnipresent Barbecue and Tex-mex. If one knows what he/she is craving, ceviche ($12), some bread and a glass of wine or a flank steak with fries ($14) and a glass of wine, perhaps it's tolerable.

Since I'm trying to break him in easy (e.g., he's not ready for the places where half a pig hangs on a hook and the fish comes to the table with its head still in place), Get Sum Dim Sum works for us. It's not exactly authentic, but then again, it isnt so off base that you can't recognize familiar dishes like char siu bao and har gao (or however there spelled--think Chinese barbecued pork kolaches and shrimp dumplings). While the lack of cart service makes it feel like something is missing from the whole dim sum experience, the dry-erase menus are a bit ingenious.\\n\\nAll told, Get Sum Dim Sum is a good place to introduce people to dim sum; however, the prices are high for such small portions.

They did have a few more filling options than those other burrito fast casual places (you know who I'm talking about): pulled chicken, tofu, ground beef, steak, shrimp, pork, beans, green chiles, potato, and broccoli(!). They also do burrito specials: chicken and broccoli, pork and green chiles, potato broccoli and green chiles, and steak and shrimp. Then there are a whole lot of free extras (cilantro, jalapenos - pickled or fresh, onion, salsa) and extras for a small fee (grilled onions, guacamole, etc.). The food was okay, just nothing to write home about. Definitely a decent lunch or dinner on the go. However, I think part of what makes those other burrito fast casual places work so well is that you can see your choices! Oh, the chicken looks great today or oh, I really like the look of their guacamole. At Bell Street Burritos, you order at the counter and they bring it to you.

I booked a hotwire deal and got this hotel. It worked well for us because it turned out to be the same hotel that my husband had a convention at so we didn't have to change hotels after the weekend. The fitness center is better than most fitness centers at hotels and the Spa looked nice but I was too busy exploring Orlando to spend time at the spa. The Concierge is really nice and they will give you free tickets to the I- Drive Trolley. Just know if you use the trolley for Universal you will have to walk from the Wet N Wild stop about a mile to Universal and it can be hot. The I drive trolley will take you to restaurants, the Eye, shops, Sea World and Outlets from this hotel. The hotel is within walking distance to the Orlando Pointe for great access to restaurants, Victorias Secret and movies. However if you are coming for the Disney parks I would recommend staying near Disney. We spend $70 for a taxi RT to the Disney parks and then rented a car for $43 to go to Downtonw Disney. This Concierge does sell a Mears Shuttle to the Disney parks for $10 RT but only runs scheduled times and requires advance notice something we did not know until later in our stay. \\nThe rooms are nice and the bed has great fluffy pillows. There is a TV in the mirror of the bathroom. My favorite part was the complimentary water each day. So many hotels charge $5 a bottle of water and I was grateful for this perk. One thing I learned going to the Disney parks is to bring a water bottle with you and you can refill at the water fountains located near most restrooms. Exploring Orlando theme parks in the hot humid heat will leave you dehydrated and I was super impressed of the free water bottles left each in the room. They even give you a fridge in your room which is great for families. \\nThe hotel also has a National car rental desk and you can rent a car for $43 a day less expensive than cab rides. \\nThey have a 24 hour diner and the food is actually really good. I went there three times for breakfast and once for take out dinner. The desserts are beautiful in the case and hard to pass up. \\nThere is a bar in the hotel which stays busy most evenings due to their convention business. \\nThe main pool area is really nice too with a bar area. There are other pools located on the property too if this one becomes busy with young kids. \\nThere is also a tennis court on the property.

Again, the marinara is the star, but the supporting cast of homemade spaghetti noodles and tastily prepared eggplant medallions or chicken do their part to make the food fortifying and delicious. \\nA good way to start your meal at the Florentine is with the antipasto salad, a heaping plate of house dressing-tossed lettuce, sliced tomatoes, pepperoncini, anchovies, bleu cheese, cold cuts, and provolone. You may not want your regular dinner salad after the antipasto.\\nThe service is generally good at the Florentine, but there've been a few times when our server wasn't on top of the game. Not a real big deal though.  As far as decor, the back room preserves more of the dim, warm color scheme that the restaurant has displayed for most of its life, while the front dining room has taken what is to me an unappealing turn toward the pastel and geriatric.\\nAll in all, if you spend time in Columbus and haven't made it to the Florentine yet, I recommend you put it high on your list of places to try soon."},{"name":"Ginza Japanese Steak & Sushi Bar","address":"1101 E Colonial Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3","text":"Q:  Why did the headless chicken cross the road?\\n\\nA:  Because it is a server or hostess or manager at Ginza.\\n\\nI wish I could say something more positive about the place.  It's a nice decor and it's close to home and it's hibachi.  But the previous reviewers have pretty much nailed it.\\n\\nThe good:\\n\\nIt's in a great location at Colonial & Mills.  It's beautiful inside.  Somebody spent  a fortune on tile alone.  It has its own parking behind the the building.  The menu is hibachi and sushi.  The prices are good compared to Kobe, Samurai, Benihana, etc.  The hibachi chefs really really try.  And the hibachi chefs do a good show.  Lots of FIRE!  The hibachi special for $13.95 is really unbeatable in terms of value.\\n\\nThe not so good:\\n\\nThe food is kind of bland - from the sauces to the fried rice to everything else.  Soy is cheap, use more of it.\\n\\nAnd the service.  The service is ...  The service is ....  Ok, the service is an insult to headless chickens everywhere.\\n\\nOn our first trip, we were the only group at our hibachi table on a Thursday night.  We ordered drinks.  Nothing fancy.  A Kirin.  White wine.  Crown & coke.  Gin & tonic.  The server reappears at our table, most apologetic.  They can't serve us.  They don't have a bar tender and they don't know how to make the drinks.  Seriously.  After MUCH discussion, the manager finally agreed to try to make the drinks.  He went behind the bar, trailed by waitresses, bus boys, hostesses, and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir to attempt the intricacies of the Crown & Coke.  Complete with an e x a c t 1 oz pour from the the shot glass.  \\n\\nOn the second try on a Friday night .... we discovered that not only can the hostess not really speak English, but she can't count either.  The first attempt to seat our party of three failed when the party of five at the hibachi table (including three kids in high chairs) had spread out to take all 8 seats.  And could not be persuaded in broken Engrish to move.  Thanks, we'll wait for the next table.\\n\\nThe second attempt almost failed, and perhaps mercifully should have, when the hostess seated a group of nine and then brought us to join them.  Lets see, twelve into eight seats.  So we kinda had to sit at the next table that is laid out back to back with a counter top bridge.\\n\\nOur waiter was a complete and total space case.  Maybe they were doing bong hits of hash in the back.  I don't know.  It took 20 minutes after we were seated to get drink orders.  He took some, then he left, then he came back.  It took forever to get the first round.  Reorders were an ordeal.  I never got one of my reorders, but I got charged for it.  He never brought two rounds for my wife, but at least he didn't charge us for them.  We ordered sushi appetizers.  An hour later and two reminders later, he finally put the order in ... and blamed it on a sushi backup.  As I watched the two sushi chefs standing idly, watching the Magic game on TV.  I never did get mine.  My wife's tuna nigiri had slices so thin you read through them.  \\n\\nIf they could get their act together, this could be a good place.  Or, it's going to be gone."},{"name":"Miel Brasserie","address":"510 Atlantic Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Brunch review only - Came here as a plan B option when on our way to an afternoon at the ICA (institute of Contemporary Art).  Had intended to hit the Sinatra Sunday brunch at Lucky's but came here to Miel when Lucky's wasn't open at 10:30 (Lucky's WHY don't you put your hours of operation on your dang website or on a recording with hours on your phone line? Why? Why?).\\n\\nThe french country decor is calming and comfy yet sophisticated.  Lots of mellow yellow hues and textures of honeycomb were sweet and somewhat witty given Miel = honey.  Nice contrast to the cavernous yet beautiful lobby of the Intercontinental.\\n\\nThe waitstaff sets you up with lots of amenities upon seating you (newspaper, nice tall glass of chilled water, a trio of frou frou french jams/honey - Bon Maman).  I had a very well-prepared cappuccino, but was disappointed by the fact no one around was partaking in a nice mimosa or Bellini.  These standard brunch libations were missing from the menu as well despite the fact that we were dining right next to a rum/champagne bar (the brunch buffet gets set up in here on Sundays, apparently).\\n\\nNo one but me seemed to have been craving a sparkling champagne treat at 11:30, though and I stuck to the cappuccino and lots of iced water.  My husband did have some excellent fresh squeezed grapefruit juice, though.\\n\\nStay away from the buffet or combination brunch meals - I have to agree with Laura P. who called out the Intercontinental Breakfast (fruit, breads, eggs, breakfast meat) as an overpriced rip-off.  It is.  We ordered a la carte rather than get that or the buffet (which was nothing to write home about for $20).\\n\\nMy husband had the lobster benedict ($17), which we've had at several other places like Arno's on Main in Nantucket and the Maine Diner.  Folks - let me tell you I was expecting that the lobster benedict would not stand up to those we've had in the past - but Miel's lobster benedict was great!  Large sections of lobster, and not just the claws.  I give credit where credit is due - Miel deserves credit for their lobster benedict.\\n\\nCredit also for the smoked salmon benedict (also $17).  After eating it I realized it could have used capers but the smokiness of the salmon and the softness of the hollandaise sauce did not really leave me looking for anything more at the time-  I was too busy enjoying my breakfast (especially after traipsing from Lucky's to the Intercontinental on foot).\\n\\nIf you feel ripped off by your brunch, just make up for it by slathering your toast or pastry with some Bon Maman honey, marmalade, or jelly.  When we saw these on the table display I was pleased - I indulge in the cherry preserves/conserve once in a while and noted that the full sized versions of these made in France yummies sell for almost $8 in the grocery store.  \\n\\nAfter brunch, relax in the beautiful waterfront garden at the rear of the hotel and right outside of Miel."},{"name":"White's Bakery","address":"100 Derby St","city":"Hingham","stars":"3.5","text":"I grew up in Hingham and remember when White's opened.

I was thisclose to ordering my wedding cakes from them.  Today, though, I'm rating White's based solely on their frosted chocolate brownies.  So fudgy, moist, and decadent!  My mom schlepped them from Hingham to Barismo in Arlington as a birthday dessert surprise for my husband.  I thought the sweetness might be overwhelming, but they perfectly complemented the complex flavors of the Barismo coffees we tasted (an Ethiopian and one from Burundi).

They are essentially candied peanuts with a little kick. I had to order them twice. Yeah that good. I'm also a fan of kimchee and they offer a nice variety of pickled veggies.

The burger was cooked quite well but a little on the smaller side for the price. I really enjoyed the bacon sriracha aioli, which was creamy and savory but ans spicy at all. The French fries were thinly sliced and nicely fried. I liked the burger better than the short rib sandwich, which was not as tender and flavorful as I had hoped. The meat also had a slight flavor that tasted almost gamey. The chips were well made but slightly underseasoned and didn't have as much flavor as the fries. \\n\\nOverall, a decent pub with quite good food, but a little expensive for the amount and quality of food.

I recognized them because I still own two of those exact adventures.  \\n\\nI'm old and a geek.\\n\\nI spotted most of the humorous references sprinkled VERY generously in the menu.  And not the obvious ones like adding \\"Skywalker,\\" \\"Frodo,\\" or \\"Starfleet\\" to dishes, but subtle geek shout-outs like naming alcoholic shots \\"Essence of Gelfling,\\" \\"Snow Crash,\\" and \\"King in Yellow.\\"  I understood all of those.  \\n\\nI could walk in and scream, \\"When single shines the triple sun.  What was sundered and undone shall be whole.  The two made one!\\" and someone behind the bar would look at me, nod, and ensure a seat was available.  I ever thought I'd feel so welcome in a pub, and I generally hate them.  Like the way I hate the last two seasons of Battlestar Galactica, Michael Bay's filmography, Aliens: Colonial Marines, and nappies...\\n\\n...what?  I started the list when I was two years old and never got around to remove anything.\\n \\nBut I stepped into the Storm Crow Tavern and fell in love...and this was not their big budget location.  That's the Alehouse a few kilometers away.  The Tavern is smaller, and I guess considerably less sanitary.  That's the issue with many of these downtown Vancouver spots, built in locations that would've been torn down anywhere else.  The place carries a whiff of anal gas emissions, and the bathroom should be burned to ash.  It's far too warm, requiring the entire front window to open into the street.  \\n\\nBut I didn't care; it's a gamer/geek-themed pub.  You can randomize your alcoholic shot by rolling a d20, awarding you a double-shot and the glass if scoring a natural 20.  You can do the same when deciding toppings on your sundae, which I did.  I don't do shots, just don't, and I rolled twice.  I thought being a 30-year DM/GM veteran would assure me a natural 20, but alas, no luck on either roll.  \\n\\nThe walls are plastered in geek culture, culminating in a faux-stone Cthulhu dominating the d√©cor.  My girlfriend and I even brought a game to play (even though you can borrow one from their significant collection), Tiny Epic Galaxies.  Later that evening, they started up their trivia night.  We didn't play given other pressing matters, but I admired the questions being asked, taking pride when I knew most them (The co-creator of D&D was Dave Arneson, you dolts).   \\n\\nI really want to love the Storm Crow Tavern.  It's a restaurant built for me.  \\n\\nIt's just so depressing that the food sucks.  \\n\\nI mean it's bad, almost unforgivably shocking.  We opened with the Baron Samedi Voodoo Tacos with Cajun chicken, cilantro, cabbage, sriracha mayo, and lime.  As we ate them, nearly a quarter cup of water pooled on our plate from the leaking tacos.  Although the tacos weren't bad, the dripping was unappetizing.  We followed that with the Superappetizer Megaplater, which included French fries, hot wings (sorry, Romulan Wings of Vengeance), onion rings, chicken strips, perogies and served with the standard dipping sauces.  And wow, this was bland.  The fries were rubbery, the perogies tasted store-bought, and the chicken was...just...chicken strips, like the ones seen in yellow boxes at Superstore.  \\n\\nI was bored half through the meal but was still excited for the upcoming Dungeon Master's Sinister Sundae.  I rolled the dice five times but had no idea what was coming.  Not one result was duplicated.  I waited patiently...\\n\\n...Who is the \\"frelling\\" \\"fahrbot\\" putting gummies on a sundae!?  I mean, you'd have to be out of your \\"gorram\\" mind.  Toppings should be soft or crunchy, never chewy.  I had chocolate malts and crunchy gingerbread (I think), whipped cream, bananas, and a cherry.  Those were good.  And then two different types of gummi.  Way to ruin a sundae, folks.  I know that's the chance you take when you roll the die, but seriously, I'm paying $15 for this; the least you could do is make the choices appealing.\\n\\nI'm going to hit up the alehouse before this vacation is out.  In hoping it's better (spoiler, it was).  It promises to be given its position sitting on the upper echelon of pubs in town.

The storefront is located on Stewart Road and is visible from Buford Highway, particularly when heading south. La Casona is one of only a handful of restaurants I'm aware of that serves authentic Colombian cuisine inside the perimeter.\\n\\nThe business is open seven days a week, 9am to 8pm, serving breakfast, lunch, and early dinner. $6.99 breakfast specials are offered until 11:30am and $7.95-8.95 lunch specials are offered from 11:30am-3:00pm. Certain special dishes are available on the weekends only. Some of these dishes include sancocho de gallina (hen soup), mondongo (tripe soup), and medallones de bagre en leche de coco (fish soup in coconut milk).\\n\\nThe restaurant is in a standalone building with a small parking lot. The interior of the restaurant is spacious with several sections of seating. Most of the tables are four-tops and there are a few booths. The restaurant is clean and the atmosphere is casual.\\n\\nThere is quite a bit of variety on the menu. It includes tostones (salty fried plantain slices), appetizers such as empanadas, arepitas (Colombian cornmeal fritters), chorizo sausage, and soups, spaghetti pasta dishes, arepas (Colombian corn-based flatbreads), seafood, Bandeja Paisa (traditional Colombian food platter), steaks, pork, chicken, and desserts such as figs with dulce de leche and flan. Beverage-wise, they offer many Colombian fruit juices (with and without milk) and Colombian sodas too (e.g. Colombiana).\\n\\nOutside of the breakfast and lunch specials, expect to spend roughly $3-6 each for most of the appetizers, $6-7 for each arepa (they're big), $10-15 per soup, $10-16 each for most of the meat and seafood entrees, and $11-13 each for the Bandeja Paisa platters. Portion sizes are generous and I consider this place a good value.\\n\\nHere's a rundown of the items I've tried:\\n\\nAppetizers/Sides:\\nEmpanada - stuffed beef pastry\\nMorcilla con arepita - traditional rice sausage with arepita\\nFried yuca with garlic sauce\\n\\nEntrees:\\nTostones with chicken\\nLengua (tongue) arepa\\nArepa with chicken, pineapple, and avocado\\nPechuga a la Plancha - grilled chicken entree\\nMondongo - tripe soup\\nBandeja Paisa - grilled steak, pork skin, egg, sausage, sweet plantains, avocado, arepita, rice and beans\\n\\nBeverages:\\nGuanabana (soursop juice) with milk\\nGuayaba - guava juice\\nLulo juice\\n\\nMy favorite dish is the Bandeja Paisa. The full version is about $13 and the \\"mini\\" version is about $11. The mini version contains all of the foods listed in the description in the list above except for chorizo sausage. Both contain a lot of food.\\n\\nThe grilled steak is a cheap cut, but it's hard to complain given the price. Two chicharron strips (pork skin/rinds) are provided, a fried egg, the aforementioned chorizo link, two maduros, a fresh half avocado slice, arepita, rice, and beans. I like the plump and flavorful sausage the best followed by the fatty chicharron strips. The arepitas (small arepas) are soft and appetizing. The white rice seems to be lightly seasoned with salt.\\n\\nThe morcilla is good and savory. It's Colombia's version of blood sausage, made with cooked and congealed bloods plus rice and spices. The empanada and fried yuca aren't bad. The empanada is flaky and moist while the yuca is cooked to order and served piping hot.\\n\\nThe tostones and arepas are straightforward and look rather plain, but they taste better than they look. One order of tostones comes with four tostones (plantain slices topped with ingredients). Four tostones fill an entire plate. The chicken tostones are topped with seasoned, shredded chicken.\\n\\nOne arepa takes up most of a plate. The lengua arepa comes with a heaping portion of chopped beef tongue cooked with tomatoes, peppers, and spices. It's lengua overload and perfect for those who are a fan of beef tongue. The arepa with chicken, pineapple, and avocado tastes exactly how it sounds. It uses the same seasoned, shredded chicken as described in the tostones above. The pineapple chunks taste less like pineapple and more like applesauce or apple pie.\\n\\nThe mondongo soup is tasty. It's made from tripe (cow's stomach) plus various other ingredients such as potatoes and carrots. The broth is light, slightly oily, yellow in color, and the soup is topped with a bit of cilantro. The tripe is diced. Note tripe can be an acquired taste as it does have a unique finish to it. Some may find the taste/odor unpleasant. The soup comes with a side plate of rice, tostones, slaw, and avocado.\\n\\nThe Pechuga a la Plancha is a basic satisfying dish. Its sister dish, Pechuga Empanizada (breaded chicken cutlet), looks comforting as well. Both come with rice, salad, and a side.\\n\\nThe juices are A-OK. Of the ones I've tried, I prefer the guava. The juices are on the milder side. Lulo is a Colombian fruit which looks like a small orange. The fruit also resembles a tomato, but it has a citrus flavor.\\n\\nService is very good.

We didn't have reservations so we decided to show up early...at 6pm.  The place was packed, all the tables were taken or reserved, luckily the hostess was able to seat us at the chef's table/counter which comprised of 6 bar stools over looking the kitchen...it was an AWESOME experience.  \\n\\nDrinks:\\n-Green Room and Ron Raike Ravenous Ruby Red Ale - loved this ale!  Just the right amount of bitterness to start our meal and take the edge away from our big feast.  \\n-The Ravenous Pig Old Fashioned - read so much about this drink on Yelp that we had to try one.  Bacon infused bourbon, maple syrup, and garnished with a slice of bacon...the presentation was classy yet different with the bacon.  At first sip the drink was STRONG...but we followed fellow Yelper recommendations and let the drink sit and boy what a difference 10-15 mins can make - the ice melted, the flavors blended together, and the drink became super smooth!\\n\\nStarters:\\n-Gruyere Biscuits - 4 warm cheesy biscuits that started off our feast.  The smoked butter that came with the biscuits was to die for!\\n-Crispy Pig's Feet - Not what I had expected (which was a crispy fried pig's feet.)  The dish looked more like a fried patty than pig's feet.  It was served beautifully on the plate with a bed of gravy with fried pickles.  The unexpected textures and flavors were delish.\\n-House-made Charcuterie and Artisan Cheese - this came with a smorgasbord of goodies.  A jar of pickled cauliflowers, foie gras parfait, sopresata, bresaola, mortadella, blue cheese...the list goes on and on.  It's served with a basket of different artisan breads.  The charcuterie was pretty good, the stand out items was definitely the pickled cauliflowers and foie gras parfait.  \\n-Side of the house truffle fries - served in a beer glass, these fries were fried to golden perfection.  But I didn't taste the truffle flavor.\\n\\nEntrees:\\n-Pork Porterhouse - OMG...huge cut of pork...but it was delicious.  The porterhouse was cooked to perfection, tender and moist it was delicious.  Served with a side of cantaloupes which I thought was strange at first but one bite and I was hooked, the cantaloupe went surprisingly well with the pork.  \\n\\nDessert:\\n-Sorbet - you get to mix and match 3 flavors.  We picked raspberry and coconut.  A refreshing way to end our meal.\\n\\nOverall: Service here was excellent, the server was attentive and friendly and definitely knew a lot about the menu.  Loved that we got to sit at the chef's table/counter, definitely helped with the overall experience when you get to see everything that's going on in the kitchen and the amazing food that's coming out of it.

I like music, but not pounding rock during a meal.  So we went inside and asked how long the wait would be for the patio around the side of the building.  We were told, 15 minutes.  An hour later we went in and asked if they had seating inside.  They did.  No apology for letting us wait so long.  We should have left, but we didn't.\\n\\nWe were seated and I realized this higher priced restaurant had not bothered with basic sound baffles in their establishment so sitting inside, the music was muffled from outside, but the voices of people in the restaurant were a loud background.\\n\\nWe ordered, water, glass of wine and two appetizers; calamari and lobster bisque.  For dinner we ordered the filet mignon and duck.  Twenty minutes later we got our water and glass of wine.  Fifteen minutes after that, we got the calamari.  The lobster bisque never appeared.  We should have left.  The calamari was fine.  I ordered it knowing they did not have a marinara for it, they had it with an Asian fusion kind of dipping sauce with ponzu.  I didn't try that so I don't know, maybe I would have liked it and it would have made the calamari complete.  Instead they had tried to accommodate me by giving me a creole tomato sauce which didn't work, but whatever.  I had some left over and had marinara at home and the calamari was excellent, even reheated.\\n\\nTwenty or so minutes later our main dishes arrived.  We both tried each dish.  The filet was cooked to my requested medium and was tender and bland.  All they needed to do to bring out the flavor of a cut like that was a simple sprinkle of salt to make it shine.  They didn't.  It was a bland, fairly flavorless result.  Adding salt made it a bit better, but it really makes a difference to put salt on before cooking.  The meat was on a bed of potatoes.  The potatoes were tasteless.  No salt, no butter, no milk, no cream, no nothing to give it some flavor.  There was a topping of about a tablespoon of beautifully fresh greens in a light sauce.  That was the only thing on the plate worth eating, but not for $40.\\n\\nThe duck was ordered well done.  Yes, I know, not what the gourmands would demand, but I like it well done and can cook it at home well done and it is wonderful.  I am not an excellent cook, let alone a chef, but I can cook a duck breast better than the one we got.  It was dry and hard on the outside.  The inside of the breast was fine though and overall, the seasoning was well done.  Again, it was pretty much just a touch of salt to bring out the best of the protein and whoever cooked it had done so.  It came on a bed of sweet potato.  That was the best thing of the whole meal, lol, but a little salty.  Even with that, the sweet potato was excellent.  Not good enough to compensate for the $25 paid for it.\\n\\nOverall, service sucked but was very friendly.  The food was carelessly prepared and not anywhere near good enough for the price paid."},{"name":"Rimsky-Korsakoffee House","address":"707 SE 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"I saw this place was still open and had a night time craving for dessert.

Everyone can have an \\"off night\\" at work, but rolling your eyes when asked if an Italian restaurant had bruschetta is a little much, no? Then when my boyfriend asked about the ingredients in certain items on the menu, because he can't eat eggs, the waiter wasn't knowledgeable at all about the food. He mentioned they had eggless pasta and when we asked what was in it (since egg is crucial in regular pasta) he didn't know and wouldn't go ask the chef. Odd.. Lastly, when it was determined that my boyfriend unfortunately had limited options on the menu that he could eat (yes, shame on us for not checking the menu before stopping by but we thought they were going to have some typical Italian menu items that we know he can eat) our waiter said \\"maybe next time you should eat at an Indian restaurant\\" (my bf is Indian). Granted, he was kind of laughing when he said it, and I don't think English is his first language, so I'm hoping he didn't mean any offense..but does that make it less rude or unnecessary?

I had a manager tell me its's normal to only have as few as 2 servers cover the entire floor which is why we always have slow service. Because Hudson Grille is within walking distance and we are a sales team, we usually look forward to a celebration and to take our meeting to the pub...this usually is not the case as we have tried many times at Hudson Grille only to have poor and slow service. One day we requested last minute quiet space in the backroom at Hudson Grille. The hostess had no clue what we were talking about when we called in and transferred us to a manager who said the room had a minimum price to spend which was fine with us, we would spend it, but he ended up talking us out of the room and told us he would turn the TV near the hostess stand down for us to hold a meeting so he didn't have to have to staff his back room. All the money we were willing to pay went down the drain, instead they catered to us as a regular table of 7 in the bar. This past Friday, a party of 5 of us ordered the lobster dip, red queso, and blue cheese chips as appetizers and our food made it out before our drinks. We were halfway through food and water before our beers even arrived. Our second beers arrived even slower so we ended up not ordering dinner there and decided to go elsewhere. A restaurant down the road on Dresden that usually opens at 5 pm now opens for my team early on some days for us to have a work meeting with appetizers and plenty of alcohol. \\n\\nFor dinner/ cocktails after 6 pm, more servers come on and it can take on a more relaxed, sports bar atmosphere. Servers are more abundant, food comes quicker, drinks come at the same slow pace. Food is great and if the alcohol is coming, the game is on, there is trivia or karaoke, it is much easier to stay longer and keep spending. \\n\\nBottom line, we are always greeted by the same manager and most of us have loyalty cards, which is a plus, I have a $25 credit on my next meal with the points I've accrued; however, I wish the service at Hudson Grille was better. Many times over the 3 years I've been going to this location I've experienced slow service and servers who do not care."},{"name":"Chipotle Mexican Grill","address":"60 Newport Ave","city":"Quincy","stars":"2.5","text":"They give a lot of meat, but the wait is absolutely ridiculous.

The walk home was unbearable. The Chinese food smell is almost intoxicating. I tore open the bag poured duck sauce all over it and shoved the food into my mouth like those ladies on certain websites shove certain appendages into their mouths.

I had about a 15 min lay down session before I looked over at the table and saw the remaining food. I lifted myself up and began to have a second helping. This is where things get bad.

The worst restaurant experience I've ever had anywhere in the world.  Not an exaggeration.  I made the mistake of ordering ribs for lunch.  Yes I know.  Ordering ribs at a non-barbecue place was not smart, but the waiter insisted they were good, and I'm tired of salads for lunch.  I ordered a 1/2 slab of ribs.  The meal came, and it was about a 1/4 slab in reality.  Either every BBQ joint in the country is serving more than a 1/2 slab, or this was just way smaller than it should be.  For $15, you expect a little more.  It was lunch so I was ok with that.  Then as I started eating, I realized there was next to no meat on any of the ribs.  I've never seen so little meat on a rib in my life.  I ate what I had and mentioned to the waiter that this was really a ridiculously small amount of food for a supposed 1/2 slab of ribs.\\n     This is where the real problem began.  He sent the manager over which happened to be the GM.  I figured he was coming over to say he was sorry, and that having so little meat on the ribs was unusual.  Instead he said he checked in the kitchen and that there was nothing wrong with the ribs.  When I mentioned that it was really about quarter of a slab, he said that is what they always do and nobody complains.  He then kept insisting that there was nothing wrong with the ribs and that there was plenty of meat on them.  He said he was going to take them off my bill anyway, but basically said over and over that I was wrong.  I can assure you I've eaten many places around the world, and I know when something isn't right.\\n     All the manager needed to say was that he was sorry, and that usually isn't a problem.  I would have said no problem and gone away happy.  I didn't even care if they were taken off my bill or not.  I just wanted them to know that it was not a properly sized entree.  Instead I was basically berated until my female fried flat out told him to go away.  At no time did the GM say he was sorry with the meal or his behavior.  If this is how Hudson Grille trains their GM's, they will have a big problem going forward.\\n    What happened to the customer is always right?  A simple apology, and I would have gone away happy.  Instead I've told my entire adult sports league about this, posted to yelp, put a comment on Foursquare, and posted to Facebook about this experience.  The overwhelming response was that my big mistake was going to Hudson Grille Brookhaven.  Apparently others have had poor to mediocre food at that location.  I have always had a good experience there personally until today, and a good experience in the midtown location.  I certainly will never go back to the Brookhaven location; especially while that GM is there.  Wow, I'm still annoyed even 4 hours after my visit.

We asked about that and he said \\"well we normally charge for this but I guess I'll take it off.\\" How do you charge for something nobody requested?

I Yelped it on my phone (this is chronic), walked in, and hoped for the best. \\n\\nSelection\\n\\nSelection was minimal within each category. One of the first menus you see as you walk in is for burritos. This does not look like a place where one should order burritos (spent a good stretch of time in Southern California). Subsequent menus that follow as you walk further in are for sandwiches, salads, and wraps at the very end. It seems as if some of these reviews are referring to previous menus when this place had a more varied selection, but I was really stumped. \\n\\nFood\\n\\nNow, generally, one would believe that this level of hunger would trick the palette into believing that everything is just a notch tastier than it would normally be. Nope. Or else this place would merit less than 2 stars. The staff wasn't very helpful and didn't get my order right the first time. The Chicken Caesar wrap (\\"award winning,\\" the menu claimed) was one of the most tasteless wraps I've ever had. I can see how it could \\"burst,\\" but I think that's just because it's very large. You can't quite attack a single layer of it in less than 3 bites, and the greens are so packed that it can't help but sort of fall apart as you figure out how you'll consume the rest of it between bites. The only reason why I kept on eating was because I requested a \\"good amount of chicken,\\" to make sure that they didn't pull a Greenhouse caf√© on me and gyp me out of my meat. And they did give me a fair amount of chicken. But for $7? No. \\n\\nAtmosphere\\n\\nThere are plenty of tables where you can eat, but it's a diner feel, and I'm not in Back Bay to eat in a diner.

After I got it I thought about how a little basil would have made it even more killer.  Also, if you are a big cheese fan like me they had like 7 different cheeses you could put on your pizza.  The cool thing is though, if you are a meat eater like my husband they have like 5 or 6 meats you can put on your pizza too and if you are a vegetarian they have lots of options for that too.  Did I mention they even have a gluten free crust and vegan cheese?  This place has options for just about everyone.   \\nOnce your pizza goes into the oven it just takes 2 or 3 minutes for it to be brought to your table, piping hot and fresh, the absolute best way to have pizza, fresh and hot.  \\nThe prices are super reasonable.  My cheese pizza was $8.  The publish your own is $10.  The portion sizes are great.  I was able to eat 2 slices of my pizza at the restaurant.  I took the other 4 slices home.

It has the Spanish styled steel accents and funky 70's-ish lighting.  Overall the atmosphere was very laid-back and nice.  The bar had a very warm feeling and I could see myself just coming in for drinks.\\n\\nAs we sat down we were quickly brought some chips and salsa.  I have said it before and I will say it again one of the quickest ways to my heart is warm chips, and these were nice and warm.  The salsa was mild but had a nice smokey taste that I swore was chipolte but they told me it was jalapeno.  \\n\\nI ordered one of the specials a braised pork sandwich.  My friend ordered a carnitas plate.  They have Dos Equis on tap so I order one of them my friend a bartender's margarita.  Although I was skeptical based on earlier review of the margarita, but it was pretty good, not great for a place that is called Casa but definitely drinkable.  \\n\\nWhen we received the food I realized the braised pork in my sandwich was the exact same pork that my friend ordered.  I was shocked as I knew I could steal a taste I would have never ordered the same meat.  After eating the sandwich it didn't really matter with a huge portion of fries the meat was tender and the aioli sauce that came with it added a nice punch to the sandwich.

We sit down almost immediately which was nice. We get bread and water right when we sit down from a separate bus boy. The head waiter comes over and introduces himself, then walks away. About 10 minutes later, he comes back with menus and walks away. 10 minutes later he still hasn't come back to take our orders. One of the members of our party had to flag him to take our order. We let him know we are ready and says okay and walks away. 10 minutes later he takes our order. \\n\\nAppetizers  come out very quickly and food does not take long at all. A few side pasta orders got confused but they fixed that very quickly. Food was very good. Probably the best tasting Italian food I have had in Atlanta.\\n\\nWhile eating our food, my wife ordered the Linguini Pescatorre, she found a large piece of metal in her food. The metal looked like a cufflink but looking around at the waiters, none of them wore cufflinks. Luckily my wife found the metal before eating her food, but as you would think, we told the assistant waiter right away. He asked if we wanted something else, but at that point we did not want to eat anything else, so we said no. \\n\\nThis is where the 1 star comes into play. 20 minutes pass and no one said anything to us. The head waiter did not come by, the manager on staff did not come by. The head waiter comes by to clear out plates, and apologizes to another member of the party for forgetting her coffee. (It was ordered with the entrees and it never came. She asked him about it when the entree's arrived, and he said he'll bring it out...which he never did). He said nothing about us finding metal in the food. We then spoke up and asked him if he knew what happened, he seemed confused that it happened, and he said let me go check on it and promptly left. When he came back, he did not apologize but spoke very harshly to my wife saying that it was an accident and accidents happen. Didn't apologize or anything, acted like it was our fault we found a piece of metal in the food. We asked to speak to the manager. They spoke in Italian in front of the table and the manager repeated the same thing the head waiter said. They said the metal came from one of the cooking pots, so probably a metal clasp that holds the handle. Still, the way it was handled was unsatisfactory for me and my wife. \\n\\nThey did not charge us for the dish, but I paid for my food.\\n\\nThey brought free desert tray for our party for free. When he was handing out the plates, he had the audacity to tell my wife that SHE couldn't have any, because she'll probably find something else in the dessert. \\n\\nAs we paid, my other friends gave the waiter 10% tip and I even gave 10% tip, but we found the waiter coming back to the table to dispute with my friends that 10% was not good enough for him. He just kept saying \\"10% tip?\\" and \\"10% tip, you sure\\". My friends gave him a little more, but I have never heard of this happening before anywhere else. He was lucky he got 10%.\\n\\nConclusion: The food was really good. Service was the worst I've ever had. The way the situation was handled about the metal being found in my wife's dish was not acceptable for us. If my wife would have bitten down on the metal, we would have had a serious problem in the restaurant. Luckily that did not happen and sadly, this review would have been better if that did not happen.

The problem is he isn't setup for cooking in a restaurant.  The food will taste amazing, but the dishes will come out one at a time with a long delay between deliveries.  If you are a large party, that is a serious problem, but it is difficult to not like the restaurant.  For starters, the owner is so damn sweet and his intention to serve fresh, high quality food admirable.  I think if you go in groups of two and/or order dishes that everyone at the table can share, then the speed in which the food is prepared won't be as much as a problem.  For larger groups, I think you might want to call your orders in early.  \\n\\nMy advice to the restaurant, pay someone to put your menu up on the web.  Invest in some heaters and hirer someone devoted to helping the chef prepare the food.  I know all that costs money, but you have something with the food.  You can see it in the fact that your rating is so high and yet your service (in terms of speed) is atrocious.  Also, adding bread to the service would cut down on the sting of the wait.  The popcorn kernels aren't really doing it.\\n\\nWhat to order:\\n1.  To die for fried rice\\n2.

Perhaps I haven't had much elevated Indian food in the past, but I typically associate the cuisine with being very heavy with its curries with cream bases and many blends of spices. But all the dishes here were very delicately balanced and there wasn't an overwhelming sense of heaviness with the dishes. We braced ourselves for a wait, since we've seen the lineups on Cambie, but I guess we arrived a bit later, around 7:30 and so we were seated right away.\\n\\n--- Appetizers ---\\n- Complimentary snacks to start: the potato pakoras (I think they were called pakoras?) \\n- Chai tea: also complimentary. Quite aromatic! \\n- Eggplant appetizer: crispy fried onions were really good. Eggplant was lightly battered.\\n- Samosas: filled with beef and lamb. The kind of \\"sauce\\" base had a mix of onions and some other vegetables, along with a white coconut mixture. \\n\\n--- Entrees ---\\nI guess each of the entrees came with some basmati and naan to share! You might think, how amazing can rice and bread be? Yes, I am a carbovore, but don't get me wrong, the basmati and naan were amazing. The basmati was cooked to perfection, and the naan was fluffy and lighted seasoned with some herbs.\\n\\n- Lamb lollipops: wow!! No wonder people rave about this. The lamb chops were melt-in-your-mouth tender, \\n- Pork tenderloin: wow, the charred and smoky aroma was totally present in smell and taste. The meat was also very tender. \\n- Beef short rib: the meat was so soft; however, if I had to say anything about the meat this meal, it would be that the most of the flavour lay in the sauce and on the outside of the beef. \\n- Mushrooms and beans: this one was a bit spicier than the rest, but wow, the aroma was quite unique, and you can tell there's a wicked blend of spices used in here. It was definitely a different sauce base than the other meat dishes, though the colour resembled the beef short rib. I'm not so much of a veggie person, so I didn't like this as much as the meat dishes.\\n\\nIn order of my favourite to least for meat entrees: lamb lollipops, pork tenderloin, beef short rib. We ordered a small plate (i.e. half order) for each of the entrees. I like how they give this option because it's great for trying lots of things!

MMmmmmm..\\n\\nAs someone who's been infatuated with Oysters this year and have tried about 5 places in Vancouver, I can tell you their oysters are delish and are paired well with a variety of sauces.  My favourite is the orange one which I believe is a jalape√±o sauce that is actually legit spicy.\\n\\nOne of the unique things about this joint, and why my girl friends insist on going is that it is all male waiter staff, or at least from what I've seen.  I've also been told they are generally very attractive.

Great amounts of tuna on top and inside the roll also.\\nHis korean dish was actually really flavorful and a great size. It came with brown rice and saut√©ed vegetables. As a Korean, I definitely approved of his choice.\\nThe Thai spring roll appetizer was complete shit. It came in two, but Thai spring rolls usually means fresh vegetables in a freshly fried roll or even rice paper roll.

It was disgusting.\\n\\nBesides that, everyone was very friendly from our server, hostess, and manager.

There were many servers wheeling about, lots of attention, nice to get little snacks brought right away after a very hot wait in the sun.\\n\\nBut all our dishes arrived at the same time. The table was packed, and obviously some dishes were lost and grew cold in the shuffle. The food and atmosphere ought to have time to be enjoyed. In the end, we got the cheque while we were in the middle of eating our desert. In short, we felt like they wanted to rush the table for the next seating, from start to finish. Very poor show.\\n\\nWhen the server cleared the table, she apologized sheepishly when she dropped a lamb chop on my wife's shoulder, but no offer to have her shirt cleaned. \\n\\nAll dishes were nicely presented and well seasoned, but nothing really mind-blowing. \\n\\nThe lamb popsicles get a lot of hype. They're expertly cooked, and the turmeric sauce is pretty, tasty, and a nice contrast to the smoky sweet surface of the meat. But they're rack chops, so of course they're tender. The sauce is very nice, but as a much-lauded favourite in a 'destination restaurant,' the dish isn't amazing. Very good, but should be amazing. \\n\\nTenderloin was also well grilled, but the sweet-ish tomato sauce was underwhelming.

We specifically asked for the wings to come out first. The pizza comes out an hour later and then 20 minutes later the wings come out. We told them at that point we did not want them. The food was good but we were not warned that the kitchen was backed up and that the food would take that long to come out. Manager came over and said that he had some re-training to do with the staff. He gave us 75% off our food which was nice but then we asked for the check and then waited another 20 minutes and the server still did not come take it. We had to walk up and get her to run it.

The manager (she was really nice) made up for the dry cupcakes by offering a store credit so I will definitely take her up on her offer and try the cupcakes again.  She had informed me that by me putting the cupcakes in the refrigerator dried them out (really?).  But I think maybe the smaller cupcakes are drier than the regular sized cupcakes and the cakes whether they are refrigerated or not (my personal thought).  Also, the customer service was wonderful when I picked up the cupcakes, they offered to help me get the cupcakes in the car.

We have had Several Complaints about this Restaurant, have voiced our complaints to the Manager, but Nothing Ever Changes. I attempted to phone the Corporate office in Texas today regarding this matter. I spoke to a representative in the Complaint Department who acted as if I was interrupting her day. I asked to speak to a Manager or Supervisor in her Department. She said she can take my complaint, and see if one could contact me. I wasn't going to waste my time with someone who didn't seem as if she cared about my complaint at all. I Tried to handle this on the Corporate Level with the Company Directly, had 0 Success, which is Why I'm here.\\nI should first of all make mention, I have been in the Restaurant Business All of my life, as a Worker, Manager and Owner of Successful restaurants. I know about matters that I am discussing. The Restaurant is Horribly Understaffed for the size of the operation. There's a help wanted sign on the left side of the counter when you walk in. We were greeted and seated in a booth. The wall was filthy with the look of a milk shake that had been sprayed in the air and landed there. Our waitress came over, after some time, apologized about our wait and took our order. I ordered a Chili Cheese Dog, Salt and Vinegar Fries and a Sweet Tea. Greg ordered a Patty Melt, Parmesan Fries and a Water. He Also ordered a Vanilla Shake. We waited an Inordinate amount of time for our drinks. Waitress still didn't bring Greg's shake, so he reminded her~she said it was coming. Our waitress was friendly and personable. That's where the ONE STAR comes from.\\nShe brought out our food. One bite of a COLD hot dog, was all it took for me. I called her attention to it, she took it back and apologized. She brought me a plate of fries out to start with while waiting for my hot dog. It comes out a Second time, Wrong. A tiny amount of Chili in the center, none on the rest of the bun...nothing about it was Correct in keeping with the way it's Supposed to be made. The manager was Bussing Tables. Great if you need to jump in and help...but...You're there to Effectively Manage the Operation. You can't do this if you're Not Paying Attention to What's going on around you. In addition, why weren't More Employees on the schedule? This manager, though friendly, is Not Management material. Every time you go into the place, there's Something Wrong. They are Out of Product, the Service is Lacking or Terrible, the Food is Cold, the Health Dept. needs to Step in with their Thermometers as the food Is Not being kept at Proper Temperature. It was served Cold to me Twice. This is Totally Unacceptable. Hot Food Needs to be Hot, Cold food Cold. Anything Other, You are Posing a Health Risk! I'm Not Interested in Excuses, Rather Results. I could Personally run circles around Any Manager in that place. I can and have identified the Weaknesses and the Solutions to the Various Problems that exist. When you visit a Franchise, you Should be able to Expect Consistency in the Operation from one to another location. I have visited a Well Run Steak and Shake in Palm Coast, Florida and a Poorly One Run here. Night and Day. If the Corporate Office and/or Manager of this location would like to contact me, Please feel free.\\nWe are Not the Only patrons who are complaining about this location, as we have heard others.

A homey cup of Italian wedding soup was followed by a house salad that had old school Italian dressing that was garlicky and had great vinegar tang.  \\nCarbs be damned...I went for the \\"Pasta Antonio Golden pan fried pork tenderloin and capicolla ham baked in a casserole of homemade spaghetti, our marinara sauce and provolone cheese\\"  Holy crap this was this amazing!  This dish just shot up to my top 3 of guilty pleasures in the city of Cbus.  I haven't had homemade spaghetti in a very long time..I forgot what I was missing.  My dad got the \\"Spaghetti Ala Caruso Homemade spaghetti, mushrooms and chicken livers baked in our marinara sauce and topped with shredded parmesan cheese.\\"  It looked amazing with all the gooey cheese on it.  I stole his leftovers and had it for breakfast...yup...freeking awesome!!!  We both had a glass of the house chianti and it was very drinkable with the homey Italian meal.  \\nI am so glad I finally can cross off the Florentine from my Columbus restaurant bucket list but I will be back without a doubt.

Let me start by saying we were previously devoted fans of Tien Hong's dim sum, since it seems to me that will tell a lot of you if you like the same Chinese food I do.  There are other places in Austin that supposedly have pretty good dim sum, but we don't get to try them because they largely ignore vegetarians.  This is owned by the family that owns Satay.  You fill out a paper ticket and turn it in at the cash register, and they bring the food out.  Although it is not up to the standards of NYC and Los Angeles, I would definitely recommend it.  The wrappers on the dumplings are a bit thicker than I prefer, which does alter the texture a bit, but overall I still enjoyed the meal quite a bit.  We have been several times in the last few weeks and keep coming back.  Particularly good tonight were the veggie pot stickers, veggie cheung fun and sesame balls with red bean paste.  We also really like the taro root with mushroom filling, pickled veggies, and eggplant with shrimp filling.  Skip on the veggie egg roll; it is fine but nothing special.  Their chili oil is the best I've had since Tien Hong closed, not too spicy and with plenty of fermented black beans.  Another good dish was the salt and pepper tofu with seaweed - a piece of tofu wrapped with a band of seaweed, battered and deep friend and topped with a stir-fry of jalapeno and scallions.  My 17 month old boy was literally stuffing his face with the sticky rice and veggies steamed in lotus leaf and the coconut bun. There are combo plates for $7.50, although if you are a big eater you can definitely spend more."},{"name":"Dinesty Dumpling House","address":"1719 Robson Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Not super special but if you're looking for dim sum downtown this seems to be the place.

The food was great and the service was wonderful.  The price tag was also a bit bigger then I'm used to in Portland, but for the quality, everything was well worth it and I can't wait to go back.\\n\\nAt Castagna you can choose to order of the menu or do the Chef's 10 Course Tasting menu, but everyone in your party has to choose the Tasting Menu then.  We ended up choosing the tasting menu so that we could try a bit of everything.\\n\\nI enjoyed all of our courses but for me a few standouts were the Smoked Steelhead with Chestnut and Sweet Lime, the Winter Squash Hot and Cold, the Pork entree and the Apple dessert.  The Smoked Steelhead came with three large pieces of fish atop a chestnut puree.  The fish was smokey and delicious and practically melted in your mouth.  I adore squash and eat it very often, usually roasted, however this \\"hot and cold\\" squash was prepared entirely differently then I've ever seen.  The \\"cold\\" portion was a squash ice cream and the hot portion was a warm squash soup that was poured around the ice cream once it was served.  The dish also contained tasty pieces of squash meat and was topped with some salty fish roe that popped in your mouth.\\n\\nThe pork entree might have been one of my favorites just because it came with the one glass of red wine in the entire wine pairing.  The dish consisted of a small square of tender glazed pork served with hazelnut butter, turnips and pear.  The salty sweet combo, especially with pork, is always a winner for me.  \\n\\nWith the Chef's tasting menu you also get two desserts which was heaven for me.  The dessert I loved the most was the first dessert which was a fruity \\"Apple Potpourri with Rose Geranium\\".  The dessert was an apple ice cream topped with a candied \\"potpourri\\" of rose petals and cinnamon sticks.  It was beautiful to look at, not too sweet and a very refreshing almost end to the meal.\\n\\nI also opted for the wine pairing which was nice, but I would have liked more red wines as there was only one on the entire menu.  I would also note that you do get a significant pour with each wine.  Usually I'm  fine with this but with 10 courses it was hard to keep up.  \\n\\nThis place isn't cheap but the food is wonderful and prepared artfully with care and precision.  Castagna isn't someplace I would go on a regular basis, but their menu does change seasonally and I'm already looking forward to our next big special dinner here."},{"name":"Casa Garcia's","address":"1000 S Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"Went there for breakfast and got the breakfast tacos.

I had beets for the appy and the sturgeon for my entree. We also had the wine pairings along with it. They served several \\"snacks' as well, which for the most part seemed very overwrought. I'm not sure why two teensy \\"crackers\\" which looked like a half potato chip and tasted like less greasy cheezits really need to be brought out on a platter which was a box with a glass top with what looked like wood chips inside. Give me a break. Impress me with your food, not your ridiculous presentations. The butter that came with the bread wasn't butter, it was lard I believe, which I don't have a problem with per se but it  sort of tasted like a slim jim. It had the odor of liquid smoke. \\n\\nThe wine was very good, and the service was excellent. The beets were delicious, the sturgeon was good.

Maybe I should have ordered rolls with more of a bang, but I was unimpressed with both rolls. The salmon mango roll was bland, not sure if that is a sign of the quality of the fish or not.

When I discovered the Tin Shed, however, it was over. The deal was sealed. I was ready to commit. Portland and I have been inseparable ever since. \\n\\nTo adjust my metaphor a bit, you know you really love someone when you find you have utmost patience for the habits they have that drive you crazy. Someone who takes 45 minutes to get ready to go anywhere, and doesn't really float your boat otherwise, gets the boot, right? But you'll wait forever for The Right Person to get their hair done just right, right? I feel that way about the Tin Shed. Sure, it takes forever to get a table on weekend mornings, but I never seem to mind. It helps that there's coffee. It helps that I always take good company to the Tin Shed. It helps that there's space on the benches to wait. And it really helps that I always seem to make friends with the people waiting beside me. Or, when I sit at the bar or the long shared table, with my fellow diners. The friendliness is furthered by the always-smiling, always-funny staff, who are happy to recommend tasty hair of the dog drinks (the spicy Bloody Mary in particular) to hungover diners.\\n\\nWhile the Tin Shed is now semi-famous for being the best brunch in the city, it's also worth knowing that they're open nights now, and they serve other meals. The regular dinner menu is a little more expensive than the brunch menu, it seems, but the emphasis on chic-but-sleek foods is still there. And they have a small selection of funky desserts (carrot cake, warm cookies and ice cream). Even more worth knowing is that happy hour at the Tin Shed is ALL DAY Sunday, and it is dirt cheap. The Shed typically only has two beers on tap (one micro, one bottom-shelf macro). Well drinks are $3 a pop. Entrees are $3 a pop (I'm partial to the jalapeno mac). The Tin Shed is quieter at night, and the exuberant family atmosphere of the daytime experience gives way to candelit intimacy.

The NOISE last night ranks up there with any sports-bar during a game. It was simply impossible to talk (and any intimate meal was not going to happen). Like a lot of spoiled restaurants, when it comes to noise, this was all due to groups of businessmen.

We had quite a bit of china on the table and it made me nervous.  I wasn't sure what to expect as far as the menu but was pleasantly surprised at the adult offerings.  I was disappointed at the options for children that are slightly older than the age cut off but not old enough to eat a full adult meal.  I don't necessarily want my children eating filet mignon or swordfish for dinner if that's not something they're used to eating.  I digress... I ordered the 6 ounce filet and it melted in my mouth.  Absolutely delicious.  I did not order the mac and cheese but I was pleasantly surprised with the texture and taste.  One of our guests ordered the swordfish and found it to be exceptionally fresh.\\n\\nOverall I found it to be one of the better restaurants we'd been to and the service was exceptional.  The reason this restaurant received 5 stars is because of our server.  His name escapes me but he educated us on the various food choices, he gave stories about the chef and his skill set as well as the availability of the food and the best time to order it.  He was prompt, kept our drinks refilled, he was attentive, and offered services before we even knew we needed it.

It had been my task this week, whilst attending a conference, to ensure all were heartily fed and happy at the end of an evening, and we were all just that! Our waiter Alex was our guide of their rather minimal but wonderful menu.

There are so many varieties of marinated meats you can choose from, veggies, noodles, and sauces. The choices range from Asian, Asian-fusion, and even a few Italian-style options (like meatballs). You choose all of these from two salad bar-like islands and then join the line at the massive grill. It's fun watching the cooks preparing and cooking all of your food on the hot grill. When they take your bowl, you tell them if you have any allergies or dietary issues, which I appreciated. I'm allergic to fish and also have a moderate reaction to shellfish and shrimp. To be on the safe side, the cook brought my bowl to the interior kitchen to be cooked to avoid allergen contamination. I really appreciated the extra precaution beyond just cleaning off the grill stone! They also list on their website what allergens are/aren't in their various sauces and marinades. Can't tell you how much I appreciated that, as I always have to view Asian menus in advance due to the allergen issue. \\n\\nBesides the bowls, you also get a large plate of rice or fried rice included with the meal.

I tried the extra-large steak burrito, and my wife had tacos (shrimp and chicken) and a chicken tamale (Fridays only until they sell out). Everything was delicious.

My level of Cantonese borders between a 10-year-old child's proficiency to adult conversational. During my childhood, I learned to memorize the things I love in Chinese cuisine so that I could one day order the dim sums I wanted and the staple Canton dishes - thankfully Empire Chicken was one of the dishes. \\n\\nWhen I went in, I quickly ordered the chicken in Cantonese and was told to wait about 15 minutes for the order. The restaurant does accept Visa or Mastercard but the restaurant is a small family-run establishment and to support small businesses, I always try to pay in cash. The restaurant is very bare bones but the place is always filled with a family or two. Although there is a menu in English, the best menu is on the wall. The wall menu is written in Chinese characters and according to my dad, they offer some really off-the-wall dishes including duck tongue, pig ears, etc. I can't read Chinese so unfortunately I wouldn't be able to see how impressive their secret local menu is. After I waited for about 15 minutes, a lady gave me the Chicken and I was on my way. \\n\\nI love Empire Chicken - the white meat is super soft and the ginger & scallion sauce that comes with the chicken is absolutely delicious. My dad has prepared fresh Empire Chicken for us (literally, I saw the butcher kill the chicken and in about 4 hours, the chicken is on the table ready to be devoured). There is a unique taste to fresh chicken and if I remember correctly, the Empire Chicken from Wing's Kitchen didn't seem as if it had been literally killed hours before but it also didn't seem as if the chicken had been sitting around in a freezer for two weeks. \\n\\nA few weeks ago my parents came here for a Mother's Day lunch, they choose some hearty vegetarian dishes for my brother and a simple Shrimp and Chinese broccoli dish for the meateaters. All of the dishes were cooked in a homestyle manner and I liked the quiet and mellow atmosphere that the restaurant offered in comparison to those noisy dim sum places on the weekend. I noticed in the corner, two guys had an opened bottle of wine so I'm not sure if they were restaurant workers taking it easy or if the place is a BYOB.

And it must reside inside of Yami Yami!\\n\\nWhen I first started working the Peachtree Center area, I tried Yami Yami for some sushi and was not impressed. Co-workers were not impressed either, and many have since sworn off Yami Yami all together. \\n\\nHowever, in my quest to find anything quick, cheap, and tasty to purchase for lunch in the Peachtree Center area, I came to a halt after passing by Yami Yami's non-sushi options.  Their food actually looked... good. It looked... fresh!\\n\\n$5.99 will get you two items and rice. I chose the sesame chicken with a spring roll and steamed rice. I also couldn't pass up the green iced tea I saw that the register clerk had! I found all the food to be really good. The chicken actually kept it's crunchiness with the sauce that was on it. I'm not sure it was exactly sesame chicken though- but it was the standard chicken-in-sauce dish you'd expect from any asian food court place.\\n\\nThe iced green tea was a standout performer for me, especially because she will sweeten it for you to your preference. I actually didn't get a chance to bite into my spring roll because I was so full from everything else!\\n\\nThey also have a good sushi deal. It's almost like a sushi buffet, where you can pick and choose what kinds of pieces you want. You can mix and match too, I believe up to 8 pieces for the deal. I can't remember what the deal exactly is, but friends say that the sushi quality has vastly improved since last year.\\n\\nAlso, all the workers here are FRIENDLY and speak English really well....which says a lot, considering people who work in Peachtree Center who speak English as their first language can barely get it right, let alone be polite.

The patio was busy so there was a wait but that's not the Tin Shed's fault. Infact, kudos on having great business during downtime in the slow season.  We were sat inside promptly and greeted by Sarah.  She gave us a run down of the specials with great presentation.  I thought, wow what an amazing place we have found.   When Sarah came back we ordered pbj and Mac and cheese for the kids but we needed more time.  After that, Sarah seemed to give up on guest service.  After waiting ten minutes to order our food, I went to the bathroom and when I returned I discovered that my mom had ordered for us finally.  Finally after 29 minutes the kids food came out.  I had no idea that it took that long to nuke Mac and cheese and whip a pbj.    Yes, I timed it! I'm a server and I always keep An eye on the time especially when out to eat.  I  would have understood if it wasn't 1:25 and starting to clear out.  Two tables around us got their meals way before us and they ordered 15 minutes after us ordering.  I couldn't see any sense of urgency from our server whatsoever.  We were at a 38 minute ticket time and I look behind me to see her flirting and whispering into a guests ear at the bar.  Turns out that the Portland hiptsers and employees are the only ones getting attention around this place.  She should have been at the kitchen window getting our order squared away at the 20 minute mark.  Instead another server finally brought the order at 44 minutes.  Are you f#@king kidding me?  Not once did she apologize or do anything to save us or insure that we would be repeat guests.  That's the point where I go to the ends of the earth to make sure the guest leaves happy and understanding of the situation.  Unfortunately,  her only check back was, \\"everything good guys?\\"  Absolutely not!!!  How about, \\"hey everyone I'm so sorry for the delay, the kitchen was running behind or, I forgot to ring in your food because I was busy trying to get laid.\\"  I would never insult my guests in my restaurant and expect them to pretend that they didn't wait 44 minutes for food.    I would have understood if we were rude but we are the most humble folks especially since we are in the industry.   That being said, you are very lucky that you got 5 on 41.  I am not the type to stiff my server and I think that it is rude.  I think that you deserved 10% but I still couldn't lower myself to do that to you.  This is a moment for you to really give yourself a gut check.  Are you really in the right industry?  Maybe just having an off day.

After waiting 10 minutes I was about to be on my way when I asked for another white sauce. That wasn't going to happen -advised the girl that sits in the corner on her laptop to the cashier. I left, annoyed that my order was wrong and annoyed the white sauce is on lock down. I get that you may have to restrict it, ok. But maybe since I was already having a small issue, you would toss in 1 extra sauce? Needless to say this day left a bad taste in my mouth and I did not return. \\n\\nUntil this evening. \\nI called and placed a to go order for a shrimp teriyaki ($7/8) and a side of the small order of veggies ($1.99). I substituted noodles for rice also.

I am the only customer there and my order is already ready! :) (they are quick!) \\nMy order is somewhat wrong. I only see one container and ask where the veggies are. The veggies are not separated but mixed with the other meal. Ok- no problem, I can separate it. One of the cooks (who took my\\nOrder) advises me to tell them next time to separate it. (Really?) Since it's really 2 meals I ask, can I have 2 extra white sauce for this because it's for someone else as well.

When we arrived the place was packed.It was around 8:30. Understandable it was on a Friday night. We were told the wait for a bowling lane was a hour and a half. No biggie we thought we can grab some food and drinks until it's ready. Well that's when the craziness began. We went over to the restaurant area, we were seated within a few minutes. Our server comes over and gets our drink orders. She comes back ten minutes later with two pitchers of water and no cups. She says casually that our drink orders should be ready shortly. She leaves and then shows up about five minutes later with cups for the water. She still doesn't have the drinks that we ordered. We go ahead and place our food order. She leaves and brings us our drinks. Two of my friends sip there and say they don't taste an alcohol. The waitress offers to take the drinks back. We ask instead can we just order shots? That way we can just add to the drinks. She says okay and leaves. She comes back pretty quickly this time and says the bartender says no. Um? What? She says instead he has offered to make us new drinks. Um.. okay. She takes the drinks and leaves. When she comes back with the \\"newly\\" made drink they look exactly the same. Still watered down. Wouldn't the bartender attempt to at least fake it by adding more ice? At this point we don't care. Starting to get hungry so we inquire about the food. At this point it has been an hour. She leaves and never comes back.. Instead about fifteen minutes later a new server arrives. He introduces himself and says our food should be out soon. We assume that it's a shift change as no explanation is given as to where the first server went to. Finally our food arrives. I look up and notice our first server at another table. Weird.. Of course the food is cold and one of the orders is wrong. We begin to tell him about the incorrect orders. His response is to mutter under his breath and roll his eyes. \\n\\nNow the buzzer is going off for us to get our bowling lane. One of my friends goes to check on our lane. She is told that we can bring our food and drinks over to the our bowling lane. She relays this to our server who seems to have a problem with this. We tell him which lane we are going to and grab our stuff and head over there. More eye rolling from him. Everything was going fine with the bowling until the 7th frame. The game turns off. We are told although we purchased unlimited bowling after an hour you have to come back to the desk to start another hour. They give us another ten minutes to finish as a courtesy. We try to finish within the ten minutes and we also try to cash out our food and drink bill. Which turns out to be way more complicated than it should be. Some of us end up getting a discount since our food order was wrong. It's now around eleven so we decide lets do laser tag since it's already paid for and get out of here. We get in line and when it's our turn to approach the entry we are asked for a board pass. We flash our unlimited bracelet thingy. He says no and points to where we have to sign up. We hurry to sign up. The guy says we have to wait for the next session, which would be at midnight. That's odd since only four people went in and up to twenty can go in. We have had enough at this point. We go back to the cashier and ask her to refund the laser tag. She calls over the manager. We explain why we want a refund for laser tag. We show our receipts. He takes them and goes to his boss to discuss.. He comes back and says he can't refund the laser tag. We demand that his boss come over. He states he is not allowed to do refunds and how does he know that we didn't already participate in laser tag.

So, I was very excited when I heard that they were opening back up.  Tommy Carroll has always been a talented chef but was limited by the constraints of the old 'Family Style\\" restaurant.  I appears that he finally has a chance to kick it up a notch with this new venue. Service was great although some earlier reviews complained about it but with any new restaurant you have to work out the bugs. The wait staff was young and hip looking which I liked.  I went with a party of 8 so I did get to see a few different menu items.  Bread was served warm and was delicious.  I wasn't very hungry and am on a bit of a diet so i ordered the chopped salad with grilled shrimp, bacon, eggs red onion, etc.  The lettece was chopped so it was very easy to eat..  The house dressing was excellent and it came back into my memory that Tommy's house dressing back in the old days was excellent as well.  This was very similar and sort of blue cheesed based.  The shrimp were big, fresh and nicely grilled and the portion size was on the larger side.  Two other women with us ordered it as well and couldn't finish theirs. Others in our party order lobster pie which looked delicious and another person ortdered twin lobsters which filled up a rather large plate.  Everyone appeared very satisfied and the drinks were very good as well.  Sure it's not cheap but neither is food at the supermarket so don't expect steak and lobster dinners for $12.95. Go to some greasy spoon for that.

Never had Venezuelan food before and I was pleasantly surprised.  I ordered the Arepa which is like a sandwich made of cornmeal flatbread, with yummy things stuffed inside.  There were no chips and salsa for the table, so don't expect that.  And the sandwich was on the small side.  Nothing came with beans/rice either, so your entree is what you get.

The wait staff ranges from indifferent to intimidating, and as I have a tendency to go out of my way to win over wait staff, I often times end up feeling awkward. But that's just me.

Seating was scarce because many students were there studying for an elongated time. \\n\\nAlthough I was loving all of the vegetarian options, I was so happy I went with The Pallet, which is turkey, goat cheese and fig spread on multigrain bread. It was so simple and delicious, and I'm excited to recreate it at home. My boyfriend got the 777, which was roast beef, olive Mayo, onions and greens. He asked for it toasted, but it came out cold and hard. Definitely not something he would order again...

I've only dined in once many years ago and never tried items other than the pizza and stuffed rolls so can't really comment on the service or rest of the menu items.\\n\\nI've tried many other pizza places over the years and this is still the best pizza around here, hands down. They seem to do mainly take out and are geared primarily to that type of service, even though they do have a small area for seating, unlike some of the other pizza/Italian restaurants catering to dine-in. So I'm assuming that could be why some people rate it lower than 4 when having a meal in, because the pizza itself is great, cheesy and full of flavor. My favorite is the Margherita (think that's spelled right?) very garlicky and cheesy. The tomatoes on this pie are bursting with flavor so I think they must be marinated in advance.

Then when it was time to pay it all came as one check although we were mostly all paying separately. Not a big deal we just did the math ourselves. A friend of mine did the calculations to make sure everything was covered but apparently didn't do a great job with the math. It turned out we had left a 15% tip which was not our intention and she came over and brought it to our attention (also fine just to make sure that was our intention) then to remedy the situation we gave her $10 which brought it up to ~19% which I was comfortable with.

I always ask for a creamy, succulent and slightly acid \\"guanabana en leche\\" (soursop milkshake). Then I order my appetizer right away: Tostones en Hogao. Tostones are flat mashed plantains fried to a crispy point. The Hogao sauce is similar to a Mexican salsa.

One of the things I like about this restaurant is that is family oriented, even though you'll always find that group of gallant, suave Colombian peeps eyeballing the pretty ladies around, some lovey-dovey couples, and people dining by themselves.\\n\\nThere are plenty of entrees to choose from three categories: meats (carnes), seafood (comida del mar) and the ones I have never had, pastas (I heard they're OK, and perfect for kids). ALERT, ALERT! If you're the kind that loves eating light and fat-free, this is not your place. These plates are hefty and deliciously rich, and served with insane amounts of sides. My all-time favorite at La Casona is the famous, celebrated all-Colombian tasting-plate Bandeja Paisa (mini or regular, which for this plate translates to huge and enormous). This dish includes rice, red beans, chicharron (fried pork-meat strips with crunchy skin), a medium, thin piece of juicy beef, one sunny-side up egg, arepa, avocado, and plantains...delicioso! My second favorite is their wonderful \\"Arroz con Pollo\\" (rice and chicken). When I order it for lunch, I close my eyes while I'm eating and I feel like I'm sitting at my parents' dining room in Caracas on a Sunday afternoon. *Tear*\\n\\nWeekend and daily specials are worth a try. I'm not crazy about the \\"Lengua a la Criolla o a la Plancha\\" (creole or grilled tongue) because I've never been fond of this meat's texture. I've tried the \\"Higado Encebollado\\" (liver with Colombian-style onions) and it's fantastic and masterly-well cooked. Stews and soups are excellent. I have a friend that kills for the \\"Mondongo\\" (tripe soup). I've had the marvelous \\"Ajiaco Santafereo\\", a magical mixture of tender chicken, and different kinds of Colombian potatoes and peas. It's a monumental soup that should be eaten with calmness, breathing after each spoonful of wonder, as a ritual. They also offer hen soup, richly combined with several veggies. These two are the ULTIMATE remedy for a hangover. If you have a Colombian-Caribbean soup, you don't need electrolytes to come to life again!\\n\\nStrangely enough, I have never had dessert here. I usually devour the small side of \\"Arroz con Leche\\" they bring you with your silverware and my sweet tooth feels satisfied. Sometimes I crave a little pus cafe, that sinful Devil Water...if you're over 21 and not driving, you might want to ask your nice waitress for a shot of  \\"Aguardiente\\".\\n\\nAfter all this fiesta culinaria, make sure you can go back home and rest. You'll be dreaming about this meal. I do. I close my eyes with my tummy full of happiness and my heart filled with love for all what ties me to my cherished culture."},{"name":"Chewies Steam & Oyster Bar - Kits","address":"2201 W 1st Avenue","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Came here while in beautiful Vancouver for a few days.

The staff was really friendly and our waitress was super nice and she did a good job of checking on us even though she was busy. Big bar with lots of flat screens, and they said they had live music on the weekends. The reason we ended up going to smokey bones and trying it, is because it was a) the only place open at midnight (they close at 1am) and b) I had a $25 gift, so why not.\\n\\nI would have given this place 5 stars but we had issues with two items we ordered, first being the fries on the crowd pleaser appetizer, they were hard as a rock, and tasted nasty, everything else on the app was delicious. I kindly asked the waitress if she could bring us something else instead of fries, and she said sure and we went with the onion rings and then we ordered the shrimp dunkers. Before we knew it she had emerged with the rest of the food and we were looking forward to it. But unfortunately the shrimp appetizer was seriously salty and fishy just a little bit. Not sure where they get their shrimp or the recipe they use to batter them, but its just a horrible dish, would never order that here again.\\n\\nOverall it was so so, Like I said I would have given them 5 but there were issues, and the only reason I kept it at 4 is because these people obviously have customer service experience. They were courteous, friendly, suggestive, and also listened when I had a complaint and they took steps to rectify it so my experience would not be a negative one. They did remove the shrimp from the receipt as well.\\n\\nAnd just as we were waiting to pay our bill, the table behind us got seated, and they tried to order but the waitress explained they had just switched to a late night menu, and they made an ordeal out of it by saying they drove a long way to eat there and all they could get was burgers at that point, so the waitress called over the manager and he thoroughly apologized and tried to oblige their requests even though some of the items were not available, they decided to stay and he also bought them a round of drinks. So the customer service here is top notch in my opinion. Hopefully someday I can come back and try some of their other dishes such as smoked wings, and or the double trouble,"},{"name":"Karl's Sausage Kitchen & European Market","address":"1 Bourbon St","city":"Peabody","stars":"4.5","text":"I have been coming to Karls Sausage Kitchen since before it moved from Route 1.

It was awesome to see. \\n\\nAnyway, let me finish my review... because there's more. Towards the end of the evening, after our check was dropped the strangest thing started to happen.

I started to look under, inspect what's going on... nothing. Then it does it again. I'm tripping out at this time. \\"What the hell is that!\\"  Just as I'm flipping out the waitress comes to the table to pick up the check. I tell her what's going on with a serious concerned look.

I love how the sauces don't compete or contrast each other, but rather, complement each other as if they were long time friends hugging together in my mouth. (Yes, I'm talking to you garlic and pineapple sauce!) \\n\\nAnd the layers of texture the bun, meat and potato chips give your mouth as you bit into it....imagine soft, chewy, crunchy and zingy. (Wait, is zingy a texture or flavor....I think I'd like to see a debate on that) :)\\n\\nAnd when it comes to messy, I don't mind! I put my manners and integrity aside every time I eat a burger from here. In fact, I think I've come up with a strategy on eating this thing without the wrapper! All because, well, quite frankly, I've never enjoyed rotating my motions between biting and adjusting my wrapper. I kinda like just diving into my burger. This is probably one of those times where you'll see me quietly devouring my food in the corner of the restaurant or by myself in my office to save myself from any sort of embarrassment. :P\\n\\nAnd if you're interested in trying anything else out at Junior's, the empanadas are good, not the greatest, but good and their grilled chicken is exactly as described - grilled chicken. No fancy marinades, no fancy spices, just good 'ol fashioned grilled chicken. \\n\\n*Tip: If you have a large order, do not order take out. They've missed out on putting all of my food in my order. Instead, just bring the crew here for an early lunch to beat the lunch crowd to ensure nothing is missed. \\n\\nI struggled between a 3 and four star but overall with the combination of all of the food on their menu and the service, it's only appropriate to go wtih 3. \\n\\nStick to the burgers for a solid experience and you'll be set. :)\\n\\n\\nCheers!"},{"name":"Bartaco Boulder","address":"1048 Pearl St","city":"Boulder","stars":"4","text":"Great tacos and chopped salad lunch tray.

The woman who we always have to deal with at the front desk is as rude as can be.  As is usual here, we were told our wait would be 40 minutes at about 8:45pm, despite there being a slew of empty lanes.  So we decide to get a drink at the bar, which was an awkward experience in its own right (to be explained below).  40 minute turned out to be more like an hour.  At about 9:50, I go up to the sassy front desk lady and say we'll just wait until after 10 to bowl since rates drop then and it's only 5 minutes away.  About 3 minutes later, she calls us over and says our lane is ready.  Thinking she's just going to give us the lower rate considering it's only 2 minutes before 10, and we just talked about it, we go over. She proceeds to charge us the pre-10pm rate.  I had to remind her of the conversation we had just a couple minutes earlier to which she rudely said we would have to wait until 10.  About 5 minutes later, she calls over again and looks annoyed that her plot's been foiled.  That was just the latest in a string of dealing with her rudeness whenever coming here.\\n\\nNow to the bar!  As previously mentioned, to wait out the ridiculous wait time despite multiple lanes being open, we went to the bar where both bartender look pissed at each other like they've just been fighting.  I ask one of the rays of sunshine if there are any drink specials tonight, to which he tersely and weirdly responds, \\"no, it's illegal to offer specials.\\"  Despite the fact that almost every restaurant/bar in Decatur and Metro Atlanta has drink specials at some time during the week, this is especially strange considering I was just there on New Year's Eve when they offered a list of specials.  I mention this to the bartender, and he coyly responds \\"no we didn't.\\" Ok. . . I guess I'll just have a beer then.  We asked about food too, but the other slightly less pissed-off looking bartender said something to the effect of \\"we're fighting with the kitchen right now, so I don't know if you can order anything.\\"  Well crap, we had to miss out on their nasty looking bowling food.  \\n\\nThe only positive I can say about this place is their bowling lanes are actually pretty nice.  I've heard a lot of horror stories about broken lanes and the less-then-worried response from the staff, but we've never had a problem with our lanes.  \\n\\nIt's a real shame the staff here is so terrible, because a well-run bowling alley like this with friendly workers who give a damn would be fully embraced by the city.  As it is, you'd be better off just playing Wii Bowling with a 12 pack and some friends at home."},{"name":"El Oriental De Cuba","address":"416 Centre St","city":"Jamaica Plain","stars":"4","text":"Love this place..the food is so good.

Hard to get a reservation here in ideal times, as many know. No complaints about the friendliness or effort level about the staff. Our server was very knowledgeable about the menu. \\n\\n-There was a fairly long between ordering the two appetizers (rock shrimp tacos and biscuits), getting our plates set for the appetizers ... and waiting ... and waiting ... and waiting, finally got them. They were fine, personally wasn't blown away by them, though I'm definitely not someone with an expert palette, so take my review with a grain of salt. Having said that, I'd have really preferred a more flavorful tortilla. In Mexico, the taco tortillas are almost always soaked in the fats that are cooking the meet. These tortillas were quite dull and plain. Biscuits were fine but unremarkable, IMO.\\n\\n-After appetizers, we waited what felt like quite a while for our three entrees. As a heads up, we were seated at 6:30pm, but our entrees weren't brought out until 7:25pm, despite the restuarant being only about 70% full at the time. Perhaps this isn't necessarily a bad thing, perhaps the kitchen is small and only so many things can be cooked at once, but just worth noting that you should expect almost an hour to pass from seating to eating your entree, especially on a busier night.\\n\\n-My mom's medium-well hamburger was very very good. The fries (pomme frites) were unremarkable. I definitely wouldn't have been able to differentiate them from Steak n Shake fries in a blind taste test. \\n\\n-I had the cobia (a whitefish). It was good, but, at least in my opinion, nothing much better than one would find at a higher-end chain like Bonefish, in my opinion. The eggplant bites served with my fish were quite tasty.\\n\\n-My dad had the breaded flounder. Good, but he wasn't blown away by it. \\n\\n-No dessert was ordered, none of us looked at the dessert menu.\\n\\n-My (non-foodie) dad said that he preferred the Cask & Ladder menu more.\\n\\nIn closing, perfectly fine, but nothing that I would rave about to anyone.

There are several other variations of meats and veggies you can order, and everything I've had there has been pretty good. I personally like the spinach and dal.

As I have never tried Colombian food, I wasn't going to pass up this opportunity.  Upon walking through the door I was greeted by a group of smiling servers who said hello and something about sitting down (my Spanish doesn't extend very far past counting to ten - I assumed they were telling me to sit wherever I would like).  About 10 seconds after sitting, my waitress brings a menu and a basket containing a plastic spoon, silverware wrapped in a napkin, and a small plastic container full of some sort of bright yellow substance.  As I had no time to waste and no knowledge of the cuisine, I simply ordered the first item on the menu, the Mini Bandeja Paisa (advertised as the smaller tasting plate) - this made my waitress smile - perhaps I lucked into ordering smartly.  Before I had time to study my surroundings, my plate arrives (seriously - like 5 minutes tops)...oh, and there is nothing small about the Mini.  Large oval plate topped with rice, red beans, a good sized piece of skirt steak, a fried egg, an avocado wedge, fried plantains and a thick wedge of bacon (skin on - yeah).  This big plate of stick to your ribs goodness just looked...I don't know... manly.  I felt like a bit of a tough guy as I tucked in.  Everything was hot, fresh and tasty.  Both my server and the manager popped by my table a couple of times to ensure I had everything I needed and to answer any questions I may have (I guess I was quickly identified as a newbie).  Very nice.  As I finished my plate of food, I began to investigate the mysterious plastic container of bright yellow goo - certainly the plastic spoon was to be used to eat this - so I gave it a go.

Sometimes the owner likes to reminisce about the good-old-days.  \\n\\nOK my experience is limited because I basically order General Gao's (also known as Tso's) chicken at pretty much every Chinese food place I go to. It's sort of a litmus test for me...the be-all and end-all, the beginning and the end, the yin and the yang...\\n\\nSo the thing is, you usually know what you're getting when you order the old General: a tiny bit of chicken encased in a fried doughball that's slathered with ultrasugary ginger sauce. \\n\\nBut there's something different, fascinating, and mysterious about Golden Light's Gen. Gao. Sure you still have the fried dough, the chicken and the sauce...but it's all put together in a way that I've never seen before. For instance, the sauce is darker, tangy-er, and more flavorful. It also doesn't completely engulf the chicken, but is drizzled on in a tasteful fashion. The pieces are smaller and easier to manage. You might wonder to yourself if you actually ordered General Gao's, but all the ingredients are there...so it must be general gao's! \\n\\nSo I applaud Golden Light for taking a meal with such heavy constraints on its preparation and doing something creative and unique with it.

You'd think that would be easier in a town with so many choices. It's not. After an hour of deliberation, I decided I had a hankerin' for Mexican. That doesn't happen often because what you usually get is a plate full of starch. I didn't care.\\n\\nThis is one of those weird places where there is no actual table for the host. What do you get instead? After waiting for what seemed like forever to be checked in, you wait in an area where everybody gathers and stands around, where people are trying to eat. We were told it would be about a 15-20 minute wait so we made our way to the bar. My usual request there is a Pinot Grigio since I'm pretty limited  in what I can have. My partner had a beer. For $7, this was a good amount of white wine and I really appreciated that. It was also a very good Pinot.\\n\\nTen minutes tops, and we were shown to our table. We were led to the area in the back which we really enjoyed because the music was entirely too loud. I think they realized it because there was a sudden decrease in the volume. Maybe they noticed my glare and general disappointment. I don't know. Blaring music is one of a couple things that can ruin a good meal for me. I come from the age of classic rock so I know what volume is. Trust me, as you get older you become less tolerant of it.\\n\\nThe service was excellent and that alone was worth 4 or 5 stars. She was prompt, attentive, and very helpful, even in the selection process.\\n\\nI had the Enchiladas Roja, which came with a mild, smoky red sauce, made with roasted ancho and New Mexico chiles, tomatoes and tamarind. Wrapped in corn tortillas. My mate had a chicken Quesadilla which he said was very good.\\n\\nThe decor in this place is fabulous. According to Matador, it's a case of old world Mexico meets a Texas saloon where you will find meticulously handcrafted tables and bar, custom fabricated iron-work, and antique light fixtures.\\n\\nOverall, a great experience and we'll definitely be back.

Then they forgot to bring all the vegetables they had promised for my dinner- the mushrooms and fregula sarda- but that would have been alright as these too were nearly tasteless. It was as if they boiled the fregula and then tossed with a few mushrooms that were already cooked and then served it. Lastly, the butternut squash and rice was so awful I couldn't take more than one bite - and dear God- BLAND!!!  More than the food, it was the attitude that the waiter and the manager had, as if I were more of a nuisance than a guest; you know a freak! A Vegan!!

This was my second attempt going into Blaze in Burlington having awful customer service. I use to work for Blaze Pizza and I can ensure you that the corporate trainers and owner would be appalled over the kangaroo house of employees, shift leaders, and managers. Last week I came to enjoy a BYO pizza with a side of the new garlic knots. If your business is offering a new product it is important that every position is trained correctly and understands all aspects of job functions. While I was waiting patiently for my pizza the woman firing my pizza burnt the garlic knots twice so I went over to the store manager John to ask if he could assist her. Rolls his eyes walks over and she says \\" I don't know how to make these \\" she says to John. He then remakes the knots and offers me a free water bottle. Based on that experience it was hard for me to go back to this location. On July 13, I gave Blaze a second shot to make things right... oh, things got worse. I go into the shop and ordered two BYO pizzas. The first one was vegetarian the second was vegan. I asked for a glove change for the vegan pizza since my brother has a dairy Allegheny and the female asked twice if she had to change her gloves. As we went down the pizza line you see how unorganized and dirty it was it was unappealing. The ingredients didn't look fresh and there was crumbs of everything all sticking to the sides of the pans. I asked to speak to a manager and she was telling me every possible excuse why her shift was going out of control. Telling me that her GM left her during a huge rush and that all her employees are new and how her day was falling apart... after she vented I said that has nothing to do with me. She got upset at my comment and stated if I can't understand where she's coming from then she doesn't want to hear what I have to say. Being super defiant and rude she did not satisfy me as a customer- in fact I will never be going to any Blaze operated by BGR for their unprofessional business functions. What ever happened to the Plus 1 policy to exceed all expectations and always saying yes to the guests? The corporate office would be appalled to hear this guest interaction with management that clearly can't manage a restaurant.

You can almost miss it when you drive or walk by, the outside facade is nil and it appears just like Rum Club, it's even on the same block, so you almost think you're at Rum Club's outside patio, but you're not.  Weird.\\n\\nThe doorman was nice, he admitted they needed better signage outside. I entered to what seemed a subdued room, few customers, a bar.  I carried on to the next room, the glowing Red light was drawing me in.  This was a bit livelier - stadium seating! this is something I've never seen before in a bar. A half-moon of bleacher seats facing gigantic monitors.  Unfortunately, the Portland Trailblazers were down quite a bit.  The bar would've have been much busier if the Blazers were having a winning season, according to the bartender.\\n\\nThey offer about 12 taps of beer/cider, loads of liquor--emphasis on a hefty row of Tequila.  I ordered a Deschutes Jubelale.  \\n\\nAfter the Blazer loss, they switched to Bingo with Flawless.  Drag Queen Bingo with proceeds benefiting Rock n Roll Girls Camp.  We didn't participate, but it was captivating.  Flawless and her entourage were quite the show.  I recommend Century for an entertaining evening.  They offer Sports watching, Music, Dance, DJ, Bingo, and the hosts were friendly.  \\n\\nI didn't eat, but took a peak at their food menu--appealing with unique, affordable options.  \\n\\nGood service.

Nonetheless, this place was good, and they have a pretty good wine list too."},{"name":"Hot Pot Buffet","address":"70 Beach St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Joining other Hot Pot places in Chinatown (though more are of the Japanese shabu shabu style) is Hot Pot Buffet. In business for over a year, a constant flow of traffic has funneled right in this two level restaurant located [70 Beach Street, Boston, MA (617) 338-0808] adjacent to the welcoming Chinatown Gate. The restaurant is open Monday through Friday 11a.m.-4p.m. for lunch or 4p.m.-2a.m. with lunch being cheaper than dinner. We paid $25 each person on a Saturday night. Please not that on Sundays and holiday lunch pricing is not offered. Hot Pot Buffet offers fresh ingredients, no MSG and very little oil for a tasty and healthy dining experience.\\n\\n \\nHot Pot (aka steamboat) has a history of over 1,000 years and is enjoyed all over China with variations in other countries. It is a fun way to share a meal and eat with friends especially if you like to cook your own food.  It is very easy! First you choose your desired broth out of four options- Chinese Herbal, Mala (Spicy) Soup, Black Chicken Soup and the House Special Broth. Then you can pick your desired food to cook. The sheer variety of food options is amazing and there is something for everyone! Lobster is at market price ($8.95 each on a recent visit) along with 19 other seafood items to choose from ranging from salmon fillet, shrimp, clams, crab legs and fish tofu. Then there are six types of noodles, 33 items under vegetables (tofu and rice cake too), as well as four types of dumplings, six types of seafood and meat balls, and 11 choices of meats. A few exotic items that stand out are the Beef Tongue, Fried Pig Skin, Pig Blood, Quail Eggs, Pork Intestines, Fried Gluten Balls and Wood Ear Mushrooms.\\n \\nNow comes the fun part! Once you get your broth and food, then you wait for the broth to boil and then you slowly put in your food. The items you choose will determine the cooking time, for example tofu and noodles take longer to cook. Veggies and the thinly sliced meats cook very quickly after a few swishes in the hot broth with your chopsticks. Sa cha sauce (made of chilies, shallots, garlic, soybean oil, dried shrimp and brill fish - which gives it a nice savory slightly spicy tinge found in Fujian, Chiu Chow and Taiwanese cooking) is offered for dipping.\\n \\nHot Pot is a great group meal. You can take your time and eat whatever you want. But the best part is the broth at the end of the meal. The soup will have garnered an abundance of flavors from all the food that was put into it and it is the highlight of the meal! It is the best part for me!  To top it off, sliced oranges were offered with the bill at the end. So if you are hungry and want something healthy, check out Hot Pot Buffet."},{"name":"El Patron Mexican Restaurant & Cantina","address":"12167 S Apopka Vineland Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Had a great meal at el Patron this evening.

The show really hyped up the fried chicken and I was determined to try some. Finally, Monday arrived and I was able to check this place out.\\n\\nEach entree order came with two choices of 'veggie' sides. Our group was able to order fried chicken, ham hocks, oxtail, and pork chops (1 smothered and 1 regular). The fried chicken was just like how I imagined it. The skin adhered really well to the meal and provided a nice crunch with just the right amount of seasoning. Delicious Destinations did not lead me astray. The ham hocks were tender but tasted a bit too salty for me. The oxtail was braised well and melted off the bone; the gravy that accompanied the rice was amazing and super savory! Between the two pork chops, I definitely preferred the one that was not smothered because the crust on the smothered one would fall off. \\n\\nAmong the sides, my favorites were the collared greens, carrot souffl√© (great for those with a sweet tooth), fried green tomatoes, and mac n cheese.\\n\\nWe ended the meal with some peach cobbler with ice cream because ...when in Georgia. It was the perfect ending to this a soulful meal in the South. \\n\\nThe area around the Busy Bee Cafe is definitely sketchy so I don't recommend venturing too far off from the restaurant. There are two parking lots - one in the front and one to the right of the building. I really wanted to try the chitlins but the chalkboard indicated that they did not have it that day."},{"name":"The Avenue Steak Tavern","address":"94 N High St","city":"Dublin","stars":"4","text":"There were four of us for dinner. My friend and I started with a glass of prosecco, which was served in coupe glasses. Fun! For an appetizer, the table shared the baked cheese fondue, which the server said was a top seller. To be frank, it wasn't what any of us expected. When I think fondue, I think about one of those cute little pots with sterno below that you dip things in. This arrived in a smallish shallow dish, with grilled/toasted garlic bread standing up in it. Once we got over our visual disappointment, we soldiered on and it was quite tasty. It's a bit tough to wrangle, because you get a bit on the bread and then you need to use your knife to scoop additional cheese on. We were up to the task. \\n\\nMy husband and I chose Caesar salads and our friends opted for the tavern salads. We enjoyed them. I was adventurous and went with the anchovies; they were fresh and delicious.\\n\\nUnfortunately for the entree, my husband chose the filet and he committed a cardinal sin. He ordered it medium well. Even more unfortunately, The Avenue has a very strange way of cooking medium well meat. His entree arrived and it looked like a charcoal briquette. I've never seen a steak with that much bark on it. In addition, his baked potato was cool. (Yes, I should have taken a picture...)\\n\\nMy friend and I both ordered the scallops and they were beautiful. They were served with green beans that still had some snap in them and nicely toasted almonds. We both enjoyed them immensely. My friend's husband chose the steak frites and liked that entree as well.\\n\\nFor dessert my husband and I enjoyed a creme br√ªl√©e and our friends raved about the cheesecake. It would have been a very special night if it hadn't been for the filet fiasco. Since it was raining out it was nice to have the valet parking option ($5), which we used. Also, I really like the fact that when you order an entree you get a side with it and your salad is included. A lot of high end steak houses charge extra for each item. (This is not a cheap meal by any means, but at least you don't feel nickel and dimed.)"},{"name":"Main Event - Atlanta","address":"3101 Cobb Pkwy SE, Ste 104","city":"Atlanta","stars":"2.5","text":"It's Christmas, our families didn't come into town so it's officially me, the hubby and our friends. We open our gifts, cook, eat, watch the basketball games then decide to head out to catch a movie (because we assumed that would be the only place open on Christmas). \\n\\nWe decide on the AMC on Cobb parkway, but as we got closer, found out that the movie we wanted to see was sold out. Odd. Oh well, we decide to go next door to Main Event. Only 1 out of the 4 of us had ever been there so we were actually excited to be checking it out. To our surprise, the place was packed!...on Christmas! And not with other couples with no children obligations or out of town relatives to entertain either. This place was packed with kids and teens! Millions (exaggerating) of kids running everywhere! And teens! Teens who were on dates and looking like they snuck a change a clothes with them bcus they knew mama wasn't having it. I know I sound like the old lady in the room but we were really that shocked that so many people were here on a holiday that...I mean...it's Christmas.\\n\\nSo anyway, enough ranting. We go to the front desk which is almost directly in front of the entrance. The line is short but when it was our turn to be seen, all of the kids - ahem- teens...excuse me, employees, stood at the desk talking to each other. They looked at us like we were wrong for waiting on them to ask us if we needed help or something. So after almost a full 60 seconds of them staring at us and us staring at them, we finally ask how long the wait was for bowling. \\"An hour and a half.\\" Ok we ask if we could play pool. \\"You have to ask over there *points to other side of the room*\\" ok, how about laser tag? Do we pay for that here? \\"No you have to go down to that section.\\"\\n\\nThe entire time this exchange is going on, one of the guys at the next register is whispering into this girl's ear as if she isn't even speaking to us 'the customer'. We get fed up and walk away to figure it all out on our own. At this point I'm already taking mental notes for my Yelp review.\\n\\nThat was really the low of the entire night. The remainder of the night was more annoying than poor customer service. Went to the bar, asked about the pool table, they told us to come back in 15 minutes. Went downstairs to laser tag, paid for a session, then was told to wait 15 min (even though they were letting a group in). We wait, get in, have fun even with no direction from yet again, the kids in charge. After that, we head back to the bar. A couple leaves, we snag their pool table and play a few games. \\n\\nThis place is ok. I'm not a fan of the front desk teens who clearly weren't interested in working, and the plethora of kids running round and bumping into everyone after 9pm on Christmas night. Maybe my expectations were too high based on what I've heard about Main Event but I highly doubt we will ever come back. I was under the impression that this was more of Dave & busters type of deal (which isn't much better), but instead it felt like you were thrown into a upscaled chuck e cheese and over charged to play the adult games. 3 stars for the decent pool tables and the enjoyable laser tag. But the employees have to fix their attitudes or just hire adults to run the area.

The pieces of fish in the roll were big! and the fish tasted very fresh and flavorful.  The ginger dressing was ok, not as good as Sushi Yoko, but decent.  Only downside, for what you get in take out, its a bit pricey. $3 more than Sushi Yoko's \\"Sushi Lunch\\" and they include miso soup and 1 more piece of nigiri.

However, my evening sightseeing had gotten a little out of hand, and after getting lost I found it past 10 on a Monday night and almost everything was closed. I even considered trying Freebirds but they were closed too. I definitely did not want fast food as my cardinal rule on vacation is unless it is a definite last resort (almost got there too!) I don't eat anything I could get back home.\\n\\nI finally found Olmeca's at almost 11 PM. They are open until 11:30 which is, sadly, the best thing about the place. At 11 there were three parties eating in house so I would say it was moderately busy.  They seemed authentic, but this place was a disappointment. I ordered standard fare, a bean and cheese burrito and a Chicken Fajita taco to go so I could eat at my hotel. The waitress told me it would be about five minutes.  After about three minutes I was invited to sit and wait at a table. I was not offered chips and salsa. I watched one of the other waitresses flirting with a customer at least 20 years her senior. I ended up waiting 15 minutes for my food.\\n\\nThe burrito was overly greasy and I started not to feel so well before the taco. The taco was a beef fajita taco! I had asked for chicken! They were lucky that a) I don't mind beef, I was just trying to be a little healthier and b) I was not about to drive back over there at 11:30 to complain. The taco was pretty good, but a little bit small.\\n\\nOverall, this was a disappointment.

I am of the opinion that they switched to a commercially produced patty. Although, I can not be for certain. The unique flavors of the burger were missing. A couple weeks after opening, the taste remained the same. The magic was gone. It was not the same. Why open a restaurant and change the one thing that made the burger a big seller?\\n\\nSurprise, surprise. The hand made patty is back! When I visited recently, I asked the counter guy if they made their own patties and he replied by pointing to the kitchen. Straight through the open window they were mixing minced beef. He said something to the lady in Spanish and she held up a patty for me to see. Stuff it Traveler Foodie!\\n\\nI was impressed to notice that everyone had a hat or hair net on and sanitation gloves. As I casually observed from the counter I could see the grill guy removing buns from the grill, then put on gloves and started to spread sauce from a squeeze bottle. Then he removed the gloves and went back to retrieve the beef patties from the grill with a spatula. He then put on gloves and completed the sandwich. Proper steps for sanitation purposes. Applause. Even more interesting was he used instant hand sanitizer before he grabbed my bag from the kitchen to bring to the counter. There is an abundance of hand sanitizer bottle dispensers all along the counter and kitchen. Really, in a small burger joint? They really are stepping up their game. The Health Inspector will be very thrilled. He might even have a burger, I will and so should you.\\n\\nI also got the Columbiana La Nuestra Kola flavored soda. It was extremely fizzy and tasteless. The finish was a heavy laden coating on my tongue. Not so much. Recently they added arepas, empanadas and a couple of other items on the menu. Since I had a burger craving, I got a burger. Next time I'll try something else. But the burger......gut bomb!

Ok, this is how it went down...\\nI walked in and the TV was very loud. When i walked in, the lady behind the counter went over to restock the drink cooler. In many places, the person would say \\"Give me just a minute, i'll be right with you...\\" However, in this case, she didn't dare do that... that would be too much like right. So i stood and waited at the counter for like a minute, and then she finally asked me what i would like. Ironically, in spite of the loud TV, she spoke as softly as possible. I was like \\"I can not hear you\\", which i will abbreviate from now on as ICNHY. I decided on the stewed chicken and asked what sides i would get with it. She muttered something and i was like ICNHY, so she repeated something about i could get either rice or rice and beans because that's all they had (what?!). Since i ICouldNHHer i asked again just to confirm... Do you have any vegetables or at all like cabbage? She said \\"Yes, you get cabbage... Did you think you wouldn't get cabbage?\\" I said \\"Well, since ICNHY, i thought you said you didn't have cabbage.\\" She also volunteered the info that they didn't have plantains today b/c they weren't ripe enough or something Krazy, which i was very much not happy about b/c whenever i go to a Caribbean restaurant, the second most important thing (after the main entr√©e) is plantains... so i was like ok, whatever. Then once she rang up my order, she informed me that the Scoutmob i was using didn't cover anything but the entr√©e, not the meat pie or the soda.  At this point, i was like ok whatever, i'm just gonna get my food now b/c i have a Scoutmob, and just never come back.\\nAll that being said, the food was GREAT! The stew chicken was so flavorful. The cabbage was also good, and the rice and beans were good as well. And they gave me a crapload of food!... I was able to make two meals off of it.

The hostess should be fired.  I greeted her, she didn't smile or respond with even one word, then led us to our table where she mumbled something that neither of us could hear or understand as she walked away.  It was clear that she didn't want to be there and/or hated her job, but it's not the greeting I expect when being seated by a hostess. It didn't take long for a server to tell us he would be right with us.  The food selection was right on, and they were quick to fill any containers on the buffet line that were nearing empty.  Both of the cooks were friendly and seemed to enjoy their jobs, but 1 of the 2 was especially entertaining and talkative.  I enjoyed his interaction with the guests and especially the younger kids.  We both enjoyed our food.  I made a trip to the salad bar, and while I decided I only wanted soup, I noticed that there were no salad bar plates and they were not restocked until our meal was nearly complete some 40 minutes later.  The Chicken Chili soup was nearly gone, so i only got a small amount of that from the bottom of the container.  I chose not to bring those to their attention, but am assuming they would have gotten salad bar plates and more soup, had I done that.  The star of the night was our server #1294, Marcus P.  He is pleasant, has good communication skills, always had a smile on his face and was quick with anything that we needed.  He came around often to refill our drinks, remove our empty plates, provide my son with additional bowls and offered dessert, as well.  He's the epitome of the server that you want in any restaurant.

You get a tour through the kitchen, the food is served family style (more on that later), and each room  has a unique theme. I'll also say that at both restaurants, the staff was unbelievably friendly and accommodating, so they're doing a great job in terms of staffing.\\n\\nThe food, however, is ridiculously overpriced for what you get. The \\"large\\" portions seemed much much appropriate for the price than the \\"small\\" ones, but still ridiculous at around $30 for a large. Honestly, the small portion (which they say feeds 2-3 people comfortably) was something I would expect in a single portion at a comparable Italian restaurant. Maybe that's the super-size-bigger-is-better American ideology coming out, but at a chain restaurant, I expect to get my money's worth. \\n\\nAside from the price, the food is just okay at best.

Each visit, the service gets worse, rather than improving. We first visited only a week or so after they opened. We usually will eat dinner in the dining area, order some drinks at the bar, and then spend about $25 playing arcade games or bowling after that. \\n\\nThe waiters and waitresses in the dining area are obviously not well-managed or well-trained, because they always struggle to decide which one of them will seat us or wait on us. Usually, after we are seated, about three on average will come by and say something like, \\"Y'all been served yet? No? Okay, let me find your waitress.\\" This leads us to waiting at least ten minutes while seated before we can even place a drink order (or get water).\\n\\nThe bar might even be worse. Slow service, despite DOZENS of employees walking around, foamy beers and not the strongest cocktails.\\n\\nWant to order drinks (or God forbid food) while bowling? After waiting for service, being assured that someone would come by to take our orders \\"soon,\\" and bowling AN ENTIRE GAME, we ordered two beers from our lane (once I literally chased down an employee to help us out). Again, the waiters will practically argue with one another over who is in charge of serving your area before they even bother to ask what you would like. \\n\\nWe credited these problems at first with the place being new. However, it's now been open long enough to have sorted out these issues.

The inside is pretty dark, but if you like that sort of thing, then this is the place.  I guess during the evenings it turns into a club? Either way, even with all the windows at the front of the establishment it wasn't light enough for us. We wanted to enjoy the Portland weather.

I mean, really, how often do you get to mess around with a dry erase marker? Answer honestly.\\n\\nThis was my first time to really sit down and explore the World of Dim Sum. I decided to sample a variety of the native foliage. They were fresh out of tofu dumplings, but I had the spinach and the vegetable ones.\\n\\n***The spinach dumplings were a (totally) sweet neon green!***\\n\\nAlso, they were tantalizingly sticky and flavorful. As was the mixed veggie bun that I ordered.\\n\\nAnd the steamed broccoli! A great healthy item, and the vegan oyster sauce is still making my mouth water even a couple hours later.\\n\\nMy friend is the one who invited me to this place, and he had some more seafood and meaty type stuff. Shrimp dumplings, fried eggplant, sticky rice, and pork dumplings. It all looked quite tasty, and my friend made me look closely at the dumplings:\\n\\"Look, Joel, it actually takes high quality craftsmanship to fold the dumplings like they do here. You don't see this just anywhere.\\"\\n\\nAnd my friend is Chinese, so of course he is very wise and inscrutable.\\n\\nGet Sum Dim Sum is ideal if you want anything from the range of a healthy snack ($5 for six dumpling pieces) to a satiating lunch or dinner (which will probably run you around $12 or $15).\\n\\nBut we all know the real reason you come here is to listen to rockin' '80s tunes like \\"Material Girl\\" as you sip your \\"pop soda\\" with the marble in it, yeah!\\n\\nSo, in sum (\\"Is that word play he just did?\\"), I have made it my personal mission to support this business as much as I reasonably can. In other words, I think you'll find me in here at least once a week from now on. I can't wait to try out all the specials and variations and so forth.

A cobb that I wouldn't mind having again. Also obsessed with french fries, these passed the test, too. \\n\\nThe service was quick and friendly, and our large group of twenty or so were pretty excited when he happily doled out separate checks.

So just get two of those. \\n\\nWe also got the fried jalape√±os with goat cheese and bacon. When I read the description, I was very excited - after receiving them the weren't quite all I'd hoped, but they were still pretty good. They came with a blackbean/corn relish... It didn't really seem to go, but whatever. \\n\\nNext came the breads and salads. A pretty standard Caesar for me, the cornbread was really good - and the melted garlic butter was an awesome companion!\\n\\nNext came the meat. 22 ounces of bovine perfection. As far as I'm concerned, you can keep your filets, gimme a ribeye any day. I was very happy with mine - and my side of cholulah hollandaise - with grilled zucchini.

I would normally assume that most people who don't like this place just don't enjoy the experience of Cuban food, but this is not the case with me. I truly appreciate good Cuban food, the spices and the tenderness of the meat all intermingling can make quite an interesting culinary experience.

However, as much as I'd like to rave about how wonderful our meal was, I'd have to describe our experience as \\"mixed\\".  My appetizer, the shrimp and grits, was far and away the best dish I've ever tasted.  Sumptuous and creamy, every ingredient went perfectly together.  (Seriously, if you eat here, order it.)  But my husband's, the gatherer salad, was heavily dressed with a strong vinaigrette, and he didn't eat much.  My husband's entree was grouper, and it was quite tasty.  Mine was guinea hen, ground dark meat wrapped in a breast with the skin on and doused in lemon oil.  The fattiness of the skin and the overwhelming lemon oil left me less than impressed.  On top of that, my side of heirloom ratatouille was... strangely meaty.  But then both of our desserts were quite good.  And the wine our waiter suggested went very nicely with my meal.  \\n\\nOverall I'm glad we went.  The prix fixe menu made it easier to deal with a less-than-wonderful dish as the cost of the meal was about as much as I would have paid just for the entree.

The clams and oysters were also tasty.  My favourite entree was the oxtail.\\n\\nThe only criticism I have is that in the effort to use more earthy ingredients is not always the tastiest.

It has taken a while to receive food when ordering, but it's never been the excruciating wait that people seem to be describing. I'd hate on the food, but I've come to the conclusion that most Latin style food in New England is total crap (probably due to the extreme distance from Latin countries), and at least the food I've had at Boca has been edible - and yes, I have tried it without the alcohol with the same opinion. I haven't found any Latin restaurants since moving to Massachusetts that haven't made me long for something closer to the border, so I honestly don't understand all of the whining.

The wontons were fantastic, broth was light with detectable taste of flounder, and it wasn't salty. The donut was pretty good, but I still think that Kongee Dinesty is better. I'd say if you're in the local area, Congee Noodle House is a good casual eatery for Cantonese favorites (I would definitely be back), but if you're looking for the ultimate congee experience, Kongee Dinesty is the way to go.

Unless you count my hotel, which for food you shouldn't, because while Kennedy School has some great stuff going for it, food is not one of them.  \\n\\nAnd why did we come twice?  Well, for mushroom-rosemary gravy.\\n\\nThere is a caveat, though.  I'm a pescetarian now, blah blah long story, but it's a recent development.  I haven't had something like their Roll Over in a while, and I was an unabashed carnivore.  They substituted vegan sausage for the real stuff, but it was all second fiddle to that crazy delicious gravy.  And I love heavy breakfasts.  If you're gonna pay someone to make you breakfast, it should have a touch of insanity to it, cuz eggs and potatoes and fruit and toast?  That's easy.\\n\\nMushroom-rosemary gravy before noon?  Wild.\\n\\nOther food items we had included the Good Dog (good, and surprisingly spicy) the Salm I Am (also good, plus smoked salmon that wasn't whipped) and some biscuits, which were awesome.\\n\\nYou grab your own coffee and water, but lets break that fourth wall and admit that it's not going to ruin your goddamn dining experience.  Eating out at a restaurant doesn't make you the Pope.  And he probably only doesn't get his own water cuz he's old.

Plus, I live only a couple of blocks away so they were still hot when I got home. \\n\\nI first tried the ham crepe. It had a generous portion of ham, but very little cheese and just a few mushrooms. Although the crepe was cooked well, it had little flavour as a whole. Not too impressed. It probably would have tasted a lot better if they had grilled the ham before putting it inside the crepe or even just a little more cheese.\\n\\nThe salmon crepe tasted much better overall, because the cream cheese really brought all the flavours together. The raw onions added a crunchy texture that I really loved but it would have been even better with a few capers to add that briney saltiness that goes so well with lox. The heat from the crepe kind of cooked the salmon and transformed it - which was not appealing to me. The salmon was a little dry around the edges anyway, but the heat kind of ruined it altogether. \\n\\nAll in all, I was disappointed with these two savoury crepes and I would not go back for more. I would, however, go back to try a sweet crepe, a panini or ice cream.

Did all The Decemberists die in a plane crash?\\" We got looks for whispering quietly amongst ourselves. On top of the weird vibe, we got a little bit of shade from the barista because we were asking questions about the tea. That whole put-upon barista routine is so tired, guys. \\n\\nI went back on my own a few days later, and got the same icy stares as I walked in. It's definitely a quiet crowd here.

I've only ever had the teriyaki chicken and gyozas here, and both are delicious and a good value for the dollar, which is why I keep coming back, but I want the management to be aware of something that happened today that made me cancel my order and may prevent my return in the future.  I was in the parking lot because I had an errand to run and decided to place an order for pickup.  The gal told me my food would be ready in 10-15 minutes and I mentioned that I was parked out front and could she please call me when it was ready so I could come in and pay for it and pick it up.  Since I have young children, I really didn't want to drag them in to wait that long in the restaurant.  Basically she told me they don't usually call people when their order is ready and when I pushed back asking her to make an exception she told me to just come in in 15 minutes.  I know from experience that often their food is ready quicker than the estimate she gave me and of course if our food was ready in 5 or 10 minutes I didn't want to sit in my car an extra 5-10 minutes longer than necessary (with said small children) and a phone call would have taken her less than 30 seconds.  In the end I told her to cancel our order if they couldn't accommodate a phone call and she gladly cancelled the order and that was the end of it.

Dorian and I came here tonight, and we were both excited after checking out the website.  I was kind of surprised by the mix of reviews, and couldn't wait to see what we both thought of it.  We were greeted upon entering by Andrea Benatti, dressed  very casually, and it felt like entering a home in the warmest way possible.  He took our coats and offered us two tables to choose from, which was nice instead of just seating us.\\n\\nFirst off, the space is small but really decorated beautifully.  I love the oval table in the window with the lamp above it.  The design is really fun in the dining room and in the bar area it's kind of warm in the sense you can see into the kitchen.  It's fun watching people who clearly love food cook,  which is definitely the case observing the owner (and chef) Andrea Benatti do his thing-it looked effortless and everything came out beautiful.\\n\\nThe food:\\nTo begin, we each ordered a glass of wine, and I went with the Chianti, which was delicious and a very generous pour for $10.  It was really the perfect glass of wine for me.  We were brought out each a piece of fresh warm bread by our waitress, with balsamic and olive oil with salt and pepper for dipping.  It was really good olive oil and balsamic vinegar and they were paired perfectly together.....I think we've all have those moments when you get olive oil at a restaurant and it just isn't tasty.  Not the case here.  We went with a salad to start, which contained mixed greens with a balsamic orange reduction and walnuts.  They split the salad for us and gave us each a beautifully plated salad, which was really nice versus having us share or scoop it to an extra plate.  I ordered the potato pasta with pesto, and Dorian went with the risotto with mushrooms and truffle oil.  Our entrees came out quick, and we were both thrilled with our selections.  My potato pasta were little airy delicious puffs of pasta that were so tender and the pesto was truly delicious.  My only suggestion is that there was something giving every few bites a little bit of grit (perhaps pepper or the walnuts) and that was the only downfall.  The dish otherwise was perfect.  It was the ideal amount of pasta.  Dorian's risotto was creamy and you could actually smell the truffle oil before it got to the table.  While I don't like whole mushrooms, I tasted a bite avoiding the mushrooms and it was really decadent, rich and filling. \\n\\nI'd read the reviews about the portions, and honestly, I think they are the perfect size.  We left happy and not busting at the seams, and if you want a huge amount of pasta and to go into a coma when you leave, this isn't your place.  It leaves you some room for dessert if you wish (we opted to skip it this time around, but it looked awesome going to other tables) and also to enjoy some of the antipasti or a salad and wine.  \\n\\nThe service was really delightful and authentically pleasant, which isn't the case in so many other restaurants around.  Our waitress (there was one for the entire place) was very friendly, smiling, and attentive, without being overbearing of fake.  She listed the specials from memory and was very generous to offer more details about the dishes for anyone who wanted them.  She clearly was passionate about the food, and doing her job well.  The check was very reasonable at $76 for two glasses of wine, two entrees, and a salad, and we had a restaurant.com gift certificate to use as well.\\n\\nI'll definitely be back here, and I really appreciate having a high end Italian restaurant in our neighborhood.....it was a lovely dinner outing on a Thursday night!"},{"name":"The Colonial House Restaurant","address":"33 Savin Ave","city":"Norwood","stars":"3.5","text":"Over rated Pub Grub in the extreme!

At Wings Kitchen you'll find the genuine article, here the dish features small morsels of chicken, in a crisp batter, topped with a delicious sauce that's not too sweet, and accompanied by crisp green beans. \\n      \\n\\nThis is a list of everything I've tried.

I believe they are putting in the required kitchen equipment to do the Chinese food part of the menu.  For now, they are doing sushi and I have to say it is MUCH better than the previous sushi that was served but the pricing structure is different.  The yellow plates, which are deep fried egg rolls,  wonton skins, rice flour sesame balls with bean filling are $1.50 (i think it was) and the rest of the plates, any color are $2.25.

I looked on Yelp for more info, of course.\\n\\nFor me, I think the overall rating (3.5) is accurate. My take.\\n\\n*****\\nI. PARKING & LOCATION: This eatery resides in a really random strip mall off of Cheshire Bridge Road, next to (as I wrote above) a DWI school. Parking is plentiful, although, I'm not sure how packed it gets during the school's session. \\n\\nII. FOOD & DRINK: Like most Philly cheesesteak joints, you can ask for a basic cheesesteak and add mushrooms, peppers, and other delectables on top. I went with their a small \\"regular\\" (I forget the name) cheesesteak. \\n\\nThe sub had thoroughly cooked rib eye and a tasty cheese (maybe white cheddar?) holding everything together. The meat was topped with pretty standard tomato and chopped lettuce, and everything was wedged in between soft sub bread. \\n\\nAside from the cheese, I thought everything else was A-OK. Would I choose this cheesesteak over Fred's Meat and Bread or Woody's? No. But for the price point, I'm not complaining. It's a decent enough to satisfy your meaty yearnin'. (That's what she said.) \\n\\nIII. SERVICE: They had super friendly folks working behind the counter, however, despite being not too busy during lunch it took about ten to fifteen minutes for my order to come out. I would expect a bit faster service for a cheesesteak. It's not a big deal, though!\\n\\nIV. AMBIENCE & D√âCOR: A few booths and small tables are scattered throughout. There are a couple TVs where you can catch-up on local news. (I learned that a man held a woman captive in Georgia for three years. WTF?) I would suggest to take your cheesesteak to go, because local news is straight up depressing, yo. \\n\\nV. PRICES: Really affordable for what you get. I think the price is just right.\\n\\nVI. OVERALL: Would I drive across town to eat there? No. Does it serve as a solid cheesesteak place if I'm in the area? Absolutely."},{"name":"Greek Village Restaurant","address":"3577 Lake Emma Rd, Ste 111","city":"Lake Mary","stars":"4.5","text":"Went there over the weekend while on vacation visiting family.

The quality of the meats were not that great. I saw some of this gross yellow fat on the prime-rib eye that turned me off, and the chicken breast did not taste as fresh when I cooked it then I hoped. The beef lean cut  and beef balls was tough and not delicious at all. Most things that we got were alright, but I was disappointed with some of the ingredients in comparison to other hot pot locations. Also, I had an issue with the soups--the House Special, Herbal chicken, and Black Chicken soups did not look too much different, nor were their ingredients super different! And we didn't know this, but they charged us $4 extra just for the soups!! I was wondering why they didn't tell us in the up front. Well, shouldn't be too surprised since you have to wave these people down to get their attention so it's just the way things are run.\\n\\nIf you come here, you should not expect high quality foods.

I am a great lover of these grilled meats with rice, beans, and PLANTAINS (loooove them), and this place serves a mean plate of these.  \\n\\nNow, had I known how awesome their beef soup looked, I would have ordered one of those.  But instead we ordered the Bandeja Paisa and the Carne Asada plate.  Don't do the Carne Asada, just go with the Bandeja Paisa which includes a similar-sized cut of the beef along with a chorizo, two pieces of out-of-this-world fried pork bellies, and rice & beans as well.  Carne Asada has the beef with salad & rice.  Both come with big pieces of awesomely good plantains.  The grilled skirt steak is flavorful with just a tad of the gamey flavor that's easy to ignore.  The chorizo has a very different flavor than the Argentinian kind, and I liked it much better.  The rice was too salty for my liking, but the rest of the meal is not at all so it balanced just fine.  Beans were good, but I've had better.\\n\\nAt just $10 & $12 for large plates of great food, this is an outright bargain.  They do brisk business, and you can see why.  Also the server was an absolute darling!  Next time, beef soup!\\n\\nTable-for-1 Factor:  There is always tables open (it's a big place) so you probably won't feel too awkward eating alone, although I did not see anyone do that while we were there.

I'll start with my only complaint about the place (not a big enough complaint to stop me from giving them a five-star rating): my sister is only eighteen, so I decided to skip the alcohol that day and just eat quickly and let the server flip the table ASAP to make up for that. However my non-alcoholic drink didn't arrive until my food got to the table and the server kept trying to sell alcohol to me and my (very clearly underaged) sister before and after the meal. I assume they're supposed to push those drinks, and hopefully she would have checked her ID if my sister had for some reason tried to order something, but it does seem a bit careless for a restaurant so close to a college. \\n\\nMy sister got the strawberry pancakes, I had the standard toast and egg breakfast. Both of us were super happy with the taste and size of our meals - we both left perfectly full after eating everything on our plates. The atmosphere is lovely (fun but not overbearing decorations) and the location is great; we got a table by the windows and enjoyed a nice view of the street and patio.

It was more like trying to chew a flavorless piece of tile.  I had the Pasta Rustico, which was described as having sausage, chicken and shrimp in a light cream sauce.  It had one shrimp, mostly chicken and zero flavor. After adding salt, pepper and crushed red pepper it was edible.  While the restaurant was not busy at all, our service was weak at best.

Well i learned i dont like sweet tea...  weird but i dont.   However i gave it a shot and passed it on jeff.   So then came the basket of bread and cornbread.  Well the bread was soft and warm and perfectly complimented by honey butter.  And the cornbread was also warm and the perfect balance of sweetness and cornness.   Also perfect with the honey butter.   As soon as we were done, we got our meals.   I opted for the the white meat  which was a wing and big old chicken bosom.   And of course i got the mashed potatoes which reminded me exactly of how my mom would make them.  I really wanted the fried corn, but they were out so i settled for the broccoli caserole, which again tasted like it came right out of my mom's kitchen.  Awesome.    We got additional sides of fried green tomatoes and fried okra which were good... but its hard to mess up something that is fried.   \\n\\nAs for the chicken... it was not too greasy, perfectly crispy and had great flavor.

I didn't feel greasy at all\\n\\nOf course we had to try the peach cobbler for dessert (we were in Georgia!) which was great.

Which is a shame because the food's not terrible (pretty standard hole-in-the-wall pizza joint fare) and it's incredibly close to my house (and the Brendan Behan.) I really wanted to like this place, and I feel like I gave it a fair shot. But I'm going back there, and here's why. \\n\\nLast night I called in and ordered a pizza. I was told it would be about 25 minutes. No problem - I waited 30 min., then walked down. When I arrived I was told it would be another 4 minutes until the pizza was ready. Again, no problem. I paid and then sat down to wait. \\n\\n15 minutes went by and no sign of a pizza. I then see a pizza come out but the girl at the counter quickly gives it to some people who came in after me (but who I assumed also called in an order.) I go up to the counter and ask how much longer she thinks it will be. She asks me what my order was, then checks with the cook, who angrily tells her (you guessed it) that my pizza was the one he just gave her and she consequently just gave to the wrong people. \\n\\nThis is where things really start to break down, because this is not an unreasonable situation, but no one involved seemed to have any idea how to handle it. The girl at the counter, the pizza cook, and the owner (who was also in the kitchen) talked it over with an air of panic for 3 or 4 minutes. All the while I was just standing there waiting for someone to tell me something, anything. What really makes me angry is that owner made no attempt to apologize to me and seemed to carefully avoid any eye-contact. He simply sniped at the counter-girl, who then passed on this communication to me: there was another pizza almost ready that I could have. It would be another 2 minutes. \\n\\nI had already paid, so it was a little late to leave. And two minutes didn't seem like long, considering how much time I had already invested. It was late, I was hungry, so I continued to wait. \\n\\nI should also add that Slice O Pie is pretty poorly ventilated. And with the kitchen directly behind the counter (and not separated by any wall or barrier) it's quite smoky in there. So not only I am waiting, but I'm waiting in a cloud of smoke and grease. \\n\\nIt was another 15 minutes before I finally got my pizza (and not until I got home that I realized it had the wrong toppings on it.) However, other than a vague apology from the counter-girl, I got no other retribution for my time or aggravation.  I wasn't offered the pizza for free, I wasn't offered a discount on a future purchase - nothing.  \\n\\nI guess I could have thrown a fit about it all, but I don't feel like I should have to do that - especially when the owner was standing right there. I feel like the owner of a restaurant (especially a brand new one) should be a little more anxious; he or she should WANT to make a good impression on every person who comes in, and if they screw up and they should WANT to fix it. And since that wasn't my experience, I doubt I'll be going back anytime soon. \\n\\nJP's got plenty of other pizza places."},{"name":"Bloc Somerville","address":"11 Bow St","city":"Somerville","stars":"3.5","text":"Good iced tea.

I was debating between this or Beantown, and decided to satisfy my curiosity on this place. That was a bad decision.\\n\\nThe service was okay. The use of iPad for checks was pretty convenient, since splitting checks is easier that way.\\n\\nWe ordered the Emperor and the Dumpling Room dumplings. They were $9 and $7.5 respectively, for six pieces each. That's pretty expensive for dumplings. Even for a high end place (which this is not), the dumplings better be pretty good to fetch such prices. And these dumplings were not nearly that good.\\n\\nFirst of all, it took forever for them to bring out our orders. The place was barely 30% pack, but it still took them a good 40 or so minutes before they brought out the food. Dumplings are supposed to be fast. A good Asian place can turn out dozens in less than 10 minutes. Sitting on steel chair listening to \\"Sweet Candy\\" Pandora radio didn't make the wait any better.\\n\\nOnce our orders had arrived, right away I thought these dumplings were ugly. I mean, really ugly. Not only did they not have the traditional shape, they were not even consistent in what shape they took. Some were folded over multiple times, and some were just simply flop together like raviolis (which is fine, if I had ordered raviolis). How did the owners expect them to cook evenly when they weren't even shape similarly?\\n\\nAnd on top of them were these unevenly shaped ginger pieces. Now when Chinese restaurants use ginger as garnish, the ginger is cut into very thin, even strips. They also use \\"young\\" ginger, so the pieces are tender and not too harsh. At the Dumpling Room, the garnish was made out of regular old ginger, so they had a much tougher texture in the mouth. Oh, and the pieces were also dry. Really unpleasant.\\n\\nThe dough was good, but a bit thick, and the filling was okay. Maybe slightly better than the frozen ones I can get at an Asian supermarket, or Costco.\\n\\nThe bottom line is the dumplings were just not worth the price and the wait. Sorry, but there's no way I will be going back.\\n\\nEdit: I would like to add that just 15 minutes walk away at Mulan on Broadway, you can get authentic dumplings at $7 for 12 pieces, or buy the frozen version to cook at home at $14 for 50 pieces.

First time, no big deal, little boy working doesnt quite grasp that the tea is out and changes every other drink except the specific one I asked for. Another person had to do it. I bkew it off, no big deal. Now comes to my 7/3 visit. I order The Avocado. What's the main ingredient in The Avocado? Avocado. I pay 10 bucks plus tip 2, and get home to a sandwich with no avocado. Head back but they're closed. I thought the little guy working seemed off but come on.  You even called out.  Liz your avocado is ready.  Call and leave a message about issue and come bright and early to return their avocado-less sandwich and to ask for a refund. The first guy looks confused then grabs a young lady who says not a single word after I explain the reason I was there. She then walks away, still not saying a word, and grabs an older lady. This lady is nice. She apologizes but clearly didnt know how to do a refund. She then asks the young lady to call the manager. Manager talks to the lady and somewhere in that convo they realize neither has the password to do the refund. So they say, we can do it tomorrow. I have like no trust at this point. I call the manager who explains that hes off today and cant do anything until tomorrow when he's working. I ask for my receipt back, and he says that he will need that to do refund. I calmly explain that I will bring it back in the morning bc I want to make sure the refund is done. If you cant do it today, I have little faith you can do it tomorrow."},{"name":"J.

I ordered a tall Modelo Especial and took the bartendress's advice on ordering the flat iron steak tacos over the lamb tacos.  The beer was tall, cold, and fresh- so far so good.  But then she kind of hesitated and unconfidently asked me if I had a credit card she could hold on to \\"for uh security reasons.\\"  Only time I'm ever asked to leave a card on hold anywhere is when I'm starting a drinks tab and leaving the bar, and never once when I've sat down to eat and order food.  So I felt pretty insulted, especially when the two women and the man who later sat next to me weren't considered to be the same security risk or asked to leave a credit card while they ate.\\n\\nAnyway, so the steak tacos came out really fast, so I gotta give them an A+ for speed.  They had a good flavor to them, but the steak itself was very chewy, like a chop steak you use to make ground beef or stew with.  It was pretty disappointing since these were $14 tacos.  I do have to say that that the salsa was very fresh, the house made hot sauce was flaming and flavorful, and the black beans were up to part.\\n\\nSo pretty much it was just the chewy steak and being treated like a potential thief that turned me off to the experience here.

Let me also say that when we lived in Austin, Ranch 616 was by far our favorite restaurant.  We ate there all the time.  And since my husband worked downtown, he would eat here at least once a week for lunch with coworkers and clients.  \\nLast weekend I was in town with several ladies, some whom have never visited Texas before, so my first thought was to bring them here for a little taste of Austin's awesome food and eclectic vibe.  By the time dinner was over, I was so embarrassed and brokenhearted by the service we received that I could have cried.  Our waiter was beyond rude and completely dismissive of anything we said or asked for.  And if that wasn't bad enough, four of us ordered the petite filet, that came out so drenched in peppercorn that it was truly brutal and next to impossible to eat.

They have items that are more expensive than the others and of course this place would rather get rid of the cheap stuff like rib eye or pork slice than the clams and shrimp. So what happened to me was that they gave so much rib eye to me and my girlfriend that i thought it would dramatically fill me up, there was probably around 25 slices and we would rather have maybe 10 to have different varieties. I have no complaints on that but what was really irritating is when we ordered clams. me and my girlfriend love clams and at first we ordered 8 but they only brought out 4. Somehow we thought it was just a simple mistake even though the number 8 looks completely different than a 4. we ate all the clams and ordered more, this time we wrote 8 again, and they gave us 2..... we did the same exact thing for the past few times and got different amounts. Imm not going to give this place a bad review over clams but I would at least expect the amount I ordered. bottom line, they will give you more of the cheap stuff and less of the expensive ones.

The corner it laid on was full of green plants and trees and the cold fresh Oregon air only made it more of a hidden gem than I thought . \\n\\nAs I walked in it is obvious the locals love it here. Filled with people of all ages and a very casual and collected crowd. Prior to my order the main host was preparing someone's drinks. He then greeted me and was super nice. There is no background music which makes it awkward at first but when you tone everyone out it is not too bad. \\n\\nI asked for a classic americano and then asked for his recommendation to pastry. He told me the coffe cake was the best one and one of his favorites. It only took about 2 minutes to have my order ready. \\n\\nThe drink was really well crafted and the coffee cake was ok. I was not blown away but the location and the people make it extra comforting. I would make my way over to this Side of the woods in the future . \\n\\nI give it a 3 stars.

I was very hesitant but hoped for the best. \\n\\nService has definitely gotten A LOT better, but still needs a bit more work. You know the service is lacking a little bit when you have to ask the server for certain things over and over. For example, a spoon.

Other than that, he checked up on us a lot and seemed to care about whether or not we were having a good experience. \\n\\nIn terms of food, quantities are quite big, to the point where it's almost a waste. The freshness of the foods are questionable, but doesn't look mysterious to the point where I wouldn't eat it. Broths and sauces were good.

Our waiter was so sweet  can't wait to come here again!"},{"name":"Pisces Rising","address":"239 W 4th Ave","city":"Mount Dora","stars":"3.5","text":"I had high hopes for this place as the restaurant is in a great location.  The server didn't know much about the menu. We ordered the ahi tuna which was recommend and came out slimy and terrible.  The \\"fresh fish\\" sandwich came out with a slice  of processed cheese, like you would get in a cafeteria..or McDonalds.. and the other 3 dishes ordered were lacking in flavor and pretty much like a fast food joint. I just expected more coming from such a nice location.  I would never go back."},{"name":"Ginza Japanese Steak & Sushi Bar","address":"1101 E Colonial Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3","text":"I found the food to be good and the price to be very good. The hostess was very quick to check us in and seat us promptly. The server kept our drinks filled and was friendly.  The special is the best option for the money you will get Steak, Chicken and Shrimp.\\nGo on Sunday they are less busy and you will get a good seat."},{"name":"Miller's Ale House - Orlando","address":"8963 International Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"Unprepared. Lack of hustle. \\nVisited this venue for a scheduled alumni associate event prior to a bowl game. Our fan base packed all the bars and brought an outstanding amount of business, but Millers didn't have more than one bar tender at a bar, the kitchen was slammed and hustle of the employees was sadly lacking. It could have been a great opportunity for this business, but instead they really dropped the ball. Management should have be more prepared."},{"name":"Velvet Taco Domain","address":"11501 Rock Rose Ave, Ste 160","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Velvet Taco is literally one of my favorite places in Dallas. And when I saw that there was a Velvet Taco in my friends neighborhood. It was a must stop during my visit to Austin. Like it was non-negotiable \\n\\nThankfully Velvet Taco is open late on Saturdays because we definitely were hungry after a late night out. My favorite is the corn. Omg!!!! Literally amazing, it's elote corn and seriously I could eat just that all the time. It is so flavorful. And for being so late, I was surprised it wasn't crazy busy. Which was ok for me because I was hungry. \\n\\nWe got the tots, corn, rotisserie chicken Taco, spicy tikka chicken, and the falafel tacos. Sooooo good. I really enjoy Velvet Tacos with each bite. It's seriously my favorite. And seriously, I think I love it so much because of the corn. But honestly, I've never been disappointed in anything I've gotten here. So it's definitely a must try! I would recommend Velvet Tacos to anyone. Can you please open up a location in Denver? I mean it would be dangerous but I would eat here pretty often."},{"name":"El Patron Mexican Restaurant & Cantina","address":"12167 S Apopka Vineland Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"The food and staff are amazing! We started with the queso fudido so good!! My husband had the carne asada which he loved I had the steak fajitas delicious! Our waiter was so attentive and even sent a bag of chips for our daughter who couldn't get enough. She's 2 1/2 and couldn't stop eating the chips and salsa!! Her chicken taco was also very good. If your in the area a must if you like mexican food."},{"name":"Tin Shed Garden Cafe","address":"1438 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Saturday morning with a party of (3) around 10AM. Great local place with good wholesome food. It's pet friendly. Atmosphere is pretty cool and casual. Service is good as well. Food wait wasn't long. Only bummer part is the wait time - tip: you have to go up to the podium and put your name on the waiting list. It's awkward watching other people just stand there waiting for someone to take down your name. It's around a 30min wait time pending how many people your with and the table availability."},{"name":"The Florentine","address":"907 W Broad St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"I was impressed with the food here.

Great soup, pie and cocktails. What more could you ask for at 10 PM on a weekend. Slow service because they have only a couple of people working. Line builds fast. Relax, no need to hurry. GREAT pie - went well with coffee or cocktails."},{"name":"Smokey Bones Bar & Fire Grill","address":"3400 E Colonial Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"Something to be said for the consistency of this place - the food is always good, sweet BBQ, steak and blue cheese salad is AMAZING.. this last time we sat at the bar, and even though I know I may have a heightened ear for music, something was going on with the speakers the whole time. They were popping and it was getting softer and the louder, very distracting and sounded terrible. Not a reflection on the service though, our bartender was adorable and super friendly! \\n\\nWe got food to go, but presentation was nice, atmosphere was fun and upbeat for a Friday, drinks were reasonable and other than the tunes, it was great!"},{"name":"Yebisuya","address":"6035 Peachtree Rd, Ste A-105","city":"Doraville","stars":"3.5","text":"Today was my 2nd trip to Yebisuya. The first was last Saturday. Twice within such a short amount of time? I stand behind what I said in one of my earlier reviews that so far nothing can really beat those ramen I had in Ginza or Shibuya. So I am back to earth, or at least rate Yebisuya based on all the ramen places I had tried in Atlanta. \\n\\nAMBIENCE 4.8/5\\nI appreciate how Yebisuya did not try to create a hip and trendy atmosphere. It is a ramen place for goodness sake, we do not need loud music like in a pub which some ramen places I been to are guilty of. I took off one fifth of a point simply cos I personally am not crazy of those seatings which I have to take off my shoes and leaving my shoes out there. People who walked past the table may kick my shoes or dirty my shoes. Also, my feet were so cold. I needed to bring socks the next time if they ever put me by one of those tables. \\n\\n\\nFOOD 5/5\\n1st visit - \\"Powerful\\" Tonkotsu Ramen ($13.95)\\nThis is probably one of the best Tonkotsu Ramen I have had in Atlanta. Yes, I would prefer the egg to be onsen tamago but as the menu clearly stated it would be boiled egg so I can't complain about that. The portion was humongous!! Why would I listen to my friend's suggestion to order the \\"Powerful\\" Tonkotsu Ramen when he was like twice my size? I should have stick to the Premium Tonkotsu Ramen ($9.95) which would be the best portion for me. They nailed the noodle part (which to me is just as important), the broth was savory and the pieces of pork chashu were so tender and tasted so heavenly. My award for the Best Tonkotsu Ramen in Atlanta will definitely go to Yebisuya. \\n\\n2nd visit - Chicken Paitan Ramen($9.95)\\nThe menu reads: \\"Thick noodle in creamy chicken soup, chicken chashu, scallion, menma, fresh young spinach & boiled egg\\". I was feeling a little, or ok a lot, adventurous today. I don't deviate from the usual and hence I am rather a predictable person in general. As my stylist said to me in recent time, I need to live a little and have some fun. Oh well, I know she meant wearing more color, but I can try to channel that to other aspects like ordering something very different for lunch from the menu?? ;)\\n\\nThe soup was flavorful and the noodles were cooked to the perfect texture. The chicken chashu were really chicken meat pieces. I suddenly missed my pork chashu :( Don't get me wrong, the chicken pieces were really good but it is like I bought a pair of cute sandals from a brand I don't own, after buying and wearing them on my way to the park, I suddenly miss the comfort of my Ferragamo. The portion of the ramen was more than generous. I could not finish all my noodles. I was so full by then.\\n\\nSERVICE 5/5\\n\\nI saw familiar faces among the staffs. Some of them were Japanese staffs also working at Shoya next door. So I know the service would be great and they were indeed excellent during both my visits. \\n\\nSo this is almost a perfect 5 Stars review from me to Yebisuya :D"}]`),E={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:z},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:6,poemsData:O,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.poemsData.filter(s=>{const e=this.searchQuery.toLowerCase();return s.name.toLowerCase().includes(e)||s.city.toLowerCase().includes(e)||s.text.toLowerCase().includes(e)}).slice(0,this.visibleCount):this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(s=>setTimeout(s,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},R={class:"search-container"},N={class:"card-container"},H=["disabled"],D={key:0},j={key:1};function G(s,e,n,f,i,r){const u=p("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"üéâ Restaurant Reviews ü•≥")])],-1)),t("div",R,[e[2]||(e[2]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"üîç",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=h=>i.searchQuery=h),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[v,i.searchQuery]])]),t("div",N,[(a(!0),o(y,null,m(r.filteredPoems,(h,g)=>(a(),k(u,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),r.hasMorePoems?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:i.isLoading,onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=(...h)=>r.loadMore&&r.loadMore(...h))},[i.isLoading?(a(),o("span",j,"Loading...")):(a(),o("span",D,"See more"))],8,H)):w("",!0)])}const F=c(E,[["render",G],["__scopeId","data-v-2b19a1a3"]]),V=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotesmag/38.md","filePath":"quotesmag/38.md"}'),L={name:"quotesmag/38.md"},J=Object.assign(L,{setup(s){return(e,n)=>(a(),o("div",null,[I(F)]))}});export{V as __pageData,J as default};
