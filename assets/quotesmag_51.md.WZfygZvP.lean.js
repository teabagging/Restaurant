The dining area looks kind of sad, just no really ambience, but the bar area is cool. What was very disapointing was that they ran out of everything. My husband asked for a Club Colombia (Colombian beer), they didn't have it, then he asked for an Aguila (another colombian beer) which they didn't have either, waitress said they ran out. These were NOT on the menu, but my husband just assumed that since it was a Colombian restaurant then they would have Colombian beer, but they didnt. Then my brother in law asked for a Blue Moon (which was on the menu) and they didn't have it, I asked for a half aguardiente bottle for the table (which was on the menu) and they didn't have it either (they did have the full bottle, but we just wanted half).

I ordered a Tilapia, and it was very good, my brother in law ordered chicken and mushrooms and it was also very good, and my hubby ordered a Churrasco which was ok. The food presentation is not the greatest, it looks sad, but the food is actually good. We were done at 10 pm, and the place probably had just 5 more people than when we arrived. We decided to leave as we just wanted to drink aguardiente and dance, but there wasn't much people and they didnt have half bottle of aguardiente. I would come back another day to try this place later at night to see if it actually is fun."},{"name":"Santorini Cafe","address":"11800 N Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Love this place and the family that owns it!

The falafel tasted freshly made, It came with lettuce, tomato, cucumber, some sort of pickles, with a tahini sauce. I have to tell that the pickles made this sandwich! It was so very good!  This is one of the better falafel sandwiches that I have had! The hummus and salad were good too. One other thing that I really like that makes them a little different from other similar restaurants is that they actually use green pickled olives instead of black or kalamata, which are my favorite! \\n\\nBased on the customer service and the food, this place will definitely be on my list of places to eat at regularly!

Throwing an egg on top might have elevated the noodles a little (hint to management). \\n\\nFor dessert, we had the mango mochi, takoyaki, and mango pudding. I know (oink oink). I couldn't resist the mochi. There were 3 to an order ($4) and the pieces were a decent size. Creamy mango center, not too sweet, and soft outer rice shell. Just perfect. I had to order the takoyaki out of curiosity and because it was just so cute. Red bean stuffed fish pancake. The pancake itself was a thin layer of slightly crispy dough that was filled with a on with a sweet red bean paste and then flash fried. Quite delicious IMO.

Fortunately, I don't have any complaints to report; the food and service at Alfredo's is excellent.\\n\\nFood: There are a few northern Italian influenced items on the menu at Alfredo's, but for the most part they specialize in traditional central and southern (i.e. \\"red sauce\\") Italian cuisine. Prior to ordering, they also serve complimentary pickled vegetables and bread, the latter of which was essentially thick sliced wonder bread, toasted, and completely saturated with God's true gift to mankind: butter. After devouring at least a loaf of the bread each, my dining partner and I finally had to cut each other off for fear of inducing a myocardial infarction. For appetizers, we opted for the fried mozzarella and calamari, both of which were well flavored and appropriately portioned. For an entree, I opted for the raviolini pomodoro, which were filled with goat cheese and accompanied by chopped artichokes and tomatoes the size of a fetus. It was also littered with garlic and basil; I say littered because the dish was actually seasoned so heavy  that the flavor remained in my oral cavity  after multiple brushings and at least 12 hours. This isn't a complaint though; the dish was incredibly well executed and the littering was a welcomed kick.\\n\\nService: The servers here are older and well-seasoned, which translates into knowledgeable and efficient; our waiter, George, was friendly and more than eager to please. \\n\\nAtmosphere: The atmosphere is really the only thing I take issue with at Alfredo's. I realize the intent is to maintain the old school Italian feel, but the establishment is incredibly run down and borderline condemnable; there were actually multiple pieces of thick packing tape holding together the wood paneling on the side of the booth we were sitting in. It's also incredibly dark, to the point where George actually had to take out a flash light to assist me with the ordering process; the experience was certainly a humbling one, but at least 50 years premature. I imagine most of the older patrons must already be familiar with the menu or just shout out random Italian dishes until the waiter confirms that it's actually on the menu.\\n\\nCost: Moderately priced. Most appetizers are between $6 and $9, while entrees are between $14 and $24. All pastas can also be ordered as side dishes for a lower price.\\n\\nOther: Unless you dine before 6:30 PM, expect a wait, regardless of the day or whether you have a reservation. They do have a full service bar though and a reasonable selection of inexpensive Italian wine varietals to help pass the time."},{"name":"Oppa Sushi","address":"185 Harvard Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"I've been on a search for a good sushi place in boston.

The pork chop was edible, but the fried rice was coated with black stuff probably from the wok.  The red bean pancake was soaked in oil which made it soggy not crisp.

Great service by an attentive waitress. Problem with this sort of menu is that many of dishes are fairly small, so sharing with 4 just gives you a bite, and nothing feels substantial. Menu lacked any type of \\"heavier\\" tapas dishes I've had elsewhere that round out a menu and leave you more satisfied at end of meal (examples: lamb sliders, pulled pork and waffles, short rib tacos, stuffed shrimp). Many of the dishes were very spicy or had some very spicy notes, like a lot of chili oil, to the point that we regretfully started asking for things that were blander.  \\n\\nAte: Hamachi sashimi (5 pieces), the  favorite of the night: just the right amount of crunch, spice, smoothness from fish and cool down from creme fraiche. Octopus was good, but kimchi and pickled raisins added a lot of spice. Liked the cauliflower with tahini and cumin; the unusual chinese sausage dish with \\"rice cakes\\"  (but pieces  of sausage are dime-like and dish has both spicy garlic and chives). Loved the kale, which is fried in tempura batter, but it sat in a pool of salty fish sauce. Some of us liked the chicken ramen with hard boiled egg. A very good grain salad with XO sauce (but again, barely a spoonful each). Chicken lollipops with srichas mayonaisse nothing special. \\n\\nAll in all, interesting menu, fun concept, but too heavy a spice hand and not enough substantial food if really sharing everything."},{"name":"Hooters","address":"5300 Kirkman Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"2.5","text":"This hooters was completely dead when  i went and it was a huge hooters.  i went in for lunch on a Friday and the wings were OK.

I ordered the cornbread fried catfish macaroni cheese and broccoli rice casserole. The cornbread was great it came with honey on the side and it was very rich and tasty. My cat fish was fried perfectly the only complaint I had was that the restaurant did not have any tartar sauce they only had hot sauce to go with it which was very disappointing.

We tried the soft pretzels ($6), which were street vendor sized, well salted and came with grainy mustard and a tallegio-porter fondue for dunking. The warm pretzels were tasty enough, but not very soft. The mustard was a fair accompaniment but the fondue should have made the dish. It fell short because it was a thin and runny... not rich or as flavorful as it sounds. \\n\\nThe Tomato Tart ($12) was much better, with a flaky pie crust and a solid, satisfying blue cheese filling, The tart was covered with wedges of warm tomatoes and drizzled with a balsamic-caramel reduction that tied the dish together. A small salad of greens and almonds shared the plate with the tart, but were flat tasting and unnecessary. Perhaps if the salad were dressed with some balsamic-caramel reduction, it might have added something to the dish. \\n\\nA wonderfully smoked lamb merguez sausage ($9) arrived in what might have been a perfect accompaniment of cumin flavored yogurt. The dish was too busy, however, with the addition of heirloom carrots, raisin salad & mustard seeds to the yogurt sauce. I love a good salad, but there were too many distractions to the centerpiece of this dish, which was the full flavored sausage. \\n\\nPork Tortellini in a pozole broth ($11), inspired by the Mexican pork and hominy stew, was surprisingly bland although the pork filling in the pasta was tasty enough. \\n\\nPastrami-Spiced Veal Cheeks ($26) were excellent, delicately prepared and sweetened with radicchio-red onion agrodolce (the chef's take on a traditional sweet and sour sauce found in Italian cuisine). It was served on farro cooked in a risotto style, however, which was - you guessed it - bland and uninspired. \\n\\nThe wine list is pretty international, with roughly 90 selections, about two-thirds of which are available by the glass. Prices range from the low $30's to over $300 and are fairly marked at about 2 x retail. \\n\\nThis IS a gastro-pub, so there must be beer...and there is! Eight beers on tap and three in bottle come from small American breweries. \\n\\nThe Ravenous Pig is certainly worth a try if you are in the downtown Orlando/Winter Park area.

From the slow service, unclean facilities, and packed crowd. I'm not sure why we even gave this place a chance. Maybe because of the rumbling stomachs between my guy and me. When we stood to put our name on the waiting list. There was a gentleman complaining that he had been waiting for his to-go order for way too long. We should have heeded warning then. We arrived at this location at 7:20 pm. We were sat around 7:45pm. Granted it was Easter, so the place was packed. But by time we were sat, most of that Easter crowd had diminished. We placed an order for appetizers, which came out pretty quick. I guess it doesn't take long to pop those in the microwave and get out. That was 8:00pm. By 9:00pm we still hadn't received our main entrees. I would have blamed the Easter crowd if everyone who arrived after us was waiting as well. But I noticed multiple other parties who arrived at the same time, or after us, receive their food pay the check and leave. Meanwhile we were STILL waiting just to get our food. I believe the bar area was highly under staffed. I could see our waiter helping multiple tables, including a party. I guess because of this, he started to get frustrated. In the beginning he was nice. While ordering our food, and when we asked to just cancel our order. He had such an attitude. After we waited til 9:15pm we just cancelled our order.

The server was super nice and friendly and was attentive to our needs. They did set a hot plate of pizza in front of a toddler which I frowned upon but I quickly moved and no one got burned. Pizza was ordered with appetizer but came out with our meals which maybe it took that long to cook but was pretty ordered so would be cooled and toddler could start eating before we got our food but didn't play out that way.

Cool to see them move into a retail space. \\n\\nTake this review with a grain of salt, I'm not familiar with Georgian cuisine at all...so I'm just coming at this from a dude who likes food perspective. \\n\\nFirst, come with friends, and split everything. I made the mistake of ordering for myself, getting the Khachapuri and Beef/Pork dumplings. My lunch bill came to be around $28, that's with tip and no alcohol. In my opinion, it's pricey for what you actually get. $8 for 3 dumplings seems like a stretch to me. Ordering for one person, you almost can't help but order this much food, since either of their 2 main dishes (dumplings or stuffed bread) would be just too one dimensional. They really should have an option where you can either get a dumping sampler...or get 1 dumpling on the side when you order a stuffed bread. \\n\\nAnyway, somewhat glad and regretful ordering two main dishes. I found the beef/pork dumplings really bland. Almost tasted a bit gamey for some reason. There's no way I could've eaten 3 of the same dumpling. Even leaving the stem uneaten, it was just too one dimensional and doughy. I had a bite of my friend's potato dumpling, much more flavor. \\n\\nThe stuffed bread was ok, but by then, the whole meal just felt very carb heavy. Perhaps it's my bad ordering, maybe I should've opted for a salad. I do advise getting the side condiments though (which IMO they should really just include as part of the mains, versus making you order them separately). The reason is those condiments really helps break up the monotony of the flavor profiles of both the dumplings and the breads. Honestly, it'd be pretty lackluster without them. \\n\\nOverall, I can't fault this place too much cause maybe that's exactly what Georgian cuisine is. Personally, probably not much of a repeat spot for me."},{"name":"Miel Brasserie","address":"510 Atlantic Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"High class, high price, high quality.

Any place that has signature cocktails with names like \\"teenage rampage\\" and \\"John Lennon\\" is good in my book. \\n\\nThere are about 24 rotating beers on tap, mostly predictable but good (like Ninkasi, Deschutes, and Lagunitas). And if you meander in for Happy Hour (from 4pm-7pm every day!), you can get $1 off cocktails and $0.50 off draft beer. I was stoked to see they carry sugarfree RedBull and Tazo tea, for those of us who need a five minute break from booze.\\n\\nThe food menu is diverse and supports local business: they use Cascade for their beef, Draper Valley for their chicken, and Grand central for their bread. And the food is yummy. They've options you wouldn't usually find on a bar menu, like shepherd's pie and pasties (which are both available meatie and vegetarian). Nothing is super cheap, but nor will it bust your budget.\\n\\nThe portions on the fries are huge. And since it was $5 for regular fries, I decided to up the ante and try the Disco Fries for $7. It's a huge gooey messy sinful platter of fries, mushroom gravy, and cheese. We weren't given a fork, so I dared my partner in crime to actually pour the sloppy remnants of french fry goo into his mouth.

I barely made it out the door.\\n\\nI like coming to East End as a local music venue. The place is kind of bi-polar. Upstairs, you have a slim row of booths with a mini-bar, one bartender, a complimentary old school photo booth, and a sound system that generally plays artists such as the Velvet Underground. \\n\\nBut down the wide staircase in the middle of the upstairs entrance, you'll find a whole new slightly-more-punky world. There are some dimly-lit tables surrounded by fork art. And off to the side is another bar, a bit darker and grungier, where you can catch some surprisingly good local music acts. $5 (or free if you're lucky) for four local bands isn't a bad deal. But bring ear plugs. The sound folks tend to go a wee bit crazy with the amps on these gigs. Also, don't be surprised if you have to stand at a show: seats are limited.\\n\\nP.S.

However, a few items are pretty distinctly Taiwanese and not what you'd find at ye olde typical Chinatown bakery. Most notably the small pineapple shortcake. I'm used to these being little squares, and at Yi Soon they're round, but the filling is the same. A delicious, thick, rich, sweet pineapple paste. Get these. Get lots of these.\\n\\nAll the items are delicious, though, regardless of their level of authenticity. I enjoy the mini croissant rolls (comes in a package and is very reminiscent of home), the big custard-filled buns (so light and moist) and the cakes (feel free to be shallow and choose by color because they're all good). Now if they could bring in, say, Taiwanese cheesecake like the award-winning kind I had in downtown Taipei, I'd break the Yelp rating meter and force it to give 10 stars."},{"name":"Thunder Falls Terrace","address":"6000 Universal Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"We had a late lunch here two days ago.

Fried potatoes / spicy tomato / allioli: perfectly fried and crunchy and lots of flavor...best potato bravas ive had...staple tapas dish...\\n-Braised oxtail / red wine sauce: nothing to go too crazy over... i've had better\\n-Perdiz al ajillo. Quail in garlic sauce: good quail but nothing too unique \\n-Paella Barlata- a couple of big shrimp which were excellent but the chicken chorizo was forgetable. this dish came out last and the waiter didnt seem to know what dishes we were waiting for and asked 2-3 times if we were waiting for anything else. Wasn't too impressed with this paella...rice wasn't crunchy on the bottom...was al dente.. just seemed ok\\n\\nPretty pricey place.

We did this and literally everyone kept walking by us. We had to flag down people who said that they would be right back to help, but of course they never came back. It seemed like they didn't have enough staff to service everyone. It was a really young staff and that may be partially the issue. We finally caught someone who said that we needed to order food with our drinks so that we could get our drinks quicker... LIES!!!!

On top of that, the food did take awhile to come. \\n\\nThe fish and chips itself were okay, I felt that the fries were really dry and that the fish was oily but tasted pretty decent on the overall.

The sushi here is bad. The size of the sashimi are paper thin. We arrived during their so-called \\"lunch hour\\" gap between 11:30-2:30 and checked out with our check a little after 1pm. This place is a scam. They entice you to order a $2.25 soda or drink per person so that you can have any plate on the conveyor belt for $1.50 each. Alright fine, but as we were there, the very basics of sashimi was far and few in between. I practically saw the belt of the conveyor more than the food.\\n\\nThere were even signs telling us to be conscious of how much wasabi we want if pulling it off the conveyor belt to refill our dipping dish!! We sat down and were served with less than a dime size of watered down wasabi, a tiny piece of ginger and two edamame. This restaurant forces you to order something from the chef and in result charges you more than $1.50 because it wasn't on the conveyor. Who is to say that what we ordered wasn't on the conveyor when there is the \\"lunch rush.\\" If this restaurant wants more business and states the open hours of when they serve sushi, the selection needs to be available. All we saw on the conveyor were oranges, salad, maybe a couple plates of salmon sashimi, tiny 4 piece mediocre rolls and cheesecake. What is that all about? In other words if you order tuna, yellowtail, mackerel, etc then they double the price because it's not on the conveyor. BEWARE!\\n\\nThe waitress tells me that they are a small business and we came too late and the lunch rush is over. They don't want to waste food. Well, I feel that if the business is not ready to pour out the money for serving customers at the opened times as stated and not letting them stare at the conveyor with limited variety then things need to be re-analyzed by the owner.\\n\\nWe have had better sushi.

Each experience is worse than the last. Today, we were lied to by two separate employees. When we arrived, the hostess sat us at an awkwardly placed table, one chair short of what we needed. We asked to sit at a different table, to which she told us someone was already sitting there. So we grabbed an additional chair from another table, because her walking away was a clear indicator she wouldn't be doing it. Then we looked up just in time to see her sit the people that came in after us at the table we requested.\\nTwo of the four sets of silverware we were given were dirty. Then, at the end of our meal, my husband asked for a to go cup for his drink, to which the waitress stated she wasn't allowed to do that. Funny, since they were allowed to do that a couple weeks ago. When pressed, she fumbled and said they had no lids, then she blamed her manager. Then she scurried away.\\nBut shout out to the grill masters. Every time we go here, they are phenomenal.

I went here Monday night with 3 of my friends and it was one of the worst experiences I've had. To start the night, my boyfriend and I arrived earlier and went to get a drink at the bar while we waited for our friends. The bar was decently packed which is always a good sign, but clearly is not the case in this situation. We found two seats and waited 7 minutes for the bartender to even acknowledge us, mind you she made eye contact multiple times but just quickly looked away and continued to slowly take care of the rest of the guests. In fact, the only thing she did quickly was actively look away and ignore patrons that clearly needed things. I'm in the industry myself, 7 minutes for someone to say \\"I'll be with you in just a minute\\" is far too long. We then went to get our names put on the list for bowling which understandably had a long wait as it was a holiday and schools were out so we decided to play games while we waited. My boyfriend and I each got a 10 dollar card for the game room and every game we tried was broken. Either the games didn't count your points, items were missing, or they simply weren't functioning correctly. At this point we decided ok, let's try laser tag. We get our time ticket and go to the bathroom while we wait. We come back 5 minutes late (completely our fault) and stand in line. I'm not upset with the fact that we were told to get new times, I'm upset at the fact that multiple employees walked right past us without acknowledging us and two actively ignored me when I said \\"hi, excuse me\\" to try and see if we were wasting our time by standing in line. We give up, and go back to the bar. Another long wait but by now we expect that. We finally get our bowling lane. Bowling was fun enough even though the bumpers randomly came down 4 frames in and no one could be found to help us fix the situation, but whatever it's not like we're amazing bowlers and the bumpers started a whole new game of who could use them to their advantage best. You have an hour for the lane and it took our server 28 minutes before we even saw her. She went to the lanes ahead of us before coming to us, even though I had stopped her as she walked past and asked if she was our server and her response was \\"yeah, I will be\\" and she walked away visibly annoyed that I had questioned her. We ordered beers and food which didn't come out until we had less than 10 minutes left on the lane. When we went to find a manager we were first told to stand in line and then when we made it clear that this was a complaint and we needed to speak to someone about it we finally had a manager walk away from joking around with his employees to discuss our issues. While the manager was helpful once we finally talked to him, it was far too difficult to find him. The server seemed very flustered but was apologetic which I understand we all have bad nights, but they clearly gave this girl way too much to handle and it ruined the nights of multiple parties as the group beside us actually walked out after complaining amongst themselves for quite a while.

Mother's Day we had reservations at 6, and it was uncomfortably hot inside. The huge rush was over, but we still waited awhile for our food. It was so warm inside we used the menus to fan ourselves. \\nThe food was great in Newark. It was just OK on Mother's Day. I had pulled pork platter with baked beans and Cole slaw. The baked beans seemed a bit spicier in Newark, in fact that's why I got them again. \\nI returned to this location last night with hubs for his first time. Reservations for after 8 but we showed up early. Plenty of empty tables but we had to wait so we sat at the bar and ate. Again, it was not cool in there. I do not enjoy eating a heavy meal when it's hot. Usually in restaurants I take a light sweater. You'll never need one here!\\nThis time I got the brisket platter, Baked beans and sweet potato fries. Sadly, the fries were the best part. The brisket slices were very narrow, and a good portion of fat. After cutting off all the fat the meat part was very fatty and not much flavor. I had to spit out (sorry, I know, it's gross) so much and when added to what I cut off, I had a pile of fat on my plate that would have filled my hand. My husband gave me a slice of his, because I really didn't have much meat. \\nAfter that much meat carving, the paper liner was getting mixed up with the food. Not good eating paper. \\nThe beans had so many chunks of brisket in them there weren't many beans. Usually you'd think that'd be a treat but that brisket was fatty too. \\nHusbands platter was $30, which was a high price point for what he got. He enjoyed the Mac n cheese but thought the brisket was fatty and tasteless, the pulled pork was dry, and the ribs were so-so. \\nTruthfully, we could have eaten down the street at City BBQ for half the price, much less noise, and much better food.  \\nYou know, if the food was great, I could dress accordingly and not go on a hot day, but as it is, there are too many other great places to eat. \\nI don't think we'll be back."},{"name":"Maudie‚Äôs Hacienda","address":"9911 Brodie Ln, Ste 900","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Maudies graciously says they hope I'll give them another chance.

Grits is a kind of a porridge made of coarsely ground corn.  Having spent 10 days in N'Orleans during Mardi Gras I've had grits that tastes like cardboard, runny baby food grits and grits so thick that I'm thinking plaster of Paris. Chewies' grits has the same texture and taste as mashed potatoes and it's just as addictive and they give you a hefty amount of it.\\n\\nAnd last, but not least, when Miss Cathy saw buttermilk biscuits on the menu, she knew her breakfast wouldn't be complete without them.

We had an extensive and kind of annoying conversation with our waiter about what we wanted in the margaritas---he insisted that a top shelf marg includes orange juice, which most of our group don't think is the case.

The horchata cocktail was milkshake-esque and very strong, and quite sweet.\\n\\nIf you're a mexican food fan, be warned that this is definitely not your typical mexican food. The menu was hard to decipher. Once we translated it out of hipster, it included the usual tacos, tacitos, tortas, tostadas, etc,  but the food didn't translate well for us---it seemed fussy and overthought. They say it is Oaxacan, but when I've been in Oaxaca I did not have food like this. \\n\\nWe ordered the quesadilla, chicken mole, octopus tostada, and goat. The octopus was extremely salty and heavily citrus flavored---we did not finish it. The mole was so disappointing---a very small portion, with a stingy helping of a pumpkin seed verde-style mole sauce (I confess to preferring the complex chocolate and chili notes of negro and coloradito to verde styles) and a kind of rolled chicken breast, served with warm corn tortillas. Everybody at our table had one small bite and the rest was uneaten. The quesadilla has fried hibiscus flowers inside it---but the lovely subtle taste effect of a fried blossom was overwhelmed by the melted cheese soaking oil into it. I ate it---you kinda can't go wrong with cheese and a tortilla---but the concept seemed flawed. The goat was very good, with little bowls of various sauces, but a very small portion for $32. Call me crazy, but I kind of expect to get enough when I spend that. Yes I eat tapas and I don't mind spending money, but even to me, coming from Boston and San Francisco, it seemed overpriced.  \\n\\nAll in all,  none of us were swept away, as many of the reviewers here seem to be.

It cost about $35 now, use to be $25 when I first began coming here, but its is a mixture of crab legs, shrimp, corn, potatoes and sausage links.  The $35 combo will feed two people, but lately I've taken to ordering extra crab legs clusters, because it seems as if you don't get as many as you use to.  The one person version of this combo is $18.  It comes with one crab leg cluster, about six shrimp, corn, potatoes and a sausage. \\n\\nOnce before I asked for the shrimp to be peeled and what I got were these tiny shrunk shrimp. No way do I think they were the same shrimp that normally come with the meal, so I will stick to peeling them myself, because they come out three times the size as the peeled shrimp I received. \\n\\nGenerally, the staff is friendly, but my time with them usually consist of placing my order over the phone, swiping my debit card upon arrival and turning around and walking back out the door.  I've never seen the place packed or even more than 2 people either waiting on food or placing an order, so I take that to mean that the south-side of the city does not know what they are missing with Smackin Good Seafood.   I can't recall if there are tables there to eat in.  In my mind, I only see the chair for waiting not eating. \\n\\nSince I began coming here, they've had a sign up that says they will begin taking EBT cards, not sure how that will work since you can't buy cooked foods with an EBT card, but maybe they plan to begin selling fresh seafood that you can take home and cook yourself.

The main issue with Sweetgreen is that their biggest salad hardly counts as an actual meal at 695 calories, yet it costs $11. It amazes me how many people go in and pay $11-12 for their 450-500 calorie salads and get no add ones. They must be starving in 2-3 hours. Lol The harvest bowl is probably the only salad somewhat worth the money at $10.95 and 695 calories.\\n\\nThe ingredient options are good and fresh, but the portions are on the small side.  Also, the amount you get for each ingredient varies across the employees. Employees will generally give you extra on lower cost items (apples, sweet potatoes, cilantro, etc.) without charging you, but it can vary by employee. Be careful adding or doubling ingredients as some are quite expensive (mushrooms and chickens). You can quickly end up with a $16-18 salad\\n\\nNote that their prices have bee going up as well. Sweetgreen is an ok place at $10-12 and if not overly hungry.

This place had more specials than menu entrees. They always have very unique food offerings that make choosing difficult. I chose the Tasmanian Tenderloin special which came with a generous beef tenderloin served with lobster and crab on top over some great potatos and fresh asparagus. In a word...incredible. My brother in law had another special...the lamb. 6 lamb pieces served 3 different ways and sides of veggies and potatos. Now being French, he is hard to please but he devoured this meal in utter silence until he had finished. Then granted his tasteful approval. My daughter and niece split a different tenderloin option that left nothing but empty plates.

The sandwich was good and had fresh ingredients, but I feel like I just paid 9 bucks for an untoasted simple sandwich on plain brown bread and a bunch of crappy service. It should really be advertised if there are no crepes at a crepe place from 11 to 3 (if that's even the time). I *might* go back because I love crepes and breakfast sandwiches and work close by, but if the service is this bad it will be the last time."},{"name":"Castagna Restaurant","address":"1752 SE Hawthorne Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Every year for my birthday, I go out to a different restaurant with my family.

We started off with hot and sour soup and it was pretty good. Lots of spices inside which made the soup flavorful. The shanghai fried noodles were good, but not as good as DTFs. The noodles are less al dente here but it's still serviceable. The stir fried shredded pork bean curd and chili pepper was pretty good! There was a ton of pork which I thought was delicious! I thought the wontons in the sour chili sauce was decent. The amount of wontons were plentiful but the sauce was sub par. \\n\\nAll other entrees and appetizers aside, what I really came here for was for the dumplings. I was really impressed with the xiao long bao here (steamed pork soup dumplings). The amount of soup inside each dumpling was crazy (so much soup inside the dumpling)!! This is the definition of a \\"soup\\" dumpling if you ask me. Although they serve you less XLB in one order here than DTF, I really enjoyed the smaller quantity and plentiful soup inside the dumplings. However, I don't recommend the shrimp and pork shao mai though. The presentation was lackluster with shaomais falling all over the place and the shrimp seemed under cooked. \\n\\nIf I'm in Vancouver and I'm in the mood for some XLB, I wouldn't hesitate to go to Dinesty. The prices are affordable and not nearly as expensive as DTF in the states.

I almost swore off going to Japanese restaurants for ramen...until I heard that Yebisuya was coming to Doraville! \\n\\nYebisuya Ramen is located off of Peachtree Road, right next to Shoya Izakaya, Kula Revolving Sushi Bar, and H Mart. Seriously, this plaza will be my new home away from home. It's got everything (by everything, I mean food). Parking is ample, as this is a huge plaza, but depending on when you go, you might not get the closest parking spot to the restaurant. We came by, not sure if it would be open or not yet. We sat in the car, trying to see through the restaurant's tinted windows for signs of life...and then a group of very satisfied-looking men came out of the restaurant, all carrying little sake bottles. That was our signal. We bolted out of the car and entered the restaurant and were immediately greeted by the kitchen staff and servers. \\n\\nService is on point. I wasn't expecting too much, since I know new restaurants sometimes take some time to get into the flow of things and work out their kinks. Yebisuya wasted no time. We were greeted by our server, and two other servers came by to greet us and make sure we were already helped. Everyone was friendly, asked if we had any questions. The menu has a great variety of Japanese food. They've got your typical appetizers - gyoza, takoyaki, karaage, etc...all the ramen you could want (miso ramen, shoyu, tonkotsu, chicken, vegetable, the list goes on), okonomiyaki, fried rice, curry, katsu don, chashu don, yakisoba, and so much more. And guess what? If you don't know what any of that is, there are pictures in the menu. AND in the front of the restaurant in the display window, there's food (fake of course) on display, which gives you an idea of the portion size and exactly what each dish is. I can't say enough about the atmosphere. It almost felt like I was back in Japan. \\n\\nWe decided to play it safe with food, since it was just lunch time and two of us. We got the signature miso ramen and the tonkotsu miso ramen. To me, it's hard for a restaurant to go wrong with shoyu ramen and the others. It's all about the miso ramen for me. Again, Yebisuya did not disappoint. Food was out in much less than 10 minutes, steaming hot, smelling wonderful, and looking great. For less than $11 for my bowl of miso ramen, I was already full halfway through, but there was no way I was letting any of it go to waste. As if it couldn't get any better, the final icing on the cake was when the hostess presented us with the cutest mini sake bottles on our way out.\\n\\nWhat more can I say about Yebisuya? Try it out. Decide for yourself. As for me, I'm trying to decide if I should come back for dinner to try out the rest of their menu. I'm super excited to see how well this business does."},{"name":"Banzai Sushi & Grill","address":"3914 N Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"This place has been a regular at  for my family for forever.  It's just a couple blocks away from my house any my school, and an overall convinient location for  anyone who lives in the Rosedale area or works around seton or medical parkway. Here's the deal: the food is okay. IAveraged out. It's kind of win or lose, and on a scale of gas station sushi yo uchiko I would say the sushi is usually at a 5-7 out of ten. Okay so my favorites are the veggie sushi howl, philly roll, and Gyoza. The Gyoza are served with a sort if ponzu-ish tangy soy sauce that I often find myself craving.  Of course, they never give you enough sauce for anything, and tend to charge extra for unreasonable things like extra dressing. I hate to say this, but sometimes, you can leave feeling a little cheeped out. Expect small to medium sized portions? Things to avoid: chicken terriaki is kind of chewy and the beef quality tends to not be very good, although by no means dangerous. I like the mango bubble tea or mochi but just know that it's bubble tea smoothie, not bubble tea, so it's kind of a smoothie slushy thing, but still pretty excellent if you're in the mood."},{"name":"The Ravenous Pig","address":"565 W Fairbanks Ave","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4","text":"This was my second visit to The Ravenous Pig and it did not disappoint in the least.

Their breakfast platters are pretty good, as are their baked goods and gelato. Their sandwiches and bread? Not so much.\\n\\nFood aside, the reason I come here is the atmosphere. Plenty of tables, plenty of space, plus free wi-fi.  I bring a book, or some work, and and it's really pleasant. I've seen a lot of others bring table-top games as well -- and lots of students doing homework. \\n\\nSure, I could go to Epoch or the Starbucks down the street or any other coffee shop in town and fight for a table. But I like knowing I can come  here to relax and get some work done while eating breakfast.\\n\\nAnd it's also nice not being surrounded by hipsters and college kids for once. This place is pretty varied, as far as ages go -- older folks from the neighborhood, grad students, and families with kids.\\n\\nPeople are freaking out about supposed \\"language barriers.\\" Like I said, I'm here every week, and I know like five words of Spanish.

We were looking for a dog friendly place to have dinner after a fun day of fall festivities. When we arrived, the hostess was incredibly slow, with a line of people out the door waiting to give their names. She continuously left for minutes on end. After waiting in line for ten minutes just to give our name we were told we would have to wait to be seated until another party left. That was fine..... she didn't give us any time frame though which was weird. Thirty minutes later when a group finally left, their table sat unbussed for at least ten minutes while we sat waiting to be seated. Finally we caught the hostesses eye and she realized that people were waiting for the table. She took a few dishes away from the table and disappeared again for several minutes. Then she took a few more dishes away and finally told us we could go sit down. After another five minutes she arrived and wiped the dirty table down for us. When our waitress arrived, she was nice, but super meek and she also was very slow. When we told her we were ready to order, she immediately said, \\" oh I need to go get a new pen. This one doesn't work\\". Instead of going and getting a new pen, she left for at least five minutes and we saw her come back and forth twice with food she was serving to another table. When she finally returned and we were able to order, we were extremely concerned that the food might take forever to get to us, but luckily it arrived relatively quickly. Something that was interesting, was that when the waitress delivered my daughters meals, she gave them to the wrong kid and when they switched their plates, the waitress asked them if they had moved seats...... no, they didn't move seats, you gave the wrong plate to the wrong person..... duh. Anyway the food was actually quite good which was what allowed me to give two stars. At the end of our meal, we sat for at least ten minutes waiting for the check while other patrons waited for our table. When we gave our form of payment to the waitress we waited another ten minutes for her to make change. Because the staff are incredibly inefficient, unconcerned with waiting customers, lackadaisical, and unprofessional I couldn't give more than two stars. The Hostess spent much of the Time we were in the restaurant chatting with her friend in a corner while two tables sat empty, unbussed, and customers waited for way too long(some of them were waiting outside in the cold). If I owned this restaurant and my staff wasn't seating customers efficiently, I would be extremely angry.  Customers were waiting around an hour when there were tables available! That is not okay!

I was at Five Horses Tavern on an extremely cold and bitter day and there were no cold drafts coming inside the restaurant from the cold outside air.  Not sure why more restaurants do not do this...\\n\\n-6).

We expected full service because the Comet ain't cheap, but sadly, that didn't happen.     \\n\\n We had a company party (20 ppl)  at the Comet, and we had booked this about a month in advance.  It was frustrating right from the beginning.     We had everything from computer problems for score keeping to probably the worst service we've ever experienced.  Two of the 4 lanes completely malfunctioned and were completely useless.  The employees made no attempts to make it right, and so we were down to two lanes, and they didn't even refund us.   Unbelievable.   Also,  our server completely checked out and the other staff were unprepared for our party.      One would think they would staff this place to cover parties like ours-- heck we even booked this event a month in advance!   It's not like 20 of us showed up out of the blue.     We had ordered the full party package, and the food came out out an hour late.   And then you had the bar/drinks.  Our server would disappear  and then forget our orders.    We ordered drinks that never arrived, and when some of them  did,  it took 20-30 minutes.   The bartender  was too busy playing on his phone to care. That was the frustrating thing, they weren't even busy!     The service was absolutely was pathetic, indifferent, unapologetic and downright lazy.    I really wanted to like this place, and I hope things will improve, but I can honestly say, i don't think I'll go back. \\n\\n  I have one question for the owners/managers who might read this.      Why on earth would you sink all your money into this business, like buying and renovating this amazing space, and offer such great looking drinks and food and create such a unique setting and not invest in decent employees?   Judging by other yelpers,  this is not an isolated problem.   It's so pretentious-- I cannot recommend the Comet to friends, neighbors or family unless something changes.

Georgian cuisine boasts an intersection of European and nearby Middle Eastern culinary styles.\\n\\nThis little unsuspecting restaurant has blown me away. If heaven on earth exists, I'd like to imagine it involves floating off somewhere in a life-sized Khachapuri boat. Khachapuri is the beautiful open-faced bread boat you've surely seen photos of by now, filled with melted cheese, butter, and a perfectly over-easy egg. You break open the yolk and carefully mix together the ingredients, rip away at the bread and generously dip and enjoy. Personally, I love both the red or green Adjika paste on the side to elevate the flavor experience.\\n\\nI've yet to try their wine, but at a glance, I love the selection and look forward to an opportunity to try a glass or take home a bottle.

From start to finish I was treated like a valuable guest.  They were very attentive and performed all of the functions I expect for superior service.  Dishes were cleared, drinks filled, needs anticipated.  When I first got there I was starving so I ordered edaname while I looked over the menu.  My server gave me plenty of time, a few suggestions and ultimately helped me choose the Bahama Mama roll which was great.  When I needed to take home leftovers they were placed in a container in a bag with a napkin and fresh chop sticks.\\n\\nThe edaname can be either steamed or with spicy garlic flake. The seasoned is not too spicy and I am a wimp.  It was by far the better choice.\\n\\nOn another visit I had the volcano roll.  I have to say either roll could be your whole meal as they are quite large.  I did not like the creamy crab type dip that was in the middle of the volcano roll. It took a clean tasty roll and added a rich crab stuffing that was just too much for me.  \\n\\nI got the Beef Yakiudon Wok stirred Japanese thick noodles with beef to go for my husband and he enjoyed it.  I liked it so I got a small side of yakiudon on my second visit.\\n\\nTip - they have a sushi dinner, Sushi and Sashimi Platter 8 pieces of nigiri, 9 pieces of sashimi, Katana roll for $30.  I saw a couple get this.  She did not like nigiri and sashimi so she ate the Katana roll while her dinner partner enjoyed the rest.  It came out on two plates and is a real deal.\\n\\nThe restaurant is nicely decorated and you can watch the sushi chefs or the two tv's mounted above the sushi bar. \\n\\nIn the back there is a couple of chairs, a coffee table and a small fish tanks.  I saw two guys come in and order beers and sit in this cute little lounge.\\n\\nI ate solo but I was not alone.  I saw two other tables with single female diners.

The valet/bell hoo dude was friendly and professional.\\n\\nCheck In:\\nThe check in process was quick and easy but the line was long.  The check in desk was adequately staffed with six employees.\\n\\nRoom:\\nWe had a room in the 18th floor tower two.  It was nice, crappy view though (we didn't want to pay $20 more for a 'good view').  I believe tower two is for vacation/leisure and tower one for business/conventions etc.  The downside about the hotel room was hearinf fire truck sirens and all of the neighboring doors slamming closed.\\n\\nAmenities:\\nThe only amenity that we used was the swimming pool outside of tower two.  We did not go to the pools near tower one nor did we use the gym or the tennis courts. The resort section of the swimming pool was very nice.  One pool is a zero entry pool with two entries that was the perfect for our children.  There is a water slide, a second deeper pool with fake rocks and a water fall, a kiddie pool, and a hot tub.

All of the dumplings at ColourSeeSee are handmade to order with fresh ingredients. Their menu is extremely limited since they focus on a few select items.\\n\\nSome things to keep in mind if you're thinking about dining here:\\n\\n-¬† If you're looking for quantity, this is not the place for you. The dumpling size in general is smaller than most Shanghainese restaurants. However, the ingredients are high quality and each dumpling is made with care. Because of this, the prices are a bit higher for the amount of food you receive compared to similar restaurants. IMO it's worth it since you're trading quantity for quality, but some people may not agree based on personal preferences.\\n\\n-¬† If you're in a hurry, this is also not the place for you. Every dumpling is handmade to order by one person (the \\"mom\\" in the \\"mom & pop\\"), so there will be a significant wait before you receive your food.\\n\\n-¬† And finally, if you're looking for variety in a Shanghainese restaurant, this is definitely not the place for you. They only specialize in a small assortment of dishes with most of them centered around dumplings.\\n\\nI wonder how they are able to handle a full house since every dumpling was made to order by one person during our visits.

The pool had tons of daily activities for kids including movie night on the lawn, a DJ, arts and crafts...free pool floats..My 3 year old son was in heaven!! Soft serve ice cream parlor and our own private starbucks coffee shop in the lobby..what could be better? The hotel is beautiful and well kept. We also ate dinner at the Boardwalk and were obsessed with the skillet cornbread and lobster roll! It is close to Seaworld, Aquatica, and a short drive to Disney Springs. We watched the Seaworld fireworks from our balcony every night! Only complaint was the shuttles to these parks don't run frequently enough and were running late so we ended up driving and paying to park at Aquatica. Overall, a relaxing a delightful family vacation.

I have a business friend come to town often and he stays in Delaware and loves Tom Hortons too, so we hesitantly go to this location out of convenience.  When we were there for breakfast, I went to the restroom.  As I was in there, a guy was doing his business in the stall (#2 from the smell).  Upon flushing the toilet and walking out of the stall, I noticed he was a Tim Hortons employee.  I expected him to wash because he knew I saw him, but he walked directly out of the bathroom.

This place is amazing. By far the best, authentic Mexican food I've had in a very long time. My first time here and I will definitely be back.\\n\\nFirst, the endless chips and salsa...ohhhhh the salsa. Bought a jar to take home I loved it so much.\\n\\nGuacamole was delicious. A little on the spendy side, but they make it fresh to order ans it's a good sizes portion, easily satisfied 2 people and we had a little leftover to take home.\\n\\nThe entrees....oh. my. goodness. Amazeballs. So many different options to choose from. I really don't think you could go wrong with any of them. The mole sauce is sooooooo good and the pickled veggies were  Very good portion sizes and the prices are affordable for what is served. Weeellll worth the price tag in comparison to other Mexican restaurants in the metro region that charge as much for mediocre food.\\n\\nMargaritas were delicious as well. They have a full bar with a cocktail menu, too.\\n\\nLast, but not least. THE HOUSEMADE CHURROS. They are a MUST. They melt in your mouth and leave happy cinnamon sugar dust on your fingers. I can't describe them anymore. You just have to eat them.\\n\\nThe ambiance is welcoming and the staff are attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable. You can FEEL the love they put into their food.\\n\\nThe restaurant is located in a little, oddly located  shopping center on Barbur Blvd, so little in fact that you may miss it as you drive by. Don't let that deter you from the best Mexican in the area!\\n\\nI waited way too long to eat here and am now kicking myself for all the meals I could have had here to this point. Again, GO.

Going with kids is challenging and the food is OK, no where near the best or great, rather OK. You need to order all food and drinks inside and potentially leave your kids outside at the playscape solo that is not completely fenced in.  In fact it is open for them to run onto 2222. If you want a refill you need to again go inside and get it yourself and leave the kids solo. OR you can round up everyone from the playscape yelling and bring them inside to get a refill of whatever...wine, beer, water...etc... With everything self service and trying to manage kids at the same time it was not a very pleasurable experience at all. Lastly, I personally do not drink beer and try to stay low carb when choosing alcohol. There where no low carb options (only beer, wine and cider) and out of the 4 wine taps only 2 worked. If you are low carb this is not the place to have a cocktail.

Overall I felt the experience was underwhelming and didn't meet my expectations, especially when I looked at the bill.  And I'm still trying to figure out what's the big deal about squid ink, maybe I just don't get it. \\n\\nLots of hype and excitement here, so I make my way over on a Friday night to a packed house.  Parking is tight but I find a spot w/o any trouble.  It's very loud inside, hipsters and yuppies and all walks of life in full throttle, I make my way to the bar and sit next to a nice old man who said he's been there for a few hours drinking and eating.  He seemed harmless and wasn't falling over, so I took the empty spot.  \\n\\nBartender gets me a glass of water and hands me the menu and runs through his favorite items.  Three of the employees here said \\"GET THE SQUID INK PAELLA!!  IT'S MY FAVE!!!\\".  Okay, that's enough for me to try it out.  I also get the appetizer w/ anchovies + pears + cheese which sounded appetizing.  I ask about the portions ($16 for small paella, $20 for large).  A couple of them had trouble articulating the difference for me, so I went for the small - - and so glad I did. \\n\\nAbout 20 min later my squid ink paella comes out, it has mussels + peas + squid + rice n ink + aioli.  They tell me to just mix it all together, however, I'm staring at the dish wondering WTF is the squid, and why are these 3 mussels so tiny?  (Enter the 80's Wendy's lady = \\"Where's The BEEF?!?\\").  There definitely is a lack of premium seafood in this dish, but I eventually find very small pieces of squid rings literally the size of my fingernail.  Not my thumb, but my index finger.  Okay, I'm hoping the taste blows me away.....\\n\\nI could barely get any of the seafood effect since it was in Smurf-like portions, and upon completion my initial reaction was I think I just ate a $18 dish that was 99.5% rice mixed with ink, 3 teeny-weenie mussels, and enough squid to feed Smurfette.  The ink was nice to experience, it was grainy, although it didn't have much of that umami effect.  If I'm paying a premium I'm expecting more of the premium stuff like the mussels and seafood, and this came up way short.  \\n\\nHere comes my anchovy & pear appetizer.  It's the size of a small coaster and looks pretty.  I'll be very honest - - I did not feel the flavors meshed very well in this dish.  You have thin hard slices of pear that are slightly sweet, and about 2 anchovies, a couple of shavings of cheese, and some oil drizzled around it.  When it all comes together in your mouth it's supposed to feel and taste like they belong together as those great dishes have that infamous umami flavor, but it gave me none of the above.  I told my neighbor that truffle oil would really make this dish more exciting, so he yells at the bartender \\"go find some truffle oil for this gentlemen!\\".  LOL!  Then again - seeing how this place prices items, a little truffle oil would likely double the the price.  \\n\\nUnderwhelmed and a bit disconnected with the food, the bartender attempts to sell me on dessert.  No thank you.  I've had enough, and I know it's all about portion sizing, and even though I still have room in the tank I'll stop right here find something elsewhere that's reasonably priced and lives up to the hype.  $30 for the entire deal (w/ tip).  Not my cup of tea and definitely not worth it.  \\n\\nService was good, however, the suggestive selling was a bit overpowering at times.  I started to wonder if these guys get commission on dishes.  I'm at the bar facing away from the crowd but the guy next to me still has to practically yell so I could hear him.  I can't say I'll rush back here again to try the other dishes, especially since I feel they are way overpriced for what they offer (BTW, it's $3.50 for a Mexican Coke.  Is it hand pressed in the back and made from scratch?). It's San Fran and NYC prices with Smurf-like portions.  But at least when I've eaten in those cities I always have gotten more of the good stuff.    \\n\\nSorry, just being frank and honest here.  I don't expect bang-for-the-buck at every place, but I do not expect to grossly overpay ($18) for a dish that contains 99.5% of a commodity that's really cheap (rice) with only bits & pieces of the good stuff (seafood).  The paella tasted good, but it wasn't anything special or out of this world, and it certainly didn't come close to some of the dishes I've experienced at high-end places like Uchi and Uchiko.  That potent umami effect is priceless which makes the experience (and price) worth while, and I didn't get any of that here at Barlata.  \\n\\nThat 80's Grandma from Wendy's - - God Bless her!"},{"name":"Yi Soon Bakery","address":"112 Brighton Ave","city":"Allston","stars":"4","text":"People need to be careful.

Between 7:30-9:30 there were only a handful of tables.  Which makes me even more aggravated because they don't even have the excuse of a full house to blame on.\\n\\nThe Maitre D' was dressed too casually and not very welcoming when we arrived for our reservation.  \\n\\nWhen we were seated, our server Fred ( I found his name on our cc receipt) who did not introduce himself...handed us our menus then proceeds to ask for our drink order.  We weren't offered water or had the time to even settle down... fine, that was just ODD.  A friend and I were debating on ordering our Guinness right away or if we should wait for our fourth party to arrive(who was parking).  We decided to wait an so Fred went away.  Our 4th arrived within 10 mins and Fred appeared right away to ask for our drinks again.  Do we even get a second to discuss?\\n\\nWe all had the 3 course meal, I had Salmon Tartare, Coq Au Vin and the Artisan Cheeses with a Lobster Bisque ( additional to the 3 course).  All in all my meal was okay, nothing blew me away.  I really really was looking forward to something special, slightly disappointed by the coq au vin.  It was a chicken leg that's a bit more flavour and tender than if I had cooked it at home.  The lobster bisque was suprisingly good, it was not creamy or thick as one companion pointed out.  Unfortunately, there was only one bite of stringy scrape of lobster in the whole bowl.  For $12 I would expect a few chunks at least.\\n\\nDessert was brought out... I liked my cheeses, they were TINY slivers of Brie & 2 other cheeses (can't remember).  Accompanied by a dish of honey, dried fruits and assorted crackers/shaved fruit/bread.  I LOVED the honey and though I love cheese, the ones on the plate was OK.  They were very dried, as in left out on the counter with no cover.  \\n \\nAs a former restaurant manager, there are always these things that aggravate me because I have not a HIGHER expectation of the staff but of the Managers/GMs.\\n\\nTowards the end of dessert while we were chatting away, Fred the server came by to inquire into our needs ( 2 seconds).  He deftly laid down the check between our friends and left.  I grumbled about receiving our check before I had asked for it but I don't think my companions heard me.  15 minutes after, Fred came back to our table again not to inquire but to flip open the check to see if there was a card/money then just walked away.  Not even an apology from Fred for disturbing our conversation.\\n\\nThat was really the last straw.  WHO does that.  You might receive that type of rude service from a fast food chinese restaurant from CHINATOWN, I wouldn't bat an eyelash but I would say something to the waiter.  I was too surprised and I didn't feel like Fred would CARE had I bring up the issue.  \\n\\nI had filled out the questionaire that came with our check, gave it to the Maitre D' as we left.

I had tried them the previous week at the Cupcake Smackdown, and wanted to bring an unusual but tasty treat for dessert. The plan was to take them to the last concert of the season that evening as dessert. Bought 3 Lemon Ginger and 3 Fleur de Sel caramel. They are $1.75 each or $4.95 for 3. \\n\\nAlmost out the door with just the evening order, I spy the almond croissants. Well, I DID just walk Town Lake, how bad could it be?\\n\\nAlmond croissant in a separate bag, I left with my tasty treats. \\n\\nDriving home, I was thinking about that croissant, so I removed it from the bag and took a little bite. It was buttery and good, but damned if that thing did not rain powdered sugar all over the front of my sweaty work out shirt. Did you know that powdered sugar and sweat make a sticky paste? Several bites later, it was totally demolished, as was the front of my shirt. \\n\\nIt was less of what I envisioned an almond croissant to be, as it seemed to have equally as many layers of almonds as croissant. Almond croissants I have had in the past are filled with almond paste and have some almonds on them. This was assembled more like a rice crispy treat with almond paste, croissant and butter stirred in with the almonds. It was good (I mean, I ate the whole thing)... but not as good as the macaroons are. I actually think it would be better as a small cookie (less mess on the eater). \\n\\nThe macaroons... I kept staring in the fridge all day at those things. Calling my name they were. I remember them from last weekend, light, airy, melt in your mouth bursting with flavor goodness. \\n\\nThe lemon ginger is so lemony and gingery at the same time. And the Fleur de Sel caramel is just buttery caramel goodness in the middle. I have not tried any of the others yet, but my mouth is watering so much now, I may have to raid my 1/2 dozen box for the evening down to 4 or 5. If I do, No Macaroons for me tonight. \\n\\nThey do serve sandwiches daily and they change it up. There is always a vegetarian and carnivore variety. The sandwiches remind me visually of the ones you see in the cafe windows in Paris, simple fare on a tasty baguette. I will have to come back and try those too. \\n\\nThey have other croissants, I will need to try those too... I just need to pace myself.

If you're going to visit an Indian restaurant in Vancouver, Vij's is THE one.\\n\\nAfter reading numerous articles and reviews on the best restaurants in Vancouver, it was undeniable that my wife and I had to visit Vij's during our vacation. I was lucky enough to snag a 5:45pm reservation 2 weeks before going and it just so happened to also be Valentine's Day as well. \\n\\nPrior to even opening at 5:30pm, we passed by on the day we were going and noticed a long line already developing, so our expectations were getting higher by the minute. To be honest, I was glad we snagged the 5:45pm res because it was the first seating of the evening when the kitchen staff is typically ready to roll and the most energized. Those 7pm reservations are overrated so go for that early bird seating! And to top it off, the man, myth and legend, Vikram Vij, himself, greeted each table during that 1st seating and he was nice enough to take a photo with us! Another reason to come for that \\"coveted\\" early spot.\\n\\nAnyway, I'll cut the suspense because everything was excellent. From the moment we stepped in, the service was great and the food we ordered was incredible. First, we were served a complimentary and amazing chai milk tea to warm us up, which got us off on the right foot. The menu was pretty much what I had seen online, so there were no surprises. To start, we ordered (1) CHICKPEAS IN STAR ANISE + DATE MASALA ON GRILLED KALE and (2) GARAM MASALA PORTOBELLO MUSHROOMS IN PORCINI CREAM CURRY. Both were amazing. The chickpeas really had a nice kick to it, but the huge naans that came with both orders were just what the doctor ordered as we sopped up the extremely delicious masalas with the bread. The portobello mushrooms were even better.\\n\\nA word of advice. Let's just say we got a little excited and probably over ordered as we were already stuffed from the appetizers, so a word to the wise, don't order 2 appetizers and 2 entrees because they all arrive with naan, which will fill you up! Especially when you're going to eat all of it because the masalas and curries are so good.\\n\\nBack to the food. \\n\\nNext, for our entrees, we ordered the much-hyped and talked about WINE MARINATED 'LAMB POPSICLES' IN FENUGREEK CREAM CURRY and STAFF MEAL, which came with goat, duck koftes, paneer cake topped with rabbit, coconut vegetables and 'hummingbird' pilaf. Truth, the lamb popiscles are pricey for 4 pieces, but DAMN they are good. Each piece of lamb was very tender and that cream curry just made it ooze flavor. Rarely do simple dishes live up to the hype, but this one definitely did. As for the Staff Meal, it was a hodgepodge all-in-one curry dish and everything on it was excellent. There wasn't one that really stood out because it was so good. However, if you do go with the Staff Meal, I would highly recommend that you stay away from any appetizers, unless you can eat a horse --- literally. The Staff Meal is no joke and can easily fill any person up without any supplements. I thought I was hungry when I walked in, but soon found out I wasn't as hungry as I thought when we finished our appetizers because we were so stuffed.\\n\\nVij's was just terrific. I don't think I can say anything else about this restaurant hasn't already been said. We came with high hopes and left wanting even more. Yes, we were full, but we took leftovers home and couldn't wait to get to those the next day. Some restaurants are a must go, but this one is a must, must go!

The edamame is top notch and particularly attractive when it only set us back $4...I know, right?\\nWe forged ahead with the Mardi Gras roll (oh, the crawfish on top!), the Rising Sun roll (per Andi P's suggestion), and the Volcano roll (awesome baked crab and scallop blanket...\\"slap your grandma\\" goodness).

I realized I did not have any cash on me so I walked next door to WAWA so I could get some cash from the ATM. Thank goodness we are always early for everything. I let the hostess know we have a 7 pm reservation and they are unable to find my reservation. I let them know we had requested a booth and we were taken to a booth. Instead of clearing two of the settings and arranging everything on the table properly, we were just seated at the table. \\n\\nAbout 10 minutes later our server comes to the table. She and the hostess asked it this was a special occasion but never asked if we had dined here before and never given a heads up about the \\"Fleming's\\" experience or menu. We were not offered recommendations by the server but fortunately I had looked them up online and reviewed the menu ahead of time. If I had relied on my server to \\"Guide\\" me through their menu, I was in trouble. \\n\\n I ordered my wife a glass of Cabernet Sauvignon and as usual I had a glass of iced tea with lime, unsweetened of course. For an appetizer I selected the Jumbo Lump Crab Cakes. We elected to have the Certified Angus Beef Porterhouse for two (32 oz) with the Black and White Peppercorn rub. For sides we ordered the Spicy Thai Green Beans and a Loaded Baked Potato. Dessert consisted of the Chocolate Lava Cake for my wife and the Creme Brulee for me. \\n\\nWe were brought some bread with two spreads and shortly after that my wife's wine arrived. I gave my server a few minutes but our appetizer arrives and my iced tea was nowhere to be found. I caught one of the other servers and he had brought me some tea. shortly thereafter our server comes to the table and she realized very quickly she had dropped the ball already. The bread, it was incredible and both of the spreads were delicious. The appetizer was spot on for taste but one of the two crab cakes was damaged. When it was set on the table, it was set on the table with the damaged cake away from us assuming we would not notice. The picture tells the story. \\n\\nOur steak was brought to the table and plated at the table. That was a nice way of presenting the steak and the plating was done skillfully. After the sides were placed on the table I elected to take a picture of everything and then we dove in. The steak was cooked PERFECTLY and I have to say that was one delicious and tasty steak. The steak sauce they put on the table was divine and I am not one for putting steak sauce on a steak but their sauce is fantastic. The green beans were perfectly cooked and the garlic was caramelized just right. The heat level could have been a little higher for my personal preference but for most I would expect it to be just right. The baked potato was just the way I liked it and when they LOAD it, they do not skimp on the bacon. \\n\\nAfter finishing our steaks we put our knives to the top of our plate  so the server would know we were finished and ready for dessert. She never caught that and did not notice my tea glass was empty. I felt like I was training this server to be perfectly candid. \\n\\nWe were brought our desserts and shortly after were approached by Beckie who was one of the operating partners to check on our dining experience. I just told it to her straight about the reservation, service issues and pointed out the chef's fingerprint on my wife's dessert plate along with showing her a picture of the appetizer. I let her know that the food was absolutely delicious but was the service was far from up to par. To her credit she took ownership of the service issues and never made any excuses. She also went far and above and said the meal was on her for not delivering on the overall dining experience. That was not necessary in my opinion but it does let me know how seriously she takes the ball being dropped on the service side. \\n\\nIn spite of the relatively poor service I still gave the server a tip that was more generous than she truly deserved but I do remember the first time I waited tables and have never forgotten how much my feet hurt at the end of a shift. \\n\\nFood:\\nTaste - 5\\nPresentation - 3 (fingerprints/crab cake damaged)\\n\\nService:\\nValet - 5\\nHostess - 1 (reservation pooch screw)\\nServer - 1\\nFood runners - 4\\nTable side presentation of steak - 5\\n\\nI will gladly give them another chance because the taste delivered but I sure hope the service deficiencies and plating issues are addressed. I rarely complain when I dine out...  I usually just pay the bill and never return when dining in places at this price point. The way Beckie handled the situation is why I will give them a second chance.\\n\\nBTW: The neighbor's dog thanks you for that steak bone!"},{"name":"Jonae's Island Twist","address":"4775 W Irlo Bronson Memorial Hwy, Ste B","city":"Kissimmee","stars":"3.5","text":"The best Jamaican restaurant in Orlando.

None of them would make eye contact with us to get our drink order. I ended up walking to the bar myself-drinks ordered and I was still optimistic. Our server finally came around to deliver our drinks and take our appetizer orders.  We indicated when we ordered apps that we would like to order our entrees shortly.  45 minutes went by and no apps nor did he ask if we wanted more drinks.  I, again, walked up to the bar and ordered drinks.  I inquired about our apps- he said he would check.  10 minutes later he indicated that he forgot to put them in and would now.  Super frustrating.  20 minutes later-still no apps, no updates and no follow-up.  I am shocked that an establishment like this is still open with all of the local competition.

We took our 4 different \\"signature\\" pizzas home ( they are personal size ) to have a variety. The general consensus was they looked and tasted like a frozen pizza.

This casual Mexican restaurant opened about a month ago and they are still getting some things figured out.  That being said, La Hacienda is absolutely worth checking out.\\n\\nFirstly, I highly recommend walking to this spot whether you live in the highlands or midtown or if you are spending the day in the park.  They have very limited parking available behind the building and you can not park in the Trader Joe's lot because it is highly monitored. There is some parking available on the neighborhood streets, but walking is strongly encouraged.\\n\\nThe vibe is solid.  You can't see it from the street, but there is a large outdoors patio on the roof. People like it so much that there isn't a ton of turn around on the outside tables.  The downstairs has a small bar and a lot of 4 top tables.  I waited about 30 minutes here before we were seated along with several other groups of 2.  Some 2 tops could really help with their turnover.\\n\\nAs soon as we sat down we had chips on our table.  Salsa and waters came quickly after.  They have a traditional semi spicy salsa and a more unique one that is more mild with a barbecue flavor.  The menu is a standard Mexican menu which I was excited to see.  As much as I like the trendy Mexican places and taquerias, sometimes you just want some delicious regular Mexican food.  We heard that their guacamole is amazing.  The guac is made table side, is plenty for a table and costs $9.  Since there was only 2 of us, we decided to get the side order of guac for $3.25.  It was plenty for two people and quite delicious. \\n\\nI ended up ordering the enchiladas verdes which come with two chicken enchiladas covered with green salsa, tomatoes, cheese and lettuce.  It comes served with rice and beans.  The meal was so fresh tasting which I don't normally associate with Mexican.  I want to know where they buy their tomatoes because they were the best I have had this summer. Though I could only finish one, my enchiladas were rich with a little spice and I would absolutely order them again. The rice, which is cooked with a few peppers, onions and other tbd vegetables, was the best part of the plate.  The beans were a little spicy for my tastes. The portions are really large.  Two people could easily split one plate.\\n\\nWe had a few service problems like the guacamole didn't come out until we were about half way finished with our entrees and we had to ask a couple of people to check on it.  At the end of our meal, our waiter was busy doing table side guac, so it wasn't the easiest thing to get our check.  Also, the hostess stand is in the middle of the restaurant so people are standing all around the tables especially towards the middle which feels uncomfortable for the people eating and the people waiting. \\n\\nThe takeaway is that I think La Hacienda has really good food and is on the way to being a great restaurant once the kinks are worked out."},{"name":"Kargi Gogo","address":"3039 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Yes sir, we got an authentic Georgian restaurant in Portland. \\n\\nThey offer several khachapuri options (think bread bowl with cheese), several dumpling options, and a few sides.

I wasn't offered any additional beverages and our service seemed to be in a bit of a rush. I ordered the bloody Mary. Huge mistake! It tasted like the cheap mixes I can buy at the local market and it DEFINITELY wasn't the liquor I ordered. The garnish looked like something pulled from last week's produce. I didn't drink the expensive beverage, nor was I asked if I enjoyed it out wound like something different.\\nCajun is more than Emeril's mix from the grocer. I was hoping the Cajun omelet I ordered wouldn't miss the mark, but it did. Nonetheless, I ordered two to take home for my daughters and they felt something was missing as well. \\nAt any rate, I must have been in a tremendously generous mood because I left more than a 50% tip on a 3  meal and 2 Service.

Sadly enough, places like this are sort of a rarity in Orlando. \\n\\nIf you don't buy into the reviews or the hype on this, try to go there and get a table without a reservation. Most times, you'll find yourself waiting a long while cuz this place always seems to be hoppin'. And rightfully so. \\n\\nThe main factor that attracts me to this place is that the focus is on the food. Don't get me wrong, the entire experience is professionally executed but this restaurant doesn't seem to strive to overly pretentious. The ambiance is warm and inviting and has a comfortable feel and the servers give good recommendations and menu descriptions without overkilling with information overload. But enough about the fluff, let me tell ya about the food! Started it off with House-made Gruyere biscuits and PEI Mussels with truffle fries ad needless to say.......yum! The biscuits were just alright (I needed something to munch on while we waited for someone) but I really enjoyed the mussels. They were cooked just right and the broth with fennel was a wonderful combination of flavors with no particular ingredient overpowering the dish. In general, I've been striving to eat healthier and lighter meals, but when I saw a farm-raised pig cassoulet with garlic sausage on the menu, I had to go for it! It wasn't a disappointment as the dish exhibited great fresh flavors which came together as a great winter time comfort food dish. Grilled pork and sausage served on top of a smokey bean, bacon and pork cassoulet. Delish! \\n\\nA really good beer, an app and entree ran me about $46 which really isn't overpriced for the quality that was presented. Just another reason why I enjoy this place: they don't kill your wallet for the experience. One of my favorite restaurants in town and TRP is always on my recommends list."},{"name":"Wok On Roll","address":"1353 Brockett Rd, Ste J","city":"Clarkston","stars":"3","text":"I really wanted to like this place but it let me down. I haven't had Chinese food in a while so I decided to shock my taste buds and have it for dinner. What a let down. I had Mongolian shrimp, my mom had Chicken and broccoli, and my boyfriend had General tsos chicken and we all had plain fried rice.  No one liked their meal. I honestly had 7 shrimp in my order. Even though I ordered a small, I expected more shrimp. My mom and boyfriend said their chicken was seasoned at all and the rice was just boiled rice. It was not fried ! Only thing giving them 2 stars is my Crab rangoon. They were good and they gave me bottled sweet and sour sauce that was pretty thick and not really good so i had to do without my condiment BUT the rangoon was good  .. i wouldn't recommend this place and I surely wont eat this again.

Those items tasted well above average, the service was quick and another thing I liked was the semi open kitchen watching the cook jerk the chicken.

I always seem to spend less money than I think I will for the amount of food I end up getting at each visit. \\n\\nJust keep in mind the store is only open Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, and it's cash only.

Close to Kits beach, friendly staff and good southern style eats. \\n\\nMy sisters and I brought my Dad to this local favourite for an impromptu dinner. We were greeted by a friendly hostess who let us know the wait list was anywhere between 20 minutes to an hour. We took a gamble and put our names on the list. Luckily for our grumbling stomachs we only waited 15 minutes before a table opened up. The atmosphere inside was electric and relaxed. They had live music happening which added to the feel of the room. \\n\\nOur server was a pleasure. Very friendly and knowledgable about the drink list and made some very good suggestions. I was disappointed they didn't have my favourite chestnut ale but they had a good selection of other taps. The teamwork of the staff was incredible, they all helped each other run drinks, food and be attentive to the guests. We were very impressed with the service we received from Chewies as a whole! \\n\\nMy dad and boyfriend both had the fried chicken. It was the perfect combination of crunchy from the buttermilk crust and sweetness from the honey. The mashed potatoes were creamy with incredible flavour. This dish was the clear winner at the table.\\n\\nI had the Jambalaya which had great Cajun flavour. Although  I love spicy and wish it was kicked up a notch. I also found the meat in the dish a tad dry. It was a good portion size, and if you're hungry this is definitely a good choice. \\n\\nMy sisters ordered the calamari. They loved it! It wasn't breaded, and came with a tasty chipotle aioli and cucumber jalape√±o dressing side of greens! Very tasty and the perfect size appetizer! \\n\\n\\nOverall, I would definitely recommend this place for some southern style eats. Next time I will have to try the oysters.

The biscuits were tasty, but so dense and I couldn't even eat more than 1/3 of one. Eggs and gravy were decent. The fried chicken, however, was the most conflicting piece for me. The outside was so well seasoned and tasty, but because there is a lot of chicken, it was fairly dry - even the gravy was not enough to offset the dryness. \\n\\nI ordered the Breakfast Club (essentially chicken club with waffles instead of toast). The Breakfast Club comes with a side and we got tater tots for that, then ordered another larger side of beef & pork belly hash. The Breakfast Club was very difficult to eat (see pictures) but the hot sauce on there stood out the most for me. The weirdest concept though is to put the hot sauce all the way on the top of the club and the chicken was all the way on the bottom. They would have been great together.

Chinese spinach and bean curd:\\n- this is not a common dish outside of shanghai, so I was very happy to see it\\n- the spinach is not a spinach lol. I believe in English it's called Indian aster or Indian Kalimeris. It used to be a wild vegetation in China lol and has a strong herbal taste, which is unique and definitely worth a try if you've never had it before \\n- the veggie and bean curd are chopped finely and mixed with basic seasoning like salt, sugar, and sesame oil. The dish is meant to be served cold and retaining the natural flavour of the ingredients. \\n\\nService at this location is lovely.

My daughter and I love it and she wanted to share it with her boyfriend. This was his first visit. \\nEverything was going good, place was a little crowded but we were seated immediately. The waiter came over, didn't introduce himself, took our drink orders. I had a Pepsi and they chose water with lemon.\\nWe all three chose the one bowl option for $9.99. The guy asked if we wanted to upgrade the rice for a small fee from traditional standard white to fried rice either veggie or shrimp. He should have said for a fee of $5 you can upgrade your rice per person...that is outrageous!!!!!\\n$10 in rice when the white is included. I chose the white, my daughter and her boyfriend went with the veggie and shrimp upgrades..which is like having another person to dinner.\\nWe went up to start our journey through the line. I went with boneless chicken and crab meat, my assortment of veggies like carrots, jalapenos, bean sprouts, black beans, corn, onions and mushrooms with several different spicy sauces and seasoning.\\nTook the bowl up the waiting area to allow the chefs to perform their culinary masterpiece. Someone else's food got mixed into my jumbled mess. Not sure why they don't just through it on their willy nilly and scoop it out into your platter because I ended up with potatoes, tomatoes and even green peppers in mine..NOT MY VEGGIE CHOICES...\\nBUT THE REAL KICKER, half way through my plate I bite down into a piece of chicken and hit a BONE!!!!! I immediately call my waiter over and show him, he said \\"OH I am sorry...do you want a drink refill?\\" I said \\"NO, I would like for you to take the chicken off the bar and have it checked out for future dining customers.\\" He said \\" I don't think we can do that\\" so he stood there then he said \\"Do you want my manager? \\" I said \\"YES DEFINITELY!!\\"\\nAbout 10 minutes later the manager came over, very young looking man about mid 20s. He said \\"Heard you found a bone, sorry about that would you like another plate?\\" I said \\"No I am full, but you need to pull the chicken\\" he said \\"Thanks for telling me I will pass on to the vendor\\" and walked away. We were there another 15 minutes and they never removed the chicken from the bar while we were there. He didn't even discount my ticket. I paid full price of food, taxes and tip at $17.00\\nHe should have done something immediately about that chicken and he should have at least discounted my food. My entire price for the whole party was $65 with taxes and tips. Some sort of discount would have been nice.

I would have ordered their biscuit breakfast sandwich but I am trying to make healthier choices at restaurants these days so not this time but the meal was still very satisfying.

We were anticipating this meal all weekend but it failed to live up to our expectations because of the service. We had Jamie as our server and immediately we could tell she wasn't interested in truly serving us, and making our experience enjoyable.\\n\\nTo start, we waited about 30 minutes for our table even though our reservation was made months earlier. The hostess told us that her manager \\"f----d\\" her over with our reservation. Not professional but we appreciated her honesty. \\n\\nWhen we were finally seated, Jamie took several minutes to initially approach our table. It took her much longer than it should've for her to return to our table to take our drink order. We could see her walk by our table and check in with the other tables around us. When she finally did come back to us, she seemed very uninterested through her body language and attitude. A very happy occasion for us was tampered down because of her.\\n\\nShe got part of our drink order wrong, serving -- and charging -- for a double when a single was requested. After the appetizer was served, she noticed we were shorted a few shrimp and told us she'd bring a few more out. Mind you, this wasn't requested. She did this on her own. She didn't explain the specials when asked about them beyond a general \\"here are our specials.\\" \\n\\nThroughout the meal, it continued to take her a long time to check in on us as our drinks remained empty. When a refill of the single, which she served as a double, was requested, she brought over another double in a single glass. \\n\\nWe were entertaining ourselves so her poor service wasn't a big deal until the bill came. She had charged us for a second appetizer when she offered to bring out a few more -- and that's exactly what she did, bringing just four extra shrimp while charging for an entire plate -- and charged for two doubles when two singles were ordered. \\n\\nAfter we called over the manager and explained the situation, he said he'd take off the items and print out a new bill. Instead, he pawned the situation off back to her. When Jamie approached our table to ask about our questions with the bill, she was quite defensive and talked down to us as if we didn't know what we had ordered. It took a few minutes of a stern back and forth conversation on both sides for her to agree to take off the extra charges.\\n\\nWe quickly realized what she was doing. All around us were large parties of young people, from which she was already getting a preset gratuity, of 20%, in theory, she wouldn't have to give us a certain level of service because she was getting her tip regardless. We're almost certain that she's made it a habit of up-charging parties, just hoping they don't check the bill, which, after a few rounds of drinks, they probably don't. \\n\\nWe were finally able to get the bill settled and when she dropped off our credit cards, she basically threw them down, and walked off, saying \\"thank you,\\" as she trailed to the next table.\\n\\nOverall, what should've been a celebration dinner turned into a frustration and difficult meal."},{"name":"Bartaco Boulder","address":"1048 Pearl St","city":"Boulder","stars":"4","text":"Having been to the Tampa, FL location several times I thought I'd give Boulder, CO a shot.

Down hill from there.  Absolutely zero taste.  The Veal Marsala was tough and tasted just like the Fettuccini Alfredo.....flour.   The sauce was the consistency of sausage gravy. Wife's so called filet was awfully gray for medium, and had the texture of a dry strip steak.    The only pink we noticed was on the outer edgers of d steak with the center being completely gray, not sure how that happens unless it spends m time in a microwave either thawing or rewarming.  Wouldn't surprise me since it was a good 30 minutes between clearing our soup and salad plates before our main dishes arrived.   Undercooked scallops are always dangerous, so she didn't even try them.  Most regretful $110 I've dropped on a meal.

It's not stand-out and is more fast food than prepared it appears to me.\\n\\nThey give you large portions at an average price (for a take-out place) as I have experienced with the fried rice and sesame chicken. For $20 you can get a great amount of food with leftovers that will last you a couple of days.\\n\\nThe food itself is tasty, though not with flair, it just tastes good for what it is. The rice tends to be on the greasier side so definitely have lots of water ready when preparing to eat it. \\n\\nAll-in-all, I would conclude that Canton Eatery is a relatively average place for what it is. It isn't bad, it's kind of good. Though I would note: how good it is really depends on the mood you are in and if you are saying to yourself \\"yes I am happy with spending this amount of money for this kind of food,\\" especially if it isn't your first time eating there.

I would've preferred it a tad more tender, but you can tell it was still cooked nicely. The problem I had with this was the Hoisin on top of it.

Complex flavors, and definitely had a nice kick. This was actually okay. I didn't really have many complaints about this.\\n\\n_ Summer Squash, Sungold Conserva, Burrata $14\\nThis was also just fine.

Dumplings has always been one of my favorite foods to eat. My grandmother use to make all sorts of different dumplings for my brother and I; anywhere from steamed to pan-fried to soup dumplings. \\n\\nWhen I first heard there was going to be a Dumpling place opening up, I had to go and try it out. Reading the history of dumpling experience from the website, it got me even more hyped up. \\n\\nWalking into the restaurant, and looking around. Right away I said to myself \\"Oh Its a small and cozy little place\\" I'd say that it'll probably cater to about 20-24 individuals. \\n\\nI was immediately greeted as I walked into the restaurant. That is probably one of the must-do's in my book. It shows gratitude for being a potential patron and it, to me builds rapport. \\n\\nI then proceeded to ask for a take-out menu and to my surprise, the manager (so I assumed) said that ehy have not been printed out yet. I was a bit surprised, being the fact that I'm sure that there will be a lot of people asking for menus on the first couple days of grand opening. \\n\\nI had ordered the Emperor's Dumping, the soupy pork bun, and the dumpling room dumplings. Figured this would be a good start to see what this place is all about. The total came out to be around $25, which i thought was a little pricy for 3 orders of dumplings. \\n\\nMoments later as I am now sitting on my chair, opening the take out bag and mentally and almost physically drooling with exciting of the first bite, I am not ready to try out this new dumpling joint. I first tried the Emperor's dumpling, the taste is excellent. The wrap itself was a little soft but it had a nice texture and the filling was well prepared. Definitely one of my top choices. \\n\\nThe second one i tried was the Soupy pork dumplings. I'm assuming these are suppose to be the imfamous Chinese \\"Xiao Long Bao\\". An old recipe that is known for refridgerating the soup with the filling to make it solid and them steaming them before serving so that the juices become \\"soupy\\" and so that it gets trapped inside the dough/bun. The flavor is there with this one, however my two issues with this one is that the dumpling is suppose to be \\"soupy\\" but I found them to be a little more on the dryer side and the dough was really thick. \\n\\nLastly was the Dumpling Room Dumplings. This one wasn't bad. I am always a fan of putting chives in dumplings. Chives, being in the scallion family, works really well with dumplings as it is less pungent but still has a nice \\"oniony\\" taste without the killer female repellent breath. I would love to give this dumpling a better but i feel as though that this dumpling is a little too simple to be name their House special dumpling. For those that are actually reading this, I would still recommend this dumpling as it is pretty satisfying for dumpling lovers, but personally I expected a little more uniqueness and different. \\n\\nThe overall customer service as i was there was good and friendly. Maybe offering me a glass of water or tea as i waited for my order wouldve been a bonus, but no big deal. \\n\\nThe question I always ask myself after trying a new place...\\n\\n\\"Would I ever go back?\\" \\n\\nAs I mentioned, the price for the dumplings are a little on the high side. As I do appreciate that everything was made from scratch in-house, the justification for the high price just isn't really there. Personally, if they were a little less expensive, I would definitely go there a lot more often. That being said, the answer to my question would be.... Yes, i would go back once in a while. I do anticipate myself having cravings for this place."},{"name":"The Avenue Steak Tavern","address":"94 N High St","city":"Dublin","stars":"4","text":"We had a reservation for 7:45 and were seated at approximately 8:15, so this begs the question - why did we make a reservation.

For sure, the owner could be a huge geek himself, but the waitresses and the bartender are not nerds or geeks at all.

We read the reviews and saw that their air conditioning was broken so we called ahead to ask about the air conditioning. We were told it had been fixed. When we arrived it was an okay temperature near the door but once we sat down in the back we could tell immediately that the air conditioning was definitely not on.  When it's 90 degrees outside that's a real problem. \\n\\nThe service was terrible. In a restaurant you should never let the customer's water glass sit empty. Particularly when it's 90 degrees outside and you have broken air conditioning.  These guys let our glasses sit empty for at least 15 minutes until I got up and found a waiter standing next to a bunch of pitchers of cold water and asked for water.  This after I saw a manager looking guy walk by our table a few times and doing nothing then walking away. I looked around at the other tables and saw other people sweating to death with empty water glasses as well. \\n\\nWe ordered tableside guacamole, two entrees, and a pitcher of patron margaritas. All of it was mediocre. \\n\\nThe guacamole was not very flavorful, nowhere near as good as what we can make at home. \\n\\nThe margaritas were weak. I'm not sure they even had alcohol in them. If you're completely sober after splitting a $40 pitcher of margaritas between two people, particularly when you pay more for \\"premium\\" tequila, then those are terrible margaritas. \\n\\nThe food was mediocre at best. I get that it's \\"Tex mex\\" and not \\"real Mexican food\\" but our food just wasn't good. The best food we ordered were the two tacos, and again, I could have made those at home. \\n\\nI can't see any reason why I would go back to this place.

The order came with cornbread and Texas Toast. \\n\\nWhen it came to the food we all had different opinions of what we loved most. We definitely agree that everything was delicious! Great flavor, tender, smoky flavor, and large portions. The corn pudding was made perfectly. Sometimes the consistency of corn pudding when made by some people is off.

Unlike some of the other reviews on here, I have zero complaints about the kitschy, fun decor and prices. My review is about the food and service. We arrived without reservations on a busy Friday night and were seated immediately. After we were seated, our waiter still wasn't around, so a really friendly waitress brought us out waters while we waited. Too bad she didn't wait on us for the meal! Finally our server wandered over. He was VERY obviously under the influence of something. He slurred so badly we couldn't even understand him at first. We had to repeat our drink orders a few times, and when he delivered them he sloshed one of the drinks all over the table and didn't notice whatsoever. We all lost it when he walked away, thinking that this seriously had to be a joke and there's no way that the management didn't notice and would allow this. It was quite apparent there was an issue. We had to repeat our appetizer orders as well. He never brought dipping oil/spices after requesting them multiple times. Our apps came out, and were lukewarm, but our waiter never came back to check so we just nibbled on them anyway since we were starving. Our entrees came and they were just meh. The chicken in both of them was so hard it was inedible but the pasta and sauce were good. The waiter came back again and filled waters up. He didn't even lift the pitcher to go from one glass to the next and dumped water all over the table. He still didn't even notice lol.  We finished up, paid the bill, and left. I get that the prices are the prices, but for what you pay there should be better quality control. A manager never stopped by our table to check in, so it's not surprising that customer service isn't that important at this location.

As an Oregonian I've been spoiled by being able to eat food at bars and not have 2nd hand smoke, but since it was outside, it is allowed.  And, if it was just one smoker, it probably would have been fine, but I was surrounded by about 4 smokers in about a 25-ft radius.  Luckily for us, it wasn't ridiculous crowded so we were able to move inside and check out the stadium-seating.  IT was pretty cool, and you are set up to \\"people watch\\" as well as have a little table to set your food, drinks and phone on!  So, that was nice.  \\n\\nThe drink was amazing!!!

We were literally looking forward to this day 2 weeks in advance. It was our holiday gift to one another. We booked massages and pedis and got a cabana by the pool. It was supposed to be glorious and relaxing. However, due to some issues, it was just lovely, nothing above and beyond anything else I have ever experiences so I was a little let down. \\n\\nSpa:\\n\\nIt's a lovely spa. Everything was relaxing, the mango-ginger signature water was to die for and they had complimentary teas and nuts. The ladies giving our pedicures were fabulous, so friendly and informative, they made us feel extra comfortable. The masseuse was lovely but the massage was just okay. \\n\\nI went for the seasonal orange cream pumpkin pie pedi: \\nRelax into a warming whole milk softening soak before experiencing a richly scented brown sugar scrub for the legs and feet in preparation for a nourishing spiced pumpkin puree mask. Legs and feet are then wrapped in steamed towels to help sooth away holiday stress. Legs and feet are then massaged with a silky soft honey suckle orange cream. \\n\\nDid it smell good? Absolutely. Was there tons of relaxation? Not really. I was expecting a little more than just the small, maybe more massaging or detail to relaxation but it was just a regular pedi that smelled really good in whiff. \\n\\nValet is included in the SPA as well as full access to the private outdoor spa pool area and gym. The SPA was lovely and the steam room and hot tub were nice. I wasn't a fan of the hot tub being right in front of the showers, just didn't make for a full private and relaxing area. Everything was super clean! \\n\\nPool / Cabana:\\n\\nThe Cabana special they were running was for $125 for up to 4 people including:\\nAll day use (10am to 6pm), Private Seating, Flat Screen Television, Refrigerator containing chilled water and assorted sodas, Chips and Pretzels, Pool Towels, Outside of your cabana there are 4 lounge chairs reserved for you to enjoy.\\n\\nThe pool was so empty we could have just took over a small area to ourselves without the Cabana but we already pre booked it. It said their would be aroma therapy towels, there were not. They mentioned on the phone when booking that the best area for sun was on the opposite side of the bar (where two other cabanas are) so we went with that. There were 4 cabanas on our side but we were the only occupied one. The downfall... it was RIGHT next to the kiddie sprinklers. Are you kidding me? Thanks for the heads up =( That heavens it wasn't too busy to the point of constant little kids screaming, I was very disappointed we did not get that heads up though. And who puts private cabanas in front of the kid area? \\n\\nOur servers were awesome, props for that! Food was good and came quickly. I did like having our own fridge too, helped with drink access. \\n\\nService:\\n\\nWhile we were laying out, we were approached with our bills from the spa and the girl arrived with all of the wrong information on our bills, not reflecting our correct services or deals we booked online via FL specials. She apologized and left to get it fixed, she came back and it was still wrong. We gave her one card for the cabana and once adjusted, other cards for our spa services. She ran the wrong cards for our services... sigh... we were so frustrated at this point we just allowed it and figured the differences in cash and paid each other. For a top notch place like the Peabody, I thought for sure the service would blow me away... it really put a damper on things. Also, one of the ladies I was with had her boyfriend call ahead of time to take care of her bill and along that process, they messed up her massage appointment time, originally scheduled for the morning, they canceled it and could only fit her in later in the afternoon. I don't understand how they messed that up. Everything was correct in the notes in the system, and it was supposed to be a surprise and they almost gave it away to her over the phone =(  \\n\\nOverall the location is gorgeous and you really do forget you are in a tourist area, a fabulous get away for the day.

The food menu looked enticing but between the two of us we only shared the \\"warmed olive selections\\" which were delicious as well as the hummus and warm bread and pita; the hummus coming in three tasty flavors.  No main course was ordered so I'll bail on that portion.  Now comes the ambience.\\n\\nFrom the outside, this place looks out of place.  There could've been a Verizon store on one side and a Kinko's/FedEx on the other.  It's pushed into a small strip commercial center that is very unappealing.  Once inside you warm up a bit.  The large bar is very accomodating and looks like it could hold up to 25 - 30 seated.  More if people are standing.  The tables are disjointed and packed into little cellar-area nooks and crannies.  It works but what some might suggest is intimacy, others would just say its all too close together.  There is a back room with a large table - perhaps seating 8 - 16 persons for private scheduling ( I liked the looks of it).   And then there's the din of voice-noise.  By 8PM the place was buzzing with business but the noise levels were ominously high.  This is not a place to have a sit-down dinner date if you're hoping for low level conversation.\\n\\nAnd lastly..... COUGAR TOWN.  Yes, on Friday at 6:30PM when I walked in to meet my friend the bar was entirely commprised of women with women who ranged in age from 25 - 50 years young.  For me, it was terrificly enticing.  Wow!  Soon thereafter this climate changed and it turned to couples and mixed couples dining out.\\n\\nFor a laugh.... I ordered a chardonnay that I was told is commonly referred to in this Wine Bistro as \\"Cougar Juice\\" - how fitting.   I will make a return stop.... and know nothing about wine other than it leads to warm olives and some brazen thoughts of women."},{"name":"Carsonie's","address":"6000 Westerville Rd","city":"Westerville","stars":"3.5","text":"We ate in Saturday 1/19/19 for the first time.

You sit down at classic - under stated but elegant-  Castilian wooden tables. Simply a classic authentically seductive Spanish atmosphere.\\n\\nSecond, the drinks here:\\n\\nOne word: Sangria! They have the best in Boston here. You have a choice usually of a peach or red sangria (order the red) It just has that perfect tangy taste to drink with Spanish food.  Also notable is the Wine list! (But pricey- be careful)\\n\\nThird, the Food here:\\n\\nThis is what makes Tasca truly special-\\n\\nThe Tapas menu! (see pictures) You can order Wonderful midsized plates of a wide variety of delectable and scrumptious Spanish dishes very cheaply ($5.50 to $7.95)\\n\\nOf particular note:\\n\\n1. The Duck Leg (see photo)\\n2. The 3 oz steak\\n3. the Spanish omelet (see photo)\\n4. The Salted Cod\\n5. The escargot (see photo)\\n6. The Salmon on potato pancake! (see photo)\\n\\nA note about portions:\\nLight eaters- three plates more then fills two people.\\nHeavy eaters - 4 pates will do the trick.\\nYelpers - Order one of each\\nDamien- Order 2 of each (just kidding) 3 of each!\\n\\nBut save room for:\\n\\nFourth, THE DESSERT!!!!!

What more could a Bostonian ask for? \\nNada! :)\\n\\nUnfortunately 2 stars off because of my last experience there with the Ma√Ætre Dee:\\nI make a reservation on a Tuesday night (the place was half empty) for table for 2 at 7:30. The Bullying Mean Girl Asian American female Ma√Ætre Dee is like \\"Whatever!\\" and writes it down. My Friend comes early at 7:15 so I ask for a table early (again- the place was half empty).  Ma√Ætre Dee ABC says \\"What!?\\" + \\"Uhhh!\\"+ Eye Roll (You would think I had asked her to give up her yearly tickets to the Estate Dance Club and her Katy Perry CD collection! That's how annoyed she acted!) Then, in true passive aggressive nastiness, she sits us at the worst table in the restaurant -when many other tables for two were available! This table is right by the drafty window, squeezed between two other tables, in the complete dark. I ask for a new table and she gives us that classic Snooty Snotty look and storms off throwing a Category 5 hissy fit. \\n\\nNote to owner: Mean Girls make for Great Reality TV....and horrible dining experiences.

We we're not dressed up, having just come from halothereapy across the street but Yelp said the atmosphere was casual. Cough, cough... That was definitely not the case. I would describe it as romantically rustic. I would never show up here again in yoga pants. Oopsy!\\n\\nAnyways, it was about 7PM in the evening and we didn't have reservations so we opted to sit at the communal table. It was enormous and there were only two other people sitting there so we were happy to take up the space. It didn't take long for a waitress to come over over, bringing us water to sip on while we made some decisions. My friend and I both ordered the Wonderful White Blends flight, which came with three, nice sized pours of wine. White Sky (Oregon), Chateao L'Ermitage (France), and Scaia (Italy). If I remember correctly number three was my favorite. We also shared the baked French brie appetizer. Oh my, it was so freakin' tasty! This brie was wrapped in a crispy shell and came with bread, apples, strawberries, and a fresh preserve. The cheese paired very well with everything on the plate. It was also the perfect size portion for an appetizer. \\n\\nFor my entr√©e, I ordered the caeser salad and I added the caramelized salmon. It didn't take long to come out of the kitchen and the salmon was cooked perfectly. The caramelized top gave it tons of flavor and great texture. I would order it again in a heartbeat. The salad could have used a little more dressing but other than that it was great! The romaine lettuce was fresh and crispy and it included the traditional croutons and Parmesan cheese. My friend ordered the penne pasta and said it was really good as well. It was super cheesy and looked really filling.\\n\\nGood service, check! Good food, check! Great wine selection, check!

The noodles are a bit over sauced for my taste and the Pad Thai was smothered to the point that it didn't quite taste like Pad Thai anymore.\\n\\nMind you, it's so close to Emory that they realize they can jack their prices up a few dollars more than it deserves.

As a living, breathing Texan I was curious whether this would be like actual roadhouses I visited back in my college days, and the short answer was no: the beer wasn't watered down, the steak wasn't tough, and nobody threw up on my boots.  Instead what we have here is a family restaurant with a fairly diverse menu and some Texas themes (like random eruptions of line dancing).  On to the food:\\n\\nDinner rolls: A+.  These tasty little guys were dropped on the tables when we arrived, and they were awesome.  I'm sure they're steeped in butter, and I don't care.\\nAppetizer platter: B+. The boneless fried wings were great; the Texas torpedoes (or whatever they call them) were mostly breading and cheese; the potato skins were solid.\\nRib-eye steak: A+.  My wife says it's one of the best she's had.\\nChicken-fried chicken: B.  I actually ordered chicken-fried steak, but later realized that it's \\"chicken-fried sirloin\\" on the menu and the waitress misunderstood.  In any case, it was a schizophrenic experience:  it was some of the crunchiest, least-soggy breading I've ever had (seriously), the chicken was tender, and the gravy was served on the side...but it was amazingly salty, in fact overwhelmingly so.  Lose half the salt and this would be one of the best chicken-frieds ever.  \\nMashed potatoes B: see above.\\nPulled pork dish: my son says B+. This was pretty good.  By avoiding any attempts at being fancy or tricky, they delivered a BBQ dish that was okay without being bland.\\nFish and chips: my son says B.\\nService: ignoring the chicken-fried problem, our server (Alexandra) was completely awesome.  Not only was she friendly, but she actually checked in on us at regular intervals to see if we needed anything.  How crazy is that?\\n\\n*** Advisory which I'll include with all reviews that mention BBQ (this is really not aimed at any specific review): I grew up in Texas and lived there 35 years, so sure, I've had a lot of barbecue.  But it's annoying when people say things like \\"I'm from ____, so I really know barbecue.\\"  The truth is that all the people I knew in Texas had their own individual preferences, and being from there didn't add an iota of expertise...it just created a lot of strong opinions.  So let's work together and try NOT claiming we know what \\"real\\" barbeque is, okay?

I'm not sure why everything we had was doused in pepper, maybe that should be labeled somewhere? We got the shrimp topping for the steak, but I couldn't even eat it due to the level of spice. The tuna poke was mediocre and the guacamole looked like it was taken from something prepackaged from a grocery store.

The fajitas featured overcooked steak that lacked any sufficient flavor. The chimichanga was pretty decent, albeit served with a rather unfavorable rice and beans that the chimichanga already didn't need.

Though they have great deals on drinks/beers to make it a great drinking hang-out, the food and service is quite lacking to the point where if you actually are hungry and want to eat...this place is not for you. \\n\\nParking: Jack's technically has a parking lot next door, but it fills up quickly. I personally have never even tried to get a spot in it. However, there is tons of street parking up and down N Highland Ave so I recommend just trying to get a spot there. There is also a Relay Bike share station right nearby off Freedom Trail, so that is also an option.\\n\\nAmbiance: Jack's is definitely an authentic dive bar in terms of its decor and overall vibe. It's quite dark on the inside and can be quite loud. There is also an outdoor patio with additional seating, but smoking is allowed out there so beware if you want to avoid that. Again, I get the appeal of the a dive bar, but unfortunately there are some cleanliness issues here. Typically the tables dont have enough time to get properly cleared, so chances are high that there will be some left over food on the table. The worst part for me is always the bathrooms...they only have two throughout the whole restaurant...and usually one is broken. The bathrooms themselves are covered in graffiti and are usually pretty gross smelling. I consider myself fairly easy to please when it comes to restrooms, but these have got to be some of the worst ones I have experienced in a restaurant. \\n\\nService: There is no host/hostess, so you sit at whatever table you would like. However, it gets quite busy very early on, so it can be hard to find a spot. If you go on a Friday/Saturday night, be prepared to stand around for 20 or so minutes and be ready to pounce on a table that is finishing up. Though the staff is usually nice enough, the service takes SO LONG. Be ready to wait for up to an hour for your food; that unfortunately has become the norm here.\\n\\nFood: What originally drew my to Jack's was their unique menu. I would always go for a slice of the Chili Cheese Dog Pizza. For $4 you can order a slice literally the size of your face. However, the last time I went I was told that not only would my pizza take over an hour, we could only order a whole pizza..not a slice. Not being able to order slices really takes out the appeal of stopping by for a fun slice of pizza. The wings used to be another go-to, they are baked so don't feel greasy and they also have great combinations of sauces that you can order. As per the rest of the menu, you have to wait a longgggg time to finally consume these wings. Overall, as unique as the menu is, the food is not nearly good enough to wait longer than 15 minutes to get.\\n\\nTL;DR: This place takes dive-bar to a whole new level where the bathroom literally terrifies me. Though the menu may come off as unique and quirky, the food is not good and not worth the ridiculous wait that has now become the norm at Jack's. If you are really craving something from Jack's, you should just do carry-out."},{"name":"El Patron Mexican Restaurant & Cantina","address":"12167 S Apopka Vineland Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"This service was the worst.

It was showing that the staff couldn't handle the situation since EVERYONE who we met was RUDE and had an ATTITUDE.  The hostess declared to me that she simply does not have my reservation in her book and told us we have nothing but wait for no one knows how long but she hoped maybe 30 minutes.  In 30 minutes she said she had no idea when we could eat and we asked for the manager trying to extend the voucher and come back another time.  In response, we get an attitude, let alone some kind of apology in spite the fact we had an evidence on my phone that that the restaurant called to confirm my reservation.  \\n\\nWe decided it'd make sense to request a groupon extension and come back another day.  We asked for the manager and waited for almost half an hour.   The story gets much worse -- when the manger finally came out to talk to us, she started literally YELLING at us in front of everybody, screaming into my face that if WE have no patience, she is not going to tolerate OUR behavior  and showed us the door.  It was so ridiculous that it was not even feel real.  I don't think I ever was treated like that in a restaurant.  Everyone around was shocked by the manager's rudeness and inappropriate behavior.

The tuna tartar had an unappealing color and was presented a little different than expected. I can get passed the presentation but the flavors were lacking, tuna did not taste fresh. The Brussels sprouts were drowning in sauce- also unpleasant. But one really good thing we had was the choriburger, it was juicy on a nice crispy bread, wish it was bigger.

Now I do not mind paying high dollars and wait for days for food if it's worth it, however this is not the case.  The salad is over dressed, veal has no flavor, the fettuccine alfredo was cooked so much that it was almost slop, the cioppino was so salty that we almost couldn't eat it, all the seafood that was in the cioppino were frozen,  nothing was fresh.  With 4 dishes our bill comes to around 90 dollars, I pulled my credit card out and set it on the table for about 20 min before anyone asked us how our meal was and if we need deserts or boxes.  When our server asked how everything was, which she failed to do throughout the entire meal, I said it was ok, then she feels the need to give us some attitude of her own by answering us with \\"oooooook\\" in a sarcastic and disrespectful tone, then my wife felt at that point, we need to let her know what we were upset about.\\nAfter we told her the fact that we've been here for almost 2hrs for this meal, she told us that this is a family owned restaurant,  not coporate, and the kitchen is small, that's why the food comes put slow.

The food is sub par and drink prices are extremely high. The food is basic. By the way, I was warned not to visit this place by the hotel. I should have listened to the hotel!! In the end, there is nothing special except close to hotels and other restaurants. I would suggest going elsewhere. If you visit and I highly recommend not to, check your receipts if paying by credit card!!"},{"name":"Smokey Bones Bar & Fire Grill","address":"3400 E Colonial Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"The SmokeyBones on E Coloni is GREAT.

Living in Georgia my whole life I feel I have experienced some pretty good country cooking. My absolute favorite meal growing up was fried chicken, macaroni and cheese, and mashed potatoes so let's just say I have tried most places versions of my favorite meal. Here are my ultra-subjective ramblings of my highly evolved and correct (;)) taste buds on the fried chicken, mac-n-cheese and mashed 'tater meal here: \\n\\n*Fried chicken- not browned well, very light in color. Crispy, but in a high school lunchroom way, not a deliciously fried country cooking way. Salty. Moist meat. Not my favorite fried chicken by any means. I liked the Colonnade's version better and that is not saying much. \\n*Mashed potatoes- keep in mind I hate condiments and especially gravy so I went plain- the potatoes tasted like a mix of both real potatoes and the boxed flaky kind. Wasn't a huge fan. \\n*Fried Okra- the typical frozen fried kind, but they were fried well and the taste was pure frozen fried okra. \\n*Macaroni and Cheese- the best of the meal. Only one issue with the mac and cheese, it needed more fresh cheddar on top. While the inside was good I love the topping and it was missing that. \\n\\nI would like to say the service was great and I really dug my server.

I most recently went Sunday evening with a group of friends. Michelle and Zaneil outdid themselves! Everything was so delicious and very authentic. This time I could really take in the beautiful decor from the booth you sit in to the many Turkish lamps hanging from the ceiling. The babaganoush is hands down my favorite dip! It's smoked eggplant without being too smoky. The other dips were also really good. The lavash was as fluffy and warm as ever. This time we enjoyed the chicken saut√© with the lemon cream sauce, definitely the table favorite. I also enjoyed the Iskandar lamb dish which was slices of doner lamb on top of buttered bread and a tomato sauce. There was a yogurt sauce on top. So good and so much it made for some great leftovers. It was really nice to have the salad adjusted for our preference with feta cheese added, the presentation was beautiful. Even the spicy dishes were still delicious because of the great seasoning. Having previously been the chef at Bosphorous, Zaneil has brought the taste that we love at Bosphorous and made it 10 times better here. Prices are really reasonable and the service you can't beat. They remember you and come to greet you when you arrive and wish you well when you leave. I'm never going to Bosphorous again or any other Turkish restaurant for that matter.

I basically only ate half of the rice and then I gave up. I also ordered a slice of rum cake which was $4 per SLICE! It wasnt worth it. Im better off waiting until a holiday for my jamaican family to cook a better tasting rum cake. The food more so tasted as if whomever cooked it was not cooking it with love.

The fried kale was delicious, although really salty. The cauliflower with tahini was also delicious, as was the meatball. But we went for the early happy hour and were a little disappointed with the small selection for the hh menu. When we asked about items we saw on the internet we were told those were only the 'late night' hh. We were the ONLY group in the house! Seems like they might have wanted to promote a little more business at 6pm. Also the waitress was strangely uninformed about the menu. When I asked about portion size she said the items were all sized to share family style, so I ordered the scallop sashimi dish, one of the more expensive items on the 'non-happy hour' menu. It was literally ONE scallop sliced into 4 pieces with some toppings. $11. A little hard to share. We were there to celebrate a girlfriend's birthday so thought we would look at the dessert menu. The desserts were named such odd things we had to have the waitress 'interpret' . To be honest I don't think she knew what the stuff was either, since earlier in the evening she didn't know what tahini was - one of the ladies at the table had to correct her when she told someone it was a different spice than sesame. We chose to open a box of chocolates that was one of the birthday gifts.The weirdest thing was the restroom situation. You have to go outside and down an alley to get to the restroom. ??? We thought we heard them wrong at first and came back inside to get the correct directions. Nope... that's the deal!\\n In summary, some of the food is good and different, the drinks were good, the waitress was friendly and attentive, but uniformed about the menu.

My family and I came here to celebrate Mother's Day. My dad kept telling me that we were about to have a \\"5 star experience!\\" so I was very excited. The restaurant itself is nice and has an intimate feel. I was surprised at the range of attire I saw, some people were dressed very casually so don't be worried about dress like I was.\\n\\nAll 3 of us thoroughly enjoyed our food! My dad and I had the 10oz steak which was very filling. They have a house steak sauce that tastes vinegar based which I didn't like so I had A1. The creamed corn is DELICIOUS! You've got to get it! I wasn't as crazy about my brisket mac and cheese because it was dry. My mom had the crab cakes and love them as well.\\n\\nThe disappointing part of the night was the service. When we got to the table, the seats, floor, and table were all wet. The table & seats were recently wiped down but had not had time to dry. The floor was soaking as if someone spilled a glass of water. We had to wait for everything to be dried. Once seated, our server mentioned that the bread was just placed in the oven so it might take a little bit. We were understanding, but we got our bread maybe 20 minutes later! That's a significant wait, we even got our appetizer and salad before that. My dad commented on the bread wait time and I guess that made the waiter mad because from then on out he didn't come back to our table until the very end of the meal. Not to refill our water, not to bring steak sauce (even after I mentioned I might want some), nothing. When he eventually came to ask if we wanted dessert, to give the check, etc., he didn't make eye contact and was short. For such a classy restaurant, this is unexceptable. I will note that the other staff that helped us (i.e. bringing me steak sauce) seemed nice.\\n\\nIf I go back and have another poor service experience, I'd reduce my rating to 3 stars.

It's never been a priority to me...not something I look for, in a restaurant. Creativity? Yes! Smarts? Absolutely. Maybe even a small sense of humor. But mussels?? Not so important. \\n\\nUntil last nite. Now I'll be looking for them everywhere I go. I have had them before. Years ago I had my first taste at Vespaio and thought, \\"hey that' ok\\". Then last year I had them at a popular restaurant that shall remain nameless (but starts with a \\"P\\" and ends with an \\"i\\") and they tasted like cow manure (just guessing there, but they tasted like the way a barn smells). Just horrifically disgusting. \\n\\nSo it was with trepidation that I approached them last nite, but Ranch 616 had thus far pleasantly surprised me, I thought I would give the mussels a valiant try. \\n\\nHubby and I had coupons (of course!) for the 3 part tasting menu. As such we got a choice of salad (the fresh greens with candied walnuts was tasty!), choice of 3 entrees, and a dessert each. I was at first taken aback as I thought this was a fancy place, it being a steakhouse and all. But it's more like an old diner my grandparents would take us to growing up (kinda reminds me of the old Big Boys or Dickeys, etc). This nostalgia was compounded by the old country music they were playing (hits from \\"Urban Cowboy\\" and such). I would say they frown on fancy here, but the food presentation belies that. It's an interesting juxtaposition. The restaurant is also pretty small so we were practically up on our neighbors, and I know my waiter's ass brushed me several times in passing (not that I minded :) It got pretty loud in there (but not so loud that our Shazaam couldn't tell us that was Mickey Gilley singing \\"Stand Bah Me\\". Hokey yet appropriate in this setting). \\n\\nSo after our salads, we got a complimentary biscuit served drowning in butter and with honey on the side. Hubby, country boy that he is, prides himself on his history with biskits and he definitely approved of these. \\n\\nAll this foreplay had me squirming in anticipation for the main course. Our choices were a fillet and quail combo (I'd have gone for this but I like my steaks well done which would have rendered a 6 oz fillet the size of a hockey puck), the mahi mahi with mussels and the banana panko encrusted tilapia. Initially I was not that enthused with those choices. There are plenty of really interesting things on the menu I want to go back and try. However, our entrees were stellar! I had a huge fillet of mahi, seasoned well and cooked perfectly moist that was accompanied by sauteed spinach (not mushy at all), a whole heapin pile of mussels and a couple of crawfish flautas. These mussels in particular each had a little piece of tomato inside that rendered them spicy, like a pico. I reluctantly gave hubby five while I ate the other 20 or so, including the biggest one ;). Then I looked around the other tables to see if I could steal some of theirs. They were THAT. GOOD. Best part of my meal...so far. \\n\\nOur waiter then brought the dessert menu. On one side was a list of about 8 cake and pie options and on the other a list of dessert drinks, most with alcohol. Since hubby had already picked the creme brulee and also since I was getting so full, our waiter graciously allowed me to drink my dessert in the form of a chocolate martini. That drink was so panty moistening good, and oddly enough they dimmed the lights right about then and changed the music (Shazaam told us it was the Isley Brothers \\"Between the Sheets\\"...ohhhh yeeeeaaahhhh....). I felt utterly seduced. \\n\\nSo Ranch 616 loved me up with its mussels and finished me off with a chocotini. Ladies, make a reservation, pack a change of undies, and GO!

My friend and I got to catch up with each other, but we were both getting hungry. Finally, the food arrived. \\n\\nWe started off with a petit plats; the house-made gnocchi, English peas, mint, bacon, poached egg. This was wonderfully delicious. Almost like a carbonara, but even richer. Bits of bacon added saltiness to the dish. The house-made gnocchi was also great. \\n\\nFor the main, I got the bouillabaisse in saffron tomato broth. This is one of the better bouillabaisse that I've had. large spot prawns, dungeness crab, large juicy mussels and clams, fish, and a bite of octopus.

The price is way too high for this very low quality sushi. $22.99 for all you can eat dinner. And every piece is a dollar if you leave it on your plate even if you can't stomach the sushi. I decided to leave hungry as i could not finish the disgusting sushi. I left 20 pieces behind. They didn't even bother to ask if everything was fine. No consideration for why i left 20 pieces behind with me knowing it was a dollar a piece. Well their tip from me was the 20 dollar left over sushi charge; i gave 0 tip. Even the ordering was kind of frustrating. I had to share one sushi ordering sheet with my partner sitting across from me so i was uncomfortably trying to read upside down the whole time.

I left a complaint to owner's  voice mail over 3-4 times in the next 3 days regarding this and other humiliating incidents over the past years. But the owner never returned a call. Then the same scoffing  host answered the call once and mentioned about his poor wages for  his poor services cynically; I confronted him for sharing this BS excuse which was not a kind ever to be shared with a customer. \\n\\nI have dined in many  4-5 star restaurants in 30-40 countries and I was never refused or discriminated even when I had to arrived wearing flipflops and shorts. They always tried to accommodate me. And, I was always dressed appropriately when I arrived at Stephanie's to be refused several times. \\n\\nThe food in Stephanie's is good with no doubt. So, if you can put up with the foul attitude attack,  go ahead and enjoy the food. And, if you don't look too glamorous or not so attractive to their DOUBLE STANDARD, to the manager's eyes, be prepared to be treated as secondary. Even though we spend good money and have good appreciation of their food and services, the host/ess can spoil your mood in a second. Please, if mistreated, contact the gen. manager or the owner immediately until they learn this non-sense. \\n----------------------------\\n(+++update: the owner, Stephanie,  the wife of the Jim Sokolove, from TV commercials, called on the 4th day after the incident and after 3 calls.  She assured that this would not happen again and that \\"she never trained her staff to refuse the customers\\" but to ask if they could wait till all the parties arrive. She also denied the table cover charge but to encourage people to order foods. \\n\\nThough we ended the conversation amicably, I didn't believe any of it. Her gen. manager(Leo?) was never on site always to attend the complaint and he never called back until I spoke to the owner. I will only have to see the improvement next time.\\n\\n I just feel sorry for the chefs and friendly Waiter/esses for their hard work being underrated because of the management issues. I keep thinking of the cold Bean town attitude that other out-of-towners talk about with this discrimination.\\n\\n If you haven't notice this, watch this place closely next time and if you see any wrong-doing from the host, say it to their face so that they can see the problem until they improve the service. You never want to feel unwelcome or secondary for what you wear or your gender, skin color you were born with. It is just an awful ignorance, period.\\n\\nYour Asian Neighbor in Back"},{"name":"Knight & Day","address":"9677 King George Hwy","city":"Surrey","stars":"3","text":"We ordered the NY Steak dinner through skip the dishes.

My partner and I went on a Saturday for lunch. We were seated and the server explained that ordering is \\"sushi style\\" meaning everyone takes a card, puts their name on it, and marks the items they want. Tacos are tiny, maybe three bites each, and cost over $1.00 per bite. So we order and when the tacos arrive they're all mixed up on two different plates. What's the point of putting our names on the cards if the orders all get mixed up anyway? Would it really be so hard to keep orders separated? We were also told tacos come out \\"hot and fresh as they're made.\\" Ours all came out at the same time and were room temperature. The carne asada was room temperature, overcooked and dry. We also ordered the salsa trio, and tried all the sauces on the table. Everything was heavily vinegar based and so they all tasted pretty much the same -- like vinegar. Service was friendly but extremely slow. Each time we raised our little card to get the server's attention it was a good ten minutes before she came back. We originally thought we'd get dessert but the food was so unimpressive we decided to skip.

Spicy crab, spicy tuna, crispy onion, cucumber, seared rib eye steak, jalapeno, chili teriyaki, wasabi peas. It was incredibly delicious and all our food was presented so well. At $21, the U.N. is large enough for one person, definitely not two people, but the server advised against ordering anything else. Eight pieces in and I was full!\\n\\nI really love the creativity and energy One Sushi invested in developing their menu. Almost every item is served with a flair while still preserving the authenticity and pride the Japanese have in serving the freshest fish. Service here is also stellar.

I wasn't a big fan of Taco Deli in general for a long time. I stopped in at a N.Lamar location once when I was 19 and in a rush to get to my job. In hindsight, I should have known better than to try so many new things at once (its just not my style). I got the papas, egg, and cheese taco and even though I knew it was mashed potato style, I thought it would hit my craving and it just didn't. Pretty simple, the mashed aspect changes the flavor and texture of a traditional breakfast taco and it just didn't sit right. I was disappointed in how long it took (again, I came in during peak hours when I was already running late) and tried kombucha for the first time...what a mistake. \\n\\nI guess the experience stuck with me and I didn't give them another chance until years later. Although not convenient for me, I do occasionally go to Coffee Bean on another's request. They are a carrier of Taco Deli and desperation one morning had me ordering a Jess Taco. It was amazing. Not only did it taste fantastic but the portion size was consistent with what you would get in store. Another one of my coffee shops recently started carrying Taco Deli and as this new location had just opened up near me, I started frequenting during late start days at work. \\n\\nI specify my need to go only on late start days because the line is almost always out the door on weekends. Even calling in a to-go order usually has me waiting for quite a bit. But they sell it by having friendly staff and great food. My regular order is a jess on flour and a papas, egg, and cheese on flour. Yeah, I started craving what I once couldn't stand.

We bowled a ton, had 3 buckets of beer (5 domestic beers per bucket for ~$17 import was ~$22) and even played laser tag. It was an awesome experience!

My husband had the same reaction to his Chicken, Bacon & Ranch Wrap. He said the ranch dressing was very scarce and the wrap was also dry and uneventful. We both liked the fries, but they could have used a bit more salt or seasoning as well.\\n\\nWe paid the check by debit card, and tipped the waitress in cash 20%. The next day when my husband checked his bank statement, and it showed that the waitress added $6-unauthorized to the check. We took the sales receipt, and the bank statement to Dukes where we asked to speak with the manager. The manager pulled the signed receipt, confirmed the bank statement, making a copy for his records and investigation, and immediately reimbursed the $6. \\n\\nThe manager was extremely approachable and professional, and assured us that he would be addressing the situation immediately. We were very satisfied with his response and have no doubt that whatever happened, innocent mistake or not, that it will be handled. We could feel that he was sincerely troubled and embarrassed by this. I was reluctant to mention it, hence my delay. Being the daughter of a former restaurant/bar owner in Maryland, I know the challenges that come with this industry, so I won't say that we won't be back, but if we do, it will be a little down the road. I hope that they take the constructive criticism from their patrons to improve where they can. If not, it will be very challenging to survive, I suspect, when they are across the highway from a longtime established sports bar, and across the parking lot from another similar sports bar. For my Saint Cloud community, I wish them well."},{"name":"Pho 99 Broadway Tech Centre","address":"2915 Hebb Avenue","city":"Vancouver","stars":"2","text":"I pulled into the parking lot with the intension to run in for a salad at freshii, but then I thought \\"mmmmm pho..\\" \\n\\nThe parking lot is 30 minute max with the disclaimer that it is very closely monitored so I hoped pho would be quick. \\n\\nI was greeted at the door and seated right away.

Fellow Yelper Nekiba M. and I went on Superbowl Sunday afternoon. It was my first time attending this yearly event.  \\n\\nWhen I think of brunch, I think of Mimosas and Bloody Marys accompanied by a good mix of breakfast and lunch food items.  The drinks were in full effect at this event.  Several vendors were there to serve up these delicious brunch cocktails and there was no shortage of them.  Notably, Maker's Mark represented in a big way serving up dee-licious Bloodys and giving away red and blue wax decorated plastic glasses, which they were making on-site.  \\n\\nVendors were also there serving up wine, beer, and other concoctions for your other morning and early afternoon drinking desires.  This includes Dunkin Donuts.  Dunkin was there sharing their new line of Girl Scout Cookies coffee flavors, which were pretty good and do a fine job of tasting like the cookies, if you ask me.  The Dunkin Donuts mascot (big DD cup) was walking about doing his thing.  \\n\\nThey could have used more food vendors at this BRUNCH festival.  I was able to enjoy some amazing shrimp and grits dishes from 101 Concepts restaurant group and Smith's Gourmet Creations.  I have to say that Smith's shrimp and grits were a standout.  I also was able to enjoy some good crepes from Lisa's Creperie, and delicious donuts and glazed bacon from Bon Glaze.  Delights by Dawn impressed me with their alcohol infused cupcakes...yes please!  I loved being introduced to businesses that I hadn't known before.  The problem was that because there were so few food stalls, especially savory food stalls, that the lines were outrageously long.  Like, stupid long.  Also, the two or three savory food stalls were right next to one another, so the lines to what was what were convoluted.  More food stalls please and more spread out... for next time.  \\n\\nI loved how there was plenty of seating in the form of picnic-like tables and in its own area, and there were little tables outside of this area where you could stand up to eat also (but they were swallowed up by the ridiculous lines to the food stalls).  \\n\\nThere was a cute little van in which you could use props to take cute pictures and that I loved.  Also, Maker's Mark had an area for pictures and cute GIFs you could make.  \\n\\nWhat really set the whole thing off, and without which would have lowered by good time exponentially, was the live DJ and the dancing.  It was totally like a broad daylight club in a tent.  I loved it.  The music was good and loud.  People (me) were feeling great (remember I said that the drinks were NOT a problem) and got loose.  So, yeah, we'll go ahead and A+ that part.  \\n\\nIn addition to drink and food vendors there were timeshare resort vendors, skin care vendors, apartment complex vendors, and clothing vendors.  I even saw a d.u.i lawyer's office tent (George Stein) in case you do too much and then decide to drive like a big, gigantic dumb ass.  \\n\\nOh, I got to see the lovely Michelle T. there, who was volunteering. Always good to see fellow Yelpers. \\n\\nI need to mention that I got some booty (not that kind wit yo nasty self!), meaning swag.  A cap, a t-shirt, a hoodie, a baggie, couple bottles of Tevana, couple bottles of Monster energy drink, and two cases (that's right, cases) of Alta Palla sparkling beverages (because they had A LOT left over by the time the event ended and were just handing them out). \\n\\nOverall, I enjoyed this situation and might make it one of my regular festival events.

It definitely adds varieties to the food scene in the village.  This is my second visit and we came here for lunch, we got to try some new items.  \\n\\nI had the Shio Ramen with Rawa Don combo, my friend the Tan Tan Men, and we shared a Cilantro Chicken Karaage.  My ramen was great, just the right firmness for me.  Good flavour of the broth - shio is not as salty/strong as miso, more towards a clear broth.  Best for days when you want something lighter.  Two big slices of cha-siu, a dash of finely chopped green onions, wood-ear mushroom, and slices of orange zest/peel - great setup.  The orange zest really makes the difference, the citrus layers clear your palate from the broth's grease and freshen up the flavour of the broth.  The Tan Tan's broth was also very flavorful, buttery peanut taste, and nicely spicy, I've had a spoonful to taste.  Cilantro chicken karaage is basically chicken karaage topped with a mountain of cilantro and grated daikon - i love these ingredients, cilantro adds an earthy layer while grated daikon makes the karaage less greasy (after a few pieces it matters).  \\n\\nRawa-don is new, and it is Chicken Skin on rice.  This may be a daunting item, but I wanted to try it.  This is added to my ramen set, so even a small bowl was very filling.  I did like it somewhat although honestly I would only order it again if someone wants to share.  The chicken skins were trimmed so fat content was low thankfully lol.  It is stewed (?) then sprinkled with shichimi for a spicy kick.  The texture is, interesting... very soft and mushy but you'll like it if you like chicken skin.  Without feeling overwhelmed, you have to eat it with the rice.  I do like it in the end still, it's simple food that gets to the point but I find it too heavy on its own.  If it was deep-fried or less mushy, I think it'll feel less heavy.  \\n\\nService is great, very prompt and professional. The decor is quite neat, I actually quite like the display inside, like a rack of miniature shoes and two motorbikes.  It has a down to earth, fun, neighborhood-y feel to it.

I think the last time we were here I got a meatball sub and a tuna sub. they were both passable but nothing to write home about. \\n\\nToday I stopped in to give them another try and I'm glad I did.\\n\\nThe website shows they have specials everyday of the week. I was just looking to get a sub without the combo. The website states you can get the super steak and cheese by itself for $7 and the combo for $9.78.\\n\\nWhen I asked Karianna for the $7 super steak and cheese she said that you only get the \\"special\\" when you purchase the combo there (not the sandwich by itself). \\n\\nThe Friday steak and cheese combo is actually $8.50. So for a total of $9.10 you get the super steak and cheese sandwich with a 20 oz fountain drink and a bag of chips. Overall, I can't complain because it's still cheaper than the $9.78 the website shows for the super cheesesteak combo.\\n\\nWith that said, my sandwich was the bomb! Super hot & fresh cheese steak on whole wheat bun. I added tomatoes, sweet Pickle's, banana peppers, green peppers and black olives (there's no extra cost for cold toppings). Karianna hooked it up! I will definitely be back for more. \\n\\nThe restaurant was clean and the tables were all wiped down which I appreciate. There were no trash receptacles overflowing and you can tell the staff cared about what they're doing.\\n\\nIt looks like they recently made over the inside of the restaurant but they could replace some of the ceiling tiles that are stained.

Not a problem, as we were expecting it - plus lots to see in this neighborhood.

It felt like we were the last table to be taken in before they closed their doors for the evening - we even watched them flip the 'Open' sign to 'closed'.  A few people off the street walked in to order take-away, which is a great option when there's a packed house!  The dining area is beyond massive, (almost like a hall, rather than a restaurant) - but the decorations and color palate kept it feeling clean and intimate, instead of commercial.\\n\\nThe menu is a picture book of sorts, with the large images of the dish (really beautiful images, I must say), and the names written underneath in both Chinese and English.  Normally, I'm turned off by this sort of menu, clearly aimed at tourists (which, we 100% were), but appreciated it in the moment, since the restaurant was so incredibly busy.  It's really large, with plenty of offerings under various titles including; dumplings (duh), appetizers, entrees, rice, noodles, soups, desserts, and breakfast - not to mention specials and chefs suggestions.\\n\\nOur waitress arrived to our table almost immediately, and asked if we knew what we wanted - thanks to our wait, we did!  We ordered a couple dishes and picked a imported beer from their menu to pair with our food.  They were unfortunately out of the first beer we had selected, but picked a different one instead - neither of us knowing much about that imported beer, I don't think we even had a preference.  They offered 4 types of imported beers, so the decision wasn't too difficult.\\n\\nDishes consumed below:\\n// Edamame appetizer : We were starving and inhaled this in about 0.05 seconds - perfectly salty and umami, the beer paired really well with these little buggers.  The seasoning was simple yet delicious.\\n// Steamed pork soup buns : the obvious favorite of the evening.  Six to an order, with a perfectly thin and soft dumpling casing - the inside is HOT, but delicious.  Had to be careful picking them up, so as not to break them before slurping all the soup!\\n// Pork buns : glad we ordered these - similar to the dumpling, but with a thicker wrapper.  Somehow more bao-like.  Very good!\\n// Stir fry shredded beef with green onions in soy sauce : wasn't expecting much from this dish, but it was really delicious! Not overly salty, yet really flavorful.  The shoots and onions brightened up the flavor of the dish, adding a fresh and crunchy element - yum!\\n\\nI would definitely come back and eat about 100 more dumplings!"},{"name":"Velvet Taco Domain","address":"11501 Rock Rose Ave, Ste 160","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Awesome awesome place!

It has a combination on delicious sauces combined with veggies and, of course, fried cheese! You just can't lose with it.

We were all starving and didn't want to continue roaming Austin looking for another place, so we sat down. We ordered drinks instantly, but our waitress took almost a half hour to come by our table and take our food order. Why? I have no idea. At this point, the restaurant started filling up. A few of my friends had the fish tacos, one had the divorced trout, and I had the chicken fried beef tenderloin. The portions are enormous! The tacos, I heard, were \\"meh,\\" as was the trout. My dish was great, but you really cannot go wrong with fried. The beef was so good, but I could've gone without the shrimp. The bacon-cheese mashed potatoes were on point. What I liked was that they also brought out biscuits with honey...though they were brought out way after our entrees arrived instead of before. Whatever.\\n\\nIf we had left at this point, my review would've still been three-stars. Here's why it's not.

We looked at it like \\"HUH?!\\" So we hail our waitress back and said we weren't ready and wanted a dessert menu. Her response: \\"You guys needed to be out by 7:15.\\" WHAT THE F***! WHAT KIND OF SERVICE IS THAT? YOU ARE KICKING PAYING CUSTOMERS OUT OF YOUR RESTAURANT WHEN IT TOOK YOU A HALF HOUR TO TAKE OUR ORDER? Not our fault you're slow and don't pay attention. So she gave us a menu and we ordered a chocolate cake. At this point, that same man who was at the table when we first walked in saw what was going on and that we were clearly upset. He came to our table and asked us if we'd mind moving outdoors to the patio because he needs to seat his reservations. We said yes, and walked out on to a COMPLETELY EMPTY PATIO! Okay, maybe three tables were occupied but ARE YOU SERIOUSLY TELLING US YOU COULND'T HAVE SEATED US WHEN THERE WERE EMPTY TABLES INDOORS WHEN WE GOT THERE, AND THE ENTIRE OUTDOOR AREA EMPTY BY THE TIME WE LEFT?!

This place is so Portland it might just make you wear a beard, start bathing in Stumptown coffee, and protest something corporate, but that's not a slam. Portland makes great food. \\n\\nSo the flagship sandwich for me is the Pork Belly Cubano. It's ridiculous. I'm also a huge fan of the Roast Beef and the Italian Cured Meats. I'm pretty sure all the sandwiches come with a small bag of Kettle Chips, which makes me remember the days when it used to be a bag of chips in a greasy lil' bag. I'm not fer shure that this wasn't just the same chips before, and hell this might have just been a cost thing. I dunno.  Allz I'm sayin is I've been coming here for awhile, yo. \\n\\nIf you get the chance then try the breakfast sandwich with sausage. On its best day it is a triumphant celebration of sweet and delicious fennel-smelling sausage patty delights, a beautiful Sunnyside egg, and a delightful Kaiser poppy seed roll, with some wondrous white cheddar. On its worst day it's still all that stuff, just turned to \\"9\\" not to \\"11\\".  \\n\\nA little small and cloistered in here. Hot and smoky like an old timey card room, and very little seating.

I took a bite of the meat and it was bland and flavorless. I couldn't believe my taste buds. How can this short rib been braised so long and taste like nothing??? I cut another piece from the other side of the rib and same result. At this point I was like eating short rib that was probably braised in plain water since it has no salt or any kind of flavor. The pork ribs was full of flavors and this short rib has NONE. I had a hard time eating it without a sauce and it didn't come with one.

They have two different dining areas and at lunch they only open the one on the right.  The restaurant has a full service bar.  On my first visit I had the baked rigatoni.  The sauce was amazing, not too sickly sweet and not over seasoned.  They are not stingy with their servings either.  They also serve a sourdough roll with your meal with butter.  My only complaint is I prefer my butter to be easy to spread and these came out hard.  The first time I came although there were only about six tables, it appeared that there was only one server for the whole dining room.  She was moving as quickly as she could but it took quite awhile for me to give my order and to receive my meal.  However, my second experience was much different as my wait time was a lot less.  On my second visit I ordered the ravioli.  Again, a huge serving so plenty to take home.  It was nicely filled and covered in that delicious sauce.  I'm not sure if they make their own pasta themselves but it sure didn't seem like it had been frozen but really fresh tasting.

So our very first time at Bakery Corner, we were excited to try a new breakfast/brunch place near our home, since we don't have very many GREAT breakfast spots around our neighborhood. After hearing all the hype about it. We decided to take a chance. After all, that's how you try new places is by word of mouth. Our food experience as first timers, I was disappointed after having such high hopes. We were hoping it would become one of our favorite breakfast go to's and tell everyone about it. Not so much. More work needs to be done. Especially on the cook side. \\n\\nMy husband and I, both ordered the exact same thing. The buttermilk pancakes with eggs, substitute bacon for sausage. When we got our food. Both plates had lukewarm eggs cooked at a toddlers temp and sausages that you can complete tell were microwaveable ones, rather than cooked on the grill or pan fried. They were tough, dry and stale, it made Jimmie Dean's microwaveable sausages taste and look better than theirs. And that's saying a lot. The only thing we enjoyed besides the customer service, was the buttermilk pancakes. That's why I gave it a 2 stars. They were served fresh and hot, as the eggs and sausages should have been. If breakfast is served like this, what makes me want to come back and even try lunch or dinner to only be setup for disappointment again?

Service was fine, we got our water & tea refilled through the meal and were able to flag down our server as needed\\n\\nWe ordered:\\n- Lotus root with sticky rice - one that my friend was excited about but was totally novel to me... It was lotus root, braised or steamed so that it absorbed the sweet sauce and cooked the sticky rice inside. Sliced thinly so everyone could have a few slices. \\n- Ox tail & beef tripe cold dish - served cold (intenionally) and covered in Sichuan chili oil, enough to capture the ma-la (numbing) spice flavor, without being terribly spicy. \\n- Scallion oil noodles - served with green onion and ground pork.. a hint of sweetness but apparently that's how they are meant to be. The noodles were nicely cooked, thin enough to be wrapped in flavor with a satisfying chew. The freshness of the green onions was appreciated through the flavorful oil\\n- Dandan noodles - served with ground pork, mala spicy oil, and sesame paste.. some green onions for freshness. Although the sauce was bit salty and spicy, but I happily would have eaten the whole tub of rice to go along with it..\\n- green beans - classic Chinese dish that's really hard to make at home. They did a good job with this\\n- Kou shui ji -aka mouthwatering chicken - steamed chicken is covered in flavorful Sichuan pepper oil. I think I was too full to enjoy this by the time it came out.

Yum!! My favorite was the beef Negimaki. What is Negimaki? It is thin and tender strips of beef wrapped around asparagus, green onion and shrimp and simmered in teriyaki sauce.

However, I do have to point out that the softness of the meat was perfect. Typically, the broth makes the ramen and in this case, it was not up to par with other average ramen joints. So in conclusion, I wouldn't go back a second time; they're not the best nor are they above average, but I've definitely had worse.\\n\\nA side note.. the environment and the condition that the restaurant was in is pretty worn out.. the tables and chairs are visibly old and so was the bathroom.

My husband and I have been to some of the most reknowned michelin star rated restaurants and are very familiar to this style of dining but found ourselves trapped on a 3+ hour ride we couldn't get off of. It was devistating because it was supposed to be a nice birthday dinner for my husband but was a total fail. To be fair, the wine selection was phenomenal and their froie gras was very good but everything else fell flat and was not fresh. They had a variety of raw fish supposedly flown in from a fish market in Japan that they served with no sauce or spice what so ever and was obviously days old (tough and fishy). Literally made us gag. Multiple plates they sent out were like this and so bad we couldn't take more than one taste. Everything they served was a strange animal part (which is fine if it tastes amazing because I can get over the mental hurtle) but it was ALL gamey or off. By the time we got to dessert, my stomach was turning and the baby eclair with matcha that tasted like fish was the last straw so we politely asked for our bill before the rest of the courses arrived.  The kicker was having to try and sign our bill of $500 with a pen that kept falling apart that was an advertisement for a birthday performer \\"Shecky The Clown\\". Not to mention the tiny bathroom looked like something you'd see in a dive bar on the coast. So yeah, it was bad. We were supposed to go out for a while longer after dinner but were so torqued we just went home to try and sleep it all off. We just don't get it.... maybe we hit an off night there or something but it's really too bad.

Both dishes were amazing and if you are looking for spicy I highly recommend these two items! Yup we went to a restaurant known for dumplings and didn't order any dumplings.  My take on it is that you have to have it fresh and take out isn't going to be the same, especially if you have to reheat the food  They have an assembly line that you can watch through the glass kitchen windows constantly making fresh dumplings..

It has always been a special treat to visit.  As a long standing business in the Columbus area, it becomes a place where you develop fond memories with all the special occasions.\\n\\nI recently took a friend out to celebrate a birthday.  The Polaris Grill provided the same great atmosphere, service and food that I have come to expect.  The restaurant is very easy to see as you are headed north bound on I-71 and taking the Polaris exit.   Maneuvering to access the restaurant is not as obvious, if you are not familiar with its location.  Signs are not as prevalent and its standalone building is tucked behind a hotel.  \\n\\nI too love their 55 Salad.  This is the same salad from the ol' 55 restaurant days.  I have been a fan of it for years ... baby lettuce topped with real bacon, blue cheese, tomato and onion ... what really makes the salad is their dressing.  Others love their Aztec Chowder, but it is a bit spicy for my taste.  \\n\\nThe service was spot-on.   From the front reception to our server and all the other staff, the team was attentive, upbeat and professional.   Our waitress was quite engaging and ensured everything was going well without being overly obtrusive.  The dining room's ambience is contemporary.  Lighting was lowered but not so much that you could not read the menu's.   There were two specials for the evening ... a pecan encrusted sea bass and a 14 oz prime rib.   We jumped at the options for the specials as they sounded so tempting.  I'm glad we did.  Both dishes were prepared well, tasty and very satisfying meals!    I know I will be back again."},{"name":"Pisces Rising","address":"239 W 4th Ave","city":"Mount Dora","stars":"3.5","text":"We'd waited a while to try Pisces Rising due to the mixed reviews. Last night we finally decided to give them a shot and seated ourselves on the back deck. The deck itself looked to be in need of renovation. It looked like they'd added some granite but the wooden beams, tables and chairs were very worn. The umbrellas were all cinched up and the view of the lake was obstructed by them as well as power lines and buildings. Still, you can see a small sliver of the lake and there was a nice breeze. \\n\\nService was above average. Our server admitted that she wasn't too familiar with the menu as it had just changed days before. She did have a couple recommendations which we took into account. First, on a Sunday early evening there were no happy hour specials- too bad. We had some glasses of wine and chose a sampling of dishes to share. We started off the the spinach salad ($12) which came with goat cheese, berries and almonds. My first impression of it was that it looked like something I would make at home. Once we moved past the top layer of spinach we could see the bottom bits were soggy and wilted. Not wanting to be \\"that guy\\" but also not wanting a nasty $12 salad we sent it back. Not going well so far! \\n\\nNext came the hot apps. We tried the calamari which was cooked well and served with a marinara dipping sauce. There wasn't really anything special about it so I probably wouldn't order it again. We also tried a tamale which had a good flavor but was very small. The pork was tender and had a good flavor but there wasn't more than a couple of bites of the thing. The stand out of the meal was the entree of pork and scallops. Although again the portion was modest the pork was cooked to perfection and could be cut like butter. The scallops were large and also seasoned and cooked perfectly. Over the dish was a peach sauce with slices of peaces with cinnamon- it was delicious! We could have eaten another one of these as their were only 3 scallops and 4 bits of pork.\\n\\nFinally for dessert we ordered the creme brulee (free thanks to the Yelp check in offer) and bananas foster. Unfortunately they were not able to do the bananas foster table-side on the back deck due to the wind. The creme brulee was white chocolate and key lime flavored. It was very good with the warm crisp sugared crust atop cool smooth custard. The bananas foster was must less impressive, I wouldn't order it again. It was basically four scoops of vanilla ice cream with too few slices of bananas and sauce. Bananas are cheap, give more with this dessert!\\n\\nIf it hadn't been for the phenomenal pork and scallop entree Pisces Rising would have barely earned a 3/5 star. However, our server did a good job, although I think a manager should have come to speak to us about the salad. The apps were mediocre and I'd skip the bananas foster next time and try one of the other made-in-house desserts. The inside dining room appeared to be much more formal than the back deck. Out back you could get away with shorts, inside you'd better dress up a little more. Unfortunately they allow smoking on the deck which non-smokers have to tolerate if you want to enjoy a nice evening outside. Overall a good, but pricey, experience."},{"name":"Doc Chey's Dragon Bowl","address":"1556 N Decatur Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"I come here quite often and the food is either great or terrible depending on what you get. I've tried the various rice bowls (build your own with rice; Korean bibimbap) and thought they were one of the most horrible things ever because they are so dry and bland. The salad type bowls garden bowl, superfood bowl, and build your own with kale salad) are pretty good because they provide a good serving of fresh and tasty veggies. As for the protein options, the tofu and pork belly are both delicious. The grilled chicken is usually dry and also tasteless. I've only tried the grilled ribeye in the Korean bibimbap and it was such a bad experience that I've never ordered it as a protein again. As for vegetables, the crispy brussel sprouts are fantastic as well as the roasted sweet botatoe and zucchini. The broccoli was ok but not great. My favorite garnish is the sweet pickles. The Japenese ramen soup is also not bad. I built my own bowl with ramen noodles once but didn't like it (it was a dry noodle dish). They also had a seasame noodle dish as a special once that was very good. Wish they brought that back more often.\\n\\nThey have a Karma lunch special which includes a beverage. The dragon water is interesting and I like it but wish that there was less (or no) sugar. Overall, a good spot for lunch/dinner although I think the food tastes fresher when dining in.

They have around 15 or so food items to pick from. \\n\\nI also had a huge craving for paella one day, so I ordered the \\"small\\" portion of this dish here. The small portion + some happy hour dishes was enough to fill me, but you may want to consider the large portion if you have bigger appetites or aren't getting any apps.

The leg is really difficult to eat. And even though it is really big, with all the cartilage and tendons there is really not much meat to eat.

The biscuits are amazing ! And the bloody Mary's are flavorful! Great staff  definitely coming back when we visit again ."},{"name":"Velvet Taco Domain","address":"11501 Rock Rose Ave, Ste 160","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"My mind was blown here. I didn't think you could create such unique tacos... AND have them taste amazing. Case in point: my tacos, haha. I ordered a spicy tikka chicken taco, which was pretty spicy actually (I'd say 7/10), but the rice balanced it out very well, and the shrimp and grits taco, which tasted JUST like shrimp and grits. I would have ordered more but those two alone were very filling. Combine great tacos with a chill, friendly ambiance, and I honestly can't wait to come across this place again during my future travels."},{"name":"Texican Cafe - Manchaca","address":"11940 Manchaca Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"My husband and I walked in and it automatically smelled like cigarette smoke or an old bar. I thought \\" maybe its because its next to Stardust bar\\" and ignored it. The place was dead. There were a group of wait staff sitting and folding napkins. Another red flag.. Why was this place dead on a Saturday night? We got seated right away ofcourse, and not only was our table dirty but you could see old food underneath and right by our table. The table was sticky and dirty as well. My husband and I looked at each other and decided to split. Didn't try the food but I honestly didn't care to with the environment being so dirty. The texican off S. Lamar is GREAT and that's exactly where we headed."},{"name":"El Patron Mexican Restaurant & Cantina","address":"12167 S Apopka Vineland Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"First time visiting and they were having an all you can eat buffett for lunch.  $10.5 adults & $6 kids.

Any time before or even during work I can walk on over and order coffee. I usually get the cafe con leche iced its the perfect amount of coffee, milk and sweetness! You pay what you want here but they do have like an amount you should pay for usually this goes for 4-6 dollars which isn't bad. It's deff not as bitter tasting like other places which is great. The staff always seems to be happy and helpful which is a plus! Today I got the hot version of the cafe con leche and it was great. You can build up points here and get rewards ... todays coffee was on them which is totally awesome!"},{"name":"Bartaco Boulder","address":"1048 Pearl St","city":"Boulder","stars":"4","text":"Ehh ok taco place mainly a bar not a place you go to just get tacos.

Oh how I miss the waddling ducks. \\n\\nAttached to the convention center, this hotel is perfect for convention goers.  The ease of walking over under the covered walkway is a plus. \\n\\nThe rooms are fine-nothing great, but the TVs are huge. My one beef is that the walls are so thin. I could hear my neighbor's iPhone alarm going off in the morning, their TV and their extra curricular activities. I was in Tower 1 but I hear tower 2 is newer and the walls aren't as thin. For the price point, I would expect more."},{"name":"Asian Diner","address":"835 Cypress Pkwy","city":"Poinciana","stars":"3","text":"The food is nothing out of this world there service is the crapy we order delivery and they didn't even brought us the utensils to eat with and when called they said they would bring them for a delivery charg of $4 for plastic forks I would not recomend."}]`),R={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:P},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:6,poemsData:O,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.poemsData.filter(n=>{const e=this.searchQuery.toLowerCase();return n.name.toLowerCase().includes(e)||n.city.toLowerCase().includes(e)||n.text.toLowerCase().includes(e)}).slice(0,this.visibleCount):this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},E={class:"search-container"},H={class:"card-container"},D=["disabled"],j={key:0},N={key:1};function G(n,e,s,f,i,r){const c=p("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"üéâ Restaurant Reviews ü•≥")])],-1)),t("div",E,[e[2]||(e[2]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"üîç",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=h=>i.searchQuery=h),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[v,i.searchQuery]])]),t("div",H,[(a(!0),o(y,null,m(r.filteredPoems,(h,g)=>(a(),k(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),r.hasMorePoems?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:i.isLoading,onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=(...h)=>r.loadMore&&r.loadMore(...h))},[i.isLoading?(a(),o("span",N,"Loading...")):(a(),o("span",j,"See more"))],8,D)):w("",!0)])}const F=u(R,[["render",G],["__scopeId","data-v-6c958184"]]),V=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotesmag/51.md","filePath":"quotesmag/51.md"}'),q={name:"quotesmag/51.md"},Y=Object.assign(q,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(a(),o("div",null,[I(F)]))}});export{V as __pageData,Y as default};
