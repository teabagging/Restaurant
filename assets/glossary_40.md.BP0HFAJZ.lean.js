I didn't get my BBQ until 12 but it was worth the wait. If it's going to be a hot day, bring an umbrella and cold water (they have free water too). Also if you're going to wait a long time (they don't open until 11am) bring a chair or towel to sit on. Thinking about it now, I wish I had brought a towel to take a nap on. If you get here early enough, you'll be lucky to wait in the shade...but if not you're screwed waiting in the hot sun. Luckily, nearby there are shades areas but you'd have to take turns with a friend so that no one steals your spot. There's one fan closer to the building but it only reaches about ten people closest to it. There's also a little coffee truck nearby where you can buy iced coffee! I'd recommend iced coffee since it's super hot out. The coffee stand is literally right next door of the restaurant. They also have a fan at the coffee stand, so go there to cool off! We ordered their baby back ribs, brisket, and sausage links. BEST BBQ I've ever had. Very flavorful and moist. Definitely worth the HYPE. Make sure to get the sides, although it does end up being a lot of food. We ended up eating half of what was on our plate. Next time, I will probably order less. They also gave us free bred slices on the side. I think mainly to use as a grease sponge, but you can use it to make a sandwich. Thought it was kind of funny, but awesome.

The pulled pork was cooked far too long, lacked juice and seasoning, and didn't have the greatest portion. It sat on top of a slice of Texas wonderbread. The catfish was just okay; nothing out of the ordinary. Could have used cajun seasoning to be honest. The brisket was too fatty for my taste. The sides I ordered were collard greens and corn bread. The greens were acceptable and came with pot liquor, but the corn bread was completely stale. The pecan pie was pretty good I should say.

Even MacDonald's is better.\\nAnd on top of all that; the layout of the restaurant was terrible.  It was way too cramped.  I was there at 6:30 on a Tuesday night.  It wasn't crowded - it was cramped.  We had to get up from our seats while waiting for our food every time someone needed to use the restroom.  To go to the upstairs dining room you have to wait while people come down.  it was nearly impossible to fit through the tiny maze of tables.

I'm still not sold on it, but I'm still optimistic for the future. During my first trip, I tried the crap dip and the sushi. I wasn't impressed with either one, but I WAS impressed by the milk shakes. The rice krispie shake was delicious. On the next visit, I branched out to the Bento boxes. This time, I really enjoyed my meal - a mini burger and half a sushi roll (Mark's roll) plus spicy cucumbers, sweet potato fries and edamame? What a combination! On my final trip, we waited 90 minutes just to be seated after being told it would be a 60-70 minute wait. Once we were finally seated, I stuck to the Bento box but ordered the slightly cheaper box with a spicy tuna roll. While everything tasted great, I didn't think this meal was worth the $15.99 price tag. I'll stick to the Fusion box for $17.99 with a more elaborate roll for my money. I'm still planning to give Cowfish another shot, because I need to try out the burgers. In the scheme of City Walk, Cowfish and Vivo are definitely the best options.

When I got the bill and inquired about the charge for chips, the waitress informed us that it was a new policy they instituted on January 1st. She pointed out that was a card on the table saying chips and salsa were $2.50, but she should have mentioned it when she asked us if we wanted chips.

Best lobster roll I've had in a while."},{"name":"Franklin Barbecue","address":"900 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"We were in Austin for the 1st time so of course we needed to go to Franklin Barbecue to taste for ourselves if it was worth the wait.  I know, I know, I would never wait 3-4 hours for food any other time.\\nWe'd seen the hype on travel and food channels.  My husband loves to Barbecue so I bought him the Franklin Barbecue A Meat-Smoking Manifesto for his birthday last year.  He read it from cover to cover and finished it before our trip.  We planned our visit for Thursday, supposedly their slowest day.  We arrived at 8:50 am to find the line well into the parking lot.  People were sitting in chairs and just waiting for the 11:00 am opening.  A guy came down the line answering questions so I asked where to rent the chairs.  The complimentary chairs were all gone but he advised us to go to CVS on the corner to purchase chairs for the long wait.  I sent my husband while I held our place in line.Upon my husband's return with fold out camp chairs in hand, the line had grown much longer behind us.  In the group behind us there were 2 Austinites and 2 of their friends visiting from Oklahoma.  We passed the time chatting with them.  When I took a bathroom break, I decided to see where the line started.  I asked the girl at the front of the line what time she got in line and she answered 6:10 am.  Holy sh*t!  Why?  Turns out that she lives in Austin and had never been to Franklin's.  I asked, \\"Why now?\\"  She pointed to the 2 girls next to her, cousins from out of town.  As we were chatting she gave me other BBQ places in town without the wait.  I told her that she would need to report back if it was worth the wait.11:00 am, doors open and the line moves up.  My husband chats with Benji, the Dude, the general manager and we purchase beers for the rest of the wait.  Breakfast beer!  By 12:00 pm we finally make it into the restaurant and 1st in line is just finishing up.  I said \\"Hey, 1st in line, how was it, was it worth the wait?\\"  They all gave me a thumbs up.  Then the Austinite tells me to forget about all of the other BBQ spots that she gave me to bookmark.  This was the best.12:15 pm, up at the counter and we ordered...\\nBarbecue Beef Brisket.  O.M.G., this is the best we've had to date and we are ruined for life.\\nPork Ribs.  Smokey goodness!\\nSausages.  Tasty.\\nPotato Salad.  Very good.\\nColeslaw.  Refreshing contrast to all of that meat.By 1:05 pm, the sad sold out sign went up.  Whatever, we got ours!  After we finished we also got to check out where the magic happens with the pit master.  Very impressive!  Everyone from the line girls, the GM, counter crew and pit master were so nice.Here's my take, if it's your 1st time, do the wait, it's part of the experience.  If you either live in Austin or you've been here already, get your friends together and order on-line for scheduled pick up to go.Yes, it was worth the wait!P.S.  The Key Lime Pie from Cake and Spoon that we ended up eating later was amazing!"},{"name":"Fox Bros. Bar-B-Q","address":"1238 Dekalb Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Great Texas BBQ.

The now redesigned Charlies has ramped-up the charm by changing to a tapas bistro. The menu has 30 plus small dish servings that the customer can combine 2-3 inexpensive orders, share with companion(s), and only order and eat what is enough. (I really get tired to hauling home leftovers which are rarely as good the second day.) Everything we ordered is prepared for best taste but the waitperson and chef will alter selections based on customers' individual modifications. The wine selection for individual drinks could use expansion for diners but there is a fully appointed bar for all the call drinks and several house specials. My wife wanted a drink no longer on the current menu and after playing guessing games with Casey, a very friendly person waiting on us, they finally got the name and made the drink, no problem. Previously, there had been a TV which I was glad to see replaced by a mirror since the atmosphere does not really invite television viewers. (If you need TV at meals, pretty much every other restaurant has one playing.) On our last visit, my wife and I shared a cheese place, a meat plate, house salad, and cup of soup each.  Soup and cheese were tops, maple duck was yummy, and tomato soup was super-delicious. I made the mistake of also ordering the wonderful Brussels sprouts with walnuts but it was one dish too many. We were a little TOO stuffed.

When I go during breakfast hours it seems to be fine, it's just dinner that they constantly forget or mess an order up.Since that review, we no longer go to this location. We kept going because it was the closest one but countless times they have forgot things we have ordered and even paid for. It's unacceptable. I shouldn't have to go inside EVERY time and get what we forgot. Order a Cabana Sampler and they forget the taco or the enchilada. Ask for salsa and pico and you don't get it.

Something about controlling how much broth you get with your noodles gives you a sense of power and strength that you don't get with normal daily activities. The broth was rich as Donald Duck's uncle, but the flavors somehow balanced it out and made it enjoyable. The chashu is also some of the best I've ever had having a great balance between the meaty portions and the fatty portions. Overall great experience with amazing food would recommend to anyone.

The atmosphere is somewhat dim and the decor is local punk rock show flyers from throughout the ages hanging on the walls. The wait staff is always really nice, and cute too if you are into the \\"scene girl, hipster\\" type of look (which works for me.) The seating could be a bit more comfortable, but I am not expecting to sit back and relax for a while when I am going to a burger joint, even a decent sit-down one like this. They have an awesome patio, but I can't imagine its incredibly popular to sit back there during certain parts of the year.I have always been fairly picky about the type of pickles that I like, but Foster Burger has a pretty awesome pickled plate for anyone who is into that type of thing. The burgers are big, and customizable. I have never really understood why some places serve fries separately from their burgers, but I can understand why they would here as every time I order fries as well as the burger I always end up feeling like I am rolling myself out of the place. The buns they use are fresh from the bakery next door which I think is really awesome, and they always use good quality meat. The fries are pretty average, but I know some people who are crazy about the Black and White fries. Just about any burger, or anything else you order up on the menu here won't disappoint. Make sure to come hungry.Their happy hour prices aren't much better than their regular pricing, but that doesn't bother me - their pricing is really good to begin with. The drinks are usually pretty good, but the beer could be more cold. Honestly though? I have been served warmer beers with much worse food and managed to get by, so this doesn't take away from the experience for me.One thing is for sure, I will definitely continue to frequent Foster Burger because of the convenience, and the damn good food.

Each time I have visited has been a good experience. One of the first times I visited was when I dined during dinner with a group of about 10 people with a reservation. They were able to accommodate our table on a busy weekend dinner night. We just had to wait a few minutes for them to finish setting our table, and the lobby was not very big so it is a good thing we didn't have to wait too long. Dinner entrees range from $17-40. Once we were seated, the waiter was quick and friendly. For dinner I have tried their √©touff√©e. I thought it was just alright, the portion was a good amount, and I enjoyed the flavor and spices in this seafood stew. However, I think that the √©touff√©e at Montage has a more bold and rich flavor that I like better. I have also tried Jake's seafood linguini, which was tasty and well prepared.  I have also dined during happy hour with my husband on a different occasion. They have a good and cheap happy hour menu. I enjoyed the oysters, mussels, clams. The only bad experience I had was on New Years Eve a few years ago when I came with my husband and 4 other friends for dinner. We ordered some oysters on the half shell to share. When the oysters came out, they were extremely small and poorly shucked, a few of us got bits of shell in our mouths. However on the flip side for that same evening: One of my friends is dairy free, and while we all enjoyed our ice cream and cake desserts, the waitress was kind enough to bring out a complementary dairy free fruit sorbet for my friend to enjoy as well. We thought that was kind of her, and it almost made up for the poorly shucked tiny oysters we had during dinner.Overall Jake's is a good choice for happy hour seafood in Portland, and I plan on visiting again in the future for dinner and happy hour."},{"name":"La Cava del Tequila","address":"1200 Epcot Resort Blvd","city":"Lake Buena Vista","stars":"4.5","text":"Paid $36 for two quickly made but strong drinks then was given the bums rush out the door and told everyone was in the to-go line.

If you don't want to pay money for over-priced snacks or candy bars, then bring some from home. This place has a nice selection of salads, fruit, chocolate, locally sourced products from New England (chocolates, cookies, nuts, maple syrup), smoothies, juices, and coffee. Yes, it's kind of like Whole Foods on steroids, but if you don't want to pay a premium for slightly healthier foods, then you should go to Hudson News for snacks or McDonalds for a breakfast sandwich.Smoothies were $7-8, and this was open early; I had a 6 am flight, and this was open by 5:30 am. The service at the counter is a bit slow, and the smoothies take a while to make, so don't come here if you don't have a little of extra time to spare.Not my favorite establishment in the world - there are better food places in other airports - but certainly not bad, and worth another visit next time I'm in the Boston airport."},{"name":"Screen Door","address":"2337 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"By far worth the wait this place is amazing!!

I've eaten stuff that I can't pronounce (or doesn't even have an Engrish translation), on dares, and that has absolutely turned my g/f's stomach.  When all is said and done, only one thing matters....did I like it? The answer here is a definite yes.  I've only been here three times and maybe I got lucky, but the Dan Dan Noodles were always great; I guess it's possible they went downhill for awhile and went back to the original recipe.  Maybe they did a doctored up version of the House Noodles because I talked to the waitress about what I liked or did not -- funny thing I have found is if you don't act like a jacka.. and talk to the wait staff like they are human, good surprises happen -- but either way there was nothing left on the plate.  The Ma Po Tofu was surprisingly ok; I wouldn't say great, but I'll admit I'm not a Tofu fan, and this is one of the only dishes I like it in, so an \\"ok\\" is a compliment.While I was there, I also remember my friends ordering some pig parts soup which was good, just a tad bit to salty for my taste, and something that sounded like it was off the menu of every other Chinese menu, and that was very tasty.  We also did one of the shaved ice fruit desserts and it was a nice ending touch to a meal.  I don't get the decor, but it's kinda neat to look at.

Matter of fact, you won't hear, see or smell much of those familiar nuances that (aside from the food) lures most of us into dim sum houses.AMBIANCE:\\nAlthough the decor is well executed, it seems too contrived for what it is, and frankly, it just doesn't feel right in there.  This is Portland.  If I want to see colorful banners hung up high, I know where to look.  Allow your food / service speak for itself, not your interior.  That should only be an added bonus.  At least the music remains the standard Chinese songs you'd expect.\\nSERVICE :\\nPlease fire and rehire.   You don't change the structure of dim sum only to fail in it's most basic concept - Selecting and Receiving your food \\"HOT\\" and instantly if not very, very promptly. ( I must say though, the verbiage used while interacting with the six(?!) different servers was impressive.  You are spoken to like a \\"King\\", however, I'd rather listen to broken English and get my damn food in a timely manner than the other way around. )  Almost forgot, there are at least two copies of your order taped to your tablecloth.  Perhaps a ticket hanging in the kitchen as well.  One + Two = Three.  It's elementary, So why is it that I had 2 sets of dishes not brought out yesterday?  Was it because we were a table of three at a time when there was only one other party dining?  Stop wasting paper and BRING ME MY FOOD!!PORTION VS. PRICE:Now I've been to the SE location a multitude of times, I was expecting  same price and similar portion sizing.  To my astonishment, I was given 4 pieces of shrimp in each Hai Gao, Chicken feet the length of my ring finger-to-my-palm, and Shu Mai that actually had to be eaten in two separate pieces.  So the size was there, it was the flavor that lacked.  Thus I returned today, and sadly, same story.\\nAs for pricing, you'll pay more than usual spots, maybe 20% more.  Actually 35% more because for our \\"PARTY OF 3\\", we were automatically taxed a 15% gratuity fee.  (no further comments)THE LAST THOUGHT:Before getting Snazzy with your display case of trinkets and serving water out of crystal glasses, take a look at what makes a dim sum restaurant such a integral part of Chinese Culture.

The octopus was ok but hard to cut.    Might have been a bit overdone.  Flavour was ok though.The green enchilada dish looked promising.   Presentation was good and portion size was good.

It's relatively simple seasonings, great crust, great smokiness. I'm too used to commercialized Rudy's and eating their extra moist due to my friends liking that place too much but I was very surprised and pleased that this place's brisket had better flavor while tasting less fatty. Score.The ribs were also simply seasoned, but absolutely fall off the bone moist and tender. I think it could have used a bit more ooph, but for a purist, it had the earmarks of quality carefully smoked ribs.Which leads me to the sauce. The espresso sauce is awesome, something you just gotta try. Don't soak your meat liberally in it; just a dab here and there to help you appreciate it.The sausage in retrospect I could do without. The flavor is good but its a little on the dry side (at least the one I had was).Would it be worth the wait if I went? Not sure if I have that kind of time on my hand.

I tried the below food:\\n- Fried Green Tomatoes - delicious with the creamy goat cheese fried inside!\\n- Chicken Livers - not my favorite app, but prepared very well with the creamed corn\\n- PORK BBQ scallion-grits hoecake - huge portion size!  horseradish coleslaw on top was fabulous!  The pulled pork was the best pork I've eaten in my life! Was so tender and melts in your mouth, the bbq sauce was sooo delicious.My favorite App on the menu was the RAISED RED BEETS salad w/ smoked goat cheese, arugula, pistachio gremolata.  OMG this beet salad was phenomenal.  Huge portion size, lots of goat cheese, and the pistachios were soaked in a type of oil sauce that was drop dead delicious.  Order this dish!! wow!I was so full by the time dinner arrived, but managed to scarf down my FISH entree.  I forget what type of fish it was, but it was similar to a snapper or swordfish, had a think layer of skin on top, and was cooked very tender.  Roasted potatoes, mushrooms, and sauteed spinach with it, was also delicious, although the red pepper flakes were a little too spicy for me.  DESSERT was amazing:  I loved the key lime cheesecake which was oddly served in a jar (not a slice), but it still had a think graham cracker crust at the bottom and a delicious blueberry compote on the top.  The Chocolate Pecan Pie was also delicious. For being a picky foodie from Philly, I was very impressed with the quality of food, everything was so delicious, and our server was great.  I definitely recommend this restaurant!"},{"name":"Dead Lizard Brewing Company","address":"4507 SW 36th St, Ste C","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"We stopped in on this past Saturday for the HomeBrew competition. I had never been here before. Location is a bit odd - we thought we had gotten lost! It is a bit off i4 near the Mall at Millenia. Located in an industrial area. We were pleasantly surprised by the size of the place! There were a ton of people there during the event but we still found seats. Bar staff was very friendly. Bartender suggested we try a flight of beers since we had not been here before. They have a nice variety of beers - dark and light. Each flavorful and interesting in their own way.

Been here several times and have always had excellent service, and equally excellent meals! Portions are generous and fun to do lots of sharing/tasting if you come with a big group.

We were just expecting our order to be complete. It was our first time to try this place out and we just were just ready for the new experience.  Ordered at 8:30, he came by at almost 9:30 and forgot our soda. Paid in credit card ( with tip included) and all he could say was sorry I'll refund you the soda money which he said was our only option. He could have at least given us a coupon or something. It was his last delivery so you can just imagine.  Anyways besides that, to say the least the pizza was great. The 6.99 build your own is pretty good because of unlimited toppings. Made a white sauce, chicken, spinach, garlic,mushroom, sun dried tomato and it was delicious! Our other pizza was pep/sausage and jalape√±os with spicy red sauce. Definitely a 4 star for pizza, if there is a next time we'll just go dine in instead."},{"name":"The Cowfish Sushi Burger Bar","address":"Universal Citywalk - Orlando, 6000 Universal Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Over priced for sucky sushi.We went before Halloween horror nights and the place was busy.

A refreshing change from the North End, parking was easy and free, a good start as the North End is a nightmare, easy to find right off the highway at rt 60 only about a mile or so on the left.\\nNot many BYOB's around, however, by bringing your own drinks you know your going to get what you want, and the staff are more than willing to open your wine or beer.\\nOur sever was Crystal (sp?) who was outstanding, very personable and greeted all our party with lovely smile. We had a party of 8 and arrived at separate times but were all seated as we arrived so that was nice.\\nNo menu so the nights offerings were passed on to us by Crystal, nice selection of seafood including calamari, clams, shrimp, haddock, salmon, swordfish etc with the turf staples, pork chops (with vinegar peppers of course!) chicken, veal etc all prepared in almost any sauce and style you like, and a homemade fusilli pasta was on the card too.\\nThe Food - \\nApps - shrimp joey, eggplant parm & antipasto all outstanding, especially the shrimp joey served on little bruschetta points. Didn't get chance to try any of the cured meats as the carnivores at the other end of table cleaned them off before the plate reached me but by the look on their faces they were happy.\\nThe mains - fettuccine alfredo with shrimp - beautiful, Chicken ziti broccoli - excellent Seafood far diavolo - spicy tasty, chicken parm - delicious, homemade sausage & meatballs with spaghetti - also delicious.\\nDessert - ran out of tiramisu so we had chocolate cake and the lemon cake, the lemon cake was sublime, a real palate cleaner bursting with flavor. The chocolate cake was no slouch either, intense and rich that was hard to stop eating.\\nAll our mains came out together and were piping hot, good job after all there was 8 of us.\\nPrices were about what we expected and absolutely worth it, maybe $25-35 per person including tip, all in all a great location, awesome food and friendly staff. I noticed a couple of problems with service, to be honest we didn't experience any of that, our service was absolutely spot on (ask for Crystal she's a sweetheart!)"},{"name":"Franklin Barbecue","address":"900 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"The food was good, the staff was great on all levels, but the experience I would have to say did it, done it, never again (at least not anytime soon). We arrived at 8am to a line which gauranteed that we would get food, but not until 1-1:30. What this holdup is all about, I am not sure. The restaurant opens at 11am and if all the food is already cooked, then why would it take so long to chop meat, weigh it, and serve customers? I would have no hesitation to come back if waiting in line so early/long meant that I would get BBQ that day but not 6 hours later (as we actually made it to the counter at 2pm). Again, loved the staff, everyone was a pleasure and extrmely kind but the swealtering heat, no shade, and a 6 hour wait ruined the experience for me.  \\n     Things to note: The Pecan Pie is delicious, even 5 days later and smashed from travel. There is a CVS Pharmacy nearby for any essentials you may have forgotten.

How many American restaurants flaunt their American pride compared to Canadian restaurants? It's baffling why we don't do it more, but I digress.I had dine out here last month, and while it was super busy, the service was very good and food was delicious. Mind you not everyone at my table agreed, but the consensus was that everyone would come back for their regular menu.I'm a huge gin and tonic fan and they actually make their gin in house. It has a very herbal taste so if you like your gin quite bland this might not be for you. I quite liked the gin but the brown tone took some getting used to.The food was very good for its price point. I eat out a lot, and I would say this is on par with a lot of restaurants despite its semi-casual vibe. I had the sablefish in broth which was surprisingly good and a dessert in a mason jar (great for chocolate lovers)Aside from dinner, I've had brunch here numerous times. I must say, their AERATED YOGURT IS TO DIE FOR. However your life is spared because they apparently don't offer aerated yogurt anymore (due to a change in chef and changing menus), which is a pity because that $5 aerated yogurt that tasted like air was totally worth it.Overall I like this place. It's not pretentious and the restaurant is very rustic/earthy. It's on par with Edible Canada (also love their name!! Canadian pride over here!) on Granville Island.

Rice is a good indicator of the whole shebang in this reviewers opinion.The guacamole salad was very nice.  Thick slice of fresh tomato, the shredded lettuce was also fresh and crisp.  The guacamole itself was a little bland, but not off putting.  Ask for a wedge of lime for a fix.The green burrito, was not as green as the picture in the menu.  This is a disappointment as I really love a good verde salsa.  It was a perfect size to complete the meal.

I love soul food as well. I read several reviews about the restaurant and haven't came across one that would have me go the other way. Our resevreration was for 9:45 on a busy Saturday night. Due to trying to find a parking spot we didn't arrive till about 5 minutes after 10. We were seated with no problem. We decided to take a seat outside which faced us directly across the street from the night club called Opera. It was a treat watching the beautiful people wait in line to enter the club. I will begin with the cocktails. Me and my boy had a Lemonade based drink with Absolute Citro√´n. It was refreshing as hell. Our girl had a rum based drink. She was satisfied. Now apps. My boy had the fried tomatoes which I was told were delecious. I didn't try it. I hate tomatoes with a passion. I rarely use ketchup. I got a ceasar salad. It was fresh and the crutons we're very different, but it was good.Dinner. I chose the fried catfish and instead of the dirty rice that they offer, I chose to get mac and cheese. The fried catfish was nice and crunchy and I needed no salt what so ever. It was crispy and flavorful. The meat was nice and tender. As far as the mac and cheese I wasn't such a big fan of. I love my mac and cheese with a nice hard crust and a soft moist middle. I'm just use to that home southern style mac and cheese. It wasn't bad, but wasn't what I expected. My boy had the pork chop. I forgot what his sides were to be honest. I didn't try his food at all, but what I will say is that his plate was COMPLETELY CLEARED. That says a lot about how he enjoyed his meal I guess. Our girl had the duck and I believe she had green beans to go along with it. I actually tasted the duck. Its the best I've had to date. It wasn't greasy like I expected either. All in all I will give this place 4 stars. We had such an amazing time. Our server was very nice and gave you that southern comfort feeling. The manager came to check on us quite a few times, which I always find to be great. I had desert I had the banana pudding. That I will give 5 stars alone. It was the best. The portions at this place are just right. Damn close to perfect if you ask me. Our bill was reasonably set so I have no complaints about that either. South City Kitchen is the perfect place to start your evening of libations. You will have a full belly, and will be prepared to have a night of Patron shots and not feel like crap in the morning because you didn't eat. (Always drink responsibly of course)."},{"name":"Holy Smoke Barbecue","address":"5251 N Hamilton Rd","city":"Columbus","stars":"3","text":"Decent food, better than City, good beer selection.

That's the best I can say, and I will cut them slack since it was the worst dining night of the year: NEW YEAR'S EVE.But seriously, during the reign of Chef Crocker., this was indeed one of the very best restaurants on the North Shore when it came to casual fine dining. It's a shame, really, since this was definitely once a noteworthy dining experience. But now ... it's a cliched \\"gastro pub.\\" This time, it was just OK. Had the t-bone steak special, and there wasn't anything really special about it. Cooked as ordered (medium rare), but not really spectacular enough to warrant the $35 price tag. Constant companion had the rack of lamb: again just OK despite the $38 price tag.Pre-meal bread was a little stale, although the olive oil for dipping was definitely primo.Have to say that the once cozy quirky dining room of the Crocker days was greatly  missed. The new dining room is the domain of cheap, mis-matched  tables and chairs. What happened to the comfy over-stuffed chairs? Fake, gas fire place is as tacky as it gets.Gone too is the best dessert ever: No more grilled bananas with ice cream. Surprised too to see the dining room half empty by 8:30 on New Year's Eve. In the day, no reservation usually meant a two-hour wait on a night like this.Go for an average dining night out. Don't go expecting what this once was: A big-city casual fine dining experience in a suburban setting.Where have you gone, Chef Crocker?"},{"name":"Franklin Barbecue","address":"900 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I first visited Franklin BBQ after living here less than a year in 2011. The wait times were a mere 2hrs (if you can believe it or not) and the only reason I had even ventured to partake in the Russian Food Line fad that Austinites seem to embrace with such fervor and pride was to see if this place actually lived up to the overwhelming hype; I wasn't holding out much hope as my Hype-dar had yet to detect such an anamoly, but in all honesty, Franklin was the exception.It has been 3yrs since my first visit to Franklin and though the lines and wait times have grown exponentially, the quality of the BBQ and the charm of a grassroots city icon has remained the same.I was lucky enough to attend a private party at this legendary establishment and even luckier to sample literally EVERYTHING on the menu. It was a feast for senses! Their pulled pork, turkey, sausage, and ribs all deserved their due praise; the slaw and beans (which I am usually not a fan of in general) are delicious and flavorful and I could have their potato salad for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The key lime tart and banana bourbon tart are the perfect captstone to an epic culinary experience (if you have still have the ability to chew and digest after gorging on the cornucopia of carnivorous delights). All that deliciousness aside, the real star of the Franklin menu is and always has been the brisket. This stuff is like the unicorn of the BBQ world, a mythical thing only known to a chosen few who sweat their worthiness in lines sometimes up to 6hrs long to not only behold, but savor their pot of gold at the end of a what may seem like a very long rainbow. I don't know with what black magic the brisket is made with, but something that tastes this good (sans sauce, of course) and literally melts in your mouth with the charred ends adding such a smoky sweet mesquite crunch is not of this pale blue dot! When you add in local drafts on tap and a selection of canned beers (the best pairing for the brisket is Shiner), sweet tea, and the ubiquitous Austin thirst-quencher, Topo Chico, it just makes the greatness better!Needless to say, if you are new to the Austin area and are wondering if braving the line here is worth it or if you have lived here for awhile, but not been motivated to see \\"what it's all about\\", check this place out and block off your calendar accordingly. Everyone should experience what Meat Dreams are made of at least once in their lives!PS-You can order this stuff for pickup and/or catering and they also have some fun swag for sale!"},{"name":"The Cowfish Sushi Burger Bar","address":"Universal Citywalk - Orlando, 6000 Universal Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Very slow service for a Friday night, but the food is good.I really enjoy their check in system.  Basically you give them your name and number and they will text you when your table is ready.  We were told it would be 30-45 minutes so we went to Pat O'Briens to get a drink.  However, once we got our drink we received a text saying our table was ready.  We had to quickly down our drinks.  We are lucky we did, because I think the only reason we weren't so upset about how long it took to get our food was because we were buzzed.If you get a chance, ask to sit on the balcony.  I regret that we didn't since it was such a nice day and I think you can see people walking below.  We ended up on the third floor in the corner so our only view was of waiters walking in and out from behind a black curtain.  Again, this didn't bother us because we were buzzed.I ordered the blueberry bottom.  It wasn't very sweet, but it was still good.  We sat down at 9:45 p.m. and by 10:15 p.m. we still didn't have our food.  I got pretty worried when I noticed the table next to us didn't have their food either and they got there before us.  I think it ended up taking about 45 minutes for us to get our food.  I bet our server knew it would be a while, because he made himself pretty scarce while we were waiting.  I wouldn't blame him, I bet he had to dodge a lot of tables that night.Now onto the food.  I really enjoyed the grilled salmon salad.  The sesame encrusted goat cheese was a really nice touch.  (I've never been asked how I like my salmon grilled before.  I'm still not sure if that was a joke or if the server was serious.)  My fianc√© got the Big Squeal and said it was delicious!

Although I can cook okay, I can't bake for the pastry chef not in me: too finicky for my restless mind and excitable self. I thought about going to a trendier place but decided to go to oldie but goodie Apr√®s Diem (I'm kind of a comeback girl). The thing is, for me, trendy makes wakes but vested endures the tides (at least that's how my boat navigates the deep waters of 'restaurant surfing'). Hubby, moms, and I decided to sit outside - it was warm but not intolerable (no breeze but no sauna either). Our server was a quiet guy (shame on me for forgetting his name) who greeted us in a serene way, calmly listening to the multilingual exchange at our table. He hears me asking my mom what she wanted to drink and he says: \\"Are you Brazilian? Voc√™ fala portugu√™s (do you speak Portuguese)?\\" I confirm \\"Yes\\" and he tells me \\"Eu falo um pouco\\" (I speak a little). I thought: \\"That's great\\", because I talk a lot! Drinks came, food followed; but before sinking my sweet tooth into the cake I've eyed from the outdoor patio, we had some bubbly (Prosecco for hubby and his mom), tea (my mom), and ginger ale (me) and shared some fried goat cheese and baked brie on baguette: what else can I say in prose about gooey cheese and warm bread that hasn't already been said in poetry? All cheesed out, we shared a single slice of Tiramisu torte (tasty but not the best I've had). Good thing I didn't go for the cheesecake: one should try to avoid the cheesy route, as it may harm the ozone layer and humanity for that matter."},{"name":"Tropicana Cuban Restaurant","address":"9616 N Lamar Blvd, Ste 141","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Para m√≠ es el mejor restaurante de comida cubana en Austin ,excelentes precios ,calidad y atenci√≥n"},{"name":"Mettle - East Austin Bistro","address":"507 Calles St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"We had dinner here.

While in Germany, this was some of our favorite food.  All of the shops in Germany seem to be run by Turkish immigrants, which is why this is kind of a fusion of Turkish and German cuisine (more leaning towards  German, though.)The interior is very upscale; much nicer than what it needs to be.  Considering that most d√∂ner in Berlin is served in places with plastic silverware and worn-out plywood counters, it's quite a shift.  This would be an acceptable place to take a date, though it is still a little Spartan in that German/Scandanavian kind of way.The food was quite good.  We both got d√∂ner selections - she got the sandwich, and I got the plate.  After receiving them, it's clear their menu needs a little sanity-checking - the plate had d√∂ner meat, some yogurt sauce, and some cucumber/tomato garnish, and a piece of bread.  Her sandwich had about the same amount of meat, but had lettuce (cabbage?), feta cheese, onions, garnish, sauce, in what seemed to be a larger piece of bread.   And the sandwich was cheaper.  So go with the sandwich.  We'll try the other selections on the menu later.So: the meat was turkey (as in, the bird, not the nation which is the home of most d√∂ner kebab vendors) which was a surprise.  Either I didn't know d√∂ner was turkey  in Germany - maybe they're all like that?  Anyway, this is FANTASTIC tasting stuff.  Like no other meat I've had - theirs is particularly good.In the sandwich form, this is nearly the perfect lunch selection.  As a dinner, it's good, but needs something on the side as well.  We got a plate of potato salad, but it was not what I expected - it was \\"just\\" potato salad - OK, but nothing special.  I had been anticipating the vinegar-and-bacon potato salad that I recall from Germany, but I suppose just like in the US there are many recipes for potato salad.  It did have olives, which was nice.Dessert was great - they have some very nice cakes that were an excellent finish.Service was good, but there were only a few other tables at the time.  I can see perhaps how it would deteriorate with larger numbers of customers - the waiter and the owner spent a lot of time talking to patrons, which is nice if you're being talked to but bad if you're waiting for something.They said their liquor license is pending, so they'll soonl have a German beer selection."},{"name":"Stubb's Bar-B-Q","address":"801 Red River St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Great atmosphere.

I am relatively new to Austin and was told that this place is a must try at least once so I thought it would be a great thing to bring some family too when they come and visit. On Sundays, brunch is reservation only (some times they have a few extra tables) and they seat at only two times: 10:30 and 12:30.  They suggest arriving a bit early because there is a line that forms so we arrived around 15 mins before seating.  The line consisted of about 10 people in front of us which was not bad at all.  When 10:30 came along, we were seating within minutes so that wasn't an issue at all.  As soon as you are given a table, you are allowed to move on to the food area.  Since I was quite hungry, I went straight there.  The food all tasted great and they have many different options ranging the typical bbq items like brisket and sausage to many different Mexican items like chorizo eggs, beans, and tortillas, and even biscuits and gravy.Although the food was good, the best part of the meal was the gospel band.  They started around 10 or 15 mins after we got their and really stepped up the entire vibe of the restaurant.

While our food was good, it wasn't as amazing as we were anticipating.Between us, we ordered the fried chicken, Carolina pulled pork, a pork belly salad with peaches, sweet potato fries and corn bread.  The fried chicken just wasn't good.  I'm sorry.  I know they are known for their fried chicken, but the flavors weren't happening for me.  I make my own from scratch, so maybe that was the problem?The mashed potatoes weren't for me either.  The gravy had an off flavor.  My family agreed with me on the chicken and mashed potatoes.My husband and I thought the pulled pork sandwich was just okay.  The pork wasn't very moist.  We liked the bun on which it was served.  My daughter's salad was the highlight.  The pork belly was perfectly cooked and the salad was unique.I think that was the problem here...the food just wasn't all that unique.We were going to get dessert because they actually looked good.  However, there was a family of 12 celebrating a birthday.  They ordered a bunch of desserts and I heard them complaining, so I leaned over and asked two of the people (I think husband and wife) what they thought.  They both laughed.  The wife said, \\"Honestly...don't waste your money.  It's not worth it.  This restaurant is all about the hype.\\"And lastly...the waiter.  Though he was Portland Polite, he seemed hurried and completely disinterested.  When we originally asked him about the salad, he seemed bothered by our question.  When he asked if we wanted dessert and we said \\"no,\\" his response was like that of a child being told he couldn't go out and play.

Over 2,000 reviews, I'm sure one or two people mentioned the fried chicken is fantastic so I won't start there. The banoffee pie is definitely worth saving some room for. For me, it's not a 5 star restaurant because I don't love everything they make. The grits are only okay. The mac and cheese is not among the best I've had and it's actually a bit overwhelmingly heavy/rich. The bloody mary is good. The collards are really good. The burger is pretty good. The brunch items I've had were great (except the potatoes were a little dry). Their kitchen is busy and while I'm sure they strive for consistency, it's not always achieved. So why 4 stars when the food isn't always perfect here? Let me tell you about the service. The staff here are so easy going, friendly, and attentive.

I can't say that about a lot of trendy restaurants we have tried in Austin in the past couple of years. From the moment we walked in, service was superb. The food was smack on. And our biggest beef with restaurants is how the food ends up oversalted. Neither one of us found that to be the case here across the myriad items we tried. Though not much of a cocktail drinker, I ordered the Lady Bird - a beautifully balanced cocktail of pear vodka, elderflower liqueur, lemon juice and simple syrup. We started with a mouthwatering fettine. The ability to build an appetizer plate from the offerings was brilliant. We just about devoured the shell in which the deviled crab was served. The elk loin I ordered for a main course melted in my mouth. The rabbit dish was varied and flavorful. I wish I'd had more room to polish off the bread basket comprising a mini cornbread loaf, a savory biscuit, and pain au lait. Dessert was right-sized after a filling meal; we shared the small-sized banana cream \\"pie,\\" which was more like a cake. We are definitely planning a return visit.

When she took our credit cards she did not come back for 15 minutes and one of my guests had to go find her.  I really have recommended this place a ton and decided to take visiting family here the same week for Saturday dinner figuring that experience was an anomaly. The waitress was at least acting like she cared about our table somewhat (smiling) but was not attentive at the least. The host proclaimed a 20 minute wait and it ended up being 45 minutes when the restaurant had multiple open tables, at least 10.

The food is still pretty decent (when you actually get what you ordered and it isn't cold), but the crappy service just isn't worth it to me anymore.  Also, there are plenty of better places to eat in the area - Kaya, Sugar & Spice, Ana's Taqueria, West Side, Temple Bar, just to name a few!  Even Uno's (across the street) will guarantee you a burger with less than a one hour wait."},{"name":"Fox Bros.

From what we could find, there is no literal screen door.\\n2. Either come on a weekday, or chill at Heart Coffee to kill time during the cult-like weekend brunch wait.\\n3. Come with an appetite, and be forewarned that you will likely order too much (but reset assured, there will be no regrets).\\n4. Brace yourself for food coma.Screen Door is one of the brunch hotspots of Portlandia, and as expected it is rather mind-blowing. Southern food is comfort food as it is, but you will find yourself inhaling brunch here. The portions are ginormous and the food is filling; two entrees will feed three hungry people. But with such a tempting menu, we ordered three entrees for two people :3 (Pro tip: We took two of the fried chicken pieces to go and made a chopped fried chicken salad for dinner! Best lazy foodie idea I've ever come up with.)The ambiance is homey, and their patio seating is completely covered and surrounded with plastic so that you can dine outdoors even during rainy Portland weather. While the time limit for nearby street parking will barely cover your wait time, it's not impossible to find untimed zones within a few blocks.(++) Bananas Foster French Toast ($8.25 for half order): One of the most decadent French toasts I've ever had. The brioche has a rich eggy taste and a fluffy texture that soaks up the vanilla custard and essentially has the composition of a layer cake. The rum flamed bananas are heavily caramelized (the rum flavor isn't exceptionally strong, though typical of bananas foster). The final touch of cinnamon renders it cinnamon toast crunch status. With the incorporation of so many desserts, it definitely did not need the whipped cream on the side. (In fact, skipping the whipped cream almost makes you feel healthy amidst all the guilt from eating here!)(+++) Fried Chicken And Waffle ($14.95 for 3 pieces over a waffle): One of their signature brunch dishes, and after a bite you'll be sold. Somehow it's sheer chicken n waffle perfection: the buttermilk has a satisfying crisp yet the meat is tender and moist, there's a kick from the dense seasoning of black pepper, and the sweet potato waffle is an ingenious choice of a naturally sweet savory item to accompany the savory chicken. (Again, I passed on the maple syrup to pretend to be healthy... while eating fried chicken)(+/-) Brisket hash ($12.95): I don't know if we were disappointed because it was overshadowed by the other phenomenal dishes, if their rotating specials are just new ideas  that can be hit-or-miss, or if there was just a large dissonance from how we were expecting the dish to turn out. The brisket consisted of cubed steak, and the hash was sauteed potatoes with some misc vegetables. It came with tortillas to eat fajita-style, and overall it was mostly like fajitas. I would recommend sticking with their popular items on the regular menu, at least until you've exhausted them all."},{"name":"Screen Door","address":"2337 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"ri-frigging-diculous food that is completely worth the wait.

If you love breakfast, and I'm talking hearty, feel like you wanna roll over and take a nap forever after crawling back to your car because you're so full of breakfast goodness, then yes. If you eat here, know you're eating for not just breakfast, but lunch as well. You're going to be so full, dinner that day will seem like something you should probably do only because it's that time of day and you skipped lunch because breakfast was so insane. There's nothing more to say that hasn't already been said. So I'll go over some small details:\\n1. The orange juice is freshly squeezed and you can taste it. Don't bother getting a large, the small is practically the same size- it'll be plenty (and I love me some OJ).  2.The chicken & waffles is really well made, but over-gratuitous with a  stack of THREE chicken breast on top of the waffle just so they can stab a knife through the whole dish and make it look \\"cool\\"...oh Portland, always trying to be cool...we get it. But I digress...ask for a to-go and plan on sharing the love by handing out a perfectly delicious chicken breast (or breasts- really the one is plenty) to a homeless person. Otherwise, it's a horrible waste of delicious chicken. 3. If you want a table when it opens at 9, you must get there no later than 8:30 to stand a chance in line. 4.

My group ordered the chicken& waffles, the cajun scramble, the biscuits with a vegetarian gravy & ONE buttermilk pancake to top it off. group consensus: we ordered wayyy too food for 4 people. My favorite was the cajun scramble- it was like an scramble omelet with bell peppers, sausage, mushrooms with a side of really good potatoes. The much-raved-about chicken&waffles was alright. I've had better at Roscoe's chicken&waffles in LA (word on the street is they put crack in their waffles because it's sooo good; i think i agree). The chicken&waffles were bland compared to Roscoe's but I will commend them on their presentation. The biscuits with gravy was above-par. It was fascinating that the gravy was vegetarian and still so creamy &rich. The biscuits weren't so amazing though- not the soft&fluffy kind i adore. So -1 for the wait. -1 for poor biscuits& average chicken&waffles.

I ordered the 3 little pigs, which is a biscuit with bacon, ham, an egg, cheese grits, pimento cheese and sausage gravy. Overall is was pretty good, but i wasnt a big fan of the pimento cheese or the sausage gravy (maybe because of the thyme in it). I also was not a huge fan of how the cheese on each biscuit is pimento cheese. Im not sure if there was another option but i would have enjoyed that more.

We arrived early and the restaurant was mostly empty.  We were seated at the same time as 2 other tables.  The restaurant was nice, clean and obviously new.  The radio was a bit loud for the early and mostly empty restaurant but the odd thing was they were playing Kids Bop music.  Those are \\"generic/sound a like\\" pop music not done by the original artists.  There were 2 small children with us so we could appreciate the \\"candy theme\\" and the music kept with the kids theme.  However, they do not provide a Kids menu.

I say first plate because it took 10 minutes from first plate to last plate for all of our meals to arrive.  I did notice a manager in the restaurant but apparently the long wait time and sporadic serving of meals was not something he was concerned with.  Once all the food arrived it was warm or cold and the only hot item was the Pancakes.  The food was average at best.  \\n  The crepe that arrived was sent back as it had the consistency of a rubber jar opener.  Actually it was more of a tortilla than a crepe.  The waitress took the crepe back and asked if anything else could be ordered instead.  We stated that after 45 minutes to get the meal it was likely that everyone would be done eating before the replacement platter arrived.

South City Kitchen quickly turned into my favorite restaurant in Atlanta. The atmosphere was actually cozy and intimate, and the place itself seems to be off the beaten path - it was not very crowded when I went there on a Saturday night. We were seated quickly by a pleasant hostess and attended to quickly by our server. The server was great - very knowledgeable about the menu, made lots of recommendations, and was very helpful. I noticed that they had the Abita Pecan Harvest ale (a special seasonal beer) used for a marinade on a steak entree, but that they didn't have it listed on the drinks menu. I wanted one, so I asked if there was any way to get it. He told me he would check with the chef, and took everyone else's drink orders. When he came back, he brought me a similar style harvest ale (not the Abita), and told me that the chef only had a 6 pack for the marinade... but he stole three of them and put them on ice for me and they would be ready in about ten minutes! You can't get much more accomodating than that. I had the fried green tomatoes appetizer with goat cheese, and they were amazing. I have since adopted the recipe and make it at home all the time. My entree was, in fact, the Abita Pecan Harvest marinade steak tips, and it was very good. I have to admit though, I was more impressed by my friend's entree, which was a special - a pork roast. The waiter had suggested it according to the drinks and appetizer he had already ordered. Then for no good reason other than to just be awesome, he comped us two desserts to share among our group of four. One was a vanilla/banana pudding, and the other was a kind of chocolate cake.

Felt ambitious so went with the crazy sounding 7th Trimester.Quality\\nNow going in I was a bit worried that I would not be ready for the 7th Trimester. It is a biscuit with an over-medium egg and bacon, which is then covered in mac n' cheese and a potato chip bacon crumble. Just reading it sounded like I may be unable to move for several hours afterward. However, I was surprised and honestly a bit disappointed that it was not the heavy dish I was expecting. The good part was it was a excellent fresh and warm biscuit with just a hint of garlic. However, I feel like maybe another egg or more bacon were needed because too many bites were just biscuit or just mac n' cheese. Now I had mixed feelings about the mac n' cheese, which at this point is always understandable for me. Mac n' cheese is such a subjective dish and while I appreciated that this version was not so heavy that it left me sick, I just didn't love the flavor of the sauce. Without question it is a unique and ambitious dish, but I feel like I regretted not getting something a bit more standard.Quantity\\nThe 7th Trimester is a massive undertaking and I made it a little more than halfway through. With so many heavy items it definitely can knock you down.Value\\nEverything on the menu was very decently priced. Considering the size and the unique nature of so many of the dishes just a tiny bit higher than a standard breakfast spot seemed reasonable.Ambiance\\nGetting to Se7en Bites was a bit of a journey as it was located in the northeast area of Orlando. It is a pretty massive building, but I get the impression that it used to operate in a much smaller space, but demand forced expansion. Unfortunately the restaurant uses the order at the counter then wait at your seat with a number method I do not enjoy. But it is important to note that they utilize two different counters, one for the hot food and the other for pastries. I perused the pastries quickly, but since nothing caught my eye I decided to just stick with my order. The dining area is big, but it is very odd as they seem to only have massive picnic style tables and then super tiny tables. It seems like a weird use of space especially if they expect big crowds. In general everything is very casual and very green, I mean the color. They clearly focus on local everything, down to the soda machine, filled with a brand I never heard of before. It is a nice breakfast and brunch haven.Crowd\\nI was shocked at how full the place was on a Friday afternoon. This is a place I could imagine bustling on Saturday and Sunday morning, but even during the week people came calling. There happened to be a lot of families, I'm not sure if it was people taking a reprieve from theme park fun or locals enjoying family time, so it was extremely family friendly.Service\\nAs I mentioned, they employ an order at the counter get a number and sit and wait. I just don't like that style especially when the expectation is for you to make your decisions while standing in line with impatient people. Maybe it is a necessity when packed, but it just makes me uncomfortable.Parking\\nThey have a pretty large parking lot in front of the restaurant, so parking should be a breeze, but even on a weekday, there were only a few open slots. I assume it is a madhouse on the weekends and I'm not even going to pretend to know the area or where you would need to park.Extra\\nSe7en Bites is a unique breakfast spot and I appreciate the creativity in their dishes. However, the 7th Trimester just did not floor me like it apparently did to so many others. I also hate the ordering style and just imagining the parking on the weekend gives me nightmares. I would not necessarily say no to a repeat visit, they did seem to have quite a few other cool options, but its relative isolation in Orlando would potentially deter me."},{"name":"Cosmic Ray's Starlight Caf√©","address":"1180 Seven Seas Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3","text":"Not my favorite place to eat but it was hard to find somewhere to eat in this area that offered more than just hot dogs and pretzels.

I came to Stubb's off a friend's recommendation, and frankly, I was blown about by his promise of never-ending, all-you-can eat good meat. Sign me up! Apparently there's usually a wait here but I lucked out Tuesday night, and got seated within 15 minutes. The bartender made me a tasty hard sweet tea, which I sucked it down like candy... 3x. Luckily, my liver of steel came in handy and repelled each alcohol droplet like it was airport security. We ordered a ton of sides - mac n cheese, onion rings, fried okra, fried green tomatoes, and corn bread - because that's how real champs eat. I recommend the mac because it was cheesy and this dish can never do wrong in my eyes. Onion rings and corn bread you can skip as they were uneventful, and the latter was extremely dry. The table TX toast is a much better carb accompaniment with the meat. The fried vegetables had a really good fried crust to it. I ate a few rounds of them.Meat - chose pork ribs, brisket, and smoked turkey. Man I have never had so much turkey outside of Xmas, Thanksgiving, and Easter but TX turkey is legit. Very tender and flavorful, and even better than chicken. This place does turkey right, and I'm talking about the white meat by the way. The pork ribs were pretty tender. No, actually it was pretty damn good. Slap some more BBQ sauce on it and go to town! Brisket. Oh dear, that was disappointing. I really like this cut of meat and thought TX, famous BBQ state, would do it right but it was SO dry - like I should have thrown my damp clothes and a Bounce sheet in it dry.

Definitely not bad, but did not have the \\"wow\\" factor.

What we had: spicy tuna cone, tuna tataki (best thing we had), fanny bay oysters, saba sushi, the sablefish entree, and chocolate melting cake w/ deep fried banana for dessert.

The restaurant is not the largest as we could hear every word of the conversations next to us, and I could smell the pungent perfume of the girl at the next table.

It was gooey and cheesy - definitely got points for that. It could have used more toppings (mushrooms and peppers). The fries were great - they were your typical Ore-Ida crinkle-cut fries, but they were nicely fried.

After leaving, here's what I wish I had known before I got there.The ribs are not \\"wet\\" ribs. They are rubbed then smoked. The flavor was pretty good, but it seemed to me that they may have been left in the smoker a little long, which made the bark a little crunchy, and the ribs dried out a little. The specials are delicious. The night we were there, I tried the special Fox-a-roni side which was their mac-n-cheese mixed with their brunswick stew. It was quite good (better than the mac by itself). The Frito-Chili-Cheese pie (which was served in a single serving Fritos bag) was delicious (more on the chili later). The smoked sausage (1/2 brisket, 1/2 pork) probably had the best flavor of anything I had on my plate - though it was rich, and couldn't have eaten more than I was given. (I can normally continue to snack on pork or brisket well after I'm full)The pulled pork was just the way I like it - good bark, great flavor, not swimming in sauce, not stringy. I wanted to order a pound to go.Smoked wings - if you like wings, definitely give them a try. I've had them a few times. I've had some that were amazing and some that were pretty good. I've never had a bad smoked wing here.The chili------ oh my ----- the chili. They use smoked brisket as the meat for the chili. I was not expecting this when I took a bite of my chili-cheese tater tots. It made me wish I had just ordered the chili. It was not a traditional chili, but had a solid smoky, beefy flavor. It was amazing.I didn't get a chance to try the brisket  by iteself- I wish I had ordered it instead of the ribs on my combo plate. Everyone else at the table said it was amazing.We had a half order of fried jalapeno's. They were ok, but we didn't finish the half order. I kept the ranch for my meal.I had the jalapeno cornbread. I wish I'd ordered a different 2nd side.\\nLong story short- if a special sounds good.... it probably is. I didn't have a great rib experience.

I guess my expectations were elevated considering Fat Matt's location in a major city in the Deep South.  While dining companion and I were mildly disappointed, it was still a decent place to fill up and much better than the other local places we tried.In our two visits there, we had the Pork Ribs, Collard Greens, Sweet Potato and Pecan Pies, and Iced Tea.  The ribs were ample and had a nice char on the outside, but the biggest issue was lack of proper fat rendering which made it very greasy and heavy.  While the barbecue sauce was a bit sweet for liking (personal preference, I know), having a thick slab of pork fat to peel off was a bit off-putting.  Although they are a prepared with a drier finish, Urban Bar-B-Que's (of Maryland -gasp!) are ones we prefer because they are nicely smokey, seasoned, and well-rendered to a clean finish.The rest of the food at Fat Matt's was alright, although we could find obvious faults.  The collards were too salty, which did not help to balance the sweetness of the ribs as much as we hoped.  The bread was simple sliced white bread (Wonder Bread?), which was fine, but being in The South, it would have been nicer to have some cornbread (which is an option at Urban Bar-B-Que).  The pies were fine, although nothing special--particularly the Pecan variety which was nowhere near the stratosphere of Vidalia's dreamy version.Although our culinary experience in Atlanta was overall disappointing (except for the ever-reliable Morton's Bar 12-21), Fat Matt's was okay and did not gouge our wallets like Nan Thai Fine Dining or (to a lesser degree) Rathbun's.  Fat Matt's satisfied our appetites and provided us some sustenance on our long drive back home, but we learned how amazing the food (including Southern cuisine) is in the DC area."},{"name":"Cosmic Ray's Starlight Caf√©","address":"1180 Seven Seas Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3","text":"Being inside of the Magic Kingdom you are sort locked into whatever Disney offers at the park unless you actually leave the park.  Most people spend the better part of an entire day at any of the parks so it's inevitable that you'll probably need at least one meal inside the park.  While there's somewhat of a range of variety there's not much as to what the fare may be as far as fast food at fast food prices.  Cosmic Rays if I had to peg it as anything is more of a higher quality fast food type place.  What I mean by this is that there really aren't any fast food places out there offering up pulled pork on hamburgers.  That's more of a sit down type place.  At Cosmic Rays you're still ordering like you do at any of the food establishments that aren't waiter staffed and that's basically cafeteria style pay and pick up but for a pay and pick up place their food seems better than just hot dogs, burgers and fries... just a bit.I had ordered the pulled pork bacon cheeseburger and fries.  It's not cheap but then again nothing is inside a Disney park.  But having that pulled pork on the burger is almost a separation of not having it and having it so to speak.  The condiments have air pressured dispensers for mustard, ketchup, mayonnaise and a slew of toppings to add to your food such as saut√©ed mushrooms, onion straws and jalapeno peppers.  You dress your burgers yourself and basically because of that the toppings are pretty much unlimited.  I did find it rather difficult to find a dispenser that was worked for either ketchup or mayo.  I swear that I had to try at least 4 for either before I found one that was able to fill up the little paper cups.The dining area for this place is really large.  Still though it's a buy place.  We were able to find quite a bit of seating close to Cosmic Ray (I assumed it was the namesake) which is a mechanized musician telling corny yet somewhat funny jokes.

I know it's a noodle place, but I was in a rice mood. I ordered ÊèöÂ∑ûÁÇíÈ£Ø (yang chow fried rice). The rice itself was average, could probably use more BBQ pork, had plenty of shrimp though. But the reduced two star rating is purely because of the service. After we were seated, it took a ridiculously long time before we were able to flag down a server to take our order. After taking the orders, I waited close to a good half hour wondering where my fried rice was. After finally getting a hold of a server, it appears they forgot to input my order. The rice thankfully came out shortly after that. It was a pretty busy time, but they should really have more servers or don't have so many tables. The rice definitely was not worth the lengthy wait."},{"name":"The Cowfish Sushi Burger Bar","address":"Universal Citywalk - Orlando, 6000 Universal Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Really enjoyed the food and atmosphere here. We ate at the bar and the staff was very friendly and attentive. I was very tempted to try the burger/sushi hybrid they have, called \\"burgushi\\" or something like that, but I played it safe this time and figured I'd try that on round 2.  The menu sounded delicious all around. We both got burgers. For her, the Swiss shroom, and for me the jalapeno poppers with sweet potato fries. My only regret here is that I'm not a local, if it was I'd be a regular at Cowfish. Both burgers were excellent, and the sweet potatoes fries were the best I've had (and I order a lot of sweet potato fries!)Great menu, good prices and portion sizes, fun atmosphere.

I had always seen it, but had never had the opportunity to go. The location actually has decent street parking and great curb appeal. The interior is dark and carries that Brooklyn-cool vibe. The beer list is knock-out and they had a great tap list with stuff I'd never seen before. The menu has a lot of inventive ingredient combinations. I got the cinco-de-mayo burger (even though it's been like a week) which was half chorizo, half beef covered in a black bean relish and jalapenos. It was great. I'd definitely come back."},{"name":"Masa","address":"439 Tremont St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I came here two years back and thought it was great, which is why I was excited to come back for restaurant week.  Some things I can attribute to the fact that it was restaurant week; they may have been understaffed and it was super busy.  It took quite a long time for us to get seated, even though we had made a reservation.  After spending around 30 minutes at the bar we were seated, but then we were basically ignored.  Service was incredibly slow, and a friend I was with pointed out that our waitress had way more tables than she should have.  Again, maybe just because it was restaurant week.  The drinks were fine- I remembered more from their margaritas, but I probably should have just gotten wine.The best part about the meal, honestly, were the dipping sauces that came with the bread.  Those were devoured, mostly because we had been waiting so long, but they were delicious.  For an appetizer I had Pork Tostadas.  The pork itself was good, but it was served on basically a tostitos, chip.  Really? They couldn't toast some bread? Main meal was the catfish, which was so deep fried it was hard to get any taste from it whatsoever.  I love fried food, but I felt like I could have been eating fried chicken, it didn't really taste like fish at all.For dessert I had the key lime pie, which I was very unhappy with.  Key lime pie is my favorite dessert; I get it at restaurants often and make it often.  This one was among the worst I'd ever had.  It was grainy and too sour.  I know the bar bites menu is a pretty good deal, so I may consider coming back for that.  Otherwise, I may pass on dinner here again."},{"name":"Franklin Barbecue","address":"900 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"My best friend from NC, his 17y/o son, and I enjoyed quite a bit of what Austin has to offer in the two and a half days they were here. Franklin Barbecue was the last item to be ticked off. We approached the counter at around 1:15 pm after the expected 5 hour right of passage had been endured. The take away: four pounds of brisket, one pound of pulled pork, five sausages in one bag.  A quart of beans, a quart of slaw, bread, onions, pickles and home we drove.My buddy paid $150 total for the food items. The $88 spent on brisket turned out to be disappointing mouthfuls of salty sadness. The fatty brisket the same as far as salt goes. I've had Franklin Barbecue brisket before. The product received today was inferior to the product enjoyed in the past. The pulled pork was non eventful. The sausage was okay. That no one at the table had much to say said it all.At the table were big eaters. However,  after the first few bites, the only thing we could do was pick at the meats with little enthusiasm and wish for more sausage.  For what we ended up with, the time spent waiting, and the amount paid was not worth the effort. To make matters worse, within an hour or so after eating, that urgent unquenchable thirst feeling set in. The kind of thirst one gets from eating overly salted and/or MSG laden foods. What in the world happened to the Quality Control Mr. Franklin? What has happened to your product's quality control?Resigned to the possibility that THE FRANKLIN BARBECUE experience has run it's course as an Austin trend, my recommendation is that one should see it but only from the window of a car while driving by."},{"name":"Screen Door","address":"2337 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"There food is amazing!

The staff is almost always really friendly, the prices are reasonable considering the quality. (Cap is about $3.00, 1/2 pound coffee is about $7 or $8)I personally think that their coffee is way better than Stumptown, but this may have more to do with the fact that Ristretto has a lot of Mexican and South American varieties which I tend to prefer. There coffee is lightly roasted to perfection, I make it in a French press and drink it black. The Mexican blend that I love has a chocolaty sweetness all on it's own, no cream or sugar necessary. I have heard unflattering things about the owner but personally I don't care, I never worked for her, she has never been a \\"B\\" to me. I will keep buying my coffee there because it really is very very good. They also have a small but good assortment of pastries as well, oh and Tao of Tea teas.

However, our appetizers came out well before our drinks. And service was sub par. Our server did not come to the table nearly enough and we were not given clean plates and silverware between our small plates and our main course. The food was good, however, I think because I am Indian, I was expecting to be WOWed and was not. Perhaps, the food was made for the those that have never eaten Indian food before, because it wasn't spicy and lacked the essential flavors it claimed to have. We ordered the masala fries which were basically regular fries, but the dipping sauce was great. The puri (which was more like a papad and crispy than an actual puri) was decent. It was obviously challenging to eat the liquidy Chana with something more like a chip than a bread that soak the flavors up. The paneer with Chana chaat was a massive piece of fried paneer and not a lot of dipping sauce on the plate so it ended up being dry. We ordered the coconut shrimp, which was great. It was flavorful and tasty! And the butter chicken which was good, I expected butter chicken and that's exactly what I got, just with much larger pieces of chicken. We had a few of the signature cocktails that were good but took far too long to get to the table so that was a bit frustrating. All in all, I won't be going back for this chef's menu nor will I be going back due to the inattentive and slow service."},{"name":"Pallookaville Fine Foods","address":"17N Avondale Plz","city":"Avondale Estates","stars":"3.5","text":"This is my third time here and I have to say it is something to experience. I am going to try and meld all 3 visits into this one review, of course my last one being the focus. First of all this is definitely some place that we looked forward to. Have had the corndogs from the food truck before and they were great ! Sometimes small batch just doesn't translate to mass production. All three times the corndogs have been cooked differently. On a positive note the last time being the best ! I've had severely over cooked to somewhat doughy in the middle. If you do go, try the shakes and sodas. However, try to get the server that is actually attentive or like my last time they will sit on the bar melting away. Though priced on the high end, the sandwiches are generous and tasty. The fries on the other hand were just blah. Not sure if we got the end batch or the time we got them in the poutine we just didn't notice. I have to say that the time we had to wait we suspect my first corndog was burnt and the other food waited for the second to cook. Which may account for the coldish limp fries and the well cooked corndog. The food aside, even if the food is not quite exceptional we as customer base our experience as much on the service. The first two times I have visited were either peak busy times or with a large party. So I guess I gave some leeway to the wait staff. This last time though was so horrid that I was about to get up and walk out. We arrived just before noon and the place only had a few tables sat, the music was even off. Which by the way was a blessing its usually 2 notches too loud in there. 3 of the 4 waiters honestly seemed like they had partied too hard the night before or as our waiter seemed, carried it over into lunch the next day. He was inattentive, distant, and honestly so spaced out I wasn't sure he knew where he was. I will say he got real friendly when the check arrived and his tip was imminent. NOW the ONE saving grace was the tall waiter in a suit with gauge earnings. He was super friendly, brought our food out and not only made sure we got what we needed but made a suggestion for fry seasoning. (maybe he noticed how badly cooked they were)  Pallookaville has lost its charm and that was our last visit to the restaurant, especially with new and good restaurants opening all around them. Though I will happily stand in line for a corndog from the truck."},{"name":"Ward 8","address":"90 N Washington St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Without a doubt one of the North End Gems.

They HAVE to be quick. And they are. If you're a frequent customer, they usually remember what you like, and ask you when you get there if you'd like to order it again - a plus to me because it saves time and it's another way of getting you through the line quickly in the AM. I love the fact that while I'm standing in line, before getting to the actual register, they're already asking what I'd like to drink and by the time I get the register, all I have to do is pay and by then my drink is ready. They also usually have 4-5 people working in the mornings, another plus for when you're trying to get a quick bite to eat on your way upstairs.

We had a few small happy hour items and wine, I hope to return for dinner.The charcutere plate had a shredded and herb infused chicken preparation, wrapped in puff pastry and sliced into two about 4mm sections, some hard dry-cured lamb sausage similarly prepared and a chicken liver pate, the consistency of mousse, with a dab of current jelly. Along side were 2 pickled asparagus speers, a dab of rustic mustard, and a dab of fig preserve. The bread was accompanied by sweet butter and a butter mix of herbs and blue cheese. The mix is brilliant.The clams in white wine sauce easily surpassed the version I have had at Fenouil. The garlic-y, salty, white wine butter sauce was subtly enhanced with a touch of an in-house-made pesto, but not your mother's basil pesto. This dish could easily be expanded by substituting large mussels or just slightly poached oysters.There is a selection of wines by the bottle and glass.The waitperson was knowledgeable about the preparation and ingredients; helpful with recommendations. Attentive but not intrusive - just right. Seats at the bar, with unusual house special drinks based on French liquors we did not try on this visit, was fully filled on a weekday by convivial neighborhood residents. It's a friendly place to drop in, as well as a romantic dinner spot.The owners cook in the kitchen themselves every day. The spot, a former English pub, was rumored to be a new Little Big Burger outpost, but this is infinitely better! Cocotte is not connected with Beast, DOC, or Yakuza, but stands equal in care of preparation, quality of ingredients and the intensity of flavors to their fine neighbors. You can examine their menu online to see that this is a quality spot with commensurate price, even at happy hour.Looking forward to how this spot unfolds.

A taco and enchilada plate is only seven dollars.  That will leave you with extra money for more margaritas!The one downside is the signature border cafe smell.  You will... leave smelling like food.

Our server arrives to explain she will be with us in a minute she needs to use the bathroom. I really didn't need that information but ok, we all need breaks at work. We order wings and individual slices as well as water which cost money, when she gets back. The slices took a while but they were specialty so no big deal, they came out first. My slice tasted like crust. I couldn't taste the cheese or the sauce. Luckily I got some veggies on the slice and had hot sauce handy so I was able to taste something. I waited for the server to come around to ask for parm cheese but she was no where to be found; never asked how things were or if we needed anything else. The wings took so long and we were done with are slices for a while so we just took them to go.

I've been to 4th street many times, and never noticed this little island oasis! I thought the inside was cute on and theme. I was surprised at how not crowded it was at 8:30 on a Friday! We told our waiter that it was our friend's birthday (Shane!) and he was great about it- bringing her a big sombrero to wear and serving her drinks in an extra special tiki bowl. That's where I give 5 stars- the drinks were BIG and DELICIOUS and STRONG. Shout out to the painkiller- all three of us had it and loved it. Worth the $10.The food was less impressive. The menu itself is kinda limited (and it bugs me there are no descriptions on the salads and things). We ordered chips and salsa and the chips were handmade and delish! I had the chopped salad with porkbelly for $15. It was alright, but it was just a salad. Not worth the $15 in terms of flavor or portion size. My two friends each ordered the chef taco plate for $15 (grilled fish, fried chicken, and pork belly). Both hated the grilled fish- said it was very salty. The other two were good but again, nothing to rave about. Highlights were the chips, drinks and our waiter. They have ALL NIGHT happy hour twice a week and i would DEFINITELY come back for those cocktails at $5 and money off the apps. I want to try the goat fundido and empanadas.

Cantina","address":"180 Walker St SW, Ste B","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"I have come to the conclusion No Mas is a really overpriced, garbage Mexican restaurant.I came one time before and I ordered two main dishes and a dessert:-Fish tacos ... Avoid at all costs! These salty, overcooked pieces of tilapia is something that a five year old could've pulled off, but for a restaurant they are a disgrace. I actually sent my order back and asked for another (specifically requested to not be cooked so hard) ... they came back the same way. Therefore, I just asked for fajitas...-Fajitas were good enough to eat, but having to ask for tortillas over and over again is what stuck out in my mind - it comes with three, as if that is enough for the meal. I ordered two different types of meat - chicken and beef. Chicken was cooked correctly, but the beef was tough and pretty inedible once it cooled off after 5 minutes. Didn't complain about this meal and moved onto dessert ...-Churros ... How the heck can you mess these up?? Put them in the frier for 2 minutes, take them out and put powder and jelly on them! Fried HARD (stick hard!) and no powder or jelly on them. Told them to take them back.At least the previous time I went, the frozen margarita had alcohol in them...On to today, September 13, 2015 for brunch.Ordered 3 frozen margaritas, two come out with bigger glasses, one a small glass. We make a comment to the waitress, she said she would get some more. We will leave that for now because we waited about 40 minutes to actually order our food as we sipped on what were basically nonalcoholic slushies ... Luckily the three of us were having a conversation, so it didn't feel like it until I looked at my phone and noticed how much time passed.Food came out, with me ordering a Bread Pudding French Toast for brunch - just to do something different.For the love of god, please DO NOT order the Bread Pudding French Toast unless you are on a diet or just want to have a small dessert. THREE SMALL 1 inch x 3 inch strips of French toast greeted me ... No bacon, no fruit, syrup drizzled on the rim and a dab of whipped cream. Why is that even on the same brunch menu with a egg burrito the size of the plate??? It tastes decent (not good, in my opinion), but when you order something from a menu costing the same as other things you expect at least comparable portion sizes. Needless to say, those were gone in 3 minutes.Back to my kid sized drink ... Nothing was done about the waitress 'will get some more'. The bill came out. I told them to take off $2 of the drink since they shorted me about 1/4 of the drink. 10 minutes later, I get the rest of my drink. Why did I have to say anything?Weirdly enough, I always go out of my way to go to La Fiesta in Douglasville. They provide drinks with actual alcohol in them, succulent beef in their burritos, marinated chicken in their quesadillas and served with their fajitas, and fast, great service. No Mas is no comparison, but it is located downtown - which makes it convenient; yet, I really can't recommend No Mas any more."},{"name":"Dirty Frank's Hot Dog Palace","address":"248 S 4th St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"YUM.

For the record, their sauces are my favorite in all of the lower mainland, the naan is super tasty, no complaints with flavors. My complaint is the chcicken they use these days in the sauces. It is really really bad. Over the years the chicken has been hit and miss, more miss. It tastes like either chicken that has been defrosted for days then cooked, or cooked already, refrigerated then re-cooked because it tastes OLD and it is tough to chew. Guys, please change this because I love your food but the chicken has become unedible. I haven't eaten inside in years and I 100% get takeout probably once a month, so I don't know if they reserve the bad chicken for takeout or something but it tastes old. It's really unfortunate.

We came here on a Saturday around noon and only waited about 15 minutes to be seated.  It was busy and crowded, but not overwhelmingly so.The cart ladies weren't too aggressive that day, although I do wish they were able to speak enough English to at least say if the contents of their dim sum dishes are vegetable, bean, animal or mineral.  My vegetarian friend definitely got a mouthful of pork when trying an unidentified dumpling.  Speaking of pork, their BBQ pork buns were really good - a little too much of the bread for me, but that may be the way those buns are.  The filling was sweet and tasty.Another deliciosity was some kind of piece of lightly fried fish wrapped around sauteed veggies and tied with a spring onion.  SO GOOD.  The fish was cooked perfectly.  Too bad we didn't know it's name and never saw the cart again, or we would have gotten several more.One of the best parts of the meal was some kind of green leafy vegetable that was cooked right by our table, then drizzled with a delicious sauce.  The cart lady identified the vegetable as \\"broccoli,\\" although it looked more like leaves on long thick stems and tasted like a combination of spinach, asparagus and broccoli.  It was bright green and delicious and I really wish I knew what it was.We got one of those glutinous coconut balls wrapped around a filling for dessert.  Now, at Chau Chow City we got those and they had granulated sugar and chopped nuts inside.  Here, there was a delicious fresh mango filling!!  Is that normal?  I have no idea!  Can I find it somewhere else?  I wouldn't even know how to ask!  But it was yum!My only concern was that when we paid our bill and asked for an explanation of the different ways they charged for the items, the lady at the cash register did not want to answer.  It was clear that she spoke enough English to understand what we were asking, and yet she just kind of ignored our questions.

There's a huge patio, which is a great plus in the warmer weather, and the bar and dining area have been made over to rival any place I've been in New Orleans. It feels right in that sense (with one exception, which i'll get to later.) We got a nice oval table in a bay window so had plenty of room (granted we were 4 down from 6 when we reserved). The menu is sort of a New England take on n'awlins cuisine in the inevitable \\"we have a small plate sharing menu, so order a couple of things each\\" (God, when is this small plates bullshit gonna' END???) I ordered the BBQ shrimp over grits, the fried boneless chicken thighs with white gravy. I thought both were excellent. the shrimp were just the right spice with delicious BBQ sauce over grits. Overall a great dish.  The fried chicken was two boneless thighs. They were good size, perfectly fried, spiced and cooked perfectly. They were juicy and really good.We got an order of excellent biscuits for the table with delicious honey butter.  I also tried some of my friends dishes: pork cracklin's were basically deep friend pieces of fat, but not in a particularly good way.  I also had a bite of Crispy short rib boudin croquettes, which were good but didn't have a definable crispy or short rib taste.As far as the pricing and share ability, here is one problem with B&B -- the prices are slightly high for what you are getting, which were all appetizer sized portions, i'd put most of them at about $15 a plate, they should be more in the $12 range. And a large portion of the menu is not easily shared. How do you realistically share soup, chili, and other things that don't come in small packages that are actually shareable? The drinks menu pushes southern classics, heavy on the brown liqueurs and it's fine. Nothing remarkable.For dessert we had the beignets, which weren't Cafe-du-Mond-good, but they were pretty tasty and a nice end to the meal.The service was well paced, though we all found the waiter a little cold.  You don't want Boston brusque in a southern themed restaurant. They should try pretending they are in the south and friendly.  One thing i count in New Orleans was the wait staff everywhere i want was genuinely friendly.  They need a little of that here for sure.Oh, and back to the one glaring (i mean literally GLARING) problem with the space.  To get from the entrance to the main dining room, you have to walk through an awkward space that is part holding area for the shellfish (all on ice in a long case) and the VERY brightly lit kitchen, ducking some structurally important columns along the way.  So you go from a warm inviting entry, through a cold fluorescent work area, to the dining room. It breaks up the otherwise charming warm space in jarring way.  I'm sure there's a way to fix this.So overall it was a very good, if not excellent experience. I give it a solid 3 1/2 stars out of 5. The problems are really in the price, the actual share-ability of the plates, and the lack of genuine charm.  If they can fix those problems, they'll have a winner.--Good southern-influenced American food offered on small plates. Need to keep track of how many you have eaten though. I left very full! Nice southern ambiance  although a bit loud.  Definitely worth trying.  [Plates] didn't feel very shareable to me either. Not like at a tapas bar. The oysters last night were fantastic. --Cute space, good food, friendly staff. Biscuits were to die for and the pork cracklings were fantastic. Fried chicken sliders were good enough but I'd opt for something more unique if I went again. \\"Shareable\\" plates weren't too shareable and came in a little too small of portions. Drinks were yummy and uniqueish but wouldn't kill for them. Overall yummy and comfortable, 3.65 out of 5 stars --I enjoyed the food and the company. In addition to the \\"shareable\\" aspect being dubious, I'd say it's not a good choice for a group - maybe a good date place? It was"},{"name":"Fox Bros.

It's an interesting concept and is nice if you have someone in your party that enjoys sushi, while still providing plenty of options for everyone.I've had their sushi a few times and it's just OK. I usually just stick to the burgers. I've had: Honey Brie Mine, The Dynamic Duo, The Black Truffle Cheeseburger. I think the Black Truffle burger has been my favorite so far. The Honey Brie Mine had way too much Bri, so I would consider ordering that again with about half as much cheese. The Dynamic Duo (braised short rib on top of the patty) was good, just a bit too much. Their spiked milkshakes are straight up amazing. The Jim Bean is my favorite (Jim Beam, vanilla ice cream, caramel, a pretzel). Service is one area this place lacks. One person in my party had a black pepper allergy and we were very clear that none of her food could have black pepper. The server still brought her food out with black pepper. Not cool. Another time while dining alone at the bar, I had some of the worst service I've ever received at a restaurant. I sat there for the first 10 minutes without anyone speaking to me and no water. When I finally ordered and got my meal, the bartender was around the corner the entire time drying glasses while my drink sat empty for at least 15 minutes. I would have continued to order more drinks and dessert, but I had to find someone else to get my ticket and just left. Very frustrating.

We love to load up with lots of veggies. They don't skimp. Sometimes they stock vegan sausage, which I have only had there on one occasion (vegan pizza day). If more of us request it, hopefully they will cary not more often. Even without the sausage, the veggie pizza is phenomenal. I'm sure non-vegan pizzas is great there too if you are into that sort of thing. The service is excellent. They treat you like a friend of the family.

My husband and I get full sharing a large vegan pizza loaded with veggies. I think that runs us about $15 or so.

Our drink order was taken quickly while enjoyed the fresh bread and tonight's butter, a Meyer Lemon Compound Butter.  They always have some sort of Compound Butter and it's AMAZING.

Finding the place was a little hard cause Google Maps at the time said it was on W. Peachtree St. when it actually was on the corner of Cypress St. and 6th.  I guess the name of the restaurant really should have tipped me off.  Now Cypress Street Pint & Plate has outdoor seating but it wasn't being utilized due to the colder weather.  When it comes to restaurants that have seating outdoors I do always prefer to sit outside.  Especially when the weather is nice.  So I get there and find the group of bloggers at set of tables.  The staff was great about accommodating a large group like us that never gives the establishment a heads up we are coming.    This is purely unintentional.  I settle in start thumbing through the somewhat standard Gastropub fare.  My eyes always go to the adult beverage list first and a few things did stand out as being pretty novel.  House wine was divided into \\"Good\\", \\"Better\\" and \\"Best\\" categories in which you could order a single glass or bottle.  My wife opted for the \\"Better\\" glass option which was served in wine tumbler.  Very cool since we have these at home already.  Now they served both draft and bottled beer except for one option.  You could get a can of Pabst Blue Ribbon which was also served in a paper bag for that extra bit of flare.  Several in the group chose this option.  I myself had their Cypress Street Ale.  Being a homebrewer I always like to try a bar's own concoction.  It was very similar to an Extra Pale Ale I have done before.  To the Sweatwater fans out there it was somewhere between a 420 and an I.P.A. from their line of brews.   For the meal my eyes were draw toward the Andouille and Chicken Sandwich with the side of fries.  The fries were pretty good I must say since I tend to favor larger cut fries.  The sandwich left much to be desired.  The veggies on the sandwich were fresh and the spicy mayo wasn't bad either.  I think the sandwich could have benefited from maybe Chorizo sausage instead of Andouille to kick up the heat level.  Last thing.  The service was absolutely terrific.  Not only did our server spring into action to get our group another table and chairs when more people arrived, but he was able to split up/combine/correct all of our tabs at the table.  The place does get a little loud at times due to the bare walls which just reflected all the sound.

Arrived 9:30AM, didn't get to the counter until 1:30PM. There are lawn chairs available and they're BYOB-friendly, so just come early with a group of friends, crack open some beers, and chat your wait away. The only thing is, the closer you get to the door, the stronger that delicious BBQ smell gets, so try your best not to start drooling!My boyfriend and I wanted to try at least a bit of everything, so here is our order and my thoughts on each item:**1-1/4 lb fatty brisket\\nAs my boyfriend would say, \\"the best piece of meat I have ever had in my life...it literally just melts in my mouth.\\" I'm personally super turned off by anything that has the word \\"fatty\\" in its name, but even I have to admit I thought the cut and tenderness of the meat was indescribable. The best part is that the fat is evenly distributed and marbleized throughout the entire cut, making each bite an awe-inspiring experience.**3/4 lb lean brisket\\nIf I were alone, I would have skipped the fatty brisket and just gotten the lean, but boy am I happy I didn't do that. The lean brisket is great, don't get me wrong, but I feel like the tenderness and melt-in-your-mouth aspect differs greatly from that of the fatty brisket. It still has that trait, yes, but because the mean is leaner, it doesn't feel as soft and moist as its fatty counterpart. The gentleman who prepared our order suggested we mix the fatty and lean for the best experience, and I'm glad we did. **1 lb pork ribs\\nMy boyfriend and I both disliked the pork ribs. The meat wasn't as tender as we had hoped and didn't fall off the bone. We actually struggled to even pull the meat off the bones, something we weren't expecting after trying that amazing brisket. I'll admit the flavor was good, but it wasn't anything that blew my mind.**1/4 lb sausage (which is 1 link)\\nI actually wish we ordered more sausage and less of the ribs. I thought the flavors and seasoning of the sausage were great, and just the single link left me wanting more. Of course, still not as great as the brisket (both fatty and lean), but definitely second on the list.**1/4 lb turkey\\nI hate turkey because it's normally prepared way too dry for my liking, but the turkey here was pretty good. It was moist and seasoned well, and probably one of the better pieces of turkey I've had in my life. Again, not as good as the brisket, and even the sausage, but still pretty good.**1/4 lb pulled pork\\nMy honest opinion -- don't waste your time with the pulled pork. I told my boyfriend and his friends this, and I'll tell everyone else in the world: pulled pork is practically all the same. All that matters are the flavors and seasoning, both of which the pulled pork at Franklin's lacked. Definitely on the bottom of the list for the meats I ordered.**A single side of coleslaw\\nJust your average slaw. Nothing special.We also shared some of the items his friends ordered:**A quart of potato salad\\nDecent potato salad, but again, nothing that wowed me. I noticed they added pickles to it; my boyfriend liked it, I was indifferent about it.**Banana bourbon pie\\nOriginally, we wanted to try the pecan pie but they sold out of that, so we settled for the next customer's favorite (according to the cashier). It was tasty, but again, it didn't blow my mind.Would I do it again? Eh, I'd probably consider the preorder if I ever plan a trip to Austin again. Or maybe even buying the chilled brisket. I doubt I'll ever want to wait in that crazy line for food again, though I will admit, the experience was definitely worth it."},{"name":"Ramen Tatsu-Ya","address":"8557 Research Blvd, Ste 126","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Solid ramen!

This is also a really great place to just sit down and grab a cup of coffee.

Now, as a 27 year old, I try to go and bring as many of my friends as I can, so they can experience this odd adventure into real Chinese brunch fare.Ambience: Chau Chow used to be nicely decorated... in the 80's. The lack of renovations since is obvious. The place is a dump and the bathrooms are digusting, but who cares?  It adds character to the place and in a sense, I actually think the owners of Chau Chow are proud of this fact.Food: In the morning there's dim sum and at 3:00am, the place is packed with club-goers finding a place to eat late at night. Debauchery as its best. There is plenty of chinese girls pushing carts with various dim sum on them. Most of them don't know English and to get what you want, you just simply point at the food and they will stamp your bill with what you ordered. The dim sum taste authentic and there really are so many good choices - you better come with an empty stomach. As for the late nights, stop on by to see why the drunks swarm in on here. Get a bowl of rice and order beef, chicken, duck, seafood, etc. to go along with your meal. The chinese watercress with garlic is probably their best dish. Enjoy the food and the diverse drunk-laden crowd!Service: Hahaha! If you want something, you need to ask for it. Once you order and you find yourself needing something else, don't be afraid to walk up to someone and ask for it. They expect it!Price: Inexpensive, both for dim sum and the late nights. You won't go for broke here.The four stars I give here is for the quality of food. I take into consideration what the restaurant is meant for, so the four stars I give to Chau Chow is by no means an indication that I think it's equivalent to lets say, Pho Republique. They cater to a different crowd. If you're looking for spectacular decor and excellent service, you need to go elsewhere."},{"name":"Seasons & Regions Seafood Grill","address":"6660 SW Capitol Hwy","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Mothra Says........... Quality and FreshnessSo Andrew has mentioned Seasons and Regions to me for some time and is one of his favorite restaurants.  On a recent Sunday afternoon, I wanted to take K to a new restaurant; as it seems we continue to go to our 6 or 8 favorites over and over.We hopped into the Mothra mobile and headed over to Seasons and Regions which is halfway between Hillsdale and Multnomah Village in SW Portland.   Andrew had advised me that it is superb dining with fresh NW Seafood at its core.  We parked easily and entered to a mostly full restaurant.  We were greeted and five minutes later we were seated in a covered area outside on a partly sunny/cloudy Oregon April afternoon.Chelsea greeted us as our server and provided menus.  We quickly made our choices but first ordered two glasses of a 2014 French white wine:  Domaine D' Augeron.  Quite good.  As K and I people watched, we noticed some of the entrees walking by.  Many were off of the brunch menu, and some off of the lunch menu.  One that I will try the next time I am in (yes indeed, there will be a next time), was the fried oysters with fries.  Wow, not only looked delicious but smelled fantastic as well.   Also, there was a shrimp and dungeons crab salad that arrived next table over that a woman with an appetite got very excited about.  I concur, that looked really tasty.Within about 12 minutes, my wageyu 1/3 lb cheeseburger with all the accompaniments, and exceptionally well seasoned \\"hot to the touch\\" fries arrived then; K's two loaded rockfish tacos with black beans and Spanish rice greeted her.  I have never had wageyu beef before, so I was excited.  However, these hot fries were simply calling out my name.  I must have had a dozen before attempting to bite into my burger.  I will say that was a fresh hamburger.  The crunchy lettuce, red onions, sliced tomato mayo and of course melted cheese was really tasty.  K got after her two fish tacos as well.   Chelsea did check in on us but could tell that we were very satisfied with our plates.    No dessert, no coffee but, we definitely will be back.

Similarly, the shrimp and grits were fantastic. The girts were creamy, cheesy and worked great with medium sized shrimp that had been sauteed. The pecan pie really sealed the deal and was really the best part of the meal. The salty, sweet caramel combined with the roasted pecans and crumbly pie crust was simply phenomenal. Top that with the accompanying ice cream and you are in heaven. The restaurant also has a nice patio and is in a great part of town (with many similar bars and restaurants within walking distance).

First, not sure where all the bad service reviews came from. Maybe we hit it on a good day (Sunday by the way). Our server was awesome. We did sit at the bar though. She was super friendly, very helpful and quick. No problem on the service front. Food came fast too, so no problem there. I was considering taking the challenge, which is three loaded dogs (burger, dog, chilli and cheese on a hot dog bun) in under an hour, but since I didn't know if I'd enjoy the food, I opted against it. I got the ZuZu shaft and the blue collar deep fried burger. The dog was good, and really big if you like that kind of thing (that's what she said). A little too big for my liking but I made due. The bun was kind of like the sub roll type, and very good. Soft and moist, although my buddy said he would have liked it toasted. It came with home made sauerkraut and spicy mustard. Simple yet good. But not crave worthy. Not sure what it was, but I was left wanting something more, and not just toppings. The burger was the first deep fried burger I ever had, so I was intrigued and willing to take a chance. Again, not bad, but not crave worthy. It came with a deep fried burger, obviously, and honey mustard. A sweet tangy burger, but again, nothing I'll be craving later. The best option were their fries. Great fries. Crispy outside soft inside, and the real killer was the sausage gravy you could get with it. THAT might be crave worthy! The sausage was so chunky you could eat it with a fork. Fantastic. I'd get the sausage gravy by itself if I could. My wife got a coffee shake which was very good, and the Gorgonzola burger, which she also confirmed left her wanting more. But the atmosphere was cool, I could get a beer and watch the game and the food was solid. I won't be making any special trips though. If you want a great burger, go to Five Guys or better yet, go to Cali and to In n Out. My buddy even said Chilli's had a superior burger, which is saying a lot when the place is called \\"Tasty Burger\\".

It's classy but pretty casual. The tables are done nicely and there is enough space in between seating areas to where it's private but still open and not secluded. The staff was, for the most part, very friendly, though our waitress left us alone a bit too much on our visit (she could have been a little more present). Still, overall, that portion was great. There is parking on nearby lots (on the road running behind Flip Flops and Tin Lizzys), and South City Kitchen does do reservations.The menu for Sunday brunch is almost exactly what you'd expect for typical southern fare. There are a lot of options, though a lot are relatively similar (a lot of grits, waffles, fried chicken based dishes), and the prices are reasonable considering the quality and quantity of food you get.As for the food itself, the biscuits/cornbread they gave each table was AWESOME (especially the cornbread- very sweet!) as was the honeyish margarine that came with the food. The food took a decent amount of time, but the wait wasn't ridiculous. I had the grits and grillade, which is basically pork medallions with a tomato and peoper sauce, alonf with cheese grits and sugar snap peas, all of which was delicious (and I'm not big on grits). My girlfriend had the fried okra (awesome) and a twist on the BLT that she said was good, but I didn't try. The portions were big enough that we boxed parts of both meals and passed on dessert, having coffee instead, which was good in and of itself. Overall, really good food and a good experience. It's also in a great central location, which is another plus. I was pleasantly surprised coming out of South City Kitchen at the quality of the food and overall experience, and I  don't understand why it's not regarded as one of Atlanta's best.

The jambalaya was one of the best I've had (especially when firing it up a notch with the hot sauce) and the chicken was cooked extremely well with a perfect breading crust even withOUT the secret herbs and spices...the dumplings were out of this world though. Chicken. killer. Broth. KiLLeR. Dumplings. HUGE and KILLER. Me? Dead~~Polished it off with a little peanut butter pie. Basically a decadent peanut butter cup that greased the way to rolling ourselves out the door. Oh did I mention the drinks? Porch swing lemonade...don't listen to them about the sage--this is an imposter Mojito in disguise. The hurricane? Strong as ever...delish.Glad to see there's some good southern food in Portland.

We drove out of our way, and waited 45 minutes for a table for a mediocre burger. The most interesting thing was ogling the concert posters that wallpaper the dining room. We ordered the pickled vegetables, which I was impressed with when they arrived in a canning jar. The waitress popped the top, and they were all ours! The black and white fries were disappointing. White, because they were tossed with cheese, garlic, and white truffle oil. Black, because they were served with squid ink aioli. The fries themselves were nothing special, and the toppings were out of balance. And, if you ask us, the squid ink aioli left much to be desired, and consider this warning: be very careful not to drip it on anything, as it will stain instantly. On to the burgers! I ordered the namesake Foster Burger, which had roasted jalape√±os and Foster sauce. Nothing to write home about, at all. The beef lacked flavor and was a bit dry, even though it was ordered medium. IMO, Portland has many more delicious burger options. For instance, the Fir Burger at Doug Fir is much, much better."},{"name":"No Mas!

I had a piece and my wife was still only able to finish half of it. I thought this dish was pretty good, nothing spectacular though.Tacos De Pescado: The tacos were pretty filling. The addition of jicama coleslaw topping really helped the tacos. Though even with the coleslaw, they were just okay. I have had much better fish tacos at a more inexpensive restaurant.

Within minutes, our table was covered with a steaming pot of broths, a plate full of vegetables and meat, udon noodles, along with sauces and spices. The waitstaff (our waiter plus 2 other waitresses) was so helpful in explaining the different types of broths, how the spices blended with the sauces, how to cook the meats, and how long to cook each vegetable and noodles. They even personally served us a couple rounds until we got the hang of it! Afterward, they allowed us to relax and enjoy ourselves. The experience was new, our meal was light and flavorful, the atmosphere was clean and simple and the staff was knowledgeable. For the first time in quite a while, we did not feel rushed to have our table turned. Truly a pleasure! I think Tokyo offers many different experiences and palates. If you don't like one, try a different section! But certainly don't base your opinion on a lunch buffet (Chinese food is better served at a buffet as sushi should be served to order...just an fyi).

While there are many options, the separate ordering bays for different items can be confusing. Thankfully, I knew what I wanted. I ordered a Grilled Chicken sandwich with fries and a Diet Coke. The Grilled Chicken sandwich was juicy and satisfying and the fries were hot, crisp, and not too greasy. If that is not enough, the immense toppings bar has almost every topping under the sun, such as red ripe tomatoes, crisp iceberg lettuce, tangy onions, pickles, relish, and even saut√©ed onions and mushrooms! I also like the Roast Chicken Platter, which is juicy, enough for 2, and comes with two sides! The service was friendly and fast! If there is a downside, I would say that it can be hard to find a table due to the popularity and location of Cosmic Ray's as my mom and I had to wait five minutes for a table to open up. Otherwise, the atmosphere is clean and fits in with the theme of Tomorrowland, plus, Sonny Eclipse, an animatronic alien croons tunes.

Even though the place was obviously very busy, our server took the time to make us feel welcome, and was extremely helpful. I tried a biodynamically grown Chardonnay from the founders selection (absolutely delicious), and my friend tried short pours of a few different light-bodied reds.

I've driven thru many times for a yummy cream-filled eclair and a cup of coffee. They have many other delicious goodies that I've tried, but I am really stuck on that cream-filled eclair! I've also tried several different flavors of mochi ice-cream when the family was in town. They were all delish, especially the fruit flavored ones. Also sampled was the Mango Ice Shower. This was okay...it was just ice and mangoes. I'm reading here on other reviews that it should have had condensed milk, but I guess they forgot it in ours.

For a place looking to hire \\"friendly\\" staff, they have a lot of work to do. I went in at 11:30 before the lunch rush and had one person in front of me placing a large order. There was one cashier, two girls behind her going between making milkshakes and staring vacantly off into space, one guy bagging up orders, and another guy trying really hard to impress the rest of them, but avoiding working at all costs.  After about 2-3 minutes of the person in front of me placing her order and the cashier asking for help entering it into the POS, a line was forming behind me and the guy bagging food started asking his cohorts to man the other register and take orders. He asked at least three times and each time he was met by the vacant stares and open maws of the three other unoccupied occupants that I can only assume worked there. I was finally able to place my order after the person in front of me was done, no thanks to the rest of the staff. I said what I wanted and only had to repeat myself once. I gave them my name and of course the misspelled it. It's not even a hard name, and what they wrote could barely pass as a name. The food took several minutes to prepare. I got it to go and drove back to my office which is a few minutes away. When I was finally able to masticate, I found that the burger was soggy and drenched in sauces. I say sauces because there we clearly two different sauces and the burger I ordered only advertised one. I say soggy because pieces of the bun were tearing off and sticking to my fingers. GROSS, but I've had worse. When I finished there was a yellow and red pool of disgusting at the bottom of the plastic food container that the food came in. The fries were cold and soggy as well, but still somewhat tasty.This is the second time I've been to a Smash Burger, both at this location.

Sorry Austin I'm apparently not hip enough to enjoy waiting 4 hours for good, but not good enough brisket, just to be seen there. I think I know why there's so many people who call it the best brisket ever; These are all folks who haven't been eating Good BBQ for thirty-years, since they just moved here to Austin from parts unknown, where BBQ is just chicken. You can go to Mickelthwaits, Muellers, or Stileswitch, (or even save time over Franklins with a nice drive down an take yer pick of places in Lockhart, or head to Muellers in darn-tootin' Taylor) get the same quality food or better, and be in and out in 20-45 min, and be getting on with your day, or god forbid, get it for dinner!I think the saddest part of the whole thing is that I was super excited to finally try Franklins...

I'll admit when I opened it, I was thoroughly disappointed at what I saw since I was really really looking forward to a mouthful of eggs and grease.  And while frankly, the sandwich didn't satisfy my hangover desires, it was a really great light weight breakfast sandwich.

We went there for Sunday lunch with a friend and she told me to be careful of my bag because her friend's bag got stolen in the restaurant couple weeks ago.   Her bag was on an empty chair next to her and someone grabbed it and ran out.   Then while we were eating there the table next to us had the exact same thing happen to them. We didn't see what happened but suddenly we see many people running out of the restaurant and yelling something.  We overheard that a lady's bag was stolen AGAIN.   About 30min later a police officer came.  The restaurant is very loud and almost always packed so it's really not a surprise that most people dining there wouldn't even know what had just happened.  Imagine my friend only just warned me and immediately it happens again. So be very cautious of your belongings if you sit along the walkway leading from the entrance.  It must be something that happens regularly and the staff should really make an effort to prevent or make warnings. As for the actual visit...I go for Dim Sum very regularly, this was our 2nd visit to this place  and this time around the food didn't taste as good (nor fresh) as the 1st.  The Shrimp dumplings were too thick and too 'creamy' (meaning too much paste compare to the shrimp, and wasn't very fresh).  Some of my favorites like braised pork pieces, chicken feet tasted a-okay.  Egg plant stuffed with fish paste and Tofu stuffed with fish paste were both not very exciting.

WE lived in Orlando for years, so having a new place to try when we came for vacation was a treat.  Location:  Convenient spot in the middle of CityWalk at Universal.  Yes, you will have to pay for parking (unless you have season pass) at City Walk and take that long walk (unless you valet).  Atmosphere:  Very hip but casual.  The place is huge! And a trendy looking bar on the top level that wasn't open during lunch but I am sure it was be very cool at night. Family friendly : My family of 4 loved this place!  This is a great family restaurant because it has TVs in the tables that entertain the kids with games and digital art.  My son is 4 and created fish that he could put in the digital aquarium so he could see it swim around the entire time we ate.  I think he made about 6 fish. And the true family test is did they eat?  YEP my son loved his \\"bento box\\" of mac&cheese, carrots and fruit.  It included a rice crispy \\"sushi\\" for dessert. My daughter is only 1 1/2 so she is hard to please but she enjoyed the fruit and origami menu.Food:  Like the name implies it is a mix of sushi and burgers.  My husband and I were in the mood for burgers so we skipped the sushi choices.  We both enjoyed our burger choices. I got the CBCLT with bacon coleslaw- the burger was good even though I did not like the brioche bun much and though the slaw was too large of a portion for me to finish it was just the right creamy.  The spiked milkshakes sounded delicious but I went for a simple class of wine to avoid teasing my toddler.  So if you are considering a place in the Universal area for lunch or dinner and you feel like burgers or sushi- give this one a shot.

I recommend making reservations, particularly if you too are a hungry beast after a night of heavy drinking and debauchery. Even with reservations, you might have to wait a few minutes at the bar, but this is cool if you are an alcoholic like me and also obsessed with Bloody Marys. One of the best parts about a Masa brunch is the corn bread and some kind of whipped butter. My BGF Nathan I. and I stopped in this weekend and were feeling particularly gluttonous, so we had appetizers in addition to main courses. I was kind of embarrassed by how much I ate, but it was totally worth it. We loved on some deep fried short rib tamales, breakfast tacos, eggs benedict, and steak and eggs. And yes, we did clean our plates. My only complaint is that the menu said something about avocado on the eggs benedict, but it was actually a somewhat icky avocado puree. But now I know - next time I will just ask that it be left off."},{"name":"Franklin Barbecue","address":"900 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I went in the middle of the week one day in April.

The concept is so interesting, but there is plenty of diversity in food so it's easy to please any size group. We sat outside where there were misters to keep us cool and excellent service so we were never without drinks. We had a few sushi rolls and it was delicious! High quality tuna, huge 8-10 piece rolls, and a fun place to hang out. Love the decor, casualness, and attention to detail.

The appetizers (broccoli & carrots & ranch, fruit salad that look canned, & flavorless pork with some bread thingy) and the pre-show did nothing to change our low expectations.Once we were brought into the seating area, they put us at the end of the row where there wasn't room.  They made everyone scoot over so everyone was touching.  Not exactly comfy and didn't really make thing seems so great.But then we met our waitress Marilyn (hope I spelled that right!) She was great!  She said that we are only supposed to get one beer but she kept bringing the pitcher by, asking if we wanted more.  The entrees were okay.  The chicken was HUGE and the side dishes of rice and veggies were pretty okay.  Definitely better than I was expecting.  Since we were at the end of the row, we could see what was on Marilyn's cart.  One of my friends asked if she could try the mac & cheese that was for the kids.  Marilyn more than happily obliged and gave us both mac & cheese and chicken nuggets!For dessert, I had heard that the brownie a la mode was a cake with whipped cream.  Well, we got actually brownies with both whipped cream and ice cream!  And it was quite tasty!As for the cards at the end that talk about tipping...I completely understand it.  Foreign tourists often don't tip because its not customary for them to do it in their countries.  And these waiters/waitresses make their living on tips.  If most of the people in the audience don't tip because there are not cards and they don't know that they're supposed to, then the wait staff suffers.  It's no different than when you go to a restaurant and they have the tip suggestions at the bottom.Anyways, I wouldn't recommend paying full price for this attraction but for $16 a piece, I enjoyed it."},{"name":"Leo's Place Diner","address":"655 Main St","city":"Waltham","stars":"4","text":"Great food, great service & even excellent music the whole time!

It looks like a hole in the wall type of joint from the outside. The interior of the restaurant is a bit dated and the vibe is almost like a cult; warm and friendly for the regulars but cold and standoffish for the newcomers. My husband and I have actually been here a few times before. We LOVE the food and the portion but we can't say the same about the service.We headed there on a Sunday night with the bro in law and his GF.  The bar seamed more casual so we opted to sit there. The owner/manager brought us menus and I tried to make small talk. He didn't seem interested.  The server/bartender came by to tell us about the 35 cent wing special and took our drink orders.  I went with a half carafe of house red wine for $9.95 (what a steal!) and the boys went with the house draft beer, (20 oz for a little more than 3 bucks!)At 35 cents each, we had to try some of the wings! The options were plain, buffalo and terriyaki so we got half a dozen of the buffalo and terriyaki.  The server made a mistake and had to take back the naked wings and transform them into the Asian inspired wings. She said they were the \\"best\\" ones!We also split a Fisherman's platter sans the actual fish for an appetizer.  There were generous servings of whole clam bellies, clams, scallops, shrimps. fries and a few onions rings.  I wish more tarter sauce was served but we settled for the 4 tiny paper cups that came with the entree.We were almost full from the colossal seafood platter and wings but we ordered a few entrees instead.  Even though it was only 6:30 PM, we missed the prime rib.  It was SOLD OUT! The server mentioned that it's a very popular item and sells out QUICK.  Our loss. We've had it before and it really is delicious.There was so many items to choose from the menu we didn't know what to do.  There were Italian and Mediterranean specialties, grilled foods, comfort foods, seafood and burgers and sandwiches. Although I really wanted the lamb lollipops, we went with the full rack of ribs, lobster pie and moussaka.  Most of the entrees came with 2 sides and a salad.For sides, there were sweet potatoes, fries, corn, squash and mashed potatoes but I think they forgot our mashed potatoes.  The corn was super bland not sweet/The baked ribs were extremely tender and the BBQ sauce had the perfect balance of sweet and tangy.The mousaka wasn't as fresh and tasty as I remembered it.  It was like a pre-made refrigerated piece that was reheated.  The Bechamel sauce wasn't as gooey as anticipated.  I was a bit disappointed.Since we couldn't get the prime rib, we split the lobster pie.  There were large chunks of lobster claw meat soaked in butter and topped with crumbs.  We had to ask for the rolls and I made mini lobster rolls with the lobster chunks.The food was really good and we were totally stuffed. We'd definitely come back for the food.  Can't say much about the service.  I thought it was weird that they kept making us hold on to our dirty forks and knives.. like why can't you just get us new ones?? Also, the server blatantly looked at our signed credit card slip while we were still sitting at the table. Can you say weird? Luckily we left a 20% TIP.The total was $100.00 for 6 pics wings buffalo\\n6 pcs wings terriyaki\\nwine half carafe\\n3 (20) oz draft beers\\nsoda\\nfishmen's platter entree\\nwhole rack of rib platter entree\\n2 side salads\\nmousaka entree\\nlobster pie entree\\ntax\\nI thought it was a great deal!"},{"name":"Franklin Barbecue","address":"900 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Worth the wait!

My little friend Dina (she's very little... but not quite a legal midget) keeps me informed on all the places we need to go and try. So one day she tells me that for the month of July this place in the South End is offering $5 margaritas.  Well, I said, \\"FIVE DOLLAR margaritas.  SURE! Let's go!\\" I guess you can get me pretty excited over margaritas.  Well, not only were they doing the $5 margarita thing, but they were doing this crafty $29 3-course meal thing.  So I did that.  For my appetizer I got talapia and mussels in a cilantro sauce with a tequila floater.  Very good, I must say.  Little Dina got a salad, which she described as being \\"a very good one\\" and \\"with some cheesy dressing thing\\".  This was followed by my meal, which was steak frites - the steak was cooked to perfection and I ate every single piece of it... and it was huge!  I guess those margaritas made me hungry.  Or WAITING for the margaritas made me hungry.  I had to ask twice for a margarita, and almost three times... but she came by and realized on her own that she had forgotten it.  She had even brought my friend her drink, and just forgot mine.  So that lost some points with me.  She wasn't friendly at all either, no smiles, little to no personality, probably mad that we were a table of 5 girls her age, or maybe she just had a bad night, OR maybe she has some other deep rooted issues that I can't even imagine... I don't know, but I'm big on the smiling thing.  Anyway... back to the food... for dessert I got flan.  And all I have to really say about that is YUM.  My friends all got this chocolaty thing baked inside a corn husk.  Very creative presentation, and obviously anything filled with chocolate wins with me.  Thumbs up.So it was good besides the service (she also messed something up on the bill that we needed to have corrected, and then acted annoyed with us like it was our fault, but anyway...)  Actually, I can't say that stood true for the hosts and bartenders.  I liked the hosts, they were very friendly, and the bartender had a heavy pour, which definitely left me with a big smile plastered on my face after my 3 margaritas.

Needless to say, I was very much enjoying my drink, was not intending to get a second one as I was the driver, and was really irritated at losing it. We spoke up and I was offered another one, but I'm not looking to get tipsy before I drive home. So we paid for drinks we didn't get to finish. The waitstaff needs to chill out and let people get up and down from their tables. Especially if you're going to have a counter in your restaurant for dessert. When there's full drinks on the table it might be a good idea to give it a second and see if they're coming back, and instead of feeding your customer another beer, maybe take it off their bill.I'm usually a little turned off by how crowded and stuffed it is in here, I don't like feeling like a sardine in a loud tin, but let it go because the food here is so good.

It was a little too hot next to the window as they were relying on ceiling fans and not AC, but that's my only complaint.

The baked tomato that came with the eggs benedict was fantastic and the onions on the home fries were yummy and the holandaise was perfection.

So sad, too bad.  :o(But my co-worker & I got extremely lucky last Saturday. We waited in a short line, approx. 30-40 minutes (which went very fast because we chatted non-stop with other out of town patrons and locals in line). We talked a lot about the hype of Franklin BBQ, and expectations, and hell: just the excitement of being in a short line and likely to get thru the doors before they slapped a sold out sign on the door! But we had NO IDEA what kind of amazing food and service we were in for.The guys that own this place, run this place. It was so refreshing and awesome to see genuinely nice, down-to-earth people doing what they love. The guys behind the counter were hardworking and extremely charismatic as they prepped food. I had the brisket, and my co-worker ordered a plate of just about everything. THIS BBQ IS ON A WHOLE OTHER LEVEL OF AMAZING. It was simple, clean eating, delicious texture and perfect flavor. I am serious when I say everything I have ever eaten before and any BBQ to follow from here on out....has been & will be PATHETIC in comparison to Franklin BBQ. I cannot stop raving about it, it's annoying & rediculous. SMITTEN...and not just with the cute boy behind the counter, haha. I don't even care that it doesn't have air conditioning, it's worth it!!!What they do here is a craft, pure artisan craft. I can't wait to go back. My God, people....please, please eat here (but please be in line behind me, haha). It really is the best you will ever have.

OK, so I get its a bit cold out right now but not really an excuse to go home early. Let me back up.My wife and I discovered this place early fall by accident driving down Mississippi. The first time we walk in, at 8:35, the hostess in no uncertain terms tells us they close at 9:00. A little odd but we overlooked that and had a nice, not over the top, but nice meal. So we decide to head out for a bite last night. COLD, yes, DANGEROUS, no. We get to this place at 8:01 (remember they close at 9:00) and after watching the cook and server argue about weather they were going to seat us or not, told us they were closed. I am always a little amazed at how the small, independent restaurant can turn away business. last night is the kind of night that CREATES loyal customers. I am wondering if their business is so good as to turn off a couple who eats out regularly and quite often with a large group of friends. Especially in an economic climate where restaurants are closing left and right.Best of luck but we won't go back."},{"name":"Soul Fire BBQ","address":"182 Harvard Ave","city":"Allston","stars":"4","text":"Can you believe that I go to a BBQ place for their ONE vegetarian dish even though I'm not vegetarian? hahaha this has nothing to do with the quality of their meats though, I love their vegetarian rice and beans, wow, actually just thinking about it is making me hungry, it is so delish and the salsa they have is just spicy enough to enjoy oh so much!Another thing that I love but don't get to eat often (just because it must be about 1000 calories) is their fried dough...it is to die for! the honey butter sauce they put on tastes like heaven, not I'm afraid that I've gained a pound just by writing about it!Anyways, I recently started to try more things on the menu and I have come to also love the pulled chicken, it is so tender, juicy and delicious it is quite the experience.Now about the staff, I have not had anything but good things to say about them, they are always very nice and attentive so I always try to tip them very well.For first timers, beware that this is a BBQ place, not a bar (even though there is a bar inside the restaurant) and they will not serve you alcohol unless you order something to eat."},{"name":"Paul's Omelettery Restaurant","address":"2211 Granville Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"A while back I came to Paul's with a few friends and we decided to do a mystery dish where we each chose a dish for another person. At the end we'd have to guess which dish we got from the menu. The server was very accommodating and filled our coffees and teas regularly despite this place being packed. There was a huge line up and was glad one of our friends came super early to grab us a table. In conclusion, we ordered:-Spanish Omelette (4/5-$9.75): This omelette had tomatoes, onions, red peppers, salsa and 3 types of cheeses (edam, cheddar and cream cheese). Super delicious. The egg was not dry and the cheese blended in well with the veggies. Omelettes comes with a few slices of toast, jam, orange slices and some hash browns. -Da Vinci Omelette (4/5-$10.25): This one had chorizo, mushroom, tomatoes, spinach and feta. Due to the mushrooms, it was more wet compared to the spanish but kick of spice from the chorizo tasted so good with creaminess of the feta. Honestly, both omelettes were equally good. -Traditional Eggs Benedict (4/5- $9.50 Large): You have the option of ordering half a Benedict, but who can have just one? Typical benedict done well. The egg yolk was running and the cheese sauce on top was creamy and delicious. This came with a side of hashbrowns. I'd definitely go back again if I'm in the area or feeling for some breakfast at odd hours.

The place was packed and we had to wait in a short line to order but it moved pretty quickly. The workers were friendly, and service was good despite them being slammed. Inside seating is limited but they also have a few tables outside. On to the food- the 7th trimester was delicious. Biscuit with an over-medium egg and bacon surrounded by creamy man n cheese.  My boyfriend literally said, \\"This is what I have been searching for my whole life,\\" as he was eating it. I found the bacon to be a tadddd bit too salty, but that certainly didn't stop me from eating it. I also wanted more sauce to balance out the biscuit and pasta. I would get this again but would ask for it with an over easy egg to get more of a runny yolk or maybe with a side of gravy. Also, I came prepared with my own sriracha, which was a necessary addition for me. They had a few hot sauces set out but I did not see sriracha. Was not a fan of the cinnamon rolls. They were overly sugary and buttery. They were just completely crystalized with sugar and were missing the soft doughy component.

He told me it wasn't flavourful enough, but I think if you're looking for something a bit less oily, this would be a good choice.  There was a good amount of fish balls and fish cake slices.

I have also been here at times when the service itself is pretty slow. They have a pretty good selection of margaritas and I can say that their frozen strawberry margarita is excellent. The menu has both Tex Mex and Cajun items and they have a special vegetarian section. They give large portions and are willing to do some substitutions.

I really think the place deserves more like 3.5, although the food was good the overall experience just didn't warrant 4 stars.  I went this past Saturday night with 6 friends.  We got there at 8pm and we were told it would be about a 20 min wait, which wasn't a problem until it turned in to an hour wait. 3 margaritas a piece later and our vibrating beeper thing finally went off. We were sat quickly, but our waiter was slightly aloof.  It took him a while to get to us. When he finally got around to taking our order he did a decent job and even asked if I was a vegetarian when I ordered the black bean and corn empanada because he could substitute plain white rice for their chicken stock laden Cajun rice.  Our food arrived quickly and correctly and the table agreed that everything was good. I was surprised by my empanada because it looked more like a chimichanga, but it was at least good. We informed the waiter that one of the people in our group was celebrating a birthday and we wanted to order a birthday dessert. We were sadly informed that they don't serve dessert.  The waiter did improvise and brought a frozen drink with a straw and a lit candle sticking out of the straw. We agreed we would take care of  the singing and he seemed relieved about that.  The bill came and it was less than $20 per person which to me is pretty amazing. I am used to $65-$100/per person dinners.  So with that said, I don't think you can beat the value of Border, but I wouldn't take anyone here that prefers real Mexican food, doesn't like noise/a big crowd or is looking for a romantic dinner.

I took a little peek at the French quarter room, which was really nice and the decor reminded me of a restaurant in NOLA called Commander's Palace. Service was great and our servers checked on us many times throughout the night. Our food came out fairly quickly. We got tapas to share and they were all really delicious:\\ncajun guacamole w/ chips \\nbaby kale salad\\nchicken wings white bbq sauce\\ncrispy short rib boudin croquettes (probably my favorite)cocktail:\\nvoodoo on the bayou ( YUM- reminds me of a non-frozen pina colada)For dessert, we got the fried beignets, which were so good (*drool*). We both were so stuffed from the main course and said \\"we will just have a bite\\" but we ended up eating  all 4 pieces. Felt like we were at cafe du monde!  YOU MUST GET THE BEIGNETS ! ! ! Overall, it really was just a great experience.  I definitely see this restaurant getting very popular in the future. This place does a wonderful job in making the customer feel like they have left Boston and transported to NOLA."},{"name":"Screen Door","address":"2337 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"My first chicken and waffles.

She looked at me like I had three heads and said what's in that? Being a Caribbean restaurant specializing in rum craft cocktails, I thought it wouldn't be a problem. I got some strange pineapple watered down drink with wayyy too much ice. I ordered dark rum for a floater, which it should have already been in the drink. It ended up being a $20 cocktail! My son ordered a Sprite, but we were told they had nothing for soda except coke. Then we ordered dinner. My bf and I ordered entrees and asked if they could simply grill a chicken breast for my son. She came back and said no, even though there is chicken all over the menu. The service in general was slow and they clearly didn't like the fact that I brought my child in to eat, even though it was before 7:00 pm. Not that time should matter either way...  We told the waitress to cancel our order and we ended up spending $40 on 2 nasty cocktails and a pineapple juice. If you are wanting a friendly island vibe, I would definitely not suggest this place.

I was impressed that we didn't need to wait long for dim sum at Sunday lunch hour.The biggest surprise was the chicken feet (phoenix claws)!! The texture was soft, chewy but not soggy, and tasty without being too salty. It's a bit sweet, a bit salty, a bit of garlic taste with some black bean sauce taste... great combo for your taste buds!In contrary, I'd recommend you to stay away from their fried dishes. The fried Taro ball was soggy with very unfresh greasy taste. We suspected they probably reused the frying oil way too many times, or it could have been days old left over oil. The typical dim sum dishes such as shrimp dumplings and shiu mai all tasted decent here.

The food is good, so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and not go as far to say it's definitely overpriced, but it's not quite cheap here. Lots of interesting dishes though - some classics, some twists on classics, and some creativity as well.

(We were doing an all-day Midtown restaurant-and-coffee-shop crawl to celebrate, and so were not in the business-wear sported by all of the other lunchtime customers.)Other reviews have already said so much that I will just share the one detail that, for me, earned them a solid fifth star: to save room for desert, my wife and I started with the friend green tomato appetizer, and then asked for a single fried chicken entre√© to share. Our \\"single entre√©\\" came out on two separate plates -- each with half of the chicken poised perfectly atop potatoes and beans; the presentation was so perfect that, had I not known, I would have assumed we were being served two separate entre√©s, rather than one that had been split!

We quickly ordered calamari and escargot and they were fantastic.I ordered Tony's own and was blown away by the amount of fresh seafood in the pasta (as well as the serving size).  We even had two in our party order things not on the menu and the chef took it with ease.

A smallish, unassuming building off Piedmont Ave., Fat Matt's is a paradise of tangy sauces and succulent meats. It's got good seating inside and out, and their prices are competitively inexpensive (read: nice 'n' low).I'd heard good things about their ribs (and they're in the freakin' name!), so I got the rib sandwich with a side of rum baked beans. It. Was. SUBLIME. The meat was excellently seasoned and incredibly tender, while the beans were tangy with a hint of sweetness. The service on Saturday afternoon was fast and I didn't have to wait long before I found myself in BBQ heaven.Quite frankly, I could have eaten double what I got even though it was very filling, just because I wanted to keep the flavor train chuggin' through town ALL day long! And by town, I mean my mouth. And by mouth, I mean that talky, chewy, open-and-shut part of my face that hosted 3 succulent pork ribs, 2 slices of bread, and a bevy of baked legumes.But I would be remiss, nay, downright NEGLECTFUL if I didn't mention their home-made sauce that they provided. Stuff's so good I could drink it straight. It's got sweetness, savory spice, a hint of heat, and maybe some of that indescribable quality that goes into all truly good food - love for what you do. I ended up buying some on the spot right after I finished eating. I've never done that at any other restaurant.Fat Matt's is first class BBQ. I'd recommend it to anybody, even vegetarians.

I called ahead to let them know that I had a group coming, and wanted to ensure that we would have a place just for us. They handled it no problem, and seated us in an area that was away from the larger dining area. The area wasn't closed off, but it was intimate enough for a bday gathering. We were seated at this massive table that I initially thought was too big until I saw how they presented the pizzas. The pizza is delivered on a large tin tray that requires a bit of space, so, I understood the need for the large table. The staff was very accommodating when it came to special bday requests such as: storing ice cream, taking group photos, providing a lighter for the bday candles, serving spoons, etc. A note to those planning to have a bday gathering here-- if you're having ice cream and cake, bring your own bowls, plates and serving utensils; DeSano only has tin trays, but we made them work! As far as the pizza goes, it's a solid spot for good pizza, and there's quite a variety of it.

I could have eaten that and left happy, but then my Rustic Raviolo came. It had a potato and basil and the most delicious tomato-cream sauce. My boyfriend was stealing it off my plate!

I fear Midwestern pizza like most people fear escargots, frog legs and pate. Well, add Bono Pizza to my list of places in Columbus that I will actually consume pizza. I would say that this list consists of three places, but honestly it's really just two: Bono and Clever Crow. Hounddog's is also a possibility, but when it comes down to it, the truth is I have only picked toppings off others' pieces of Hounddog's pizza. So, what I'm saying is: GO HERE. NOW. BONO IS AMAZING! It reminds me of East Coast pizza (a la Pepe's Apizza in New Haven or Bonobo in Portland, ME) - brick oven fired, not bread-heavy, and all about the ooey, gooey, melty blissfully well-picked ingredients. Tara, Susie, Bryant and I even got to watch the pizza dude make the pizzas (he was so jolly!) - it takes like 2 min each, because the brick oven is apparently 1800 degrees. No shit. Amazing and definitely the best pizza I've had in Columbus (Clever Crow is amazing too, but this is the style of pizza I prefer and completely endorse). We ordered the 3 for $25 special... the pizzas are 10\\" so three pizzas for four people was pretty much the perfect amount. I think we all got three pieces and shared what was left. I recommend the margarita pizza - but then I'm a girl who loves simplicity. The greek boy pizza and the one we got smothered in pepperoni were also fantastic. I would love to try this place again when I am slightly less... semi-drunk. ;) I would also like to thank Peggy - i think she is the owner? - so being so very, very kind to us and talking to us about ingredients and chatting in general... icing on the cake, my friends. Or, tomatoes on the pizza? (#notwinning, Mel...) The awesome thing about Bono is that is is a small divey place of European aesthetic, which is also attached to a convenience store somewhere random in Grandview. Yes, we got a bit lost finding it, but it was worth the SOS call to Bryant when we finally got there. So, being attached to a convenience store also means that Bryant was able to go grab a couple of bottles of wine while us ladies sat enraptured by the brick oven and our jolly pizza-man who was essplainin' the process. We were duly impressed. If you have not been here, I actually feel bad for you. Get thee to Bono Pizza, and fast.

I ordered the grilled asparagus (with nice char flavor) with garlic crostino and an interesting egg caesar (you can hardly pick up on the egg) - it's a good vegetarian dish, but a little too parmesan-y for my taste.

After tasting it, I came back a spoke to the \\"manager\\" she said it was their most favorite appetizer! I replied again that the other restaurants were serving food that was to be blunt, more interesting and flavorful, and that the heat of the sausage interfered with the other food.

Just make yourself a reservation unless you're happy with the bar.First, the staff is incredibly friendly & respectful. Second, they make great recommendations. Ate the Heirloom eggs after every single staff person I interrogated said it was a winner. It was.Third, I noticed that if you are a vegetarian, there are just as many interesting veggie options on this menu as there are meat-eater friendly options. So, you can be an upscale eater & not be limited to just the salad. I ate the charred Broccoli & it paired in a heavenly way with the butternut squash. In addition, instead of bread, they give you picked veggies -- that I think I ate up in no time.Fourth, this place is HUGE! It was a weekday night the night I went--and maybe 9pm.

I'd like to say that over the years we've developed our palate in various cuisines, Chinese being one of them. It's like that light bulb moment when you realize, \\"huh, Olive Garden isn't really Italian food?\\" Mind blown, right? Well, at Taipei Noodle Haus my palate is confused. The menu reads authentic but to be perfectly honest, I don't have a clue what Flavor Town we're in. The spring rolls, I swear, are the frozen Ling Ling ones from Costco. The pot stickers are good, claim to be hand made and they taste like it. My husband thinks they're the best ever. The sesame chicken is by far the best dish on the menu. I was disappointed in the spicy Szechuan noodles- strange sauce that isn't spicy in the least. (pay attention to that sauce- it shows up in a lot of dishes). The beef & broccoli is also a flavorless let down with the aforementioned sauce. The General Tso's chicken was a disappointment and again, made with that same. damn. sauce. Now, the strangest sauce of all award goes to the sweet & sour chicken- hands down. It's not the bright orange, not a color found in nature sauce BUT this is weird. It's not brown but it's not orange but it's not green. It has chunks of carrots, what I think are onions, bok choy and some other white unknown veggie floating around. It's semi thick and seems as though it's full of cornstarch and was totally flavorless. Absolutely not sweet nor sour. Thankfully, it came on the side in our order to go. Last confusing item- why Haus? This evokes Austrian or German influence, does it not? Maybe I missed that Rick Steve's travel special on Chinese and Austrian cultures colliding.\\nSo, why the 3 stars? The service is great- super friendly & quick and the sesame chicken really is good enough to earn 3 stars.

I was going to go with a healthier main course, like fish, but figured I'd go traditional and opted for the Buttermilk Fried Chicken. Again this was just okay. I just knew in my heart it would be packed with flavor and would be on a Paula Dean or just country grandmother type of tip, but it was pretty bland... hope this doesn't sound mean, but KFC original recipe is better. (IMHO). The sides were also just okay, pretty much bland... I thought potatoes would be buttery or atlas seasoned well or a healthy combination of them both, but again... bland. A true southerner definitely won't be satisfied with this dish, so opt for something else and get the fried chicken dish somewhere else....My bro had the Trout, I do believe, or maybe the Market Fish? I forget, but his was better than mines. For dessert we had their take on an apple pie and ice cream. My favorite part of any pie dish is the crust (not the actual fruit) so for me it wasn't that good. The service was nice. We didn't even have a reservation and were taken (the host was charming and led us right upstairs)... but of course it was early, like around 5 or 6 opposed to later. The girl/waitress we got was super nice, so we tipped her very very well. It was definitely very cold in there so bring a sweater, especially if its spring/summer (when they have the AC blasting). The only quirp was that the owner or manager seemed to be walking around checking on most everyone in my area to see how their food and service was, but he seemed to ask everyone except the people of color... random I know, but it just looked like he skipped their tables, I'm sure it wasn't on purpose, perhaps they were too engaged in conversation and he didn't want to be rude... but I did notice that, especially since their were only two black couples in the entire restaurant. Besides that the place was nice, service was amazing, the food was just okay, but I'll probably give them another shot since they're a short walk away. We walked, but there is a parking lot nearby (pretty much across the street, you have to pay to park though). The attire is... \\"nice\\"-- if you know what I mean. Denim is fine, but pair it with loafers and a blazer or a button-up (that goes for male/female).

I was a bit skeptical about having to wait over 4 hours for BBQ because I was 25 weeks pregnant at the time.  However, as some people have stated in their reviews, you should treat a trip to Franklin as a chance to do some fun bonding with people you like or even make new friends while waiting.  Yes, this brisket was truly the best brisket I have ever eaten. We ordered brisket, turkey, ribs, pulled pork, all their sides, and the pies.  If I have the fortunate chance of eating there again, I would seriously only order the brisket, potato salad, cole slaw, and keylime and lemon chess pie.  Yes, their other meat is good, but the brisket was nothing like I have ever tasted before in my life.  Alright. Now for our experience waiting in line. We got in line at 8:45am. There were about 13-15 ladies.  We had one of the girls in the group who lives in Austin bring some camping/lounge chairs.  Luckily, Franklin also provides some chairs and umbrellas to use free of charge (despite probably having seen better days, what can beat free?!) - check under the stairs. We also had a cooler to hold our waters and beers (woo hoo BYOB!).  And lastly, we made a stop to pick up a bunch of breakfast tacos to tide us over until BBQ time.  This is probably the best advice ever. Eat breakfast that has protein to keep you full! And drink lots of water to stay hydrated.  Because of the heat, we decided to walk over to the CVS around the corner to buy some umbrellas.  BEST $25 ever spent.  Kept out UV rays and kept us cool.At around 9:30 or 10am, a Franklin employee (I think his name was Benji) came around to explain the \\"rules/etiquette/procedure\\".  All I remember was we could use their bathroom (hey, I'm pregnant, remember?). They provide plenty of water and there are trash/recycling bins placed intermittently along the line.Then, someone came by to see what we were planning to order so that they can estimate when they would start to run out of stuff.  I like they did this early on so that if you were towards the back of the line, and really wanted brisket, they'd tell you, actually, sorry, that bachelorette party ahead of you ordered 20 lbs of brisket, sooo NO BRISKET FOR YOU! ;) Note that you just have to give a rough idea of how much of each you'd like.Then when they open their doors at 11, be prepared to pack up your campout gear and move down the line.  You can't reserve tables, but it works out so that when people are finished, a table frees up.Bottom line: If you are prepared and like the people you're with, you're gonna love this place!  Friendly and accommodating staff. Great food!

Fox Bros is absolutely, positively worth the hype...because it's not even hype. Fox Bros is the true gospel of BBQ in not only Atlanta, but far and wide beyond the ATL. I moved away from the Fox Bros neighborhood (shed a tear for me) five years ago, but every single business and leisure trip back to ATL brings me to Fox Bros. I have introduced countless friends and colleagues to the magic of this spot, and I can't stop coming back for more.For me, nothing comes close to Fox Bros. Their combination of house-smoked (bot not too smoky) meats, variety of sides, clever menu offerings to distinguish from other BBQ joints, friendly and enthusiastic service, and great value for the money go unmatched in the BBQ world. For starters, you absolutely must begin with either the Tomminator or the Lopez. I mean, come on people, how can you say no to fresh tater tots smothered with either Brunswick stew or chili, and then plenty of cheese?! I also highly recommend the Big Tex rolls, which are essentially a Southwestern-style egg roll, filled with pork and served with a creamy, spicy dipping sauce. All of the appetizers are made for sharing, but you won't want to.I'm devoted to the Combo Plate, which gives you two meats and two sides. Rest assured that all of their \\"meat+\\" plates include two sides, regardless of how many meats you opt for. If you just want to fill up on sides (do it! so fun.), opt for the \\"Veggie Plate,\\" which gives you 4 heaping huge portions of side items of your choice, and isn't just \\"veggie,\\" as you can still get the Chili Mac, Fox-a-Roni, etc., all of which contain meat. Be awesome and choose the Combo Plate, and if they have their two amazing meat specials - the Smoked Turkey and the Jalapeno Cheddar Sausage, do that. If not, do the pulled pork and chopped brisket. Then, douse as you please with house-made sauces, from mild to slightly wild, plus the requisite spicy pepper vinegar or Frank's Red Hot. If you opt for the Smoked Turkey, you'll be rewarded with a special mayo-based tangy white sauce, which is off the hook. Frankly, however, their meats are all SO GOOD and juicy and flavorful that you really don't even need the sauce.For sides, I recommend going for the Cornbread Dressing if they have it on special, if not, the Fox-a-Roni or the Frito Pie are must-haves. The mac-and-cheese ain't too special, but you're going to douse it with hot sauce like I do anyway. The Spicy Stewed Green Beans are alright, as is the not-mayonnaisey-but-more-vinegary potato salad.This is a VERY special local's favorite in a cool, quaint neighborhood, within shouting distance of Little Five Points, Candler Park, Edgewood, and Inman Park. Parking is absolutely heinous, and they don't accept reservations or call-ahead, but it is ALL WORTH IT. Costs are very, very reasonable ($11-$20 for huge-ass entree plates), atmosphere is fun, restrooms are clean, and food/service are top-notch."},{"name":"Sushi Oyama","address":"5152 Kingsway","city":"Burnaby","stars":"3.5","text":"So glad we came here tonight for dinner!

The sashimi was very fresh and they brought plenty of wasabi and ginger as soon as we asked. I also really enjoyed the White Dragon Roll, which isn't on their online menu.

Our server, Joe, whom we found out later has been there six years, was great. He was very attentive and made some recommendations of entrees. We had the mussels in the lemon butter sauce as an appetizer. Delicious!  (A must try if you like mussels.) Our entrees, the lasagna and the chicken piccata, were equally as delicious. At one point, Bonnie came by and brought us more of the garlic rolls. (Yum!) She also showed us another entree to try the next time as she took it to the couple near us. The atmosphere was energetic. Very \\"mom & pop\\" Italian. It put us in the mind frame of being in NYC at one of our favorite restaurants in Little Italy. \\nMy entree was so filling and plentiful, I didn't eat it all. That was just fine because that meant I had lunch for the next day! We initially had plans of having dessert, but by the time we finished our entrees, we were stuffed. No room for another bite of anything. Ha ha ha. As we left, we had a chat with Bonnie (that's when we learned she's the owner and that Joe had been with her for six years). She was so pleasant and told us a brief history of the restaurant, now there 32 years!  She also shared when it's \\"really crazy busy\\" and when it's not so busy so we could decide when to come back. We will definitely be returning to \\"dine in\\".

I visited the Sugar Factory in Orlando twice and lets just say they will not fool me a third time.  My first experience was January 15 for a friends Birthday. There were about 15 of us we had two servers, once server was very attentive and  and the other server Cannoli was awful, he was more concerned with dancing and prancing around they restaurant.   Long story short everyone who ordered with him had to wait at least one hour for their food although we ordered at the same time as the other half of the group.  Three of people in our group had to wait an addition 45 minutes for turkey club and chicken sandwich.  When they finally brought the food out it was all wrong, and instead of a chicken sandwich they brought a burger.  It took about 45 minutes to get the goblet drinks which are just huge cups of ice, there is no way possible you are receiving 60 oz of a mixed drink. We asked to speak to a manager several times and he never sent one over.  When who we presumed to be the manager (Amani) came over they walked to the table like we were having the best time of our lives and they never addresses the issue.  So to accommodate us they gave us the huge King Kong Sundae, yet again no one every came over to address any of the issues we were having and not once did our waiter take an ownership of anything he kept blaming the kitchen staff and everyone else.  Honestly I think he was the issue. He tried to charge us for a drink we never reiceved and then once we told him we never got he had another waiter come over with the same check.   The food was OK and the prices were fair for what I ordered.  These words do not describe how awful the experience was.   Now, lets fast forward to January 30th, I should have known not to go back.  I started out making my reservations two weeks ahead of time because I had a large party.  Beware if you have a party with 12 or more they will try to force get a special menu where you party can only select a few items from each category of food. Or they will try to get you to pay a flat fee and have a family style dinner the most expensive package is $75 per person the cheapest is $34 per person drinks not included  Well in the mist of making my reservations Rachel the event person was fired and my reservation was given away. They then told me if you could be there at 6:30 although I wanted a 7:00 reservation they would serve us.  Well we got there a little late, and the staff was very rude.  Amani complained because the manager tried to accommodate us, she did this within earshot of our group saying they had another party coming in at 9 and they needed the tables. If I am spending my money you cant force me to leave by 9 anyways.  The bartender took the birthday sundae from in front of my bf and gave it to someone else sitting at the bar and even after the waitress told him the sundae was for him he questioned him about it, telling him he didn't order that and that it belonged to someone else, of course he didn't order it its his birthday.  They brought him a new one and he came over again like he was going to take that one also. IF YOU HAVE A LARGE GROUP OF PEOPLE THIS IS NOT THE PLACE TO GO.  It maybe a better experience for smaller groups like 2-6 people.  The main manager is very understanding and accommodating but the rest of management is rude..."},{"name":"Pirates Dinner Adventure","address":"6400 Carrier Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"I went with a group of 5 people (3 adults and 2 kids). We went during a promotional offer and paid $25/Person. I would go again but only at a promotional price its not really worth it to me to go @ full price. Prior to opening the doors to the theatre-like room you are in a standing room waiting. They do have servers walking around with appetizers but when there are 100+ people in a room your lucky to get one. They have a bar and depending on which drink you get you can keep the glass cup as a souvenir (I love my cup). They have a section were you can buy souvenirs like pirate flags, light up swords and much more pirate themed items, all reasonably priced. We purchased a sword and light up pirate hook for our son during the online ordering process which worked out great because they ended up selling out of them. The show itself was pretty good. They interacted often with the audience. We enjoyed the meal. The waitress said that the chicken they gave her was small so she gave us each 2 pieces that were actually pretty big and filling.

Concept is made for me burgers and beer.  Problem is I am a guy that knows a lot about both.  I ordered the mustang Sally with Havarti instead of Brie.  I wasn't asked what temp I wanted.  Didn't really bother me because I figured a burger joint would probably just give me a good juicy medium.  I put the tomato onion and condiments on my burger and cut it in half.   I am pretty sure I heard a muffled mooooo when I cut the burger.  Understand that I am a guy they eats his steaks medium rare.   Upon further investigation I realized the prosciutto that was supposed to be on this burger was missing.  They offered a new burger but I decided to opt for the mushroom fries instead.  The fries that came with my burger were saturated with oil and so were the mushroom fries.  They have  some good beers but even that isn't enough to ever come back.  There are plenty of places to get good beer in the area.   I paid for the hamburger that was completely wrong $16.99 most expensive burger I have ever purchased that I couldn't even eat.  I did get a free beer and mushroom fries $10.  There is definitely a curse on old Perkins locations in town.  Those of you that know the Orange Avenue area  know what I'm saying.

Finally she gets her drink and joins us. Luckily, our server made up for the service at the bar. She was friendly and super knowledgeable about the menu. One of my friends is gluten free so when she was unsure about a couple of the menu items, she checked with the chef for us. Although everything was delicious it was awkward eating because nothing came out together and we all ordered our own rolls. We were having to wait a while for everyone to be served. But I guess that's probably just how sushi is since most people generally share. We had to wait a while for our check since the waitress had a large party she was waiting on that came in.

Like another East Coast reviewer suggested, my expectations were modest, at best, with respect to ramen in the Hill Country.  However, suffice it to say that Austin has a real player in the ramen scene, and while some might take issue with the line, it's plenty worth it for the ramen you will find inside (or you can be smart and just show up early for lunch like I did).  I went with a simmered pork bone broth (tonkotsu) mixed with soy (shoyu) and added thick layers of pork belly, eggs marinated in soy sauce, seaweed, fish cake slices, and two \\"bombs\\" (the chili oil and the corn/butter).  The resulting amalgam from these contrasting flavors was a heavy, salty broth which only got better over time as the marinated soy yolk dribbled into the mixture.  Ramen Tastu-Ya's pork belly slices weren't as tender and delicious as perhaps that you could find at DC's Toki Underground, but they weren't too far what you would find at NYC stalwart Ippudo.  Likewise, the chili bomb was pleasantly reminiscent of Hell's Kitchen 5 star ramen joint Totto.  The eggs were a pleasant addition, but Ren's Ramen in tiny Wheaton probably still carries the day for best marinated eggs I have found in a ramen bowl state-side.  The noodles were thin, properly cooked, and added textural bliss to a stellar concoction.  Presentation made for one of the prettiest bowls of ramen I have ever seen.  There are plenty of options at Ramen Tatsu-Ya, and I should note that I didn't even try their signature broth (the Old Skool).  I do wish they carried a few stronger beverage choices, but that is a truly minimal complaint.  This is destination level ramen in the heart of Texas.  If you have time to step away from the BBQ and tacos in Austin, this should probably be very high on your priority list for Austin eats."},{"name":"Fox Bros Bar-B-Q Stand at SunTrust Park","address":"Battery Ave SE, Behind Sections 155 and 156","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"Food Is Great !!!

My first experience was at the north location when my office was up off of Steck.  Unfortunately, it was a place I would forget about when I was thinking of lunch.  Not that it was forgettable experience since I have always enjoyed my taco's here.  Frankly, I think Torchys probably ripped off most of their menu from Tacodeli.  This Lamar location was convenient since I moved my office to be near the UT campus.  I would get my haircut and then pop in to Tacodeli for a couple of taco's to go.  On my last visit I picked up the Mojo Fish Taco and an El Conquistador.  Odd combination in retrospect.  Both were yummy, but next time I think if I decide to pair something with the Mojo Fish Taco, it will probably be with a shrimp taco.  The El Conquistador had a wonderful rich and full Chile Pasilla Sauce.  Obviously there has been great care and time put into that.  The Mojo was  filled with very fresh drum, lightly grilled and matched with the Mojo Garlic Sauce and pico and guac.  Very different flavor consistencies with this pairing.  I like how they have all their sauces individually packaged and you are encouraged to help yourself.  The service was friendly, efficient and quick.  It actually felt like they enjoyed working their.  Maybe I didn't notice, but I would love to be able to purchase some of their salsa's by the jar to stash at home.

Especially the brisket tacos, there was just this perfect hint of some jalepeno and spice on top of the smoke which was great.But both the tacos and the pork had the same issue which is why I say Stubbs didn't meet the high expectations I had - both meats were just a tad dry.

The Braised Pork Shoulder is another good contender. The beans are slow cooked goodness, and not like BBQ Beans, more refined.

She kept the drinks (better this time) coming and made sure we were taken care of.VERY unhappy- The second time I came in with a different group, I tried something else from the menu.  A pasta with spinach and a dijon cream sauce and smoked chicken.  The smoke flavor was very artificial tasting.  And it was COLD.  No joke, cold.  So I brought it to the attention of the waitress, who apologized, took it back to the kitchen, and came back 10 minutes later with the same plate of cold food.  I let her know it was cold but that by then (several more minutes went by before she checked back in), most of my party was finishing their food.  She asked if I wanted them to heat it up more...  for what?  the last time, it came back the exact same.  As we were leaving, the manager(??) mentioned something on our way out the door...  sorry your food wasn't ask expected.  No break on the tab, No offer to replace the entree with something NOT cold...  Just a lame ass apology after our meal was done and paid for.  Its such a shame, because some things here are amazing.

Who would have thought sushi and burgers? But it works for some odd reason. We ordered the yellow fin tuna sashimi appetizer. It was super fresh. I was surprised at how fresh and clean it tasted given that the weather in Orlando was well above 100 degrees when we went here. the filet mignon roll was super delicious. There was fresh raw beef slightly cooked on top that added texture and flavor to the roll. I never had anything like it. It was really good. My main dish was the jalapeno burger. This was the real deal. It was not at spicy as I wished it to be. I eat super spicy so this was really not much for me. Either way, the meat was super tender, and perfectly cooked. The flavors were not so strong where they would over power the burger but worked well with each other. It's a half pound patty so it's not a small burger. At the same time, it was so good that I ate the whole thing with no regrets. It's a very good burger overall, and one of the better burgers that I've had. Overall very impressed with the sushi and the burger. Both choices are excellent. The place does have a full bar. I ordered 2 double Johnny Walker Black's on the rocks while my friend had Jamison on the rocks. The shots were decent sized. It came the way whiskey shold come with a single large ice ball instead of a few ice cubes. The service was decent.

Big mistake.The wait was over 45 minutes about noon on a Sunday for a table for their dim sum service.  We were initially okay with the wait since their other location has about the same wait time.The food doesn't even come close to their other store.  Of the dozen or so dishes we ordered 80% of them were luke warm at best.  That especially doesn't help when the sauces are overly thickened with corn starch so that everything had congealed blobs.  Most things tasted very bland, a good portion of which could have been fixed with just a bit more salt.  This was actually the first time anyone in my family used chili sauce/oil with dim sum.  The rice noodle rolls (cheung fun) seemed as though someone new had made them, they were crumbly and fell apart when you tried to pick them up.  The meat buns which by the Chinese description should have been pan grilled from raw were clearly steamed prior to being briefly thrown on the grill.  The only real highlights of the meal were the egg tarts which must have come fresh from the oven, because they were still still steaming hot when it reached the table and tasted good.  In general the meal was very disappointing.Other small gripes I had with this place include the display case up front for everyone to see looked as though no one had attempted to clean it since it had opened two or three weeks prior.  The sheet they gave you to mark off the dishes that want to order didn't include everything that was pictured in their menu.  My dad who did most of the ordering spent several minutes rereading the tally sheet over trying to find items he wanted.

Prepare to spend a while looking for street parking and definitely do not park in any of the side alleys because those are tow-zones.A mix of different southern BBQ styles, Soulfire does not have a strong regional identity and the result is very generic BBQ.  They have all of the staples of southern BBQ like pulled pork, brisket, and ribs.  The pulled pork is not bad at all, moist, smoky, and flavorful.  The brisket comes out dry.  I have had it a few times and that observation is consistent.  The ribs are not always that meaty and sometimes have too much fat.  They have a tendency to get overcooked as well.  The sides are pretty good at Soulfire.  The mac&cheese balls are as good as people say they are.  Overall, Soulfire is pretty good but nothing stands out from other local BBQ joints.

Tacodeli is full of yuppies-- I usually like the yuppie crowd.... but on the weekends, the line is out of the door, and there are just too many dang yuppies for me to have a relaxing taco experience.  They are usually pretty cool people, but their range rovers take up more than one space in the already crowded parking lot parking lot, they have a tendency to be overly pushy, and a tendency to yak obnoxiously on their iphones in line.3. No dinner-- it is seriously a bummer taco deli is not open for dinner.... I would go for a Tacodeli dinner on the reg, but they close at 3pm daily.4. The parking lot sucks-- I have always managed to find a spot somewhere, but the parking lot is poorly designed, there are not enough spaces for all of the businesses in the area.

The burger was very good, got it with pork belly which was well, pork belly...and it comes with a nice salad. The Pisco Sour #2 was an excellent cocktail, the cayenne really enhances the drink. Also, great beer selection (it is a \\"gastropub\\" after all) and lots of wines by the glass.And then there's the bad (to be fair, nothing was bad, just a little disappointing). The Moreland margarita (self dubbed to become \\"my favorite margarita\\") was ok and probably wouldn't have made the \\"bad\\" list except they told us it would be so good. We started with mussels (which were recommended by a foodie friend) and they were OK, ciabatta that accompanied was good, but the mussels themselves not the best and the broth was just decent too. Grilled asparagus with chimichurri, lacked much if any chimichurri, which is why i ordered it. We also had the penne in pecorino and beet salad...again both were ok, but I won't think about them again.That leaves us with \\"the ugly\\". Again, nothing was ugly, really just some kinks to work out. The decor has really good potential, but it's a bit dark inside (but not a dark pub style place either) and outside needs some separation from the parking lot, it kind of feels thrown together.

The Johnny Cakes (fried dumplings) were a bit bland, but they did a great job of soaking up the gravy/jerk sauce.  The Jerk Chicken Trini Roti tasted very spicy but was a bit heavy on the potatoes and lacking in enough chicken.  They also had a kid's menu for our daughter.  She ordered the fish and chips which came out very crispy, the way she likes it.The waitress was very friendly and personable.  She took the time to explain the menu.  Restaurant was very dim; the tea light candle at our table provided the majority of the light.Will definitely come back the next time I have an urge to singe my taste buds."},{"name":"Alden & Harlow","address":"40 Brattle St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"I visited Alden & Harlow with my husband and a couple of friends during a short trip to Boston. We went for an early Saturday brunch, right at 10:30 when the place opened. I liked that we were able to make a reservation, which is not always possible with popular brunch spots. Made planning our trip much easier. We tossed around a few options before deciding on Alden & Harlow, and we all ended up happy with our choice. The place was lovely and the food and drink were delicious.We were the first customers to arrive, just as the doors were opening, but they were ready and seated us right away, at a great table with a view of the open kitchen through a shelf of classic cookbooks. I loved the feel of the place. It was elegant and charming, with the kind of casual, modern, hip-industrial decor I always fall for in trendy restaurants. My husband pointed out that Alden & Harlow must be one of the places in Harvard Square where students bring their parents, and this seemed about right. It felt upscale but unstuffy, with something to offer for everyone. Service was great. Our waitress was helpful and friendly, and the host stand let me charge my phone, which was about to die.I scanned a few menus when figuring out where to eat our one planned Boston meal, and I'll be honest--I leaned toward this place at least 80% because of the A&H Szechuan Bloody Mary. I love bloody marys and Szechuan peppers, so I had to try this and would've been very disappointed if it tasted like any other bloody mary. It did not. This was a thick, spicy, flavorful bloody mary with the particular hot numbing quality of Szechuan peppercorns. It was a fantastic, eye-opening cocktail, garnished with pickled green beans. It came with a choice of spirits, and I stuck to vodka, which seemed like the right choice. Why take the stage away from that awesome Szechuan bloody mary mix? My husband got the Bee Sting, which was another excellent brunch drink. It came with gin, ginger, honey, lime, and mint--light and refreshing and very well balanced.The food was as good as the drink. We shared most of our food, per our server's suggestion, and this worked out pretty well, as everything on the table tasted wonderful. The kale toasts were gorgeous, with anchovy aioli, fried eggs, Benton's bacon, fried kale, and what must've been some kind of kale pesto spread onto tall, crusty slices of baguette. Tons of flavor here, with particular credit to those thick, gleaming strips of bacon. The classic secret burger, which appears to be an Alden & Harlow signature, was superb. The house ground patty was juicy and substantial, cooked to a nice medium rare, and it came with an undisclosed list of accompaniments that included a parmesan crisp, pickles, and some kind of tangy slaw on a housemade roll. Whatever was in there worked beautifully. The last savory thing we ordered was the croissant toad in the hole. This was less essential than the other two, but still great, with a slow poached egg, Benton's jam, and Stumptown Redeye gravy. The jam was almost too sweet, but it all tasted good in the end. For actual sweet breakfast, I would definitely recommend the croissant pain perdu, or French toast. The texture was spot on, spongey and moist without any mush, and it came with roasted blackberries, vanilla honey custard, and an absolutely sparkling tart lemon curd. Finally, the crumpets with cream and jam were a splendid side, buttery and dense with a nice crumble.I was really impressed with this place and would be inclined to go often if I lived in the area. Between the nice vibe, the Szechuan Bloody Mary, and the wonderful food, I think it's the rare kind of spot that would get me out of the house on a lazy weekend morning. I'm sure dinner is also spectacular, but that'll have to wait until a future visit to Boston. I'll keep Alden & Harlow in mind next time I travel this way."},{"name":"Fox Bros.

BUT then called me back to ask me to taste it again and make sure it really was sour!

Due to our tight schedule we had to ask for boxes as soon as he put the food down (and even then he had mixed up my side dish) so we barely got to try the food while it was hot. Still, it was good, which is why Art Bar gets two stars instead of one.

But at the same time i was on the fence between giving it 3 and 4 stars. I opted for 4 because typically I don't go back to places that I give 3 stars, but I'll be back here - and often. Because the good does outweigh the not so good and the inconsistent. I have been 5 times now, and this review is based on all of those 5 visits.The Good: The food. Oh my god oh my god the food. It is everything that bar food should ever be. I dream about the chicken fingers at night. Also, the crowd is very diverse and entertaining. Typically friendly and mostly wasted, you get some good people watching in while you sit at the bar. The beer list is also pretty good.The Not So Good: They seem to run out of booze pretty often. They've been out of Crown Royal on one of my visits and out of Jack Daniels on two of them. Also, I don't know how they manage to ever run out, since I've never had a mixed drink that I would consider strong. The pours are small and the mixers are plentiful. Obviously their bar manager has some ordering issues. This isn't the end of the world, but if you are drinking mixed drinks I'd opt for a double.The Inconsistent: The service. My first visit I sat at a table and the waiter clearly did not want to be there. That being said he still took good care of us, even though he was not very pleasant. My last 4 visits have all been at the bar and the service is literally either incredible or very subpar, depending on the bartender. There is a guy bartender there on the weekends that always takes really great care of us, but when we end up with the girl (I think her name is Red), it's never a good experience. She has gotten at least one drink order wrong every time we have had her, even when we only order one round from her. I'd be able to get over that, but then she gives us attitude when we correct her. Once she gave my girlfriend Jameson when she ordered Crown, when we told her she said that it wasn't her fault and then VERY defensively asked if we wanted something else. We asked for the Crown drink and she told us that they were out of Crown. Why didn't she just tell us that in the first place?? Later she told us that she assumed that we were underage Ga Tech students and that they had been using fake IDs to get in all night and weren't tipping well. So I guess she assumed that we wouldn't be able to tell the difference between Jameson and Crown. Well I'm not a Ga Tech student (nor underage), I can tell the difference between Crown and Jameson, I tip very well when it is deserved and I take offense that you would make an assumption about me and treat me differently because of it.Ok, end rant. All that being said, this is still a 4 star review and I think they deserve it. The guy bartender is awesome, the food and atmosphere are fantastic and I will be back, frequently.

I've only eaten Top Ramen, which is so overly processed it is probably devoid of nutrition.  So walking in, my expectation was that if people were standing in line to eat ramen, this bowl of noodles was going to knock my socks off.  Indeed, I am in bare feet at this moment, simply recalling the flavorful broth, the silky egg, and delicate chashu.  I do believe this is the first time I've referred to pork belly as \\"delicate\\", but it was tender, melting into the broth, and oh so yummy.  The noodles were amazing strands, and hearty enough to stand up to my slow eating process without turning mushy. Though I can't slurp without splashing my eyes, no matter how leisurely I indulged.I'd heard complaints of overly salty broth, but at my visit the broth was perfectly balanced.  I ordered extra garlic, and first tried my ramen as it was served before pressing cloves into my broth.  It added a punch of flavor, but I was happy I didn't go overboard with the garlic.We arrived at opening for lunch service, and although there was only a few people ahead of us, it is amazing how quickly the line forms. Do yourself a favor and arrive early, or you'll deal with hunger pangs while drinking in the delicious cooking odors.  Also, the restaurant is a little hard to spot, but if you can find the blue awning and black sign, you're there (hint: next to the post office at the end of the shopping strip)."},{"name":"Jake's Famous Crawfish","address":"401 SW 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Our last dinner in Portland!

The chips are light, crispy, hot and truly delicious. Do not hold back -- they are worth it. 2) Margaritas. Huge and fun! And, generously alcoholic. 3) Chicken enchiladas. My go to, juicy shredded chicken, enough cheese to make you forget there is no authentic sauce. 4) Prices. That chicken enchilada meal costs $7! I can forgive a lot of culinary sins for a Harvard Square sit-down meal under $10. 5) Service. I've always had great, friendly service here, even when coming with very large, disorganized groups of semi-obnoxious graduate students. 6) Water. Water (and soda) is served in hilariously large glasses. A nice thing to have when you are downing basket after basket of chips.If you go in to Border Cafe with the right expectations (ie: you are not about to savor an authentic Mexican meal, but you are about to have some tasty food at a fair price in a relaxed setting) you will have a great time."},{"name":"Alden & Harlow","address":"40 Brattle St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"I love this place.

They have 70 different types of tequila that you can get in shots, flights of shots or margaritas. We've had a couple different margaritas, and they've all been fantastic, if just a little pricey (to be expected, you're at Disney, after all). The tapas are reasonably priced and all taste great. Much better than we had expected. So why only 4 stars? First, location. Yes, it's Mexican themed, and so fits inside the Mexican pavilion. But this place needs to be outside of EPCOT. They'd make a killing if they put this place somewhere you didn't have to pay $70 just to get into.Second, size. The first time we went was during the food and wine festival. The tables (which there are not many of) were roped off for a food tasting occurring soon, so you could only order drinks at the bar. The bar is about 10-15 feet long. The bar was full, and the line was out the door. If you want more than one drink, or ordered a tequila flight, you really want to stay there. Of course, that means that everyone else has to wait for someone to leave. The tables were open on our second visit, but there were still people hovering at times waiting for one to open.Third, service. The bartenders are good, and make strong drinks, even if they're not the friendliest or most talkative bunch.  When we went, there was only one waiter - which seems reasonable considering there are only about 7 tables. But he was so slow and inattentive that people were sitting down, waiting and giving up after 10 minutes and just leaving. He would walk by a new customer, drop off food or take an order from another table and completely ignore others. The food and drinks are worth the less than stellar service, I just wish it we could get there without having to go into the park.

My boyfriend got the 22 oz delmonico, he was obsessed and says it's his favorite steak thus far. We also both loved the bread that they had.

This is a very eclectic city and it's a very quirky, eclectic eating spot. My first visit here was less than extraordinary and I figured I'd give it a second shot. Unfortunately, maybe I should've kept my visit at one try. To begin with, the place is very, very, very small. And for a place that has gained in popularity like it has that always poses a problem because there is always at least a 20 minute wait. And for me the taste of the food doesn't justify the wait. No I will give them credit, there are some exciting combinations that they have on their hotdogs that you would never think of in 1 million years. But it has been my experience that a lot of the flavor is gone or lacking from their food. Maybe it's just the softener in me, but the food just has no seasoning. And for me, that's a dealbreaker.

E.g. the Muhammar a la Marocaine is a slow-cooked sweet beef stew with cinnamon and caramelized onions.  And the Moroccan chicken is a delicious raisney tomatoey chicken curry.

Good proportions and kept warm.  My only complaint here is that there were so many tourists on the Sunday I was there. There was a table constantly taking pictures, not just of the food on their own table, but also of what was in the carts. Another table kept asking that each dish be identified of its contents. This made all the carts slow to get to the rest of the other tables, which was really annoying.So if you're looking for decent dim sum and have patience, then this is a place to try."},{"name":"Mi Pizza","address":"6001 W Parmer Ln, Ste 440","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"First time eating Mi Pizza, weather is kinda perfect for staying indoors so we had it delivered.

We told the waitress who promptly alerted a manager who went through all of the meal options available for her on the menu. I know this is part of the job but he was SO courteous and genuine that it really made an impact. Later in the night, the manager asked us if we would be able to move over one table to accommodate a larger party and threw in free appetizers (which were delicious).

The noodles are thing and perfectly al dente. The broth is flavorful without being overly salty. The tonkatsu broth is more buttery and rich than the tonkatsu-shoyu, and with that said, my preference is for the tonkatsu-shoyu broth. I believe the bamboo shoots are pickled, and thick. The egg is cooked with a very runny middle, and they give you a small bowl to remove your egg from the hot broth if you don't want it to continue cooking. I ordered an additional spicy bomb, and adding just a small amount is enough to open up the flavor of the broth to another level. 3-4 people can probably share one one spicy bomb, unless you're trying to make your ramen extra spicy. My friend liked adding extra garlic to hers, which is fresh garlic cloves and a garlic press. The serving portion is a good size, and with the appetizers I had, I was stuffed. The slider was $4 for one slider (my only gripe about the place), but it was pretty fabulous. It's a fried patty, but it isn't too greasy, and is perfectly complemented by the slaw and sweet bun. The potato salad was mashed, and good.The curry in the curry bowl had a perfect flavor. The bowl consisted of just carrots, potatoes, and rice, and was a great side. If this place added pork tonskatu to this dish, I would be in absolute heaven.The gyoza is good, but it's.... pan-fried gyoza. I don't know if I've ever or will ever have an \\"amazing\\" pan fried gyoza, but if you're craving some, please don't hesitate to order it here. They sell an interesting and fun selection of Japanese sodas and snacks, which you can't help but buy because you've been waiting in line for so long. It's worth the wait. We stood in line for about an hour on a Friday night for an early dinner. I like that the restaurant isn't over-packed with tables like other ramen joints, but this means you'll likely be split up if you have a party of more than 3 or 4. It also explains the long wait. Once you order, the food comes out quickly, however. It's quick service, so you queue up in line in order to place your order at the register before you have a seat. They then run your food to your table number, and if you want additional drinks, sides, or noodles, you can place that order and pay with your waitress.I plan to be back later this week, because it's THAT GOOD!"},{"name":"Pallookaville Fine Foods","address":"17N Avondale Plz","city":"Avondale Estates","stars":"3.5","text":"Nice funky place with friendly young hipster staff.

Good beers and food, with the specials sometimes being great.  The drink specials sound interesting, but have always been too sweet or off for my tastes, so I stopped trying.  If I were only reviewing the downstairs, I'd be giving Christopher's 4 or even 5 stars.  My last three visits however have been upstairs (partly because of going with larger groups) and that's what this review reflects.  I've decided it's only worth going if downstairs seating is available.  The ambiance is downright depressing upstairs: no bar, no artwork, no fireplace.  It's just  packed seating, coat racks and shelves storing the baby booster seats.  The service is much worse upstairs, slower and you have to ask to get the full beer menu.  Even then you can't keep it.  The beer specials are printed on plain (legal sized) paper, but the server explained they don't print enough.

Pretty good ticket prices depending on the \\"buzz\\" of the band. Very cool security... they do their jobs but not in an \\"I am an ass\\" way.

I was waiting until the kinks were worked out and the consistency was under control. I am a native Chicagoan, BIG pizza guy and consider like most, that Lou Malnatis is the best deep dish pizza in Chicago. I've also eaten my fair share of Gino's, so I'll take deep dish where I can get it. We went on Saturday 1/16/16 at about 7:30ish....apparently the owners were there and were about to leave, a waitress was wrapping up their pizza and we chatted. I learned that they also own the bar upstairs, several other bars in the area, as well as 4 other Gino locations in Texas. I really hope the owners are reading these reviews to make adjustments. In terms of time, just know.. that it ALWAYS takes an hour for a deep dish pizza so anyone complaining about that...take note. As a suggestion to the owners or manager, to ease people's temperament with the time, put a sign up at the door that say \\"pizza perfection takes an hour\\" or something like that... It should also be in the servers' verbiage when talking to their patrons so expectations are set. Location ... terrible, terrible location. On the weekend they close 6th so yeah it's in the middle of mayhem in the streets. There is a club upstairs with people dancing and the pounding on the ceiling was really annoying. Chicago pizza should be celebrated!! This concept wasn't thought through very well for business owners that have 4 other locations. You AREN'T selling Austin people, YOU should be selling Chicago!!! Deep dish pizza is classy and should be accessible to a family or small intimate groups. The graffiti on the walls is great and it gives character to the restaurant, but unlike the walls, the the level of service and professionalism that a patron should feel when they walk into a Ginos should not be so casual and grungy! Service- absolutely THEE worst. We walked in and were not even greeted ... in fact I had to go find someone to ask what to do. Seriously, that girl that I think was the hostess was unidentifiable, spoke a few words to us and after our brief conversation, I was still unsure whether or not we were gonna find a table. It was pretty steady but wasn't that busy.  They did seem short staffed I think ... or they aren't hiring enough people or they really just don't know what they're doing. I couldn't tell. I actually think they were hoping we would leave. There really isn't a place to wait other than two chairs at the front. We waited and waited and we noticed that there was a table for two open and had been for about 20 mins. I didn't know what was going on. We moved to the bar in hopes that someone just might talk to us and tell us our table was ready ... nope. I finally went over to the guy in a light colored polo shirt, who I think was the manager because he spoke in a east coast accent. I told him we had been waiting a long time and asked him about that table. He says to me and I quote, \\"well, ok go for it then\\". I wanted to slap him. So, he was also our server too (jeez) and in the entire time we were there, he came to our table 3x's, that's it!! Once for the order, to deliver our pizza to us and for the check. That's it. We were in this place for TWO hrs?!?! I had to flag him down for a drink and finally had to go to the bar to get a glass of water for my girlfriend. I watched him too...he wasn't busy, just terrible. Jeez, it takes an hour for a pizza for every table...plenty of time to visit tables. I can tell there are ZERO systems and infrastructure in this restaurant. LOTS of work needs to be done. If that was the manager, I'd promote him to CUSTOMER in a Chicago minute. Food - decent. We ordered a caprese salad as an appetizer and split it. It was petty good and the presentation was really nice. Now, like I said earlier, I'll take some Chicago DD wherever I can get it. We ordered a medium crumble sausage, mushroom and onion. The crust has little flavor as always. They really should offer butter crust like at Lou's, it's the best. The sauce seemed to be missing something too, like oregano or garlic. It had very little flavor. The onions were pretty much raw. I can tell from all the reviews that there is some training need in the kitchen ... bad. I'm not sure if I will return; it's expensive and not that great. I'm undecided on whether I will recommend this place to anybody, even my kids.  Maybe I will, but Im afraid of more disappointment. This place has little going for it my friend. It was a big disappointment. The only bright spot, were the drinks, which were solid. There are a lot of people that have moved to Austin from Chicago. Illinois is the 3rd most popular state people have moved from. You've got to get it right people and this isn't right!! They should close this place, do something else with the down stairs and move it to the east side or maybe West 6th or even 4th or 5th. I gave it 2 stars and frankly I was being generous. I really want it to be great and give it 5 stars."},{"name":"Dead Lizard Brewing Company","address":"4507 SW 36th St, Ste C","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Light open space with incredible choices for craft beers.

Last time, I talked about the brisket and the fried okra and the mac and cheese. This time, my dinner buddies and I decided to try something new. We ordered the fried chicken (which comes with mashed potatoes), one screen door plate with fried catfish, gumbo, and a vegetable plate, one screen door plate with three vegetable plates, and sides of low country shrimp and grits and collard greens. Let me explain this \\"screen door plate\\" business really quick: this entree option lets you choose three \\"sides\\" or anything off the local/organic list (a daily list of vegetable-based dishes) as a combo. I'm not usually into sides, but the sides here are bomb and it was 100% the right decision.The fried chicken here doesn't need more love than it already gets on this yelp page, but I will just emphasize that it is heavenly. Probably the best fried chicken I've ever had. I don't actually usually go for fried chicken if there are other things on the menu, but my friends and I shared everything and after I tried some of the chicken my eyes just got real wide and I made some obscene noises.The fried catfish is also top notch, and comes with a tasty remoulade to dip it in. The gumbo is FREAKING GREAT, the shrimp and grits are ridiculously good and rich (definitely a \\"cheat day\\" treat, if you will), and the vegetable plates...They are so fresh and delicious and such a great addition to an otherwise rich and heavy meal. I am so glad we got the local/organic plates, because a) they were delicious, really good use of local vegetables in inventive ways and b) they really help to balance out the meal so you don't feel like one large butterball afterward. About the waits: get here about 20 minutes before they open for dinner service and you won't have to wait 1.5 hours. We got there early on accident and just had to wait for all the people ahead of us in line to get seated. Food took a while, since the kitchen got slammed all at once, but this isn't somewhere you go for a quick meal anyway.

Also the fried chicken don't get me wrong it's amazing but it tasted just like my moms. I need to give her more credit for her cooking now. She could make a killing cuz it cost me $20. I was bummed also cuz I spent all this money and could have went to my moms for free!"},{"name":"Ruby Tuesday","address":"2435 Delk Rd","city":"Marietta","stars":"2.5","text":"I don't like chains, never really have, but I do pop into this place every couple of weeks or so for a quick lunch. The food is good (although they really should find a way to get some green lettuce and not just the core of the head on the salad bar). But the reason I come here is not so much for the food, but for the service I get at the bar. The daytime bartender is a guy name Kevin. If you get him, your visit goes well and your food comes out on time and right. I have noticed that they change wait staff like most folks change underwear (daily). But Kevin is a constant and a superior performer. BTW the chicken tacos at this particular Ruby's are the best I have had in any of their establishments. Overall I can not complain about any of my meals there since I started sitting at the bar."},{"name":"Ramen Tatsu-Ya","address":"8557 Research Blvd, Ste 126","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"If you have ever had real Ramen then you will understand the hype here. Yes it's crowded and there are frequently lines out the door and around the corner but it's well worth the wait..So we ordered the slider as a starter called \\"Munchie Katsu slider\\" which is panko beef patty, Hawaiian roll, katsu sauce--- Absolutely delicious!!! Secondly we also tried the spicy edamame which I've had many times at other restaurants but they did it right just the perfect amount of spice, salt, lime and flavor. I ordered the me-so-hot \\nIncluded: Ramen, pork bone broth, miso blend, goma pork, ajitama, scallion,\\nnapa cabbage, bean sprout, corn. This also had the three blend red pepper paste to make it spicy. It was delicious and of course they do have the real AJITAMA!! \\n(marinated soft boiled egg) I always add an extra one because they are that good. Service is okay they do a good job at staying organized and pleasant even with the rush. Basically you order at the counter once your in, and they assign a table to you with a number and the server will bring out the food. Kind of sucks to have this type of set up because you do feel the people behind you breathing down your neck and the bar is in this assembly line so you have to order your drinks and everything there. Then carry your water cup and other beverages through the mass crowd to the table. You get your own water refills yet have they have Apple Pay, and it requests a  tip there or at the table? All the servers do is run the food and assign tables. It's very dark in the restaurant and I would not suggest going with big groups because you'll likely have to wait even longer. The prices are higher than usual at about $11-13 a bowl."},{"name":"The Squealing Pig","address":"134 Smith St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I've been eating their fish & chips with a Guiness since 2002.

Chocolate cake was not a high cake, and was a very thin slice, the large size cannoli were what I would think to be the mini size (I'm Italian...my geandmother and mother made these...the ones from this restaurant are roughly 1/3 the size of a regular size cannoli...so large size should be marked as small.  They WERE however, delicious.The bread pudding was listed as 'with chocolate',..I wonder where the chocolate went because it was NOT on the bread pudding.  They forgot to give me the vanilla bean ice cream that I was told would be in a container with a lid.  The bread pudding itself was ok - not in chunks like this dessert should be..just kind of a soft piece of thick crustless bread...spices were good.I also ordered the fried ravioli and fried mozarella.  The ravioli were way over done...couldn't even cut through them.  Tried biting off a piece, but it was too hard/tough to sink my teeth into.  The mozarella was 'ok'.  Wouldn't reccommend these 2 appetizers.In summary, meals were good, desserts 'ok' & small sized portions for the price (missing the white chocolate and ice cream in my,order of bread pudding), appetizers also a small portion size and ok flavor wise...not sure about ravioli as theywere not edible.The only reason I rated this a 4 (would have been 3.5 but no way to rate that) was due to the problems with the appetizes/desserts.

However, it doesn't seem to get the buzz it deserves when the annual lists of Portland's best restaurants makes the rounds. Let me get this out of the way early - the food is awesome here. The dishes are creative, diverse, and carefully crafted, relying on regional ingredients. The menu adjusts to make sure you're eating what's good, when it's good, where it's good. There's always plenty to choose from for each meal of the day though with delicious entrees, soups, small plate bites, and wonderful desserts. I also appreciate that the portions are sensible, just enough to enjoy and reach satisfaction - perfect each time. Here's one of the most surprising things about a restaurant of this quality though - IT'S REALLY INEXPENSIVE! You can get a great lunch entree (not just a sandwich) in the $10 range and they have two food \\"happy hours\\" (later afternoon and evening) that offer an excellent small plates menu for $2-4 per item. I don't know of many restaurants in PDX that offer as much bang for the buck as Seasons & Regions...no wonder the senior set is well acquainted with this spot - they're savvy! Some other misc. tidbits about Seasons & Regions:-You'll find a surprisingly well-done cocktail menu here and a nice selection of wine and liquor, along with several solid beer choices. The intimate bar seats 6-8 people and seems like a great place to come by and enjoy a drink and meal solo or with a friend. -The building itself is kind of funny. It was clearly some sort of fast food-ish place once, long ago as you can still see the drive up window on the exterior, BUT the interior dining space is cozy and enjoyable. It also has a covered, heated, all-season patio that is spacious and airy, and a real treat on a clear day when the sides of the tenting are rolled up. -They have a somewhat odd collection of novelty salt & pepper shakers on most of the tables that remind you of something your grandmother would have. It takes away from the restaurant's fine dining aura, but gives it a little boost in character for sure."},{"name":"Isla","address":"208 W 4th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Man, this one was tough to review...Food: Wowsa!!!\\nService: ummmmmm....We walked in and was greeted by the coolest dude ever.

I'm convinced that this company that makes it look like a bunch of guys who had a fun concept got together to make a restaurant... is actually not locally owned, was created in a board room, and is owned by some big conglomerate. Can't remember which one. My source...an ex-employee. I poked around on the web and on their website. No mention of owners... anywhere. No mention of being locally owned.

My feeble attempt is this, just try Fox brothers! Read the other Yelp reviews search Atlanta's best BBQ and then just go. Fox brothers is something special. I always get the Fox brothers burger to me it's the best thing on the menu... ok maybe the Lopez or the pulled pork... hell everything is the best thing on the menu.I think what sets Fox brothers apart is the quality of the barbecue and the willingness to create a comfort delicious barbecue experience. Who else would have came up with tater tots covered in brisket chili and some smothered in cheese.Speaking of the brisket chili, Holy chili!! This stuff is soooo delicious. Its like that award winning chili cook off stuff you see on TV or at a fair but everybody can have some of it. Anyways, take a look at the reviews almost everybody gives this place 5 or 4 stars it's worth it make sure you're ready to wait in line if you don't arrive at a perfect time and hopefully you can find a parking spot. The limited parking and the hassle of parking would be the only reason why I would ever give this place four stars but they are getting 5 stars this time since they added more parking in the front.

Anyway, on a Saturday night, regular dinner hours this place is packed. The decors are bare minimal, Chinese run AYCE scheme. And upon that there are 3 types of AYCE with each step in price more pricey items. We opt for choice B which included a modest variety of sashimi. Everything is decently edible. A couple dishes did look like I could of gotten sick from but trusted that due to the sheer popularity of the venue, food doesn't sit long. Next day, I was fine.. The cold soba was a fav for one person in our party, however it really lacked flavour and texture, being served pre-sauced. Some sushi fell apart (rice likely machine rolled), oyster motoyaki came in tiny egg tart tins. Sushi rolls were decently made, as were the cones. Tempura actually was VERY well prepared, especially the shrimp, crispy and hot! Even a la cart many restaurants cannot achieve this level of quality (in Vancouver). Chicken teriyaki, and other hot meat dishes were decently edible as well.  Mango pudding fell short tasting and looking very synthetic, understandably so for $26 prior tips. But oh, the aburi tuna was available and made well! Tea is free.Service was prompt and fairly co-operative. Ridiculous orders like 30x soba for a table of 12 failed us with 3small dishes arriving. Soon corrected with the original request though (note: big plates)!

I ordered a shrimp po-boy by phone and headed over to pick it up. The fellow behind the counter was pleasant and helpful on the phone and in person. There are a few tables in the dining area, with a refrigerated display caseand takeout counter in the back.The food - so far, so-so. Sandwiches come with a choice of hushpuppies or fries. I ordered the hushpuppies, which were a disappointment; too much flour and not enough cornmeal makes for a doughy, chewy pup, not a crispy, corny one. There were some odd vegetables in them, too - corn in one and bell peppers, i think, in the other. I am not opposed to tampering with traditional recipes, especially when it means added nutrition, but this one really just didn't work.The po-boy was okay. The shrimp were crispy and a good size. The bread was fresh (though not exactly the right kind of roll for a po-boy), as were the vegetables on the sandwich.There was lettuce in there, but also...carrots? A bit odd, but not un-tasty; mostly unexpected. The dressing on the po-boy was slightly sweet and a little spicy, and I liked it alright. The whole thing seemed maybe a little bit like a cross between a po-boy and a banh-mi, which to me is not a bad combination. I think this one could be better though. I'll try this place again, because I love seafood and there is a dearth of good lunch places near my office. The menu is pretty diverse, with salads, gumbo, etouffee, dirty rice, and  various seafood (including crab cakes, crab legs, crawfish, shrimp, oysters, catfish, etc.) I am not convinced that it's a hit, but it was decent enough that I'll probably give it another go someday."},{"name":"Franklin Barbecue","address":"900 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Great Barbecue!!

I ordered a trio dip to start also which we got regular blanco queso, the diablo queso (jalape√±o), and regular guacamole since you get a couple salsas to start. Man I could've just eaten this for dinner. Huge portion to def share with the whole table but I only shared it with one other person. Do note - the spicy queso was not that spicy so I kinda wish I didn't get two quesos. They did keep refilling our chips! Sweet Lucy shell (think cheesy Gordita crunch from Taco Bell but way more upscale) with portabellos. And the goody-goody with Thai chili tofu. I recently became a pescatarian so I loved the options for Vegan/Vegetarian/ and even gluten free on the menu!!To top it off - the prices are great and the service was friendly. I have a thing about keeping waters filled and our waitress not only did that but checked on us often and did not give us a heard time when we split our checks individually.

And they were totally cool with me ordering last minute at 2:57pm for seconds of two more tacos. Service here is super friendly--dedicated to their food food-trailer friendly--but it's indoors, which lets them have a real kitchen to work their culinary genius.Anything you get will be made fresh and validates your life and reason for having taste buds. Spicy and complex, the flavors show up like your best friends: you can count on them for humor, comfort, and even being honest with you. And you want to spent more time with them: I usually order 3 tacos, and then I'm still hungry for 2 more. Most places that would be a negative for small portions, but the quality of the portions are so high that it's like the food is good you crave more of it.My favorites are the Cowboy Taco (steak with avocado and southwestern magic) and the Guacasabi (tuna and avocado, available only on Friday).

On taste, I would say it's a 3.5, value about a 2 stars.Drink was decent size (maybe 20 ounces or more) fountain style for $1.95.  Total came to $10.65 which I thought was a bit much for what I got, but they have to pay rent, staff, etc.  The location is great-close to the AMC theater/shopping-so they will prob. be around just because of that but like others have said, this is basically a half step up from subway.  There is virtually no space here.  I think a few tables and that's it.  I was actually put off by eating there-if it's busy you can't even relax to enjoy yourself.  The staff was good enough, the girl at counter was taking up one of the tables eating her lunch but got up right away and I saw her do this a few times (3pm on a Weds).Overall I would eat here again and try and get a larger sandwich if really hungry, but for $11 I want more and will try and plan accordingly.

The sandwich may have been the best sandwich I've ever had. Normally, I think BBQ needs sauce, but while Franklin has 3 very nice sauces on each table the meat is really better without it!

Clearly a bit shady, but if you're truly doing nothing but scamming people, why do you care if you have a picture of the receipt? Anyways, legitimacy aside, we were brought what we ordered, though it was definitely not representative of the pictures on their flier. The food was pretty damn terrible, frankly. Pizza was no better than little Caesars or dominos. And that was the best part of the meal. The cheese sticks had virtually no breading and their marinara was just bad. We ordered 10 wings and only received 9. They were rubbery and looked nothing like the picture. They were drowning in oily sauce. And the ranch we were supposed to get with them was nowhere to be seen. Hopefully our tragedy will help others to make better choices.

I am not a huge fan of the other location, especially the drinks and the customer service, therefore, was gun shy coming into this one. This wasn't the best experience drink wise, however, it is a step up from the other location. There is lots of seating inside and it is quiet to do work. I had the London Fog with almond milk. I know that almond milk is hard to froth, however, other places manage to get some cloud works. This was flat. As for the customer service....it wasn't cold but it wasn't warm either, just like the London Fog that I received. So why the 3?

They have never let me down, it's my fail safe. I've tried other meals here, but none has made the impression on me the way those enchiladas have. The melted cheese, shredded beef, pico de gallo, sour cream, guacamole, and a little bit of hot sauce is where it's at. Top that off with a couple of magaritas on the rocks and you're strolling out this place in a wheelbarrow.The service here is slightly above average for a place that is usually pretty busy. They get your food out quickly. Usually I've had people checking on my meal before I even get my first bite down. But whatever, it's always a good meal. The price here is reasonable too. I can remember the last time dinner for two has cost more than $30.00.

I have a long history with this place and it all revolves around complete ease, laid-backness and efficiency.  Yes, you'll wait forever if you get there after 6 or so.  Yes, it's full of after-work people getting smarmy with each other at the bar and taking too much time at the tables.  And yes, it's got that tex-mex Chi-Chi's/Chili's kind of thing going on, but something makes this place rule a little more.  Let me think about it a bit:The chips and salsa are great and fresh-tasting.  Okay, that's the first thing to get out of the way.  The chips are always hot and salty and sometimes, just every now and then, come a little too hot or fused together in rubbery joints here and there.  Good selections of Mexican beers - Modelo, Sol, XX, etc..,  I can't speak for the tequila drinks.  The waiters/waitresses are usually on a pretty even keel.  Never understaffed and never stress cases.  The hostesses never seem to go nuts despite always having an overflow of people with vibrating buzzers in their pockets waiting for 45 min-60 min. for tables.  The best part about Border -- and this is what baffles me about people calling it a \\"totally generic tex-mex\\" place -- is that half their menu is really Cajun-influenced.  There are a lot of shrimp dishes, jambalayas, swordfish, crawfish and catfish dealies.  I get it that it's all presented in a kind of suburban way, but so what?  It doesn't matter that much to me.  The layout of the place is just off enough -- old menus, wide open rooms, unfinished wooden tables -- that I don't feel like I'm eating at a big chain restaurant.  It's loud, it's festive, it's sort of neighborhood-ish.  I mean, you can say it's not neighborhoodish because aren't lots of old folks and families -  which I'm down with - but this place sort of comfortably reflects the actual neighborhood.  It's full of people who seem comfortable and at home there.  The veggie jambalaya is super good -- huge, big variety, very spicy and really cheap (like, $6).  The tostada salad thing is similar and comes with fat globs of guac, and me fav - the blackened catfish - is sort of a charred, peppery little masterpiece.  Parking is a super pain just like for anything else in Harvard - there is an always-full lot right across the street, but the garage around the corner usually has a few spots."},{"name":"Chance Of Rain Cafe","address":"1522 Se 32nd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"full disclosure, the cafe folk and a buncha regulars are friends of mine, but u cannot frequent this place and not make a few friends, for they are wonderful, damn friendly folk. and more importantly, they have awesome beer.

But they are also very high quality, and honestly very good. I had the bakalani or balakani, whichever that is, and the feta on it was seriously impressive. It wasn't too salty, and was a huge sandwich component -- honestly the sheer vast quantity of feta was a creative component of this sandwich. And miraculously pulled off. The pesto was fresh and delicious, the eggplant well done, the bread appropriate and not distracting. Would I buy it again for $8.50? Yes, depending on the situation.The line is insane. I will say that. But it went pretty quickly. Apparently the line is like this all the time, and I think that must be the source of some of these terrible reviews. But ultimately, all of these people are waiting in line for something they want. So keep that in mind.While my expertise is pretty limited to sandwiches, I did try their cream cheese croissant with blueberries -- buttery and soft, as it should be. Again, recommended. Again, well done.The atmosphere is pretty nice. Very bourgeois, clean and white and the way Americans imagine the French countryside. They have free wifi, which is a huge plus -- but I would imagine that tables are usually too scarce for most people to actually take advantage of it. They have a lovely corner location so their is a lot of nice outdoor seating as well.All in all, four stars.

I was a little confused about how to eat this part of it though. Was I supposed to mix everything together or keep them separate and eat them as I went? I ended up keeping them separate since it was my first time eating ramen and I didn't want to overwhelm myself. I had a taste of the original and didn't like it too much. I think the creaminess took away from the saltiness that I felt should have been there.One thing that I didn't like was that you do feel a little rushed when eating because you want to be considerate to the customers that are waiting outside.

They could seat us then, but since it was so early we decided to go to the bar and hang out a bit and decide later about what to do for dinner. The bar turned out to be a great place to watch the crowd, get great service, a view on the mixology, and order small plates as we went along. We had the duck heart, egg and boquerone, japanese yams, secret burger with crisply fried cheese as the faith, and a smoked chocolate bread pudding.

Read a couple positive reviews about this bbq joint, and had to check it out for myself. Now, I'm originally from Georgia, but live in BAMA, as in Alabama. So, I was excited to get back to my home state.  I will say that parking is limited, and because this is the place people go for bbq, you can figure you'll be parking off-site; Heike and I parked in a public parking lot, which cost us $5. It also landed us with a 12 minute walk from where we parked back to the BBQ joint, so I was expecting great food. When we tracked back, I figured we'd be in for a long wait, due the the many folks that where waiting outside to be seated. We walked in and requested first available seating, although we really didn't want to sit outside. We waited at the bar, along with the Crowne and Coke that required sipping. The Crowne and coke and one glass of water ran  $6.50. We were seated quicker than expected, and luck was on our side as we scored inside seating. I had the half rack of ribs with shredded brisket, mac and cheese,  and brisket chili. Heike had the sliced brisket plate with Cole slaw, and collared greens. THIS FOOD WAS SO GOOD I SLAPPED SOMEBODY'S MOMMA TWICE! !!!! My mother wouldn't put up that, besides, she's no longer with us. All jokes aside, the food was flavorful,  well portioned, and the servers are cool. My server was the young lady with the cool tattoos--although she slipped on the water initially for Heike, she was on her game, and made the dining experience memorable. This place gets two thumbs up and a revisit the next time I'm in town. Oh,  the cost of the meals was about $48.00. Really not bad for the quality and quantity of food.

She said it's some of the best seafood in Portland and the expensive prices are a little more manageable in the afternoon. I'm in, I love seafood.The waiter we had was so pleasant the entire time. And funny. And very good at keeping my water glass full. I'm sure I've told you guys this before but just in case, I drink a lot of water and I can definitely see how it would be annoying to wait on me and constantly be refilling my water. I feel dat hurt, bro. But, this guy did a great job and he did it with a smile. Kudos.Side note: When I was visiting my brother in NC he made me this incredible trout dinner. I'm telling you I was simply possessed by this trout. I usually prefer my fish raw and salmon tends to be the only fish I eat cooked but this trout really turned things around for me. Things got so intense with my brother's trout I was eating it right out of the skillet with my hands. Seriously. Point being, I ordered trout at Jake's. Ever since my first sensational trout experience I've been keeping my eye peeled for more. I was ecstatic to get on this.Now before you start swirling vicious rumors, I did like the trout at Jake's. So let's not get ahead of ourselves. It was good. But not standing over the stove eating it with my hands good. I think the main difference was my brother's trout was a steelhead and it seems this was not. I still liked it but I didn't have a euphoric trout moment. sort of sad really.This trout was in a beurre blanc sauce with almonds. There was potatoes and asparagus on the side. The first bite was so disappointing because I wanted steelhead (apparently). But, thankfully, all subsequent bites were very tasty. After I adjusted my fishy expectations this was still very, very tasty. Different but definitely tasty. I really enjoyed the beurre blanc and the subtlety of the almonds matched perfectly with the clean taste of the fish. It's a dish I recommend.Jake's is snazzy. It's sort of big band-ish and classy. I can dig that. I like me a fun joint. I would for sure come back. I'd probably still do it for lunch. Even though I didn't see the check, I know that my fish was like $18 on its own.

We sat down and peered through the menu. This is supposed to be a supper style dinner where everyone can share. I can get down with that. So we started out dinner with the cheeses and jams. The cornbread they bring out is straight fire as well. The jams were so delicious. I ordered the bone in pork chop with the dirty rice and my wife got the NY Strip and mac and cheese. All of these items were fantastic. The pork chop was smoke-y and cooked perfect. The dirty rice and mac and cheese was awesome. The dirty rice definitely had the good bits and pieces of liver, etc in it. The NY strip was good but I didn't think it was as good as the other dishes.

It was Strawberry, Apple, and Kale.  It tasted good but was Chewy (Yuck). A smoothie shouldn't be chewy or feel like you are eating a Kale asteriod field lol... I noticed they are using a Ninja Blender and that explains it all.  They need to invest in a Blendtec or Vitamix blender and the smoothie won't have that chewiness it will be smooth and silky.  The service was good.  The cashier was polite and very patient.  I assume one of the guys that explained the menu to me a little bit was a manager... He was very friendly as well.  The cashier was able to answer a few questions about the menu but she should know the menu like the back of her hand to make the experience seamless and also to give some confidence behind speaking about their selection.

I pulled up and couldn't understand how to park, that was a little confusing and messy. Once I parked in a tiny spot sure to get my door dinged, I walked out and into the terrace area. I started scanning the menu and everything looked really good, I couldn't decide between a wrap, a sandwhich, or a salad (aka their entire menu) I went with a grilled cheese and a half thai salad. While my other half got the Italian sausage sandwhich. Let me do this in the order that I tasted them... THE GRILLED CHEESE:  This was actually the best grilled cheese I've ever had, I think I might even be turned on by the picture I took of this sandwhich. The perfect grill marks, the ooey gooey cheese, the crunchy yet soft and fluffy bread. It was actually the best, like I thought about going back for dinner that same day. The Thai chicken salad: \\nI am not the kind of person that finishes food, especially salads, usually they are kind of a pain in the butt, you know, lettuce gets everywhere, it's messy. I didnt even notice with this salad, I only got a half salad, but before I knew it, it was all gone. The peanut dressing was actually to die for, the lettuce was so crisp and fresh it was absolutely blissful. Now I took a bite or two of the Italian Sausage Sandwhich, It was really good, it wasnt messy at all, there was pesto inside, which is a little out of the ordinary for sausage, but it worked! The bread that was cradeling all the food was so fluffy and perfect. I can't wait to come back to this place and bring  more people.

As you get in, you order and pay for your food at the register before you sit. The price is reasonable for the portion.

The ramen: we all ordered the original, since it's what the place is known for. The noodle was just a tad on the done side for me, the broth was 'clean', no MSG (a big plus since anyone can make a good broth with MSG!), the chashu was tender and the best part of the meal was the egg.

Tasted like conventional oven cooked ribs.\\nRum baked beans - horrible...Tasted like beans floating in ketchup. I believe that ketchup taste is their bbq sauce which I don't like. I detected no rum or rum flavor in the beans. I told my husband that Wingstop has better baked beans then this place.\\nCole Slaw - meh...mayo based slaw. Slight skunky  flavor. \\nGreens - they were probably the better part of the meal. The only off putting thing is that they are sweet. I know sugar is often added to collard greens when they are cooking to help them tender up and cook down faster.

We'll just leave it at that...milestone...not a number!With reservations for 5:30 on a Friday evening, we entered a restaurant with a bar that was already bustling with end-of-the-week revelers.  We were escorted through the bar area into the dining room and seated at a table that looked out onto the fountains of Bicentennial Park.  Alas, blinds had been pulled on the windows to keep the blinding late afternoon sun out of diners' eyes.Studying the menu, I was struck by the Soup of Yesterday with the claim that \\"it's always better the next day.\\"  That day's selection was a Reuben soup containing...well, Reuben ingredients such as sauerkraut and rye croutons.  Instead, we both opted for the 229 House Salad ($5.95) which was a nice portion of mixed greens topped with orange segments, golden raisins, and goat cheese.  The toasted almonds and sourdough croutons provided a nice crunchy texture and the salad was dressed with an understated mimosa vinaigrette.\\n \\nFor an entr√©e, Lori selected the Great Lakes Walleye ($21.95) which was accompanied with what looked liked a very tasty roasted corn polenta.  She assured me that it was, in fact, very good!\\n \\nI chose the Grilled Barrel Cut Sirloin ($22.95) which was a thick center cut steak topped with Gorgonzola butter and accompanied by a three potato hash, al dente skillet green beans, and a whiskey steak sauce.  Whereas I ordered the steak to be prepared medium, it was just ever so slightly overcooked, but retained its flavor nicely.\\n \\nNever one to deny at least a peek at the dessert menu, I was glad to learn that there was an addition to that evening's offerings.  I'm sure the banana pudding, lemon tart, and panna cotta were good, but they just didn't tempt my taste buds.  We also learned that the slice of chocolate cake was big enough to serve four people and came with a \\"small jug of milk!\\"Fortunately, a pumpkin cheesecake ($6.50) was available and, whereas we typically might share a dessert, we each opted for our own slice of this sweet course.  A healthy (size-wise!) portion, the cheesecake was very good and served with a caramel sauce and caramelized pecans, proving to be a nice autumnal ending to the meal!\\n \\nMichael was a very attentive server who earned his 20% gratuity.  The $5 valet parking was very convenient and operated by polite and gracious attendants.Milestone 229 is a good reason to stay or venture downtown for a delicious meal in a relaxing setting with a nice view (in the absence of blinding sunlight) where casual or business attire co-mingles comfortably.Read more of my reviews at http://eat-my-words-blog.blogspot.com/."},{"name":"Cart Lab","address":"1831 SW River Dr","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Dope concept.

When I got there the manager looked at me and told me my reservation was past 2 hours (really??). Then I was told I could not stay on the lounge area (which was empty) because they had another event in 1.5h; we were already seated and being served, so we HAD to move. So, 2 hours after I went to the lounge area to check and there was 1 person there. EMPTY. This is just plain disrespect to customers.\\nOn top of all this our server was the rudest one I've ever seen (no, do not blame in culture; I have several european friends and they are not rude like this server).

It was my first time going there and frankly, the notion of \\"a good first impression\\" obviously did not apply. I walked in with my friends hoping to have a wonderful time celebrating my best friend's birthday. We asked for a table to be seated and the host said, without a single droplet of enthusiasm, \\"45 minutes.\\" Already, we were shocked by his countenance and manner; however, we accepted and decided to wait for our table. Yet, after 45 minutes of waiting patiently, I went to ask the host for our table and he said, \\"It's going to have to be another 10-20 minutes.\\" I was very unhappy with his expression and his lack of care for his customers, but since my friends and I had already waited for this long, we just decided to wait for a few more minutes. But then, after that 10-20 minutes (which felt like hours), I came back to ask him for the table and he said, \\"Sorry, but we can only give you a table at 9:00.\\" Now that may seem normal, but the time was actually 7:00 at the time, which meant he wanted for us to wait ANOTHER TWO HOURS. I could not believe this nonsense! He paid no attention to his customers, and his attitude and manner was highly inappropriate and unprofessional! Olive Garden had already made us wait for 1 hour, and then they decided to make us wait for another 2 hours, without giving us a legitimate forewarning and time estimate. That was ridiculous! I walked out of that restaurant with all of my friends and we were highly upset. And so we decided to go to Panera Bread, and boy, that was a wonderful decision. The service there was great! The people there were extremely nice, the atmosphere was soothing, and the food was delicious! It was perfect in comparison to Olive Garden. I would not recommend this Olive Garden to my friends ever. Horrible service."},{"name":"Soul Fire BBQ","address":"182 Harvard Ave","city":"Allston","stars":"4","text":"Great food, huge portions and they have FRIED DOUGH for dessert!

It is highly recommended that you make a reservation so don't expect to be seated when you walk in. I love the atmosphere that A&H brings: romantic yet casual. I also love when there's an open kitchen setting. But on to the food...We kicked off the night with a plate of complimentary pickled green beans. WAY too sour in my opinion! Not a fan. Then came the broiled Island Creek Oysters, which are my favorite oysters by far. Baked to perfection with a hint of garlic and bacon. However, they went a little too heavy on the sodium. I'm not sure why there are so many reviews on the Kale Salad. It tasted just like.....a kale salad. Nothing special in my opinion.The Chicken Fried Rabbit was the smallest dish that we ordered. Having had rabbit before, I couldn't tell you what I was eating. The meat was also ground up, which wasn't portrayed in the menu.I would say that the Crispy Pork Belly was my second favorite dish. The pork belly itself was melt-in-your-mouth tender. However, the pork skin was a little too well done, too hard to chew.The Woodbury Clams was another dish that I would strongly recommend. The combination of the savory pork broth and sweet clams made it perfect. The 14 oz Sirloin takes the number 1 spot. I couldn't tell you what they put in it, but it was so good!I had been dying to try this place for quite some time now, but boy was I was letdown. A&H has all the right pieces.

I even kicked over a piece of wood accidentally that I assume would later go into making someone a delicious pizza. I like to think I made my mark.Then we got the Belgian waffle, also quite spectacular. It was possibly the prettiest thing I ever done ate, and only slightly less tasty than it was pretty. We went for nutella and strawberries; a very good life choice.Honestly I don't know which is better: their awesome food or their awesome service and space. They serve excellent food and they are very proud of their creations, and like to make sure the experience you are having is the best it can possibly be.

I can get two hot dogs and tater tots (enough to fill me to bursting in the best, most first-world way) for ~$9. The bar always has a great (albeit small) selection of beers on tap, and their mixed drinks are great. I love Punch Out, and the PB&J drink tastes exactly like a liquefied PB&J sammich. The only negative thing about DF is the size of the building, but it's definitely not even close to enough to reduce the star rating.

I have seen some amazing shows here, but the older I get, the more I hate the crowds here.  The last show I saw here was Robert Earl Keen on March 31st, and unfortunately it was not good but not due to Robert.  Maybe I'm getting too old for Stubb's, since the crowds, lines at the beer stands, and lines for the bathrooms were more than I could stand.  There were way too many college kids talking loudly all through the show, so much that I couldn't hear the music!   Second, the shows that they're booking aren't really my taste.  Being an Americana fan, the only shows this year that appealed to me were Robert Earl Keen and Lucinda Williams.  Oh, and I would have loved to have seen Patty Griffin but it was sold out.In summary, the atmosphere of the outdoor theater is awesome and some shows I have seen there have been enjoyable--mostly because the crowds were thinner and it was more laid-back.  Avoid the shows that the college crowd goes to unless you like drunk, obnoxious, loud and unapologetic college kids spilling beer on you and talking over the show."},{"name":"Medusa restaurant & lounge","address":"3375 Buford Hwy NE, Ste 1170","city":"Atlanta","stars":"2.5","text":"So my friends and I came in here .... bought drinks and hookah and all that jazz in our little section and then got kicked out for a smaller group cuz they bought bottles... wasn't subtle nothing .. dude just came\\nIn like \\"yo ladies you gotta get up\\" n waving us out the way like we ain't paid for everything on this table... for a smaller group that were buying a bottle or two they took our hookah away that we didn't even finish to accommodate the other group ...  fuckin business I guess, I liked coming here but wow quite some service,..

The food and drinks were fantastic! I had the voodoo on the bayou cocktail which was excellent- served in a festive Tiki glass. It had a great pineapple flavor, but it was not overly sweet. For main course, we opted for four of the tapas style plates. The real standout here was the Gouda Mac and Cheese with Cheetos. Absolutely amazing! The Cheetos give the dish a nice spicy flavor and the cheese was so smooth and creamy. There were also small, tasty pieces of sausage mixed in. This was the highlight of the tapas, IMO. We also enjoyed the sliders. These were nice and meaty and substantially sized for a tapas portion. The boudin croquettes were tasty, but the portion size was rather small with just three small balls and a little tiny side of greens. The shrimp and grits was tasty and a much larger portion. The portion also included some grilled toast. For dessert, we had the beignets which were amazing- a bit different from the ones I had last year at Cafe du Monde in NOLA, but so delicious nonetheless. They were a bit heavier than Cafe du Monde, but they were fresh out of the fryer and served with a delicious cinnamon infused marsacpone. Even just eating the marsacpone with some of the powered sugar was awesome! My only complaint was that we were seated in the French Quarter area near a very large group that was rather loud, but that's not really the fault of the restaurant! The only other thing I found displeasing was that the people busing the tables in our area were WAY TOO EAGER  to clear our plates. I had to literally hold on to a couple plates to keep them from grabbing them. Our waitress was extremely good, and attentive without being obsessive, but these people busing were fierce. I was just wanted to be like, CHILL, it's okay if the plate sits for a few minutes. Overall, can't wait to come back here.

Cantina","address":"180 Walker St SW, Ste B","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"A Mexican cantina restaurant that separates itself from the rest by offering an atmosphere that is anything but ordinary.  The only negative aspect that I could find about No Mas is their normal business hours.  On the weekends they only stay open until 11:00, but I cannot blame them considering the Castleberry Hills area can around this time of the night.I was not able to actually walk around the showroom part of the Cantina, located in the front of the building, because it closes around 9pm; however I was able to view it from the large windows that looked out onto the streets of Castleberry Hills.  The showroom portion of the business contains a small bar which where customers can grab a drink to carry with them while they browse through the large and diverse collection of decor and furniture, all of which appeared to be for sale.  The entire furniture and decor collection at No Mas contained many unique items that an individual would be hard to find anywhere else in the United States. It included items like a large statue that seemed to have been inspired by the Aztec Indian culture, as well as an elegant giant dark brown wooden dining room table that looked like it belonged in the dining room at Bruce Wayne's mansion.  Aside from the Spanish inspired showroom, I should also mention that there is also a wonderful restaurant in the same building.  The back porch area of the restaurant faces the parking lot and provides a view of a portion of the downtown Atlanta city skyline.\\nThe interior of the restaurant is beautifully decorated, with a large dining room area upstairs and downstairs.  The bar area, which is also located downstairs, is very long stretching down the wall from the door of the kitchen extending itself almost all the way to the doors of the patio.\\n  \\nI did not have an opportunity to eat any of the food at No Mas, but my buddy who lives in the area told me that it was delicious, so I am looking forward to going back and giving it a try.No Mas is a one of the most wonderful and unique restaurants that I have ever been to.

When I first heard about Ariana, I realized the last time I had been to an Afghani restaurant was years ago when I used to live in Boston, a place called The Helmand. I distinctly remember a dish of pumpkin & yogurt that blew my mind. I recalled that memory and necessarily had to pay Ariana a visit. From the heart of Atlanta, your best bet is to take 400 North, take the exit towards 285 West, take Exit 25 onto Roswell Road, take a right, and Ariana Afghan will be the peach-colored building immediately to the right. (Your best bet exiting after eating at Ariana is to circle around Carpenter Dr NE, which will circle back towards a light, where you can take a left back towards the highway.) There is a lot of natural lighting, which quickly enhances the cleanliness and the well-set tables. We were greeted promptly, we were the first guests for the day, and we were allowed to have our choice of table.  \\n \\nAs our experience with Afghani cuisine was limited, our waiter was kind enough to walk us through the entire (lengthy) menu. He listed personal favorites and why they were his personal favorites. A little bit of guided navigation was welcomed. We were offered a sour, mildly bitter yogurt beverage to start. And it was delicious. Shortly thereafter, we were brought fresh naan. We started with vegetable sambusay, which were compact, smaller than empanadas but larger than Ethiopian sambusa, with a yogurt based sauce on top. Hot, juicy, and tasty. My eyes spotted a pumpkin & yogurt dish, which I excitedly ordered and consumed, with the naan as a vehicle. It was every bit as good as I remember from years ago. Perhaps better. And so simple. I can think of no better pumpkin dish I've eaten. The entrees were equally fantastic. The chapli kabob were two pieces of skirt steak seasoned with Afghani spices and topped with sauteed vegetables. Savory. Excellent. The lamb kabob was the regional variant of Middle Eastern kabobs. The problem I've had with many kabobs in the city of Atlanta - Greek or Persian particularly - is they end up being overcooked, dry, and chewy. Not here. The lamb kabob was tender through and through, wonderfully spiced, and perfectly counteracted with the yogurt offered as a side. The trick, we were told, is the slow process of cooking the lamb in order to maintain its tenderness. Two kinds of rice accompanied the dishes and paired well. Our waiter checked on us frequently. He wanted to make sure our first experience was a good one. Even another member of the staff, not directly involved in our meal, came by and was excited to hear we were enjoying ourselves. The atmosphere was relaxed. We thoroughly enjoyed the meal. And we showed that by failing to get out of our seats for a good thirty minutes after the last bite. If you love Afghani food, come visit. If you love Middle Eastern food, come visit. If you have never had Middle Eastern or Afghani food, I can't think of a better place to get your feet wet. Ariana is a welcome addition to the Atlanta dining scene."},{"name":"Porter Ale House & Gastropub","address":"3715 S 1st St, Ste A","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Overall good menu and drink options, parking is easy in the garage if you have to drive.

I go to speak to the hostess who apologizes profusely, acknowledges that our wait has been way too long, and grabs the manager. I brace myself because in the past I have been met with managers that have the attitude of  \\"oh you know sorry, but there is not much we can do here, it's the nature of Saturday night beast.\\" Mettle's staff was the antithesis of that. Manger Ben greets me and just like the hostess apologizes, makes me feel heard, and explains that people have been camping out for 2+ hours and that they will do everything possible to make our wait shorter. We are seated shortly there after and are very well taken care of. Manager Ben gives us free appetizers and comes to check on us at least twice. Our waitress was fabulous, knowledgable and funny. The food was great: best quail I have ever had, vegan chicharones to die for, pork ribs were super tasty, and the huckleberry ice cream was sweet, smokey and delicious.

I've had my share of greasy hole in the wall Southern joints and they are honestly all better than the food I've had here. BUT I will still give it 4 stars for its concept of meshing Southern and modern cooking and the very friendly service. When you walk into this place, aside from the music, you'd think you just walked into any other place in Portland. It's wooden tables with candles and classy but casual. We went for dinner and there were already lines out the door at 6:00 pm. We said we'd be ok with the bar so we seated within 5-10 minutes. We both started with bloody marys. Each were garnished with an olive and pickled okra. Delish. Spicy and perfect. We got crawfish cakes for an app. My bf got the fried chicken & I got the screen door plate with fried catfish, green garlic popover, and bacon and hock collard greens. The crawfish cakes pretty much tasted like crab cakes with chunks of crawfish in about every other bite. It was a plate of 2 atop remoulade sauce and piled with a mini slaw/salad. It was good and the perfect example of Southern meets modern.The fried chicken plate looked huge, but undaunting to the piggy bf. We were scared it'd be dry based on the color, but it wasn't. The skin was crispy and the meat was tender. It was set on a mound of mashed potatoes with a side of collard greens. I've had better fried chicken in my life (Honey Kettle's in LA), but it wasn't bad. I'd prefer juicier. The screen door plate was huge too. There were about 5 fingerlings of fried catfish, which was more than I was expecting. It was crispy, but I think the fish may have been a bit underdone because it wasn't flaky at all. The cornmeal crust fell off the fish with eat bite. The remoulade paired well with it, but I was happy I had so many choices of hot sauce to pair with it (crystal, tabasco, and homemade). I've had better cornmeal catfish also in LA (Aunt Kizzy's Back Porch). The cornbread was definitely a Southern version (savory rather than sweet), but was a bit too crumbly and not moist enough. The collard greens just tasted boiled rather than simmered with the ham hock and bacon, which seemed like an afterthought. It didn't have the smokiness or depth of really good greens. The green garlic popover though. Man. That is really good stuff. It was creamy, savory, and fresh tasting. The creamy saucy gravy worked well poured over top. This is the main reason why it still got 4 stars from me.I can tell that they really know their way around a gourmet kitchen (the modern half), but they still need to work on the Southern half. The flavors are just too bland and the recipes too \\"clean\\" for true Southern food. Hole in the walls have got them beat on authentic.On that note, I'd still go back to give their other dishes a try and definitely brunch."},{"name":"Pallookaville Fine Foods","address":"17N Avondale Plz","city":"Avondale Estates","stars":"3.5","text":"Okay, this place really DOES have Fine Food.

When we got there, the place wasn't that full and we were seated immediately.  But it all went downhill quickly.  Our waitress brought over the menus and then didn't come back for a really long time.  When she did, we placed an order for 2 drinks, 1 appetizer, an appetizer to be brought out as an entree and one actual entree.  It wasn't complicated.  Not long after, the bar started to get a little crowded with other revelers and soon enough I noticed that our waitress had never returned and people at the bar and at other tables were getting their food before us.  I flagged down another waitress and asked her to find ours and told her I was pissed off.  Magically, our waitress appears with our appetizer (an Irish pizza - which was delicious) but her snarky attitude was less than appreciated.  When I confronted her about why other people were getting their orders before us, she gave me a lame excuse about how food ordered at the bar comes out first and when I said that people at tables got theirs first too she finally admitted it was \\"the pub's fault.\\"  Of course it had NOTHING to do with her.Less than five minutes later, the rest of our food came out.  I absolutely HATE when this happens.  First of all there's no room on the \\"tables for two\\" for all of those plates and secondly, if I wanted to eat that much food at once, I'd just go to a buffet and skip the shoddy service.  When she brought out the food, she offered a beer on the house which meant nothing to me since I wasn't the one drinking.  When she brought the beer she asked me, \\"Are you still mad at us?\\"  And I told her, honestly, \\"yes\\" and explained that when confronted about the service, she should have stepped up and admitted it was her fault instead of trying to push it off on whether we ordered from the bar or whatever.  Then she changed her story and said it was because when we came in there weren't enough servers.  Huh?  An Irish pub not having enough waitstaff on the day of the friggin' Parade?  I wasn't born yesterday, lass!  She just sucked...had zero customer service skills and a miserable attitude.  Also, I know it was after the parade, but the other patrons sucked too.  I felt more like I was in a bar in NJ with the Journey/Queen/Bon Jovi singalong.  This isn't American Idol and if it was, Simon would've eaten them alive.With all of that said, the food was excellent, but I refuse to give this place more than one star because the service was horrendous and the other patrons were equally obnoxious."},{"name":"Flat Patties","address":"33 Brattle St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"A little heavy on the grease for me, but peanut oil does make almost anything taste delicious.

The rotisserie chicken meal came with mashed potatoes, gravy, and green beans. The chicken was a bit bland. It could've been marinated a bit more and the potatoes had the consistency of instant mashed potatoes from a box. The green beans were crisp and fresh and they were probably the best thing on the plate.The grilled chicken sandwich was also a bit bland and the bacon was overlooked. The good thing is that they have a condiments bar complete with lettuce, tomato, onion, peppers, the works to build your own sandwich. I loaded up on that to add flavor to the sandwich and it was acceptable after that. There is an abundance of seating inside but it was extremely busy that day.

Any other night of the week, they have veggie side options like Japanese style curry and the infamous fried brussel sprouts. Both are deliciously filling. My bf wasn't in the soup mood, (the wait staff had to ask him twice if he's sure he didn't want ramen- its that good!) so he got the beef sliders. Apparently, they are the best sliders he's ever had.

They arrived lukewarm, dehydrated, and grossly over-salted. My GF ordered the Croque Madame. It arrived barely room temperature with raw egg whites, under-cooked bacon and a mysterious sweetness with soggy, yet dry brioche. My friend ordered the breakfast board which was supposed to come with a soft poached egg. The egg was hard boiled and the only charcuterie on the plate was a  very unappetizing pate. Of the 4 plates on the table, 3 were sent back. When we were leaving we heard the table next to us comment that the bacon was \\"practically still moving\\". So it was clearly not just our table.

Since I was flying solo I went on a Friday night. No one told me that they have live Blues, and the place was packed! The seating is family style and everyone was friendly and welcomed me to their table post haste. Now you order and pay at the window. Try to be patient...it's well worth it. They have chicken, pulled pork and pulled chicken sammies, but the star of the show, hands down, are the ribs. Tender and juicy and just tender enough to almost fall off the bone, they have just enough kick to tickle the back of your throat. Get lots of napkins...you'll soon have sauce running down your arm. And don't even THINK about wearing white; fuggetaboutit. Sides are extra with choices of potato salad, cole slaw and baked beans.They're good, but I suggest you save room for the ribs...you can have potato salad anytime.

In my perfect world, Austin would steal a page from Portland and open an international trailer parking lot of food somewhere downtown.  After hearing Hudson's plans to open a trailer, we were quite excited.  We made it down there on Sunday night, their second night open.  We tried a Deluxe Chicken and Avocado Cone and the Beef Sliders.  Fail #1 - Throw in two bottles of water with the above and we had a $20 meal.  Food trailers should be two things, tasty and cheap.  This was not cheap.Fail #2 - Sliders is plural, but what you'll receive for your $6.50 is one slider, a single measly tiny burger.  For that price, you'd be buried in a dozen Krystal's or White Castles.  Sure it was fresh beef and a sesame seed bun, but I've had way better full size burgers for the price.Fail #3 - These are not the Chicken Cones of ACL legend.  This was a small piece of overcooked chicken in a tortilla with a bit of slaw.  Again, for $7, I would expect something of a higher caliber.  If you go in with expectations no higher than a Chicken Snack Wrap from McDonald's, you might be pleased.In conclusion, spend your money elsewhere.

In the past, they have been closed on Sundays, as I recall.So it was that I ventured out for dinner with one of my sons and our dog last night.  Press 101 has a large outdoor seating area and well behaved dogs are welcome.  I wish all eateries were as accommodating.Our waitress was very friendly, and a dog lover, so we very much appreciated the great service that we received before and during our meal.  After taking our order, it did not take very long for our soup to arrive at our table.  My son ordered chicken noodle and I had one of the better squash soups that I have found in Orlando.  The soup was thick without being muddy and seasoned with -- I think -- allspice to balance the sweetness of the butternut squash.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and my son similarly approved of his chicken noodle soup.For our main course, my son ordered the Havana -- essentially a traditional Cuban.  Meat. Bread. Cheese.  It is difficult to go wrong with that equation and my son was pleased with his sandwich, but disappointed that after we had ordered we learned that the baked fries listed on the menu as a sandwich accompaniment are no longer offered.  He received a side Caesar salad that went uneaten.I asked our waitress whether I should order the grilled vegetable sandwich or the blackened mahi.  I had had the vegetable sandwich in the past and found it to be just OK so I took our servers advice and ordered the mahi.  I also ordered a side Caesar salad (from a choice of garden, Caesar and cole slaw).  The salad was average but the Romaine was fresh -- no points lost or gained from it.My sandwich, however, was a bit of a problem.  The bun and the lettuce/tomato/pickle garnish were all fresh and should have boded quite well for my meal.  Unfortunately, the mahi was dry, tasteless and -- in all candor -- unrecognizable as a piece of fish.  Since I was eating a fish sandwich, that was a problem and if I were rating my experience based on my sandwich alone, I would have lobbied for a zero star option.I toyed with giving Press 101 a 2 star review but the quality of the servers and the outstanding soups, coupled with the generally favorable reviews of the Yelp community, prompted me to go with a three star rating.

You'll be in cramped quarters, and if you have a party of four you may need to get a little cozy around a table designed for two. They do a good job at getting you and your party seated as soon as you've ordered, and with big parties they'll try their best to accommodate by splitting you into smaller groups. The wait for your food isn't too long, and it's oh-so-worth it. The broth is intensely flavorful and the noodles have just the right amount of chewiness. When it's really cold outside, it really hits the spot. My favorites are the #1 or the dipping noodles.

The buttermilk fried chicken was super delicious!  I hope the restaurant considers putting this on their regular menu.  We asked the waiter if we can order the buttermilk fried chicken during regular dining and he said it's special only for dine out!!!  The calamari was on the other hand a bit too salty for me.For entrees, we ordered olive oil poached ling cod on wild rice & puffed rice with cauliflower puree coconut curry pickled fennel; and smoked ham hock orecchiette paired with shemiji mushrooms, brussel sprouts, cr√®me fraiche, and pangratatto.  I must say the food in general seem to be on the saltier side for my liking.  We felt the flavors were great but I think a bit too strong on the salt content.  I ended up drinking a lot of water due to this.For desserts, we ordered salted caramel & apple cheesecake and chocolate & orange tres leches cake.  I liked the salted caramel and apply cheesecake best; however I didn't taste too much cheesecake though.  It tasted a lot like apply crumble dessert with crunchy toppings.

Personally, I thought our entire meal was average and what you expect when coming to a busy place like the Citywalk. Service was slow (once again, busy place) but our waiter was kind. Make sure your entire party is together or they will not seat you. My fianc√©'s parents got there early and tried to get a table prior to us arriving, but the hostess would not allow it. Avoid our mistake!Once we were all together, we were seated quickly and ordered the fried pickles. These were piping hot and a good start to the meal. Our party all ordered different things: I got Jen's Fresh Find, my fianc√© got a roll with fried kimchi on top, my fianc√©'s mom got the bento box, and my fianc√©'s dad got a chicken sandwich. We all quite enjoyed the flavors of our entrees, but unfortunately had something wrong with each of the dishes. None of our sushi rolls were tightly wrapped so it fell apart easily. Additionally, the fries for the entrees were cold.  I think it's just the nature of a busy place to get minor things like this wrong, and perhaps, we came at a wrong time. Overall, the meal was fine and we got what we came for."},{"name":"Golden Garden","address":"63 Concord Ave","city":"Belmont","stars":"3.5","text":"Someone needs to help this place translate their menu, because it's woefully inaccurate in english.  The lamb teriyaki is actually Chinese lamb kabobs, and the sour cabbage with chinese bacon is actually sour cabbage with large slices of unsmoked pork belly.Whatever.  The food is good enough.  The dumplings are probably the best in the area.  It's one of those things that I don't care that much about since homemade dumplings (even if the skins are store-bought) are usually about as good as even the best restaurant dumplings, and I'm rarely in short supply of that given my how my relatives love to fatten me up.Shumai here is really special though.  It's not much like the shumai of dimsum as it is made with beef, with a thicker wrapping.  Think beef xiao long bao and that's pretty much it.If you're really looking for Dongbei food, be prepared for an acid-fest because it's all got some vinegar.  Bring some gum for all the raw garlic also.  Cucumber and jellyfish salad is my favorite.  It's raw, garlic included, but refreshing and light. The sour cabbage and pork belly stew and chao rou la pi (pork la pi) are a bit more challenging, but homey and good in their own right.  The la pi is interesting: rice, or maybe potato noodles is mixed with cucumbers, stir fried pork, and a wasabi-like mustard.  Like the sour cabbage dish, it's good in small doses but I wouldn't eat the entire gigantic portion they serve.The most dissappointing thing though is the Cumin Lamb.  Zi ran yang rou is one of my favorite Chinese dishes, and I would love to find a place that makes it well, but I consider myself lucky just spotting it on a menu.  They put hot peppers in, perfect, and carrots?  That just doesn't belong, texturally or flavor wise.  No biggie as you can ask for it without the carrots, but the cut of meat they use gets a bit dry also.  Something more fatty and tendony would be suitable.This is probably the best dongbei restaurant in the area."},{"name":"Ramen Tatsu-Ya","address":"8557 Research Blvd, Ste 126","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"While arriving here on a hot summer's day during the grand opening I would say Ramen Tatsu-ya really understands what \\"catering to your customers\\" means as well as  \\"hospitality\\".

If not for that website, I may never have discovered Bandini, so I owe a big thanks to them!I was craving a hot meal, but with a week of temperatures in the 80's, I was in no mood to cook.I found Bandini online and placed an order for Fettuccini Carbonara with a side of garlic bread and a piece of chocolate cake. (Can you blame me? If you're gonna splurge......)  Also, with each entree, you have a choice of garlic bread or a side salad. I opted for the garlic bread and was  thrilled to find that I received three slices of garlic bread at no extra charge.My order arrived sooner than the 20-30 minutes promised by the website, and I was pleasantly surprised to find my hot dish bagged separately from my cake. BIG points for that! The quality of my Fettuccini was very good. The noodles were cooked until tender but not mushy. The sauce was good and garlicky, and there were plenty of mushrooms, tomatoes, green onions, and bacon pieces sprinkled on top.  I was pleasantly full after only 1/2 portion, so I will have lunch for tomorrow as well. (I would have preferred chicken rather than bacon, but it was a $1.50 upcharge and I decided to try it as presented on the menu before making changes)Now let's talk about cake. Glorious chocolate cake. I expected a frosted piece of cake since it was described as a 3-layer chocolate cake on the menu.  It would be better described as 'chocolate mousse cake', but I'm tellin' ya...WOW. It's decadent and rich, but with a light feel because of the mousse. VERY good!A very fine, thin layer of chocolate crumbs, a thick layer of chocolate mousse, a layer of chocolate cake, followed by a thicker layer of chocolate mousse and a drizzle of chocolate ganache on top. Mmmmm yeah. Dreamy.My cost, including a 10% tip was just over $17. A bit spendy for a one-person-meal, but then, think of it as a treat.I would definitely order pasta and dessert from Bandini again. \\nI hesitate to give 5 stars right out of the gate, so let's see how they do in the future and I may revise my rating.\\nUPDATE:\\nMy next order from Bandinis was for chicken strips, a crispy chicken salad, and a mud pie slice.The chicken strips were covered in a cornmeal-type breading that was grainy and disgusting. The ranch dressing that came with them was kind-of spicy. zI guess it was just pepper, but since I'm very sensitive to spice, I couldn't eat it. What are chicken strips without ranch dressing? Sadly disappointing, I'm afraid. I really wanted to love these chicken strips.My salad was ok. It wasn't anything special. It did have tons of chopped bacon on it, which was surprising.The mud pie was absolutely delicious. Consider that a WIN.THE VERDICT: Stick to pasta and dessert at Bandini's and you won't be disappointed."},{"name":"Red Lobster","address":"4010 West Vine St","city":"Kissimmee","stars":"3","text":"We went for lunch and the place was quiet. There was no dedicated hostess to greet when we arrived. Someone came up after a minute or two and got us a seat.Took a few minutes to have the waitress arrive. We got the biscuits and drinks a few more minutes later. The biscuits seem to have less cheddar and more salt. The biscuits are very salty. The fish and shrimp were average but were pricey even for lunch. Lots of salt on everything. The service was average the food was meh and the bill was high for the low quality and quantity. It will be another 5 years or so before visiting another Red Lobster, if they are still around."},{"name":"Se7en Bites","address":"617 N Primrose Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"An Orlando must! Food is great...Southern style with a twist. Breakfast, brunch or lunch everything is yummy. Treats are delicious and are always changing. Don't forget to take pics with the murals outside."},{"name":"Screen Door","address":"2337 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"First of all the wait is long, second of all the food is not worth the wait. The staff was extraordinary - they took care of us and were very friendly throughout our meal. Unfortunately,  we could not say the same for the food. If you're looking for culinary adventure as we were, you won't find one here. After waiting in line for 45 minutes, we were finally able to sit down. We ordered the eggs Benedict, fried chicken sandwich, and the fried oyster sandwich. We won't really blown away by any of the dishes. In fact we were quite underwhelmed considering The anticipation that have been built up from the long wait in line. Both sandwiches didn't really offer anything extraordinary in flavor and The eggs Benedict turn out to be very heavy."},{"name":"Se7en Bites","address":"617 N Primrose Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Amazing food! I got the compost cookie and my hubby got the salted caramel dark chocolate pecan mini pie which was hands down the best mini pie we've ever had. The compost cookie had caramel, chocolate, butterscotch, chips and pretzels inside it and tasted amazing as well. We got there at 9:00 and there was already a line out the door! Definitely be going back soon! Came back and had the 7th trimester and the 3 little pigs and they were both amazing!"},{"name":"Bandini Pizza & Pasta","address":"3107 N Lombard St","city":"Portland","stars":"3","text":"I ordered some delivery baked spaghetti from this place. They were super speedy and it was still steaming hot. Bonus! They also, randomly, have gyros on the menu. HOWEVER, I order from this place when I'm hungover and craving a fast, cheap meal... I would not recomend this place if you're looking for a sit down, amazing Italian experience. Also, the staff seems to barely be able to speak a lick of English, so be prepared for a little awkward encounter if you don't speak Italian either."},{"name":"Joti Palace","address":"308 Main St","city":"Malden","stars":"3","text":"It pains me to say this, as I want to support businesses in my former hood, but Joti Palace is just not that good.  Seriously.  The chicken and shrimp in the dishes we had (shrimp vindaloo and chicken tikka) were so dry.  The sauces were really good, but the meat and fish itself were not seasoned at all, it seemed.  Even the samosa was kind of bland.  My roommate took me here for dinner the night before I moved, and I had such high hopes.  I suppose if you REALLY want Indian food, it would be ok in a pinch.  Maybe we should have known better when we walked in at 6:30 on a Friday night and there was nobody else in there.  At all.  And not too many calls for takeout.  Oh well.  You live, you learn."},{"name":"La Cubana","address":"3405 SE 82nd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Ropa Vieja was fantastic and so was the Cuban coffee!

We got the crab bisque and the clam chowder. Both were a delight to eat. The mussels were also good. And the Cajun chicken and shrimp fettuccine was very refreshing. A bit on the pricey side. The service was very attentive."},{"name":"Hei La Moon","address":"88 Beach St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"We eat here very often! The food is really good. You can see the food pushed out in carts to see if you like them. Parking is horrible of course. But not they don't make the steamed lotus paste buns!!!!!! Soooo sad!!! I loved them!
