Every time we come to Beaverton from towns that are dim sum deficient, we have to have dim sum for at least one lunch. \\n\\nWe have read complaints that the service is sometimes sullen and rude. We haven't seen that beyond the normal nature of Chinese people. Being an ABC, I guess I am used to it, so I cut them a little slack. BTW, I don't speak Chinese well, so don't assume they are nicer to me than they are to you. \\n\\nWe always have dim sum and find it pretty good, whether it is the more common items like BBQ pork buns (hom bow) or Sui mi to the more esoteric, such as duck or chicken feet. \\n\\nLuckily, dim sum is a Chinese dining style that allows even non Chinese to eat well, without speaking the lingo. You just watch for a cart to roll by your table and point to what you want. Get a few dishes off each cart. For those dishes with covers on them, point and ask to see what is in it. Give them a thumbs up if you want that dish. They will use their shears to divide some of the larger dim sum, so several diners can share that item. It still takes a bit of courage to try something you haven't had before, but believe me, it will be worth it. Better yet, go with someone who knows the dishes and learn. I can volunteer if you give me enough lead time. ;-). You are paying, aren't you?\\n\\nEach dish of dim sum costs a certain amount. Most right now center around $3.50 to $4.00 a dish. A few can be higher. But there are only 3 or so price tiers and you can often guess which dishes are low or high tier. The server will mark on your tally sheet what you had, but you will not know exactly what that dish cost. And the total may be a surprise if you go berserk and really chow down. I just enjoy and let the bill fall where it may. \\n\\nThey are up 7 days a week and start serving from 10 AM. I have never eaten past 2 PM, so can't say how late they serve dim sum before switching to their normal stir-fry menu. My advice is go earlier on weekends, before the  crowds of mostly Asian customers mob the place. But the selection of dim sum is greater near noon. So pick your time judiciously. Usually  there will be enough \\"Gwei Lows\\", to make non Chinese feel comfortable. \\n\\nSince we have dined here so many times, you may wonder why not 5 stars? Well, this is the only real dim sum place out this way and I have had better dim sum elsewhere. If there was a 4.5, I would use it. But a 5 is to me, like putting a bullet thru dead-center at 500 yards or more. So 4 stars it is."},{"name":"Lenny's Hideaway","address":"8 Stagecoach Way","city":"Cohasset","stars":"4","text":"Had high hopes for a new restaurant in this location.

Wish we had. I live in the neighborhood and my friend and I checked it out on a Sunday night. It was pretty dead, with all customers at the bar. The bar is literally split in two that are mirror images, where bartenders can walk to either side, but there are registers and drinks on either side. \\n\\nWe waited about 20 minutes and watched the bartenders pass us many times. We were chatting and catching up, so it wasn't that noticeable to us at first, but definitely there was no welcome when we sat down. After a while, I asked my friend if they were still open because we had been waiting so long. The bartenders walked past us so often, but they did not look over at us or make eye contact, like they wanted us to leave. When people ignore you, they are usually telling you that they don't want to interact with you. \\n\\nOur catch up session ended and we started watching the two bartenders, trying to make eye contact. It's a small place with very few people there, so it probably was more effort for them to ignore us than to just get us some beers. The bar was all old white guys, mixed with some younger white guys. One of the bartenders, actively ignoring us, signed a guy at the bar's cast, which reminded me of grade school.\\n\\nWe finally got drinks, but I was STEAMING mad. If I was not with my friend, I would have said something, but I didn't. At that time. Later, I notice that there is a guy next to me with take out. He has his take out and his credit card out. He looks sad. I ask him, \\"Are they ignoring you?\\"\\n\\nHe says that he has been there for 10 minutes, the bartenders are walking around him, having conversations with others in front of his face, ignoring him, and he's still there.\\n\\nI tell him he should just leave and the service is ridiculous. I'll vouch for the guy. He's been there so long at this point, I think one could arguable reason that they just forgot if they paid or not.\\n\\nThe bartender comes around again, and the take out guy, (a big gorgeous African American man who had no ring single Atlanta ladies btw) asks if he can pay. The bartender says, \\"What makes you think that you can't pay?\\"\\n\\nWOW\\n\\nThey start yelling at each other now, like parent and child. It was both fantastic and awful at the same time. The bartender tells the customer that there are 40 people at the bar he has to take care of (this is not true, there were like 10 and he wasn't taking care of anyone, just seemingly tweaking running around and talking but doing nothing). Then the bartender says he isn't even on the clock, like he's doing this guy a favor\\n\\nBeautiful customer points out that no one is at the bar anymore. \\"The way you are talking is making people leave. Look! There is no one here!\\" I looked down our side of the bar, and the 3 people (which was everyone) at the bar had disappeared. \\n\\nThe guy pays and leaves. It's like a victory. I clap for him in my head. \\n\\nWe then are asked if we want another beer. Surprising! A minute later the other bartender asks if we want anything. Now we don't.\\n\\nIt was bizarre.

The sauce was delicious and topped with an abundance of fresh sauteed mushrooms.\\n\\nPork St. Moritz ($15.25) ... Sehr Gut!\\n\\nKinda like cordon bleu, but with the ham and cheese on top instead of inside. The two large, pounded and breaded pork scallops were sauteed then topped with Emmentaler cheese and Black Forest ham, served in a delicious Madeira sauce with creamy mashed potatoes and vegetables.

It was perfect to warm us up on a cold, wet day in Austin. \\n \\nHOWEVER... I was willing to overlook the shoddy service while we were there (the waitress blamed that on the \\"system going down\\"), and the fact that we didn't get refills only once (and with some spicy chili, we needed more), but once we got home and realized we were double charged for our nacho appetizer on our receipt, I called the restaurant a few hours after we left to get it fixed.  After asking for a manager, the person who answered told me there was \\"no manager on duty\\" and to call back and ask for the manager, Russell, the following day at 9:30 AM.\\n\\nI called at 9:45 the following morning and was rudely told no one had time to talk on the phone and to call back in 15 minutes.  When I did just that, the same person answered the phone again, let out a long sigh and told me to call again after 2pm... after explaining \\"they had a rough morning\\".\\n\\nI played along and called Russell around 2:45 PM in the afternoon.  After telling him I had been double charged for my appetizer, he told me to wait 3 days for the credit card charges to clear and he was \\"98% sure\\" I would only be charged once.  After trying to explain it THREE different times to him that it wasn't my *card* that had been charged twice... it was one item on my receipt that we had been charged for, he finally quit talking long enough for me to fully explain my side of the story.  He was so busy *assuming* he knew what I was asking that he didn't stop to listen to his customer.  Once he stopped and listened and I explained it for a fourth time, he said, \\"Oh, so how much do I owe you?\\"  I looked at my receipt and told him the $5.75 for the nachos...  He proceeded to laugh at me and say \\"well, just come in and I'll give you $6 out of my wallet.\\".\\n\\nDefinitely NOT the way I expected a manager to treat his restaurant guest.  \\nI've worked in food service for the majority of my life and I can honestly say I've never seen such blatent disregard for the customer.

The fish taco was literally like a little filet of fish with raw spinach and huge slices of avo on top. Presentation wasn't that great, but taste was amazing. The taco was bomb AF--soooo flavorful and huge. However, the tamale was too dry and a big let down. I'm a pescatarian, so maybe the meat tamale was better, but my friend said hers was pretty dry and not worth getting again. \\n\\nThere are two unisex restrooms, and they have a TV and a full bar.

Now that was pretty yummy.  The hollandaise was delish and she really loved their homemade corned beef hash.  The eggs, however, were not poached right and just ran and made a completely gooey mess (they should be slightly cooked - this practically seemed raw).  The grilled mash is like a brick of leftover mashed potatoes grilled with a TON of extra garlic added.

I love that this market has a mixture of both restaurants and small shops with novelty items. As you walk from vendor to vendor, you are sure to find something that you need - or a gift for a friend! I recommend parking in the small lot right outside the market if you're able; you can get this parking ticket validated by any of the vendors in the market which dramatically reduces your parking price. Once inside, enjoy taking a stroll around the market before making any decisions. There are so many wonderful vendors to see and so much food to sample!\\n\\nSome of our favorites included Dos Hermanos Mexican (fantastic authentic street tacos), Kitchen Little (barbecue), Little Eater (health food), Taste of Belgium (waffles and crepes), and of course, the original Jeni's ice cream. You may be stuffed after all the delicious food you've sampled, but do not pass up Jeni's without getting a few pints to take home for later!\\n\\nAnother gem in the Hidden Market is The Barrel & Bottle, a super cool beer and wine store with some exotic selections. Pennsylvania has very strict alcohol regulations and independent retailers like this are not allowed to market there, so I always love finding unique stores like The Barrel & Bottle when I visit other states. While there, we grabbed a delicious Riesling called \\"Frisk.\\" It was marketed as a \\"prickly Riesling,\\" which sounded interesting to us.

The staffers would put those people's names down on the list and tell them that they could wait at the deli/pizza place next door.

Good place to get fried chicken. Will you be floored by their fried chicken? Probably not, but it's well-seasoned and tasty. \\n\\nGus's is a chain serving hot & spicy fried chicken. Kind of similar to Nashville Hot Chicken, but different. Nashville Hot Chicken uses sauce in its preparation, while Gus's isn't saucy. \\n\\nThis location is in downtown Chamblee. At this location, the parking area is small but I've never had trouble finding parking. Parking is free. The inside of the restaurant is simple with a Southern homey feel to it. There are tables for sitting but the dining area isn't that big, maybe you can seat one or two large groups. \\n\\nThe menu is simple. They serve both white and dark meat fried chicken as plates, snacks, or a la carte. Prices are reasonable and you can get a plate for under $10. I decided to go with a two piece dark meat plate (leg and thigh) which comes with beans, slaw, and white bread. I have never tried their beans because I always opt for a side substitution for 50 cents extra. They serve beans, slaw, fried okra, fries, potato salad, greens, and mac & cheese as sides.\\n\\nThe chicken is served piping hot, crisp on the outside, and juicy on the inside. It's seasoned well with spices that translate well through the batter. It has a kick to it but it's not that spicy. I've tried the slaw, french fries, and the mac & cheese - all are average. I actually like the white bread that soaks up some of the chicken grease and seasoning. So bad, I know lol. The chicken isn't saucy at all so the white bread doesn't really soak up a lot or serve much purpose, but I still enjoy eating it with my chicken.\\n\\nEmployees are nice and friendly."},{"name":"Ball Square Cafe","address":"708 Broadway","city":"Somerville","stars":"4.5","text":"Service is great.

First of all, the location is primo. Ramen Station is a great addition to the Larkin on Memorial development. Neighboring the delicious pizza at Firepit, the well-caffeinated Full Commission and convenience of Grant Park Market you are already among some greats.\\n\\nNow let me be clear in saying this was my first \\"fancy\\" ramen experience. Beyond the Maruchan ramen packets, ya girl was a total newb walking into Ramen Station last week. It was about 8pm when we arrived and the two ladies at the register were welcoming and pumped to find out it was my first ramen adventure. We talked about the edamame and the musubi, but I decided I wanted to limit my experience to a big bowl of ramen this time. Next time, I fully intend to devour some of that spam musubi because I feel like that comes with some sort of badge of honor. Since it was my first experience, the girls wanted to ease me in and advised I start with the chicken shio. This is as basic as it gets folks. Chicken broth, veggies, chicken breast and a shoyu tamago egg (hard boiled egg marinated in soy sauce). I didn't need to be very brave to try this, as it felt basically like Japanese chicken noodle soup. I added in some sweet corn for a couple bucks more and it was a nice addition but I don't think I'll add it next time. I added some sriracha sauce to spice it up a bit and pretty much devoured the whole bowl. \\n\\nMy friend, who is a ramen fanatic, went with the spicy beef bowl. It was the clear winner of the two. I don't blame the girls for the basic recommendation, they were just ensuring I didn't get overwhelmed. The spicy beef is likely what I would order next time, as the broth alone was dreamy. The Korean chili paste gave it a great kick and didn't need any additional spice from sriracha. There was a heaping of bulgogi (beef) and noodles, as well as kimchi and shoyu tamago egg. If you have leftovers, they have the perfect takeaway containers.\\n\\nThe overall vibe felt welcoming. It was their first night open to the public, but we felt like we were friends with the staff before we even received our food. They had some solid tunes playing including Gorillaz, Phoenix and similar. The seating is comfortable including several 2 and 4 tops, as well as a bar looking into the kitchen.

There are way too many things on the tables. Flowers, a candle, salt and pepper, a bar menu, things sticking out of the flowers, then add the drinks and sugar and it's so crammed and annoying. Then there's the table situation. There are way too many tables and makes it so uncomfortable as you could hear everyone's conversation around you. My chair was touching the chair of the lady behind me and I felt like I had to lean forward the whole time because we were literally back to back. We had 3 adults, a toddler and an infant. The baby had to be on the floor because there just wasn't anywhere to put a sling for her car seat. It was really irritating and an obvious problem that the management should have solved from the get go. \\nTheir menu is hugeeeeee with this and that and pretty expensive. Im assuming their lunch and dinner menu is the same. They really should have a smaller condensed lunch menu with better pricing. \\n\\nMy mom had the French onion soup which was just plain weird. It tasted like thanksgiving stuffing. It was thick, beige in color had celery and I think sage in it too. True French onion is caramelized onions and a broth with good beefy flavor. Definitely not anything close to the real deal. She also had the \\"chopped salad\\" which wasn't chopped at all. It was just a greens salad with some veggies. \\n\\nMy dad and I had the Luna veggie burger and he also had the lobster bisque which he enjoyed. We both like our fries extra crispy so we always ask for them burnt and they came out like regular old fries. By this time we had been there for an hour so we chalked it up to a loss. As for the Luna burgers, I'm pretty sure they baked these as ours were pretty dry. If they grilled them they would be perfect. \\n\\nMy little one had the quesadilla with fruit and it was a pretty large portion for a child. The fruit was a great mix of berries which no restaurant really does because they are so expensive. \\n\\nMy dad told the owner it was a pretty good place but just way too crowded. His reply was \\"every restaurant is crowded\\". Uhhhhh, yea in NYC and big cities but not little old Worthington, Ohio. Obviously he doesn't take critique well or care what his customers think. \\n\\nMaybe I'll give it another try in a few months but truthfully I wasn't impressed at all, especially with the food."},{"name":"Deschutes Brewery Portland Public House","address":"210 NW 11th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"First time visitor.

I was however pleasantly surprised on both of my trips here.\\n\\nLet's start with what's most important: the food. Both times I ordered ribs and the first time I went with a full rack of baby backs ($22.50) which come with garlic bread and two sides and the second time I went with their 'Double Trouble' ($18) option which features 1/3rd of a rack of baby back and 1/3rd of St. Louis. On a personal level, the full rack was too much food but the baby racks are far superior to the St. Louis ones. I enjoyed them way more than I thought I would and the sides were pretty good.\\n\\nSpeaking of sides, they have three pricing tiers for sides, something I had never seen before. The few I've had were good except for the fried tomatoes which I didn't think were that great and the wife agreed. Their fried dill pickle appetizer ($7) is awesome and you should definitely get it with some ranch dipping sauce. All in all, the food there is reliably good in a consistent way and the prices are fine. This won't be the best BBQ you'll have but it's pretty good.\\n\\nThe atmosphere itself is pretty gimmicky and feels a bit forced but it's fine. It's super casual which I love and the service is pretty good without being too stiff due to it being a chain. Our waitresses both times have been friendly and attentive and even made some good recommendations. The only weird thing I found was those weird and very unnecessary touchpads on the table which we can use to place orders, call a waitress over and even pay. I find that super weird and we tried our best to avoid using them entirely.\\n\\nThey have all kinds of promotions and even all-you-can-eat wings on Monday nights.

As for the food, it was pretty tasty. I had the meatloaf which was hearty and homey and the mashed potatoes it came with were nice and chunky. I also appreciated the free glass of wine I got with my check in offer!\\n\\nThough it was about a four star experience, I take off one star because of the condescending attitude from our waiter. He wasn't especially friendly from the get go, but what really got on my nerves was when we dared to ask questions about the happy hour signage that they had on every table. According to the signs, they had happy hour from 11pm-1am, and one of the drinks listed was a gross but interesting sounding 'Cosby' jello pudding shot. We were curious about it so we ordered one. The waiter gave us an incredulous look and said no one actually ever ordered that, but that he'd go and check to see if they had any (which they didn't). He then proceeded to say it's not something that he'd ever recommend having or ordering and that's why they don't have them in stock. \\n\\nOK, clarify something for me. If something you list on your menu is so gross and foul that you'd harshly judge anyone who deigned to order it, then why is it posted in a little plastic cube on every table? The fact that they were out of it didn't bother me as much as the fact that he made us feel dumb for even asking about it. This is the kind of snobbishness I don't stand for, whether it's a five-star restaurant or a trying to be trendy diner. Too bad, because  otherwise I really liked the concept of this place and how convenient it was to our hotel. \\n\\nMy recommendation is for the waiter to get an attitude adjustment and for The Original to take anything off their menu that they wouldn't proudly serve, happy hour or not!"},{"name":"Harpoon Tap Room","address":"1 Harborside Dr","city":"Boston","stars":"2.5","text":"I'm diggin' the Harpoon Tap Room in Terminal A!

I think what's making this restaurant a bare pass is the fact that the food here is pretty good.\\n\\nWhat i DID NOT like about this restaurant:\\n1. Service SUCKS: our hostess was nice, so was the bartender; but our waitress and our chef was horrible and didnt speak a lot of english and always looked angry. our waitress kept getting our orders wrong and we only found out as the chef's making the food but the chef refuses to fix the orders until he is able to wave down the waitress, who is never able to be seen. at one point, while he was serving the fried rice and missed me, i said, i asked for the fried rice, and he said \\"no you ordered WHITE RICE, not FWIDE RICE\\" I'm sorry, WHAT? if you speak with an accent, do you hear with an accent too? because you are telling me i ordered FWIDE rice and thats why there's a mix up?  i just dont understand why he was correcting me. After ten minutes, another waitress finally came and told me they can no longer make the fried rice on the hibachi grill and must make it in the kitchen if i still want the upgrade, and stood there staring at me while i had to make a choice. my boyfriend said he'll trade with me and let me have the hibachi one....and they still charged us for it...For the record, neither the hibachi or the back kitchen fried rice were worth the 1.50 upgrade. AUTOMATIC 18% GRATUITY for the 7 of us for the horrible service annoyed me\\n\\n2. LOUDNESS: for a person's birthday, they have this loud asian bong that they would hit (like in chinese new year) really loud  and nonstop while carryinig a bday cake from the kitchen to the person's table. Ok, one time is okay. twice it's getting a little annoying. Three times is actually really annoying. FOURTH AND FIFTH TIME?? how many ppl are having birthdays? i can't hear myself chew nor can i have a conversation...all i have the entire meal is pounding in my head.\\n\\notherwise, i guess the place was okay. The chefs all put on a show, but we had a crappy chef who lacked enthusiasm and sounded like he was reading off a script very lazily, and looked like he couldnt wait to get out. I'm not interested in the show to begin with, but it was pretty unprofessional. I saw another chef across a different table and he was a lot more interesting. \\n\\ni ordered the sukiyaki steak (19) and my boyfriend ordered the steak and scallop (25). The soup and salad that came with the meal was PHENOMENAL, so was the hibachi shrimp that came as appetizer. I loved the hibachi vegetables too.  Both of our steak was overcooked, and the sukiyaki steak was not good. The normal sirloin steak looks like steaktips, but the sukiyaki steak was essentially a flat piece of beef wrapping a LOT of scallion. As they cooked it they slice it up into what looks like beef on a chinese broccoli and beef rice noodle. The fried rice tasted like too much soy sauce, but the hibachi scallops and bean sprouts were also phenomenal. \\n\\nthe drinks were not good. i had a pina colada and it was creamy, hard on alcohol, but not sweet at all, which was weird.\\n\\nwe got a spicy salmon roll as a appetizer as we waited to be seated (they refuse to seat you if your party is not all here) and it looked like it was a starving maki, but it turned out to taste pretty great.\\n\\ni'm not interested in coming back to this restaurant, but my boyfriend enjoyed it so i might have to come back."},{"name":"North Market","address":"59 Spruce St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4.5","text":"There are times when I need my 5 senses obliterated ..... with food & fun!

I have been to Banger's over 20 times in the past two months. I would consider myself a regular, but I've never seen the same waiter twice--even though I go on Fridays almost every week. \\n\\nLet's just face it, everyone wants to know the bad:\\n\\nBAD:  The sausages are ok.  I've eaten a lot of sausage in my life (har har) including eating them in Europe and some of their mixtures aren't as 'solid' as they should be. I've also had undercooked sausage which I ate anyway because I was starving and paid the price the next day.  \\n\\nSome of the spicy sausages are just overkill and all you are tasting is spicy meat and it might as well just be crappy pork.  Not to mention on the good sausages the delicate flavors  get completely overpowered by the heavy handed sauces and condiments.  I get all of my toppings on the side and compose my sausages myself now.  \\n\\nI've had a few stale kolache buns and sometimes the sides are hit or miss--the green beans are very greasy or not at all and sometimes your mason jar is filled to the top and sometimes halfway full.  The fries are great and the poutine isn't half bad.  The creamed corn can be very watery and undercooked and  hell, if Rudy's can get it right, then so should Banger's.\\n \\nAlso, the pickles are limp and the heat on them is one note.  They also do not ever have samples, so expect to pay full price for something you might not like.\\n\\nService is hit or miss.  I've had the same server twice, but other than that have never had the same waiter again.  I've been there when the outside and inside are barely full and our food took forever to come.  The waiters have been usually attentive, but at times can be nowhere to be found.\\n\\nOne particular night a few weeks ago was especially a problem.  We came in and were waiting for some friends and were seated immediately when they came.  We were brought to a table in the back second row of outside and told our server would be right with us.  We watched about five different waiters walk past us for 20 minutes and NONE of them made eye contact with us once.  I was starving and our friends had just gotten off a flight from New York.  I had to finally go inside to get a hostess to help me with my problem because the waiters literally ignored us when we tried to get their attention.\\n\\nFinally our waiter arrived, some business about how the row had been split earlier in the night when it was busy and they never told him he had the whole row.  We had no problem with him and he was quick and attentive during our time with him, but when the bill came, even though we waited over 20 minutes, we didn't even get a free drink. Not even one.  \\n\\nPros: Great backyard, but the hostess will ALWAYS huff if you ask to be in the sun or in the shade, so just expect that. The dog run is awesome, but only really full on Tuesdays.  Amazing music, seriously the person who chooses those bands is amazing at their job and deserves a raise.

Together, my group shared the following:\\n\\n1) Uni-versal pasta - squid-ink pasta in a sea urchin (uni) cream sauce; these two ingredients made the dish unique and incredibly delicious. Uni can be quite briny in taste, but mixed in with the pasta, which is also served with an egg yolk nestled on top, it was perfectly balanced. The fish roe and micro greens added a good texture contrast as well.\\n\\n2) Iron Man 2.0 - a grilled flat iron steak served inside a little cast iron skillet; comes with succotash. This dish was my least favourite as I didn't find it stood out like the other dishes.\\n\\n3) Belly-to-belly - br√ªl√©ed and smoked pork belly (now you get the title, eh?) that was THE MOST SUCCULENT PORK BELLY I'VE EVER HAD! The pickled apples and daikon added a refreshing, acidic flavour contrast. \\n\\n4) Barack O'Lamb-a - you've heard of wood-smoked meats, but have you ever heard of one that's smoked with TEA?! Cuz that's what The Rise uses for this lamb dish, matcha tea to be precise. If that's not different enough for you, it's served with a blueberry sauce.

We never even got that far. A friend and I had 7 pm reservations on a Tuesday night -- typically a pretty slow night for dining out. We showed up on time but were told there would be a wait for our table -- a pet peeve of mine. We were directed to \\"the bar\\" -- a minuscule area where we were literally standing over other diners. Feeling uncomfortable, we moved back to the front door and waited 25 minutes to be seated. We were told that we would be brought complimentary appetizers because of our wait. Less than a minute after being seated at a very small two-top, a deafening alarm went off. I don't know if it was due to smoke or fire or some other potential hazard because we were never informed. Everyone went about their business as though everything were normal. Seven minutes later, with the alarm still going full tilt, we were brought a pedestrian bowl of edamame. This comnstitutes the free appetizers because of our wait? Not good enough, Umi -- not by a long shot. We bailed and walked 25 yards to King & Duke, where we were warmly greeted and seated within 15 minutes, despite not having a reservation and despite the fact that they were quite busy as well. We had a great meal with exceptional service. I'm sure the sushi at Umi is great, but there are a LOT of places in Atlanta to get a good meal where one is treated decently as well, I won't be surprised when, in a year or two, once the shine has dimmed a bit at this restaurant, it announces that it's closing.

We made reservations, so we were seated promptly. And service started off great. Our waiter seemed personable, we let him know that we came out to FL to celebrate my birthday. We ordered a few drinks, and expressed our excitement to try all the food. Everything looked and sounded amazing. \\n\\nWe ordered 3 dishes to share: dragon roll poke bowl, Korean beef bowl, and garlic noodles. To our dismay, nothing met our expectations. The Korean bowl was way too sweet, the garlic noodles didn't taste like garlic, and the poke was sinewy. We decided to be honest with our waiter the next time he checked on us. Usually I shy away from telling the truth whenever I'm asked how everything is during any dine-out meal, if I end up not liking the food. Usually because, I don't want to make a big deal out of it and am not really looking to send food back or get a free pass on stuff... This time, I decided to let our server know that I wasn't really happy with the food, since he asked.\\n\\nHis entire energy shifted. Instead of being concerned about how things could improve, he became defensive. When we made a comment about the garlic noodles lacking in garlic taste, he came out with raw garlic paste to prove to us that it was used in the dish and told us we could use it to add extra. There is a difference when it is cooked in the food vs. using it as a form of dipping sauce.\\n\\nHe also stopped checking on us after the fact, until we asked for the check. This shift in energy threw off our experience even more and Yak & Yeti left a bad taste in our mouths...literally and figuratively.

It was lightly dressed and there were a few additions that added a nice flavor and texture to it. The Reuben was by far one of the best I have had since moving to Orlando. There was a very generous portion of meat and just the right amount of sauerkraut and dressing. That bread was nicely toasted and had an excellent flavor. I took my time eating this Reuben savoring every bite. I noticed that they had some Peach herb tea and for my refill I tried it. WOW is what I have to say... \\n\\nGreg, the owner, came out and greeted me and after telling him how I heard of them let me know he was also a bicycler.

Our visit here was absurd by any dining standard.......\\n         We made a reservation for Christmas supper, thinking that this would be a fun and stressless alternative to our typically ambitious multi course Christmas meals. We were so painfully wrong. I will cook 100 stressful Christmas meals before I would ever sit through another meal at this joke of a restaurant. \\n        We arrived slightly early and we were seated immediately, because another group had just gotten up and left. We were soon to find out why they looked so disgruntled....... After being seated we were waited on by what I can only describe as an alternate/bizarro universe Elvis Presley look alike. But, only imagine if Elvis hadn't had his weight gain and instead had become addicted to uppers. This would almost be him, but only almost. Throughout the 2.5 hours we were here, this guy mumbled and twitched his way about the dining room, bobbing amongst patrons like a spinning top. It was comic for about 10 minutes, and then just sad, pathetic, and utterly annoying for the the next 2hrs and twenty minutes. His partner in crime, a very young girl who looked about 19, and dressed like a character from circe du soleil, was pacing up and down the dining room, doing what you ask? Well we never figured that out. How could we? Because there was zero communication about whatever epic #*!*up happened in the back of the house here to cause the absolute and total chaos that was omnipresent on this most special of evenings. This is 3 paragraphs thus far dear reader, and we haven't even touched upon the food........\\n      If you like the caricature version of Indian food, where every curry tastes of the same blandness, the food looks neon from the over abundance of food coloring, and the naan is burnt beyond return............... hey!!!!! This is your place!!!! It took 2.25 hours to get our food, and if it had all been delicious maybe I wouldn't have written this and just ignored this experience out of Christmas cheer. But, the food was awful, just awful. I ate it because I was so hungry, plain and simple. This meal would be exemplary on how to NOT make Indian cuisine. \\n     On one of my multiple trips to the restroom (it was a lengthy dinner) I did manage a peek inside the kitchen. There was only one elderly chef working all alone back there. How could they not have planned better for this night? They knew it would be busy. So, what monumental cluster %&^! happened here? We'll never know. And We'll never return here. My brother and I did joke that it was one of those rare absurd experiences in life where you can't believe you're actually witnessing something this terrible unfold, akin to watching \\"The Room\\" or \\"Manos, The Hands of Fate\\"- so bad it's good.

Some days the meat is really good and tastes fresh other times its almost inedible. I like to smoke my own ribs and brisket from time to time so I understand there are many variables and its not always easy turning out a consistently good smoked meat however to me it appears the inconsistency stems mostly from sloppy lazy prep work and\\\\or rushed impatient cooking. \\n\\nLast weekend we ordered carry out for a late dinner; we had a couple pulled pork sandwiches, a brisket sandwich and a rack of ribs. The sandwiches were okay but nothing special, the meat was dry and definitely needed sauce to save the sandwich from being a flavorless chewy mess. \\n\\nThe rack of ribs was a complete and utter disgrace to the name of BBQ. The rack had clearly not been trimmed properly as the entire underside was covered in thick hard fat as well as the undesirable membrane known as the \\"silver skin\\" that is normally removed by any competent BBQ joint in addition to big chunks of inedible fat and various hard tissue all of which should have been removed by the chef if not the butcher. It also had not been cooked long enough and had no smoke flavor at all or any visible pink \\"smoke ring\\" widely known as the mark of a good smoked meat product. The result was a grizzly and chewy mess that was mostly pitched in the trash. \\n\\nThe most recent order I placed will probably be my last time as I hate to take a chance and waste my eating out money on a pricey meal considering its not even a sit down experience."},{"name":"The Original Dinerant","address":"300 SW 6th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"I feel like I keep getting lured in by their location (heart of downtown), concept (comfort food with a twist) and decor (upscale reinvented diner).

But on my first breakfast visit, I was served something that was inedible. It was just all kinds of wrong from the construction of the dish to the five different temperatures and textures of the components. And to the complete credit of the server, who happened to be extremely busy that day, he noticed I wasn't eating and made it right. I was able to order a replacement meal and went with the very basic buttermilk pancakes. The actions of the server are the only reason why I gave them a second chance.  \\n\\nThe next week I wanted to grab a quick breakfast downtown and my friend suggested The Original and I thought why not?  The lines at Bijou and Mother's are out the door and I don't feel like going fancy (VQ) or hitting a food cart (Brunchbox). But the problem is that now I am gun shy.

Five co-workers and I got individual pizzas and a salad to-go for an office celebration, excited to try \\"the new place\\" that opened a couple of months back in Kruse Village. We liked the concept of individual, reasonably priced pizzas, which fit the different tastes and lunchtime budgets of multiple people. The food was ready when I arrived to pick it up but it was unclear where to go, and I ended up standing in 2 different lines before finding the guy that *sort of* knew about my order. Fortunately I had the online confirmation page and realized before leaving that they had forgotten to include my boss' salad. While I was waiting for the person who knew about the salad to retrieve it from the back room, another customer next to me was returning the pizza he'd just picked up, because he'd ordered tomatoes and had received plain cheese. After the salad was located and I was heading out, I noticed that the pizza boxes were unmarked; I asked how to determine which was which, and was told to open each one and look at the number that was checked on the paper liner under the pie. That was not entirely helpful, since nobody recalled what number they had chosen; we had to pull up the online again menu back at the office and read the descriptions to figure out whose was whose.\\n\\nI ordered a Jasper (mozzarella, mushrooms, spicy Italian sausage and red sauce). My pizza was flavorful but extremely sparse on toppings, dry, and poorly constructed. The crust was chewy and had a nice texture, however there was almost no sauce.

Shame on me...\\n\\nLet me set the scene: A winter night in German Village, with snow gently covering the brick streets. On the outside, G Michael's looks like the other gorgeous brick houses in the village, and inside it's dark, rich, and swanky. This is a perfect date spot.\\n\\nG Michael's was one of the pioneers in the modern day Columbus food scene. I think its age and maturity are both a blessing and a curse.\\n\\nOn one hand, this place is a well-oiled machine, and everything is absolutely perfect. The interior is pristine, the service is top-notch, and the food is divine. I had one of the best steaks of my life--you know... the kind that make your eyes roll back in your head. They also have an incredible wine selection--my friend and I easily polished off a bottle between us. Oh, and they handled my stupid wheat thing like total pros. \\n\\nOur server was absolutely lovely too. He was a bit formal for me (actually, G Michael's as a whole was a tad stiff for my taste), but he was still warm, friendly, and joked around with us. 5 stars for him.\\n\\nAnd on the other hand, something about this place felt a little off. When I went to the restroom, they had these placards all over the wall touting awards they had won--about a decade ago. I think that was pretty indicative of any small qualms I had with G Michael's: a little like they were resting on their laurels of yesteryear. While everything was technically perfect, it didn't seem alive. No one seemed excited about being there to provide this stellar experience.   \\n\\nBut let me be clear: any small negatives I had here were *my* issue--not theirs. It's just about taste preferences.\\n\\nG Michael's is most definitely on the fancier side, and the price reflects it. But hey--when you're talking about perfect, it ain't cheap.

We wanted to be able to watch the fireworks from Disney, so we made an 8:30 dining reservation. The fireworks times change, so be aware of this when making your appointment. Capa sits atop the 17th floor of the Four Seasons Resort, on Disney property, offering amazing views of the nightly fireworks. We had enough time to enjoy drinks and appetizers before being invited to go out on the patio to watch the fireworks. We ordered a shrimp cocktail and a cheese plate. The blue cheese was some of the best I've ever eaten. The pairings of the cheeses with sweet honeycomb and sugared cracker bread were divine! Our server encouraged us to order entrees before the show, so we would have perfect timing and no wait time between appetizer and entree. We took his suggestion and the timing was perfect. I ordered the 8oz. Filet with brown butter truffle sauce, and additional truffle and brown butter potatoes and mushrooms. My husband ordered the sirloin and asparagus. The steaks were perfectly prepared and the flavor of the food was delicious. Every song morsel of food was so good, I wanted to take my time to enjoy it. We were too full to order dessert but the resort surprised us with a beautiful platter of churros and chocolate/caramel sauce, wishing us a \\"Happy 21st Anniversary.\\" We would highly recommend this restaurant. The ambiance of the restaurant reminded me of Vegas, with all of the beautiful red fabrics displayed on the ceiling like a Chihuly glass sculpture in Bellagio.

This place is an oasis for the senses. \\n\\nTHE SCENE\\nI'm not what you would consider a classy guy. I'm in sweats or shorts and a t-shirt most of the time, I could care less about designer name brand clothes and I barely own any suits, shoes or jewelry. There is almost nothing about me that has \\"bling\\" and to top all that off, I rolled up to the valet in a minivan. \\"Be careful, it's expensive\\" I said as I handed over my keys.  \\n\\nMeanwhile, the sum total of just three of the cars I saw in the parking lot would buy my dream house. (Bentley's, Ferrari's and Lamborghini's hang out here). But I will say that although I don't look the part of a well groomed gentleman, I enjoy beautifully thought out design and inspiring atmosphere... to which Canoe has in bucket loads. Here's what you need to know:\\n\\n* The decor and friendliness of the staff were as good (if not better) than I could ever ask for in a restaurant. \\n* The valets were real pro's, the host staff were welcoming and our server Naisson was efficient and precise. However, he was a considerable bit slower than we would have liked in taking our order. \\n* The interior design provides a wide variety of seating ambiances from romantic tables for two to brightly lit window seats for families and groups. Not to mention a lovely shaded outdoor patio that had a wonderful breeze on this day.  \\n* The well landscaped grounds behind the restaurant sit along the banks of the Chattahoochee River and are absolutely gorgeous. There are many venues to sit and talk while taking in the beautiful scenery. Truly an amazing place to impress a first date, out of town guests or a beautiful bride of almost 15 years. \\n\\nFrom the very moment we sat down I was eager to order and have my taste buds singing with happiness. Have you ever started writing a review in your head just based on the anticipation from watching plate after mouthwatering plate pass your table? \\n\\n-------------- - - - - -\\n\\nTHE FOOD\\n* The Chicken Biscuit ($18.50) was flavorful & the poached eggs were perfect. It was an off-menu special described by our server that had me salivating long before it arrived. Would have preferred the biscuit to be a little softer though. The hash brown potatoes w/onions were also very good. (4 stars) \\n\\n* The French Toast ($13) was practically a dessert. Loaded with sweetened fruits and stuffed with banana cream, it was delicious and beautifully presented. (4 stars)\\n\\n* Mixed basket of breads ($7) was a nice appetizer to our hungry crew. I really loved the jellies that came with the breads. (3.5 stars)\\n\\n* Truffle frites ($7) were ok. I guess I was just expecting more flavor. (3 stars)\\n\\n* Side of bacon ($3.50) our server encouraged us to order this by selling the fact they cure their own bacon and stating \\"it's amazing.\\" We didn't find this bacon to be any better that what you find on a Golden Corral buffet. We expected a thicker cut and instead received these paper thin crispy strips. I prefer pan fried bacon instead of oven baked and I'm pretty sure this was oven baked bacon. (2 stars)\\n\\nNOTE: Our kids didn't really enjoy their pancakes from the children's menu and instead ate most of my wife's French toast.\\n\\n-------------- - - - - -\\n\\nOVERALL (3.75 stars)\\nI've heard much ado about this place for a long time and I must say it IS deserving of all its accolades.

The flat bread was okay, I wasn't impressed. And finally, a dessert that is generally a favorite was sub par.

Tender and so Flavorful... but wait! There's more! The chicken came with rice and beans and the tortillas and a roasted chili pepper and some cilantro, lime and onions- it was like a party on a plate... so delish! Yummm-- we also got an horchata drink (non-alcoholic) the best horchata milk I've tasted in quite a while!\\nAnd then.. oh yes we had desert!

One evening I brought a small group an hour before closing.  There was no host to greet us and we stood around several minutes waiting for someone before just heading to the bar, waited around for a bartender, waited another 15 minutes to get our drinks (nothing fancy either, just beer and sodas), and finally got a table by flagging down the only waiter.  If it weren't for the excellent potato pancakes served to me later that evening, I would have completely given up on this place after that experience.\\n\\nFast forward to another dinner visit several months later: service was prompt, attentive, friendly, but the food was very lukewarm and I really don't like cold mashed potatoes.  \\n\\nI returned at a later date for lunch for my classic fondue with Bavarian pretzels.  Did I have to specify that I wanted my cheese hot?  At least the waitress corrected it quickly.\\n\\nFinally, today, I had the appetizer sampler and it started out wonderful but got progressively worse as I ate each part.  The fondue was absolutely delicious and reminiscent of my very first visit and the sausages were great as well. The schnitzel was all right, the potato cakes would've been good if I didn't put some ~sour~ (as in bad) sour cream on it (shame on me for not trying it before topping my food with it and shame on you for giving to me in the first place), and the crab cakes were very disappointing.

While enjoying our food, we had a front row seat for the preparation of various salads which were among the most appetizing I have ever seen.  The setting was just as beautiful as the food, and I look forward to devoting a full night to enjoying Scampo!\\n\\nOther tasty moments included several chocolate samples at Beacon Hill Chocolates, bahn mi sandwiches and deviled eggs from the Bon Me food truck (if you have never had a bahn mi sandwich, you are missing out!), delicious clam chowder at Turner Fisheries (who again were very accommodating with the shellfish allergy), and delicious cheese, wine, and other samples from Bacco's Wine and Cheese.  Visiting Bacco's was one of my favorite parts of the entire tour.  It is located on St. James Street, just a few blocks from Boston Common, making it a convenient source of gourmet snacks for picnics in the park.  They even assemble small snack boxes each day, which inspires me to spend an afternoon one day soon relaxing and eating in the park vs just passing through.  After several other stops, the tour culminated in a visit to L'Espalier, where we had the most artistic dessert I've ever seen, and also one of the best.  \\n\\nAll in all, it was a perfect day for many reasons.  My mom got a walking tour of Beacon Hill and the Back Bay, punctuated by stops for delicious samples and interesting anecdotes regarding Boston history and foodie facts, and my recently relocated sister-in-law received a fantastic introduction to the city and an insider's guide to some of the best eats.  As for my husband, who I am still trying to turn into as much of a foodie as myself, he now understands why I've been raving about these tours for the past few months, and better yet, wants to return to many of the places we ventured- success!!!

Mom and I decided to have one of our mini adventures today and I looked through my bookmarks and discovered this little gem of places around town I'd been wanting to visit. Just so everyone knows this little tea house has 2 entrances. The main one is on Broadway, while the back one is on Pleasant and right across from the new parking garage for downtown Kissimmee. We parked in back and walked through the Pleasant entrance. We walked past an open space that they advertising as available retail space and then we came upon the dining room, complete with an open kitchen area.\\nWe were greeted by Jessica, our server who offered us a table. The room was decorated in what movie like to think of as Shabby Chic, with white lights and eclectic chandeliers adorning the ceiling. The tables were all set with white lace table.clothes and mismatched tea cup and saucer sets, along with napkins rolled in place with adorable napkin rings. Each table also held a floral centerpiece, a sweetener bowl and salt and pepper shakers. There were drink menus so you could choose your cup of tea. \\n\\nAs we decided on our drinks we couldn't help but notice all of the wonderful decor around us and that much of it was available to purchase. I chose a cup of hot peppermint tea while Mom opted for the iced Raspberry tea. Jessica also then brought over the rest of the menu and highlighted the days special as well as the soup of the day. Mom decided to go with the special, which was a Reuben and I picked the mushroom quiche with fresh fruit. I was hoping for the stuffed tomato but all of their salads contained celery, which u have to avoid so I figured I could at least eat the quiche filling. As we sat and enjoyed our tea selections we continued to look around the room at all of the offerings. Before long our meals were brought out. Upon her first bite Mom had a satisfying smile. I took my 1st bite and knew I made a good choice. My only downside was that the temperature of the quiche wasnt consistent all of the way through, but it was still delicious.

My wife and I decided to try Umi to celebrate our 25th. I booked 2 weeks before and wanted 8pm. I was told 6 or 9pm so I chose 9. They said they require a credit card to book which I gave them. I was told if I did not show there would be a $65 non refundable fee. I said fine. The day before I get a message from Takka that I need to call back to confirm my reservation. \\n\\nThis irritated me as they already had my credit card. If they were doing this to remind me (which they stated was the reason) then the message should be just to remind me that I had a reservation and not to make me jump through more hoops by having to call back. I was put on hold then had to wait for him to find my reservation. I mean we are only talking about MF sushi!! Excuse the pun as the chef and co owner is from MF Sushi that closed down. \\n\\nWe checked in at 9:02 and were told we would have to wait as they were running behind. They said go to the bar and drink. We could not get near the bar so I went back to ask how long till we can sit. I was told 15 to 20 minutes but they would take us to this EXCLUSIVE bar a few doors down. We were let in seated and then summarily ignored for 22 minutes. It's now 9:30 and we don't even have a glass of water. We go back to Umi and I ask again how long. The guy says another 10 to 15 minutes. \\n\\nThen I tell him how frustrated I was with the whole booking shenanigan as well as having to wait 45 minutes for a 9pm reservation and it's our sSlver Anni. The owner leans forward and says your reservation is cancelled you can leave. He threw us out and ruined our silver anniversary celebration. He had absolutely no reason to do this as at no time did I ever raise my voice or cause a scene.

I looked over the reviews and pictures on their Yelp biz page before selecting which seats to buy.  There wasn't a big price difference between the VIP seats and the regular seats so we purchased the VIP seats. I was aware we would be farther away from the stage but we would have our own private table and the venue seemed small so we would still have a good view.\\n\\nWhen we arrived we were taken to our table. We were the second row in on the balcony area. There was another couple seated in front of us and to see the performer we had to look over their table. It was very distracting. Every time they started talking or clinked their wine glasses together it interrupted our viewing. What was most annoying was the waiter. When he came to deliver the bottle of wine to the table he stood in front of their table, completely blocking our view of the stage. He stood there, opened and uncorked the wine, waited for them to taste it, poured more wine, set the bottle down and then left. I recognize this is standard procedure for ordering/pouring wine but when you have this type of set up with a concert going on it might be nice if the staff could be considerate of the other guests in the room... especially since he was also our waiter. \\n\\nOther than that the seats are pretty far back. When we could see it wasn't that great of a view. The cheaper seats near the front have pros and cons as well. Obviously the view is better as you are MUCH closer and the tickets are cheaper. You do have to share a table with other people and the space does seem cramped. I really think they'd be better off taking out a table or two and giving everyone some more room.\\n\\nThe food is nothing to write home about. The chicken and sides I got were fine but nothing exceptional. The shrimp and grits that my friend ordered and I tasted were the same. Both meals seemed over priced for what we received. \\n\\nI was glad that I got to see a performer that I've been wanting to see live for quite some time.

When the food came, fries were soggy (asked to new ones and they got them right away- much appreciated). The mango sushi roll was smothered in a super spicy sauce so it destroyed your tastebuds and all you could taste was a bit of mango and a lot of spice. Asked for salt...a girl went to look and told us she was having trouble finding some...never came back! Salt??!! You can't find salt in full service restaurant? I'm confused.

From where we sat, I could see people's juice being poured out of this jug and then served. \\n\\nAll and all, I wouldn't come again based on how the long wait was handled as well as charging people for another coffee.

I never write reviews but felt it was completely necessary in this case.\\n\\nFirst of all, we had to pay $100/person (used a facebook code for a discount, it could've been pricier) for what was supposed to be all you can eat/drink. \\n\\nWe got there and had to stand in a line. How do you pre-pay and stand at a line? Because there was a SINGLE person at the front checking everyone in. Regardless of the fact that she wasn't the brightest bulb, she was also pretty miserable. We probably should've known then to leave...\\n\\nThen we get to the coat check. This is where I pretty much lost it. After being cut several times and waiting in line for over 30 minutes, we got up there to be told there was no more room for coats. How do you sell hundreds of tickets for an end of December event and not anticipate that almost everyone coming is going to wear a jacket? It was bad enough there was only one kid working the coat check, never mind the fact they ran out of room. Obviously I made the kid make room, but everyone behind us was pretty much screwed. Plus we had to pay $5/coat. Didn't we already pay enough? Jeeze...\\n\\nForget about the food, I never saw any. Except for pop chips at the end of the night. \\n\\nThen there was the line to get drinks... The \\"top-shelf\\" ones? Ha yeah, I'm a bartender and my boss would NEVER put 3 of us behind the bar with the amount of people this place had. NEVER. He would never put that kind of pressure on us, and wouldn't want people to wait over 30 minutes to get a drink. And I'm also sure he wouldn't advertise something that he couldn't stand by. They only had one bar open with 3 people until almost midnight... That's when they opened a second with like one more bartender. Great. The bartenders also couldn't hear because of the music, and messed up orders...\\n\\nSpeaking of the music. The whole beginning of the night I didn't know what the hell was playing. I'm 22. I know every top song there is and then some. I don't want to hear techno \\"beats\\" and watch groupie weridos hover around the DJ. Awkward? The music got better later on in the night, thankfully, but it was still way too loud. I couldn't talk to anyone we saw there, and our whole groups ears were ringing the next day, even into the afternoon.\\n\\nThe place was pretty when we got there and got increasingly gross as the night went on. If you wore new shoes here, I'm so sorry for you because they are definitely ruined. There were cups everywhere, the floor was covering in alcohol and redbull (oh wait never mind, they ran out of that too), and everyone was spilling drinks on everyone. I mean spilling drinks once in awhile on the dance floor is to be expected but this place was ridiculous.\\n\\nI really wish I had something nice to say because this place had a lot of potential. It is pretty, with a great location as well. And I hope that their management  takes a step back and learns from what happened this past NYE.

I was looking forward to this brunch as the reviews were good. Our food took over an hour from time of order to arrive.  We had to follow up on our order twice before it came. After waiting 40 mins for the food, I asked the server and she said it was because the restaurant was busy as it was a full house which it clearly wasn't. She said the food was being plated. I told her we had hungry kids and after waiting another 20 mins, I asked again and again I was told it was being plated. There were only four other tables in the restaurant. The food finally arrived 1.5 hrs later and the waffles were hard and the eggs benny was burnt, ramen salty and meat in the skillet over cooked. The whole time we waited, management never checked on us and we were only asked once on water and coffee refills. Servers were nice but clearly inexperienced. I asked to speak with the manager as the quality of food and service was just unacceptable. She apologized and said it was because the chef called in sick and \\"I wish you could see what's going on downstairs so you can understand that we are trying\\". As a business though, no matter how chaotic, you always want your customers and patrons to see it as crisp and smooth and you should have backup when a chef calls in sick. Waiting over an hour for food that's coming out burnt and stale really isn't worth it and as compensation, she told us that we didn't need to pay gratuity.

You know, a place where you're happy to make yourself a regular. A place where not only do you not mind paying for a good meal, but you're indeed happy to because it's money well spent. Well I'm happy to say I've finally find a \\"home\\" at RusTeak. \\n    Being a chef myself and working in the fine dining industry, its nice to finally have a place to go where I can get fresh, delicious, creative food at a reasonable price. That's not to say this place doesn't have its faults becuase just like any other place on  earth, it does. The most noteable offense for me when I go here is the service seems to be consistently slow. Personally, its not much of an issue for me because when I come in I'm there to relax and have a good time eating and drinking. None the less, it can drag on from time to time. At least I'm recognized when I walk in though. That's a nice feeling.\\n    The staff are all very friendly and always pleasant. Even when it's winding down to the last 15 minutes of service for the night, people are still smiling and engaging. You can tell they haven't \\"clocked out\\" just yet. Being a chef though, I'd understand. And by the way, shame on you if you're one of these snotty, uppity people who walk in to ANY restaurant 15 minutes before closing and expect to sit down and take your time eating. You shouldn't even be ordering. Go to the 24 hour drive thru.\\n    Now that I got that out of my system, on to the food! My first time here, my wife got the blackened shrimp gnochhi which was tasty and well prepared. The shrimp were cooked just right as were the dumplings. I had the name-sake RusTeak burger with a side of the bistro fries. It was spot on! The meat was cooked just right, seasoned very well and the fries are the BOMB! The fries are probably my favorite thing on the menu. I do have a complaint about the burger though... when I had mine, and when my wife had hers on a seperate occasion, the yolk was broken both times. Not a HUGE deal, but I was taught as a cook that the PATRON breaks the yolk, not the kitchen.\\n\\n    Any way. A few other dishes we've had include the french dip sandwich which was tasty but nothing special if I'm honest. The lobster roll which was good but I probably wouldn't order it again unless I had that craving. The mahi sandwich which was perfectly prepared (I hate over cooked fish). Other sides we've sampled include the sweet potato tots which are good but not good enough for an upcharge, the house made chips which were cut a little on the thin side so they lose their crunch after sitting on the plate for a while and the potato salad which was actually pretty good. Still, nothing is going to compare to the bistro fries. \\n\\n    I'd recommend coming during their happy hour so you can try a few different things on the menu with out breaking the bank. Also, it wouldn't hurt to make a reservation because you never know whether or not its going to be crowded. The owner is REALLY nice as is all of the staff and they're very accommodating. If you have a special need, make a reservation a day ahead and they make every effort to do what they can. Don't show up during their rush however and expect to have your every need catered to. Get real. This is a small operation and is staffed as such. \\n\\nAll in all: Is it perfect? No. But I have yet to find a place that is. Do they do a great job? Yes! Without a doubt.

Singular Edison hanging light bulbs strung all about (it's cool looking). \\n\\nOur sever finally came over to table to get our drink order after we'd been sitting there for nearly 8min (she was nice; maybe new at the severing gig). My order usually turns out to be a stunner, because most servers are not as familiar with the menu as they should be, and therefore do not know the ingredients in the food, so the vegan thing throws them off, and I have questions they don't know the answers to. \\n\\nI wanted the Roasted Cauliflower GF $12.95, but I wanted to know if the cashew pesto contained parmesan cheese. Tradition pesto is made with parmesan, so I needed to know if the cashew pesto did or didn't. She said she wasn't sure and would have to find out. I explained that while I'm vegan I'm lactose intolerant also, so NO dairy, eggs, animals, or animal by-products! These details were apparently information overload, because she was completely confused after that. Therefore, I nixed the cauliflower and ordered the Veggie Burger (which is apparently vegan friendly, but probably not) with lettuce, tomato, onion, fresh jalape√±o slices on a gluten free bun ($2 extra). My BF just ordered the Steak House Beef  burger (simple and easy per usual). \\n\\nFortunately there are TV's, some decent soccer was on, good conversation, and fun people watching, because after 30min our food had still not arrived. Our server had not been back to the table since we ordered either. Just then our little server came over to the table to let us know \\"your ticket is next\\". Ahhhhh, did that mean our food was to the window next or it was being made next??? Apparently the latter, because it was 15 more minutes before we got our food to the table. \\n\\nEverything looked good. As I cut my enormous burger in half I noticed I literally had ONE puny slice of jalape√±o tucked inside. Umm, where are there rest of the jalape√±os (plural) I ordered?? I flagged down our server to bring me more jalape√±os and she soon return with the additional thinly sliced offering (see picture) that was SO not worth the additional $1.50 we were charged. There veggie patty itself was interesting; it was different in a good way. There coarsely chopped (what I assume) garbanzo beans and edamame. However the patty fell apart easily, was greasy as it seemed pan fried/seared in way too much oil (I could have done without that had I known), and it was far too salty for my liking. Had not it been greasy, breaded, and much less salt it would have been great! The fires were fine. \\n\\nMy BF was starving and gobbled his down. He said is burger was OK, and \\"There\\" bar across the street was so much better! I got the rest of mine to go and we got out of there. I'd be willing to try it again. I know it's new and with that comes trials, or maybe just meet friends for drinks cause the bar area is really cool looking."},{"name":"Mantra Restaurant","address":"52 Temple Pl","city":"Boston","stars":"2.5","text":"Mantra....

The place is very clean, limited seating so just need to keep your eye out when something becomes available which doesn't take too long since most people won't hang around when they're done.\\n\\nWe ordered the Taste of Maine that included one soda, bag of chips, and three 1/2 rolls (lobster, shrimp, crab) and 2 crab claws for $24. It was too little for two people and probably just right or maybe a bit more for 1 person, so we ordered another one. The crab claws were my favorite, then the lobster roll. The crab roll next, but I wasn't really feeling the shrimp roll. There could be more lemon in all of them I think personally, but the rolls were toasted nicely with butter. \\n\\nAfter I ordered, I realized I didn't get a bag of chips or soda which they said to just grab anything around the corner which I found odd since I feel like anyone could just grab soda or chips and it wouldn't really matter. Overall, it was just okay, I'm not sure if I would go again since I'd rather just get a larger, tastier lobster roll somewhere else."},{"name":"Teji's Indian Restaurant and Grocery","address":"2100B Guadalupe St","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"Sometimes I drive by this place and just want to stop by and grab naan.

I've had a few different dishes and was pretty satisfied with all of them. One thing I do love about this place is that when you order food spicy - it's spicy. If you've been to other places and wished your meal was a little hotter, I'd recommend giving Teji's a shot.

You can never have too much cheese. I liked that the fish wasn't fried either. It helped keep the fresh flavor. It was $3 for the taco which was reasonable for the size.

At this point I was pretty frustrated. Alas I commenced to squeeze on some lemon juice after picking the seeds out of my lemon wedge and took a bite of this atrocity. \\n\\nThe roll instantly fell apart. There was butter everywhere. I decided to ditch the bread and ate the lobster meat. Although it was fresh-tasting, the texture was extremely tough and rubbery- definitely overcooked. There was also very little tarragon flavor, all I could taste was the obscene amount of butter. Regardless, I couldn't justify wasting the meat so I ate it all. \\n\\nAt this point, I decided to just go home. I wanted to talk to the food truck guys but I will be contacting the owner instead.

The feedback about it, that I had heard from friends and family, was always 50/50. The service was hit and miss, the food quality varied, the menu limited, etc. So I chalked it up as another tourist trap with semi decent food. However, for my 26th birthday, I decided to give it a try and the urging of my family.\\n\\nFor those of you simply looking for the breakdown of the food quality it was excellent. I will say that throughout the evening the food I received, and sadly not the cocktails, was on par with some of the finer restaurants in Portland. Sure, it's no El Gaucho or Blue Hour, but it was definitely fine dining quality. For those of you looking for the full review please read on!\\n\\nMy family had made reservations two weeks in advance. Over the phone a window seat was requested, and we were told a note would be made but it helps to get there early to ensure we get one. My partner and I arrived 30 minutes before our reservation when we checked in, reminded the hostess of a window seat, and got an \\"Okay!\\" in response. We decided to wait at the bar for our table, and 30 minutes passed, then 40, and finally 45, before the hostess came over to let us know our table was now over.\\n\\nThe hostess led us to our table which was certainly not by the window, but actually next to a support pillar that completely blocked the view all together. As we were seated I reminded the hostess that we reserved a window seat, and asked for one when we arrived, to which I was given a smile and a comment to the effect of \\"You're waiter will be over in just a minute, and can...\\" I am assuming the remainder had to do with getting us the correct seat, but it's hard to tell when one mumbles as they walk away.\\n\\nSo we explain the situation to the waiter whom apologizes, moves us to the bar while we wait for a table we had requested, and explains to the bartender what is going on and why we have returned. It's now an hour past our reservation.\\n\\nSo we continue to sit at the bar, I am nursing my second drink, and we're chatting and enjoying the company. Now I say nursing my second drink, as it's hard to want to gulp a grey hound that is so much unsweetened grapefruit juice that the splash of vodka does little to mellow it out. While my mother chats about my brother and life after returning from deployment, and my father waxes poetic about the merit of film cameras, I glance at my watch. The reservation was 1 hour ago, now 1 and a half hours ago... I am watching the second hand tick as a waiter approaches just in time to prevent us from hitting the 2 hour waiting mark, and guides us to our table by the window.\\n\\nAs this review is getting almost as long as my wait I will save the details of what took places while we waited another 30 minutes for our appetizers to arrive, and the significant gaps between when our waiter did and not stop by to check in.\\n\\nThis establishment earned it's single star. I would dare say it did all one could to earn such a low mark. Two and a half hours before food arrived, not a single apology, or attempt to make an accommodation. Food that was good was overshadowed by significant wait times, and drinks that tasted more of water and fruit juice than an actual cocktail.\\n\\nI wouldn't dine here again, nor would I recommend it to friends. If you are looking for fine dining in this price range go up the road to El Gaucho, Blue Hour, Serratto, Ruth Chris, Le Pigeon... You get the point. Portland has excellent dining options, and this is not one of them."},{"name":"The Elder Tree Public House","address":"469 Flat Shoals Ave SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"This place had a great vibe.

The bread melts in your mouth, but it still gives a hearty feel for some reason.\\n\\nThe Hot Teacher. TILF. Wow. Sun-dried tomatoes, roasted portabellas, red peppers, sun-dried tomato pesto, mozz, and chedd. Wow. Just wow. So much goodness. The cheese was just slightly melted, not soggy. The pesto was oily, but not excessively so. The sweet, savory flavor gave the sandwich its depth. The other veggies added a complex, succulent flavor. All this could have gone over pizza or pasta, but it went perfectly on this glorious bread-enclosed parcel.\\n\\nAlso offered are chips, cookies, and potato salad. The tater portion of the tater salad was a bit undercooked. The flavor made up for it, though. Mustardy, but just the right amount. I would stick to the meat-plus-fillings grub here. Do it. Do it now.\\n\\nSo, it was good. SBS is indeed an awesome institution in the hip, but calm Mueller Hanger complex. Do what you can to get here.

I went there a bunch of times and never really had a great time.  The bar is in the center of the room with high top tables and booths lining the perimeter of the room.  This makes it difficult to move in this dump.\\nThey have plenty of beer and booze.  Probably about 7-10 beers on tap which is always a good sign.  There are dart boards by the front door, a game room for the kid in all of us, and an outdoor deck at the back with a beautiful view of the parking lot. \\n\\nThis place is always packed with locals.  They kind of suck.  I went in Halfway on a Sunny Saturday afternoon recently and the place was packed with people playing some game with a deck of cards.

I wanted them to shut up so I could watch TV.\\n\\nI have eaten there four times over several months and the food ranks among the worst I have had from an established restaurant.  Abysmal.\\n  \\nMy recommendation is that you do NOT go out of your way to visit the Halfway Caf and that under no circumstances should you eat a meal there (starvation is a much better option).

I tasted this lovely beer at the barbeque and beer festival in McMinnville. I think this may be the only beer I've ever ordered for myself at a bar! And even with $3 (or $3.50?) well drinks for happy hour, I didn't hesitate! The hubs had a blueberry Belgian-style beer (he was unhappy with it - too sweet) and then had the Zomer Wit which was his fave from the McMinnville beer fest.\\n\\nWe ate in \\"the den\\" which is downstairs from the main restaurant. The happy hour (5-7PM) was pretty decent - $3.50 on their beers (except seasonal - boo!), specials on food, and the aforementioned well drinks special. It's cool that they serve a full menu down in the den, even during happy hour, but it seems to make the service a little slower.\\n\\nI had 4 hot wings ($.50 each) and the jalapeno cream cheese-stuffed pretzel with beer cheese dipping sauce ($4.75, I think). The wings came with 2 carrot sticks (is that a Portland thing?) and 2 celery sticks and really watery blue cheese - hello, where's the cheese?? The wings were not so great. Fire on the Mountain and Buffalo Wild Wings are better. The pretzel was okay, but I really liked the beer cheese sauce! I'll have to try the tater tots or fries with that yummy sauce - or if they make a similar flavored soup, that'd be cool. The hubs had meatloaf (not on the HH menu - regular entree). I think he liked it.\\n\\nWe split the peanut butter mud pie for dessert. It came with whipped cream, a chocolate sauce drizzle and... cinnamon sprinkle for garnish. The cinnamon really ruined it for me. It's chocolate ice cream on a peanut butter pie... why did you need cinnamon?? It could have been a really good dessert, but that cinnamon smell really detracted from the yummy flavors of the pie. Sad.\\n\\nOverall, the food was a disappointment for me, but the beer makes me a fan of the place. Also, the bartender was super nice - greeted us right away and asked if we wanted to start a tab. I didn't feel judged or condescended to, like I usually do at Portland-area bars. (Although, maybe ordering beer right off the bat helps?) I felt bad because it seemed like the bartender was taking car of the whole den area while other servers were just walking through or chit-chatting with friends. Maybe the patio was busy. The food was brought down by a couple of different servers, though.\\n\\nIt was a good place to escape the 100+ degree weather. We'll be back since they don't retail their Razberry Wheat elsewhere! Also, I'll maybe try the mixed drinks once berry season is over. \\n\\nP.S. We saw David Wu in the parking lot when we were leaving and he smiled at me!

I mean, for one, you gotta eat. You may not necessarily think that a restaurant that offers such a spectacular view of the city and elegance would be so chill. Rolled in early evening, during HH when the crowd was barely starting to come in. Walked right in very casual clothing and no weird looks or 'tudes were exchanged by anyone there.  Let me add though, by the end of the night, there was more of a nicely dressed up crowd that were there to dine, so a more polished look would be more appropriate for dinner. I'm assuming that most of the people there at that time just came off from work as there were suits that were randomly scattered around the place.\\n\\nLucked out and got one of the best seats in the house. Typically, I'd say the bar..but in this case, unless you're only there for the drinks and are locals, make sure you get a booth by the window. It's an absolute must to get the most out of your experience here. Additionally, scored on that fantastic view with no wait; talk about good timing! The night was already off to an awesome start overlooking this beautiful city.\\n\\nNow to the food...\\n\\nShort ribs: OMG, fall off the bone good! Great balance of sweet and tangy and just the right amount of it, too. I'd say to get these HH or not. It was so good that a second order was put in.\\n\\nSalmon cakes: The no breading filler kind, just like how I like 'em. Delicate, flaky and delicious.\\n\\nKung pao calamari: Wasn't quite a fan as most people seem to be over this. Not that it wasn't prepared right, but it's not how I personally like my calamaris. Seemed to be a little too glazed with sauce for my taste.\\n\\nBrownie sundae: Exactly what you would think, want, hoped for in a brownie sundae dessert. Chocolaty goodness would be an understatement. \\n\\nWine: Which one...I do not recall but darn good and it paired perfectly with everything. \\n\\nThe service was friendly and on point as well. No problems there.\\n\\nThis was definitely a highlight of my visit and can not say enough great things.

Every item was delectable. It's not a traditional board with lots of salamis, but it was deeeelicious! For our entrees I got the lobster stuffed chicken and my friend got the fish of the day. (I think it was trout or cod?) His fish was perfectly cooked with home made gnocchi. My chicken was incredible as well, and yes, lobster stuffed chicken was as rich as you think it would be. I don't regret it though and actually felt perfectly full at the end of our meal. We didn't order dessert but we got the cutest little macaroons with our cheque.\\n\\nI almost forgot to mention the tea--the tea itself was just fine, but the teacup was this beautiful dainty floral cup. You could tell that they thought out the details to the place because it showed every step of the way. \\n\\nOur total was about $110 for two people with a cup of tea, glass of wine, 2 entrees and a shared appetizer. It's not bad but it's a bit on the pricey side--I'd say it's perfect for a nice date night or a mini occasion. I liked it so much that I might go back again this weekend.

The lemonade one is especially fantastic. \\n\\nThe nachos are a pretty good drunk snack food but the more toppings you add they can get quite expensive fast. Good drinking food always comes at a price! The crowd is an interesting group of Opera rejects and random midtown riff-raff. I kept to my own party minus a small conversation in Korean that involved sarang hae (part of my limited Korean) so mingle at your own risk. \\n\\nI have noticed some negative reviews here and I think the real story must be who your server is. I happen to fall in love with both of them (perhaps it was my excessive drinking) by the end of each night with them.

However, the food was just...meh.\\n\\nThe guacamole cart is a cute idea, and I've seen it done before.  But the amount of guac and the flavor just wasn't great.

The salsa was so thin it didn't even try to make friends with the chips, and frankly I don't blame it.  The chips were hard and with little flavor.  I would have ignored the chips too if I'd been the salsa.\\n\\nI started off with a dirty martini.  That was a nice beverage for a Friday night pre-concert activity.  Why they thought it was worth $8 is beyond me, but it didn't stop me from having a second one (although I didn't know it was that much when I ordered the second one.  Having had the first one already, I was already lubricated enough to not care.)\\n\\nI ordered the fried oyster tacos with honey habanero aioli.  Now those were something to write home about.  Thoroughly enjoyed them.  Lots of delicate flavors and textures, especially the crunch of the lightly battered oysters.  I'd come back for those tacos.  The beans and rice accompanying them however probably lived in the same bland neighborhood as the chips and salsa.  I thought the charro beans with bacon would be decadent and instead they were boring, predictable and needed to simmer a few more hours.  I had also imagined the rice would have been seasoned.  Silly me.\\n\\nThe drink special was a colada boasting toasted coconut as a garnish.  I was disappointed with the drink.  It seemed watered down, and lacked any flavor to speak of.  I think it had to do with their choice of preparation - it was on ice and not a blended/frozen drink.  It came across as watered down.  (It was after this that I had my second martini.  Stick with what ya know, right?) I didn't get any stinkin' coconut either.  Lucky for them I'm a happy drinker.  \\n\\nService was on the slow side at times, but they accommodated a semi-late arrival to our party very well and was very, very quick to get her drink to her.

I've already realized that I'm a bit of a food snob, but I think that if you're paying almost $20 for chicken, it should be flavorful and moist throughout and not just on the surface.

(Except for the fried pickles, those will always hold a special place in my heart. *sigh*)\\nAnyway, I went to try American Craft with my bf, who had already been there a few times.  I was happy to see that they kept the chalk board beer \\"menus\\" on the walls but updated the decor with damask style wall paper and some cool Gothic inspired decorations. (I am pretty sure there is a church pew on the wall too..) I am, however still annoyed at how FREAKING LOUD it is! I am not an 80 year old woman being a wuss, I am young and used to being in loud places, but something about the deafening echo while I am trying to have a nice meal just drives me nuts. So, I still maintain that as Roadhouse was not a good date place neither is American Craft. Unless you like relying on facial expressions to carry your way through conversation.  Nothing like having to yell \\"SO WHAT KIND OF WORK DO YOU DO?\\" to really set the mood.\\nI was impressed with the menu, not a huge selection, but you can tell the chefs have really taken the time to create something special and unique in all of their dishes.\\n\\nBeer: Solid beer selection. Please do not try to order a bud light. Branch out a little. Ask your server for suggestions if you are not sure.

Honestly some of the best mussels we have had.

As I had a more traditional Mexican lunch that day, I ordered the Baja Taquitos (fried bay scallops with slaw served with tortillas) and the Ensalada de Espinacas (spinach salad).  The portions on both were quite plentiful, and I would order the spinach salad again.  The scallops were not very good, but the tortillas were awesome.  The chips and salsa that came to the table were pretty bad - watery salsa with too much Tabasco flavor and chips right out of a bag.  \\nMy partners had the beef fajitas (\\"not great, they had some funky seasoning\\") and the Chile Relleno del Mar (\\"pretty good\\").

I was going to have the Ahi in an Asian style preparation but our waiter told me Alaskan Halibut was in season and I went with that. I was so glad I did. I had it grilled. It was sweet and flaky but still moist. The fish needed very little in the way of seasoning as it was clearly fresh and well prepared. I enjoyed every mouthful. My husband had the grouper wrapped in blue crab. To me, it was way too rich and all the bells and whistles are not necessary when the base fish is great. I think he enjoyed it though so to each his/her own. To start we had the calamari and 12 oysters for the table (my mom and son were also there) these were delicious too.

That being said, I think you can can be very satisfied ordering any of their biscuit sandos, though they do have fascinating versions such as the very southern Wedgie (complete with fried green tomato), the BBQ (with pulled pork and BBQ sauce), and a hearty steak club (with seared flank steak and blue cheese)\\n\\nFor two hungry people, we split one order of the Reggie Deluxe ($9) and one order of the plain Biscuits & Gravy ($5.50), which turned out to be the perfection amount--we got to indulge a bit in an epic brunch concoction while enjoying the essence of their perfected biscuits & gravy. I particularly liked the sprinkle of paprika and garnish of chopped chives.\\n\\nTips:\\n*They share a space with a pizza place, which can be a bit confusing. Make sure you order at the right storefront.\\n*It's crowded!!! Strongly recommend coming at opening or near closing. Seating is quite limited in the small space, with a handful of bar seating along the sides and a communal table.\\n*Easy street parking (non-metered).\\n*Conversation starter: The owners are from North Carolina and started Pine State because they missed Southern home cooking.\\n\\nWelp, looks like I've sold my soul to Pine State ¬Ø\\\\_(ÔøΩ?_/¬Ø"},{"name":"Magnolia Cafe South","address":"1920 S Congress Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"No wait, it was packed which is always a good sign :-) server knew menu well, we all wanted breakfast, which they serve all day :-) they only have pork sausage options which unfortunately limited the options that We could order since we don't eat pork.

They were delicious, and reminded me of a Banh Mi, but without the pickled veggies cutting through, it was definitely the star of tonight.\\n\\nFor entrees we got mapu tofu with minced beef and this spicy pork belly.\\n\\nFirst off, both these dishes could have been spicier. The mapu tofu had a standard szechuan spice that we expected, but the pork belly was lacking of all spiciness. The mapu tofu was classic, solid all-around, no complaints from any of us, although if we were coming back probably wouldn't get it again. The pork belly definitely took us back, this was a beautiful preparation of pork belly, and if we came back would definitely get this again.\\n\\nOverall, our total was about $84+tip for three people, which included two drinks and some house fried rice for the table.

I've eaten at quite a few cajun and creole restaurants in Louisiana, and the food here just didn't taste right in comparison.  It is pretty good on its own, but the fact is you expect a certain flavor when ordering the traditional dishes.  I had the crawfish etouffee and my son had the jambalaya; both were not the best that I had.  Daughter had a ham Po' Boy which was fresh and tasty (although I don't have as much experience with those - essentially a sandwich.)  They had Louisiana favorites Abita Purple Haze and Turbo Dog on tap served in a cold chalice.   No complaints with those, but I would like to have seen a better and more innovative beer selection.  We had the bread pudding for dessert, and it was tasty.  The brandy sauce gave it a nice kick.\\n\\nYou don't get much with your meal, so I ordered a salad, the Bienville for $9.  I expected a pretty big one at that price, but what came out is about what you would expect for $5.  Value-wise, the place is a bit expensive.  \\n\\nThe atmosphere inside is raucous. There is music and TVs in the bar (which I could not hear.)  On this Saturday night, we had a hard time carrying on a conversation because of the noise.  Do you know how every once in a while a server in a restaurant will drop a tray of dishes making an awful crash?  This happened three times the same night in Tibby's when we were there!

A fancy taco bar?  Who wouldn't be interested?  The roomie and I decided to go for a later dinner.  Our server was very friendly and sincere.  We ordered the chips, guacamole and salsa and for $5 the portions were pretty small.  I'm not a fat ass but i expect a decent portion.  It could be the presentation though as well.  The guacamole was bland and flavorless and my roomie referred to the salsa as \\"marinara\\".  I think it was because it seemed heavy on garlic.  It wasn't bad and she meant it not as an insult because she couldn't stop eating it.  I ended up going with ala carte 3 tacos with rice and barracho beans.  I got the coffee marinated ribeye taco, the tilapia taco and roasted chicken taco.  The coffee marinated ribeye is served with onion, asadero cheese and chipotle horseradish aioli.  You'd think with the aioli it'd have some heat but it was very minor.  The steak was pretty tough too.  The tilapia taco had a haberno aioli and a little pico i believe.  The portion of fish was pretty small and i guess the strongest flavor was the fish.  The roasted chicken had an avocado sauce, cheese and onions.  It was pretty good.  All in all, the food was good.  Did it knock my socks off?  Not quite.  $12-16 for three tacos, rice and beans?  I think i'd rather go somewhere else.

It contained a generous portion of hummus, felafel, salad, rice, pita bread, some deep fried spinach thing, and I added a side of roasted pepper and feta spread for the pit bread, which is delicious.

It used to be that one or two of the St. Louis extra \\"tender\\" ribs might be chewy and taste like a dry pork chop -- now, it's more like half of a rack most of the time.\\n\\nBut what really has made my decision to stop bothering with Redbones is their absolute ineptitude when it comes to filling orders correctly, particularly for take-out or delivery.  Out of well over two dozen such orders I've placed over the years, I think I've only actually received the meal I've ordered twice.  Most of the time it's little things.  For example, I've received black-eyed peas at least three or four times in place of the standard beans to go with 'slaw in their standard dinners -- one would think that they would be used to filling orders with beans and slaw.  As someone who doesn't particularly like black-eyed peas, this is mildly annoying.\\n\\nOr they forget the cornbread.  Or they forget the sauce.  Or they only include sides for one entree when two or three were ordered.  (Of course, nowadays when their sides appear to have shrunk significantly sometimes in take-out orders, perhaps the small container is meant to serve three.)\\n\\nBut a lot of times it's major things -- I often order a full rack of St. Louis ribs from the bulk take-out section (a much better deal than the dinner, since you get twice as many ribs for a dollar or two more, and given the size of the sides, they aren't worth it).  But I've received half a rack or the wrong kind of ribs... and once I even just got a single Texas beef rib instead of an entire rack of pork ribs.  I've ordered the \\"easy-order dinner for 4\\" a number of times, and always get the jerk chicken option instead of the regular roasted chicken -- it took me until the 4th time ordering it to actually get a jerk chicken... until then, I thought their \\"jerk chicken\\" spice was just really mild.\\n\\nTo their credit, when I've called up to complain about a major mix-up, the driver is usually there within 15 minutes with the correct stuff, but I assume that's more because I usually tip the driver at least 20%, rather than Redbones' eagerness to correct my order.\\n\\nThe frequency of the mix-ups is astonishing in take-out and delivery orders, and given the premium prices I'm paying for many menu items, I'm just tired of dealing with it, particularly now that the food is mediocre or worse most of the time.\\n\\nEating there is just as bad.  It's often loud, and service is generally mediocre, particularly on busy weekend nights.  I've even been lied to by waitstaff who gave me incorrect orders, telling me that the food I had was what I ordered when it actually wasn't (I let it slide once or twice, but one time it required a manager to admit that I wasn't actually served what I had ordered).\\n\\nI feel strange even writing this review, since it probably sounds like I'm a crazy person to have so many screwed up orders, but I don't have this problem with any other restaurant.\\n\\nSo, I'm just going to stop ordering.  I do like some of their items (some ribs on good days, brisket on an occasional good day, sausage is generally good, BBQ beef is often okay), but I just can't see putting out the money to get unreliable food that is often not what I ordered.\\n\\nGoodbye, Redbones.

This evening I noticed a sign outside promoting happy hour, including lasagna and salad for $5 each. I went in and sat at the bar. The place was nearly empty, and nobody came to take my order for several minutes. I tried ordering a beer. They had none on tap, despite the taps sitting in front of me. So I settled for a can, and ordered the lasagna and salad. They were OK, although the lasagna is kind of a decadent death-by-lasagna thing that is closer to hamburger stew bubbling in an oily cheese sauce. When the bill came, I pointed out that nothing rang up at the prices on the sign outside -- they were about double. The waitress blamed it on the computer and said she would fix it. Looking at the happy hour menu, I mentioned to her that the prices on the menu (which had a two-tiered structure that was not explained -- perhaps happy hour vs. normal pricing) also were higher in both cases than the prices on the sign outside. She said she was aware of that, but that she had been instructed not to charge the prices advertised on the sign outside. I was perplexed, and asked if she meant that they had a policy of false advertising. She lowered her voice and said something about how she was not arguing with me and was aware of the issue but had been told not to honor the pricing promoted on the sign. When I asked who the owner was, thinking I might chat with him about it, she lowered her voice again and said it was someone who just walked by, but that it wasn't exactly his fault somehow, as if there were an internal argument between the owner and a manager or something. It was so odd!

We sat on their patio that Sunday morning, and there was a strong, stiff breeze and plenty of shade that kept us cool even though the heat and humidity had already started making an unwelcome appearance.\\n\\nAs we toasted ourselves with our mimosas for being so fancy, some musicians were setting up in the corner. K remarked that it felt a bit like Miami. The palm trees across the street certainly added to that illusion. Our waitress brought out some chips and salsa. The chips looked and tasted like they were made there in the restaurant; they were the thick, fried corn tortilla kind.  K had some guacamole for her app and I got the roasted chicken quesadilla. The quesadilla was on the smaller side, probably because it was Restaurant Week, and I'm pretty sure it didn't have any chicken in it. But it was still good. And I was hungry.\\n\\nFor our entrees, K had ordered the migas, and I had the smoked salmon plate. Good thing it wasn't a date, because I'm sure my breath smelled awesome after that. Both items were ok, not really outstanding in a good or bad way.\\n\\nThe reason I gave Garrido's 4 stars instead of 3, though, is because of their desserts.

It's just your outstandingly healthy, albeit expensive lunch option. You can't go wrong with any of the sandwiches. My favorite lunch menu is the stuffed bread everyday specials. I find those to be the best deal given the large portion and the salad side that comes with it. The stuffed bread is delicious by itself. \\n\\nNow for the dessert, this is where I really consider myself an expert when it comes to Flour. Their bread puddings are to die for amazing. The mixed berry bread pudding was amazing, but recently they have introduced a new sticky bread pudding, and that was the best dessert I have had in ages! It was just that delicious. I had originally intended to eat only half of it (and usually I have extremely good self control), but I simply could not stop myself from taking another bit. You MUST try it, if it is available (and it's not there everyday). \\n\\nFor those who want something less calorie intense than the bread pudding, I recommend their coffee cake, the banana bread, and vegan banana bread muffin. Those have excellent texture and the banana flavor really comes through (for the bread and muffin).\\n\\nWhen I want just a quick fix, I opt for the raisin bread loaf (which is surprisingly really filling and a good deal at ~$1) or the almond macaroon. The almond macaroon is delicious and the texture of it is made just right - soft with great almond taste to it."},{"name":"The Bistro On Park Avenue","address":"348 N Park Ave","city":"Winter Park","stars":"3","text":"My boyfriend never makes a reservation for anything and was so excited that he reserved us a table in the \\"hidden garden\\" for a romantic Valentine's Day brunch.

When we inquired about a table in that area we were rudely dismissed by the gentleman at the door (who ended up being one of the owners) and informed that these tables had been booked for months.

Our first drinks were good- I had the Bubbletini and K had the Pink Panther. Our water was always filled. The waiter, who looked like Carson from Queer Eye for the Straight Guy, was rather accommodating. But he had an odd habit on standing behind either K or I, hovering quietly, until the point where we would sort get that feeling like someone is watching you over your shoulder. The flavor of the food was very intense. My mini cheeseburger had a strong peppery taste, like the chef had accidentally spilled the entire pepper shaker into the meat. It also came complete with ketchup AND mustard on it, which the menu said nothing about. I HATE mustard on burgers- I don't understand it, or think it tastes good. And this was not McDonalds, but a nice restaurant. I feel like the menu should warn that it comes with both. If I'm paying that much for a small burger, I want to know what goes on it. \\n\\nK's tuna burger was good (better than the last time she was there). She also had a veggie burger, which tasted way better than anything Morningstar Farms puts out. Our Gingery Chicken Satay did not arrive with the burgers. We had to remind the staff that we'd ordered it. And it was Gingery! The flavor of Gingery Chicken Satay was hijacked by the ginger. So intense was the ginger that it needed to be dunked into lots of peanut sauce to mask that overpowering root flavor present in the dish. \\n\\nOur waiter was very accommodating when I didn't like my second drink, the Toasted Coconut (waaaay too sweet). We would've preferred that our old glasses be removed from the table, as they left us little room for much else.\\n\\nI don't think I'll be returning there for food anytime soon.\\n\\nAs for teh bar area- a suggestion- put coat hooks underneath the bar so patrons have someplace to rest their jackets and bags."},{"name":"Neptune Oyster","address":"63 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Simply one of the best seafood restaurants that I've ever been to.

It was not a big deal, but I thought that I should stop drinking it and switch to water instead as we were there for a friend's birthday celebration.  My husband alerted the waiter, who apologized and said that it will be taken off the bill.  A short time later, the manager came over and apologized and insisted that he compensate us with dessert.  I'm sure that they made every attempt in making sure that there was no alcohol in my drink, but even a trace of it can make me sick.

I still love this restaurant because of the location, the gorgeous building and the very good food. However, I am seeing some of the cracks in the Narcoossee's foundation and better understand the reasons why some people dislike this restaurant so strongly. If I had to summarize my issues with Narcoossee's, I would put it like this - the service basically stinks, and the food is unbelievably overpriced. \\n\\nAs far as service is concerned, each of the three times we have visited, we have had servers who pretty much could not care any less about us or our experience at this restaurant. And this in three separate visits over the course of a year-and-a-half. The servers here - at least the ones we've had - seem either really unhappy or simply indifferent. It's such a shame. They want to charge us $3 for a glow cube for our child, and when I asked the server if the bartender could make me a nice non-alcoholic cocktail with club soda and a splash of something fruity, he acted like it was a huge hassle. For a signature restaurant that charges these prices, whipping up a special cocktail for a guest should be a pleasure!\\n\\nAs far as the food is concerned, it is delicious. Consistently one of the best meals I have when I am on Disney property, and on par with great restaurants that aren't on property (which is saying a lot for Disney). With that said, the prices! Oh my goodness, they are insane. Example - a Maine lobster is a whopping $72. Yup, you read that right. I went to college in Maine, and I could buy a Maine lobster there for around $5. Of course, I expect some price inflation due to the fact that they have to ship the lobsters from Maine to Florida, prepare them and serve them with other items, but still - that's a big up-charge. There are no entrees below around $35, and most are in the $40-$50 range. When you add an average $14 salad or appetizer and an average $10 dessert, plus drinks, you are looking at hundreds of dollars for one meal.\\n\\nThis is why, each time I visit, I order whatever salad is in season, plus the shrimp with grits appetizer for my entree. These items are consistently delicious, and I pay a little over $30 for both. My husband ordered the lobster mac 'n cheese side as his entree plus a salad, and he too paid a little over $30 total for his meal. And the kids' meals are reasonable, and large enough to split in half for two young children who don't eat a lot of food in one sitting.\\n\\nMaybe this is why we have consistently found the service to be so lacking here - perhaps they don't appreciate that we aren't \\"big spenders\\" here. We definitely got an attitude from our server this time when he realized that we weren't ordering bottles of wine, expensive entrees and asked to split our kids' meal. But we regularly visit and enjoy this restaurant and spend north of $100 each time, even with our selective spending. It would be so nice to be able to come to this restaurant and be treated with appreciation and care regardless of what we order.\\n\\nManagement - work on this! You have to cater to and appreciate all of your guests.

I'll have to save my friend-just-had-a-heart-transplant-so-she-can't-stand-around [true] story for another time. The servers repeatedly tell you that the food is served family-style. I LOVE tapas and really enjoy this approach to eating, but I will say, I'm not totally convinced it translates to brunch or this particular menu. I mean, how is ONE donut hole family style?  And if a plate comes with one poached egg on top, how do you split that?  And why do some plates come accessorized for all the world as an individual serving, with greens and a piece of toast on the side?  That being said, the food was delicious and definitely my style creatively and flavor-profile wise. Go, relax, take your time, and enjoy exploring the menu. \\n\\nMinus one star for making it difficult to share with my vegetarian, non-spicy eating friend, and for the weird tip line on the bill, where you expect me to decide how much tip goes to servers and how much to the kitchen. If you can't figure it out, how am I supposed to?"},{"name":"Tin Lizzy's Cantina","address":"77 12th St NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"yay! tin lizzy's in midtown is now open!

Luke's Lobster is definitely a place to check out for tourists and locals who love lobster rolls and seafood.\\n\\nI like how restaurant is set up like a fast food restaurant. You go up to the counter and order your food and grab it yourself once it is prepared. This minimizes the cost and allows customers to get delicious and fresh seafood at an affordable cost. Luke's Lobster features Maine lobsters and seafood from sustainable fisheries. It is good to know where my food comes from! \\n\\nI tried the Taste of Maine, which includes 3 half rolls of lobster, crab, and shrimp, 2 crab claws, and a side of chips or cole slaw, and a drink. I like how they don't cover up the seafood with mayo and celery and other random things like at other restaurants so you actually taste the actual freshness of the seafood. The seafood is served with a toasted New England butter bun and it is topped with their \\"secret\\" spices. The cole slaw was a little bit of a disappointment. It was bland. It would be better if there were more acidity, salt, pepper, and mayo... basically a little more of everything that goes in a cole slaw. But I got creative and added Sriracha to my cole slaw and that solved the problem! The portion sizes were a little small compared to one of my favorite lobster roll places in Boston, Pauli's, but Luke's is good in their own ways. \\n\\nI also tried their seasonal item on the menu, the Tail and Kale, which is a salad with lobster tail! The salad comes with kale, quinoa, chickpeas, pickled onions, and of course, lobster! What a great protein to have with my salad. The salad was decent. the pickled onion was too sour, I am salivating as I am typing this review and thinking about the onions on my salad. The dressing could also use a little more sugar and sweetness. Everything was too acidic! \\n\\nThe clam chowder was good and filled with clams. However, it was a little too salty for my liking. It was too much sodium for my poor kidneys to handle. \\n\\nI love the concept of sustainability and fresh seafood, I just wish they paid more care on the seasoning of the food. But this is still a great spot for fresh seafood when you are in Back Bay and you are looking to spend $15-$25 per person versus $30-$40 per person at other restaurants around the area."},{"name":"Portland City Grill","address":"111 SW 5th Ave, Fl 30","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Great place great view great service great food ok prices.

We had some calamari that was sauteed in some kind of tomato type juice/sauce it was not thick enough to be sauce, but not watery enough to be juice if that makes sense. I had never had calamari done this way. I've only had fried calamari with an array of sauces but this one topped them all.  There were olives cut up and some kind of green in the sauce as well. It was very tasty.\\n\\nFor my main course I had the Georges Bank Scallops with Duck Confit and Pear Anjou and brussel sprouts. It was awesome. I suck at cooking scallops at home. Some things I leave to the professionals. Scallops is one of them. Excellent job! My friend had the lobster roll with butter. I have to be honest. I love lobsters and specifically lobster rolls but the only time I've ever seen them with butter instead of mayonnaise, was at the Big E in Springfield, MA and it was so gross and like dried out, but I should have relalized that I was at Neptune Oyster and it wasn't going to get much fresher and better than that. I checked out my friend's, she offered a bite, but I've been losing weight, so I was trying to stay away from all that butter. Plus every time I have had a brioche roll, its been dry and not the way I am used to having a lobster roll like at Kelly's Roast Beef where they butter and toast the roll.

Weekdays from 4-7pm you can get $4 beer/wine/specialty cocktails and $5 small plates from a selected list. They had a great assortment of beverages, and about 11 or 12  small plates to choose from. My friends and I had a few different plates and drinks, so of what I was able to try, here are the highlights:\\n\\nSmall Plates:\\n+ Aguacate Rellenos con Queso- avocado stuffed with goat cheese, with a sun-dried tomato drizzle. It was buttery smooth, and let's be honest- goat cheese makes everything better!\\n+ Costillas -- BRAISED SHORT RIBS, omg. So tender and juicy, and the sauce they were in was a mushroom/blue cheese marsala of sorts. It was a bit rich, but THAT SAUCE. I wish I had a hunk of bread to soak it up. I restrained myself from tipping up the bowl to my mouth to drink it straight. \\n- The Patatas Bravas were decent, but essentially just a bunch of potato hunks with a tomato sauce. You do get a pretty good quantity of food for the price though. The calamari was pretty standard. \\n\\nThe drink list had a great selection of beer and wine, and about 10 drinks that covered your basic types of liquor. I had a highball, which was made with ginger beer. I also had their manhattan, which was served up in a martini glass. Our bartender was very friendly and helpful, and on top of everything without being overbearing. I peeked in at the patio, and people are spot on with their reviews- it looked completely enchanting. I would love to come back here for a special occasion and check out their paella. Their happy hour is a great way to sample what they have to offer without breaking the bank."},{"name":"Angelina's Pizza","address":"1437 Hancock St","city":"Quincy","stars":"3.5","text":"Nicest folks in Quincy Center.

We thought we were in luck! We got a drink at the upstairs bar and hung out for a little bit until we decided to head downstairs where the DJ was playing. It was about 10:30 and we ended up being stuck in line until 12:10am. It was extremely upsetting to have to wait in line INSIDE the bar to get into an event we already thought we paid for and were granted admittance to when we got in from outside. Also, last call was at 1:00am. Woohoo, we had 50 minutes to spend downstairs, and half of it was at the coat check.\\n\\nI think that the way they organized this event was completely unfair. We should have been allowed to go downstairs. There was only a specific amount of people going to this event in the first place, if there wasn't enough room they should have stated that the tickets were sold-out.\\n\\nWe spent the countdown standing in line. This has got to be the worst New Year's of my life. Clery's, you let me down. When I spent the $50 I realized it was only for entrance of the bar, but little did I know, it didn't even mean entrance, it just meant to wait around inside in a line instead of outside in the cold. \\n\\nHuge disappointment. I do not recommend this place for anybody on New Years Eve. Don't waste your time or your money. They need to figure out how to run an event successfully first before they do this again. Customer satisfaction is what keeps these businesses alive; and to treat all of your customers that way on such a special night of the year is coldhearted.\\n\\nGoodbye Clery's."},{"name":"Lodge at Cascade Brewing","address":"7424 SW Beaverton Hillsdale Hwy","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"This place *could* be amazing.

I would have sent it back.  The cook just must not have seen the black crispy edges, right?  We both agreed the food was a solid five stars, but the missteps drop it a star, which then started the conversation about whether or not we should have said something and given them a chance to correct it, but we were hungry and ate it anyway.  \\n\\nService is delightful.  The ladies working that day made sure our glasses and coffee mugs weren't empty at any time.   The atmosphere is shabby bohemian mismatched cool.\\n\\nWe even bought a bottle of the Aardvark hot sauce.  It was yummy.\\n\\nIt's a small place, so I imagine the wait can be long if you don't go during a weekday or later in the morning.

The johnny cake is such an interesting dish, a mix of sweet and salty.  They make a pancake and drizzle it with lots of butter and something sweet--I'm guessing honey, maybe.  Then they put a little tower of smoked trout in the middle with a dab of creme fraiche and caviar on top.  \\n\\nMy only complaint is the size of the place and the fact that you share a table with people you don't know and it's hard to hear your companion across the table from you."},{"name":"Darwin's","address":"1629 Cambridge St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"Sandwiches are great, but the service is not.

It is fairly new and located right outside Harvard Square in Cambridge and boasts using \\"fresh, local, organic\\" ingredients.  Although I've only ever enjoyed Violette Bakery at their basement level cafe, they also are seen at farmer's markets around the area.  Like some of the other allergy friendly bakeries, they also offer many dairy free and vegan desserts and baked goods as well.  They also do not use refined sugars in any of their items! This place is definitely safe for the most sensitive of celiacs and gluten intolerances.\\nOne of my favorite things about Violette Bakery is their variety of goods and treats.  Although they have many chocolaty and rich desserts (like their locally famous cakerons and cupcakes), many of their items are lighter treats.  If you like fruit flavors, try the orange almond cake, the lemon-blueberry almond cake (personal favorite!), or the berry crumb bars.  If you're in the mood for something more savory, they offer empanadas (tasted great when I heated it up later in the day), quiche, and soups.\\nThey also have a wide variety of breads available which seemed to be made with a blend of gluten free flours. I especially loved the vegan english muffins which come in a 4 pack that I used throughout the week.  I noticed that the bakery offers cooking classes you can sign up for- one of them being a milling and mixing gluten free grains class.  Although I have never tried a class I would definitely be interested in learning how to mix different flour sources and utilize these baking strategies into some of my favorite recipes.\\nThey serve coffee with alternative milk choices which is always nice, even coconut milk! You can buy or order cakes for special occasions too. I could ramble on about Violette Bakery but really you should head down to Harvard Sq and help a local company out while enjoying some top-notch gluten free goodies!"},{"name":"Magnolia Cafe South","address":"1920 S Congress Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"This place is absolutely amazing!

First time with the family it was OK. We kept coming back because of the nearby location. But After about six meals I told my wife I was done with BJ's. The service is consistently clumsy and the dishes remind me of microwaved Swanson's or something equally bland. The crew exhibits little teamwork. For example, the food runner plopped our lunch on the table and looked bewildered when I ordered a glass of Zinfandel (Ravenswood is what they offer). Our original waitress showed up 10 minutes later with a container of white zinfandel. She failed to return before the well-intended manager asked the obligatory, \\"How is everything?\\" I mentioned the wine snafu and he trotted off, returning with the correct beverage. But he left empty glasses on the crowded table instead of clearing them. Simple story but it illuminates a typical experience. If the food were delicious I could overlook the stumbling staff.

The only thing odd in the noodles and fried rice was the accompaniment of a not very ripe, not good tomato. There was plenty of food besides this, so just pushed it off to the side.  Fried rice was very good, although the toddler had some trouble with the carrots - they were cut very large and were still a bit crunchy. \\n\\nThe spicy salad individual did not have as good of time as the rest of us.

I love that they give the chef free reign to serve whatever he pleases. Sure you have the staples: the cheesy migas, bacon, eggs, french toast with fresh whipped cream and waffles but you also have beef lasagna, enchiladas, stuffed peppers, tamales happily served up by the happy chef who insists you HAVE to try this whenever he drops it on the table. I'm not a huge fan of the staples (I think they're a little heavy) but I really enjoy the tasty Mexican foods served up on the side. I appreciate that little bit of variation and it makes me more excited to come back.\\n\\nTHE NIGHT TIME FOOD\\nI've been gluten free for awhile now and had all but given up on enjoying old greasy favorites until coming here. Their fry batter is AMAZING. It has a little bit of the distinct ricey-chewiness you expect from gluten free foods but I honestly prefer it to regular fry batter which is saying something. It's hot and bubbly and ample and amazing. I can't really describe it but if you've been gluten free for awhile too you'll understand when you taste it.\\n\\nThe chicken fingers are huge and amazing. The calamari actually tastes like calamari. The chicken fried steak (my pre-gf favorite food) satisfies and is served with a gravy that actually tastes and feels like gravy. I'm seriously impressed.\\n\\nTheir sandwiches and pizza are good but I feel like they pale in comparison to the more hearty entrees.\\n\\nTHE BAKED FOOD\\nCarrot cake, pecan pie, cupcakes, chocolate covered cheesecake, cookies, bread loaves all served up with barista-made coffee. I haven't tried much of this to be honest (always so full after the other stuff) but what I have tried has been okay to good. The cakes kind of have a dry, rice-y consistency and I honestly prefer the Betty Crocker GF boxed cakes because they're much more moist. The cheesecakes are quite delicious though and until I try more I'll withhold judgment.\\n\\nThe verdict? Try it. Especially the fried stuff.

One of the things that I adore about the place (besides the overall vibe and great service) is the locks and bagels. BEST IN TOWN!! Great price too! The locks always taste super fresh, and are always cut and prepared perfect. They taste great with the everything bagel and the lettuce and tomato they come with is always fresh as well. The capers are tasty too.They also have some crazy million layer dip or something which is to die for, I highly recommend both.\\nOne time I went in the wee hours of the mornings and it was pretty crowded. Our waitress was waiting on a super large party of rowdy drunk guys, a couple other tables, and us. She didn't seem to miss a beat. I think she may have thought she did though, because she apologized for not being more attentive. We assured her that she was doing a more than great job. Even though she was totally on top of her game, I appreciated that she took the time to stop by and apologize.\\nI've been to this place at noon on a Sunday, and even though the place was packed, and there was a long wait, once we got in there, the service was truly great!\\nI love this cafe.

His girlfriend's a vegetarian/part-time vegan so when I asked him what he wanted to do for his birthday the only word that he could get out was MEEAAAAAAAAATTTTTT.\\n\\nA guy who knows what he wants, super kudos to him because he picked the place too - so really, this review is thanks to him.\\n\\nWe got there, we settled in, and we enjoyed the quirky decor and the fact that there were actual bullet holes in the walls. The server told us the owner and his dad took the panels out and shot them through themselves - points for badassery right there.\\n\\nWe got one of the BBQ sharesies meals and I should have been rolled home. I stuffed my face with so much meat it's hard to remember it all. One thing that stood out (and not because it was better than the rest, but because it was the best of its kind I've ever had) was the fried chicken. A crispy fried chicken is a thing of beauty, but easier said than done. Sure, you could try and tell me that it ain't no thing, because KFC's got your back - but you'd be so very wrong and I'd probably want to hit you over the head with a bucket of the Colonel's best until your eyes bleed fryer oil. THIS fried chicken was incredible. They told me the secret is potato starch and buttermilk - but honestly I don't care what the secret is, I just care that it keeps coming out when I want it. It was SO crispy, yet so flavourful, with just the right amount of spices. The server told me you could have it 3 days later and it would still be crispy (think about that while you suck on your soggy KFC) and I believed him.\\n\\nAfter putting away the whole meat BBQ our server learned it was BFF's birthday. I must admit I'm always thrilled when they do this so I do always mention b-day's within earshot of servers when dining out just in case we'll get a pleasant surprise. THIS WAS ONE OF THOSE TIMES. But pleasant is the understatement of the year. They brought out a pecan pie. Sure, texas BBQ joint, you almost expect it. Here's what you don't expect: it was SMOKED. Holy shit my mouth was not ready for the epicness that fell into it when I took the second bite (c'mon, bday boy got first dibs, I'm not an animal). What was incredible was that the smoke flavour comes after. So you take a bite, its in your mouth, and right when you swallow you taste that smokiness. I don't know how the hell they do that - but I was so blown away that after gushing like a fangirl to the server, the chef came out to say hello and get some praise showers.\\n\\nHe was a cool dude with a beard and tattoos and he told us how they're the only BBQ joint in town with an actual wood smoker (other places are electric). They get that thing going first thing in the morning and work it all day like a sorority girl until it puts out just the right sizzle to make everything in there taste and smell divine.\\n\\n\\nNeedless to say, the whole experience was so wonderful and carnivorous that when another friend's Bday rolled around a month later I demanded while taking advantage of a cloud of drunk stupor that we go eat meat. So go we did. And meat we ate."},{"name":"The Thurman Cafe","address":"183 Thurman Ave","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"The Thurman Cafe is for real!!!

I had a glass of very decent merlot before dinner and my wife got the Masala Tea (chai) which was very rich, without being over spiced. My son got a HUGE bowl of mango ice cream for desert, with a wedge of fresh mango sticking out of it--his eyes popped out of his head, but he ate the whole thing.\\n\\nThe service--to counter some of the earlier reviews--was excellent. Our main waiter was quite sweet and chatted with us about the restaurant and Beverly, as we had told him we were relatively new in town.

Judging from the limited lunch options, I am going to assume that menus change seasonally. My Seafood Paella was... different. The presentation was nice and the dish savory, but it was most definitely on the salty and soury side. (I downed nearly a gallon of water within a few hours after lunch.) It may be due to my drenching the plate with lemon juice beforehand. Barcelona doesn't skimp on the seafood, and my other complaint about the dish was the tail-on shrimps. DanDan's fried calamari was exactly what I had expected (after having read the reviews here on Yelp.) Personally, I thought the calamari was fried to perfection, but DanDan will tell you differently. I wasn't a fan of the 'spicy mint dipping sauce' which in actuality is your typical vinaigrette, but I did like the chipotle mayo which had a brief kick of spiciness. I didn't get to try SASarah's Spice Crusted Salmon Salad although I was told it lacked salad dressing.

Anyway, the clientele aren't obnoxious, and it still caters to the bike messenger and local townie drinkers, too.\\n    The place consists of a small dining room and average sized bar upstairs, and a smaller bar and more tables in the basement. The basement is windowless, cool in temperature and has wonderful cartoonish murals all over the walls depicting everything from dog skeletons to aliens.\\n     Redbones has 20 beers on tap (they change depending on what comes in) and a friendly, knowledge staff that can tell you about each one (Heidi and Joel are two of my favorite bartenders around Boston, so tip well if you see 'em!).

It was plentiful, well prepared and the price directly inline with what you'd expect to pay. The Pork Schnitzel with eggs, ham, havarit and mustard braided cabbage is a must try if your undecided.

Opinions may be tainted by lack of barbecue in the frozen tundra.  \\n\\nAmbiance:  There are 3 areas to sit in - the upstairs bar, the upstairs dining room, and the downstairs.  I much prefer the downstairs.  It's dark, loud, and has some crazy s*** painted on the walls, none of which are detractors for me.  The upstairs is brighter, with BBQ memorabilia and pictures all over the walls - looks like what I always thought a BBQ place would look like (see above warning).  Not a great date spot, but then again, when was eating meat straight off the bones with your hands ever great for dates?  I go here with friends for beer and meat, especially warming on cold nights.  \\n\\nFood: Again, see above warning.  The food here is awesome.  Several choices for ribs let you tailor your experience to your tastes, and the catfish rocked me.  Beware the Jerk!  I've had friends end the night in tears from it despite the waitstaff's and my warnings.  Now, I may be from the midwest, but Habanaro peppers make me drool with anticipated tastiness; however, this spice-bomb from lower Hades made my mouth plain hurt.  Don't say I didn't warn you!  The max n' cheese is damn good, and the corn bread... well, I love the corn bread.  Beer selection is excellent - microbrews from local and far-flung breweries paired with a tasty pulled pork sammich make for a good night.  The selection changes often, so come back!\\n\\nService: Waitstaff is attentive and friendly.  Whenever my beer nears the bottom quarter of the glass, they ask me if I want another - which definitely isn't a bad thing.  Quit trying to get me shmammied, Redbones, I love you anyway!  On a recent visit, we asked for more cornbread 3 times, and they always brought it quickly and with a smile - no extra charge!  One thing I've always been mystified with is that they don't seat your party unless everyone is there - this is something I've always hated, and will hate until the day I die.  Bartenders are great, ready and able to explain any of their selections to you.  Sitting at the bar and eating some brisket is always great.\\n\\nPrice: Beers are $5+ unless you buy the cheapo stuff - I've never felt ripped off for drinks.  Food is decently priced - big portions ensure you never leave hungry, but its not super cheap.  Totally worth it, I say.\\n\\nBottom line: Great place, fun atmosphere, good food, good beer.

Don't come here if you're trying to get a 'bargain' - lobster is just overall expensive no matter where you buy it.\\n\\nI bought the mac and cheese lobster thinking the portion would be a bit bigger, but I think they wanted to showcase that they put a decent amount of lobster in the mac and cheese.

A lot of places leave you still hungry after eating a lobster roll, but I can tell you that is not the case here. The lobster roll and the generous portion of fries are more than enough. The best lobster roll I have had? That is questionable and that is why I give it 4 stars. I have had some very good lobster rolls and I didn't feel like this was anything too different or special to set it apart from others.

I had read other Yelp reviews so was completely aware it may be a long wait. As luck would have it, our flight landed early in Boston and we were done walking around the area and getting hungry for lunch around 10:45am (we had woken up at 3:30am for our flight!). We headed over to Neptune and arrived around 11am and the line was partially down the block (end of the line at the pet store). Others in line said from this spot it's usually at least an hour wait, and we likely wouldn't make the 1st \\"seating of the day\\" when they opened at 11:30. Somehow we managed to be the last 2 sat in the first seating at opening and the place totally lived up to the hype. BEST LOBSTER ROLL. And we've had them in Maine as well (so we're no lobster roll newbies). The hot is the way to go. We ordered 2 rolls and 12 oysters. Definitely on the pricier side at $31 a roll BUT the stands in Quincey Market sell them for $20ish so this was definitely worth it. Our server was great and overall experience was awesome. I can see how people would be frustrated at a long wait time, but just know that going in and realize if you aren't in line before it opens plan to \\"check in\\" 2 hours before you want to eat and get your name on the list. One last thing, the guy at the door was a saint. We overheard him basically on repeat telling people it was a 2-3 hour wait and he had to keep explaining to people that even though there's no line at the door right now, there is a wait list.

Just a little inconsistency I found too be a little weird. The fried were top notch as well.\\n\\nThere are only about 35 seats here. And by noon, I overheard one of the waitresses saying that there was already over an hour long wait. So plan accordingly. They're this popular for a reason, that lobster roll was maybe one of the best things I've ever had. Service is friendly and you will leave full! Just prepare for a bit of a wait if you don't get here early to stand in line."},{"name":"Little Bird Bistro","address":"215 SW 6th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"We had two wonderful meals.

I suggested they should update their menus to reflect that information, and she sheepishly grinned and agreed with me.\\n\\nI could care less about the extra $1.50 billed to me, but I don't appreciate an establishment that thinks it's OK to charge whatever it wants, whenever it wants.

This would definitely be a nice place to celebrate a special occasion.  There were lots of people on dates, a couple celebrating their anniversary, and a large group having a nice meal in an outside garden.  My experience here may not have been quite so typical since I went by myself, but it certainly made it interesting.\\n\\nBut first...the food!\\nFor the appetizer -- Carpaccio di Tonno con Avocado e Caperi (Ahi tuna carpaccio, avocado, citrus vinaigrette, fried capers, cherry tomatoes): The fried capers added a bit of roughness and saltiness to really enhance the flavors of the other ingredients. The thinly sliced ahi + avocado was a beautiful coupling of both of my previous homelands...Hawaii and California.  Very well done item.\\n\\nFor dinner -- Costolette di Agnello alla Griglia con Pesto alla Menta (Marinated lamb chops, grilled and served with fresh mint pesto, asparagus, and fingerling potatoes tossed with olive oil, garlic and fresh herbs): The lamb chops were fabulous and the mint pesto and olive oil they sat upon complimented them well.  But the veggies threw me for a loop; the tenderness of the asparagus, baby carrots and potatoes was completely inconsistent.  It was like Goldy Locks and the three vegetables, except I'm not blond.  The asparagus was over boiled, the carrots were too firm, but the potatoes were just right.  Other than the cooking, there was nice attention to detail on them, as the carrots were rolled in dill and the potatoes were salted with parsley.  The asparagus was...boiled asparagus. \\n\\nTo drink -- Some kind of red blend from Italy that's 78% merlot, 22% cab. It didn't strike me as good enough to actually remember the name, though it had been recommended by a waiter.  There really aren't a lot available by the glass, so best to order by the bottle or half bottle since they do have a huge wine menu. Or bring your own and pay the corking fee.\\n\\nFor dessert -- Tiramisu (Mascarpone cheese, espresso, lady fingers, amaretto cookies, marsala): Nuttier than most thanks to the amaretto cookies.  You can definitely taste them, and it tastes wonderful! The powered cocoa on top was semi sweet (mostly bitter) and was a little distracting because of the contrast in tastes. Problem solved: mix up the cocoa with the tiramisu by smashing and swirling with your fork for a fabulous blend of =semi-sweet nuttiness. Plus, this was the largest portion of tiramisu I've ever seen in my life..two sizable pieces. Could have fed a small army.  I ate the entire thing...after having eaten everything above.\\n\\nPerhaps the best part of La Grotta is its outdoor seating.  This isn't just a ho-hum patio that you can sit on, it's a complete garden with a variety of flora.  Everything from trees with big pink flowers and woodsy looking trees to ferns and potted flowers.  There's even a table that could sit 4 or 5 that's nearly secluded by high plants. But through the opening the couple sitting there kept staring at me while I ate.  Yeah, that's right, I'm a chick at a table, alone.  The lady smiled and said hi when they left.  Pity is great.  But I digress, back to the garden.  The one slightly strange thing is that condo balconies overlook it.  The residents must be jealous of the good food they're not eating. Warning: every silver lining must have a cloud, and all these pretty trees mean that ish is gonna fall on your plate if the breeze picks up.  Luckily, if you're a chick by yourself, they'll claim you were a \\"good sport\\" to put up with the debris and you'll get a free mini flute of champagne.  Pity wins again. \\n\\nThis place really is nice and the food is quite good.  I could have overlooked the vegetables and still awarded five stars if it wasn't for the hodgepodge service.  There must have been five different waiters that serviced me.  No not like that and no not because I was a single female diner.  None of the waiters seemed to have ownership over my table, or the tables around me which I observed.  You'd think it'd better to be over serviced than under serviced, but it was quite annoying when multiple servers tried to bring me the same item and when no one brought additional water.\\n\\nOne extra plus: complimentary valet parking."},{"name":"Scampo","address":"215 Charles St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Awesome brunch!

What weight could a vegetarian's review possibly hold at a BBQ joint?  Let me tell you.\\n\\nFirst things first, we entered the restaurant and weren't greeted.  We were left to our own devices to figure out in which direction, up or through, we would be able to find a host.  We proceeded downstairs to check first, following the flow of traffic, and entered into a damp, smelly, dark dungeon-esk room.  This was the first time I was inclined to run screaming out the door and down the street back to my car.  But it gets better, obviously we don't find a host, or any staff that will help us, so its back upstairs we go.  We find the host, and for our party of 6, they say it'll be about 45 minutes.  Reasonable, we'll have a drink.  But bathrooms first - this is where it gets EVEN SCARIER.  I get bathroom upkeep is sometimes difficult for busy restaurants, but this was a sad, sad, excuse for a bathroom that looked like it hadn't even been clean when they opened that day.  Not to mention, you have to duck into it and go up a few stairs?  Bizarre (insert the second time I was inclined to run away screaming).\\n\\nRedbones redeem themselves by offering a pretty nice selection of beer, I decided on the cider they had - the bartenders were pleasant though not overly attentive.\\n\\nWe were brought to our table, where we hungrily ordered 2/3 of the menu.  Having not yet finished the cider I had previously ordered, I asked for water, with lemon.  LEMON.  I proceeded to ask 4 more times for that lemon, and 45 minutes and a massive mason jar later of water, no lemon.\\n\\nThe meat-eaters could speak more to the BBQ, but I nibbled a bit on the cornbread, which was mediocre.  We ordered the hush puppies, and they were dry and not incredibly flavorful.  I was a big fan of the fried pickles/jalepenos - the plate was enormous and a good size for sharing with 6.  I think it would have been a tad overwhelming for a party of any less.\\n\\nWith pickles and cider, I was feeling less and less like I was sitting in a smelly cellar - until after we had finished our food.  We were working on the remainder of our drinks, digesting, relaxing, chatting... and then a host approached us and asked \\"how much longer are you going to be?\\"  Uh, excuse me?  I get they are busy, but there are much better ways to hint to a table you'd like them to hurry up... you bring the bill, you ask if there's anything else you can get them, you fill and refill their water glasses.

My husband got me hooked to the beach club since he says that Jimmy John's bread is way better than Jersey Mike's bread. He also likes that they add the avocado spread to that sub because it makes the flavor of the sub stand out. I would agree with him on that opinion, as it does bring out the sub taste. \\n\\nI usually get the subs on wheat bread because I like to cut the calories, I've even eaten it with the lettuce wrap but didn't prefer that too much as it was messy.

I love sweetgreen, and other locations have been stellar, but that is not what I found here.\\n\\nDecor/Ambience: The aesthetic is fairly standard of sweetgreen: minimalist design, bright white walls, light-colored wood furnishings, and at this location there is a large community table, which is nice. The space also feels bigger than most of the other Boston locations. That said, the layout makes it feel almost sterile, and the open kitchen looks kind of chaotic.\\n\\nFood: The offerings at sweetgreen are delicious - I appreciate the changing menu. The effort at local sourcing is a little underwhelming, but I appreciate that there is some thought towards it, and many of the salads provide a pretty substantial meal. (Pro tip: use the calorie count as a guide for how filling each salad is!) However, each time I have been, some component of the salad I have ordered has been unavailable. The most recent time, it seemed like they just hadn't refilled the arugula in a timely manner, because just after I chose my substitute green, someone walked up with a refill. This may sound trivial, but when menu items aren't available because of poor kitchen logistics, rather than actual scarcity or serious issues, then I get peeved.\\n\\nService: This was the weakest point for me. First visit on week two, there were only a couple staff working the salad line, and the guest line was LONG. The staff didn't seem as confident or knowledgeable of the process, which surprised me, because in other Boston locations it feels like a finely tuned machine. Additionally, it seemed like lots of staff were just hanging around the open kitchen, instead of jumping into the line to attend to the steadily growing queue. This wouldn't usually be a problem (new places need time to figure it out!) But this scenario has been the case every time I have been - not just upon opening. As a highly successful franchise, the quality seems surprisingly out of sync with the typical finely-tuned operation.\\n\\nI will keep attending this location, because it is super convenient in Harvard Square and when the offerings are available, they are delicious, but also will make sure to leave ample time to move through the process of ordering."},{"name":"Bubor Cha Cha","address":"45 Beach St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"Ack!

If you like oyster crackers in your soup as I do, be sure to ask your server, as they're not included if you don't ask.\\n\\nThe lobster roll you can either order warm or cold, but I would recommend getting it warm. The buttery goodness that soaks the bun makes the lobster roll as great as it is. Lobster meat itself they do not skimp on at all. The roll looks deceptively small when it arrives at your table, but I assure you, you will be stuffed after you finish it. At $27, the roll is a bit on the pricey side, but it is worth every penny and more.\\n\\nThe wait for a seat at Neptune Oyster can be a bit long, so I recommend coming at off hours (3pm was when my girlfriend and I came here and we only had to wait 15 minutes for a seat).

The secret must be the charcoal. The sausage literally oozes with smoky deliciousness and has that lovely \\"snap\\" I like in a hotdog. The chili is good, though I may prefer it with a little more spiciness and kick. I enjoyed the melted cheese but should you choose that option be sure to grab an extra handful of napkins. They're messy.  If you don't care for chili, slaw, relish, peppers and a variety of other toppings are available.  Finally, if you want your bun grilled also, be sure to ask. It normally is not served that way. All-in-all, Barker's serves the best dogs in town, in my opinion. \\n\\nThe owner and his staff are very friendly and courteous and seem to truly appreciate your patronage. This is one of the many reasons I much prefer to support local, family owned businesses over corporate chains. \\n\\nCons: Not necessarily a con, per se, just be prepared to spend $10 for two dogs and a drink.

I finally got the chance to stop in today for lunch. The restaurant specializes in yakitori, which is pieces of chicken (and other items like quail eggs or Japanese vegetables) grilled on a stick and topped with your choice of sea salt or a sauce. Yakitori Jinbei only serves yakitori at dinner, but the lunch menu has plenty of delicious items like soba noodles and donburi to choose from. Since it was so cold outside, I opted for the bowl of ramen noodles swimming in pork stock and topped with roasted pork slices, seaweed, and green onions ($9 for the soup, salad, and small bowl of fried sticky rice). I rarely see ramen served in Atlanta so I took advantage of the opportunity.\\n\\nThe soup was absolute heaven. I think I may have actually made some yummy noises out loud. The noodles had the right amount of bite and the bright bursts of green onion and ribbons of seaweed contrasted the rich stock perfectly. That has to be the best ramen I have had in quite some time--it was silky, creamy, and complex...insane. The pork was very tender and sliced into little thin rounds.

Firstly we had parking problems, staff told us to park in a certain place, when we did we were told we had to valet. So we parked our own car in the valet spot. awesome :(. We had been told we would get the set menu at a reduced price since we were bringing about 30+ people, but when we ordered and later paid we that was nowhere to be seen. The food was very poor, they talked everything up but it really disappointed. Each table had to share a plate of food, the \\"Moroccan bread\\" was basically stale American bread, we got the equivalent of a shot of soup, we shared a plate of basic salad, the other appetizer was gross, the main meal, I got the Lamb shank which was super fatty. Let me say I do enjoy different types of food and like Mediterranean cuisine, but this food seemed cheap and was not enjoyable. The staff were ok but constantly asked us about buying more expensive drinks or upgrading from the set menu to the \\"special\\" which was $20 more. The set menu came with a basic dessert but you could add a different dessert for extra. The waitress was not clear about the different dessert being extra and so basically suckered everyone into purchasing an extra dessert when they were already getting a free one. The real nightmare came at the end when they brought ONE BILL for about 30+ people for over $2000. The organizers of the night were partly to blame but surely the staff could have asked how we wanted the bill split. One of our party had to write down everyone's order on a piece of paper, we then had to CUE up and pay individually which took ages. It was an embarrassing end to a difficult night. Overall i was there from 6pm to almost 11pm and spent about $130 on a meal for my wife and I. The belly dancers were very skilled, the only good thing about the place.

Just wow.\\n\\nI've started to write reviews for Flying Saucer on multiple occasions and each time, I thought I would give them one more chance because the pizza- when I actually get it and it's made correctly- is good. But every time I give them another chance, they just screw it up again.\\n\\nLet's start with my first ever experience. I had been putting off going because the prices seemed high for a pizza. A friend of mine was moving though, and she wanted to have lunch at Flying Saucer on her last afternoon in Salem. I ordered a make-your-own pizza, and was pleasantly surprised with how good it was. In fact, I only ate half thinking I would have the rest for lunch the next day. \\n\\nWhen the bill arrived, I asked for a box. The waitress said she would box it up for me, so I handed over my half a pizza. When she came back, she was empty handed. She told me that she'd accidentally dropped the pizza on the floor. That's fine, mistakes happen. What astounded me was that I was not offered a new pizza or a comped lunch or a gift card for a future visit. I was offered either two slices of the pre-cut pizza they had sitting ready to sell (and they only had cheese available) by the slice, or 15% off my bill. Let's review. I lost HALF MY SPECIAL ORDER PIZZA, not two slices or 15%. Not wanting to take home a couple of crusty pieces which had been sitting out, I took the discount. It didn't even cover my beverage.\\n\\nBecause the pizza I'd actually eaten had been good, I decided to give them another shot and the second time ordered delivery. They sent me the wrong pizza. \\n\\nThe third time, they left off one of the toppings I'd ordered (and paid extra for). I called them, and the person who answered the phone was ridiculously rude. I was told they were short staffed and wouldn't be able to fix their mistake for at least two hours. I asked to speak with a manager and was told none was available. I asked how that was possible and was told to call back the next day. I did and the person I spoke with said they were going through staffing changes, and assured me their service would be better in the future.\\n\\nA few months later, I tried again. An hour went by after I placed my order and no one showed up. I called the store to inquire about the status and a very rude girl who answered the phone told me they hadn't received a delivery order. I read her the email confirmation I'd received and her response was, \\"Well, it never came in here. It'll be about an hour.\\" When it arrived, the order was wrong. AGAIN. I immediately called and asked to speak with a manager. This time, the manager apologized profusely and had a very nice delivery woman bring me a $15 gift card, asking that I not give up on them. \\n\\nStill irritated, I refused to use them again but several months later, I had a guest staying with me who was in the mood for one of their specialty pizzas. I gave in since I had the gift card to burn, and attempted to order online. The order would not process. I then called the store, yet again experiencing a very rude employee over the phone, and was told that delivery wasn't available that day because they didn't have enough staff.\\n\\nThe final straw was this evening. I've had the gift card for at least five months and not wanting to cook tonight, I figured I would use it. I placed my order online, went to check out, and found nowhere to enter the gift card. Again, I called the store. I explained that I was trying to check out but couldn't find anywhere to enter the gift card information online. I was told that I can not place an order because their system is down. I was also told there is no way for me to use the gift card for an online order. Another recap- the compensation I received for their screw up of an online order, can't be used for an online order.\\n\\nThere is no food good enough to deal with some of the worst customer service I have ever had the displeasure of experiencing, and the frustration of dealing with a poorly run business.

For our entrees, we ordered 3 half portions: braised chicken, scallops, and steak.  It was more than enough food for the two of us.

It's a simple dish of rice, chicken, lamb, \\"spicy sauce\\" and \\"Greek sauce?\\".  I apologize my food sauce terminology is off, but let me just say that the combination of those 5 ingredients makes for an amazing combination!\\n\\nThis dish was totally a 5 start dish, 100% delicious!\\n\\nAtmosphere?  Eh, no.\\nParking?  When I was there around 8pm on a Saturday night there were no parking issues but I could see if it was busier that parking would be a problem.\\nService?

Being the burger and fry lover that I am, I needed to make sure to carve out some time for this spot. And I was really happy that I did. \\n\\nEven though the burger is advertised with Brie cheese, I ordered it with American. For $16, it is a very, very good burger. There are 2 patties, with melted American cheese, lettuce, some onion, slices of sweet pickle, and some sort of sauce. It is fat, juicy, and you can really taste the char on the burger. My only complaint about the burger was that it fell apart really easily because the bun just couldn't soak up on the juices and flavors.\\n\\nThe burger is served with a heaping pile of fries. I ordered mine well done, and they definitely delivered.  The sauces that it came with were very icky and bleh. The homemade ketchup was way too sweet, and a bit chunky. There were only flavor profiles in the ketchup but I took one taste of it, and didn't touch it again, it was that bad. I would have preferred if they just gave me normal Heinz ketchup. The other sauce that came with the fries was some sort of aioli, but that tasted off too. It was too sour, almost like it was a vinegar aioli. I was sadly unable to touch many of my fries due to the nature of the sauces provided. \\n\\nOverall, I would come back for the burger alone and would make sure to bring my own bottle of ketchup. And I highly recommend the burger to anybody who wants to try it."},{"name":"Chipotle Mexican Grill","address":"1650 28th St, Unit 1224","city":"Boulder","stars":"3.5","text":"This location may be super busy but the employees are great!

Beef and chicken shawarma are marinated overnight and then cooked on a flat top griddle. It is delicious. They finish it off with some mysterious white sauce that I can't seem to re-create but it's damn good. Get it over their spiced basmati rice that's seasoned with Cardamom, clove, and cinnamon and you won't regret it. They have some hummus that's on my top 5 list and I'm a serious hummus critic. It's heavy on the tahini which I prefer. It gives it a very nice texture. I stick away from the beef/lamb due to them putting gluten in it as a binder. They also have a different type of chicken which is decent but sub par compared to their shawarma meat. It's cooked in big batches unlike their shawarma which is cooked to order. The sad part about halal bros is their terrible and inconsistent service. They have a phone for call in orders but rarely answer it. It's typically packed which can effect the food quality. I've been when no one is there and they have more time to prepare my dish and it proves itself. Halal bros is expanding so hopefully this solves it's service related problems.

I had the idea from the word \\"mug\\" that it would be a larger serving of beer - at least a pint. So, it was a bit disappointing that the mugs were less than a pint. \\n\\nWe ordered the fries, fried chicken, and radicchio. The fries were good - pretty normal. But the dipping sauce was great. I got the radicchio without meat. I really enjoyed the soft boiled eggs. The salad overall was good enough and it was a good sized portion. Husband said the fried chicken thigh was alright too, but it was no \\"Reel M Inn\\" fried chicken.\\n\\nOverall, everything was a-ok. Service was friendly and fast. Atmosphere was nice.

Otherwise, would've gotten 1.\\n\\nI tend to avoid restaurants that charge for parking, so this place got off on the wrong foot from the start with me. (And since it's in a sketchy area of town, there aren't any safe parking alternatives on side streets.)\\n\\nHowever, I really wanted to check it out, so I decided to go ahead and swallow my annoyance about the parking. When I got in the door (Sat. night) it was busy, but the girl at the door said I should be able to find a place at the bar (I only needed one stool and am a small female, so I don't take up much space.) Couldn't find a spot at the bar anywhere, but was told people would be leaving so I kept waiting (plus, I had paid to park - otherwise, I would've just left due to the busy-ness.) I ordered food and still did not have a seat by the time it came. I was wearing heels so was not excited to stand the whole time during my meal. The bartender (and part owner) knew of my predicament and was friendly, but made no effort (to my knowledge) to ask anyone else working there to look around for an extra stool at some of the nearby tables. Finally, after waiting on some self-absorbed people next to me, I agressively secured a seat as they got up. I ordered the autumn salad and the hangar steak, but was disappointed in the salad - not as I expected. It was more of a dry slaw than a typical salad. At this point the bartender asked me if everything was good, and just sad and disappointed, I couldn't even respond to him. He didn't even bother at that point to ask what was wrong, even though I was visibly upset. The hanger steak turned out to be really good (thankfully) although in a small, appetizer-like portion of maybe 10 pieces or so. Finally, after I was finished, the bartender asked what was wrong and what he could do to make my experience better. I told him about the parking, the lack of a stool, etc. and how it was all just disappointing, and he made me feel like a spoiled brat by saying \\"Well, there were other people in front of you, so I couldn't get you a seat. But I did my best to make you feel comfortable...\\" Really?? Because I don't remember standing in heels to be comfortable? Or not having someone look for one extra unused stool.

The tartare was plentiful, smooth, and the caviar had a peppery flavor that blended perfectly with the herbs and flowers. Literally salivating thinking about it.\\n\\nThen for the main courses we got the striped bass and spaghetti with crab, sea urchin, and chillies. The bass was amazing, but the spaghetti was out of this world. It had a small kick to it without being too overwhelmingly spicy, the crab bits were crispy like the exterior of a crab cake, it was smooth and creamy, and the presentation was beautiful since they wrapped the spaghetti into a little bundle.\\n\\nI'm a huge fan of seafood, I can't wait to come back, and it's definitely one of my top favorites in Boston now."},{"name":"Narcoossee's","address":"4401 Grand","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"There are several excellent restaurants on property in Walt Disney World.

They don't combine any crazy flavors or anything, but they're just such quality ingredients (and tons of them!) on super delicious bread. We got three different sandwiches to share: the Italian, the Italian steak tip, and the turkey. The meat is sliced when you order it, and it's incredibly thin. Each sandwich was super delicious. Simple, quality ingredients made each sandwich great.

I've tried two different ones.  The Tuna Salad Sandwich sounds amazing on the menu with basil, celery and capers mixed in.  But it didn't taste that great; the bread was dry and so was the sandwich.  I was underwhelmed by the grilled Ham & Cheese Sandwich; nothing about it really justified the $9 cost.\\n\\nThey do better with their salads.  The Strawberry mixed greens salad is delicious and works well as a side salad.  The Tabasco maple vinaigrette and candied pecans are a nice compliment to the spinach leaves.  The smoked trout salad came chock full of trout!  Next time I'll ask for it with less raw onions, but so far this was the best thing I've tried here so far.\\n\\nI like the \\"Blue Star Breakfast Plate\\".  Their bacon is nice and crispy, just the way I like it.  The open faced egg sandwich wasn't as good.  It would probably taste better if the eggs were over-easy or over-medium vs. scrambled.  The feta cheese on the eggs was a tasty touch but there wasn't much of it, and the marbled rye just got soggy (it would better if it was grilled or toasted). \\n\\nService seems to be hit or miss.  I receive much better service if I sit at the bar and order food.  At a table you take your chances.  On my last visit I was promptly seated and got my order in, but after the food arrived I was on my own.  After attempting eye contact a few times I finally walked up to the girl at the counter endlessly folding napkins to ask her for a coffee refill (they could do with larger coffee cups).\\n\\nPro tip: on Sundays you can get brunch items here until 3 pm!"},{"name":"Clerys","address":"113 Dartmouth St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"Solid place to go for the weekend. Definitely got crowded at around 10pm (good luck getting a seat at the bar) but clears the hell out at around 1130 because apparently the downstairs turns into a club. Seriously. We were the only two people at the upstairs bar. The downstairs part is free though and you wait to get in inside so you don't have to stand in the cold! Kind of awkward that the line wraps around the whole dining area though. Also we left at 1230, maybe later, and there were still people waiting online. \\n\\nMusic was really good though (upstairs but I assume its the same downstairs) and the drinks are cheap! Gin and tonic and a sex on the beach for $7 each. Basically a beer, awesome.

We got in line at 8:15 with a party of 6 and we're third in line and seated when they opened. The menu is meant to be served family style which is unusual for a breakfast spot but the portions (even the small plat portions) were pretty generous. Our server was attentive and did a great job describing the menu. As I don't eat pork, she was able to point out which dishes could be modified to omit the meat.  They were great about refilling our coffees. \\n\\nTwo in our party ordered the biscuit sandwiches (they weren't into the shared plate concept) which were good individual sized portions and they enjoyed. I tried the biscuit and it was crunchy on the outside and soft and buttery as a biscuit should be.  I tried some of the radicchio salad (the bacon pieces were large and easy to avoid) and the dressing was very creamy and peppery.  The egg on the salad was slightly over cooked for a six minute egg.  \\n\\nWe shared the trout board which came with beets, wheat bread points, a creamy spread, a cucumber parsley salad and a six minute egg.  trout was very similar to salmon and the portion was a little small but the flavor was great. The egg on the board was cooked much better than the egg on the radicchio salad. The cucumber, trout and spread were great on the bread as an open faced sandwich. \\n\\nI had the granola bowl with fresh raspberries and Greek yogurt which was very flavorful and light. We shared the egg frittata which had greens and peas. It was fairly large for a two egg frittata and the eggs were perfectly fluffy and enjoyed by all.  \\n\\nThree in our party ordered the Korean fried chicken bowl which they said was pretty spicy and hearty.  The blueberry ricotta pancakes we're delicious and the perfect end note."},{"name":"Refuge Cafe","address":"155 Brighton Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"I am going to start this review by saying it may be updated once I visit again. I am taking into account that it is their first few weeks of business and they have a few kinks to work out. \\n\\nI went on a Saturday morning around 10am for some breakfast. By this time they were already out of pancakes among many other things. It is possible that they were not expecting that many people, but still I think considering the location the staff should have been a little more prepared for Saturday morning breakfast. The menu looks great and they were happy to take any meat products out of their sandwiches since I am a vegetarian. I had a sandwich with egg, avocado, and cheese and it came on a delicious pretzel bun. Very different, but very good. Considering the area, I personally think they should offer some more vegetarian dishes. The home fries were just your average home fries, nothing special. I also tried the coffee and it was just OK. It was not bad, I have just had better. \\n\\nA major downside besides running out of food was the service. It was was really slow. You would think a breakfast sandwich would take about 5, maybe 10 minutes at the most but we waited for about 25 minutes. \\n\\nThere are a good amount of seats if you want to eat there, but it was pretty crowded. \\n\\nAgain, I am going to give this place a second chance because of its location and the fact that it was their first weekend.

Happy hour was about to start, so we got our orders in, sat back, and waited for the magic to start. The margarita was perfect: part thirst quencher, part salty tipsy maker. Exactly what we needed. I ordered a tostada with pork and was greeted by a dinner plate-sized heaping mess that I'm pretty sure consisted of an entire pig and a field's worth of black beans. And yes, I cleaned my plate. The tortilla kept it's crispness despite being doused in goodies and as I sipped on my salty brew and pummeled through the plate, I felt the feeling come back to my toes and my spirits become reinforced with SXSW-loving glee. \\n\\nHappy hour is a fantastic deal, as my dining cohort (San Antonio's very own Krys T) smartly ordered the quesadilla which was an impressive portion for a mere $4.50.
