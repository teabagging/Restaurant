I honestly have to say that a few of their items have seriously disappointed me recently, hence the 3 star rating.\\n\\nWe had their tiramisu and another cake the other day and they were pretttttty bad... The cakes just tasted very off and weren't good at all.  I can't really describe what was wrong with the cakes but when I spoke to the waitress about it, even she agreed that they weren't very popular at Leisure!  Their crepes were mediocre while their waffles were pretty good.  We also ordered a Taiwanese set that included fried fish paste pieces and deep fried chicken nuggets.  Those were awesome!\\n\\nThe service is a bit slow because they seem quite understaffed at night but its understandable considering the small size of the restaurant.

Our server was very knowledgeable and helped me pick out a perfect glass of wine. We started with the crab cake as our appetizer, and it was easy to cut in half to share. The sauce is to die for! The portion size was perfect: we got our money's worth, but weren't too full for our entr√©es.\\n\\nSpeaking of entr√©es, I chose the mac and cheese with lobster and it was absolutely delicious. The peas really added a lot! My boyfriend had the warm lobster roll, which was also great. I really loved how the small sides that came with the plates (namely the cole slaw with the lobster roll, and the veggies on top of the crab cake) were really delicious -- and not just an afterthought or garnish.\\n\\nFor dessert, we chose the strawberry rhubarb streusel tart, which way exceeded my expectations. The whipped cream was just the right amount of sweet, and the tart was the perfect size for two to share (okay I definitely ate more than my boyfriend, but isn't that how it's supposed to be?).\\n\\nI found the price to be very reasonable for a great Boston experience.

This place combined the best of two of those restaurants : the modern and technical Japanese cuisine of Kusakabe, and the organic, down-to-earth seasonal menu of The Village Pub.\\n\\nDish after dish we were surprised to see more than just all-around amazing-tasting food. There were plates presented to us with the look of a delicate, Asian-inspired dish that tasted like the comforting meal that was roasted over your backyard fire pit. They used their sauces to tie in sweet, savory, fruity, and nutty elements throughout their courses - that's definitely a mark of a great restaurant who knows their stuff.\\n\\nThank you, Barley Swine, for a wonderful food experience that was amazing from start to finish. The service was very cordial and the overall timing of the food was well planned and thought out.

Surprised at the crunchy shell that led to the soft cheese filling\\n\\nBeet cured mackerel and pine\\n+ Ironically, I'd describe this as an earthy seafood dish... It's amazing with what you did with the aftertaste. \\n\\nSunchoke custard\\n+ Man, you guys do deviled eggs well... I wish the apple bits were brought out a little more in the custard though. This was the only underwhelming dish you had tonight.\\n\\nEmber roasted squash, mesquite, toasted seeds\\n+ Wonderful unfolding of many flavors. Technically well done\\n\\nRed shrimp, cauliflower, tangerine\\n+ I hate shrimp. I love this dish. WTH. Shoutouts to the chef at the grill and the person who made the sauce. It was AMAZING, cooked perfectly, and beautifully balanced.\\n\\nAkaushi beef, oyster mushroom, seeded loaf\\n+ The marrow broth had so much flavor. The ribeye steak was very tender and flavorful. The arugula pesto could stand on its own with the bread but also be used to cut the saltiness in the leftover broth so well.\\n\\nPork belly, cabbage, Gulf XO sauce\\n+ The southern sushi : a very unique dish where the cabbage is cooked like seaweed, but made the dish smell like a backyard bbq. Tasted like some good shrimp and grits with fresh, pickled cabbage in tow to change it up.\\n\\nDuck, broccoli, fried duck egg \\n+ Perfectly cooked duck with a great crisp on the skin. Broccoli played a different role as an integral part of the dish rather than the typical side filler. Did I say that that your sauces are ON POINT?!\\n\\nApple, lemon grass, koji rice pudding\\n+ Timed perfectly in the menu. Great balance between sweet, nutty, fruity, tart, and milky. Coconut and apple introduced great character in the dish while the crispy rice gave it the texture it needed.\\n\\nDark chocolate ganache with caramel and tangerine\\n+ Great capper for the end. Sweet, but not too sweet. Really liked how the crust pulled in that citrusy, nutty flavor from the toppings on the ganache \\n\\nAnd thanks for the adorable pastries :) I would only complain about the tea as it didn't match the level of the food menu, but then again, who cares."},{"name":"Santarpio's Pizza","address":"111 Chelsea St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I had a request for a calzone.

Plus you really can't beat the views here! Overlooking Salem's Harbor and the historic Ship provides a great spot for you to bring friends or family visiting out of town!\\nI have never had a bad meal or drink here. Everything is always spot on. For appetizers you HAVE to try the lobster quesadilla and the chowder fries. I'll even go out on a limb and say that the chowder fries are truly life changing. Whoever accidentally spilled chowder on fries one night and discovered this seriously deserves a medal, not all heroes wear capes folks. You also can't go wrong with the lobster roll and the baja fish tacos.\\nThe blood orange shandy is one of my favorite cocktails there. I don't like a drink that tastes strongly of alcohol and this offers the perfect balance of alcohol and sweetness.

The muligatawny soup was deliciously smooth - bended to perfection. The cucumber salad had a unique spicy sauce that I loved. \\n\\nOur curry specials came and we were amazed at how much food it was. We each got 3 different curries to try (6 in all) as well as 2 personal naans. My favorite curries were the palak paneer, vegetable korma, and an amazing brown curry with lamb. There was also a delicious coconut chicken curry and something similar to a Tikka Masala with a rich red sauce. \\n\\nAt the end of the night, I have to say that the Clay Pit is the best Indian Food that I've had in Austin."},{"name":"Hopdoddy Burger Bar","address":"1400 S Congress Ave, Ste A190","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I love the shroom burger with a side of parmesean fries!"},{"name":"Frontier Public House","address":"4909 NE Hazel Dell Ave","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"**I'm upgrading to 5 stars.

It's just more chill and comfortable than any other restaurant I've been to. \\n\\nI made reservations in advance for the chef's tasting menu for two.

There were 11 dishes, and they were all tasty, but some stood out big time. \\n\\nShrimp dumplings with hot sauce- especially interesting because you're expecting dumplings with shrimp in them. Wrong! You get dumplings that have been made out of shrimp. Creative, different, unique, and all those other worlds, plus delicious. \\n\\nThe shiitake pasta with scrambled egg and grilled broccoli was also special. The pasta was filled with a very strong and deliciously cooked shiitake mushroom concoction. Wonderful flavor and texture. \\n\\nAnd my absolute favorite- the poached red snapper. That fish melted in my mouth and was swimming in the most delicate delicious sauce. The portion is small but the flavors are so special that you want to take small bites to enjoy every single little bit. And a larger portion would be too rich! It was perfect. \\n\\nThe blackened octopus was also particularly amazing. I had never had octopus that reminded me of chicken, but in a very good way. It was so smoky but tender and meaty all at the same time. That one was also a big winner. \\n\\nNot only is it very difficult to prefect such small, amazing dishes, but having top notch service is also very difficult. Just think, we had at least 11 dishes and every dish we were given fresh silverware and often more water. It was perfectly timed and executed.

In retrospect, restaurant week is not a good deal and if you really want to like a place just go there on a good night.\\n\\nWe had to adjust our party size down somewhat last-minute, ended up sitting at the bar for 20 while they adjusted.  It seemed punitive more than anything.  Decor was nice, along the lines of what I expected.  A little more cramped than I'd like but overall nice and grown-in.\\n\\nSo why 2 stars?\\n\\n- Service was painfully slow even considering it was restaurant week.  In total it was close to an hour after arriving that we were finally sitting at a table with a bottle of wine.  The restaurant was by no means packed and yet the waitstaff could barely cope.  There were dishwashers and busboys just standing around the restaurant.  Pretty sure it was the B-team.\\n\\n- The entrees came out on burning hot plates and looked like they'd been sitting under a heat lamp waiting for someone to order them.  This doesn't surprise me, given that there are a handful of choices and it's easy for restaurants to whip up premade entrees on the cheap.  It does surprise me that one of the better restaurants in Boston would do this.\\n\\n- The food wasn't that good.  It was actually pretty bad.  My appetizer was 3 small, soggy shrimp on a small pile of greens.  We ordered oysters to supplement and they never came.  My veal shank was cooked well but the cooked spinach was too salty to eat.  I got down one spinach gnocchi (spinach gnocchi with cooked spinach? because hot ham water goes well with ham?) and the rest got left on the plate. The desserts were absolute crap, on par with Baskin Robbins.  We tried different things and they all got left on the table half-eaten.  They looked like they'd been delivered from a factory and tasted like they'd been sitting in a fridge all weekend.\\n\\nOn the plus side, the wine list was good and we made a night of it.  Leaving, I was kind of sad that I hadn't come here on a good night.  $39 for 3 crappy, premade courses really isn't that good of a deal.  It's actually kind of a ripoff.

The food is a tad overpriced, one example would be the mini steak tip appetizer that comes with 6 tiny steak tips the size of a dime & cost $9.95 (Not really a good appetizer to share when having drinks with friends) the steak tip dinner is $17 and though the steak tips are amazing when your looking to have drinks etc this adds up significantly. This brings me to the cost of the drinks, 1. Every bartender charges something different  as well as makes the same drink different from the other bartenders. I get a mudslide on the rocks and every one I order is a different price 2 & a different consistency. I am a very local patron & I would come in for drinks far more often than I do now if every time I left there my tab wasn't $80 & up with not much to show for it 3. They no longer carry twisted tea or any other bottled beverage such as Henry's Hard orange soda(big seller) or something similar therefore for someone like myself of whom doesn't drink beer or wine and also doesn't want to be forced to drink cocktails everytime, it doesn't entice me to stop in more often. \\nAlso I ordered a steak tip dinner to go & when I was ordering the bartender asked what I wanted for my sides, I asked if I could do half french fries half onion rings and was told NO!? Then was told that \\"I could order a side of onion rings, that they were only a couple bucks\\" I thought wow they charge $17 for a steak tip dinner and I can't get what I want unless of course I wanna add even more $$ to the bill of which was already outrageous..I think the Brook is a gold mine & the owners have the right idea but they really need to cater to their locals and holbrook residents as we are the people that will carry them through the cold winter months when things are slower & we are the ones that people ask whether we reccomend it or not but not if the prices remain as high as they are..another restaurant The Publick house just opened up around the corner and I'll gladly go where I will be taken care of nutritionally & financially.

I think there are actually more flavors at the restaurant than at the food truck, (plus you get to sit inside, which is a perk when it's 35 degrees outside). Two of my friends and I shared the Freebird (my favorite of the two) and the famous Funky Monkey. I really enjoyed the Freebird because it wasn't as heavy or overwhelming as the other doughnuts I've tried. The cheesecake filling was awesome, and the fruit on top made me feel just a little less awful for consuming all of the calories. I know that a lot of people really like the Funky Monkey, but I just can't say that it was my favorite. It was very enjoyable, but a little too sweet for me, especially given the size of these things!\\n\\nAMBIANCE AND SERVICE: (4/5)\\nDecent, nothing special. We had a pretty large group, and our waiter was patient with us and let us split checks (since so many of us were sharing a number of doughnuts). I thought it was a little toooo dark inside. I would have liked it better if I could really see what I was eating, but I guess that's just the mood they were going for. Regardless, nothing too much to complain about!\\n\\nPARKING: (4/5)\\nGourdough's has a private parking lot in front of the restaurant. It didn't look like it was very large. That being said, our group went at 11:30pm on a Friday night, and there were no problems finding parking.\\n\\nCOME AGAIN?:\\nBecause I think Gourdough's is so unique and delicious, I will probably be visiting either this restaurant or the food truck each time I come up to Austin.

I feel good about the ingredients they use and I love that I can get a nice juicy greasy burger if I'm in the mood or that I can opt for a healthier choice on a salad or say the Tuna burger (which is my favorite burger in the place by far) and I never feel like I'm missing out because everything gets 5 stars for taste.  I adore that they have natural sodas in the fountain and that their water is both chlorine and fluoride free!  The drinks at the bar are stellar and the Parmesan truffle fries make my heart go pitter pat.   The only reason for 5 stars is the fact that I have to wait so long to get in on pretty much any given day and that they don't take to go orders over the phone, which hinders me from going there more often (I have a 2 year old that can make waiting a hassle) .  That being said I always go when I have guests in town.

Nice folks & comfortable place but the food & coffee is horrible. I love concepts where a nice spot does coffee/beer & wine/booze/food but they miss the mark on all fronts. The coffee was weak & watery (& I ordered a double macchiato, which is pretty much straight espresso) & the croissant was like one of those mushy pastries you get in a bag at the gas station. Staff is not trained on their coffee drinks. I heard the guy telling the girl that a macchiato is equal parts coffee & milk. Not at all. \\n\\nI've read ppl say that they get their baked goods from some bakery in town as if it's well known & something special but I've never heard of it or seen their goods advertised anywhere worth mentioning. And they're not good. They're like Hostess or Entenmenn's quality. No bueno. \\n\\nI'm working nearby so thought I'd give it a second chance & went there for a beer & a snack. Beer was fine, can't mess that up if you order a good one. I guess I could try saying the bar side of the place is fine but I don't have much faith that they know how to make drinks based on the coffee & food. \\n\\nI ordered Spanish olives. The guy pulls out a JAR of basically pimento olives (minus the pimento). I also ordered the boiled egg. Hard as a rock. They let me sample the tortilla espa√±ola and it tasted like absolutely nothing so I doused it in s+p and Tabasco. \\n\\nI don't think it's that they don't care I really think it's that they just don't have a clue. Which in a highly competitive market might actually mean they really just don't care enough - to not have really researched what's going on in the culinary world, and the food they're doing is so basic it shouldn't be hard to do. It's not like they're struggling with a new concept. Flavorless egg & potato is ridiculous. Throw some chives in there. Salt at the least, paprika. Anything really. Crappy jarred olives that you're calling Spanish olives like you'd see on a nice tapas menu is ridiculous. Those are going to require some olive oil & spices. \\n\\nToo bad bc it's a great location and the staff was really nice both times I was there."},{"name":"The Press Club","address":"2621 SE Clinton St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Great lunch in setting for any adult occasion.

The place is very small, and if you tried putting your elbows out to your sides you would most likely hit the person next to you. I think this gives the restaurant it's real Italian roots charm, but if that's not something you're okay with, skip this place, there's no getting away from it. The d√©cor is strange, yes, but you shouldn't be looking at the restaurants d√©cor throughout the night, you should be focusing on the food and wine!\\n\\nThe wines by the glass they offer are a fair price and good quality, but I was with another person so we decided to just get a bottle. We chose a typical Chianti, which was great.\\n\\nThe food is unreal, really really really good authentic Italian styles and flavors. That being said, the portions are not large, if you're looking for a lot of food, you won't find it here. The portions are actually a normal size, not the American-ized supersize portions. I had the bruschetta with spinach, tomato, mozzarella, basil, and a balsamic drizzle. There were two bruschetta on the plate, perfect for an appetizer, and I was completely blown away by the freshness of everything from the basil that tasted fresh picked from the garden 2 minutes before being plated to the chewy inside yet slightly crisped outside bread. I would highly suggest any of their bruschetta for an appetizer! For dinner, I had the special with tomato fettucini, goat cheese, tomatoes, asparagus and shrimp. Beautiful colors and an unbelievable combination of flavors, the goat cheese was divine, and the shrimp were large and delicious. Unfortunately, there was absolutely no room left for dessert, so I cannot comment on that.\\n\\nOur waitress was really friendly and nice, which was something I was a bit nervous about given previous reviews. The only thing that annoyed me a little was the fact that I had to constantly ask for more water, no one was designated to go around to tables and watch peoples water glasses. This was the ONLY reason I took 1 star away, that's just kind of a pet peeve for me, personally.

Never thought much of it other than some old-school Chinese restaurant that belonged more appropriately in Chinatown.

That's a relief -- at least it's not another ghetto Chinese hole.  And wow....this place still does the cart thing.  Good place to take the cart fans.

My favorite part of The Breakfast Club's menu was a section called \\"Library Specials,\\" with dishes inspired by the movie's characters:  The Dork, The Criminal, The Jock and The Princess - all served in what seemed like the perfect portion - sufficient, but not overwhelming. A friend ordered The Janitor - two eggs over corned beef hash, home fries and toast, $6.29. The day's special: French Toast stuffed with banana and Nutella, was basically dessert for breakfast, $7.99. I don't usually like French toast but I couldn't get enough. My roommate's spinocotta omelet, $7.49, was stuffed with spinach, ham, tomato and ricotta and came with some of the best home fries I've ever had. But ultimately, it's the ambiance that makes TBC unforgettable - the walls are covered in '80s movie posters and vintage lunchboxes; customers sit at the counter drinking milkshakes, watching their bacon sizzle on the grill.  There are many breakfast places within walking distance of me, but if I were in the area, I would absolutely stop in again.

One with Chinese sausage , Vietnamese pork roll and prawns. The dipping sauce was perfect for the family so I got a second to which I squeezed a @#$&load of siracha into. I then added some ground chili oil and it was perfect. \\nThe rolls were very good. They were crunchy like they should be. the filling was light and the noodles done well. we all liked them.\\nI had the spring roll to myself. It was good. properly fried, not big enough for my liking. I don't understand why they cant make them bigger. What's  some extra cabbage gonna cost. But all in all I felt all the rolls were primarily vehicles for the hot sauce to enter my pie hole . That's usual for me. \\nAll the Pho's were rare beef and beef balls. Broth was good.

Why bother participating if you're 1. not interested or 2. too good or 3. think restaurant week diners are cretins?\\n\\nMy dinner was badly executed and the service extremely poor.  I've been to Locke Ober twice before and was favorably impressed by the menu (the mix of well-executed classics and newly imagined contemporary dishes) the impeccible old school service and of course the decor.  Alas, none of that was evident in my meal this week - except the decor.  A short list of my complaints:\\n\\n* Service service service - they DRESS like well-trained high-end waiters (and yes, they're all men) but did not perform as such.  Our appetizers got plunked down before we'd even ordered wine, no one helped us pick wine, no one asked us all evening how the food was, and on the way out a pause at the hostesses station drew nothing but a blank stare (so much for my opportunity to vent.)  Their goal to turn our table was completely transparent - if we hadn't lingered over our wine, we could have been in and out in under 50 minutes, which in retrospect, might have been a good thing.\\n\\n* Food - My appetizer, an \\"heirloom\\" tomato salad was clearly pre-prepared and just out of the fridge - more like a supermarket tomato that had been sliced and then stored in the fridge.  Accompanying ricotta was sweet enough to be canolli filling.  My main was the opposite - it had clearly had been sitting under the warmer long enough (\\"hot plate! be careful!\\" gives that away!) to render my salmon rock-hard and sahara-dry.  Just to drive my point in, I've had better salmon on American Airlines.  Dessert was better, but unmemorable.  Again, my outrage is only in part because the food wasn't great, but because THEY JUST COULDN'T BE BOTHERED TO TRY.\\n\\nEven at RW prices it's not cheap - and that is money I could have spent at a place that cares enough about diners to put some thought and effort into the menu, the food and the service.  \\n\\nI won't be back."},{"name":"Kelly's Roast Beef","address":"165 Endicott St","city":"Danvers","stars":"3","text":"Thick fatty slices of overcooked roast beef....and overpriced.

On some visits, the service is acceptable, but at other times it has been lousy.

To try to reduce our chances of an extremely long wait for our food, we often call our deep dish pizza order in about 15 minutes before we arrive at the restaurant.  Half of the time, this doesn't seem to help at all.

I have been here on two previous trips (I am a Disney dork,) and I think it has gotten slightly better. \\n\\nIt is a part Landry's Restaurant group, which would normally scare me off (Rainforest Cafe and the like are pretty terrible, eh burgers for 14$ but look over here, Gorillas.) As such it is really good, it is Americanised Chinese food, meaning common, a bit greasy, and salty, plus heavily reliant on carbs, but since you are walking all day in the Parks, this is perfect. \\n\\nWe started with the dim sum basket, we both liked the pork pot stickers, which are pretty hard to screw up, but still, and cha su bao, but we were less fond of the shrimp shu mei. The odd thing is it says it serves two and yet there are three of everything, so we just split the last of everything.\\n\\nFor a main entree I picked the chicken lo mein because it was cheap and I was craving carbs terribly. I had also tried the lo mein on a trip in December 2008, and I had liked it, though then I had picked shrimp which were over cooked. The lo mein was exactly what I had been craving, and the portions were generous (every time I come here I end up taking home leftovers, most of which don't actually arrive home, as twice I have sat down and finished them while waiting for the bus back to the resort.) There were more veggies in the lo mein than I remembered from last time which was a plus. \\n\\nMy boyfriend (Michael F. by the way, but he didn't specify much so I thought I would,) got the duck with Anandapur glaze and he substituted chicken fried rice for the jasmine rice that normally comes with it. I was wary of the duck, being that this is theme park food, even if Disney has stepped it up quite a bit, but it looked good. I like my duck completely rendered of fat usually, which this wasn't but there were enough lean parts it seemed, and what I tried of it was very good. The stir fried veggies were the usual fare and seasoned well, if a bit under-salted (which makes sense since the sides have to be eaten by people with different dietary restraints.)\\n\\nFor dessert we got the alcohol shaved ices, he got the citrus one and I had the cherry one (which was really more like a cherry limeade.) both were good but I preferred mine. They \\"made it at the table\\" meaning they poured the shakers of liquor over the ice, which meant they were really shaved ices not slushies, which was nice.

It was sitting in the bowl for a while before they brought it out since the top of the bisque had the sheet forming on it when it cools off. I have no idea if there's a term for that.\\n\\nI also had countneck clams which were alright. It wasn't very tasty. It was definitely fresh tho. \\n\\nEscargot was another appetizer that I ordered for my lunch. They did a good job with the garlic butter. I thought it was cute how they have individual cups for the escargots. I would still prefer them in a cast iron plate so it's eaten at very high temperature and stays hot longer.\\n\\nThe atmosphere definitely made me feel like a little kid.

So I hopped on yelp and looked for Indian food in her area and this is what popped up. I saw both the good and bad reviews and decided to just risk it, it seemed like maybe there were some picky people. \\n\\nWe were greeted by a pretty brown haired typical looking sorority girl as our hostess, who smiled, and just dumped us at our table with no explaination of what to do.The decor was actually pretty lovely and my first impression was \\"Wow! I was not expecting this.\\" And yet, that was the first bad sign. I should not be comfortable in an Indian restaurant, if i want real Indian food. Anyways, my friend and I looked at each other, looked around for a waiter to take our drink orders, shrugged and dived into the buffet. \\n\\nI loaded my plate up with one of the two soups, the Creamy Vegetable Soup, rice and Garam Masala and Lamb Korma with some Pakoras. I started with the soup and was mildly impressed with it, very creamy and not what I would expect from soup but hey, it's a new type of soup! But I'd never had any soup at an Indian restaurant before so I have nothing to compare it to. The Pakoras were also passably tasty if a little cold. Buffet food. It happens. The Masal and the Korma however... It's hard to put my finger on it. It was very bland, but there was most of the flavour but it was just so MILD, no spicyness at all, which I think took away from the food immensely. Whatever gives those dishes their sinus clearing flavour, it's absolutely necessary to the flavour. So this was possibly my worst Indian food experience, because it was just so .. watered down when it came to flavour. I had to check myself, and look about to see if anyone else was enjoying their food and they all seemed to be! My dining partner was aghast at the taste as well. With unimpressive naan that was almost like pita bread from being flat and not puffy at all, and too wet rice, well it was just all unappetizing.\\n\\nAs we left, we debated about it and decided this place was so well liked because it was like Asian Fusion restaurants. A very Americanized setting with absolutely nary a sign of anyone who'd normally be there enjoying the food, which put all the Upper White Middle Classers at ease and let them think they're being \\"cultured\\". \\n\\nThe absolutely only reason I give this place two stars is because the soup was pretty delicious and I left not feeling too hungry and because my dining partner said the curry was passable, compared to the rest of her plate. I don't recommend it for anyone who considers themselves a real foodie, as opposed to someone who wants to just go \\"be experimentive\\" in a familiar environment. If you want Indian food, go brave the masses and sit elbow to elbow with a loud family and you'll be delighted by your food.

I say yet because my wife and I have eaten there three times and each time the chicken has gotten better than the time before. The chicken rates a solid four, easily the best in town, and I would give the service a 12 if I could. It was outstanding. So keep improving, Gus's, and I'll look forward to the day I can give you five stars.

After just two visits I'm willing to proclaim The Conquistador as my new home away from home in inner SE PDX. Let's break it down! \\n\\nThe Style:\\nThere's no confusion about the imagery of choice at The Conquistador - if you've been looking for a place to drink in Portland while surrounded by black velvet and carved wooden art featuring 16th century Spanish Empire warlords, this is your spot! The art is kitchy, it's elegant, it's divey, it's hip, it's awesome. \\n\\nMix in the black vinyl booths, dim '70s candle lighting, and even a fully functioning 1980s era juke box (replenished with a nice array of past & modern jams), and you've got a place my pops would've been right at home in 40+ years ago. \\n\\n(Oh and don't forget the decent-sized sidewalk patio on front!)\\n\\n\\nThe Drinks:\\nThere's something for everybody here...solid wine options, cheap bottle/draft beer, and a wide variety of finely-crafted cocktails...if you like booze, you'll be happy. \\n\\n\\nThe Food:\\nIt's fresh, it's veggie-centric, it's flavorful, and it's excellent. Try the rice & bean bowl with any of the house-made salsas (I recommend it paired with a Tecate tall boy) and go forth from there. I'm instantly suspicious of the word \\"vegetarian\\" being used along side a dark bar, but The Conquistador has made me reconsider my close-minded stance. \\n\\n\\nThe Service:\\nWe've been helped by outstanding, easy-going folks each time in. Once with just my fiance and I at the bar and another time with a group of 6 at a back booth. Both times the service has been prompt, helpful, and lively. Can't ask for much more. \\n\\n\\nOther Entertainment:\\nThere's one pool table, a skinny shuffleboard table, a couple pinball machines upstairs in an interesting crow's nest-like loft (that also features an excellent sparkling gold vinyl couch), plus the aforementioned vintage juke box, room for DJs and apparently a trivia night. \\n\\n\\nThe Vibe:\\nToo hip and stylish to be considered a dive...too down to earth and friendly to draw the negative \\"hipster bar\\" label...it's a place I'd take my parents one night and my kickball team the next. I'm not sure how popular it is or isn't on late weekend nights, but I'm guessing the place doesn't radically change in character. \\n\\nThe Verdict:\\nWhether you start or end your night here, you won't be disappointed. Great food, great drinks, great service, great ambiance...a tremendous addition to my swollen Rolodex of PDX favorites."},{"name":"Hottie Hawg's Smokin BBQ","address":"2061 Main St NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Overall HHBBQ had very good food and cheap beer, but had a few other elements that detracted from the overall experience.\\n\\nOur very chesty waitress (learned later that this is supposed to be a \\"breastaurant\\") was helpful and usually easy to flag down for another beer or refill of water. Only knock here was half of my beer was cleared when I was in the bathroom. \\n\\nI had the sliced brisket, even the small size portion was large enough to have leftovers. Not overly fatty, but enough to have the tender texture you expect from smoked brisket. The fries were good, looked to be hand cut though a little limp.\\n\\nSauces looked to be home made - I tried both the vinegar based and the mustard based. The vinegar based sauce had a little too much tang for me, was very heavy on the vinegar. I found the mustard based sauce to be very tasty, just the right amount of mustard with a nice smoky flavor to it.\\n\\nThe real ding against this place is the location. I was worried to leave my car in the lot out back. This place is in a terrible neighborhood and the parking lot is behind the building, completely blocked from the street.

What is the huge problem with this location is the consistency of the service.  There are some bright spots -- some good people who get the order right and actually check on the table.  More often, there appears to be outright confusion over who has what table, no means to alert a server someone has been seated in their section and apparent black holes where servers go.  Whenever you need something you need to speak up, wave, grab somebody -- anybody.  Don't think eye contact alone will get you anywhere.\\n\\nAlso, there is this tendency to be at either extreme with the bill.  Either it is dropped in the middle of the meal. No coffee or desserts are to be ordered I guess.  Why not just leave the left over boxes with the meal when you bring it.  The other extreme has you wanting to wander through the place to locate someone to take your money."},{"name":"Ramen Danbo","address":"1333 Robson Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4.5","text":"I prefer their thick noodle...Price and quality is the reason I give them four stars...

The restaurant is, in the lack of better word, cramped. It's a mix between a fast food joint and a proper restaurant, and that shows. The chicken itself is fine (and indeed mildly spicy), but nothing that can't be gotten at any other fried chicken place. Where the restaurant particularly disappoints is in its style of providing the chicken on a single piece of cheap white bread. Why there is a single piece, instead of either none, or an actually respectable amount, is a mystery to me. A possible answer lies in the fact that, if I recall correctly, they charge for extra slices of said cheap white bread.

They only have one type, and while it's not bad per se, but it's nothing to write home about either.

There's a fenced area outside with picnic tables and room for the dogs to run around without the threat of getting hit on the street.  Also, there's a fair amount of parking.  Enough to accommodate those who are there, but not to much to make the place overfull when the parking is at capacity.\\n\\nHowever, I'm sure you all remember the old proverb telling one not to judge a book by its cover.

Its presentation, in a souvenir maritime mug was priceless, but I would trade the comfort of an ill-rinsed coffee mug for a tall glass any day.  That's right.  My coffee tasted like soap.  Granted, it's comforting that it didn't taste like horseshit; at least I know they are trying to keep the mugs clean.  But soapiness definitely detracts from the flavor of coffee.  Especially when my boyfriend told me it was Ruta Maya, which is one of my favorite local roasters.\\n\\nMy other big complaint was the music played.  Mind you, I can tolerate most music, but turn it up louder and it's just annoying.  No matter what.  Especially if you're in what is supposed to be a laid back atmosphere.  Especially when most people go to coffee shops to study.  Especially when it's John (Cougar?  Is that passe?) Mellencamp.  \\n\\nThen there's the little stuff.  Our table top kept turning and rocking and we weren't being especially violent.  There was no iced yerba mate.  And the water in the paper (why did the cups have to be paper?) cups tasted funky.  I shouldn't complain about the water, no.  It was free.  Unfortunately, all of these little things together added up to a star deduction.  \\n\\nHowever, two funny events made my visit to Cherrywood entertaining.  First, the cutest little pug wearing a cupcake sweater ran straight into the kitchen as if to say \\"Hello!\\"  For that I had to mouth to my boyfriend \\"Can we have another?\\"  Later, completely unrelated, a man near the door started cursing and walked out.  He went from being cool to losing his shit in about a minute.  Maybe it was the Mellencamp."},{"name":"Boston Coffeehouse","address":"1573 Saxon Blvd, Ste 5","city":"Deltona","stars":"4","text":"Very nice place in the plaza by the Walmart market.

The tandoori item was tasteless- traditionally marinated in yogurt and robust spices I just dont see how this is possible but it happened. The vindaloo was decent enough but if u know what i mean - it was kinda muddled tasting. No layers of flavor and the freshness of spice didnt come thru- (they didnt use fresh cinnamon sticks,cardamom pods, perppercorn, coriander seeds, no way here otherwise this wouldnt happen) the jalapeno in there sure didnt help my perception - thats just not right in indian food - period...

The restaurant has recently remodeled. Previously it had a cut up floor plan, with a dive bar feel, really good food, and a really clean place, but a dive bar feeling, and needless to say dim lighting. Some miss that, my feeling is if you're going to be a dive bar...be one. The Trails End Saloon has that wrapped up in Oregon City, so why compete with that?\\n     The new New Hing's has an open, well lighted area. The restaurant is clean, well lighted and has a serious full bar, and HUGE menu. The remodel has opened up the space and given them a new kitchen. This is still a local business and the people are really accommodating. \\n     This restaurant will make you anything you want. I suggest you tell your waitress what you like and have them suggest a dish. We are pescetarian (we don't eat meat except fish) their menu is wonderful, as is their staff. We LOVE the S11 Kung Pao Scallops in hot (mild for us) sauce....Giant scallops, peanuts, veggies...Yummy, and lots of it. \\n     We have eaten in and ordered out, I believe the portions are similar (unlike some places). The food is hot and fresh. We have not had one dish we were not satisfied with. \\n     This is not a \\"fast food\\" restaurant, so if you want \\"American\\" (read Panda Express, or similar), you will not get what you usually get. New Hing's is like homemade American Chinese food;  Less deep fried and more stir fried. \\n     In closing, if you haven't been to New Hing's in a while give them another try. Talk to your servers, say what you like, and ask them to suggest a dish (especially the older lady that works the bar, she's great). I ordered what I thought I wanted and then we were talking she realized I wanted something different and she ran back to the kitchen to change the order, no hard feelings."},{"name":"Blue Star Donuts","address":"1155 SW Morrison St, Ste 102","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Oink oink \\nSnarffle lemon oink poppy seed is oink oink perfection \\nOink oink I could eat all of them nom nom oink"},{"name":"Arlo's Fish & Chips","address":"7316 North Lombard St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"I heard they were the best in the neighbourhood by my daughter who lives nearby so we went to check them out today.

It is the closest to your simple, quick ramen joint which you will find around every train station in Japan:\\n\\n- Noodles are the thick, wavey handmade kind, which are just superior for ramen, especially for their broth here\\n- Soup is a mix of chicken and pork, which is makes it a lot more edible that that fatty tonkotsu. This is close to the ramen places in my part of Japan. They also have a vegan and pescatarian option, but they aren't as good - they could definitely do a better fish base if they wanted to \\n- Prices are probably the lowest I've seen in Portland: $9 will get you a basic bowl with some onion, pork char shiu, and nori. This is on par with ramen being a quick, relatively cheap eat. I don't believe that $18 ramen is much better than $9 ramen. \\n- The pork is soft and melts in your mouth without being disgustingly fatty or chewy \\n- The menu is small (ramen plus a few appetizers/bowls) and the service is fast because of that, just how a ramen place should be\\n- All the workers say the greetings to welcome you to the store and thank you as you leave, just like in Japan \\n\\nSo, go get the miso ramen with an egg added, maybe add a mini curry rice (which is actually pretty large).

He said, \\"As unbelievable as this is going to sound, that is probably the first meal I have ever had where I really enjoyed every single dish start to finish.\\" Neither of us are big on sitting with others, but we quickly got over that and had a magnificent evening. From the brilliant cuisine to the outstanding service, it was even greater than everything all the 5-star reviewers promised!\\n\\nI believe the key to having a truly exceptional experience at Barley Swine is to be prepared, knowing exactly what to expect. I can see how if one hadn't read through numerous Yelp reviews prior to stopping in, the experience could turn out to be frustrating and even disappointing.\\n\\nI don't think I could rave about the phenomenal dishes any more than the other reviewers have, instead I am offering a rundown of what to expect when you dine at Barley Swine...because you absolutely must experience it at least once! \\n\\n- It is difficult to see if you are traveling north on Lamar. Other Yelpers had mentioned that it was just north of Opa's and to look for the big Horseshoe Lounge sign. Those two tips made it very easy to locate.\\n\\n- The parking situation is a nightmare. Drop your companion off at the door to score seating, then drive through to the back lot and if there are no spaces keep driving through until you exit on Heather. Turn left and drive down to the stop sign. You can park anywhere beyond that.\\n\\n- They do not take reservations, so arrive early or late (especially if you have a party larger than 2) or you will most certainly have a ridiculously long wait - like hours long! You can leave after you check in and they will text you when your table is ready.\\n\\n- It is a gastropub, expect communal-style seating on bar-height chairs. It is not the place to go for an intimate, romantic dinner. This is not something my husband and I particularly care for but we knew it going in and were willing to go with it. It wasn't as bad as some we have experienced. There was enough space between the chairs that you weren't touching the person next to you, and we did appreciate being able to see what others were having and hearing their comments. (And, speaking of tables, I have to mention that I get so excited when a restaurant has hooks under the table for your purse, yea, for those little, thoughtful design elements!)\\n\\n- Plan to  be here for a while after you are seated, at least an hour for 3-4 plates. The plates come out one at a time, with time between each one. We shared 5 plates, the 2 specials, and 2 desserts (lol, maybe that won't come across quite as gluttonous as \\"9 plates\\") and we were there a little over 2 hours. \\n\\n- The menu descriptions are not very complete. You must tell your server up front if you want dairy items on the side or if there is anything in general you have an allergy to or do not like, because you cannot rely on the menu to know what all is in each dish. They are very understanding and exceptionally accommodating, without making a big production. I so appreciate the way this is handled. \\nI have to say that the servers, overall, are terrific. Amazingly enough, they convinced my husband to finally try brussel sprouts, and he has been converted!\\n\\n- It is on the pricey side - note the $$$ that reviewers are giving. Plan on $50-$60 per person. The plates run $12-$14 each, duck is $22, and desserts are $8; so, yes, you can eat for a lot less than $50 but then don't jump on Yelp and talk about how you were still hungry. \\nOur 7 plates, 2 desserts, and 2 beverages (not including beer/wine) for two of us came up to $127.  My husband is a pretty big guy, I am a runner, and one of the things he really appreciates about me is that I love to eat and I do! We agreed that we had actually ordered too much food  - 6 plates and 1 dessert would have been perfect for us.\\n\\nOur favorites were the scallops, the goat, duck, and the brussel sprouts/bacon. We also enjoyed the pig and trout. The lamb (sausage) was spicier than we expected, it was good but not one we would order again - though there were thin slices of something lamb in the bottom of the dish that were amazing. For dessert the milk chocolate ganache was fabulous. The carrot cake was not what we were expecting and we wouldn't order it again - but there was some sort of carrot explosion something it was served with that left me wanting much more!\\n\\nWe will most definitely be returning to Barley Swine...and it can't be soon enough!"},{"name":"The Original Szechuan Chongqing Seafood Restaurant","address":"1668 W Broadway, Unit 205","city":"Vancouver","stars":"2.5","text":"I've driven past here so many times.

Soco area is always busy and we learned that Hopdoddy has a parking behind the restaurant. Upon entering I see a line (not out the door yet) and was debating with my husband if we should wait since we both were hungry. I believe a bartender overheard us and asked us if we would like to sit at the bar since some people just left. Score! So we sat at the bar and first looked over the drink menu.\\n\\nI settled on the sangarita which is described as: Gold Tequila, Freshly-Squeezed Orange and Lime Juices, Pomegranate Grenadine, Served on the Rocks with a Chile Salt Rim. It was a nice refreshing drink and I really didn't taste too much alcohol in it. My husband ordered a frozen margarita and said it was good. \\n\\nI had a hard time deciding what to order but ended up with the EL DIABLO: Angus Beef, Tillamook Pepper Jack, Caramelized Onions, Habanero and Serrano Chiles, Salsa Roja, Chipotle Mayo, Red Leaf Lettuce, Beefsteak Tomato. I ordered the El diablo gluten free and without cheese. The server asked me since I had requested a gluten-free bun if I had other allergies. I said yes I can't have gluten or dairy. She put that into the system and I thought that was extremely nice and helpful because as I have learned over the years that dairy and gluten can pop up anywhere. \\n\\nMy husband ordered the Buffalo Bill burger: Bison, Apple-Smoked Bacon, Blue Jack Cheese, Frank's Hot Sauce, Sassy Sauce, Red Leaf Lettuce, White Onion, Beefsteak Tomato. We also split an order of the truffle fries with the cheese on the side. \\n\\nI will say that the gluten free bun on the el diablo was solid and even my husband liked it who usually hates anything that is gluten free that I eat. The overall burger was tasty and the overall flavors were an around a 3.5 star.  My husband thought my burger was a little too spicy and I thought it was maybe a 1-2 on the spice scale (going up to a 5). However, never judge my palate for spice since I am apparently pretty immune to spice. My husband's burger he said was awesome and would get again. \\n\\nThe truffle fries were good but not the best I ever had. The best is a place in Maryland at DuClaw (if you must know). I would recommend getting chipotle ketchup for dipping since my husband couldn't get enough of that flavor. \\n\\nI believe Hopdoddy is a great place for gourmet burger but be prepared for longer lines/waits and also it being more expensive.

The Host could barely hear us over the clang and could not find our reservation on file for a few minutes. After a few minutes our party of 6 was seated at one of the round tables in the main room, which seemed a bit cramped for that number of people, especially when order multiple small plates, which was soon confirmed as all of the tapas came at once and there was not enough room on the table. They really need to work on pacing.\\n\\nWe started out with a pitcher of the traditional Sangria for the table (which I did not have), general notes were that it was fruity and refreshing, but contained a lot of ice that watered it down, seemingly not much wine, and very little fresh fruit. I ordered the Vermouth from the first wine flight and though I ordered it at the same time as the Sangria, it took over 15 minutes longer to arrive to the table and everyone else had already finishing appetizers and their first glass of Sangria.\\n\\nI also ordered the Spring Sling, which was tart, refreshing, and the chamomile flavour was noticeable, but well balanced, against the citrusy grapefruit.\\n\\nWe all ordered Tapas to split and put them in to order at the same time. Our waitress was very knowledgeable of the menu, but seemed to know the wine list and drinks better than the actual tapas. We ordered the: \\n\\nSpicy Eggplant Caponata - served cold/room temp, this combo of eggplant and red peppers is coated in a delicious sauce and tastes great on the complimentary bread. Would not suggest if you have an aversion to food on the softer/slimier side\\n\\nWild Mushrooms a la Plancha - great texture and packing in taste, my only hick up was that a few bites were very over salted\\n\\nSpinach and Chickpea Cazuela - served warm the dish is almost a chickpea mash with sauteed greens. Very good and filling, but I wish it had another contrasting flavour or texture to contrast the smoother and mild mashed chickpeas and spinach\\n\\nLocal Corn and Tomato Panzanella - this dish was an understated hit and the perfect side, great blend of flavours. The sweet corn and tomato contrasted the the slightly sour/tart balsmaic vinegar, the slightly warm bread soaked up the sauces and oil, and the red onion provided a nice crunchy texture and bright flavour against the mellower/softer textures of the bread and tomatoes.\\n\\nMussels al Ajillo - this was a slight disappointment, especially since it was one suggested by our waitress. The mussels themselves were good, albeit on the smaller side, but the sauce was oily and lacking in flavour.\\n\\nPaella Mariscos - Overall good Paella packed with seafood, some areas of the plate were slightly oily-er than others and I crunched down more than once on not fully cooked grains of rice and sand (from the shellfish). In general had a great flavour.\\n\\nSince it was a birthday, the kitchen put together a birthday platter with their sandwich cookies, flan catalan, fresh fruit, and chocolate decadence.

That took some convincing also not ok they screwed up. The delivery guy was super nice and apologized so we got the food for free, but seriously whats wrong with the rest of the staff?

After seeing cups at the location in Little Rock, I knew this location was in the works but didn't know when the planned opening was.\\n\\nWe were greeted by many of the servers and staff as soon as we walked in. They were very welcoming. We were served very quickly and our drinks were kept full. The restaurant itself is very clean and new. A little different from the original, but not in a bad way. The location makes parking a little difficult, but the chicken here would make it worth a 10 block walk. There were a few TVs hanging around the place with games on. The dining area isn't huge, so I expect it will be fairly full during dinner and on the weekends at night.\\n\\nWe ordered a few 2 and 3 piece meals. The chicken was perfectly spiced and crispy, and it had the right amount of batter. The meat was very tender and juicy. If you haven't had Gus's before, be prepared for a little kick from the spice. It isn't terribly hot, but could surprise some who don't like any heat. \\n\\nFor sides, we ended up with fries, slaw, baked beans, and mac and cheese. The fries are thicker than fast food fries, but not as thick as steak fries. The slaw is fresh and crispy, without an overpowering mayo taste. The mac and cheese was very creamy and served with shredded cheddar on top. \\n\\nOverall, I would say this is as close to the original as I could have hoped for. This chicken is good enough to make fighting traffic and parking downtown well worth it.

No problem at all. I'd sit at the bar again without complaint.\\n\\nOur server was delightful and energetic. He knew the menu upside down and provided me with a vegetarian-only menu when he noticed I was zeroing in on all the veggie options. After the two cocktails we ordered proved underwhelming (my theory: the bartender simply messed up), our server got me a new, delicious drink and assured me that the first drink would be removed from the bill. Good attitude, good service. \\n\\nMy meal, the black pepper shanghai noodles, was fantastic. Very filling and flavorful.

Come to think of it, Blue Star's actual star IS white, so the comparison is, in my view, especially apt.  And like that most famous White Star ship, Titanic, these doughnuts also go down well, and with plenty of gasps (because they're so freakin' amazing).  But it is not here where the comparison ends.  Just as at the near-end of one's life, one may wax philosophical--\\"Did I live a good life?  Am I going to heaven or hell?\\"--one cannot but help be overcome by this same inexorable philosophical impulse when faced with great pleasure--(shall we call it by the racy, albeit descriptive French euphemism, petite mort?) such as may be had by eating a Blue Star doughnut. Thus, if you are fortunate to possess the opportunity to patronize this business, you may be left wondering, as I did, By what providence has the city known the world over for its nonpareil coffee ALSO gained equal stature in the ever-so-complementary world of doughnuts?

Nonetheless, I am deducting a star because of the minimal veg-friendly options.  I KNOW I KNOW--this is a burger place so the emphasis is on meat, it says it right there in the title of the restaurant.  They do have a falafel burger available, and while it's tasty enough, it didn't blow me away.

It's all good and all worth trying.\\n\\nOne thing to note - it's one size fits all here, so, at most, these pies will feed two people.

The location provides New Orleans Style coffee and other standard cafe foods. Disclaimer: the cafe has a \\"no laptop\\" policy to force human interaction. Interaction proves difficult when the cafe was mostly empty the entire time I was there, giving me time to stew on all the aspects of the cafe I truly disliked. \\n\\nAmbiance: the cafe was cutely decorated and provided a variety of sitting environments from cozy couches to counters with stools. There was no strict style scheme which was novel yet displeasing. The light fixtures hang low, and the art on the walls was a bit of an eye sore. Overall, I'd give the ambiance a 3/5. Didn't do more. Didn't do less. \\n\\nCoffee: For those who have never tried New Orleans Style coffee, the process incorporates a Chicory Plant that helps smooth and strengthen the coffee flavors, but if you're unprepared and unaccustomed to that flavor, the coffee tastes like it was made in a soapy dirty cup. The chicory flavor becomes aggressively pronounced in pour over and americanos. I did not enjoy the coffee whatsoever, and with the \\"no laptop\\" policy, I had no distraction from the truly unpleasant coffee experience. \\n\\nThe Factory was just adequate.

They were barely seasoned were just plain so we had to add more seasoning when we got home. The cheese that they put on the fries is actually a sauce. However, I expect a sauce to be pourable and this was not. It came in a cup. It was so thick we had to dip our fries in it. The taste of the sauce was \\"meh\\" and not anything memorable.  The burgers were good but I think I would rather go to Five Guys and get their burger and bag full of fries when considering the price.

In fact, I don't think I could have been more productive and a little part of me thinks that Render's cool and chill ambiance had something to do with it.\\n\\nAs for my chai latte, it was the perfect pick-me-up after a long morning.

I thought the prices of this place was a bit pricey compared to other brunch places I have been too and enjoyed. Although the severs and the decor was good, I didn't really enjoy my experience as I felt rushed. I think this place would be good for lunch, but not brunch.

We decide to go on a Tuesday evening, and head out.\\n\\nWe are greeted when we walk in and surprised when they tell us that there is no wait. To us, all of tables seemed to be filled but we follow the waitress over to a 6-seated table with 2 girls already sitting at the end. I figure we'll get a space in between the two parties, so I start to sit in the chair furthest from the other winos and notice that the menus and napkins are in the middle table. \\n\\nEeek. The middle table! We were seated right next to them.\\n\\nSo now we are sitting elbow to elbow with two strangers, who can't stop telling adamant stories to each other about how \\"I study taxes, not economics!\\". Okay fine, that isn't really the restaurant's fault that those two girls were annoying and loud, but it doesn't help to have to sit 6 inches from another person while they're eating and drinking. In fact, if it weren't for how close the tables were to each other, that place might have even been kind of intimate, and dare I say it, cozy? But if they did that, they would only be able to seat 8 people, and not the 32 that they probably had sardined in there.\\n\\nSo we figure that is as bad as it gets. We get greeted and our drink order is taken. They have a decent beer and wine list, but beware- you'll pay pint prices for an 8 oz. beer. \\n\\nThen as we take a moment to look over the menu, which recommends that you get 2-3 small plates per person (ranging from $5-17), while another guy gets seated to our left. We awkwardly try to hurry and figure out what we want to eat when another completely different lady comes and gets seated to my husband's left. \\n\\nSo now I'm at a table for 6 that is currently seating 4 separate parties. That's a lot of different conversations going on at once. We would have loved to try the food, but the atmosphere was so jarring and close-quartered that we couldn't even enjoy ourselves.

So I first went to Hopdoddy about two years ago, at about the time when it first opened. I remember waiting in line for over an hour (the end of the line was still inside Hopdoddy so we figured it wouldn't take that long. Boy were we wrong). Even though the food was delicious, I couldn't justify waiting in line for that long ever again. \\n\\nRecently, a friend and I were picking a place for dinner and she suggested Hopdoddy. It was peak dinner time on a Friday night and I was starving. I got queasy just thinking about the wait time, but I agreed to go. And after a great experience that time, and a few times after that, I'm so remorseful over all of the time that I avoided going to Hopdoddy. I could have enjoyed two years of delicious burgers. Now I must make up for lost time.\\n\\nSo yes, the lines are sometimes long, but Hopdoddy has gotten it down to a science. The line moves way faster than you think it will (even when you're waiting outside and it's wrapping around the building). I would say, on average, I've waited about 30 minutes (even during peak times) and it's completely bearable, especially if you grab a beer while you're waiting. On the topic of beer, they have a pretty good selection, but I've heard GREAT things about their cervezarita. Definitely trying that next time.\\n\\nBut really, it's all about the burgers. Sometimes I don't want to eat them because the bun is so perfect, but then I remind myself about how delicious they are and I can't stop.

I believe my exact words as I approached the adorable truck were, \\"I feel like a little kid, I'm so excited...eeeeeee!\\". I ordered 2 cupcakes for my boyfriend and I to share (which I then wished I had ordered two just for me. We split \\"lil miss strawberry shortcake (which has since been retired..boooo!) and, \\"red velvet\\". The strawberry shortcake cupcake was quite possibly the best cupcake I've ever eaten. It was an instant favorite. It consisted of a moist vanilla cake filled with strawberry, topped with a light whipped cream icing, and drizzled with a strawberry sauce. (my mouth is watering just thinking about it). It was sweet, but not overly sweet. It had just the right amount of yummy-ness to keep you wanting more. The red velvet was delicious as well. The icing was out of this world. you could most definitely taste the cream cheese, and it didn't have that artificial taste that most cream cheese icings tend to have. It wasn't too heavy, and it left the most heavenly taste in my mouth. The service was amazing as well. Very friendly, and eager to speak with the patrons. I will definitely be frequenting this truck more often. I can't wait to try more flavors. *drool*"},{"name":"M C Spiedo","address":"606 Congress St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"Run, don't walk...away. Horrifyingly bad service!

I suppose we should have known that things were going to be rough when it took our flustered server 10 minutes just to initially come by.  We quickly ordered some wine and two apps (flat bread and the burrata) making sure to ask our server if it would be ready in a enough time to make our show. Needless to say only one of the apps ever came... with a hair in it.  Rushed for time, we asked to speak to the manager.  We waited and waited and had to request him again.  He eventually came over and comp'd what came of our food and drinks.  My husband and I both agreed that we would hate to see how this place operates on a REALLY busy night!

It was still good, but the sour salsa got to be overwhelming after awhile.  It also did not come with eggs or toast.  Overall, I thought my dish was probably the least winning out of all the dishes at my table.  Besides the sauteed mushrooms, the best thing about my food was the side order of super juicy and fresh heirloom tomatoes.\\n\\nEveryone else seemed to enjoy their food and from what I've sampled, it seemed like I had just ordered the wrong thing - hence I'm willing to give this place 4 stars.  The oyster hash (also sans eggs!) was pretty good - very large oysters breaded and deep fried over the same bed of potatoes.  I guess deep-frying something always makes the whole dish better!  My friend said her oyster omelette was also really good - it was served French-style and seemed to be crammed with oysters and bacon.

This place is located next to Sunset Grill and Tap, at the intersection of Brighton Avenue and Harvard Avenue. This is the type of place that you should bring a group of 4 people or more because of the various entertainment options they have. It is also probably one of the most spacious bars in Allston.\\n\\nProbably the biggest entertainment option they offer is billiards, in the form of the 8-ball game. I think you have to pay $14 per hour on Friday evenings, which is why I suggest bringing a group of four people or more. I would call myself a casual billiards player, and I'm not good at playing, but I had a great time playing. The tables are in satisfactory condition. It would be cool if they also offer an option to play Snooker. They need to repair the racks to make things easier to store the cues and if they can provide two \\"chalk cubes\\" per table, it would also be convenient. \\n\\nAnother fun entertainment option they can offer is \\"foosball\\", also known as table football. They have about four tables to play with. I think you need a good amount of $.25 coins to play. \\n\\nOne beer that I like to get and some of my friends got was the Victory Sunrise. It is a fresh, refreshing and cool beer, and I think it is categorized as a wheat beer. They have a fairly good beer selection from the tap. \\n\\nAs for food, it's decently good, they serve this nacho plate, called the \\"Red, White, and Blue Nachos\\" which is almost exactly the same as the nacho plate served at Sunset Grill and Tap. I believe this place shares the same kitchen. One plate, which is under $10, should be enough for a group of 6-8 people. It is really big. The guacamole, combined with the cheese, and beef chili made the the nachos really tasty and the nachos had a nice crunchy crisp. The Calamari dish they serve is also good, it had a nice crispiness on the inside, and decently chewy and tender on the inside. They also served it with some fried peppers, which was also good. \\n\\nService was okay, the server our group was nice. Interior was really casual, giving it a typical American feel like I see in a lot of bars. The staff is fairly strict as well because there is a man that checks your identification before you go inside. \\n\\nOverall, this is a pretty good choice to get some beer, nachos and to play some billiards in Allston. This would be my secondary choice if I just want to go to a bar and drink beer, but it would be my primary choice if I really want to play billiards with a group and improve on my skills in shooting the balls into the holes."},{"name":"Nick's Bistro","address":"169 Squire Rd","city":"Revere","stars":"3.5","text":"Decided Nicks for a pasta dinner, was originally excited however that quickly changed when my food arrived, the food was awful!

The two sparkling sticks were pointless. It stopped a second after it was placed on our table. Eating a whole marsh-mellow is not as tasty as it seems, if they melted it a bit and blended it with the chocolate syrup, it would have been better. The hershey chocolate is in it's whole chunk. You can't eat it with the ice-cream for a blended taste. You're basically eating a plain piece of hershey chocolate by the bulk. The two actual s'mores was a mess to eat. It's big enough you can't eat it in one bite and when you do take a small bite, the marsh-mellow stiffly fights to keep itself together. The chocolate syrup all over the s'more makes it impossible to cleanly grab it without chocolate on your hand every time.

We would definitely order them again.  They are also on the happy hour menu.  Good choice!  Oh! and the pickles were great too.  kind of a small little app  (approx 5) but very good.

Overall, the experience was very good--the food was tasty, the vibe of the place was lively and raucous in a fun way, and our server was great, friendly and competent. I'm somewhat tempted to give this place four stars, but the prices strike me as slightly too high for the \\"Summer Shack\\" image that they're trying to project, so 3+ stars it is.\\n\\nAmbiance: The interior definitely lives up to the restaurant's theme. Large and open, it feels a bit like a warehouse, but not in a bad way. Near the entrance, there are huge lobster tanks, as well as some industrial-sized pots. On one side of the dining room is an extensive raw bar, and there's also a bar area in a separate room from the dining area. What with the extensive list of cocktails and beers, I could definitely envision spending some time there. The main dining area is large and loud, but not deafening: I think the separation of the bar helps keep the noise down somewhat. Also, you can't miss the gigantic tikki-man turned fisherman outside... it's pretty gimmicky, but a definite hoot!\\n\\nMenu: The menu is very heavy on seafood, as expected. You can order steak, fried chicken, and meatloaf as well, but if you're not into seafood, don't expect to have many options. \\n\\nFood: I started with a cup of the clam chowder (New England-style, of course!), which was very tasty. It was creamy, but not too much so, and I appreciated the abundance of nice, big pieces of clam. Others at my table sampled oysters from the raw bar (they have a number of options available daily), the grilled clams in garlic butter (delicious, particularly thanks to all that butter!), and the whole squid (which was also very much enjoyed). \\n\\nFor my entree, I went with a special: the bluefish, which was mostly wonderful. Prepared simply, it had a great taste and was lovely and fresh (it made my dad, who's been rather prejudiced against bluefish for years, a believer!). The accompanying rice was well-cooked, if a bit plain; however, I found the olive tapenade that they used on the fish to bit a bit too strong and overpowering. The flesh of the fish wasn't overcooked, but the skin was more charred that I would have wanted. Others at my table ordered the special cod, which was simple and tasty, and the fried fish sandwich, which was very decadent on its buttered roll! \\n\\nThe desserts keep with the all-American, summery theme of the menu. The Indian pudding was quite tasty, as was the filling of the pumpkin pie (coming from someone who is quite picky when it comes to pumpkin pie). There's also soft serve (chocolate, vanilla, or twist), which you can get in either a very moderately-portioned sundae (it's the equivalent of about a scoop of ice cream, topped with some hot fudge, whipped cream, and a cherry), or in cone."},{"name":"Bridges Cafe & Catering","address":"2716 NE Martin Luther King Jr Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I don't understand how you make it to eighty years old without learning how to talk to people.

This \\"sushi burger bar\\" is a fun place! As soon as we stepped in and I saw all the fun, colorful decor, I knew we would be in for a treat. I'm generally not a fan of Asian fusion restaurants, but The Cowfish pulls off its fusion cuisine well. Their unique style combines American burgers with Japanese sushi and it's interesting to say the least. It actually works.\\n\\nThe restaurant opened April 2016 at Perimeter Mall in Dunwoody. It's on the front side of the mall, facing Ashford Dunwoody Rd. It replaced Goldfish, which was part of the Here To Serve restaurant closures in 2015. The space has been totally redone and looks terrific. The design is stylish, trendy, and playful. There's a fancy aquarium at the bar, many funny and amusing references to pop culture, and a lively, casual atmosphere. There's a variety of indoor and outdoor seating (covered), and I think this place works just as well for a date as it does for a group meal. Birthdays are popular here and the staff do an entertainingly good job singing loudly and hitting a gong to celebrate.\\n\\nThere's a huge display next to the hostess counter that shows customers' statuses on the waitlist. It's a virtual aquarium and each party is assigned a goofy cartoon sea creature to represent their place on the waitlist. The creatures have funny names like Eel Eel Cool J and Dolly Sharkton. Each party's creature gets bigger as their place on the waitlist gets higher. That was more detail than you really needed to know, but I thought it was neat and different.\\n\\nThe menu is huge and can be a bit overwhelming. They have a variety of Asian-inspired appetizers ($6-13 each), salads (most $13-16), sandwiches ($12-14), burgers ($12-17), sushi (sashimi, nigiri, maki rolls, cone-shaped hand rolls, etc.), fusion specialty rolls (most $14-19), \\"burgushi\\" items (burger-sushi fusion, $14-22), desserts ($7-8), milkshakes ($6.50), hot tea, and all sorts of alcohol (beer, wine, cocktails, martinis, spiked shakes, sake).\\n\\nWe tried a couple apps and a couple burgushi entrees.\\n\\nAppetizers:\\n* Big Al's Yellowtail ($10) - slices of yellowtail sashimi topped with thinly sliced jalapeno pepper, served with a side of ponzu dipping sauce\\n* Blackened Tuna Nachos ($13) - five wonton chips with crab rangoon dip, avocado salsa, tomatoes, seared rare blackened yellowfin tuna and microgreens\\n\\nBurgushi:\\n* The Ultimate \\"Brento\\" Bento Box ($18) - two featured mini burgers of the week, sweet potato fries, Thai cucumbers, edamame, and choice of a 4-piece fusion specialty roll\\n* The All-American Bacon Double Cheeseburgooshi ($15) - seasoned all-natural Angus beef, yellow cheddar cheese, white cheddar cheese, applewood bacon, and red onion, wrapped in soy paper and potato strings then flash-fried; topped with ketchup, mustard, dill pickle, and Roma tomato; served atop Cowfish sauce with a side of house-seasoned fries\\n\\nThe apps were very good. \\"Big Al's Yellowtail\\" is essentially The Cowfish's version of yellowtail jalapeno, an app most sushi restaurants have on the menu. It's a simple dish, so the quality of the sashimi is what makes the difference. I thought this version was A-OK; not among the best I've had, but not bad either.\\n\\nI had to order the tuna nachos after seeing pictures of them on Yelp. They turned out to be fantastic. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. The chips were light and crispy. I loved the creamy crab rangoon dip and avocado salsa and the tuna was on point. I recommend this one.\\n\\nI thought the ultimate bento box was alright. I prefer traditional bento boxes instead. We were never told what the minis were, but I think they were the Shroomin' Swiss Burger (Swiss cheese, sauteed mushrooms, roasted garlic aioli) and the Boursin Bacon Burger (garlic & herb boursin cheese, applewood bacon, sauteed mushrooms, grilled onions). It looked like the buns of the minis were Hawaiian rolls. The beef patties were cooked to well done. The patties were a little dry, but the minis weren't bad.\\n\\nEdamame, cucumber salad, and sweet potato fries were par for the course.\\n\\nFor our fusion specialty roll, we chose the Tropical Storm Roll which comes kani (crab), avocado, and cucumber inside, topped with tuna, salmon, yellowtail, Japanese mayo, sweet eel sauce, Sriracha, and multi-colored tobiko (fish roe). Since I'm allergic to crab, they removed the kani. I thought the roll tasted great and would order it again.\\n\\nThe cheeseburgooshi roll was delicious.

(My local friend had to call her friend to double check that we were at the right place.) These sweet circles aren't typically what my raging sweet tooth craves, but boy these were delicious! I ordered the \\"squealing pig\\" which is a donut smothered in cream cheese frosting, drizzled in a strawberry jalape√±o jelly, layered with CRISPY bacon pieces, and finally topped with slices of candied jalape√±os. It may be a bit confusing for a first timer, but my thought process went a little something like this: 'Ooh soft and sweet... With a little salty crunch?... I can dig it... Ughhh YES cream cheese... Whe-where did that spice come from?' But most importantly, why did it vanish from my plate? Here's the breakdown: the salty bacon compliments the donuts sweetness while adding texture to its soft, fluffy body and the cream-azing frosting balances the heat from the jalape√±os while still letting it shine. \\n\\nWhat to expect: Typical dim pub lighting with tables on the left and the bar on the right. (So if you walk in through the right door it'll look like you're entering a bar... Which isn't a bad thing at all.) It's a little difficult to read the menu if your eyes aren't yet  adjusted to the dimness or if your friend keeps casting shadows with her head while leaning in to read descriptions. Mason jars!

I'm hoping to upgrade this review to a 4-5 star after they've worked out some kinks, but also hope the owners read through these reviews and take a few notes.\\n\\nThe space:  the renovations look great.  The downstairs bar is classy with a beautiful granite bar,  perfect view but was strangely.. empty. The upstairs bar/dining area was packed wall to wall people--mostly groups of bros, and lots of girls in tiny shorts and heels.. meat market-style). Once we realized they don't serve food downstairs (or have a wait staff to man the 10 empty tables lining a beautiful skyline view..?) we understood better.  \\n\\nSeating experience:  1) No host stand.  I had to walk around looking for someone to take my name--it was very unclear where I was supposed to go, who I was supposed to talk to.  What I finally found was a very sweaty, busy looking man with a clipboard running around seating people and eventually finding his way back to the front of the room to take names.  May I suggest TWO people for this job: One to man the door and one to seat guests.  2)   When we were finally called for a table, we were taken to a tiny table in the middle of the bar with one chair.  Apparently they bought JUST enough chairs for all the seats in the bar, and someone had taken off with one.  We had to wait for them to clear another table before moving us to the second table (because they couldn't' move a chair from that one to first, nicer located table? Very strange. 3) We were crammed in in a row of 2-tops, in the middle of a very noisy bar.  About halfway into our meal, they decided to try and seat 3 people at the 2 top next to us, which meant someone basically sitting in our laps. I was stunned they would try this. Luckily, a table next to us opened up and I asked the manager if we could move to that table so they could push the other two tables together to better accommodate 3 people.  At this point, we were now on our THIRD table.\\n\\nService:  Our server was great.  Very sweet, helpful, food came out hot and quickly.  After we moved to our third table, we were missing silverware and the food runner noticed immediately, and brought it all for us.\\n\\nFood:  We ordered the heirloom tomato salad (delicious, fresh, perhaps a little pricey), lobster bisque (simple, flavorful, tasty, though again, pricey), the chicken (highly recommend this dish--perfectly cooked, large portion), and lobster roll (highly anticipated given the $25 price tag--let down. Lots of lobster, but very plain, nothing unique, and on a sub-like style roll. Fries were good.)\\n\\nDrink: Decent local beer selection on tap but sad bottle beer selection.  Has the owner not gotten wind of the craft beer craze?  How about some selection aside from domestic light beers? Also saw  no drink menu or wine list, so have to assume that does not exist yet.\\n\\nOverall: There's great potential here--excellent food, space, and locals are dying for someplace that's comfortable yet affordable.

Come on!  You pay $5 for a milkshake at Johnny Rockets or Baskin Robbins!  $2 more is not bad for being at a trendy place that happens to be owned by a fantastic chef who should have ( in my opinion) won Top Chef.\\n\\nOur total bill--- short recap: 3 burgers, 4 sides, a Cheerwine, and a Milkshake--- was $52.

The only thing this location did better was not have a line stretching outside and attempt to pull off the whole Emperor's New Clothes bit. Yet, the SoCo location had something that was WAY worse: after standing in line and making it up to the register, you're not even allowed to order your food until a table is available. So you're basically ignored until a table and the amount of chairs appropriate to your party pops up. Which is the standard set-up at any restaurant in the known universe. Yet, you have just waited 15-30 minutes to get to that point! They could at least have some peanuts or crackers to nibble on along the way.\\n\\nThis establishment is the classic example of what happens when inventors try to be entrepeneurs: even though they understand the science, they suck at the business. Granted, the burgers are good, though overpriced. But honestly, they're burgers. Just burgers. You're not reinventing the wheel. This isn't like sushi or wine, where the slightest alteration in ingredient can make or break the dish. You can mix and match until the cows come home, but, in the end, it really boils down to a piece of meat between two buns. Just know who you are.\\n\\nThe confusing set-up, the idea of servers/waitresses that don't get tipped, the blaring music to drown out any and all potential conversation; do you not understand ambience? Or are you merely bombarding us with sensory deprivation and alcohol to hide the fact that we just paid a ridiculous price for burgers and fries? $30.00 for 2 burgers? I'd only pay that much if Emeril was on site and had just blessed them with a BAM!\\n\\nAlso, pull your thumb out of your ass, and get a damn take-out option. Burgers have and always will be a \\"fast\\" food. You may have carried this NY/LA velvet rope charade successfully for a few years thus far, but even dimwitted hipsters will get wise to your act soon enough. If your goal was to become the Studio 54 of burger joints, congratulations. You can accept your trophy alongside Subway becoming the McDonald's of sub sandwiches. And get ready for a knowledge bomb: you do NOT have the best burgers in the universe. Hell, in town, for that matter. So quit trying to rewrite scripture and just have a take-out option. Gourmet schmourmet. They're burgers! If it's a question of affording personnel, fire half of the innumberale \\"waitstaff' wandering the floors aimlessly like lemmings, and hire a fresh set of line cooks. When that day comes, you will have a customer for life. But in this day and age, time is more valuable than appetite. \\n\\nSo, for all of you out there reading this, and considering Hopdoddy, stand fast until they create a take-out option. (FYI, their current \\"take-out\\" option is you waiting in the long-ass line like everyone else, ordering your meal, waiting for it to be made, and then \\"taking\\" it \\"out\\" with you, instead of consuming it on the premises. So technically, it's still \\"take-out,\\" but forget about calling ahead and having it ready for you when you get there, and breezing past the ridiculoudly long line).

Husband and I searched and searched for a new place to try for burgers.  Lucky for us we are 15 minutes away from West Midtown where there is plenty to choose from.  We decided to give FLIP a try.\\n\\nI walked in and was overwhelmed by the sheer chicness of the place.  I'm use to going to burger joints where I leave smelling like what I ate.  It was busy as expected on a Saturday night.  People lined up waiting for tables, but the bar was wide open!  The husband and I head right to the bar and embark on journey with a Red Brick Hoplanta and a PBR.\\n\\nIt was upon arrival to Flip where I realized something about it was familiar.  I couldn't quite put my finger on it.  Then I realized when looking at the menu that these restaurants are owned by Richard Blais, who is pretty much a big deal.  This added to my excitement in burger paradise.\\n\\nI ordered the Oaxaca which comes with avocado, cilantro-lime mayo, queso fresco, and pico de gallo and my husband ordered the Double which is double stack meat, double bacon, white american cheese, onion, pickles and mustard.  We ordered sides of beef fat fries and onion rings to share.\\n\\nI opted not to use my mayo on my burger since I'm not much of a fan of it in the first place.  I have to say that the burger was simply refreshing.  It was the best possible thing I could of ordered on a hot summer evening.  My husband enjoyed his burger beyond words. When I say beyond words, we pretty much ate in silence and enjoyed the experience.  The onion rings are battered to perfection and the beef fat fries are nothing to sneeze at.  All burgers come on a soft brioche bun.\\n\\nOf course, peer pressure from the friendly bartenders influenced us to try one of their shakes.  We opted for the burnt marshmallow Nutella shake.  This shake is a party in my mouth and nobody else is invited.\\n\\nI do have a beef with FLIP.  For the price you pay for the size of the portions, and the quality of beef I would expect it to be a little less.  I was a little disappointed that I had to pay $5 extra for grass fed beef.

On this visit, the vegetables outpointed the proteins, and hot dishes were served cold. On the bright side, our waiter gave us good wine advice, and we enjoyed a glass of light Spanish red.\\n\\nCrab cakes smelled slightly of burnt oil, yet were cold. The kitchen heated them up, but of course that didn't change the smell. Chicken in red wine was covered with a thick, tan sauce that, while not bad, was hard to correlate with red wine. The dish was served at about room temperature, and it would have been far better served hot.\\n\\nBaked winter squash was tasty, as was radicchio-and-beet salad (probably the best thing that night). Endives baked with Gruyere  would have been much better hot, not tepid.\\n\\nBesides the current disappointment, a couple of things about Navarre are beginning to grate. First, it would be nice to have salt on the table, as many dishes are too bland. Certainly the Spanish don't withhold salt (nor do they serve reheated food, in my experience).\\n\\nSecond, the Ken's bread served here is usually burnt. I think Ken makes many outstanding products, and I am NOT a fan of underdone baked goods -- the end of American culture for me, came with \\"soft\\" cookies. Still, burnt is burnt, and burnt bread is not good to eat. It didn't help that when we asked for some unburnt bread, we were told, \\"No, that's the way Ken makes it.\\" Ken is a baker, not a god! Navarre should either tell him to send them proper bread or find another supplier. It was triply galling to notice, as we were leaving, that other tables' bread seemed less burnt than ours.\\n\\nYears ago, on my first visit to Navarre, I had a piece of peach pie that I still dream about. After this visit, it seems the dream is dead. \\n\\nWill we try Navarre again?  Not soon.  Maybe in six months or so -- but only after calling to ask about the bread.

The cream sauce was different that any other place I've ever ordered it. The herbs and spices made it very flavorful. It tasted like a thick masala sauce. It was a different take on the Malai Kofta that I'm used to, but it was a welcomed change. The Tandoori Duck Masala was also very good. The duck was tender and I highly recommend trying this over the Chicken Tikka Masala. Finally, the Goat Curry was the best dish of the night. The goat was on the line and excellent. The curry sauce was absolutely delicious. It was a mouth-watering meal.  The customer service was excellent as well.

This was my first time at The Painted Pin, along with my five other friends that joined us in celebrating my birthday.  From what I have read, it seems like a Sunday afternoon was a great idea to avoid the crowd.  I'm pretty shocked to see that no one has commented on the children in this facility.  I feel that I can't blame the establishment for poor parenting, but something needs to be said about the lack of control these kids have in this place.  All games, except bowling, are free.  Our group decided to start with bocce ball and shuffleboard.  About half way through our game we noticed the kid to adult ratio had quickly changed.  I had to stop and look around as I thought we had accidently walked into a Chuck E Cheese.  We continued to stay in our corner and enjoy food, cocktails and games.  I wasn't too bothered by the kid circus until the parents decided to let them run rampant without supervision.  First, I was accused (from and adult) of stealing the pallino bocce ball from the neighboring court.  There were about 15 kids kicking the bocce balls and running crazy, but he came over in the middle of our game and made the assumption that we took the ball.  I told him that we didn't take it, but he walked over and looked up and down our court like he was going to find it there.   His kid decided that it was more important that they have a pallino ball, so she walked on our court, picked up ours, and took it to their court.  The dad said nothing, but did give us back our ball.  We let that one slide.  We then spent the next hour kicking kids off our court.  There were 4 more instances where kids walked on the green space and took the pellino ball.  One time when a kid just started kicking the balls all over the place.  Where were the parents?  No clue.  Never saw them.  Can I blame the establishment?  Not sure.  I get why parents would bring kids here.  Free babysitting and no need to supervise (in their opinion).  I feel that there are places where this is appropriate, but not here.  I am not saying kids should be banned.  I am saying there needs to be more control in a place like this.  \\n\\nEverything else here was wonderful.  Good food, good drinks, good music.

In spite of a menu consisting of dishes promising bold and intense flavors, the flavors of the dishes we ordered were strangely muted - as if the kitchen (which is open and bustling) had been asked to tone things down for someone's elderly aunt.\\n\\nWe ordered six dishes:\\n\\nBraised pork belly buns -- The pork was cooked perfectly tender with just enough fat remaining.  The problem?  The house pickle and brandy hoisin sauce which popped off the page of the menu were far too mild to cut through the richness of the pork.\\n\\nScallion pancakes -- Light and crispy and, as the menu promises, traditional.\\n\\nSpicy brussels sprouts -- Perfectly roasted to crisp tender, but not at all spicy.  Indeed, they hardly seemed dressed or seasoned at all.  Improved by dipping in the sauce accompanying the scallion pancakes.\\n\\nGenmai fried rice -- Served with a gently poached egg to mix in with the rice, much like a traditional Korean bibimbap, this dish was perfectly prepared but utterly flavorless.  I requested some chili sauce -- they had Sriracha \\"rooster sauce\\" -- which greatly improved the dish.\\n\\nLemony Shrimp dumplings -- These dumplings looked absolutely GORGEOUS on the plate -- perfectly fried and crispy.  However, the shrimp were mushed to a paste thereby losing all texture.  No discernible lemon flavor.\\n\\nTea smoked BBQ spare ribs -- Again, the ribs were perfectly cooked with the succulent meat falling off the bone just by looking at it.  However, the smoke flavor was too understated and sauce brushed on top under-flavored.\\n\\nWe also had two cocktails which were delicious.  Didn't have dessert on account of the homemade oreo cookie -- from Flour bakery -- that I had for lunch.\\n\\nFinal analysis?  Myers + Chang is going to be successful in spite of my grumblings and I'll probably go back to give it another try some time.

It's not only my opinion, but also a collective thought of 4 of my friends. As everybody posted here, the reply and the tone of the manager is very rude. The food was served by the Chef, look so delicious with sizzling sound of the starters straight from the stove in a skillet. As soon as everyone started to taste the food, there was something missing - THE TASTE. I can see food cooked but no taste, no spices, no salt, simply nothing but food, they call it.  We ordered varieties of items from Biryani to Naan and several gravies and yet not even one item was average. Being an Indian, I confidently say that it's too bad to qualify for an Indian food or any other ethnic food for that matter. While the look and feel of the restaurant is on par with the American restaurants, but the main purpose, which is the food, is pathetic, I must say. The cooked unhealthy oil, which I believe supposed to be thrown away, was poured very generously over the gravy, made the food completely unhealthy and everyone's tummy was inflated if not satiated. I'm not an opinionated person and do not have anything personal with this restaurant, but in order to ensure that a restaurant is keeping its standard well by not compromising in health and taste, I'm taking this time to post this review. I'd be more than happy if their money making attitude also considers their customer's health.

I didn't really mind though because they had some nice music playing in the background, and I had a LOT of studying to catch up on (the story of my med student life). The food did take a little while to come out, but when it did... YUM.\\n\\nI ordered the california market special for $15, which is a mix of the vegetable plate along with kitfo and awaze. It came out on a large plate with at least 8 different samples on top of injera bread. The vegetables each had their own unique flavor, and were absolutely delicious. The meat choices were good but weren't at the same level as the vegetables mostly because they were a little on the tough side. It was probably just as well that I was the only one there because the food looked and tasted so good that any eating etiquette I could possibly retain at an Ethiopian restaurant flew out the window. The portion was also large enough that I was stuffed only halfway through the plate.\\n\\nIn general, a nice place to go when you're looking for food that will hit the spot and you aren't in a rush. $15 for a combo might be a little on the pricey side compared to some other Ethiopian places close by, but if you can get 2 meals out of it, I think it's still pretty worth it.

My favorite is the El Diablo which I wish had a little bit more spice but I just love things ridiculously spicy. The fries are crispy deliciousness with a great touch of seasoning.

The food and service are excellent, the location convenient, and the atmosphere is cozy and relaxed.  While the brunch food options are by far the best, you can't beat happy hour prices.  I'd highly recommend Leaky Roof for anyone looking for great food in a casual setting with no wait.\\n\\nWikipedia defines a gastropub as \\"a bar and restaurant that serves high-end beer and food without pretension\\" and this is exactly what you'll get at the Leaky Roof.  Located in Goose Hollow, the restaurant is easily accessible and street parking is readily available; this is a nice change from many of the Sunday brunch spots in downtown Portland.\\n\\nUpon entering the restaurant, there is a small bar area off to the left (small, quaint, and with an \\"Irish Pub\\" feel to it).  The main dining room is also fairly small but extremely cozy with a roaring 3-sided fireplace, several booths, and a few tables which can be pushed together for larger parties.  During happy hour, the place gets extremely crowded due to the great prices and food.  Conversely, brunch is still relatively new to the Leaky Roof which could explain why I've never had any problems getting a seat on Saturday/Sunday mornings.\\n\\nI first visited the Leaky Roof as I live in the neighborhood and had walked past the place a few times, seeing advertisements that they were now open Saturday and Sunday for brunch.  I'm a huge fan of brunch in Portland but I absolutely HATE the long lines and wait times that generally go along with brunch downtown; the Leaky Roof seemed like a wonderful alternative.  The brunch menu at LR includes the usual suspects (i.e. omelets, pancakes, waffles, breakfast sandwiches, etc.) but there are a few menu items which in my opinion set it a cut above the rest.  The chicken n' waffles ($12.95) is one of the more expensive menu items but is well worth the cost with perfectly crispy battered chicken breast served atop a made-from scratch Belgian waffle that is quite possibly the best I've ever had.  I'm also a fan of the Irish Benedict ($9.50) which differs from the traditional eggs benedict in that it comes topped with home-made corned beef and literally melts in your mouth.  The biscuits and gravy and huevos rancheros with bacon are probably the best value for money at only $8.95 each.  To round out the experience, you can also order a $3 mimosa or $5 bloody mary.\\n\\nHappy hour is also a huge hit at the Leaky Roof.  Food prices are ridiculously cheap ($2.95 for a small serving of Guinness beef stew, $3.95 for a burger and fries, $3.95 for a pulled pork quesadilla are just a few examples) and there is a fantastic wine and beer list to top it all off.  I wouldn't recommend dinner as readily as brunch and happy hour as it gets a little pricey; however, it's still a good choice if you're in the area.  There is some limited outdoor seating when the weather permits and it is dog friendly.  The few times we've sat outside with our dogs, the owner has personally come out with a slice of bacon for each of them...it's the kind of personal touch that makes you want to keep coming back to a place!\\n\\nOverall, the Leaky Roof is a great little restaurant/pub.  It provides good food at reasonable prices and is a must if you are anywhere near the Goose Hollow area."},{"name":"Phara's Mediterranean Cuisine","address":"111 E North Loop Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Love this little dive.

After wedging sugar packets under the table feet to keep it from moving and spilling our coffee, we ordered. No matter how much we tried, we simply were not comfortable at our tiny table for a full meal and 4 people. My buddy asked our waiter if we could perhaps move to one of the larger empty tables that surrounded us, and he said \\"sure\\" and pointed us to another that might suit us better.\\n\\nAs we gathered up our stuff, the original apathetic hostess then came over and interrupted the move and told us \\"sorry...you guys will have to stay here\\". My buddy then said, \\"sorry, it appears that we're the only 4 top sitting a table this small and would like to move\\". Amazingly, the hostess argued with him and explained there was, in fact, one more 4-top sitting at one as small as ours. I almost exploded....but mostly because I own a small business and if I saw one of my employees literally correct and argue with a client over something so trivial, especially given the fact that there were many empty tables, that person would be fired on the spot.

Their Kheer is good too, but Kheer is not a dish for everyone.  If you do not like tapioca because of its texture, you won't like this.  It's basically a sweet rice pudding with some raisins, nuts, cinnamon and cardoman spices in it.  It's tasty, but it's not for everybody.\\n\\nNaans (breads):\\nIndian food is all about the naans.  It's hard to pick a bad naan at this place.  Basically you use the naan to scoop up rice and leftover sauces from your dish.   If you want to be \\"safe\\" get the three cheese naan.  The garlic and basil naan is good too.\\n\\nI've been to their lunch buffet once, and it was pretty good.  It was for my first trip to the Clay Pit, and I wasn't feeling very adventurous.  I mostly stuck with the tandoori chicken and the chicken curry.  I tried the Kheer, and found myself pleasantly surprised at the fact that I liked it.\\n\\n\\nThey also specialize in their mango drinks, and they're quite tasty.  If you get a spicy dish, a mango drink helps counterbalance the heat."},{"name":"Schmidt's Sausage Haus","address":"240 E Kossuth St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Went back for another family meal during German Village Christmas Lights - Awesome!!!

(costs extra to ride)  There is mulled wine for $10 if you want to keep the dollar store mug it comes in, or $6 if you don't.   \\nThe atmosphere is nice, but after 20 minutes there's nothing left to see or do.  That's including grabbing a mulled wine and something to eat. \\nThe booths are selling the exact same thing you've seen at every Vancouver market,  lots of hand made soaps, candles and such.  Sooo many hand made soaps.  There are a few booths selling German beer steins ($$$) and some very expensive Christmas ornaments."},{"name":"Blue Star Donuts","address":"1155 SW Morrison St, Ste 102","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Blueberry Bourbon was fantastic!

Meat and bread certainly perked my ears up. So I started searching around Yelp and asking questions of those in the know. Now I've got 8 bookmarks for \\"must-try\\" banh mi.\\n\\nAmazingly, this wasn't one of them! This was my first banh mi experience. It appeared to be very traditional based on the descriptions I've seen. However traditional or not it might have been, what it was was delicious! \\n\\nWe got the pork and the chicken and split them so we could try both. We also asked the owner which was his favorite smoothie flavor to which he replied \\"Mango\\". Good choice sir, good choice.\\n\\nThe bread was slightly crusty but not too crusty if you know what I mean. The meat was tender, the veggies and cilantro were fresh and the buttery homemade sauce just made the flavor of the sandwich. Now I finally understand why people go on so about banh mi.\\n\\nThe smoothie had a lightly fresh mango flavor and wasn't overwatery. It was quite thick but not so thick you couldn't slurp it up quickly enough to get brain freeze (I did). I can't wait to try this place again and get a different flavor!\\n\\nN&H Saigon Sub I will forever be grateful for taking my banh mi virginity. Even if I find another I love more, you will always have a special place in my heart. Also, although you're cheap, don't let anyone make you feel unworthy for being that way!
