I told them that I had called multiple times, and no apologies just we don't answer the phone just leave a message. What's up with that? I have never heard of a restaurant that doesn't answer the phone? Also, the bathroom was dirty,and used as a storage room. The restaurant had an 80's retro feel to it with the music playing. Also, a very cramped place.  I guess when your an excellent restaurant like Yuzu you don't have to answer the phone, and or have a sign so people can find the restaurant.\\n\\n   Now, I will address the ramen it was quite excellent. I had the Kakuni ramen it was very flavorful,and they give you a big bowl. Although, I did think that the Kakuni ramen was a bit on the salty side. The potstickers were flavorful, and one can tell they are made with a lot of pride. With all the hype,and how great I heard yuzu I felt a bit disappointed. I thought it was very good, but not quite as good as the hype I had heard. I would definitely  go back, although it was a bit crowded,cramped,and claustrophobic.

Super friendly, courteous and very apologetic for everyone else's actions. She bought all of our drinks which was 3 rounds of drinks. Although we got a free queso, it was terrible. Tasted like can cheese with ground meat in it. Simply terrible. Vivica continued to make sure we where good and took care of us very well. I ordered fajita salad and it was good.  My husband ordered a carne guisada burrito and that was crap. He sent it back because it was shredded chicken. The manager, I think, came to tell him that those burritos are premade and cannot be custom made. Well it has been done before but maybe this was with the previous owners. So they offered to get him something else. At this point my husband was just fed up with the service. So he said no thank you. Vivica our waitress said come on order what you want it's on me.

The wings came in three sizes: 4, 6, or 8 pieces. It also came in three different flavors. We only tried the soy garlic and do recommend this flavor. The chicken was crispy and the flavor was very good. I was not impressed by the saut√©ed beef tongue however. First off, it's not a dish for everyone and secondly, it does not help serving it pink! Sorry if I grossed anyone out. I hope you survived to the next paragraph. \\n\\nWe tried the spicy Tonkatsu ramen. I have had better ramen in Harvard Square and Porter Square so its very hard for this bowl of ramen to even receive a passing grade. The broth was not flavorful despite the claim that it took over 12 hours to cook. And at $14, an additional side of pork slices brought the ramen close to $20. \\n\\nFor hot pot, we had the seafood platter with the spicy Szechuan broth. The seafood were very fresh and the portion was fair for a hefty price tag of $35 not including broth. The platter came with a small basket vegetables and mushrooms, and your choice of either rice or noodle. The broth was well not as flavorful as other hot pot restaurants I have tried. For one person, you can easily spend $40 for a set and for the broth. The one good thing that I have to come back and try is the restaurants meat selection. Again, hefty price tags that go over $50 easily. My biggest complaint though was that there was no ladle for the broth and nothing other than the chopstick and a small soup spoon to cook and retrieve the food with. \\n\\nThe soup dumplings took 15 minutes to make and the waiter did notify us of this wait time. I wished they had timed it better by bringing this out before our main entrees arrived. And I must say that I have had better soup dumplings in Chinatown also. There were nothing particularly special about the ones served here. The dough was thicker and the dumplings miniature in comparison with what I am used to. Also there was not much soup on the inside. However, I do like the fact that the restaurant steamed the dumplings on top of cabbage leaves. And I also like how the restaurant very thinly sliced the ginger that was in the vinegar dipping sauce. \\n\\nOverall, very pricey, which I don't usually mind if the food blew me away but it did not. The food was lacking in flavors in almost all the items we tried. Unfortunately I will not be coming back anytime soon.

It didn't have the flare of Olivia with creative breakfast dishes, but hey, that's what 'proper English breakfast' is (the Brits not really known for creative, robust foods).

The pros are they have an interesting backdrop and concept, albeit tightly packed and in a semi-transitional area.  The cons are the breakfast items I tried (eggs, fried tomato, fried toast, fried egg, fried mushroom, British bacon that is actual ham, and coffee and juice) were all decent, but not too impressive.  The service was average... no one exactly coming around asking you how your food is or telling you to enjoy your meal.  More like a fast food joint in that sense (you also order at the front, so not really a wait staff).

Sweet Cheeks definitely delivered.  \\n\\nMy friend is a photographer for the Improper Bostonian, and he photographed the food at Sweet Cheeks a few months ago and got to taste test it all.  He couldn't wait to tell us about the wooden tables tops made from old bowling alley lanes or the take out options. We were all too full to eat dessert, but he highly suggested the nutter butter.

Do what these people have done! Where to begin with what a disaster it is? With the biggest problem, and that is how long you have to wait for food to arrive at your table on Thursday, Friday, or Saturday nights.  How about one hour and 25 minutes? Does that sound reasonable to you? Not to me either! At least three tables around us walked out, after varying stages of their wait, some after drinks, some after the appetizer, and some before receiving even bread and butter. The table next to us who was seated at the same time we were, simply gave up and said they would never come back again, this was the second time it happened to them. The wait staff gets stuck being the middleman between the management and the customer, definitely no fun for them. And why is there such a wait? It's very simple: the cooking area/open kitchen is too small for how big the restaurant is. At their previous location, the seating capacity was approximately 36 people. At this new location, the seating capacity is approximately 140 diners, and guess what? The kitchen is practically the exact same size as the one in the old location. Go figure! What the heck were they thinking?! The poor cooks don't have a second to breathe. And even if more were hired, there's no room or burners or grill space for them to cook on anyway. Again, what the heck were they thinking?! Whoever is managing this place seems clueless about how to run a restaurant. There is no degree whatsoever of professionalism, genuine concern or chagrin, or even basic courtesy. Someone who called himself a manager, when we called him over to the table as he passed by us, actually had the nerve to tell us that \\"our meals were up next.\\"  He also used the very lame excuse that soon the restaurant would be getting a computerized system for taking orders, and that the waitstaff had to write out orders by hand in the meantime. As if this were the cause of the problem... Ridiculous. This was approximately 35 minutes after our appetizer was finished. Another 15 minutes later our waitress came over to see if we were OK and apologized. Another five or 10 minutes later she came back and said \\"good news, your slip is the fourth one now. So you will get your food soon\\".  Interesting communication on the part of the manager, who told us an outright lie, while the waitress, at least, was honest about it all. And to get back to the lack of savoir-faire on the part of the management, nobody ever offered us a salad or another appetizer while we were waiting, or a drink or dessert, nor did they comp a single thing on the check, or offer a gift card for future use. Actually, the manager not only did not apologize, he simply never followed up at all, maybe he was embarrassed. He certainly should have been. A total mess! Speaking of which, the physical layout of one side of the place is chaotic. It is not welcoming in the least, and the haphazard array of the tables is very unappealing. Did somebody planning it think it was attractive? It is not. And the icing on the cake, it was also freezing on that ugly side of the dining area. Lots of people were complaining about the lack of heat, because, of course, when you are hungry, and growing tired, as your wait for your food approaches and then surpasses one hour, and you still haven't eaten, the cold environment feels even worse. And what a joke, too, there is a DJ! I love music, but the food and the service are much more important. They don't need a DJ, they need a bigger kitchen, and more chefs, otherwise, the wait on busy nights will never improve. I read a few months ago that Victor passed away. I can only imagine that he is rolling over in his grave, for whoever is running the place now has their priorities all wrong, and that is truly a shame, because the food, once it finally came, as before, was truly delicious..."},{"name":"Toasted","address":"1945 Aloma Ave","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4","text":"The southern comfort burger should be illegal in at least 7 states.

And for me, Uchi was this past relationship.  I thought it was the best that I could have, but it came with conditions.  It came with long waits, with a small waiting area, it's a little too high stress with the amount of people waiting with you, high stress because you feel like you can't just roll up in yesterday's jeans and t-shirt because the yuppies's are going to look at you funny.  Like you weren't goo enough.   You were one of those yuppies.  But sometimes, you just want to be able to show up in your dirty jeans.  Eat some kick ass sushi.  Enjoy it without it's pretension, with the expectation of what you should look like when you get there.   \\n\\nAnd Musashino?  It's damn good.  They know who they are.  They stand on the quality of their food.  It's not flashy.  It's honest.  It's confident.  It's good to you.

It's a busy place, order at the counter, find a table, no problem there.  Decor is interesting but furniture is old and a bit dirty looking, especially the sofas.  Table was tacky and crumby.  We ordered English breakfasts and a bacon roll, with sides of beans, and a pot of tea to go with it.\\n\\nThe bacon was fine but over cooked, the roll was, for some strange reason, 'fried' in the bacon grease on one side of each piece of roll.  BTW sweet burger buns are not the right bread for a bacon sandwich - ever!  A true Brit is looking for a bread roll that is not sweet and the bacon should be cooked but not crispy, that's an American bacon thing.  The bacon was missing it's tail as well, so it was more like Canadian bacon but tasted ok.\\n\\nThe beans were a meagre bowl for a hefty price - a tin of Heinz beans from HEB costs about $2.50 and we got a 1/4 of a can for that price.  \\n\\nThe full English breakfasts were fried to oblivion and very oily.  The toast that came with the breakfasts was fried instead of toasted.  Hot tea was like oil and when I asked for a seperate pot of hot water I was told I couldn't have it but  that I could bring the pot up for a refill as many times as I wanted - but couldn't get water to dilute the strong tea that I had.\\n\\nOne thing that bothered me was that the folks working in there had hair hanging down over the food.

I'm not talking the specific model, of course; fast causal burger and shake places far pre-date Shake Shack. But in terms of the actual color schemes and physical look and feel of the space, BurgerFi is far from original. The process is basic: you order at a counter with options aplenty, a few minutes pass and the food is ready. See, that's not so hard, is it? BurgerFi, based out of Florida and with locations across the country, has the premise that they set themselves apart with different topping options from their competitors. That may be true, with options like neon relish, salt and vinegar chips and Peter Luger steak sauce all optional add-ons; some are free, some are an extra dollar. Pre-arranged burgers are limited (with a \\"secret\\" menu also available if you are in the know) to fairly normal options, and the menu is rounded out with the usual fries, onion rings, sodas, concretes and custards. \\n\\nI opted for a single cheeseburger with neon relish, Peter Luger steak sauce, cry and fries (an onion rings and fry combo) and a red velvet shake. The bun, with an imprinted logo of BurgerFi, is a soggy, wasteland of an end product. It's not a classic, squishy potato roll you may be expecting, but a sad, state of affairs grocery store bun one would be hard pressed to pass off to guests at a backyard barbecue. Needless to say it's a mushy mess and a cheap and poor choice at that. The patty, however, is actually quite appealing, at least based on the scene and parameters at play. It's your classic Angus beef, but a clear step up from the massive burger chains we all grew up with, but still not on the level of higher end fast casual burger spots, namely Shake Shack and Flat Patties. The seasoning is fine and although quite thin, the couple of bites it took me to gobble it all down wasn't a huge misfire. I suspect doubling the beef/patty is probably the way to go in the future. Melted American cheese is gooey, one of the dominant flavors and totally works. Neon relish is a wacky, as promised, bright green and acidic relish with personality. The color is unnatural but who the hell cares; it's got a nice zip and for a free add-on, I'm not mad at it. Peter Luger steak sauce (I've never had it, always been curious) comes on the side and is rather skimpy, especially for the extra dollar, is basically a horseradish heavy ketchup. Normally I'm not a lettuce and tomato guy on my burger, but for free filler I'd probably recommend the added vegetation to once again at least attempt a Shake Shack imitation. Fries are woefully under-seasoned but sort of crispy, and massive onion rings (like the size of a hubcap massive) are visually stunning but are not fried properly. You essentially receive half of a friggin' onion, but they aren't cooked long enough so it's all grease, raw onion and slippery batter. The shake is fine and filling, not worth the trip on its own but serviceable by shake and custard standards.\\n\\nBurgerFi isn't trying to do much, if anything different, it's merely another burger chain in a long line of ordinary burger chains. The beef is a step up from 5 Guys and McDonald's I'd say, but \\"different\\" toppings and mediocre sides are not enough to warrant much of a recommendation or a return visit."},{"name":"Meianna Bakery","address":"2850 SE 82nd Ave, Unit 27","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"If the names Honey Senpai or Mei Tachibana are familiar to you, I think you will love this place.

Not only was it delicious it was also beautiful to look at.   But to be honest, most of the cakes in the cases at Freddies, Safeway and Albertsons are easy on the eyes, but the flavors are painful, like expecting fried chicken but getting canned chicken instead, this happened to me once, what a bitterly disappointing experience.\\n\\nAnyways the cake layers were light and airy, a delicate Japanese sponge, the likes of which I was only able to replicate in my kitchen during a mild autumn evening.  The strawberries were perfectly ripe and tangy, the perfect accompaniment to the sweet cream filling.\\n\\nWe tried two other breads, one was a melon bread something I've wanted to try for a very long time.  It's called melon bread because of the way it looks not because it tastes like melon.  The bread was lightly chewy and had  the distinctive sweet melon looking layer cooked on the top.    I wasn't sure I would like this because it reminded me a bit of conchas, the breads typical of mexican bakeries.  I grew up in California and have tried over a dozen conchas and have decided that I just really, really hate them.  But the melon bread wasn't terribly sweet and didn't have gritty sugary layer of a concha.\\n\\nThe last thing we got was a bread filled with a cheese custard, honestly I don't know what it was called and next to the strawberry cake, I liked it the best.  It had the same bread as the melon bread, but was filled with a sweet cheesy custardy mix.  I know, custardy isn't  a word, but calling it a melange of cheesy delight is a bit over the top.\\n\\nOther people have mentioned poor service, but I thought the service was fine, they even gave us a fork and very carefully packaged the delicate slice of cake.\\n\\nI'd go here again."},{"name":"Newtowne Variety","address":"93 Windsor St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4.5","text":"Stopped in for lunch after reading all the good reviews.

We were looking for something different and found ourselves here one evening for the all-you-can-eat buffet. The first thing we noticed when we walked in was the lively atmosphere. There were traditionally-dressed Samba dancers at the far end dancing up a storm - the dinner crowd was really into it. We were seated a fair distance from the small stage but the dancers walked around later for photo ops.\\n\\nNow, onto the food. I confess that I enjoy meat - probably more than the average guy. I believe that if it moves, you can eat it. I quite enjoy trying more exotic types of meat - kangaroo, camel, alligator, snake. I would actually be interested in trying even weirder things... grasshopper, chocolate covered ants, fried spiders... but I digress. The selling feature of Rio is HOW the meat is served. BBQed meat is brought around on giant swords and sliced at your table. We had big helpings of beef, lamb, pork, chicken, hearts (yes, hearts) and sausage. While I enjoyed the novelty of their distribution methods, the food quality was just mediocre. The beef was well cooked and juicy but the pork and chicken were dry, and the sausage a tad on the salty side. What I really enjoyed was the grilled pineapple (sprinkled with cinnamon) which also came on a sword - this was oddly delicious and was certainly the highlight of the evening. There was also a self-serve buffet area which consisted of a salad and pasta bar. The salad bar was quite fresh with a wide variety of items but I wasn't here for that. The pasta bar was just okay and didn't really tempt me to get seconds.\\n\\nAll in all, we had a good time at Rio but we enjoyed the atmosphere more than the food. What the food lacks in quality is made up with quantity. At $30 for dinner, it's not the best deal but may be worth checking out if you're really hungry.

I had brazilian rodizio restaurants in Houston and other cities before and so far Fogo de Chau ranks #1 on my list.  I was very excited to take my family there since they had not tried it.  I was very very disappointed.  The meats were not marinated.  The lamb had such a aweful game taste to it.  The chicken, the sirloin, etc were all tasteless.  All the meats were overcooked, not like Fogo and other brazilian restaurants which bring out a skewer with different cooking levels for customers to choose.  Also the skewers came out not frequent enough.  We sat at the middle section of the restaurant and every time the server brought out a skewer, he went to one end of the restaurant.  By the time he came around to our table, often times we didn't get any or there were only 3-4 pieces left then we had to wait for a while to get another skewer and of course, the same thing happened.  They didn't have enough varieties of meat either.  We were all disappointed for $32 per person.  We would never visit Rio again and would not recommend this to anyone.  The two stars I gave here were for the beautiful brazilian dancers who entertained us and the OK salad bar.  At the end of the dinner, we liked the grilled pineapple the most (not because it was grilled in a special way; it's just because we didn't get any satisfaction from the meat so we could only resort to something that taste ok), very sad ! My nephew had waited for the sausage for a second round.  He finally got two links but they were very very undercooked.  We asked them to microwave them so he could finish the sausages then go home but the server checked with someone in the kitchen and told us they could not microwave but could only grill them again which would take 10 minutes.  By that time, we just had enough disappointment and said \\"forget it\\".  It was total disappointing experience.

At 7:10, I was still waiting. When my pizza was actually completed, the salads that I ordered as sides had been forgotten so that meant another 10 minutes of waiting. When my order was complete and I was walking my now cold pizza to my vehicle, staff members came running out to tell me that they had given me the wrong pizza. The clerk inspected the box and said \\"oh no, that's yours\\" so I loaded it in the truck and started to leave. As I was leaving, yet another staff member flagged me down and said that in point of fact, I did have someone else's pizza and I would have to wait for mine to be made. All of this meant that I was rolling out of there with my order almost an hour after my pre-arranged pick up time.

I learned about it from my Chinese classmates (exchange students) who are homesick of home-cooked food. I've asked every Chinese expat I've met and they all go to Canton Cooks for a taste of home. My family has close ties with the OCA (Organization of Chinese-Americans) in Georgia for many years now and the members all go here. This place is the best Chinese restaurant in the city. Period.\\n\\nA regional/ethnic restaurant is only as good as its chef. I don't care how \\"nice\\" the owners are -- if the chef isn't authentic, the food won't be. To appreciate the great Cantonese cooking here, you must order from the Chinese menu. That's how my family eats Chinese (you know, when in Rome...) Having said that, here are my family's favorite dishes at Canton Cooks.\\n\\nNo visit of ours is complete without the Beef with Bitter Melons in Black Bean Sauce. Let me warn you, this is an acquired taste for the non-Chinese or the non-initiated. I grew up eating this kind of authentic food so I love it. It's a bitter-salty combination of slices of bitter melon in black bean sauce. Delicious!\\n\\nThe Salted Fish Fried Rice here is so good. Just like at Penang's they use big flakes of dried, salted fish here. The saltiness of the fish is tempered by the blandness of the rice. Really, this is already a meal in itself.\\n\\nThe Dragon Soup is a magnificent soup. It has winter melon and slices of tender chicken in a clear broth with egg whites stirred in. Add the shrimp paste (available by request) and you have a hearty, comforting soup.\\n\\nWe love the Ono Choy in Garlic Sauce. Ono Choy is a foot-long weed that grows in swamps in Asia. It is called straw vegetable in English due to its hollow body. This vegetable grows year round but I haven't seen it in Atlanta for a couple of years now. When not available, a good substitute is the snow pea leaves. I prefer Ono Choy because of its crunch. Still, they're both delicious.\\n\\nFor noodles, we always get the crispy noodles topped with brown gravy, meat/seafood, and Chinese broccoli. Let the noodles soak in the gravy for a minute or two and you get this saucy noodles which is so flavorful.\\n\\nMy mom, sister, and I love crabs so much that we have to get two orders of the whole fried live crabs every time we visit. If you've never had fried crabs, I suggest you go now. It is heavenly.\\n\\nWe've eaten though the entire Chinese menu at Canton Cooks and every single dish is superb. It's like eating in China and Hongkong. If you want authentic Cantonese food then you must go here. Service can be slow during peak times and service is typical of China -- you have to flag them if you need something. Still, the food makes up for it. Even if you order from the American menu, food is extremely good."},{"name":"Canton Cook II","address":"6690 Roswell Rd NE, Ste 410","city":"Sandy Springs","stars":"4","text":"If you are looking for some authentic Canto-Chinese, Family style cooking, Canton Cook II is probably the best place in town (definitely up there, or maybe better than what's in China town these days)!\\n\\nIt's been a few many years, but when I was growing up, my family would often go to Canton Cooks, also on Roswell Rd, but closer to i-285, but now we go to Canton Cook II (I think it is owned by the brother of the lady that owns Canton Cooks). We go there because it's closer, and in our opinion, this is the best in town.\\n\\nExpect a traditional style meal.

You should order some tea, and you will get bottomless white rice to go with your meal.\\n\\nI am a big fan of a lot of their dishes.

Best with some white pepper, and a splash of red vinegar\\n * Snow pea leaves - not always available, but a great accompanying dish when it is\\n * Fried noodles with seafood sauce (Chow Mein) - We request the sauce and fried noodles be served separately\\n * Roasted duck - not quite HK BBQ style. It has its own unique and good taste\\n * Steamed or fried fish- ask what's good. This has never been a dissapointment\\n * Ong Choy (with fermented tofu) - Just the right amount of salt and spice\\n * Beef Lo Mein - one of my comfort food classics\\n * Salt and Pepper Squid - Fried just right and seasoned well. Get them while they are hot!\\n * Stir fried clams - Good in black bean sauce\\n * Cantonese Style Fried Lobster - Sometimes they are running a deal on 2.

The noodles also require the work of stirring in the beginning to get them unstuck, but I suppose that's why the food comes out so quickly.

The smell is familiar, pungent and inescapable; you recognize equal parts back yard barbecue and pancake breakfast when suddenly your stomach moans like a creaky old house.  Hunger, oh man!  You just walked up to Centro, and it's Cinco de Mayo.  How did this happen?\\n\\nYou've heard about Dave Query's Big Red F Restaurant Group, right?  It includes Jax Fish House, Zolo Grill, West End Tavern, and Lola...but where does Centro fit in Query's quiver?  Well, it's located in what was formerly home to the Boulder Bagel Bakery and Abo's Pizza in the 90's, so it has a food-related foundation. By the early 2000's it had been converted to a lively bar--Rhumba--which, by-the-way, had an eclectic, Caribbean menu rich in plantains, rice, and jerk flavored dishes, leavened by potent mojitos made fresh.  Honestly, neither my friends nor I ate there much, preferring to focus on the people-meeting aspect of the sweet, open-air environment instead.  Frankly, we treated it as a tequila soaked petting zoo, with nocturnal visiting hours.  Fast-forward to 2015 and Centro carries on the tradition of a friendly bar, but now the food is creating the major buzz.  With that in mind, this writer went with a small band of chums to actually sit inside and eat.  Here's how it went:\\n\\nWe licked our salted hands, tilted our heads back and opened our throats like baby birds, and afterwards limes were sucked. Sure we were there for the food, and the El Tesora Tequila Anejo probably should have been sipped not shot, but some traditions die slowly.  With a tequila so smooth, the crying, punched in the face reaction you often see following a shooter is rare, and any tears are shed only from joy. The Tesora stoked our now ravenous appetites: it was Cinco de Mayo, Centro was en fuego, and the fiesta was on! It felt like Pamplona, minus the bulls and the horrible, bloody goring.\\n\\nBut let's not get off on the wrong hoof.  Centro's head chef, Dakota Coburn, is truly enjoying his turn at the grill, not at all quavering in the shadow of famous Red F alum, Hosea Rosenburg.  Though it was Cinco de Mayo (celebrating the 1862 victory of the underdog Mexican army over French forces in the Battle of Puebla) and Coburn was cranking out some special Cinco Pig Roast dishes--including pork tamales, poblano enchiladas and spicy pork tacos with tomatillo salsa for the occasion--we also feasted on fare available year round.\\n\\nWe tore into the previously mentioned platter of tamales, tacos and enchiladas, but also pickled ramps (from the pepper family), classic huevos rancheros from the brunch menu, a zingy guac with avocado chunks the size of a baby's fist, a bowl of mussels and clams in a bitingly spicy chorizo beer broth (too lethal for 3 out of 4 of us), a cluster of brown chicharrones snapping and crackling from the fryer, and more, but our favorites were oddly idiosyncratic and simple:  the 'street corn' which was a perfectly grilled cobb slathered with an intoxicating aioli and crumbly Mexican queso; the simply named Avocado and Radish Salad, whose watermelon radishes were as beautiful on the plate as they were tasty in the food hatch; and, finally, the Tres Leches cake, which combines fresh berries (straw, in our case) with butter, whipped cream and something called rum brittle.  Four spoons, four seconds and...gone; vamanos!  If we hadn't been so abarrotados with carne de cerdo, chips, margaritas and whatnot, we would have ordered another round of the wondrous cake.  Bottom line with the food was that it was mostly amazing, largely local, variable in spice content and infused with mucho amor.\\n\\nAlthough the fine folks at Centro invited me knowing that I write reviews, we saw identical looking dishes arrive at other tables, and we heard the same satisfied groans and frenzied chomping all around us. In other words, we ate what everyone else was eating.  Sure, we were met by the gracious, fedora-wearing manager, Jessy Casado, who was charming and eager to please, and it's true that we had tableside visits from Mr. Coburn to explain the food, as these were perks orchestrated by Big Red F, which surely knows how to schmooze a food blogger. However, the truth is, these guys have something to brag about.  They put tons of thought into every decision, from sourcing their meats to greeting their customers.  They are ruthless at improving their brand and their product, muchacho, which makes it better for all of us...the ripe, crispy-skinned hogs among us notwithstanding.\\n \\nSo, can you still meet a lovely at the all-season bar?  Can you drink more than you or a small army of Irish longshoremen should?  Yes, of course, but now you can have an intelligent conversation over some of the finest Mexican cuisine in Boulder, and live to both remember AND tell the tale"},{"name":"Sinju Japanese Restaurant","address":"7339 SW Bridgeport Rd","city":"Tigard","stars":"3","text":"I've been to this restaurant several times and largely with great results.

My boyfriend ordered the combo plate with pork belly, steak, and fish. Unfortunately it all came out cold. My soup came out piping hot and was unexpected as I did not realize I had ordered soup as the dish stated it was assorted vegetables with noodles and then crab and other seafood. Given that crab is the first descriptor in the dish I expected it to be there, I asked my waitress about that after I had gotten my meal. She said that crab is no longer in the dish and that the menu had not been updated for a long time. Given that that was the first line item in the meal I would've preferred to know it prior to ordering my dish.

On Sunday, July 9, my wife, daughter and I were preparing to leave Austin after a long weekend. We met one of my daughter's close college friends (she lives in Austin and drove over the meet us) for a \\"quick\\" brunch at Winflo on 6th Street.\\n\\nIt was among the poorest restaurant experiences I have had in many, many years, in any American city. The place came highly recommended: we were excited to sample the food and take in the ambiance (a cool old house with a quaint feel). \\n\\nWe arrived shortly before Noon and were 4 of the only people in the main restaurant (Winflo has outdoor seating, but in early July, we decided it was too hot for us).  \\n\\nTwo in our party ordered Mimosas (pretty sort of standard Sunday brunch fare, right?) only to be informed by the hostess: \\"We're out of Mimosas\\" (she substituted Prosecco for champagne).  Unfortunately, that was only the beginning. We ordered pretty quickly then sat quietly as our food was delayed for more than an hour and 20-minutes. It was near comical as we watched nearly every table served (including someone alone at the bar) even though we arrived well before the vast majority of the others.\\n\\nThree different restaurant employees gave us at least three separate stories as to why the wait was so long. \\"We have a party of 15 outside,\\" \\"Sure,\\" \\"It's on the way,\\" and finally -- \\"It's being plated right now\\" (20 minutes later the food showed up in spurts - basically one order at a time. Then, when all of the orders finally arrived (two orders of pancakes, shrimp and grits, and a couple of eggs over easy with two patties of rather tasteless sausage patties and cold toast), the food was bland, a bit cold and not very tasty. I would have seasoned it up, however there was no salt and pepper on our table.\\n\\nFinally, a young woman whispered (and I mean whispered so low that I couldn't understand her at all in the quiet setting) that the owner wanted to comp our meal (I think that's what she said - honesty, I just didn't understand her). Nevertheless, I paid the $70 tab, with a 15% tip, and wrote it off to bad experience. No one was rude, just completely indifferent to our group. Needless to say, Winflo was a real letdown and on probation. I truly hope things improve - it looks like it could be a terrific place.

Please learn to cook your food so that the rice doesn't taste like it came from an Uncle Ben package. I received an email from the manager, saying they would have discounted drinks and enchiladas all day. Lucky for me, my boyfriend already said I could get as tipsy as I wanted, since I gave him the same courtesy on St. Patrick's Day (maybe we should find less degenerate ways to celebrate our ethnicities?). We came at around 7 pm, and things started off on a bad note when the hostess said she would be right with us, and clearly forgot about us for about 10 minutes. Idk where she was at. She finally greeted us and took our name because she saw me heading to the other hostess stand. \\n\\nWe went to the bar, since we would have a bit of a wait, and I ordered a margarita and my boyfriend ordered a mexican martini. The bar was SLAMMED. No problem - I figured as much would happen. However, I didn't figure that they would be only two bartenders, and that we would be made to feel bad for ordering the drinks they had on special. The female bartender was obviously frazzled, and in a quick exchange, my boyfriend's drink was spilled on the receipt printer. She made a pretty big deal about it, making a point to clean it so obviously, like he should feel guilty for that accident. \\n\\nLuckily, a server led us to an open table, and said someone would be right with us. We waited.. and waited. We both finished our drinks before the server came to greet us. In her defense, she did offer queso or guacamole to make up for it. We took her up on the guac, because the last time we came we had spinach queso and it was plastic and rubbery. I took one bite and didn't touch it again. So, it takes quite some time for the guacamole to come out as well. We finally order, and again, it takes forever. He had the sour cream enchiladas, and I had the Santa Fe. We split them and had one of each. I only needed a bite of each to know I didn't like either. The only good part of my meal was that it came with a sunny-side up egg. Seriously. An egg was the best part of my Mexican meal. I ended up giving my plate to my boyfriend, and despite the fact that HE likes anything, he didn't eat the rice either. \\n\\nAs you can imagine, it took a while to get the check and pay for it. I used to think 99 cent margaritas were a good enough reason to come here, but honestly, there are so many BETTER places, for drinks, food, and service.

Let Lure, the latest seafood concept from Fifth Group Restaurants, take you out for a night on the high seas for an amazing culinary adventure.\\n\\nSince they opened within a month of each other and both feature seafood, there have been a lot of comparisons to The Optimist. In my opinion, while The Optimist invokes the feeling of beachside dining, with Lure I feel like I'm on a ship that is stopping at exotic ports and offering up different takes on traditional seafood cuisine.\\n\\nStarters are a must and there are some great options on the menu. Plates to share include the smoked seafood platter that features cold-smoked salmon with cucumber, cape bluefish with pickled beets and cr√®me fraiche, rainbow trout pat√© with boiled egg and horseradish. I also really enjoyed the chilled seafood platter peel-and-eat shrimp, salmon tartare, ceviche, whelks, and crab crudo.\\n\\nThe decor features dark woods, antique brass accents and really makes you feel like you're about to go hunting for Moby Dick, but with very cool cocktails and delicious Tom Yum Shrimp Bisque to warm your belly.\\n\\nThe Asian influences are a great complement to the food and drink menus, but I wouldn't consider this Asian fusion by any stretch. The Shochu drink menu, Punch Bowls and Prosecco on tap are unique and inspired. Other great items on the menu to share that I loved were the French Horn Mushrooms, the Fried Oyster Sliders and the Grilled Octopus & Pork Lettuce Wraps.\\n\\nGreat atmosphere, killer menu, original ideas with their drink offerings definitely equals a big dining success in my book.

I've experienced better\\" describes it. My date and I went to Davide because we saw it was the only restaurant offering the restaurant week prix fixe menu on the last Saturday night. Even though we were wrong, the owner felt bad that it said that on the website and offered us the price if we ordered the items on restaurant week menu that were still available. So definitely 1 star to that for being flexible. But for a restaurant to really be top notch (read: have the prices that Davide has) there are just some things I can't look past. \\n\\nApps: My date's caesar was standard and fine. The beef carpaccio that I had was literally stuck to the cold plate, probably because it had been pre-plated. I had to hack away at it with my knife until the delicate piece of meat was destroyed. I did like the parmesan shavings and baby arugula on top, but other than that it was a cold, unseasoned, thin piece of beef stuck to my plate. If I had paid $14 or whatever the price was, I would have definitely sent it back, but I felt bad that the owner had helped us out.\\n\\nEntrees: We came because we wanted the duck with spinach risotto on the restaurant week menu, but there was no more risotto and the duck would be served with the truffled polenta. I asked if the saffron risotto on the regular menu could be subbed out, and the waiter said no, but then the duck came with the saffron risotto with spinach leaves in it?? We were confused. Also it wasn't really risotto, just rice with sauce. In any case the duck was perfectly cooked and the sauce it came with was good.\\n\\nDessert was good, nothing special but good.\\n\\nWine we ordered was good even though it was spelled wrong on the menu - it's MontepulCiano.\\n\\nOur server was fine, but like I said, for a restaurant to be top notch, the demeanor just wasn't really up to standards of a fine restaurant. He didn't smile much or seem like he wanted to be there. There didn't seem to be much passion behind the food, but that seems to be the standard in the North End.

My boyfriend and I come here and order a feast so we can have leftovers (and because we eat a lot.) \\n\\nLove sitting at the sushi bar, my favorite waitress is there and the sushi chefs are nice. I normally come in here just with the boo, but I've also been here with groups of 8-10 and it's still a great time! Our waitress is always down to do sake bombs with (and better than) us! \\n*******\\nRu sans use to be the one sushi place I never wanted to go to but only did because it had a buffet. The fish was average at best and everything was fried.  But it's gotten a lot better over the past few years. Last night we went because we were starving and I was craving sushi and most other places in Buckhead burn a hole in your pocket. Ru San's main thing is that you can't beat the value. My boyfriend and I got out of there stuffed to the brim for $40. They had this awesome \\"tapas\\" appetizer on their special menu that came with a bunch of things (Poke, calamari, \\"fish nachos\\", almond crusted shrimp, takoyaki, two other things that I can't remember) for $9.95. The poke alone would cost $9.95 at most places. The spicy rolls have a bit too much sauce for my taste, but a lot of people like lots of sauce.

In the past couple years they've gone towards the locavore movement.

I felt like they've slipped in three general areas. \\n\\nFirst, the food was not quite as good as usual. I got a special of deep fried Brussels sprouts. They were very good but over salted. The second appetizer was also over salted and tasted more like something one could have expected at a generic chain. \\n\\nSecond, I don't know if I'd become spoiled by a couple exceptional years with their beers. But tonight just didn't seem to really have anything that I felt was epic and worthy of my high praise. Granted, they're still far better than the standard industrial brews. So let's not go there. But if you're expecting the exceptional well I'm afraid you'll be disappointed. \\n\\nLastly, I think the place is jumping from a beer haven to a hipster hangout.

Nevertheless, my girlfriend and I went with an open mind, having heard good reviews somewhere.  Their website and signs on the building/windows touted the superiority of their fries.  We got in line, ordered our food, and sat down.\\n\\nThe first impression for both of us was the fries: tasteless.  Neither of us bothered eating more than 1/3 of them, they were so bland.  I'm not sure how they do it in Virginia, but I have a hard time believing anyone thinks these fries are good.\\n\\nSecond came the burgers.  They were what I have come to expect of hamburgers originating from the northeast and midwest: filler-laden, round (vertically), and small.  In other words, mediocre.  It's probably a wise move that they opened up shop near the university and in the transplant-rich Arboretum area, because native Texans won't find the food anywhere near up to par.\\n\\nThe peanuts in the shell were novel, yet impractical.  Even a gimmick needs decent food to back it up.\\n\\nIf you're really hankering for good fries, go to Hyde Park.  Hell, even Whataburger and Wendy's beat out Five Guys in the fries department.

It's fancy, yet unpretentious like other places around town. It's intimate, and by virtue of the small dining room, service is always going to be great. The waitstaff won't rush you if you're just looking to sip your drinks, chat, and have a good time. They just GET it. No long waits for refills on your drinks, as there's a private bar IN the dining room, and it's one of the few places where the waitstaff GETS that you want to drink and have a good time... Be sure to make a reservation far ahead of time though, as the dining room is very small.\\n\\nAfter traveling to Louisville, KY and having an awful experience for my birthday dinner, a trip to Bogie's soon after was a must. I've ordered the NY Strip twice now, as it's been amazing both times. Dry aged and cooked rare, perfectly. I'd love to try the other steaks, but it's tough to pry yourself away from something that's already working so well. I absolutely LOVE the mac and cheese (maybe the best I've ever had? (no exaggeration)) and the smashed baby potatoes is one of my favorite sides I've ever ordered at a restaurant. I think next time I'll TRY to order the Porterhouse, if the NY Strip doesn't get me first. It's a great place for a date, or to bring friends. It's obviously expensive, but not AS expensive as some of the other steakhouses in Boston. You'll love it just as much, if not more. I love Bogie's place and it's a must-visit for me for all bdays, anniversaries, etc. Oh and my girlfriend is a steak-eater and absolutely loves it too. She got the NY Strip the first time, and the Tenderloin/Filet last time and loved them both."},{"name":"Stephanie's On Newbury","address":"190 Newbury St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"Decent.

My friends and I split the check and when we paid the owner was apparently not happy with our tip.

I work as a waitress and I had never felt so insulted. You NEVER go to a table and demand a tip. That type of entitlement can get you fired at any reputable restaurant. We paid her audacity no mind and left. 2 days later I saw she had taken the shocking liberty of charging my card $16.50 even though I had only authorized a charge for 11.50 which included 15% tip for my meal.

The perfect amount of crispness on the outside while juicy in the middle. The burgers are head and shoulders above any other fast food restaurant. We also ordered waffle fries, a milkshake and dipping sauces. The waffle fries were only average (Burgerville's are better). The milkshake is on par with McDonalds. It is not real ice cream but still tastes pretty good. The Chick Fil A dipping sauce is easily the best and tastes awesome. The ranch was below average and the BBQ is not very good at all.\\n\\n4 stars. Stick to the burgers and the Chick Fil A sauce and you will not be disappointed.

It's conveniently located close to the Beaverton Transit Center,  but it's hidden away in the corner of a small shopping center. No big, flashy sign to advertise it or anything. It's a small place, a little sketchy from the outside, but actually quite nice once you walk in.\\n\\nI usually come here for dinner, and the place is usually quite busy. If you come with a large group, be prepared to wait a little while for a table. The hostess will take your phone number and call you when a table is ready for you, which is awesome. It can get a little loud in here due to the small space and a lot of people talking at once, so if you're looking for a nice, quiet atmosphere, this may not be the place for you. But trust me, the food makes it totally worth it.\\n\\nThe menu has quite a lot to offer, and has some very interesting items. A few plates I like are the Kimchi Harumaki (kimchi and bbq pork with cheese in an egg roll type of thing), Tamago Korroke (basically a croquette with an amazing sauce on the side), and the Tori No Karaage (boneless fried chicken-- sounds boring, but it is absolutely amazing). And at the back of the menu, you'll find a list of noodle dishes, including all of their delicious ramen choices.\\n\\nThe Kakuni Ramen is what they're most known for, and it is extremely delicious. The pork belly just melts in your mouth, the broth is incredible,  and the noodles are perfection. But my personal favorite ramen is the Curry Ramen. This one is apparently only on the lunch menu, but they will still happily make it for you at dinner time if you ask for it. It combines two of my very favorite things-- curry and ramen-- and is amazing. I always ask for a boiled egg with it; it's a slight upcharge, but worth the price.\\n\\nBasically, if you're in the Beaverton area and you're craving some excellent Japanese food, you can't do any better than this.

We ordered two big cheeks trays to split among the four of us, with two orders of pulled pork, brisket, and pork belly. Everything was rubbed and smoked, Texas style, with options for three sauces on the side (we LOVED the tomato-based barbecue sauce). For sides, we ordered the mac and cheese, cole slaw, and the farmers salad. All the meats were tender, flavorful, and delicious, but the pork belly really stood out, so much that we hastily ordered an extra half pound (which we ended up happily bringing home). My husband from Hong Kong, a place that prides itself on its barbecue pork belly, couldn't help but be incredibly impressed. The mac and cheese was very rich, but very good, and the farmers salad was the perfect accompaniment to all this rich food. \\n\\nWe also really liked our server, who was friendly, prompt, and helpful. The decor was casual and fun. \\n\\nThe only complaint we had about this place is a problem we observed with the hostess. Our party made a mistake and accidentally made two reservations (two of us communicated poorly and we both ended up making a reservation). When we got there, we ran into some friends of our serendipitously, and upon realizing that we had two reservations, told our friends to take one of our reservations so they wouldn't have to wait. The hostess told our friends that she could not simply give them our reservation, and we honestly cannot understand why that would have been a problem (since the reservation we made went unused). Moreover, our friends had to sit in a corner for 20 minutes and wait for a table, when two full tables next to us sat empty for nearly 15 minutes of that time. We felt really embarrassed and sad for our friends, and especially, for our friend's parents, who had just traveled halfway around the world for a visit. Seemed like a sad first impression of our country to leave."},{"name":"Lure","address":"1106 Crescent Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Lure is my favorite seafood restaurant in Atlanta.

I am originally from neighboring West Roxbury and have lived in NYC for the past 5 or so years.  I was home for the weekend and looking for something new and interesting to try nearby.  This popped-up on my Yelp app and we decided to give it a try.  \\n\\nWe were told the wait would be 30 minutes but were seated in 15 or less after ordering some very delicious drinks.  The Sunset Song is awesome if you are a scotch drinker looking for a nice cocktail.  My companions raved about the Olympian as well.\\n\\nWe ordered the Haggis and Scotch Deviled Eggs to start.  I have never had haggis before but will assume it was relatively good (it wasn't exactly my taste but have nothing to compare it to).  The rutabaga mash accompanying the haggis was wonderful - I ordered it with my entree as well.   The Scotch Deviled Eggs were a crowd pleaser.  I had Scotch Eggs at an NYC restaurant just recently and the deviling (real word?) of the eggs at Haven really kicked them up a notch.\\n\\nThe burger is amazing - I highly recommend it.  It was cooked quite well and the seasonings and sauces added delicious layers of flavor without being overpowering.  We also had the Fish Supper and White Pudding Sassitch with Mash.  Both were excellent.  Service was also great - servers took notice of empty drinks with haste and we did not wait to order anything from appetizers to dessert.  \\n\\nNow, why not 5 stars?  A few things weren't great - the Stilton mashed potatoes could have used a lot more Stilton and the Herb Mash was a little bland too.  Also, the Minted Mushy Peas were served cold which we weren't expecting.  We didn't love them.  And, lastly, we came in part because of the Deep Fried Mars Bar and they were out of Mars bars:(  They did bring a free dessert that they chose on the house (The 99) but it was just okay.  It would have been nice to let us choose since we were so disheartened about the lack of Mars bars (especially since I am not in the area often).  We also waited about 15 minutes after ordering the Deep Fried Mars Bar before the other desert was presented and we were told they were out of Mars bars.  Lastly, probably the biggest negative here was the server's attitude about it.  He wasn't necessarily rude but was overly serious about the issue.  We joked about needing to order more Mars bars as the weather gets cold and people want comfort food and he responded that they were only human and make mistakes.  Kind of a downer.\\n\\nI would definitely go back here and recommend it to people in the area."},{"name":"Harlow","address":"3632 SE Hawthorne Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Very nice place.

What \\"kind\\" of sodas do you serve?  \\"Is all of your pesto, 'cream pesto\\"?\\" The very nice lady behind the counter told me that they served Coke products (whew) and said that she would go ask about the pesto.

She was really nice about that too.  Then came the \\"sticker shock\\".  Almost thirteen bucks for pasta and a soft drink??

If they were paying someone to come to my table and take my order while I sat in the comfort of a chair and leisurely decided what to order, that would be one thing, but I stood in line and would have felt a lot of pressure about ordering quickly and asking questions, if there had been anyone waiting behind me.  So, I went and got my own drink and met my friend on the front deck.  She paid $7 for a Pinot Grigio.  The person who brought the food was very personable.  My pasta was a little on the salty side, but otherwise really good.  After dinner, I ordered my cake, Almond Amaretto.  It was very, very good, though the cake itself was a tad dry.

Both are cooked just right and so tasty with all of the soy sauce, butter and seasonings that are blasted on them.

The decor is typical of Asian inspired restaurant, with a lot of black, white and red throughout as well as floral designs and dim lighting. Prices are not too bad, but not cheap.

We were handed the menu along with the regular menu but our server never mentioned it and went ahead and pointed out several options on the main menu.  However, when we asked she explained it in detail and noted it was a good deal.  So we went with it and were very impressed.  We also started with the calamari after falling for the up-sell on it which wasn't a bad move as it was very tasty.  The filet and crab cake combo as part of the special was really good. Sides of potatoes and creamed spinach were also very good as was the wedge salad to start.  Service was consistent throughout.. We never were left waiting for anything.  Our steaks were mixed up and we gave our thumbs up on the doneness before realizing the mistake and did a quick switcheroo.  The rare filet tasted better than the medium rare filet  to both of us though.  We were very full after and declined dessert.  Cocktails and wine by the glass selections were great.

I grew up in a Japanese household so I have my own opinions on what good Japanese food is comprised of.  Let me tell you, the food here is some of the best here in PDX.  I come here primarily for the ramen.  Ramen?  You might say.  Well, you have to like ramen.  Theirs is the best I've found here so far.  I've tried many places.  Let me try and sum it up for you -- Broth is Dreamy, Noodles are Perfect (chewy and not soggy), and condiments are Complimentary.  I vacillate between Tonkatsu and Kakuni ramen.  To each his own.  The last time, I ordered Tonkatsu with no ginger and extra menma (bamboo shoots)  OHHHHH!  that was perfection.  As one reviewer put it . . . WORLD DOMINATION and MIND CONTROL.  I have to admit there was one review that described noodles not to their liking, but the noodles are wonderful.  Don't know what they were referring to.  You have to understand that the Shoyu noodles are different than the Tonkatsu noodles -- and keep in mind you can switch these up if you prefer.  My other favorite is the gyoza.

I've visited the Orlando version (the Gaylord Palms) a couple times, and one in DC. (Gaylord National) for very special occasions and it has been a great experience. I'll stick to rating the Palms of course. \\n\\nNow the bar is high... Very high. Anytime you drop at least $150-200 minimum for two people, you expect service that reflects that and the food to match. My first impressions were that the place has an interesting outdoor feel (deep inside the large dome that is Gaylord Palms) that starts with the entire place looking like it's on stilts over a quaint swamp, and goes down to your decorative plate setting covered with a small mosquito tent. I found that to be borderline hokey, but part of the theme enough that I went with it. The feel of a tree fort comes to mind, yet with nicer furnishings. (And girls are allowed here.) \\n\\nThe menu is geared mostly to the tastes of steak lovers of course, but *don't underestimate the power of the sides* (in my best Vader voice) . The menu is somewhat small otherwise, possibly giving the more experienced diners a feeling of a Table d'h√¥te style, or prix fixe. There are also a few alternate proteins by way of chicken, lamb and fish that may or may not be good, so I'll leave that up to someone else to discover since I go to steakhouses for ... steak! \\n\\nThe dinner starts off with an amuse bouche, and some seemingly artisanal breads, not all that amazing but fun if you don't often get to enjoy a spoon sized course often. I tend to judge a fine restaurant on their bread, and this was just ok. \\n\\nThe appetizer menu is short, but a hidden gem of Old Hickory is the cheese plate. For those of us who know a young Stilton can be fruity and Purple Haze is more than a song (or beer), I strongly suggest the 7 cheese plate. This is where the fun begins! I suggest ordering a couple glasses of the Edna Valley Chardonnay ($35 a bottle - wink wink, nothing to see here) and watch the glass roll-top cart roll up to your table with a bevy of bountiful beauties lined up in 3 or 4 rows. A cheese master will guide you through the experience and ask your personal preferences to focus the selections. It is fun and after the selections you receive small food pairings to enjoy and enhance the experience. Behold the power of cheese, ..but I digress. \\n\\nThe steaks were wonderfully cooked and to my preference. They tended to be much larger than what my eyes had ordered previous so I suggest getting the smaller portions with the choice cuts ( a la filet mignon) I had noticed that some previous reviewers had bad experiences (which raised some quality concerns) but I can only rate what I have seen. You are given the option of accompanying sauces (french style) which, much like the cheese pairings, can be fun to explore with your table mates. \\n\\nThe desserts are about what you would expect, but nothing more. I didn't really see anything special or unexpected. Yet, honestly, if anyone has room at this point in the meal then you haven't enjoyed the best parts of this establishment in my opinion. \\n\\nProbably the worst part of the day was the check, but I knew that going in so it wasn't too much of a surprise. The wait staff was very nice and helpful. My glass was never empty (nor was my wine glass), and the table was promptly cleaned after each course without feeling over-attended on. \\n\\nThis can be a romantic place, but one warning... The table for 2 is huge. You sit literally 2 arms lengths from one another and I could barely reach my girlfriend's hand with both of us outstretched. This probably wouldn't come to the minds of most but it took a little off the Valentine's Day mood to be that far apart. (big awwww) \\n\\n**If you're just interested in the cheese part, I asked and it is possible to hit their small bar and get some wine and have them come there with the cart (no reservations needed). Get there early to make sure you can have the place to yourself!** \\n\\n\\n\\nOverall, I'd say they need to come down on what they're charging or really step it up to get a five star rating, but definitely a solid four stars for the unique experience."},{"name":"Candi's For Breakfast","address":"660 Irwin St","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"I went into the Irwin St. Market to check out Candi's.

At 10pm the band finally started, but played a very short set.  By 11pm, we had to head home, and felt like we'd wasted our St Patricks at the wrong place.

I think the one at fancy J.Alexander's is $10. Their veggie burger is the standard that I hold all others to, because it's the best I've had. Northstar's was similar in flavor but not quite as good. They put kale on their burger and I personally can't eat kale unless it's ground up really small in a smoothie. Anyway, the kale pieces were small and fell all over the place before I removed them all. Worth $14? Maybe if you're really craving a decent and filling veggie burger and don't want to wait for takeout or order in at J.Alexander's. It also came with a side salad with a standard and not very tasty italian dressing. The salad consisted of lettuce, cabbage, and a few croutons. The croutons tasted like pure salt.

This is a tough one for me, hubs prefers cocktails to wine, so I often end up with a crappy glass of wine unless I want to take home 3/4 of a corked bottle. Spending a sum of money on a bottle isn't fun when it's not shared with friends.

This one had a plate sized smear of the creamy walnut cream sauce, and the pork, apple, peach, walnut, and raisin interior had a great texture.

To showcase how much I like this place I'll recount a story.  Shortly after Cazuela's opened I came here with a friend.  While eating her burrito she found a piece of metal from somewhere in the kitchen inside her food.  The server tried to say it had fallen from the heat lamp, but it was INSIDE the burrito, so that just wasn't the case. It probably fell into the pan of steak or something, who knows.  Anyway, it is good enough that we both still frequent the place.\\n\\nA lot of people wouldn't come back after an incident like that.  The patio is pretty great, and one of only a handful in the campus area.  The salsa, and this is definitely one of the biggest draws for me, is the best I've had yet at a Mexican joint in Columbus.  In fact, it is probably what keeps me going back.  \\n\\nAs for the speed of service - Well, they are quick enough that during lunch (M-F 11am-2pm) if you order off the lunch menu and don't receive your food within ten minutes of ordering, it's on the house.\\n\\nThere are a wide range of vegetarian and seafood options, in addition to steak, chicken and pork (I'm a pescatarian so that's important to me). However, the shrimp they use are small and probably quite cheap.  \\n\\nAlso, it's open really fucking late.  Like 2am late on Tue and Wed.  Or 4am late on Thur, Fri and Sat.  Isn't that crazy?

The waiter recommended it when I asked for \\"the opposite of hoppy.\\" It was very sweet with hints of nutmeg and cinnamon. Very tasty! And came in a Mason jar to add to the southern charm. \\n\\nThe three of us split a honey-buttered biscuit, which honestly was my favorite part of the meal. So much for me being dairy-free... it was buttery and freshly baked.

There was no sauce on the chicken so I opted to add a few drips of BBQ that was already on our table for our taking.

I also saw a rat/mouse (it was on the largish side) on my last trip and ran the heck out of there! I'd rather not have Mickey or Minnie running over my feet. So, overall the coffee is good but not the greatest place to get work done like so many others keep insisting. Oh and the baked goods aren't that good either for the price.

We were in the neighborhood - starving - and arrived early enough for the early bird specials (!). So glad we visited. My London Broil was DELICIOUS (better tasting than my expensive steak / wasted visit to Mooo...) - accompanied by warm bread, nice salad, baked potato, cup of coffee, and hot fudge sundae. All for $15? Wow. (My special Baxter Stowaway IPA added a few bucks to my overall bill - but it was worth it). My wife enjoyed her steak tips and mashed potatoes (tips were a little charred but still good flavor). My kids loved their bread and butter (don't all kids?) and mac & cheese. Pretty simple. Service was friendly, nice, and very accommodating.\\n\\nIf you're looking for good old fashioned value in an old school establishment - you can't go wrong with Frank's.

HUGE space to sit down. A bar, a regular dining area, an outdoor covered patio (I mean...what bar in Austin has a large outdoor covered area? Seriously folks) and on the weekend another huge upstairs patio, a ton of hookas to use, espresso, lots of well placed TVs for sports etc.\\n\\nThe owners it seemed like really did a lot to make this place custom, and not just a \\"refurb\\", or a rack 'em and stack 'em Greek place. The counters are all slab marble, the front door is huge, heavy and beautiful, there are tons of space heaters, fans for outside, comfy seating......\\n\\nWe sat in the bar and had dinner there. We shared spanikopita, and a gyro platter and a gyro salad. \\n\\nThe taziki sauce - seriously to die for. I generally HATE taziki sauce, and I wanted extra of this stuff. The gyro meat was also very moist, well seasoned, and obviously well made.\\n\\nSo what is bad about this place:\\n\\n1) Fairly limited menu at present. I can understand the focus around bar food, and hopefully as they get more patrons they will expand the menu. They have good food, it seems like they are being cautious at present.\\n\\n2) Kinda an Odd location - the rooftop patio is awesome, except for that it is next to i-35. That's the only bummer.\\n\\n3) Would like the bar / dining area to be more separated - they are kinda one big room. If they kept the dining area more separated, they could turn the music up in the back area a bit more, make it more of a bar bar atmosphere, and with all the big screens and space, I think it would draw a much bigger crowd.\\n\\n\\nOverall - I really like this place. I'll go back, I'll bring friends, I'll hang out and have a good time - hopefully more people will give it a fair shot. I can really see what the owners are trying to do, they obviously have a lot of passion, and I really like their concept.

I love the simple menu- you get one meat, two sides. (That's the usual- you can get more meat, sides, etc.) The first time I went, I was a little nervous because a sox game was happening that night, and it's right around the corner. The place was PACKED and I was afraid I wouldn't be able to dine there. Well, they told me that I would need to wait 1 hour, and i really did want to try the place, so I said okay and went to the nearby (NEW!) target to kill time. Well, luckily enough, a spot opened up within 20 min and I was seated right away. Got the corn, biscuits, and pulled pork w/broccoli cheese casserole and cole slaw. Everything tasted very homemade and not too salty. Love that we could control the amount of flavor on the meat- they are all cooked without sauce. The corn was way beyond my expectations! You get a LOT of corn, so well worth the price, since it was also super yummy and grilled to perfection. Lastly, the biscuits. Ugh. Super well baked, huge, and melts in your mouth. And the honey butter? Out of this world good. I could swim in it. Needless to say, this place is one of my new boston faves!

Also, the scones shrunk, they used to be bigger and warm, now they are size of a quarter, cold and hard as a brick. Finally ... it was afternoon tea... my tea was lukewarm at best.

We ordered the Miso Ramen, the Pad Thai, Shrimp Tempura Roll and the Soft Shell Crab Roll to share at the table. The Miso broth was horrible! It tasted like water with hardly a chicken flavor least of all a miso flavor. The soup was supposed to have chicken in it and it only had 1 thin slice of chicken in the entire bowl of soup which is supposed to be a meal for $9.95. When we told our waiter after taking one bite he just asked if we wanted him to bring salt?!?! The Pad Thai was ok except it was way too sweet. It tasted like it was made with ketchup. Both the rolls were only ok. The soft shell crab and the shrimp were extremely overcooked (burnt brown instead of a light golden brown) and they weren't even in a tempura batter. It might have been a panko crust. Both seafood was so overcooked you couldn't tell what you were eating. The restaurant also did not offer the two typical sauces that most sushi places offer at the table. They only had soy sauce. We had to ask for the spicy mayo dipping sauce which they charged $0.50 for. Overall we had a horrible experience and would never go again.

Even the door and its frame were art - with metal flowers and a cool handle. I glanced at the menu, saw that pumpkin and  jicama were included in the ingredients of the vegetarian soft tacos and led Mum through the door.

My boyfriend and I like this place's ramen better than most of the others around Boston, and we just keep finding ourselves here again and again! \\n\\nToday we tried their hotpot for the first time. We ordered the beef combo and the pork combo, both of which came with a basket of vegetables and a bowl of noodles (we chose Japanese yam noodles and ramen). We ordered a side of xiaolongbao as well, just in case the hotpot servings were not large enough. The hotpot was very filling, even though we were initially skeptical that we'd have enough. That's usually my main beef with eating hotpot out at restaurants - I often feel that it costs too much for what I'm receiving. I thought that the portions here were just right. We would have been full without the side order of xiaolongbao! \\n\\nThe soup base and sauces for hotpot are what really define the meal, and the ones we had today were simple but hit the spot. The sauce was a dish of soy sauce, with some sides of blended pepper, garlic, shacha, and spring onions. We ordered the tonkotsu soup base since we're such big fans of the ramen and it worked well with the noodles that we chose. There are many other choices for soup base as well that I'd love to try next time! \\n\\nI'm a bit of a stickler for xiaolongbao and didn't find the soup/filling ratio to be as balanced as they could have been - it was a little heavy on the filling.

Came here with a few friends about a week and a half ago. We ordered several entrees to share and also shared a few appetizers. We were left hungry first of all because the portions are not very big. Second, service was slow as all hell. Try waiting 45 minutes for an appetizer and another 30 for a drink and about an hour for the entre. I don't want to go into each dish because then that will just be a 2000 page essay, however let's just say that everything was either covered in sauce and broth which was greasy, and cream and butter, A girlfriend of mine took a few pictures of the food but I told her not to even upload it because it be false advertisement. The food went inside our mouth and into side our body as quickly as it came out because of all the butter and the cream and all the sauces, if you get my drift. Just imagine poor pork chops floating in a sea of yellowish or greenish unappetizing cream. Or scallops or ravioli floating amongst unappetizing cream and oil mixed together that looks like it came out of a cow's udder. The plating also was sloppy there were areas where sauces shouldn't be sauces and mixed herbs should not be mixed. We have been to plenty of fine dining restaurants and half of them are French influenced.  If you're actually looking for authentic French don't come here, go to Anis Cafe in Buckhead, where your food won't be swimming in potential diarrhea. So my friends and I will not be coming back and we will make sure that our families and friends know about the creams and excessive sauces and the excessive herbs and the excessive oils before they come so they can come ready with diapers in their purses. Also we parked in the back parking lot which was Tiny, and your car might get bumped or hit by another car backing out. Well my girlfriend was trying to back out of her parking spot, she said that the next time she needs to find a place where the food isn't going to make her want to run for the bathroom and this is why the French use bidets."},{"name":"Raci√≥n","address":"1205 SW Washington St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"I came here on a recommendation from a friend while visiting Portland.

I had a couple of whiskey #2's that for $9 a piece, were definitely lacking. Semi warm, watered down, ginger with a smidge of bourbon. It was more of the dive bar drink, variety. I take that back. A dive bar would have probably made it stronger.\\n\\n  We sat at the bar the majority of the time but decided to grab a seat at a table. If I knew that the price of our burger would automatically go up by $4 for doing so, we might have stayed put.  When our food finally arrived it was lack luster, the burger that we shared was good but not good like I remember. Certainly not $12 good and the $11 sushi roll was equal to something I would pick up at the Safeway deli. \\n\\nThe clincher of the evening though, was when I sent my card away to settle up my tab.  The bartender came out to our table and suspiciously asked to see the ID that the card went to. He had already seen my ID, when I originally ordered a drink! Furthermore, if I was trying to pull a fast one, I would have ordered a hell of a lot more than a sushi roll and two overpriced watered down drinks. Doesn't he know that if I was working with someone elses money, I would have been buying everyone shots, and shoving $14 sushi rolls down my pants?!  Thank the Madonna that I was dining with my friend that evening and not a client!

Well let me tell you about Wine 30. The first star is for impeccable service. Jesse will be your knowledgeable guide as you navigate both the food menu and the unpretentious yet completely thought out wine menu. The second star is for selection; I can always find just the right wine for the occasion here, and being a member of the wine club offers significant perks. The third is for the food: reasonably priced and utterly delicious choices, with a cheese plate to die for along with scrumptious soups, sandwiches and salads. The fourth is for ambiance. Whether you sit outside on a  summer night, by the window and heat lamps on a brisk fall evening, snuggled on the couch inside around the fire on a winter afternoon, or in the back room with a group of friends planning your spring break adventures, this place is the epitome of comfort and class. We enjoyed the live music last night as well, a perfect accompaniment to date night. Finally, the elusive fifth star is for consistently. No matter what time of day, month or year I go, I will always find the same friendly service, wine, food and experience. That is hard to do in the restaurant business, yet to me is most important.

We were greeted promptly upon telling the hostess our reservation information and we were seated quite quickly. About 15 minutes upon being seated, I received a phone call from Boston Pizza asking if we are planning to take the table we reserved for. It is not a very big deal but at the same time it tells me that the team is not very organized and there is a lack of attention to customers. I honestly do not think it is that hard to keep track of who has arrived and who hasn't. But again I will give the benefit of the doubt that it is New Year's Eve and it is busy. So this was not a huge deal.\\n \\nWhen we made the reservation we were asked if we would prefer to have one bill or split the bill. We actually appreciated that gesture as that would save everyone's time in the end. But then we were asked two more times throughout the night if we would like to split the bill. Again I understand it is busy but if you are not going to keep track of our decision we might as well just save it till the end and be asked only once. After we got our food, we wanted to ask for pepper and cheese but the server was no where to be found for a long while. Later we got to ask for more water during our meal, which also never came. When we were finished and we asked for the bill, we were not asked if we wanted any dessert or drinks to follow, it is a little thing but it just added to our overall disappointment on the level of service provided.\\n\\nThen the bill took 20 minutes to arrive.  Part of our party of 6 wanted to pay with card so we asked for the machine. And it was another 10 minutes before our server came by again and said she will be right with us. After which we waited another 15 minutes and still nothing. At this point we were already quite frustrated as it was a pure waste of time. So we went to the front counter and asked to pay and mentioned that we had to wait for a long time, and then they took another 5 minutes looking for our server to get to the front in order to finish our payment. This part was very confusing to us as to why the person at the counter could not just take our card. Regardless of how busy it might be, I do not believe it is reasonable for it to take 45 minutes before we can finish paying. Though Boston Pizza pricing is very affordable, as paying customers we still expect there to be basic service. \\n\\nIn the end we left feeling neglected and annoyed with the whole dining experience.

I've been maintaining my weight thanks to exercise and now eat what I want, and sometimes I have that craving for a fast food style burger without the post-meal funk that you experience after eating at a Whataburger, McDonald's, Jack in the Box, or even Short Stop.\\n\\nMy friend introduced me to Elevation Burger and what really caught me is that their fries are cooked in olive oil and their burgers are made of grass-fed, organic beef.  Their toppings are also varied and fresh, and you pick your own, but considering I'm a pretty standard guy who likes standard toppings on his burger (lettuce, tomato, pickles, and light mayo and mustard), I'm not going to get picky here.\\n\\nThe food itself is very fresh, the fries have a crispy, thin quality to them, but truly this is one burger where I'm actually sad if I finish it before the fries.  When I used to guzzle Mickey D's food like I was on some documentary about how bad Mickey D's is for you, I was always sad when the fries got finished first, but here it's all about the burger.  The \\"flagship\\" burger, the Elevation, is a double patty burger, but it isn't overwhelming and leaves you feeling satisfied and not bloated!  \\n\\nThe staff is also cheerful, upbeat, and always happy to make sure I have what I want on my burger - even though, again, I'm not that picky compared to some gripy mom lady with kids who kept repeating herself on the toppings she wanted and asking and double checking if there would be ketchup on the burger.  Give it a rest.  Then she griped about the price she was paying.  You're paying for healthier burgers and fries here than you would down the street at Whataburger, you're getting awesome customer service here, and they even give you a Club 7 card where you get a free burger after your card is filled with - you guessed it - seven hole punches shaped like - hah! - the number 7, and so I gave her a get over it look and she stopped griping.  The staff looked grateful.  Apparently people are really mean to the staff there.  Those people should try working a day in the food service industry.\\n\\nAnyway, I think I go to Elevation Burger about twice a week, I don't feel bad about it.  Actually it makes me more energized to go for my end-of-day, post-workday runs.  The price could be considered expensive by some, but I urge you all to think about what you're putting in your body and consider that you're getting what you pay for.  Plus, if you are SUPER hungry, just get the Vertigo Burger - it's four patties, although I don't think I could do it.\\n\\nGo try this place!"},{"name":"El Arroyo 5th Street","address":"1624 W 5th St","city":"Austin","stars":"2.5","text":"Came here for lunch with my co-workers lat week, WAS NOT IMPRESSED.

When I started to check on the avocado they used an old, brown, nasty tasting avocado. I WAS SO UPSET! How can a restaurant give a customer and OLD AVOCADO. It was so nasty. The waitress was nice, but I cant stand when people call me baby a million times \\" I am sorry baby, you want something else baby\\". The manager didn't even come out to apologize for the food. They did remove my food from my bill but charged me $1.95 for my tea! I don't expect freebies but dang, food was late, service horrible, nasty food, and your going to charge me $1.95 for my tea. My co-workers were not thrilled about their food either.

The taquitos are fantastic and one order is quite filling. The salsa is a little watery, as can probably be expected, but the chips are good. The beef burritos are very good, and the queso is legit delicious. As far as Mexican fare goes its a little overpriced. The portions are smaller than you might expect, so I'd you're looking for value and filling might try somewhere else. For taste, however, this is a good place. Just make sure when you leave with a to-go order that you take everything out of the bag and check it. Several times we've ordered to-go here they've forgotten things, mostly queso or paid extras. So always verify."},{"name":"Tasca Restaurant","address":"1612 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Brighton","stars":"4","text":"Amazing tapas. It's bold of me to say, but I honk the food is better than at Barcelona Brookline (and Back Bay). The only downfall is that I would have liked to enjoy my pomegranate rose sangria pitcher outside rather than inside. Literally the only thing about this place I don't like is that they don't have a patio. \\n\\nThe lobster croquettes and mussels were my favorite. The mussels were a pretty big portion, so you could definitely share with a couple people. I think the key is to have 2-4 people splitting the plates total. Many seem like they were meant for just 2 though. The empanadas are excellent as well. They often have empanada specials too. Try the smoked salmon with potato pancake. It's like eating potato sticks and lox. \\n\\nThe dessert menu is pretty great.

Our waitress at Gari was very friendly and attentive without ever hovering - great service.  She was also the first waitress I've ever met at a sushi restaurant who knew where the fish came from (the Alaskan salmon), which really impressed me.  The small space is not good for large groups, but it was quiet, and perfect for couples.\\n\\nFor $35, we got a gyoza appetizer (which was only so-so), two california rolls, an eel and avocado roll, a spicy tuna roll, and ten pieces of nigiri.  The presentation was very pretty, and the portions of fish were large.  I loved all the nigiri, and it was incredibly fresh.  There were no freaky Chef's choice pieces--only red tuna and wild-caught salmon that melted in your mouth.  The eel roll and spicy tuna were absolutely the best I had ever had anywhere, especially the tuna, which was very spicy without going overboard on the mayonnaise.  Overall, a lot of excellent sushi that left me full for only $18 - not bargain basement certainly, but very reasonable.

I tried their Seoul Burger. It's an angus beef patty dripping with Korean sauce. The sauce gave great flavor to the burger. As a Korean, it felt comforting. They seemed to have cooked the meat about medium to medium rare, which is good. The bun tasted fine, and it seemed like a decent burger to me.

I took my mother and step dad here for Mother's Day. I reserved us a table for 3 about a month prior because I knew this was a pretty popular restaurant and wanted to make sure I could get a table Mother's Day with no issue. The restaurant inside was almost empty but we could hear the staff telling people how \\"they have been booked for over a month.\\" However I made a reservation so I walked right up to the hostess station, told them my name and they found it no problem. \\n\\nWe got off to a rocky start when the hostess tried to seat us at a booth behind the server station. My mom pointed out that she didn't want to sit behind the sever station where we would hear a bunch of clanging dishes and noise. We also wanted to sit in view of a window so as to not feel claustrophobic. We didn't want to sit in one of the worst spots of the restaurant when we had already made reservations plus the restaurant was empty and there were lots of tables. The hostess became visibly irritated when we stated we would like to sit elsewhere. She then informed us she could not sit us anywhere else because larger parties were coming. So my mother asked to speak to a manager. Eventually the manager handled it calmly and professionally and simply took us to another table no problem. \\n\\nOnce we were seated, our waiter Randy was somewhat friendly but informative and swift. The food was quite delicious. We were all satisfied with the food that we ate and may come back because of the food alone. Fresh food and simple recipes are a saving grace here. We stayed at our table and ate for about an hour. By the way when we were leaving around 12 the restaurant was just beginning to get filled up. \\n\\nAround 12 we went to the bar and enjoyed the live music played by the band there. The BAND WAS EXCELLENT. We stayed there and drank cocktails until almost 3. Great music: a fusion of New Orleans jazz, blues and country. We loved it. The bar tenders were pretty alright however one bartender gave my step dad a questionably small espresso...??? That was weird. I know espresso's are small but they are supposed to be a shot not a half shot. I've been to Italy and had espresso and they were not that skimp. When they give you the small cup they fill it all the way up, ain't no half step lol. But nonetheless we had a lot of fun by the bar. \\n\\nWould I come back? More than likely but ONLY because of the food and live music. But I really wish they would train or hire more friendly and professional staff. The hostess is the first face of the restaurant and should be friendly and accommodating. The hostess didn't even wish my mother a Happy Mother's Day. She just gave my mom attitude because my mother requested to sit elsewhere... This shouldn't be a new thing for a hostess. We didn't just waltz in Sunday morning for brunch. I took time out to reserve my table early so why should my mother get the shaft Mother's Day sitting by the server station? Ha. Amazing. So to end this long review. Please either speak to and train your current staff on how to be more professional and friendly to restaurant patrons or hire new ones. Because Watershed is a lovely restaurant.

I brought friends from out of town to share this gem that I was in love with, all to get food poisoning. Before the actual symtoms of the illness began, we started to notice the difference between the old Tasca and new. We made a reservation a day in advance and called to let them know we would be two minutes late. We arrived there within those two minutes and were still made to wait--in their incredibly small waiting  area-- for another 20 minutes with several other groups waiting, although we could see open tables. The woman who finally seated us (not the hostess) was really gruff and condescending with us. YAY.\\n\\nOne thing I will say about Tasca now and before they went downhill is you never have to wait long for food to come once you've order. This most recent time, I wish they had waited a little longer to allow my food to be properly cooked. Food poisoning is not fun! Having been here several times before and the food being consistently good I was kind of thrown off when the dishes we've ordered on several occasions tasted different. Nothing tasted awful, but at a table with 3 gentleman and one lady their should be plenty of chowing down-- and that just did not occur.\\n\\nBring back the old Tasca and I will give you a 300 star review.

Off balance. :) A friend joined our group midway through, and at one point or another in the evening, all three of us had paid for a round or two.

She kept apologizing, saying she knew it was a mistake, etc. She looked a little frightened of this guy, and I don't blame her. He was angry, he was unkind, and most of all, he was rude. I asked, \\"If I were TRULY running out on the bill, don't you think I'd be down by Copley by now and not chilling on your patio?\\" He had nothing to say to this, just more grumbles and ire. \\n\\nI paid the bill, because it WAS ours, and I would hate to see a good waitress miss out on her tip because we got tipsy and made a mistake. Truly, it was my/our fault, and I would not have had ANY problem with this whatsoever if the manager had been even a little gracious. But to be followed out and shouted at like a criminal... It was just a little beyond. I've worked in food service, and it's a demanding, thankless job.

The waiters were friendly and attentive. They refilled my water very quickly every time, which is always nice.\\n\\nFood: our entrees were both solid, but the shoestring fries we ordered as a side left something to be desired. I got the day boat scallops, which was solid, although not as impressive as I'd hoped. But good if you like scallops and mushrooms. My friend got the roasted chicken breast with truffle mushroom goat cheese polenta. He liked it, although he also seemed less impressed than expected. The fries were basically McDonald's level. Overall, good food--nothing that will wow, but solid.\\n\\nDrinks: I got the Life and Libertea, which was excellent. Such a unique drink, and done very well, for a good price (it's pretty big). He got that and the Dahlia. The Dahlia was impressive--very nuanced flavors and a nice kick from the jalape√±o. The drinks were the one really impressive part of the restaurant, I thought.\\n\\nPrice/value: worth it if you're looking for something that you know will be good, but not something that will wow you.

This features 1/2 off a selection of appetizers and $4.25 margaritas, along with some beer specials.\\n\\nThe margaritas here are some of my favourite in Austin. They aren't too sweet, they don't taste like boxed or bottled mix, and even during happy hour they're quite strong. The frozen ones really shine; on-the-rocks is good but not as good. All of the appetizers we have tried have been excellent: choriqueso, sopecitos, guac, and salsa. The salsa and chips arrive at your table free, and the sopecitos, which are little corncakes topped with chorizo and what you might call \\"taco fixings,\\" are amazing. The choriqueso is a meal in itself, even for two. \\n\\nIn my experience, the service here is excellent. The waitstaff are quick and attentive, and they don't judge if you're only there for drinks or snacks. The outdoor deck in front of the restaurant, despite being right on South Lamar, is where we always sit. The inside of the restaurant isn't super appealing, especially when it isn't crowded. Parking can be a pain here. They have sharply angled spots on one side of the building, and I imagine that during busy dinner hours, you have to seek parking elsewhere on South Lamar.\\n\\nSo, dinner. Unfortunately, the entrees we've tried here did not blow us away. The mole enchiladas were decent, as were the tacos al pastor and the enchiladas de pipian.

But Full English was a disappointment to  myself, my wife, and a friend who had recently visited Scotland.   First of all, the menu prices  seem pretty steep for what you get.  But more to the point, the service was indifferent (this was some time ago, so staff may have changed by now); the decor seems just dirty and tatty, not at all the country British B&B of my hopes;  it took a long, long time to bring out our food; the tea was bland,  the tea water barely lukewarm, and getting sugar or cream was a challenge; most of our breakfasts were missing some vital components (tomatoes, beans, toast), the one fried egg supplied was extremely small, there was NO back bacon, and there were NO bangers.  This seems to be a common complaint among reviewers.   We were given generic American bacon (and not very much of it) and a small sausage patty, or should I say, lump.  Very, very bad form.  The food was cold, too.  \\n\\nReally, this reminded me more of some of the viler Pakistani-run London B&Bs where they just leave out a few boxes of cold  cereal and a tea kettle for the punters, maybe a bottle of milk if you're lucky.

I feel this is fair.  The mixed reviews for Epicerie exist for a reason.  Not a single thing we ordered was worth the price we paid in both dollars and time.  We were sat right away, ordered quickly, and proceeded to wait 55 minutes for the first item to come out--- a cold dish of salmon tartar.  Yes, the salmon tartar came with fried yucca chips, however, they were cold as can be... so, the wait for a 95% cold dish was not due to frying the yucca chips.  Diners who arrived and ordered after us received their food and paid before we had received our entrees.  For a full breakdown of service, food, and beverage, read on below:\\n\\nThe Service: Poor.  The staff were in no way rude, but were in no way approachable, welcoming, or personable.  It wasn't until our food was clearly very, very delayed that our waitress seemed at all positive toward us.  If we were gruff, standoffish, and demanding, I could understand the staff responding to us in the way they did (hostess, waitress).  However, we're quite the opposite.  It was strange.  I wonder if Epicerie falls short in caring for their staff... maybe that could explain the strange service experience. \\n\\nThe Food: Underwhelming and sloppily made.  We ordered one of the daily specials as an appetizer, the salmon tartar.  For our entrees we ordered the shaved beef sandwich ($16) and the gnocchi ($15).  The shaved beef sandwich had been cut in half, each of us receiving a half.  The people of Epicierie are not sandwich artists--- my partner had a representative sample of what the sandwich was to be including arugula, horseradish sauce, and shaved beef on a cibatta.  My side, well, it managed to have a wee bit of shaved beef and no horseradish sauce The sandwich is intended to come with a side of onion rings.  They are the thin, stringy kind of onion rings that really lend themselves to being a topping (not a standalone), so I added it to my poorly made sandwich half which improved it.  Clearly, the sandwich maker threw it together haphazardly, thought they were helping us out by cutting it in half, but neglected to check the orientation of the cut because only half the sandwich had the full ingredients and I got the short end of the stick. Gnocchi is always great.  This stuff was fine, salt really improved it and I don't feel like salt is a sign of a poor dish (we all like different levels of salt).  It was just a fine dish.  Best thing we ate there, but it wasn't worth coming for or returning for.  Just a small plate of gnocchi that had been crisped up (maybe pan fried) and included cauliflower, wild mushrooms, and chervi.  Basil shouldn't be listed as an ingredient on the menu.  There were two piece of basil that may have once been one entire basil leaf.  Could have brought my own from the garden had I known Epicerie was too short to incorporate it into dishes that require it.\\n\\nThe Booze: Decent selection, awful glasses.  Thankfully, we had a nice bottle of wine to keep us company while we waited obscenely long for our food.  Unfortunately, the stuff tasted like alcohol--- yes, wine is an alcoholic beverage, but it didn't taste like the rich, bold wine we purchased.  Epicerie clearly isn't owned or managed by someone who loves and appreciates wine.  Epicerie doesn't use wine glasses--- they use thick rimmed juice glasses (short glass, small diameter, thick rim).  While it used to be an opinion that wine taste is optimized by the glass it's in, recent research has made that a fact.  The flavors of what we drink and eat are a combination of taste and smell.  With wine, the shape of the glass, in part, determines how much ethanol you smell when taking a drink.  If you're smelling ethanol, your not getting optimal flavor from the wine.  The glasses here absolutely contribute to a stronger ethanol smell than if we had been drinking from, oh, you know... a wine glass. \\n\\nI hear the brunch here is good.  I feel like a dummy having an inkling of desire to return and give Epicerie another try. Maybe they're a brunch place.  I so rarely have the opportunity to sit at a real restaurant and enjoy some new chef crafted food.  It stunk for my dinner-out night to have been spent with poor service, a looooonng wait for food, and poor food."},{"name":"Wine Bar George - A Restaurant & Bar","address":"1610 Buena Vista Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"We reserved a table via the Disney World app. The process to reserve and the welcoming at the restaurant were seamless.

For my main dish, I ordered the pulled pork tray with mac n' cheese and the potato salad. At first, I didn't think the portions were that big given the price but it took me two meals to consume all of the food. The pork was moist and even better when paired with the house BBQ sauce. The mac n' cheese was so thick and creamy that you really couldn't eat too much in one sitting. Next time, I would pass on the potato salad.

I first heard about them as a raffle sponsor for a local charity I am involved with and decided to try them. I like to support the businesses that give back to the community. I come for the buffet at night and always bring a friend. They have 2 long tables of food to select from and the meal includes soup. it is great for the all you can eat. The tea is included unlike another restaurant that charges for tea. The food has always been hot and fresh. I have made this a weekly ritual and eat here every week. There is definitely good value. They always refill the selections with fresh food promptly. I have always had a good experience. It has plenty of free parking. The \\" General's \\" chicken is  flavorful and does not burn your mouth out. They have a few tv screens so you can catch the evening news while eating dinner.  I rarely write reviews and like most people they write only when something goes wrong. You rarely get to hear about the good ones as most people don't have time or bother to write. If you never ate here before  check it out.

One night for dinner \\"date night\\" hot pot and appetizers with both my parents, and another time for bento boxes for lunch with my mom.  The bento boxes were the biggest disappointment and when we vowed never to return to the restaurant again.  \\n\\nService: I don't know what it is with these places, but it always seems like the waiters don't want to be there and much less want to help you out.  They always have such surly attitudes.  It was our first time doing hot pot and we were kind of left to our own devices to figure it out, but a little introduction, like, \\"is this your first time?\\" Followed by a quick explanation of where to begin would have been friendly and helpful.  Plus napkins were not replenished throughout the dining experience and water was not refilled.  Might I mention it was us and two other tables during dinner, and, just us and one other table during lunch - so they weren't scrambling, we were just being ignored.\\n\\nFood:\\nHot pot: We picked the tom yum soup base and the spicy szechaun soup base with seafood combo platter and the boneless short ribs.  You could also pick your noodles, my mom picked vermicelli, and my dad picked udon. These also came with a basket of vegetables, soy sauce, and 4 baskets of different accoutrements - hot peppers, bbq sauce, scallions, and some other hot pepper paste.  From here it was just dunk the uncooked food in the boiling soup and enjoy.  It was actually quite good.  A little spicy for my liking (we did chose the two spiciest brooths).\\nApps: We got octopus salad, spicy calamari salad, fresh spring rolls, and char-shu bao.  I don't think we were ready for the octopus salad.  They were literally baby octopus, piled atop one another, heads one, in a delicious sauce - oh so chewy.  I could get past the bodies, but the chewiness was like eating rubber bands.  The spicy calamari salad was also delicious but suffered the same chewiness problem, not to the same degree as the octopus, but still - previously frozen fish here?  The fresh rolls were okay, but suffered from a wierd sauce that had an indiscernible spice in it.  The char-shu bao were stars, soft succulent pork, delicate, light buns, and light crispy pickles resulted in the perfect combination.\\nDessert: Salted Caramel Mochi - very good, just your basic from the package frozen mochi.\\nBento Box: I got the salmon teriyaki bento box and my mom got the stir-fried sirloin bento box.  It came with California Roll, Fried Gyoza, Fried Shumai, Lobster Rangoon, House Salad, and Seaweed Salad.  Where was the miso soup?  Anyway, my mom's sirloin looked liked steak ums over rice.  They didn't taste much better with thin pieces in sweet teriyaki sauce.  My salmon looked like something the cat had already pawed through and tasted so fishy I could only manage 2 bites.  The California roll was good - kind of hard to mess up.  The fried Gyoza had an indistinguishable filling inside of it, so I only had one bite - it wasn't worth going back for a 2nd.  Who has ever heard of fried shumai?  They are always in a nice fresh wrapper, the frying killed these, and instead of a nice fresh shrimp dumpling, there was a badly fried mushy dough ball sitting in front of me.  What a disappointment.  The lobster Rangoon inside was at least good - as I mentioned, everything fried was mushy not crisp, so I just scooped out the insides of the Rangoon and there was actually lobster in there!  The salad was even a let down, instead of that usual good orange gingery dressing that is usually placed on such salads, this was dressed in some watery vinergy gingery imposter covering sad iceberg leaves.  A suiting end to the meal.  At least I had the sense to buy a groupon before coming here again.\\n\\nOverall, this place is just a huge disappointment.  I have high hopes every times I came here, and was let down by poor food and uncaring service,  I won't be coming back here ever."},{"name":"Diesel Cafe","address":"257 Elm St","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"Hier ist immer was los!

I feel as though my younger self pretty accurately summed up the charm of Dan's, so I'm just going to turn that response into my review: \\n\\n\\"After spending nearly an hour driving around Austin aimlessly, looking for the perfect location to set up shop [a place where an awkward girl could click away at her keyboard unnoticed amidst a hustle and bustle], I was still in need of a place outside of my comfort zone to read in and was starting to get hungry. I grabbed some reinforcement [Tiny Tim] and we departed in search of food. Unfortunately, we passed up the A+ buffet, which served, [all at once, as is the beauty of buffets] Mexican, Italian, hot pizza, Chinese, American, salad, Indian, and Greek. Tim didn't seem interested.\\n\\nAfter a failed attempt at gathering the courage to work inside a tattoo parlor, we ended up back at Dan's Hamburgers, an oasis of fatty foods, outdated d√©cor, and general sketchiness. We each splurged and ordered curly fries and shakes to go with our respective burgers [his certified angus beef, mine chicken] and sat in a \\"wooden\\" booth, the likes of which haven't been produced since Charlie's Angels were still a new commodity. We shared our evening with Couple A, 2 men, one with hair longer than mine, discussing comic books, and Couple B, a man and wife? possibly celebrating their 34th anniversary at the hot spot that is Dan's. The food was perfect - the greasy, stereotypical burger, fries, and shake served in nondescript containers that I think I've secretly always longed to consume at least once in my life. The atmosphere was even better - everyone was pleasant but remained detached and uninterested. I was able to eavesdrop into a very serious conversation about the merits of Sin City while the twinkling lights of the Dan's Hamburger sign outside mesmerized my inner child. All in all, it was one of the more perfect meals in recent history. It offered exactly what was expected, nothing more, nothing less and didn't try to disguise itself in commercialized blandness. Bonus: the extra small, tightly wound curly fry hiding like buried treasure at the bottom of the fry basket.\\n\\nIn all honesty, the real reason it was so perfectly satisfying was bcause it felt like the sort of small town joint you find in the middle of nowhere, 12 hours into a road trip. It evoked the sensations of freedom and endless possibilities which accompany long trips in the car. For a few hours or days, you can pretend that nothing matters in your world, that nothing bad could ever happen, and no responsibilities hold you back. You just get in your car and go, and there is the possiblity that maybe, if you drive far enough, under enough stars and past enough Dan's Hamburgers, you might just find the person you're looking for.\\n\\nProps to Dan, his 35 year old establishment, and this project for giving me an excuse to finally venture inside and eat food that took approximately five years off my life."},{"name":"Stephanie's On Newbury","address":"190 Newbury St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"I heart Stephanie's and its not only because it has a great name, but the food and the cocktails were quite delicious.

Went with a party of 9 people with a reservation on 1/12/18. This was the second time we have been at this restaurant, the first being just about a year ago, when they first opened.  Sad to say that after almost 1 year in business, they STILL CAN'T GET IT TOGETHER.  EVERYTHING you asked for you had to wait 20-30 minutes before it came.  We were sitting at the table for 1 hour before we even ordered our meal.  1 person in our group, never had his order placed so when his dinner FINALLY came out, everyone was done eating.  They did comp his meal but that's not the point!  HE SAT THERE WATCHING EVERYONE ELSE EAT!  A young woman by the name of \\"STEPHANIE\\" heard our conversation at the table and asked if there was a problem.  I told her we have been here 2 1/2 hours, waited over 1/2 hour after requesting our check and 1 person in our group, had no food to eat.  She VERY RUDELY responded with her head bopping and body moving, we haven't been open for a year.   I said pretty close to it because they aimed to open for New Year's Eve last year.  Why should that matter if a customer is filing a complaint?  If you are NOT THE MANAGER, DON'T INTERVENE.  ESPECIALLY, A SMART, RUDE ASS!  Anyways, she then proceeded to say its because every pasta dish is cooked to order.  I explained to her that I dine out every weekend and have been to plenty of restaurants and NEVER waited over an hour for my food.  I then asked if she was a Manager and she said I'll get you one and walked away with head still bobbing.  Everyone then remarked how she disrespected me and gave me nothing but attitude.  I then met the Manager who states his family owns the restaurant and wanted to know what he could do and I responded for starters, FIRE that server as I pointed to STEPHANIE as I said she is going to lose you A LOT more money as we will NEVER be back.

But, I am chalking this up to needing a little time to get that beautiful wood fired oven calibrated, seasoned and tuned.   I think once they do, they will be baking some of the finest pizza crust around.   In the mean time, I'm going to ask for mine a little more well done.  I like a crispy almost burnt crust which is probably just a personal taste. \\n\\nI work in the area and this is a VERY welcome addition.  We will be frequenting this place often.

She was assured they would find my condo.  At 8:04 still no pizza so she called back again, gave the person the address and was told the pizza just went out and would arrive in under 20 minutes.  At 8:48, almost 3 hours from the original order, still no pizza. I called and repeated the story and was told no order could be found for my address.  Therefore the gentleman that had informed us earlier it was on its way didn't really check and lied.  When I asked what they could do at this point, I was told they could make me a pizza.  I asked if there would be a charge after waiting for three hours and being lied to and was told they could give me a discount but no free pizza.

Sometimes this strategy works and I find something great; this, however, was one of those times when it didn't.\\n\\nMy wife and I arrived around 7 pm on Thursday and were seated right away. The restaurant was somewhere between one quarter and half full, and we were thrilled with that because we were ravenous and needed to eat five minutes ago.

There was barely any flavor to the guac and I didn't taste any of the other ingredients. Even at $5, it felt a little steep.The spicy octopus was just OK.

Aside from the different textures of the meats, neither of us could tell the difference between them. Considering all of them were supposed to be spicy, they failed to deliver on that promise, too.

Our experience was really mixed.\\n\\nThe way their Cinematic Spectacular deal works, you pre-pay for a sit down pre-fixe dinner in the dining room, and then return right before the show, which is view-able in the park in general, for a desert buffet on their lagoon side deck.  \\n\\nOur dinner experience was absolutely lovely.  Our server, Hannah, was very friendly and helpful and noticed that we'd been carrying lanyards with \\"honeymoon\\" buttons on them.  She congratulated us warmly, and ran through our dining choices, noting which options were safe for my husband.  We both started our meal with very good salads and I have the cheese ravioli, while my husband had the quinoa stuffed portabello mushroom with grilled grouper.  My ravioli was just ok, with entirely too much pesto on the plate competing with what tasted like a smoked cheese in the ravioli.  My husband's food,however, was awesome.  I'd recommend sticking with fish dishes here, and am kicking myself for not doing so.  All in all though, the food was not bad, and was definitely a step above what one would typically expect from a theme park restaurant.  \\n\\nIf this review was just for dinner, it would be a four star review.  However, we also had tickets to the desert buffet and special viewing area for the nighttime show, which I was pretty excited for since Universal does a great job with their closing shows.  When we arrived for the show, around 30 minutes prior to its start time, all of the tables were already taken, but there was ample seating along the railing closest to the lagoon.  We ordered drinks (not included in the price) and happily sat in what we thought were prime seats for viewing the show.  Once the show started, however, we realized that Lombard's had two crucial drawbacks as a viewing site.  The first was that, while the seating did face one of the screens on which movie scenes are projected, the actual fireworks were all behind us.  The second was that we were totally soaked when the underwater charges for the fireworks went off, leaving us to scurry for cover and watch the rest of the show along the restaurant's wall, peaking around the corner to see the fireworks. This was hugely disappointing to me since the whole reason we'd booked dinner there was for the unique viewing location for the fireworks, which ended up being to our backs.\\n\\nIn summation: Go to Lombard's for dinner and stick to fish for a great meal, but don't waste your money on the Cinematic Spectacular viewing party.  There are much better vantage points throughout the park."},{"name":"Emmer & Rye","address":"51 Rainey St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I was the first one of my group to show up so I went to the bar and ordered a Jamesons on the rocks.

A lot of black and leather tones, glass with etched flower designs and maroon colors imbedded tastefully in the d√©cor. The lighting was dim, however, not romantically threatening. There was soft jazz renditions of top 40 songs played very faintly in the background. It was perfect to bring a date or a close friend as you can actually have a conversation. The bathroom didn't reflect the general main d√©cor. It wasn't ghetto, however, very low grade and disappointing given the rest of the ambience of the restaurant. The eatery is hidden away near Thurlow and Robson in a Plaza, very easy to miss.\\n\\nFood: It is a pasta menu mostly, a gluten nightmare. The good news is that they do have some gluten free pasta, therefore, most of the dishes, sans the ravioli, can be substituted. I had a short ribbed pasta plate and my long time friend Kevin had  a crab ravioli dish. At first glance the dishes can be deceiving in size, however, it was very filling. Gluten free pasta can sometimes be a bitch to cook right. They got the pasta cooked down to a perfection. My white wine reduction sauce was well spiced, creamy, smooth and hit all the flavor notes in appropriate order. The ribs were okay, however, they weren't the main star of the dish. My dish was garnished with thinly fried pieces of veggies to resemble chips. Overall good platting presentation. For dessert my friend had an apple dessert (can't remember the name). The pastry part resembled a dry short bread that worked well with the caramel sauce and the vanilla gelato. The crispiness of the apple pastry allowed it stand the moisture and maintain the intended texture throughout the dessert. I had the blood orange gelato which was smooth, creamy, fresh, not too cold and reminded me of a summer's day compacted in a spoon. \\n\\nPrice: I had a Social Shopper coupon, however, it is impossible to dine for two on the coupon in full. It did, however, get us in the door. Be prepared to pay $60 on top of the bill, therefore, this is considered almost fine dining. Given the tourist district of Robson this is a given. It's not every day I get to see my brother from another mother Kevin so it was an occasion well celebrated. \\n\\nService: The service was good. The waiter took my gluten concern seriously and made sure that I was okay with my food being in contact with wheat even though I couldn't eat anything wheat related. The waiter seemed stiff and I had to work really hard to break his shell and get him to crack a smile. Not sure if it is a cultural thing not to be overly friendly.

When we finally did get sat, it was at a four-top in the back under an A/C vent instead of one of the many available two-tops by the window, which we promptly asked to be moved to. Service was thankfully better for the rest of the night.\\n\\nWe like that the menu is minimal with only a few options in each section. We started with the labneh and the red shrimp. Labneh is a misnomer because it was too \\"watery\\"/not strained enough and was closer to a Greek yogurt. That said, it was one of the best dishes that we've had anywhere all year--the fried pecan topping was so unique and delicious and paired perfectly with the roti. We were definitely sad when it was finished. The shrimp were refreshing with a nice light dressing, but weren't worth the $16 price tag. \\n\\nOur \\"mains\\" were the crab/cabbage and the confit pork shoulder. We did not care for the crab dish and most of it went uneaten--there was a sourness to the sauce that just tasted off. The pork was wonderful, especially with that insanely good beet BBQ sauce (genius, whoever came up with that one) and went well with the pickled root vegetables. But confit? Eye roll. Hellz no it wasn't.\\n\\nA note about the \\"dim sum\\" cart: while a cute idea, it wasn't, IOHO, well-executed and prices were all over the place with no rhyme or reason. Some of the dishes looked sad on their plates and it's kind of gross when the server would lift them up and talk right above them. We skipped the $4 tartare amuse-bouches, but went for the johnnycakes and roasted carrots, both of which were seriously amazing. We kind of wish we had just gotten those and not the disappointing crab dish.\\n\\nDessert looked completely unappealing as options that were trying too hard, so we passed.\\n\\nOverall, Emmer & Rye is one of those newer restaurants that ends up being worth it. Unlike Juniper or June's, which we've also been to in the past year, this place actually delivers on most of its promises. That labneh dish is one that we'll think about for years to come.

It's definitely not eye-popping from the outside but being inside is a different story. I'm definitely a fan of the restaurants that seem sort of hidden or almost like a scary place to eat because they always have something special or good. This place is no exception and compliments that perfectly.\\n\\nPrice: Pricey for sure because the portions you get are generally smaller and not worth in terms of size/filling. Some of these dishes are exceptionally small and could barely even be called an appetizer but hover around the 10-20 dollar range. However, the quality of the food is different and I'll explain in the food section shortly.\\n\\nService: Excellent! All the waitresses were super nice and attentive and were ALWAYS willing to listen to us. Very eager and encouraging to whatever questions we had about their big menu and gave us their own input/opinions on certain dishes which we always appreciate.\\n\\nFood: So good. There's so many options to choose from and I unfortunately couldn't take pictures of ALL the dishes we ate (my parents started eating before I took my phone camera out). All of them are good and offer a unique taste combination of flavor to understand that this is from Yuzu. Anytime a restaurant serves a memorable dish or dishes automatically receives high praise from me. I would definitely recommend the Chicken Karaage, Fish (I forget the name), and ramen for the finisher.\\n\\nThe only reason I can't give it a perfect five is just simply due to the fact that the portion/price ratio isn't the best. You can get amazing food and quality service but it's just too expensive sometimes when a small dish can cost more then a whole dinner somewhere else.

Figured we should have lunch with that, so also had the Frisco Melt and Patty Melt.  Both were sufficient, albeit, not quite like what they looked like in the photos.  Looked like rather ordinary grilled cheese sandwiches with very thin patties inside (hard to tell if it was actually 2 patties, but it was supposed to be).  I got the upcharged Cajun Seasoned Fries.  I was kind of thinking they'd be battered and seasoned and such, but no.  These are basically the same as ordinary (and cheaper) fries with what looks like their Fry & Steakburger seasoning sprinkled on top.  That was somewhat disappointing.  The shakes though, I thought were pretty damn good.  Service was very young (probably the kid's summer job), but nice and pretty efficient.  It was pretty rockin' and full on a late Saturday afternoon.  Prices were totally cheap for a sit-down fast casual place.

In my mind \\"eggs\\" is the noun that stands for the eggs and \\"benedict\\" is the adjective describing the style of serving the noun on an english muffin with ham and hollandaise sause. Therefore, when I think crabcake benedict, I think of a crabcake on an english muffin with ham and hollandaise sause. I know that plenty of places change the word \\"eggs\\" for whatever they replace the ham with and I just don't approve of it. Sorry... that has nothing to do with anything... Last side note:  I think eggs on crabcakes with hollandaise is called Eggs Chesapeake. \\n\\nANYWAY The point is they make a delicious crabcake, not one of those lumps of bread with crab in it, just crab meat. \\nThey did not however give me a properly poached egg. They got my food out to me with AMAZING speed, like 10 minutes tops, and they still managed to over cook my eggs in that amount of time. Like unforgivably over-poached. Like they'd just had my eggs soaking in boiling water all morning. Like they threw a hard-boiled egg on top of my crab cakes. \\nThe hollandaise was what you'd expect. \\nThe homefries looked amazing. They looked so yummy and seasoned. They were startlingly bland. I don't know how they could put on so much seasoning that the potato changed color and yet they still tasted bland. \\nIt all came with a nice serving of greens, a fresh touch to break up the heaviness of the meal. \\n\\nMy server was attentive, but unremarkable. I had better service yesterday at the CPK. If it were more busy, I'd think that she was just too tied up to have a personality, but she just wasn't very busy as there were huge spans of time where she just stood with two other servers, so I think she had plenty of time to flash a smile. \\n\\nThis restraunt gets packed and is cramped. They know this and should steadily offer to take your coat in the winter. They only do this, however, about 50% of the time (in my experience). \\n\\nIf they poached my eggs right, the crabcakes benedict would have been amazing. Despite my complaining, I'd go back... well, if other people wanted to go, I'd go too... if they didn't want to go someplace friendlier, more spacious, and more consistent."},{"name":"Lombard's Seafood Grille","address":"6000 Universal Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"3","text":"For fine dining at Universal, only one restaurant came to my mind, Mythos.  But, my daughter and I had been to Islands of Adventure; and, today was Universal Studios.  We were hungry; and, it was getting hot, although not too crowded, so we decided to duck into Lombards.  My wife said we'd been there for a corporate function; but, I just don't remember.\\n\\nFirst I was impressed by the lobby, the fountain, the hostess stand; and, the hostess, who greeted us upon coming in.  She asked if we had reservations; and, when we said we didn't, she did some checking on the computer.  A few minutes later, she led us into the dining room; an,d we were seated in a nice booth overlooking the restaurant, the fish tank, and the \\"San Francisco Bay\\" outside the large windows.\\n\\nWe started with a Shrimp Cocktail, which featured some of the best, most balanced cocktail sauce I have ever had.  Too many places are leaning toward that \\"atomic\\" horseradish, which overwhelms the delicate, sweet, shrimp.  This was PERFECT!.\\n\\nFor mains, our daughter had the Clam Chowder, which she enjoyed; and, my wife and I had a Fisherman's Basket, each.  The basket featured fried seafood, including squid, fish, oysters, shrimp, and French fries.  The seafood was all cooked perfectly; and, the fish and oysters were terrific, although there wasn't a laggard in the bunch.

The food was terrible!  I try not to have expectations when trying new restaurants, but for $ 75 and the good reputation that Watershed in Decatur had - I was hoping for better.  Luckily the friends I was with are easy going, chill people so we still had fun.  If not i would have been a complete disaster.  \\nFor the first course 3 of us got the crab cake - it tasted like a lump of bread, I couldn't even taste the crab and it was very bland - I could have done better myself.  One person got this citrus custard thing that was bizarre.  Her boyfriend is a trooper and would switch all of her dishes for her that she didn't like.  One guy got the scallop shnitzel which 'won' that round, was determined to be the most edible option for first course.  By the time the second course came out, we were hoping it would start to get better... not the case.  2 of us got the duck confit on corncake thing - that was yummy.. but everyone elses food was so bad one of them returned hers and changed it for the duck dish. 2 people got the beef tartare with garlic chips - it looked and apparently tasted like a scoop of raw ground beef (i would not even try it - and i will try ANYTHING).  The garlic chips were dubbed 'garlic funyans'.  the cabbage rolls were yucky - the girl who ordered them would not eat them or return them.  Our waiter kept coming up asking us how we were doing, but we were not doing well.. and her boyfriend  had him take back her uncooked raw beef and bring her duck confit dish.  now it's time for round 3, and it is almost a joke becuase we now are hoping at least 1 person got something that is edible.  3 of us got the ribeye.. everyone was in agreement that it was over-seared and cooked for too long - the server asked me if i medium was ok and I said sure- but Steve pointed out that the chef's choice is usually medium rare which is what I usually order.. but this meat had been cooked for too long and was chewy/rubbery.  Apparently the lobster ravioli that came with a couple people's ribeye was good.  The redfish was 'bland'  but the fried eggplant entree was good per my friends, I did not try either of them.  Then for dessert - chocolate terrine was a chocolate fudge but too salty for some, the sweet potato creme brulee won that round, actually tasted yummy and great texture.  The other dessert 'the mess' had a werid texture and some ingredient that we could not figure out, but it was not horrible.  Everyone else said the wine was good, trying to find the silver lining.\\nOne other comment - our server was ok but did not tell us anything about the food.  in retrospect I could have asked, but usually after coming back a couple times and we had not yet decided I would hope for our server to offer to make suggestions or help out.\\nI would never recommend this restaurant to anyone, and i will not be going back.  I hope they get the message and start working on improving their food.  Maybe less items on the menu, and concentrate on improving the dishes that were decent.

You are not expected to \\"clean\\" the table -- just clear it of your own plates. \\n\\nThis is typically laid out the moment you arrive, and there are signs that show you where everything is. It's meant to add to the \\"coming home\\" aspect of the experience. \\n\\nThe kitchen staff will sometimes help out with plates if you're there with small children, or if you're elderly and/or differently abled, but honestly it is one of the hallmarks of the restaurant, so IF that's not your thing, then that's not your thing -- totally cool, just don't go in surprised.\\n\\nThis place is a pillar of the community, and the food is just as good today as it was 3 years ago (when I originally posted this review). They're very amenable to customizing your meal, but everything I've had straight from the menu is good as well. Their hot sauce selection is second to none, the music is great, the salt shakers divine, and the baked goods that they keep near the till are a must-try for your drive or walk home afterwards."},{"name":"Cactus Club Cafe","address":"1085 Canada Place","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"This place was packed!!

Every time I have visited a McMenamins, I have been sorely disappointed from nearly every angle. The first time I ate at one (East Vancouver location), the hostess was incredibly slow to get us seated. Once seated in a booth, my boyfriend and I made our selections within ten minutes. Twenty minutes after that, our order was finally taken by a very uninterested waitress. About forty-five minutes after that, our very cold pasta dishes were brought to us. We were never checked in on in the hour we spent consuming said dishes, so we never had the opportunity to complain. Our check was passed off wordlessly, and we subsequently paid and left, annoyed. Hoping it was just a fluke, or maybe just not our waitresses day, we gave another location another try months later. We were rudely awakened by a count of six long hairs in our food. The waiters were much more attentive to the issue, but when given water with which to wash down the discovered hairs, we were slapped in the face by a distinct flavor of carbonated earth worms. Maybe we're gluttons for punishment, but we tried the Edgefield location in a last-ditch effort to understand the hype we had heard here and there - *sigh* I think we finally learned our lesson. Cold food, disinterested service, and an overall crappy experience.

I hoped it was shared w/everyone...Anyway. I sit and wait. And wait. Almost 20mins. later (this is 4:15 p.m.) The number punches runs by, puts food on table and keeps going. I could not believe how disgusting this looked. 1/2 slice of overly crispy bacon and totally black, no color but black, slice of bacon..never seen any piece of meat this burned. I call him back and point out that \\"crispy\\" and \\"black\\" are not the same word.

And yes all the beef is grass fed. \\nMy wife had the wild salmon. It came out a little too rare but they quickly fixed it and it was perfect. \\n\\nFinally yes had to dessert. Chocolate decadence and it was. Not too sweet and perfectly chocolate. Almost like a pudding. \\n\\nYes next time we visit Atlanta there is no doubt we are coming back.

Yes, I enjoy exploiting the good deeds of others. I don't have a lot of exciting things to say about this place; it's your typical chain steakhouse. This is gonna be a boring review. \\n\\nAnyhoo, here are some comparisons:\\n\\n- Like Outback, but not as cheesy\\n- A little bit better quality, but more expensive than Fridays\\n- Much better than Applebees (aka CRAPplebees - I just made that up)\\n- Slightly ahead of Ruby Tuesdays, but no kick-ass salad bar\\n- Exactly the same as Texas Roadhouse\\n\\nWe got the shrimp and lobster dip for an appetizer. It was rich and melty, with small shrimps and a few chunks of canned lobster floating in a sea of liquified cheese. Satisfying. \\n\\nIt came with red, white, and blue tortilla chips. For America!\\n\\nThe steaks were in the $15-24 range. I got the bigger sirloin (12 oz.) and it was $16. It was fairly well-cooked, a little more medium than medium-rare, but palatable. My roommate enjoyed the large salmon fillet he ordered. \\n\\nI told him he shouldn't order fish at a chain steakhouse.\\nHe told me to go have a heart attack.\\n\\nParking was a pain in the ass tonight due to the Neil Diamond concert that was taking place. We had to park about a half-mile away. However, the girls next to us were given free tickets to the concert by a random guy at the bar, which was pretty cool. \\n\\nThis incident led me to the following conclusion about the Longhorn Steakhouse:\\n\\nIf you're a cute girl and come to this restaurant, you might get something for free. On the other hand, if you're a mid-twenties Asian guy on a man-date with your 41-year old roommate, people might think your friend is a chicken hawk and you'll probably get your silverware 10 minutes after your Caesar salad."},{"name":"DW Brewpub","address":"820 Morrissey Blvd","city":"Boston","stars":"2.5","text":"Weird spot - it's a bowling alley.

The food was like my mother used to make it. Their sauces and ingredients were perfect and authentic. \\n\\nOne can generally judge a good Japanese restaurant by their miso soup and how the tempura is cooked, and the dashi (dipping broth)...perfect. The beef was a NY strip and chicken thigh was tender and juicy. The price points were great as the beef and tempura combo was $17.95 and the ramen was $9.95.

I came here last week (April 25, 2012) for the grand opening.  All I can say is \\"This sh*t is bananas, B-A-N-A-N-A-S!\\"\\n\\nI can only assume that IKEA dropped some serious coin on this new store.  The large sign out front can be seen from kilometres away.  I saw at least a dozen auxiliary RCMP directing traffic and they even had a sign on the north end of the Knight Street bridge warning that there was a special event and to use alternate routes.\\n\\nI've never been inside the IKEA Coquitlam store so I can't compare it to the new Richmond location.  This new store is absolutely huge.\\n\\nI have to admit, I was a little envious of the kids in the ballroom.  It seems huge in comparison to the ballroom in the old store and there was even a lineup of parents and kids to get in.  The kids inside seemed to be having an awesome time.\\n\\nThe new restaurant on the upper floor is the size of a mall food court.  It's very bright with large windows and opens up over the lower floor.  There's also a cute kids area with child-sized tables and chairs.  The kitchen is huge and has two sides serving the same food in order to be able to serve patrons twice as fast.  The food is just OK, but is priced reasonably.  It's a good way to fuel up before a long trek through the showroom.\\n\\nThe showroom is also on the upper floor and is extensive with lots of furniture layout and decorating ideas.  Even if you're not an IKEA fan, I think it's worth coming here to get some ideas if you plan to re-decorate.\\n\\nAfter the showroom, you go back down to the lower floor to the marketplace.  I love the little knick-knacks that can be found here as well as reasonably priced and stylish tableware, kitchenware, and lighting options.  Past the showroom is the self-serve warehouse.  This is much bigger than the one in the old store and, as such, they are able to carry a larger number of items than before.  No need to make the trek out to Coquitlam any more for that elusive piece of Swedish furniture.\\n\\nDuring my trip through the marketplace, there was an announcement: \\"...there is a code 99 at the top of the escalator.\\" A few minutes later, there was another announcement, \\"...the code 99 is over.\\"  A friend Googled it later and informed me that \\"code 99\\" means lost child and, when the child is found, they announce that it is over.  Whew, another one of life's mysteries solved.\\n\\nI was a little disappointed in IKEA's \\"Everyone is a Coupon\\" campaign.  I asked an employee about it as we were checking out and she said that there was no additional discount at the cashier, and that the deals were only on certain items.  I guess I was hoping for something like 10% off per person you bring with you (up to 2 people) or something to that effect.\\n\\nIn any case, this is a pretty cool new store.  I can only hope the traffic dies down soon.\\n\\nTip: Don't get a cart from the parking lot if you plan on looking around in the showroom upstairs.  It can be a pain to take 2 elevators from the parking lot to the showroom level.  Instead, get a cart at the lower marketplace level once you've looked around the upstairs showroom.\\n\\nFood for thought: I wonder if they'll rename Sweden Way now that the IKEA is no longer there.  How about \\"Home Depot Way\\"?  :P"},{"name":"Enigma Restaurant","address":"4397 10th Avenue W","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"Very disappointing. Server and staff are sub par at best.

I've been twice now and have had good service both times. The quality of fish is amazing, the presentation impressive, and the taste... to die for. \\n\\nWe started of with some deep fried miniature freshwater crabs. Perfect presentation and a crispy and delicious treat. Pretty much crab potato chips with the legs and all... \\n\\nAfter the crabs I was getting really excited. The baked green mussel (dynamite) was the best I have EVER had. We are always trying mussels at every sushi place that has them and these were by far the best. Served with lettuce and yummy ginger dressing too. \\n\\nThe avocado kama was OK. Not really my thing but I know alot of people are crazy about it. \\n\\nAlso had sunomono with sweet and wonderful octopus. \\n\\nWe ordered a pretty good sampling of the sushi menu. The escolar (actually seared and sake marinated) was amazing and melted in my mouth. This is the first time I've ever had escolar presented this way and I loved it. \\n\\nI'm a fiend for amaebi (sweet shrimp) and they had ebi botan on the menu so we got 2 each. By far the best ebi I have had. Usually restaurants only serve the fried shrimp head with the raw tail but this place also serves the deep fried tail shell as well which may be my most favorite thing in the entire world. \\n\\nWhat else? Really fresh white fish with chili (shima zushi), maguro zuke (special marinated tuna), and ankimo (monfish liver). Probably the best sushi I've ever had in a single sitting. \\n\\nWe also had some spicy hand rolls which were nothing short of amazing. \\n\\nI really admire this restaurant for expressing the importance of eating sushi the right way, not mixing wasabi and soy sauce, not biting sushi in half (nare), and only using soy sauce on certain types of sushi. They also have fresh wasabi and good quality gari which actually make a huge difference with your sushi experience. It's the little things, as well as the terrific quality. \\n\\nI am IN LOVE with this place. I will probably never go to another sushi bar. The prices are decent too! \\n\\nI can understand someone having a bad first impression going here (because it can happen at the best of restaurants) but I have to urge you to ignore the negative remarks and see for yourself. \\n\\nBEST.

Wasn't greasy or chewy.  The sauce was amazing!\\n--Jumbo Lump Crab Cake - Heavy on the crab and tasty.  Didn't taste like mashed breadcrumbs with a hint of crab.\\n--Fried Ravioli - These were really good but not too exceptional.  I'd definitely eat them again, but wouldn't crave them.\\n--Little Neck Clams - Didn't eat any but heard they were delicious!  Their necks were just too small for my taste.  =P\\n\\nSalsicce Pizza - The crust was the perfect balance between thick and thin.  Crisp on the bottom yet soft inside.  Great flavor and not skimpy on the toppings.\\n\\nNegative stars for the price, which was just too high to justify.  The fact that to visit this establishment  you have to valet your car because there's no garage is a big turn off, too.

I drove in to see my sister, and she recommended we go to lunch here, saying it was a favorite of hers.  I am so glad she did.  I was really pleased by the menu choices.  They had a ton of great options.  The food was fresh, and delish.  The service was fantastic.  I had the veggie enchiladas which were fantastic.  the rice was good.  My middle daughter ate the chicken taquitos.  She didn't care for the melted cheese sauce on them, but I think that was just her weird thing about melted foods.  The only real con was that the beans, black beans that were in a refried style, had a different flavor profile than one would expect.  There was something in them that turned both my 9 and 5 year old, who have grown up eating Mexican and love black beans, off.  Neither would eat it.  They were a little on the salty side, but I don't think that was it.  Some people may really like them, though.

I went with three friends on a Saturday night and put my name in at 7:45.  I was getting annoyed when we went for a drink and came back and still were not even the next party by 9:15.  However, when I made this point to the hostess, she made arrangements for us to eat at an extra seating space so we wouldn't miss our 10:40 movie.  \\n\\nThe waiter, who had to take us on as an extra \\"table,\\" was super nice and so excited that I found myself shaking his hand when he agreed with the hostess that he would take care of us.  The people who work here really are fabulous, as some of the reviews mention.  Even though I'm not a Top Chef person (although my friends were), I was slightly disappointed I didn't get to thank the chef myself for the experience.\\n\\nI didn't pay that much attention to the drink list, because at that point I was so hungry I didn't want to waste room for the food, but I would say it was adequate, with some creative cocktails in addition to beer and wine.\\n\\nThe food truly made me glad to be alive and thankful that humans have taste buds.  They were out of biscuits (I forgive them, it's a brand new place and it was already 9:30--give them a chance to work out those kinds of kinks), so we had fried okra and hush puppies.  As for the fried okra, it was served whole, which, as my friend who grew up in Texas (but was born in Newton) pointed out, improved the breading to okra ratio tremendously over the usual cut up okra presentation.  The okra itself was smooth and silky and seemed fresh.  I want to begin talking about the hush puppies by saying that I don't normally like hush puppies, but these were unlike anything I've ever had before and broke the mold.  They were amazing, with hints of what we detected to be cumin and accompanied by what seemed to be a sweet (but not too sweet) cream sauce, which we broke down and began using on both the okra and the hush puppies because it was so good.\\n\\nFor the main meal, I had pork belly, even though I normally hate gristle.  It was about 80% solid meat and the fat was cooked such that there was no stringiness to it at all.  It was almost like eating duck in the sense of how well the fat blended in with the meat.  The macaroni and cheese made me feel like I had never had macaroni and cheese before in my life.  It was so flavorful and the bread crumbs were so buttery, without any of the greasy feel of butter or cheese, that I would say nothing I've ever had compares---this made Red Bones M&C seem like Lean Cuisine.  The farm salad was truly amazing, and as I said to the waiter afterward, \\"[w]hen is salad EVER amazing?\\"  It was made of fresh brussels sprouts in lieu of lettuce, and had a smoky essence, some mouth-watering cheese (I think parmesan), and delectable nuts.  \\n\\nMy friends had brisket and the ribs.  The ribs were not dry at all and had very nice meat with no visible gristle, although I like the pork belly better, and the brisket went very well with the BBQ sauce on the table.  The only negative with the brisket was that it did have a bit of fat, but probably that added to the flavor, which was noteworthy.  The broccoli and cheese was good and had a little spice kick to it, but I would say the macaroni and cheese was better and cheesier.  \\n\\nAll in all, I loved the staff, I liked the atmosphere, and I can honestly say that I was in disbelief of how good the food tasted.

My favorite is the Messy Caterpillar Maki; I highly recommend this, but I'll let you find out for yourself what it's made of.

This serves well as it can suit both the raw fish consuming novice and those who just can't make up their minds.

There are sandwiches or trays, each served with one 'scoop' of a hot and cold side. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken tray with the potato salad and mac and cheese. The chicken was very good but the batter was missing something...maybe something as just a bit more salt. There are options for $2 each, 'hot shake' or the 'hot honey' fried chicken but I was curious to taste in it's original form before tweaking. The potato salad was super! Lots of fresh dill. I LOVED the mac and cheese, my favorite of the whole meal. My husband got the prime beef sandwich with the potato salad and the bbq beans. The sandwich was good overall but he thought it was just a little on the dry side and was helped by some bbq sauce. He also really liked the pickles as well as the choice of sides.

It ended up being way larger than we expected-- not an issue with calamari, though-- and the squid themselves appeared fresh, no frozen.\\n\\nMy dining partner and I both opted for sushi, sharing a large selection from the specialty maki and choosing a few a la carte pieces of nigiri. The red dragon roll was tasty with shrimp tempura, cucumber, spicy mayo, avocado, eel, masago and teriyaki sauce  and the High Street roll was equally delicious with tuna, salmon, avocado, cream cheese and masago topped with spicy mayo. Other standouts are creative specials like the shrimp asparagus rolls filled with steamed asparagus, cooked shrimp, some cucumber, and a touch of cream cheese.

The density of macbooks, academic journals, and timbuk2 bags may be quite staggering at first. The antinomy of bourgeois thought and praxis, for instance between environmental ethics and really well designed leather products, comes up a lot in this culture. It feels as strangely self-conscious as it is self-indulgent, and I don't know what to make of it or my place in it.\\n\\nI don't come to Diesel for the sandwiches.

I am happy to report it holds both cold fruity beverages AND my hot morning coffee without fail. \\n\\nThe service seemed a little slow at first but I watched the ladies there and they were moving fast and working hard. I think the drinks just take a while because of all of the fresh fruit and blending and such that goes into them. The price ranges from about $9 for a drink at the cheapest, all the way up to $40 for the volcano that includes magical cinnamon fire (hence the donut smell), dry ice and ooohs and ahhs. The table next to us ordered one and it looked like fun, but I couldn't bring myself to splurge that much even on my birthday. \\n\\nMy main gripe about this place is that despite the large selection, almost all of the drinks on the menu had the same fruits and juices combined in them.

I ordered the burger that everyone seems to rave about, I was extremely disappointed. The server recommended medium rare - which I love - but there wasn't a hint of pink in the burger. The burger was handmade - great, but it fell apart on the plate as it was served to me. The bun was dry. To be honest, all I tasted was dryness with sauce. Then there is the 5% health and wellness surcharge. I'm all for offering livable wages and our surcharge only translated into a few bucks and so not a big deal. But what I didn't like was a) the surcharge and b) it was hidden in small type at the bottom. To be honest, reading the check with the surcharge made me feel like an airline passenger - being nickled and dimed for everything. Next thing you know, they will be charging for the bathroom, or cleaning dishes. I'd far prefer to raise all the prices by 5% and a statement at the bottom of the menu saying \\"Thank you for your support...We're able to offer health insurance to our staff....\\" All that said, not all was bad.

We  had gyoza (steamed) with their wonderful dipping sauce and each had chirashi. The dish was artfully prepared, and most of the fish slices, along with the vegetables, were quite good. The portions were on the moderate side for the price, but we both agreed that, having had chirashi at many other restaurants, the rice and the luscious salmon were the best we'd ever had."},{"name":"Bagel 13","address":"6725 N Cocoa Blvd","city":"Port St. John","stars":"4","text":"Complete disorganization.

I was thinking I'd try coming here and get something to go.  I walked in and nobody said we'll be with you in a moment. Finally 10 minutes later the girl at the register asked me something but I couldn't hear her. I said I'm sorry I can't hear you. She was talking extremely low when clearly she knew it was loud in there. She seemed like she didn't want to be bothered. I was telling her that I wanted baby back ribs with two sides. She said OK (sarcastically while giving me a blank stare). After that I said I wanted a salad and she then turns to the young lady and says where are the salads. I asked her was the salad considered a side and she didn't say anything. The young lady next to her at the other register said yes it is a side. Maybe she was asking where are the salads because she didn't know where it was on the register. I don't know but I do know she was rude. I then told her I didn't want onions or tomatoes... she sarcastically replied OK (blank stare again). I Then asked her could she show me where the sides are on the menu. She just starred at me! I have never been treated like this in a restaurant before. This was the worst customer service I have ever received. I decided to just walk off after I asked her where are the sides on the menu and she said nothing. I wanted to ask for a manager but I just felt like it was pointless. This was extremely upsetting! Never again!!!!!!"},{"name":"Do At The View","address":"955 W Marietta St NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Today is Monday.  I went to Do on Saturday, and I am still in disbelief that I paid $16 for an appetizer sized personal pan pizza and a side Caesar salad.  I don't know...maybe it's just me but that's a ridiculously high price.  Add on to that tax and grat for a party of 6 and my bill was about $20!  So no...just no.  Especially considering the food was nothing special that blew my mind.  The flavors of the pizza were interesting ( I had the baroque) but the crust was a little hard to chew after a while. The salad was...a Caesar salad.  \\nOn to the service...below average.  They've got this ipad ordering system (I guess that's really what I'm paying for) which I don't care for.  I rather place my order with real people.  Then you have to call for assistance on there.  The waitress didn't come until about 5 mins later and most likely because we ended up flagging her down.  Service was slow and it wasn't even that packed.  \\nNow regardless of all this, Do does have a cool and unique concept and the interior is really nice.  They have a sky view patio where you can eat.  Great view of the city.  \\nAlso, music was ok.  Some songs were just so off to play in my opinion for the crowd that was there.  Should have been more upbeat choices.\\nOverall, I probably won't be back.

I scoped out the website, saw they were open until 8pm, and headed over about 645.  I got to the store at 7pm, and they were turning of the \\"open\\" sign, but the door was open and there were some folks standing around waiting for smoothies.  I walked up to the counter, they guy in the back looked up and said \\"I'm sorry man, we just closed.\\" \\n\\nAre they not familiar with their own hours?  Is it suddenly totally ok to just ignore your customers when you're in the food industry?\\n\\nThis was just a terrible introduction, especially after I was so excited to try it.

We joined some friends here for restaurant week in Midtown, and we had a nice time. The atmosphere (see what I did there?) was good, as the interior had a bit of a classic decor and was cozy.

For appetizers, we had onion soup and escargot, both French classics, and both good. Entrees were duck, which I felt was ok, and my wife had the beef. Both were sufficiently flavorful and moist, but I wouldn't describe them as excellent. Desserts were pretty good too, but nothing exactly knocked me off my feet.\\n\\nI'd definitely go back here, as we had a great time, and I think everything was slightly above average, but it didn't have that je ne sais quoi to get that 5th star.

I LOVE Ru San's. I've been going here since my sophomore year in college which was like 2012. They have a few locations but none of them ever disappoint. Such a wide variety of sushi's but so many other dishes. Their menu is huge...only reason why I didn't take pictures. They have fried rice, sashimi, seafood entrees etc. The amount of food they have on their menu is slightly overwhelming but no big deal. Specifically at this location we've had this amazing server twice and she remembered us. Now I used to be a server so idk if she was just being nice and acting like she remembered us but idc she was great lol don't remember her name though but she's a brunette with a cute world tattoo on her arm lol. This time around I got the dynamite seafood roll which was amazing. I wish it came with more but I was satisfied once I had some of my boyfriends house fried rice, also equally as delicious.
