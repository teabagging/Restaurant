I only heard of it because my fiancee went there one night while pub crawling with the girls around Quincy Center... and also because a deal came up for a certificate for Kama Lounge on CoupMe (which is like Groupon).\\n\\nAnyway, we found easy parking considering its location near the Fat Cat and the plaza with the Fours and Texas Saloon. We were greeted at the door by a young guy who promptly seated us and upon request gave us some food recommendations.\\n\\nWe had been out earlier in the day with friends and so we were only hungry for a relatively small bite, so we started with drinks. The fiancee ordered a glass of the 14 Hands riesling (which was excellent and quite reasonably priced) and I ordered the special cocktail - a pineapple mojito. Our waitress Gwen promptly jumped behind the bar and made the drinks... and the pineapple mojito was much, much better than anticipated. It was truly outstanding. Plus the wine was accompanied by a small, free cheese plate with tiny pieces of four cheeses, toasted bread and some fresh, red grapes. Mmm!\\n\\nWe perused the tapas menu as well as the menu of the connected restaurant Bistro Chi (available for service in the lounge). At our request, Gwen also made recommendations. With that in mind, the fiancee ordered the vegetarian lettuce wraps and I ordered the kalbi style beef skewers with corn salad and the bacon-wrapped scallops in leek soup special.\\n\\nHer wraps were delicious with a bit of a kick. The only downside was that the lettuce was so crisp that it was hard to roll up without dropping bits... but it wasn't a first date after all... we're nearly married, haha.\\n\\nMy beef came out first and it was phenomenal. Seriously. I had instant sense memory of Korean BBQ I often had while living in Japan... the sauce was fantastic and the meat was outstanding. The corn salad (sweet corn shaved off the cob alongside halved cherry tomatoes) was better than expected! It blended well with the sauce! I literally cleaned the plate of whatever I could get on a fork.\\n\\nThe scallops came out right after, and it was two scallops on a bed of leek soup. Just as the ma√Ætre d' had explained (much to my disbelief), the leek soup and preparation process somehow toned down the often-overpowering saltiness of the bacon and scallop together. Indeed, it was a much more savory dish, and the saltiness was somehow curbed. The leek soup was outside my wheelhouse, but it was delicious with a fair amount of black pepper in it for a kick.\\n\\nNear the end of the meal, a gentleman started performing acoustic renditions of songs quickly and deftly going from Jeff Buckley's \\"Hallelujah\\" right into Death Cab For Cutie and then into Men At Work, followed by Peter Gabriel. As a musician I really appreciated how he made the material his own, and how these seemingly disparate artists' songs were blended masterfully for a pleasant audio experience.\\n\\nGwen was an absolute star. She had an awesome personality and friendly demeanor; she knew the menu very well and made a hell of a drink! She is the perfect ambassador for this spot to people like ourselves (young locals just passing through to try it out).\\n\\nI was told that Tuesdays will be an acoustic night from now on, while Thursdays offer an open-mic night style. Saturday is also live music and Friday is a DJ.\\n\\nThe vibe of this place is neat. A little modern, a little hipster, a little casual, a little swanky and urban... but not overwhelming. It was conceptually similar to the Foundation Room and House of Blues general vibe, but a lot less of a statement... it's very casual. The only downside is that the place is a bit dark with the dark walls, somewhat dark carpet patterns, dark ceiling, dark chandeliers and dark furniture (tables and chairs). Aside from that, it's a win. Can't wait to get back!

First of all, I was amazed (and extremely torn) by the flavor choices. Honestly, such unique options... how on earth was I supposed to decide. I saw they had the tasting flight option so I asked the woman working how big the scoops were (it was just me after all). She said they were 2oz, about the size of a golf ball. I figured that would be about two \\"normal scoops\\" in any other setting so I decided to go for it. They ended up being pretty generous \\"2oz scoops\\" but somehow I found it within me to power through. \\n\\nI settled on the Duck fat caramel, pear and blue cheese, strawberry balsamic with black pepper and the sourdough with olive oil chocolate. All of the tables were full so I planned on finding a spot on the floor where I was out of the way and could dig in. But as I turned around, a woman said she was clearing a spot for me at their table. As I sat down I realized they were employees of Salt & Straw, tasting pastries they are considering adding to their menu.

Instead of an English muffin, the egg is served on top of some Taylor ham (really, it's fancy Spam) and a stack of crisped potatoes au gratin style - everything one bite is stellar.\\n\\nThe accompanying salad wasn't my favorite, but it did provide a nice counterbalance with the slight heaviness you'd expect from eggs benedict.

You can tell that she truly cared about the patrons and dining experience and not the money; we wanted to order about twice as much as we ended up getting, but she actually stopped us because she was worried it would be too much food... and she was right! We split an appetizer and an entree and we were almost too full by the end of it.

Ping has always been one of my go-to spots when i have friends visiting from out of town.  The menu is fun for those who are adventurous eaters (albeit it a bit pricey for what you get) but the food is consistently good and my guests always leave happy with bellies full.  \\n\\nI called ahead to inquire about getting a table for my large party of 7.  I was informed that they no longer did day-of reservations, but we were welcome to walk-in.  So i pressed further to see how likely it would be for my party to get seated at around 830.  He said that it could possibly be a short wait or long wait depending on how busy they get.  This was not especially helpful, but fair enough.  So I made reservations at Davis Street Tavern as a backup and headed down to Ping to see if we could get in.  Luckily, we were promptly seated thanks to an 8 top that had was a no-show.  \\n\\nOur waitress was helpful throughout the ordering process offering suggestions for drinks and advising the table on things to order from the long and unfamiliar menu.  When the food started to come out, the first item put in front of my area of the table was salapao (steamed pork bun), which we began to divide up to share.  A few minutes later (with the salapao mostly eaten) the waitress came by and explained that we had ordered the ju pa bao (pork chop bun) and that the salapao was supposed to go to the other end of the table.  She quickly said that she would bring another salapao for the person who ordered it.  The rest of the dinner went by without affair.  \\n\\nThen came time to settle the bill.  Because my side of the table ordered way more than the other end, I asked the waitress if she could split out my end of the table's portion because dividing the bill evenly (my usual method) would clearly be unfair to the lighter eating end of the table.  She politely responded that it was against policy to split checks, but that she would gladly help us identify who had eaten what from the 15+ strange-sounding (and unmemorable) items ordered.  \\n\\nShe dropped off the check and I started to try and pick out what items we ordered, when i noticed she charged us for two salapao's.  When she came back, i mentioned to her that she had charged us for two salapao's even though we only ordered one.  She immediately game me attitude and said, \\"Since you consumed it, I thought i would charge you for it.\\"  Then quickly huffed, \\"You want me to take it off, i'll take it off.\\"  This seemed like an extreme over-reaction over a mistaken $4 pork bun that she mistakenly placed in front of us and which we had mistaken eaten thinking it was the other pork bun we ordered.  \\n\\nSo she took it off the bill...BUT ADDED 18% GRATUITY!!!!   She might as well have come over to my table and given me the bird!  Had she not flipped on the attitude and just removed the item she would have easily gotten at least 20% as she had been very helpful all evening.  Needless to say, she didn't help us decipher what we all had ordered and it took about 10 painful minutes for everyone to figure out what they owed.\\n\\nI left Ping thoroughly annoyed by their poor customer service...from their no-same-day reservations policy, their no split check policy, and their 18% F-you policy.  \\n\\nI will not be bringing other out of town visitors back."},{"name":"Beat Brasserie","address":"13 Brattle St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"To die for - so excited to have this new gem around the corner.\\n\\nFood:\\n-lamb nachos - delicious, salty spicy and hit the spot without being too cheesy\\n-calamari - a tiny bit overdone, but delicious overall, especially the veggies\\n-earth bowl - oh my god.

Had a 'heritage tomato salad', 2 of us ordered gnocchi, one had the spaetzele, and I had the 'Monday special', spaghetti and meatballs, with a simple sangiovese. The dinner was delightful; excellent, friendly service, excellent bread with dinner (and good olive oil), and nothing was excessively salted. The pastas were light, airy, very satisfying; the 4 large meatballs tested my appetite; and the cannoli for dessert were perfect --not too sweet, crunchy shell, and cold. Very good food, well-prepared and presented, in a friendly and low key atmosphere. Not at all stuffy or pompous like the departed Genoa. We split the bill 2 ways between our families and, with a generous tip, our half was $84. The only downside was that the physical environment is physically hard -- concrete floor, hard walls, moderately irritating piped in music; so the ambient noise was unpleasant.

The girls called me the morning of just to confirm we were still going to be a party of 16 so they could get everything set up. And set-up they were the second I arrived! This spot is uber-cool and definitely an Austin hot spot. Walking up the stairs I noticed our large table ready to go- perfectly decorated for a birthday celebration with cute little flowers placed throughout the table. We even had a couple of kids in our group, and they made sure to grab highchairs for the youngsters as well.\\n\\nNow, I wouldn't exactly recommend Swifts Attic for kiddos, but it's my own fault for picking a more grown-up place for people I knew would have kids in tow. But like I said, Swifts Attic made sure our entire party was comfortable, and we sure did appreciate it!\\n\\nAnother plus to our experience was how easy our server made it to split checks. While other places in town turn up their noses to people who ask to split the bill, our gal didn't bat an eyelash! She understood we'd all be separate.\\n\\nOn to the food and beverage! \\n\\nLike many other spots in Austin, Swifts Attic also offers $1 mimosas on Sunday. Score!!!!! If I wasn't driving, I may have stayed there all day just to enjoy their pomegranate, grapefruit and classic orange juice mimosa options. \\n\\nSo, there's not a kid's menu and many of the items listed on their brunch menu are a bit different. But there is a \\"Straight Plate\\" with scrambled eggs, sausage, bacon, homefries and a small salad.

Many of the guests ordered egg whites, spinach and other boring healthy things. But a special thanks to the chef for accommodating our party's needs once again.\\n\\nI ordered the Croque Madame.

But still can be a hassle on a Saturday night.\\n\\nThis review is for Saturday, August 15th, 2009\\n\\nHad a small 10 min wait, so we had drinks in the bar.  Once seated....found the floor to be a bit uneven....maybe they went overboard on trying to make it \\"authentic\\" and old?  ;)\\n\\nThe waiter arrived and got drink orders and recommended the Tejas Chicken for an appetizer.

My sister's hair was on fire....but she liked the chicken...only had 1 piece of the 4....so....I think it was beyond her level of spice.\\n\\nAnyways, we ordered, I got the Blackened Chicken with Jambalaya and she got the Corn and Black Bean Empanadas.  I've been trying to help my sister \\"expand\\" her pallet and explaining not ALL Mexican is spicy.  So she tried it.  And she really enjoyed it.  Half way through the meal she noticed that there wasn't any meat in her dish.....well, that's what it said...Corn and Black Bean....so no meat.  She loved it anyways.\\n\\nMe?  Having lived 12 years in the Dallas area, this is the FIRST time I've found a chef who could duplicate the proper spice in a blackening rub/sauce.  The chicken was \\"melt in my mouth\\" delicious!  As was the jambalaya with it.\\n\\nWe also split a House Salad....which is big enough for 3...maybe 4?\\n\\nThe best part....other than the great food and excellent service...was the bill.  With all that, drinks and everything, we spent $29.  including tax.

The fried yucca was pretty good, but I more liked the cod patties, especially because of the spicy sauce that accompanied it.\\n\\nAs for drinks, if you're ordering wine, go by the glass.  Their pours are substantial, so you're not going to save any money ordering a bottle.  And you might get stuck with a whole bottle of thin white wine, like the one we ordered, that almost tasted like half wine/half water.

I didn't particularly love the feijoada completa ($18.95), which is a black bean stew with pork, sausage and bacon.  The fish moqueca ($16) was pretty good, but next time, I would try the mariscada ($22.95) instead, which is listed on the restaurant's website as a \\"must try.\\"  But the star was the shrimp bobo ($16.95), which was a stew of shrimp, tomato, cilantro, yucca cream & onion.

The mac and cheese could have been a little cheesier however it was still pretty good.  Succotash left a little to be desired simply because I've had it so many times at other places and although they used most of the same ingredients, I wasn't impressed.  It tasted like corn salad with lima beans mixed with Italian salad dressing (not bad but not traditional succotash).  I washed my meal down with their lemonade, it was wonderful.

I wondered whether the skill level would be right -- my wife has mastered some fairly complex dishes, so I was worried she would find the class easy and wouldn't learn anything. That wasn't an issue -- she learned a lot, and said the skill level matched her perfectly. At the same time, I cook but have much less experience than her, and yet the class wasn't over my head. That says a lot about Mark's pedagogical acumen. He makes you feel at home, from the aesthetic style of his kitchen, to his friendly and open personality, to his starting the class with coffee/tea.

There are actual bananas in the drink, but it isn't overly sugary nor too sweet. It will be my go-to drank on any subsequent visits. I left with a nice buzz.  I had the chicken empanadas as an appetizer. The empanadas I make are better  but these were okay. They were actually enough for me to eat considering I'd been drinking, but I went ahead and had the shrimp fajitas entree anyway. They were meh. I suppose I agree with the other reviewers who said the food is just okay. As far as the drinks, I think the bartender vetted me in typical fashion to make sure I was gonna be a big spender/tipper.

She was even rude to customers who were calling in, picking up the phone, barking about holding, and putting them on hold without confirming if they wanted to wait.

The wings were consistent with the other reviews, soggy unbreaded and undercooked... Also tasted like we're baked in the toaster oven. The buffalo chicken pizza was horrible, the (grilled?) chicken pieces were dry, the crust was bland, the buffalo sauce was basically non existent or you could see it but could not taste it.

The salad I got was awesome but the ingredients are now escaping me. For a final dish I had pasta that was woven into little baskets around gouda cheese with romanesco cauliflower. Holy moly the pasta was good. I think it might have been the best pasta I've ever had while in Boston.  The plate looked REALLY small, and I was initially disappointed but it wound up being the perfect portion.

The only thing that was lacking was our service.  Our waiter was very inattentive and only came back once after greeting us, to give us the check.

I ordered a small black olive, artichoke heart, roasted garlic pizza.  I was told it would be 10-15 minutes.  After 15 minutes, I did see what looked like my pizza come out of their little conveyor belt oven.  Unfortunately, there was also someone who had a confused look on her face and was checking it with the receipt.  I am only assuming that someone put the wrong topping(s) on the pizza.  Did they bother to tell me this was the case or that I would have to wait for a whole new pizza to be made?  NO.\\n\\nI finally walked out of the place about 35 minutes after walking in.  The pizza looked good and I was curious about the white creamy sauce that came with the pizza.  When I got to my room, I quickly opened the box and dipped the pizza in the cream.  It was actually a taste I had never experienced before.  The sesame crust was also a surprise.  I want to say it was better than a 2-star experience, but the fact that no one bothered to explain the issues that seemed to plague my pizza or even apologize for the delay left a bad taste in my mouth.

The meat was at about the standard I would expect from your standard pig joint in the South, which is unfortunately the most positive thing I can say about my experience here. My order (and those of everyone else I saw ordering before and after me) was confused and jumbled a few times before getting straightened out, and getting the correct amount of change took a non-trivial amount of effort (and involved me collecting several dollars of quarters). My candied yams were clearly put into their styrofoam container when they hadn't cooled down yet, which caused its bottom to melt. Rather than tossing out the item, they just threw it in another styrofoam container to hide the mess, causing me to eat melted styrofoam for several minutes before realizing what was going on. Yum! The sides were decent, but not better than I'd expect from a steamer at a buffet.

The dish we got was pretty mild and lacked that strong, interesting flavor unlike any other I had before. Sadly, it is a dish that Mittapheap in Lynn doesn't carry.\\n\\nThe fish was well fried and a nicely sized portion, easily split between my companion and I. The sauce was a little too gummy, the chef was heavy handed with the corn starch. There were no soy beans or other adornments spoken of in the piece.   \\n\\nThe Thai iced tea simply was, brown rice was good (for 3 dollars I should hope so..)  I am not a fan of places that charge for what is generally a necessary companion, esp that much.\\n\\nATMOSPHERE: Neh. It is a \\"very nice\\" place, sorta kinda. You could hear music coming in from the bar, but it wasn't a uniform sound so it was just distorted and distracting. Not distorting and distracting enough to drown out the sound of the man cursing a storm up the table next to us. There are also big old TVs playing sports games at the bar, again with sound getting mixed with the music and mangled by distance transmission over by where we were seated.  It just didn't feel intimate, rather felt cold and lifeless. \\n\\nSERVICE: Decent, The food did take quite some time to come out in spite of the place not having too many people.  The waitress didn't pass by all too frequently to notice if we were done with X or Y or maybe wanted the check.. \\n\\nSUM SENTIMENT:  I do hope this place picks up, I want to like a Cambodian place in Central Square but it is just way expensive for a not so great atmosphere for watered down, over-plated, Cambodian cuisine."},{"name":"Taco Bell","address":"267 Highland Ave","city":"Salem","stars":"2","text":"If you really need fast food, don't go here.

The one couple waiting before us was called and they were seated at a table. Five minutes later we were called and before we were headed into the dining room, I asked If I could sit at the open booth. Amy the hostess responded with \\" No thats reserved. You have to reserve booths\\" Well in the 20 years I've been going there, when ever there was a booth open and you asked for it it was yours. I sat down and with in a minute, the booth was given to a couple who came in the restaurant 5 minutes after I arrived. I asked for the Manager Chris who never agreed the booth should have been given to me at at my request. Apparently, the people who came in after me did request a booth and instead of sitting me in the booth in order of call, they held it until I was seated at a table so the other party  could have the booth. I would have expected a response like \\"Yes the booth should have been yours where you were seated first and the next booth opening should have went to the other guests after you were seated\\".

Perfect, that is, if you don't mind touching elbows with the table next to you.

And they're well aware of it.\\n\\nLets start with check in: That is... Signing up for your power cards etc. At the front desk. I'm a Veteran and they give discounts for veterans -- cool. Upon asking for the discount I was supposed to verify with a military ID. I left the military in 2005... I don't carry that around. So I had to trek a mile to my car and spend 35+ minutes digging for my contract information from YEARS AGO. An hour later, I show up with 30+ pages confirming this to get my $8 discount. Awesome guys. \\n\\nThe front bar was the first visit. I was greeted with the seething eyes of Katrina. With the tone of \\"what do you want\\"? My bad.... Let's start with a large beer and maybe my eyes will force a smile on you. She ran amuck around the bar with the same look of death to other patrons and I laughed at all their similar expressions. I order a 2nd drink the, \\"Corona Rita\\". She gave an exhausting, \\"is that what you want?\\". I said yes, and the check as well... I was going to check the game room bar. \\n\\nGame room: the children frolic about, the adults play patty cake, the games scream Barney in absolute pacifism -- the bartenders, however, each had pets run over in the drive way the morning of apparently. \\n\\nA similar \\"what do you want\\" eventually comes my way. I said, \\"just get me a Bud light tall.\\" She says, \\"that's 6.50..... do you want to go on tab?\\" I said, \\"uhhhh yeah? Sure.\\" She says, \\"I need your card for that.\\"    Okay.... \\"The front bar never asked me for my card to start a tab why is this different?\\". Her: \\"Sir, we need your card to start a tab\\". Okay no problem... The attitude not appreciated and the miscommunication about bar tabs between front and back are frustrating. \\n\\nAgain, the happy hour, food and drinks are nice, but the service is Paramount -- that goes with any establishment, I'm not just nit picking this one.  \\n\\nTry Doc's Food and Spirit  Atlanta.

When we asked if we could order off the regular menu, the waiter told us, \\"the kitchen is not equipped to handle the volume of tables for tonight.\\"  \\n\\n**WHAT???!!!  You can't  make food for the amount of tables you choose to book for in your restaurant??  Nice managing skills.  We actually asked for a manager, considering there was only one other table at the time seated, to see if there was ANYTHING els we could order off the menu.  She said the truffle mac and cheese.  My friend ordered a side of that.  It never came.\\n\\nDrink time:  4 of the 6 of us ordered dirty martinis: one regular, one extra dirty and 2 hot and dirty.  All 4 of them came as regular vodka martinis.  A small detail about me: You mess with my martini and I duct tape you to a tree and stone you.  Sorry, 49 Social, if your waiter never came back to work the next day.  My doing.\\n\\nThe food was actually good...I had a beet salad and some fish entree.  Not worth $45 though.  Veeery small portions.\\n\\nThen, the worst of it...the \\"entertainment\\"...one dude on a Casio keyboard, and one on an elementary electronic drum top singing middle eastern music.  Ugh my bleeding ears...it's time to leave...luckily we have other plans to properly ring in the new year..."},{"name":"Burger 21 - Mall of Millenia","address":"4192 Conroy Rd, Ste 109","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"Love, love, love the food! This is a must stop place if you are in the area for some shopping and need to break for lunch.

We didn't wait any longer for our food then we would in a sit down restaurant.  They have a ton of different sauces to compliment the food.

The items include tandori chicken, saag paneer, all the naan you can fathom (!!! I never see this at most lunch buffets!), a vegetable medly, basmati rice, veggie pakora, samosas, curry chicken, and an array of veggie curries. Sheesh! EVERYTHING was delicious. No joke. I almost ate my self sick. All of the meats were tender and the veggies were cooked to the perfect consistency. \\n\\nService: Okay, first off, when I came in, the woman instructed me to grab as much food as possible because the buffet was closing at 3 pm and it was getting close to the hour. I was the ONLY person in there. They also kept staring at me as I ate which was weird and seemed to be talking about me. Maybe I'm just paranoid, but seriously, it's just kind of rude to treat your only patron that way. Even though I was the only person there, it took forever to get the check. While I was leaving, a couple tried to enter the restaurant and they said they were closed. I mean, I can understand why you would want to stick to business hours and all, but when you have very few customers and tons of food left, I don't see why you would refuse service. \\n\\nAtmosphere: it's not the most beautiful room, but they try. The lighting was very dim when I entered. Since it was -15 F outside, I was kind of hoping for a more cheery, warm interior.\\n\\nSynopsis: I don't know if I'd come back here.

The caramel cake slice we had was decent, dryer than we would like. The other food made up for the lack of a super decent dessert. My guess is just that it sat in the fridge for awhile after being made which dried it out. \\n\\nWe will definitely be back.

The sides are amazing; Most of them are Hispanic-influenced; I chose the rice and beans and fried yuca. Delicious!

Dedicated to the point of making their own chocolate, caramel, and certain baked items in house while incorporating ultra-high butterfat milk and interesting ingredients instead of simply making each flavor a sugar bomb or relying on additives the result of this \\"farm to cone\\" process is probably the creamiest ice cream I've ever tasted and with a density akin to gelato this is ice cream that eats like a meal, particularly the Malek's  signature flavors - a well culled collection matched by interesting seasonal flavors that change by the month.\\n\\nMoving past waxing poetic and onto the flavors I'd be hard pressed to name all of the metal spoons I licked clean at Salt & Straw on either day, though particularly memorable options included Coffee and Bourbon, Pear with Blue Cheese, Strawberry Honey Balsamic with Black Pepper, and Chocolate Mole but when it came time to order three options proved to be la cr√®me de la cr√®me, on my first visit the Sea Salt with Caramel Ribbons and on my second a 2-scoop cup of Almond Brittle with Salted Ganache and Candycap Mushroom with Port.\\n\\nBeginning first with the Sea Salt with Caramel Ribbons a common theme sat Salt & Straw was the complex balance of sweet and salty with expected flavors used in clever manners, in this case the base ice cream actually salty vanilla with the caramel so sumptuous and interwoven that the end result was like two layers twisted into perhaps the best \\"salty caramel\\" ice cream I've ever tasted - a bold assertion given my fondness for Toscanini's, Jeni's, Humphry Slocombe, and Sweet Rose Creamery - but one I'll stand by until all four can be tasted side-by-side, and one only furthered by the quality of my other two selections as each were equally creamy, incredibly balanced, and beguiling in their ability to take savory ingredients and fold them into the rich starter with an end result a flavor entirely unique, the almond brittle almost 'smoky' on the palate and the candycap mushroom distinctly earthy but also leavened tasting; the end result when blended with port something like pancakes with syrup meets poached pears - definitely an eye opener and quite unlike anything I'd experienced before in an ice cream."},{"name":"Dave & Buster's","address":"2215 D And B Dr SE","city":"Marietta","stars":"2.5","text":"If not for the awful food and getting drinks spiled on us while being served, this D&B could get at least 4 stars.\\n\\nWith that said, our server was nice and efficient enough.\\n\\nLots of good games, but the abundance of people wanting to be seen and heard ( yes, you read correctly, there were people trying to floss or whatever the term is nowadays), which is annoying. i assume patrons are far less obnoxious on weekdays."},{"name":"La Casita","address":"101 W Cordova Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"Mediocre food, poor margaritas, and inconsistent service.

They were unsure if they should give them to us or wait for the parties with the reservation.  There was a big hullabaloo, and I started to freak (since i was low blood sugar AND dehydrated).  Then, right at my nervous breaking point, they sat us at small table in the corner.  Whew.\\n\\nShortly after, the place got slammed by the reservation folk and a bunch of walk-ins.  Even though we had been sat first, they took our orders last.  The reservation couple who came in two parties after us seemed to have pre-ordered or something.  They were sat, watered, and fed well before us.  This kind of bummed me out, but then our food ended up coming promptly.  So, I calmed down and focused on enjoying the place.  The lady servers were just so nice, I couldn't stay irritated.\\n\\nNext time, maybe I'll make a reservation.\\n\\nMy suggestions for a two person order... split a sizzling bowl of seafood yumminess - either a muqueca or bobo or capixaba...

The Chicken from the bowl was very tender marinated with just the right amount of garlic and olive oil, on top of rice and grains. I choose the green onion sauce that gave it a good kick with the vegetable slaw and the Boba Balls. The cheeseburger steamed pods were also very delicious which basically is the Chinese steamed buns with ground beef, cheese, ketchup and mustard. It tasted exactly like a Mcdonald cheeseburger, but for me it not such a bad thing neither. \\n\\nThe pods also came with freshly made vegetables chips and the slaw that they put on top of the bowls.

We guessed that the place must have been brand new as the staff sort of seemed like they were in la la land - other than the busser who was super nice and came over when we sat down to make sure our table had been wiped down. We later found out that this place has been there for at least a year - no excuse for the blips in service we experienced.\\n\\nWhat I do want to explain is the situation we experienced when we ordered dessert.

My friend suggested the pecan pie with chocolate ganache, which we ordered from our server and when a runner brought it out, it definitely was not pecan. There were chunks of apple in it with a caramel sauce, no signs of a single nut or chocolate ganache. It was delicious, but not what we ordered. We looked on the menu and there was no apple pie listed. So strange.\\n\\nWhen the waitress came back, we showed her the pie (about 1/2 was left) and explained the problem.  Her response was, \\"oh wow, we haven't had apple pie on our menu since October!\\" She took the pie back to the kitchen and came back empty handed telling us that the chef who made it told her that WAS their pecan pie. We thought we were on a hidden camera show. We asked where the pecans and chocolate ganache were and she said \\"oh, maybe someone accidentally put caramel instead of chocolate sauce on it.\\" That was end of story - no manager came over, no offer to bring something else out instead, and we didn't get to finish half of the pie that was taken from us.\\n\\nThe worst part was, when we got the bill, an $8 PEACH pie was on it. I'm just not even sure what to think about this. We were so confused and had experienced a lot of poor customer service throughout the night, we decided not to even approach getting it off the bill and just left.

I am not a big fan of white meat and I find that most Thai restaurants in Vancouver like to use white meat over dark meat or else I would have ordered chicken. My prawns were over cooked and the best tell is that prawns shrivel up when over cooked. The taste of the pad Thai was mediocre at best but it did not taste anything like the pad Thai I had in Thailand. Tastes quite westernized. I also requested no peanuts but it came with peanuts and reminded server. I think she told me she brushed off the peanuts and brought it back. I had a severe allergic reaction an hour later when I was at the gym. Had to buy allergy pills after. (On a side note, I am a big lover for pad Thai.

The pork spareribs were chewy, bland, and the meat didn't separate easily from the bones.  The sui mai was stale and the wrapper was dry and looked old.  Lotus leaf sticky rice was dry, not moist or sticky, and without much filling.  Rice noodle shrimp roll and har gow were, well, not really bad, just blah.\\n\\nThe problem, I think, is that the above-listed dishes were probably bought elsewhere and reheated for us after being stored at Hai Du for too long.  Notice that the metal steamers baskets arrive cold, while the food in the small dish is hot.  This suggested to me that the dishes had been microwaved and placed in the basket for service.   The dishes that are supposed to be steamed weren't moist or soft as they should have been.\\n\\nWe tried a few dishes that had probably actually been made at Hai Du, and these were not bad.   The scallop dumpling was moist and tasty, the seafood roll was freshly fried and also quite good.   And the congee was fine, it had some thousand-year egg in it which was nice.\\n\\nAs noted by the other reviewers, not many people seem to come to Hai Du for dim sum.

So, service met (high) expectations.\\n\\nFor drinks my mom got the C&L Lemonade, which was super, super great, and I ordered the Rose of Pinot Noir (or something like that). My wine was good on its own but did not pair well with my food. I know that's a \\"duh\\" moment, like who would drink a rose with heavy meats, but I hadn't decided on my food yet. Oops, lesson learned.\\n\\nOn to the food, which was the star of the show. We started with the Waffle Fries. Oh my goodness, I was ready to lick the plate. The chicken liver gravy sounded intimidating, but I really enjoyed the creamy texture and the taste of vinegar. It was very present but didn't feel heavy or cloying, and the waffle fries were not heavy or oily either. The green onions on top were a bit pickled, which added to my love for this dish.\\n\\nFor the main show I ordered the Grilled Lamb Heart and my mom ordered the Beef Brisket. The brisket was super tender, very buttery, and almost melted in your mouth, though I didn't taste much in the way of seasoning. Still, I loved it. The pickles and biscuits were also really yummy, so that was definitely a winner.\\n\\nThe Grilled Lamb Heart was excellent, and I was surprised and disturbed by how much I enjoyed eating the heart of an innocent little lamb. I'm still trying to get past the guilt. The popped grits, peaches, and peanuts were all good, though I didn't like the taste of the peaches with the lamb together, and the peanuts with the lamb didn't jive too much for me. Still, the heart was delectable. \\n\\nWe split the Bibb Lettuce Salad, which was good but not superior IMO. I wouldn't order it again, instead I'd save room for more dessert. The mix of flavors and textures was nice, but the greens felt a wee bit soggy from the dressing.\\n\\nFor dessert we split an order of the doughnuts. The doughnuts were super delish, but that caramel in the cup was ah-mazing. Oh my gosh, I keep thinking about it. We were advised to dip the doughnuts in the caramel, but I really preferred to just eat the caramel on its own. It had a thicker consistency than just a dipping sauce, and the cream and citrus glaze just added to the intensity. Mmmmmm I loved it.\\n\\nOverall I am very much a fan and will be returning soon. One thing I like about C&L as opposed to TRP is that it's easier here to make things budget friendly. The bill came to $80 for our entire meal, but if we had avoided alcohol (which is no fun, I know) and the salad, it would have been down to $50 easy. Choosing between an appetizer or a dessert would bring it down to $40. That's still pricey, but it's more affordable than TRP and you're still getting delicious food.\\n\\nI also enjoyed the twists on Southern cuisine. I didn't walk in expecting traditional Southern fare, so I wouldn't advise anyone else to hold those expectations.

When we asked what would likely be on the charcuterie plate ($19) he said it contained a slice of \\"pate de foie de canard en croute\\" and \\"pate campagne en croute.\\"   Next time hold the French.  It is wrong to assume I speak French (I do) and better to just tell me that the dish contains duck liver pate in a pastry shell and a country pate in a pastry shell.  No reason to use french except to try to either impress me.  Good food impresses me, not French!\\n\\nWIne bottles were expensive, too.  Least expensive that I recall was $26.  Least expensive glass is $11 (actually tasted good).\\n\\nDoes have a lively bar scene.  \\n\\nWhy go here?  Because you want great food and are willing to pay extra for ambiance, chiqueness and a waiter who describes your food in French, in our opinion.   Other options nearby include Metropolis, Aquitaine, and Garden of Eden and they may be more affordable.  They also do not speak to you in French."},{"name":"Flower Child","address":"11721 Rock Rose Ave, Ste 120","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Flower child is such a healthy and delicious quick option in the domain.

From all the reviews i've read, many people raved about the fried cauliflower.  I ordered the Pastrami steak coppa with a side of fried cauliflower and the stuffing!  I absolutely LOVED the stuffing which was topped with pulled pork.  The sides that come with the entr√©e were like full size sides that can be their own entree! For example the stuffing came in a mini cast iron pan and the cauliflower came on its own 8'' plate! My bf ordered the ribs, with a side of mac and cheese and the cole slaw.  He was not fond of his ribs, having lived in the south for two years, the bbq wasn't to his liking.  The only thing I liked that he ordered was the mac and cheese! \\n\\nThe portions were huge and enough to share each entree between two people!

I would call it shabby sheek and despite the decor, the place looks pretty run down and worn. \\n\\nFood:  we ordered the dinner for 2a (chicken chow mein, sweet and sour pork, BBQ pork fried rice, bbq won ton soup and as there was few greens, beef and broccoli.  \\n\\nChicken chow mein - chicken tasted like it was boiled. Absolutely no flavour.  Egg noodles were tasty. You could go to T&T to get the same noodles. Overall, the chicken wrecks the dish. I've tasted better fast food. \\n\\nBBQ pork wonton soup - I would come back just for this dish. Flavourful and beautiful to look at. This is just a great soup.  The wonton are pork with full size shrimp and kick with flavour and are 2 big bites to eat.  My 6 year old gobbled this. \\n\\nSweet and sour pork - the sauce is a dark red, the batter is crispy and thin, the pine apples look they were just dumped from a can and are stone cold.  The pork was tasty but a bit too crisp as if it had been sitting and were twice fried instead of cooked fresh. The dish was luke warm.  Disappointing as the pork batter was perfect. \\n\\nBBQ pork fried rice - flavourful and beautiful to look at.  Tasty with just the right amount of seasoning.  A great dish. My 6 year old gobbled this. \\n\\nBeef and broccoli - hugely disappointing.  They used so much cornstarch to make the beef shiny, the beef turned out gummy and so coated, you couldn't taste the beef well. While the broccoli in the wonton was perfect, the broccoli in this dish was caked in the cornstarch sauce, the sauce cooked the broccoli to soggy.  My 6 year old, who loves beef and broccoli, wouldn't touch it after the first bite. \\n\\nService - good service, they check up on you a lot and offer to pack up your left overs which is at least another 2 meals for 1 adult and child.  Only drawback is while tea is offered, water isn't and empty water glasses aren't offered to be refilled. \\n\\nWashrooms - smell fresh, was clean, lots of broken tiles and peeling paint. \\n\\nFresh seafood - the lobsters, crabs, shrimp and rock cod are alive and kicking so if you want fresh seafood this is definitely the place to come. \\n\\nAtmosphere - the place is packed, loud and bright. \\n\\nPrice - $40 for 5 dishes. \\n\\nOverall - I will definitely be coming back to try the seafood, won ton and BBQ fried rice but I'll pass on the Canadian Classics and try more of the fresh seafood dishes next time."},{"name":"The Manchester Arms","address":"1705 Virginia Ave","city":"College Park","stars":"4","text":"Had the pork chop special.

The hostess then proceeded to hand us the menus (it was restaurant week) and explained that we could get an appetizer or salad, an entree and dessert for $33. Sounded good. We decided to do just that and split the food. We got the eggplant stuffed with cheese, tomatoes and herbs for the appetizer, the chicken with vegetables and a chocolate mousse and told the hostess we would split it.

Each of us got one of their smoothies, and I got to try the mango samba, mango nana, passion blue, and blueberry mix.  Of the 4, I enjoyed the passion blue the most, and the mango smoothies, while good, were a tad too sweet for my taste.\\n\\nWe then ordered some appetizers.  The Brazilian crab cakes were phenomenal, and fell apart right in your mouth giving you a mouthful of delicious crab flavor.  The cod patties were just as good, and came with a unique dipping sauce that I enjoyed.  The coconut shrimp was a delightful alternative to the ones you get at asian restaurants, as it had just enough coconut flavor to allow you to relish the taste of the shrimp itself.  The fried yucca with Portuguese sausage was the most interesting appetizers of the 4, as I never had yucca before.  I would say it was a more stringy sweet potato, but it was awesome nevertheless.  The Portuguese sausage was ridiculously good as well, as I could tell that it was seasoned well.\\n\\nFor our main courses, we all tried their signature dish: the Moqueca Capixaba seafood stew with fish, mussels, and shrimp.  I will first note that the portion sizes are HUGE, as in it could last me for 2 meals huge.  They did not skimp on the seafood portions, and on top of that, they piled on top of it heaps of vegetables.  The dish also came with a side of rice, and they even gave some unique gravy to pour onto the rice!  To say the least, this was the highlight of my night, as the food was astronomically phenomenal.\\n\\nI would definitely recommend this pace to anyone who wants to try a new restaurant, and would definitely come back here again."},{"name":"Rino's Place","address":"258 Saratoga St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"This was my first time at Rino's went with my good friend \\"Marilyn\\" it was fabulous.

This struck me as odd because come on, even on a weekday you'd expect business to be better than that! So I proceeded to order takeout- an udon, spicy tuna and negitoro roll.\\n\\nUdon- alright.. Wasn't too horrid, but I found it much too salty!\\n\\nNegitoro roll- looked weird. I ate a piece anyway and it was DISGUSTING. Clearly the fish was far from fresh, tasted like it had been rotten for a month or something. I've had previous experiences of being served fish that had gone bad at sushi bars, but never has it been so bad as then where I actually felt compelled to spit the whole thing out. Needless to say, I threw out the rest of the roll.\\n\\nSpicy tuna roll- after trying the negitoro roll, there was no way I was willing to try this.\\n\\nI love sushi aLOT.

The waitstaff hovered and took plates before we were finished, always sweeping an arm in and removing something from the table - maybe because the tables were too small to hold more than a salad plate and glass of water.

He let us know that we woud be seated in about a half hour, and we were glad to be there.  The vibe is great; there is a small bar area with a good amount of elbow room, the decorations are subtle and trendy and the restaurant has a nice retro feeling to it.\\n\\nWhile waiting to be seated, we waited at the bar area and proceeded to have some drinks.  The drink menu is creative and there is something for everyone.  I especially liked that there were 6 beers on tap (for a small bar, that's good) and plenty of specialty drinks.  I had a dark and stormy, made with their very own chili infused ginger beer.  It was a decent drink, with a nice price of $6.50.  My boyfriend had a beer, which was also decently priced at $5.50.  And although the drinks were quite nice, I was taken aback by the poor/cold service given by the bartender.  If someone is paying you to get a drink, and even tip you, the least you could do is be nice... ugh. I hate paying for service, even when it's bad.\\n\\nLuckily, our table was ready for us and we were seated right away.  We chatted up a nice couple at the bar, who told us we were in for a real treat with the fried chicken and they also recommended the Devil's Horseback appetizer.  As soon as we were seated, we ordered the Devil's Horseback ($6.50) and 2 Fried Chicken Dinners ($13.95).  The appetizer was absolutely amazing-- 4 dates stuffed with blue cheese and an almond, wrapped with a nice piece of bacon.  The sweetness, sprinkled with salty goodness and savory flavors were superb.  And as soon as we gobbled up our appetizer, our chicken dinners were upon us!\\n\\nThe chicken plates looked stunning, with 4 pieces of golden fried chicken, a generous portion of mashed potatoes, a small biscuit, and a heaping spoonful of collared greens.  The sides were stunning, like a party in your mouth-- deliciously smooth and buttery potatoes, juicy collared greens that tasted fresh, and a deliciously flaky biscuit.  The chicken, however, was subpar.  It was to be the highlight of my night, but unfortunately, it was not what I was expecting-- especially with all those terrific reviews about it.  What part of delicious fried chicken means that you will have DRY chicken?  The chicken was too dry, it was overcooked, and it wouldn't have passed for a meal that I would even cook for my friends.\\n\\nSo, as much as I wanted to adore this joint, I had to give it 2 stars for less than stellar service at the bar, and chicken that was decent at best.  However, the sides and appetizers were just so tasty that it upped my rating to a 3.  This is certainly a decent restaurant with glimmers of delicious flavors, and I hope that I just happened to go on an off night."},{"name":"Pig Floyd's Urban Barbakoa","address":"1326 N Mills Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"The food is amazing.

Our first pick was a little restaurant pub a few doors down from Sweeney's, but it was loud and crowded and none of our party felt like waiting forty or more minutes.  We spilled back out onto the street and someone suggested we walk a few feet down the road to see if Sweeney's had any room for our not so small party.  \\n\\nAs we entered, the atmosphere immediately felt more peaceful and inviting than the place we had just left.  I have always loved this building and used to come here when it was Michael's several years ago.  I immediately fell in love with the atmosphere once again.\\n\\nWe are warmly greeted and seated at a comfy old world table in a back room that is equally as inviting and not mobbed to the gills with the typically loud Marblehead weekender drinking crowd.  In fact, it is quiet and peaceful.  Despite having grown up in this feisty little town, this is the sort of peaceful atmosphere I like to eat my food in.  \\n\\nThe menu is standard casual fare.  At first it's a bit difficult for me to figure anything I can order since it's an obvious meat and seafood lovers menu.  Being vegan is never easy in non-vegan restaurants and Sweeney's is no exception.  \\n\\nI notice they have sweet potato fries, french onion soup, and salads.  I order all three sans the cheese topper on the soup.  Our friendly waitress didn't look at me like I had two heads and served up a french onion soup that was absolutely delicious.  Someone at our table ordered the lobster roll that looked too tempting for comfort.  Nice big chunks that he devoured with great satisfaction.  \\n\\nUpon realizing it was my sons birthday, they brought out the most delicious serving of chocolate mousse topped with real whipped cream, and a birthday candle on top for my boy and we all sang the traditional birthday ditty, waitress included.\\n\\nI will most definitely return here.

Most of the restaurants are of the same \\"minimalist, clean lines, tiny plate\\" variety, and all of them are ridiculously expensive given the quality and service. In particular, the city has historically been disastrous when it comes to Mexican cuisine - surprising, really, as it's pretty difficult to screw up one of the most forgiving of all dishes, the simple burrito...\\n\\nHowever, unless one wishes to elbow one's way past the hipsters of \\"Lolita's\\" (admittedly worth the trouble as the food is generally quite good....) or take chances with the virtually inedible crud splashed onto the plates at \\"Las Margaritas\\", the only choice up until now to get even a passable enchilada has been a trip across the US/Canada border to grab something at a Taco Bell. \\n\\nBut no longer! Let the bells ring, the banners fly -- at last, a decent Mexican joint has opened off Davie street, in an unassuming little window front facing Pacific Drive, called \\"Salsa and Agave\\". Ignoring the utter lack of atmosphere -- an awkward bar placement and chairs apparently designed by some descendent of the Marquis de Sade don't for comfy dining make -- is easy given the fresh guacamole, the well crafted platings and the delicious, seemingly \\"home made\\" specialties, very well seasoned and burgeoning with fresh vegetables. The staff seem to be family - whether they are or not is immaterial, really, as they clearly have an affection for each other and an admirable wish to make one's dining experience memorable. \\n\\nThe night we were there, they handed out complimentary frozen margarita shots which, in a country renowned for its stingy cocktails, was enough to make me a fan right away.

Yes, all the pig one can shove into one's pie-hole. Or should it be rib-hole?\\n\\nSo there are 3 caveats for this offer:\\n\\n1. Drink must be purchased. They have $12 pitchers here, so this is easily taken care of.\\n\\n2. There's a side dish that must be finished at least once. It's mostly mashed potatoes and some vegetables. Honestly this wasn't much of a problem. Vegetables are healthy.\\n\\n3. The ribs only come in one flavour. Not too big of a deal until one is a few racks in. Then they don't taste too good anymore.\\n\\nIn any case, my friends and I demolished several pigs (and some potatos and vegetables) with great prejudice and reckless abandon. Some places start to \\"run out of food\\" when one eats past a certain amount, but this place sure didn't, which is really nice. We definitely got our money's worth. To commemorate the occasion, I built an oh-so-pretty ribs flower. See photos.\\n\\nDefinitely need to come back and eat me some more pigs.

As a small start up in the first two weeks of our business, we appreciate hearing your thoughts and hope we can address your concerns and get you the perfect scoop of ice cream.\\n\\nGiven the fact that most of our ice creams have mix ins, small samples can be difficult to gauge...especially on flavors like sea salt. So I'm really sorry to hear that we missed the mark with you on several. To provide a little background, we use an all natural cream from Lochmead in Eugene. Our recipe includes 17% butterfat, we add very little air when we churn the cream, and it's much less sweet than most - in order to create a nice, creamy base on which the flavors can really shine.\\n\\nI am glad to hear you enjoyed the brownies in your scoop of chocolate. We use fresh baked brownies from Finales in NW Portland and Holy Kakow chocolate in our base. And I truly hope you'll be back to try the Lemon Basil - especially before the basil season is over! We are also about to introduce a few new flavors that I think you'd really enjoy. In fact, we are just now starting to offer ice cream flights - so you can sample several flavors at once. I'd love to meet with you personally to tell you about our ice cream and sample these...if you'll be around sometime during the next week, please let me know (I've included my personal email below).\\n\\nFinally, I really appreciate hearing that the scoops appeared to be different sizes - that's no good! We've been busier than we'd anticipated and your point makes me think that maybe we haven't provided enough practice scooping the perfect size! We'll get some additional training starting first thing tomorrow morning.\\n\\nThanks again for your feedback.\\nBest wishes.\\n-Kim Malek\\nFounder, Salt & Straw"},{"name":"Pied-√†-Terre","address":"3369 Cambie Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Just went here for the for the first time a few weeks ago and it was yummy! \\n\\nI ordered a tomato tart with goat cheese on it and steak fritz for the main.\\n\\nAte every last bit!\\n\\nSmall and expensive but nice, ill go back if im feeling like a special meal :D"},{"name":"Winsor Dim Sum Caf√©","address":"10 Tyler St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"The go-to place for dim sum for my family.

(It was a Thursday night.  He had promised a different restaurant downtown, but didn't feel like driving downtown--I told him he wasn't getting out of his promise to take me out, so he opted for somewhere closer to us).   I didn't care what he picked, as long as it was a restaurant I had never before tried.   So, first time at Mezzo was pretty amazing.  Firstly, I know nothing about wine.  Nothing at all about alcohol, actually-- besides the fact that I like some drinks more than others.  Secondly, I'm cheap--so obviously, I'm going to order the cheapest on the menu (my husband is already doing something nice for me by taking me out--why push the boundaries?)  I know I like white wine, so I see a Riesling called Polka Dot and order it.  My first impression was honey-- a light, slightly sweet honey flavor--and I can never usually pick out differences in wine.  I ordered the Chicken Milanese, unsure if I'd ever before had Chicken Milanese--but now I know I've never had it like this.  It was beyond words.  I'm pretty sure I made an inappropriate sound upon savoring the first creamy bite.  It comes with asiago-stuffed gnocchi and is positively swimming in creaminess.  I managed to save some to take home, and as I boxed up the leftovers, I was glad I did so--I was getting fuller by the minute!   I really wanted to  try dessert, but there was no reason to spend $7 on something we couldn't finish anyway (plus, I'm kinda on a diet--can't you tell?).  My husband got a pork chop (I was annoyed at him for this--who goes to a nice place and gets a pork chop? but he does things like that all of the time--opposites attract, and all that).  He really liked it, and even I saw the value in it--it was thick and cooked perfectly--plus THE SIDES it came with.  How do I begin to express my love for some of the best mac and cheese I've ever had the pleasure of tasting?  Smoked Gouda Mac & Cheese (yes, it was my husband's, and of course, he let me try it).  I will be going back to Mezzo just for this.  Choose something from \\"The Grill\\" portion of the menu, and it comes with cauliflower, plus your choice of a side and sauce!  (Next time I visit, I will definitely try a steak--then order the Milanese to-go? Just kidding!).  Service was a little slow, but nothing terrible.

My southern gentleman said it was the best ribs he'd ever tasted, and he's quite biased on the matter.\\n\\nThe 4 of us chose different entrees: Earth bowl with salmon (super filling dish, and I can see why it's their signature--lots of different proteins, dipping sauces, flavors and seasonal vegetables); halibut with curry, peas and cauliflower (great, deep tastes with a huge hunk of local fish); seared duck breast with cherry glaze and whipped corn pudding (CAN I SCREAM OUT LOUD ABOUT THE CORN PUDDING?!

Creamy and crunchy.  Some may not like the taste, but that is what it was like for me.  The chicken I got extra spicy.  The spice was not hot at all initially, but when I was getting towards the end I could start to feel the heat.  What stood out more than the spiciness was the saltiness of the sauce.  That could be good for those that like a more salty flavor, but not for me.  I was craving water to wash it down.  The chicken on the other hand was cooked well.  Soft outside and tender inside.  I would have preferred to have the option for extra crispy, but in this case it is ok.  The food reminds me of a twist on KFC.  It was a no frills kind of place to get your fried chicken fix.

More often than not, \\"interesting\\" fails as food.  Regardless, there were still a number of unexpected items on the menu.  \\n\\nWe started with oysters.  My partner loves them.  Me, I'm generally ambivalent but these were delicious.  Great flavor and mouth feel.  Very fresh.  I then had the braised lamb shank which literally fell of the bone and was exquisite.  Portions were on the small side compared with many other restaurants, but I think they were definitely reasonable.  We didn't have to run off to Burger King afterwards as we have elsewhere. (there goes any esteem for my palate, eh?)\\n\\nThe one thing that didn't impress me, however, was an extensive use of foams.  Intriguing in concept (but also a little gross, isn't it?) but I didn't feel it added to any of the dishes.  Perhaps it just wasn't done well.  I can't say.\\n\\nBack to the menu.  They have always had interesting cocktails.  Pricey at $12, but worth a try!  They also have an extensive and reasonably priced wine list with glasses priced around $11.\\n\\nThe ambiance is great.  It has a very warm, intimate (though not romantic) feel.  Casual.  Sometimes boisterous such as with the company event that was just ending as we sat down."},{"name":"Pho Zen","address":"15936 SE Happy Valley Town Ctr Dr","city":"Happy Valley","stars":"3.5","text":"The price of the pho/food here is a little pricey compared to other places around town and the taste isn't great compared to others either.

It's also next door to another amazing restaurant, Watershed in the same low-rise brick building.\\n\\nI've eaten at Saltyard many times - this is one of my favorite Atlanta restaurants and local concepts - I also take visiting friends and family here for the consistency and approachability - the food here stops just shy of the ubiquitous and usually obnixious food-as-art them and builds into something new and refreshing. Chef Nick Leahy takes the farm-to-table concept to new heights with conviction and a great understanding - that if you start with amazing ingredients you can end up with amazing food, no matter how complex the recipe or technique used in preparation. Besides sourcing great products, Saltyard \\"goes to 11\\" with brilliant presentation, delicious sauces and a downright special setting. The food is served \\"tapas\\" style with smaller portions on small plates or skillets so you can try a lot during a single sitting.  I don't want to make this an overblown review so I'll stop right there and let the food speak for itself.\\n\\nThe interior has tall ceilings and yet is somehow cozy, probably due to the lighting. Tables in general are smallish but so are the plates so you should still have plenty of room. I often sit in the front area at the high-tables for convenience and a quick bite - larger groups are generally more comfortable in the back. \\n\\nThe photos and food I've posted are a combination of several visits so if there's a bit of inconsistency, it's all my doing. \\n\\nThe menu is divided up into a single front/back panel with three columns each - most of the items are relatively static in nature and easy to obtain, so it makes sense for these to be on a more permanent menu. Play special attention to the vegetables - this is one of the few places in Atlanta where I feel more than comfortable and completely sated by ordering a bevy of veggies and sharing amongst the table. Anything oven-roasted is just plain delicious.\\n\\nThe last thing I want to mention before continuing is regarding the bar itself - including the drink specials and local craft brews. Feel safe my friend that you are in good hands - the concoctions provided by the talented bartenders will get your head spinning and your taste buds a-twirl. Awesome stuff here folks - I usually hit the 3 Taverns or other local brews to start then maybe one of the awesome specialty cocktails or white bourbon mixed drinks.\\n\\n3 Taverns \\"Theophin the Recluse\\" Russian Imperial Stout (and if you like stouts, try the ice-cream if it's on the menu made from the same!)\\n\\n3 Taverns \\"A Night in Brussels\\" white IPA\\n\\nOn with the food.\\n\\nDeviled Farm Eggs with bacon and sriracha - must stop eating these but they are so good. Nice way to start things off...\\n\\nRoasted Cauliflower with thyme, lemon, chili - you can do no harm with this dish.\\n\\nFlash Fried Brussel Sprouts with sweet chili - only brussel sprouts in Atlanta I've found worth eating.\\n\\nBlistered Green Beans with bacon, ginger, cider reduction - delicious - the bacon with a balance of acid makes this dish\\n\\nPappardelle pasta with prosciuitto cream and locally sourced mushrooms - filling and so satisfying\\n\\nGrilled Lamb Loin with tuscan whitebean puree, harissa\\n\\nCrispy Fish Tacos with chef's spicy jalapeno aiolo, cilantro lime slaw\\n\\nI've also had the ahi tuna tartare, pimento cheese and wild musthrooms which were all delicious but un-photographed.\\n\\nAnd for dessert...\\n\\nSorghum Pecan Pie with bourbon ricotta ice cream\\n\\nS'More Bread Pudding with maple and banana ice cream\\n\\nEverything I've tried at Saltyard has been amazing and the service, both at the bar and in the dining room has been amazing.

I tried my burger, and immediately had buyer's remorse. It was two hands full of disappointment. The meat did not seem that fresh, the bun was dry and basically stale, and they put a massive tomato slice on there that was actually thicker than the meat patty.

Fuel Bbq is across the street from an awesome, new coffee house called The Palate, which is how it got our attention.

Maybe they are planning on it in time. I think they are relatively new. \\n\\nThe food- \\n\\nAll they had left was brisket and pulled pork. I did the pork & my husband grabbed the brisket. He got their house Bbq sauce but they had run out, so she told me she was whipping some up. For sides I chose their baked beans, collards, and Mac n cheese for my toddler.  It came with a side of corn bread. \\n\\nThe cornbread was good. Not dry like another reviewer posted. Sweet and moist.  The pork was good- I mean, I never got any sauce but the sauce is the base in their baked beans so I just ate the pork combined with the beans. Even alone, the pork had good flavor.  The collards surprised me though. Mine tasted bland and unseasoned. I had to continue adding salt as I ate. I did like how fresh they looked and the texture was great. Like they are using local & fresh collards. Just wish they had more flavor.  The only dish I didn't \\"get\\" was the mac & cheese. Really, it just seemed like a bowl of elbow macaroni. There was a melted lump of cheese about the size of a quarter in the bowl, but the dish itself didn't taste cheesy.  It appeared dry because there is no sauce, but I can't say it actually was dry. Just really different from normal macaroni and cheese. I don't think I'd order the Mac & cheese again, but the other sides were fine.

Can we get some with our chips?\\" To which he replied, \\"No, it's only available with our Los Tres Amigos, which comes with guacamole and queso.\\" Fair enough. We weren't hungry for all that and expressed our disappointment that we couldn't just get a side of salsa. He said \\"The salsa IS really good, that's why we have to charge extra for it.\\" Um, OK, first impressions here... maybe just bring out a small sample and mention that it's on dishes x, y, and z, or bring a small side and charge for it.

Chips were light and crispy, salsa had a nice smoky flavor to it. We ordered fajitas, carne asada tacos, and portobello tacos. Salsa verde was as proclaimed - delicious. However, the corn tortillas with our tacos were really greasy, so I scooped out the filling and left the tortillas. I mentioned it to the waiter, and he said \\"We lightly fry our tortillas.\\" Yes, obviously, but that doesn't mean they should be an oily mess on my plate!

The broth, although on the salty side, had a great depth of flavor and the tofu was so silky, it was like eating clouds. (Obviously speaking from experience.) The table was well-stocked with condiments so even the pickiest of eaters could flavor their pho to their liking. \\n\\nI'm really hoping that the poor service was due to an off day because Pho Broadway is cheap, delicious and close to my work.

These deviled eggs were fantastic.  Too bad we only got 2, but we scarfed these down faster than we can inhale!  I had the Burrata which is a light and refreshing dish with chopped strawberries, arugula and grilled bread.  The melted cheese was fabulous and the strawberries gave that sweet acidity I love.

Perfect appetizer to share for two.  For my entree, I ordered the Lasagne made with lamb bolognese, San marano tomato sauce and endive salad.  This dish has no pasta, but you won't miss it at all.  It is so tasty, I can eat lasagne without the pasta anytime of the day if it's like this!  Super rich but really light, just awesome!

They tend to speak things like Romanian which means they can't understand the patrons or the menu. I have never once (nor has my boyfriend or his daughter ) ever gotten exactly what we ask for the first time. And the menu isn't that complicated or extended.\\n\\nLately, we have had this surly, rude, blonde character as a waitress. She speaks English, but she just doesn't care. The daughter is 9 and will only eat whole pinto beans and rice. When we asked this creature for this, emphasizing that she would not eat refried beans and rice and that we always order this so the kitchen can do it, this waitress actually heaved a huge sigh. The boyfriend said: \\"You've never heard of whole beans and rice?\\" She said \\"No!\\" In the way that I would say \\"No!\\" If someone asked me if I'd like a burrito with live baby mice inside it.\\n\\nI am a vegetarian and sliced avocado is a standard ingredient to everything. Then why when I ask for it, do I hardly ever get it? Last night I was starving and took a huge bite of my enchilada without, for once, looking inside of it, I ended up with a mouthful of meat. We sent it back for the avocado but on the bill I was charged for the chicken.\\n\\nThe boyfriend abhors raw onion. Every single time he orders, he says \\"Instead of the pico de gallo, can I please just have chopped tomato and cilantro?\\" What does he get? Nothing. And when he asked, there was an annoyed look on the blonde creature's face.\\n\\nWithout asking if we were all set, she slammed the bill down on the table and took off so quickly, we couldn't even say \\"Wait! We want another round!\\" When she came back to retrieve it and we said we wanted more drinks, she acted totally and completely exasperated.\\n\\nNow onto the the drinks. I don't drink margaritas but the boyfriend does. He always gets the 'house margarita' There is apparently no consistency in these at all. There is something wrong with \\"no consistency\\" and \\"house margarita\\" It's what they do. It's their specialty. Shouldn't it always be the same ?! If he gets two of them, the 2nd one is alway way different from the first. Last night when he said his 2nd margarita tasted weird, the blonde creature came to the table after he had gone to the restroom and proceeded to badger me. \\"Where is he? What doesn't he like about it? How are we supposed to fix it if we don't know what's wrong with it?\\" Then she stuck her nose in it and said it smelled fine to her and slammed it down on the table. How about \\"We're so sorry you don't like it! We'll get you a new one on the house!\\" She did go and pretend to make one herself but we just assumed she did this for a laugh to see if he thought it was different. \\n\\nAs for the bottled beer, which is what I drink. Not once was I asked if I wanted another. And when the 2nd margarita was delivered and I said I wanted another beer, the blonde creature heaved a huge sigh before she walked the 5 feet or so to the bar to get it for me. She also tried grabbing the bottle away when there were at least two sips left and gave me a shocked and angry look when I grabbed it back and said I wasn't done.\\n\\nEarlier, there was a band. Why do restaurants the size of studio apartments think bands with trumpets are a good idea?! Or any bands at all? There was no way any conversing could take place. The man at the table next to mine and I had our ears covered to avoid permanent damage. In fact, the live music almost drove us away but we caved because we were starving. I have rarely been so relieved in my life as when they packed up and went home.\\n\\nThen 11:00 rolled around. We were finishing our drinks and observing the antics at the table across from us, where apparently the entire population of The Island of Misfit Toys had decided to go out for Mexican. Suddenly the creature started picking up chairs and slamming them upside down on the tables. Wow! Talk about feeling welcome! The other side of the room with the bar was still full of people so I don't know what that was all about. \\n\\nSo we are made to feel like the most annoying, exasperating customers ever and then urged to get the hell out. \\n\\nAlso, there was smeared and dried diarrhea in one of the women's room stalls.

I spoke to 4 different staff members, 2 of whom took down my information, over 13 hours asking for an air mattress. I never got one. I ended up having to go to a Walmart at 1 a.m. to buy one myself. What's even more upsetting is that I never received a follow up call to make sure we received the air mattress or to offer a transfer to another unit. When checking out, all the lady at the front desk did was apologize. She never offered to call a manager or give some sort of credit."},{"name":"Nino's Italian Restaurant","address":"1931 Cheshire Bridge Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Wine list is good but expensive.

They were large snow-white fresh mushroom caps stuffed with Italian cheeses and spiced meats. It was a delight to eat and I really liked them. I would recommend this as a 1st course at dinner.\\n\\n\\nFor dinner I had the Veal Parmigiana or as they call it - Vitello Parmigiana. It was a sauteed, breaded veal topped with mozzarella, marinara sauce and grated Parmesan. Plus it came with a side of pasta and marinara sauce. It was very, very good and loved the dish. The sauces, meat and herbs blended in very nicely on this one. The veal was very tender and a joy to ingest. You must try this one when you visit Nino's.\\n\\n\\nThe interior of the restaurant was clean and the service was very good.

My only gripe is it's really good fresh, not as great if it's been sitting around. You can usually tell by the color of the broccoli. Bright green = fresh, dull, darker green = sitting around the steam table.

Check my reviews, I've been a little bit of everywhere and truly love finding places that are original and push the boundaries of food. Swift's is the best representation of this in Austin.\\n\\nI'm not going to review each dish as the menu changes constantly. However, the chocolate and cheese is an eye opening dish to start with, pushing your expectations of what foods really work together. The edamame and pop rocks is interesting and a menu staple. If you like edamame, it's a fun dish.\\n\\nThis past night, we enjoyed some of their new ice ball cocktails. They put some of the drink mixer in an ice ball that melts into the liquor base poured over the sphere. It's a really interesting idea that can result in a second drink when they pour more liquor over the ball if you don't drink it all initially. My only complaint would be the cocktail my friend ordered, I think it was the Stage Name. The flavors were just too medicinal, making it difficult to drink. However, I had the Strawberry one and it was amazing.\\n\\nWe ate primarily from the vegetable menu, but the pigtail tacos were so good I wish I had the whole plate to myself and the gnocchi dish we had was the most amazing thing I ate all night. It was like a mexican meal in a bite, despite being gnocchi and not looking like that. And this gets at the heart of why I love Swift's. They aren't afraid to put something out there  on the plate that changes the way you think of food. \\n\\nDessert is all good. Do the Popcorn and a Movie if you haven't eaten here before and it sounds good to you.

Amuse: Australian yellowtail cured with Asian flavors ginger, and sake on house made lavash \\n2. Arugula vichyssoise: arugula is usually too peppery for me, but they made it super smooth with the potato, and the buttermilk helped to cut the spice. The potato chips added nice texture \\n3. Beef tartare: the herbs and flowers made it lighter. The highlight for me was actually the crostini, which had a light thyme flavor\\n4. Halibut: super tender (poached in olive oil). The light lemon underneath and the smokiness of the grilled asparagus (with all the rough parts shaven off) was really good. The champagne beurre blanc added richness, but I thought just the fish with the lemon and asparagus was satisfying enough. I still can't stop thinking about that asparagus\\n5. Salad: lightly dressed, with tons of stuff going on. There was prosciuitto, shaved ancient heritage Hannah cheese, radishes, shaved carrots, etc. This was way more satisfying than the standard green salad that comes at the end of a French meal \\n6. Wood sorrel sorbet: it's pretty amazing that there was no citrus in this and that it was just the pure flavor of the wood sorrel. I've never had it own its own, and I really liked it - it's tart and refreshing \\n7. Cheese: Camembert - I love how we could smell it once they lifted the cover off the tray where they were storing the cheese. The sweet puff pastry cracker was a nice compliment \\n8. Black sesame pavlova: this was a bit sweet for me, but I loved the ch√®vre sorbet and strawberries  \\n9. Foie gras bon bon: their signature way to end the meal.

One time, we bought a previously frozen whole snapper that looked good, but smelled awful.  Like CSI awful.  Then when we tried to take it back, the manager disputed that it wasn't fresh.  Luckily, we brought the evidence.  Another time, we bought \\"Copper River Salmon - First of the season!\\" at the bargain-basement price of $36.99 a pound.

You know, the kind where you don't know what the heck your are eating, but the food is so friggin' good that you're willing to throw a bit of caution to the wind (so long as the dogs and pigeons that congregate nearby don't look unnaturally skittish).\\n\\nThe absolute #1 must-try dish here is the Tiger Tears salad.  I won't do it any justice by trying to explain it, but it is kind of a crispy fried spicy beef salad that is chock full of fresh vegatables, herbs, and spices.  It had me rolling my eyes back in delight with each savory bite.  The Spicy Chili Pork (seasoned ground pork with white rice) was also very tasty.  Another hit is the Squid Salad, but be warned that it is super spicy.  It's MUCH more so than the \\"Spicy\\" Chili Pork, which I thought just had medium heat.\\n\\nThe only thing holding me back from giving Floating Rock a 5-star review is the cleanliness of the place.

Scott's personable manner and inscrutible instincts about customer service won me over quickly. I have certainly visited enough carts/shops with time to spare before their respective posted closing times, only to have the owners/employees say \\"Too bad, so sad, uhhh buh-bye now!\\" FYI: I was not visiting the Eclectic Eatery at such a precarious time (near closing), however while chatting with him, the subject did somehow manage to come up...\\n\\n\\nHe's in the middle of revamping the menu, with the biggest changes that I could detect being that he's pulling the jerk chicken (jerkin' the ol' gherkin' off the menu....errrr *kaff kaff* sorry.. if only that crazy pullet wasn't such a jerk though!), and what's more, he has switched from spare-ribs to baby-backs. I'm a bit non-plussed by these changes, as I have no clearcut personal preference between baby-backs or spare ribs. I can only lament, being that for the time being, at least, this Cartlandia foodcart pod is lopsidedly stacked w/bbq-themed stands. In the short run it is not to be doubted that so much different 'q at your disposal in one quick stop can only be considered a thing of surfeited beauty. History and common sense, however, chime in w/their unwelcome presence, to remind us that such imbalance cannot last.\\n\\n\\nWhy only 4 stars, you may be idly wondering, if you're not too focused at the moment on any one of 99 of your more serious problems. One reason is the sauce: it is definitely on the sweeeeeeeeet end of the [sweet ---- heat] continuum. His hot version of the sauce was smothered mercilessly by all the sugars and corn syrups and molasses and possibly even honey comprising his complex ingredient profiles.\\n\\n\\nThe other reason for the star reduction is a bit more esoteric---- the use of the word \\"Eclectic\\" has become, since at least the early 1990s, such an ubiquitous term people use to describe themselves in our culture---especially as regards their musical predilictions--- that it has been blanched of most if not all its original merit and poignancy. All that remains of the erstwhile charm and innovation surrounding the concept of \\"eclectic'  is now a residual cloy. When people in spontaneous conversation persist these days in using the term eclectic, I honestly wonder if they have just emerged, Rip Van Winkle-like from a 100+ year slumber, and don't yet realize how poorly this word has aged.... I wonder about how well calibrated the person is bereft of fundamental social or perhaps even intellectual apparati. How frustrating to meet someone and hit if off so well, only to be stymied not only by their use of a painful cliche, but to be completely unaware of their oopsie.\\n\\nWith or w/o the descriptors that have jumpedt the shark, Eclectic Eatery is a solid choice in a strong foodcart pod!

I stopped by a free poetry slam event on Friday evening, something I've regretfully never been to, and I thoroughly enjoyed it, more than I expected to.

This is the Italian place you've been looking for. The only thing I dont like about it, is that I live in Miami, and this place is in Atlanta. \\n\\nI visited Atlanta for my birthday weekend and ended up here on the recommendation of a friend who lives in the city. It's an adorable place, looks like it used to be an old single family home converted into a restaurant. Wood Floors, tables close together, framed family images on the walls. The outdoor patio is probably beautiful in the spring and summer, wrapped around the building and old tree that comes up the center. \\n\\nWe had 8pm reservations, but the place was PACKED, and we had to wait for a table. I hadn't seen these friends in years, so the waiting didnt bother us as we were chit chatting throughout the time. I can see how it could be an issue to sit at 8:45 with an 8pm reservation, but the staff was super attentive, even brought out complimentary glasses of their house Pinot to make up for the wait. \\n\\nOnce seated, we understood why the other table didn't want to leave. It was so homey, and it smelled divine. We ordered another round of cocktails, and decided on the calamari and asparagus as an app. The calamari was ok, nothing to write home about, a bit of a small portion in my opinion. The asparagus, though, WOW. They were HUGE, grilled, chilled and wrapped in prosciutto and layed over this lemony aioli type sauce. I could have eaten them all myself. \\n\\nSalads we tried the gorgonzola spinach, caprese and caesar salad. The gorgonzola one was outstanding, very unique plating with just enough of each ingredient to keep it balanced. The caprese had these unbelievably red tomatoes with nice portions of the fresh mozzarella. The caesar was typical, but with the biggest garlic croutons ever. \\n\\nFor entrees, we had the chicken cannelloni (2 people ordered this), the tortellini with chicken, and the sun dried tomato gnocchi. It's important to note, that the menu changes with ingredients, seasons, etc. So these may not be available when you go. Chicken Cannelloni was delicious, half the cannelloni had white sauce, half had red sauce. Unique way of serving it and the flavors played nicely on each other. The Tortellini had a good amount of sauce, and you could tell the pasta was made in house because they werent all perfect, and you could taste the cheese inside. I also liked that the chicken was grilled and not just white diced chicken. The sun dried tomato gnocchi was PERFECT. Consistency was right on, just enough sun dried tomatoe to give the flavor and the twang but not overwhelming and the walnuts made it perfect. I wish it had a BIT more sauce, but it wasn't a buzz kill. \\n\\nLastly, dessert (yes, it was my birthday dinner, we went all out!) we ordered a creme brulee, two cheesecakes and a cannoli. I didnt try the creme brulee, but the cannolli was good, and the cheesecake was perfection. chocolate cheesecake with regular cheesecake layered on top. I ate that faster than I should have haha. \\n\\nService was spot on as well. Water glasses never empty, napkin folded on my chair when I returned from the rest room. Our server was blonde with the most amazing accent, but I unfortunately do not remember her name. She was great, made good recommendations (asparagus, cheesecake and gnocchi were all her!) \\n\\noverall, I wish this place was in Miami. It felt like we were having dinner at someone's house. Th server mentioned the chef had been with the restaurant for over 20 years, and it definitely showed. the food was SOLID.

It is a taste of Louisiana here in downtown Austin.  It's a little out of downtown, so you avoid the lunch crush which disqualifies so many eateries.  They show LSU and New Orleans Saints games -- that's worth something, right?  But the food just isn't quite good enough.  \\n\\nTake for instance, the catfish platter.  Should be brimming with lightly fried planks of catfish filet on top of a mess of french fries.  Couple of hushpuppies on the side and a paper rammekin of homemade tartar sauce, yes?  You might order the 4 piece platter and think that would be enough -- it is on the menu, right?  And wouldn't you be sad when it showed up with four little catfish nuggets on a big leaf of lettuce?  And you had just agreed to pay 7 or 8 bucks?\\n\\nIn short, everything is a little less than it should be for the prices they charge.  Maybe it's the curse of seafood in Austin.  Maybe it's the premium placed on a 'downtown' location.

But if you're craving dim sum, and don't feel like sitting in a basement watching the food roll by, Windsor might be the place for you.

I decided to open it up to see exactly what I was eating. First of all, the chicken is burnt black, and then I found A PIECE OF PLASTIC inside the wrap.\\n\\nAt this point I'm not even mad.... Things happen... But I decided I needed to call them and let them know that the meat was inedible (literally can't even poke a fork into it), and that I found plastic in it. I'm guessing it was from the packaging of the lettuce they use.\\n\\nThe girl who took my money in the restaurant also picked up the phone. Explained to her what happened and I asked if I could get a new wrap or my money back. She told me that it was my own fault for now checking the wrap before I left the restaurant... Excuse me?

The martinis are too syrupy for my taste, and at $10 a pop, that just won't fly. So I don't tend to drink much when I go to Tonic, but I do like to hit that dance floor.

We had a blast for hours, and even took advantage of the poles! I'll just leave it at that.\\n\\nOverall, I find the atmosphere fun but a bit impersonal.

Anyone who's ever even visited NY, anywhere in the entire state, would know this.  Yes, it's foldable, to a point, but that is where the similarities end.  Don't get me wrong, this pizza is epic, but the crust is very, very different from a NY pizzeria.  Eastside Pies crust is very, very thin, almost cracker like.  I've never had anything like it.  I actually prefer it to NY pizza which I grew up on, which can be too much dough sometimes.  \\n\\nI'm hooked on the Moon dingo pizza as well as the Flightpath.  The delivery is always fast and accurate.  I don't know what more to say other than this is my favorite pizza in Austin.  Price is a little steep, but quality is high.  If you are looking for true NY pizzeria style, then I would say that Brooklyn Pie Co is about the closest to that that I've had so far, at least in North Central."},{"name":"Cuon - Vietnamese Street Food","address":"600 SW 4th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"If you've ever asked for a recommendation for a lunch spot while at the downtown Nordstrom cosmetics department you will surely hear Fresh Roll as one of the top 3 places to eat.

Unfortunately, the food - which isn't bad - is entirely mediocre and riddled with the hallmarks of amateur (or seriously lazy) cooking.\\n\\nNealy every dish contains large roughly-diced and undercooked vegetables from the turnip to the eggplant. Even the cucumbers in the raita were oversized, rock hard, and unpeeled. \\n\\n(Oh, and if you're on a hemlock-restricted diet, you've come to the wrong restaurant. Every last vegetarian dish contains tomato, potato, eggplant, or bell pepper. Including the chutneys.)\\n\\nThe meats suffered from similar problems. The chicken dishes were entirely forgettable. I will say this, however, they served some of the best goat I've ever had.

I ordered 2 pieces of chicken with spicy flavor and Mac n cheese. I think it ended up being like $11. Onto the food, the chicken was enormous so I felt better about the price. The Nashville sauce wasn't really my favorite. I did like it but I think next time I'd try just regular fried chicken. The chicken itself was very moist and the outside was crunchy. It did feel slightly like it was missing that seasoning or something to top it off. I wonder if the Nashville sauce was hiding that because the chicken itself seemed a little bland and lacked that explosion of flavor I was hoping for. The Mac n cheese was delicious but for $3 I'd like to see the cup filled up to the top and not 1/2 full. Overall, no surprise here for me. Classic hipster place like Krog St that is a little higher quality than fast food but makes you order with a la carte menu and very slow service.

You have your LA Chicken, Church's Kitchen, Korean Fried Chicken, and then if you're desperate and your stomach can handle it... KFC. You can also get Chicken and Waffles at any good brunch place like Yolks, Scandelicious, or Jam Cafe. With so many places to get fried chicken, why go here? Because it's not Nashville Hot Chicken. It's almost like judging a smoke salmon and a pan seared salmon, you can't. It's unfair because they're prepared very differently. \\n\\nNashville hot chicken is essentially marinated chicken in seasoning and spices and then floured for frying. Yes, marinated for about a day or so. This enhances the flavours of the chicken so it's more than just the skin.\\n\\nTo get the authentic experience you'll actually want to get the sandwich because Nashville hot chicken is traditionally served with bread, sauce, and pickles. \\n\\nThis is completely different offering than any of the places people have mentioned in the reviews or I've mentioned above.  \\n\\nNow here is my experience:\\n\\nLocation: Located on Commercial near Venables Street it's pretty far away for a skytrain ride, but the bus does go by it. It's a great location for people who live around Vancouver. Because of the patio, it actually looks bigger than it actually is. The place is clean, and had no issues with any of the facilities. \\n\\nExperience: A lot of people are complaining about the line ups and running out of chicken. Growing pains suck, however I was pretty quickly served around lunch time. I was there by 11:45 and I was out at Noon. The till is literally right at the door, so if there is two people in the line up, the line up then goes out the door. So keep that in mind when you hear people say \\"The lineup is out the door\\" it's because if there are more than 2 people, they're out the door.  \\n\\nPricing: My meal cost fifteen bucks (Hot Chicken Sandwich + Macaroni Salad). My brother was 25 (Pop, Hot Chicken Sandwhich, Macaroni Salad, and Fries). It can be a bit expensive with a whole chicken costing $32 bucks. The only reference I have for a whole chicken pricing is actually nando's at $18.75. I felt like my meal is worth it, but if you want a lot of fried chicken for your buck... KFC may be better (But worst in quality... like a lot worst)\\n\\nFOOD REVIEW ACTUALLY STARTS HERE:\\n\\nMacaroni Salad: Good, the noodles and cheese were really good. It was oil based dressing vs mayo based dressing in other restaurants. My only gripe was it was warm, traditionally I have Macaroni salad cold. Would eat again.\\n\\nFries: Great. They're dusted with their medium spice and topped with their dressing. I was super mad I didn't order a full order for myself.\\n\\nHot Sandwich: It was great, thick breast and slathered in  sauce and slaw. Again Nashville chicken is amazing. \\n\\nMy only gripe is their \\"Sweet Tea\\" is actually just Nestea. I thought it would be American Home Made SweetTea. \\n\\n4/5 Overall, there are some kinks to the place that people have mentioned (Line up, inconsistent close/open times) but people are over blowing it because the food is amazing."},{"name":"Truluck's","address":"10225 Research Blvd, Ste 4000","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Definitivamente no fue lo que esperaba, a mi gusto le faltaba sabor a los platillos y aparte no estaba lo suficientemente caliente mi platillo...

Honestly, I hardly ever eat beef, but when I hit PDX soil that's like 65% of my diet.  Your local cows are up there with Argentinean beef - f-n tasty.

Upon making the reservation, the gentleman had mentioned to me that for a 5:30pm time slot, that I must leave at 7:30. I agreed and understood this on the phone. At 7pm however, he was coyly rushing us out because his other party had arrived. I have never witnessed this type of behaviour from an owner, manager or host before.

I just want to say I am a server and do understand to some point because we did show up at 8:30pm when they close at 10pm. \\n\\nSunday is their slowest night, which is why we decided to go, because all these yelpers said that it gets super busy on friday and saturday and you might get ignored by your server. \\n\\nAs soon as we sat down again at 8:30pm, our server goes \\"My name is Vanessa, and I'm not trying to rush you, but our kitchen closes at 9\\" not bothering to tell us it was half-price sushi sunday, and only after she said this did she ask if we had ever been here before. Needless to say we felt rushed right away. Again I'm a server and understand what it is like to have a table come in so late, but she should have asked us if we had ever eaten there before, made her recommendations, and said something like \\"I do just want to make you aware that our kitchen stops service at 9\\" that would have been all it took, and we wouldn't have felt rushed. \\n\\nWe each had a glass of the house pinot noir which was delicious, for it being house(we didn't even feel like we had time to look at the menu, just asked for the house PN), and started with a salad. I had the caesar salad which was very good, and my boyfriend had the greek salad, which he hated because he didn't realize it was a cucumber salad and not an actual salad with lettuce. I tried it and thought it was pretty standard greek salad, nothing too special, but not terrible...\\n\\nFor entrees I had the Jack Daniels marinated BBQ salmon, and my boyfriend had the seared scallop and shrimp plate. We both got risotto and broccoli. The food was delicious, the salmon was cooked to perfection and the scalops and shrimp were both rock your mouth awesome. Of course, our server ruined it by coming by and asking if there was a dessert we wanted to pick out (in the middle of our entree course) that she could put aside for us. We declined dessert, and were pretty put off because again we felt very rushed to leave. \\n\\nWe ended up having another glass of wine, and a baileys and coffee because we noticed our server still had 2 other tables. We had a coupon which ended up taking $70 off of our meal, so we paid a really great price. Which is why we still tipped the server $30 (20% of our original meal price) even though we were both angry that she rushed us, and made us feel very unwelcome. I must say that she was attentive enough, got our orders right the first time, and never left a dirty plate on the table, or our glasses of water empty. But if I had had to pay $140 (our original price) for the 3 course meal with coffee that took us less than an hour to blow through because we were being so rushed, I would have been really pissed.... so my thoghts are don't go there unless you are getting a deal through savvy shopper, scoutmob, groupon, or living social, because you will feel like you have paid too much,"},{"name":"Cuon - Vietnamese Street Food","address":"600 SW 4th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"It's simple, friendly, clean and great!

I knew they specialized in beer, but silly me for reading that \\"Full Bar\\" printed on the menu.  My boyfriend noticed a few minutes later that there was indeed a bottle of Vya vermouth (mmm!) at the bar, so either the waitress got it wrong or the bartender didn't feel up to making my request.  In any event, disappointing, because I gravitate toward places that will make me a good Manhattan.\\n\\nBoyfriend got a half artisanal sandwich--the roast beef one--which he said was good but overpriced for half a sandwich.  I got the salami and beer cheese baguette, which I think was priced just right.  It was a good flavor combination though the baguette was a little hard, rather than crusty on the outside.  We each ordered a little side (potato salad for me, cabbage for him) and they did not come out with our sandwiches.  A second waitress said she would bring them and never did, and finally our original waitress brought them about 10 minutes later.  The potato salad was very yummy (lots of dill!)  The cabbage was good too--sweet and a little fruity, which I hadn't expected, but it was a welcome surprise.\\n\\nThey had a nice selection of beer and the waitress offered to bring us samples of anything we wanted to try before ordering, which was a great idea.  We didn't take her up on it because we were on a schedule, but it's a nice option.  We each got a beer and those were brought promptly and well-priced.\\n\\nOverall a cool little place.  I might go back when I'm definitely in the mood for beer.  Unfortunately, two stars because I was hoping for somewhere boyfriend could get a good beer and I could snag a cocktail with dinner.

I understand it's probably a little annoying when the customer want something that isn't exactly on the menu, and you want them to like your food and the combos you've put together, but we were willing to pay extra, and the ingredients were all laid out there pre-made, they just threw them in a burrito wrap and heated it up.

Once you come in you see that this place is running two businesses... the pho.. and the Jazen Tea... I'm only here for the noodles, and we sat right away. There isn't much tables in this place, but there is a lot of room, like a lot... each table has the standard Sriracha bottle with chopsticks, napkins, and soup spoons.. and once the menu was given to us, we ordered.\\n\\nMy friend ordered a bowl of chicken pho, I was not too hungry but didn't want to just stare at him eating so I ordered a small bowl of rare beef pho. The bowls came pretty quick, and before destroying my bowl with the magically red sauce I drank some of the broth... it was clean, not as deep and complex as your small specialty over the fire overnight broth... but it will do. This place is really an order, eat, get the heck out joint. The standard clean raw bean sprouts came right before the pho... with a few lime wedges and peppers. The food was alright, nothing to really write home about. \\n\\nIf you want convenience, you are in the hood, you do not want to go any farther, well just know this one is here. There is parking in the plaza lot... but it is usually taken up, just know on 49th, there is parking, a little walk.. but think of it as walking off your food when you are done. They take all the plastic here, and they even have kids size servings."},{"name":"Salt & Straw","address":"2035 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Kudos for creativity.

I am bored, bored, bored with the salads and sandwiches that comprise the usual lunch fare downtown.  Swift's Attic stood out as the best candidate for something different for lunch.  Right off the bat, the menu glimmered with possibilities.... In fact, we had to cross examine the waiter to determine if the obscure menu descriptions were \\"real\\" or more of the same.  To start, the waiter was very enthusiastic, full of answers, and vivid descriptions.  We ordered the Market Pickles which were local veggies that had been pickled.  As an appetizer, the veggies burst with flavor.  The grilled edamame couldn't compare even though they were served with chili oil and pop rocks.  For an entree, I had the Trout ala plancha which was a grilled trout served in a tomato broth with a tapenade on top.  Every bite fulfilled my need for something different.  My lunch companion also loved her apple/argula salad topped with the grilled trout.  My entree cost no more than my usual lunch time salad but it was so much more interesting.  I will go back for the food, especially at lunch.  The decor was clever but that is never enough for me.

My daughter's kids tacos had almost no cheese. What they did have plenty of was grease. It dripped out of the tacos and pooled all over the plate. I got the mexi-Cobb salad. It was described as having green chilis. I was expecting, well, chilis. What I got was bell peppers. Which I guess is technically accurate, but not what I would imagine most people think of when they think green chilis. Finally, my husband got the creamy Jalape√±o sauce with his chimichanga and I got the cilantro vinaigrette with my salad. They just tasted like ranch and Italian dressings.

But, I really feel the need to put in my two cents today regarding Clutch. There have been some really harsh, might I even dare to say downright mean spirited reviews for this business. I agree with some of the other reviewers that the price point may be a little high, but these are not factory made, low quality sausages. I have been in on many occasions, starting with opening day. They do still have some kinks to work out as a new business....some they have addressed...I have noticed that they have now implemented a \\"chip & fountain drink\\" deal for $1.50 added to any meal. That is a nice change. They also have the \\"cheap date\\" Hot Dog, which is priced at $3.50 and is great for kids or those with smaller appetites. There are new sides, like French Fries tossed with Kale and sweet & Spicy sauce which are yummy and creative. I personally, have enjoyed the BBQ Pork, Pizza, Thai Chicken, Bacon Cheeseburger. All really good. The decor is stark with a modern, picnic feel. It feels clean, which is good. The service does tend to be slow for some reason though. That can be a problem when on a lunch break. Recently, I waited 19 minutes for my Sausage & Fries, There was a family of 6 ahead of me and a couple. I watched as food was being prepared and brought out basically 1-2 sausages at a time and delivered to the table with the family. It seemed odd to me. The whole process was pretty lengthy. I am not in the food service business, so I don't have a smart solution....but I bet there is one. I hope that the people at Clutch are reading what customers have to say and will be able to tweak a few issues and become a success. I also hope that they have a thick skin, as it is hard for me to read through some of the reviews without cringing."},{"name":"Swift's Attic","address":"315 Congress Ave, Ste 200","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Came here for lunch and enjoyed it for the most part.

We were also warned halfway through our game that we'd be moved shortly for a league that was coming in.

But there was absolutely nothing good about my first experience.\\n\\nAfter reading over the menu I decided to try the chicken sandwich. The less than friendly woman behind the counter quickly told me that they were out of chicken sandwiches. Really? The restaurant serves 3 entrees: chicken sandwich, chicken biscuit and fried chicken. And they're out of chicken sandwiches? Shut down or send someone to Kroger for whatever you're out of! How pathetic for a new restaurant.\\n\\nI settled on the Chicken Biscuit and a side of Mac and Cheese. The decor incorporates bags of White Lily flour so I had high hopes about the biscuits coming of their kitchen. But. The biscuits were disgusting. The flour hadn't been sifted properly when they were made and the result left a less than desirable biscuit. Also... they were several, several hours (maybe a day or two) old. Don't get me wrong. I love old biscuits. Especially to make dressing or stuffing. But for a chicken biscuit? No.\\n\\nThe chicken inside the biscuit was cold and I couldn't taste any seasoning. Pepper and salt would do wonders. Are they using any of the hot sauce they've got in their window display in the chicken batter? It could use some. \\n\\nNow let's discuss the worst part of the meal. The Mac and Cheese. Kraft out of a box would've been better than this! If it wasn't two or three days old I will eat my hat. The Mac and Cheese had been sitting in the wax covered paper bowl it was served in for so long that the oil from the Mac and Cheese was seeing through the sides of the bowl. That doesn't happen in 30 minutes or even an hour. That Mac and Cheese had been sitting for a long time and it sure had a taste to match. It was absolutely gross. \\n\\nOh, and the sweet tea? Dear little baby Jesus. There was enough sugar in that tea to cause instant diabetes. The tea was so sugary it was thick. \\n\\nThis is a simple concept. It's fried chicken. It shouldn't be hard to execute. But the grumpy employees here have managed to make comfort food as gross as possible. \\n\\nUpdate: I brought a friend to the PCM and she picked Hop's for lunch. I was weary but didn't say anything as she apparently really liked it. My experience this time was better than last time. The chicken was fresh, hot and well cooked. But once again the sides were incredibly disappointing. And the price is still incredibly high when compared to the prices at neighboring restaurants.

The prices are reasonable (around $12 for entrees) and it will not break the bank if you order many dishes to share with friends. \\n\\nI came during lunch and had the lunch special. There are about 6-7 choices for the lunch (it comes with fried wantons and salad - so not Thai food at all) for $9.25 which is a good price. \\n\\nI usually have the homely basil chili chicken to gauge how good the food is as it is a simple dish and is available everywhere in Thailand. The best I had was by a roadside stall in a small alley in Bangkok. If they can make it well, then the rest of the dishes should be equally good. \\n\\nThe basil chicken here was good though the spice level had been toned down to suit the local palates. Likewise for the tom yum goong (shrimp) soup. That had the sourness and a bit of spice heat but it was definitely not fiery hot which would leave you wanting for more (and for water too). If you want to up the spice level, you could ask them for the chili flakes and cut chili padi (birds eye chili) in fish sauce like what you get in Thailand. I was talking to the staff and she mentioned they could not replicate the exact same taste as the type of basil here was different from Thailand. That was understandable. With the ingredients constraints, I would say they have done an excellent job in bringing through an authentic and typical Thai dishes here. \\n\\nThe Thai iced milk tea is another winner. It tastes exactly like those you get in Thailand. Sweet and milky. \\n\\nI would definitely be back again and again, or whenever I crave for some good Thai food. I hope they will be here for a while.

The organic margarita (tequila, lime juice, and agave) is simple and clean. It  tastes like what I would imagine the blood of Jesus tastes like if it were alcoholic--perfect. Not cloyingly sweet like some margaritas (especially those that use grody fabrody mixes), I honestly love it.\\n\\nThey have another margarita with rosemary in it that is spectacular, but sadly, I can't recall the name. \\n\\nThey also have amazing salas, chunky, flawless guacamole, and fresh, crispy tortillas. The grilled corn is phenomenal. They offer a vegan taco which is tasty and features black beans, rice, radish, avocado, & ecuadorian salsa. While I deeply appreciate the inclusion (and always order these tacos), this item has been given nowhere near the same attention as the other meaty options, which is unfortunate.\\n\\nThis place offers some of the most interesting and innovative meats and cheeses around.

I have tried several but typically end up with either the Cheesy Burger or Black & Bleu.  The burgers are always flavorful, well cooked and well seasoned.  The fries were alright, but I usually just get a burger.  Also, I have pretty much zero interest in anything other than beef when I hit a burger joint, so I can't comment on the seafood or chicken burgers.  \\n\\nThe service here has also been consistently good.  The staff is very friendly and attentive.  I must also note that I typically avoid lunch crowds and have never been here on the weekend.    \\n\\nOverall, I really don't have any complaints with this place.

The restaurant is pretty small and the tables are all close to each other, so be aware if that bothers you. \\nOn to the food! For appetizers we had the buffalo brussel sprouts (pretty saucy and hot, but tasty- worth getting once, not sure I need to order them again), and the ricotta-mozzarella fritters (OMG, so fluffy, so cheesy, so delicious... must order them again, asap). I shared the hangar steak and French fries, it was delicious and perfectly cooked. My husband had the goat stew (cause how often can you order that, honestly), and he loved it. The portion was very big, and could be shared, had a good portion of all the ingredients and was spicy, but not overwhelmingly so. We all shared the bread pudding, it was pretty sweet. Not bad, but not the best I've had. Originally chose this place for the fried chicken all the reviews rave about, but found out it is only served as a special on Monday nights. Guess, I'll have to come back."},{"name":"Pig Floyd's Urban Barbakoa","address":"1326 N Mills Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Great tacos and other entrees and plenty of indoor and outdoor seating, dog friendly outside. Plenty of food for one person. Highly recommend."},{"name":"Beast","address":"5425 NE 30th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I'm sorry to say that the Beast defeated me. I'm pretty shocked to see others here complaining about the portion sizes. This place does some cool stuff, but there was so much richness and such massive amounts of it that my stomach rebelled and didn't even let me finish the meal.\\n\\nThe cozy space has two long, communal tables. The larger one filled up quickly and looked like a pretty convivial group, but we were seated with just one other couple that didn't seem like they wanted to chat, so that was kind of awkward. More annoying was that both our seats had our back to the chef's table, so we couldn't watch what was being plated.\\n\\nThe creamy tomato veloute topped with a crispy fried white anchovy was the perfect starter. Then came the charcuterie - pork rillette, chicken liver mousse, steak tartare with quail egg, and fois gras bon bon. All went swimmingly until the bon bon, a dome of fois gras perched on a piece of shortbread. I was already sated with the richness of the other meats, and it didn't make sense to eat the bon bon in more than one bite. This medallion of fois was so huge and rich I was gagging to get it down, and the sweetness of the shortbread added a strange note.\\n\\nNext, the tender, flavorful bison loin with butternut squash, creamed mustard greens, caramelized shallots, and pickled mushrooms. This was one of the best dishes I'd had in a while, but each of its components were so rich the brightness of the mushrooms was barely enough to cut it. The portion was also really big, but I finished it, and my brain pretty much thought that was the grand finale.\\n\\nI didn't eat much after that. Next came a salad, and instead of the bright, refreshing salad called for after that bison, this was a heavy salad with curried vinaigrette and rich pecans.\\n\\nNext, a cheese plate with honey, apricots, marcona almonds. The cheeses weren't memorable - all I can recall is the brillat savarin, which I didn't eat a bit of because triple cream was just not what the moment was calling for.\\n\\nThe boy liked the coconut cream cake with caramel and blood orange ice cream, but I thought it too sweet and didn't eat this either. This is a lovely place with a lot of talent, but I found Beast over the top, focused on showing off what it can do rather than crafting an experience with the right balance, one that leaves the diner anticipating the next delight."},{"name":"Signatures Mills Stone Tavern","address":"94 Mill St","city":"Gahanna","stars":"3.5","text":"One of my family members works there and wanted us to meet for dinner after his shift was over. When we arrived he was waiting for us on the front patio. While we were getting seated he informed the waitress, Shay, that we were there and needed menus, drinks, etc. We waited forever for her to attend to us. We placed our order with minor modifications to one sandwich. In addition to the meals and appetizers we ordered from Signatures, we also called in an appetizer from the restaurant across the street for pick-up at the same time.\\n\\nWe picked up our appetizer and had consumed more than half of it before our appetizer from Signatures ever arrived at our table. About 15 minutes later my brother (who works there) went in to check on our food. He then delivered our meals, appetizers, condiments, silverware, napkins, etc. to the table.\\n\\nThe sandwich with modifications was incorrect and his cheese pizza was burnt to a crisp. We decided not to complain because we were limited on time and didn't have time to wait for the orders to be remade. The waitress came to check on us AFTER we already had our food, but didn't acknowledge the fact that my brother had delivered our food. He returned to the bar a couple times to get drink refills for our party. We finished eating and asked for two boxes and the check, that also took forever. The entire time we were there the waitress only visited our table a total of three times. I understand that my brother works there, but we specifically waited until his shift was over so we could all eat together without interruption.\\n\\nWe were hugely disappointed in the (lack of) service from our assigned waitress, the time it took to receive the food, quality of food and the food temperature. I can honestly say if my brother didn't work there we'd never come back. There are too many other restaurants within walking distance that offer much better service and food quality for the same amount of money. I can't imagine what the wait is on a busy night, we were there on a Wednesday and Signatures wasn't even that busy. Must have been social hour for the staff.\\n\\nSad to see such a landmark in Gahanna decline to this level. I hope Signatures gets their wait staff together or they may not be standing much longer."},{"name":"Cask & Larder","address":"565 W Fairbanks Ave","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4","text":"First time eating at the Cask & Larder, and I must say it lives up to the hype.  From the moment you walk in the door, you get this comfortable vibe that exudes from the staff and the friendly earth tones that define the interior.  Everyone there is so friendly and welcoming, and that attitude rubs off on the patrons who in return are chatty and courteous.  We had not made reservations, but were directed to the bar which was packed.  A soon to be departing guest saw us looking around for a place to sit and offered up their spots.\\n\\nHaving found seats a few seats and a table end, I ventured to the bar.  I did not have to flag down a bartender who pushed the drink menu toward me on the bar and asked what I'd have.  The craft beers made at C&L and in collaboration with other brewers around the state are top of the menu - my kind of place.  I started with the Black Cyprus Brown ale - a dark brew made with English oats.  It was great - a nicely balanced beer tilted slightly to the malty side.  I half to confess that I had stopped in a week earlier and had a beer flight.  While good, none of those were as tasty as this one.  I assume this means that the brewer is going to keep getting better working with the brand new brewing equipment through a window by the bar.  The cask conditioned English stout I had later was also excellent.\\n\\nSince we didn't have much table space, we got several items to share tapas style:  Smoked Oyster & Crawfish Pot Pie, Oxtail Tamale, Roasted Boudin, Waffle Fries and Bibb Lettuce Salad.  Although all the items were very good in their own way, the Oxtail Tamale was the standout - tasty meat and cornmeal with a mild jalapeno relish.  The  Smoked Oyster & Crawfish Pot Pie matched its description the least although it was still very tasty.  I was also impressed with the Waffle Fries not being a big fried food fan.  They and other fried items were done to perfection with a crunchy exterior.  The Fries were described with a chicken liver gravy which did not sound too appetizing to me, but it really was delicious.  The Boudin (sausage) will appeal to some, but it needed more spice for me.  Still, it is unusual to see it outside of Louisiana.\\n\\nAs if we really needed more, we also shared the Mud Pie In A Jar dessert which was made with a high-quality chocolate creme and a custard.  Something like that is usually chocolate overload for me, but I could have easily eaten the whole thing myself.\\n\\nCask & Larder is not cheap, but priced in line with other Winter Park restaurants.  \\nThe quality of the food and the comfortable atmosphere make the expense worthwhile for a nice meal out.  Ron and Julie from The Ravenous Pig have definitely done a great job renovating this historic location and creating another WP culinary icon.  I definitely plan to frequent C&L."},{"name":"Urban Gate","address":"1158 The High Street, Suite 102","city":"Coquitlam","stars":"3","text":"I had a great lunch with my wife today.

It was one young lady that was really friendly and was smiling, the other women were preoccupied and happy/relieved the friendly one stepped up to the plate so they didn't have to be bothered. Why is that a common behavior with minorities? Why turn up the customer service for different complexions but when you see those that \\"favor your own\\" you get lackadaisical and don't feel the need to give the same service? This is no exaggeration because as we were leaving an older caucasian couple came in and they were immediately greeted (with smiles I might add) as where we weren't until the friendly lady came to assist us. 0_o ummmm ok then. It's sad because I had my children with me with me and they were very interested in the pizza making process and were lifted up to watch the ladies make pizzas and they weren't even engaging to the kids. The friendly lady that was helping us mentioned they had cookies and juice boxes for a nominal price if we were interested. Without the friendly lady that helped us, I would knock their rating down to a 2 out of 5 stars. \\n\\nCleanliness: 4 out 5 stars. Some tables needed tidying up but nothing too major. The friendly smiling lady that helped us I observed her refilling the cheese and red pepper flakes. There was a heavy set lady with a blonde weave that came from the back after the fact that was friendly and very task oriented. \\n\\nThe food quality: 5 out of 5 stars. I was impressed with the cleanliness and the organization of the food station to prepare the pizzas. I liked how you could observe every step of the process.\\n\\nThe actual taste: the pizza I tried before that made me come back was the build your own pizza; it had the olive oil base, the regular crust, mushrooms, blue cheese, and mozzerella. That pizza was amazing and I give it 5 stars. Today were ordered the steak and blue as a recommendation of the employees, THAT PIZZA IS REPULSIVE!!! the balsamic glaze is nauseating! I wish we would've dinned in so I couldve returned the damn thing! But we got all the way home just be disappointed after having such great pizza from our previous visits. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THE STEAK AND BLUE UNLESS YOU OMIT THE BALSAMIC GLAZE!!!!!  It was so unedible I had to blot that crap off just to get the kids to finish their slice! My children refused a 2nd slice of pizza. Smh this is coming from kids that can eat 2 slices a piece from felinni's pizza. I'm an avid pizza eater and have had pizza from all over the world damn near and that balsamic glaze is just dreadful! You have been warned. I'm docking a star because it was a recommendation and that recommendation sucked!! \\n \\nThey do have reasonable priced kids meals, they offer beer and wine, they have an array of soft drinks and bottled sodas, as well as bottle sparkling water and juicy juice boxes. They have cookies and a cool poster board announcing employee of the month and activities in the area for the family. \\n\\nOverall the price point is good, the quality is great, the service is decent, and the location is somewhat convient. Will I come back? Yes, although the recommendation sucked it was with good intention, next time I will just build my own so I know it's perfection! This place is way better than papa johns, pizza hut, little Caesars, and other little jive chain pizza joints I've tried. Next time you want pizza and think take out, DONT! just burn the gas and come here, for what you spend to feed the fam delivery pizza you can come here and spend about the same and get better quality! So why not have it your way without paying an arm and leg and those silly delivery fees on top of a tip?! \\n\\nImprovements to be made in my opinion is having a group meeting and ensuring the customer service remains equipollent regardless of the race of patron. If the situation was reversed I'm sure those ladies who didn't give us customer service would scream racism if they went into an establishment and Caucasian workers did that to them but because we are \\"the same\\" in their eyes we don't deserve to be greeted with smiles and engaged in a friendly manner **shrugs**\\n\\n."},{"name":"The Manchester Arms","address":"1705 Virginia Ave","city":"College Park","stars":"4","text":"I don't give out five stars often, but this was all around great.

The entrance area is the old bar and as you head down the narrow bar area, you'll find the patio.  It's a great spot to enjoy the cool Austin evening weather and catch the game on one of the outside TVs.  The 3rd bar area is adjacent to the entrance and is significantly larger with an interesting winter ski theme to it.  There are ski slopes in the Bayou?  I don't know why the theme, but just sit on the ski lift booth and have fun with it man.  \\n\\nThe Cajun food here is some of the best in town.  They have HUGE Po'Boys (try the roast beef!), gumbo and delicious etouffee.  Make sure to come by during week nights as well because they have some of the best dinner specials in town.  Tuesday night's special is the pork chop, don't do you dare miss this!  It is out of this world.   The beer selections are pretty slim, so don't try 'n get too fancy here.

Perfectly dressed with complimentary flavors. \\n\\nNext, we ordered the Mezzaluna Ravioli. The ravioli are large and fried, which led to some tough edges.

I had a pretzel and a bratwurst and this is exactly what I want to be eating when I'm drinking beer. It just hit the spot. I'm a huge mustard fan though so it was great to see a place that pays attention to detail and gets the little things right. I tried 3 different beers that I really enjoyed and then settled on some brooklyn lager that went perfect with the 2nd smaller pretzel I got. \\n\\nWhat bad things could you possibly say about the decor? It has an unassuming and quaint entrance with a french style bakery in the entrance way. There is an artisanal feel with fresh breads and pretzels hanging from the wall. You almost feel like you have flour on your hands just walking through. As you walk down the stairs you realize that's just the beginning of the experience of Easy Tiger. It opens up into a beautifully stylized and original bar and seating area. Think Royal Tenenbaums meets the rendezvous bar in Inglorious Basterds.

The grainy mustard and charred bread complimented the pate. \\nThe risotto pancakes were rich and creamy on the inside and crispy on the outside. The tomato jam added a slight touch of sweetness to it. \\n\\nSecond Course:\\nThe Caesar salad's dressing was aggressively seasoned (which I liked) and we really enjoyed the boquerones (which they make in house) that came with the salad. I would have preferred it if there was a little less radicchio, but overall a flavorful salad.\\nThe Zuppa di Pasta e Fagioli was a bit on the bland side and I had to add some salt. Other than that it was light and fresh.\\n\\nThird Course:\\nThe house pasta was served with ricotta, mushrooms, spinach, and soft boiled egg. The pasta was fresh and perfectly cooked al dente. The ricotta and egg added a nice creaminess and richness to the dish.\\nThe roasted pork loin was very flavorful with a balsamic demi-glace. Accompanied with portobello mushrooms and sun-dried tomatoes made this dish rustic and hearty. The pork was just a tad more well done than what I would have liked (I like my pork slightly pink in the middle) but it was still very moist. \\n\\nFourth Course:\\nI'm not really a dessert person but I have to say their tiramisu was pretty tasty.

She immediately seated us in the front of the house where we could watch the quietly buzzing back dining room and bar area.  It's a beautiful restaurant, with nice white linen tables, the lighting is just enough, not too bright but not fumbling in the dark.  Our server was very conservative and traditional, giving us ample time to talk over the menu and look at their well-rounded but not too long wine list.  My friend and I shared a large Caesar salad, which was perfectly dressed, not too much, not too little and all the ingredients were fresh and crisp. I ordered one of the specials of the day, ricotta gnocchi in a cream sauce dressed with dried red peppers.  My dinner partner ordered the pizzoccheri coi rapini.  The food was served very quickly and it was steaming hot.  The gnocchi was cooked to PERFECTION and the cream sauce was absolutely heaven.  The red peppers were dried, slightly crunchy, and mildly sweet.  This is, hands down, the best Italian meal I have ever had in Atlanta.  As soon as I took my first bite all I could say was, \\"oh wow, this is amazing\\", and I continued saying it after every bite.
