I made reservations for 7:00 pm and we all arrived at Riviera Bistro a few minutes before 7 pm. We were greeted courteously by the owner and escorted to our table. The decor inside the restaurant was beautiful considering the limited space. The chandeliers and the art work on the walls were appealing and fit perfectly in the well designed and cozy space. That was, in retrospect, the absolute and only highlight of the evening. The menu was well designed and offerred the customer an appealing variety of choices. My wife and one of the guests ordered a glass of Sauvignon Blanc. I started the dinner by ordering Calamari Fritti and Pommes Frites (french fries). The appetizers arrived shortly. A soon as the server placed the calamari plate on the table, my wife immediately pointed to a long strand of hair laying conspicuously accross the plate. The server apologized and immediately took the plate back to replace the order with a fresh one. It is, however, beyong comprehension, how a visible hair on a customer's plate can escape the scrutiny of final inspection by several people in the kitchen. It was at that moment that I realized the entire meal would be a total flop. And it was. The fresh Calamari Fritti plate was served again. It was, unfortunately, grossly overcooked with an after taste of near-rancid oil. They were no tentacles, not even one to be found in a small mound of fried calamari rings. The plate contained an abundance of tasteless fried crumbs. It seemed as if the chef or sous-chef literally emptied the frier into the plate without any consideration for appeal and presentation. A thin shiny layer of oil was clearly visible under the calamari. The plate came with three sauces that were very poorly slopped onto the plate. The sauces were barely enough to coat about 8 calamari rings and were completely devoid of any creative thinking and flavor. The sauces were literally slopped next to eachother, therefore mingling and loosing any potential for a distinctive flavor. The Pommes Frites were good. They were served with Ketchup, even though none of us ordered it. That was almost funny. How about something a little more creative...\\nNext, we ordered three Caesar salads and one Bistro salad. The lettuce was firm, fresh, and the dressing was superb with a delicious lingering taste of fresh anchovies. This, however, was all deflated when you bit into a boring and completely stale crouton. The Bistro salad was outstanding with the right mix of vegetables and flavors. I was given a cheap looking personal and disposal pepper grinder upon asking for some cracked pepper. The kind you buy at a supermarket and take with you to a camp site. Really!!!\\nMy wife and I along with our guests already knew the entire dinner was a total failure. Among all of this, the Sauvignon Blanc that my wife and her guest were drinking was no longer available. For the main course, I ordered Shrimp Scampi. My wife ordered Chicken Saltimbocca, and our guests ordered Salmon Roulade and Chicken Marsala. My Shrimp Scampi arrived and I could tell immediately the shrimp was undercooked. The shrimp had no sear color and looked blanched. Totally devoid of any color. And of course, it was grossly undercooked, almost raw, with only the outer skin layer cooked. Again, another stomach turning experience. The Scampi sauce was difficult to find on the plate and there was this green smear of what looked like pesto on the edge of the plate. It literally looked like as if someone had engulfed a pound of pesto then proceeded to lick the edge of the plate. Really not appealing. Okay. So now second shrimp dish arrives. The shrimp is cooked to perfection but....that is all...No burst in any flavors. Just seared shrimp with an abundance of overly salty and dried petites capers. My wife's chicken was so dry that it looked like dark meat. I will spare you the details of the other two entrees, but I believe the reader at this point can guess how the rest of the dinner transpired. The most offensive and dismissive part of the entire meal came when the server, as a consolation prize, offered the entire table, one FREE Creme Brulee. Wow! Talk about stellar customer relations. I could see the owner interact with her staff behind the bar. The owner never visited our table to even apologize or discuss the situation. That is unforgiveable! The bill for the meal was $176.45 plus a tip of $28 for a total of $204.45. I might have saved a lot of money by having dinner at Mandola's next door. I strongly recommend the readers avoid this restaurant.

I could only finish a slice and a half of the french toast. Maybe it was just the combination of the  sugar on the toast or the syrups that I poured but WOW, even with my sweet-tooth I couldn't finish more than 1.5 slices of this order. \\n\\nThe second time I was here, I was also a little overambitious. \\n\\nBOURBON MAPLE BACON MILKSHAKE ($6).

Our party, reading the raving reviews, expected warm Southern hospitality and great food, we received neither. \\n\\nFrom the start, we had a few minor issues with the attitude of the hostess. When we arrived at the restaurant at 2:00PM, the restaurant was pretty busy and we approached the hostess to ask for a table. My friend politely gave the hostess our party name, but when she couldn't hear her, she rudely interjected \\"I CAN'T HEAR YOU.\\" When requested to know how long the wait would be, the conversation went a little like this: \\"Do you know how long the wait will be?\\" \\"I don't know.\\" \\"Can you please give us an estimate?\\" \\"I. Don't. Know. Whenever someone leaves I guess.\\"\\n\\nAs we were waiting, we were able to observe some of the occurings of how the restaurant ran. When diners finished, we noticed it took quite a while for tables to be cleaned up and many tables were left unattended. During one of the cleanups, one of the waiters spilled a pitcher of milk while she was walking, and she just ran off without coming back to clean it up for almost 20 minutes. As we waited, my friends and I as well as other diners wondered, \\"When is this puddle ever going to get cleaned up?\\"\\n\\nWe were eventually seated 50 minutes after we arrived. A 50 minute wait for good food isn't a problem, but other issues emerged throughout the course of our meal. When we sat down, we asked the hostess if she could let our waitress know that we were ready to order, as we had been waiting for a while and were hungry. She rudely responded that she didn't know when the waitress would be over. I asked again if the hostess could let the waitress know, and she said yeah. When the waitress came over with water glasses, she really didn't say much. Needless to say, we felt incredibly unwelcome. As she finished up, one of the members of our party lightly mentioned that we were ready to order. She shortly and sarcastically responded, \\"I heard.\\" \\"Made with Love, Served with Joy?\\" More like served with sass.\\n\\nSomeone at our table ordered coffee, and the waitress forgot about the order. At a table of 6, if there was only ONE person who ordered a drink, forgetting is just unacceptable. My friend had to ask again for her coffee. Also, we were never provided with utensils and had to ask the waitress for them, AFTER receiving our food. Were we expected to eat with our hands?\\n\\nSoon, my friend noticed there was a prominent lipstick stain on his water glass. Disgusted, he showed a waiter passing by, and she just replied, \\"Yep,\\" and ran off with no apology, explanation, or even a confirmation that she would replace the glass. \\n\\nWhen we started eating, one of my friends noticed that there was a hair in her food. Instead of remaking her food, the restaurant just took the plate back and never returned, as she was only halfway done with her meal. We notified the manager about the hair and the glass, and she sympathized, but said nothing more than \\"Aw I hate when that happens, we'll take it off the check.\\"\\n\\nIn conclusion, the food was great. But we will never be coming to this restaurant again because of the terribly rude service, slow and inefficient operations, and gross kitchen management. Customer service and organization are such a big part of the brunch experience, and even after busy brunches in New York, LA, Houston, SF, and more, this meal in Atlanta was by far the worst experience we've had with brunch."},{"name":"Waxy O'Connor's","address":"94 Hartwell Ave","city":"Lexington","stars":"3","text":"Service was OK.

Actually probably the best cheesesteak ( AKA broad-street bomber ) outside of Chicago.

It makes it a bit awkward to eat in front of someone who's waiting for their food--but it's too good not to!! \\nTheir potato pancake thingy is yummy, but very greasy so if that's not your thing, order the broad street bomber with hot peppers ( they aren't really that hot- more like jardineras) , a side of real onion rings, a Diet Pepsi ( because Portland seems to like Pepsi) or just have a local craft beer. If steak isn't your thing then I also highly recommend their meatball sandwiches, chicken Parmesan, or their seasonal hash with bacon.

I said ok and I paid half off a 30 dollar order. I saw 3 bags on the counter 2 people came in after me that had take out orders and sat with us.15 dollars  for 2 hamburger,kids spaghetti and a hammy over moons.  Good right?! WRONG!!! FOOD  WAS COLD except the spaghetti which we had to remind them we were waiting for our food.   My daughters spaghetti was hot and grapes were cold.   they threw the hammy over moon in a box all messed up. It should be in a sandwich right? Nope. And my burger just wait,my burger HAD MOLD!!!

There were three choices: Wagyu beef tenderloin ($145), Wagyu strip loin ($30/ounce) or chicken teriyaki (a reasonable $21). So it was a steak that costs a fortune or something one could get at any corner Japanese joint. Not for nothing, though, the tenderloin was delicious.

We arrived to find the lot parking pretty easy.  Although it appeared pretty full, all 5 of us found a space.  The first door from the lot advises to proceed to the revolving door.  I was pleasantly surprised at the 70's music playing in the background (Curtis Mayfield to be exact). Upon entrance we were greeted by the hostess and seated right away with a partial party.  Our party of 5 was seated in large booth near the bar - plenty of room.  Our server, Creighton, came pretty quickly with water and gave us the specials.  He was very friendly and accommodating throughout our visit.  I was pleasantly surprised at the 70's music playing lightly in the background - Curtis Mayfield to be exact.  I enjoyed the decor which was clean with some rustic touches.  Nice atmosphere.  There was a patio too, but we couldn't see it from where we sat.  I imagine it was full based on the parking lot and not many people inside. \\n\\nOur Libations: mimosa, tea (loose leaf served in press), No sleep till Brooklyn and Moscow Mule.  We were a little sad that we didn't order the punch bowl once we noticed it after we placed our drink orders.  Definitely will try punch bowl next time.  I thought the No sleep till Brooklyn was the standout.  If you like bourbon, you'll be pleased.\\n\\nWhat we ordered/How it was (1-5 Scale):\\nAppetizer: Deviled eggs - 5 halves.  I wondered where the 6th was since 3 eggs had to be halved.  But I digress.

Light clean taste, would have like more gravy.  Thumbs up for being made without pork (3.5).\\n\\nChicken sausage patties - I think these were Delia's judging by the flavor.  Side order was 2.  The were served warm and go cold pretty quickly. (3.0)\\n\\nFrench Toast - The ultimate breakfast critique gave this the seal of approval.  A self -proclaimed french toast purist, so I'm pretty sure its really good (4.0)\\n\\nSmoked Salmon open face biscuit sandwich (custom order) - This was a concoction of the smoked salmon bagel on the menu, the frittata special toppings and the open face biscuit sandwich.  I didn't taste it, but it went pretty quickly and one of the toughest food critics of the bunch said it was good. (4.0)\\n\\nTator Tots - Not sure if the seasoning was skimped on, but I didn't taste the garlic herb seasoning.  The were crispy and good at any rate.

Half way through our dinner we learn no one else can join us in the basement because the \\"guest list\\" is at capacity filled with a 40th and 30th birthday party. Fine. Would have been nice to know when planning the event. Fine. We get downstairs and begin the usual cat and mouse game of ordering drinks through \\"your waitress.\\" This always goes two ways: great or poor. Our experience was poor. 30 minute wait time between drinks. Every round of drinks had a 2-3 missing. Uncertainties about who ordered what when handing out the drinks. No fireball. No doctors. No patron. Fine. Night ends, the lights are on, 3/4 of our party left and we're the last ones standing to close out the tab, only to realize we're $150 short of our minimum. That would have been nice to know around last call. Fine. When we questioned the likelihood of this, as we had 20+ people ordering from our section for 4 hours ($500/20ppl=$25/~2 drinks pp EASY), we were humiliated in front of the remaining staff and friends as they talked down to the birthday girl and me. All the while we're willing to hand over the credit card for the remaining $150, we just want the mutual understanding that there was a chance our waitress did not do the best job and could have potentially made mistakes. One being that my portion of the tab was somehow nonexistent and my information \\"is no where in the system\\" symbolizing \\"I've never spent a dollar at Capo\\" when in reality I dropped $36 upstairs on pizza. \\n\\nOur night was fine. The live band was excellent. If the management team handled our predicament with class, I'd feel better about the night, but they chose to dishonor customers.

If you prefer to drive, there's a municipal parking lot around the corner as well as on-street parking in front of the restaurant. Be careful getting out of your car, though, because the traffic zooms by so fast that you could get taken out before dinner instead of being taken out to dinner.\\n\\nThe ambiance. It's casual and cute and, in keeping with the travel theme, there are tme-zone cloks on the wall and a host stand made of stacked suitcases. Just past the tiny waiting area and a host stand, there's a small L shaped bar and about four tables, including a high top. Behind the bar is a second small room with more tables, and past it, the kitchen and restrooms. \\n\\nThey don't take reservations and only seat whole parties - which they make clear on their website -- so be prepared. While my date was parking the car, another couple came in and were seated ahead of us. And while the bar seating is first-come, it ends up being a free-for-all as the more aggressive patrons lunge for seats ahead of those who have been waiting longer. It seems like there could be a better system, as it is especially awkward as throngs of waiting patrons (including kids looking wan and tortured) press hungrily against the backs of those already dining at the bar. (Maybe this is intentional? in keeping with the travel theme?)\\n\\nWe were among those dining at the bar and, I have to say, it's my preference. The slightly larger back room has an unruly feel with tables arranged haphazardly. While the front room seems thoughtful, the back room looks like a middle school cafeteria after last lunch.\\n\\nThe drinks. An attentive bartender is always a good thing. When I was the only customer waiting, the host suggested that I order a drink from the bar. This was before it was really busy, so I stood patiently and waited for the bartender to make eye contact. He was standing in front of a woman who couldn't decide what she wanted to drink. He made eye contact with me and gave me the sign that I took to mean \\"one second.\\" So far, I'm okay with this, although part of me wonders, ya know, she's humming and hawing over there about what to get, why not give me one more second of your attention so I can say \\"Jack's Abbey\\"? Instead, after dismissing me, he waited through her request -- which was for a tasting -- and the poured her a drink -- an inch of wine -- and then turned away never to be seen again until an hour later when  I was at the bar ordering dinner. A good bartender can handle more than one request at a time. A good bartender will say, in a timely manner, what can i get you? After the bartender ignored me, the host offered to take my drink order, which he did, and then brought it to me. Maybe the host has seen this before with this particular bartender? Later, howver, the inattentive bartender mixed several very good cocktails, which made me forget the earlier slight -- sorta -- although the next day I wondered if, in his forgetfulness, he also forget to add that beer to our tab.\\n\\nThe food is inventive and good. It speaks well of Passport that even though we ordered seven items, and liked all of them, I saw esaily seven more that I would have liked to have tried. I'd definitely come back. Here's what we got:\\n\\noven roasted olives $4\\nThese were very good. A big portion for two people, especially with all the other stuff. I would definitely get these again but I'd order them the second I sat down so that I could nosh on them while making other decisions. As the host said when i asked how long the wait might be: people tend to linger.\\n\\nthai pumpkin coconut soup $4\\nI liked this but not enough to finish the entire serving. The coconut is roasted on top like croutons so that the crunchy contrasts the pumpkin puree. Date didn't like this.\\n\\nmexican street corn $7\\nTwo pieces. The cheese is delicious. Date didn't like the char on the corn; I did.\\n\\nempanadas $6\\nI wasn't going to eat this because I think of empanadas as a lot of breading but I decided to take a bite and I'm glad I did (after dipping it in the aioli). So good!\\n\\nburrata with avocado and tomato salad $8\\nMy favorite. So simple yet so fulfilling. A big plump serving of fresh mozzarella with tomatoes and avocados and aioli. I can't imagine how good this will be when tomatoes are in season.\\n\\nlomo saltado (peruvian marinated beef) $18\\nThis looks amazing, even if ours didn't look like the ones pictured  on Yelp. The potatoes are scary, like something out of sci fi, the meat is tender and perfectly cooked. The rice was good, too, although ours was hidden, unlike the pictures.\\n\\nroasted vegetable pappardelle *8\\nThe roasted veggies are a delight.

My friend & her family go here all the time.  My friend & I have similar taste, so I thought I would like it, but I did not.  The hostess was friendly, but our waitress did not even smile.  The ambience is nice inside, sort of rustic/rural feel with big wicker chairs & floral prints.  The music choices are sort of strange.  When we first came in, it was Tony Bennett & Frank Sinatra.  Near the end of the meal, it was adult contemporary with a calypso background.   There's a small, townie like bar inside with nice flat screen tv's..  There were only 3 other full tables in the restaurant and we still had to wait 10 minutes for water.  The bread was a white roll & zucchini bread, both of which were delicious.  I thought it was very unique to serve zucchini bread.  A salad is served with pasta entrees.  The salad is dark greens with cucumber, tomato, and croutons.  I had raspberry vinaigrette dressing, which looked & tasted homemade.  I ordered the pasta primavera (and added chicken), which the menu stated \\"medley of vegetables\\".   I would have figured that there were four or five different veggies,especially seasonal ones like zucchini.  Instead, it was red & green peppers & black olives.  That's it.  Now, I understand that this is my fault for not asking, shame on me.  But it gets better.  The meal was bland and flavorless.  It tasted like pasta, olive oil,  & peppers, when it said it came with a lemon/garlic butter sauce.  I didn't taste lemon/garlic butter.  I tried a bite of the bf's alfredo, which had no flavor, either.  Also, I saw black things in the salt & parmesan, but since they were in both, I'm thinking it was some kind of preservative.  I sure hope so.  It's small inside, but the restaurant flambes certain items tableside, such as cherries jubilee.

I guess due to the slowdown in business the last few weeks had them have only few cooks in the kitchen. Food was served after 35 minutes, and I would say they're very average american food. I would come back just because of the service.

We were greeted after my boyfriend and I entered Deschutes and we were seated promptly. After looking at the menu, we already knew what have we wanted but there was no on in sight to take our order. We waited for another 15 minutes and another table was seated next to us (2 Caucasian women) and magically a waiter appeared. So, you're telling me that a waiter wouldn't have shown up if 2 Caucasian women didn't get seated next to us? Anyways, I made eye contact with the waiter so he would know that we have been waiting and are ready to order. He came and greeted our table and asked if we were ready to order, we told him we interested in the sampler so he provided us with a note pad to write our beers down. So at Deschutes they have classical beers and pub exclusives and the beers were numbered as well, so I had wrote down the type of beer (classic/pub ex.) and the number of the beer. He came back to check and said that we had to re-write it with the whole name of the beer. It would have been nice for him to tell us that earlier. So he took the list and ripped it and made us re-write it. Okay, no biggie. He came back to our table to pick up the list and if we wanted anything to eat, I asked for an order of the garlic fries and the waiter said, \\"oh. I didn't understand what you said.\\" So my boyfriend repeated the order and our waiter laughed and walked away. We're assuming he didn't get our order because the 2 Caucasian women got their appetizer before us even though we ordered before them. So. I'm assuming he didn't even enter our order. I'll update this as I go. Still here waiting for our garlic fries.

Conceptually, I love Shiki because they serve the kind of Japanese food that I love and miss.  I thought the stuffed squid was inventive, the kurobuta (grilled pork) with a dash of salt was mouthwatering, dobinmushi(soup in a tea pot) refreshing and the dashimaki (eggs) perfectly done.  Without a doubt, the food was fantastic.\\n\\nThe service on the other hand, however was not so fantastic.  We went there on a Friday night so despite being at an easy to miss location, it was completely packed.  When we got there, there was no hostess and there wasn't much room to stand.  We were essentially ignored for a good ten minutes until I finally approached a waiter and ask him how long it would be for a table.  He said ten minutes... but then we ended up sitting at the bar, which isn't really a big deal, but it was kind of awkward b/c we could overhear the conversation of the couple next to us.  Also the food seem to take forever to come out for us and a few of the surrounding table.... though the couple next to us who ordered in Japanese, received their food suspiciously promptly.  The waiters were never explicitly rude; in fact, they look like very sweet people, but nonetheless they were inefficient and the service really bugged me.  It was along the lines of: I can tell this waiter is trying, but he's just inept and I can't help but get annoyed but then I feel bad about getting annoyed b/c he really wasn't a bad guy.... so yea... it was not a good cycle.\\n\\nI know I will inevitably find myself back at Shiki, but I am definitely going to opt for the quiet nights to avoid any headaches."},{"name":"The Carvery","address":"51 E Gay St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Just get the porchetta, you'll thank me later.

The initial craze of being able to buy so many foreign and imported beers and being able to get pretty much any type of any kind of beer kind of wears off with the sky high pricing at some points, and I've usually found that it's easier on my wallet to just go with whatever the fire sale is.  Also, the Beer Knurd's plates on the walls are pretty impressive, but as soon as you realize that those people are actually paying over a thousand dollars in beer tasting to pretty much buy their own plate, it's a bit ridiculous to me. Pretty impressive--just not for me. \\n\\nRegardless, it IS a good place, just nothing spectacular or too unique about it. It'd be awesome if they had more dart boards! Usually I feel like the place is packed to the max, and if we come with a large party it's hard to find a place to sit, let alone play darts. It's not much of a hole-in-the-wall considering there's locations in other cities, and it's hard to want to come here as opposed to other local beer-connoisseur locales unless out of convenience (your friends are only happy at places that are familiar to them; you live really close to the Triangle).

When I walked in on a Friday at 11:30 I was the only customer in there.  Upon ordering I was told that they were out of guacamole and out of large drink cups to go.  I ordered and went to the ladies room where there was NO SOAP dispenser!!  So how are the employees supposed to wash their hands after using the restroom?  When I cam out the young employee came over and said they were out of the chipotle bun for my burger so what other bun did I want.  I said I guess the egg bun.  While waiting I noticed that the floors in the entire restaurant were filthy and there were flies everywhere. In fact flies kept swarming my head.   Before I got my to-go order 3 other groups of customers came and 2 of those groups got their orders before I did.  When I asked the young girl why she said they were waiting on my bun (?!)  I said I will take any bun, specifically the fastest bun I could get since I had waited about 25 minutes already for my order.  When I finally got my order, the onion ring cup was less than half full, and they were cold and soggy -- not crisp which is one of the main reasons we loved Smashburger so much originally.  The meat in both burgers was overdone, but all in all they were okay but not great for the price.  The Smash fries were also cold and didn't have any of the flavors we remembered from before and that we paid extra to get.\\n\\nSo obviously something has gone very wrong with this restaurant.

I have and will continue to eat at Tamale House East, I just hope the owner/managers can address this issue for future patrons. \\n\\nI'll start from the beginning. \\n\\nI ordered food from nice man at front counter.  I asked him about the tamales (which one was his favorite, what sauces were best, etc). So I went with bean, cheese and jalape√±o tamale with mole sauce, a veggie chalupa w guac and my friend ordered huevos rancheros. The nice man at the counter asked what type of tortillas did she want and she replied flour. This becomes important later. \\n\\nMoving on. Food comes out and it is all delicious. I forgot to grab the sauces from inside so I run back and grab some. You can't forget the salsas and their green sauce is white hot while smoked red sauce is milder but still has a kick. The tamale was big and made with olive oil so it stayed moist.  The jalape√±o was nice and hot and the filling was sufficient. The mole sauce was on point. At this point we realize there are no tortillas for the huevos rancheros. I walk back in and go up to front counter. \\n\\nThere are two men standing at one register: the guy that took my order, who was still busy taking orders and another young man whose attention I grab. He walked over to me and I say, \\"Hello, the tortillas didn't come out with the huevos rancheros,\\" to which he replies, \\"Oh, you want some tortillas?\\" I replied, \\"Yes please, they didn't come out with the food.\\" \\"Okay, I'll get you some,\\" replies the young man and he walks into the kitchen. When he comes back, he hands me some fresh, warm tortillas wrapped in yellow paper. \\"Do the tortillas not come with the food?\\" I asked. At this point the guy working at the cash register replies first, \\"yes they do.\\" And the young man says, \\"Yes they do, just ask for them because we haven't been giving them out. I replied, \\"I did ask for them. I told him flour when he asked me what kind of tortillas while I was ordering the food.\\" The young man halfway interrupts me and says \\"I know,\\" and pats my shoulder before walking off. \\n\\nI'm not sure what exactly happened I just know that this guys attitude was off. I'm annoyed bc I worked at restaurants for a long time and know that what should have happened was the following: \\n\\"Hello, the tortillas didn't come out with the huevos rancheros.\\" Then the young man should say, \\"Oh I am so sorry, let me get those for you.\\"  The end. It's hard to convey attitudes in review but this guy was being super rude. Based on other conversations I hear him having, he is rude to the people working with him as well. I hope he's not the manager, or if he is he's probably the owner's son or something. Either way, he needs to fix his attitude right up fast! This is the SERVICE INDUSTRY!

We got two sashimi lunch boxes, a deluxe lunch box and the deal for two sushi rolls for $11.  Normally when I look at a bento box, they're pretty small and I'm definitely finishing my miso and salad.

I picked that based on reviews I read and it was definitely the better roll of the two.  We went with sashimi lunch boxes and it came with 9 sashimi pieces per order versus the sashimi platter for two which was more in price and less in pieces if you broke out the price charges per piece.  The deluxe had a variety of samples from their menu from all the teriyakis to the tempuras.  I love the variety and if you're the type that loves tapas or dim sum, this is the deal to go with if you're not a sushi person.

The evening started off great because just as we pulled up to the (&#$(#&)* valet stand (sorry to swear, but when did it become fashionable to have to pay to park in the private lot of the restaurant you're going to?) a nice woman yelled out to me that she was leaving her \\"rock star\\" spot right in front and I could have it.  Woo hoo.  I watched the guy parking cars give me a dirty look and I pulled into the free space.\\n\\nWe were seated immediately, even though the dining room was fairly full.  I've always liked the look of NXNW, the high celings and exposed beams.  They've never changed the decor in the 10 years they've been there, and that's a good thing.\\n\\nI usually ask what the seasonal brew is, this time it was a Summer Pilsner which normally I would shy away from, but I thought \\"What the heck?\\" and tried it.  It was really good, full of flavor for a light beer.\\n\\nWe skipped appetizers as we have never been a big fan of theirs.  The roasted garilc is the best choice, but they don't give you enough bread for it, and the other choices have left us underwhelmed.\\n\\nWith all the good steak houses in town (Ruth's Chris, Gumbo's, Sullivan's, etc.) I am amused at how much I like the filet at NXNW.  I order it almost every time I go there.  One reason is that it comes on a mushroom risotto and a port wine reduction sauce, which I love.  It did not disappoint again this evening.\\n\\nMy wife loves the salmon cooked on a cedar plank, and asks for the wasabi mashers each time.  The food this night was cooked exactly as ordered, and was delicious.\\n\\nThe minuses of NXNW are the limited free parking, the seemingly catatonic hostesses (as Dawn B mentioned, they seem to hire gorgeous little blondes who have robot-like personalities), and the somewhat spotty kitchen (I've had to send back a pork chop once because it was not cooked fully and my wife has complained once that her salmon piece was so tiny that it obviously was the last piece and they tried slide it by us).  We've eaten here at least 30 times in the past 11 years, so we consider those slight problems, certainly not enough to stop us from coming back.\\n\\nSince we live in northwest Austin, NXNW has become a staple for us.

Of course you do, you see the signs and everything up on Mass Ave between Central and Harvard! It's the ghost of restaurants past (one has to wonder if it has legs or not, HA!)...  Shiki is like the little kid brother (owned by the same owner) that managed to live through to the sequel and look pretty hot come the filming. Like if American Psycho was the sequel to Empire of the Sun, except with killing less hookers.\\n\\nThere honestly isn't a really large market for a place like Shiki here in Boston except to Japanese people, japanophiles and their asian girlfriends, semi-urban Brookline residents, and the 3 people who think Japanese food doesn't begin and end with sushi, hence the small size, limited servers, and basement locale.\\n\\nDespite these crossings, Shiki still shines. The food menu is pretty complex, wordy, and a number of specials are given to you. Food is served in small, shareable portions all of which are more than edible, but the following really stood out to me; Shiokara, which is the fresh squid marinated with squid liver sauce, neatly sliced up with cute little plate. Nothing like getting that true squid meat texture and gnawing on  tentacles to start an evening. The Dashimaki (think like scrambled eggs but more tofu like) was delicious and had excellent proportions and flavor with the sauce included.\\n\\nService was fine, had a \\"big\\" beer of Kirin, no need for anything else, although I am intrigued by the sake menu, and they have flights available for tastings. We shall see how it does with my taste buds.\\n\\nThe bill for a quite filling meal with more than a few items was completely reasonable. No qualms here.\\n\\nAs an aforementioned japanophile (abit in denial), Shiki is somewhere that I plan on going to a lot more often when I'm craving something Japanese and really don't want to just have the typical."},{"name":"Bistro Niko","address":"3344 Peachtree Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I went here for dinner a couple of weeks ago during the Buckhead Life Group's \\"Summer Dine Around\\" promotion.

I was hoping to get a drink, an appetizer and a few bites for the road (I have to brave the weather and head down south).  They said great, but we can't do happy hour food to go. Fine, no problem. Me: Can I just order extra and take it as leftovers since you're closing early and I have to hit the road? Waitress: I'll have to ask my manager. Me: I understand, thanks. Waitress: My manager said if you want to do that, it's okay. But if you want it boxed up like a to-go order then you'll have to order off the regular menu. Me: Sounds overly complicated. Do still get a box? Waitress: Yes. Me: Any easy way to just get my drink, my appetizers and a couple more to go? Waitress: I'm sorry, it's just our policy. Me: Okay, I think I'll pass since this isn't making sense.

No way, apparently. She enjoyed talking policy vs. service. She said I could order off regular menu if I wanted it to-go. Then she started telling me that I still had 45 minutes and I could just eat there. Maybe she wasn't hearing herself talk or - more importantly for a service business - hearing me (her customer).  \\n\\nBut by that time it had turned into an MBA case study for me so I asked her if she thought her approach made sense from my perspective.

The last couple of times we have gone, the service has just been completely lacking, and even though the hibachi is fun once in awhile, and the food is good, nothing really wows me anymore.  but for some reason I like going back because it \\"feels\\" fancy and like a good date night.\\n\\nThis last time we came however, made me realize I just don't want to go for awhile.  Our food came quickly, and was good, but every time I asked for something I felt like I was bothering the staff (they weren't very busy, we got there early enough to beat the restaurant week crowd).  \\n\\nThey only give you chopsticks, I have to ask for a fork, every. single. time we go.  It would be nice just to have the option since they have so many menu items that would be easier to eat with silverware.\\n\\nThere is NEVER enough ice in their drinks.  There is none in the water, and if you order a cocktail, they put like 1 or 2 cubes that basically melt by the time it gets to you so you get a watered down, warmish drink, every time.  Last time we went I actually asked for extra ice, because we wanted to stay and just enjoy our cocktails after we ate.\\n\\nThe final straw was last night though, when the waiter was cleaning our plates from the table and knocked over a full cup of sake.  We had purchased a bottle for the two of us and only had a couple sips left.  Instead of remedying the situation, or offering even just another shot to replace what he had wiped out, he got super flustered and muttered \\"oh sorry,\\" and grabbed one extra napkin and threw it on the table.

The last time we were there was a warning shot, but yesterday's experience was the final blow.  I was craving the cheesy grits so we went for breakfast yesterday. It was surprisingly busy for 10 a.m. on a Thursday. The server seemed sleepily startled to see us and completely ill-prepared to cope with the number of people in the room (about 8 customers). We ordered our food.  Eventually the cook brought the plates out. I could see immediately that the grits were old, dry, definitely not cheesy. I took a bite - they were inedible.  They were nasty.  I ate the biscuit I got on the side and my partner ate some of his southwest bowl, which was just \\"OK.\\" The server eventually came within 4 feet of the table and asked \\"How is everything\\" while looking at the table next to us.  I couldn't tell if he was looking at us, so I didn't answer and he walked away.  That was the last contact we had w/ him table-side.  He proceeded to do *everything he could to not come near our table* while I sat there with a full plate of food, uneaten, in front of me.  Eventually we wanted to leave and just went to the front counter.  I told him my grits were old, dry and inedible.  He again seemed unsurprised.  I said I wanted them taken off the bill (he didn't offer).  Their credit card machine was down, so we had to pool our cash to pay for my partner's meal and the $3.50 I was charged for one small biscuit (!!!!!!!!!!!!!) which was the only breakfast I got.  Luckily we had enough cash on us - the server told us we were welcome to go get more money but didn't offer to tell us where a cash machine was.

When I entered, I was soon greated and seated at a table. Overall, this decor is pretty spot on as far as recreating the \\"Tiki Bar\\" \\"old Kahiki\\" decor.  This tiny space has a few tables, booths, and a bar, scrunched into about a 1,800 sq. ft. dining area tops, maybe less. Almost every table was occupied. This is the most cramped Elizabeth Lessner bar by far.  Once again I will stress though, cool decor.\\nThe bathroom stalls even had real vinyl and Hawaiian themed records stapled to the walls.  Cool.\\n\\nOur friendly server brought us both drink and food menus.  The drink menu offered a few of the \\"fruity, Polynesian\\" drinks that many Asian restaurants promote.  I chose a Rum and Happiness for $6.  I thought the drink was decent and married nice with the concept.  As the night went on the service appeared to be spotty and slow, with three different people coming to my table, but everyone was friendly.\\n\\nThe food is another story at Grass Skirt.  If you think this is a substitue for Kahiki or a Chinese restaurant, you will be disappointed.   I ordered a Kung Pao lettuce wrap and Spam and Swiss sliders with Chinese mustard, Swiss, carmelized green onions and grilled Spam on King's Hawaiian sweet buns.  My dining partner ordered both the Peanut Noodles with Chicken and Thai Soup.  All the food was between semi OK and disappointing.  I do appreciate the effort and I know the menu and concept is a work in progress.  \\n\\nThe Kung Pao lettuce wraps came on three tiny pieces of Romaine with a bed of sauteed chicken, some spices, vege's, and sesame seeds, but I don't remember any peanuts.  Only $5 but still seemed like a \\"not what I expected\\" appetizer.  The sauce was a brown sauce, but no where near any Asian authenticity.  \\n\\nThe Spam and Swiss mini sandwiches on Hawaiian bread tasted decent but were tiny and seemed overpriced even at $5.  Two mini sandwiches with a very thin slice of Spam.  I will give the Grass Skirt credit though, I tasted every ingredient listed on the menu description including the carmelized green onions and Chinese hot mustard.  The Chinese mustard almost stuck out too much, creating a hot taste to the sweet persuasian that the rest of the mini sandwich had.\\n\\nMy dining partner had the Spicy Peanut Pasta with Chicken and the Soup Thai.  Feedback was that the pasta was decent (appeared to be a still pretty petite portion) $9 and the Soup Thai did not have a very good flavor profile $4.\\n\\nOverall three stars, but a really cool decor.  I generally write my reviews based mostly on the food, which for me was disappointing.  Love the concept, offers a new dimension to the bar crawl of Columbus kitchyness.  Already seems to have become popular, and with an uptick in the food quality, most probably will prove to be a sustainable small hotspot."},{"name":"Rustic Kitchen","address":"210 Stuart St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Went there Friday 10/23/15 - with three people.

I am always disappointed when I hear about how great the sandwiches are someplace only to discover that they are serving the same Boars Head meats I can buy at my local Publix. The bacon on my sandwich was crispy, yes but also thin and flavorless. And the turkey and coleslaw were just supermarket grade stuff - nothing special at all. My husband had the Apple Annie sandwich which had promise in its construction but fell short in execution. The same lack luster bacon added nothing more than extra calories to a sandwich that was stacked with slices of mild apples, and cream cheese. Perhaps a more robust apple variety, paired with some thick smokey bacon like the stuff from Niman Ranch topped with an herbed cream cheese may have pulled this sandwich from flavorless to fabulous. But as it was - not so much. The standout of the meal was the cup of homemade Hungarian beef and cabbage soup. Had I skipped the sandwich and just had a larger bowl of soup I may have been left with a different impression. But at $30 for two very average sandwiches and a small cup of good soup I'm afraid this place will not be a regular for us. Not when there are better, less expensive options out there. If you want creative sandwiches and soups, try Pom Poms and for amazing corned beef and Pastrami on Rye head to Pastavino's in Apopka where Chef/owner Don who once worked at Ronnie's deli, makes his own rye bread, and all baked goods in house.

So, unless you can pack in a LOT of Indian food, if you are on a budget go up the street on 12th, there are a couple of Indian carts there, or better yet go to Ghandis.  \\n\\nThat being said, if you don't mind dropping a ten spot (or more) for lunch, you'll get your fill and won't be disappointed. \\n\\nStaff was very friendly and the place was clean - no real complaints other than the slightly higher cost."},{"name":"Royal China","address":"3295 Chamblee Dunwoody Rd","city":"Chamblee","stars":"3.5","text":"This is my family's fave restaurant in Atlanta.

I loved it. It's hard to find a place like that around Austin.\\n\\nThe Service:\\nThe service was FANTASTIC. I came in a bit early and put my name on the list for a party of 3, however, when they actually called by name, my party members were not here. They kept me on the list even while it started getting packed (wait of 30 min+) and when my party members finally arrived  (30 minutes later...) I got seated immediately. They were more than happy to accommodate us even though it was our fault for not having all party members present. This gave them a HUGE ++ in my books. Other than the initial service, the table service was prompt and we got checked on multiple times throughout our meal. Our food came out super quick and pr interactions with the staff members were all pleasant.\\n\\nThe Food:\\nThe food was on point. The scrambled eggs were not mixed with fillers such as flour like you usually find at other diners, the pancakes were fluffy and tasted fantastic, and the sausage was moist and mouthwatering.\\n\\nIf I am ever in the area again, I will always find a way to come down for breakfast.

Oh no, I'm not falling for this one; been burned too many times before. Expectation level = zero, but I'll go ahead and investigate anyways(you know...for you guys). \\n\\nSouthern Proper is the newest addition to the South End food scene. Like really new....this particular visit being the 2nd day after the grand opening. \\n\\nFirst impression: wow....that door though! Grand indeed. Upon entering, I'm convinced these doors are actually teleportation chambers. Clearly we are now in a ski lodge. If that's the theme they are going for, it worked! The space itself is massive, especially for this part of town. \\n\\nAMBIANCE\\n\\nI'm not entirely sure what to make of it. With the restaurant being so new, it's hard to tell what they will settle into even a month from this point, but for now, the song choice and volume honestly rivals a bar. We could hardly hear the conversation across the table, and that's after we politely asked if the volume could be turned down. Annoying? Yes. Deal breaker? No for me at least. \\n\\nFOOD\\n\\nThe menu at Southern Proper is a pretty broad representation of southern food. This menu features items pretty common to southern restaurants in general. Nothing wrong with that, considering southern food itself can be quite regional. The great thing about large party dining, you get to sample a little bit of everything. \\n\\nHushpuppies- I am not a fan of hushpuppies really. I find most to be on the grainy side. Not here! These are absolutely delicious. These hushpuppies literally melt in your mouth. Is it supposed to do that?! The honey also acts as a perfect balance. My views on hushpuppies have been turned upside down...more like right side up! \\n\\nFried chicken- good, not great. Ordered the 8 piece, and most of the cuts were white meat. I guess it's a personal preference but the dark meat always makes for juicier chicken. The chicken itself was well seasoned and the breading has great crunch. The only real downside is the inconsistency of the fry. Some pieces perfect, while others overdone. \\n\\nSweet potato hoe cakes- 90% of you have no idea what this is...neither do I ! But it's pretty darn good. Kinda sorta pancakes?! Almonds & zucchini shouldn't work, but it somehow does. \\n\\nCatfish and chips- super flaky, light, juicy, piece of breaded fish. Honestly nothing I can say here. Might be the best catfish I've ever had. Now the 'chips', are a different story. Per the menu these are said to be fried potatoes, but I would not have been able to tell if they were fried or baked. Cut entirely too large and not at all crispy. Basically, big potato wedges.\\n\\nChicken liver parfait- there is so much going on in this little jar. Sounds a lot more intimidating than it really is. I don't even recognize half of these ingredients, but who cares, it's absolutely glorious. \\n\\nPimento mac- never been a fan of pimento, but here we go again, I may have become a believer. A nicely done Mac and cheese. The pimento is not overpowering and allows the al dente macaroni to have a little shine. No complaints here. \\n\\nBiscuits- OoommmmGggg.... this is too much. Is it possible that I'm dreaming? My love for biscuits has been well documented. These are bare none the BEST biscuits of my life! This includes any biscuit I've ever had in any southern state. Beside the fact that there has to be one pound of butter in these things, I don't think it's actually possible for a biscuit to be this crispy yet this airy. I'm sitting at this table in deep contemplation: I don't want to start any rumors but are these things fried?! This is reminiscent of a elephant ear at your local carnival...Man oh man, these biscuits probably deserve their own yelp business listing. For what it's worth, the side of butter/balsamic is not at all needed. Now if this came with jam, well I'd pass out in euphoria right there at the dinner table. \\n\\nOk....so.....safe to say I wasn't disappointed. Is it obvious? Actually quite the contrary; this is honestly instantly catapulted into the top two southern spots in Massachusetts as far as I'm concerned. Overall 4.5, rounding down. After a few minor tweaks, easily a 5. All this, and not even 3 days old? We might be on to something here.

I have been here so many times because I have a group of friends who love going. That being said it's an alright time if you go with the right people but I do not understand the appeal. Landsdowne is in the heart of Fenway and draws a large college and young professional crowd as well as an influx of tourists. The lines to get in after 10:00 PM can be suicidally long but that being said it's not long for no reason like many clubs do. Landsdowne is nearly 100% of the time packed to the brim with no breathing space. It can get infernally hot due to the multitudes of people. Yes, the divey scene works and one will not be unhappy with the multitudes of people who are always there. The lowest part of Landsdowne is the music. It has a live band on Friday and Saturday nights! One would think they were gearing towards the Baby Boomers who still listen to nothing but the Beatles as opposed to the college crowd. At parts during the night a DJ does spin for a bit and is very good when he does spin. Music is one of the chief factors for me and if the live music was replaced with a DJ, I would like the place better, other than that I will continue to go here with the friends of mine who thoroughly enjoy the populated and popular scene."},{"name":"Vinito Ristorante","address":"4971 International Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3","text":"First day on a Florida vacation and the family insisted on a shopping day so we ended up at the outlet mall.

You start by choosing a wrap, mixed greens, or brown rice (or a mixture of the latter two), then your protein (chicken, shrimp, portabella, or avocado), then one of the six gusto! sauces/toppings. Each of us had decided which topping we wanted prior to our arrival, but immediately chose the special -- jerk ginger pineapple -- once we saw it was available. Husband had his on rice with a double portion of chicken, while I had a mixture of greens and rice with chicken plus a fresh limeade to top it all off. Every order also comes with sweet potato chips, which I believe are made in house. The food was light and not heavy on the palate or our stomachs, but something was lacking for me. It may have just been that I was really excited to try it out and had expectations that were a little too high. But all in all, the food was ready fast, and was flavorful and fresh, and the staff members were friendly and personable.

Burgers with gluten-free buns, appetizers, chicken wings, salads. It was nice to have such a wide selection for a change. They also don't charge you an extra $1 for the gluten-free bun, like so many other places do. Major kudos for keeping the burger prices the same on both menus. Loved the house made ginger ale and root beer too, delish.\\n\\nWish they had a few more gluten-free choices for drinks. I've read reviews here that mention a gluten-free beer. I didn't see one listed on the regular beer menu or on the gluten-free menu, though I may have missed it. They only offer one hard cider, and it's in a wine-sized bottle.\\n\\nSo here's why I gave only 3 stars: \\n\\nWhen I ordered, I prefaced my order by saying, \\"I'd like to order this off of the gluten-free menu.\\" I ordered the garlic burger with sweet potato fries, and I thought I was safe. I took my first few bites, and I thought the bun was awfully soft and spongy for being gluten-free. I then realized it looked just like the regular burger bun and I got suspicious. I asked the server about it, and he realized he'd forgotten to write down \\"gluten free\\" on the order pad! He quickly changed my plate and my burger was replaced with a square-shaped bun and new fries. He then let me know, \\"By the way, the mustard isn't gluten-free.\\" Great, after I'd polished off my first batch of fries dipping them in both mustard and ketchup. Thanks for not telling me in advance.\\n\\nYou'd think with the special gluten-free menu, the servers would be more aware. Something like that can be disastrous for some people who are extremely gluten-intolerant. They were lucky I'm not quite as intolerant as some are, though I'm feeling some mild ill-effects today.\\n\\nSo if you order at Deschutes in the future and you need to stay away from gluten: stay away from the mustard out on the table, and make sure your burger comes with a square-shaped bun! Just in case your server does not forewarn you.\\n\\nHey, I know we all make mistakes; some mistakes are just a bit more costly than others. I will give Deschutes another try sometime in the future, now that I know what to watch for. When my tummy feels better. And when I'm feeling brave."},{"name":"Banger's Sausage House & Beer Garden","address":"79 81 & 81.5 Rainey St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Hard to get parking so we Uber-d, when Uber was a thing in Austin.

Woefully inadequate parking, forcing you to valet park your car most of the time.  This is particularly annoying as you hand over your tip to the valet, only to watch him walk five feet to your car and drive it over to you.  It's just lame to reserve 99% of your parking lot for valet parking.\\n\\n2.  Long waits.  I usually end up going here on weekends, so it makes sense that it would be busy, but it can be a bummer to kill 40 minutes waiting for a table when you're starving.\\n\\n3.  Mediocre service.  I've had some great wait people here, and some not-so-great wait people.  However, the hostesses I've encountered here seem strangely snobby.  I get this Dallas vibe from them:  \\"uh, what are you doing in my BREW PUB, you non-blonde, non-stick-thin, non-big-boobed interloper?\\"\\n\\n4.  A bit on the pricey side.  Food is good and high quality, but the somewhat casual atmosphere lures you into thinking that it should also be cheaper.  For example, a burger is $9, and they offer entrees up to $22.\\n\\nSo, uh, what do I like about this place?\\n\\n1.  Nice but casual atmosphere.  Hubby can get away with wearing shorts (maybe that's why the hostesses are giving us attitude), which is something he treasures so much that he is *almost* willing to overlook the annoying valet parking situation.  At the same time, it's nice enough that I don't feel like we're eating at some fast food dive (sometimes a girl wants to feel a little pampered).\\n\\n2.  The food.  Everything I've had here is good.  I'm particularly partial to their roasted garlic appetizer.  Three BIG bulbs of roasted garlic, which the wait staff is trained to squeeze out for you so you don't have to sully your hands digging it out of the bulb.  We usually ask them to leave the bulb anyway, though, because there's usually a bunch of yumlicious garlic left in it after it's been squeezed.  \\n\\nSpeaking of garlic, their garlic fries are also delicious. \\n\\n I often get their smoked salmon pizza, which I like, too (in part because it's $10, and being the cheapskate that I am,  it's hard to justify spending twice as much on something else).\\n\\nOK, so the number of \\"likes\\" is fewer than the number of \\"not-to-likes,\\" which is why I opened this review with some self-reflection about why I'm so fond of NXNW.

I was walking by with my mom in January 2007, and one of the owners was sitting outside with a table and a stack of applications. I applied and was called back the next day. We trained for a couple months as they finished the building, and then we opened. I worked here for 11 months, and then left to move to New York once I graduated in December. So as I write this review, I write it both as someone who has seen the inner workings and also as someone who has been a mere customer. While working here, I was highly impressed with the freshness of the food. We would arrive well before the restaurant opened, and would chop all the onions, slice the tomatoes, hand cut and wash the potatoes that were going to be used for fries, pull the lettuce, and weigh out the chop meat, ensuring that everything that was going to be used that day was fresh and prepared that very morning. Nothing got reused the following day, and nothing was frozen. Seven years later, the food is still just as good and fresh as before, but the extreme drive for professionalism and cleanliness is now gone. That first year that they were open, there was an extreme push for everything to be sanitary and spotless. Employees never touched even so much as their apron without trading out their gloves, and it was actually something that was shouted frequently. \\"Change your gloves!\\" was a playful yet serious direction shouted from one employee or group of employees to another employee doing something to compromise the cleanliness of their gloves. All day long, you could hear \\"Change your gloves!\\" Being in there now, this does not seem to be said even infrequently. Last week, I came here three days over the course of a five day period. I witnessed numerous employees adjusting their shirts, fixing their Five Guys hat, or even sweeping, and not changing out their gloves. And no one said a word. A stark contrast from when I worked here. Also, the floors were kept spotless back then, but now are dirty and sticky. The bathrooms used to be inspected on the hour, but now were missing toilet paper and had wet napkins stuck to the walls. \\"Quality control\\" was the position name for the person who handed out food to the customers. He's the guy that yells \\"order 70\\"... Back in the day, we were instructed that if you were on quality control, you smiled at all times, and always looked the person in the eyes as you handed them their food. Now, your order number is yelled out and then your food is placed on the counter, and the quality control guy goes back to where he was, leaving you to pick your food up on your own. Having your food handed to you is a very small thing, but it goes a long way. I understand that people get lax as businesses get older, but back in the day this place seemed almost a pioneer in the fast food industry. Even though it was, technically, fast food, it did not feel like a fast food joint. Now, it feels no different than being inside a McDonald's or Burger King."},{"name":"Texas Chili Parlor","address":"1409 Lavaca St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"This cali girl was in search of heat.

I double checked the receipt, just in case I was the one who made the mistake, but alas, the order was recorded correctly.

Naturally, I was upset and told her I didn't understand why she was trying to charge me money for a mistake that I did not make, and she then handed the phone over to a man, presumably one of the managers or owners there. He assured me that she was just confused and that my order would be ready in 10 minutes. Still no apology for the mixup, and I had to drive back there during rush hour, wasting time and resources to get my meal. I walked in with a smile regardless, and thanked the woman who had taken the order for my meal. Since the food is so delicious, and it's relatively close to home, I didn't want her to feel bad for making a mistake, as I do cross paths with her on occasion when picking up my takeout order. On my way out the door, she mumbled something to me in a language I do not understand, in a tone of voice that did not sound warm and welcoming. \\n\\nNeedless to say, I will be taking my business elsewhere this summer.

The beef was cooked tender with just the right amount of flavor and not so much grease. The proportion of meat to veggie ratio is just perfect.

My first trip, I ordered the 2X2X2, which is 2 eggs, 2 pancakes, and 2 pieces of bacon or sausage.  It was all really good.  The next two times, I ordered the migas.  I'm used to migas being made with soft corn tortilla, but these are made with corn chips.  The surprising thing is that the corn chips are no longer crunchy when the dish is served, but they retain their toasted-corn flavor, so the overall flavor of the dish is exactly what I love about migas!  The migas comes with bacon, hash browns, two tortillas, and fresh ranchero sauce.  The sauce is an awesome complement to the dish.  The tortillas are redundant though; I never eat them.  I'm not a fan of hash browns either, but I eat them because they're there.  I suppose I should investigate substituting some fruit or something in their place.  My partner has ordered the cheeseburger omelette, a hamburger, and the 2X2X2.  So far, the 2X2X2 has been his favorite; he gives big thumbs up to the pancakes.  The cheeseburger omelette was disappointing because the ground beef was seasoned, like a taco, and instead of coming with shredded cheese, it comes with queso, which he asked them to hold.  So there was no cheese on it at all.  They should rename it the taco omelette as it bears very little resemblance to a cheeseburger.  The most disappointing thing we've had at Cafe Java was the hamburger.  The patty lacked any kind of flavor.  It turns out they use pre-formed, frozen patties instead of fresh ground beef.  There are plenty of places to get a fresh hamburger in Austin (Mighty Fine, Five Guys, etc.), so skip that menu choice when dining here.  Cafe Java is definitely about the coffee and the breakfast.  Stick with those, and you should leave satisfied!"},{"name":"Deschutes Brewery Portland Public House","address":"210 NW 11th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I didn't try the food, but the flight that you get is great.

The Blue Nile sign is still outside, but it is now \\"Cafe International\\" per the laserjet printout on the front door. When I called to make reservations, the young gentleman on the phone explained they were no longer Blue Nile, but now Cafe International with the same Ethiopian recipes served in the past. Hmmm. Ok--my sister had a Groupon she recently purchased on my recommendation of her wanting to try Ethiopian food. I continued with my reservation and at the end he asked me if I had a Groupon or restaurant. com certificate, to which I replied, \\"yes.\\" \\"Since we are not Blue Nile, we will not honor the certificate. You can get a refund from the seller,\\" he responds. Damn. Oh well. Let's still give this place a shot.\\n\\nSo, I want you to know that I had never been to the Blue Nile when it was the Blue Nile, but based on the reviews here, service seemed average and the portions hardy. Not so much our experience at Cafe International. The menu was much more abbreviated than I had seen on Blue Nile's website and almost a quarter more in cost.\\n\\nThe staff seemed confused and disoriented, but I guess that was because they were a \\"new\\" restaurant. When we ordered, several of us asked for our entrees to be \\"extra spicy.\\" This didn't seem to be a problem and he jotted down our request. Dinner took about an hour to be served and when it finally came out, all 5 of our meals were dribbled on one piece of injera. This bothered me in 2 ways. The portions were extremely small and we had vegetarians and meat eater dishes side-by-side. Yes, I am very familiar with the Ethiopian \\"family-style\\" way of serving, but this was ridiculous. I've experienced that no more than 4 people's portions grouped and I've never seen meat on the same injera as a vegetable combo. The server explained there had been a mix up in the kitchen and thats why it took so long, also the dishes could not be modified for spiciness. Um. Whatever, at this point we were all starved, but it was upsetting that we spent about $15 a head and received about a 1/3 cup portion each. The food was delicious, albeit mild, but there was not enough. We left hungry. \\n\\nThe only positive thing I can say about Cafe International is that the wine was $3 a glass and bottles of beer were $2. Good deal. Especially to kill time while we waited forever for our entrees and to fill our bellies because the food sure didn't. \\nAs we were paying our bills at the front, the server encouraged us to stop back soon and shared with us that in the future they would be adding on all sorts of cuisine and then rattled of a dozen cultures including Thai, Vietnamese, Costa Rican et al. Wow. They can barely handle the curtailed Ethiopian menu from the previous restaurant.

I was right.\\n\\nI went for lunch today. It was empty as always at around 12:30. I ordered the broiled mackerel appetizer and the chicken teriyaki lunch special. Both were below minimum levels of acceptable. The mackerel was not fresh or crisp, and it was barely hot--on the opposite end of the spectrum from Takemura's excellent broiled mackerel. \\n\\nThe chicken teriyaki lunch box was worse. It deserves its own paragraph, because they packed it with all sorts of food, all of which I left to throw out, except the pickles. The chicken itself was a strange combination of lukewarm and overcooked. Was it overcooked yesterday I wonder? This pre-cooked food theory was furthered by the zucchini tempura, which was cold. After taking my first bite of cold, soggy tempura, I looked at it closely. It was obviously from days past. The batter looked like a decayed scrambled egg. There were other assorted fried foods on the tray that I didn't want, as well as half a crab stick/avocado roll (the best thing on the tray).\\n\\nIf I'm one of three people in the restaurant and my vegetable tempura is cold, I think that says all that needs to be said about this restaurant's low standards.

Even ignoring the prices, the quality is usually quite good.\\nTheir menu is extensive, and can be overwhelming at first, but once you realize that there are three sections, and they're all basically the same items, it makes ordering easier.  You can get each sandwich as a banh mi (meats with Vietnamese vegetables), \\"European-style\\" (same meats, but with lettuce and tomato), or as a croissant (again, same meats, and \\"European\\" vegetables).\\nI've tried almost all of the banh mi varieties, and they range from not good (the \\"Saigon Bacon\\" tasted like sliced pork loin that had been in the refrigerator for about a week to long) to really good (such as the teriyaki chicken and the \\"pork roll with egg\\").\\nThe first night I went, they'd run out of the \\"shredded pork with skin\\", so they gave me a free pastry to make up for it, which was very nice of them.\\nThe boba drinks are not good, at all.  They use Cascade Glacier ice cream in their blended teas, which only dulls down the flavor you'd otherwise get.  They were out of custard, and the tapioca pearls were undercooked and hard.\\nOne more thing...if you don't like cilantro, be sure to tell them as they load each sandwich with lots of cilantro."},{"name":"Golden Krust Caribbean Restaurant","address":"5510 W Colonial Dr, Ste 107","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"Oohkay.....so I wanted Jamaican I've been wanting it for a couple of days now so my uncle took me to this place.

Being that I'd never been there before I was a little hesitant with ordering. I wanted the jerk chicken plate and BBQ wings. Well the cashier was a little impatient, pushy, and snappy! I didn't appreciate that..when I asked for the jerk chicken she responded with we don't have chicken you mean wings but the menu clearly said chicken! Then once she fixed the plate she rung it up and gave me my total without even asking if I'd like anything else.

They also have some unusual ingredients to try in your pot - there's an additional charge for multiple pots so dividing is a more economical option.\\n\\nThe basic option is $18.95 per person all you can eat (minimum 2 people) or $20.95 for one person. They have four different styles of broth: Spicy/Nutrition, Spicy, Nutrition and Plain (the latter is just water I'm thinking).

I would have asked the waitress to do something about the fries but she was never around which is something because they have gobs of staff on, but I am not sure what they are all doing. They must have small sections and seem very inexperienced. Second visit was just for drinks at the bar. No one seemed to know what the \\"craft beer of the month\\" was (I was sitting right by the waitress station at the bar and heard all the conversation). I would think if it is your special for the month, everyone including the bartender should know what it is. Second issue was the short pours on the beer. I thought maybe it was just mine, but almost every beer sent out was short. One waitress asked the bartender about one sleeve she was about to take out (It had settled after waiting on the bar for a while) his advice was just to \\"stir it up bit\\".

Ignore it, that's what.\\n\\nIn the interest of complete disclosure, I will admit that my husband sometimes complains about the food selection and prices here, so I guess it's not universally appealing...though he does like to read the poem on the wall about Tolstoy's nagging wife, and then shoot me significant glances.  Also, the layout might be a bit tight for people in wheelchairs to navigate, though I don't think it's actually obstructive.\\n\\nOverall, Bukowski's is a great place to go for lunch, dinner, or drinks any day of the week and a fantastic neighborhood hang-out."},{"name":"Ball Square Cafe","address":"708 Broadway","city":"Somerville","stars":"4.5","text":"This is the breakfast place that every other breakfast place wishes it could be. The food is amazing, sure, but a lot of spots have good, hearty, well-made food. The service is what sets Ball Square apart. To be greeted like an old friend from the moment you step into the cafe is something that's kind of remarkable in the Boston area in 2014, but it doesn't end there. Every person who works here is awesome. I'm not sure how that happens, but seriously, what an amazing crew. Jason and Matt are my two favorite servers for selfish reasons (they're as lovely to look at as they are to talk to - SORRY, just being honest, here) and they always make me feel like the only customer in the cafe. Everybody is so unbelievably friendly and sweet, and it obviously comes down from the top, because Mike is just an absolute doll. He's funny, he's ridiculously hardworking, and he deserves all the success in the world for the business he runs. I can't even describe how much I love Ball Square Cafe.

Waiting in line in the cold isn't that bad because they have heaters above to keep you warm. I ordered the the Broadway Blues, and would definitely recommend this! It comes with: blueberry muffin, a cheddar cheese omelette, bacon, and either their famous home fries or diced potatoes. Their home fries are a must, as this is the only place I've seen that does grilled mashed potatoes. Their grilled mashed potatoes is well seasoned and really flavorful. Definitely a must if you come here! To make things more efficient, their drinks are all self served. So you go up to the bar and grab your own coffee, tea, orange juice, water and other drinks.

Since the Italian is actually from Milano, Italy, we know a guy who knows a guy and that's how we got in. We sat at the table closest to the oven and were introduced to Genarro, the certified pizzaiolo imported from Naples. Really nice guy and really humble. Before I go any further I just want to say that there is no comparing this Napoli style pizza to Apizza Scholls. I'm sorry, there just isn't. Apizza Scholls is NOT Napoli style pizza, it's Portland style pizza. I wrote a review for that place, read it and that's only part of the reason. You can have pizza in Roma and it's not the same style as pizza from Napoli. The pizza we had was excellent, just like in Napoli. We make pizza at home regularly so we are sticklers for good dough and this guy knows what he's doing. He's a certified pizzaiolo. I highly recommend the Margherita D.O.C. The Mozzarella di Bufala is excellent, yes, it's a little spendy but treat yourself, you're worth it. Crust was thinish, slightly crispy on the sides. Very well made and the sauce is excellent. We also had the special priviledge of having a Pizza Bianca. It's a white pizza with just Mozzarella di Bufala and olive oil. Simple but so delicious as the ingredients they use are what makes the difference. Good quality olive oil and fresh Mozzarella di Bufala. It's not on the menu but maybe you can request it. The salume or cold cuts are also brought in from Italy and are of the best quality, sliced fresh right there for you. To end our meal we had the Mezza Luna Nutella. Now, I am a Nutella fanatic. Even had some of my recipes featured on the World Nutella Day website so I was skeptical but again, Gennaro hit it out of the ball park. Perfect balance of sweet and savory between the crust and the ricotta nutella filling. Melt in your mouth good. The atmosphere is intimate, candlelit and very old world Italian. It's not Pizza Hut or Apizza Scholls and it's not trying to be. It's Via Tribunali, named after the street in Napoli made famous for it's pizzerias. Do yourself a favor and go give this place a try. It's the next best thing to actually being on Via Tribunali. Si mangia molto bene in Via Tribunali con Gennaro!

Inside me I was like criss what? And did I just hear IHOP? Ok, not wanting to be the party pooper, I like okay yeah let's go. After all, I can yelp about IHOP later. \\n\\nWhen we entered, I was like oh :O The place was packed and there was like a dozen of people waiting for their tables. Splendid! :(\\n\\nWe were told by the hostess the wait would be like 15-20 mins. Awesome! :(\\n\\nAfter less than 5 mins sitting on a bench outside IHOP, the hostess came and called us. That was quite surprising cos there were four of us. \\n\\nWe got to our table, and the boys seemed to be really excited. Our server came and introduced herself. She was very cheery and nice, and I like that very much. I flipped through the menu many times. In general when I hear the word \\"IHOP\\", a few words automatically come to my mind. They are  \\"pancakes\\", \\"breakfast\\", \\"greasy\\" and \\"unhealthy\\".\\n\\nSo in the end what did I order? Fried chicken under the Dinner section, LOL!! It was at the very last second that I said I wanted to order the fried chicken. The server jokingly said she would come back and checked to make sure I would finish the food. I said I would try ;) \\n\\nI had also ordered an orange juice, perhaps I could cleanse my system by drinking the juice after the fried chicken (hopefully!)\\n\\nIt was brunch time and it should be fine even though I kind of regret it. I did not know the menu stated four pieces of chicken until I ordered it. When the food came, I went *phew*! The chicken pieces were not that humongous. I started cutting the chicken when I realized I should take a picture and post it here.\\n\\nOne of the boys said \\"IHOP is famous for greasy food\\" (that's reassuring! :( ), the chicken should be good.\\n\\nSo was the fried chicken any good? No, not really. It was fine on the outside, but the inside has not much flavor. I definitely had better fried chicken elsewhere. \\n\\nKimberly came back to check on us a few times. She definitely deserved the good tips from us.\\n\\nAfter we left, my clothing and hair smell so so awful :O So let me summed up my brunch experience in IHOP.\\n\\nService by our server Kimberly - definitely 5 stars\\n\\nFood - 2 stars (it wasn't awful but there was definitely room for improvement)\\n\\nAmbience (since the food is mediocre, I have to rate the environment) - 1 star (Did I also mention the place was extremely noisy??) \\n\\nI averaged the above, it would be 2.67 and hence I rounded it to a 3 then.

The Italian Spring Rolls were very good, but it was all down hill from there. \\n\\nUnfortunately, the stuffed lobster tails were disappointing -- I couldn't detect any crab in the \\"lump crab meat stuffing\\". The whole thing was a ultra-creamy, buttery pile of mush with the creamed corn and potato cake.\\n\\nNow, here's where this place really turned south. Quite apparently, the restaurant doesn't enjoy coupons. In fact, they went out of there way to refuse the perfectly valid online certificate that we offered while requesting the check. Apparently the certificate didn't display a tracking number -- that's not my fault. It was a straight, complete print-out of the official online certificate after it was paid for. \\n\\nEven after assuring the server that it was a legit, original, unaltered print-out, she and the hiding-behind-the-curtain manager, refused again and again to accept the certificate.

After pleading and offering to call the online coupon retailer (nobody answered), and using all sorts of logic and reasoning, the server -- or the ghost manager communicating through our server -- finally offered to let us go home, find the tracking number, call back before they close, and get a refund for the certificate amount. And I did just that.\\n\\nWhat a hassle. What an embarrassing ordeal in the restaurant. What a horrible taste it leaves in your mouth after walking out. What a terrible customer experience. Honestly, this is supposed to be a slightly upscale restaurant and they give you McDonald's-level service? Are you kidding?

Luckily, I'm not an actual vegetarian; I just don't really like to eat meat, but this was fine (however, FYI if you are actually opposed to meat). I really enjoyed the different flavors and the fusion reminded me a little bit of one of my favorite places, Cafe Yumm. My husband enjoyed his teriyaki, but was definitely ready for dessert, so we ordered the creme brulee cheesecake. Unfortunately, they'd run out, so we tried the matcha chocolate brownie instead. It was delightful.

On a positive note the wait staff has alwyas been attentative but the shortcomings lay in the kitchen.  The first time I went with coworkers on lunch and the place was 1/4 full and the food for three people took so long that before we said anything the manager came to our table and appologized for the extremely long wait.  He gave us 15% off our bill for such a long wait.  Tonight the problem was not with the time that we recieved the food it was with the quality of the food.  I ordered chicken nacohos with no sour cream and they were the most disgusting nachos I have ever had.  When I first received the nachos there was little to no chicken nor queso.  For close to S12.00 you would expext more chicken and generous portion of queso.  This was not the case.  After asking my waiter for more queso he brought my nachos back and they were smothered.  The dish went from one extreme to the next.   It was as if  the kitchen staff got angry and purposely put too much queso on my chicken nachos that had very little chicken.   Not to mention the tortilla chips themselves were disgusting leaving a very bad after taste.  My food was so bad that I was angry leaving with a feeling like I was ripped off and disatified with my meal.

I'd buy a whole pie and take it home if I could.  \\n\\nAs for the service, it was pretty friendly and fair.  I do wish my waitress was a tad quicker in topping off my drink without having to ask, but I can be forgiving if the place is really busy. Other than that my experience overall was A+!!  Joy Caf√©, in my humble opinion lived up to the hype!   Everything just tastes fresh, and you can tell the food is made with love!!

The service was terrible. Our server, who seemed to be the only one there, was more preoccupied with his cell phone conversations than actually taking care of us. We were the only patrons in the restaurant when we first came in, so how hard could it be? I had to ask for my drink several times before it finally came in the middle of my meal. It also took him several minutes after we came in before he put his phone down long enough to take the order. I had read great things about the country fried steak, the bbq, and mac and cheese, and I have to say, I found the food to be pretty awful.

The space is huge (for a downtown meeting place), it's on the bus line (not so great for parking, but when you meet a group for HH, what do you expect. It's downtown; get used to it), it has decent food (better than just typical bar food), and the drinks are great!\\n\\nI've been here only twice so far. The first time was fine. I say 'fine' because it wasn't a bad experience. It left a taste in my mouth wanting to come back to experience more. So, that's a good thing. I had a drink with a friend, it was good, the customer service was pretty good, so therefore I thought I'd give it a try again. \\n\\nThe next time I went I met a group of people instead of going to the next level... you know what I'm talking about: first you meet for drinks, then you meet for dinner (or a full meal of your choosing), and THEN after you've had a few meals you might move on to the next level by meeting with a group of your close friends. Well, I seemed to have forgotten about restaurant foreplay cuz I just went straight to the next level. \\n\\nThe upstairs lounge was closed off for service (and we were warned of this in the beginning of our arrival). No service available upstairs... yeah, we get it. We took a chance. Well, the restaurant/bar was very busy the night we all met up. Of course how are we supposed to know what is busy for them on a Friday night? There was space enough for us downstairs but figured it wouldn't be any big deal to just pop down to the bar to get our own food and drinks. \\n\\nWell, as everyone in our group is taking care of themselves by going to the bar (as directed) my friends were told to go to the END of the bar (by someone who worked there) to place our orders. Ok, so... we did. We all (in small groups of four or less) went to the end of the bar to make our orders. Needless to say the place we were told to go was also the pickup station for staff. Great. So here we are, trying to make our orders, and staff is telling (not asking) us to get out of the way. \\n\\nSuper. That sucked. That... really sucked actually... that was really rude. \\n\\nDid we complain? No. We just went about our business. Word got back to the shift manager and he personally came up stairs to apologize to us for their behavior. I really felt like he was very sincere. I explained to him that next time we wanted to go there we would call ahead. It's just that we didn't know so many people were gonna show up. But the fact that he came up and tried to save potential business is why I want to go back. \\n\\nThe Original. Expensive but good food, nice staff (when they aren't TOOOO busy), not so nice when they are too busy. I would love to give them the benefit of the doubt by going back, because I'm pretty darned certain it's going to be a great experience. I haven't been there since last summer.

For example, it was the first day they got a liquor license so the waitress couldn't tell us any of the beers they had on top b/c they just got them in (she had to get someone else to come over and go through the list with us). Service was also a little disorganized b/c there was no sign when you first enter that says \\"please seat yourself\\" so we watched group after group enter, see the tables, pause near the door waiting to be seated since it seemed like formal seating just to have a waitress or someone finally notice and say \\"please seat yourself.\\" I don't know if they have a sign now that most restaurants say where you can flip between seat yourself or please wait to be seated but that would definitely help.\\n\\nService was also a little slow but again I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt that it's just early hiccups and trying to figure out process, pace, etc. The reason for the 4 stars is b/c their chicken was SOOOO good. We liked that it was a little spicy and the sides were all delicious (mac & cheese, baked beans, cole slaw). The fried green tomatoes were a little disappointing b/c you only got 4 and they were just ok but nice to see it on the menu.

I tend to go out for sushi when other people have a hankering, and I always get the Philadelphia roll, which is pretty much cheating because it's an inside out roll with smoked salmon and cream cheese. Well, anyway, this Philadelphia roll was good. I also had steamed vegetable gyoza because I just love those little dumplings.  Prices were reasonable. \\n\\nWhere Osaka tends to veer off track is their service and atmosphere. The service seemed friendly enough, albeit, overattentive. Eventually, however, the multiple staff people that were coming over to our table to clear, take additional drink orders or ask how everything was seemed confused and/or annoyed that we weren't \\"moving along\\" as they say. Neither I nor my friend had finished our second glasses of wine and they kept asking us if we were finished. At some point, they just brought the check, which was a clear indication they wanted us out. \\n\\nThe downstairs lounge brings in a slew of 20 something women scantily clad for scorpion bowls.

This isn't because of obligation or compensation - Orlando is just that reliable for great service and quality establishments. It's a challenge to find an experience that genuinely leaves me regretful, but it has happened at McFadden's. In fact, it's happened twice. \\n \\nI'm not a picky person, and I'm also not a difficult one - especially when it comes to dining. Of all the people I've ever been out to eat with, I find that I complain less than most, and I don't pose problems in my ordering or have extreme standards. Quite simply... I just want what I paid for. Even when it's not quite right, I never really send it back. After all, we all know that's just asking for trouble. Bottom line is, if I wasn't ridiculously hungry tonight, I would have never eaten what was served to me at McFadden's. \\n \\nMcFadden's is a nice looking place. It's roomy and open, and the overall set up is appealing. That's really where the \\"good\\" ends. We ordered advertised \\"Margherita\\" shots, and their \\"Electric Blue Lemonade\\" drink. They somehow were out of Margherita, which really should be a staple at any bar. I mean... could you be out of tequila... triple sec... seriously? We settled for \\"Rum Punch\\" shots, which were warm and tasted like dish water. The Electric Blue Lemonade was very watery as well, but at least it was cold. \\n \\nBeing an Irish-themed establishment, it was rather surprising that the only things Irish on the menu were Shepherd's Pie and Corned Beef and Cabbage. We ordered Corned Beef and Cabbage and a Black Jack Burger. The wait was quite excessive for our food, and frankly, it wasn't worth it. \\n \\nEveryone knows that Corned Beef and Cabbage is served with mustard. This is a simplistic staple in Irish cuisine. Not at McFadden's! We had to request it, and we were greeted with extreme curiosity by both servers we asked... \\"Mustard???\\", they verified, in disbelief. I ordered my burger cooked medium, but it was most certainly well done and charred to a distasteful crisp. And that chipotle mayo that was advertised? It simply wasn't there. The server insisted it must be in there, but if I can't find it without a magnifying glass, I have trouble believing I would taste it. \\n \\nLet's not even discuss the prices! Suffice it to say, if I pay $15 for a burger, it should be one hell of a burger. Our total bill was $46, and those horrid shots were free, so you do the math. Disgraceful! Thankfully, I had a $15 off coupon from a previous luncheon. Even then, it wasn't worth it.\\n \\nSpeaking of that luncheon... my first experience at McFadden's was no better than the second. I went as part of a business luncheon, and I was very much looking forward to checking out this new establishment. Epic fail on that one. Out of our medium-sized group, two people didn't get served until everyone else was practically done eating. It was a limited menu due to the luncheon setup, but the options were reasonable - until they came out. Sandwiches were to come with soup according to the menu, and they did not. All meals were to come with french fries. I saw three different styles of fries served (odd), and those two \\"late\\" meals were served with tater tots instead, which neither of the diners served wanted. Dessert wasn't even served until most of the group had left (assuming it wasn't coming). I saw it coming out as I was leaving, and upon seeing it, it certainly wasn't worth returning to my seat for it. \\n \\nGuests of this luncheon were still groaning over their disappointment weeks later. It was truly just inexcusably bad. Even still, I gave them the benefit of the doubt and returned to try again. I regret that whole-heartedly. Service is slow and unenthusiastic. Even the restrooms are pathetically unkempt and in need of both repair and cleaning. I simply cannot find a redeeming quality to highlight when it comes to the McFadden's experience. It's no wonder that they heavily push an hour of free drinks every Friday night. They need some sort of redemption to lure return visits. I'm not even sure that's enough to entice me to return. It's really the first place I've eaten in the area that I cannot respectfully recommend, and trust me... it takes a multitude of errors and disappointments to get me to this point. I feel strongly enough about this opinion that I felt an obligation to share my experience and urge our readers to avoid McFadden's at all costs. Yes, it really is that bad. \\n \\nAs a P.S., this is by no means a family-friendly establishment. If you do decide to eat here and you have guests under 18 in your party, you have only a four hour window to take advantage of. They open at 4PM, and at 8PM it reverts to 18 and over only. Not the wisest move in the heart of Orlando's tourist district!"},{"name":"India House","address":"1038 SW Morrison St","city":"Portland","stars":"3","text":"I won't be back.

I don't live in Southie, but my date does and this place was right around the corner from his house.  First off, our waitress was great.  She was a pretty blond, I didn't catch her name, but she was just the right amount of attentive.  I ordered nachos and she suggested I get the 1/2 order because the full size is quite large.  She was totally right, it was plenty, and it saved me like $4 and from having extra wasted food on my plate.  Then I asked what tynga was.  Apparently it's shredded meat--either chicken or pork--seasoned with some Mexican spices.  I went with the chicken as the waitress recommended it (I believe her words were \\"Good choice girl\\") and it was great.  Did I tell you how much I liked the waitress?  She had a little Southie in her, a tiny accent, but not so much as to be trashy.  Then I got the Sangria.  Only $6 a pop, and it was a good sized glass.  It tasted like it had cinammon in it.  Very different, but I liked it a lot!  I got 2!  My only complaint is that there was no AC and it was a 90 degree day out.  We were seated next to an open window but there just wasn't any breeze.  That is my ONLY complaint, as the rest of the experience was awesome.  I liked my date too though, so maybe that sweetened the deal for Salsa's.  I'd definitely come back.

This is definitely in the same vein as the Stone restaurants in San Diego (but with a much better location).

The pretzel and sunchoke dip were pretty delicious though and definitely well worth the visit. If I wasn't flying back with a carryon bag, I would have picked up some Deschutes swag (those growlers are really cool!). It's a shame that we don't get too many Deschutes beers down in SoCal, it can be hard to find more than a couple core offerings.

It is limited space that tables and chairs occupy most of the space. It has limited space to walk. Not quite comfortable though. \\n\\nTwo servers and two chefs worked at this restaurant. The servers were older people. Their service was okay but I felt a bit rude. When I sat down, I had not even looked at the menu yet. One of the two servers asked what I wanted to eat. She didn't even give me time to look at the menu. Then she gave me a little bit of time and walked away. After a minute, I had not even made up my mind and she came back and asked what I wanted to order. My friend just said I should order the braised pork with noodles and lettuce. I trusted her as she had lunch here before. After I ordered, the server grabbed the menu right away. I was looking at the drinks menu, so she didn't take it away. But after a minute, she asked if I would order drinks. I said later and then she grabbed the drinks menu immediately and gave it to other customers at another table. \\n\\nThe braised pork with noodles and lettuce was just okay. The texture of the noodles was actually good but the pork was too chewy that it should be braised or cooked longer. The soup base had way too much sesame oil, so my lips or mouth were always full of oil. LOL I had to use napkins to wipe my mouth very often.  My friend said her Chinese dumplings with noodles was okay. I didn't try it, but by looking at her dish, it was not bad. \\n\\nWhen we paid the bill, we had to pay extra attention! The restaurant had added 10% tip to the bill already. If some customers did not pay attention, they would have added 10% tip to the bill, but indeed the restaurant added the tip to the bill already. \\n\\nTheir prices were not cheap comparing other Taiwanese restaurants.

This place could be so great--the open garage doors along the front in the summer, the collection of booths, high-tops and the bar, the very solid beer list and pretty good menu. But it messes almost everything up, and it almost always has to do with unreasonably high prices and rude staff.\\n\\nThe room is great--dimly lit with booths in the center of the space and high-tops in the front. But the music is always blasting in a room that would be loud already from conversation. I like music and human voices in a bar, but when I have to shout for the person next to me to hear, there's really not much point in going out to a bar. On quiet evenings in the summer, when you can seat by the windows, it's great. Otherwise, the noise level ruins any chance at having a conversation over your beers.\\n\\nSome (maybe even most) of the servers are friendly, but some are incredibly rude, unknowledgeable about beer and simply full of themselves. Last night, our server stood waiting for me to finish my beer, so he wouldn't have to come back to pick up another empty glass the next time he passed by. Well, tough shit. I just paid $7.50 (plus tax) for a 12 oz glass (full to maybe 10 ounces) of beer that elsewhere would be $6 for a pint; I'm not rushing so you can save five seconds.\\n\\nThe beer list here is often very good, but rarely astounding. I take that back, the prices are always astounding. Last night, not a single beer (Harpoon IPA and PBR excepted) was under $7. And most of those came in 12 oz glasses (or smaller), with the at least honest qualifier that that is the glass, not the pour size. Add to that that when the bill came, I remembered that unlike most bars, the price at Bukowski's doesn't include tax. So the bill for five beers last night came to over $40. That's insane! An otherwise good tap list with nothing reasonably priced can't be described as above-average.\\n\\nAnd it's a similar story with the food. $10 for onion rings? Are you kidding me? The food is fairly (and in some cases very) good, but for the prices, like the beer, it's unreasonable. And I don't mind when local businesses are cash only--I don't want my and their hard-earned money going to Visa--but when Bukowski's is charging upwards of $7.50 for a 10 oz pour, they can eat the credit card fees.\\n\\nI want so badly to like this place, and I understand that Boston is an expensive area--I pay rent here, too. But when I can consistently get the same beer--sometimes in a larger serving--for $1-2 at other, nicer bars where I can have a conversation, there's really no excuse for Bukowski's absurd prices."},{"name":"Jack Allen's Kitchen Oak Hill","address":"7720 Hwy 71 W","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"We were greatly looking forward to a trip down south to the Natural Gardener and a quick lunch at Jack Allen's Kitchen.

Initially I was afraid of coming here given some overall really bad reviews but decided to give it a try (there are not a lot of restaurants open Sunday night btw). This place turned out better than what I imagined, but Im still giving it 3 stars. Why? \\nFirst, as some previous review mention this place needs some work done, looks old and chairs do need to be changed. Second, they took close to an hour to have our food ready (and the place had probably 2 more groups), so I couldn't figure out why the delay. The garden salad took like 30 minutes to come and is just as simple as putting the ingredients together! Not sure if this is due to one person serving or maybe only one person cooking? They do need to work on this as well. \\nNow, talking about more happy things the food is indeed good and 100% vegan which makes it easy for me to choose whatever I want from the menu. I had the barbecue tofu (the sauce is really good), corn and sweet potatoes, a friend of mine got the barbecue cauliflower, sweet potatoes as well and mac n' cheese. We were all really happy with our food and left the plate quite clean (portion and flavor right). But, here comes by third complaint... they had run out of collard greens and cornbread, which southern places doesn't have this basic staples? \\nI would definitively come back for the food, but might order to go.

The pricing is a little high, but they certainly do not skimp. When I was a vegetarian, I fell in love with their potato pancakes, having them with apple sauce. The placemat that spells out the restaurant's particular quirks (such as not automatically offering pickles and cole slaw if your order eggs, though we ask for it anyway...) adds to the charm in addition to the decor that is full of... eccentric words. The half-sours and lightly flavored coleslaw that come with the meals is wonderful and made me finally *enjoy* pickles. This is one of the few places that embrace selling celery soda. My dear friend who came here ordered the turkey latke stuffer with stuffing in addition and it was divine. I usually order whatever the dinner special is, which is typically an extreme bargain where they bundle it with soup/salad. The cakes here are good, in particular the strawberry cheesecake. The openness in the selection of breads and fixings is nice, though I wish there was a way to pick omelettes without nickel and diming. The selection of non-food items is interesting... particularly the info cards for Mah Jongg. The sandwiches for lunch seem a bit steeper in price than the breakfast for what is offered, though. The pricing is a little high to come here too often, but the portions are good, the staff is friendly, and the atmosphere is warm. The lines can get a bit long and they seat only when your full party is about. We try to hit it up before the rush on the weekends at about 10:30.

I was really hoping at least for a bread basket as inventive as the one at Abe & Louie's, but no, just small cold white bread rolls. As a restaurant, it's not amazing, it's just okay. The average diner seemed to be about 60 years old too and a little snobby, so it might work well for that kind of clientele.

My mom and I made the trek to IKEA from several hours away and wanted somewhere really good to eat afterwards.  This place was just the ticket!  It's a small shop in Stoughton and is quite unassuming from the outside, and has just a few tables on the inside.  The owner greeted us when we came in and suggested a few picks from the menu when we didn't know what to order.  We got way too much food for two people but it was all fantastic, and we feasted on leftovers the next day.  The lamb kabob is excellent, and came with two very different kinds of rice, one of which has a great tomato flavor.  You must get the hummus, it has a coarse texture and rich flavor.  The salads are fresh and the owner makes the dressing himself - it's vinegary and very clean tasting.  There's a variety of Turkish drinks in the cooler, and the deserts are awesome.  I recommend the rice pudding.  Prices are reasonable and the owner clearly has a loyal following, as a woman came in while we were eating and ordered takeout while remarking to us that she usually ate there once a week."},{"name":"Anh Hong","address":"291 Adams St","city":"Dorchester","stars":"4","text":"Eh.

I wrote the original review in 2012.

BUT...kudos to management for listening to patrons and for being sensitive to this policy. They allow dogs again and their policy for allowing them is stricter -- and it should be. When I came back after my 6 month (painful) hiatus I got hugs! I love this place. I love, love, love this place! Now, if I could only get them to add fried pickles (the ones they serve on Tuesdays as an experiment right now), that'd be over the top for me. Oh wait!

The pulled chicken in there along with a mixture of beans and other toppings gives you the option to make little nacho size tacos 5.) Barbacoa Stackers (these things are like a tostada. Crispy & delish)\\nMy favorite burger out of 3 I've tried so far is the Green Chile Cheese. Its very different from any burger Ive had.

The miso soup was cold and the small side salad had a ton of water that could see after eating the lettuce.\\n\\nThe drink and fried ice cream were good...I actually recommend the fried ice cream!"},{"name":"Starlite Diner & Lounge","address":"1750 29th St, Ste 1064","city":"Boulder","stars":"2.5","text":"I recently came back to boulder and saw that a new place had taken over for where the old Rubys used to be.

I went with my bf for a mid-week date and when we arrived before 7 for our 7:30 reservation they were able to seat us right away. We got started with a grilled cheese/potato something and then had a giant beef rib with saurkraut and little yummy puffs made out of (I think??) corn. I also had a blackberry mint white wine punch, which is why I'm not quite sure what the sides were. It doesn't matter, they were good. I'm fairly sure that the phrase \\"Holy cow\\" was invented for this beef rib. Not only is it grand in size, it is just freaking delicious. How can you char something so perfectly, Dai Due kitchen?! HOW!? Also, our server Rachel was so nice. Shout out to you, Rachel, for being perfect. So friendly, but not overbearing. Our water glasses were never empty, and no question went unanswered. Love it.\\n\\nOn our way out we stopped at the butcher counter and got some ham, beef, and chicken pate. All delicious, and the woman helping us didn't even get mad at me when I asked where their boar comes from--I'm very scared of border-boar.

From personal experience in the restaurant industry I can tell you that many Chefs and Cons are STRESSED when they're cooking (and some - like all professions - are just dicks). He was calm and you could tell he slowed down and took the time be at our pace versus his kitchen pace. This is a mark of true kindness and awareness in a good human being. We talked about the good and a little about the prep and how we feel the food at the Original is different and better than other restaurants,.

I'm an fan because I think it may be the best restaurant I have been to at Progress Ridge area in terms of service and food, so it gets an extra .5-.75 star for that alone.\\n\\nThe positives:\\n\\nSERVICE: Our waitress was awesome. She was not the best waitress I have ever had in terms of attention but whenever I saw her she was hustling and she always filled up my water glass as soon as it was empty. She also smiled and seemed happy to be there. She also updated us on our food and did not leave us hanging, I have had WAY worse service in nicer restaurants in Portland.\\n\\nFOOD: The hibachi chicken, gyoza, Boston roll, and Fantasy roll were all delicious. Our party of three certainly enjoyed all of them! The fish in the sushi did not smell fishy and was melt in your mouth good. The hibachi plate was huge and delicious.\\n\\nATMOSPHERE: The small restaurant had the feel of a larger one in a good way. And, I know this may be a weird compliment, but they had the restaurant at a PERFECT temperature. It was pleasantly cool and not freezing. Very nice with this 90 degree weather we have been having.\\n\\nThe negatives:\\n\\nPRICE: Rolls are expensive here unless you get the basic rolls. I don't know if I need to change my expectation but I always feel like two rolls of sushi should cost around $15, not twice that but I may have the wrong idea. However, our group was careful with what we ordered and walked out with an appetizer, 2 x ice tea, 2 x miso soup, 1 x salad, 2 x specialty rolls and 1 x hibachi for under $50. \\n\\nMENU: Pictures on the menu and 4 pages when it could have been 2. I have a thing about menus, I once walked out of a place because of a bad menu design (to be fair, that place also SMELLED). Nikki sushi has so many other things going for it that the slightly bulky menu can be overlooked.\\n\\nNo outdoor seating, at least that I could see. Minor negative.\\n\\nOverall, this restaurant is definitely a solid choice with good service in an area where no one seems to do food right except for New Seasons.\\n\\nNotes: Good for kids, they have a kids menu that looked pretty good!

Now while it was fresh and tasty and soft on the inside, the outside was a little tough.  This made eating the sandwich with your hands impossible and cutting it with the serrated butter knife they supplied quite a chore.\\n\\nBut the star of the meal was the Caesar side salad.  Now the choices of kale, cucumber, and spinach seemed odd to me for a Caesar.  But the homemade dressing was so delicious it didn't make a difference.  You could put that dressing on a shoe and it would be delicious!  A nice, rich, creamy Caesar bursting with garlic and onion flavor.  It had a little kick in the finish too!  Siracha? Cayenne?

Needless to say, since then, I've become a frequent visitor to this quaint little breakfast \\"hallway.\\"\\n\\nFor those of you longing for good old-fashioned breakfast food that probably exceeds your caloric recommendation for the day, Sunny's is a great place that actually adds some quality to the grease.  The eggs are always done nicely, the home fries are seasoned well (sometimes a little on the salty side, it depends how deep the potatoes were in the basket when they seasoned them), and the pancakes are to die for.  Seriously, I never thought chocolate chip pancakes could taste that good.\\n\\nThe food, however, is a little on the pricey side, especially for breakfast.  Their signature \\"Gentle Giant\\" combo - 3 eggs, your choice of ham/sausage/bacon, home fries, and 2 pancakes (chocolate chip, regular, or blueberry), will cost you 8 bucks.  Surprisingly, however, the food isn't nearly as filling as it sounds.  My suspicion is that they don't give you 3 eggs...or at least, it definitely doesn't look like it.\\n\\nSunny's also serves omelets (great food, but also a little pricey at $6-8), breakfast sandwiches, and combinations of the above.  They do have a lunch menu, but I don't think I've ever seen anyone order from it.  Trust me, this place is for breakfast.\\n\\nThe waitress (there's only one for the entire place) is always busy, as she has to serve everyone in addition to being the cashier.

If you want anything other than water, tea, or coffee, go to the fridge yourself and grab it.  Finding a table for more than 2 will be difficult, so don't try to bring big groups to this place.\\n\\nIf you're looking for some better quality breakfast, come to Sunny's.

The Cheese Plate had fresh pulled mozzarella with basil oil, parmigiano, pimento cheese, hazelnuts, and homemade crackers. The cheeses were unpretentious, but very delicious. The freshness of the mozzarella was evident with its creaminess. The pimento cheese was very tasty as well. The Spring Toast was a smaller dish, but I loved the light cheese spread on the toast with the over medium egg and vegetables. Yum!

Also, sound just bounces off the metal walls, tables and benches, so even when we only had four in our group, it was a bit hard to carry on conversations.

The first time I went was at lunch, so everyone needed to get back to the office, but we were there for two hours because it took them so long to take our order and bring our food!

Eggs weren't seasoned at all, there were 3 tiny pieces of bacon, one sausage patty and unbuttered toast. As for the grits...I asked if I could sub in their tater tots  (since I'm not much of a grit fan)and the waiter, after first saying no, then maybe and giving me a very disapproving look...finally said \\"sure\\".

The decor of the restaurant reminds me of an upscale boat house with nice cider wood paneling and stone floors. \\nWe were seated in the section on the spit level with floor to ceiling windows. The ambiance was very much like Ray's On the River. There is a really nice view of the river and river bank areas. \\nFor starters we ordered the Smoked Salmon on Crispy Potato Cakes, four come in one order so it should be enough for a party of four or less. The salmon was fresh, the potato cakes were crispy with creme fresh which together made for a tantalizing treat.\\nThe majority of the guests in my party order the Springer Chicken Entree and they all loved it. I thought the portion size was good and it looked delicious. \\nI ordered the Enchanted Rainbow Trout with Lobster Rangoon Ravioli, I only have great things to say about this dish and was so sad when it was all gone.

The Lobster Rangoon Ravioli paired perfectly with the fish and the white creamy sauce made everything so delicious!\\nFor dessert we all tried different things I had the Bourbon Creme Brulee with Bacon Brittle which was devine.

Thank you!**\\n\\nI really hate that I have to write this review but my experience here was so memorably terrible I just can't let it go. \\n\\nMy fiance and I have been in a long distance relationship (Canada to California) for the last 3.5 years. We tied the knot this past weekend but we wanted our families to finally meet for the first time before the big day. We made a reservation for 16 people two days before the scheduled dinner and let them know we would be splitting the tabs. They called the day before to confirm the reservation and everything was good to go.\\n\\nWe arrived on time and were quickly taken back to the area that was setup for us. We were all the way in the back where it is booth style seating on one side of the table and chairs on the other. 3 tables were pushed together against a bamboo wall and we immediately knew that would not work for us being that the likelihood of people needing to get up to use the bathroom was fairly high. With that setup, EVERYONE sitting in the booth would need to get up and scooch out to let you out. We absolutely did not make it a big deal to the staff and simply moved the tables away from one another so that there were essentially 3 different tables and space to maneuver in and out easily. My fiance and I needed a little time to figure out the seating arrangements so that my family could mingle with his, and my friends could mingle with one another as well as us and our families. It was a bit of a jigsaw puzzle but we were figuring it out amongst ourselves. There were no other customers in this back area so we didn't think it was a big deal that we hadn't seated ourselves yet. Our server Jane walked over the first time and basically asked what the problem was.. We said nothing, we were just trying to figure out the seating arrangements. She quickly came back with \\"Well, you reserved 16 and here is 16.\\" then walked away. Jane walks back and says \\"All of our parties of 16 sit this way\\" and we just explained that our families are meeting for the first time and we wanted the seating arrangement a certain way which was NOT her problem. She walks away again and starts talking to the other servers. She comes back and says \\"If you separate the tables you are going to lose table space. Put it back so you can all fit.\\" ..A suggestion we politely declined and asked if we could just have a moment to OURSELVES to figure this out. Again, we were not making it the staff's issue. It was ours. By this time I'm annoyed that Jane won't stop pestering us as we figure this out. Our entire party wasn't even there yet so we weren't sure why she was in such a rush to get us seated. We were in no ones way and we were not ready to order yet since we were still waiting for people. \\n\\nWhen it finally came time to order things took a turn for the worst. She wouldn't let us order on the same tab if we weren't sitting with each other at the same table. Here's where I get confused.. If the tables were pushed together as you originally had it, it would've been okay for two people to be on the same tab. But because the tables are about 3 inches apart now, and the two people sitting DIRECTLY next to each other are not at the same table, technically, they can't be on the same check? This was one of our requests when we made the reservation and your management said it wouldn't be a problem. When we asked that 4 people be on the same tab she literally laughed and said \\"Haha, what? Why would you be on the same tab if you're not sitting together? Why don't they move over to that table?\\" Her responses were RIDICULOUS and with the worst tone I had ever experienced from a server. When we inquired about certain things on the menu she would bark back with \\"WHAT??\\" and \\"UHH SURE\\" and \\"UM OK BUT\\" Like I want to give her the benefit of the doubt that every other day besides that day she is a little more intelligent, but honestly the entire 2 hours with her was a complete nightmare. No one has ever gotten under my skin like that. She was rude and incompetent, bottom line. Worst service I have ever experienced and I will continue to tell people about it and deter people from coming here as long as Jane is there. It sucks because the other servers we encountered were great, but unfortunately Jane was so terrible I cannot give this place any higher than 1 star. I hope she leaves the service industry soon and hopefully Ebisu will never have to scare away another customer because of grumpy people like her. It's a shame we picked this spot for such a special moment for my fianc√© and I. Jane, if you're reading this, please let me teach you how to meditate and find your center.

I even enjoyed the somewhat tacky paintings of local Austin food carts adorning the walls.  One drawback: the main dining area can get pretty crowded around lunch time, and the acoustics of the room seem to amplify the noise rather than dull it (think \\"high school cafeteria effect\\".)\\n\\nThe food was good for the most part.  I highly recommend the red chile fries, if only because they reminded me so much of the Flamin' Hot Cheetos that my buddies and I used to down by the bagful growing up.  Don't worry - they serve them with a side of garlic aioli, so you won't feel like a complete child for ordering them.  Our table also grabbed an order of the Barbacoa Stackers.  They were hard to eat (too loaded with ingredients to eat by hand and too crunchy / fragile to eat with a knife and fork), but that didn't stop us from shamelessly devouring the lot of them.  A big shout out to the 'slaw at JAK - I am a fan.  \\n\\nFor my main course I ordered the Chorizo Stuffed Pork Tenderloin.  The medallions were overcooked, and slightly burnt even on the outsides.  Otherwise the chorizo and pork paired well together, and the heavy saucing helped cover the \\"burnt\\" flavor.  A wonderful conception of a dish - I would have liked to see it better executed.\\n\\nOur poor server had a few issues during our lunch, mostly stemming from the noise in the dining area.  As a customer I don't care about the mistakes as much as I care about the rebound, and rebound she did.   First she misheard our order and brought out the wrong burger - she immediately accepted responsibility, apologized, ordered up a new burger, and even sent the manager over to apologize as well.  Second she brought the wrong check to our table.  We brought it to her attention, she laughed it off, apologized, and brought the correct bill out.  While we did wait awhile for the burger, I can't say I left upset about the experience.\\n\\nI am hoping to come back for brunch based on all the wonderful things Yelpers have to say, but for a guy who lives and works downtown, I can't say the food justifies the drive for a workday lunch."},{"name":"Canoe","address":"4199 Paces Ferry Rd SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Brought my boyfriend here for his 40th birthday and it was perfect!

The option to choose your own adventure/build your own entrees is nice but on this visit it worked better in theory than in practice.  \\n\\nIt's down to personal preferences and we felt there was not enough work given to melding and building complexity in the spices/curry in either of our mains.  \\n\\nDrunken noodles had slightly undissolved spices aka a bit grainy.  The Panang curry had more of a thin coconut milk broth than the thicker sauce I crave that better adhers to the noodles/rice.  This Panang had a decent heat level kick to it but I had to soup up the curry using spices from the home pantry and some low simmer time in a sauce pan on the stovetop to thicken it up and make it tastier.  \\n\\nTaro milk tea was grainy and boba were soft in the center and the exterior skin seemed dry.\\n\\nPositives:  All the ingredients in the food were fresh.

I sat at the chef's table so I could get a better fix on the offerings. The wine was just right with the skirt steak and Caesar salad I ordered. The sauce on the steak was subtle and not too salty like you would find at lesser restaurants.  The two wedges of potato casserole were hearty and yummy. The portion was so large that I took part home.  I can report from looking at all the food coming out of the kitchen that all the portions of the main courses are large, maybe even too large. But they are prepared with real care.  \\n\\nIt's not cheap but it's not over priced either.

It looks like it was decorated by the same team that designed Chipotle. The only real difference was the high-tops and the photos of street hawkers on the walls. \\n\\nAvoid the high-tops if you want to sit comfortably. We were seated at one originally and had to ask to move to a regular table. The bench seats are short and you feel like you're going to fall off. The stool seats have a weird 1/4 height back to them and aren't much more comfortable than the benches.\\n\\nSince the concept seems to really be focused on sharing food with a group, it seems odd that there are no large tables.

The tofu was the only real disappointment, being largely tasteless. The pork in the banh mi was moist and flavorful, but there was just too much bread - soaking up and drying out the sandwich. The tofu on the veggie skewers was breaded, but despite our fears, was not at all greasy or oily. The salad had a delicious and light dressing that paired perfectly with it. The duck tacos were excellent.\\n\\nThe only real disappointment here was the service. Everyone was friendly - but it was really slow. The food came out at a reasonable pace - it was purely the service staff. There were two servers and one person helping bus tables. They were constantly running around, but it felt like not much was actually getting done. Glasses of water were sitting empty for long stretches.

Okay food, average service. The only stand out feature is the $3 mimosas.\\n\\nBut do not come here when it's busy or if it's a special occasion. They clearly don't have plans or processes in place to handle high volume or unforeseen events. We made a reservation for Mother's Day to include a high chair and they ran out before we got there. Which was a bummer, but we were told we would get one ASAP and that 3 families were waiting for one ahead of us. Okay, cool, there's list. 30 minutes goes by and we haven't gotten a high chair. We have a very wiggly 11 month old that loves food and is perfectly content to munch on food during an entire meal, which is why we made sure to note the high chair need in the reservation.  Having her eat in our laps kind of marred the whole experience of my first Mother's Day brunch out. We asked our server and he didn't know that we were waiting for one. He tried to find one for us and wasn't able to. About 3/4 of the way through the meal, another family was sat near us and immediately given a high chair. We asked the hostess who provided it if we could also have one since we had been waiting and she apologized, saying she didn't see us when she was looking to see who still needed a high chair. So there wasn't a list or any way of tracking it, it was just by sight. She told us she would get us one ASAP.  She didn't. We didn't get a high chair for the entire meal. I didn't really enjoy my meal because I was stressed about managing the baby eating on our laps. \\n\\nThe hostess came back after we paid and apologized while looking stressed, saying \\"there were just so many kids that needed high chairs.\\" Which, while true, doesn't change the fact they had no rhyme or reason to how they handed them out. I was much more understanding of the high volume situation until they gave a high chair to a family that just sat down. When I pointed that out, the hostess just said, \\"Yes, I'm sorry,\\" and handed me a $20 off coupon (which is only good Sunday-Thurs lol). \\n\\nSo if it's not busy, I'm sure you will have a lovely experience.

She gave me a black ink pen to make my initial selection, and when she returned with all the meats and veggies and little chive cakes (which are delicious!), she brought back my order sheet and gave me a red ink pen to make second selections, and it looks like she had other colored ink pens. I am assuming this is to eliminate the \\"what did I order\\" issue I saw some other reviewers were having.

The food is incredible. The presentation is creative and aesthetically pleasing. The ingredients are local and seasonal (menu changes constantly). The flavors were bold and exquisite. \\n\\nThe service was good. You would think a restaurant that serves this type of \\"foodie food\\" would be uppity, but the atmosphere is very casual with concrete floors, exposed ceilings and brick walls. The staff were friendly and happy to help you pick out which dishes to order. The price was in the range of other nice meals I've had in Atlanta.\\n\\nChicken Liver Tart - This was my favorite item we ordered. The flavor was so good, and it was topped with corn nuts, fennel 3 ways, and dehydrated crispy shallots. Delicious!\\n\\nGrilled cabbage - This dish was my least favorite (but still good). It was topped with shaved fish and a fermented shrimp sauce. It was like an umami bomb! It was a little rich for my taste, and the cabbage fell apart when I tried to eat it so it made it difficult to mix all of the flavors together.\\n\\nCarrots - The carrots with aged beet fat sauce (was almost like a sour cream) was delicious. It had sprouted sunflower seeds which added a nice crunch and shaved radishes. Really liked this!\\n\\nSteelhead Trout - This dish was very good. It was more hearty, topped with roe, radishes, collards, and a foamy sauce. The fish skin was crisp and salty - kind of like pork rinds. \\n\\nDessert - There was only one dessert option, but we really liked it. Made with oranges who had been soaked so the rind was soft and edible. The sourness of the rind paired nicely with the sweetness of the fruit. It also had toasted milk, hazelnut, and vanilla ice cream. Delicious!\\n\\nI also had a cup of Counter Culture coffee which was very good. \\n\\nThis place was larger than I expected, but had a cozy, intimate feel. The patio seating is communal, and is enclosed so it's warm even in the winter. Valet parking. They have 8 walk-in seats at the bar each evening, but you have to get there very early to get one.

As for that, at $6, it's quite satisfying for bar food.\\n\\nAs far as the bar goes, I'm quite happy with it. The bartenders are quite friendly once you get to know them, and usually have a few good sarcastic or witty comments to make that I can appreciate.  They are good about getting to know their regulars as well and making sure you're well taken care of. One my friends really likes the place because she can bring her dog up to the patio at night. The patio is nice and has good lighting and comfortable chairs. The regulars are generally friendly and are almost always good for a drunk argument or two if that's your thing. The liquor selection is actually fairly expansive for a small, dive-ish bar. They have a few beers on tap besides the usual lite beers and an alright selection of bottles/imports.

A loving friend stopped by a few hours before to try to arrange a table and was treated extremely rudely by one of the staff - he is someone that has been in Austin since 1977! Ridiculous... \\n\\nAfter hearing about this, I decided to arrive early to see what I might be able to do to ensure that the group of 10 had a table available and ready for them so we weren't further inconvenienced. I did everything within my power to reason with Eva the manager and she just kept referring to \\"policy.\\" I offered to guarantee an amount of $100 on a credit card to keep the table and she refused. The situation was so dismal that another woman and regular customer, who was waiting on her husband, chimed in as well - as she wasn't seated either. She and her FOUR children were required to wait.  Again, the restaurant was essentially empty outside and completely empty inside. \\n\\nEva then proceeded to tell me that I had to sit in the bar until my complete party arrived and that she would buy me a drink on the house to make up for the lack of empathy that she seemed to display throughout the whole scenario. Once again, I AM PREGNANT as you may recall so that didn't do me much good. After I pointed that out, she acquiesced and offered an appetizer - a queso.\\n\\nEssentially, the entire group was there at 6 and we went out to get seated. At this point, the manager Eva was well aware that we were not at all pleased with the customer service by any means to this point, as three people in our group had complained. Rather than offering the entire table perhaps a round of drinks or apps or ANYTHING on her, she completely ignored us and the service was among the worst I have ever gotten in Austin. The drinks took a half an hour, the apps even longer and when they finally did arrive they were cold as was the food. There was absolutely no attention paid to a large party of people who had a sizable check. The manager made absolutely NO effort to appease or apologize. I have worked in hospitality on many occasions that this treatment was absolutely unacceptable. \\n\\nAs a longtime, proud resident of Austin, all of this was rather unfortunate.

She told me she didn't know how to redeem it & she would have to call the owner. I said that was fine & she walked away. Another five minutes later, she told me he wouldn't allow me to use it because he wasn't present in the store. I told her the certificate didn't have any restrictions. I used 2 certificates that within the last week or so(other restaurants )and didn't have any problems. She said, there was nothing she could do, and it was his decision. I asked if she could call him so I could speak to him. I had driven out of my way for an hour.  She used her phone to call him & handed me the phone. I introduced myself and asked if he could provide his staff instructions over the phone so I could use my certificate. He said no because she messes up all the time. I told him that wasn't my issue. I told him that I drove out of my way for an hour to dine in his establishment. He said I couldn't use it & I could drive out of my way on Sunday when he would be there.

We were all blown away by the freshness of every selection, the taste combinations, the perfect portion sizes, and the dictated pricing!   We had the salmon and lox sliders, the pork crepes, the chicken crepes, and the pear panini. The consensus was that the salmon and lox were probably the favorite, but everything was so magnificent that we opted to try the cuatro leches dessert. There was definitely a tanginess from the addition of the goat's milk, but I can't say it was the best I've ever had.

Scissor your teeth through the cheese on each bite or be doomed to eat the remainder of your hoagie in cheeseless misery. \\nSeriously though, are you supposed to use a fork? Because I didn't.

The kicker, my salad was made with dressing even though I'd asked for it on the side (no I didn't send it back).

The first is that twice now the boba (or tapioca balls) that have come in my smoothie have been hard. Which tells me they're old!

It was packed Saturday night, with a whole bunch of twenty somethings, that looked just alternative enough, while still being able to afford the $5 beers. It made me wonder what all these people were doing Wednesday night? I mean before this place opened where were they? \\n\\nThere is a whole wall of draft beers, and bottled beers from all over. There must be more than 200 total. Plus they have a full pub kitchen. \\n\\nThey have this plan, where you get a UFO membership card, and once you try 200 different beers you get your name up on the \\"ring of honor.\\"  This sounds like something horribly stupid and pointless, and silly, so I thought I should probably go ahead and join up. \\n\\nGet this though, it is $14.00 to join.  Here I am committing to spending $1000 in your joint, and I have pay $14.00 to get started. That is just stupid!  Idiotic even!\\n\\nSo I went ahead and starting filling out the form to join so I could pay my $14.00, and get started on my 200 beers, but my wife freaked out so I decided not to join. \\n\\nNow, whenever I go there, I'll just feel like I'm wasting beers, because they aren't counting toward anything. \\n\\nThe waitresses are cute, and the two different ones that served me were quick, courteous, and seemed happy to have their jobs.

But it is pretty nice, and very close to my house. \\n\\nI'm more of a beer drinker, than a beer connoisseur though. I mean I've tried most of those beers, and I like some of them. But I'm old and my belly has pretty much settled on Lone Star and the occasional Stella or Spaten. No Lone Star at the Flying Saucer, and no Bud products of any kind, which you have to respect a little. \\n\\nWe tried the two pretzel special, two soft pretzels and two dipping sauces. The pretzel was good, really just soft doughy bread. But one word of warning if you have three heavy beers and a pretzel with queso dipping sauce around 10:30pm at night. Be prepared to be a pootering fool the next morning. My poor office mate. \\n\\nThey seem to do what they claim to do well here, doesn't feel like home to me though, more like a beer disneyworld.

My mouth is now watering after typing those last few sentences.  It was cooked perfectly, great portion size, and just fantastic.  I wouldn't hesitate to order it again if (when) I return.  My wife got the salmon, and it was also very good, although somewhat traditional.  \\n\\nWe didn't order an appetizer, but they bring a great selection of breads to your table and allow you to pick a few kinds.  They're great, think Great Harvest type breads.  We did order the Georgia Peach Crisp for dessert.  The peaches and crisp were really good, albeit somewhat ordinary, but it came with a scoop of homemade honey flavored ice cream that was incredible.  Seriously, I'm planning on sending them an email asking for the recipe.\\n\\nAdditionally, the view from the outside is awesome.  Sits right on the river, and it smells and looks great.\\n\\nAs you can probably tell from the review, I enjoy trying unique foods rather than traditional ones.  I can prepare a salmon steak at home or even go to Outback and get a good one for $12, so paying $30 for salmon seems a bit wrong to me.

One time we had to wait to be seated even though the restaurant was empty because that waitress had just been seated with another table - super weird. We have been served wine that went bad as well.

The other two, saag aloo and chana masala, were tasty, but unfortunately tasted almost exactly alike. Both tasted a lot like the matar, but not as sweet. The 3 textures were all alike, too. No chutneys in sight except a scary-looking raw onion chutney. No papad. No raita. The vegetable samosas (included) had a curious, mushy filling that tasted too strongly of raw cumin.

Houston's has always been a place known for great service and good food, well that has definitely changed.  They used to make the menu items that were not on the menu any time that you wanted them and now they no longer do this.  Biltmore Chicken Sandwich and The Club were 2 of my favorite items, which they will no longer make for you. VERY DISAPPOINTING.  Last night was the final time I will be dinning at Houston's on Lenox.  The hostess sat us, which she was very polite and nice - we had to wait about 30 minutes, but no big deal.  It started out that they  were out of the Grilled Artichokes, which we were there for dinner at 5:15pm.  I understand if it was 8:30pm or 9:00pm, but obviously the kitchen manager did not order enough.  Very disappointing.  We then ordered a vodka gimlet, which is our favorite drink there and told the server that we wanted it in a Martini glass (that is how they usually serve it, but we wanted to make sure).  Of course the drink came out in a drink glass, so we had to send it back adn explain in detail what we wanted - we have been coming here for years and all of a sudden we are having to explain the drink to them?  This is where we first tried this drink.  I ordered my favorite salad which is the Shashimi salad and mom ordered the Salmon with the kale salad.  When my salad came out they have changed the size of the salad to so small it was incredible, but still the same price.  I had to ask the server for onions (which were supposed to be on there) - it took them 10 minutes to get them out to me.  The tuna was full of fat and I had to peel the fat off of every piece before eating it.  The one good thing is that mom did enjoy her meal.  When we asked for the check, the server brought us the wrong check, so we had to wait another 15 minutes to get the right check.  It was another terrible experience and will not be going back there."},{"name":"Amber Jack's Taphouse","address":"9850 King George Hiway","city":"Surrey","stars":"3","text":"Decent beer selection but slow service and mediocre food."},{"name":"Cakes By Terri","address":"157 Charles St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"5","text":"This is probably one the most talented cake designer in the area.

This place absolutely rocked and won my girlfriend and I over almost instantly after randomly stumbling upon it. \\n\\nWe all know how dehydrating and taxing flying can be and I needed a good beer asap before plummeting into cardiac arrest. The little lady was slipping into a Pacific Northwest hypothermia that could only be cured by something hot and potent, I am neither of those. After checking into our acommodations (a cute air bnb up Snob Hill) we headed out on foot in search of some cures. Granted, driving may have provided speedier transport to salvation, but we are responsible and knew if we found salvation, we were going to get ripped on salvation. The walk in search of a miracle elixir seemed to last forever and, just as we were both about to succumb to our ailments, we spotted Kells Brew Pub and thus, a glimpse of hope that we might yet survive. \\n\\nUpon entering we found a super cozy and welcoming atmosphere with ample seating room at the bar. Normally the huge, warm fireplace and pillowy sofa would have been our first choice, but given the severity of our maladies, believed the quickest path to treatment to be at the bar. One Kells IPA as well as a  Kells hot chocolate later and we were perking up faster than a three peckered goat. The IPA was great and tasty, but the star of the show was the hot chocolate--holy amaze-balls! It was so good that we found ourselves going back multiple times just to indulge in more!  The food was solid bar fare (we stuck to normal cheeseburger type stuff) and the breakfast rocked. Oh, did I mention out of all the places we had them, Kells bloody mary was by far the best? \\n\\nBest bloody and best spiked hot chocolate with a great breakfast menu, now you know what you need to do next time you're searching for a little help and salvation."},{"name":"Pizza Schmizza Pub & Grub","address":"18021 NW Evergreen Pkwy","city":"Hillsboro","stars":"3","text":"It's simple - pizza + salad + drinks for a quick lunch.

Another waiter checked on us.  No roe. We did finally receive our itty bitty fish eggs. \\n\\nAside from the waiting, there were some other downsides.  The sushi was nothing special.  They weren't made all that well - they seemed loose and kind of mushy with uneven ingredients (way too much avocado, etc). \\n\\nAnd then there was the screaming.  I get that hibachi is a fun time.  Who doesn't love watching someone older than 3 throw food around? But sitting on the sushi side unable to hear anything but the patrons and chefs from the other side shouting and screaming is akin to chaperoning a chuck-e-cheese birthday party.

Everything was fresh, tasty, cooked to order and piping hot.    All the ingredients were of the highest quality.   My spring rolls were outstanding as they were made fresh and cooked to order, not simply tossed into a frialator to be heated up!.  My Tom Yum Soup was the best I have ever had ( and I am a Tom Yum connoiseur)  The soup was  served extremely temperature hot....just the way I like it.   The Pad Thai was outstanding, tasty, fresh, and cooked just right as well as piping hot( not slimey, sticky or bland as some other restaurants make it).   Both the steak and chicken basil was excellent (this was not my order as I don't like basil but my brother enjoyed it).    The Strawberry ice cream was tasty and a nice final touch although it is served in a prescooped very small plastic hoodsie like tub taken right from the freezer.  Prices are very reasonable!   Please be aware that this is not a fancy dining establishment, as there are only 8 tables and it is mostly a take out place.   If you are looking for a nice restaurant to propose to your fiance, this is not the place to take her!  Due to the small seating capacity we had to wait about 30 minutes on a Sunday night....understandably, they do not take reservation.   There is plenty of on street parking which is where you will wait as there is no waiting area in the restaurant. The wait staff were exceptionally attentive and polite.

It is surprisingly small inside, so we had to wait about 20 minutes for a table since I didn't know we could call ahead.  The hostess was pleasant and got my daughter a glass of water while we waited - she thought ahead and put it in a covered glass with a straw (thanks!).\\n\\nWhen we got to our table I was a little surprised they didn't tell me it was a high table in the bar area (after all, I have a young child and my clearly older mother with me, and these very very high, even for high tables).   Our server was average - friendly enough but just not great.  I asked if the Black Horse beer was filtered or not and she didn't know what I meant (I would expect servers to know that at least for the establishment's signature beer; FYI, it is filtered).  On the other hand, I asked for a different dressing on my salad and she got that right. \\n\\nSteak tips were wonderful, pizzas are solid (and generously sized for the price), and my salad was filling as a main meal.  The only part of the meal that was disappointing was the kid's meal (pasta).  It didn't come out first with our appetizers as I usually see, so my daughter had to wait a long time for food (and there was no bread or crayons supplied to keep her busy).  When it did arrive, I was surprised to see spaghetti (the menu just said pasta and it never occurred to me to ask since we have never gotten spaghetti from a kid's menu before).  Spaghetti is hard to eat if you have still-developing motor skills and can't twirl your fork, and it was super-buttery so I really didn't want my daughter to eat with her fingers.  I had to help her eat, which means I didn't really get to focus on my meal.  \\n\\nWe will be back - this is a comfortable establishment with solid food, relaxed atmosphere, and a varied menu at fair prices.

First and probably last visit. We had the dine-out menu. I ordered the hot and sour soup, Szechuan Chili prawns and dessert was the tropical fruit soup. My friend started with the Peking duck salad. The hot and sour soup was ok minus the sour and it wasn't very spicy either. The salad was a bit disappointing as there were only 3-4 thin slices of duck. The prawns were cooked well, with the snap of a perfectly cooked prawn but i was expecting Szechuan chilli, it tasted more like sweet and sour. The tropical fruit soup was small bit of fruit and tapioca pearls and coconut ice cream wading in a pool of mango puree. Can't really taste the coconut flavour in the ice cream. We decided to order from the regular menu too. We tried the sashimi tuna jellyfish salad and lobster claypot rice. The salad was good. Nothing spectacular. The claypot rice was a bit of a disappointment. I was expecting crispy rice on the bottom. When the pot came it was soupy rice (pow fan). Lobster was hard to find in the pot of rice. For $29, there should be at least a few chunks of lobster meat. \\nFor the price I paid, I could have fed a family of 4 very well at a Chinese seafood restaurant. For a fine dining establishment, presentation was not elevated. I've read other reviews and this sentiment is common. \\nDespite the mediocre attempt at fine dining Chinese, the evening was marred by an unfortunate incident that could have been handled better. \\nI was genuinely looking forward to trying this restaurant.

A waiter appeared instantly to take our dinner and drink orders, but it took almost an hour to get our food. We held ourselves over on bread and bean dip in the meantime.\\n\\nI chose the penne pasta with sausage, roasted peppers, tomato and basil on the waiter's recommendation. It was served in a rich red cream sauce that gave it a kick. It was good, but not great. One of my friends ordered a pizza, the Margherita with tomatoes, basil, garlic and mozzerella. After two bites she complained that all she could taste was garlic, and she cut up a slice passed it around for us to sample. Sure enough, it tasted like a garlic clove wrapped in mozzerella.

I went here for a late lunch with my brother-in-law and I thought the food was fantastic. I'll eat chili from time to time, but I don't usually eat much of it because I'm not a fan of ground beef (it's a texture thing). The chili at this place uses what I would call carne guisada meat instead, like a real tender steak cut into decent size chunks. I've never had chili that way before, but I LOVED it. The meat was so tender! They give you tons of choices in regards to what kind of chili you want, including their traditional chili (in three levels of spicy), white chili, venison chili, etc. I went with the Frito Pie with traditional chili (level 2 out of 3 on spiciness) and it was awesome! Great flavor, tender meat, cheese, and of course Fritos. I also had a reasonably priced Shiner Bock to wash it down. For a \\"small\\" but very generous bowl of chili and the beer, I paid $10.\\n\\nMy brother-in-law got a chargrilled burger which he said was very good too. His girlfriend got a chili sampler plate with like three different kinds of chili to try and she said they were all quite tasty, especially the venison chili and the white (pork) chili. The service was good and they came around quite often to bring us more water, which was much needed as the delightfully spicy chili started making our mouths burn.\\n\\nI would absolutely go here again. I found absolutely nothing to complain about with this restaurant. The only thing I would advise (and this is nothing the restaurant has any control over), is that you bring a dollar or two in change for the parking meters and get there early to find one that's available and working. This place is close to the capital, so there's tons of parking lots that non-government folks can't park in, so you have to drive around until you find a meter or a public parking garage. This place was still worth the effort!"},{"name":"Subway","address":"1175 Ralph David Abernathy Blvd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"2","text":"This was a good Subway experience.  This location boasts fast service, subway food that meets the quality of what most people seem expect to from Subway & they also have really nice staff at this location."},{"name":"Brick and Beam","address":"705 Adams St","city":"Quincy","stars":"3.5","text":"The food is pretty good but slow to come out. The atmosphere is much better than I was expecting. Definitely a great place to take a 1st date for dinner and drinks. They have 2 bars which is a plus but it can get crowded quickly. The service was excellent!"},{"name":"Pizza Pie-er","address":"182 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"This is not the best pizza but it is delicious...\\n\\nWhat does it have that sets it apart? \\n\\nGarlic and Cheese Bread. \\n\\nI haven't lived in Boston for a couple years now and I still have fantasies of finding a place that will serve a similar Garlic and Cheese Sticks. \\n\\nHUGE chunks of garlic. Covered by mozza. On a personal sized pizza. Cut into long strips. Served with red sauce. \\n\\nMmmmmmmmmmmmmmm *tummy growl*\\n\\nNow, moving on. The downside: \\nThese people \\"hate\\" vegans. We've ordered vegan pizza a couple times and BOTH times it was screwy. Is \\"No Cheese\\" so confusing? I know Pizza isn't rocket science and thus may not attract a slew of geniuses but... come on... respect people's wishes--- especially when they're paying you to and your boss is paying you to."},{"name":"Pastamore Ristorante & Market","address":"6000 Universal Blvd, Ste 700","city":"Orlando","stars":"2","text":"Don't be fooled, the name really isn't Italian, but the food is, served up big and family style. Going back to the name, it's really just the words \\"pasta\\" and \\"more\\" put together, but feel free to pronounce with an accent if you'd like. \\n\\nIt's actually a good name because it describes the restaurant well, large portions of fresh ingredients. The open kitchen is a nice touch and surprisingly cool and not as cookie-cutter as you would expect for its city walk location."},{"name":"Trifecta Annex","address":"126 SW 2nd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I'm a NY pizza snob.
