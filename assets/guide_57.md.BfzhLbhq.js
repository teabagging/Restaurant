Sure, it's always fun to root for the underdog, but in this case there's also a very practical reason to pick J Mueller over Franklin: You can just go and grab some great BBQ without it having to be an epic pilgrimage. I have no regrets having stood in line for two hours to sample Franklin's legendary meat, but who wants to do that sort of thing more than once or twice? Getting good barbecue shouldn't be an extreme sport, and at J Mueller it's not.\\n\\nOn my visit the line was short and moved quickly. The gal at the order window started by cutting a sample of a brisket burnt end and tossing it on my tray, just like they do at Louie Mueller BBQ in Taylor. Nice. One bite of the brisket was all I needed to know it was in the same league as the very best Texas BBQ. Nonetheless I proceeded to eat another half pound, along with the complimentary bread, pickles and onions. The meat was as tender as any. Not quite as moist as Franklin's, but the bark had more firmness - a good thing except for one small bit that should have been cut off as a burnt end. The sauce was a sort I've only found in Central and West Texas - not at all sweet but more like a warm, soupy salsa.

Nothing stands out - the drinks (from chai lattes to mochas to london fogs and more) are all okay, avoiding the pitfalls of excessive sugar but also not having much flavour to them. They don't do multiple sizes but the cup sizes are small, which I appreciate, though they're priced more like large drinks at other shops. The baked goods are fine, nothing memorable. Everything is a little bit pricier than I'd like to pay for the taste, though - I'd rather go somewhere cheaper and simpler, or somewhere fancy where the quality really matches the pricetag.\\n\\nThe physical environment itself is also not great for staying, unless you're in a group. It's dominated by communal tables, which makes for fairly uncomfortable seating if you're looking to sit down with somebody one-on-one, or if you're looking to do some work or studying on your own.

There was a little girl, who sat next to us, and ate her first oyster there with her dad. The guy who worked at the bar was nice enough to clean the shell of the oyster she ate for her to keep for memories.

You might as well choose a place that has fresh quality seafood. The oysters are really fresh! You can't go to the Union OYSTER House and not have oysters...c'mon!

Oysters are generally more expensive than most other food options, but if you can get solid oysters for a dollar each, it's hard to beat. If good oysters for cheap sounds good to you, you should hit up The Optimist's happy hour. What's unique about the happy hour here is that they have every single day of the week, even Saturday and Sunday:\\n\\n- Mon to Fri from 5-6 pm\\n- Sat and Sun from 3-5 pm\\n\\nNot too many places can say that. As far as getting here, if you don't Uber, Lyft, etc. here, you can always park along the side streets or use the valet.\\n\\nIf you want the happy hour option, you do have to sit at the oyster bar area or the patio. Either option seems great since The Optimist has a great atmosphere throughout. You do have several options for dollar oysters:\\n\\n- Damariscotta River (MA)\\n- Wash Ashore (MA)\\n- Barnstable (MD)\\n- Terrapin Creek (MD)\\n\\nIf you want a variety, you can always go for the Baker's dozen and get 13 for the price of 12.

Our server was ok, but seemed a little overwhelmed. I had an Old Fashioned, and we shared the Shrimp and Grits and the Corn Pudding.\\n\\nThe Old Fashioned was really disappointing. It was bitter and weak tasting. I know it has \\"bitters\\" in it, but that doesn't mean it should taste bitter overall. In fact, if anything, it should taste sweet. The orange and cherry were not muddled at all, which is a no-no in my book. Plus, they added way too much soda to make it look like you were getting more drink. I don't need more drink. I need a drink that tastes like it's supposed to.\\n\\nThe Shrimp and Grits were slightly less than mediocre. I get that you want to do something different, and the grits by themselves tasted pretty good. Actually, the red-eye gravy tasted pretty good too. But the shrimp may just as well have been thawed from a bag of frozen shrimp and gently placed on top and covered in gravy. The only reason I know they weren't pre-cooked is that they weren't cooked all the way. Blech. Shrimp naturally come with their own way to tell if they're done. There is, however, a period which that doneness is questionable. They were in that particular stage, and it just added a level of grossness that we didn't appreciate. If they'd been cooked IN a sauce or gravy, it'd be great, but they looked and tasted like they had been cooked without anything and just tossed on top.\\n\\nThe Corn Pudding was outstanding! It was even made with REAL corn! We could've just eaten a huge bowl of that stuff.

It's a yeast donut so it's nice and fluffy, and filled with a raspberry jelly and chocolate frosting.

Bacon and maple frosting sound like a really weird combination, but trust me, it works! The salty bacon was thick and crispy and it went really well with the sweet maple. It's another yeast donut, so it was very soft and fluffy.  Mine actually just came out of the fryer, so it was still warm, making it even more delicious.  \\n \\n- PORTLAND CREAM : Bavarian cream with chocolate frosting is uber yummy.  I love bavarian cream in cakes and donuts.  The two eyeballs on the side were really cute too.\\n\\n- MEMPHIS MAFIA : This was a massive donut in size and weight.

They have a full bar and outdoor seating. \\n\\nParking might be a little tricky during lunch on week days as they share a parking lot with several other businesses, and medical facilities. \\n\\nOverall, R Rice is a cool option for casual Asian dining."},{"name":"Planet Smoothie","address":"2014 Powers Ferry Rd SE, Ste 350","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Decided to try something different for breakfast today.

The most interesting pizza was a margherita pizza that honestly was not worth the price. The menu was actually really small, and too boring to be minimal. This led to service being more of a nuisance than actual help, since there was little to no reason for help. The daily specials were almost wonderful!

The waffle on the chicken sliders were borderline burnt, it was not a golden brown waffle I had imagined when I ordered the meal, the toast was soggy on the salmon Benedict which was a huge minus for us, and the traditional eggs Benedict was average, nothing spectacular. The side dish of breakfast potatoes that was included with these dishes was extremely disappointing as they didn't fit any dishes we had. There wasn't much balance on the chicken and waffle sliders plate, I would have liked some acidity and color to go along with the dense waffle and crispy chicken, not breakfast potatoes which were under seasoned and greasy. Our general opinion was that the potatoes in my opinion didn't really belong in any of the dishes we ate\\nThe service of the restuarant was subpar, We were never informed of the house specials of the day until we overheard another server tell another table about it. The servers did not come and ask how the food tasted and wasn't really friendly.\\n\\nIf you come here with high expectations to enjoy fine dining, then this might be the wrong place for you.

But it offers enough variety that it's different each time I go. \\n\\nFirst, let me just rave about the Boiler Room, which just opened. I absolutely love it, from the decor to the ambiance. The service is typical McMenamin's to be sure, but you can distract yourself with shuffleboard or pool - they have a table upstairs and down. \\n\\nThe Courtyard Restaurant is also your typical McMenamin's fare - burgers, pizza, pasta, with roomy booths (much better than the tables), cool lights and when it's warm outside, take advantage of the Courtyard itself. I'm always a sucker for their tater tots, and if you want them spicy, try cajunized. \\n\\nMy other favorite is the theatre - $3 for a barely of theatres flicks, lounging on couches whilst imbibing brews and pizza is an awesome outing whether it's friends or a date and pretty cheap too. Their pizzas are OK, but the calzones are better - just make sure they don't shirk you on the marina sauce. \\n\\nAnd of course there's the Detention and Honors bar (tiny and intimate) and the Cypress Room (it has a sweet, hidden spot in the very corner that's perfect for a date). I'm less inclined to visit those places but they're decent. \\n\\nSo that's that - it's a McMenamin's but it's my favorite one by far. I've had less typical bad McMenamins service than at any other McMenamins (I'm looking at you, Ringlers!). The only thing left for me to try is the hotel but since I'm within stumbling distance, that may be awhile or one seriously crazy night away."},{"name":"King + Duke","address":"3060 Peachtree Rd NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Went to this restaurant with a large group of friends, about 8 of us and have to say it was a horrible experience all around.  At first they seated us right by the door that opens to the outside area so there was constant movement in and out and a cold breeze.  I ask them if we could sit somewhere else and they take us to the upstairs area which they should have done initially.  \\n\\nI order a Belvedere martini with blue cheese olives as a drink and the drink was well prepared so kudos to the bartender.  \\n\\nWe then put in our appetizer orders (only 3 of us ordered apps) and only 2 came out.  I ordered the wagyu beef tartare and as they start changing my utensils for the main course I ask where it is.  The waitress tells me she completely forgot to put in the order.  A manager comes out to apologize and I ask for another martini gratis since I know that was good and they accommodate.  The steak tartare was also good.  \\n\\nI will note that the martini and tartare are the only reason I have two stars instead of one.\\n\\nNow for the entree.  I typically will order something on the menu that is supposed to be a restaurants specialty regardless of the price so I ordered the \\"King\\" steak, which is a $109, 32 ounce/1 kilo bone in ribeye medium rare.  The steak was medium at best and the cut was not what I expected with the level of fat and was just lacking overall and quite disappointing.\\n\\nKing and Duke is basically a typical overpriced restaurant as every item on the menu is about 20-25 percent higher than what it should be and when ur choosing between lasagna, trout, burger, etc. it's quite underwhelming.

You don't need me to tell you to go. You don't need me to tell you it's the epitome of southern comfort food. You can drive by on any given weekend, see the line that stretches down the sidewalk (composed of people sweating in their Sunday best), and just KNOW that there's a reason they're waiting. \\nMy advice would be to go not on a weekend, but on a weeknight (perhaps Thursday, like we did), if you can swing it (and especially if you're in a group). A few pro-tips: park in their lot behind the place if you can, and not down the street in the residential neighborhood (our friend got a ticket), arrive together if you are in a group (because they don't seat incomplete parties), and go a little later, around 7pm. \\nIn terms of the food, it was indulgent and wonderful. This is the type of place that you go to with absolutely no inhibitions, so as to fully enjoy it. I ordered a plate with chicken pot pie, mac 'n' cheese, and sweet potato soufflé. My favorite was the mac ' n' cheese (and I'm not a HUGE mac fan); it was the type of mac that has an epic cheese-pull when you take that first bite, and stays thoroughly cheesy and satisfying (not gummy and dry) until the very last bite. The chicken pot pie was delicious as well (even if you have to sort of pry the crust off of the ramekin #worthit), and the sweet potato soufflé basically tasted like a pumpkin spice latte (I mean that in the best way...it was so good). \\nMake sure you try the wonderful yeast rolls and cinnamon rolls that are served before the meal, but avoid the cornbread if you're a vegetarian (it has cracklins in it). Actually just avoid the cornbread in general because it's really dry and you could put that extra room in your stomach to better use, like for the peanut butter pie (thick and indulgent) for dessert, for instance. \\nAll in all, not a date spot, but an Atlanta institution, an icon for a reason, and a great place to take out of towners or Mom and Dad for a heavy, delicious meal."},{"name":"Stammtisch","address":"401 NE 28th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"My husband and I came here on a date night and sat outside.

The wait was out the door. They suggested the option to sit outdoors - excuse me? It was the middle of July in Atlanta and I was not going to eat a hot bowl of ramen outside in the blazing heat. I did see some people take the challenge and watched them sweat into their ramen broth. I was sweating for them, too.  There is very limited seating indoors, so be sure to set aside plenty of time for the wait. \\n\\nAfter a 25 minute wait outside (I guess we might as well have sat outside since we were forced to wait outside), we got two seats at the bar. We didn't have much time after the long wait before I had to head back to work, so we put our ramen orders in quickly. We watched the open kitchen from the bar. They seemed to work efficiently.

After several sips, my gag reflex worked too hard for me to continue drinking it. The heavy broth was tasty, but it was a bit  much for ramen broth. The chashu on top was literally cold. They couldn't take the time to heat up the meat? I understand that it was pre-cooked, but I didn't ask for chilled chashu on top of my hot ramen.

Would not order again\\n\\n- Fried frog legs: Surprisingly good! It was a large portion, almost looked like they had fried a whole frog :) the roti and Thai curry dipping sauce was on point. 5/5\\n\\n- Chilean sea bass: only had a bite but it was pretty good. I immediately noticed that it wasn't flaky and I almost had to use my knife to get a bite\\n\\n- Fried chicken with collard greens and lobster mac and cheese: not the best fried chicken or collard greens I've had in Atlanta. The chicken didn't taste very fresh. The lobster Mac was excellent. I wouldn't order this again. \\n\\n- Crispy beef: EXCELLENT! my favorite dish that I tried. The beef was perfect! Large chunks of beef and a good sized portion\\n\\n- Red velvet, green tea, avocado mousse cake: wouldn't have been my first choice of cake. However, there was only 1 type of cake or caramel apples. The cake was VERY sweet. It tasted like white chocolate at first, then earthy from the avocado, then sweet again from the red velvet. The cake itself wasn't moist. I ate it but I wouldn't order again. \\n\\nOverall, the cocktails were good and there were some hit and miss food items. I probably won't rush back."},{"name":"Steak on Fire","address":"7541 Sand Lake Rd, Ste A","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"One of the worse tasting pieces of food I've had in a while.

The hot bread was good, but it came with some oil with minced garlic in it; the garlic was yellow and burned. The caesar salad dressing was so oily that it was difficult to eat. We both ordered the salmon picatta; my piece of salmon did not taste fresh and had a lot of dark meat on it. The fish was on an enormous helping of pasta. All of this was just drenched in an oily sauce. If the sauce sat on the plate undisturbed for even a few minutes, it congealed. I couldn't eat even a quarter of this dish because it was so oily.

I've been patiently waiting a month to come here with my best friend and husband. \\n\\nAt 8:30 there was an estimated 30 min wait (turned out to be a 20 min wait) and they will call you, which means you can walk over to ship and anchor and take advantage of their pokestop while you wait. They sat the three of us at the dimly lit bar that faces the window. Slightly awkward, but we did say we wanted first seating available... I just wish they had sat us at the table that was also available outside. \\n\\nHostess was friendly and efficient, our waitress was nice enough, but not very attentive, and made things pretty awkward by standing behind us and waiting while we attempted to figure out what to eat. Mind you, our butts hadn't been in the seats for even 5 min at this point. I didn't read most of the menu, because I felt rushed to tell her what we wanted. Between the time she took our order and asked if we needed the check, she didn't check back in with us once. Another server came to refill my almost empty cup (with no ice left) which he then filled with room temp water. After eating a hot bowl of ramen in a crowded restaurant, an ice water would have been great. \\n\\nThe food... sigh. Some was awful, some was tasty. Overall, it's average, or slightly less than average. Preface: I live 2 mins from Buford Hwy, and I am super spoiled when it comes to Asian food.\\n\\nThe salad was borderline offensive to me, if I am being honest. Green mix was room temperature, and starting to go bad (as in, slimy and mushy). Salad dressing was put in a thick dollop on top and was so intense it was gross. Not a fan at all. I literally ate one bite and put it aside. \\n\\nWe ordered Gyoza and fried Brussel sprouts as appetizers. SO disappointed. The tempura breading on the brussel sprouts was so salty it was almost inedible while the sprouts were raw in the center. Served with no sauce. Disgusting.\\n\\nThe gyoza apparently had a sauce that came with it, that was on our bar in an empty bottle (and because our waitress never came back around to check on us, it never got a refill, so, no sauce for us). The gyoza was slightly burnt, and cooked into one giant brick that when you attempted to separate them, fell apart, leaving the stuffing on one side of the plate, and the wrapper still attached to the brick of gyoza. \\n\\n\\n...and for the ramen.\\n\\nCha cha cha- delicious, thick broth that was reminiscent of a well executed miso soup. The thick noodles were perfectly cooked, egg was perfect and the pork was on point. This is literally the only thing we ordered that I would be back for.\\n\\nJINYA black- Pork was delicious, and I was pretty disappointed to only have two skimpy pieces in my bowl. Noodles, perfectly cooked. Egg, perfectly cooked as well. Broth was thick and sumptous, but nothing to write home about flavor-wise (at least for me). \\n\\nSpicy umami- Noodles cooked well, broth was watery, ground beef didn't taste like there was any additional seasoning to it, apparently this didn't come with an egg, which would have been nice.

Here's my problem with the store: I've been here on four different occasions, and each time I go there I am always encountered with awful service or some mishap in the food. The reception has always been snooty and aloof; one time the (most likely American) lady lectured me about \\"Japanese culture and the importance of sitting down together as one group to enjoy the noodles.\\" The manager, upon hearing my remark that I'm Japanese, quickly put that to a stop. Cultural misappropriations aside, the staff always appear to be harried and show no pride in the restaurant or their service.\\n\\nCertainly I likely shouldn't hold a \\"Japanese\\" ramen shop in the US to a higher standard; but I get the feeling that Santouka corporate in Japan doesn't seem to care about the quality and service of staff that they hire.

I visited Mary Mac's about a month ago on a road trip through Atlanta after researching and asking around for the best fried chicken in the city. Again and again, Mary Mac's came up. The restaurant itself has awards (recent, I might add) from local papers praising the tea room's chicken. From my experience, I can only say that these are all lies. \\n\\nThis was perhaps the most disappointing fried chicken I have ever had. Dry, lukewarm, bland, everything that bad fried chicken aspires to be. Mediocre would be generous. My friends agreed. \\n\\nThe sides were hardly much better. The cinnamon rolls were sold, but the cornbread was dry and pretty flavorless. The collard greens were swimming in water, and the carrots were neon orange and hardly cooked. \\n\\nI'm typically really generous and understanding with my opinions of food. But this didn't taste like the kitchen had an off day. It tasted institutionally bland. \\n\\nThe only saving grace was our waitress, who was everything that Southern Hospitality aspires to be.

Our quest to find a Via 313 pizza led us to Buford's Backyard Beer Garden. The place was packed with football fans watching week 17 NFL games. We luckily found a small table, ordered a couple of drinks, and started watching the games (TVs everywhere). 1st down: half the tables around us were eating pizza and the addictive smell lured me into the boisterous crowd to order a pie. 2nd down: walked all over the crowded bar (a half acre of packed bodies), and got back to our table empty handed. I then asked the couple next to us where to order a pizza...they said in the back. 3rd down: ventured back into the fray and stumbled into a cheering Bears fan with a piece of pie in his hand. I asked where he got it. He responded in true Chicago fashion, \\"Hell, I don't know, my wife bought it\\". 4th down: I started thinking even Indiana Jones would starve here. I pleaded with a waitress for help, and she escorted me to a crowded corner with a small cubby hole located at the front of the line. I finally got to the window and ordered a Detroiter with pepperoni. TOUCHDOWN. Meanwhile, my wife was enjoying the game and considering a call to the Montana Ski Patrol (the # is on her phone from one of my previous adventures) to rescue me. Was the pie worth the effort? You bet. The pizza only comes in one size with 4 hefty slices. It was a very well constructed offering... a thick chewy crust, two layers of pepperoni, lots of cheese, and rows of sauce on the top. The edges had properly caramelized cheese in the Detroit style and proved to be a very good pizza. Highly recommend."},{"name":"Poor Calvin's","address":"510 Piedmont Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"I can't imagine giving Poor Calvin's anything but a 5 star review.

We ordered a fried lobster special with black squid ink pasta, lobster mac and cheese, lobster wontons (noticing a theme here?) lobster friend rice, and a fried cod with peanut sauce (served over a pineapple).   It's actually difficult to put into words the magical symphony that was going on in my mouth with each bite.  And each dish was just as good as the others.

Finally got frustrated, spoke up & come to find out they only have one of my two pies I paid for via credit card ready.  They either spaced the 2nd pie or gave it to someone else.  They offered to make another but the perfection they produce meant waiting at least another 15 minutes.  To be fair to V313 there seemed to be some kind of crisis going on in the trailer as I waited.  Also despite screwing up the guy at the counter totally & immediately owned the apology/resolution.

Blah! Then they brought out some dinner rolls which looked like Hawaiian rolls with some melted butter on top. We passed on the rolls despite our hunger.

Sad, I know. But thanks to a wild hair, I'm happy to say my grasp on ramen has grown. \\n\\nIt's not quite the simple, discardable container meal I once thought it was. No, ramen is meticulously prepared, taking 10 hours to create the flavorful broths with perfectly cooked noodles. And not just any noodle goes with any broth, rather, the noodles are perfectly paired - the heavier & thicker the broth, the bigger the noodle, and vice versa. Most pork-based ramen require a thicker noodle, while the chicken & vegetable versions are accompanied with thin noodles. Then there's the science to getting the noodle consistency just right! \\n\\nBut Jinya is more than just noodles & slurping. They have many Asian-inspired apps, along with rice & quinoa dishes. Some of the menu items are familiar, but most were completely foreign to me. When it came time to order, I went with both known & unknown - I tried the caramelized cauliflower, the spicy tuna mini taco & for the ramen, I rolled the dice & ordered spicy chicken ramen. \\n\\nThe mini spicy tuna taco was amazzzing! Super fresh & just the right amount of zing from the jalapeño. And the cauliflower wasn't bad either. \\n\\nI added the suggested toppings to the spicy chicken ramen - a seasoned egg + chicken soboro. Why I would want an egg in my 'soup' seemed kinda far-fetched to me, but what the hell, it was a suggested topping. \\n\\nThe ramen arrived piping hot and, if I'm honest, a bit intimidating. As someone who doesn't do well with chopsticks, I was nervous I would be a disaster waiting to happen! But to my surprise, it's easy to eat ramen with chopsticks. Whew, disaster avoided! \\n\\n\\"Wow! Hmmm. Interesting.\\" These were my first thoughts on ramen. Followed by, so THIS is what it's supposed to taste like! And, ok, I can see what all the talk is about. For someone who has never had ramen, I'd describe it as a bowl of exotic comfort.

I never order hamburgers at restaurants anymore unless they are known for them, so I took a gamble with this one.  It was good, although I'm not sure it was anything extra special; the friend I split it with didn't care for it at all.

Okay, fine, I understand. We spent approximately 25 minutes WAITING for our order to come out though. I am SURE within those 25 minutes, we COULD have changed our order. A slice of pizza should NOT take long to cook since they probably have some pre-made and they just re-heat it similarly to how \\"More Home Slice\\" does it. I was very frustrated because I felt that we could have changed our order. Everything here is about a \\"20 minute\\" wait. We asked her for ranch and it took a while for that to arrive. I noticed that a lot of the tables around us received their pizza BEFORE our table and some tables even finished eating and left before we even got our pizza. Now I am not sure if there are bias or not, but I was very disappointed in the service.\\n\\nBack to food...it was good pizza. For the price, it was AWESOME! I didn't realize how the \\"pizza by the slice\\" worked, but you can't order every pizza by the slice.

I enjoyed the cab but pinot was not for me.\\n \\nOur server Josh was cool, genuinely didn't\\n mind being our personal photographer (which can get obnoxious) & took pictures of our group. He was very courteous and knowledgable. \\n\\nWe started with the Bone Marrow appetizer..it was simply divine. If I could try to describe an indescribable food, I would use a comparison...so excuse this faux pas but it tasted like the succulent charred fat edges of a Hawaiian Ribeye from Houston's..it was so flavorful, wonderful texture, served with slices of toasted French bread. Also included in the dish was wild mushrooms and what tasted like sliced deserved muscadine or grape.. $15 \\n\\nAfter the yummy bread basket was delivered first and the treat of bone marrow I was in carb heaven. \\n\\nThe birthday girl has a love for French onion soup, so she ordered Coal Roasted Onion Soup. Served with a mini bit of bone marrow like the appetizer on the side and crunchy, chewy croutons sunk in the soup, I almost wished I ordered one for myself.

I prefer to have no constrictions to a single dish, so I took the reins and ordered everything on the menu that sounded interesting or foreign to me. \\n\\nOne of my friends ordered separately due to vegetarian restrictions but went with the Ratatouille dish. We also ordered one for the table. It was rich, flavorful and served with true garlic toast. I found myself nibbling a bite or two more than what's considered bite-size. $18\\n\\nWe also ordered the Bar Steak, coal grilled with fries. I can't even explain how good the fries were..they were perfectly seasoned and some of them were sopping with the liquid from our juicy cooked medium steak. $22 \\n\\nThe juice soaked fries were so delicious I didn't even need ketchup....but I did eat the rest with ketchup...

The duck was excellent and I loved the crispy edges of fat that were salty, and fatty flavor. $29\\n\\n I didn't get much flavor or pizzaz from the sauerkraut but the plums were strangely not what I expected. They absorbed the meats flavor and I surprisingly enjoyed the bizarre flip flop of fruit tasting like meat on my plate.\\n\\nThe last entree was Mississippi Rabbit with Farro Salad. I found the rabbit a lot like chicken, white meat, similar texture, but stringy. It was a bit dry but I enjoyed it nonetheless. The menu said it was served with rabbit liver toast, but I found myself eating something that resembled a sausage. \\n\\n It was tasty but considering its a foreign dish for me, I couldn't tell you whether that was the Rabbit Liver or not. But I liked it much more than the rabbit $26. \\n\\nWe ordered Irish coffees and three desserts to share. 'As the Leaves Turn' was my favorite dessert, it had a thick pumpkin ganache, white chocolate balls with crisps in the middle, dried cranberries and granola served with a small dollop of vanilla bean ice cream.\\n\\n It was crunchy, sweet, different.. I loved it!\\nWe also ordered a 'candy bar' something.. It was much more rich and I wish it had ice cream to balance the super sweetness.

So it's one of the oldest continually operating restaurants in Boston. Who am I to say that they are doing anything wrong with that pedigree? There's nothing wrong with the Union Oyster House ... But there's nothing overly special about it compared to nearby places, except to say that you've been here.\\n\\nThe prices are quite high and while the seafood is fresh, what seafood restaurant in Boston doesn't have fresh seafood? I passed several spots on my way advertising fresh oysters for $1 each but decided to go to Union because it's on my list of spots to try. The oysters at Union are almost $40 per dozen.\\n\\nHonestly, that's about as expensive as I've seen even in cities like Manhattan or Seattle. They had only 2 varieties of oyster, both from Cape Cod which was surprising. Each oyster didn't taste incredibly different (or look different really). What most surprised me was the variety in size of the oysters. Some were tiny and only contained a bit of 'meat' while there were 4 out of the dozen that were what I'd expect for the price.\\n\\nI'd prefer that they pick out more quality oysters to make sure you aren't getting subpar ones mixed in. I always considered Boston to be an oyster mecca ... But have to say that in Seattle most restaurants had 5 to 20 varieties of oysters to choose from and each oyster looked picture perfect.\\n\\nBeyond that, the presentation was sloppy. They were served over ice on a silver tray but there was no horseradish, no pink vinegar and instead of the traditional little individual Tabasco bottles, a big, crusty, communal bottle was used. Also, no seaweed garnish and only two small lemon wedges for a dozen oysters. Cheap! When I asked for horseradish it was brought to me in a clear disposable plastic cup.\\n\\nClam chowder was a bit watery for my liking and VERY fishy tasting and smelling. Not loaded with clams, either at $8 per bowl.\\n\\nSo you have a few different options. You can eat at the popular half moon oyster bar when you first walk in. This has probably been there since the 1800s. It is definitely not for those who don't enjoy eating shoulder to shoulder with strangers ... And it's not a spot you will linger because of the small, wooden stools with offer very little leg room. I'm 6'4 and literally couldn't sit there if I wanted to because my knees don't fit in a sitting position. It does look fun though and the shucker/bartender is quite a character having worked there since the 80s.\\n\\nThere is a bar in the next room which is more of a traditional bar. Not as much atmosphere but much more room to drink and they serve the same food with less of a 'show' watching oysters get shucked.\\n\\nThen there are small booths on the bottom level and the upstairs has a darker and much more colonial looking restaurant. If I had to choose (given that I don't fit at the oyster bar) I'd say upstairs is where I'd request to eat but it's only open for dinner service.\\n\\nRumor has it that this was one of JFK's frequent haunts in Boston (although I think the now closed Loche Ober was the favorite of the Kennedy family.) However one must take this with a grain of salt ... The Omni Parker Hotel claims JFK proposed to Jackie there while a restaurant in Georgetown also claims to have an eyewitness to say it was there. I'm sure the Kennedy family ate here on occasion but whether the booth upstairs with Kennedy plaques literally ALL over it was JFK's booth may or may not be legend. It's well known in the restaurant industry that restaurants often say something famous happened at the least desirable tables to help quiet complainers ... And the 'Kennedy Table' is right next to a busy/loud service bar. Just saying ...\\n\\nOverall you'll enjoy the history and rustic feel of this place. It's cramped, dark, noisy ... All the things you expect from an old fashioned colonial joint. Wood paneling, nautical pictures, a bit drafty. If you are an out of towner you will feel satisfied that you got the true 'Boston' experience here. The seafood is okay ... it's fresh but maybe not great ... And you won't have a bad time here. Especially if you have deep pockets and come from a spot where fresh seafood doesn't happen. (Many of the folks I overheard dining here were midwesterners who had googled the most famous Boston seafood restaurants."},{"name":"A Touch of Earth","address":"North Market, 59 Spruce St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Stumbled across this little gem of a coffee shop while working at a convention down the road.

I've had a few of their different choices of ramen, but I absolutely love their Gankara Miso ramen. The broth is incredibly flavorful, thick and spicy, which is super important to me when I'm eating the ramen.  The type, texture, and chewiness of the noodles are other aspects that I look for, and they have fulfilled all of my wishes for good ramen noodles! I also enjoyed that aside from typically toppings like cha shu pork, scallions and bean sprouts, it already comes with an egg, corn, and tan-tan pork. The additional toppings are reflected in the price but I think it's well worth it (plus the serving is quite huge). Aside from their food, I love that they do pop-ups of restaurants from Japan from time to time. It's a chance to try different flavors and variations of ramen from Japan, and it's an experience that's unique to Ganko compared to other restaurants.

I love this place and make it one of my places to stop when I'm in the ATL. If you can get there as soon as they open at 11 am there is not a long wait. The wait time can be as long as 2 hours. I usually go on a Sunday morning when I go. The service is good and the waiters and waitresses are friendly and attentive. They do have specialty drinks, wines and beers. Mary Mac's serves soups, salads and appetizers , traditional southern specialties, fresh seafood selections, fresh vegetables and sides and homemade desserts. A Southern Special is also on the menu, and is served family style. It's all you care to eat and is dine in only for parties of two or more, no doggie bags. The entire table must choose the Southern Special. With the Southern Special you can choose any 3 entrees, any 3 sides and choose a dessert. I can never do this with my family, because nobody EVER can decide on the same thing! The menu selection is that big. Be aware when giving your beverage order, that not all beverages come with unlimited refills. Soft drinks do have refills, but lemonade and the Arnold Palmer(half tea/half lemonade) only get one refill. To  order your food you're given a piece of paper and a pencil to write down your order. For starters you're given a basket of assorted breads, mini cinnamon buns, yeast rolls and cracklin' cornbread muffins, and for first time visitors they offer a FREE complimentary bowl of pot likker. Pot Likker is the liquid that is left in the pot of turnip or collard greens after they have cooked. It's like a bowl of seasoned soup with pieces of turnip greens in it. I always get this even though it's not my first visit(smile). My favorite out of the bread bowl are the mini cinnamon buns. For those of you who don't know what cracklin' cornbread is, let me enlighten you. A cracklin' is fried pork rind with a small amount of skin attached to it. It is then cooked into the cornbread. Not a favorite of mine, but it does give it an interesting flavor. I'm not a fan of cracklins' and when it's cooked in cornbread it has a chewy texture. What to do with that cracklin cornbread muffin is you crumble it into your bowl of pot likker, if you like it! Make sure not to eat to much bread, you have to save room for your main meal. For an appetizer I ordered the fried green tomatoes with a Parmesan horseradish dipping sauce. They're breaded in a panko and flour batter and they're tender inside and crunchy on the outside. The dipping sauce went well with the tomatoes. For my meal I had the turkey and dressing, mac and cheese and green beans, and for dessert I got the strawberry short cake to go. All of it was so good. Though this was not my first time eating at Mary Mac's it is my first time giving them a review. I suggest to all of my friends that you put Mary Mac's on your list of must try places to eat."},{"name":"The Backspace","address":"507 San Jacinto St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Cute, unpretentious little gem.

The restaurant is somewhat dark and the decor is funky and eclectic with some abstract paintings on the wall and statues.

She knew that thing like the back of her hand. \\n\\nEverything I ordered was delicious, super flavorful, and really creative. I loved the fried goat cheese appetizer. They rolled it in coconut along with kale and mashed potatoes (sounds different but it works) and deep fried it. It's served with three types of sauces - a compote with lavender jelly, Japanese aioli, and a curry mustard. \\n\\nThe fried lobster rice was amazing. It's a really big dish so you can easily get multiple meals out of this. Well worth the $24 in my opinion. The lobster itself was cooked and seasoned to perfection. The rice had these Peruvian sweety drop peppers in them. I'd never heard of them before but I definitely asked the server about them afterwards. They added a nice sweet spiciness to the dish.

I am originally from Philly but my boyfriend is from New Orleans and he lives here. We came here to watch the game and the first half went well. At halftime, I decide that I am ready to go. I PAY MY BILL and use the closest exit to me is closed. I jump the fence closest to me and I proceed to exit alongside my boyfriend. A bouncer stops us and he's like this isn't an exit. At this point I'm a few paces from the car (me and my boyfriend). I understand his approach and I tell him that I paid my bill and I can prove it (receipt in my purse). He continues by saying \\"This isnt New Orleans and you cant do what you want\\"... So tonight, the Falcons are playing the Saints. I am from Philly and I love my Eagles but my boyfriend is rom New Orleans and he has a Saints hoodie and I have on a Saints jersey. So now you are making it personal...which isn't necessary. I tell him we are already outside and that I am sorry but I can prove that I paid my bill....he tells me to go back or go to jail. REALLY?! I AM ABOUT TO GET ARRESTED FOR THIS REALLY? I look at my partner who tells me to just go back over the gate. I climb the gate, and exit through the more \\"appropriate\\" exit. Now, I understand the  exit rules and things of that nature...but when you bring in personal things like the jersey I am wearing, it seems to be a more petty, personal issue and I have a problem with that. The bouncer was rude. Point, blank, period and I treated him with nothing but respect. I won't go here again and I hope these leads to some sort of sensitivity training.\\n\\nNow about the place... I ordered garlic bread and a rum and coke.  The garlic bread was good and so was the drink. But I was so affected by the rude bouncer it ruined my entire experience.

And don't get me wrong...I love doughnuts. I've eaten a lot of them over the years, as my waistline will attest. I've also eaten them in multiple states and in multiple countries. But...I am a Portlander...born and raised. Alas I never discovered Voodoo when it was a little, small bakery. I found it after the behemoth it has become today. Maybe, as some have attested, it was a great shop back in the day. I can only judge it by the experience I had now.\\n\\nI come from doughnut loving parents. I, for a time, lived next to a donut shop owned by a little old lady from Guam. It was a little hole in the wall, but her donut bakery made some amazing old school donuts. He would allow me to pop in just after he filled the case and grab a few. Oh those maple bars, old fashioned...the list goes on. Yummy. They were so good they even survived a Krispy Kreme opening literally across the street. \\n\\nOne night my parents and I decided to venture downtown, late, and try Voodoo. The line wasn't too bad...and we ordered up a pink box filled with a dozen of the various kinds they had so we could sample all the creatively topped treats. The first thing that burned in my memory of my first experience there...the staff were less than friendly. Now perhaps this is part of the whole \\"punk\\" vibe the place goes for...but honestly...there is no place for unfriendly or poor customer service E V E R in a public facing business. This attitude extended to even the person's placement of our donuts in the box. Normally one carefully arranged and places the donuts so they don't get mashed or messed up. You'd think this would be even more so important for a place known for his toppings. Well our donuts were basically just tossed in the box....so much so they were a damn mess when we got them home. And no, I was careful with the box...they are donuts, its sacrilege not to be. ;-)\\n\\nOnce home we went into sampling what we got. Now, like most situations, when something is great it can overshadow waiting or poor service or many things. But when you venture through all that and the end result makes you go \\"WTF?\\" It really makes the whole thing sink. First, I have to say...before you go all nuts on your toppings, designs, etc....you have to have a solid foundation...in this case a solid donut. To me Voodoo fails at this necessary principle. The donuts themselves were old and stale. Like we were subjected to day or two old donuts. No amount of toppings were going to change that. Out of 12 offerings I cannot tell you a single one that was memorable. Not 1. And everyone involved in this adventure felt the exact same way. The toppings should be enhancing an already great donut. Yet in this case, it seems it's all novelty and no substance. In some ways it felt like the toppings were masking a lousy donut. \\n\\nFortunately I discovered a true gem of the area long after my unpleasant experience at Voodoo. A true NW hole in the wall donut shop in Vancouver called Donut Nook. The place looks like you have time travelled when you walk in...but it's funky and inviting. The staff warm and friendly. And the donuts? Well that's the best part. While you won't get Captain Crunch mashed on them or one shaped like a penis with cough syrup drenched on top....you will get some fresh...amazingly flavor-filled donuts here. Ones we easily go back to and talk about all the time.\\n\\nSkip the line...there are much better donuts to be had than Voodoo."},{"name":"The Backspace","address":"507 San Jacinto St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"One of the best pizza crusts I've ever had.

I wanted something vibrant, fun, light, etc.  Andina had it all.  \\n\\nLocated in the Pearl District, if you wanted to do something afterwards, you were within walking distance to pretty much anything.  However, Andia fulfilled our every need.  My wife and I were slightly intimidated by the immaculate menu, but both of our dishes were exquisite.\\n\\nFor starters, we ordered a queso dish and the \\"special\\" appetizer, which was an in-season pepper of some kind.  It was a great recommendation.  The queso dish wasn't for me, but it still had a great range of flavors.  The bread came shortly after with 3 delicious and different sauces, which only enticed our taste buds even more.  For entrees, she got the chicken, and I ordered the salmon.  Both were pleasantly tangy, sweet, and delicious.  The salmon was cooked PERFECTLY with a crispy seared crust on the bottom.  PERFECTO!  For dessert, we also chose the recommended dish, which was a stacked shortbread dessert of some kind, layered with caramel, garnished with a coffee or cocoa ice cream scoop and coffee beans.  \\n\\nThe icing on the cake, was the words Feliz Anniversario! written in chocolate on the plate.  A wonderful, thoughtful, personal touch from the chefs at Andina to us.  An unforgettable night.\\n\\nAlthough the place was packed, the staff made us feel like the only people in the room.

I decided to try out this place, fingers crossed that we could have something substantial. \\n\\nMy entire party is vegetarian (check!) but we don't eat anything in the allium family. That makes it fairly difficult when eating out, but I like to give places a chance. \\n\\nThe place is pretty neat. Stickers plaster the doors and the bathroom stalls feature chalkboard walls complete with chalk for you to leave a message or a doodle. They have indoor and (covered) outdoor seating and countertop seats as well. We came a little after 5 pm on a Sunday and there wasn't a line. We had to wait for a little bit because we needed a high chair but nothing crazy. \\n\\nWe got orange juice and the swamp thing as drinks while we studied the menu. Our waitress was pretty good about everything and even brought out their book of ingredients. Only she got to go through it though. I was told right off the bat that all the beans were off limits along with the sauces and the portobello mushrooms, which are marinated in garlic. Oh, the hash browns are also off limits, which was a serious bummer.\\n\\nWe ended up getting:\\n\\nThe Garden Nachos - no beans, salsa or scallions, pickled jalapeños on the side. Essentially we got a plate full of tortilla chips, some spinach, tomatoes, topped with melted cheese. It was pretty dry when you got past the top layer. The tomatoes were the saving grace. Everything tasted fine individually considering it was missing a lot of items?\\nZucchini and Cheese Migas - regular egg scramble, no fire purée, beans, or onions. I wanted to try the tofu scramble but the recipe is a secret so it's not included in the ingredients binder. Boo. What if someone had an allergy and needed to know?? I liked this one well enough? Definitely missing the salsa because it was slightly dry. I got half a grapefruit as my fruit side, which I liked. \\nOven Cake Breakfast - nothing needed to be taken out! It's your standard cornbread (but with blueberries) with two eggs. They were good but didn't quite knock my socks off. Maybe I should have tried the cornbread without slathering on the syrup and butter to get a real taste of it?\\nBouldin House + Inner Sun Omelets - these were ordered by two other members in our party. It looked pretty standard and I'm guessing it tasted that way as well. However, they did say there was a slight aftertaste of onions even though no onions were in sight. We assume that the pan that was used to make the omelet wasn't properly cleaned in between orders.\\nSwamp Thing - a pretty interesting combination of matcha, emergen-c, and apple juice. Not bad! \\n\\nWhat I got from my visit supports my theory that American vegetarian food uses a lot of onions, garlic, etc. The service was good but I don't think they gave us a discount or even offered substitutes for the fact that most of our food didn't include everything. I could essentially make everything I ate at home. Usually, the secret is in the sauce and sauce, we did not get. \\n\\nAs such, I'd say this place is okay.

In other places, typically you get a black bean patty but here its different. The menu keeps changing seasonally.

Welcome back to Austin, John Mueller!  Even though good ol' Louie doesn't approve, we'll accept you. \\n\\nI had the pleasure of trying this place out in its first week.  Bon appetite!\\n\\nMEAT\\n- Brisket - Move over Franklin.  JMueller's \\"underdog\\" brisket might just challenge the reigning champ.  Personally, I thought the brisket was splendid.  Since I'm a firm believer in fatty brisket, I can favorably attest to the quality marbling that John has in this cut of meat.\\n- Beef Rib - Apparently, Franklin once worked for the Mueller's, but there is one family secret that they never shared with him--the beef rib!  This is probably my favorite meat at JMueller's.  It's incredibly tender for being generally being considered a tougher cut.  Also, the char of the beef rib is what gets me the most.  It's absolutely THINLY crisped.  Pretty much...it's to die for.\\n- Sausage - It's better than average, and also a top sausage in the Austin area.  I would consider it a hybrid between Rudy's and Smitty's/Kreiz in texture.  The filling isn't as loose/oily as the Lockhart gang, but it also lacks as much flavor.  Definitely worth trying for the record.\\n- Pork Ribs -- They were above average, but not the best thing there.  Sorry pork ribs fans!\\n- Dried smoked sausge - This is the cheapest meat on the menu (I don't believe they serve it daily), and yet, it was delicious!  My experience was that it had more flavor than the original sausage and of course a much more dense consistency from the drying.  Good good stuff.\\n- Pork Chop - They don't have this every day, but if you're a chop fan it's worth trying.  I wouldn't recommend it as one of their best meats, but it's not dry--which is something very easy to do with a chop.\\n- Pork Cutlet - Not too bad, but again shouldn't be a focus.  If you're in for a lighter meat, the pork can be an alternative from the turkey.  Again, this cut isn't dry at all, but not get-in-your-face delicious either.\\n- Prime Rib - TIP:  My understanding is that this is only served on Fridays.  I'm looking forward to this cut though.\\n\\nSIDES\\n- Chipotle Cole Slaw - Pretty interesting dish, and it basically packs a punch to your typical slaw.  If you're a slaw fan, you'll be impressed, but it's not to die for.\\n- Squash Casserole - My batch was more oil and cheese than anything--It sounds great, but stay focused on the meat please \\n\\nAll in all, great experience.  They even slice off a small cut of brisket for you to munch on while you wait for your meat to be sliced--just like Franklin's.  Except...Franklin actually learned this trick from the Muellers!  \\n\\n5 stars for quality and variety of meats.  Definitely a master of multiple trades.\\n\\nOnly time will tell if the student (Franklin) has truly surpassed its master.  My personal vote, however, is no.

We agreed and went outside to wait. \\n\\nWhile waiting outside we watched 2 additional groups of three people (same amount as our party) walk in and get seated immediately. Now, obviously the first thought is that they must have had reservations. That notion was squashed when one party asked us about the restaurant outside and we ranted and raved about how good it was. That 2nd party of three people decided to give it a try and we jokingly said, \\"see you soon.\\" To our surprise, we didn't see them soon as they were seated immediately. \\n\\nIt was at this point that we just didn't want to waste a minute more with this place.

It was a short wait, and we had the added benefit of seeing the city of Portland awake before our eyes (complete with a street resident emerging from a tipped newspaper dispenser).  When we stepped inside, we were impressed by the multi-colored decorations about the store and the trays upon trays of donuts behind the counter.  It is definitely a festive environment.\\n\\nOne thing that I can really vouch for Voodoo is the variety of donuts.  Each type of donut looks completely different from one another, so when you choose, there's a feeling that you could be missing out on a potentially tasty gold mine.  We ended up going for the voodoo dozen, (a cheaper alternative to selecting a dozen yourself), and set out on our day.  \\n\\nNow here's the kicker: while it was fun to pick from the box throughout the day, I can't say there was a time when we would rave about Voodoo after eating a donut.  They taste like what they look like: donuts with some added pizzazz.  Their components taste great on their own.  Together?

Of the 4 times, 2 were really really good and two were just shy of awful.  The xiao long bao and the shanghai pork and shrimp noodles have always been super good. Never let me down.  Unfortunately, that can't be said about the sautéed Chinese greens or the garlic eggplant with tofu and peas.  First couple of times the greens were just amazing and original.  Lots of flavor and crunch.  The last time they were so watery and limp that they were basically flavorless.  The eggplant and tofu was my favorite at first, just such an original dish.  The eggplant soaked up the good flavors and the tofu was the lighter airy kind that did not overpower with too much density.   The last time I had it, the garlic was cooked so hard you could not taste it and any actual flavor was drowned in a bland oily mess. I remember the day that it was the worst was Saturday mid day.  Best meals for us were nighttime. \\n\\nOverall its frustratingly inconsistent.   Amazing when you hit the right day but super disappointing when you don't.

I recommend this as a first course, and that's how they're going to bring it out to you, most likely.\\n\\nKABOCHA SQUASH - Our second dish. This was much more subdued than I thought it would be, given that horseradish is the first ingredient listed for this choice. It was nice, but it was my least favorite dish of the night. I enjoyed the squash paired with the beets and hazelnuts, but I found myself scraping the bottom of the bowl wanting more horseradish. I think you can pass on this one and choose something better.\\n\\nFRITES - Came out with the chicken thighs, and I'm so glad they did. Paired with the thighs as a main dish, they were perfect. I couldn't have enough. On their own, they would be delicious, but with the chicken thighs, they're extra awesome. I loved dipping them in the cacciatore sauce, and I'm pretty sure anyone who likes fries with ketchup would love this upgraded arrangement, too. If you like fries, you're gonna love these no matter what, so, go with them if you're feeling that for your evening.\\n\\nCHICKEN THIGHS - Divine. I loved the zing in the sauce, and found this dish to be a standout for sure. Bold and hearty flavors make for much satisfaction, and paired with the frites, I was in heaven. I recommend this dish if you're feeling spicy and acidic flavors for dinner; you'll be delighted, as I was.\\n\\nOverall, I highly recommend Launderette. Service was prompt and attentive, the vibe was on point and very cool, and the food was excellent. Prices are on point, as well, for what's on offer here, in my opinion. Come here for what's sure to be a great dining experience in a trendy, yet cool, setting."},{"name":"Scales 925","address":"30 Ivan Allen Blvd, Ste 125","city":"Atlanta","stars":"2.5","text":"Where do I begin? Let's start with the highlights of my experience there. There are NONE! \\n\\nI was invited to this establishment to support a friend who was singing this particular night. The trouble began when they seated us in the back of the bus, even though we had tickets for a table up front. Auntie Pearl didn't seem to believe we actually had tickets and snatched the phone out of my friends hands and told her \\"no this can't be right. You're name isn't even on here\\". The names were at the top of the ticket. Basically we were stuck in the overflow section. \\n\\nNext, the service was EH at best. It took 35 minutes to get my cocktail and then another 30 to just get my appetizer. When orders did come out, the waiter didn't even know what table had what item. They had to ask each table in that area if they ordered this item. I'm like wow, get it together. The staff was all over the place. No one was on the same page. \\n\\nLast issue is the ambiance of the place. If you are not in the main area of the restaurant, don't expect the best. They gave us plastic water cups and on the table was a melted candle with ash in it. I saw what seemed to be a manager of some sort, scraping food off the table cloth just so she wouldn't have to change it. Our silverware was dirty and the food was warm. \\n\\nI will not be returning back to the overrated circus tent. I refuse to be tricked out of my money for something I can do 10 times better at home.

We walked in and were turned down because we did not have a reservation. We understood. So, we called for a reservation on our anniversary.  On our way down there was massive traffic delay. We were going to be at least 30 minutes late.  I called to cancel  because of being late for brunch and our show at the Fox.  The receptionist asked how late and I told her.  She said she could accommodate us. Also, i told her we had show tickets and we did not want to be late.  She said it would be fast and to come.  So we continued on. When we arrived the receptionist asked if we had a reservation. I said yes, and that we were late but I did talk to someone.  A heavy set white lady overheard what I said and came in begin to tell me the computer kicks people out if they are more than 15 minutes late. I begin to tell her that I called and before I could tell her that the host said it was ok to be 30 minutes late and she would accommodate me, she cuts me off and points to the other host and says you talked to her. The smaller host begins to say something and stops. The rude host turns her back says well let me see if I can fit you in. She tells me she has a table but that we have to be finished within a hour and forty five minutes. Once again we had to be done in an hour to make the show.  I did not say anything, it seemed to be a waste with this woman.  I hope she is not the owner, it would be a shame to have her represent such a gem of a place.   She needs to know what her coworker has told the customer. \\n\\nOne star for the for the wait staff. They were attentive and very thorough. \\nOne star for the fast service and the quantity of the food.  \\nOne star for the food. It was great!  My son had the pineapple fried rice. It came in a carved out pineapple. It had large shrimp with rice overflowing out it. My wife had the shrimp, sausage in grits. It was creamy and delicious. I had the fried chicken. It was a perfectly fired chicken breast in a shape of a flat pancake. It came with Lobster Mac and cheese, snap peas, crispy kale. Needless to say i cleaned the plate. The adjacent table ordered the same meals and they all took the leftovers. My wife and I finished our meals and our son's. Our portion size is way too large, so we were able to finish everything and have room for desert.  We are usually left hungry but not here.  So thumbs up with the portion size. \\n\\nI would have given Poor Calvin's 5 stars but I had to take away 2 for the rude receptionist.  Need to work on personal skills.  Would I go back?  Yes.

So, I ordered the 4 piece fried chicken, collard greens and rice and gravy. The chicken was decent, just not enough seasonings, the greens weren't good at all, no flavor at all, had to put pepper and a tap of sugar and still nothing, rice and gravy can't really mess that up, so that was good, well the gravy was good. Hubby had fried trout, mac n cheese potato salad, and baked beans. Fried trout was good, mac n chesse was ok, and so was potato salad, thank goodness for salt, pepper and sugar. We also ordered peach cobbler, that was ok as well, not as juicy as I like, but decent. The service and the atmosphere was Great. I loved seeing all people in there eating it was good to see.

The pork chop was very thick and the restaurant doesn't give you a steak knife to cut it with. I was cutting a hard pork chop with a butter knife. It was very dry and also had so seasoning.

No pretentious attitude here.\\n\\nIt's been a while since I went to a fine dining restaurant so with only one glass of wine at the table I must admit to initially being fazed by the nearly-$100 (before tip) cheque. The location just didn't add up to fine dining pricey-renovation-ambiance but the food was competitive and prices aren't hidden on the online menu.\\nI might be tempted to ding them for price, except that their portions are actually NOT skimpy, unlike fine dining places, especially those that suggest you order to share (e.g., Nightingale, being one of my more recent dining experiences).\\n\\nGet there half an hour early to be first in line. They seat only full parties so doesn't matter who's first -- just be ready first. On a cold Saturday night my friend and I were second in line but first seated because our entire party of two were already there.\\n\\ngreen salad, chestnuts, pecorino & date vinaigrette ($15)\\n-Tastes better than it looks. Remember to look under the veggies for chestnut chunks.\\n\\ncrispy polenta, chicken liver ragù & piave ($18)\\n-For an appy the portion you get is a light meal in the two big chunks of polenta. Together they are about the volume of a cube of tofu.\\n-The polenta is white and creamy on the inside, fun and crispy on the outside (ours came served nicely hot).\\n-Polenta is very bland so make sure to pair each bite with the liver. Liver itself is not strongly bitter or pungent so it's ok on its own, but it's nicer to have the flavour tempered a bit more with the polenta.\\n-I would personally have preferred the polenta chunks to be further divided into half thickness as I found the thickness combined with the creamy softness a bit unwieldy, like eating a thick porridge with a fork and knife.\\n-Overall taste is OK unless you happened to get too many bland bites.\\n\\npappardelle, kale & oyster mushrooms ($26)\\n-My friend's order and I did get to just try a sample.\\n-Good-sized portion!\\n-Lovely texture to the pasta.\\n-Minced anchovy (?) added a nice flavour without being too dominant.\\n\\nraviolo all'uovo & porchetta ($25)\\n-Portion is actually decent because there's an amount of veggie and porchetta under that single huge ravioli that hides an egg with soft yolk.\\n-The idea as conveyed to us by our server was to cut the ravioli and let the eggy goodness ooze out into the dish. There was some oozing but not as much as I had anticipated. I think I should have maybe dug out the remaining egg and cheese and mixed it into the veggies, but separately the dish was fine.\\n-Very flavourful vegetables. Looks like it's swimming in olive oil but there wasn't a sense of oiliness when I ate it.\\n-The veggies were very flavourful so that nudged this up from okay to tasty.\\n-When I asked for what was weird on the menu, this was one of the nominees (the other being crispy tripe and tripe just isn't that weird to me so I passed on that).

We were seated right away, having arrived right at our reservation time, so no problem there.  However, we may have well waited 10 minutes for a table because that's how long it seemed we were sitting before we got any service from anyone.  It took a while to get a server to come and take drink orders, give us bread and take appetizer orders.  We then gave a drink and appetizer order, and the appetizer came within a reasonable time, but the drinks didn't come until the appetizer was almost finished.  Then when our dinner came, I was ready for another drink to accompany the dinner, and that drink didn't come until after I was almost finished with my dinner.  I had to wait and let my dinner sit a little and get cold just so that I would still have some dinner left when my drink arrived.  Then to top it all off, they have a ridiculous set up with valet parking where there was a group of about 25 patrons outside in an unorganized group waiting to give their tickets to a valet at the same time that the valets were trying to handle a large group of incoming patrons in the same parking aisle.  It must have taken about 15 minutes at least to get our car.

He responded with \\"You did not get here at 7:00 - I keep track of everything, I saw you sit down at 7:05.

Overall, average Korean food that does not really sit itself apart from others in the city. My group of friends also were mostly Japanese, and Korean so I took their feedback pretty seriously. They were not all overly impressed with everything. It was not all bad, some dishes were good but some basic ones just missed the mark.\\n\\nPros:\\nThey tend to accommodate big groups very well especially on weekdays. Open parking as it is in a strip mall right across from Micro Center on busy Bethel road.\\nService was ok. Not overly friendly. They did refill the sides when asked. \\n\\nCons:\\nSome flavors were bland and dry. The stone pot was dry and overcooked. Pancakes were ok. Japchei Ok. I have had better. \\nSome dishes were more watery when they were supposed to be more solid with heavy sauce instead of soup-like. \\nThe menu is on the pricier side, which is pretty steep for average food. \\n\\nOverall, if you happen to be in the area in the mood for some Korean BBQ, stop by, might be worth a visit. It might depend on who's cooking your meal that day or how busy they are. Not sure. I wouldn't go back unless a group of friends suggests going back.

Although the wait was long we had heard great things about the restaurant and food and were willing to brave the wait time.

We called the restaurant to let them know we were still waiting after and hour, and when would our table be ready.  They now told us it would be another hour.  As we had cocktails in a lovely restaurant down the street, it was now over two hours since we had put our name on the list.   We called again to check on our table, this time they told us it would be another hour and a half, which amounted to over a 3 1/2 hour wait, which was absolutely ridiculous for anyone to wait for any restaurant.  I have visited the finest restaurants throughout the world and have never been treated so disrespectfully by the hostess and employees at Ask for Luigi restaurant in Vancouver.

When I got there I was already at the end of the line and the couple behind me had to wait like 45 mins and it wasn't even 5:30 yet. So, I was glad I got a table but if you plan on going during dinner time like 6ish 7 or something then expect to wait for about an hr to 2 hrs. Though you can leave your phone number down and when your table is ready they will text or call you. Which is pretty cool. At least they are being considerate. Then again they don't even have a waiting space for people. So, it's not like you can stand or sit and wait. \\n\\nThe place on the outside looks like it's a house located at the corner of the street. It's interesting to find it situated there because its not exactly gastown area. The inside of it looks like a small little restaurant. You can pretty much see the kitchen when you walk in. You can for sure smell the food when you walk right in. I suggest that you sit close to the windows if you want to take nice pictures of your food because it can be quite dark towards the center of the place. \\n\\nThe food was pretty good but it didn't exactly wow me. That's exactly why I gave them a 4 star instead of 5. I mean ya I like my plate of spaghetti with ling cod 'bolognese' & clams. The spaghetti was really fresh and yes you can tell the difference. I got lots of clams on my plate so it made me felt pretty good to be paying 20.00 for it. The sauce was good too. It was a tomato base one. \\n\\nService wasn't exactly there. I felt the server or waitress spent more time on tables that ordered more than just a plate of pasta. Which i totally understand because their bill will be bigger. This indirectly means she'll get a bigger tip too. But lets be a bit more fair here. We're her customers too so we should get the same service like everyone else does. But then again when is life fair?\\n\\nAnyways, overall i would suggest people to try this place out. It's good for a pasta place but don't expect too much service if you're not ordering much. Their menu is alright in variety wise. Enough for anyone to choose from. You also get what you pay for."},{"name":"Banjo Coffee","address":"38 N Avondale Rd, Ste B","city":"Avondale Estates","stars":"4.5","text":"I can't speak of the hot coffee since I'm a diehard cold brew fan.

I am not a fan of chain restaurants nor am I a fan of steakhouses as my Lady can cook the best steak I ever have eaten, consistently and we can be assured that ours are exactly like we want, every time. So, I do not now go to places like LongHorn Steakhouse chain as I am retired. However, yesterday, the Lady was driving, I was dealing with terrible insurance issues and in a foul mood and I said that she could pick anywhere she wanted. I had no idea we were coming here until she pulled into the parking lot.\\n\\nThis was our fist time here. We were met at the door and immediately seated. Charles was our waiter and showed up at the table a moment later with menus and drink requests. Since we were driving and trying to do financial chores, no booze was appropriate. Tea and Lemonade for us. He was back very shortly with the drinks and said a fresh batch of their bread was just coming out of the oven and would get us one of those. We were not ready to order, so instead of just standing there, trotted off to the kitchen and came back with right out of the oven bread.\\n\\nThe Lady selected a lunch size Beefsteak Tomato & Bacon Salad ($5.49) that comes with a Raspberry Vinaigrette, but she substituted Ranch Dressing. I asked if they were able to do a rare hamburger and Charles affirmed that they could (yeah! Not poser processed meat for a thick burger which requires cooking all the flavor out!). I immediately ordered the Steakhouse Burger ($9.29) which comes with a side of spiced fries. Charles let me know that he could substitute any side if I so desired, but I was good.\\n\\nIn about 10 minutes the food showed up and I took a couple of photos. The Lady said she loved the salad, it was crisp, fresh and not overly sauced. I cut my burger in half and it was cooked perfectly for a rare, thick burger and even took a photo of that. The burger was served on a brioche bun. Brioche, for me, is a bit dry but is really good for cooking. I felt it distracted from an excellent tasting meat and fixings. When Charles came by I made a mention about that and he insisted on letting the manager on duty know. I asked a lot of questions and was surprised to find out he had only been working there for a week but was able to answer everything except 1 question. This is something unusual these days.\\n\\nThe Manager, a lady named Katie, came out of the kitchen where she had been working with the people in the back of the house, cutting steaks, and sat down. We provided our input and asked a number of questions of her about the food etc. I showed her the picture of the burger cut in half and how it was cooked exactly how I requested. She said that the person who had cooked the burger was named Fernando. You can request that specific people take care of you or your orders if they are working that day. We discussed things like the Brioche and never was their effort to explain \\"comments away\\".  We were happy and told her so.\\n\\nNext time I would most likely order the burger with no bread as the flavor of the meat with cheese, lettuce and tomato would work well for me.\\n\\nSurprised I was and also a happy camper."},{"name":"Seize the Bagel - Hazel Dell","address":"9904 NE Hwy 99","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4.5","text":"I love this place, I try to stop and get bagels and cream cheese a couple time a month for myself and my coworkers.

I went there a couple weeks ago with a friend, and ended up walking out after having a beer and one piece of sushi from the belt. It was obviously old, and while we were there we saw the sushi chefs preparing all the next days sushi! Gross. Not to mention the server only stopped by one time, was not friendly (she actually scoffed at me when I asked if they had a miller.. what the hell?) and we had to take our own plates up to the front to explain what we had ordered since our waitress was nowhere to be found. Sad to say it because I had many great experiences in the past, but I won't be back. I'd rather pay a little more for something really good then get 'bargain' sushi that is made days in advance.

The location downtown is great, easy to find, yet parking is tight and pretty limited on the street...although there are quite a few pay lots nearby.  Service was fantastic, wait staff was very attentive and friendly.   The food was great, a gormet feel (smaller portions).  I had scallops with potatoes, and it was very tasty.  The facilities are small, an intimate feel, with great windows.  The only negatives were that due to the size, the tables did feel a bit tight together, and the noise level was decently high as a result.  Overall, it was a great meal and experience, and I would definitely recommend."},{"name":"Poor Calvin's","address":"510 Piedmont Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Decided to host my birthday dinner here due to the great reviews. This place is amazing! I'm so disappointed that I can't bring it back to Austin with me. For one, the service is 10 stars! Every server has their own style, flair and full of personality. I love when individuality is encouraged in the workplace. I encourage everyone to start off with the small bites. The seafood here is the freshest I've ever tasted and it's cooked to perfection. We had the lemongrass mussels. I was blown away by the taste! It comes with 2 slices of Texas and trust me, you're going to need it for the sauce! I had the seafood curry. I was craving something sweeter and this was the perfect dish! I decided to pair it with the brown rice and I'm so glad I did. I also tried the Seafood Melange and I know for a fact that it's next on my list when I revisit. If you're looking for something with a bit of spice but packed with seafood, you'll enjoy this dish! Please don't forget to top off this experience with a desert! The pound cake with the fresh bananas, caramel, and strawberries....my goodness! I should've got it to go!

The veal could be cut with the side of your fork and mashed celery root with sauce was paired excellently. I'd never had celery root was I was worried but it's very similar to mashed potatoes. The prime rib was excellent too but I preferred the veal. The gnocchi was creamy and the squash was cooked to perfection.

During this time, there are several individuals standing along the walls and common areas just waiting to be seated.  It reminded me of those Russian bread lines from the 80's.   We were finally seated around 7:00 pm and placed our order.   The furniture is very dated with scuffed, uneven chairs and tables that are covered with vinyl table cloths.  The dishes are plastic and probably original to the building.  From this landmark restaurant, I would have expected much more.  However, this restaurant was chosen by the \\"Birthday Girl\\" and you can never (openly), question that choice.\\n\\nWe are provided bread baskets which consist of cinnamon rolls, savory corn muffins and yeast rolls.  Nothing in this basket was edible because they ALL were cold, dry and hard.  We were given approximately 6 plates for the table but I was tired of waiting for the waitress to reappear so I looked around and found a buffet server at the rear of the room.  I retrieved additional bread plates and extra napkins that are kept in the center drawer, (just so you'll know) and served the remainder of the table.  It took forever for us to get our drinks and even longer for the food.  \\n\\n Before we get to the food, let's talk about the building.  It is quite old but cool.  It has that former funeral home vibe just by the way it is designed and appointed.  It has exposed ceilings which are one of my favorite architectural features.\\n\\n  Now, I am all about old buildings but if you are going to re-purpose an old building for public use, you need to upgrade the bathrooms and make sure they are ACCESSIBLE!.   While waiting to be seated, I went to the ladies room and watched this woman in a wheelchair struggling to get into this narrow stall with her wheelchair.  She was only able to do so with stranger assistance and after removing the leg supports.   I actually watched her hop around on one leg to try and maneuver into this stall.  I'm really annoyed at this point.  I return to the hallway to continue waiting but eventually go back in to check on the customer, (because it is apparent that she cannot exit this bathroom without assistance).  I walk in and she is balancing on one leg in the stall struggling to get the leg supports back on the chair.  I assist her with getting in the chair, washing her hands and exiting.  \\n\\nCan you even imagine how humiliating it must be to not be able to go to the bathroom independently and to have to depend on strangers for assistance?.   While I did not mind helping this lady at all and would do this for anyone, I just worried about her feeling embarrassed.  She had a warm, gracious and appreciative attitude the entire time and took it all in stride.  The point I would like to make is that this should never happen to anyone and if there is an accessible bathroom in this building, it should be CLEARLY IDENTIFIED AND MARKED BECAUSE DURING THE ENTIRE TIME, I NEVER SAW ANY INDICATION THAT THIS WAS AN ACCESSIBLE BUILDING!  Please get it together Mary Mac!\\n\\nBack to the food, I ordered the turkey and cornbread dressing, cranberry sauce, turnip greens and sweet potato soufflé.  I was really concerned about the food being salty, greasy or overcooked.  I knew that the greens would be most forgiving if overcooked so I chose them as my vegetable.  The cornbread dressing was really more of a white bread stuffing that tasted like it had been passed through a blender.  I tasted no celery, onion, cornbread, sage, thyme or texture.  The turkey was fine, nicely cooked, not salty or dry but definitely not carved from the bone as it was lightly pressed.  The cranberry sauce was weird.  I like a fresh homemade sauce with whole berries, not the canned jellied variety.  The yams were fine but did not need the marshmellow topping and the turnip greens were perfectly seasoned and tasted great.\\n\\nThis experience explains why I NEVER eat traditional southern foods away from my own kitchen, it just does not measure up.  The food was just not the quality that I am accustomed to eating.  I also noticed that many of the other veggies, (okra, broccoli, green beans), were very overcooked and my husband's mashed potatoes tasted as if they were mixed with instant.  Unacceptable!. \\n\\nNo, I don't imagine that I will ever return to Mary Mac's Tea Room because the restaurant wasn't special enough to justify the wait, noise level, inadequate service, and overall experience.  My husband visited a few years back during the lunch hour and found the wait and service to be much more reasonable, although the food was unremarkable.  Still SMH over some of these reviews!\\n\\nThis review was written by a \\"born and bred\\" southerner who has been cooking since forever!

There from beginning to end with just the right amount of attention.  There were small touches that made the night sweet.  There was the happy birthday message on the menu for my friend, and the offer of readers for her, since she left her glasses at home and could not see.  \\n\\nI enjoyed most of the food.  We ordered some items that were popular in the reviews:  Spanish Octopus, Shrimp A La Plancha, Redfish, Hushpuppies, Fried Rice, Roasted Mushrooms, Smoked Fish Chowder. I will agree that the food is pricey, so know that.  \\n\\nThe octopus was really good, lightly fried and cradled in harissa, which was cooled with a bit of yogurt. It deserves the accolades that it gets.  \\n\\nAlso delicious:  the Shrimp dish.  Spicy and messy (because your fingers need to peel the shrimp after you dig it out of the sauce), but very good once you get that perfect bite of shrimp with the toast and sauce.  \\n\\nThe Redfish was the star of the meal.  OMG! Cooked to perfection and the accompaniments made it just sing.  I won't forget it. \\n\\nI must acknowledge that the fried rice was also very good and had my taste buds singing. Be sure to hit it with the lime before digging in.   The roasted mushrooms were good also.  \\n\\nThe one thing I did not enjoy at all was the chowder.  I am certain that there was no fish in it.  I searched and I searched and I searched.  No fish, no smokey flavor.  However, I did not alert my server to this flaw and I regret that I didn't.  I really should have kindly let her know that my bowl of soup had no fish in it.  Anyway, it just sat there looking exactly as it did when she sat it down on the table.  Oh well.  \\n\\nOn this occasion, we opted not to indulge in oysters.

I had been wanting to try King+Duke, as I am a huge fan of JCT plus I was ecstatic to see this primo Buckhead real estate back in business.  We were a skosh early for our reservation, but were still seated right away.  In some ways, it was a bummer because we didn't get to enjoy the bar, but no worries - we'll totally be back.\\n\\nKing+Duke offers a similar menu experience to what you would find at restaurants like Miller Union, Cakes & Ale, and Watershed.  I sometimes find these restaurants frustrating because I can often make their menu items at home for far less money and with just as good as quality (boohoo, Miller Union pork tenderloin, I'm looking at you).  King+Duke, however, has that certain something that can't be found in my backyard - the je ne sais quois that I can't place a name to, but just makes for a delightful, perfect dining experience.  \\n\\nThe wine list/drink menu is in a book.  Fun!  They were out of a couple wines we wanted, but I really enjoyed the vinho verde they offered by the glass.\\n\\nOMG, the popovers.  I almost died.  So crusty, buttery, yummy warmness.\\n\\nWe settled on three appetizers:  deviled eggs, fried quail, and the roasted bone marrow.  All three were heavenly, but man, the bone marrow was worth writing home about.  I've had bone marrow before, but yowsers, this takes the cake!  The mushroom salad with the short rib marmalade just make this an absolute \\"MUST\\" order when you visit here.  And, if you're like me and have two labradors waiting at home, well, you can put the bone in a doggy bag and make their day!  And fact:  I have never made bone marrow in my home and don't intend to anytime soon....\\n\\nI would have totally split \\"The King\\" with my hubby, but $75 for a 2.2 lb bone-in ribeye seemed extreme, especially when bone-in ribeyes were on sale at publix for $6.99/lb that same day (and my hubby grills up an amazing steak).  \\n\\nI got the burger, and honestly?  I was a bit disappointed.  It was overcooked and the bread wasn't that great (boohoo), but they did top it with yummy gruyere for me and the fries that came with it were tasty.\\n\\nHubby's \\"rabbit four ways\\" was also delish.  The sausage and rabbit pate were to die for, but the other two rabbit ways were a skosh oversooked.  Still yummy though.\\n\\nThe bar steak was steak frites.  Not incredibly fancy, but still good.  \\n\\nThe overall by-far winner was the trout - perfectly cooked, light, flavorful yummy trout.  I'm sure more dishes like this will pop up as King+Duke finds its groove.\\n\\nDessert was impossible to pass up.  We had the three milks, which was insanely light and delicious.  This plus a glass of vinho verde could have been my dinner!  Is that sad?  The black forest is super impressive if you like chocolate.\\n\\nService was absolutely delightful.

Ever known of a manager to approach a female customer in a threatening manner as if he would throw her too?  He did. He is troubled and should be fired.  He is a deterrent to River Bar.  I have spent thousands at River Bar and will make sure my colleagues and I do not return as long as he is employed there."},{"name":"Don Dario's","address":"8801 S I H 35","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"The rustic atmosphere and our waiter is why I chose to give it two stars. Other than that, I'm sure the alcohol can enhance this flavorless or much too salty food.\\n\\nDon't order the cabrito. If you're going to place this delicate meat on the menu, learn to do it right. You could have had your cooks learn much from the long gone El Gallo chefs. If you're gonna do anything, do it right. Don't serve rocks and pass it off as cabrito.\\n\\nI was told they do homemade tortillas and yes.....those machines will fool you if you're foolish but I make homemade tortillas so I'm not easily fooled.\\n\\nI will say their corn tortillas were delicious. The music was playing softly for a Friday night. Women were strolling in for the patio.

Wait times can be horrendous, but luckily for us, we only wait about 30-40 minutes. They are quite established in that many 'famous' people have tried them and visited them. In the waiting area (hallway), you can see different photos of different people and it's amazing at who have been there. Aside from that, they have dining areas sectioned off into different named rooms such as Ponce Room. Definitely a flair and a very different feel when you enter. It has an old-timey feel Southern feel to it that I haven't experienced much of. After leaving your name, your name will be called via the public announcement system that travels in the hallway and outside street of the restaurant. Amazingly, we do not hear them in the rooms we dined in. To be noted, once you hear your name, you have practically less than a minute to get there before they announce your name again for last call. Be quick or you'll have to wait again!\\n \\nService-wise, very Southern hospitality and very welcoming. Our server was very jovial and very kind. A classy view of southern hospitality and dining I would say.\\n \\nOrdering system - instead of giving your order to the waiter/waitress, you fill out a paper with your listed options and submit them. Not a bad choice in ordering system to avoid any mistakes in order.\\n \\nAmbiance - Surprisingly, the inside is moderately well kept with the old-timey feeling to it. Some walls has murals so it feels slightly modernized, but nothing over the top fancy or makes you feel under-dressed if you come in wearing jeans and a t-shirt.\\n \\nFood - while decent, nothing over the top or amazing to write home to. The complementary rolls are nice and fluffy. Their cornbread are cracked (guessing fried), their yeast rolls are fluffy, and the cinnamon rolls are not overly sweet. Quite nice to have as starters. They have a decent variety of food with some friendly options for vegetarians. For me, I was not sure what their 'souffle' meant and it's essentially the ingredient mixed with breadcrumbs - at least that's what the server explained to me. Not appetizing to me, but it might be that restaurant's thing to do or Southern concept. I ended up getting a 3 piece chicken drumstick with dumplings and collard greens as my sides. Interesting how 1 chicken breast is considered equivalent to 3 drumsticks. The drumsticks weren't bad. Pretty succulent and you can taste the chicken behind it. Could use a little bit more seasoning and the skin was on the crispier side of things. The collard greens and dumplings were average at best in my opinion. The collard greens didn't taste like it was cooked with any other flavor/seasoning. Purely tasted like it was chopped and boiled until it was tender/over-tender. The dumplings were at least fully cooked and soft. But the soup/gravy that came with it was on the watery side and lacked flavor. On the side, we did try their fried green tomatoes as well as their deviled eggs. The fried green tomatoes are interesting and reminded me of eating fried bell peppers minus the pepper's distinctive taste. The horseradish sauce accompanying the fried green tomatoes is on the creamy side and less on horseradish. Worth a try, but I'm okay after trying it once. The deviled eggs were appetizing, but nothing to write home about either. Lastly, for dessert, we had the peach cobbler a la mode. Not bad and I like how the crust was still flaky. The filling was sweet and was complemented fairly well with the vanilla ice cream. Each didn't overpower another in terms of sweetness and made it overall delectable to have.\\n \\nOverall, decent food at a nice setting with Southern hospitality. If anything, worth a try to get a Southern hospitality feel. Since I can't tell if it's authentic Southern comfort food, I cannot vouch for that. However, I believe it has its roots in it, but the quality has changed overtime to suit the needs the restaurant and changing times.\\n\\nSide-notes: cleanliness is a slight issue. The bread plates as well as some bowls used to serve the sides and desserts were dirty or had residual food on them. They do clear it off and clean it, but displeasing to find. A table behind us, a lady barely touched her food and was going on a rant to the server how the food quality is fairly sub-par and needs to change. The server was very kind to listen and answer politely. Pretty sure the lady's meal was comp'ed in the end."},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"I honestly felt like voodoo was super overrated after hearing all the hype and standing in line for far too long.

We arrived around 11:15-11:30am and it was already packed however we didn't have to wait long though, maybe 10 minutes. Most of the menu items seemed pretty limited to typical breakfast items like omelettes, sausage, eggs, etc. They do have some specialty items that were featured on DDD like the chicken and gravy biscuit which is hugggeeeeee!! I of course settled for something I knew I could consume which was the Lobster Benedict; eggs scrambled. It was sooooo tasty! I ate 75% of it and took the rest home which I devoured shortly after.

I was only in Portland for 4 days total, and had to come here at least twice for breakfast. They have multiple locations called Broder Nord and Border Soder that sell very similar things that I would love to try next time I'm back. \\n\\nFirst time, we got the Baked egg scramble with bacon, smoked Gouda, and scallions ($11) . Uunipuuro (baked oatmeal with berry compote) ($9). I would highly recommend both dishes. The BAKED EGG SCRAMBLE was served hot on a personal sized griddle and was so extremely fluffy!! The ingredients inside went to well with each other and the flavors were very balanced. I can not recommend this dish enough! \\n\\nThe UNNIPUURO (baked oatmeal) was also incredibly delicious. The seasonal compote was rhubarb which had a sweet/tart flavor that wasn't too overwhelming and complimented the oat patty. The baked oatmeal was crunch on the outside and soft/dense on the inside. It was a great match to eat with the baked eggs. Would recommend as well! \\n\\nOn our second trip, we got the Æbleskiver (danish pancake) ($11). Broder bord ($15). ÆBLESKIVER was absolutely amazing! Super soft and fluffy and has great taste. The batter itself has a slight sweetness but it went so well with the lemon curd and the berry jam. So delicious!! \\n\\nThe BRODER BORD was the most disappointing dish we got here. It was essentially a cheese board that had some cheese, smoked salmon, crackers, bread, yogurt+granola, beet marinated egg, and some cookies. It was definitely not worth $15 and was not that special. All the food is also cold so not ideal for cold Portland mornings. If you are here on a hot day for a light afternoon tea style snack, this might be the dish for you. \\n\\nInterior/other notes: the place is pretty small with about 25 seats available at a time including the bar.

The only drawback is Mary Mac's is so popular -- but that's because of their quality -- because there is usually a long wait at peak times.  But the service is great, so there are no worries once you're seated.  So I suggest you come with patience and an empty tummy.  You will leave very full, and very glad you came. \\n\\nWhile you're there, take time to read up on the history of the place, and take a look at all the pictures and memorabilia.  Wonderful stuff."},{"name":"MidiCi","address":"463 Assembly Row","city":"Somerville","stars":"3.5","text":"The review is for take out order. I live close by and I usually order the food to go.

I had booked the reservation through open table. In the \\"special request\\" section I stated that tonight was a special occasion and requested a table next to the window. Upon arriving, we were yelled at by the door henchman for going straight to the hostess station. When we told him, we had a reservation he said \\"You get in that line even with a reservation\\". This being our first time at Top of the Hub, did not know this was procedure. While waiting in line, another couple line jumped us and snagged what appeared to be the last table window. We were brought to this dank, cramped, little table in the MIDDLE of the dining room. We were squished between a couple on our left and two round tables on our right. We couldn't even see the skyline from where we were sitting. For $80 a plate, making a reservation three weeks in advance, and being lined jumped, dismissive staff, we were already becoming turned off to the experience. I found the manager and told him about the special occasion and what happened with being lined jumped. He responded with \\"If you want a window table, that's fine but it's going to be 30-45 minutes\\". We decided to stay seated at the original crappy table. We waited 5-10 minutes. In that time, no one came and offered us water or took a drink order. We saw a window table being cleared. When I politely asked a staff member if we could squeeze into that table. He said \\"Hang on, I'll be back.\\" I said okay and waited with my boyfriend at our original table. Note: We were not demanding the table, or being rude. We saw a potential opportunity and didn't think it would hurt to ask. Apparently, I was wrong. A few minutes later, what appeared to be a security staff (Im guessing this because he pulled an earpiece out of his ear and was wearing an all black suit) came up to me and said \\"Miss, we don't guarantee window tables. You can either sit here or wait 30 minutes.\\"  I didn't realize by asking for a table, that warranted having security come over. We decided to leave and went to the Cheesecake Factory instead. Again, for $80 a plate, you expect above mediocre customer service. Furthermore, when someone books a table for a special occasion and asks for a window table in particular, if you can't guarantee it, contact the person and at least give fair warning. Will not be going back and so glad I didn't waste my money. PS don't worry about the jean dress code. Apparently that doesn't matter as I saw people in casual wear coming in and out of the place.

I wish they had the garlic bread as a side option it is one of the best I've ever had and they only give you a small piece. For my entree, I had the seafood Newburg which was amazing! The sauce is perfectly seasoned and a great portion overall. The rice could've used a hint of lime but the sauce made up for it. My other friends had the calamari (great portion but mostly batter), and the crab cakes which come with two decent sized cakes over lettuce. The lobster roll is also available to order on the dinner menu but it is kind of hidden in the Salads section as it says lobster salad roll. This is about the only \\"sandwich\\" on the regular menu. The waiter was great and attentive, and this place is huge, with about 3 floors. A nice fact is that it is the oldest restaurant in america (so they say).

So many fine establishments, amazingly reviewed and highly recommended by our concierge, what were we to do? \\n\\nAs we made our way towards Portland, we decided to pick Andina's. We heard nothing but greatness from the winemakers we visited and our wine tour guide, as well as the yelp reviews to back them up. Lucky us, we were able to book reservations via yelp, mid Sunday afternoon for the next night. \\n\\nWalking into Andina's can be slightly confusing, there are a set of French doors up the steps that open up to a perpendicular hallway, an open overlook space to the next floor down, and the kitchen across the opposite side. The hostess desk is tucked away off to the far left and easy to miss, while the bar is off to the right.\\n\\nWe were greeted by four (or five?) lovely hostesses and seated right away. After looking over our very extensive menus with tons of options, this is what we had...\\n\\n08 Adea Pinot Noir, Ann Sigrid, Willamette Valley, ORE. We started out with a couple glasses from our favorite winery on our tasting tour the day before.. Ann's blend, made especially for her, by her husband, Deano. \\n\\nThen picked a few tapas to wet our tongues..\\n\\nEnsalada Verde Peruana- with greens with hearts of palm, cotija cheese and asparagus in a passion fruit vinaigrette. Simple, fresh ingredients, and filling. \\n\\nEsparragos Peruanos- grilled asparagus brushed with chimichurri. Nothing very fancy about grilled asparagus, but add Andina's special sauce and wowey... melt in your mouth wonderment will start to happen... \\n\\nAtun Fusion - sashimi-style tuna in a tamarindo-rocoto uchucuta, served with a mango-peanut salsa. This dish brought me back to the traditional Peruvian I've had before.. smothered in what seemed to be a house-made ketchup. Tuna seared thinly with sesame crusted edges and the ketchup like substance atop along with a few pickled vegetables off to the side. My counterpart was digging this, me amused, but not going wild yet... and then\\n\\n...our main dishes made their appearance!\\n\\nMine: ATÚN CON TACU TACU Y AGUAYMANTO\\nseared yellowfin tuna sprinkled with black pepper and orange zest, served with traditional lima bean tacu tacu, orange wedges, endive spears and salsa criolla, drizzled with a cape gooseberry-ají amarillo sauce. I didn't need anything else on earth to get me as stimulated or as satisfied as this dish. Every part of my senses and taste buds were tickled pink, while my cerebral cortex was moving into a slow frenzy. No one told us the chef was a mastermind here; if you didn't know, now you know!\\n\\nHis: PESCADO AL ROCOTO Y KIÓN\\nroasted fresh fish topped with slivers of ginger, rocoto and scallion, basted with sizzling sesame oil, served over shiitake mushrooms and bok choy in a smoked pork broth, served with asparagus-quinoa fried rice. He quietly gazed and looked at my dish with longing in his eyes. I shared half. I didn't try this (pork broth? no thanks..) It looked good, but mine was better. That's all I can tell you. \\n\\nAll of our dishes kept getting better and better, we couldn't pass up a dessert to share...\\n\\nWe ordered three Trufas Peruanas - authentic handmade truffles with traditional Peruvian flavors.\\nTwo Cuasco yellow hot pepper and spiced citrus peel, one Capuli dark chocolate ganache infused with anise. Between the two kinds, we both preferred the Cuasco. Spice and smooth chocolate in one- two bites of heaven. Perfect amount. So satisfying...\\n\\nWe chose NV Château d'Arlay Macvin, Jura, France, Semillon to accompany our chocolate indulgences...Sweets with \\"sweets in a glass\\" always works together magnificently.\\n\\nThere are many, many ways Andina's can and will sweep you off your feet, tickle your senses and leave you wanting more. What a satisfying, amazing and fantastically unique dining experience!"},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"They have very unique donuts but I wouldn't say they're all very good.

Visiting from Colorado, I expected to have my socks blown off by this restaurant. This is the only place that we ate at that did not impress us. The best tasting thing that we had was the Arnold Palmer beverage. My husband and I both ordered the smothered chicken, which was not actually smothered chicken. It was fried chicken that had gravy poured over it before it came to the table. It hadn't been smothered in the gravy then baked. The greens that I had were okay, but not much flavor, and the crackling bread...no flavor at all. The Mac and cheese was okay, but again, very bland. I had to salt and pepper it quite a bit. My kids flat out hated the mac and cheese, the consistency of the cheese was nasty to them. The broccoli casserole just tasted like baked broccoli, nothing about it made the flavor POP! And lastly, I was extremely disappointed with the peach cobbler. I've never needed to fix up a dessert at a restaurant. The cobbler was disgusting. Once again, just prepared, but not made with any passion. No flavor, no richness, not even sweet. In fact it had a bitter bite to it. Even the rolls, corn bread, and cinnamon rolls that's brought out to the table....nasty. I've never not liked so much food at a restaurant. We had a way better food experience at a soul food buffet the day before and for less money. We packed up our food to go just to feed it to a homeless person because none of us wanted to eat it. The best thing about our experience was two of the waitresses, I wish I would have gotten their names because they needed to be mentioned. This doesn't include the dry, unpleasant host that took our name upon entering the restaurant, she did not have the personality to deal with guests. Sadly, I will never come back to Mary Macs again.

Last May; we had the BEST experience- food was amazing, staff was great, I posted about it on my social media & had friends come out BECAUSE of my post (I'm an online influencer). In fact we had such a great time that when we came THIS time around (on vacation again/ we come out every year), this place was on the list (& I was CRAVING those shrimp tacos!!). Unfortunately the experience fell WAY below last years experience. I mean- WAY below. It took a waiter over 10 minutes to greet us after we were sat (mind you it wasn't slammed busy, maybe 1/4 filled if that). When he came to us, he asked what we wanted to drink- we said water to start, he left and came back literally at least 10 more minutes, to the point another women server came over to us and gave us water. Eventually the male server came back and asked us for our order (never brought us drinks or asked if we wanted additional drinks)- at this point we were so worried the food would take an hour to get to the table; so we just skipped the drinks and put in the orders. We noticed the menu has changed from last May. Instead of the 3 taco meal they used to offer, it's now individual tacos. Okay that's fine- I order my tacos and we moved on. Tacos arrive & WTF? They were slopped on a plate- total mess, liquids pouring out from both ends- it was NOT insta worthy at all.. what happened to their taco stands?! Seriously? Those made all the difference in the look/ feel/ and taco quality overall because they kept them off the plate - keeping them from getting soggy. Were the taco stands \\"so hard\\" to use or clean or something that they decided to ditch them????\\nSo that's fine- I got over the gross sloppy look & I ate two bites of one... refused to eat the other one. We never saw the server again during the meal, and it took him ages to get over to our table. When he finally came over we then asked for the check because we were so over waiting. He didn't seem to notice that I only ate a bite of one taco (I ordered 2), he never asked \\"is there something wrong\\" nothing. Just left the check. So we paid and left. That's fine - I won't be posting about this place, telling my friends, or coming back.. which is SO disappointing because this place was my absolute favorite- I had dreams about the tacos. I wanted this place to be good SO BAD, I really did- I overlooked the wait times/ bad service- hoping the food made up for it. Sadly it came out looking sloppy and mushy and watery.

Big pink boxes stacked up, not a problem. Crowds in a small space can't be helped.

The decor and ambiance of the restaurant was very modern and vibrant. Decor alone, I would give five stars. However, I was slightly disappointed with the food. For starters, I ordered an iced tea and it was completely unflavored and came in a very tiny cup for the price I paid for it - I was expecting a bit more. My friends and I got both sweet potato and regular air-fried fries, that are so raved about. If a person came in indecisive about which fries to get, definitely get the sweet potato fries because for some reason, the regular fries were just kind of stale and not fresh, maybe I got a bad batch? But for my main lunch, I got the Spicy Thai Salad. It wasn't really spicy and I kind of wished they used tofu instead of tempeh just because I didn't feel like the tempeh provided a good texture in combination to the salad. The dressing was good, but that's really all I have to say about the salad.

The set up is a little different from your regular Chick-fil-A. The parking lot is a maze and tight, so be prepared for that. Upon entering, you can go to the right which is where your typical Chick-fil-A offerings are, along with the typical service. On the left, there is more of a full-serve set-up, with booths along the windows and counter stools near the grill (similar to how Waffle House is laid out). \\n\\nThe full-service side is complete with fold out menus and servers who are quick. The kitchen staff (which you can watch from your booth or are right in front of you at the counter) push food out incredibly quick. The menu and prices are also displayed along the top of the wall right above the kitchen staff. I noted that the prices at this location are significantly higher than say at standalone Chick-fil-A down the street (i.e. $2.75 for tea lemonade, over $3 for orange juice). The food is great though, with breakfast served all day and with expanded offerings on the breakfast and regular menus. On a Friday morning at about 11:00, we were seated in 20 minutes - several tables appeared done with their meals, but were simply chatting and lounging despite the line going out the door. I got a chicken omelette and scattered potatoes (hashbrowns), and both filled the plate up. The wait time for the sit-down side can be quite long and a bit disorganized, as there was a host taking names, but she also was busing tables - meaning that while she was away, folks were wandering in and bypassing those waiting to be seated. I would recommend stopping by if you're in Hapeville (which is in the middle of nowhere); probably wouldn't make is a regular weekend spot just due to location and the higher prices, but I would come back if in the area."},{"name":"Mary Mac's Tea Room","address":"224 Ponce De Leon Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Delicious all the way around!!!

We arrive and they insist we sit at a table up by the \\"bar\\" because it seats 6 but we were only 5. Oh well, onward. The we asked for additional lunch menus. Our waitress said, we only have a few, we don't have a lot of them, you have to share. OK again not a big deal but the tone was something else. We place our orders and they start coming out. Our waitress placed dishes in front of 2 of us. After we seasoned our respective dishes we realize that the omelets on our plates were not what we ordered. The kitchen had accidently put the toast on the wrong omelet, hence the mix-up when the waitress placed it at the table. We brought this to her attention and she immediately blamed the kitchen (aren't wait staff supposed to be aware of a dish being served?). Then she brought out the omelet that we returned saying it was correct. I again informed her that is was more seasoned then the person wanted, who ordered it. They finally agreed to replaced the omelet. \\nThen when the bill came we asked to have it separated. She said, \\"we don't do that, it states it on our menu, we have never done that.\\" Five people, each meal was $6.99. We all wanted to pay our bill separate. In this day and age who couldn't easily handle that? My co-worker said we weren't arguing with her, we were just asking. She said that she was just informing us. \\nI wish someone would tape her when she talks to customers because I don't believe she is aware of how rude and disrespectful she sounds. \\nThis waitress made the whole experience horrible.

It is \\"traditional\\" in that they expect each course to be ordered and delivered separately, which means separate charges for everything. Bread? $3. Salad of nothing but arugula and a few slices of parmesan? $10. Prima courses, then Secondi courses. We did NOT follow that pattern, but even so, spent $79 (after 20% tip) - 3 beers total, no wine - and I'm still hungry. The food was OK, not great. In contrast, we often go 1 block farther to Maudies and get delicious Tex-Mex, including apps and drinks, and come home stuffed, with lots of leftovers, and pay half that. I do not believe that the effort to make Italian food is any greater than that for Mexican.

And there was a scallion oil on the plate. Them dumplings were definitely made in house, soft exterior with a juicy middle, the oil was a nice compliment.   \\n\\nThe chicken and Mac and cheese was a huge plate of food. It had its good and not so good.  The good crispy breaded chicken l nice crunch, the Mac and cheese had a nice flavor with a little kick to it. And the collard greens were a nice side such. Little on the sweet side but cooked well. The not so good. The chicken was a little salty for me and i didn't have any lobster in my lobster Mac and cheese. \\n\\nIt was a nice place to come eat.

I've lived in Texas all my life thinking we had the best brisket, but Two Urban Licks has us beat by a long shot.  The meat was perfectly marbled and melted in your mouth.  The portion is so huge you have to take a doggy bag home.  Even re-heated, the brisket didn't lose it's tenderness or flavor.  Truly the best brisket I've ever had.  The sides we had (elotes and mashed potatoes) were also really good.  There was a live jazz band on the first floor and that was refreshing and enjoyable.  Overall, my friend and I had a great time.\\n\\nSmall cons: As other Yelpers mentioned, no one asked if we wanted drinks besides water the 3 times we went.  We had to literally flag down the waiter with our napkins as he whizzed by to ask for stuff.  Not sure if this was because they're always so busy or what.  We were super hyped up from reviews about the salmon chips and they really weren't that great.  I think the sauce between the salmon and the chip is the deciding factor - we didn't have enough of the sauce and it tasted like dry, cold, and unflavored salmon on a greasy chip.  Ask for extra sauce on the side and that'll solve that.  Another tip is to ask to be seated on ground level.  We were seated at the top floor once and it wasn't a great experience."},{"name":"Andina Restaurant","address":"1314 NW Glisan St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"10 of 10!!\\nColorful and delicious seafood entrees!\\nI would like to visit again.\\n\\nSeafood fried rice is the best choice if you are beginner if you are eating Peruvian food at the first time.\\n\\nCost-worthy"},{"name":"Boi Brazil Churrascaria","address":"5600 International Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"We found the place, thanks to yelp.

When you walk in you feel like you are in the sweetest little place ever!

They ask you if you would like goat with rice or chicken with rice. We always pick the chicken but I'm sure that the goat would be good too ! The first things you get are sort of like dumplings but bigger and better! They always have really flavorful seasonings and that is coming a kid who normally likes things plain. After that while you are waiting you have the opportunity to come into a conversation with what I think is the owners daughter who has been there every time I've went. Then you will have a platter sent out to you with(in our case) chicken and rice. The favors are wonderful and they taste like someone has put there hart into it!

I've been so very fortunate to have experienced 10 or so CD 102.5 Big Room shows and have never been disappointed.  The station is able to pull in a wide range of alternative acts from all over the world who are often playing large venues later that night.  Typically artists play 3 to 4 songs while interacting with the DJ in between.  During those exchanges you get to learn new & often pretty funny things about the artist that you might not learn elsewhere.  All the performances that I have seen, the artists have appeared so comfortable and engaged with the small number of people present.  The Big Room shows look like they are set to hold about 35 people which only adds to the intimacy of the overall experience.\\n\\nWhile never guaranteed, as the artists may not always be able, I've had the good fortune to meet so many fantastic artists... Matisyahu; Elle King; Leon Bridges; Welles; Flora Cash; Strumbellas.  I have seen attendees bring with them albums, shirts, or other materials in hopes of obtaining autographs.

It was happy hour, so we ended up ordering a few margaritas and some grub. I enjoyed the mango margarita better than the passion fruit as it was a bit too tart for my tastebuds. Speaking of tastebuds... What was unforgettable about the whole experience was the Carlita's Skillet!! Definitely a party explosion in my mouth, haha!! My sister couldn't stop eating this dish before she even touched her taco because it was so addicting. Next time we'd like to try their other options, but Carlita's Skillet is definitely a must and I would not be ashamed to let others know that I'd like to have one all to myself. A bit selfish I know, but I think it's too damn good to share. Or, maybe they can come up with larger sizes??

I thought the chicken and waffle sliders were pretty tasty but not the best I've ever had. I would have preferred a waffle that wasn't cooked as long. It was slightly burnt on the edges, but it didn't ruin the overall taste of the dish. By the time I made it to the lemon raspberry tart, I think I was too full to have another bite of anything. It was good, but be sure to have space in your stomach if you order off of this menu. It was surprisingly filling. \\n\\nService was great and our waiters were super attentive.

There's always a line up for the different seating times. On the day that we went, they even had to turn away some people. It is understandable because it is a very small restaurant.  Their menu is small with about maybe 10 -15 items including appetizers, mains and desserts.  Usually, this is a sign of a good restaurant because they can focus on the quality of those dishes.  When I looked at the menu, I was little worried because I'm not a big fan of seafood. I'm very picky about what I eat. There was only one pasta on the menu that I wanted to try, the duck and it had olives (I picked them out). The pasta was cooked al denté and the sauce was duck meat sauce which was really tasty. As a group, we shared the Luigi meatballs which are huge! They're super moist and are filled with a typical ingredients (e.g., raisins and pine nuts).  The sauce was delicious!  My husband ordered the day's pasta special which was a pappardelle with braised beef. It was absolutely delicious!  We all tried it and wished that we had ordered it instead of our own pastas!! Not to say that the others weren't good, but that his was that much better!  The braised beef was so moist and well flavoured, as well as the white cream sauce that it was in.  I agree that their food is very tasty and the ingredient combinations are unique. Just beware of you're dining with any picky eaters because your choices will be limited because they use some very non-traditional ingredients in their dishes. Otherwise, I enjoyed my meal here."},{"name":"Poor Calvin's","address":"510 Piedmont Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Delicious for the most part but the experience depends on your server.

I was actually wanting pizza at Famoso or Marcello's next door but the wait times were unreasonably long. Popped in at Red Pagoda on a whim seeing as there was no wait. \\n\\nThis place is seriously understaffed on a Friday evening. We were kept waiting for almost 10 minutes at the small entryway despite an available table with leftover dishes that sat there for a while. The food other people were getting looked decent so I had hope. Once seated, it was another 10 minutes before we got anyone's attention much less tea, menus, or utensils. We were seated right in the middle of the restaurant along an aisle where the servers pass! Finally, the one guy working the tables comes by and asks if we've been waiting long. Uh yeah?? You seated us 10 minutes ago! At this point I was getting hangry (hungry + angry) and I just wanted food. I made my decision quickly and ordered.\\n\\nHere's where it goes from bad to worse. I head to the washroom and while waiting for the little boys room to become free, I notice some guy urinating in the women's toilet, seat down, door wide open. Once he was done splashing bodily fluids all over the seat, he exited without washing his hands and headed directly into the kitchen! He was the cook! I was in total shock and absolutely disgusted at the same time.\\n\\nI came back to our table and had a serious discussion with my S.O. about what I had just seen. After our little summit meeting, we decided to cancel our orders and high-tail it out of there. I can think of better ways of spending my weekend than puking my guts out from an avoidable stomach flu. I can't believe that people still don't wash their hands after using the washroom - especially if you work with food.

I was taken to The Bancroft as a surprise dinner and we truly wanted to enjoy it. Unfortunately, the restaraunt was a let down from the very beginning. \\n\\nWe had an 8:30 reservation, and my partner had specifically requested a booth in the back. Upon arrival, we were offered a table(not booth) right in the walking path. He asked for a booth, and showed the one he wanted. The hostess that walked us there seemed flustered that we wouldn't take the table, but told us that the booth we wanted would be cleaned and ready for us in a few minutes. We sat by the bar and waited. After about 5 minutes, she came back but gave us a different booth than requested. \\n\\nThen our server arrived. She was pleasant, but we felt a little uncomfortable. We tend to order a lot when we go out, so we did order 3 starters {Scallops, Shrimp Cocktail, and Oysters}. She then asked if we would be ordering entrees, but it came across odd. My partner ordered the entrees (28 day aged steak for him, and Risotto with lobster tail for me). He also ordered a cocktail. Our server then took our wine glasses without asking if we would also want to order wine. \\n\\n\\nThen our food arrived. The starters were ok - the scallops had a charred taste, which I didn't hate, but for seared scallops didn't expect. The oysters were surprisingly very very good. The shrimp cocktail was not great, the shrimp were very tough, but that may have been since they were Tiger Shrimp. \\n\\nThen the steak arrived... and that was the biggest let down. And almost $50 steak... charred black on the bottom. Mind we had ordered it medium rare. He ended up sending it back. The steak that arrived after that was rare and not cooked at all. We appreciated the char being left off, but it wasn't even cooked. A shame, the cut of meat was fantastic! \\n\\nI will mention that the server/waitress did have the manager remove the steak from our bill, which we appreciated.

Once there, donuts became a new fascination; Top Pots were bigger, sweeter, more amazing than any I had ever tasted. And I was not a connoisseur by any means. One day, a colleague of mine returned from a weekend trip to Portland and could not stop raving - and laughing - at the novelty of Voodoo. The place was immediately added to my list.\\n\\nType of cuisine: \\"Something fun, different, and one for the ages. After much searching under rocks, tequilas, and women's blouses, they found what they were looking for... doughnuts!! \\"\\n\\nAmbiance: Walking up to the end of the semi-short line, we began inspecting the glittered bricks, the entryway...and our tastebuds were immediately curious. Finally, inside, we had a few minutes to take in the scenery before it was time to prepare our orders. The artwork, the humongous doughnut, even the coffin share a story as you make your way through the line. \\n\\nWhat I ordered: We walked up to the brick building donning the Voodoo name and donut mascot anticipating an order of half-dozen to take for our friends, still sleeping at our weekend abode. My husband was \\"not about to wait in line for 20 minutes and get anything less than a dozen\\". So, a dozen ($11.25) it was, and one Bacon Maple Bar doughnut © ($3), a raised yeast doughnut with maple frosting and bacon on top! Our dozen included the Voodoo Doll doughnut ©, a raised yeast doughnut filled with raspberry jelly topped with chocolate frosting and a pretzel stake! (characteristics of Voodoo Dolls are all different), Portland Cream doughnut ©, a raised yeast doughnut filled with Bavarian cream, topped with chocolate and two eyeballs, representing the vision of our great city, The Loop doughnut, a raised yeast doughnut with vanilla frosting and Fruit Loops!, Dirt doughnut doughnut, a raised yeast doughnut with vanilla frosting and Oreos!, Marshall Mathers doughnut, a plain cake doughnut with vanilla frosting and\\nmini M & M's �?, Orangatang doughnut, a raised yeast doughnut dipped in vanilla frosting, Tang with a side of orange sprinkles!, Old Fashioned doughnut, a cake doughnut with maple frosting! and the Blueberry cake doughnut, a blueberry dough with a glaze! and Cinnamon sugar doughnut, a plain cake doughnut with cinnamon sugar! which none of us touched.\\n\\nWhat I loved: The favorite of all four of us - having nearly devoured the entire bakers dozen - was the Dirt doughnut, the Oreos coming in strong!\\n\\nWhy I loved it: It's more about the novelty and creativity than anything else, but the donuts are large, sweet and everything you would want in such a guilt-ridden dining experience.\\n\\nCost: Average to high ($3 per donut; $11 - $15 per dozen)"},{"name":"Not Your Average Joe's","address":"4C Wayside Rd","city":"Burlington","stars":"3.5","text":"One of my favorite spots.

It has tofu scramble, potato hash, lettuce, tomatoes, salsa, and a choice of wheat or flour tortillas. The tofu scramble isn't like what I've had before. They add a lot of nutritional yeast, so if you haven't had nutritional yeast yet you might find the flavor a little odd. But I love it! It gave the scrambled tofu a little bit of an eggier look and a lot more flavor. The wheat tortillas were also very good! They have a slightly harder texture than wheat tortillas but I think there's more flavor in it. The entire concept reminds me of Snooze but I like Bouldin much more. The portions are large and it is very affordable. One of my favorite restaurants I've been to in Austin.\\n\\nThe line for Sunday brunch gets long so you should join the Yelp waitlist that morning before you leave the house to make sure you don't wait too long.

DAMN! This place gotta be good!

They say 20 minute wait, but that could easily turn into 1 hour, but you can't leave because of the time you invested.. now you're thinking, let me take a peek at the menu... Tri fold menu, lots of sides! Go ahead and get a pencil and paper because that's how your order will be taken, (you writing in your order) \\n\\nYou see a lot when you're waiting for an hour, older ladies with their church hats on, but it's Saturday? So I'm thinking, this is sooo legit! Families waiting in line outside.. Okay so now I'm really drawn in!\\n\\nI was ambitious, I ordered fried green tomatoes, all bread, broccoli soufflé, Mac and cheese, collared greens, and a stunning four piece fried chicken.. and a peach cobbler. \\n\\nOur server took forever to bring out our water and bread... our food came out before our water did! (Waited for 15 minutes) \\n\\nChicken was crispy, but it is a big enough meal for 2! No substitutes, one breast, one wing, one thigh, one drum. LACKS SEASONING.... but it was crispy, freshly fried, the meat inside didn't have much flavor. \\n\\nBroccoli soufflé was good, makes you wonder what else is in there but broccoli and cheese. \\n\\nMac and cheese\\nReally???? It looks like cheddar cheese mixed with Mac pasta, you can visually see... I'm expecting some creamy cheesy sauce, but na.. it's basic \\n\\nCollared greens\\nHad a Smokey flavor, doesn't have little bits of pork or bacon in there or anything, usually compliments it well, it's ok! Big serving \\n\\nSweet potato soufflé \\n-creamy, sweet, and delightful \\nGreat for dentures if ya have some \\n\\nFried green tomatoes...\\nComes with a large serving of ranch, also lacks flavor and spice. My appetizer came after food and drinks, I was extremely upset, my guy didn't even ask me if I still wanted the appetizer, it defeats the whole purpose of an appetizer to receive it after your meal.. whatever tho.. charge it to the game. \\n\\nI absolutely LOVE that it is inside a house, and the feel, the vibe... the sides were better than the main entree for me... so you can order all sides.. and be good with that! Two sides come with your fried chicken so that was really nice. \\n\\nParking situation is in the back, just wait around because someone will eventually leave. Inside seating does exist!

I'm no calzone conaisseur, but the sauce seemed muddy and the ricotta oozed whey while eating (isn't that usually squeezed through cheesecloth to remove excess moisture?).  And if you're a decent pizza or Italian-type place, shouldn't at least one herb like basil or oregano make an appearance in the flavor pallette?  Like at least a bit of herb chiffonade on top?\\n\\nPerfectly serviceable I guess, and the people were super-nice and responsive and the house Chianti (served bizarrely in a juice glass I think?) was OK, but this place oozes \\"we really should have more locations rather than squeezing this one for dollars.\\" All things considered, I'd have been much happier at Mod Pizza.\\n\\nHonestly, the highlight of my time there was passing by a really cute doggy walking his human from the takeout counter while I walked to the car.

But if you really do love Chick-fil-A a lot, are a chicken sandwich addict, want to try items that you can't get anywhere else and have a soft side for their history, then you must make this pilgrimage to Atlanta.\\n\\nYes, this is THE original location of Chick-fil-A, where what I believe to be the greatest chicken sandwich was ever created. \\n\\nEverything about this restaurant is different from your typical Chick-fil-A. First, this location is open just about around the clock. They also have servers to provide table service and there are a plethora of non-typical Chick-fil-A items to choose from on their menu. They have various platters, lots of sides, salads, soups, special sides, dessert and breakfast platters. When we went, if I didn't know any better, I would have thought I was in some random diner that just happened to specialize in chicken.\\n\\nAs a major foodie, I had done my fair share of research prior to coming here so my wife and I thought we knew what was best to get. Every article and review pointed to the Hot Brown as their signature dish, so I went with that. It came with a salad, but who's getting salad at Chick-fil-A? C'mon. I swapped out the salad for waffle fries. My wife ordered the Grilled Chicken Melt Platter with Waffle Fries and Fried Okra. \\n\\nThe verdict? Meh and meh. Honestly, I don't know what I was thinking when I ordered. I read the description on the menu and wasn't too excited about the Hot Brown, but I proceeded against my own will anyway. I should have listened to my gut. The Hot Brown was this unappetizing combo of chopped chicken, cream sauce and cheddar cheese. It was a gooey mess in a small tray that pretty much tasted like it sounded. I couldn't get a grip of the flavor of the chicken because the cream sauce and cheese dominated it. The gooeyness of the dish was a turnoff too. My wife wasn't a fan of her chicken melt platter either. It was all very plain and didn't have much flavor to it.\\n\\nWhen we first walked in, all I could think about was what I typically ordered at Chick-fil-As (nuggets) and why I loved the chain and my word of advice to any customers visiting is DO NOT DIVERT FROM THAT. Go with your gut and the reasons you loved Chick-fil-A in the first place. Don't try to get fancy and order things that just don't sound good, even if it's their \\"signature\\" dish. You'll enjoy your experience a lot more here. I'm not deterring anyone from trying new things, but in this instance, stick with the chicken you know and love.\\n\\nBesides the platters we ordered, we both also ordered a Frosted Lemonade, which was something we hadn't seen elsewhere. The best way to describe it was like a creamsicle lemonade shake. It was better than I thought it would be, so that's a win there.\\n\\nThe service was decent here and quick. I wouldn't say the employees were friendly, but in no way were they hostile either. Most were young and just did their jobs, but didn't go out of their way to converse with customers.\\n\\nLike I said, coming here won't be for everyone. It's a nice piece of history whenever you go to the 1st of anything that is now global, but if you're just seeking out a Chick-fil-A meal, then it's better to stay local."},{"name":"Two Urban Licks","address":"820 Ralph McGill Blvd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I went here for the first time for a birthday dinner with several friends.. most of us drove separate but I was very pleased with how quickly the valet service helped all of us from our cars and inside for our reservations. \\nWe had a blast!

Unlike the first time, we got seated outside promptly and our waiters were great. One was named Kirk or Kurt - not sure which one, and the other was African-American gentleman with neat dreads (don't recollect his name). My cocktail, Up in smoke, was amazing. We ordered the pimento hush puppies which were just okay. The bread was pretty good. \\n\\nWe ordered the bistro steak and scallops. The scallops were pretty good. Unfortunately, I had issues with my steak. It came out medium well/well done instead of medium. I assumed that Kirk didn't hear me when I said \\"medium\\" because the restaurant next door, New Realm, had a loud band playing so it was kinda noisy. This wasn't a big deal because Kirk took it back and returned about 10 mins later with my steak, medium, and another cocktail. The first bite of the steak tasted a bit \\"off\\" but I didn't think anything of it. I assumed it was the seasoning so I smothered my next piece with a lot of chimichurri sauce. The sauce was extremely tasty by the way. By my fourth piece I was feeling really nauseous and sick, so I walked to the corner and sat on the floor and started sweating profusely. \\n\\nThe staff including whom I think may have been a manager were all really helpful and checked on me to make sure I was okay. It took about 20 mins for my tummy to settle, at which point we asked for the check, paid and left. In case you're wondering, I paid for the steak as well. My overall ratings are as follows:\\n\\nMy waiters: 5 stars\\nCocktails: 5 stars \\nFood: 1 star \\nService: 3.5 stars \\n\\nWondering why I gave 1 star instead of maybe 3? Well, I clearly stated to our waiters and \\"possible manager\\" that the food made me sick, but they made no effort to take it off the check. Kirk even boxed it for me but I refused to take it home. I didn't get a chance to eat the mashed potato and green beans that the steak came with, and I didn't finish my 2nd cocktail. The gentleman, who I assume to be a manager or something, was too busy introducing himself while I felt sick that he may have forgotten to take the food off my check - giving him the benefit of the doubt.

Luckily the staff is well equipped to handle the volume, as they find a table for you once you pay for your food. Once I ordered and was seated, my food came out quickly. I got the roasted turkey sandwich with sweet potato fries. Let me start with the fries -- wow. They were delicious. Crispy on the outside, potatoey on the inside, and piping hot. The sandwich was just as good as the fries. Everything was fresh and hot. While I would consider this a no frills diner, it's definitely worth the trip. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I felt like it was a little pricey. My sandwich, fries, and a Coke was around $16, before tip.

I can't even begin to describe how good those pancakes were. They were probably some of the best chocolate chip pancakes I've had. I was hesitant to add strawberries (it was an extra $4), but I'm glad I did. I got enough strawberries to have one with each bite of pancake and I still had some leftover.

Soft and creamy, a subtly sweet and tender flavor that balanced perfectly with the other sauces in the bowl. The focaccia bread that came with it was some of the best bread I've ever tasted. Crispy and smokey, straight off the grill. However, $16 is quite pricey for cheese and bread (no matter how delicious). For the main course, I had the charred octopus, which was okay. A bit of a small portion size though. We had to have the famous birthday cake ice cream sandwiches for dessert, which were absolutely phenomenal.\\n\\nIt was a two-hour meal, much of which was spent waiting.

On the plus side, the service was just fine!\\n\\nI ordered the kale caesar salad with tempeh since it's one of their most popular menu items. Nothing really wrong about my dish but nothing outstanding either. The shiitake bacon was a little too dry and salty for my liking as were the croutons. Yeah, I could have done without them, but then I wouldn't really have a caesar salad then lol. Dressing was fine.. I would say that with kale it's important to mix the dressing in well and massage the kale otherwise it's really dry but they didn't do that here :(\\n\\nSweet potato fries were good but you can honestly get those anywhere! I'd say that I was a pretty big fan of the beet ketchup. My coworker ordered the artichoke dip and I was surprisingly disappointed by this.. I tend to like tangy dips but this one was a little too sour for me.\\n\\nI also tried the Dr. Kale smoothie which they just poured out from a giant container for me.

The Bacon Breakfast Burrito was also very good and something I would get again. It had a great amount of eggs in the burrito, I've had many that had too much and many that didn't have enough but my burrito had a very reasonable amount. The bacon tasted smoked and cooked to the right amount. Unfortunately, the Chicken Quesadilla was the weakest link of the three items I've tried from Muchas Gracias. Most Mexican places use a mixture of cheddar and jack cheeses for their quesadillas. However, mine was just all cheddar. It's no different than a pizza only using one kind of cheese, mixing cheeses makes a huge importance on any dish that has a large amount of cheese on it. I also didn't like the way the quesadilla was folded. The chicken and cheese would has easily fallen out if I picked it up and ate it like how I eat most quesadillas.

About 15 minutes later an apologetic delivery boy arrived at my door and explained that \\"they\\" had given him the wrong address the first time.  He was embarrassed and the replacement order had arrived quickly so I told him it was no big deal. Until... he left and I realized the pizza I was holding was not hot and couldn't possibly be fresh.

The salad container felt like it had been microwaved (it was very very hot out).\\n\\nI immediately called AGAIN to explain that I had clearly not been sent a fresh order. Instead the delivery kid must have returned to wherever he had \\"just left\\" this food and then brought it to me, 2 hours and 45 minutes after I placed the order.

The pickle chips were overfried. The cold seafood platter was all right, as the seafood was generally quite fresh but could have used some traditional cocktail sauce. The worst offences of the night were the entrees we ordered including the seafood paella and seared scallops with root vegetable risotto both priced around $30.\\n\\nPaella is a dish that features mixed seafood with fragrant, seasoned rice. The rice is arguably a key feature of this dish. What we received  when we ordered it was a nice mix of seafood but with only small clumps of rice scattered around the dish as if it were a garnish. The rice had little flavor and was quite crusted. Yes, a proper paella  arguably has a lovely crust that forms when it's cooked but when all you get is a scattering of the crisp rice bits you can't help but wonder what you have done to deserve such cruelty. Also, the root vegetable risotto that accompanied the seared scallops was inedible. It tasted heavily of red wine, had only a few small pieces of beets and left both me and my friend astonished at how a dish that sounded so promising  and delicious could be so disastrous. \\n\\nThe service was friendly but we were left waiting for long periods of time, even when it came to paying the bill.

I eat here about 4-5 times a year when I bring clients from my firm out. I have always really enjoyed the food and the service. However, this time for the most special occasion, my wife's birthday, everything fell apart. \\n\\nWe will start first with our reservation. We booked a table of 8 for 7:30 on a Friday. I had the time confirmed by my assistant the day before while she also confirmed the availability of a vegetarian menu. Upon arrival, we were told our reservation was at 8. No big deal since we were actually waiting for 2 who were late leaving the office. We had several drinks at the bar. \\n\\nAt 8 we were seated. The table was small and should have fit 6 but we squeezed 8 in. It took 15 minutes for our server, \\"J\\", to greet us. Again, Friday night and we weren't in that big of rush, we had 2 hours to make our theater show. It was going to be tight but we could do it despite the reservation time mix up. \\n\\nIt took J another 15 minutes to show back up to take an appetizer order, at which time we just put in all food. J informed us that there was no vegetarian menu but we could just omit any protein item from the normal menu. Again, I have taken clients here over the years and know that there is more they can do and I had it confirmed upon booking. I felt bad for our vegetarian guest. \\n\\nOur pop-overs, which are usually divine, were burnt and almost inedible. The 2 orders of lobster fritters were wonderful but the orders of bone marrow had very little marrow in them. One order was nothing but pickled onions. \\n\\nAnd then we sat.... And sat... And sat... An hour after our appetizers were delivered we still had no food. J was happy to take 3-4 bar drink orders but was not attentive to our food time at all. It got to the point that I got up to find a manager to inquire about our food. Another 15 minutes goes by and the manager returns to tell us we ordered several \\"King Steaks\\" and they take a while. I order the same steak almost every time I come, the King medium rare\\" and I know it doesn't take over an hour to prepare this dish. \\n\\nFood finally delivered, the steaks were either over or under cooked. No one got the temperature they ordered (medium rare to medium) on either the steaks or the lamb. Honestly, the best dish on the table was the vegetarian dish of Mushroom over Farro. The marrow served with the King Steaks suffered the same problem as the appetizer portions. However, none of us dared to ask it to be corrected since starvation had set in.\\n\\nOur food was delivered at 9:40 and we were resigned that we were going to be late now for our theater tickets. We inhaled our food as fast as we could which is a shame. Ordered a toffee cake so we could sing happy birthday (which tasted great) and ran out the door in a hurry to still miss most of the first act. \\n\\nAll in total a meal that ran close to $1,000 and I have to search for the highlights. A huge disappointment at any price point but definitely not what I expected from King & Duke. J should have been attentive and proactive in knowing the issues. I talked with a colleague this morning who said that last 2 times he has been the experience has \\"home down hill\\". I hope this isn't the new normal.

If you are craving for oysters, for me this is really the place to be at. A bucket is only $20! That is really a good deal!!! If you go to other restaurants you can only get 6pcs of oysters for 13 bucks! Thats crazy!!! \\n\\nWe also ordered the steamed shrimp and it has the old bay seasoning. Not bad to pair it with the oysters. \\n\\nI love their horseradish sauce because it wasnt that spicy or too strong. It didnt overwhelm the taste of the oysters.\\n\\nThey are open 11am.

I so wanted this love to generalize to their restaurant in Brookline. I think loyal customers keep going back because Chinese BBQ options are so limited in the Boston metro area. :/  The second visit resulted in my dining companion stating, \\"I am not satisfied; we must go to JP Licks.\\" \\n\\nThe crab entrée was an expensive meal with very little protein. It's approximately equivalent to two yakitori skewers. That's horrible given that the price point indicates one is receiving an entrée sized portion. The noodle dish was flavorless and greasy. My favorite menu item is the Asian rib appetizer; it is reminiscent of their food truck skewers. \\n\\nBottom line: The transition to their brick and mortar business model has resulted in inflated prices for the same skewers. I felt like we were paying their Brookline rent. One could stand right by the grill when ordering via the food truck. This meant that the protein options were hot and fresh.

The food is really good here. This time I was here for a birthday party with a party of 10+ and we sat in the rear corner by the plants on the wall. Some of us wondered if they used those herbs/plants in the food. Probably not, but it provides for good decorum. I had the calamari again and some of Lisa's Pork Shank, which is like a Fred Flintstones gumbo meat on the bone. It falls right off, its so tender. \\n\\nThe slow service is why I give this place 4 stars. They are attentive but slow at getting things to you.

Once our food was delivered, she didn't return to our table for a very long time but we didn't have to look far to find her: she was seated at a booth about three tables over from us.  We were able to watch her play with a fidget spinner, play on her phone and enjoy a beer (Narragansett) while our drinks sat empty.  You'd think that a table of six who were drinking on a quiet Monday night might garner some attention but apparently, she would rather have been anywhere else.  We are all restaurant people, so we tipped her;  had she been on her game - or even displayed a modicum of interest in our experience, it would have probably been twice what we left.

Arriving with two companions just after 6:00 on a Friday night, we took the next to the last parking space in this good-sized parking lot. We waited about 30 minutes for a table for three. It was one of the coldest nights of the year so we opted not to sit on the padded bench near the door. Christy was our charming and pretty waitress, one of the four or so servers who made the cut from the previous Howard's staff. I wasn't ordering beer tonight, but was curious about their dark beers. Christy helpfully suggested a sample glass of the \\"Monday Night Drafty Kilt\\". I wanted something in between Guinness and light beer and this fit the bill. I ordered the Smoked Turkey platter with side of greens (collard/kale mix) and a side of green beans. The turkey, though it was breast meat, was moist with a rich smoky flavor, just as it should be. Although the turkey was plenty flavorful without a speck of sauce, I had the \\"Alabama White\\" sauce in a cup on the side. The other sauces would have overpowered the turkey, but the white mayo-based sauce is more compatible. The greens did not taste sugared, in fact, there seemed to be some vinegar already in the broth. The green beans were typical Blue Lake type. They had a bit of chile powder for seasoning, but were not seasoned southern style and I would have preferred pole beans for their richer flavor. Texas toast came with the meal as is common in BBQ places. I asked that they consider adding cornbread muffins to the menu. One of my dining companions had cole slaw for her side dish. It wasn't bad, but you couldn't taste the Granny Smith apples they promised were in the recipe. I added a dash of vinegar to my sample and that seemed to give it the \\"tang\\" this dish needed. Her chicken, while nicely smoked, (shredded breast meat) was a bit dry in spots and she couldn't finish it. No complaints from the third diner about the pulled pork (smoky and moist). She did say the roast corn did not have enough Parmesan cheese. There are televisions on every wall, one of them quite big enough to compete with Varner's sports bar across the street. But this is clearly much more a family-type place like Howard's was, but a younger crowd with a fair number of children in tow tonight. Our waitress, Christy was friendly and attentive and I am confident this place will continue to do the necessary tweaking to get a 5th star from me on some future visit."},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Look I know this is like a Portland institution at this point but if you're not drunk late at night, you'll usually notice the slightly stale, dry texture of most of the donuts.

My friend joked about wanting to go out in a coffin full of donuts.\\n\\nSo we ordered: maple bacon donut, lemon chiffon crueller, captain my captain (captain crunch donut), hibiscus donut, the summer dream (marionberry filling with lemon frosting). \\nThe best donut was the the maple bacon donut. The bacon was savory smoked and crispy. Unfortunately, the frosting didn't gel with the bacon. \\n\\nThe summer dream wasn't bad and I liked the sound of the marionberry filling. The filling was ok but the frosting but a little too sweet for me, it tasted like a fondant. The best texture was the lemon chiffon crueller. It was a crispy and cakey but the marshmallows were unnecessary. \\n\\nThe service was curt and quick. Like NYC. So all in all, Voodoo Doughnut was fun to look, take pictures but the donuts were a little disappointing."},{"name":"Poor Calvin's","address":"510 Piedmont Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Very good food, not the usual combinations.

You would think that this restaurant is very attentive but no.  Maybe because we were Hispanic but every person deserves the same respect. Top of the hub has a beautiful view but that's all there is.

The flavor was amazing but also not the usual texture for pork belly.\\nThe hush puppies were a little sweet and very different than the usual, the outside was perfect but the inside was a little mushy almost like it wasn't cooked all the way through. \\n\\nFor entrees we had the \\nTuna which was just your standard Tuna fairly good!\\nThe Brisket was a must have if you enjoy BBQ, the coleslaw was also pretty spot on.\\nThe Mongolian beef looked like chef boyardee and I thought it would be crispier.\\nThe burger was pretty legit! I think it couldn't have been any better!\\n\\nDessert..\\nDessert was a mess. The ice cream was no good. It melts too fast. The strawberry elderflower was gross and the malted vanilla was lackluster. The kandy krush was just a Reese's cup with a lot of peanut butter. \\n\\nNow for the reason why this restaurant is rated 3 stars. The drama of it all were the servers. Our server was so sad and so disappointed when we asked for new silverware because one of us didn't have any and the other just had two knifes. Then he took forever that other servers did us a solid and helped him out. Which was all right until then because it's a big place, it was busy. Now. When the desserts arrived. It was delivered by a random server who ignored my questions to him and didn't explain anything. Being the first time I've dined here, I had no idea what each dish was and just assumed he gave us the wrong things. Now it took until all the ice cream he placed on our table had melted before I finally decided to walk up to our server and ask him what was up. Our original server apologized. Explained things. And I had to have him replace the ice cream because they took so long to realize there was a problem. \\nThe manager came by I let her know what happened and she apologized then rushed off. \\n\\nAnd finally when I thought the madness would end. None of the servers came to our table after that and it took another 15 minutes of mindless waiting and no eye contact from the servers before a different server came to our rescue and gave us our checks. \\nAgain there were more problems with how they split the checks but that's okay that's a normal problem. \\n\\n\\nIn retrospect I probably should have just walked up sooner but I decided to be polite and not harass them too much. \\n\\nFor the money I don't know if this restaurant was the best. \\nWould I come again? Probably not unless it was necessary. \\nWould I recommend this place?

You order from the counter, assembly line style as you pick your toppings. They also have a few pre picked choices.\\n\\nSince it was my first time, I opted for a pre picked called the Bianca. It was pasta, rose (alfredo and tomato) sauce, sun dried tomatoes, artichoke, chicken, with pancetta crumbled on top and I added spinach. I also got a piada stick which is flat bread with stuff inside - I  got the pepperoni for 1.95. They put it on the griddle right in front of you so it is all warm when you eat it, it tasted like pizza. The pasta was pretty good. They only have regular spaghetti, I agree with other reviews that it would be cool to see at least on more pasta option.  They also put some sort of parmesan creamy dressing on the dish that I didn't know it was an option but it was good. Everything was flavorful but I did have a qualm with the shrooms, they were raw and I thought it was a bit weird but I guess they do that because you can also get a salad bowl which generally comes with raw shrooms. By the time I was done the remaining shrooms had soaked up the sauce and were just fine. \\n\\nThe food was good and the price was decent - around $11 for the pasta, the stick and a drink but I also had a scoutmob which made it an awesome deal. Everything was very clean and the counter where you choose looked well maintained and the toppings seemed fresh.

I'd be happy to pay for jelly since it's amazing and homemade, but most places offer it for free when you're ordering toast.

I don't even know where to start. I'm not from Atlanta so when I was planning my trip, I looked through yelp to see what restaurants are good. Poor Calvin's was at the VERY top with the most reviews and 4.5 stars. OBVIOUSLY that means it's good right? WRONG! I came here on my very last day for my very last meal and I am SO extremely upset!! \\n\\nFirstly, I read some of the reviews and I saw there was a long wait time, I didn't have a reservation because it was just me and my friend so we just walked in. We came around 9pm and the hostess said it's about a 15 minute wait, which we were completely ok with. The one thing that none of these reviews has mention was how LOUD this place was. Like, EVERYONE was talking over each other because the music was so loud. So imagine trying to talk to your friend but the two tables between you are talking super loud and the music is super loud. I thought this was a restaurant, not a club... A few minutes went by and the hostess asked us if we wanted to sit at the commuters table but we didn't want to so we told her we could wait for an available table. Then in a minute or so, another worker called me name and told me that we can ONLY sit at the commuters table cause all the other tables were reserved. So we agreed to sit at the commuters table (btw I later found out that that was BS, there was a table available for 2 right next to us and the people who sat there DIDN'T have a reservation either ). Just as a note by this time it was around 9:10pm* \\n\\nAnyways, we were looking through the menu and I had a vague idea of what I wanted to get but I still wanted to see what else they had. Our waiter came and she asked us how we're doing and my friend and I BOTH said good, however my friend was looking at the menu when she responded and the waitress thought my friend didn't say anything and in a extremely rude tone she said to my friend \\"miss, I asked you how you're doing\\". Ugh, let me just say, I'm from NYC and NYC is suppose to be known to have rude people but I have yet to come across someone like this. She asked us if we wanted anything to drink from the bar and we both said no. My friend is underage and I was driving so I wasn't planning on drinking. After we said no to alcoholic drinks, she kept pushing us to order other drinks like tea and etc. When we said no again, and that we're ok with just water, she STILL kept pushing for us to order drinks. We told her to give us some time to decide on what we want. She came back later and took our order, we ordered the lobster Mac and cheese, the pad Thai, and the scallop curry. So normally when me and my friends go out, we tell each other what we want and one of us just orders for everyone(cause as Asians, we eat family style so we share everything), so that's what I was about to do but she cut me off before I could even order for my friend. Then she kept pushing us to order an appetizer but we already ordered 3 things for 2 people. It wouldn't make sense to order more. \\n\\nBy this time, it was about 9:20pm /9:25pm and a family of 4 came and was seated next to us at the commuters table. They ordered a couple minutes after us and got their meals first!! All we got was our Lobster mac and cheese (which btw didn't even look like the pictures on yelp and wasn't even that great ). \\n\\nNow THIS is what REALLY pissed me off. It was now like 10:15pm, the family of 4 had already gotten their food and FINISHED. THEY FINISHED their food and our food didn't even come yet. We had to call the waitress over to ask her and she just said \\"uh lemme check\\". She comes back and said \\"oh well they were waiting for you guys to finish the lobster Mac and cheese\\". Let me just say, NO ONE WAS CHECKING UP IN US, NO ONE ASKED US IF WE WANTED OUR ENTREES, AND NO ONE BOTHERED TO EVEN TELL US THAT IN ADVANCED!! We stopped eating the Mac and cheese over 30 minutes ago!! She said they will bring our food out in a few minutes and it was taking so long to a point that I told my friend if our food doesn't come in the next 30 seconds, I'm leaving. Right when I said that our food came out and I've completely lost my appetite. I was angry and extremely upset that once the guy put our food down, I asked him to pack it. Let me just say, it was 10:30pm now. What place makes a customer wait 1 HOUR for their food to come out?? I really truly wish I was exaggerating about the time, I really do. It's utterly ridiculous. \\n\\nI paid for the food and just left. This place wasn't cheap either, for 3 things I paid $78. They made the food so I'll still pay it, but the waitress did NOT, in my opinion, deserve a tip. I came here to support a fellow asian who has worked hard to open a successful restaurant in this kind of area but I am extremely disappointed of how I was treated.

We see two servers as we are seated so I know  they seen us. Now its 8:20 neither one of the servers has come  over yet and another table get sat after us. The guy server drops a tray jack it so loud and says sorry and after he drops food still dont approach our table. so the table after us ask for a server to the host, so I stopped the host said can we get a server too? The waiter then goes to table that came in after us and greet them and took order and he was getting ready to walk past our table again and I stopped him and said ummm can we get server over here? He says let me drop menu ill be back so by time he come to get order its was darn there 8:30 smh.\\n\\n I was done by then but my bf calmer then me convinced me to just stay bc that was the worst experience I had and it wasn't busy to be ignored. The short ribs and yams were good. I didnt like the bland mac and cheese or greens or strawberry lemonade. \\n\\nThey said it was a dress code so my bf changed, yet ppl was in there with sneakers, hats, jeans etc. They are overpriced and overrated bc TI name is involved and he should be ashamed of the rude and unprofessional staff he has representing him. Needless to say we WON'T be going back mainly bc of the service and mediocre food."},{"name":"Andina Restaurant","address":"1314 NW Glisan St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"I really would give this five stars but I've only been here once and maybe I just got lucky. Really, really lucky. The place was packed on a Sunday night - good sign. We chose to sit at the bar so we could order right away, plus I like sitting at the bar because the bartenders talk to you and usually you can get good tips about the food and drinks; it's also a great way to see how smoothly a place runs.\\n\\nWe caught the tail end of happy hour so we only tried bits from that menu but the dinner menu looks phenomenal; I'll definitely be going back for a full dinner next time I'm in town. We tried a couple of their house cocktails - Sacsayhuamán (house-infused habanero vodka with passionfruit) and Ron-Yki-Ón (roasted ginger rum and grapefruit juice) - both were delicious; the sweetness of the passionfruit balanced out the spiciness of the habanero and the roasted ginger/grapefruit was so refreshing - and served with a cardamom sugar rim. \\n\\nWe had just arrived in the city after four nights of camping so this was just our first stop on a foodie tour of the neighborhood; we ordered the Tiradito de Betarraga and the Anticucho de Pulpo from the happy hour menu. Everything was fresh and tasty, the octopus was cooked so nicely and they obviously make their own sauces (they also served us some bread with a trio of their own salsas which were excellent). At the end when the bartender found out that it had been my birthday the day before he offered us a dessert on the house. Hooray for sitting at the bar! We tried Canutos de Quinua Y Maracuyá at his recommendation (the dessert menu was too amazing to choose one) - cannolis made with quinoa and a passionfruit filling, served with some mango-lemongrass sorbet. The quinoa added a nice texture and the flavors came together really well. Overall, this place won me over; after I go back and have more food I'll probably bump my rating to five stars."},{"name":"Two Urban Licks","address":"820 Ralph McGill Blvd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"My husband and I went here one evening for the salmon chips (which are very good) however, we didn't realize getting 2 orders of salmon chips and 3 alcoholic drinks would cost us $70 bucks!!!! (Make sure to take a full wallet) Also, we don't normally eat entrees there because of the prices, but this time we noticed there were a  few flies and gnats around the prep area. We did notify the chef which he said he would keep an eye out for the food, but  the flies were having a feast. Other than that it is a cool spot to hang out!"},{"name":"Leaf Vegetarian Restaurant","address":"1710 Pearl St","city":"Boulder","stars":"4","text":"leaf never disappoints!

Excellent service!"},{"name":"Folk Art Restaurant","address":"465 N Highland Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"The food was ok. My biggest complaint was the hostess. Tall, slim young lady with lots of attitude and no personality. Not the right job for her. If she is a representation of first impressions, you have failed miserably. I'm not the only patron who felt this way, everyone who waited for a table had the same gripe. There are tons of young people who would appreciate this opportunity. She needs to be replaced. Immediately!"},{"name":"Rossi Bar And Kitchen","address":"895 N High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"I was hearing things about Rossi so it was time to go here. It's kind of a hipster haven but it's a nice place for a classy time out. The atmosphere is festive but you can hear a conversation. It has a good collection of cocktails. The food is mostly worth it's cost. \\n\\nI had come in mind for the happy hour. It has some good food here, but you're missing out if you don't get something from the bar. The happy hour is by far the best time to come. It's so much cheaper and you can get some off the food too. The food is what you would consider fine. It won't blow you away but it's something able to be eaten again. There are some vegetarian items there. A few happy hour items are cheap. The crispy chickpeas is $2. It's seasoned with lemon and paprika. The very good spicy Sichuan cucumber salad is $3. It comes with crunchy peanuts. The coolest thing is the Prisoner, which is usually very expensive, but here it's about $50.\\n\\nI would go to Rossi again for another night out. It's where you want to go to be seen. The food is good so try it when you go there."},{"name":"Gracie's","address":"729 SW 15th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"5 stars for ambiance and 4 stars for the meal, so I'm rounding up. \\nWe came here during March's Portland Monthly Dining for the $29 3-course meal. \\nLet me start by saying this restaurant is gorgeous old-style Hollywood in a gorgeous old-style Hollywood hotel. Think linen tablecloths and chandeliers. Think suit jackets and ties and cocktail dresses and heels. \\n\\nI've been to the Hotel deLuxe for happy hour at their bar, the Driftwood Room but never had dinner at Gracie's. Finding the $29 deal meant having no excuse not to get dressed up and go, and so we called up our fanciest friends, put on our finest Audrey Hepburn-like attire and made a reservation..and Gracie's did not disappoint!  \\n\\nBelow is the 2-die-4 menu we got to choose from. We all tried to order something different so we could sample each others meals and we all agreed that everything was wonderful. This is not an event to miss. 11 months from now we will be doing this again and I recommend everyone does. Now, we just have to come back in the summer for their rooftop movie nights. \\n\\nFirst course (choose one):\\nBeet root tartare with horseradish green apple vinaigrette, ricotta, pickled mustard seeds, crisp capers and warm naan \\n-OR-\\nGem salad with black garlic and olive dressing, lemon brioche croutons, marinated white anchovy and shaved Parmesan \\n-OR-\\nWarm escarole salad with smoked pork belly, grilled onions, apple, Roquefort cheese, currant dressing and spiced walnuts\\n\\nSecond course (choose one):\\nCrab fondue with fontina and gruyere cheeses, kirsch and country bread \\n-OR-\\nShrimp and cheddar grits, serrano ham, jalapeño sour cream and shrimp buerre blanc \\n-OR-\\nCrisp salt cod cakes with vadouvan curry aioli\\n\\nThird course (choose one):\\nMiso-glazed sablefish with shabu broth, couscous, soy-glazed shiitake, edamame and bok choy \\n-OR-\\nBacon-wrapped chicken with asparagus, andouille sausage and shrimp étouffée \\n-OR-\\nSeared scallops with saffron cream, melted leeks and potato brandade"},{"name":"Frank","address":"407 Colorado St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I'm factoring in the joy my brother exudes every time he's in town and he gets to eat at Frank.

Their dogs were good, so to Frank I went. I've also started a mostly paleo/primal lifestyle, which means for hot dogs, it's just the dog for me. Meat is paleo. But meat by itself wasn't enough. Talking with one of their bartenders, they agreed to cut up a Jackalope dog and add it to their house salad. Insta paleo!
