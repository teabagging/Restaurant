I splurged on a special of the day dessert- Sticky Toffee Pundding- also a winner.  So, as far as food goes this is a great place.

Its close proximity to both Forest Hills Station and the arnold arboretum make it a convenient meeting place to grab a quick coffee or bite. Their food menu is varied with many breakfast and lunch options that frequently change with the season or as they roll out new offerings. They are very accommodating for both Gluten Free and vegan eaters, and when I order a sandwich on their fresh GF oatmeal bread their staff always takes the time to note whether I have a Gluten allergy or whether it is a preference. When I tell them \\"allergy\\" they note it and take special care in the preparation and handling of my sandwich, which I wish more places would do. My personal favorite- the turkey avocado sandwich, which I get minus the cheddar and on oatmeal bread so that it is dairy and Gluten Free. Additionally, no extra amount is charged for non-dairy milks in coffee/ beverages- a bonus compared to Starbucks or Dunkin Donuts. In the past, I have experienced a couple of minor issues with coming here. On occasion, their service can be a little bit slow, which can be nerve wracking if in a rush to get on the T. But, I suppose that expecting a fresh made and delicious sandwich to come out as fast as the microwaved ones offered at Dunkin or Starbucks is unreasonable. Seating is often very limited during peak times, and parking can also be somewhat difficult now that the overpass construction is limiting parking in the area.

It doesn't have the ambiance that Punjab had, but the food is so good it doesn't really matter (well ...would be nice to have a bit better decor...maybe they will renovate down the road of things go well) .

By the time 11 rolled around, the line was making it's way around the parking lot and up the street. It's definitely worth bringing chairs to sit while you wait. We saw a guy renting chairs across the street for 5 bucks each - a simple way to cash in on people waiting with nowhere to sit. If you got there early to wait in line and need to use the restroom, the employees are accommodating and will let you use the restrooms. I'd definitely rate Franklin BBQ top of the game here in Austin. We ordered enough food to feed a small family and still had leftovers. We ordered:1 lb brisket - both lean & fatty cuts\\n1 lb pork ribs\\n1/2 lb pulled pork (shoulder aka pork \\"butt\\")\\nBourbon banana pudding pieThe brisket was absolute perfection - seasoned well, had a nice crust, and was moist / tender throughout. Even the lean cuts were moist and tender. The smoke ring was pronounced on the meats we ordered, which was a good sign. The ribs and pulled pork were both on point.

That's why I came to Alden & Harlow at 10:30 AM to get one. It was great. The beef itself was smoky and juicy. The greens, onions, and pickles, were awesome, and the cheese crisp and secret sauce are the \\"special\\" ingredients that make it unique. This burger looks fairly normal. It tastes really different than it looks, however. Good charring on the bread, smoky beef, the sharpness of cheddar, the salty cheesiness of the secret sauce... it all combines to create an umami-bomb of flavor that is kept in check by the brightness of the pickles and salted onions.Brunch was a definite win today and helped cement Alden & Harlow as one of the great restaurants in Boston, in my humble opinion."},{"name":"Pallookaville Fine Foods","address":"17N Avondale Plz","city":"Avondale Estates","stars":"3.5","text":"Every.

It was an equal balance of sweet, tangy, and spicy. They separated the wings in half so the center was also seasoned and flavored. The fry sampler was delicious too. You can't go wrong with truffle mayo!I thought our server was very helpful as well. I didn't know what drink to get and he asked what flavors do I like. I asked for something sweet and sour and he recommended the pisco sour. They have an extensive drink menu! It's definitely a place to go to try. The snacks are good to get to share with your friends and they go well with the drinks."},{"name":"Cypress Street Pint & Plate","address":"817 W Peachtree St NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"This place was simply delicious!

Our table was ready even though we were late for our reservation and we were promptly seated in an intimate corner.A server came by to take our drink order but nothing really stood out for me since I didn't see vodka on their signature drink list. He recommended I try the \\"M√®re\\" ($9) made with Hendricks Gin, Dubonnet Rouge and Lemon and he had a face that I could trust so my normal vodka drink was swapped out for gin and I actually liked it.The bf ordered the \\"Biter\\" ($9) made with Beefeater Gin, Cheartruse Vert, Lemon Juice, Home Made Absinthe Bitters which I didn't even consider after seeing Cheartruse.  The smell alone was enough to get me tipsy. I gave him ample warning yet he wondered why he was feeling \\"something\\" after that drink. Well that's because you just consumed jet fuel my dear. It's a strong drink but I'll stick to my weaker concoction any day.Part of the reason I picked this place was the French inspired menu because the bf has never had escargot in his life so I had to change that and we both love foie gras  (gasp) so indulgence had to be repeated when given the opportunity.I've had escargot a couple of times but it was never served like this! Their escargot ($9) was topped on house made brioche, garlic & leek, pistou. The color took me by surprise as it is a bright green but it was fresh and very flavorful.We also ordered the sonoma county foie gras ($13) which is pan roasted with balsamic, house brioche, berry dressed fennel salad, almond butter.  There were so many flavors and textures going on that every bite was different yet the same, which was delicious.Both our appetizers were fantastic and we still had our main orders to look forward to. The bf ordered the pan-roasted lamb leg ($24) with rago√ªt of flageolet bean with boudin blanc & foie gras, meyer lemon pur√©e, spring shoots & boquerones .  He polished the entire plate off so that says something right?I decided to order the poulet en cocotte ($25) because I had to see what all the fuss was about after reading reviews stating this dish would sell out before the night was over. Their chicken is a half bird preparation of pan roasted breast, confit leg, farro risotto with seasonal produce, chicken demi-glace and a slow poached egg.  This dish is bomb!  The confit melts in your mouth and everything was cooked perfectly. The breast was still moist and we even noticed the pearl onions were still crisp yet cooked throughout.  I even ate the radishes on top and I don't care for radishes.  Seriously ridiculous delicious.  I couldn't finish it off so the small portion I had left was boxed up after the server and my bf suggested that I could make breakfast with it the next day.  I wasn't sure that was possible but I took it anyways because I had to try and eat somehow the following day.  FYI, I made the best tasting omelet for brunch and I can't wait to eat there again!\\nMy only regret is not having enough room for dessert but luckily they also give you madeleines to take home and eat later.

You totally led me astray! So, here's how this little mistake happened. I was yelping places to get my skeeball fix and Kung Fu had about 200 reviews and a 4.5 star rating. This sounds pretty promising right? Turns out it's not. I'm also going to put this disclaimer out there though, it was totally slammed. Had I gone at noon on Wednesday, this might be a totally different review. I went on a Sunday afternoon hoping to get a little skeeball action since it's FREE. The place was packed, we were standing shoulder-to-shoulder with the other patrons. This took me by surprise considering it was a Sunday afternoon in February. No biggie though, I'm totally down with a good time. Well, until I realized that most of the patrons in the bar were menacingly wasted. I assumed my position in the skeeball line and the girl in front of me was so drunk that she had some sort of spastic eruption every time she 'tossed' the skeeball. It was so graceless in fact, that every time she 'tossed' the ball, everyone within 5 feet ducked in synchronicity.  Again, no big deal, I have the reflexes of a cat, I can dodge that. It's even relatively funny when she channels her inner Beyonce and serenades all of us in line to her sweet rendition of Single Ladies. She squeezes out the first three lines of the song before collapsing, on her knees, facing the skeeball machine for a mid afternoon nap, with her head resting on her thighs. Awesome! She's not even the drunkest girl there either. She's the opening act. Then there's the skeeball machine. First I'm stoked that it's free, I couldn't be happier. Until I pick up the balls. They are so heavily coated in alcohol,and bad decisions, that they are sticking to my hand. Allegedly, the girl before me wasn't as uncoordinated as I had suspected, she was trying to release the adhesive ball from her hand. Again, just the beginning of this adventure. The skeeballs themselves were chipped and battered that they roll like legos down the warped and battered lanes and into angular holes. If you manage to nail one of the holes, you may or may not get the points- it's a crap shoot. Sometimes the sensors catch the lego, other times it does, but randomizes the score. This doesn't even annoy me, to adds a playful element of surprise to skeeball. Then there's the guy behind me.  Each time I lean forward to roll the ball, he leans forward with me, and then onto me. He's so drunk that his equilibrium is being set to the vertical objects in front of him. When they move forward, he moves forward, when they back up, he clumsily moves backward. Balancing a dude  on your back while trying to skee lego's is not as easy as you think. When I ask him to step aside, he just moves behind another guy and does the exact same thing to him. This, turns out, is hilarious. Not mad at all about it, not one bit, for I have a new game.The bathroom. The bathroom. This is perhaps, the biggest bathroom shit show I've seen since my 21st birthday at Oil Can Harry's. The only thing missing from this situation is a pregnant, bald, barefoot Britney Spears. In it there are a handful of different girls, each seemingly trying to convince themselves that they're sober. One girl is leaning forward and backward, gazing into the mirror, probably giving her inner sober person a pep talk. Then there's the girl whose lying on the floor amidst a shower of wet paper towels repeating with laughter to everyone that walks over her, \\"I'm throwing up, I'm throwing up\\". To her credit though, she was perfectly correct, and she had a very positive attitude about it.  The girls that are coming and going, in a pitiful state of intoxication, have given up entirely on locating the trash can, in which they should be throwing their used paper towels, because some girl is leaning over it. So, that explains the shower of paper towels on the floor. And alas, the creepers. Outside the bathroom awaits a trail of dudes hoping to catch some salmon swimming upstream toward sobriety.I can't speculate about the quality of the drinks or their prices, I didn't stay long enough to even get one, I had to go home and shower.

A couple with a child arrived shortly afterward.  Within about an hour, however, the place began to fill up.  We ordered four rolls and a side of shumai.  The food was quite good, and it came out in reasonably quick amount of time.  Our server was courteous.  I couldn't tell by the reviews or the pictures online before going whether this was a fancy restaurant or not.  It is not.  Don't get me wrong -- it is not dirty or unattractive.  But it is definitely not an upscale sushi restaurant like Akai Hana or others in the area.  It seems more like a family business.  We both agreed that the price of a couple of the rolls exceeded their taste quality, but that does not mean that they were not good -- they were.  So, will I be back?  Yes, probably.

The performers did an amazing job to give up the energy before, during, and even after after the show. This show is meant to keep the audience engaged and asks for participation from the audience. This means everything from just sitting in your chair and making noise to becoming a part of the show. Before the show you can get there early and they put on a sort of preshow and have a bar and the gypsy was doing stunts. After the show they put on some dance music and had a bit of an after party and you could order drinks for about 30 minutes afterwards. The pirates were out afterwards dancing with children and taking photos. During the show there was comedy, a good storyline, and some amazing acrobatic stunts by the gypsy and the green pirate. The acrobatics alone were absolutely amazing, the gypsy is a gorgeous woman who has an amazing strength and abilities to do the things she does (gypsy call me,  maybe!?). Her counterpart (the green pirate) is also awesome,  I will not give away what they do for stunts but it is worth watching.  Our pirate was Jack, the red pirate. He did a spectacular job of keeping us engaged and letting us know when and what to yell out. jack and the rest of the pirates all participate in some acrobatics and some fight scenes. They are all amazing and make it all worthwhile. I just can not bring myself to give it a perfect score because we did have issues with booking. we called to try and split payment between a gift card and a debit card and they were unable to figure out how and said it would just be pending payment until we heard from them again. Instead of calling or allowing us to pay at the window they went ahead and charged the card. When asking if our discounts were put on at the window the lady was baffled and could not figure out what we were charged, guess the bank statement will tell. Also had the steak dinner upgrade and that was also apparently not put onto our tickets, again don't know if we were charged for it or not.

Not having been born or raised in Texas, I discovered bbq at the ripe age of 29 and wondered how I had lived my life unaware of the succulence that is only found in a seasoned side of brisket in a well loved old smoker.  I thought my arteries would clog shut within my first six months in Austin.And so I've made it my mission to try it anywhere I can find it in Texas.  I've searched far and wide and eaten in many a dive bbq establishment, and my desire to try every food I could find coming out of a trailer in Austin led me to kill two birds with one stone and visit Franklin's today at lunch.I read the other reviews and knew I should be there early, so we arrived at 10:35 and became numbers 4 and 5 in line.  By the time they opened the gates at 11, the line was fully 25 people long (and it grew after we got our food and sat down).  I could tell from the growing line that either the food I was about to eat was pretty darn good or that everyone else had read the same reviews I had.The food was pretty darn tasty!  I can't say it's the absolute best I've ever had, but it certainly gives the best a run for its sauce.  The brisket was moist and tasty, the ribs fell off the bone, and the chopped pork was heavenly (especially since I haven't been able to find chopped pork anywhere here since I left the midAtlantic).  Their sauces are... interesting.  My boyfriend liked the espresso laced sauce, but I wasn't a huge fan of either of the sauce choices.I do wish they were open for dinner rather than lunch, since I'm rarely ready for such a heavy meal that early in the day, but it was pretty good stuff.

We had been traveling and not dressed in our finest but certainly clean and presentable and as well dressed as others in the restaurant. However, we certainly did not get the warm reception we expected. He obviously knew the three women who came after us and directed them to the bar after he had barely spoken to us. We were seated at a table which had been empty when we walked in but he had made us wait. Our waiter took his cue from Tony. He served us but certainly made us feel as though we weren't good enough for him to have to wait on us. The food was good but we won't be giving Tony our business again.

Just looking at it in the box, I knew it was not like other pizza you get from around here. It looks really different. This could very well be how pizza looks like in Italy, a place I've always wanted to go to for pizza.Pretty much every aspect of this pizza brims with quality. It's made with excellent ingredients and the sauce is great. The Mozerella cheese is pearl white, and the basil leaves are put on there whole. It's lovely. It's not greasy, it's healthy.The price is very decent. Yes, looking at a 10 inch pizza for 10$ might at first seem a little pricey, but when you consider all the toppings you can add at no extra charge... and when you consider that if you buy three you get each pizza for around 8.33$, and then you add the excellent quality and service on top of that, it's really not expensive at all. I left completely satisfied.One thing though, that I really love, is the straightforwardness of the menu, and the way you can specify the pizza. So you know a pizza will cost the same no matter what it has on it. On the menu, I see no. 4, The Verdura, it says they put fresh vegetables on it. I wanted a pizza with vegetables on it and I don't know what to expect, but I don't care, I like vegetables in general. So I call them up and ask for one, first question I get is, \\"are there any vegetables you don't like?\\", and I confess I really just had 3 or 4 vegetable toppings in mind. I ask for them, and they're more than happy to oblige. They even suggest little additions you might have otherwise forgotten, like basil leaves. It's like I'm dealing with normal people doing their craft, and they sell pizza. You're not going to get the machine-like standardness specified by large pizza selling corporations, and you're not going to have the pizza's price skyrocket as you add toppings. So relax, buy a pizza made in a wood oven by people who do this for the sake of making a good pizza, and for an honest living.Maybe they don't sell drinks. Maybe the place is small and inside an average grocery store, but I came here for a good pizza and that's what I got. I understand that some people don't like those details, but consider that a diamond is a diamond, even if it's in the rough.

I suggest a half pound of each will last 2 meals plus. The tender brisket is delicious. It falls apart as you pick it up. With a dark outer bark and thick smoke ring the flavour is peppery and smokey. Sliced lean or fatty I opted for the latter with much delight. Thick cut and dripping with flavour your tastebuds will be happy you waited. The pork ribs are delicious and fall off the bone. Served right out of the tin foil, these meaty morsels do not disappoint. The dry rub is peppery and the smoke ring is thick.

Wanting to buy some time for the storm to clear,  we stopped in here for a late lunch. When our food came,  we were regretting having eaten a large breakfast. It was so delicious, we wished we had had  room for more. We started with hummous and tabouleh with flat bread. All fresh and fabulous. We then moved on to chicken kabobs....over the top. The flavor and juicyness of the chicken was perfect, accentuated by spice and toasted  nut  accented rice and garlic sauce. The service was great and timing gracious. Freddy, the chef, or Violette, the waitress, kept an eye on our progress with the first two before bringing out the chicken. We ended with Lebanese coffee, infused with cardomon. Be sure to get one. It doe not need sugar or milkk/cream. Just enjoy.

Pint - Yes.Plate - NO.The location, patio, and atmosphere have all contributed to a few fun times here, but the food is lacking almost completely across the board.The Corn Puppies, house ketchup, fries, and the burger complete it for me.  Everything else on the menu has always seemed in some way to come up waaaaay short.  Whether it be lacking flavor, too much dried spices, or just not good at all, I've decided that Cypress Street just doesn't do it for me.

I love the way the egg is, thin and delicious, allowing for lots of filling. But besides the omelette, everything else is inconsistent. Service is ok- pleasant but slow with water refill. The hash browns or whatever it is they call it, is basically a baked potato chopped up. Barely warm, mushy. No crisp or flavor. If you want tomatoes instead, it's extra. So I feel that though the omelette is excellent, the value is not there since that is all that is good on the plate.

Average at best."},{"name":"Screen Door","address":"2337 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Back again for the 2nd time and the food is still amazing!!!

Zuppa's is one of them, and I sternly believe that it is one of the finest. Instead of joining the fight for the most progressive and avant-garde way to satisfy your hunger, Zuppa's sells sandwiches and salads that are filling, tasty, and relatively inexpensive. There's a few wraps on the menu that may have one toe in the water of experimentation (like the Oriental Chicken Wrap, for example) but nothing here is wild enough to merit a second thought before you slap down the cash and cram it in your gullet. My favorite salad here is some sort of concoction that consists of a mess of pastas like ravioli, penne, and rotini in a zesty Italian dressing type sauce. It can use more dressing at times, but otherwise it's enormous and incredibly rewarding while still feeling a bit on the lighter side. The turkey sandwich is a lunch time staple that Zuppa's does incredibly well. One item I must warn you about is the chicken salad, which is pretty terrible. Besides the fact that is contains almonds- which I absolutely abhor- the portions are very meager. It's never a surprise when this guy is last picked in the grab-and-go case. Get some meat on your bones and try out again next year, kid. Other than the chicken salad, this place is a solid lunchtime solution that's worth a shot if you're sick of eating Chipotle or reheated Hamburger Helper every day. Lord knows I am."},{"name":"Franklin Barbecue","address":"900 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Do the pre-order and get the brisket and ribs. The bad thing about a place that is so popular is the wait. While doing research, I read about needing to get in line at 7am for Franklin's opening at 11am! Additionally, they usually run out of food by 12pm. We only had three days in Austin, waking up early to spend the better part of half of a day for some BBQ seemed a little ridiculous. Thankfully, during my research, I found out that Franklin does pre-orders. Yes, there is a minimum of 5lbs (!) of meat or a full rack of ribs, but Adam and I weighed the pros and cons and felt that it was worth it. The nice part is that you can mix and match meats (meaning we got to try a variety!) for the pre-order. The rules are strict: you must pick up your pre-order between 10:15am and 10:35am-or you forfeit your meat. Additionally, they do not provide any plates or utensils, it is strictly for take-out. They run a tight ship, but with people having waited in line for four hours, there has to be some type of system in place.\\nNote: We did our pre-order about a month before heading to Austin. However, when I took a look a couple of days before we left, the pre-orders were sold out for the next two months. So, if this is the route you want to take, you definitely want to plan ahead!Right around the corner from Franklin was a CVS where we were able to get paper plates, napkins and utensils. We overheard someone asking the first person in line what time he arrived; he stated that had been there since 5:30am (!!!).Franklin has both an inside and outside seating area. There were about 5 picnic tables outside. The inside space was pretty bare bones with a bunch of wooden tables and red chairs.We walked up to the counter and I gave my name and they read back our order to ensure it was correct - 3lbs brisket, 1lb ribs, 1lb turkey and a pint of potato salad. All take-out orders come with white bread, pickles, onions and BBQ sauce (though the meat definitely doesn't need it!). We watched as they cut all the meats for the order, I appreciated that everything wasn't pre-packaged even thought they already knew the orders ahead of time.We took our bag hurriedly back to our car and set up a \\"table\\" on the trunk. We could actually see the end of the Franklin line from our car, though we were far enough away not to cause any anger from those that were patiently waiting. We had thought about finding a park nearby to maybe eat but there really isn't much around Franklin and we wanted to eat the BBQ as soon as possible. Thus, the car trunk was the best bet! :)The pint of potato salad ($4.50) was a nice counterpoint to the immense amount of meat we had ordered. It had a nice bite from some mustard and the potatoes were cooked perfectly. Who am I kidding? Let's talk about the meat!We started with the glistening pork ribs ($15/lb) that were speckled with coarse black pepper. These were literally the best ribs I have ever eaten. Full disclosure: I don't eat a ton of ribs. However, we ate a bunch of other ribs on our trip through Texas and nothing compared to these ribs. They were perfectly cooked and pulled easily from the bone with a smokiness that was only intensified by the rub slathered on the ribs. The sauce was slightly sweet with a nice kick from the coarse pepper. The meat was so tender, I didn't even know ribs could be this tender! We literally still dream about these ribs and I will always compare other ribs to these. You must get the ribs.Everyone talks about Franklin's brisket ($17/lb), with many stating it is the best brisket in Texas. Everyone was right. The brisket was so moist and tender. It was obviously well cured, as the meat was so flavorful. Additionally, the bark on the brisket was exceptional. We totally understood all the fuss about the brisket.The turkey was incredibly moist and had a good rub on it that added some great flavor. The ribs and brisket definitely outshone the turkey (just personal preference based on type and cut of meat), but if you're a fan of turkey I would definitely recommend trying it. It was some of the best turkey I've ever had.Did Franklin BBQ live up to the hype? Absolutely. The bad part was that we went to Franklin first and then ended up going to Lockhart on our last day in Austin. Big mistake. Everything we had in Lockhart didn't even compare to what we ate at Franklin. I wish we had had more stomach space, I had really planned for us to check out John Mueller Meat Co. or la Barbecue but they weren't open on Monday and I didn't realize until Monday that we wouldn't be able to get there. Sadness. Oh well, dreaming about Franklin's ribs and brisket will have to get me through the nights until we're back in Austin to try even more BBQ and get a taste of Franklin again."},{"name":"Porter Ale House & Gastropub","address":"3715 S 1st St, Ste A","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I don't do happy hour often, but when I do, I choose Porter.

You can dress up a little if you feel like it, or not if you don't. D√©cor is super modern and lighting is moody while still being able to see three feet in front of you. It feels homey, which I realize is a contradiction with the 'classy' thing, but they pull it off. Clientele are locals and the staff are very personable and friendly. Owners send out free sushi the past 3 times we've been there, and the good stuff too! TVs over the bar with sports, which is a bit weird with the classy vibe but let's face it, sometimes you want a fancy cocktail and some uni while watching the game. Strikes a good balance.Sushi is good, and reasonably priced. Menu has a lot of options for the non-sushi eaters as well. You can go pricey if you want, or keep it budget, but either way you're getting quality. Cocktails are on freaking point. Strength is there, flavors are there, garnish is there, price is reasonable. I'm a devoted beer drinker and I love getting cocktails here.  Criticisms: The kitchen in the back and the sushi bar are completely out of sync. My wife doesn't eat sushi and every time we've been there her items arrived randomly or very late after receiving mine. I ate half my entr√©e and waited 15 minutes for hers to arrive.

By the way, there have been positive changes in the last two or three years according to the folks who were eating there at the next table so I'll take their word for it...First of all, finding the place is not as easy as it may seem.  We walked from North Station and had a couple of friends who were supposed to join us and they wandered the streets for 15 minutes until they were able to get directions.  But once inside, the cacophony of aromas was just delightful.  As well as the vertiginous pace of the servers carrying numerous plates of everything from fish, octopus, calamari, duck, beef, chicken, noodles, you name it.  We tried to decipher the menu but that wasn't to be, the menu is in Chinese.  So we settled for just pointing and eating, pointing, and eating.

But I wasn't feeling much like going out, so I thought we'd order Chinese food delivery (normally we don't get that, because he's not a big fan of vegetarian Chinese food, so we don't eat a lot of it, but since it was my birthday and all...)So I read all these Yelp reviews to pick somewhere good. This place got good reviews. So we ordered. Their web site clearly listed the hours during which it would take online orders for delivery (which happened to be until 9:45 p.m.). My order was within the appropriate time frame (placed at 9:40 p.m.). I got an order confirmation by email, listing my delivery time as 10:25 p.m. Let me also note that I ordered $50 worth of food. To make a long story short: the food never arrived. These people went home at 9:30 p.m. before I even ordered! So my phone calls and email trying to figure out when my food would arrive, all took place over an hour after they had left the restaurant. So they got my email today and called me all \\"is this order for today? because don't you know, we close at 9:30 p.m.!\\" like it was my mistake. I had to walk the woman through the confirmation email on the phone, and I ended up making a powerpoint slide with screen shots of their online ordering site, the listed hours, my confirmation email with delivery time... If I need to use PowerPoint in the aftermath of a delivery or takeout order, it's already probably a lost cause (no, this isn't the first time - I had to make a THREE-SLIDE powerpoint once for Cosi in the process of trying to use their web site and their little Cosi Card program - but I digress...). Awesome on my birthday to have no dinner and end up eating cold leftover pizza at nearly midnight. It remains to be seen what, if anything, they do to make up for this.

The French toast was sweet and delicious. The Eggs Sardou was one of the better benedicts I've had. The Brisket Hash was tasty, and their biscuit wasn't bad (it was better than Pine State's). However, the dish we basically went for, the chicken and waffle, was the only disappointing one. While the waffle was fine, the chicken was extremely tough and rubbery in texture. I can't even really explain it, but I had a hard time cutting it with a knife. We each took a bite and agreed it was not good, so most of the chicken went untouched. We could have brought it up with our server, but at that point, we didn't want to wait for them to make another plate; we had places to go and other things to eat.Not a bad place for breakfast/brunch by any means, but be prepared for a wait.

Finally got up and left meaning the 4 of us walked out without spending the $100 or so on drinks and food that we normally drop.The floor/decor - super super cheap faux flooring is falling apart due to moisture. Guessing there is a water leak underneath that is causing the floor to buckle, bow, and feel like a wet sponge. It's really bad as in some spots someone is going to trip and fall it has buckled so bad. The art is cool and creepy but really for as long as it took to open they could have actually done something more than paint. Hopefully money will be reinvested to upgrade the bartop, tables, and bring in some natural light. I've lived in the westside for near 8 years and while I appreciate someone finally taking an interest here, doing it like this doesn't help much. It perpetuates the \\"just the west side\\" mentality from other people and the city."},{"name":"Godfather's Pizza","address":"11140 SW Barnes Rd","city":"Portland","stars":"3","text":"My office mates and I come here at least once a week for lunch.

And I can tell you with 100% certainty this is the best BBQ in town.I've been going here since they opened a couple years ago, and it's one of the select local joints I make a point of making a monthly haj to. I've had everything here (except the brisket--beef BBQ is blasphemy in my book), and I can genuinely say it's ALL good. The appetizers, pulled pork, the chicken, the ribs, the burger, the sides... and they have an outstanding smoked chicken salad sandwich.Having tried it all, our standard order has become an order of smoked wings, a fried rib app, and either the pulled pork or chicken salad sandwich with collard greens or green beans and stew or mac and cheese.Pros: Everything. Innovative menu without going too far and sacrificing the pig-out aspect synonymous with a BBQ jernt. Example: the fried rib appetizer. It's amazing. The Frito pie. Also--a full bar. Don't know of any other local BBQ place other than DBA (which is also worth a trip) that can boast that. Cons: 1) PACKED. Almost always.  As a result, parking is usually impossible as the lot is large yet almost always full. If you're going to go and don't want to wait, I'd suggest an off-peak hour on a weekday. I live close by so I have the luxury of calling in my order to go.2) Food coma. Not necessarily a con, but be forewarned and clear your schedule for the next few hours because you will be doing LOTS of couching. One of the prized gems in the ATL food scene. I just pray if they expand (which they'd be mad not to), they maintain the same level of quality."},{"name":"Christopher's","address":"1920 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"Wow!!

Not the servers, not the kitchen, but the people who planned the menu. Sides and sauces repeated from main to main. Presentation profoundly unimaginative.  The problem is entirely conception, not execution. A better idea would be to have a set of mains and set of sides that could be chosen. At least that way they'd be honest about the interchangability of sides. Jonah crab cake w red pepper aioli was delightful. Slaw was ok; flavor of rose petal??  Tomato bisque excellent but not made at the restaurant (\\"intergalactic soup Jedi\\"?). Spinach salad totally unremarkable. Halibut almandine and mustard dill salmon shared sides of bad potatoes au gratin; again, lazy and just an off flavor. Halibut was successful; salmon cooked how (poached? No color and overdone) and w decent mustard sauce and two (two!) slices of grilled zucchini side.

Veggie entree + mac and cheese were both consistently tasty and convenient, but pricey. Delivery always claims to take 45 minutes when I order through foodler but more often than not takes an hour, 1:15, 1:30 sometimes, without phone calls or apologies. Previous orders have been also been screwed up/required redelivery, again without any apologies. Last Thursday was the last straw - main part of my order was forgotten, and when they redelivered it later I got partway through before tasting something \\"smokey\\" in the food... spit it out and realized I was chewing on a piece of pork. In my vegetarian rice and beans.  Manager I talked to on the phone explained that it is very easy for the meat to accidentally get mixed in with the vegetarian rice and beans and offered to send me a gift card... presumably so I can order more vegetarian food with meat in it? Sarcasm aside, I've never really had any concessions like this before when orders took ages or things were left out or screwed up, so maybe this means they've at least stepped up their management game a fraction.  \\nWhatever. I'm done, will NEVER eat here again.  And before meat eaters reply defending the place, I will fully admit that I'm an idiot for \\n1.  being a vegetarian spending hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of dollars at a soul food restaurant(?!!!), even if it is on a \\"vegetarian entree\\"\\n2. not complaining about this place a lot sooner Speaking of #1, if you're veg you'd have to be an idiot to risk eating at this place when there's tons of real veg options in Allston.   You are not their target clientele, you are an afterthought which is why they are charging you 9 DOLLARS for rice and beans. As a last point, the night this happened the manager I talked to said she would be talking to the person in charge the next day and asked if she could call me back then. No calls back, presumably since there's nothing they can do about it.  Nothing I can do about it either, except post this review and warn you guys."},{"name":"MOD Pizza","address":"12091 SE Sunnyside Rd","city":"Happy Valley","stars":"4","text":"I am a huge fan of MOD Pizza and I have visited many of their locations all around, but this location is one of my favorites.

Where i'm from, people laugh at you for getting up that early to eat bbq, unless you're serious about meat.Being there at 10:30am we were able to meet some fine local texans, one of which was an AM talk show host in Austin and another was a food critic who ran his own website. Both of which said Franklin's is the best in Texas. We had mentioned that we were planning on heading to Snow's on saturday and the AM talk show host had said that Franklin's was the best, but Snow's was very close. \\nThe kind Texan's were friendly enough to give us some pointers and introduce us to the main dude behind Franklin's. I ended up ordering some Ribs, pulled pork, beans and slaw. I don't really care what anyone says about the sides you get, bbq is a simple art for people with patience. Franklin's has exactly that. The ribs were crazy good. So much flavour, I had no idea what to expect. No sauce needed for that, I should have just ordered ribs because they were that good.

At 3:30 in the afternoon, my brother and I were one of the only groups of patrons.Although the exterior of the restaurant leaves something to be desired, I was pleasantly surprised by the inside.  It was classier than I expected, with gleaming dark wood tables, crisp white tablecloths, and soft lighting.  I felt out of place my Pedroia shirt and jeans, but everyone else there was casually dressed.Our waiter, Josh, was exceptionally nice.  He immediately brought us a basket of bread sticks and some focaccia.  Both were great! The focaccia was warm, buttery, and crispy around the edges.  As an entree, I had the Risotto du Jour, which happened to be risotto with butternut squash, green beans, and cranberries and a sprinkling of gorgonzola.  I had a choice of meat to go along with the dish, and I chose the salmon.  I wasn't sure that I'd like the risotto, but it ended up being really good.  I enjoyed the sweetness of the cranberries and squash alongside the buttery flavor of the risotto.  The green beans didn't add much to the dish, but they didn't detract from it, either.  The sharp contrast between the gorgonzola and cranberries was unexpectedly enjoyable as well.  However, the salmon was not well done.  It, too, came with a topping of gorgonzola, but it was still boring.  Other than the cheese and some pepper, the salmon didn't have any seasoning.  It didn't taste thoroughly cooked, either; the middle of it was slimy.  This was not impressive in the least.  I think Papa Razzi could do better if they served smoked salmon with the risotto instead.  After the yummy risotto, such a plain piece of fish is a letdown.  My brother really liked his dish, the chicken parmigiana.  The piece of chicken he got was thin, but it was huge! It took up at least 60% of the plate.  He had no complaints whatsoever, and even though he made a good dent in his meal, he had a lot left to take home.Overall, I have a so-so impression of Papa Razzi.  Some things are good, some not so good . . . I guess it would be a good choice if you're passing by and you're hungry, but I wouldn't put it on a list of must-try restaurants in the area."},{"name":"South City Kitchen Midtown","address":"1144 Crescent Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"As soon as I spotted pimento cheese on the menu at South City Kitchen I told my friend Jill (a native Californian) that we absolutely had to order it.

And I tried dozens...and each one was fabulous. But I couldn't make it to Franklins because with such a short time here, I couldn't invest the three hours needed to eat there. But today, a friend and I found ourselves driving past, and no line....so, well, why not?The sign on the door, stating: \\"Sold Out\\" nearly put us off...but, only for a moment, and we went in anyway, and we were so glad we did. First, let me say that the staff went above and beyond being hospitable. The staff, all of the staff, were warm, friendly and very accommodating. They took me, a California novice under their wings, recommended what I should get,  and showered me with the best tasting brisket I have ever eaten. The brisket was so tender, so moist, that it just fell apart. The delicious smokiness of the meat was sweet but not overpowering.  Now unlike their competitors, the sides here were delicious too. There was no more room in my stomach for anything else. I could barely roll out and to my car.I will come here first, every time I'm in Austin, and I will patiently wait as long as I have to.

Lord knows I like a well-seasoned plate o' food. I need me that salt, and for restaurants I expect stronger seasonings. But Tapestry really overdoes itself spectacularly on the salt. Everything is perfect: the pizza dough is chewy on the inside & crisp on the outside with perfect char, melding perfectly with the toppings. The pasta has an incredible al-dente texture, a level I've seen very rarely in Boston. Unfortunately, the pizza is very salty even after picking out salty elements such as prosciutto. The perfect pastas are overly sauced - actually, smothered - in sauces that are so salty that it has a bitter bite. Seasoning is such a basic element of food that I'm inclined to be strict about it even if there's a chance that it was an off night.Something to be said about the service, too. A lot of reviews remarked that service needed work and my experience was not that bad, but agree the svc wasn't top notch.

I have spent most of of my life eating authentic Chinese food in China and Asia.  I grew up eating real Chinese food -- spending summers and extended vacations in their part of the world.  Therefore, my standard definitely isn't the Americanized version (read: dumbed-down).  Having said that, I wouldn't go out of my way just to eat here and get food that is, at best, 2 notches above Panda Express.  Don't get me wrong, though, most people are okay with westernized Chinese food -- it's suited for their palates and it's what they are used to. Nothing wrong with that.When it first opened, I really liked their Dan Dan Noodles -- thick, chewy noodles doused with a hoisin-peanut sauce and topped with steamed watercress.  It was fantastic. Was, being an operative word here.  These days, Dan Dan Noodles have evolved to a super salty sticky mess.  Four times in a row (and all within 2 months), I've had to leave the noodles untouched, or worse, throw them in the trash when I got it to-go.The shredded beef and Chinese celery is pretty decent in the Panda Express-kind of way which is nothing out of the ordinary. The celery outnumbered the beef 12-to-1 so all you taste is celery. The beef, however, was tender. For lunch, you get a cup of hot and sour soup and their version is on the watery/bland side. The Salt and Pepper Pork Chops is a decent choice. You get strips of deep-fried pork laced with jalape√±o peppers. Last complaint, they really need to do something with their steamed rice. I know the price of rice has tripled in the last couple of months but it's still no reason to serve 3rd-class brownish rice.Bottom line, the decor is better than the food. If you want authentic Szechuan cuisine, don't waste your time here, head on over to Sichuan House instead."},{"name":"Screen Door","address":"2337 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"If you're looking for a good authentic southern meal this place is a must!

Would have been nice to just say \\"folks have a seat wherever you like\\" (or post a sign) instead of having us stand there but I digress. The food = 4/5. We ordered the \\"pizza rolls\\" which were outstanding. The basil sauce they come with is out of this world. My only gripe is the sized of the order: two small rolls cut it in half to resemble \\"4 rolls\\". For my entree I ordered the Turkey Burger which was delicious. It came with carmelized onion, Gruyere, shitake mushrooms, arugula and spicy Dijon mustard. My fries were cold and rubbery like they had clearly sat in the window for 10-15 mins. However after informing the waiter he quickly, and quite pleasantly, resolved the issue by bringing out a fresh plate of fries. Hubby ordered the Cajun pasta which was terrific. It was definitely Cajun-spiced, which means it was just the perfect blend of savory flavor and eye-watering heat. The linguine also came with blackened chicken and andouille sausage and bell pepper. My husband loves bread pudding so we order the bourbon bread pudding on the menu for dessert. We were informed they were out of the bourbon version, but offered us the \\"sticky toffee bread pudding\\" instead. We tried it. Now I'm in no way a connoisseur of bread pudding, but I am from the south so I know what it should look like. Instead we received what clearly resembled and tasted like regular cake and ice cream.

Is this the best brisket I've ever had? Yes. Is it so good as to justify a 2.5 hour wait in line? Probably not, but if you've never eaten there before the novelty/quality combo should push you over the edge.The sausage is juicy and tender while retaining a satisfying firmness, and the tipsy Texan's goliath sized portion of beef and sausage stretches the limits of fiscal responsibility. But the star of the show is hands down the brisket, and specifically the fat on the brisket which possesses a heavenly \\"melty\\" quality similar to a well-prepared bone marrow. The bark is a perfect blend of crunchy and gooey and the meat is moist and complexly flavored. I tried drizzling it with the barbecue sauce and it was like pouring ketchup on a filet mignon.If I were to factor in the wait time I would probably give Franklin Barbecue four stars, but this isn't exactly an aspect of the restaurant, so I won't penalize, but I was disappointed in the sides.  While I realize Franklin is world famous for its barbecue, the sides are still, to my mind, a crucial aspect of any BBQ joint worth its salt and here Franklin just didn't deliver. The pinto beans were bland, the potato salad was passable but lacked texture, and while a nice addition to the tipsy Texan, the slaw on its own was mediocre.*Bonus points* While waiting in line a server does occasionally come around with food (sausage on white bread) to pacify the increasingly ornery patrons."},{"name":"Fat Matt's Rib Shack","address":"1811 Piedmont Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"3 Stars???

We hope to do this every week or every other week- depending on the weather, of course.  The idea behind this is to help promote one of the great things about Austin; being able to find good food from not so ideal locations. I'll provide reviews from each of the establishments we visit and also try to recreate some of their signature dishes.This week we visited the Mighty Cone- located at 1600 S. Congress Ave. My friends in the group had been here before and wanted me to start the tour off with a bang.  At first glance, of the not so extensive menu, I knew it would be easy for us to make our choice. We ordered two variations of the Hot & Crunchy Cone (chicken with avocado and shrimp with avocado), a beef slider, chili-dusted fries, and an order of fried pickles. There were three and a half of us (three adults and one toddler) eating, so it's not as much food as it sounds. I started off with the Hot & Crunchy Cones; both were prepared the same way- shrimp or chicken covered with corn flakes and sesame seed breading topped with a spicy aioli sauce. The avocado was breaded in the same fashion and deep-fried, as well. These ingredients sat on top of your standard coleslaw wrapped in a flour tortilla and served in a paper cone. Sounds delicious right?That's what I thought until I took my first bite- I paused- and took a second bite. Maybe my palette wasn't fooling me, could it be true that this wonderfully textured meal wrapped in a tortilla could be so bland?\\nSo, I started to deconstruct my \\"cone\\" (it's really just a taco) to taste each element individually. I came to this conclusion: The super crunchy texture was great on both the chicken and shrimp but lacked any flavor whatsoever; this is a case where a little salt and pepper was really needed. However, both proteins were not over cooked so that was a good thing.The spicy aioli really disappointed me; this could have been the one thing that brought the dish together. Instead, the aioli was a bit watery and lacked any garlic or chili flavor. It was just a very pretty orange sauce that served no other purpose than to add color to the dish. The deep fried avocado was an over kill when it came to using the corn flake and sesame breading. It didn't add anything constructive or flavorful to this dish.  If anything, the large chunk of avocado was a bit hard to eat just because of the size.The use of the coleslaw was a bit confusing to me. It was pretty much your standard coleslaw that you can get anywhere in town. Its place at the bottom of the cone conflicted with the use of the aioli on top. They're both mayonnaise-based sauces; one with garlic and the other with sugar. There was one good thing about the coleslaw- it wasn't bland like all of the other components of this dish.All-in-all, the texture was nice but the flavor was non-existent.\\nNext, we moved on to the beef slider which consisted of all natural beef , red onions, and tomatoes squeezed between a dinner roll. Yes! I was so excited because there is now way you can mess up a simple beef slider, right?Wrong again.First, let me complain about the cost which is way over-priced for the amount being served. You get one slider- and it really is a slider- not a hamburger for just under six dollars. I've had Kobe burgers that tasted a hundred times better and were cheaper than this slider. I took a bite and the first thing I noticed was that the meat was a little dry, as if someone was really pressing on this patty to get it to cook faster. The second thing I noticed was that, once again, the food was bland. \\nAs I sigh in disappointment, my internal thoughts keep reverting back to, \\"How do you screw up a slider, an expensive one at that?\\"I moved on to the sides and the fried pickles were okay. They were breaded in the same corn flake and sesame breading and at this point I can't help but feel like the breading is getting to be a little bit of overkill. \\nThe chili-dusted fries were the highlight of the meal and not because they had tons of flavor, but because you could drench them in ketchup. \\nOur tour started off with a bust instead of a bang, but that's ok because there are still a lot of other places to eat in Austin and I'm going to try to find them. I'm sure I'll find a dish that I love and give the ultimate compliment of recreating rather than trying to find a way to improve on their dish, concept, or flavors.For other reviews or recipes check out http://bistro331.blogspot.com/"},{"name":"Eastland Sushi & Asian Cuisine","address":"16519 SE Mcgillivray Blvd","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Great fried sushi rolls --- The Vegas Roll is great and such a good value!

It's pretentious as can be, worse service I've ever had, expensive and everyone - from the hostess on down - thinks they're doing you a tremendous favor by just allowing you in their crappy BBQ joint.

When I told them to take this basket of burnt food away, you'd have thought I'd personally insulted their mother's honor.

I will say this: I kind of went in wanting to have a \\"meh\\" response. The great ramen war of Austin had left me largely bored. It's all fine and good, but for the most part, yeah, if I throw some fancy ingredients in my Maruchan? Guess what, I've just saved myself a lot of time and money and I get to do it at home. Someone I know wanted to go to Michi but I suggested this instead. We stood in line and I took in the waiting experience. It occurred to me that I hadn't waited in line for a restaurant for quite a while. Was it worth it? Could it POSSIBLY be that much better than Michi and the others? Dear reader, it was.The broth. Heysoos Christos, the broth. FINALLY I get it. This is what ramen is supposed to be. THIS is why it's become a thing. I've never been taken with a broth before like I was with this one. I ordered the tonkotsu original with additional chashu, brussels sprouts, garlic, egg, and a spicy bomb. My noodles had the perfect texture, but that's obviously something that can vary from batch to batch so whether or not they always get it spot on is beyond me. They held the broth perfectly but still had a nice flavor of their own. The chashu was delicious. I would have been fine had they just slapped that down in front of me. The brussels sprouts were a fine addition. I was initially slightly nervous that the charring on the brussels sprouts may have a negative effect on the broth, but they really enhanced it in this amazing way that my taste buds long for. The spicy bomb didn't really add enough of a kick for me, to be honest, but it altered the flavor enough for me to appreciate it. Before any of the ramen started, I tried the Munchie Katsu Slider. It's this fried little beef patty with a crispy panko exterior. There was a bit of ginger in it, which added an interesting flavor. The texture of the patty was interesting. Overall, it was good but I'm not sure I'd call the slider a must, especially at the $4 asking price. The potato salad that comes with is quite delicious, though, and I'd happily order just a side of that.The restaurant is a little small, thus the consistent line, but even if it were twice the size, I'm sure there'd still be a line waiting for this ramen. It's that great."},{"name":"Se7en Bites","address":"617 N Primrose Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"The food was so good, we will definitely be back! Very clean place and friendly service.

Before I even looked at the menu I saw a separate menu that had a \\"bubbly tasting\\" for $15. My friend and I both ordered that. Then since it was happy hour, we also ordered two appetizer plates, the cucumber, feta and some sort of bean dip and a sort of pork rillette platter with a bit of mustard, pickled peppers, onions and pickles on the side, with mini crostinis. Cute and well presented and plenty of food to snack on. Each plate was $5 on the happy hour menu, but the other food on the menu looked really nice and I'll definitely be back to try something different. They were pouring very different wines and things I've never heard of which was exciting for the wine snobs out there that want to try new things when they go out! They were also pouring SoloUva from Franciacorta, Italy- awesome! Our server was very nice answering our (my) random questions from time to time and was able to explain everything and was very nice about it. Someone that knows what they are pouring is huge points! (It doesn't always happen these days) \\nThere was a French wine that I'd never heard of and I asked our servers opinion on it. I went for a glass of that- first thought was it was flat and seemed watered down in a way. VERY different then any white wine I had. I still kept thinking it was flat haha, but a few more sips in and it had me. I wish I remembered the name. You can tell they have some great people doing the selections and research for their menu. I was very impressed. They have local wines and lots of foreign wines, a great mix of both!\\nThe space itself is quite small and intimate, not a place for groups in my opinion. Four people or so to some tables, seats at the bar and a couple of tables outside. The design is very beautiful and the wine along the main wall was well displayed and unique, it's really an eye catcher. I'll recommend friends here and definitely be back in the near future myself. \\nI'd say the only \\"con\\" was the last wine on our wine tasting.

All the staff were super friendly, not snobby at all.I got one of every meat (except the ribs, they were out), and 2 lbs of meat comes out to 30 bucks.  What a steal!  The brisket comes in two forms, fat and lean.  I got the mixed but would reccomend the fatty type.  All of the meats were spot on.  I wouldn't say it's the best turkey or pork I've ever had but the brisket was, and the pork and turkey came pretty darn close.  Sausage was up there too.  Oh and I had a bite of banana pudding so if you're feeling diet-free, go for it!  I'll end by talking about the sauces.  One was a standard sauce which was awesome and then there was a tangy vinegar sauce which I liked too, and went especially well with the pork.  There's also an espresso sauce which i thought was a tad weird.I ended up going home with 1.5 pounds of meat, and finishing it that day.  It's delicious even cold.

They even have Dr. Pepper on the menu for soda!  If I were to give any criticism, it would be that the onion rings might not be for everyone:  they are the super thin slice kind and I think they use red onions - the fries were very well seasoned.Don't expect gourmet here kids - we are talking an easy to hold, easy to eat burger at a 'don't break the bank' price.

Hadn't even heard of Screen Door until searching for a place for Sunday brunch and saw the huge number of reviews. When my girlfriend and I got there, the line was, um, substantial. Table for 2 = 90 minute wait.  Typically, I would probably start looking for backup plans, but I had a good feeling about this place.  We killed time down the block at Heart coffee roasters and came back after about 45 minutes, thinking that maybe they overestimated.  No such luck as we waited in the drizzly rain.  Thankfully through the natural course of attrition, our name was finally called and we got a seat at the counter.First order of the day: Bloody Mary's, and these didn't disappoint...except that they weren't as spicy to our liking.  So added some of their house made hot sauce, and that helped considerably.  After studied perusal of the menu, and observing the plates leaving the kitchen, my GF determined the fried chicken and waffle was the obvious choice.  I opted for the shrimp with bacon and cheddar grits with over-medium eggs.  While waiting (not so patiently), the sheer number of chicken and waffle plates emerging from the kitchen was mind boggling.  Clearly this was the star of the show here.  And once our order arrived, it was easy to see why.  Perfectly fried chicken, juicy and flavorful, especially for all white meat.   The light and fluggy Belgain-style waffle was spiced with clove, nutmeg and all-spice and provided a nice counterpoint to the chicken.  Alternating between sweet maple syrup and the house hot sauce made for deliciousness, bite after bite.My shrimp and grits dish was no slouch.  Creamy cheddar grits and perfect cooked shrimp with bacon is a classic combination, and one very well executed here.  The nicely cooked eggs lent a nice runny yolk which added to the richness of the grits.  Served with a great biscuit alongside, this was a deeply satisfying plate of food.Thoroughly stuffed, we rolled out of the Screen Door immensely happy and looking forward to the next time we were in Portland for another visit."},{"name":"Border Caf√©","address":"32 Church St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"I've been going here for a couple of decades now for consistently great Tex-Mex food, great service and great margaritas.

While it was later in the afternoon, they were still advertising Dim Sum as an option.  Technically, they were correct.  We sat down, and they had 4 possible food options that we could have chosen from.  The rice dish was edible.  The other 3 options (some slimy beef, and 2 seafood options) were not something I was willing to try.  The other two I was eating with tried them, and they were ok.  Not great, but ok.  They seemed to be encouraging the other few diners in the place to order off the menu, as they seemed to have no intention of refreshing the dim sum options.I can't rank them very high when I had to leave here and go somewhere else to have lunch.  If you only want to offer Dim Sum during the peak hours, that's perfectly understandable.  But to offer it and charge for it when you're not going to put effort into it - not understandable.

In a panic to try and catch Social Distortion, who were still an hour out, I took my son outside to figure out the plan: was he tired? Did i have to drive back up north to drop him off? As my son was crying to stay, I was trying to find out how I could make him happy with all of the people, nowhere to sit, and constantly wanting to mess with my iPhone. It's a balance, you want your kid to engage, and experience this thing he'll be stoked about years down the road. As we were dealing with the situation, one of the security guards came over and asked if everything was cool. I explained my little dude was tired, but wanted to stay, and I was debating driving up toward my house 14 miles away. With a quick pause, he asked if we wanted to hang out in the VIP area. I gladly took him up on the offer after grabbing my best friend from the crowd. Instead of dealing with the crowd, the little dude had a seat, constant access to water, popcorn, and some food. (He had Texas Chili Parlor earlier, i feed my kids.) But, that act of kindness changed my night, and made his first show possible. Who knows how it would have shook out if we had to stay in the general area? Luckily, Dad and Uncle Preston got to enjoy the show, and the little dude had fun, too.

We had resos for 7, arrived early hung out for a bit in the nook by the door and were seated on time. The service is TOP NOTCH at this place. The decor and ambiance was so good - super clean, well maintained, and felt very cozy. This is what I had to eat:1. Smoked confit chicken, endive, celery and apple ribbons, slow cooked grapes, bacon vinaigrette - it was SO good, a little too heavy on the dressing but it was so good that it didn't matter. The portion of chicken was very generous which surprised me because usually chicken on salads is like thumb sized haha. The chicken was very tender and so tasty (reminded me of summer bbqs)2. Olive oil poached sable fish, smoked fish glace, confit leek, romanesco, potato croquette, creme fraiche, bacon crumb - I normally don't opt for seafood if there is a chicken option but I thought I'd give this a try and I was NOT sorry. The fish was soft and broke apart so easily, it didn't have a strong fishy taste or smell. The potato things were yummy too. 3. Pistachio dessert cake - this was baked right into a little round jar and was probably the best cake I've had in a long time. It was very tasty and I felt like I was eating someone's homemade perfection. There was a layer of chocolate ganache I think that totally complemented the cake and the whipped topping. I'm not really a Pistachio lover (my boyfriend is, I think it's an Indian thing!) but this cake was delicious I scraped that jar clean!!!I also did the wine flight for $12 and chose to do all reds - I had a pinot noir with my salad, a merlot I believe with my main, and a Cabernet Franc with my dessert. ALL SO GOOD!!! and great portions I believe it was 2 oz each glass.This is the first Western restaurant that I've been to in a long time where I didn't feel super thirsty after my meal or like I had just cheated on a diet. Everything was so authentic and was flavourful - not like someone just dumped a handful of salt into the food and called it a day. Service was AWESOME, our server was efficient about clearing our plates when we were finished even though we all ate at a different pace and she had to come back and forth multiple times. She did a great job of introducing the menu items and the wines when she brought them to the table which I find a lot of restaurants don't really do. I mean yes, I know what I ordered but it's always good to have a little refresher before you're about to chow down.This place looks like a hole in the wall from the outside but it is DEFINITELY worth checking out.** tip: for groups of 8 or more they do charge an autogratuity and this time I felt like they TOTALLY earned it!

We all orderered slices of pizza, which means the pizza just had to be warmed though - not cooked.  Still, it took 20-30 minutes to come out.  After we were done eating we had to sit there for an additional 20 minutes waiting for our server to bring us the check.  Where was he?  He was hanging out with the other mellow mushroom workers who weren't doing their jobs.  It took about an hour to get a few slices of pizza. What about the atmosphere?  Mellow mushroom is a chain, and it's clear that it is trying to create a fun, laid back atmosphere.  Unfortunately, it fails, and it ends up feeling like you're in some weird Disney world exhibit that blends a japanese cartoon with the 1970s hippie scene.I say screw this place.

It works both ways.  I'm gonna like it generally speaking, but i'm also gonna be critical about details.  On a recommendation, I ventured into a posh Dunwoody shopping plaza, a far cry from my usual Buford Hwy haunts.  When a place has the audacity to call themselves a \\"gourmet\\" sandwich shop, you better deliver.  Dropped by at 1230, had some trouble finding parking so i was worried about a line at the counter.  No such trouble, the counter is clear and i wondered to myself, \\"is that good or bad?\\"  However, the tables are packed.  Very good sign.  Two blackboards with all my options laid out with size and price behind the counter.  I literally have \\"soup nazi\\" panic with all my choices and you never know about these mom and pop places and how they do things.  Apparently my timing is perfect as a line begins to take form just minutes after my order goes in.  Ah, the food.  Being my first time, i ordered a second sandwich as well just to get more data.  The first one was a Napa sandwich, turkey, spinach, blue cheese and granny smith apples.  Pretty tasty and non-traditional.  I wouldn't get it again, but i didn't regret it either.   As i was waiting for my order to be packed togo, an earlier customer came forward to get his dine in meal.  It was a HUGE onion roll stacked with good stuff.  Quietly, i uttered a Bart Simpson regretful \\"awwwww\\", i wish i ordered THAT one, whatever it was.   To my surprise and delight, my second sandwich was indeed a replica of the one I coveted.  The fried chicken club was the sandwich, and it was awesome.  I am so weak....The red velvet cupcake somehow ended up on my ticket so i paid for it and brought it home.  I'll just keep this simple.  It was really good.  Bravo.  A sandwich that will rival my homemade version.  Pricey but not as much as Taco Mac or sushi for lunch.

It's ok to season with this, but it's overly too consistent.  I also usually judge a dim sum place on how well they make their flavored chicken feet.

Some mayo based artery clogging yummy goo of course. Mmmmmm. The wife had a smallish bite of shrimp, but she is the smart one who avoids fried foods. Personally, I could have killed a couple of these cones and some fries if I'd been given the chance. And I'd probably never try the chicken since there is shrimp on the menu. The avocado slice was a nice touch. Tasted very fresh even though it was \\"Deep Sauted!\\"Fun concept, but messy. I didn't see any forks. I tried sort of eating with the cone, but eventually just wrapped it up in the tortilla and ate it. Service was friendly and efficient! I'll be back for the sliders.

I was lucky enough to be brought along by a Cantonese speaking friend & his crew, and they walked me through the process, were able to flag down the carts with ease, communicate exactly which dishes they wanted. It's really a wonderful way to spend a Fri/Sat/Sunday morning. This is the best breakfast experience I've ever had. Real family vibe, everyone there in big groups, kids running around, it just feels like a party. Tons of fun!When I came back later on a rainy cloudy day, like randomly at 3 PM, with my gf, they sat us in the corner by the door, my whiteskin must have made me an untouchable. The only cart that came within 50 feet of us was the desert cart. Have to point to stuff to get anything from standoffish lady running it. General vibe was \\"why is gwailo here wtf?\\" Probably the only time I've had to walk out of a restaurant/been offended by service?

I'm not a big fan of the set up for seating though - we were given a buzzer, it rang, and then we were given a piece of paper with a sticker on it and sent downstairs?  From there we had to wait for our table to get cleared before we were seated and moved out of the staircase.Our server was noticeably rushed, and table-time was minimal.  No big complaints in terms of service, it just felt as rushed as he looked.  He did manage to slap down some chips & salsa right away for us though, so kudos to him.Drink:  1 star.  I am admittedly a bit of a snob when it comes to tequila/margaritas, so I was highly disappointed at the minimal and cheap selection of tequilas and in the overall poor quality of margaritas.  I asked for mine \\"on the rocks\\" (which she said was an option!) and she proceeded to dump frozen mix out of the blender into a glass with ice... um.  Quality aside, it didn't taste terrible, and I learned my lesson - don't believe what people tell you about the margaritas at Border Cafe.Food: Chips & Salsa on the table - automatic star.  I'm a huge fan of places that recognize you may have been waiting and get you something fast.  I've had better chips, but you get what you pay for.  I was starving, so I ate with no complaints.  We started with the guacamole, which was mediocre, and I had a vegetable quesadilla.  The food portions are enormous, so definitely go hungry.

First, you stand at a counter and order your food, and then take a number and sit at one of four communal picnic benches - there are no individual tables for seating. They serve your food on a metal plate like you see in movies as the starving prisoners scrape their bowls.\\n \\nSe7en Bites serves home brewed cold herbal tea, and orange blossom was the tea of the day.\\nI ordered biscuits and sausage gravy with thyme. The homemade biscuits are flaky and light, and the gravy has so many complex flavors at work you want to lick the plate.

Just seeing the ANY pizza $10 commercial I felt compelled to take the drive for carry out since I am out of the service area for delivery. I just moved to the state so I was on new territory. Let me just say that everything about this phone order was painfully annoying from the start. First, the lady on the other end kept talking to someone else, then repeating toppings I never even mentioned, \\"I'll take green peppers and red onion,\\" \\"okay you want ham hocks and a space ship?\\" Okay it wasn't that bad, but after the fourth round I was going crazy. Finally I just sputtered out the five toppings I wanted three times in a row. After another conversation with whoever she was talking to, she says, \\"we only do four toppings\\". WHAT?!?! Pretty sure I must have heard wrong, but sure enough she curtly repeats, \\"we only do four toppings.\\" I am usually not the person to get angry about a coupon or deal but I mean this commercial just ran five minutes ago. So I said, \\"Even though your commercial clearly states ANY pizza?\\" Her response, \\"yea, even though the commercial says that, we won't do it.\\" Even if she would have told me I had to pay for the one extra topping (extra sauce!) which would have been wrong, at least I would have had the option, or hell even pretend to ring it in but don't! Instead she refused my order and made me feel like some haggler at a swap meet. Even though if she would have waited she would have known I was ordering multiple items would have made up for that one scoop of sauce. At that moment I did my very best to hold my composure and just said \\"forget it\\" and hung up.... Needing to prove myself right I called another PIzza Hut and asked if there was a problem ordering a pizza with the toppings I wanted, confused they said no, and pointed out that there Super Supreme which you can order comes with 8 toppings as is. Thank you!"},{"name":"Red Lobster","address":"4010 West Vine St","city":"Kissimmee","stars":"3","text":"Everything was good as expected.

Juicy but well done, as in cooked through, the patties could use a hit of salt and pepper, but they aren't bad. I've had the Bacon Blue burger several times and the toasted bun was perfect. It carried the beef, bacon, cheese, and generous slathering of BBQ sauce into my face with grace.The bun is the stand out- it's crusty on the outside, toasted in the middle and soft inside. It's quite nice. I could also be biased since I rarely ever eat bread anymore but I quite enjoy this bread. Could be that it's slathered with enough butter to be golden brown... The bacon is smokey yet sweet, and while I would have enjoyed a more generous helping of blue cheese it was a balanced serving.I've never had the beer or soda on tap, but I've been told it's cold and frothy. Fries are better at their competition down the street, but they aren't bad at all.All that said, this is one of the cheapest burger joints in Brattle/Harvard Sq. Because it's surely some of the cheapest eats in the HVDSQ area it's almost always slammed- except when HRVD kiddos are home on vacation. I highly recommend visiting during school breaks. So much more enjoyable.

It was fantastic. We were seated right away by the pleasant host. We had two orders of fried chicken and an order of fries. Basically everything they had. The fries were thin and crispy, with some clean herb seasoning. The fried chicken was great- excellent batter and crunch! No bones either, which is always a plus. We picked four sauces to try with the chicken: chimichurri, relish, buttermilk ranch, chipotle aioli and requested sriracha too. The standout to me was the relish but the buttermilk ranch was delicious. I want to find a recipe for the chimichurri too! We washed it down with 2 'gansetts. It was so hipster and so delicious.

So the cousins and I went for dinner and were so sad they didn't have that dish!! But the servers were kind to let us know it's only a brunch entree when we requested for it - apparently a lot of people who come to dine with them are also misled through Yelp lolUs 5 were planning to eat as much on our list as possible so we all shared fried oysters, the fried chicken entree, a side of sweet potato fries, and the orange quince apple crumble for dessert.When we all told our server we'd be sharing an entree, she was kind about it and didn't make any remarks, gestures or facial expressions. She brought out enough dinnerware for everyone and checked back with us throughout the night to make sure everything was okay. Another server also kept refilling our waters and making sure we were doing okay - the two servers we had were very sweet and down to earth.Fried oysters: half a dozen fried in what I believe is corn meal batter. Not your typical thick batter so it has the crunch and the warm oyster inside is so delectable. These were large oysters - I didn't taste JUST batter. So good!Fried chicken entree - this piece of chicken is huge! It came with mashed potatoes and gravy, and choice of coleslaw or collard greens. The mashed potatoes was sooooo smooth and creamy and didn't taste starchy whatsoever. The gravy was salty but the chicken wasn't so eating everything together worked for me.Sweet potato fries - crispy on the outside, soft and fluffy on the inside. Good sharing size!Orange quince Apple crumble dessert - has a scoop of ice cream and fresh apple slices on top. This was a great way to end my dinner! I was so satisfied with the melted ice cream, crunchy oat crumble, and warm apple and orange quince.I wish my stay was longer so I could come back for brunch.. guess I'll have to visit another time :)"},{"name":"Sforno Trattoria Romana","address":"1308 Pearl St","city":"Boulder","stars":"4","text":"While we were able to get a reservation via Open Table on a Saturday night, and the patio temperature/people watching was grand, the overall experience was lacking. Our thoughts:\\n-Taylor, our server, was very good, helpful and prompt. \\n-The house wine seemed to be a bit of a stingy pour for $9/glass.\\n-My spaghetti carbonara lacked carbonara (I found a total of 8 tiny pieces, each maybe the size of a pea), and there was nothing special about the flavor at all. \\n-My boyfriend's Chicken Marsala was also lacking in flavor, though he was able to kick it up a bit with salt (but who wants to have to add salt, right?) and the mushrooms were also missing. Barely a hint of Marsala as well. The brocollini was tough.\\n-When we were offered parmesan cheese, we were expecting freshly grated, but instead, a jar of the stuff they serve with pizza arrived. Neither flavorful or interesting. \\n-The BREAD was the high point, yummy and arrived hot! The pesto comes in a small vessel that allows the pesto to sink to the bottom and one can't get to it without getting a slice of bread soaked in oil before you can reach the pesto...too bad, because that which I was able to retrieve with a utensil was very good. \\n-All in all, we were glad to have had a coupon to ease the pain of the price tag, this spot is great, but the food is overpriced and not very interesting."},{"name":"The French Table Bistro","address":"3916 Main Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"We were a little hesitant about dining here as we peered into the crowd of older well dressed customers.

It's very cozy, spacious (but not cold), and well decorated with a bunch of interesting pictures to look at. The tables are not too close to each other, so you can have a conversation without screaming (at least for Brunch, I don't know at night). I liked that the waitresses were discrete, friendly, and that they get the job done. The Brunch menu was varied, which was refreshing. My friends and I split the Frittata and the Quiche. The portions were generous and the prices fair. The plates were well presented. I liked that the Frittata wasn't compact and the Quiche was high (and not flat like a pie like they usually are). \\nThe Frittata and the Quiche were both good. The latte was perfect.

I walk in with my party and we are greeted with the information that despite making a reservation, our table had been given away to ameliorate another person's waiting troubles. Our options were to wait for another table or sit at a communal table. What is the point in making a reservation if you have to end up waiting for a table? The second weird scenario was when we were told the candles were not allowed to be lit. On every table there are elaborate candles, yet for some reason they have included them despite it being against the law. It takes up a large portion of the table and adds nothing to the eating experience. The third problem, which is mind boggling, was that they had run out of fried chicken thighs. In what world can a restaurant hoping to do well, not serve the dish that is in their restaurant name? The reason we came to this establishment was to have the chicken thighs. There are four chicken options on the menu: wings, thighs, 1/2 chicken and sliders. By dinner time, they had run out of chicken thighs and sliders. Let me remind you this is a restaurant specialising in chicken. Moreover, we were told while making our order. We took our time to think about what we were having, asked for more time, and only while we were relaying our order did the waiter think it was a good time to tell us half of the chicken options were not available. If I were management I would quickly change their gameplan for this eatery; if they continue to perform like they did when I went, they are doomed. The only reason this did not get one star, was the enjoyable macaroni and croquettes, and the smashing soundtrack (another sidenote was that the 'croquette' was far closer to an arancini then a croquette, another mistake in my opinion). While I appreciate the restaurant is in its early days, the prices are too high to justify the magnitude of mistakes.

When we arrived our waitress was the sweetest ever and the most helpful. She recommended me and my brother to share one of the combo  entrees since she assumed I don't eat to much in one sitting (jokingly), she was right though. We ended up getting:The 2 meat combo: Ribs and the Pulled Pork with sides: Fox-A-Roni and Potato Salad.\\nThe Ribs were amazing, and flavorful yes, however what caught my tastebuds more was the Fox-A-Roni. That was really good, macaroni and cheese with brunswick stew are the best combos. The potato salad was okay, I rather would have a second helping of the Fox-A-Roni. The pulled pork was good as well, slather on some of the sauce they have provided at the table. We also got to try some corn bread, they were good also, but I would not get those again since I'm not too much of a bread person. I am definitely taking friends here next time any of us are craving ribs. The parking is not as small if you go during non-rush hours, I got a perfect space with plenty of others open.

Lots of my friends say it is their favorite, so I was eager to give it a go. My husband and I headed out one Saturday  night and my parents tagged along with us.The wait wasn't too bad considering it was a Saturday night. First glance at the menu showed that they had a good mix of traditional BBQ fare as well as some unique takes on the classics (my dad ordered the foxaroni as a side, which was a mix of mac and cheese and brunswick stew. Never had seen that before).I wasn't that hungry and opted for the BBQ salad with dark meat chicken. I LOVED the chicken. It was tender, juicy and full of flavor. I'm not a big pulled pork person and usually order chicken or turkey while at BBQ restaurants, and this was some of the best I'd had. My husband got the brisket plate with a side of mac and cheese and their famous Frito pie.I never thought a dish served out of a chip bag could be so tasty. The Frito pie was amazing. Crunchy, salty, spicy, meaty. My dad loved it so much he said he would add it to death bed meal list (we all have those, right?). The mac and cheese was also delicious, second in my mind to my favorite mac and cheese from Swallow at the Hollow.The only disappointment of the meal was their potato salad. My mom ordered it and it was just...odd. The flavor was good, but it had the consistency of mashed potatoes rather than potato salad, if that makes any sense. We all agreed we would skip it the next time.And there will be a next time. I have been loyal to Swallow at the Hollow for years, saying it is the best BBQ in Atlanta in my opinion. Fox Bros is a close, close second.

I definitely appreciate the \\"cooler\\" vibe for the more traditional square that is now somewhat overrun with burger places. Kind of reminded me of an Atlanta or DC \\"scene\\" restaurant with a laid-back, hipster type vibe albeit still slightly high strung. Tucked away into a corner of the restaurant, it was sweltering hot there - didn't expect as such for a basement unit on a hot day, and my friend was sticking to his seat. The menu is diverse like new american tapas, but for picky eaters there were a few watch-outs (jalapenos, rabbit, pork belly, smelts, mackerel, etc.) The corn pancakes were as light and fluffy as expected -- and sweet, so basically dessert in a meal - I spent part of it mopping up the popcorn in the cream sauce. We loved the beet salad over a tea-smoked egg puree - this was definitely a highlight of the meal, and delicious served with house sourdough (ask for it). Charred broccoli was nice over a butternut squash hummus, and I ate it again for leftovers the next morning with an omelette. Lastly we tried the smelts, but they got cold quickly and were basically french fries by way of fish. They were smaller than we've normally had them, and I'd say that either the dish is unpopular or they're not entirely sure how to cook them - either way, I'd recommend they shelve the dish.

From the people who work here to the food that comes out of the kitchen, it is all very comforting.  I heard good things about the cannoli here.  You will have to read through this review to see what I thought of it.Soups, salads, sandwiches, stromboli's, calzones and pasta make up the menu.  Prices range around the $8 mark with some of the pasta dishes topping out at the $12 mark.  A pretty big menu leaves you baffled at what to have.  Everything looked so good.Since I rarely see Stromboli on a menu in Portland I decided to have one.  The Romano came calling ($8).  Chicken, roasted garlic puree, caramelized onion, provolone and pecorino fill this baked pizza roll with tomato sauce.  Served with \\"Potato Hay\\" or very thinly cut fries (think potato strings) this made for pure comfort food.  Stromboli can be on the heavy side, but this one wasn't.  I was hoping for a bit more tomato sauce inside, but this is a minor fault in an otherwise very nice dish.  I had a bite of the sandwich my friend had.  The Heel is a meat ball sandwich.  The meat balls are house made.  Very tasty.Now to the cannoli ($4).  House made pastry stuffed with chocolate chip mascarpone and ricotta cheese, candied orange and toasted pistachio.  I have to be completely honest.  The filling was more ricotta cheese and less mascarpone.  Not what I'm used to.  Not saying it wasn't good.  It was different.  I love ricotta cheese, but the cannoli I grew up with tended to lean more towards the mascarpone.  All in all a nice take on cannoli, but as U2 once said, I still haven't found what I'm looking for.Super friendly service with a smile.  Good prices.  Nice setting.

Definitely a great late night snack post cocktails!Staff was super friendly and I'm sure its not always easy as people who have to wait can become quite ignorant. Prices were good and I love that you can walk up, order, and walk away with hot tasty food!Tasty Burger - until next time!"},{"name":"Masa","address":"439 Tremont St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Can't go wrong with masa.

My travel companion and I got lost (dang iPhone's navi), and when we realized we were no where near our destination, we settled on going to Jake's for lunch. (We intended on going there for dinner later that night, but lunch was probably a better fit.) I enjoyed the charming ambiance at Jake's. The decor and vibe is very early 1900s, very welcoming and carried out well throughout the restaurant. The wait staff was friendly and excentric, and even their vibe fit the restaurant (talk about being part of a \\"brand\\"). Upon learning what Jake's √âtouff√©e was, my companion and I both order it. Saut√©ed crawfish tails and chicken in a nut brown Cajun sauce was exactly what the day called for since it was a bit cold and the dish warmed us up good. The only complaint I had was the Cajun sauce was super rich, and there was not enough rice in the dish. Though, I have to say, I appreciated it that the rice was not incorporated in the soup, but rather as a scoop a top the Cajun sauce. The sour dough bread served prior to the meal (not your San Francisco varietal) was good for dipping in the sauce, as well. I can see why Jake's is famous out in Portland. Fresh seafood and overall ingredients. I wasn't so thrilled though that I would be so inclined to dine there again. Perhaps though, it's just me not being a seafood person."},{"name":"Black Fire Brazilian Steakhouse","address":"8594 Palm Pkwy","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"Great service.

Ohhh..We are SO going here!We made last minute reservations, almost got killed by an Uber Driver who drove so crazy and got lost, but we finally arrived in one piece.We were greeted immediately and seated at our perfect table by the window.  I am claustrophobic so I love love sitting by windows!  Our server immediately greeted us and recommended some non alcoholic drinks.  The freshly squeezed lemonade was amazing and they bring like a little carafe of it to your table which I love!  I love carafes of anything!For an appetizer, we ordered Fried Green Tomatoes on Ci's suggestion and like Jonathon T says, this is a dish you want to just eat the entire thing by yourself and stuff your face!  I was leary because of the goat cheese but the two sauces, plus the crispiness of the tomatoes, made this a heavenly dish.  My first try at Fried Green Tomatoes and it was a good one.  I fear none others will compare.Ci ordered the famous fried chicken which came with greens and mashed potatoes.  I thought the chicken was ok but not as good as my dish!!I had shrimp and grits again on the recommendation of the server, even though I had eaten the same dish a few nights earlier in Savannah.,  She took the time to explain the different styles of Shrimp and Grits and that their style was a little more smoky than the one I had in Savannah.  It was amazing!  I am not a ham fan but the pieces of ham as you can see in my photo really made the dish.The bread they give you was great, cornbread type of bread with a honey butter.For dessert, we shared Pecan Pie again.  Seems like the alternative down South if you don't do the Peach thing.   It was an individual small pie not a piece of pie and it was divine.Service was impeccable and It was a perfect way to end our Summer trip."},{"name":"Taco Del Mar","address":"2020 Oxford Connector, Unit 113","city":"Port Coquitlam","stars":"2.5","text":"went in just before close one evening and ordered a burrito, was really good, I'll be back!"},{"name":"Tony's Italian Ristoriante","address":"16 W Beck St","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"Great atmosphere; some people were wearing suit jackets, but majority were dressed pretty casual.

The first trip I had the beef brisket with baked beans and cornbread.  Both were top notch.  The brisket is the best I have had outside of Texas, and the baked beans were spicy and sweet, without overdoing it on either taste.  The cornbread was a really interesting side item, having both jalapenos and cheese in it.  I think it'd be better if they sweetened the cornbread up just a little bit.The second time I went I had the ribs and fried okra.  The ribs were pretty darn tasty, but the okra wasn't my favorite.  They were longer pieces of okra, which is good sometimes, but these were largely devoid of breading, making the okra more sauteed than fried.  The baked beans were WAAAAY better than the okra, so next time I go I'll be getting that.The atmosphere of the place was cool too.  My waitress (same person both times) was super nice, and they played good music at a reasonable volume (lots of Widespread Panic, Drive-By Truckers, and Phish).  The beer selection seemed pretty good, and the patio looked like an awesome place to kick back with a group of friends for a leisurely, multiple-pitcher lunch.

We had a last minute reservation so had to wait a bit and they do not have a good place to wait. There were several parties crammed into a small space where we were in the way for the wait staff.  Overall the layout of the place is pretty cramped and awkward.  It smelled a little \\"fishy\\".

Went into lunch here thinking it was going to be $$ like Yelp has it averaged out to, but our non-sake, basic lunch for two consisting of a few rolls and a few sushi nigiri orders shot past $100 quite easily.None of the King Crab rolls are worth it ($23+). It's a margin-boosting trick. Pure profit for Super Fusion. You are better off staying in the $10-$12 roll range.And this place *loves* squeezing yum-yum sauce and mayo-based mystery sauces on your rolls. Pretty gross if you ask me. If you don't like yum-yum or mayo-mysteries on your maki, stick with the sushi.The sushi nigiri portions are on the large side, as other Yelpers have mentioned. Nothing spectacular in terms of fish quality, though. The Yellowtail Belly sushi was better than the Scallop sushi and better than the Salmon Belly sushi, IMO, in that order.In retrospect, if I *had* to eat here I would just load up on the sushi and skip all the rolls altogether.

How do you mess that one up? Shame.  We also got the spring rolls and they were pretty tasty but pricey considering it only came with three little rolls.

Bar-B-Q is one of the most popular BBQ restaurants in Atlanta and the restaurant was featured on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives (http://www.foodnetwork.com/videos/fox-bros-brisket-burger-0246737). My friend and I got here 15 minutes before the actual opening time (11 AM) and the restaurant already let customers at 10:50 AM. When I peeked out the window after our orders arrived, the parking lot was completely jam-packed ... and it was a weekday lunch too. If you want to avoid the long wait, then try to come before the restaurant even opens.There are tons of options on the menu - appetizers (including their famous Smoked Wings), two salads (BBQ Salad or House Salad), sandwiches, plates, and desserts. If you want to try a little bit of everything, then you can just order the Classic Combo Plate (choose two meats, white bread, and two sides).***Classic Combo Plate (two meats: Pulled Pork and 4 Wings & two sides: Brunswick stew and Brisket Chili, $17): Their Smoked Wings tasted slightly dry and flavors were a-okay, but wings were really meaty. Pulled pork had a good meat quality, but I had to add BBQ sauces to enhance the overall flavors. Normally I am not a fan on most of stew dishes with beans, but Brunswick stew was REALLY savory (slightly sweet and tasted meaty) and it was unlike any other side dishes that I have tried in other BBQ restaurants. I couldn't finish brisket chili, but it had to be one of the best chili that I have had.* My friend ordered ribs and I sampled a small piece of it ... the moment after I took a bite, that was when I had buyer's remorse and regretted for not ordering ribs. Rib was slightly dry, but it was very tender and absolutely a perfect rib.***Ribs, Brunswick stew, and Brisket Chili - I have found my perfect BBQ meal.

I don't remember everything we had, but the charcuterie plate was quite good, as were the anticuchos (grilled beef heart), and the roasted half-chicken was the best chicken I'd had in quite a while (the waiter informed us that it's the one relatively economical plate, in terms of portion size, for a large group of people). Everything was delicious, honestly. There were also very good (though, again, not cheap) beer and wine selections, and I, the poorest member of the party, even managed to impress the sommelier by ordering the fino sherry. Take that, attorneys!

The good news is The Classique was everything I want from mussels. It was tart, rich and just the right mix of flavors. The rest of the meal was decidedly uneven. It's wonderful to have St. Bernardus in proper glassware, but the cocktail I had afterward (Sunday morning) was unenjoyable. It tasted like cheap gin, for the most part. The bone marrow under our tartare was perfect, but pouring the tartare on top of it kinda ruined the tartare...it warmed the beef too much and the yolk (quail) was small and impossible to mix into the scattered clumps of tartare around the beef bone. I rely on yolk for that silky tartare feeling! I felt like if yer gonna do bone marrow do bone marrow! If yer gonna do raw beef, leave it to just that!My wife's entree, the Flamiche, was bland...the egg was entirely unseasoned and the puff pastry was tough and rubbery. She was not much impressed. New restaurants deserve (and often get) many a free pass while they work out the kinks.

On this particular day, we just wanted to pop in, order, and then hit the road so it was perfect.Unfortunately, the ribs didn't really do it for me. I thought they were okay but nothing special. I did find the BBQ sauce to be extraordinary though. I know each place has their own way of making the ribs but this one just didn't hit the spot with me nor anyone I was with. We did get two sides- the collard greens and mac n cheese. I thought the greens were good but the mac n cheese was a major let down- not great at all.

The burgers are consistently greasy and delicious, and they come in this really unique packaging that is a lot easier to deal with than the standard square of paper or foil that other places tend to go with. The Rise n' Shine is my go-to but last night I had the mushroom burger and it was excellent so I might have to throw that into my rotation. My mom was in town once and had the gorgonzola burger and her eyes got all wide when she took a bite so I assumed she liked it. (She later confessed she thought they made better burgers than Char-Grill, which for a native North Carolinian is pretty blasphemous.)Onion rings are really thin and crispy and good. Fries are not bad but not the best I've ever had. Can't speak to their milkshakes because for me it's Cheerwine or nothing. Yes, Cheerwine, the most magical soda in the universe! I never thought I'd see it up here and I could have wept for joy when I discovered it at Tasty Burger. They sell it in glass bottles, when they have it - yeah, sadly, they don't always have it. I'd say about 70% of the times I've gone they've had Cheerwine in stock. That other 30% makes me sad and is part of the reason I'm only giving four stars - the other is that last time I was there they were completely out of a number of things including onion rings and it was only 10 pm, which came as a surprise and a little bit of a disappointment.Definitely worth a trip no matter your sobriety level.

Here's the deal - yes, better Mexican food is available for cheaper all over town, but the food is not really the attraction here.  This place itself is the experience - there's all kinds of cool eye candy everywhere.  The amount of care, thought and effort that went into decorating the place bowls me over.  The whimsical Mexican art and furnishings, especially the Day of the Dead touches, are just too much fun, and  I'm not even an ethnic art and furnishings kind of guy.  A few feet away from the restaurant is the furniture store, where you can buy what you saw in the restaurant, plus even more crazy stuff.  The place is packed to the brim with fine quality hand-crafted furniture and assorted other home decor items.  Some items might not work anywhere, while others might be confined to the \\"man cave\\".  There's no pressure to buy - the feel is really more like a museum than a place to shop.  I can easily kill an hour there - it's like crack for those of us with ADHD.If you think of No Mas more as a wacky museum with a sit-down meal as an added bonus, you might enjoy it more.  Go with someone fun, plan to spend some time there, and take in the entire experience.

We went around 1 o'clock in the afternoon, so about normal lunch time. The main issue with this place is the parking - there's not much of it! And it's popularity far exceeds its size. The parking spots beside the road were very large, so one car could fit it the front of the spot, while another could park directly behind the first car. Two cars in one spot, where the front car is basically blocked in by the car in the back. It efficient considering the size of the lot, but the only unfortunate part is that if your parked in behind the front car, and they finish their meal before you, the host will come to your table and ask you to move your car so the other guests can leave. Which isn't a bad thing, just kind of inconvenient if you're in the middle of your meal. \\nThe restaurant (and parking lot) was PACKED. Many people in suits and business attire, a very popular place for folks in Atlanta to take their lunch breaks! Luckily, there were only 2 in my party, so we were actually seated instantly because we told them we were willing to sit outside. It was a very nice September afternoon so the weather really was perfect for an outside lunch.It took a moment for our waitress to come see us but with how crowded the restaurant was it was no surprise. But she was very nice and took great care of us. The service at Fox Bros. is really good.I ordered the Fox Bros. \\"Burger\\", with a side of Mac n cheese. The burger was a absolutely delicious! It was a brisket burger with bacon, onions, and pimento cheese. Slap some of their BBQ sauce on it and you've got the perfect BBQ brisket burger.The Mac n cheese surprisingly wasn't that amazing in my opinion. The consistency was good but the flavor was very much lacking.Overall I chose to give it 3 stars because of the terrible parking situation and what I would consider below average Mac n cheese.Would I visit I again? Maybe.

Fast and convenient! Here's our feedback on specific menu items: Stuffed Calamari- bland, we all agreed that we probably wouldn't do this one again but saw other reviews where people loved it. Missed the curry in this even though it's in the description. Tom Yum- flavor packed unapologetic, you better like lemongrass, ginger and mushrooms. *Drunken Noodles- medium is just sweet so we suggest more heat at least hot, noodles are a little dry but the flavor is addictive. Chicken is our favorite here-It is perfectly cooked and moist. *Beef salad- YUM. Very hot has a really nice kick! *Chicken Satay- our kiddos favorite peanut sauce is amazing. Lemongrass chicken- very good served with rice, perfectly steamed broccoli, carrots, and an generous serving of the amazing peanut sauce mentioned above. If you are looking for the spinach, cabbage or zucchini to be prominent you might be disappointed. Also for being called lemongrass, we missed this flavor. More like a moist chicken satay over perfectly steamed broccoli with a side of rice and peanut sauce. Volcano beef- eh we were neutral. We expected a little different flavor with the title I think. The pineapple and bell pepper were the big flavors in this dish. *fresh roles- I think we just love any excuse to have that peanut sauce *thai iced tea- sweet and creamy. We like it! We like the tastes however we find the descriptions a little off. We do keep coming back for our *favorites."},{"name":"Masa","address":"439 Tremont St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Masa is a great place for after work snacks/drinks, with a fabulous happy hour deal.  The tapas combo plate (normally 10 bucks, 5 bucks between 5-7 pm) was fantastic.  Some bites (the pork empanadas, chicken taquito, chorizo with cranberry chutney, and the shrimp) were absolutely delicious.  A few bites (the shellfish, the tuna sashimi, the stuffed pepper) didn't do it for me, but whatever, the whole thing was 5 bucks!     The sangria (also 5 bucks) was also delicious.  Leave it to me, of course, to turn a potentially inexpensive evening into an expensive one by ordering a caramel apple mojito and an appetizer on top of the cheap happy hour eats/drinks.  The caramel apple mojito was tasty, but didn't really taste much like a caramel apple to me.  I probably wouldn't get it again.  I'll probably stick to the sangria or try a different mixed drink next time. The appetizer I tried, the duck and scallop dish, was fantastic.  I only wish it was an entree size, because I wanted more.  I'm not even sure what the crispy bits of 'salad' were on the plate, but I practically licked my plate clean.  This is definitely a spot I will hit up with coworkers again this summer.   I also noticed some crazy inexpensive prices for weekend brunch and definitely want to give that a try.Tip:  Be sure to get there by 5:30 for the week day happy hour if you want to beat the rush and get a seat in the bar."},{"name":"YumDiggity","address":"209 Edgewood Ave","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"This is a solid lunch option.

This is one of my favorite spots for br/lunch on the weekends--but I rarely actually go because of the wait outside and the cramped dining room or bar areas. I have never not waited for a table. When I do have the time to brave the wait (weather permitting), it's always worth it, of course.\\nThe spicy Bloody Mary here has gotten me through many a hangover. I'd say they have one of the best Bloodies in the city--delicious and effective! We always order the Tot-chos (Tater Tot Nachos!) to start us off on our DF adventure. I can manage to throw back 1 to 2 of their dogs then. Their menu features at least 2 dozen+ gourmet dogs that you can get on an all-beef or vegan tube. I usually go for a dog that features sriracha sauce, but there are endless flavor combos you can experience. If I order a second, I will oftentimes get the Octodog. They trim a dog into the shape of an octopus and then serve him on a bed of macaroni & cheese. The mac & cheese isn't that special--it's kinda like Kraft from the box--but it's so much fun!\\nAnd as a transplant to Columbus from Philadelphia, I love that they have a boatload of Phillies memorabilia on the walls. \\nDirty Frank's is a must if you love hot dogs and fun!

The burger was dry. The donut sweet flavor was not to be had. They should make them bigger donuts to truly bring out that flavor.

They have about 4 tables that are available for families with minors after seven which may limit it's appeal.  Yet I felt like the noise level and general feel of the place would be appropriate for a family of not-too-young kids - younger kids might be really distracted by the activity going on everywhere.The teriyaki chicken was ok - I felt like mine could have been cooked longer.  The salad dressing on top of the lettuce salad is very tasty and tangy, a nice combination to the chicken.  For the price, it's probably one of the better options around.

I ordered lemon chicken, kung poa chicken, orange chicken and stir fried green beans.  The green beans were soggy, the kung poa was bland, the orange chicken coating was falling off and there was only either breading or chicken, and I never got the lemon chicken.  Instead there was some kind of breaded seafood that was so chewy it couldn't be eaten.  The food is no where close to how I remember it and won't be going back.   Also the food was not worth driving back to get the lemon chicken that I ordered which they mixed up with the chewy seafood dish.  Very disappointing!"},{"name":"Fox Bros.

The vibe and restaurant look & feel are like a Texas BBQ joint and the food will feed your crave.  The owners grew up in Texas so this definitely contributes to the Texas inspiration of the place.There are two Fox Bros BBQ locations in Atlanta, if you are looking for sit-down table dining. be sure you hit the 1238 Dekalb Ave Ne location.  The other location \\"Fox Bros. Bar-B-Q's \\"Que\\"-osk\\" is a fast-casual counter service place - basically a shipping container looking spot to grab a quick bite, not for dining in.I had the as my sides.  The pork and beef were juicy and delicious and the sides were equally fantastic.  Regardless of what you select for your main entree, I highly recommend  the Brunswick Stew & Fox-a-Roni sides.  They are aweSome!They do have a bar and serve up 7 rotating draft beers and 45 bottled beers.  You should have no problem finding a beer to pair with your Q.The place does get busy and parking is limited as you can read in some of the other reviews.  But don't let the parking deter you.

If that's your plan, leave earlier than you think you need to, because Stubb's is always crowded and it takes awhile to get your food. This might be blasphemy, especially from a 30-year Austinite, but the barbecue is decent, not in itself worthy of long lines or high prices. But Stubb's an Austin tradition and worth experiencing at least once. You can buy the Stubb's barbecue sauce at HEB, and I always keep a bottle on hand.Oddly, they don't serve their barbecue outdoors during the concerts, just drinks. That's too bad. Maybe they don't want to pick up wrappers, or they might become a slip-and-fall hazard in the crowds that pack themselves beyond the comfort zone on the huge caliche rock-pit standing area in front of the outdoor stage. Drinks are canned beer and mixed drinks served in a small plastic cup. Three bars surround the outdoor area, so you won't have to wait long for drinks.The indoor stage is in a tiny area with a full bar, and the outdoor stage hosts artists who draw a mid-size crowd that is willing to stand and sweat in close quarters with each other for several hours, on tiptoes if you're female or under 5'10\\". Suffice to say I've been to a lot of shows here. The sound and lights are excellent on the outdoor stage, and they have their crowd-policing down.There's a VIP tent, but it's way at the back of the venue, so VIP people tend to stand at the entrance and gaze across the crowd toward the stage. They may serve food in there, but there's a bouncer to keep out the riffraff, so I don't have details.If I had my wish list for improvements, I'd raise the stage about three feet, grade and change out the rocky clay ground for something more audience-friendly that inclines at a sufficient slope so everyone can see without shoving their way through the tight crowds (yes, you're a complete jerk if you do this), and offer barbecue wraps at the outdoor bars. I would also cut down the number of opening bands on some touring shows. Really, two should be maximum, but at times it's three. But hey, no one's asking me, and they seem to be selling out a lot of shows, so I'm not holding my breath in anticipation."},{"name":"The Cowfish Sushi Burger Bar","address":"Universal Citywalk - Orlando, 6000 Universal Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"We were here on a Saturday night and were told there was about a 40 minute wait.  Since it was the last night of our vacation, we decided to simply stroll around CityWalk and await the text that our table is ready which is an awesome feature.  But first, I decide to check just to see if there were three seats at the bar available to us so I took the elevator up and BAM, there they were, the last in the restaurant.  We quickly settled in and the two amazing male bartenders began catering to our every need.We aren't usually ones to sit at a bar but there was so much ample room and the atmosphere was fantastic, lively patrons all around us, a fairly noisy dining room and these guys kept throwing jokes and quips at us all night long.  I ordered a Dogfish Head 60 Min IPA on tap and began to peruse the menu.We decided to start with the Blackened Tuna Nachos that weren't in the style of tortilla chips but rather very large crackers.  At first it was a bit tough to separate them, they overlapped and the ratio of tuna to cracker was off a bit.  But once we decided to just mess it all up and divide up the delicious toppings, nobody cared anymore and it felt like we were actually eating \\"regular\\" nachos with seared, pink fishy on top.  Although friends had raved about the bento boxes, I wanted to try the Americanized version of sushi since this was our first time experiencing something like it.  I frankly thought it was going to be gimmicky but it turned out to be over the top good even if the value wasn't fully there for what you get.  We did the filet and American cheeseburger.  I enjoyed the filet better and felt it was worth it over the cheeseburger, since it included an actual fish bit while the cheeseburger one did not.  I would get both again but the Filet was simply outstanding and if you didn't look down, could be convinced that you are getting a standard maki roll in a higher end sushi restaurant.  My wife loved her OMG Doug Roll even though I didn't try much of it to weigh in here.  The two bartenders who I unfortunately didn't catch the names of, were amazing all the way through.  Constantly refilling waters without being asked, making sure our dinner experience was enjoyable and talking with us throughout even though they were super busy.  The touch screen where you could create fish on the screens swimming atop the bar was fun too, even though it didn't always respond to our touches and the fish looked silly with a fire hydrant hanging off their back ends.

My friend, Kelsey C., and I ordered the pork cheek tacos to start. It's very hard to screw up tacos. As long as you cook the meat thoroughly, have a decent tortilla and add some kind of sauce, you're bound to get a tasty dish. ArtBar found a way to screw it up. The tacos, which took at least 15 minutes to arrive, were COA: Cold On Arrival. Not \\"Oh, they're still somewhat warm, I can live with this\\" cold. \\"I've been sitting on a cold, metal counter for a loooong time\\" cold. The meat had toughened because of that and was bizarrely placed at the side of the plate, requiring us to assemble the tacos ourselves. Que? Did the chef get tired of the 15 extra seconds it would have taken to scoop the meat out onto the tortillas? Because it sure seemed that way.My friend had the Lobster Roll as her entree and I got the Game Hen. There was absolutely nothing special about the lobster rolls. Just lobster pieces covered in mayo. The lobster portion wasn't particularly generous, the buns were forgettable and it was just mayo, mayo, mayo throughout. That's fine. Lobster rolls are pretty set in how they're made. The Game Hen on the other hand. What was that? Really tough pieces of chicken stuffed with what I can only determine to be salted, julienned vegetables. The accompanying \\"potato cakes\\" were just thin slices of way-too-salty potatoes.For dessert, we got the Almond Streusel Cake which was decent but nothing remarkable. For drinks, I had the Vernon, which was utterly forgettable. For a place that's supposed to be known for its cocktails, I found the selections boring.Next, the decor. The restaurant is dark, not in an ambient way, but in a \\"We're too cheap to pay for more lighting\\" kind of way. The decor is sleek and soulless, the standard hotel restaurant/bar decor with no signs of personality added.And finally, the service. The reviews citing long wait times weren't exaggerating. It took at least 15-20 min to receive any of our dishes. Considering the restaurant was at best 1/5th full, there was absolutely no excuse for the long wait times. Our waiter looked bored and was unfriendly. When I asked him to recommend a sweet cocktail, he pointed to one that had gin. When I told him I wasn't a fan of gin and asked for another recommendation, he got huffy and claimed none of the other cocktails were sweet. Which was just wrong because I could tell from looking at the ingredients that there was at least one other cocktail that would taste sweet. Don't come here. If you must eat in this area, go cheap at one of the Cambridgeside Galleria chains or go pricey at Dante, which has better service, decor and food."},{"name":"Aji-Kura Ramen & Sushi","address":"5857 Victoria Drive","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"My husband and I were looking for a new sushi restaurant in our area and decided to give Aji-Kura a try.

The service is always attentive and friendly but still subdued enough that you don't feel rushed or like your conversation is constantly being interrupted. My boyfriend and I probably come here every three weeks or so, and have enjoyed the meat and cheese board, perfect salmon tartine (open faced sandwich), spicy deviled eggs, and more. They also make almond milk lattes, which is plus for the dairy/soy free crowd (get on board Starbucks!).

However, they have a decent selection for all meals, and everything I order is edible.  The service can be slow (often they forget if you ask for water), and the quantity of food that you order rarely comes correct (always lower), but I enjoy it.  I have ordered up to 4 sheets before, so the low order quantity doesnt factor in too much, as long as you dont fill up too fast so you cannot order more.Overall, if you are going to go to all you can eat, for the price, Ninkazu is a good option."},{"name":"Tasty Burger","address":"1301 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Greasy burgers and awesome onion strings.

Scamorza, mozzarella di bufala, pepperoni, garlic, pecorino romano, and sausage come on this pizza, but in the large variant for $25, I felt like I got screwed. The pizza was very light on toppings. There were only a few pieces of sausage and pepperoni on it. The cheeses were sliced way too thin, and there were whole areas of the pizza where the dough had bubbled up and left me with nothing but bread. There was barely any sauce on the pie; I thought that they had forgotten to put sauce on it at first until I saw a little outline of it near the crust.

I can't describe it any other way. The pimento cheese was sharp, yet creamy. The biscuit was flaky and SO flavorful... this wasn't your traditional buttermilk biscuit at all.

But their biscuits are amazing and you can't deny that.)My girlfriend got the grilled cheese which was was actually a grilled pimento cheese with BACON.

Very rich, but yeah, it didn't suck. \\nNow on to the desserts:moon pie: ehhh, I wouldn't get it again... it wasn't bad by any means but with how incredible everything else was, this just wasn't a highlight. salted caramel dark chocolate pecan pie: !!!!!!! this is a bold statement but this is the best pastry I've ever tasted in my life. It was a mini pie, and where I usually only take small bites of sweets, I could have shoved the entire thing in my mouth. Kudos on the mini pie thing as well.. I can't eat a lot and my boyfriend isn't a big fan of sweets (crazy) so they usually go to waste in our house. Although, lets be realistic- I'd eat one of these entire pies no matter how big it was. It was THAT good. I usually eat the filling out of pies and leave the crust because I'm just not a fan of the chalky, bland taste of pie crust. However, I actually really enjoyed this pie crust.

However, on a recent Saturday afternoon visit, Tasty Burger served up a very delicious burger.  I got the Onion Burger, that was smothered in fried onions and Swiss cheese.  It was amazingly tasty.  Lot's of burgers rely on their juiciness (i.e. melted fat) to supply their taste.  Something about the seasoning they use here made this burger exceptional.  The burgers come by default cooked medium (they ask if that's what you want, so there should be no surprises.)  Mine came medium, but I think next time I'll get medium-well or well.  I just don't trust that redness in a burger that I didn't cook myself. The fries were nearly as good as McDonald's.  The onion strings were REALLY good.  They are very greasy, but loaded with onion flavor.  Eat them quickly as the flavor fades as they cool (ours arrived piping hot.)I was surprised that they have beer and wine.  The Pats were playing and the bar was full of people watching the 3 flat screens.  It was still very family-friendly (I was there with my wife and 7 & 9-year olds.)  Our waiter was very friendly and efficient.The only reason that I gave 4 stars versus 5 was the ice cream shake.  They describe them as having 4 scoops of ice cream.  My wife's arrived warm and as thin as chocolate milk.  She sent it back and the waiter apologized (profusely!), took it off the bill and gave her a free Diet Coke.

The ramen was tasty, it was unique , atmosphere drips Austin- so why a four?\\nWell although this tiny ramen centered restaurant opened to incredibly good reviews and lots of televised kudos on the food network, along with local chef followings when I went along with an Asian friend from the restaurant Industry, he said there were some noticeable changes from the first year of this restaurant to now, and for him one of them was a biggie! They are outsourcing their ramen noodle, it's no longer made in house by the chef/owner and for my friend that was huge and he explained that the current noodle is not the same consistency/chew and flavor as its predecessor. \\nWe did move past that and I truly enjoyed the broth, the pork (chashi) and the marinated egg- (ajitamu) they are absolutely delicious and the different \\"bombs\\" that can be acquired and added make for some tasty variations. \\nSomething else I must comment on are the Sweet and Sour Yodas. Ok- I must say I have never tasted such delectable brussell sprouts in my whole life ( and that's a boat load of years!!!). I think I could eat them and eat them and well you get the picture.\\nSo overall this was a really good experience and I've been back with a grand son who thought it exceptional.

I ordered their shrimp ball on top of shitake. The texture of the shrimp ball is not as tender and juicy as I expected. Also, the Egg Custard Buns taste like the frozen ones you bought from the supermarket. The steamed pork ribs taste ok, the ribs are well seasoned. If you like taro and pork, order this item, it comes with tiny pieces of taro. Egg tart here is not as great as advertised, the outside cluster part is too oily. Sesame ball and red bean ball have the same issue of being too deep fried (oily in general). \\nThe good thing about this restaurant is the service and space. This store is very big, they can host gigantic crowd at once. So if you really want dim sum and cannot find a spot on weekend morning, try Hei La Moon.

You clearly have no joy in your heart or an understanding of what makes Hand-crafted BBQ so special.  Where to begin? At the beginning. We tried to eat here on Veteran's Day but no go. Too many people and no brisket for us. Luckily my sister lives here so we came back the next day at 8:00. SCORE!! We were third in line. Granted, it was one of the coldest days in Austin but we enjoyed our line time(with beer and good line companions) despite the freezing wind. When we got to the counter the first customer ordered 25 POUNDS of brisket and 20 of turkey. That slowed things up a bit but what fun to watch all that glorious meat being hand sliced. Finally, my turn. Since there were 3 of us we ordered everything. And honestly, and I don't say this lightly, EVERYTHING was remarkable. Of course the brisket is legendary and with good reason - juicy, smoky, tender and the right amount of fatty fabulousness. The ribs surprised us. Meltingly tender, juicy and falling off the bone (I have to say head and shoulders above the Salt Lick). Biggest surprise - the turkey. Who orders turkey at a BBQ place SSOOO GOOD. A turkey triumph. The other 2 items, pulled pork, delicious and the sausage -our least favorite - but still well above average with a nice snappy casing. After eating we had a short conversation with the man himself, Aaron, and he couldn't have been nicer or more welcoming. The same can be said for every employee we met. Overall a truly delightful experience. BEST BBQ I'VE EVER HAD."},{"name":"Masa","address":"439 Tremont St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Excellent!

The service is very friendly and more knowledgeable than I expected. A lot of the waiters here looked like lifers. I felt the Portland history in them.In addition to the great oysters my coworker selected, I loved the dungeness crab, shrimp cocktail, and calamari (kudos for the 3 sauces). I was so full after sampling the appetizers that I wasn't sure how I was going to work on the main course. I found a way. The sole was delicious as was my coworker's halibut and side of mash potatoes. Then it was time for dessert. I was completely stuffed, but it didn't prevent us from ordering the fruit tart and chocolate bag. Oh and the lemon drop is a great starter drink.

Whatever they put in the gravy that graciously covers the mashed potatoes and acts as a great accompaniment to the chicken is phenomenal. The collard greens are the best I've had, ever. I've not been able to try anything else in terms of entrees. I feel like it's a mistake to go and not have this chicken. Appetizer wise, get the one with the BBQ pork and if they have the fried green tomatoes, get it before they run out.

Our server--who is also the owner (maybe?)--helped guide us through the menu. He was really friendly and patient with us, and we appreciated his recommendations. We started with the Bombay Brussels and the Gobi Manchurian (cauliflower). Both were amazing, and we mean A-FREAKIN-MAZING: best apps we've ever had at an Indianesque restaurant.For dinner, we got the goat curry, vegetable momos, malai kofta, mattar paneer, rosemary cheese naan and saffron naan. Everything was incredible except for the paneer, which was meh and watery. To be fair, the owner wasn't a big fan either but our friend insisted on getting it anyway. There are three reasons why we wouldn't give it five stars: 1) The goat curry had way more bones/fat than actual meat 2) The paneer (see above) 3) The saffron naan was a bit strange and too sweet.Overall, though, this place was a true gem to find in northwest Austin and we'll definitely be back to try more of the menu.

As some say this place, no matter how stuffed yoi get, you feel great after. I admit its been a little while since ive eatten here, but i see more and more opening and i appricate them here!

I got there early (it WAS Friday, after all) with only the intent to grab a burger and take it home.  And I actually ate the food before writing a review.Space is nice, but I can see it getting overfull rather quickly.  I would suggest, based on what I saw of patrons, get there early unless you like a wait. Do they take reservations? I have no idea.I'll make this quick, as all I did was takeout.  I ordered the Foster Burger (with bacon and cheese...for an extra $3?).  I also ordered the two boarded appetizers available for the day (fried avocado with kim chee and the B&W Fries (the black being the squid ink aioli)). I raced home after a bit of a wait (they weren't full, but were getting there, so it wasn't inordinate) with my newly acquired prize in hand.The burger was very tasty...were I to fall into the overtired paradigm of school grades, I would give it a B+. Since I actually read the menu and saw that it plainly stated that all burgers were cooked to medium unless requested, I got a medium rare. The bacon was excellent and the overpriced cheese added just the right sharp tang...The avocado appetizer was also quite good...not overly breaded or fried...the sauce striking the right balance and the kim chee was excellent - which is odd for me, as I'm not really big on kim chee...go figure...The fries were average...obviously hand cut (due to the irregularity, but still thin) and sprinkled with parmesan. The aioli (squid ink? really???) was bland and seemingly only there to add the \\"Black\\" to the B&W app. Please note that these are not the fries served with the burger (I opted for the mushroom soup, which was good not great).My current grade is only for the burger...not the best in town (Bamboo Sushi, Fat, Laurelhurst or Toro Bravo anyone?) but close to my house and an addition to a struggling neighborhood that has worlds of potential.  I would say 3.5 stars for now and erring upward as I am focused on the burger which, while a little spendy, was worth the visit..."},{"name":"Hei La Moon","address":"88 Beach St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"The dim sum is okay here.

When you scoop up a bite, there is a cheese pull like a pizza commercial. The sweet potato fries are amazing, sweet, salty, and crunchy. Last but not least, the chicken is amazing. The fried crust is amazingly seasoned while the meat is perfectly flavorful and moist. It exceeded expectations. We had the peanut butter chocolate cake for desert, and it was beautifully presented.

So I had one more to test out before watching the experience on the telly. \\nhttp://www.austin360.com/weblogs/tv-radio-blog/2014/sep/14/4-austin-restaurants-featured-new-bravo-show/Zombie Town: \\nWe got there at noon on Saturday, October 25th, and there were only 5 tables of people.

Biscuits & Gravy: 86ed\\nThen things got weird. Of the 7 selections or so listed on their brunch menu, both my friend and I wanted to order the biscuits and gravy.....\\nProblem: They were out of biscuits! Say what!!! You can't say it was too crowded, so what is going on here? They just forgot to get biscuits that week? Remember that there are only a few items on the Saturday brunch menu, and there is no lunch option on the weekends--they only serve that M-F.\\nSolution: Then it got more inventive: you could still have the biscuits and gravy but instead of a biscuit, they would use pumpernickel bread. Ack. This is the type of thing I would consider really adorable if I were visiting a restaurant located on a tiny island run out of someone's house....not what I expected from a contender for one of Austin's \\"Best New Restaurants,\\" as the Bravo show is called. I'm not saying they belong on the other Ramsey show or anything, it's just a little too expensive to have to deal with all that hullabaloo and poor planning. I ended up with a croque madame and waddled my way out of there. If I went back, it would be to check out the lunch or dinner menu only.

Although it does get crowded on the weekend afternoons, my roommates and I are always down to squeeze our way through the crowded doorway, past the large parties of people waiting in order to get our group on the waiting list. Why, do you ask? Because of the shmorgasboard (did I spell that right?) of food that is awaiting your consumption both on the ground level and downstairs in the basement. Dim sum isn't too easy to mess up, so while I LOVE the typical foods (shu mai, har gow, cha siu bao), it was all pretty standard. The service there is typical of an authentic chinese restaurant: no chitchat, you wave them over if you want something, and they get it for you ASAP. Bing Bang Bong. I still don't really understand how some of the waiters do the math on the check so fast though. I'm always in awe as I watch them add up all of the dishes and even factor in the tax (carry the 3, multiply that by 2....except imagine 10 more of those calculations in 5 seconds flat). I always come here with people who sometimes have no idea what the heck any of the dishes are. And because me and my family are dim sum freaks, we can usually navigate through all of the names and contents of the food with little frustration. Everything that we have tried at Hei La Moon has been yummy, no complaints there. There was just this one incident that we joke about even to this day. Last year one of my friends really wanted those fried sesame balls with the sweet paste in the middle. However, I guess they were in high demand that day so one minute we saw them from across the room but before the cart came to our table, all of them were gone. Needless to say, my friend was about to have an aneurysm and it soon became a little cat-and-mouse game at our table to eye those sesame balls when they came out of the kitchen and find a way to snatch em up before they disappeared onto another table. I'm sure that was an isolated incident though because all of the other times, there have been plenty of sesame balls for us. Bottom line: Don't have high expectations for the service and don't predict that you will be blown away by the food. But for yummy, authentic, affordable, Chinese cuisine (4 of us were full for $40 total), put on your fat pants and come to Hei La Moon!"},{"name":"Tsim Chai Noodle Restaurant","address":"8251 Westminster Highway, Suite 50","city":"Richmond","stars":"3.5","text":"Decided to stop here on this rainy, blustery day for some wonton noodle soup.Place was pretty packed, and they asked if I wouldn't mind sharing a table.  I was starving, and didn't want to wait so I went ahead and sat down.So many good things on the menu, but I decided on the wonton noodle soup, as that sounded perfect for a cool wet day such as today.  Did try ordering gai lan, but they informed me that they were all out.The wontons didn't take too long to arrive, and I immediately proceeded to scarf them down.The wontons were SO delicious!  I can definitely taste the difference in their wontons, compared to wontons I have had at some other places.  I've been to some other places that have very little prawn in their wontons, and mostly \\"filler\\" (fatty pork, etc.).  When I'm super hungry, I'm notorious for diving straight in for the food, and not waiting for the food to cool down a bit.  However, I couldn't resist moving onto the next yummy bite, even as I'm burning my mouth from the hot temperature of the wontons!Also, as mentioned by other reviewers, their wontons are huge!  If you were to put a whole one in your mouth, some people may see a similarity between you and a chipmunk storing it's food temporarily in it's cheeks!On a side note, I was actually rather pleased with the taste of the hot tea they had today.  Instead of the \\"run of the mill\\" type of tea, they had a nice lychee one.For payment, it's cash only, but that's not too big a deal for me as I am used to these types of places accepting only cash.For parking, it can get a bit tight.  I ended up parking at the neighboring plaza (which is not far at all).You know that feeling you get when you burn you mouth and/or tongue?

But the one time I came a little later in the night, I was told by the guy at the door that I needed a backup ID for my PASSPORT. I find this a bit odd, because the reason I carry my passport on me is because the other forms of ID I have are typically not accepted (foreign ID card, foreign drivers license). I normally do not even bother to carry these other IDs on me when going out, and just pack my passport.

We narrowed it down to this place and Vivo Italian next door.  We had not been to either and this one won out.  \\nIt was about 5:30 on a Tuesday over Christmas break and we as a party of 5 were seated straight away.  We were seated on a patio outdoors on the second level.  \\nThe set up of the restaurant is a bit weird, but also kind of neat.  It was ultra modern.  Unfortunately the restrooms are on the third level so you either have to climb lots of stairs or wait for an elevator.  \\nOur waiter was prompt and our service was excellent, but I found our food to be just average.  \\nWe started with fried pickles app.  These were not the worst fried pickles that I've ever had, but they were far from the best.  They were kind of greasy, though not so bad that they were inedible because I've had those before, but the real problem was the crust or lack thereof.  The breading was really thin.  It doesn't have to be super thick, but I would've liked more than was present here.  Additionally, many pickles stuck together which led the already thin breading to only be present on one side of the pickle since it was stuck to another.  At least the price was reasonable and the portion large, but I would not order them again if I came back.  \\nThe shtick with Cowfish is that it is burgers and sushi.  I really appreciate this concept as a non seafood eater because it means my friends and family can get their seafood fix while I can eat a burger.  This is precisely why we ended up choosing this restaurant.  However, the execution leaves something to be desired.  \\nThe burgers are huge!  They are 1/2 pound burgers.  If there was a smaller burger option I was not aware of it and this was a real bummer for me.  I did not want 1/2 pound burger because I knew I couldn't finish it.  I know they had mini burgers on the kids menu.  I think you might have been able to get a couple mini burgers, but that to me is just more bread.  I would rather just have a 1/4 lb burger.  \\nThankfully, my cousin and I agreed on some really odd burger that sounded good to both of us so I ate 1/3 and he ate 2/3.  It was an Elvis burger.  They called it the Elvis has left the building or something.  It had peanut butter, deep fried bananas, and bacon.  It was weird, but delicious.  It came with fries which were good, but not exceptional.  \\nMy boyfriend had a Longhorn burger with French fried onions, bacon, cheddar and bbq.  He really enjoyed it, but said his PB&J Milkshake was the highlight.  I took a sip and would agree that the milkshake was the best thing on the table.  \\nMy other cousin had a plain bacon cheeseburger and my last cousin got a bento box.  She was the only one who got seafood, but she found the sushi to be underwhelming.  Her favorite thing was the mini burger that came with her bento box.  The bento box also featured edamame which was bland and under seasoned.  \\nSo, the highlight was the milkshake and a menu that would seemingly please most appetites, however, in reality the food is fine, but not spectacular."},{"name":"Fat Matt's Rib Shack","address":"1811 Piedmont Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"If you're looking for a restaurant with white table cloths, an extensive wine list, vegan menu options and valet parking for your Ferrari, DO NOT go to Fat Matt's.However, if you're looking for stick-to-your-ribs (no pun intended) food, a fun atmosphere, the coziness of a small dining room, great staff, the ability to chow down without worry of getting food on your shirt or sauce on your fingers and you aren't annoyed by having to circle the lot to find a place to park your pickup truck, then you've found your restaurant!The ribs are great, but don't forget my favorite the 1/2 chicken.

I had sides of Ranch Beans, mac and cheese, and of course cornbread. The meats had plenty of smoke flavor and ample seasoning. In fact, you don't need sauce to enjoy them (to me that is the hallmark of good BBQ). However, if you sauce, it only adds to the flavor and the sauces very much compliment not diminish the flavor of the meats. So much so that they sell their sauces commercially to the rest of the free world.It's a great venue to eat, drink with friends, or catch live music - or all of the above. It's a hot spot for SXSW, but really good music acts can be seen there on the weekends. After all, it's Austin right! Parking can be tricky, bring money for the meters!

As I sit in my car after leaving the restaurant I can't help but feel as if I was treated differently sitting at the bar by myself. The other guests which walked in after me at the bar were told the dinner specials, I wasn't. I had to ask for bread which was burnt I could only eat the inside, the other guests received it right away. What I ordered was definitely not what I expected it was a piece of fried veal topped with arugula and tomatoes, no sauce, no sides. I wish the menu was more clear on what to expect as it was very bland. I asked the bartender to order a side of pasta which took more than 20 minutes I asked for it togo. I was never asked how my meal was, I was not paid attention to. Will I return? I'm not sure yet. Maybe someday, just not by myself, not at the bar, and I will ask more questions regarding the menu."},{"name":"South City Kitchen Midtown","address":"1144 Crescent Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Unfortunately, I think this place is over hyped. After seeing the reviews and hearing all the talk about it around town, I was excited to check it out. We made a dinner reservation and sat on the heated patio (I liked the Patio, inside was soo crowded and loud you wouldn't be able to have a conversation). The service was okay, our waiter was a bit slow (though he was polite, made up for it at the end with complimentary dessert which I totally appreciate!) We started with the crab soup and it was really quite amazing! creamy and tasty. From there we decided to split the fried chicken. The friend chicken was HIGHLY disappointing. I love salt ( I am not a low sodium eater by any stretch). This chicken was SOO salty, it tasted like it was brimmed for a few too many days. Additionally, it was horribly greasy. Fried Chicken should not be THAT greasy, it tasted as if they didn't put it in hot enough oil so it soaked it all in. The cocktails and dessert were all pretty okay. I liked them but didn't think they were worth raving about.

The broth is really rich with lots of flavor and creamier than any kind of Asian soup I've ever had. It was so rich that I definitely couldn't eat the broth on its own. I felt so bloated after I ate it. The Fire in a Bowl definitely has a kick, but I have a pretty high tolerance for spice, so I'm kind of immune to it. My friend said otherwise. It's really up to each person on that.The only con I have is that the aftertaste stays forever, and it tastes like I just ate iron or something. It's an aftertaste I definitely didn't like.

I have had a few great afternoons leisurely drinking and being entertained by kids doing the funniest things.  I have always had good service here.  I asked about a certain wine once, and the server admitted she didn't know, and had another girl come over and explain it to me.  That was awesome.  Too many times people pretend to know about something when they don't.  On another occasion, we had a server bring us free pretzel bread with mustard butter (probably because we were getting drunk).

My friend and I split it and it was the perfect amount. However, I do NOT think that that portion size was worth $14.

It wasn't.I ordered a couple of chicken platters, one with sierra mist and one with sweet tea.  I paid and then wandered around the dining room looking for a clean table.  When I say this, I am not exaggerating: Every single table in the dining room had food, sauce, or trash on the table itself or on the benches and chairs.  Every damn one.  They were not short staffed, nor were they too busy to clean the dining room; the staff just doesn't care.  I eventually found a booth with just some food in the bench so I sat on the edge.  I put my napkins and sauces down, then went to get my food.I was given my platters and one sierra mist and one cup full of ice and nothing else.  I figured that the sweet tea dispenser was self-serve so I didn't think anything of it.  I took everything back to the table to unload, then took the ice back to the front to look for the tea.  There was no self serve iced tea, so I asked the staff for some.  Their response: \\"We're out of sweet tea.\\"Sorry, I had something retarded in my ear, could you repeat that? So instead of telling me when I picked up my food that you were out of tea and offering me something else, you figured giving me an empty cup of ice was the best alternative?The food was fair.  If the dining room was clean and the staff weren't a bunch of lazy idiots, Pollo Tropical would be a great place.  However, I'll say this: This is the fourth different Pollo I have been to, and only one of them has been acceptable.  I kept trying different locations, assuming that I was just getting unlucky, but I've been to three different ones in the Orlando area and all have been dirty and filled with lousy, uncaring staff.

It was such a shame, because each item is made with very interesting spices that probably would have been amazing if it wasn't ruined with loads of salt. Even the dessert was salty!

I forgot the name of what I got but I've added a few photos for y'all to find out.The rice and pork thing that's not the Ramen is an appetizer I believe. THAT was very good. They give you a nice portion for the price and the meat was seasoned very nicely. The mochi ice cream was good...but the only reason I got it was because I wanted to try mochi ice cream made at a Japanese place...honestly it's not worth the money, haha.This place is packed so expect to wait in line like all the other yelpers are saying.Some may say that the items on the menu are a bit pricey, but honestly, I believe it's worth your money. The bowls of ramen are like a dollar more expensive than large bowls of pho. The thing about Ramen and Pho is that the flavor of the broth means almost EVERYTHING. If the broth isn't good then the dish is crap. Tatsu-ya delivers. The portioning is not STELLAR, but they do give you a good amount that left me stuffed at the end of my experience. And plus, like I said, the flavor and overall taste makes it worth your money.Ok it's coming back to me. I think the rice and pork thing is Chashu or something. That in itself is definitely worth your money, both in terms of flavor and portioning.What's NOT worth your money, as I stated before, is the mochi ice cream.The atmosphere and decor is nice with the hustle and bustle theme of a standard ramen house.

This is hands-down the worst ramen I've ever had, and I've had quite a bit of ramen. Granted, I've never been to Asia, but I used to go get authentic ramen in the Japanese district on Sawtelle in Los Angeles. This ramen is nothing like that ramen. The Tatsu-Ya soup broth is cloudy, salty, and fishy, and gets worse the more you eat it. Good ramen broth is clear. The pork was not great and covered in fat. The egg was overly pickled and clearly past its due date. Here's the other thing - which maybe people in Texas do not understand. When you get *real* ramen, they put it in a big huge bowl. The portions are usually very generous. But Tatsu-Ya? They CHEAT you by giving you what appears to be a big bowl, but the bowl has a fake bottom in it. So you aren't getting as much soup as it appears. For about $10 per ramen, this is way overpriced. And it's enough to make me boycott this business, because I hate cheap business owners who try to cheat their patrons like this. Atmosphere? Great if you are a hipster 20something and don't mind disgusting, sticky floors, loud music, and being forced to sit on precarious box-like stools at group tables. But if you are wanting a nice, peaceful, private dining experience, forget it.We tried two different kinds of ramen, both tended towards being too fishy and salty, and one of us got a bit sick afterwards.

The wait staff was prompt and on the ball, nothing drives me crazy more than sitting at a table and not seeing a wait staff member for minutes--not the case here. They immediately bring over water and menu's so you can start browsing.The menu is a bit crazy for my own personal tastes but there are still things on that menu to order off if you're not a seafood lover. We had a few members of our party that love to find unique foods and pairings and had a great time ordering off the ever changing menu and all the food came out perfect and tasty.The food was nice, but we really went here for the cocktails. GM Curtis asked us what type of drinks we liked and then asked if we wanted him to get us something he knew we'd like and we agreed. All the cocktails that arrived fit our palate and did so with unique style and elegance. While you can order a Mai Tai, Mojito or Long Island Iced Tea, the cocktail menu offers many recipe designs completely unique to Wink & Nod, so we all strayed far away from the \\"known names\\" and made this more of an experience in cocktail craftsmanship instead of just a \\"night out.\\" Even if you want a Long Island Iced Tea, you'll find every ingredient is hand prepared from sour mixes to grapefruit juice (yeah, they juice all their own stuff). Just as people want fresh seafood when they go out to eat, Wink & Nod knows people _deserve_ fresh cocktail creations as well. House made tonic water, house made juices and if Coke is needed it uses non-HFCS coke (with real cane sugar), imported as needed. Yeah, they go above and beyond to make sure you not only get the most pure experience, but an experience not made from high speed manufacturing.Wait, you're with child? That's fine, GM Curtis brought over mocktails for our mother-to-be at our table in hurricane glasses just as if she was able to drink so she didn't stand out or have to sip on a cranberry juice but received non-alcohol cocktail creations fresh from the bar. What? Yeah, hospitality is apparently a priority here.Everyone is treated as if they were a movie star, all the products are fresh and hand made from food to cocktails and the bartenders are experts in the craft so you don't have to worry about ordering a Gibson and getting something that tastes like a Subway Sandwich--it's going to be classic, balanced and designed correct (with their own cocktail onions too).If there was one thing I would say could have been better for me, it would be had the music been turned down a half click on the dial. While the music fit the theme, I'm more about the conversation than the music, but I did get used to it. Boring is not on the menu, next time you go you may find the food and cocktails are changed up with brand new creations making each visit something special. Highly recommended."},{"name":"Newk's Eatery","address":"2566 Briarcliff Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE and EAT AT YOUR OWN RISK.

The person answering the phone took the complaint as well as my name and number and stated the owner would contact me by the next morning. That did not occur. I had to call back to speak to the Manager who was not in and after another call finally got in touch with the manager who basically told me, \\"well it wasn't our food that made you sick, maybe you are developing a shrimp allergy or it was something else you ate\\". That \\"food poisoning would not occur until after 24 hours\\".

After reading some very positive reviews about this place, we decided to give it a try.Jimoco is surrounded by a few old shops and restaurants. It looks ghetto from the outside! I was very surprised to see the line up when we opened the door. There were about 5 groups of people ahead of us when we put our name down. The waiting area was just right by the door- small and crowded. We waited at least half an hour before getting a table. I didn't mind the wait since everyone seemed to enjoy their food.After we sat down, our waitress was very pleasant and apologized for the wait. While we were debating between the meatballs and caesar salad as our appetizer, our waitress advised that they made their own caesar salad dressing. We then ended up getting both! I really liked the salad especially the cheese crumbs on top! Romain lettuce was very fresh and crunchy. But we both didn't like the meatballs. It was over-baked, very dry. The tomato sauce was not too bad.Here it comes to our 2 for 1 pasta! I ordered Carbonara and my boyfriend got the Fettuccine Ragu. The Carbonara was very tasty! Creamy but not too heavy with a good amount of thick bacon bites. The Ragu was made out of beef short ribs, not just ground beef! Portion was pretty good too for the price!Large Caesar Salad $6\\n4 Meatballs $5 \\n2 for 1 Pasta $18.95 Overall I really enjoyed this place!

He was correct. This is hands-down my favorite restaurant in the Boston area.  Here are the reasons:1.  Their beer selections.  Always rotating around, you never know what you're going to get, but it's always good and eclectic.  I had this pumpkin ale (called Pum King - go figure) around Halloween that left me drooling.2.  Their appetizers - my personal favorite is the buffalo tofu, but their nachos and calamari is also top-notch.3.  They have a ton of vegetarian options.  Although I now eat fish and shrimp, I appreciate any effort restaurants make to accommodate the Veggies.  And it's almost all good.  Except one time (out of many) I took a gamble on the special that wasn't very good - I take the blame for that one.4.  Their menus.  The people on the cover always remind me of the 'Good Friends' Kashi cereal.  Are they good friends, or are they more than good friends?  Maybe they just like cooking together.5.  It's close to my work, and it's a great place to go hang out with friends and get caught up.  6.  The downstairs ambiance is great, although I am all too often sat upstairs, away from the cool kids.  This is the equivalent of the Thanksgiving card table detention.Attention Ladies - the way to my heart is 3-fold:1.  Good, varied beers.\\n2.  Tasty vegetarian options.\\n3.

We used to live in San Diego, and have eaten in Mexico many, many times.  The food at Chez Jose's is good, but not authentic mexican in my opinion.  I ordered a beef taco and a carne asada burrito in a combination plate with rice and beans.  The corn tortilla the taco was in felt and tasted like cardboard, and was probably baked or prepaired off site.  It was not fried with the filling in it as it would be in true Mexican style tacos.  The beef filling was ample, however it had a somewhat stale, overcooked texture and may have been just scooped out of a pot for various beef dishes.  My burrito had the same beef in it, and had the same flavor & texture.  I had actually ordered a carne asada burrito, but the waiter got the order wrong.  He did cut my order cost in half after I asked about the mixup.  The beans & rice were smothered with lettuce, sour cream and cheese and were decent.  We were served tortilla chips & salsa, but sadly, the salsa tasted worse than the stuff that comes in gallon jugs at the supermarket.  Again, I suspect they have a supplier who delivers in quantity, not quality products, and this stuff was like ketchup with onion & pieces of peppers in it.Service was great and everyone was very friendly and helpful, but the food is what matters the most to me, and it misses the mark by a long shot.It is fairly noisy also, and seems to be a family place, since nearly every table had a few young children.I really wanted to like this place since it is close to home, clean and attractive, but it's just not Mexican enough for me.I would KILL for a combo platter from Alberto's or Roberto's in San Diego."},{"name":"Cured","address":"1825 Pearl St","city":"Boulder","stars":"4.5","text":"Yum and Nom!What a delight to see two businesses sharing the same space!

I used to live in Boston, and spent at least once a week eating at Sonsie - and one extra time per week for after-work drinks. I still have to go when visiting Boston - it was such a part of my life there!The Sonsie Caesar salad can't be beat - nice and lemony - no mayonnaisey taste or texture. I was ready to FedEx this to SF when I was going to move. Still good today! The Mee Krob used to be on the menu -- my ceramics professor from BC made all of the original bowls they served it in when the restaurant opened. They also have some very decent pizzas (with American toppings - sometimes they stray a bit) that are perfect with the Caesar salad for lunch. The steak is unbelievable - especially when washed down with a tall Guinness or maybe now that we're more enlightened, a glass of Cabernet!Yes - the brunch scene is the scene - especially when the throw open the windows during the summer.

You would think they would make some attempt to at least make them not seem so stale and tough but I guess that is not important when you have a captive audience.  It would be great if they listed it that way.  \\"Our Trio Combo, proudly served with stale tortilla chips from Costco along with salsa, queso, and guacamole.  Looks just like the Mexican Flag.\\"I am not sure how it looks like the Mexican flag.  They share the same color theme but, if you look at my pictures, you would have to wonder what in the world are they carrying on about.  The salsa was not placed anywhere near the queso and guacamole.  Maybe our waiter just messed up?  The poor guy did not seem very happy to be there.  He had zero personality, perhaps he doubles as a Star Wars Robot when he is not waiting tables.  He did manage to go through his robotic functions in a timely manner though. So, let's get back to the trio. The warm cheese dip otherwise known as queso was actually pretty good, the salsa was tolerable, and guacamole was also pretty good.  It kind of reminded me of the guacamole that Chevy makes for you at your table only you get much less than a quarter of the amount.La Cava Del Tequila is set up like a quaint little cavernous alcove with lots of wood and Mexican murals on the walls. It is a nice little place to get away from the crowds and heat.  It might even be considered a little romantic.La Cava is really all about the tequila.  They have a huge list of tequilas and margaritas to choose from.  You can even order flights of tequila.  Ida and I were interested in the margaritas because they were cold and cold can be a very good thing on a hot August day in central Florida.  What they don't serve is non alcoholic drinks.  So why do adults insist on bringing their children into this establishment that only serves adult beverages.  What kind of a parent forces their children into adult drinking establishments?  I know I wouldn't have dragged my child into this place when she was young.  Of course the kids were quickly bored and wanting to go back to the things that were fun for them so they made it not so fun for the other adults trying to relax for a minute.  The drinks were also available to go at the bar so I am not sure why they felt like they had to force this situation on both their children and the other adults?  Having four children sitting around impatiently watching you drink tequila cannot be that great of an experience.\\n. \\nAnyway, I really had a nice time savoring my avocado margarita even with the distractions and I am pretty sure Ida enjoyed her Blood Orange Margarita as well."},{"name":"Dead Lizard Brewing Company","address":"4507 SW 36th St, Ste C","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Cheers to Dead Lizard. While on a recent business trip I felt deprived of good craft beer. You see I live in Loudoun County (VA), which is often called Brewdoun County for 20+ craft breweries and pubs we have. Anyway found these guys on Yelp and wasn't disappointed. Perfect craft brew tasting room vibe. Looks, smells, feels like it should. Tried the Komodo Dragon Chocolate Stout. Regular version not the nitro. This is 9% Stout with belgian chocolate and cocoa nibs. It was amazing. Despite all the cocoa, which I love, the malt came through and it had a nice bitter finish that acted almost like a palate cleanser. Lots going on here and it was all good.Also tried the red dred ale. This looks like a standard red ale, but with the extra hops it was more like a cross between a red ale and an IPA. Also very tasty.Prices were good. Plenty of parking. They had a food truck when we were there. Do not know if that's common or not.

As we were walking through the restaurant, I found myself really liking the vibe of the restaurant - modern, casual, and fun. It seemed to be pretty popular too since most of the tables were filled.I knew right off the bat I wanted sashimi, so I went straight for the 9 Piece Mix (tuna, salmon, and yellowtail). I also ordered a side of seaweed salad and a cup of hot green tea. The sashimi was awesome - I'm definitely a regular consumer of sashimi so I'd like to think I'm a pretty good judge. It was the perfect texture: not at all slimy or soggy, but melt-in-your-mouth kind of soft. I like to eat my sashimi with wasabi, and the pairing here was great. Out of the three types of sashimi, my favorite was the salmon, but I might be a bit biased because I tend to like salmon in general. The side of seaweed salad was also decent, but a bit rigid for my liking if that makes sense. I don't mean to say I like soggy seaweed but the seaweed I got could have been more limp/softer in shape. Green tea was classic, and served on cool plating.The only slight complaint I have is the wait time for the food. I think we waited 15-20 minutes, which isn't terrible, but not great either especially since there were no appetizers. Other than that I had a great experience - both the food and service were great.

The service was pretty good, although the people who brought our food to the table were so awkward and intrusive. One guy was pushing other things on the table out of the way with the mac 'n' cheese container. What? But don't think about that--the service is good.Now the bad. Like others have said, the fried chicken is a joke. It's unremarkable, greasy, and doesn't seem to have any seasoning at all. And it's supposed to be some of the best in the country? Who judged that? People who have never had fried chicken before. The catfish is also barely seasoned and didn't have much taste. The sauce looked and tasted like some kind of diluted tomato sauce or something. I had to make myself eat it because I was starving.The presentation of the food is atrocious. I get the concept of family style, but when you don't order family style and you get a plain white plate with only a piece of fish on it, or just a couple of piece of fried chicken on it, it just looks depressing, cheapo, and like you didn't make any effort. The small bowls of sides are pointless. Just put the sides on the plates with the entrees! It's not family style if only one person is eating stuff and has to put it on their own plate from a bowl. That's making me do your job.As if all that's not enough, this place is way way overpriced for what they're serving.I was so so excited to go to Revival, and I was literally angry after I ate there. I won't be back, and I won't be trying other Kevin Gillespie restaurants because of it. And that's really disappointing.

While in line we were told by staff they turned away about 400 people today and they doubt there would be anything left by time we got to order.  With only one person left behind us, we decided to chance it!  As expected they were out of everything by the time we got to order, but there was enough to make us a sandwich! YEA!  we also had beans which were so yummy and the key lime pie, which was AMAZING!!!!  My husband and I split everything which was perfect!  I'm not a huge BBQ person, but I did highly enjoy all the mixture of flavors in my mouth.  The best part of this experience was waiting in line talking to some amazing locals.

Obviously, the question always comes up: Is it overhyped? The answer is \\"absolutely not.\\" My friends and I waited about 40 minutes or so for a table. The one thing that I did appreciate about this place before we even sat down is how efficient they were in getting people in and out the door without ever bothering them or being pushy. Now comes the food: I don't know if I have had a meal quite like this one. My friends and I split about 5 or 6 plates and the most memorable were:Bananas foster French toast - we split a  1/2 portion and believe me that was plenty. This was quite possibly the best French toast I have ever had. It was a type of brioche that was soaked in vanilla custard and the bananas on top were infused with rum. Amazing. Fried Chicken and waffles - This was the highlight of the meal. What is different about these chicken and waffles from any other place on earth? They used a sweet potato waffle. How genius was that? It was like 3 pieces of fried chicken over a bed of sweet potato fries with syrup on them.

We had reservations for 6:30 but arrived early, about 6:00, and were still promptly seated.  We each ordered one of the great many specialty drinks - both were very nicely done and tasty (I had the Lemon Drop - quite yummy - I don't recall Anne's drink but it too was an old-fashioned recipe and also quite tasty).  We did not have appetizers.For my entre, I ordered the \\"Chef's Recommended\\" Wild Oregon Petrale Sole Parmesan - delicately crispy pan-seared sole - and it was fabulous.  It came with very creamy and clearly fresh mashed potatoes as well as lightly grilled green beans and carrots, also well prepared although a tad bland.  The veggies could have done with a little seasoning.  But the star of the plate was the sole - simply delicious.  A nice touch was crispy lightly grilled salty-style capers - added a little zing.Anne had the grilled trout (which of course I had to sample multiple times!).  As with the sole, fabulously prepared and delicious, cooked just right and very well seasoned so as not to overpower the flavor of the trout.  It came with the same veggies I had, and instead of mashed potatoes this dish came with baked or grilled potato chunks.  They were tasty but nothing spectacular.  Didn't detract from the dish overall though.And as with my previous review, VAST menu, and gigantic portion sizes.  The prices are a tad high, but the portion size makes up for it.  Would be nice to have smaller portion sizes (\\"Lunch Size Plate\\") at a lower price, since some of us prefer not to leave stuffed, but also hate to waste food (traveling so can't box it).Our server, Scott H., was awesome.  He checked on us regularly, had a nice sense of humor, and when he'd pop by and see us in conversation would simply move along and not interrupt.  He was very menu-aware and in fact recommended the sole to me over another choice I considered.  He made a great suggestion based on what I was looking for.Up 2 stars from last time just because of the overall terrific experience, food, and service.

If you enjoy Mediterranean food, than this is the spot for you!I ordered the cauliflower bowl with salmon that comes with pesta sauce, tsaziki sauce, feta cheese, and cucumbers ($12.95). I just mixed all the ingredients in the bowl and all the flavors just exploded in my mouth.  Did I mention fresh ingredients and healthy!  Well if I did, it was just awesome repeating it again because I was revisiting my lovely meal!  This bowl was really light and yet filling at the same!  Also, it fulfilled every requirement for my new food restriction (I'm currently going through a sexy quest  & trying to look good for the summer).I recommend to try this place out!  They offer meat, falafels, gyros, lamb, hummus, and pita things also.  I really was tempted to try their kabobs but probably next time considering I'm being cautious about how much I'm eating also!

I was quite put out when Roadhouse changed their menu and I was unable to get my beef rib fix.  Thankfully, I found Soul Fire and ordered up spare ribs, fried chicken, collard greens, and fries.  My fiance got the smoked chicken, pulled pork, mac and cheese, and mashed potatoes.  I took one bite of that subtly spicy breading and fell in love with the fried chicken.  I tend to review emotionally but it was delicious.  The spare ribs were not beef but they were still finger licking good.  I guess I am just not a fan of collard greens as they are too bitter and sweet at the same time.  However, the mashed potatoes were garlicky and delightful.  Next time, I am ordering fried chicken with mashed potatoes and allowing it to dive into the nirvana that is my stomach."},{"name":"Southeast Wine Collective","address":"2425 SE 35th Pl","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"I've been patiently awaiting the opening of the Southeast Wine Collective for a few months now... The urban winery movement in Portland is an exciting one, for sure. Portland is full of talented artisans making delicious things for me to enjoy, so of course - the urban winery movement just adds to the wonderfulness that makes up this city. We finally had a chance to make it into the new wine collective (a collaboration winery of 4 different urban winemakers here in Portland). First of all - the space is gorgeous. It's bright, rustic modern (if that's a thing), comfy benches near a window stacked with pillows, slight smell of barrel wood, and uber friendly staff.They have a fun tasting menu to craft your own flight, or a pre-selected flight. I chose the pre-selected flight with continuation. It included 6 wines and a small plate of chocolate/nuts to accompany. This was $14 (you can get a small flight of 4 wines and no chocolate for a few dollars less.The wine was fantastic - enjoyed a very buttery and herby Chardonnay, a floral pinot noir and a few other delights. The small plate was actually just a piece of dark chocolate with nuts - a little disappointing in it's lackluster, but tasty nonetheless. The pours on the flights were pretty weak but other than that, well worth a stop in and see the new place. If I were you - I'd craft my own flight and skip the piece of chocolate (as delicious as it may sound on the menu) - you'll get to try more wine and get more bang for your buck!"},{"name":"Se7en Bites","address":"617 N Primrose Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"When I have friends and family in town I always take them to Seven Bites for some amazing southern comfort food!

Marco's Restaurant offers popular Italian-American dishes, at great prices, without the hassle of having to go to Boston's North End. The problem I had with this restaurant is that it severely missed the mark in terms off offering an overall aesthetic that was consistent and welcoming. That seems like a very vague criticism, but there was just an overwhelming sense of hit or miss that was slightly off-putting to me.Marco's was recommended to us by a client of my father. The service we received was exceptional. Knowing a very little bit about the owner being a former baker, we were not surprised to experience one of the best bread baskets I've had in ages. The dipping platter and the quality of the fresh-made bread (made in-house) was incredible. We were ravenously hungry and this was a great start. From there on out, however, the meal was a swinging pendulum in terms of likes and dislikes: Broccoli Rabe, not that great; Burrata e Prosciutto, fantastically fresh and tasty; Arancini special, OK, but too much truffle oil; Bucatini Amatriciana, had a metallic taste so I sent it back; Gnocchi Pesto, one of the BEST gnocchi dishes I've had on record. In addition to the other items eaten at the table by my family, there were equal accounts of thumbs up and thumbs down. Overall, the restaurant was very clean and it had the initial feel of a very fresh, American-style restaurant. Unfortunately, it was a look that didn't really speak to the actual style of everything the restaurant had to offer. There was none of the character that usually goes along with a restaurant serving these kinds of dishes. On the flip side, if the aesthetic was meant to be a more modern, trendy version of an old classic, they certainly didn't go far enough with that plan. There were a ton of typos on the menu, and that drives me crazy, especially if you make the effort to use authentic names: do your homework. The decor felt very fake and disjunct from the overall quality of the food. With high, open ceilings and brand new everything, it seemed odd to have tiny sconces and  inappropriately small frames on the walls. Italians are big and bold, there's no surprise that the atmosphere should be just as welcoming. There were entirely too many tables for such a small place, and I can't help but feel as if the over-sized granite bars (taking up two of the four walls) were poorly designed relative to the space. The hanging blue lights out front (not sure if they were left there from Christmas) further cheapened the look of what could be a really nice place. For me, a restaurant should never lose sight of the overall experience if you're looking for legitimacy. When things are done haphazardly, I'm the kind of person who sees that and wonders how the owner hasn't. There are many places I go to that suffer from the problem of lacking quality in overall aesthetic. This doesn't necessarily make it a place I wouldn't go again, I just tend to prefer places that appease all of my senses equally. That means it goes a lot further down my list of dinner-time decisions.  I'd be interested to see if Marco's Restaurant can somehow afford to give more attention to detail. I got the impression that this place isn't meant to be a dive, or just slightly more than your average Italian take-out joint. If you open a restaurant and you want to fill the tables, I think you have to maintain control of the entire experience. There's no other way to stand out from the rest, if you don't make yourself exceptional. P.S. The music was terrible."},{"name":"Fazenda Cafe","address":"3710 Washington St","city":"Jamaica Plain","stars":"4","text":"LOVE this place. Excellent coffee.

We wanted a light snack so we ordered the beef Jamaican patty. To be honest one wouldn't fill me up. The Jamaican patty was spicy and flavorful but I wish it had more stuffing/ meat. Instead of microwaving it like most places do, they actually grill it for you which was a nice touch. The white wood breakfast consist of a butterfly hotdog, one fried egg, two pieces of chewy hard toast and an under seasoned potatoe patty. Wasn't a big fan of the breakfast, though it's still healthier than Ihop and McDonald's. Also tired the whistler mountain berry tea, it was so gross, like bitter flavour water, when I asked if they had any honey they said they don't serve honey only sugar syrup and maple syrup. I put a crap load of both syrups and sugar and it still tasted gross.

Not bad, but didn't knock my socks off. For an appetizer I ordered the Green Garlic Popovers ($6.50) from the local organics menu. The waiter informed me that it was just one popover, but it was large, then said that if he was eating there he wouldn't order an app because the portions are big. So I told him to forget the popover and we proceeded to order our dinners. Not two minutes after he walked away, the popover arrived at our table, clearly fresh out of the microwave (blech!) because it was absolutely steaming hot, which is usually a good thing with food, but not a baked good such as this. We ate it anyway and had to add salt just to choke it down because it tasted like nothing.Okay. So that was the only bad thing I can say, and it didn't ruin the experience, but things didn't get much better anyway. I had the fried chicken and it was fine (as in tolerable). Nothing spectacular. My husband had the jambalaya and it was fine. Again, nothing spectacular. The service was fine too. Not great or bad. One thing I will mention is that it's a very loud space, even when it's not that crowded. We arrived at 6:00 and were seated inside immediately, which was fine, and there was a wait for an outside table. By the time we left at a little after 7:00 there was quite a crowd waiting to be seated, so go early. Oh, and the prices weren't bad. Will I go back? Yes - but for breakfast.

My first 2 visits were great experiences and not one complaint comes to mind. After going to Sunday brunch with a friends yesterday and having such a bad experience with pretty much everything, I highly doubt I would return unless many things change.They usually start off with a basket of amazing warm cornbread and 3 dipping sauces (honey butter, apricot jam and a cranberry sauce of some sort). This time the cornbread was cold, hard and mostly burnt. The waiter did not introduce himself to us and the second time he came to our table I asked him for his name and it was Nick. Now I don't know if Nick was new and it was his first day but he was extremely inattentive and not once asked if we needed anything. We constantly had to ask him for the things we needed, such as refilling our water, or putting in our order or to have a refill. Basic typical questions a waiter should ask a customer weren't asked at all. A friend and I both ordered the southwest eggs Benedict and she ordered hers with steak and mine just reg with my eggs over medium. Both our orders were not hot but more like warm in temperature. My other friend ordered the empanadas which are on the app menu and she was happy with them. The location was pretty empty compared to the other times I've been, which was surprising.

A burger from here will leave you satisfied and will not leave you hungry. This branch is really cute and cozy, and it gives that retro and vintage vibe since the restaurant is in an old car garage. Also, it's in such a convenient place because it's around many other restaurants, schools, markets, and cityTarget! My go to's are the college student deal which comes with a hamburger, fries, and a drink. I usually get a chocolate milkshake, and it is always devine. The burger is also filled with flavor. The patty is juicy, the bun is soft, yet has a crunchy exterior, the vegetables are always fresh tasting. The fries are always crunchy and never soggy, which I appreciate. Along with the fries, I always add the Tasty seasoning because it just gives it a nice kick of flavor. If I don't get this combo, I get the Tasty burger with fries and a bottle of water. Again, along with what I said about the burger, comes the Tasty sauce, which taste somewhat similar to In N Out's spread. It just makes everything so delicious and I do recommend this to everyone! I love Tasty Burger, because it never fails to satisfy my burger craving. Also, they have the best service! I don't think I have been to Tasty Burger and left upset because of the service.

Our waitress (and bartender) last night was super rude and incredibly hateful towards us. We were in Columbus for a rare night out with friends. My husband and his friend had gone ahead of us and sat at the bar and were just getting ready to have a late dinner there last night. The guys wanted to have a couple of drinks with dinner before we headed home. I wasn't drinking but my husband asked if the waitress would pour him and his buddy a couple of drinks. The waitress responded with \\"we aren't that kind of bar\\" and refused to serve him. Now, we are over 21, had our IDs and money, not driving, and not belligerently drunk. In my eyes there's no reason not to serve us. But my husband is a sweet guy so he just said \\"alright\\" and ordered a plain hotdog and a some water. Our tab was a grand total of $6 at the end, normally we would have tipped our $1.20 but she, up to that point had been terrible, didn't ask if she could get us anything else, and didnt even bother to refill our water and just totally ignored us. When she saw that we didn't tip on our $6 check she rolled her eyes and shook her head and just generally made a little scene. Because she wanted to make a scene, I told her if she had been nicer, we would have happily tipped more. She then asked me to repeat myself. I did. After I repeated what I said, she got irate and started yelling at me, so we left. By far the worst experience I've ever had. And the worst waitress.

There isn't much seating in or outside, so it's probably hard to get a table during the lunch rush.  I did see folks picking up carry out, so that might be a good way to go.Since it was lunch I didn't want to carb-overload, so I ordered the chicken salad with a side of green salad and it was very good.  It wasn't swimming in mayo, it had a nice celery crunch, and was sweetened up a tad by some cranberries.  There was a lite olive oil dressing on the green salad which I really liked.My lunch companion went with a sandwich off the breakfast menu that you can also order at lunch time as well.  I have to say I was a bit envious of her selection.  The bread looked amazing!  I could identify eggs, bacon, and get this...pimento cheese!  Who would have ever thought to do that?  I lived in Kentucky where pimento cheese is like caviar, and I never saw it used in such a creative manner.

We recently visited Japan and starting to get ramen withdrawal. We're both from Southern California and had hoped we would get a chance to taste some Austin style of authentic ramen. We had high hopes since it had a great review with an ample amount of review. But for whatever reason our visit tonight was not that impressive. First of all, I thought that Texan are know for their friendliness. That was not clearly present tonight as the first person that we talked to did not really greet us too kindly, gave us a number and command we sit in the corner.  My fianc√©e had a question about noodle size (she preferred the thinner noodles) but they did not even try to entertain the idea. After we left the host said have a good day sir, turned to look back and realized she was talking to a man behind us. (If she meant it for us she would have at least acknowledge my fianc√©e) Overall, we didn't really feel welcome in this place. Don't want to say it might be the way we look, or I was wearing a Dallas Cowboy Cap, or whatever but did not get a good vibe. The atmosphere was kind of off. Didn't really feel comfortable. The music was loud with some kind of grunge music. I get it, it's hipster but does it have to be so loud people have to yell to have a conversation?  The stool had ropes handle that scratch your legs and the table were kind of sticky. On a plus there were some nicely decorated Japanese style theme like the Komodo on the wall, ropes hanging and a katana sword handle as a draft beer handle. The price was a little pricy for the portion. I'm still kind of hungry even though I ordered the #1 with a side of spicy edamame and a Mexican Coke. The ramen had one small chashu (pork slice) and very little noodle. It actually tastes authentic, with authentic flavor but it was very small. In California you'll get the same amount of ramen for around 7 bucks (and when you finish the noodles they'll offer you extra noodle for a dollar more). So paying $10 for a small bowl is definitely disappointing.  The spicy edamame was a little too salty, we dipped in the ramen soup to wash out the salt. I think overall the ramen tasted good but the price and experience made it just an okay place. I think it could have been way better, but unfortunately our experience was very disappointing. Maybe you'll have better luck.

I asked for a little more bbq sauce for my burger and later discovered a $.75 charge for the small paper, serve-a-portion container appeared on my bill.  When I asked why I was being charged for more bbq sauce when I did not have much on my bbq burger to begin with, I was told that the charge was due to the fact that the sauce was \\"homemade\\".  I do not see where that really explains much . . . seemed more like a flimsy excuse to me for an extra charge.  Overall we were not that impressed like some of the other yelp reviewers seemed to be with this place.

At least Killer Burger which we would rate a B+ or 85% includes fries with the burger whereas everthing at Foster Burger seems to have an added extra charge like the aforementioned bbq sauce.  The above reasons and some other minor reasons were the main mentionable justifications for the two-star rating.  Hope this saves some yelpers time, money, and expectations for anytrhing more than an OK burger at the Foster Burger restaurant/bar.   The burger prices seemed steep, too, compared to Killer Burger.

The ambiance exudes a desire to bring in the hip crowd. A little weird to have explicit rap blasting on a Sunday afternoon, was a little uncomfortable bringing my folks in.

The tater tots taste really good, nicely fried. However the pork burger was oily, taste a little sour and dry, the pork was burnt black at the bottom which you can't see it unless you flip it. The portion of the burger is filling. I would recommend to visit if you want a hearty meal. It is a good place for friends' gathering but if you're concern about smell on your hair and clothes, you probably will want to bring along your cologne or perfume.

I'm always tempted by the specials but I typically stick with the salad and wrap.  In the wrap there is plenty of crunchy romaine, cucumbers, jalapenos, tomato's, feta and kalamata olives wrapped in a soft warm pita.  The salad is just as good just not wrapped in the pita (it is actually cut up on the side).   The only complaint that I have is that for $3 extra you can get chicken on the salad, and the last 2 times I have ordered it the chicken was the equivalent of a small chicken tender cut into 3 pieces and was on the dry side.  Not worth the extra $3 charge.  When I first started going to Lizzies, I know I was given more chicken so hopefully this won't be a typical occurance. If it is I will have to bump them down a star because the extra charge isn't worth it for what you get.

Now pass the pipe. But after my pulled pork sandwich experience at Screen Door, where the cole slaw is spread onto the moist pork bits to elevate the taste to Elvis-like greatness, I must admit that I was uninformed. Mistakes were made. I did not have gustatory relations with that side dish in the past, but now I am open for negotiation with cole slaw as long as it's made like it is here. Seriously, what doesn't Screen Door cook well? Veggies? Seasonal side dish menu. Starches? Corn bread and potatoes in all sorts of forms, all of them amazing. Desserts? Don't be mean to the ice cream! To sweeten the pot, they have a fabulous wine selection and one of the friendliest waitstaffs I've ever encountered, in Portland or any place.

After placing your order there is no where to sit to wait on to go orders. You have to stand with your butt facing someone's table or lean against the drink fountain until someone needs to use it. I waited for about 5-7 minutes. I ordered the rib sandwich, potato salad, and rum beans. Just as another reviewer stated, they roll your sandwich up really tight in butcher's paper and the bread is stuck to the meat. The ribs ARE NOT barbecued! They have been boiled first and then perhaps smoked and/or placed on a grill. They have definitely taken a short cut to mass produce their ribs. They don't even have a smoke flavor. They give you sauce on the side. It's enough to drown your food so that you won't be able to tell the meat is boiled not barbecued. The sides were delicious, but small. They come in little cups which are not equivalent to a full cup.

The stake was cold and greasy. The server forgot my husband's drink - nonalcoholic beer. I asked the server if the steak could be heated up and explained why. The manager took my plate to the kitchen and came back with another plate with again a cold steak. I did not say anything and ate part of the salad and my husband asked for some tea. The server also forgot the tea. We reminded her of the tea and she brought the tea. She brought us the wrong bill, assigned to another table. I talked to the manager and asked her for the right bill. The manager came to our table, ripped the credit card machine copy and said I didn't have to pay because I had had a horrible experience. I explained that I wanted to pay for something - my husband's meal, at least. She was so nervous that I thought it would be better just to leave. Four days later, I was surprised with the credit card being charged for the wrong amount - assigned to another table, and I did not sign the credit card copy, because the manager ripped the copy while in our table."},{"name":"Ramen Tatsu-Ya","address":"8557 Research Blvd, Ste 126","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I tried the pork sliders and they were excellent.

They didn't finish the bowl. They had goyza and Ramen bowls and beer. Then I had the Miso-No (Pork, Noodle, Corn) for soup and added the brussel sprouts to it. The broth was bland and I should've done a spicy add-in. I'd like to compare to other Ramen places. I still like how The East Side Kings made their Ramen and wish they would continue ramen on their menu.

Ingredients tasted fresh and the cheese/sauce were good.Not-So-Good Points: The guy on the phone had no idea what special I was talking about when I asked about the coupon posted on their website which was a little weird. We figured it out, but the delivery was supposed to be 45-60 minutes and actually took almost an hour and a half (we missed the movie we wanted to go to). When the pizza arrived it was still warm but it have been stacked without those little plastic things to keep the box up so the cardboard had smushed into the top of the pizza and pulled off the toppings when we opened it. I was pretty unimpressed with the salad too. There wasn't anything really wrong with it, it just wasn't great (lettuce, some veggies, ranch dressing, $6).Overall I was pretty appalled by the service but I'm inclined to give this place another try since the pizza was pretty tasty and maybe the delivery guy just had a tough day."},{"name":"Cypress Street Pint & Plate","address":"817 W Peachtree St NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Let's be honest -- Whenever anyone has mentioned Cypress St, the first thing they talk about is the Sublime Doughnut Burger.

I'll just say that you should go for the biscuits and leave. First, I waited 15 minutes for table to be cleared despite having made a reservation. I was expecting to wait approximately 5 minutes but would have been okay with a few more minutes, but not 15. Below is a list of the food I sampled and my thoughts on each dish:1) Cajun Guacamole - had a heavy citrus flavor to it. Would not order again. I recommend Lolita's (two blocks up the street on Dartmouth) different guacamole options.2) Fried Chicken - not bad. The sweet & spicy sauce made it worth it.3) Aged Gouda Mac & Cheese - flavors were decent but the mac should have had a thicker consistency. Also, it was topped with hot Cheetos. Why??4) Cast Iron Rabbit & Dumplings - Meh. Sauce should have been thicker.5) Beignets - not bad. Liked them although they were heavier (and more expansive) than what I've had in New Orleans.6) Warm Honey-Glazed Biscuits - the best thing I tried there.7) Lemonade - was very sweet but I loved it. It's made in-house for cocktails but I opted for a liquor-free night.Music could have been turned down a notch or two. It would have been nice to hear some jazz in a New Orleans themed spot.Ethan's wine pour was skimpy as well.So what else was great about the place? Our server Ethan did a good job (sans the wine pour). The ambiance was very nice because of the several rooms with different styles. So B&B was not horrible but I cannot recommend it to anybody looking for New Orleans food, considering I have been to New Orleans several times and enjoyed dining at some great restaurants.

This made me nervous but after reading a few good reviews I really wanted to try this place out! The service we got was really good and fast -which I expected due to lack of customers. I ordered a burger and the fondue and enjoyed both. I can't remember what my hubby ordered but he was also pleased. For my daughter we had the coconut crusted chicken strips which came with this amazing sauce and it was to die for. The drinks were stiff so to top it off we loved it! The next time we went was on Halloween night. The place was packed and there was a band playing. Apparently the coconut chicken tenders are no longer on the menu which was depressing because I knew that's what I wanted from the get go! The waitress said that they received too many complaints that the chicken looked burnt. So sad day :( I ordered a wedge salad and it was great! My hubby had chicken jerk tacos and loved them. We recently got a 50$ voucher for 22$ so we will be going back soon.

It was one of the most delicious dishes I have ever experienced.\\nThe savory essence of the rich Burrata contrasted perfectly with the sweet hints lent by the honey.Next I tried the Raw Sugar Pumpkin Salad with Xertoli almonds, dates, sardo and Jalepeno Brown Butter. The pumpkin pasta had a wonderful amount of crunch, I was surprised at just how satisfying it was.Next arrived my Slow Roasted Pork Shoulder with kimchee oil, aioli and Benne Seed crumble.Slow roasted to that perfect point where you can cut each morsel with the mere side of your fork, this dish quickly disappeared leaving me wondering if table fairies lived at A&H or was I seriously being that greedy...Last was the Crispy Berkshire Pork Belly with roasted strawberries atop Anson Mills Grits.Though delicious, this was a bit rich for me (or perhaps it was that I had already gorged myself and already had dessert on my mind.)I know... But you cannot go to a restaurant ranked nationally among the top 100 new restaurants and not order dessert. And so I tucked into the Baked Apple & Olive Oil Cake Trifle with Aleppo & Honey Whipped Cream with brown sugar.Perfect in my opinion minus the overabundance of nuts, this plate did not see much action due to my rapidly expanding waistline.

IN the south?The reviews that point toward this place being \\"bad\\" because of the price are comedic in the sense that if you use Yelp or this newfangled thing called the internet, that you have access to see the menus and the little numbers that are next to the menus that are called PRICES. Yes children, those are called prices, and when those are added up, they are usually called \\"the check\\".The location is pretty cool, especially being that the house is just one block off the Decatur square, which makes taking a stroll much easier either before or after your meal. I think that the feel of \\"grandma's house\\" was hit spot-on, and the service made it feel that much better, even if we were crammed in to what was the front room. The menu is very simple, and everything is done like what southerners are used to, but with simple twists that improve the gene pool of otherwise boring and overdone southern dishes. If you've lived in the south for any extended period of time, chances are you've had every version of Revival's dishes, but not done the same way. There is no cafeteria-style that seems to populate southern restaurants around these parts, which is a nice break. Most of us have eaten at places with names like \\"Simply Southern\\" or \\"Mama's Country Kitchen\\" which often times are just sheet biscuits sent from the distributor, and gravy that's made in a giant tub. None of these things apply to Revival, mind you.Yeah, it's a bit on the expensive side, but you knew that when you walked in. You get the experience, along with great service, and tasting things slightly different than what you've become accustomed to.

McDowell bao. And a side of kimchi fries. After trying all three baos, all three were amazingly tasty and very delicious. The chicka bao bao is the most famous that everyone gets and I have to say it is quite good. The fried chicken they put into the middle of the bao makes the whole eating experience better lol. Fried chicken just makes everything taste better you know?! The Mcdowell bao is a funny creation. It a burger patty mixed with lettuce, some special mayo together and it tasted exactly like a Big Mac from Mcdonalds. I kid you not it's very similar to a big mac lol but just in a bao instead of 2 buns. The kimchi fries were delicious as well, added kimchi on top of the fries with some bean sprouts. Fries were crunchy as well. The big bang bao tasted similar to eating some bbq lol, sorta smokey with sweetness of the sauce. Overall, cool place with good food. Staff were really nice and pleasant. The size of the restaurant is quite small and a bit squishy with limited inside seating.

CONS  We arrived about 1pm and luckily there was no line outside.   Waiting in a line in the florida sunshine is not  someone cares to do.   Once inside, we had to review the menu on the board or take one of the menus  and step aside, they kind of frown on you waiting to place an order.   The wait line inside is very short, so I can see why there is usually a wait line outside.   Once ordered we found a L-shaped table in the corner, not very accommodating, especially if you sit at the end, you have to constantly move for other guests to sit down.   There are a few tables, \\"family\\" style tables with chairs and plastic benches seem to be the norm.   The Noise Level is very \\"HIGH\\".  In order to hear each other you have to speak loud, or be drowned out.   This is due to a tin roof overhead and no insulation to absorb sound.   PROS.  Our food came pretty quick after ordering.   I had a chicken sandwich on sourdough bread.   It was very good and filing, comes with chips or fries.  Others in my party had egg sandwiches, which also were very good.   The sweet tea is an \\"orange blossom tea\\" and not tasty.   It has a perfume taste, I guess that is the \\"blossom\\"  Skip the tea and order a soft drink, however, they don't have the usual commercial brands,  The dispense machine states Stubborn, so it may be a local thing.

We showed them the menu and raved about the place.But the possibility of a wait over an hour for breakfast?  And standing in line before it opened....for breakfast??Fortunately they went along with the gag.And weren't disappointed.  Now fair warning (in case you haven't caught on yet):  If you're in a hurry, don't go here.  You won't be happy.  There is usually a wait for a table and a wait for the food to come.If you have the time to wait for a table (there's a coffee place next door -- grab a cup, read the paper and RELAX), you won't be disappointed.  This isn't fast food, either.  Takes time to actually cook real food rather than microwaving something from a package.Oh, yeah, the food......Chicken and waffles -- you either have a breakfast for 2 or 3 or a big breakfast with leftovers for lunch and dinner.  Unless, of course, you can eat an entire waffle and 3 chicken breasts.  Cooked to perfection with a crispy crust and juicy meat.  And the sweet potato waffle is quite yummy.I'm an Eggs Benedict fan.  Someone else in the group beat me to it, and we had agreed that we would all get something different so we could compare.  Their Eggs Benedict is perfection.I elected to have Eggs Sardou.  Good decision.  Kind of Benedict-like, but not exactly.  English muffin, artichoke heart (this is a heart of a fresh artichoke, not something from a jar or container).  Poached egg, and a creamed spinach sauce topping.  The sauce is chopped spinach with a cream sauce.  You can actually see and taste the spinach, not the usual greenish sauce.  Grits and cheese -- not cheesy enough for my tastes, but I would be content with a slab of cheese and a knife and fork.....Hot chocolate was steamed milk with excellent chocolate.  It has that distinct steamed milk taste, so if you don't like that, don't try it.And the coffee?  This is the Pacific Northwest.  Bad coffee would a felony.By the way -- don't get the idea of leaving a \\"representative\\" to stand in line with the rest to catch up later.  If the entire party isn't present you won't be seated.

We did this past Friday night. First, this is not a dive bar. Whoever thought this was a dive bar has never been to a dive bar. This is a nice neighborhood bar, a bit on the classy side (as in exposed brick, high stamped tin ceilings, dark wood, candles, long curve-around bar). We loved the atmosphere though it was louder than we expected. Even when sitting right next to each other in a booth against the wall, we had to shout to have a conversation. The place was packed on Friday with nowhere to sit, not even at the bar, but we managed to snag a nice booth when a couple saw us searching and offered their spot as they were leaving. We ordered beer, hard cider (Vandermill; never heard of it before, but liked it), and the Black Bean Jalapeno Dip appetizer. The drinks were large (and cheap!) and the appetizer was tasty. Everything was going well. And then we ordered dinner. Now, I had read the reviews. I knew no one was raving about the food at Club 185. But it's pub food, right? We weren't expecting much and figured we'd have a simple, solid dinner. Well, we didn't expect as little as we got. I ordered the Club 185 burger with cheese and my husband got the Cuban sandwich. I got the mac and cheese side and he got the onion rings. My burger was pitiful. Seriously, might as well just go to McDonald's. The bun was a thin, smooshy white bun - the same cheap buy-em-by-the-pallet kind you expect at family picnics and church barbeques. The \\"cheese\\" was an American cheese food single and the burger was tiny. It was a 1/4-lb burger at best, maybe smaller. Even with lettuce, tomato, onion, and pickles (hold the mayo, please!), I barely felt like I ate anything. The mac and cheese was a substantial brick. It definitely filled me up where the burger had failed, but it was just unimpressive. A rectangular chunk of mac and cheese sliced out of a pan with another cheese food slice on top of it? Not my idea of comfort food. As for my husband, he fared a little better, but not by much. His Cuban sandwich was...strange. A Cubano should generally just be ham, roast pork, cheese, pickles, and mustard. Simple and delicious. If you want to change it up, that's fine, but indicate that on the menu. The weirdest thing about the Club 185 \\"Cubano\\" was the flavor. There was some kind of spice or spice mix on it that neither of us could identify. It tasted maybe like Italian seasoning or one of the many spices in Italian seasoning. Basil? Thyme? We're still not sure, but it just wasn't right. As for the onion rings, he said they were just ok. Nothing special though nothing weird. Overall, the food wasn't horrible. But it wasn't very good. And to top it all off, we both had some intestinal worries that night and the next day. Nothing major, but enough to notice. So while we may be going back to Club 185 for the cheap drinks and to try the cocktails, we'll probably be skipping the food. Sigh, too bad. The place has a great vibe."},{"name":"Tropicana Cuban Restaurant","address":"9616 N Lamar Blvd, Ste 141","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Had the Cuban Sandwich today.

Not only is the food amazing, but it is amazingly consistent. I'm not one to spend a lot of money on dinner every night, so when I do I make sure it's top notch. At first, the menu is daunting. I didn't know what to get, mostly because the way it's written doesn't give you a completely clear idea as to what you'll get. But trust the chef! EVERYTHING is delicious.Ubiquitous Kale Salad - My favorite. It may sound boring, but don't forego it. I crave this in my sleep now! It's the only thing I have ordered all three times, the pistachio dressing really makes it wow-worthy.Charred Broccoli - Also amazing, it's a small pile of charred broccoli on a bed of squash hummus. This smooth hummus was the perfect compliment to the spice of the charred broccoli.Cauliflower Caponata - A few pieces of the most perfectly toasted bread with some kind of buttery sesame jam. The cauliflower was very garlicky, which I loved. Together? Perfection. Although I usually make it a rule to order new things with each new visit, I will order this from now on.Burrata - Good, very good, but very beet-y. Compared to the rest of the menu I felt this was lacking that wow-factor, but it was still delicious in it's own right.Mesquite Tortellini - Only 3 tortellini, but pretty good. Cheesy.Chicken Fried Rabbit - Very good, a small piece of succulent fried rabbit surrounded by celery and radish slices and blue cheese. Everything compliments the rabbit beautifully.Carbonara - I had high expectations for this because carbonara is generally my favorite thing in the world, and it was pretty good, but I wanted it to be more. Very salty and cheesy, which was fine because I love salt and cheese. Not enough pork belly for them to say it has pork belly, but I loved the soft egg on top. Solid.Pork Belly - Really good. I was expecting something more akin to bacon, like the bacon at West Bridge, but it was basically fatty pork (duh) which was perfectly paired with grits and strawberries. Steak Strip - Great, especially with the awesome toast they give you. I don't even like steak usually, but this was pretty darn good. I'd suggest getting it medium rare or medium, because medium well was just a little too much.Chocolate Bread Pudding - I love this, but I know other people who think it was just ok. I'm usually wary of bread puddings because as a professional baker I know it's just a sneaky way to use old bread, but this one's great. The only other desert is just a plate with cheese and chocolate, so the bread pudding is the way to go. I have a theory they use applewood smoked salt in it because it tastes kind of like bacon, and that brings out the chocolate flavor extremely well. The ice cream on top is essential. \\nTo recap: excellent. Their cocktails are always great, with good wine and beer selections as well. Their staff is over-the-top friendly and accommodating, and all very knowledgeable about the food. My water was always filled and food came out pretty quickly, it comes out as it's ready. The ambiance is warm yet modern and it always feels like a treat to eat there.  If you go in expecting huge portions you'll be disappointed, but if you go in with an open mind and looking to explore with your taste buds, you'll be more than happy.Also: I forgot my cell phone there last night and returned today hoping beyond hope that no one had taken it. Not only was it there, but they had charged it for me. That scores them extra points in my book."},{"name":"Masa","address":"439 Tremont St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Kelsey our waitress was phenomenal.

We got the pho, the beef and carrot stew and the Vietnamese coffee. The pho came with a bone marrow which I found was quite interesting. I loved all they presented the dish - i.e. the beansprouts and basils are in this \\"boat\\" with a \\"fisherman\\" beside it. It reminded me of the pictures I saw about Vietnam.

I really don't care for pickles but i am a huge fan of fried dill pickles.  I think it has something to do with the year and a half i lived in Mississippi growing up (which i usually don't admit).  They were very good.  The half order could feed a table of 5 easily.I really wanted to catfish special (it's so hard to find catfish done right in Atlanta), but they sold out right before we ordered (which also means I'm going back on a Monday), so I went with the barbeque standard pulled pork plate.  The pork does not come covered in sauce like it does in most places, and the meat was flavorful enough that it didn't really need it.  The sauce on the table was more of a vinegar based sauce (not a thicker tomato based one), which i'm also a fan of (Speaking of, does anyone know of a place to get good NC style bbq around here??).Fox Bros is some of the better barbeque I've had in awhile.

Of course, when you say \\"barbecue\\" in the South - and by South I don't mean Texas - it's pork. No question. Granted, we're not as famous as, say, North Carolina, but Georgia can give a lot of places a run for their money.Fat Matt's is one of those places. It's a tiny little hole-in-the wall, but don't let that fool you - often those places have the best food. The ribs are what you want here, no question. They are cooked to perfection every time, and the meat will just pull right off the bone. We ate them all and had just a pile of bones left and it was glorious. There wasn't a ton of smoke flavor, but the meat was so good it didn't even need their sauce, which is saying something.Speaking of sauce, it's pretty tangy and mustardy - more so than I usually like. No overly sweet stuff here. Strangely enough the last time I went I tried the \\"rum\\" beans and they tasted pretty much just like the sauce. So I'm not really sure where all the love goes for those. I didn't try the other sides because really it's all about the ribs. I don't do coleslaw anyway and I only like my Mom's potato salad (with my Mother-in-law's a close second) so I don't usually get it anywhere.If you go on the evening in weekends there will be live blues inside, and while that's great it can be pretty loud inside. They don't take tips on credit cards so remember that, and be prepared to have trouble parking. It can get crowded quickly so you may have to stand in line as well. Trust me - it's all worth it.

The croissant was delicious; I wish it was a bit bigger. The avocado toast was a bit salty but good. The corn pancakes were denser than I would have liked. For some reason our bacon never showed up and it took 20 min to get our coffees refilled. We ordered the scrambled eggs in the end since we didn't get full on only 3 dishes. Overall, I was into the food but the service left much to be desired. Seems I'm not the only one with this complaint. Perhaps the management should prioritize that.

They do have a bar menu and a dinning menu which you can order on either side. I must say their martini menu is one of the best around. I had an apple martini (average at best) but the mint girl scout cookie martini is amazing!! Comes in a martini glass drizzled with chocolate and a mint girl scout cookie floating in the middle with a tooth pick so it doesn't sink. Ordered the nachos appetizer which was amazing! The black beans were a nice touch. I am a bit picky when it comes to guacamole, and theirs is kind of bland. We were stuffed after the nachos but since we had allot of time to kill we went with more drinks and appetizers. Also had the cheese fondue, which came with ham, granny smith apples and bread. Can only comment on the apples (fresh) and bread (perfect) as I didn't try the ham, but I was told it was addicting! The fondue was nice and thick. The cheese was very pungent though, not sure what kind they used. Service was stellar! Our drinks were promptly refilled (like we finished a drink and another was in front of us) and our waitress/bartender was around constantly to ask if we needed anything or wanted anything else to eat.

Wanted something I couldn't get back home and this was recommended by hotel concierge. First of all - the menu looked amaze - wanted to try everything. The location was cute - homey but still extremely trendy.  Had the following: FRIED GREEN TOMATOES goat cheese, red pepper coulis - yummy but had some at our hotel the day before that outdid theirs.  LIVERS Benton's ham, caramelized onions, brioche, creamed corn, garlic jus - OMG - this was my FAVORITE dish from my entire stay in Atlanta.  I wish I could have taken it home with me.  People sometimes go for the safe - but hey - you only live once - go for those things that sound interesting and different and you may be pleasantly surprised.  For entree had to do the FRIED SPRINGER MOUNTAIN FARMS CHICKEN garlic collards, smashed red bliss potatoes, honey-thyme jus.  It was yummy - moist inside and crispy on the outside. I actually enjoyed the collards the best - perfectly seasoned. Would recommend the location again and again.

This place is definitely overrated especially when it comes to the amount of time spent for the food and experience. We ordered their  special chicken and waffles. We also got an order of the seafood grits, which is probably better than the chicken and waffles. The chicken was mainly just fried bits but the waffles was pumpkin spice flavored and quite nice.

Desert was a home made coconut and cantaloupe sorbet, which was really a blend of sorbet and granata but the perfect finish.  I am thrilled with the change and look forward to returning many times.  Waiter was attentive and helpful, atmosphere remains comfortably urban for a half hour or a two hour stay.

On the downside, they play music over a speaker in the dining room and it is a little loud.  While in an attempt to be charming, I'd rather have lower music and be able to hear my friend across the table.  My biggest issue was the food.  I ordered the fried chicken and when I cut into it, blood literally dripped out.  It was really underdone.  For something that is considered their specialty, I expected more.  2 out of 3 pieces of my chicken were severely under cooked.  Also, the skin was very salty.  The sides were ok.

The cashier recommended one of the Margherita pizzas for my picky daughter.  The smaller size Margherita and a larger Napoletana (a few types of cheese, sausage and broccoli) fed my family of 4 with teenage son and 10 year old daughter with no leftovers. The pizza was good although a bit on the pricey side since it was about $40 w/ tax and tip and we just drank water. Hubby and I both thought the crust end was a bit chewy/tough and could have been thinner and crisper. Enjoyed the condiment bar that had minced garlic and various olive oils.

Maybe they're also known for their long tables that can seat 10, but a little warning would have been nice before we were told the wait would be 20 minutes long. Things also start to get a bit confusing because at one point, it was hard to tell if the ketchup belonged to us or to the party next to us. Albacore Tuna Nicoise Benedict - $11 (3.75/7)\\nThis was definitely something different. In fact, too different for our liking. The corn muffin was way too dry and although the tuna was cut generously, it was kind of weird having two slices of thick tuna atop of corn muffin. Perhaps a weird combination? The entire dish was confusing and we had to pour hot sauce on it to make it more flavourful/less dry + confusing. Accompanied the benedict were hashbrowns. ... or were they just fries diced up into small hashbrown looking bits? The latter seems about right. Nevertheless, the hashbrown/fries were just okay. Corned Beef Hash - $11 (3.75/7)\\nAgain, confusing. The sauerkraut threw everything off .. just didn't blend well with the dish.

Let's see if I'm successful.  First- YES, it's definitely worth waiting in line for 4 hours.  So let's talk about that.  It's a thing...like people tailgate in line.  We arrived at 7:30 on a \\"slow\\" Saturday when it was 40 degrees out and raining, and there were already about 75 people in line (at least).  They had coolers, speakers, cards, blankets, etc.  Pretend like you are going to tailgate, except scale it back considering you won't have your car right beside you.  Also, bring camping chairs, umbrellas, whatever you need.  They do have some chairs and umbrellas to borrow, but they are limited, and there will be plenty of people who get there before you who don't do any online research (I guess because they don't have fingers or friends).  Oh!  And while you wait in line and drink yourself silly, you can access the bathrooms starting at 8am.Now let's get to the staff- SUPER friendly.  They come out and check on those in line.  They take drink orders.  They come by and ask about your meat order to make sure to let people know when they will be out of something, and they give you an idea of when you are likely to be eating.  Doors open at 11, so arriving at 7:30 put us in a position to eat by 12:45.  And I really don't know how the girl did it, but she was dead on.  Seating- once you get inside, it looks like there will never be enough room for everyone, but it cycles through pretty quickly, and aside from a few tables who looked like they thought they had a buyout, people were pretty considerate of the fact that there are others who would love to sit and eat hot fresh BBQ.  Food- TO DIE FOR.  I grew up in SC, and pulled pork is our thing, so I got the pulled pork sandwich with onions, pickles and slaw.  I took one bite and literally almost died in my chair.  At that moment I looked at my boyfriend and said \\"is there a way to embed a porn clip at the moment of orgasm into a Yelp review?\\"  So that sums that up.  I didn't even touch the BBQ sauce.  You seriously don't need to.  We also had the brisket (which my bf loved but I can't speak on because it's not my thing), sausage which was amazeballs, pork ribs, which, like the pulled pork, were also the best I have ever had.  And because we needed to be as fat as possible, we also had the potato salad (another winner) and pecan pie...also amazing.  Cost- Totally reasonable.  There were 3 of us, we spent $100 on way too much food, and finished our leftovers more than a day later.  You could easily try everything for much less, or focus on just a couple of meats instead of the entire farm like we did.In summary, we drove from Dallas, waited in line for 5 hours in the cold, and some of that time in the rain, and with the first bite declared that we would have waited twice as long.  I even said while we were waiting in line that if it was anything less than the best BBQ I had ever had, I was going to give it one star.  And here we are with 5 stars instead.  We will definitely be back!"},{"name":"The Wild Horse Cafe","address":"392 Cabot St","city":"Beverly","stars":"3.5","text":"I want to love this place, but the food always disappoints.

In fact back then I split my time between Hapa Izakaya and Guu with Garlic on Robson. I love both Hapa Izakayas (Robson and Yaletown locations) and was excited to hear that another Izakaya was opening close to my office  on West Cordova making it an optimal location for a work lunch. On the wettest, coldest, rainiest/snowiest day I made my way down to Hapa Umi wanting nothing more than something to warm me up. The venue is very clean and modern. In fact the Hapas are commonly referred to as the Japanese version of Cactus Club. Same service, similar clientele, just different food. The food was good although I myself prefer the other two locations. Perhaps it was the lunch menu but I was not a big fan of the Tempura Udon as it lacked in flavour. The sushi and my friend's Udon dish were both  good; however nothing that good to merit the price. Overall, it is a nice location for a work lunch if you are willing to spend more than the average for lunch. However, overall if I had to choose I would stick to the other Hapas preferring their menu and ambiance over Hapa Umi."},{"name":"The Reef","address":"4172 Main Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Really amazing and delicious food.

I ended up going with the vegetarian ramen, which is only offered for Sunday dinners, which is sort of weird in my opinion, but whatever floats your boat. I really enjoyed the toppings of brussel sprouts. The broth was quite tasty, but there was a lot left to be desired. Since I have had some really great ramen in NYC, I think I'm a little spoiled. Ramen Tatsu-Ya seemed to be a little basic compared to the bad boys I have had up in the northeast. Also the slider was quite disgusting.

The line is worth it and the servers are nice; but these days, expect a big crowd from the minute it opens, onward.The music isn't too loud and the environment is a small, chic, communal eatery. Prices are absolutely fair. They don't do takeout but you are welcome to bring your own tupperware container. Great food, fair prices. It's just really crowded.TIP: Get the Miso Ramen.

The popcorn shrimp's crust was also good- it definitely did not taste like the ones from KFC or applebee's. It was much better. The jambalaya I thought tasted similar to chinese fried rice. But maybe that is just my interpretation. From all the places, I've been to so far- the food was inexpensive and good. Good meaning that it tasted like a home cooked meal and not mediocre. The service was good too, the waiter kept coming around to ask if we needed anything. I guess the bad part is bringing it home and reheating it. The food definitely changed then lol.

We were seated in the back near the pool table, and as our group grew, the waiter would bring us more chairs.  Eventually we took over the whole back nook.I was starving when I arrived, so I ordered a turkey mushroom burger + the chips and hummus/guac.  The hummus and guac were average.  The chips were sub-average.  Honestly, they didn't taste all that fresh and I pushed them aside so that I wouldn't mindlessly eat the rest plain.  The highlight of my meal was the AMAZING BURGER.When you order, they don't ask how you want it done.  You don't do that here.  Please, please don't ask for your burger to be well done.  No.  Just don't.  Trust them to serve you a delicious, moist burger.  They bring it fast.  It is wrapped up in what I assume is their version of how In&Out wraps their burgers.  I can say that this was probably the best burger I've had in the Boston area.  I'm ashamed to say that because this is technically a fast food joint, but DAMN.  I was really really blown away by how delicious it was, and I scarfed it right down.The girl next to me go the nachos, and they were served over the same chips I got with hummus/guac.  I had a few of her remaining chips.... meh.  Again, the highlight here is obviously the BURGERS.  The nachos used that super fake tasting cheese sauce, and overall wasn't impressive.As more people joined our group, the waiter took individual orders and meals were delivered with lightening speed.  Some people ordered second and third items, and everything was brought correctly.  We ordered pitchers of Miller light, and those of us who got there early received icy cold beer mugs.  Late arrivals just got plastic cups.I'd definitely come back here if I'm craving a burger, but am more likely to return to the Harvard Square venue since it's closer to home.  YUM.

My Orecchiette dish had Italian Sausage, broccoli, and we were surprised how different the tomato sauces were in both dishes. Unike many restaurants that will use the same basic sauce for all dishes, the tomato sauces at Serafina's are spiced to fit the entree. Pleasing and delectable dining experience. Their selection of wines are more than fitting and complementary to their meals. You can ask the waiter for a recommendation or if you have a preference, ask for it.

It is a great place to hang out with friends. My friend and I were greeted by a very nice server, who made great recommendations and served us incredibly well throughout the meal! The food is here pretty basic not to mean it's not good. I ordered a fried chicken plate and it was not bad at all. I enjoyed the breading however sometimes the chicken came out a bit dry. The fries were a bit meh but I mean this place doesn't focus 100% on food. The sauce it paired with was really good however can't recall what it exactly was. The food was pretty average in my case, but my friend thoroughly enjoyed her plate. The price was OK, but given the location, it was definitely not the worst. I didn't experience the bar that much, however the wines here are definitely not extremely expensive. My friend and I ordered an entire bottle of white from Italy for less than 30. The server was very kind enough to help us get a bucket of ice for it! What's great about this place is that the food isn't bad at all and the drink prices are definitely not pushing it. It's quite a big venue but still pretty popular. I enjoyed the ambience and the fact it wasn't too loud to have a good conversation.

I've had their food before at a wedding and it was terrible, but I understand it was under different management back then. I heard it's more of a Szechuan style restaurant now and the chef was supposed to be good, so I wanted to try it. The servers were really really nice, but the food left much to be desired. They gave us hot and sour soup and vegetable spring rolls for free which were good. Not fantastic, but good. For entrees we ordered the cumin lamb, spicy boiled beef, eggplant with garlic sauce and general sao's chicken. The lamb was kind of chewy and while the flavor was good it was apparent the quality of the meat wasn't the best. The eggplant was my favorite out of the entrees, but the skin was very tough and hard to chew. After we ate they gave us this green tea soup for free for dessert. It was very watery and bland. I barely took one bite of it. Overall, I was very disappointing with the quality and flavor of the food even though the service was very good.

The place was packed but the kitchen looks large enough to be able to accommodate the amount of tables in the place. They sure know what their doing when it comes putting incredibly yummy meals together and the service was sufficient enough.

The upstairs & downstairs dining rooms are ginormous, so getting a table on a weekend is no problem.  You won't be disappointed by the staple selection you would find at just about any dim sum restaurant.  The steamer carts are free-wheeling and if you don't know what's in those bamboo baskets, point, ask and try it anyway.  It's a small dish to sample and if you don't like it, I'll eat it!    Dim sum means ordering to your heart's content, so go for anything that catches your eye.You can't go wrong with the standards like siu mai (pork dumpling), har gao (translucent shrimp dumpling), cheong fun (beef or shrimp rice rolls).  The dumplings are definitely larger than what you would get in NYC and taste is comparable.  One of our other favorites is authentic jewel chicken sticky rice in lotus leaf and it's very good here and a fair size to share.  A service practice I haven't seen before is the fried food cart comes with a whole variety of items (at least 5-6 types of sweet & savory) that you can mix on the same plate, which is great to sample if you're alone or just a pair.If you tire of the carts, you can also order noodle dishes from the kitchen.  Try the Jah Leong (breadstick cruller in rice roll).  We saw giant plates of them go by, but the server says they were individually ordered.  Not to be outdone,we got our own plate.  We also ordered the seafood chow mein (crispy thin noodles).  The noodles & sauce had good flavor, but the seafood was a little skimpy, with small shrimp, fish fillet and small bits of squid.  I'm used to seeing jumbo shrimp, scallops and large squid, but for $8.95, I can't complain too much.  Even though we ordered a ton of food and rubbed our bellies in satisfaction, the total bill only came to $50.

Checked in for a party of 2 and waited 50 mins.  There were 26 parties ahead of us and we opted for first available.8:45 rolls around and we get outdoor patio seating.The place was packed and that was a good sign.We ordered cheesy taters, two 2 item combos consisting of ribs, wings, and chopped brisket (sliced brisket was sold out), jalape√±o bread, Mac n cheese, and collard greens and a Dr Pepper cake.I had a beer, the white ale.The taters came out piping hot and the order was huge. They were fried and didn't taste like they used old oil to fry them which was a good sign. The pimento cheese was good and this dish was filling in itself and could easily feed 4 people.The beer I had ordered was on the warm side. By the time I started eating, it came to room or ambient temperature which was disappointing.The utensils on our table were dirty, like the dishwasher or the person in charge of washing them did a horrible job where food bits were still stuck on the utensils. Which is a big sign of poor quality control. We asked for new utensils and thankfully these were clean.The main entree came out and I dove into this first. The Mac and cheese was cooked perfectly but was a little dull in flavor. A little saltiness would have done wonders. The collard greens were very good, crisp greens, lots of flavor and a kick of heat.The ribs were very juicy and moist, but the flavor was lacking. There was none actually. I had to use the bbq sauce to compliment the ribs, which was disappointing given all the fantastic reviews.The chopped brisket had no flavor either.  Did they suddenly run out of spices and rub that their meat suddenly lost all flavor? The brisket was cold with no depth or flavor, disappointing.The wings were very juicy and hot, and this was probably the highlight, but one can get wings anywhere.The corn bread was good, but didn't have any signs of jalape√±o. It was warm and moist however.The cake was good.Overall, I'm not sure what the hype is all about. Perhaps it was a bad batch of unflavored meat?

Yummm!Along with the escargot, I also ordered the scallop crudo. ERMAGHERD. It is so freaking good. I perfect bited that entire dish. The waiter who came by and handed me a spoon...you were right. The broth was killer! It was the perfect marriage of flavors. The bok choy was cooked to the right crunch for texture and really brought the whole dish together. Lastly, I ordered the beets...kind of disappointed. The description in the menu sounds really adventurous and I was looking forward to it. I think the problem was that the chevre was pretty mild and the jalapeno wasn't too present. The focus was too much on a pretty plate and less on melding the flavors. The beets were cut too largely so it ended up really overpowering the other flavors. There wasn't much of a chocolate presence either. It was more disappointing because I ate it after the scallop crudo. My boyfriend ordered the bolognese and his comments were that the dish was good but not impressive.

They have happy hour from 3 to 8pm.  Which is amazing for people who work later than 5 pm during the week.  I have almost always had friendly and quick service from the bar.  Of course sometimes there are crowds and you may have to wait.  That shouldn't be a problem if you have an ounce of patience in your body.  The food is made to order and extremely reasonable prices.  You walk up to a window, order for yourself, and then wait for your name to be called.  I'd rather do that than wait for a slow server on a packed and busy night.  Therefore, I'm really a fan of the setup. It definitely has the unique, kind of college, dive bar feel.  I'm in my 30s, as our my friends, and we love the Darkhorse."},{"name":"Fox Bros.

The environment of the place is divey and it's got lots of character to it.  Parking here is ok so long as your willing to park in front of some house down the road. I came here at 4:30 on a Saturday and it was so packed! I was so surprised. My friend and I were super hungover and finally were able to think about food around 3. We decided BBQ is what sounded good so off we went. I thought the place would be empty because it's not lunch or dinner time yet really...But whatever!  Luckily it was just the two of us and we were starving and had no preference of inside or out so we were seated inside right away. Food: we thought we were starving and could demolish a ton of food. So us two girls ordered half a rack of spare ribs to split and then our own pulled pork sandwich with Mac n cheese each. The ribs were phenomenal. Absolutely fantastic. 5 stars for the ribs. I'm salivating thinking about them right now. The sandwich was very good as well - however I am more of a vinegar bbq base girl so I wasn't crazy about the bbq sauce. The mac n cheese was ok.    Needless to say, it was a ton of food and we both could only eat half our sandwich and maybe a bite or two of the mac n cheese.The sandwich was OK a few hours later... except since they don't use high quality buns it got pretty soggy.  To counter that though - the meat was just as tasty and to be honest - people eat BBQ for the meat!I would certainly come back here."},{"name":"Christopher's","address":"1920 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"This place gets me.

What's a girl to do? Hunker down, place an order, and hope that the fungus flavor does not pervade the entire dish. The result? Pleasant surprise!I sampled the clam chowder, which was fantastic--nice thickness, not too potatoey, with the addition of bacony goodness, For an entree, I took a risk with the crab-stuffed cod--explicit mention of fungus = risky! What arrived was delicious with some additions that were not mentioned on the menu--the cod was nicely cooked, moist and delicious; the rock crab was tasty, but being an MD snob, nothing can compete with blue; this atop appropriately crunchy asparagus and a kind of sundried kind of not tomato that had a fantastic, intense tomato flavor; finished off with some super tasty truffle mashed potatoes and a delectable champagne cream. This dish was fantastic and I had to resist the urge to empty the bread basket and sop up all of the deliciousness from my plate. A girl needs to keep up some decorum in front of the coworkers.Others at the table had a delicious-looking steak, a nice caesar salad, and the seafood stew--messy with it's half lobster, but looked fantastic. All were satisfied with their meals.Food is a bit pricey, but portions are large. I was too full for dessert, but liked that they offered some $3 dessert \\"bites\\" in addition to their full-sized desserts. I have no idea how big these are, but it is nice to have a small option if you just want a taste of sweetness at the end of your meal or want to try a few things. Coffee was quite delicious.Reasonably priced wines. A glance at the cocktail menu suggests that things are more creative down the hall at Dante.Ambiance is funky, but chill.

If you don't care about the quality of your food, then just go to cracker barril. They need to be more accommodating to vegetarian's.

It was okay, but at that point I wasn't entirely hungry anymore.So my friends offered me their own reviews of their food- one said her food was tasty but the bread (served with a dish of cheese tortellini) was hard as a rock, another said her shrimp salad was also good, except the croutons looked and tasted more like a piece of overly fried tofu, and my new British friend had no complaints about his steak, except that he doesn't understand why, in America, when you say you want your steak rare, it comes well-done.  But he cleaned his plate so I think he was satisfied with his meal.  But no one complained about the hummus and pita bread!This place has always been good for a first date situation, or for friends to get together and drink some lovely wines from their extensive menu and share appetizers and amazing desserts.  But, I will say this (in order for first date, first time patrons not to look like an ass trying to find the place) it is behind Trader Joe's on Monroe, just drive down the street to the right of the Trader Joe's parking lot and you will see it on the first floor of a two-story shopping center."},{"name":"Papa G's Vegan Organics","address":"2314 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"When I first moved to Portland, Papa G's was a new discovery and a staple in my dining out excursions. It's a small vegan \\"deli\\" with a hot food bar (dished out by staff), self-serve salad and soup bar, and a small selection of raw and cooked menu items. The modest organic salad bar usually has some decent offerings but it can get expensive really easily. They used to have four soup offerings per day and lately it's been two, I presume because too much was going to waste. Typical offerings at the hot food bar include: millet loaf (more like a crumbly mess than a loaf), mashed potatoes (2 kids of gravy - ginger and mushroom), coconut greens, mashed yams (the consistency of baby food), macaroni and cheese (not so good), and tofu vegetable curry. You can order an organic bowl (1 entree + 1 side) or an organic plate (2 entrees + 1 side). The hot bar can really vary in quality. I've found that it's best at lunchtime when the food is fresh. I'm not sure how often they discard and replace the items on the hot bar, but my worst experiences have been after 6:30PM. My favorite items are generally the mashed potatoes and gravy or the curry. In all honesty, the food is really nothing to write home about, but Papa G's is a good stop for a quick lunch when I'm on the road for work. And I like to support the vegan little guys. If you're unsure about what to order from the hot bar, they will give you a sample bite if you ask for a taste."},{"name":"Hei La Moon","address":"88 Beach St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Dim sum too salty to me.

The first problem is the entrees came out in two different waves. So half of our party received their meals 15 - 20 minutes prior to the rest of the party. To make things worse, one of the meals that arrived in the second wave was incorrect. This resulted in another 30-35 minutes of inconvenience for one of our guests. All the while we're still waiting for drinks and an extra plate to cut up the two young kid's entrees (which is now cold) for them. We actually had to go find a plate ourselves! We spoke with the manager and he didn't seem to care much about how poorly the experience was going. He did comp a couple items, but the overall feeling that we got from the manager and our \\"waitress\\" was that they did not care about the customer or the quality of service. I explained that it wasn't about the money, and that We're were there for the experience and service. This resulted in no apology or improvement in service level, in fact service got worse. The manager and waitress made it clear that we were an inconvenience. Check ins and drink refills happened maybe twice during our 2.5 our visit. When she did return she smelled of smoke and just seemed not interested in the task at hand. Note, there were only two other couples in the entire restaurant during our time here. It's frustrating because I work in hospitality and I know this service does not align with company. It's frustrating to visit family and take them to an establishment that has consistently delivered exceptional service and have this sort of service breakdown and general disregard for customer experience.

That's fine, let 'em drive to Driftwood and leave Stubb's for the rest of us.I've been to Austin on business a couple times this past month, and have been looking for the best barbecue place around - as I like to do when traveling to a traditional barbecue region.  I was hoping to find a bit of barbecue heaven Texas-style.  Which means brisket.  If you want ribs go to Kansas City, pulled pork go to North Carolina.On my first trip to Austin I made the pilgrimage to Driftwood, to sample The Salt Lick.  My impression?  Frickin' feed lot.  The brisket was bland, tough, and dry.  Couldn't taste any smoke or any rub.  Had to sauce it heavily just to choke it down, and there was nothing to savor about it.  I ordered the four-meat plate.  Same story all around: absolutely nothing distinctive about any of the fare there, except for its surprising mediocrity (sides included).  Plus I'd like to just order a damned beer from the damned waitress instead of hassling with buying and bringing my own.  Ambiance?  Remote, dusty, crowded, loud, busy, and more gross than rustic.  Like I said, feed lot.  Moo.  Only worth the two-hour roundtrip drive to buy a T-shirt and conclude once is enough.So this visit I went to Rudy's one night, and Stubb's the next.  Now that's more like it.  At Stubb's I could see a thick red smoke ring under a dark crust of rub bark, and smell the smoke as the first bite of brisket moved into my mouth.  The taste followed suit: pleasantly smoky, just salty and peppery enough, and oh-so-flavorful.  Lean but not dry, the texture was pull-apart tender from silverware to stomach.  The brisket at Rudy's was even better - not quite smoky enough, but had more zing to the rub, you could choose your fat content (I ordered extra-moist, of course), and the half-pound portion was twice bigger than on the two-meat plate at Stubb's.But for my money Stubb's is the overall best, taking everything else into consideration.  The sausage at Stubb's has spicier taste, more appealing composition, and less tough casing than at Rudy's, though neither place cooks it as done as I like.  Cornbread at Stubb's vs. stacks of store-bought white bread at Rudy's (WTF?).  Sides of fried okra, and collard greens with onions and bacon, vs. creamed corn and barbecue beans (those last two are very good at Rudy's, but come on - we're talkin' soul food at Stubb's).  Plus at Stubb's they serve a side plate of pickles and onions and peppers - nice touch.  An old downtown building with true character and proper furniture and wait staff versus a faux roadhouse / gas station by a freeway with picnic tables where you zig-zag in line to order from a cashier.  Actual ceramic plates and bowls, and metal utensils, vs. plastic crates and wax paper and plasticware.  Good service from down-to-earth folks vs. cheesy corporate-procedure greeting dialogues and kitchen rituals.  Stubb's strikes the right balance for authentic barbecue place dinner atmosphere: far from foo-foo like Lamberts, but a cut above \\"cafeteria\\" c.f. Rudy's or The Salt Lick, and two cuts above towed trailer on gravel lot like the top-rated (presumably food-wise) joints.  One-of-a-kind restaurant with genuine history behind it, including gigs by famous blues musicians, versus cookie-cutter franchise with locations all over town, trying to fake up some Texas ambiance.Of course I know that \\"best\\" is in the eye of the beholder, and it's a fair question to ask, \\"WTF does this guy know about it anyway?\\"  While I've never barbecued competitively, I've smoked for a lot of people on my Big Green Egg in recent years, and have seriously studied the traditions of barbecue, and been told many times I should compete - but that would take the fun out of it.  For me, Stubb's is the real deal.  I don't need to look any further in Austin, and will be coming back to Stubb's when I'm here."},{"name":"Bandini Pizza & Pasta","address":"3107 N Lombard St","city":"Portland","stars":"3","text":"Not like it used to be.

The ceviche was rich with loads of fish, onions, tomatoes and a bite under the lime that may have been the particular hot sauce used but whatever it was - nice choice. Whatever \\"taco\\" we picked was flavoured just right and we tried the fish, the chicken, the vegetarian and a pork one. The guacamole was fresh and the salsa hit the mark.

The food that I had was okay - made well but nothing too special.  No super interesting flavors or new combinations of food.  For $21 for a piece of chicken, I was kind of bummed that there wasn't something to make me excited about the food.  But it was really the service that killed the night for me.  Granted we had a big party (co-worker's birthday).  But still, we were seated at 8:45 and then ignored for a good 20 min.  I was STARVING and we didn't get drinks/bread until 9:30.  And I had to ask for bread, it wasn't just given to us.  Our waitress may have been stretched a little thin, but we pretty much got our food right before the kitchen closed at 10:45.  There were tables that were seated and left before we finished our night there.  And the sangria wasn't up to par either.  It tasted more like a fruity mixed drink w/ rum.  I don't think it was made with wine....Regardless, I'll go back for their happy hour.  Seems like a better choice for Masa.  Decor is cute though - it would be a nice place for a date.*edit*\\nHappy hour deal was disappointing too =( Some of the tapas were okay, but many of them seemed like they were pre-processed frozen h'or deurves put on a fancy plate.

To begin with, we were immediately somewhat off put by the price of the pizza, but that wasn't that big of a deal. The girl and the food counter was friendly, so that was a plus. After we ordered our pizza and mozzarella sticks, we decided to go to the bowling counter to get a lane.     The girl at the bowling counter obviously did not want to be there. She was over the top rude, and was not helpful at all. We got our lane, which was full of people at the time and we had to ask them to move, and move all of their stuff and food as well. The bowling at least was a lot of fun, with good music playing. We bowled a few games, and realized that our pizza was still not there.     I went to the food counter again, and waited for several minutes before anybody came to assist me. I could see my pizza sitting in the kitchen, and could also see a handful of staff standing around in the back talking. I was annoyed that it was just getting cold for no reason. When the girl came out, I was told that they were waiting on my mozzarella sticks so that they could bring them out at the same time, and that was why the pizza was sitting there, which makes no sense. The mozzarella sticks were cold anyways and I returned them.     Two stars for pretty good pizza, and good bowling."},{"name":"Franklin Barbecue","address":"900 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"The one time I went with a friend the line was just inside.

I went for brunch (3 of us), and we had six dishes. My personal favorite dish was the smoky cheese grits, however everything we ordered was delicious. The ubiquitous kale salad was unusual for its roasted kale chips as a crouton-like topping; the secret burger (with the egg) was gooey, crusty and a bit messy to share with others. Benne crusted green tomatoes were delicious, however it was mostly crust  - I couldn't taste or see the tomatoes. Don't mistake that as a complaint- it was a light, crispy treat. Dave's sausage and potato skillet was hearty and plate-licking good. The house-made carbonara was meaty, buttery and felt sinful to eat. Attentive, informed service. I appreciate the attention to detail throughout the whole experience. Very cool ambiance, my favorite design elements were the reclaimed wood throughout and live succulents on tables and windowsills. I was skeptical of the tapas-style menu at first, however when it comes to brunch it was really awesome to have family style service and have the opportunity to sample so much of the menu.

We had chicken and waffles, which were awesome, and the biscuit and gravy. By far one of the top five on my list for this dish. We sat at the bar because there was a hour wait for the dinning room and the service was excellent and friendly. Only pet peeve for this place if I had to pick something to complain about - there was a very long wait, but there were about half the tables completely empty. We asked why no one was being seated in all the free space and we were told that these tables were reserved. Having said that at least half the \\"reserved\\" tables remained empty the entire time we were there, which was over an hour.

With so much hype, you are bound to be disappointed by something...unless you are eating at Franklin BBQ in Austin, TX.We brilliantly decided the day before Father's Day to go try it out...my mother, wife, and 3 month old daughter tagged along.  We brought a cooler of beer and water and folding chairs after parking on Juniper Street.  Turns out, all we really needed was some water - we tried the coffee at Legend Coffee Co. behind Franklins and it was delish.We arrived at 7:00am and eventually got our food at 12:00pm noon.  Around 8:00am staff walked along the line and provided information about estimated wait time depending on our position in line (consistently accurate) and inquired about our desired amount of meat so they could estimate at which point in the line they would run out of meat.  The last person in line gets a sign that says \\"Last Man Standing\\".  Everyone behind them is only guaranteed a long wait and nothing else.  At this time, they also open the doors for people to use the restrooms, etc. You can bet on waiting at least 5 hours regardless of when you show up.  On a good slow day (usually Tuesday or Wednesday), if you arrive at 9:30am, you'll likely still wait 4-5 hours and may not be guaranteed any meat, still.  The first 30 or so people in line today arrived between 5:30 and 6:00am and we're served within the first 30 minutes after opening at 11:00am.If you're impatient, there are rules and limitations for alternatives...which include ordering in advance, online first come, first serve on Monday mornings at 9:00am.  You might have better luck winning the lottery.  You may also buy a cold brisket to go, though you may still have to wait in line.  OR, if the kid is still doing this when you FINALLY treat yourself to easily the best meat you've never eaten in your life, you might pay extra for BBQ Fast Pass...look him up on Twitter or his website, http://www.bbqfastpass.com/.Part of the quality, that goes vastly underrated is Franklin BBQ's attention to customer service. Every staff member was friendly and helpful with even the dumbest questions.  Part of what takes so long is their undivided attention to each customer that is standing in front of them - they treat their customers like they their meat - with great care, effort, and lots of time... especially if you get your meat cut by Aaron Franklin himself - loves to hear where his customers are from and wants to ensure your experience is enjoyable.WHY ARE YOU STILL READING THESE REVIEWS?!?!

Ordered the Maryland crab cake salad which arrived with a greasy crab cake that was more breading than crab.  It was placed upon a bed of mixed greens with some pesto that had not been processed all the way as it was stringy and unpleasant tasting.

That's a lot for me. I could choose from a huge list of toppings, which included mushrooms (which my friend got on hers) but I kept mine pretty basic. I did ask for BBQ sauce (which was on the board) on the side and I added that to my burger and it was fantastic.In fact, the burger was good all the way around. Lots of pickles and tomatoes, plus the two patties that were cooked almost to perfection. I wish they had stuck to mayo on just one side of the burger (they put it on both the top and the bottom), but that was still okay. They didn't use too much. We shared a large order of fries. They were pretty good, but I think they were oversalted. I was having to tap a little bit of the salt off of them as I ate them. But they were still very good.We also got to start peanuts that they had in the restaurant. So we got a full meal. The small and regular burger, plus a soda and a bottled water cost just under $20.
