The first thing I tried was of course the soup, and it's certainly tasteful. It's not just clear soup with MSG that I often came across from Chinese restaurants that are ripping westerners off, but this was likely to have been prepared with long boiling of bacon chips, as I can detect the aroma coming through the soup. The thin noodle was tangled too tightly together, and tasted a bit stiff in the beginning. But after soaking in the soup for a few minutes, it got better. The BBQ pork had some streaks of fat, which made it succulent, if you are not too health conscious, and the portion was not stingy for CAD6.

Let's chat about Sushi Katana! What an awesome choice this was. We were headed out to watch the games and sushi was the only thing that felt right. Looking for a new sushi spot I called over to Sushi Katana to see if they were, 1 - busy, and 2 - had televisions. To my delight they had plenty of tables and multiple TVs. \\n\\nLocation - Although SK is incredibly welcoming on the inside - very tastefully done! The location is not incredibly desirable. It's in the midst of Millenia's highest traffic Conroy/Millenia Blvd. My suggestion - take a deep breath and you'll be there before you know it. It's totally worth the momentary road rage. ANDDD its right next door to Keke's Breakfast Caf√©! Can you say perfection!?\\n\\nVenue - The interior isn't overly large, but large enough. Intimate for sure. Plenty of two-tops are available, a high-top bar and even a cute leather sofa set that can seat up to 4. Talk about luxury. The seats are comfy and the set up makes you feel like you still have a little privacy while out in the open. I really like this place.\\n\\nService - Our server moved our drink order along relatively quickly but I could tell she got overwhelmed quickly with multiple tables. It took her forever to come back to us and it seemed like she started taking orders for guests seated after us first. She eventually made her way back to us, so no biggie.\\n\\nFood - SK is super awesome because they have a huge sushi menu. Options for even the pickiest eater. We ordered the Lava Roll, Shrimp Tempura Roll, Sampler Trio, Spring Rolls, and Seaweed Salad.\\nThis was my first time tasting Seaweed Salad and I was totally impressed. I've been missing out all this time! The salad was a perfect mix of juicy tenderness with a crispy crunch. The flavor had a hint of soy sauce, being it was my first time I didn't know what its supposed to taste like so feel free to give me feedback.\\nThe sampler trio was very nicely presented and appeared to be fried to perfection. I didn't taste any but I was told the meat was tender and filled with flavor and the spring rolls and pot stickers were cooked just right.\\nMy lava roll was a little bit of a disappointment. It was your typical California roll topped with baked spicy scallops. I wasn't overly impressed with the presentation as the scallops could have been baked a bit more, they appeared to be lightly saut√©ed and tossed in the spicy sauce but it lacked any baked texture. SK's Lava Roll is very similar to RanGetsu's Volcano Roll. I have yet to find a Lava/Volcano-esk roll to top RanGetsu's. Nonetheless it was edible. I wouldn't order it again though.\\n\\nOverall - Incredibly desirable venue, alright service, very fresh sushi. I will certainly be back!

The stuffed mushroom was bland, the calamari wasn't fresh (but it IS Columbus so thats understandable) and the fried mozzarella was a tad dry. The entree was decent - extremely fresh shrimp (Yum!!) but the linguine was stuck together and undercooked. The layout of the restaurant was pretty confusing too - I circled the restaurant twice trying to get from the restroom back to my table. \\n\\nOVERALL: I may return but will likely prefer other Italian restaurants. Not making pasta right is a rookie mistake for an Italian restaurant."},{"name":"Applebee's","address":"130 Perimeter Center Pl NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"2","text":"Went again on a friday night, and the service was much better this time around.

Entirely likely.\\n\\n\\"Curbside\\" specializes in dishing out chicken wings and sandwiches, with a bevy of fried accompaniments (fries, tots, onion rings, etc). Oh and salads too (funny that I'd forget the healthful stuff).

On my wishlist are Mac N Cheese (something they're passionate about, but still figuring out how to serve perfectly) and Fried Chicken (I can't even think of a good place to get some in our neighborhood). \\n\\nBut back to the sauce or sauces. This isn't some bottled mass produced muck. Both the BBQ sauce and the Hot wing sauce have hours of testing and tweaking put into them.

I dream about sandwiches every night and think about them every day upon waking. I want to eat sandwiches for every meal. I'm not terribly picky about my sandwiches in general, because if I want a sandwich, I want a sandwich. I am not a snob. \\n\\nHowever, I expect things to live up to their price and hype. If I'm eating a $5 foot long at Subway, I'm not expecting much. If I get a $2 sandwich at a gas station, I know what I'm in for and I'm totally cool with it. If I'm going to pay $8-9 for a small sandwich at a place that has as much hype as Bunk, I'm going to expect something delicious. What I got was not just mediocre, it was straight up disappointing. Still, it could've been an off day, so I gave it three more chances. \\n\\nThe first time I went, I got the Meatball Parmigiano Hero. I love me a meatball sandwich. I was excited. The cheese was stuck to the paper they had wrapped over the top and I couldn't get it off. The bread was slightly burnt and the sauce was spicy. I like spicy, and it wasn't the kind of spicy that makes your nose run, but it overpowered the sandwich. It was the only real flavor. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't worth the price or the hype. It tore up the roof of my mouth like a piece of frozen pizza and tasted about as good. It was a $4.50 sandwich, at best. \\n\\nThe second time, I got the Pork Belly Cubano. I expected it to be fatty and as a fatty, I like fatty. This was more fat than pork. No, seriously, I had a big giant chunk of fat in my sandwich. The little bit of actual pork that I could find was good, but the ham was much too salty. I loved the bread and it was toasted perfectly. It was still a tasty sandwich and (obviously) melted in my mouth, but again, not worth the price or the hype. It wasn't a huge sandwich and I'm a big lady, but I couldn't finish it. All of the fat and salt had me feeling queasy. It was a $5 sandwich. \\n\\nThinking that might have been a fluke, I got the Pork Belly Cubano again on my third visit. Nope. Not as big of a chunk of fat, but still a $5 sandwich. I much preferred the Hammer & Pickle at The People's Sandwich, who are unfortunately now closed. \\n\\nOn my fourth and final visit, I got the Pulled Pork. I couldn't imagine how they could go wrong as it's such a simple and popular sandwich. The pork was shredded to the degree that it resembled canned tuna. In fact, it tasted more like a tuna sandwich than pork, possibly due to the apple cabbage slaw. It was shockingly bland, with zero pork flavor coming through. I was so disappointed, I nearly wept. I had worked up this hunger for some great pulled pork, and I got a pile of slop on a poppy seed dinner roll. It was also difficult to eat as the texture of the roll is too hard and chewy for its messy fillings. This was a $3 sandwich.\\n\\nI am left wondering if all of these people who are giving this place such glowing reviews have ever actually eaten a quality sandwich before. Sometimes I feel like hype begets hype. The next time I want a good quality sandwich, I'm going to Built to Grill, Tabor or Portland Soup Co. \\n\\nI will say that the employee (it was always the same cute gal taking my order) was really nice and friendly and the food came quick. Maybe too quick, and that's the problem.

The server says that he will wait before putting in our order for the mains so that we can have the oysters as appetizers. You guessed it, the mains showed up before the oysters.

My chicken fried beef tenderloin in a green tomatillo sauce was only surpassed by the bacon ranch mashed potatoes it sat upon. We're talking some kind of good here! The shrimp was good, too.

Complete waste of time and money.  All three courses were really bad.  Salad: modern caesar, the fried capers is quite brilliant,  but it was way way over dressed. The dressing was awful and too acidic, too much parm, and wilted lettuce.  Entree: crab stuffed shrimp and fillet. The shrimp was so over cooked that I couldn't even pull the meat from the tail. The crab stuffing tasted pre-made and sat for way too long.  The steak didn't even look like a fillet.  One never seen a fillet that looked like that.  It was shaped like a sirloin, and had a second part of the meat rather than one solid cylinder shape.  The funniest thing is that two had medium and two had rare.  The two rare were literally twice the thickness of the medium.  The cooks are so bad that they just time them,  and can't cook the same thickness to different doness. There was no seasoning which you have to have especially since its cooked in a salamander not over a flame or in a pan. Seriously,  no sear, no crust, almost no salt,  just a bland piece of mush for $30. Easily the worst fillet I ever had.  Easily.  Desert: chocolate molten cake.  Bad.  Really really bad.  It was cold, over cooked,  and grainy middle.  Had to be from a box.  Of they made it there, I'd be embarrassed.  In the end, the service was good and that was it.  They advertise as a high end streak house.  They look the part, but the food can't deliver.  They act as if they have chefs preparing the food,  but they are line cooks at best.

The presentation and flavors will leave a persisting impression that will linger in the best way imaginable. For the entr√©e, I recommend the pork porterhouse. Presentation: intimidating. Price: on the higher end. Nevertheless, it is a must have. An experience in itself, which keeps my burning desire to return ever ablaze. I will say that out of all the pork I have experienced in my life, this steak is the very best. Juicy, tender, high quality meat packed with natural flavor. Cooked to absolute velvety medium-rare perfection. \\n\\nDrinks. \\nThe Ravenous Pig's cocktails are astonishingly complex and worth returning for time after time.

Pork Onigiri - great flavor, but was a little lacking in the pork filling. I know Onigiri is mostly rice and seaweed to begin with, but I felt this was less filling than I've had at other places.\\n2.) Gyoza - These were fabulous. Perfectly balanced with crisp and chewiness, they were a real delight.\\n3.) Sashimi Platter - I was a little apprehensive on this one as this isn't a sushi place, but decided to try it anyways. While most of the fish tasted alright, it was clear that the salmon wasnt sliced with the same precision and care I get at other sushi places. Additionally, the sashimi slices were entirely too thick which took away from enjoying the flavor of the fish. The fish itself was also a little too chewy for my boujee tastes.\\n\\nAll in all I give Yebisuya 4/5 stars because their main dishes - the ramen - are always solid - not the best I've ever had, but good enough to satisfy a ramen craving.

The ambience of the restaurant is much closer to that of a nightclub than a typical restaurant: very dimly lit and heavy, dark materials. It would definitely be a great place to have drinks after work and stay until the nightlife gets started, but for a Sunday lunch, it seemed odd. Almost no windows in the restaurant kept us from taking pics, or enjoying any type of view. We ordered two burgers, one prime rib grilled cheese, and one Caesar salad. The patties for the burgers arrived, but both were cooked medium rare instead of 1 medium and 1 medium rare. After alerting the waitress, she returned the undercooked burger. When she returned, the staff had merely re-cooked the originally patty, so it was dried out, and left it on the same bun (which was at this point a soggy mess), and by this time, everyone else was almost done with their meals. \\n\\nIdeally, they would have not messed the order up in the first place, but at the very least they could have completely replaced the patty and bun as soon as possible, instead of bringing back a re-heated original patty and soggy bun.

Food quality and consistency has always been good and meals here never disappoint. \\n\\nAvoid prime lunch and dinner time as it is hard to get a table and service will be lacking. Best time to come is between 2:00 to 5:00 pm, when you can easily walk in and get a table. Also, even at it's best, service will seem rude and unattentive for those who are not used to dining in Asia. Service is similar to those  found at HK cafes  Decor is also dated and could use a refresh. \\n\\nIf you like authentic Shanghainese food, then this is the place for you. Stick with the classics like xiao long bao, pan fried pork buns and noodle dishes. Their xiao long bao consists of paper thin skin (a good thing) that wraps around succulent tender pork meat and a large pool of perfectly seasoned and balanced broth. Another must order item is the pan dried pork buns. The top part of bun is soft and moist while the bottom part is perfectly friend and toasty. Expect the same explosive experience as the xiao long bao when you bite into the bun. Both dishes come with 6 pieces and are perfectly sized.\\n\\nOne main reason I had to deduct a star is because not all of their dishes offered (and they offer a lot on their menu) are good.

Five Horses has a very good selection of quality beers on tap. Their cocktails are also interesting (note they only stock cordials for now which they use in their mixed drinks). It's generally a good bar/restaurant to go to in the neighborhood with very friendly staff.\\n\\nFood-wise, the menu is hit or miss for me. I like their unique take on comfort foods - almost everything on the menu has an interesting twist but while their dish concepts are great, they don't always translate into a tasty meal. \\n\\nThe good: \\n\\nThe Brie is a fantastic appetizer that comes with delicious crostinis, topped lightly with a pesto spread and a drizzle of balsamic vinegar (which they seem to love at this restaurant as their extra virgin balsamic vinegar is featured in a lot of their dishes and even in some of their drinks - try the bellinis if you go for brunch). The short rib (spicy) and pulled pork tacos are excellent and you can't go wrong with the Hanger steak. The fried shrimp on arugula appetizer is quite good too.\\n\\nThe not so good: \\n\\nOf what I have tried, their mac 'n cheese is bland and so are the tuna and potato tacos. If you go for brunch, I would avoid the corned beef hash because it is extremely chewy (thier eggs benedict looked great though). The longhorn foghorn pizza is dry and not as interesting in taste as it seems on the menu but I hear their cheese pizza is pretty good.\\n\\nMy main gripe about Five Horses is that it is so noisy for a place that doesn't play loud music so it's not great for conversation over dinner. However, it's a good local tavern, with decent food (a few excellent dishes) and good to go for some drinks/apps at the bar. There is some visitor parking by the restaurant but would not advise driving there as it is mainly surrounded by resident permit only spots and they do not offer valet services (for now anyway). There is outdoor seating that is pretty nice with heaters to keep you warm during the fall if you choose to sit there which you may want to do if you don't like waiting an hour for a table.

It's odd how wavy and the floor is there.  Anyway, we told the grumpy waitress and asked if there were some extra napkins that could be folded up and placed under the leg.  So, the waitress came back without a word tossed a stack of napkins and made us fix the table. \\n\\n4. The waitress continued to be completely miserable the rest of the time we were there.

I had the bibimbap and the tofu soup combo for 10.99 and it was delicious. I have a cold so I haven't been able to taste much, but I definitely loved the heat and the seasoning of my meal. My friend's beef Korean barbecue was really gooood, and being a self-proclaimed carnivore, I'm definitely going to order that the next time I come.\\n\\nThe appetizers were seasoned soybean sprouts, cucumber pickles (the best), fried whole small fish, zucchini pickles, and kimchi.

I like the atmosphere.  Giving it another try, we found that they have recently redone their menu.  My friends with me who go there more frequently said that the menu featured more seafood and less game dishes than the previous one.  The disappointment set in immediately when we were told that happy hour prices for drinks are only good in the bar, not at dinner tables!  What is that about? We ordered chips and queso, which took way too long to arrive.  The chips were warm and crispy, and the salsa was good.  The queso itself was weird and we didn't finish it - unbelievable because even my queso-loving daughter quit eating it.  It just didn't taste good. Our dinner order for a table of five consisted of 1 appetizer, 1 rib sandwich, 1 order of two enchiladas, 1 order of two chalupas, 1 order of grilled chicken over pasta. It took about an hour.  We had salads during this time but still had to wait 35-40 min after finishing them. Our orders were simple dishes.  It's not like we had anything difficult or time-consuming to prepare.  The salads were OK but nothing to write home about.  I had the grilled chicken on bowtie pasta with a cream sauce.  The pasta was good as was the cream sauce - much lighter than a typical heavy cream.  The chicken was overtreated with what tasted like lime juice.  The bitterness set in at the back sides of the tongue and ruined each bite.  Now the place smelled wonderfully of smoked meat when we arrived, so we had high hopes for the BBQ  rib sandwich because the ribs were praised by the hostess.  Unfortunately, it was smothered in a sour sauce that disguised all the meat flavor. What a drag. Overall, it seemed as if the dishes were seasoned strangely.\\nOther issues - the waiter was slow at bringing drinks - four of us had wine. (They had a pretty good wine list and reasonably priced wine.)  Sometimes he would bring one wine and not the two or three that were ordered at the same time, and then he would never come back. We had to ask the hostess as she walked the floor to check on our drinks (I believe she was an owner or manager.) We were told the bar was backed up.  It was a Wednesday and fairly crowded so it's possible they were taken off guard.

The cannoli shells are firm, crisp, and hold up well with the moist ricotta.  \\n\\nSpeaking of ricotta, Guarino's may make the best ricotta pie in the New England region.  The crust is delicate and rich and the ricotta filling is firm, not overly sweet, and incredibly smooth.

The Hudson Grille is part sports bar part tavern.  The interior is all about dark wood, that kind of Ted's Montana Grill feel, and flat screen HD displays showing the current sporting action.\\n\\nAs we walked into the door there was a sign outside proclaiming they had 51 beers on tap.  My excitement was soon dashed by my experience at the Hudson Grille.  My questions about the various seasonal beers went pretty much unanswered by our waiter.  I got the impression that he knew very little about beer at all.  After we got a replacement drink menu, the first one was missing a page, we ordered some beers.  My wife ordered Chimay White and I got the Terrapin Monster seasonal.  The waiter brought out my beer and said they were out of the Chimay.  My wife ordered the Terrapin Monster seasonal instead.  As I took a sip of my beer I knew something wasn't right (and something looked wrong too).  The Terrapin Monster seasonal, All American Pilsner at this time, is a rather lofty 7.5% alcohol.  The beer in my hand tasted like Bud/Coors/Miller lite.  Our waiter returned with my wife's beer and it was the same.  We sent them back and ordered something else.  When those beers arrived, my wife's Hoegaarden didn't have a lemon in it (the vast majority of places server it with lemon).  Beers settled; we ordered our food.\\n\\nThe menu likely has something for everyone; fish, wraps, burgers, steaks, etc.  The food was pretty good, portions were fine, and the prices reasonable.  The food gets a passing grade for those combinations.\\n\\nOverall, I'm hoping this place will get better.  It hasn't been open that long so I'm hoping the kinks will get worked out.  The decor is nice and the atmosphere wasn't bad but it was a bit noisy (kind of expected for an upscale sports bar I suppose).  Yes, I realize I'm a bit of a beer snob but when you have 51 beers on tap I do expect the servers/bar tenders to know a bit about their products.

I ordered the steak tacos platter which and it came out fairly quickly. The carne asada was very juicy and tender; there was salsa on it instead of the traditional onion and cilantro. Personally I would have preferred just the simple cilantro and onion fillings because the salsa seemed to mask some of the natural steak flavor and it also made the tortilla shells soggy and easy to break apart in your hands. On the platter was also a small portion of pickled veggies and roasted potatoes, the latter of which I found to be a bit of an odd combination.

It was about 5:45pm.  As many have stated before me, there is ALWAYS a bit of a wait at the restaurant.  We waited about 15mins before being seated at one of the tables in the rear of the restaurant.  Service was prompt at the Bee.  Our server, Jackie took our drink orders (almost immediately).  At the Busy Bee, an Arnold Palmer (half lemonade/half iced tea) is called an Uptown (you have just been educated or re-introduced to the favorite).  A basket of slightly sweet Corn muffins were presented before us.  Delicious.  We placed our dinner orders and our food was on the table in about 10 mins..

One of my friends had the Fried Chicken, Yams and Greens, the other had the Green Beans and Potatoes, Mac and Cheese and Baked Tilapia with Yellow Rice.  The side dishes seemed to be rationed these days.  I recall (back in the day) when the side dishes were heaved (unsparingly) upon the plate.  How things have change.

It too seemed to be only treated with mustard and Im not 100% sure it was albacore, they call it a melt but its actually served Panini style making the bread really hard on the outside, I didn't like this and wouldn't have ordered that had I known and frankly expect a sandwich joint to know the difference between a melt and a Panini.

Unfortunately, I have serous concerns about the long term viability of this place, particularly considering the quality and price of the food, as well as its location. Putting a restaurant like this in this section of Virginia Highland is like putting a barbecue pork and shellfish shack in the middle of Toco Hills - you're pitching to the wrong demographic. \\n\\nFood: Waffold offers an assortment of different waffle-influenced dishes, including savory waffle sandwiches, sweet waffle desserts, waffle-cut fries, and waffle salads. During my visit, I opted for the \\"Waffold Nachos\\" as an appetizer and the \\"Cajun Fried Chicken\\" sandwich with a side of \\"Waffle Fries\\" as an entree. In hindsight, I could have done without the side of waffle fries - the Waffold Nachos were the same fries, but with a drizzle of nacho cheese, a smattering of bacon chips, and a dollop of sour cream. Although the fries themselves were tasty, the portion was small for the price and the added ingredients were equally as meager. The Cajun Fried Chicken looked absolutely glorious, but unfortunately the execution didn't match the aesthetics - the dish was incredibly bland and I'm still not clear on where exactly the \\"cajun\\" aspect came into play. \\n\\nService: Friendly and eager to please. All orders are placed at the front counter and the staff bring the food out to you once it's ready. Fountain drinks are self-serve and customers are responsible for disposing of their own trash. \\n\\nAtmosphere: Open and modern with ample seating. The restaurant also has an outdoor patio in the back, which I never knew existed at this property. Several flat screen televisions are located throughout the dining room.\\n\\nCost: Overpriced for the quality and quantity of the food. Individual sandwiches (no sides) are $7-$9, dessert waffles are $6-$7, waffle salads are $9, and an order of waffle-cut fries is $2.50. Bacon or 100% maple syrup can be added to certain items for an additional $1. \\n\\nOther: Hours of operation are Monday-Thursday, 9AM-9PM, Friday-Saturday, 9AM-10PM, and Sunday, 10AM-3PM.

(Seriously, I want this in my house at all times). \\n\\nI got the Orange Cream Pumpkin Pie pedicure and it was fabulous! It was 80 minutes and included brown sugar scrubs, a pumpkin puree mask, and a wonderful paint job. Not sure it was entirely worth the money because I was hoping it was more massaging but I was left with the hot towels for a good 15 minutes when I would have preferred to just have been getting massaged that whole time.\\n\\nI also got a massage and although I don't remember who my massage therapist was, it was a great massage. They have nice rooms, with great beds  - the beds form to you so you don't have to manually put the pillows under knees and ankles. \\n\\nThe cabana by the pool was nice as well. The pool was pretty dead, but the cabana deal included waters, sodas, pretzels, and chips and lounge chairs reserved just for you to enjoy.

Yesterday, I went with a party of twelve, 4 of which were little kids aged 19 months to 8 years old. Our experience under these conditions further cements my 5 star rating. The staff was super attentive and very patient with us. For appetizers we had the potato skins and stuffed jalape√±os. One additional note to add to my previous, brief review of the skins is that they don't put bacon 'bits' on them, they put meaty bacon chunks. Coupled with the sauce, these suckers stand out from other skins at other places. The stuffed jalape√±os were also tasty but, minor warning, are fairly spicy. I know that depending on the jalape√±o and how they're prepared, they can range in spiciness. I, for one, love a solid kick but I know that's not everyone's cup of tea. For our meal we ordered 3 pizzas: a cheese for the kiddos, one with some mix of vegetables (I didn't order that one myself, so I don't recall what exactly was on it), and the \\"3 meat and cheese\\" which had ground beef, pepperoni, bacon, and onion. That was what I ate and it was DELICIOUS. So meaty, so smoky, so YUM. And you can tell these are true house-made pies, from the dough on up. A real deal pizza just has that extra something. Additionally, I had a couple Sazeracs to drink and they hit the spot. I can't help ordering a Sazerac when I see it on a menu because, like an Old Fashion, they all taste a little different from one bar/restaurant to the next, and I feel like you can gauge the overall quality its cocktaileros by their Sazerac (or OF). In this case, the Sazzy passed muster for sure. As for the bowling experience, we all had so much fun. On my first visit, I didn't take the time to play around with all the options, but since we had kids this time, I dug around and customized the experience for them. I picked out a graphic style that had little monsters playing around on screen and they loved it. A minor extra touch, sure, but it's little things like that which a make big difference with kids. We had come here as a family birthday party for me and my wife, and my wife and I agreed we plan to make this a tradition."},{"name":"Tin Shed Garden Cafe","address":"1438 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I was probably expecting too much from this place but I was disappointed in the food.

Despite using a Scoutmob on the first visit, would have made many return visits as I live closely. However...\\n\\nThe beef shawarma was very disappointing. Not only was it completely burnt, but the meat was tough and flavorless (see photo). Having cooked similar cuts previously on the grill at home, I finished the meal assured that this is a very low quality of beef and it wasn't marinated properly. Cheaper cuts like this have to be marinated extensively to make them a little less tough. I don't know if this was one time that they messed the food up, but it's hard for me to grasp why you would serve this to a customer. Just one glance by the cook should have made it evident that this is not acceptable. If you messed up a dish, a simple, \\"we are out of beef shawarma\\" would have been fully sufficient and I would get something else.

I got the impression they were all phoning it in since they were getting paid a flat fee with gratuity included any way. Nobody went above and beyond to meet the guest's needs. \\n\\nAs for the room itself (and I understand that the family picks the room for the wedding, but still), the lighting was TOO DARK. All my pictures came out terrible! Terrible decor with dark scarlet drapery and navy carpeting. Badly in need of an update and a good decorator.

After getting the opinion of one of the \\"newsboys\\" I chose the pink sauce which is a combination of their tomato sauce and white sauce. I added some minced garlicon top and then the cheese. They have 8 different cheeses to choose from. I decided on shreeded mozzerella and pearlini mozzerella. The next step was meats and veggies, where we added chicke, Bourbon Bacon, Crimini Mushrooms, Grape tomatoes and last but not least Articoke hearts.

Chips - excellent, salsa - my one real disappointment of the night. It didn't taste like much of anything. It would be nice to see a couple of options for different palates, not all of us gringos are pansies.\\n\\nWe ordered the molletes appetizer. Honestly, it was curiosity more than anything. I've never heard of it before. Think of it as Mexican bruschetta. French bread is hollowed out, stuffed with refried beans and topped with cheese, until melted and the bread crisped, and then topped with pico de gallo. It was good on it's own merits - but with a bit of their julienned, pickled peppers and onions, that came on the side, dude - awesome. \\n\\nI ordered the arrachera for my main course, medium. First, it came cooked to perfection. It wasn't blue raw or shoe leather like most of the places some how manage to screw up steak. Served with two fresh, hot tortillas, home fry style potatoes, roasted carrots with a bit of cauliflower in there, and more of their pickled peppers and onions. Dear, sweet baby Cheezus...I left a happy, full girl. \\n\\nHusband had the tacos dorados (crispy tacos) - one each of asada, chicken and potato. He didn't say anything until he got to the last one - where he declared it was the only thing he should have ordered. The other stuff was ok, but the asada was phenomenal. The preteen had the asada street tacos, which he wolfed two of the three down and claimed no room for the rest- granted, he ate half the tortilla chips, by himself, so there is that.\\n\\nWhy am I missing a star on my review? Well, they are apparently training a new chef, so the wait was long. Really long. Antonio kept us apprised and the food was totally worth the wait, but is was on the border of ridiculous.

During all the visit the service was in a timely manner. \\nWe got ratatouille, crab cakes, asparagus with prosciutto, duck legs (2 of them on a plate), cr√®me-brule, French Red wine and a glass of a mixture (champagne with Lim√≥ncello) - excellent tastes.  They showed me the bottle of wine I was getting.   (But I must be fair: in my opinion tuna-tartar was not as good as the ones I tried before in other places.  I thought the taste was blunt).  Everything else was absolutely perfect!\\nBill was $130 plus tips.\\nElegant design and decor, soft cr√®me colors (very french) result in a pleasant ambience .\\nMusic was not loud, but comfortably pleasant to ears (exactly what I love).\\nI was completely satisfied with food and service and of course - ambience (exceptional, relaxing, romantic and sophisticated).

The first thing I noticed is that they serve margaritas in wine glasses -- what's up with that???  I'm used to margaritas being served in margarita glasses much bigger than that -- often the size of my head, and I don't have a big head (at least not literally).  However, the blood orange frozen margarita I had was very tasty!\\n\\nThey have had a change in menu.  I went with a co-worker after work, and she was disappointed that her favorite item was taken off the menu.  The first time I went, I had ordered a burrito and asked for them to make it extra extra extra spicy, and it came out extra bland.  Even the hot sauce didn't help much :o(.  This time, though, I ordered the spicier version of the buffalo tenders (I forget what they were called), and those were definitely HOT!  I have a high heat tolerance, and I don't know if I was having a bad day, but I was having a hard time handling them!  Cactus Club also gets extra points for serving fresh jalapenos with the tenders, rather than the icky pickled version.  And the portions, for being bar bites, were quite large, which was good too!  Neither of us could finish our plates.\\n\\nThe complimentary chips and salsa were really tasty.  The salsa definitely had a bite to it, which was nice.  I was a bit taken aback though, because they do charge for refills.

It consists of lean strips of beef cooked with onions, tomatoes over french fries and rice. In the case of the \\"Mar y Tierre\\" it means Sea and Earth so it also includes fresh shrimp. At El Buzo they add their own special touch of sauces on the side, one a tangy mayo sauce and another spicier paste made from herbs including basil. This dish had good flavors and the beef was tender and onions were still crisp. I really liked the herb sauce.\\n\\nThe second dish was the Asado al Vino. Roasted beef marinated in wine served with rice and yellow mashed potatoes. This was fine but not unlike american pot roast.

Order it? Was our waitress just really crappy? (yes). Shortly (and I mean maybe like 5 minutes) after ordering our food came out. I appreciate fast service, but it's a little troubling when your food comes out as fast as it does at Taco Bell... I ordered a chicken enchilada and taco lunch plate. For eight bucks, the price was good, but the food was not. Actually, I take that back. The chicken enchilada was okay. Shredded chicken, rather flavorful. The taco was crap. Instead of shredded chicken, there were pieces of chicken that were apparently marinated in sauce, but really tasted like nothing. The rice was bland (which seems to be a trend here...) and the beans were standard. The waitress disappeared for long periods of time.

When we walked in the hostess was waiting for us and before we even stopped at the door she took us to our table.  We sat at the window which was a great spot for first timers.  We were able to see all the food coming from the kitchen and the sunset outside. Our waitress Erin was prompt to greet us and explained the concept of The Ravenous Pig.  The guys ordered a Lucky 13 beer and a Gin and Jam (Lychee) cocktail.  I, being 8 months pregnant, ordered a ginger ale and Erin suggested a mock-tail that the bartender only makes for pregnant women. It was the best drink I've had in 8 months!!\\n\\nFor starters we ordered the Potted Shrimp & Crab Crostini and House-made Soft Pretzels with fondue.  The fondue was delicious and the shrimp and smoked crab pots were to die for. \\n\\nFor entrees we each ordered our own but shared so we could get a taste of everything.  The ladies went with Pub fare to save room for desert.  The guys went all out.\\nPub Burger:  Very high quality products went into making this burger. We must have seen at least 20 of them served during the two hours we were there.\\nLobster Tacos: a serving of 3 was plenty to eat and the jalapenos on the side. The breading on the fried lobster was fluffy like sweet and sour chicken which I don't really care for but the avocado cream and slaw was a perfect compliment. \\nLobster & Short Rib: served in a bowl which threw us off at first and so much lobster foam it was hard to see what was beneath, but one mouthful of foam and you knew you were in for a treat.  The dish was very complimentary and everything was delicious.  The butter-poached Maine lobster tail, grilled 48-hour short rib, potato puree, fennel-apricot agrodolce, amazing.\\nSmoked Vande Rose Pork Porterhouse: served on a cutting board with a steak knife but you didn't even need the steak knife to get a bite.  The fat left on the sides of the pork was crispy and made each outside bite so delightful. The topping, I'm not sure what it was but made each inside bite just as great. The side, served in a small cast iron dish; cantaloupe and watermelon salad, Charlie's banana peppers,\\nbarbecue gastrique...awesome.\\n\\nAs if that wasn't enough to fill us up we couldn't resist the desert menu.  Come on the owner is a pastry chef!  We couldn't decide so went for our top 4 picks and shared.\\nCake: coconut cream filling, toasted coconut-cream cheese frosting,\\ngrilled pineapple, mango sorbet....need I say more?\\nChocolate-peanut butter whoopie pies, sweet cream milkshake: Good but our least favorite out of the 4 we tried.  The serving came out with 3 whoopie pies and since there were 4 of us the chef had no problem serving one more.  They're about the size of a dollar coin.  The milkshake was good, like the ones I make at home real vanilla bean ice cream. \\nNectarine-blueberry cobbler, cr√®me fra√Æche-brown sugar biscuit,\\ntarragon ice cream: Definitely the winner on the table!  The tarragon ice cream throws you off at first but you're in love by your second bite.  I'm already trying to figure out how to do this desert take out.\\nChocolate-covered goat cheesecake, almond crust, blackberry sorbet:  If you like goat cheese you have to try this.  The dark chocolate, think shell took some effort to break through but the distraction was good because once you dug in you didn't want to stop.  The cheese melted in your mouth and the goat cheese flavor went perfectly with the dark chocolate.  The blackberry sorbet on a chocolate crumble was such a nice compliment. \\n\\nif my long review hasn't already made you open another tab to book a reservation on Open Table you should do so now. It's worth the wait and definitely worth the money.  You can't go here with a tight wallet.  Add in a couple of after dinner bourbons for the guys and we left full and happy $250 later.

When I arrived back about 15 minutes later I was told that they hadn't put my order in.  That even though I said I would be back shortly, and I offered to pay for it, they thought I was leaving and cancelling my order.\\n\\nI went ahead and placed my order again and stayed to wait for it this time.  I waited almost a half an hour for my caprese sandwich.  I was not given a discount for their mistake and not even offered a drink during my long wait.  Finally when I got home and was ready to eat I opened up the container and the food was a mess.  It looked as though it had just been thrown into the container.  It was also cold and completely soggy like it had been sitting around that whole time that I was waiting.  With bad service on two out of two visits, I definitely won't be trying them again."},{"name":"Nature's Table","address":"451 E Altamonte Dr","city":"Altamonte Springs","stars":"3","text":"I ordered the chipotle chicken wrap and got everything in it except for the chicken.

Just lettuce and dressing sprinkled with nuts - and yet it was one the bast salads I had had in a while.\\n\\nFinally, we ordered the San Fran sandwich with vegan Thai peanut soup. The sandwich was roasted chicken, bacon, gorgonzola cream & green apple grilled sourdough. YUM! The soup was really more of a coconut soup than a peanut, but delicious none the less. Amazingly creamy for a vegan offering.\\n\\nThe Tin Shed is really what so many restaurants in Portland strive to be, but just aren't.

Out of all of the things I bought (butter rolls, coconut buns, mochi red bean buns, and black forrest cake) the only thing I enjoyed was the mochi red bean bun.  The prices are very low, but not as cheap as China town. The cakes on display were very pretty and I def. know where I'm getting my next fruit cake. The coconut bun was good, but nothing compared to Mei sum's, the butter rolls were ok, def. needed a cup of hot ovaltine to do the magic though, and the black forest cake was good, but the weird filling tasted like artifical jam, yuck.

Now \\"tequila\\" is not an adjective, and the night that Jamie W. and I came (after a disappointing no-show by the fruit bats at Congress Avenue Bridge), it was more like a verb. I was cajoled by the friendly waitress to try one of their specialty tequila drinks, and I felt like I was tequila'ed into a nice Austinite buzz. It was called a Ranch Water, a tumbler of herradura, a 1/4-shot grand marnier, fresh lime juice, and a hint of sugar water. This is poured over rocks, and you have to keep topping it off with Topo Chico mineral water in order to make the drink last. It worked since my whistle felt wet during the whole meal. \\n\\nMaybe because I was buzzed, I thought the food was pretty good. So did Jamie. We started with the $7 Ranch Slice of Ice, the familiar iceberg lettuce wedge salad that has made a culinary comeback with the obligatory, blue cheese, cherry tomatoes, shredded carrots and Ranch dressing. They split it in two for us to share (see photo). Jamie ordered the $22 Grilled Duck Breast, dry-rubbed and topped with a demi-glace sauce. It was accompanied by a Parmesan grit cake stick, poblano mashed potatoes, and a baked tomato stuffed with piccadillo and topped with melted queso blanco (see photo). Tasty though the meat on the drumstick was too chewy for Jamie's taste. \\n\\nI went for the $16.50 Pork Tenderloin 616, a house specialty that mixed ancho honey-glazed pork tenderloin medallions served with glossy portabello mushroom slices. It came with the poblano mashed potatoes and roasted corn and was topped with pico de gallo. It was good stuff and a plentiful portion that seemed to get bigger every time I took a shot of the Ranch Water. We sat indoors surrounded by all the local memorabilia, antique photographs, and semi-sauced revelers looking to dine before heading out to the clubs on 6th Street. There's a more popular patio where they have live music weekly, but it was pretty quiet the evening we went. We also liked the air-conditioning hitting us in our booth. \\n\\nFOOD - 4 stars...Austin-style creations, big portions \\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...funky and somewhat kitschy but it works \\nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...the waitress is from Sacramento, so we had a Northern California bond \\nTOTAL - 4 stars...good dining choice for those who want an Austin-type eatin'-and-drinkin' experience"},{"name":"Century Bar","address":"930 SE Sandy Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"3","text":"If I could, I'd give the unpleasant bouncer one star and the helpful bartenders five stars.

Nor is it even Kome, really. Honestly, it's a far cry short of Ramen Tatsuya as well. But it's vastly cheaper than the former two and has a line an hour shorter than the latter. And if you're looking for a neighborhood place in Rosedale to fill up on some decent Japanese food for a very reasonable price, you could certainly do a whole lot worse.\\n\\nThe missus and I had been threatening to go to Banzai for a while, in the same tone that we threaten to take each other to the Chili's on Lamar and 45th for birthdays. Given Bonzai's 1950's drive-up exterior and very low advertised prices, we were Chili's-sure that it couldn't be any good. \\n\\nTurns out we were wrong. It's clean and comfy inside with the usual Japanese-light wood furniture, and the staff are friendly and attentive (it's counter service only, though). They're sensitive to vegetarian concerns and will ask you if certain things (like eggs) are okay if you order a veg option.\\n\\nSo, we did the vegetarian croquette, chicken karage, and two veggie ramens ($6.99!), ordered spicy. The croquette was crunchy and tasty. The karage (served in a bowl of brown rice) really had no reason to exist in a world in which Uchiko's recipe also exists, but did its best and went well with some sriracha. The ramen noodles were most assuredly not hand-spun in house, but the broth was tasty (if not actually spicy) and we left filled up and satisfied with what we paid for the meal.\\n\\nNone of this may sound like a ringing endorsement, but my main fear going in was that you can't make decent Japanese food at a price this low, that Banzai was a disaster waiting to happen. But you can, and it's not. In fact, we're often looking for a non-event meal that won't break the bank, and, given a lot of other things on the menu that looked appealing, I wouldn't be surprised to see us back here another time or two."},{"name":"Tavern In The Square","address":"120 Beverly St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Was expecting this place, right across from our hotel and just across the street from TD Gardens, to be a typical tourist feed bag with high prices, mediocre food, and poor service.

Compromising on a winter opening was a bad plan for Slumbrew, as it turned the great idea of an outdoor drinking area in Boston (a relative rarity) into a cramped, difficult to find and disorganized tented excuse for a \\"bar\\". I hesitate to call it that, as it more resembles a stadium hot food stand than any proper drinking establishment, complete with self-serving advertisements and even a gift shop. The staff was hectic and disorganized, seemingly new to this whole \\"restaurant and bar\\" business, not keeping track of orders or bothering to clean up the place. They had also run out of half of their beer selection by the time I showed up; and while that might say something about their popularity, I think it more reflects on their lack of planning than anything else. On that note, the place was packed with Assembly Square types, a subgroup I didn't think could exist in the Boston area. It was nigh impossible to get a table or a seat, and the one I did get was met with furtive glances from Hollister shirts and North Face jackets.\\n\\nThe actually food and drink was about as over-priced and superficial as the patrons; I know it's not a great comparison, but a small, mostly-bread sandwich here costs me what a 1lb burger and pint of beer would cost me at the Pour House on a Saturday night.

After the hype dies down in a few weeks, I see this place closing for the season; it just doesn't make financial sense to pay for terrible heaters mixed with a leaky tent in the cold of Boston winter, no matter how much you're overcharging for food and drink.

We were able to walk in with no wait.  After reading the time limit policy....you pay by the hour and if the time runs out before you're finished playing your 10 frames, too bad, the game automatically shuts down.  My sister's boyfriend was from another country and never bowled before.  We felt putting that time limit on us may not have been such a good idea.  We then inquired about the cost and rules only to have experienced the rudest staff member.  As we were asking him questions, he put his head down and seemed extremely annoyed as if we were disturbing him.  Maybe customers frequently ask the same questions but as a representative of Comet, he is still required to provide appropriate customer service.  He made it clear that he wasn't the owner and did not seem to care.  I understand that he does not make the rules but if the establishment is to continue to bring in business, he should try to at least show a little courtesy and act like he wants to keep his job.  If the company fails, he fails and would be out of a job.  The staff should attempt to relay customer concerns to the management in order to make improvements.  No one at the front desk appeared to care or wanted to be there.  If you hate your job that much, let someone else have a chance at employment. \\n\\nAfter such rude treatment, we decided not to stay.  We instead drove 15 miles to a different alley and from the time we walked in the door, we had a better experience.

I would characterize it as an \\"upscale tavern.\\"\\n\\nThe food is delicious - a fun spin on classic bar food - and the beer list is great. A lot of the beers on tap switch out with the seasons, so there's always something new to try, and the bartenders enjoy helping people find one that they like. Last fall, for instance, a friend and I sampled the 3-4 different ciders on tap before each settling on one we liked. It takes more time and knowledge from the bartenders,, but really adds to the experience - and we of course showed our appreciation in tips (which are pooled among bartenders btw).\\n\\nIt gets really crowded, especially late night and on Celtics/Bruins game days, but if it's not too hectic, find Jay and have him make you a specialty, off-menu cocktail. He's wonderful behind the bar and really knows his stuff!\\n\\nAs for food, you really can't go wrong. The crowd favorite is the Mac N Cheese bites, which are basically deep fried balls of mac and cheese topped with BBQ sauce. Phenomenal. I've also tried the wings, tots, burgers, nachos...all great.\\n\\nThe one downside of Tavern is its popularity.

I myself am a host so I get that sometimes you are busy seating other guests but 5 different employees had walked by before the bartender had to say someone will be with us in a minute. When the hostess came, she asked if a high top was okay, not my preference but I'm not going to mess up their rotation so we happily agreed. Walked past TEN un-bussed booths. The last thing a guest wants to see is a sea of chewed up food swimming in old Sprite in the bottom of a dish bin. Especially when it only leaves you with a couple clean high tops to seat them at. Took a while to be greeted by our server so we figured we would get the whole order ready. Good came out in a timely fashion. I got a buffalo chicken sandwich which came with zero buffalo sauce on it. Couldn't find the server for 10 minutes or so, so I just sucked it up and ate an unseasoned grilled chicken sandwich. We had to get back to work so we asked for the bill. She said she would be back with change, 15 minutes later my boyfriend had to go find her just to get his change to which she replied \\" oh I thought I gave you that already\\". As we were dining we saw the table behind up try and fail to get her attention 3 times as well. There was a total of 6 tables sat and 4 people at the bar. I saw at least 3 servers.

This place serves extremely well-executed, simple, delicious Italian fare.  I've tried everything here and loved it all but the stand-outs are: appetizers: the chicken liver mousse on crostini and the barata cheese with prosciutto (but everything else is always excellent too).  The thin-crust pizza's are... well, let's just say you can't go wrong in your choice - among the best pizzas in town IMHO.  Pasta is always excellent but I'll generally stick to the specials (had a penne with pork ragout the other night that was to die for - I hope they put it on the menu). \\n\\nThe wine list is excellent and varied - but strictly Italian which is just fine with me.  A tip: ask Brad or Chris or Phillip (whichever of the three is behind the bar)  to recommend a wine that's not on the regular list and you'll get to taste some amazing bargains many of which are just not available anywhere else in town (tell them what you like and they will not disappoint).  I had a simply fabulous Barolo the other night that clocked in at $14 a glass and was easily worth much more.  Also, a stunning Nebiolo at also less than $14.  The service is perfect and the staff are all a delight and very friendly and approachable.  My fianc√©e asked one of the chef's for the recipe for the pork ragout and he not only brought back the printed recipe but discussed the making of it with us!\\n\\nMy only complaint might be that they don't take reservations but then, they don't really need to as the place is busy enough with us walk-ins that live nearby - and even if you wait 15-20mins it's well worth it.  Their desserts are always delicious too but perhaps not their strong suit in that they're rarely beyond what you would expect.  This place is truly a gem and I think it's the best restaurant in the price range (low mid) in the West End.

The previous reviews got me pretty prepared and excited for my trip here, and I definitely did not leave disappointed.\\n\\nJunior/Junior's is located in a small plaza on Kirkman Road and is in a part of town with which I'm not at all familiar, but I can see myself becoming more acquainted with it, in large part because of this place. (Though I probably won't be back in the immediate future; keep reading for further details.)\\n\\nI didn't take too much time to look at the menu and decide upon what I was going to order since the basis of the visit was to try the hamburger. As I'm sure everyone else I was with did, I ordered one and asked for everything on it ... onions, lettuce, tomato, crushed potato chips, mayo, ketchup ... I know I'm leaving stuff out, but perhaps you get the idea by now nonetheless. (Note: I did not have cheese on my burger since I overheard the cashier tell someone that the cheese that goes on them is American cheese ... which I loathe. So, my burger had everything except for that on it.) Upon receiving my burger, I went over to where the toppings are and put on some mustard, some garlic sauce and a pineapple sauce. I think I even tried some dark (BBQ?) sauce, too. Maybe 2-3 minutes after I sat down to eat, my burger was gone. Completely devoured. I even used a plastic spoon to scoop up the remains of the crushed potato chips, and I ate those as well. The burger was great! Definitely worth the trip, and I'm sure you'll feel the same way if you, too, give it a try.\\n\\nNow for the part where I lost my self-restraint: a few other people with whom I'm familiar (the owner of the Treehouse food truck and a few of his friends) stopped by, and some of the others I was already with ordered some more food ... so I couldn't help myself, and I had a 2nd hamburger. Haha. This is why I probably won't be back for a while, since I'm sure that every time I'm here I'll end up eating at least one hamburger, and probably two. (Or perhaps a double burger; I had two single burgers tonight. Singles are $5, doubles $6 and triples $7.) I may need to exercise some self-control and stay away from here for a while, especially if you take into consideration all of the other stuff I've been eating lately. (See my reviews of the chicken & waffles food truck, N.Y. Pizza Wheels, etc.) I will most definitely try to make it back in here someday, but it may be time to slow down a little bit, eating-wise. :(\\n\\nWith my 2nd burger, I had a can of Postobon's apple-flavored soda, which is incredible. I probably could've had a few more (it really is THAT delicious), but after eating that 2nd burger, my conscience - and body - said \\"No.\\" A few other Colombian beverages/soft drinks are available here, but I didn't try anything other than the aforementioned apple-flavored soda. Chris R. and I think a few other people had a passion fruit-flavored juice or beverage, which looked tasty.\\n\\nOverall, I'm giving this establishment 4 stars, though I surely can understand why and how the most avid of its fans would give it the full 5. Maybe even I will someday and when my body says it's okay to return and have a hamburger ... or two.\\n\\nP.S. Hey, look - that's me (with the red shirt on) in that one picture that was added!

Unfortunately, the Breugger's version consisted of a square \\"egg patty\\" (hint: eggs should not come in pre-formed square patties), some cold-ish bacon, and a square of unmelted American cheese.

Really? At the old spot, we could change out the names so that everyone's statistics would be their own. Speaking of stats, we were able to keep up with our scores and the 1st week of bowling determined our handicap.

Holy moly, I used to go to Cafe Mozart right off of I-85 all the time. Seriously. All. the. time. Then later I moved northwest on Pleasant Hill and tried out all the other Korean bakeries. Noms. Then later... I sort of got sick of all of the pastries, because I totally overdid it. Sort of like when I was about 12 years old and asked my grandma to make me scrambled eggs every day when I got home from school. I ate this afternoon \\"snack\\" for months until one day I couldn't stand eggs and I stopped eating them for a couple of YEARS. I'm one of those.\\n\\nMy sister told me about the new Mozart on BuHi and I was all, \\"ehhh, meh, whatevs.\\" She kept going there to study and one day after grabbing my favorite bubble tea from fellow BuHi occupant, KFT, I headed over after a long day with our little booger. I just needed some \\"me\\" time and I met my sister while she was studying. I think it was way more fun for me, as I kept poking her and tried to snuggle with her as she crammed in landscape architect stuff for an upcoming licensing exam. Oh adulting...\\n\\nAnyway, she let me sip her green tea (plain sans milk or sugar) and told me she was waiting for her friend/our-sister-from-another-mister/J. She continued sharing that oftentimes when they study together, they order the bungeoppang. Okay, she didn't actually say \\"bungeoppang,\\" because we totally butcher Korean words. Not maliciously or intentionally but it happens regardless. But she pointed at the easel with the big photo of fish-shaped, stuffed waffles. I said, \\"Whaaaa?! I wanna try!\\" \\"J is not coming for another half hour though!\\" \\"Call her now. Tell her to come so that I can share in this basket of goodness. Because I'm not sure if I'll like it and I don't want to make her eat cold fish-shaped waffles.\\" After a quick call, J was sitting with us and we had some bungeoppang (my sister went to order as J was on the way) on our table. I took a bite and taste buds rejoiced. I had never had anything like it and I immediately, in a sly manner (not but really), asked for another one! Come here and order these, which can be stuffed with choux cream (custard), red beans, or bean powder (I think that's what injeolmi refers to), or chocolate (all flavors as Dynomutt F. shared in one of his photos). Extra fun to eat and tasty to boot!\\n\\nYou will find the usual Cafe Mozart suspects here, such as the different Korean savory and sweet buns and pastries, cakes, cookies/biscuits, coffees, teas, bubble teas, smoothies, fruit juices, Italian sodas, lemonades, and shaved ice. Grab anything to not leach from the business as you get to work or hang out with other peeps or just yourself in this really comfortable and cozy, modern, sorta industrial space. I like that since it's sort of tucked away and not super trendy, there is still calm and silence to be enjoyed here. While I hope for their success and longevity, I also really like that Caf√© Mozart provides a sort of urban oasis here on BuHi.\\n\\n[#Yelp365: 22/365]"},{"name":"Barlata Tapas Bar","address":"1500 S Lamar Blvd, Ste 150","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Great place to get Spanish tapas.

From 2010-2012 they have won Diner's Choice \\"Best Dining Environment\\", \\"Best Shanghainese Restaurant\\" and \\"Best Xiao Long Bao (soup dumpling)\\" awards. Today they have 5 locations across BC in Vancouver, Richmond and Burnaby.\\n\\nThe Robson location is one we always find ourselves coming back to.  Finding acceptable Chinese in the West End is difficult and Dinesty fills the void for us. Affordable Chinese food in BC is average to terrible usually. There is almost always a line up here, and a good amount of non-Chinese customers. Andrew prefers dive like Chinese restaurants. Usually these types of places will only have Chinese customers as the service is pretty bad and interior looks outdated or dirty. We think Dinesty is popular because of the clean interior space, open concept kitchen, and images of every menu item. After we gave it a try, it was much better than expected. We have been repeat customers for the past 2 years. If you've eaten a lot of Chinese food in your life, then Dinesty's food is average at best. They have line ups as there is really no competition for them in the West End and the pricing is affordable. They also do take-out which we do often. We usually call ahead 15-20 minutes before arriving  to pick up our takeout. \\n\\nWHAT WE TRIED:\\n- Simmer Chicken w/ Basil & Triple Sauce (debone) | $15.95\\n- House Special Tofu on Iron Plate | $12.95\\n- Steamed Pork Soup Dumplings | $6.50 \\n- Steamed Vegetable & Pork Dumplings | $6.95 |\\n- Pan Fried Pork Buns | $3.95 \\n- Pan Fried Pork Pot Stickers | $6.95\\n- Pan Fried Chinese Green Onion Pancake | $4.50\\n- Pan Fried Chive Dumplings | $3.95\\n- Pan Fried Pork Buns | $3.95\\n- Pan Fried Marinated Beef Wraps | $6.95\\n- Steamed Red Bean Sponge Cake Slice | $2.75\\n- Hot & Sour Soup Small | $5.50\\n- Tofu Soup with Minced Beef & Parsley | $8.95\\n- Chinese Spinach Soup with Tofu & Shredded Pork\\n- Noodle Soup with Beef | $9.50\\n- Spicy Noodle with Minced Pork & Mushroom | $7.95\\n- Shanghai Fried Noodles (Pork)| $9.50\\n- Stir Fried Rice Cake Shanghai Style (Pork)| $10.95\\n- Fried Rice with Deep Fried Pork Chop | $11.95\\n- Fried Rice with Dry Scallops & Egg White | $11.95\\n- Glutinous Rice Roll (Salty) | $4.50\\n- Pan Fried Radish Slice Cake | $4.25\\n- Soft Tofu with Spicy Meat Sauce (Mabo Tofu) | $10.95\\n- Spicy String Beans with Minced Pork | $14.95\\n- Stir Fried Bamboo Shoots w/ -house Soy Sauce | $10.95\\n\\nSPECIAL DEALS:\\n\\n- Super Wednesday\\nEvery Wednesday from 11 A.M. - 10 P.M.

(points accepted by all Dinesty locations)\\n\\nOVERALL IMPRESSION OF DINESTY:\\nAlthough Dinesty won many awards, we wouldn't recommend going out of your way to go here. They are average at best, but in the West End, they fill the void for acceptable Chinese food. It's a decent option for those who live in the area and don't want to make a trip far. It's very friendly to customers new to Chinese food as there are photos for every menu item and the interior is very clean. There is usually a wait for a table but it shouldn't take too long as tables are in and out pretty fast. If there are any dishes you love at Dinesty and think we should try it next time, feel free to contact us!\\n\\nThe Good:\\n- Fairly authentic take on Chinese food\\n- Food comes fast and taste is acceptable\\n\\nThe Bad:\\n- Cash and Debit on orders less than $20\\n- They won a lot of awards but food is average"},{"name":"Renaissance Orlando at SeaWorld","address":"6677 Sea Harbor Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"Been here for one night so far..

Tamale House), I've been looking for the perfect bean and cheese breakfast taco, paired with the perfect salsa. (I've resolved myself to the fact that nobody is going to let me have rice in my taco any longer. Gone are the days of rice and bacon tacos.) Bean and cheese tacos with salsa should not really be so difficult, but I'm picky and a lot of options in this town are just not up to par. \\n\\nEnter Tacodeli, making me eat my own words. Their bean and cheese tacos are god damn magnificent. Yeah, I know. I called these tacos yuppie tacos and Tacos for White PeopleÔøΩ? I was always pretty adamantly against anything and everything Tacodeli (except their salsas), so this is a pretty monumental occasion. I CHANGED MY MIND, and that just does not happen. \\n\\nSoft flour tortillas, refried BLACK beans, WHITE CHEESE, and the best part of all: Dona salsa. Wow. I've gone full white girl because I just can't even with how good these are. So simple in execution, but so delicious. Oh, so gloriously delicious. \\n\\nI don't mess with eggs or meat in my tacos. I don't mess around with anything other than beans and cheese. I just want a simple taco with a kick-ass salsa and Tacodeli has fulfilled all of my taco dreams. \\n\\nIf I could put Dona salsa on everything, that would pretty much make me the happiest girl on Earth.

The dishes took a long time to arrive...like over 30 minutes (while the waiter did not once come by to check on our table). Bad service, the waiter was actually quite rude. When most of our dishes finally did arrive, we devoured them because we were so hungry. Then we sat there...no one cleared the plates and no one asked if we wanted more to eat or drink. When we finally called the waiter over, he said \\"you're all done now right?\\". Wrong. he had forgotten 2 of our dishes (but not before asking if we were sure we ordered them!!) We were promised that they  would arrive in 5 minutes. One of them did, we finished it quickly (as we were still hungry). The 2nd was still missing. We decided just to get the bill rather than waiting around for it.

My boyfriend had heard about this place from a friend, and after his recent move to Lynn, we've been wanting to try it out for a while. Saturday night seemed to be the perfect time to do so. We called around 7:30 to ask if they had any open reservations that evening for a party at five, and they said we could come in at 9:00 (they close at 10pm, which is a tad early, but understandable for the 'burbs), which was perfect.\\n\\nThe restaurant is literally located on the Lynn/Swampscott line and there is some parking on the surrounding streets. The inside is quite small -- there were probably around a dozen tables or so, with a semi-open kitchen and a bar. There was a fake tree growing in one corner, and the tables and chairs were all wooden. \\"Antique Table\\" is the perfect name for this place, because that's exactly how it looked -- rustic and antique. It was still quite busy considering we didn't get there until 9pm. We were seated promptly and Maureen came to get our drink order (I don't know if she's an owner or whatnot, but it seemed like it). She is exactly like how I would have pictured an Italian mother -- right down to the sense of humor! \\n\\nWe got two appetizers to share (mussels and bruschetta), a bottle or Chianti, and each of us got an entree. We asked for the mussels to be made with a spicy red sauce, which they happily accommodated, and it was delicious! The mussels were nice and meaty, the portions were huge, and the sauce was very spicy -- just how we asked for it. The bruschetta was incredibly fresh and delicious as well. For dinner, I had the Gnocci Basilico and it was wonderful. The gnocci was a tad burnt on one side, but the sauce it was in was wonderful and everyone else enjoyed their food as well. A quiet table is always good, because it means everyone is busy eating! \\n\\nThe final bill for five entrees, two appetizers, a bottle of wine, and six Peronis came to a little under $150. We were shocked when we saw how low the bill was! If you are anywhere in the area, or if you are willing to make the trek up to Lynn, this place is definitely worth checking out.

I hate beets and previously had them subbed out for roasted cauliflower. Today it was an issue, so I asked for mushrooms. They're out of mushrooms. I requested cauliflower again and 10 minutes later they can do it. By now its been over 20 mins since I arrived and I am starving. My salad and fries came more than 30 minutes after I ordered. A salad. And they were not busy outside. Another table next to me waited for food for more than 45 minutes and had to get a manager.

However, I believe it had the upper hand above the late Los Jalapenos in the Blacklick area as far as food quality.

I've never encountered any problems at all!\\n\\nOur server was fabulous. Even though we were sitting outside, she was around often. I never saw the bottom of our chip bowl or my water glass.

The gym was well equipped with cardio machines, weights, and a universal. There was also a separate room for cycling, barre, and kettle bells. There's a resort fee applied each day you're here. We didn't mind Because it included enhanced internet, waters restocked daily, the gym, and free shuttles to universal, Disney and the premium outlets.

Especially since I love pork belly.\\n\\nIt was 12:30 and the place was packed. This is usually a good sign. I ordered the Pork Belly Cubano, which set me back a whole $10. My food was out quick, and had a side of kettle chips.\\n\\nI sat down to enjoy the sandwich. It was about 7 inches long, and had a decent amount of filling. Upon first bite, the cheese stretches out and mustard gushes into your mouth, along with a crunchy chunk of French bread. The mustard is any ol' yellow mustard, and the pickles taste like any other storebought sliced pickle. The pork belly was extremely fatty - more gooey than I'm used to. \\n\\nAn hour after eating the sandwich, I found myself feeling sick and vomiting. I realize there are a lot of factors at play here, but some employee may have not taken the proper precautions to ensure that they're not contaminating the customers.\\n\\nI decided, despite the sickness, to go back again a few days later with a friend. The sandwich was the same - okay. The mustard was far more overpowering than anything else in the sandwich, this time. And, the lady at the register was very rude and made me feel dumb when I asked her to clarify something on the receipt. On the bright side, I didn't get sick this time.\\n\\nOverall, this place serves decent sandwiches. They're way overpriced, in my opinion.

She said she had to bring it out because it was already poured and I told her it was too late, that she needed to take it off the bill.  She insisted that she couldn't and I had to get a manager involved, who took it off the bill.

I usually don't order food when I come to establishments like this because the food is usually lacking in taste. My friend mentioned the food was good so I figured why not. When the entree came out I knew I'd probably be disappointed. The fish looked like the greasy frozen fish fillets that come in a bag, and the fries looked as if they had seen better days. Being that looks can be deceiving, I dove in. This time looks were not deceiving. If not for the service from Leo I'd probably be disappointed with my entire experience.

The most recent one was the best experience at an Olive Garden that I've ever had. The server, Mike, was very friendly, outgoing, helpful and personable. Our food was served very quickly, was delicious and filling. In the spirit of the holidays (I believe this most recent visit was just prior to Christmas 2010), Mike left us with a small card that read something along the lines of \\"Happy holidays! Thank you!\\" and had his name on it. Not sure I've ever received one of those from anyone at a restaurant, no matter which one. Perhaps he did this for all of his customers that day and during the holiday season, and perhaps all of the company's servers across the country do the same, but it was still very kind and it put a smile my face and that of my company. Maybe this all sounds cheesy ... it was just a cool experience. I definitely would come back to this particular Olive Garden at any time. You can't beat that unlimited soup/salad/breadsticks deal they offer during the lunchtime hours.\\n\\nI'd like to visit this, or any, Olive Garden with a little more frequency, though I do my best to check out any recommended/small/independently-owned Italian establishments as it seems that those often are the best. Still, there's nothing wrong with Olive Garden every once in a while, especially if you get the service and hospitality my company and I were provided with during my most recent visit!\\n\\nAlso, going to Olive Garden is worth the trip just for that white chocolate/raspberry cheesecake. Even if you go just for that, it's worth it. I've never gone just for that, but I'd consider it!"},{"name":"City Barbeque","address":"2511 Blackmon Dr","city":"Decatur","stars":"4","text":"I absolutely love the food and have never been disappointed but the service is lacking. I won a $50 gift card via a Facebook contest and went to redeem it today. I figured I'd buy a pound of brisket and a pound of pulled chicken, just so I have a few meals for the week. They bagged everything up for me and once I got to the car I pulled them out to take a look. Well, my brisket was much heavier and filled up the container much more. So I went back in and said \\"hey, my pulled chicken didn't seem to be as heavy as my brisket.\\" She feels then and agrees so then she brings the pulled chicken back to the gentleman that filled the container. I guess he tells her that they're both a pound and she gives me the container and says \\"yea.\\" I'm guessing that \\"yea\\" means she's not giving me more so I say \\"are they the same weight?\\" And she says \\"yea, brisket is just heavier than chicken...\\" That's when I say \\"well if they're both a lb they should both feel like a lb\\" and she says \\"oh, we he weighed it\\" and that was it. Kind of crazy because he didn't weigh it the second time. And correct me if I'm wrong, but it should take more volume to make a pound of pulled chicken than the brisket... and there was less chicken in the container than brisket. Just a little disappointed."},{"name":"Tin Shed Garden Cafe","address":"1438 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Free coffee while you wait.  Dog friendly.  Good atmosphere.

After reading several reviews, I took other people's advice of coming early before the restaurant even opens, which is 5:30pm (they only serve dinner).  We got there a little past 5pm and already there was a lineup of about 50 people!  Thankfully, we still got a table as soon as they opened.\\n\\nFrom the moment we entered, the customer service had been top notch.  We were given free food samples and chai tea to start(chai tea is unlimited).  We were also given water right away and they kept re-filling it throughout dinner without having to ask for it.  The staff were all very nice and very attentive.  \\n\\nNow on to the main part- THE FOOD!\\nFor appetizers, we ordered the Garam masala saut√©ed portobello mushrooms in porcini cream curry and the Spicy boneless chicken wings on sweet potato + ricotta cookies.  Both were good but my favorite out of the two would have to be the mushroom one.  The sauce was just so good and garlicky!  The chicken appy was good but wasn't really anything special in my opinion.\\n\\nFor the mains, we ordered two of the lamb popsicles(obviously), saag paneer, and the Punjabi style goat meat curry.  The sauce of lamb popsicles was AMAZING.  If I was eating that at home I would've licked the plate!  The lamb itself was good too but the portions were a bit small.  The goat curry was also good but  I think it's just as good as other goat curries I've had.  The saag paneer was probably the least of my favorite because it wasn't really anything new to me.  Also, these dishes came with naan, which were so good!\\n\\nOverall, our experience here was excellent!  Yes the food was good but I think what made our experience as good as it was mainly the customer service we received.

Though it might sound sad, this further statement is very true, I have become something of a Chipotle connoisseur. Don't hate. \\n\\nThis particular location I can only give three stars, and it sort of hurts my heart to do that. It is Chipotle after all. Here is the thing though, there are certain constants that every Chipotle have, and because of this, I can not let them be a factor in my rating decision. The short list is as such: \\n\\n- The food: it will ALWAYS be nom. If you come across a Chipotle that doesn't have delicious fresh nom, then step outside and make sure the sign says Chipotle and not Chip-pote-lay. There could be some imposter's running around, and you shouldn't be fooled. \\n\\n- The decor: corrugated tin applied to light wood, and red painted walls. If you have never been to a Chipotle, think industrial, modern, Mayan. \\n\\n- The music: I have written about the music in the review I did for the Saugus location. It is pure B-side awesomeness with indie rock magic, sprinkled with commercial free fantastic-ness. Whom ever picks the music for this restaurant chain, has fairly excellent taste in life. \\n\\nThose are standard, and, therefore, can not be included in my determination of the rating. What can be included? Ha haa! Here I go... \\n\\n-Cleanliness: over all this one is fairly clean. It may take a little bit longer than you would like for the tables to be wiped down, but over all it is clean. \\n\\n-The friendliness of the staff: Now, I see on the other reviews that the service was friendly for them. Lucky them. After, at least 5 trips here, I don't think that I can say I have ever had friendly service. That is not to say that the people behind the counter were openly hostile or rude to me, they weren't even unfriendly to me. Their attitude has just been a lack of friendly and devoid of any other emotion. They also are known to skimp on the rice, not cool. \\n\\n-Fellow customers: This is where the sad trombone sound should be inserted. *sigh* I do not understand how this Fresh Pond area can attract these people. They are always one of three types of people: A family/ very pregnant woman with at least two children under the age of 4 in tow, hippies, and bros. If they are of the latter grouping, they will not travel in a group smaller than four. Four bros at one time is a lot to deal with (I know, I know, \\"that's what she said\\"). They are loud and obnoxious and messy. They also give each other high fives for no good reason. Someone needs to inform them that the high five is freaking sacred, and should only be implemented for the recognition of important happenings such as witty comebacks and successful food tossing/ mouth catching. Not for ogling a poor Asian girl through the window, scaring her, and making her pick up speed to get away from the window faster. Just sayin', that is not cool or high five worthy. In regards to the first group I just want to say that 'free-range' children have their place, and that place is not the floor and stools of Chipotle. Finally, to the middle group, your dreads are in your guacamole and that is just gross."},{"name":"The Range Bar & Grille","address":"306 Whiting St","city":"Hingham","stars":"3.5","text":"Went for dinner last night with a girlfriend & had a great time!

I went there last night with my fiancee, and we enjoyed every bite of every dish. I ordered an Oldfashioned and she ordered a Bellini while we waited for our table. My drink was awesome, served with a slice of bacon, and I felt a little buzz after it (a rarity for me). \\n\\nWe started with the Gruyere Biscuits and Mussels, both of which were delightful. The biscuits were surprisingly filling, served as they were with a delicious spiced butter. The mussels were soaked in a witte beer, which was a delicious innovation on the usual lemon-butter sauce. I want to stress that these mussels were MASSIVE, and they were served with a thick saffron sauce. They also came with truffle fries, which were absolutely the best fries I've ever had. I was truly amazed how TRP was able to craft these delicious shoestring fries, and it demonstrates the restaurant's theme of doing otherwise normal pub food at a 4-star level.\\n\\nThen, the entrees. My better half ordered a pasta dish (because she was already getting full from our apps), and I went with the Pork Platter Sampler. Now, I'm a pork man. I travel the Southeast looking for the best BBQ (best I've found, btw, is at Fresh Air BBQ in Georgia). So I thought that, if any part of our meal would underwhelm or rest on its laurels, it would be my main entree. Wow, was I wrong. 3 different pork variations comprised the platter: a pork belly piece (served with an apple chutney), a \\"country steak\\" portion (with fat marbled in, served on an acidic bed of cabbage), and a kielbasa pork sausage (served with these delicious pickled heirloom tomatoes). Each flavor combination worked so well together that I really can't find words to describe them. All I can say is you won't be disappointed with this dish, and if you're a pork lover, it's pretty much your wet dream. And it went really well with the Cigar City Oatmeal Dark brew I ordered with my meal. Delicious!\\n\\nWe passed on dessert because we were so full, but our meal came out to be about $120 (with tip), so I felt this was actually very reasonable for the quality of the food and drinks.

Yes, you are at Disney, but we had far better elsewhere for less money. We had the fish of the day which was seared grouper. What they neglected to tell us was that the fish of the day is served as a salad. You get a piece of fish about the size of a hockey puck on top of some lettuce. The fish was good, but the salad part was not. I left hungry. We also got the bison burger which was a joke. It is served on toast. If you open the toast up, the burger itself is minuscule.

The sampler is served with two large pieces of thick buttered toast, and two blocks of cornbread. \\n\\nThe fries were tasty, but when you mix fries, bacon, and cheese...it's kind of impossible to lose. \\n\\nThe cornbread was fluffier than I would've expected, and had just the right amount of sweetness. The hushpuppies were perfect. It's been a while since I've had hushpuppies, period, and to bite into these were heavenly.

If I'm raving about the carb-loading sides....there may be some issue with the meats. \\n\\nQuarter chicken dark meat- The skin was smokey enough, but the meat itself while plenty moist (which is good!) did not seem to have enough smoke flavor. It's like if you didn't eat every bit of skin with every bite of meat, it would've been very pedestrian. \\n\\nBrisket- The outer bark was tasty...but the rest of the meat kind of reminded me of the brisket at Community BBQ- in a word- uninspiring. Not much flavor in the meat where it matters. \\n\\nRibs- Their ribs had a good rub and a decent smoke ring- was not overpowering in terms of flavor, but could hold their own without using any sauce. This was probably the better meat compared to all the rest. Meat was a little bit on the tough side though- normally ribs should be pretty easy to cut- but these guys took some work. \\n\\nPulled Pork- Some bites were smokey, other bites were bland. Pairing the pork with their plethora of sauce options was fun, but yea, just ok. \\n\\nWhile I wouldn't mind coming back per se, I think Smoke and Duck Sauce have the upper hand if it came down to a head-to-head competition."},{"name":"The One Sushi +","address":"2523 Caldwell Rd NE, Ste 1000","city":"Brookhaven","stars":"4","text":"Make sure you aks for David!

I can without hesitation endorse the stuffed jalapenos. Golden Potato crust filled with cream cheese sounds on par with every other place in Austin. Texican takes it to another level pairing it with red jalapeno jelly. The balance of sweet and spicy is miles ahead of the mundane and normal ranch dressing.\\n\\nNext on my list would be the Tilapia Cozumel. Grilled filets with charred tomatoes, green bells, onions, and whole serrano peppers. If that wasn't enough on the plate it also arrives with a shrimp enchilada, guacamole, pico, rice and beans.

First, the place smells like a cross between a Taiwanese wet market at day's end and back alley undertaker's cellar in Mogadishu. Second, the upstairs dining room has uncontrolled and unventilated moisture. Even worse, black mold was visible on the window sills and there was significant moisture damage. There were pieces of drywall falling from the holes around the window sills. The restaurant placed residential grade dehumidifiers in a futile effort to control moisture and condensation from all the steaming hot pots. The place needs commercial grade exhaust fans over every table. How they passed code enforcement, we will never know; the secret lies in the lurid backrooms. Third, the quality of the raw ingredients was poor at best. The dumplings were minute, flaccid and filled with mystery flesh. The ma la broth was neither ma nor la. It was bland enough for the weak stomachs of the Newton-Wellesley \\"foodie\\" hordes I suppose. Worst of all, they charged us $12 for a refill of the fetid broth which what looked like dishwater or more likely, melted snow bank water from Harrison Ave. Adding insult to injury, they filled the ma la broth with this nasty liquid, further diluting it to the joy of all of Wayland. Fourth, you never got the impression that the place is even close to hygienic. The carpets were filthy, the ladles looked like they were purchased used from the Cultural Revolution closeout sale. Worst of all, the men's room smelled like urine and looked like it hadn't been cleaned all week. Clearly, squalor is the overriding theme here. Hepatitis B for all!

We got a margarita pizza with fresh mozzarella and it was pretty good. I'd come here again and try out the other menu items. I wouldn't get the same pizza because the sauce was a little too sweet for me so I wouldn't order something that has mainly just sauce and hardly any cheese or toppings. I didn't like how inconsistent the cutting job was. Whoever cut it did a pretty bad job. They forgot to cut through the middle. Not a big deal but just wasn't a pretty pizza.

The staff was friendly and welcoming even with our 2 kids. While it's not \\"kid friendly\\" I wouldn't say that it's so formal that I wouldn't bring my kids for a nice meal.\\n\\nWe started with the lobster tacos which were really good.  Nice, crispy pieces of lobster wrapped in tortilla with slaw that provided moisture and tang.  My 7 yr old at first refused to order the lobster tacos for dinner but one bite and he wished he had, too bad, he only got 1 taco.  We also shared the farmer's salad which was fresh with lots of smoked bacon and egg.  We also ordered the gruyere biscuits which buttery, warm, cheesey and just melted in your mouth.  Everybody loved them so much that we had to order an extra plate.\\n\\nMy husband had a fish special which if I remember correctly at the time was wrapped in chorizo.  It was tasty and fresh served with a bean puree.  I had the steak frites which as perfect. I didn't care too much for the sauce served on the side, but the steak was cooked perfectly medium rare. The truffle fries were the best.  Light and crispy, thin with a really nice truffle essence.  I did Not want to share!  We worked with the staff to make the kids a pasta with cheese. I expected a plain (dry) pasta with some grated parm on top but this was housemade pasta with a cheesey sauce.  It was really good and the kids enjoyed it.\\n\\nThe one downside to the meal was dessert.  We ordered the pigtails and were disappointed.  They're like churros, fried dough, but not as good as the best churros I've had. It had some sauces on the side but the pigtails themselves lacked flavor and oomph. I would definitely not recommend the pigtails and try something else instead.\\n\\nService was great. The place got full but servers were attentive and friendly.\\n\\nOverall, we had a really great meal- nice, fresh food, tasty and prepared well. My 7 yr old asked if we could come back the next day.\\n\\nGo again?

We sat down and ordered a few more drinks, these came on time. We ordered 1 appetizer and 2 entrees. After seeing the table next to us (who sat down about 30 minutes after we were seated) receive their entrees, we inquired about our appetizer. We were told the kitchen was backed up from a larger party, and it would be out shortly. We then received the cold appetizer and began waiting for our entrees. After sitting for a bit longer (it had now been over 1.5 hours since we arrived) we told our server we would like to forfeit our entrees, receive the check, and go home.

This is where the real deal of authentic Italian meets the best the NW has to offer.  \\n\\nIf you just want good eats and more casual eat off the bar menu, its a little like tapas italian style.  There are a lot of good items on the bar menu but they are not as complex as the Dinner menu.  \\n\\nYou can not judge the restaurant by what it serves in the bar they are almost two different things.  Granted you can order off the dinner menu in the bar too.\\n\\nAnd the wine list is ever expanding and amazing as usual.  If Marco is there ask him for a wine recomendation and if not ask the bar tenders they have a great read on what is drinking well in the vast collection."},{"name":"Noodles & Company","address":"100 NW 10th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"I love the variety in this menu.\\n\\nYou can go out with your friends and you don't have to decide together what you feel like having.

Of all the dishes, it was our favorite..However,  there were many.  \\n\\nOnto the Comida Fria where we munched through the House Cured Salmon and Boquerones with abundance.  All were great, fresh and flavorful.  We moved over to the Comida Caliente.  We stretched our palates with the Brandada a baked salted cod \\"cazuela\\" if you will.  Cod and mashers mixed together, made for light, creamy salty bites.  The grilled lamb brochette arrived on three skewers and again, bite size perfectly cooked lamb munchables.  This was accompanied with a cucumber mint salad which worked perfectly for this ex-pat.  Along those lines, we also got the Braised Oxtail in a red wine reduction sauce.  This was also executed well, served a top a mound of mashed potatoes.  I would of liked to have a little salt added, regardless of that, it was devoured quickly.  We ended up our mains with the pigs feet terrine.  Visually the most appealing dish of the night.  It was fatty, tasty and actually at this point we couldn't finish it.  We had already plowed through 8 of their offerings and we were tapa-ed.  \\n\\nHowever, the Mattimator made us aware of their desert menu.  We had also been watching the chef preparing one after another.  We dived into the Mel I Mato.. Goat Cheese mousse, walnut torte, oloros ice cream honeycomb, sherry gastrique.. YO!

We said, \\"Yes, our birthdays.\\" When we arrived, we were seated at a table modestly and tastefully decorated in birthday motif. \\n\\nOur server provided a thorough explanation of the steaks, types of rubs, and cooking methods. He also described what other dishes were when asked, and, he told us of an unadvertised special only when one of the diners at our table ordered one of the steaks. \\n\\nTwo of us ordered the peppercorn NY strip steak and after the first bite both agreed that it was delicious.  The steak is accompanied by the \\"proprietary\\" F17 sauce in a small cordial-like container. We found no need for the sauce. \\n\\nLamb and filet mignon rounded out our entrees. Appetizer was the baked Brie and calamari; the side was Fleming's potatoes (think au gratin).

It's more like gobs of tapioca or snot. \\nMom: You are awful and that sounds like it is too. Here's your father...)\\n\\nI ordered Taro Milk Tea upon the recommendation of my fellow Yelpers. I don't know if Taro and milk are separate things, or if Taro Milk is a thing, but this was so AWESOME! It had a slight taste of popcorn (not like those ATROCIOUS jelly beans though) but was so delicious. The boba made me laugh when they went up the straw. It's an odd feeling, but so fun to drink/eat, an enjoyable experience of consumption quite unlike any other. \\n\\nShe ordered Bobatron, which was the special, and pictured as a robot with strawberry and lychee in his belly. His eyes were boba. I don't know what the connection between robots and bubble tea is, but I think it might be that robots love it. It makes sense because... well they just would! Strawberry and lychee tea with boba, and dear lord it was so amazing. She proclaimed that she will never come down to visit again unless I promise her more bubble tea, and at $3.50 I will certainly oblige. \\n\\nWe also bought one mochi (best described as a chewy-on-the-outside ice cream dumpling) of the chocalate espresso persuasion, and enjoyed it tremendously. Delicious on the outside and inside, it was more frozen than those I've had in the past, and thus easier and less messy to eat. I recommend only getting the one unless you are a big ice cream fan, because it was very sweet. I think it cost about a dollar. \\n\\nIt felt like a cute, romantic date, even though we've been on many. We sat in the park across the street in from of Grendel's and enjoyed some street music.

The idea certainly speaks to the kid in me, and they perform their makeover here with aplomb--the vault is preserved as a room where you can sip your coffee, the tables are made with the bulletproof material that protects bank tellers, and there are benches made from safe-deposit boxes. \\n\\nSo I went there a few times, ordered dark coffee, a soy latte, a pot of jasmine tea. All of these things would score highly on my personal best-of-Boston scale. But it was the mocha I really LOVED. Bloc 11 is the establishment that brought back the mocha for me. It's so rich and thick and chocolaty, it makes the Starbucks version look like it was a new chocolate vitamin water flavor. \\n\\nThe checkmate on Starbucks (and a lot of the others out there) is that this place is acutely aware of its surroundings. Considering all the artists in the Union area, it's appropriate that the cafe hangs local art and features a second-floor art gallery space. Like Diesel, you can sit and study or socialize for a while. Still, whilst I enjoy the novelty of the vault/extensive back rooms, I can't sit back there because it's too stuffy.

I suspect she also made the drinks and desserts, because she disappeared, and only reappeared to deliver the goods.\\n\\nThe dessert itself was OK, I guess.  My brownie fudge sundae was average ice cream on an average brownie, covered with average fudge.

To conserve water, like most hotels you must leave the towels on the floor to be replaced. Most hotels, atleast in my experience, change your sheets atleast every 3 days without saying, but here, they don't, there's no card you can put on the bed to tell them to change it either, so you have to make a phone call to housekeeping, which is a pain in the butt if you ask me.

I understand that some people want the fat on their brisket so I am completely fine that the fat was still on it. But I am not a fan of the fat on a brisket so by the time I trimmed my fat off my brisket I had 5 bite sized pieces of brisket for $18. The brisket I did have tasted good but was not great.

During the dinner time though some of the empty sauce containers may not be replenished. I remember asking an employee about a particular sauce ( yum - yum ) container that was empty and the answer was that the sauce is over. Umm, do you not stock enough to last the day? I took a star off for this and the slow service.\\n\\nComing to the grille-rs, all of them are courteous and friendly. They particularly ask me if I would like my bowl's contents sectioned off on the grill since I am a vegetarian. Also, for people with food allergies, they prepare it separately inside the kitchen away from the main grill, but you have to mention it to them in particular. They are lively and sing funny songs especially when you tip them. They also tend to get flirty sometimes but overall they are very accommodating with how you want your food cooked. They seek your inputs if there aren't many people waiting for their food to be grilled.\\n\\nI haven't tried the soup and salad bar anytime since I am not big on salads or soups either.

Here on a mission, now residing in Chelsea, MA. In my work, I am not surrounded by the most culinary of cultures. Yet I am determined to learn the lay of the land, no matter how inconsispicuous it may sometimes be. My home in Chelsea is located about 15 to 20 minutes outside of what I thus far know to be the pulse of Boston's food scene. The nearest eaterie ist the nearby Dunkin Donuts and  I am privileged to once again have the ease of access to the convenience of the corner stores not too far away.\\n\\nNonetheless, on one of my lazy off days, I determined to by the end of the day visit a local, sorta eccentric, no chain restaurant. Chelsea so far appears to be a predominantly Hispanic community, strongly influencing the choices available. Two blucks up, maybe a four minute walk, stands Carnitas del Montecristo. It was simply convenient, nonetheless, worthwhile choice in being so close. Ive tasted their pupusa while scouting the area for apartments and its dimmed \\"Open\\" neon light teases me each morning as I await the arrival of the city bus no more than two yards from its door. But this time, it was my final stop. \\n\\nI made my way to the counter, thoroughly examining the menu time and again, in hopes to select a item that would not only breed a broad understanding of the Mexian cuisine but also an idea of what Montecristo was all about. My careful study of the menu apparently tested the patience of the woman on the other sided of the counter, no more appeased by my determination to also understand and speak the language. I timidly ordered in Spanish, using as few words as necessary. My first words were something like, \\"Yo quiero comprar una gordita por favor.\\" As I waited, I sipped on a glass of horchata.\\n\\nHorchata has become for me  A ritual at pretty much any restaurant offering it. There is more to horchata than I know, but it is a traditional Mexican drink of ground rice, cinnamon, sugar, and vanilla resulting in a milky concoction.  Other cultures featured other grains, originally barley but a personal favorite of mine is the Puerto Rican ajon joli- or sesame seeds. Here at Montecristo it was sweet with an almost roasted flavor. I'd say it was creamy other than the textured bits I'd guess to be cinnamon, lending to the brown color. But enough about horchata; my gosrdita is getting cold.\\n\\nThe \\"little fat one\\", more affectionaly termed gordita, arrived to the table trying to hold itself together. It is by definition a small yet thick tortilla, typically fried and stuffed. Mine was actually two tortillas, one on top and one on the bottom, spread with deliciously charred chicken, beans,and the melty goodness of cheese, complemented by the crisp lettuce and tomato and the cool of sour cream- all stuffed between a crispy, yet tender \\"bun\\" of tortillas, called a gordita. Who needs seven layer dip? The accompaniying green chile sauce, however didn't seem to do much for the dish. It had a bit of heat but was actually cool in temperature. Unfortunately, so was my next course. \\nAs I made my way through the gordita which was enough to be a meal on its own, my main course was presented to me, a dish they call Carne Poblana. On the plate was carne asada, a skewers of grilled shrimp and peppers, and chorizo,with a backdrop of beans, rice, and a small salad. accompanied by pico de gallo and two tortillas, those fluffy sidekicks; I guess they were by definition gorditas just short of of frying and stuffing. Besides the tortillas, the dish fell flat. It was decent but not worth a journey.\\nThat considered, I still finished on a positive note- the same note with which I introduced this ballad, the harmony flowing from the same cup of horchata that began the meal. A pleasant evening, considering that I had only walked two blocks from my otherwise captivating couch (from which I write you this story. SImple food, that seems to be defined by the grill, but certainly a place for a good pick me up, especially those gorditas.

This place is not accessible at all. The only reason I was able to get in was because I had a friend with me who was able to get me up and down the step to get in and out. So if you're disabled and traveling alone, you probably won't be able to eat here.\\n\\nThat said, though, after visiting a friend in Tufts Medical Center down the street, this way a nice place to get a quick, easy, and economical dinner. I kind of wish I had gotten something I can't get easily where I live, like I usually do when I have the opportunity, and had tried something like the shwarma or the falafel. But I was tired and wanted something familiar, so I got a chicken bacon ranch sandwich. It was good. My friend enjoyed a couple slices of buffalo chicken pizza. I had a piece of the peanut butter cookie she got for dessert and that was really good, too. I understand they make them right there.\\n\\nIf there's a bathroom in this place, it's probably only for staff. I don't remember seeing any sign of one.

Gilbert's Wood Fired Steaks & Seafood Columbus","address":"1 E Campus View Blvd","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"I've been a big fan of J Gilbert's for quite some time, but hadn't been back in a little while because I've been avoiding the area around J Gilbert's due to the traffic mess from the I-270/US-23 interchange construction. Regardless, Columbus Restaurant Week back in January enticed me to dine here again. \\n\\nFrom the outside, the building looks like a random office building... but the interior of this restaurant has an intimate and comfortable atmosphere. I prefer restaurant interiors to be more brightly lit (J Gilbert's is pretty dark), but that's a personal preference.\\n\\nThe service here has been consistently solid, and I honestly can't think of a bad example of the service here. \\n\\nIn terms of food, their meat and seafood are mostly wood fire grilled. This gives their steaks a delicious smokey flavor to it. I believe this is probably the one thing that really sets J. Gilbert's apart from the other prime steakhouses in town. A steak purist might argue that the smoke flavor masks the pure concentrated beef flavor from aged steak... but I think most of us don't care enough about that, and would prefer the wood fired flavor. Plus J Gilberts does a better job of seasoning their steaks than every other steakhouse in town with probably the exception of Ruth Chris. Their sides are also consistently delicious. \\n\\nWith that said, we're talking about a prime steakhouse here, so they are pretty pricy. You should expect to spend at least $50/person when you dine here. But on the other hand, they don't nickle and dime you like other prime steakhouses do! Your steak actually comes with 2 sides, compared to other steakhouses where you need to spend another $10~$20 per side dish. They also offer prix-fixe 3 course meals all the time as well, not just during restaurant week.\\n\\nLooking strictly at how tasty the steaks are, I would say J. Gilbert's is tied with Smith & Wollensky and slightly behind Ruth Chris. But when you look at the cost differential, J. Gilbert's I might argue is the best steakhouse in Columbus.\\n\\nWhile it may sound silly to talk about budget when you're comparing something so inherently expensive and luxurious as prime steakhouses, I think price still matters to most of us! With that said, J. Gilbert's is highly recommended in my books."},{"name":"Miller's Ale House - Orlando","address":"8963 International Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"Came here late night for drinks while visiting, met a great bartender Elese.

This drives me crazy because so much of it sticks to the lettuce and can't be picked up by the chips.  The salsa was not homemade and was watery.  We also ordered queso which should be avoided at all costs.  It was more watery than the salsa and appeared to be made from fake or processed cheese as it quickly became inexplicably gritty.

Service started out really strong, but at end of the meal -- when the restaurant was much more crowded -- we waited for long periods of time and had to flag down our server. He was good, though -- polite and knowledgeable.\\n\\nFOOD.  Bread and a red pepper/olive oil spread are delivered to every table. The bread was fresh and tasty, and so was the spread. Great stuff! I started w/the Caesar Salad (anchovies on the side). It was a decent Caesar, not bad but nothing distinctive. The Crab Cake appetizer was the high point of the meal. Specifically, the lemon-garlic aioli and the saffron sauce (tasted kinda like hollandaise to me) were really well spiced and flavorful. The two crab cakes themselves were large, moist, and tasty. This appetizer is a \\"must-get.\\" We split a Beef Tenderloin Risotto, just because this sounded interesting to me. Unfortunately, beef doesn't seem to go to well in risotto. It would've been great except the beef was just weird in there. Otherwise, the risotto was perfectly cooked and really tasty. We then split 2 entrees: Chicken Parmigiana and Pork Tenderloin. The Chicken Parm was spiced lightly, cooked nicely, and was a decent size. The linguini was done well too -- not too al dente, but not overcooked. I really like the red sauce here -- it's thick and rich, a bit like tomato paste (that's how I like my red sauce).  The Pork Tenderloin wasn't that good. Although the pork itself was a nicely cooked piece of meat, the balsamic was way too strong and totally overpowered the dish. It was served on top of really bad mashed potatoes -- watery, with zero spice (tasted like boxed mashed potatoes after too much water was mistakenly added). So I'd stay away from that dish. We didn't get dessert or coffee.\\n\\nOverall, Porcini's is decent, but for the price (especially in a relatively low-rent location), you can probably do better. I'd go back there if I was with someone who really wanted to return there, but I wouldn't suggest it on my own."},{"name":"Alamo Roast Beef & Seafood","address":"21 Salem St","city":"Medford","stars":"4","text":"Love this place,  roast beef sandwiches on fresh onion rolls are excellent, tacos are also very good!"},{"name":"Century Bar","address":"930 SE Sandy Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"3","text":"I was called a \\"drunk ass cunt\\" by your female bouncer/worker with braids.

Tonight was our first visit and I cannot believe we haven't come sooner. We've driven past a few times and always said \\"oh we'll have to do dinner there some evening.\\" Well, tonight ended up being the evening we remembered \\"that place we always drive past.\\" We called ahead and made a reservation, being a Friday night and unsure of how busy it would be. I wish I could remember the hostess' name. She was very polite and sweet on the phone and when we arrived. We were quickly seated and our server, Vin/Vinni (Vinnicius on the check), greeted us almost as soon as we were seated. I ordered a large pour of Ruffino and my boyfriend ordered a Manhattan. The wine temperature was perfect and my boyfriend said it was excellent. Our server brought out the parmesan baguette the came with two different cheese blend spreads. Vinni was very attentive but his presence wasn't a nuisance or overdone either. We ordered a bottle of the Ruffino after we finished out drinks. We had a good laugh with our server because the Ruffino bottles are smaller and he had quite a time getting the cork out, as the corkscrew didn't want to rest on the bottle correctly for him to pull out the cork. He was slightly embarrassed and apologetic, but we found it to be one of the highlights of our evening. Food wise, I ordered the filet mignon and asparagus and my boyfriend ordered the Alaskan crab legs and chipotle macaroni and cheese. Our server brought out butter over an oil wick warmer for my boyfriend's crab. My steak was cooked to perfection and was quite possibly the best steak I have ever had (the previous title which I had reserved for Ruth's Chris). The asparagus was heavenly and, hands down, was the best I've had. My boyfriend said his crab was good but was a tad fishy, but he ate it all, along with the rest of the steak I didn't finish. He really like the chipotle macaroni. He said it had the smokey pepper flavor but it wasn't spicey. I tried it and it was delicious. We were too full for dessert but my boyfriend ordered a latte. Vinni brought our check and boxed up our remaining food. Overall, Fleming's is exactly the steakhouse you want it to be: perfect. The location is easy to access, the restaurant is clean as a whistle, the staff is friendly and on point with customer service, the food is fantastic and the price is reasonable for the quality.

Generally I'll be able to fully describe my meal, but I was just shocked and speechless, I'm not sure how to explain the dishes. The first course of snacks was no joke.

If you really count the number of plates they bring out to you, you probably get to try 20 plates of different food. Yes, 20 plates with beautiful food for ants! Yes, if you're worried about portions, they look like bite sizes but they get pretty hefty for the last half of the meal. It's a trip; your eyes, stomach, and brain will be so confused at the end of the meal. Every course was so delicate and detailed. Like did the chef use tweezers to put this piece of art together?! My vote for the trippiest dish was the seared beet that looked like a piece of salmon. Another dish was one of the desserts that was an ice cream, but it looked like chicken salad from the deli.

I have eaten serious food in Melbourne and Sydney, Australia, as well as San Francisco and Los Angeles. I worked a little in kitchens (not that I am a great cook, but I know my way around). This food is serious. It has balls. To quote Team America: \\"I like balls\\". Not everyone will like it, because it is brave and it is real and it uses heat and spice and acidity and the funk of fish sauce. If you don't like it, spend some time getting used to the real heat and the real savory flavors of Asian cuisines and come back to it. It is brave as hell to do food like this and it deserves support. We went twice in three days.\\n\\nOysters: Awesome! I normally like my oysters natural or not at all. They are delicious little things and it's rare for them to be improved by anything other than a little squeeze of lemon. Mignonette always stays on the platter when I'm around and cocktail sauce is a grievous insult. These came with what was essentially a nuoc cham. Sort of straightforward, but requires a deft touch to balance. It was dead on. Oysters were fresh and the dressing lifted them. I looked my dining companion in the eye and high fived him! We ordered another oyster at the end of the meal. On our second night, it was a different variety of oyster. Just as good, and good to know they are selecting the best oysters on any day and not just going with one choice.\\n\\nScallop Sashimi: Righteous. Lovely discs of raw scallop came with a sauce of ahi amarillo and pink pepporcorn. Real heat in that sauce. Ahi amarillo is a chili used in Peruvian cuisine, that I have not come across before. Using this chilli instead of something more trad SE or NE Asian brought a lightness to the dish that really worked, and also shows the unconstrained nature of the cooking here.\\n\\nChicken \\"Lollipops\\" w Sriracha Mayo: Were I to get drunk, I could eat these until I exploded. Deep fried and served with Sriracha mayo. Coating is crisp and totally on point. Probably some rice flour? And oil is at the right temp when they fry that sucker.\\n\\nKale and candied bacon: Hilarious. Delicious. Who deep fries Kale?\\n\\nPickles and kim-chi: Great house-made pickles and kim-chi. Fennel pickled in rice wine vinegar? Look, why not? Later featured in a drink of an epic nature (see below).\\n\\nPork and Nettle Pancakes: With tahini and maple? Seriously? How can this work? Then you get a little kick of chili in that sauce and it's just wtf. I understand how people read the menu and think THIS MAKES NO SENSE. Look, those people are not wrong, it doesn't make sense. Until you put it in your mouth.\\n\\nPork noodles with black bean and pineapple: I enjoyed this, but it was the only dish that I wasn't speechless over. Black bean was slightly too salty for me (though balanced by the sweetness of the pineapple when you got that in a mouthful of it). I probably could have taken the salt better if I hadn't already eaten a meal at Luce earlier in the day!\\n\\nOxtail curry: Would love to know exactly how this was made. Oxtail takes a long time to braise yet the curry was fragrant and aromatic. Long cooking takes aromatics and reduces them into a savory amalgam, losing fragrant and floral notes. I am going to guess that the curry base resembled a Rendang. And I am guessing the oxtail was braised separate from the curry for a while. Came with a scotch bonnet paste, a kind of Jamaican chili. The paste was more reminiscent of a harissa than a sambal, but it definitely worked. The chili provided a high end, fruity but dry heat, with less mid-palate or wetness than many Asian chilis. It was very hot. Myself and my dining companion consumed it all, putting dabs on in time to the Tupac track playing in the background. It's hot though, take care.\\n\\nThe drinks: We ordered two drinks on our first night. Mine was \\"The Scotch\\". I can't remember my companion's drink. I asked the bartender to avoid sugar syrup and he said they don't use any anyway. This is a great sign - I want to taste the ingredients, not sugar. After our first round it was clear they knew what they were doing and I ordered \\"anything you want to make\\". The second round included the best cocktail I have ever had: Tequila, mezcal, cynar (an Italian artichoke liquer), lime juice, lemon juice and orange bitters. Complex, smokey, savory, acid. It was the business. We ordered it again the second night and he nailed it again. By then, we had full faith. I gave him a challenge: make a whiskey and pickle juice that doesn't taste horrible and make you hate yourself. Challenge was accepted. Kim-chi base, fennel pickle juice, a little lime and bourbon (I think, or whiskey?). Sounds: ridiculous and horrible, was fantastic. We were just laughing out loud at how good it was.\\n\\nThese guys \\"get it\\". Both the bar and the kitchen. It won't be to everyone's taste, but if you want to see some of the most creative and funky and exciting food the world has to offer, you need to come here."},{"name":"Story Book Dining at Artist Point with Snow White","address":"901 Timberline Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"When we made our Disney plans, this was a 1 entitlement meal.

They came out luke warm oysters in shells with ice cold lump crab meat on top.  Had a very strong fishy smell and taste.  Not good at all.  Wife had a salad as an appetizer that was mediocre at best.\\n\\nWe both got the New York strip as our main.  Mine was butchered horribly and had a huge, thick tendon running through it.  It was cooked perfectly, but there was no flavor or seasoning on the meat.  Apparently they also feel that their chef is perfect in that there's no salt or pepper on any table.  The regular price of that mediocre NY strip was $42.  I guess it's easier to swallow that bitter pill after you've pre-paid for your meal plan.  I can't imagine going out to a restaurant in Philly, or anywhere for that matter, and paying $42 for a flavorless, albeit perfectly cooked, slab of beef.\\n\\nDesert was a really really good creme br√ªl√©e.

Have been a fan of the restaurant for years, though.  First off- the new ambiance is quite nice- warmer and less stark than before.  Same excellent, helpful service- Sam is great.   The menu is interesting- lots of  flavor details for each dish. We all decided to go for the 4 course $55 meal- choosing 1 item from each of the 4 categories- 2 appetizer sections, a main and a dessert. First up came rye rolls with smoked butter(!!) which were fabulous- we knew we were in for something.   2 orders of crab with amaranth, 1 mushroom dish, and 1 dish of scallops with beets and grapefruit.  all were very interesting- smallish portions, but well prepared and well plated, and satisfying.  Next were salsify with bone marrow breadcrumbs- (better than it sounds! ) and roasted potatoes and sunchokes with herb aioli- same- excellent quality and taste.  Dinner was 2 duck and lamb.  Duck breast- sliced and served with a paste of black garlic and roasted blue carrots.  Lamb- with squash cut into ball shapes.  Dessert- each had its own icecream- very good! \\nAlthough it sounds and looks like a \\"fussy\\" menu- it is not!  The flavors go very well together and it is very subtle.\\nAll this being said- it is definitely a place to go to with the right frame of mind.  If you want cheap food prepared in very un original ways- go elsewhere.  if you want to be impressed and try things prepared in new ways, using excellent and new ingredients- this is the place!\\nWe all left contented and satisfied- not hungry in the least"},{"name":"Dots Cafe","address":"2521 SE Clinton St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Giant menu, giant space, perfect for a late night hang. \\n\\nWent on valentines day when everywhere else was full.

The first time he rudely told me I could toast my bagel at home, and this past encounter was the reason I will never return to this location. I have both sesame and salmon allergies so I simply asked him to use a new knife to cut my bagel with. He responded by saying \\"we don't cut salmon with these knives but I can wash it\\". His idea of washing it was dunking the knife into a sanitizer bucket then immediately cutting my bagel with the dripping knife, apparently there was no need to wipe the knife down. I also politely asked to have cream cheese on both sides of my bagel because I know that is not the norm at Brueggers... And of course I did not receive that simple request.

Everyone ordered alternates. Twenty more minutes pass. Burgers come without any sides at all, waitress says they are out of all of them. No apology. It actually just seemed like they didn't want to be cooking anymore.

Everyone there was super nice. They were in the midst of repainting so the place looked a bit disheveled. The smell of smoke was great though and i am easily enticed by smoke.\\nSince this is way out of my way, I asked the nice girl at the register what I should get. She said everyone likes the ox tails. So I went with those, the rib tips, potato salad and beans and rice.\\nAS soon as I got back to my car, I popped all the containers open to take a few bites before driving home. First the potato salad. It was bright yellow store bought with some paprika on top. Then the ox tails. First the smell. It smelled terrible. but what do I know, I went in for a bite and the taste was twice as bad as the smell. When I got home I tried them again. I would have sworn they were bad. I feel fine today though, so they just tasted bad. I am happy about that.\\nLastly the rib tips. I smoke pork ribs all the time. I love me some juicy, smokey, rib tips. These were a little juicy, mostly dry, kind of smokey, and covered in cheap barbecue sauce.  \\nMy two biggest complaints were that nothing tasted fresh and that they used store bought taters and sauce. Potato salad is easy to make. It can be made every other day and hold up real well. barbecue sauce is also easy to make. start it every morning when you start up the smoker. let is simmer all day.

They obviously take their time with the product and the rub / spices they use on their brisket is as good as any I've had. \\n\\nBut good BBQ is more than just the meat.\\n\\nMy main issue so far is with the sides generally. (And since I've only been there once my opinion may evolve.) \\n\\nI'll focus on the baked beans. The meat found in baked beans should compliment and not dominate the dish. And that's what I think happened here. Too much meat mixed in with the beans. Also the sauce used in the beans is way too sweet. I'm a fan of vinegar- and not sweet barbecue sauce. So this might be peculiar to me. But, still, I think that catering to those with a sweet-craving pallet works fine for fast food. That's why i don't eat fast food. BBQ should not be a study in marketing. It should be true to its roots (whatever they may actually be) and stay subtle and understated. \\n\\nI'll give them higher marks for their collards. But, again, too much meat in the collards. It should compliment and not dominate the greens. \\n\\nThis review is disjointed because I don't like to review a place until I've eaten there at least more than once (unless there's obviously no reason to do so...).\\n\\nAlso, the service is obviously a youngish crew with probably limited experience. Call me old fashioned. But I think the lady who takes my order should be able to articulate menu items the first time I ask and not have to repeat herself several times. It doesn't take much to just talk properly the first time. I'll give the crew a few weeks to learn the ropes and come back.\\n\\nSo, to be continued...\\n\\n\\nAlso -- to be giving this place 5 stars in a town where we have Fox Bros., Community BBQ, Fat Matts, etc... this is some serious grade inflation. \\n\\nThis place is really good. BUT, RESPECTFULLY, IT IS NOT FIVE STAR MATERIAL. It is not in the same league as the aforementioned establishments. I may end up rating it four stars if they clean up their sides and service.
