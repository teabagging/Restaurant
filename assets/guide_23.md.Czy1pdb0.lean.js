At first I only noticed their grocery market and in fact I went there to buy some goat meat, which I will say quite fresh and tender and reasonably priced. Only upon entering the supermarket I have realized, attached to it is their restaurant as well. And i'm so glad I did. \\n\\nAl-Amin is a Bengali/Bangladeshi restaurant that serves mix of Bengali(cuisine from the western state of India called West Bengal) and Bangladeshi food. The owners of this restaurant are Bangladeshis, so you can count on authentic, homestyle food from this place. \\n\\nBuford highway has two other Bangladeshi eateries - Panahar and Bismillah cafe. Al-Amin is not a full service restaurant as Panahar nor just a take-out place like Bismillah cafe. Instead they have opted for simple, order-eat-go style. So you pick your food from the menu(or appetizers inside glass display), pay for it and eat or take it to-go. They have about 4 tables with 4 chairs each and two bar tables with two chairs each for eating at the restaurant.\\n\\nSo few of our friends decided to check the restaurant other day and ordered these items.\\n\\n1) Samosas - both vegetable & chicken\\n2) Chotpoti - Popular roadside Bengali dish made mainly of chickpeas, potato and tamarind tangy-sweet sauce.\\n3) Beef boti Kabob\\n4) Biriyanis(chicken & Goat)\\n5) Curries - both Egg, chicken and beef curry.\\n6) Chana Masala - dish made of chickpeas, usually eaten along with naan/bread or rice. \\n7) Muglai Paratha - this dish that reminds me of 'Roti telur' in Malaysian restaurants, except here it is a deep-fried bread stuffed with scrambled eggs, onions and spiced mildly.\\n\\nWe liked both chicken and vegetable Samosas but we preferred vegetable samosa's better. Also it would be a sin to go this eatery and not try chotpoti - a Potato, chickpeas and sweet-tangy tamarind sauce delicious goodness. Both chicken and goat biriyani were tasty with enough pieces of meats and not greasy at all.\\n\\nEgg, chicken and beef curries were made in proper curry style, not in some sweet & greasy sauce that some non-authentic Indian restaurant makes these days. And all these curries are just below $6. That, I would say, a great deal.\\n\\nNow for things we didn't like - The beef boti kabob we got was completely dry and some pieces were burnt so much that it was bitter. Also I found chana masala to be very bland and not so flavorful. \\n\\nI should mention the service at Al-Amin. For a restaurant of this style, the lady at the counter was very polite, prompt, very helpful and best of all, always smiling. When we queried about the menu, she suggested some of their must-try. In my opinion, this is what makes a restaurant experience from ordinary to extra-ordinary. I was only going to give them four-stars but they deserve an extra star for their customer service.\\n\\nAl-Amin is yet another one in growing list of little gems in Buford Highway.\\n\\nFive stars."},{"name":"Cafe Matisse","address":"9700 International Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3","text":"Very good food, good dervice, and reasonable price.

We did wish we had requested more saltines. \\nWe had the octopus appetizer and it was excellent. We enjoyed our meals, I had the grouper in dill sauce and he had the duck poached swordfish. However, I would say that the best entree at our table was the fish and chips. The only thing I really didn't like was the 'beignet style' hush puppies. I have had many different hush puppies in my life including sweet ones but these just missed the mark.

So their seating is on a show up basis and no reservations.   I don't mind that, cause this allows you to relax and spend some time here.   So they have a side patio where you can sit and enjoy a cocktail from their menu.  The neat thing is this allows a nice conversation, chill relax atmosphere.   It's defiantly got the eastside vibe which is fine with me.  The cocktail waitress could have a little more personality, but she got us our drinks fairly quick.   Like I said though, the atmosphere is really relaxed and allows you to enjoy yourself.\\n\\nOnce called in, not sure what the wait was, but we were in no hurry. (Like 45 min) We sat inside and place kinda has an urban swanky diner feel to it.   Our waitress was great!!!   The beef carpaccio and fried oysters were great!!!   The hanger steak and Cripsy ribs were not bad!   The ribs fell right off the bone.    They had a good little selection of beer as well...   All in all, for our first time there, we enjoyed the whole experience.\\n\\nTips:   Some people are heavy set in their ways and quick to want to criticize a joint!  So venturing out to new places, like this one, take a slow approach and the establishment to what they do.   Launderette did a great job from start to finish.   As far as a wait, I think a little 30-60 min wait isn't a bad thing.   Everyone's in a hurry to do nothing.   Having some pre dinner cocktails creates the mood, and develops your appetite.  \\n\\nGood job on the concept and build.

This is the oldest restaurant in the U.S. and it looks like it (in a good way). It sits right on the freedom trail (a must do in Boston) and is about halfway through. I would recommend to walk the freedom trail beginning about 10am and you should hit this place about lunch time.\\n\\nWhile they are the oldest restaurant in the U.S., they certainly are not the best. Service is very informal, we were told to grab a table of our choosing. We ordered a raw sampler, oysters, clams and shrimp which all tasted good but not great. I had the chowder. It was good but was done in a more thick style. Toward the end of my chowder, I started to feel ill.\\n\\nI had fish as an entree, I think it was Boston Scrod. It came with fries and Boston Baked Beans. The fries were cold and the beans comparable to something from a can. The fish was dry and just so-so. I hardly ate the entree.\\n\\nThe service was very iffy, the waitress seemed to care but maybe they were short staffed or just did not feel like hustling. I wanted to get out of there and back to the hotel quickly as I was starting to feel very sick to my stomach. I had to hunt down the server for the bill. In the meantime my co-worker bought a shirt from their gift shop. The clerk did not say a thing to him while ringing him up, very rude.\\n\\nI had not eaten breakfast so I do not know the source of my illness. It took about 12 hours to feel better after resting a while at the hotel. I cannot say for certain that the food made me ill, but I have my suspicions it was the raw shellfish. I had oysters on about 4 occasions over the past 2 weeks without problems though.\\n\\nIn all, I still recommend visiting here, if only for the history.

We were headed to our favorite pizza joint, but because it is so good, there tends to be a wait and we decided that we didn't want to wait and would try this place out again. The first time we went, near a year ago, we thought the food was good but the service was cold. We arrived just as the place opened and it seemed like we were rushed out as we didn't have a reservation. We figured, meh, maybe that happens. Tonight, it was worse! So again we arrive about 7pm, the place (which is small) is full, no line with one open table. They asked if we had a reservation, we said no, so they said they could seat us at the bar in 5-10mins, so we figured that was fine...taking the benefit of the doubt that the person who reserved the one open table was due. We were seated at the bar in 5 mins and we thought all was well, until again service from our barkeep was cold. I asked for a white wine and it was warm. Waiting for a bit of time, the barkeep finally cam back and we asked for some ice or a cup of ice to chill it...we were told that they did not have ice...which is something, but that they would replace the glass with a new glass from a different bottle. It was better second time around. \\n\\nNow we kept watch on that open table...it was never seated and the place was not busy. Tables kept emptying and no others were coming in to replace them. The food was okay, not great, but it was good. Ingredients were right, but it just felt so rushed. My husband and I started to think that perhaps we were not dressed correctly for this restaurant (he was in shorts and a t-shirt, I had long pants and a t-shirt), but we weren't sure. We saw two guys come in, both with same style shirt/shorts as my husband and as no one was at the door they sat themselves. When the service noticed them, we heard them ask about the reservation, but both stated that they did not have one and did not see why this was a problem as the restaurant was fairly open. The hostess left and eventually came back with menus for them. We could hear them complain (amongst themselves) about how crap it was regarding the reservation pushing and they ended up getting up and leaving. Meanwhile we have four empty tables. My husband started to think that maybe it was us and perhaps we hadn't dressed up enough for the occasion. I wanted to have a coffee, but my husband at this point was so upset about the whole experience that he just wanted to leave. So we decided that if by the time we asked for out check the original table was still open we would discuss it with management. \\n\\nAlmost an hour later that table, along with four others, were still open. When we asked for our check, I asked for the manager. The manager ended up being the same man who seated us at the bar. I had already decided and conveyed that this was not an aggressive move but we wanted to know if perhaps we were not wanted or suited for the establishment. We told him, verbatim, about the above and while he kindly reassured us that it was not our dress or their intention, he still could not tell us why we were not seated. He stated that it was a prime time for their restaurant and reservations tend to change so they were trying to keep spots open for such, but I had to keep pointing out that the restaurant was not busy and that the table (the original) had been kept open the entire time we were there. He didn't seem to understand or he just didn't want to. He politely excused himself at one point and came back with his business card asking that we email him the next time we wish to visit and that he would make sure that we were taken care of properly. Now we didn't mention it to get any freebies, but the fact that he didn't even try to make a proper gesture to keep us as returning customers was very disheartening. That was the end of it. We are never going back.\\n\\nAll the way home my husband became more and more upset. We couldn't believe it. What a mess and the management's response just sealed it. I don't know if they thought we were just suckers or what. We were actually so discouraged by the entire debacle that I called our original restaurant just to congratulate them on how good they are (and to never change) and how next time we will take our place in the queue. It's definitely worth it. And, as a last note, we mentioned our happiness to the valet and they agreed with us (they also valet for a nearby restaurant). They told us that they had also hear complaints of the \\"snootiness\\" of the place and that it was far fetched. We will not be going back, but we thought we should at least spread the word. Good luck to the next!

I tried the BBQ Seitan, and found myself liking the sides it came with more than the actual main dish. It was a huge plate of food for a lunch serving, and came with delicious garlic mashed potatoes, collard greens, some kind of slaw (apple cabbage?), and a bit of grilled cornbread. Made my southern heart happy :) and way healthier than \\"traditional\\" southern fare. I also had the mint lemonade, which was heavenly (fresh pressed with tons of fresh mint crushed up in the glass). My husband had the chard wrap, which he said was \\"right up his alley\\" and therefore thought worthy of 5 stars. My friend liked her blueberry mint lemonade (like mine, only with a hint of tart from blueberries!) blackened tofu sandwich and potato soup! I love that everything is very stylized in the restaurant, from the leaf-like flatware, to the gorgeous fountain that trickles down one wall.

I'll paint the picture as best I can though. It was a Friday evening and about 10 of my wife's friends were meeting at this trailer as someone heard it was expensively delicious. \\n\\nWe arrived and many had BYOB'd and the early bird couple already placed their order, so we settled in. A few got up to order only to be told they were out of chicken. 7:15 on a Friday and you're out of chicken? Alright... so we sat there waiting for the early bird couple to finish their chicken while the rest drank a few beers and chatted. \\n\\nThe chicken looked good on our friend's plate. Suddenly a lady poked her head from the trailer window and yelled, \\"We've still got sides!\\" But I wasn't really in the mood for a plate of cole slaw. \\n\\nSo we sat there for a while and eventually she (I guess she's Mrs. P?) exited and told us the chicken someone delivered to her did not meet her quality standards. Alright, that's understandable, but you know... might wanna go ahead and fry up some of the newly delivered chicken ahead of time. Friday night could be pretty busy you know and when a party of 10 shows up and then countless others show up all to be turned away someone might write a review on Yelp saying you don't have any chicken. \\n\\nNo chicken for you. \\n\\nI might go back one day, but I'm not that excited about it anymore.

The fact that there was no line at 10am on a Saturday should have been our first clue.  They would not seat my wife and children while I was parking the car because they will not seat an incomplete party during their busy hours.  Apparently, when there are 5 empty tables, it is still their busy time.  We never had been told this before, and thought this new policy was a little stringent - after all, there is extremely limited street parking.  I understand not seating parties where part of the party is on their way, but to not seat a party because someone is trying to fight the neighborhood traffic and find a parking spot?\\n\\nWe soon learned that the restaurant had sold a year ago.  We came specifically for the signature catfish and jamabalya - BOTH have been taken off the menu.  (we were told that the catfish will be back at the end of this month)  For Plan B, we ordered eggs benedict and steak and eggs.  The benedict was well prepared.  The Cadillac potatoes were greasy and not edible.  I am not able to eat potatoes, so our waiter Bryan substituted steamed veggies, which I appreciated.  My steak was prepared medium rare - exactly as I ordered, and the presentation was pleasant.  Presentation only goes so far.  I enjoyed the eggs, but the steak was one of the toughest pieces of meat I have encountered in many years.  I had to saw with my steak with the steak knife in order to cut it.  Not to mention that the  $8.75 \\"Gear Shift\\" drink was disgusting.\\n\\nBryan, our waiter, was the only positive experience of our meal.  He is a long-time employee of the restaurant and provided the excellent service that we have ALWAYS had from him.\\n\\nTo the manager's credit, he did apologize for the substandard experience (or at least I think he did - it was rather loud in the restaurant), he took the $15 steak and egg order off of our tab, and gave us a $15 gift certificate for the next time we might try to eat there.\\n\\nOh yeah - expect the 3% surcharge on your tab to help the company pay for employee health insurance.

Well, luck would have it that I'm a wonderful planner and got there really friggin early, so I was first (I'm number one!).\\n\\nI went all out and order whatever the heck I wanted.  So on deck was the Friterade Applen, a baked egg scramble with bacon, gouda, mushrooms with sauteed greens on the side (Holy yum! Escarole, chard, and some kinda cabbage cooked in apple cider vinegar and some chile flakes) and a potato pancake to round out the meal. My dining companion got one of the hash dishes.  \\n\\nAll of the food was consumed eagerly and quasi rapidly as we still wanted to maintain our table manners.  Surprisingly, my  favorite was the greens.  Such a delicate and flavorful dish.\\n\\nAlso, the coffee, typically you get your cup, some cream that is fresh out of the fridge and then you play the temperature game where you hope you put enough cream in the cup to get the right shade and it also hasn't turned into an iced drink.  At Broder, they steam the milk for you!  So you get hot milk and hot coffee!  So simple, yet genius!\\n\\nAnd the portions are a good size. Places were you can get food piled high with starch, meat and cheese are really appreciated in this town.  I really like that the dishes weren't a challenge to consume.  Mind you, I did order a few plates, so I definitely got my fill, but in general, you will leave pleasantly satisfied. \\n\\nWhen I'm up early and have a hankering from some lingonberries, I now know where to go to get my fix!"},{"name":"Sun Tong Luck Asian Cuisine","address":"2500 Bethel Rd","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"This place was \\"okay\\".

The difference with it is the banh con rice paste is much thinner and delicate. The filling of pork, mushroom, and I'm pretty sure there were onions in there was great with the provided fish sauce. It's much easier to eat when you first place it in a soup spoon, top it off with the provided condiments (lettuce and herb/bean sprouts), then scoop in some fish sauce. Take it all in one bite and no crumbly mess! If you put it directly in the fish sauce you're gonna lose some pork goodness in the pool. \\n\\nThe bun bo hue broth was spicy and flavorful. It wasn't greasy compared to some other ones I had and I appreciated that. It has pigs blood, a pork hock, and slices of beef (i think its brisket) with thick rice noodles.

I'm a Portland native and have never been to a brick-and-mortar Voodoo Doughnut store and I probably never will.  However, today a Voodoo Doughnut mobile truck unit was sitting in Pioneer Courthouse Square, and I decided to stop for a Sunday morning treat.  I was mostly enticed by the fact that there was not much of a line (three girls were just ahead of me) and I could get in and out in a matter of moments.  \\n\\nI like fairly plain doughnuts (cake doughnuts, buttermilk bars, etc.), so I ordered a buttermilk bar.  You should have seen the looks of amazement on those girls' faces when I didn't order one of the fancy doughnuts.  The buttermilk bar itself was very fresh and light as a feather with a cake-like interior and nicely glazed outside.  I ate it with great appreciation and moved right along to hop on MAX to head for home.\\n\\nSo there you go - my first Voodoo doughnut.  Like I said, it was tasty and very well made, so I give three stars just for that alone.  The counter person in the truck was far from engaging, just took my money and silently handed me back my buttermilk bar, so one star off for customer service.  I'm not impressed by Voodoo Doughnut as a cultural icon for Portland, so one last star off for that, and have trouble believing that people talk about them all over the world, but they sure do.  The Voodoo Doughnut concept would have been truly revolutionary back in the sixties, so to me the funny names and interesting doughnut flavors are sort of old school and give me the feeling \\"we've been down this road before.\\"  I would certainly order a good old-fashioned plain doughnut from them again if I found myself in the same situation (no line and mobile truck), but I think hell is going to freeze over before that happens again."},{"name":"Union Oyster House","address":"41 Union St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"One star for the history and the service.

I ordered fish tacos - I had one and gave the rest to a homeless man, and frankly felt bad about it.  It's one thing to give a person in need some of your food because you can't finish it or because you just want to share your blessings with someone less fortunate.  It's another thing when you do it because the food isn't any good.  Basically, I'm an a** disguised as a nice guy.\\n\\nAnyway, I don't know what else to say, other than the food was bland, practically tasteless and difficult to eat.

I finally made my way over to this sleek looking trailer after driving by the funky trailer time and time again over the past year. For a while, I was wondering why there was an unassuming, left-out trailer sitting on its own plot of land that merely had the words \\"Chicken\\" slapped on it.\\n\\nThe menu speaks straight to my heart. It specializes not only in fried chicken (and now, waffles), but it also offers the comfort fare that literally, and figuratively, warms me up on a nippy day: black-eyed peas, mac and cheese, and daily coleslaw.\\n\\nAfter a dreaded two orders in front of me zipped out of there, I was so overjoyed to bite into my red-tinged, oil-cooked, crispy chicken parts. Oh, and I also had to check out the fancy-sounding fries and black eyed peas.\\n\\nMs P's cooked cock was exactly what they advertised: spicy and juicy. Heck, they even served it with the roll and jalapeno, as marketed! $7.50 is a bit steep for 3 pieces, but it was worth it. The poultry had a thin, crispy crust, and the interior was spot-on juicy.\\n\\nThe farm frites were surprisingly more tasty than they describe it as. The thyme, salt, and pepper seemed to partner up with a light dusting of cheese. The fries were crispy, just the way I like 'em. Now... the hoppin' johns: there was smoked ham, uncured bacon galore, and an abundance of herb flavor. The base was a little soupy, but the sour cream certainly provided a little tang.\\n\\nAll in all, fantastic grub. Eat here, and you will want to return.

I found the modern warehouse decor and the ambiance created by the dark colors and live jazz music to be fantastic.  We ordered several appetizers and found them to all to be excellent.  The entrees, however, left us very disappointed.  The Tuna entree I ordered was completely devoid of any seasoning or flavor.  It kind of tasted like the chef just flash steamed the tuna and served it with some overcooked and equally flavorless vegetables.  Seeing that other people at our table were also unhappy with their entrees I asked to try a little of my friends Pork Shank and to my surprise was also completely devoid of seasoning and flavor.  It was as if the chef that created the appetizer recipes was a completely different person than the chef that created the entree recipes.  \\n\\nAlso, for some reason, this restaurant serves red wine in whiskey glasses.  I suppose they do this because they are less fragile than stemmed wine glasses and it probably saves the restaurant money from breakage.  Thick and heavy whiskey glasses, however, are generally cold and they bring down the temperature of the wine.  If you are a big red wine drinker you are probably not going to enjoy drinking red wine in a whiskey glass.  \\n\\nOur service was good however for some reason at 9:30 our server pretty much disappeared.  We were finished eating at that point but there were several people who were hoping to order a few more drinks.  Eventually, we were able to pay our bill and left to find another bar for the after dinner cocktails we wanted.   \\n\\nAs a side note, this restaurant is located in an old warehouse complex and is pretty hard to find.  It doesn't help that the entrance doesn't have any identifying signage except for the word \\"Two,\\" painted near the entrance.

This restaurant gets 2  stars from me.\\n \\nWe chose this location to sit outside, but unfortunately it was extremely cold that day so we sat inside. Seating is a little odd here. The table was in a shape of a letter \\"C\\" and in the opening there was only one chair and that person sat alone. Maybe a \\"king\\" chair due to the name King + Duke, but I don't understand the seating concept. It was not very comfortable to me. D√©cor is rustic and atmosphere was very inviting. It wasn't too dark or too light. Their dimness in the restaurant was perfect.\\n \\nThey had a very large drink order selection, which we ordered numerous drinks from. The server was very sweet and knowledgeable about the menu and drinks. Their staff was very friendly and came by often, but a little too much. I would rest my fork and they would rush over and ask if the plate could be cleared.\\n \\nFor our appetizers we ordered, deviled eggs, pimento cheese hushpuppies, spring strawberry salad, crispy sticky wings, avocado toast and beef tartare. My recommendation from what we ate and liked was the beef tartare, crispy wings and hushpuppies. The yogurt on the spring salad was not good. It was slightly bitter and the strawberries were not sweet at all. The leafy greens were not crisp. I like my veggies to be crisp to the bite. This was a disappointing salad dish. The avocado toast was so salty I couldn't finish half of it. It seemed like the chef accidently dumped a whole bottle of salt on it. Deviled eggs, do not order, just a normal deviled egg that your mom can make. I was hoping that it was have a twist to it, but no. Just your average deviled egg so I do not recommend this dish. The only thing bad about the beef tartare was that the toast was really burnt on the bottom. We ordered 2 beef tartare's and only one dish was burnt so this must have been a mistake.\\n \\nEntrees, we ordered the heritage pork chop, springer mountain chicken, whole roasted trout, 2 orders of prime rib 14 oz. with king crab leg and a chef creation veggie plate. We ordered 2 sides with our entrees. Roasted cauliflower and baby beets and carrots. Their portions are decent.\\n \\nI don't know if this restaurant purposely charred all their food, but to me it seemed burnt! You can see from my photos, the food seems burnt not charred. Our beef tartare toast was so black on the bottom we just didn't eat the toast. And all of our entrees and side dishes were black. The cauliflower side dish, chicken entree, pork chop entr√©e, trout entree, even the veggie plate was the color black!

The food was disappointing and was average at best.\\n\\nWould I go back here?  I would never go back here for the food; however, if I had small children, I would probably be eating breakfast here every weekend.  The restaurant itself seems to have been made for parents who want a small break from their children by offering a huge area for kids to run around and play with a child-sized kitchen allowing parents to spend some quality one-on-one time without having to hire a babysitter.

My husband had Ben let the raw bar chef choose 3 of his favorite oysters, which he said were all very good, and we also ordered the octopus for an app at Ben's recommendation.

We also got four sides - hearts of palm, fried rice, hush puppies and bock choy, all of which complimented our meals perfectly. The hush puppies were lighter than other places, and I really enjoyed the hint of salt that meshed so well with the sweet flavor. We were so full at this point that when the dessert menu came, we graciously said no thank you, but Ben brought over a cup of the salted caramel ice cream for us anyway, which was just as good, if not better than Morelli's.

It's a great location, and the restaurant itself is pleasant, with lots of light and some nice details. And some of the food can be pretty good. But as the reviewer above said, it's totally haphazard. \\n\\nI've gone back 4 times (shame on me), hoping that it would be better at different times, but I've yet to have a really good experience. \\n\\nThe waitstaff seems totally underwhelmed and uninterested (except for one spunky waitress, I don't recall her name); there doesn't appear to be any manager on duty, ever; and the kitchen makes really lazy mistakes, like having watery \\"sauteed\\" greens on the side of the brunch frittata. Seriously, how hard is it to drain the water from the greens you obviously just cooked in water (don't think they ever got sauteed), and which has now formed a puddle under my eggs. And if not the kitchen mgr, why wouldn't the person running the food notice that?\\n\\nLazy.\\n\\nUnfortunately there are lots of little things like this, which to me are signs of a place where no one is in charge of quality control, and it, seems, the people working there just don't care very much. Sad. \\n\\nAnd yeah, the menu is kinda whack, with this strange hodge-podge of food choices. That kind of eclectic menu might have worked, in a quirky Boulder way, if the quality and service was great. But, alas, it's not the case with Ella. \\n\\nOne really big negative, which actually tempts me to give this one star: the bathroom is dirty (seriously, like dust shelves on the bathroom stalls). Actually, I've noticed on the two occasions I've been there for brunch, that it doesn't appear that the floors throughout the entire place have been cleaned for awhile.

Well, last night completely changed my outlook regarding this restaurant and I will no longer be going there.  I gave them a two because I have had a history of good service from them.\\n\\nWhen my best friend and I went to this restaurant last night, we were ready to have a nice dinner and then call it a night.  They were busier than normal, however, there was only one family waiting ahead of us.  The hostess said to us in a condescending tone that it was an hour wait since we didn't have a reservation.  Ok, no problem. However, she did not ask what our names were and would we like to sit at the empty bar and have anything to drink.  She just turned away from us. So we sat for a while as these \\"reservations\\" never showed up and there were empty seats at the sushi bar as well as several empty tables. People were walking in and leaving due to their exaggerated wait times for the phantom reservations.  We finally asked if we could sit at the sushi bar as it was now completely empty (about 6 chairs) and none of these reservations had showed up.  She told us in a not so polite way \\"no\\".  We asked for the manager who proceeded to explain that they were \\"busier than normal\\" and were not use to the traffic.  So this is your rationale for poor customer service?  You are to be trained to provide good customer service regardless of how busy you are.  Thats what makes a restaurant.  When I mentioned that she had not even asked our name, he said they don't normally take down the names of people waiting.  I suggested that even if they didn't, she could at least have pretended to care and asked us our names.  He then stated that his employees are not trained to \\"deceive\\" customers. So I'm assuming its okay to be rude since being polite is deceitful when it comes to a business.\\n\\nWe are finally seated quite quickly I might add after our conversation with the manager (he claimed to be the owner).  The food came out and it was sub-par to say the least.  I was very disappointed at the quality of the sushi, it was definitely a downgrade from what I had eaten there before.  I ordered the Happy Sumo and the Kamikaze. There was no presentation which normally they have for the sushi and it appeared to be sloppily put together.  Amazingly enough, the sushi bar seating remained empty the WHOLE TIME.

This year, I made my reservation early, more than a month out, to make sure we got the time we needed. An early dinner was necessary to be home in time for my son arriving later on.\\n\\nThe day before the reservation, Hall Street Grill called to ask if I was ok with being in an outdoor, heated tent. I said that my parents probably wouldn't like it, and that we strongly preferred being in the regular restaurant, especially since I had made an early reservation towards the beginning of the dinner rush and had made the reservation over a month ago. \\"Well,\\" said the voice on the phone, \\"we expect to get crowded with the walk ins, but I will put down that you strongly prefer to be indoors.\\" \\n\\nWhen we showed up, about 5 minutes early for our reservation, we were sent right out into the outdoor tent. I've worked in restaurants and I understand Xmas eve is a busy night. But if I made the reservation to be at your place of business, it means I specifically wanted to have dinner at your establishment. It wasn't a last minute, or casual decision. I made sure I had space reserved for me and my family. I made it clear that we really wanted to be inside.  Basically, walk ins got better seating than I did, making long range plans and telling them I didn't want to be outside. That sure felt great, let me tell you.\\n\\nThey said we could hang out in the bar if we wanted for 30 minutes if we wanted to be in the restaurant. I had a time frame, so this was out of the question. However, it might have been the better move, because....\\n\\nOnce seated outdoors with the hot air fan blowing loudly, and the overhead heater lights grilling down on my father's bald head, baking him enough he requested they turn it off it was an HOUR AND A HALF before we received our food. I kept time. A large group sat next to us and our waiter, Christian, who was WONDERFUL and did the very best he could, had to take care of us and a large party at the same time. We sat down at the same time as another group with the same small number in their party, and they had ordered, eaten, paid, and left, and the table was reset before our food even showed up.\\n\\nSo, between my strong preference for being inside, as a reservation customer, basically being ignored, then being told I could sit in the bar for a half an hour if I wanted a seat indoors, to waiting an hour and a freaking half for my dinner while baking under the heating lights and having to talk loudly to be heard over the heating fan..and having to rush out, and being late for my arriving son, I think  we are done with Hall Street for being together as family. We have been treated just fine in the past, and I could have easily forgiven the rush and the crowds and things being a little slow, but this was no way to treat a party that specifically wanted to be at HSG, making a reservation in mid-November to make sure we could. Props to Christian for doing the very best he could trying to manage a small party and a large one at the same time. A large party deserves a dedicated server, and we paid the price. Not his fault, management's. You were great, Christian!

I had heard that wait times were as long as 2 hours, and on a Saturday night shortly before 5PM, we had to wait around 30 minutes to be seated at a table for two. Ordered a small shiyo ramen. \\n\\nPork belly slices - First off, as a disclaimer, I didn't taste any of the pork belly because I don't eat pork anymore (but on rare occasion I will drink pork/beef/chicken broth). I hear it was very tender, though. A small bowl came with two thick slices.\\n\\nBroth - The shiyo (salt-flavored) broth was rich and very fatty. You could see oil droplets all over the top layer of the soup. I was only able to finish less than half the bowl of broth because of how heavy it was. \\n\\nNoodles - The noodles are harder than expected (or, in Chinese parlance, not very \\"Q\\"). \\n\\nPrice - Not bad at all. My small bowl cost something around $11. \\n\\nAmbiance - Crowded (like any authentic Asian eatery!), busy, and surprisingly \\"upscale-feeling\\" for the location in Harvard Square.\\n\\nI'll probably come back, but not in the near future. Substitutes of comparable price and quality exist in the greater Boston area (i.e. Pikaichi, Yumi Wo Katare). Plus, pre-packaged H-Mart ramen imported from Japan (not the dry kind but the refrigerated kind!) is a close enough substitute for a small fraction of the price, that, I'm not sure I'll be craving Santouka that often.

My first trip many moons ago I had the southern dog which was a hot dog with pulled pork and cole slaw (cole slaw on a sandwich is standard in the Carolinas) and it as ridiculously good.  The hot dog had the right snap and perfectly balanced with the mustardy pulled pork and sweet cole slaw...accompanied by an old fashioned...heaven!  \\n\\nSubsequent trips have lead to massive consumption of the entire menu (hot dog..no vegan stuff) with 9 friends and every one of those hot dogs are great.

Nothing really out of the ordinary. \\n\\nCeviche: WOW!!!! So many layers of flavor and texture. 5+. Rich with onion, cilantro, lime, carrot (sweet), and corn. One of the best I've had in an extremely long time. \\n\\nYuca frita: a bit dry but the salsa adds more dimension to the dish \\n\\nCrab avacado: also light! Not heavy flavor but balanced (which is welcomed as this has potential to be quite potent) \\n\\nSushimi tuna: the cucumber, onion, peanut, and spicy mango add a great deal to the tuna! \\n\\nPeppers: SO good!! Wonderful meaty flavor and texture. \\n\\nTamale: Solid!!! Not dry or pasty. Decent spice factor. Love it! \\n\\nEmpanada: WOW! Also really good! Not too dough-ey which is very common for this dish. Surprisingly, the lime you can squeeze on it is worth it! \\n\\nChicken kebob: Extremely tender (falls off the skewer!) and, what is that, tumeric? Good. The tomato-based sauce sadly doesn't add anything to the dish. \\n\\nOctopus: luckily not chewy! Or fishy. Fantastic accents and the potato adds to the experience. \\n\\nLamb shank: Tender and great sauce. Not the best lamb dish I've had but still very good. \\n\\nSaut√©ed mushroom vegan dish: the potato is DIVINE! Reminds me of Spain. Tender with great spice. Smokey accents but good. Not the best dish and I'd pursue other vegan options in the future. \\n\\nDRINKS \\nPina Colada: coconut flavor. Good!\\n\\nSangria: YEEEES! A mature, adult and sophisticated version.

However I didn't leave with my order, that I had already paid for through the app, until 11 am.  Yes that is correct, it took over 2 hours to receive my food that I ordered through the app.  The waitress claimed that they mistakenly gave my food away before I arrived, and that they were making it again.   Also they was short one chef so food was backed up.  As I was there, I saw plenty of people receive their food, while I had to wait and wait.  My order consisted of shrimp and grits, eggs, and turkey bacon.  Yes that is all, and it still took over two hours. The ONLY reason I didn't leave is because I had paid for my food, and I had time.   \\nI requested a refund through chownow, however they told me they can only issue a refund once approved by Rosie's.

I have to say I was less than thrilled with the service and found the overall atmosphere a bit off-putting - this was definitely a very \\"in-crowd\\" scene where a handful of regulars ruled the roost and, frankly, made it seem like anyone not part of their little cabal was intruding.

I've had better at hole in the wall type Peruvian places in So Cal.

This is indeed the closest thing to NY style thin crust pizza in Austin.  And it's awesome.  Worth the wait for northern transplants looking for a slice of home.\\n\\nTheir real star in my book is their chicken parm.  They hollow out the middle of the bread a little bit, like serious pros.  Not only does this technique make it easier to eat, but they get the bread to chicken to sauce to cheese ratio just right.  \\n\\nIt ain't cheap though.  A 12' will set you back $15.  Grab a friend/lover/stranger off the street and share this bad boy.  Doing this makes it more economical than getting a 6' which is $10.  \\n\\nOh, also they seem to give kiddos some pizza dough to play with which was a nice touch to keep them busy and entertained."},{"name":"Dynamic Dish","address":"427 Edgewood Ave SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"What a joy this little cafe was to discover.

But here is the reason I didn't give a 5 star and I hope that management will see this.  It is winter right now and it can be very cold at night.  Last night when we dined there was a cold night outside.  There was a crowd out the door and they were keeping the door open.  I asked the manager on duty, the hostess, and two servers if they could please close the door and they said that people were waiting.  I said, I understand but the entire restaurant has become cold.  We were now sitting inside with our jackets on.  It is a small restaurant.  They said that there was a crowd so the door was open. I said, that's fine, but they don't need to keep the door open.  When people leave and there is more room in the waiting area then more people can come inside, but there's no reasons for everyone in the restaurant to be cold.  But nothing was done about this.  I would definitely go back to Jinya.  I've been to this one and one in LA and they are great.

No charge, just tips. Unless you're evil. \\n\\nWe had a reservation and were seated quickly. Our waiter was friendly, informative, and attentive. I was curious as to how the roasted octopus appetizer was cooked to be tender yet flavorful, and he was able to tell me how it was cooked and what ingredients were used. \\n\\nFood came out quickly, and each person who brought stuff was upbeat and friendly without being cloying. \\n\\nFood:  Overall, it was excellent. I lived in New England for 20 years, so I'm a bit of a d**k about fresh seafood. Everything at The Optimist was fresh and top quality. \\n\\nFor appetizers, we had the roasted octopus and the fried oysters. The octopus was one large tentacle and the kimchee spices were very good. I usually like my oysters cold and snotty, but when baby wants fried, baby gets fried. Also excellent. Portions were good for the price. \\n\\nEntrees were the duck fat poached swordfish and the crispy fried whole black bass. The flavor of the swordfish was very good, with the right balance of duck and fish. The fish was a bit dry, though, defeating the reason people order swordfish. The bass was awesome. The sweet soy ginger coating is a subtler yet more complex version of what you'd get in an upscale Chinese place. I picked that monster apart until there was nothing left but a skeleton (tips: Eat everything on the head that ain't bones, and eat as much of the fins as you can), and I barely had to deal with any little bones. \\n\\nDessert was the cr√®me fraishe ice cream for me and the chocolate cake with a coma-inducing pool of caramel. Everything was great, but the flourless cake was, as the youngsters say, \\"off that hook\\" it's like someone took a two foot high cylinder of the best chocolate mousse and squashed it down to an inch and a half. \\n\\nAmbiance: The high arched brick ceiling absorbs a lot of sound, so conversation is possible.

The cobbler was very good - perfect ratio of filling and crust! The cheesecake was very dense and sweet, but it comes in a small thin piece which I thought was the perfect serving portion.\\n\\nThe restaurant itself is pretty large in size. There's a general seating area with a few fancy booths, some extra seating along the hallway on the second floor, at least one private room for parties, a cigar room/floor (when we went it was still under construction), AND a small rooftop lounge/bar. \\n\\nOverall, the space is great and has lots of potential.

This place claims to be up-scale, but that isn't reflected in what they are serving. \\n\\nIt's a relatively new restaurant, so hopefully they'll be able to work on improving their menu items.

As I was making my way through their parking lot to drive back to work, a car sped through a parking space trying to cut through the narrow lot instead of driving all the way around the cars. As I slammed my breaks to avoid an accident, the Veggie Platter went flying and completely tipped over and spilled its contents all over the floor of my car. Stressed, panicked and under a time crunch, I made my way back inside expecting to be told there was nothing they could do. Instead, the manager (I believe his name was Bill) came back out, assured me he could put another one together in no time and that he wouldn't charge us for another platter. As I waited in the store, Bill came back out to let me know that he had one of his staff waiting outside to help me clean the veggies out of my car. I went outside to meet Juan, and he ever so kindly scooped up all the veggies and threw everything away for me. The staff then emerged from the back with a brand new platter (in a sturdy, spill-proof box!) for me to take back to work. \\nLambert's staff could have easily told me that it was not their problem that the platter we purchased spilled, and they most certainly didn't need to make us a replacement one at no cost, but they did.

The sauce that comes with it pretty much sealed the deal when I took a bite into the crispy grilled wrapped eggplant. Heavenly.\\n\\nAlso, please try their Sangria. It's very fruity. (I'm not a fan of Sangria when it tastes too much like wine) They make it themselves everyday. I prefer red over white, but both tasted awesome. Nice decor with the fruit as well. It's an okay price at 8 dollars a glass, but if you head anywhere else, you'd get 7-10 dollars for a small glass. Cafe 47 does the best by giving you a large glass.\\n\\nThis is my first review on yelp and I always, ALWAYS, try some fries at different places I eat. Cafe 47's fries aren't bad, but just okay on my scale. Their fries have a crisp/light crisp consistency, but lacked the wow-factor I need. It's like if Burger King fries married Wendy's fries and had a kid. I am hoping they'll do something more with their fries, maybe have some cajun/bbq seasoning, or follow the parmesan/rosemary route.\\n\\nThe price is reasonable for the Back Bay and the decor is very down to earth, nice and appealing.  The place could accommodate one large group, however I think this is more of a couple/ group of 4-6 friends kind of place. The waitstaff is pretty cheerful and helpful as well.

The tomato pie and yeast rolls they give with the meal were 5 star but the rest I could take or leave. The fried food tasted burnt with no flavor, the okra was cold and also no spice, and the whipped potatoes were literally potatoes with butter and again no flavor. The gravy on the chicken and the cocktail and tartar sauces were the only thing that brought these babies up to par. The Mac and cheese was so bad and curdled it was inedible.

The tofu scramble - like a delicious explosion in my mouth.  I was NOT hungry and I forced myself to eat nearly all of it because it was that good.  It seems they scramble up the tofu and then coat it in a generous coating of nutritional yeast - imparting that crusty, densely cheese flavor.  I don't know how they do it without the yeast dissolving, but I must make it my mission in life to recreate this!\\nBouldin Creek also offers a buttload of vegan desserts and I cry because I was too stuffed to try any of them.  However, we did pick up a couple Baraka bars that I ate later on (they're okay, but not great). \\nAny fully vegetarian restaurant is a friend of mine - so I'd be highly keen on stopping by here again."},{"name":"Kyung Bok Palace","address":"5300 No 3 Road, Suite 720","city":"Richmond","stars":"2.5","text":"Not worth the money.

You've found your place.\\n\\nI ordered a steak burrita based on a previous Yelp review, and their description of a Mexican-style cheese-steak-but-in-a-quesidilla format is on point.  Maybe not as much cheese as a cheese steak, but more flavorful, and with the house-made table sauces, it becomes even better. Delicious.\\n\\nI was really hungry, so I also ordered a single 'mixed grilled meat' taco (because it's a new place, and I have to try more than one thing!).  This was perfectly traditionally presented - on a small corn tortilla with fresh onions, cilantro and a bit of cheese.  Again, add some of the spicy green jalapeno table sauce, and it's perfect.\\n\\nI washed everything down with a crisp Mexican (normal sugar, no corn syrup) Coca-Cola, and a glass of water.  An ideal lunch.\\n\\nThe interior is cozy - maybe 5 tables that sit 3 or 4 each, so it can get full quickly, but they do have outside seating if the weather is agreeable.

By the time I pulled into the lot, it was absolutely packed. Self-parking was no longer available and the valet guy told me that valet parking had just run out, too. Dismayed, but still flashing him a smile, I asked him where the nearest available lot was. He paused, looked at me, and said, \\"Tell you what. I can find some space for you. You're wearing heels, aren't you.\\" (A statement, not a question. Lol.) I beamed and replied, \\"Yes I am!\\" I like to think my charming smile got him to take pity on me. Totally joking, of course. So I thanked him profusely and got out of the car and happily headed into The Optimist.\\n\\nDid I mention the restaurant was packed? Because it was PACKED. I think there was some sort of happy hour going on because there were a bunch of business people wearing name tags milling around the bar area.\\n\\nEven though the majority of the party of six was about 20-30 minutes late for the reservation, we were seated immediately. \\n\\nI decided on two appetizers for my meal. I got the seafood gumbo ($9) and the mussels in green curry ($9). In all honesty, just the gumbo would have been enough. It was such a huge portion. It came with a couple of blue crab claws, HUGE shrimp and pieces of sausage. The baguette it came with had this delicious garlic butter on it. By the time I finished off my gumbo, I was stuffed. But shortly after, my mussels came out, and that was a huge portion, too. They were nice and succulent. The curry was pretty strong tasting but thankfully I had more bread to dip into the broth. I could only manage 5-6 mussels and even shared my dish, but still ended up with leftovers.\\n\\nThe entree portions seemed on the smaller side, but I think you are supposed to order side items a la carte to go with them. \\n\\nI can't imagine how packed the restaurant must be on the weekends.

I probably would have gone for some mac and cheese and/or something else completely artery clogging if I weren't about to eat a half of a fried chicken.

The tomatoes and okra had a nice flavor, but they were my least favorite part of the meal... but let's not forget the real star is the delicious fried chicken! \\n\\nThe bread basket was a great complement, packed with corn muffins, bread rolls, and cinnamon rolls, which were the perfect after-dinner treat--if you can wait that long!

We ordered the branzino,  the brisket, and the chicken. Those of us who ordered the chicken didn't care for it much. They said that it didn't have much flavor. The proportions were huge though. I ordered the brisket - it was huge, tender, and flavorful. The branzino was good.

I think the best way to describe the food is that it's four to five times better than it has to be.

This place is all go with very little show, and if you're into that, as I am, it's worth a trip.\\n\\nI ordered the tradicional upon the recommendation of our waiter. It's a Peruvian marinated chicken sandwich with lettuce, tomatoes and a yellow chili sauce. There was nothing fancy about the sandwich (all of $6), just like there's nothing fancy about the restaurant. But the chicken was moist; the bread was wonderfully paired with the sandwich; you could tell that the tomatoes were cut immediately before the sandwich was served; and all the ingredients popped. It was simple, elegant food executed perfectly.\\n\\nMy wife ordered the Huevos con Chorizo which, again, were perfectly executed. She had the dish with tortillas, also on the recommendation of the waiter. They're really more of an unsweetened corn pancake, and came warm to our table. Delicious.\\n\\nThe decor of the restaurant reflects the menu. It's spartan but warm, with no overbearing wall ornamentation. There's an open kitchen, which was of course spotless, as we expected from the quality of the food that we were served.\\n\\nIf you're one of those people who get's pissed off at a lot of the mid-tier restaurants in Boston that offer underwhelming execution and ingredients at overbearing prices, then I would highly recommend visiting Mixtura.

In addition to making the reservation online, he also called them days in advance to see if they could accomodate my Gluten Free allergy. They said they didn't have a GF menu but many of the items on their menu could be made gluten free. Well, I was excited about going there because it was where my husband & I had gone on our \\"first date\\" years ago. When we arrived our waiter knew of my allergy from my husband's reservation (I thought great, he is on the ball). He said he would check with the chef to see what appetizers could be made GF and said he would request some GF rolls for me. No rolls arrived, instead I got slices of soggy (thawed from the freezer not doubt) cinnamon raisin bread. Also, it turned out none of the soups were GF and I was told only 1 of the appetizers could be mad e GF with the removal of the glaze. As if that weren't disappointing enough... they did not have any GF pasta (waiter said that they do usually have it), and I was told that there were only 2 entrees I could choose from. I chose the filet because I wasn't in the mood for mussels & clams. Again, the sauce for my filet was not gluten free so no sauce for me. This is a simple sauce (bordelaise) and can easily be made gluten free. No attempt was made to slightly change any of their dinner items to be GF for me. If you have an allergy or dietary restriction of any kind stay away!

Mother's Day Brunch. I should've known better. Mom would've been just as happy with my overdone toast, runny scrambled eggs, and a homemade mimosa. Instead, we were seated by less-than-welcoming hostesses and made to wait over an hour for our food. I get it. It was Mother's Day, the place was packed, and things happen.  That's life, however, my mother-in-law is diabetic and took her insulin too soon, expecting to eat within 30 minutes of being seated. For fear of a hypoglycemic crisis, our waiter came to the rescue with a biscuit that resembled the hardtack that soldiers reportedly ate during the Civil War. He also threw in some ciabatta bread with chili olive oil/balsamic which was nice.  Poor guy--he was actually a good waiter--he just couldn't help that the kitchen was in disarray. \\n\\nWhen our food finally came, it was good--nothing to rave about--but good.  I ordered the lobster omelet--not too much lobster but A LOT of ramps that were extremely crunchy and hard.  It was topped with a tomato sauce and dollop of pesto--it sounded from the menu like it should be a taste sensation, but it fell a bit flat. Meanwhile, the potatoes that accompanied it were the kind of spicy that makes you want to scream and gulp down a glass of water.  I wasn't sure how it all fit together, to be honest. Other dishes we ordered included the brisket empanada (stellar flavor...the best thing I tasted that day), chicken fried steak (father-in-law enjoyed tremendously), and the TWO burger (looked REALLY greasy...but apparently tasted good).\\n\\nWhen all was said and done, the waiter gave us a free entree as compensation for our long wait which we appreciated. I told the manager I spoke to that I'd be willing to give TWO two tries--and I sincerely mean that. They were having a bad day like a lot of us do and I just so happened to find myself in the middle of the mess this time around. Next time, I think I'll skip brunch and try the dinner and drinks like a lot of the celebrities that visit ATL do according to US Weekly.

However, after this last time, I'll never go back. \\n\\nTo begin with, when making the reservation we requested the private back room (with the pillows on the floor and low tables) and were told repeatedly that we would have it. When we got there we were told the room had been given to another group, and they claimed to have no idea that we had wanted it. Frankly, we should have left then because it only got worse, but this by itself wasn't that big of a deal, so we stayed...\\n\\nIn the 5 minutes we were discussing what to order and waiting for the rest of our group to show up, the same waitress harassed us at least 5 times about ordering drinks.\\n\\nWhen we ordered 7 sake bombs, they brought us 7 Sapporo (enough for  at least 15 sake bombs) and 7 large hot sakes (enough for at least 25 sake bombs!) the cans were unopened, so we asked them to take back 3 of the cans and 4 of the sakes, which resulted in an argument (of which I don't know details, I was at the opposite end of the table), the manager being called, and finally the pissy waitress taking them in such a huff that she spilled a full glass of water all over one person in our group- and then she walked away without apology or offer of napkins or anything. \\n\\nMeanwhile, the karaoke had started (what we were really there for) and the tv kept breaking, which was annoying but probably not their fault. What was really annoying was that every time the tv broke and was fixed, they skipped the song that was supposed to be up next- which happened to mean our group kept getting skipped. The birthday boy only ever got half a song (tv broke in the middle) and our whole group only had 2 other songs. \\n\\nAfter initially harassing us to order, the service moved at a snail's pace- every drink order took 30 minutes of waiting for someone to notice us, and getting a water took 4 requests before it arrived. \\n\\nbut the REAL kicker came when we got fed up with all of the above and asked for the check- it came, we passed it around, everyone put in what they thought they owed. When we totaled it up, we found ourselves $50 short! We knew one couple had left early and already paid the server on a separate check, so I took the bill up to the front to see if that was the problem... and sure enough, as soon as I asked if they had already paid, the manager pulled out their receipt and subtracted that amount. Again, no apology- and no indication that they had anything in mind other than hoping we were too drunk to notice and would just pay that $50 again! \\n\\nWe left very little tip, something I very rarely do, and I'll never go back.

Delicious. My favorites. Large mild chiles stuffed with your choice of ground beef (picadillo) or chicken, or just potatoes for you vegetarians out there, fried in an egg batter and covered with a good ranchero sauce, sour cream, raisins, and pecans.

Yes I tried them all. AND the coffee is a great compliment.\\n\\nLUNCH (on Udi's GF toast)\\n\\nSalmon BLT - SUPER DELISH no other words \\n\\nBrisket Nappa Slaw Sloppy Joe - this is my favorite lunch item so far. It is not you traditional \\"sloppy\\" Joe, but you will still need a fork and several napkins. #tear\\n\\nThe crop sides: steamed broccoli and saut√©ed spinach were bland but fresh. The fried chips are not GF and that is noted on the menu.\\n\\nArden's Garden brought in their fresh drinks from a few miles down Main Street so you will be happy to know there are quite a few selections of fresh pressed juices. \\n\\nI also witnessed a fresh tray of handmade cinnamon rolls whisk by me.

Ok, ok back to biz...\\n\\nTechnical highlight: PLUGS ARE UNDER EACH TABLE! A phone and laptop charging dream!!\\n\\nThe only con I can think of is parking.

Fresh, delicious, mostly maple-y, but with a slightly off aftertaste. Maple bars are my favorite doughnut, bar none (heh, again) but this one just didn't hit the right maple flavor for me.

This review isn't meant to destroy Backspace, but rather to help. I have been going here for a couple years. I have seen the variations in product and generally been ok with it. Excellent tomato sauce with tasty toppings. Lately, they are not getting the crust right. They used to. I am a bit of a pizza nerd, and I know Neapolitan pizza. I watched the guy make the dough, and he flattened it instead of pushing it outward lightly. He pushed all the air out of the dough. This leads to no fluffy crust edge full of air, etc. Sure enough, I got a pizza with a flat edge. No leoparding either(the black spots around the edge of the crust). Not the chewy, fluffy, full of air pockets dough usually found on Neapolitan pizza. I would recommend the owners go in and have they guy that made my pizza yesterday lunch(2/12), and have him make you a pie. I don't think it would meet your standards. I think the cook is probably good, just needs additional training or retraining.

Here's my take!\\n\\nPros:\\n-cool atmosphere--the space is huge and it's definitely decorated to be a trendy spot\\n-good cocktails and live band in the bar area\\n\\nCons:\\n-giant sized food takes away from the vibe. We ordered several apps to share and they were huge, cumbersome to divy up. If you want a casual vibe that encourages sharing, don't make the food so hard to eat!\\n-I ordered a $40 seafood grill which was really underwhelming. There was part of a lobster, 3 shrimp, and 5 muscles. One muscle shell was closed and all shells were broken. I do assume this must be related to the cooking method but I was taught to never eat broken shells (and NEVER closed shells), so I only ventured to try one muscle, which was very grainy given the broken shell and some sand, Yuck. The lobster was poorly cut so there was barely any meat. And all the seafood came head/shell on, which is fine, except they gave me no cracker, no bowl for shells, and no way to clean up!\\n-Service. While our lead waiter was friendly, our runners got the order wrong for every single course! Also our apps and entrees came out together, which is poor pacing for a large group that ordered a lot of appetizers so they could have some time for conversation.\\n\\nMy take would be go with a few friends for drinks but save your money for a better dining experinece elsewhere!"},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Amazing donuts, wait was not that long either on a weekday morning.

Of course. What do you think of the strawberry lemonade? This guy made you want to eat here and I've never had that from any of the food carts here in town, nor do I expect something like that. Maybe one should.\\n\\nThe food was typical Mediterranean food, gyros, hummus and shwarma. It was the only cart with a line. Granted on a Monday not many of the carts were open here. I got a gyro and it came with a small Greek salad and pita chips. It was a little on the small side but it was in line with what I paid for it. Don't get me wrong, the food was good.

Last night, Sunday night, I was feeling pretty lazy, and there was a House marathon on...  so I decided to order delivery for dinner.  Ray's was actually one of the few places that was still open at 9pm and would deliver as far as Atlantic Station.  In fact, they were actually open to 11 on Sunday.  That makes me happy.  I actually don't remember how long it took since I was wrapped up in an episode of house, but it didn't seem like it was terribly long...\\n      I was pleased with the food.  Plenty of variety on the menu;  pizza, Mediterranean favorites, salads, sandwiches.  I decided to order the coolest thing I saw, being the gyro pizza.  Yeah, pizza with gyro meat on top.  I really wish more places did that.  Also got some garlic knots as they seem to be a crowd favorite.  I thought both were delicious.  I mean, I expect no less from something topped with feta cheese and gyro meat, but it did live up to expectations.  \\n     The garlic knots were also awesome.  Little balls of dough covered with garlic butter... or some garlicy lipid..  Either way, I loved the deliciously doughy the center and the dipping marinara was actually good, which is usually not the case, I find.\\n     So I'll probably never actually go to the place, but there's my 4 stars for the delivery."},{"name":"Andina Restaurant","address":"1314 NW Glisan St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"When I think back to Andina and think about how many stars I should give it.... I was like... 4...... but then I REALLY thought back, and looked through my pictures of the food, and I realize DUH it was so a 5. I enjoyed the hell outta my food.\\n\\nSo this was a tapas style restaurant, so for the most part we ordered medium sized dishes to share between 6, as well as 2 large plates to share.\\n\\nThe bread was definitely interesting. Came with 3 different dips or sauces, and I liked the jalapeno one. The passion fruit one was yummy, but I don't like it with bread.\\n\\nSo we started off with oysters, and I think we ordered 3 different types. It came with your usual lemons (or limes) and... several different.... toppings. I forgot what they were, but everything together was refreshing, tangy, and slurpalicious. Yea that's what I said, keep up.\\n\\nThen came the ceviche. I love me some ceviche. The fish melted in your mouth, and the sauce/broth it was served in was sooooo tasty. It was fresh and delicious.\\n\\nUp next was the prawns fried in quinoa. That quinoa really gave it a nice crunch. Dip that prawn in some sauce and BOOM flavor bomb in your mouth.\\n\\nTHE POTATOES! I forgot what it was called exactly... potato di patatas? Potato my tatas? Potata tatatas? Hm it was something like that and yes you should order it. It was like a fritata but made with layers of thinly sliced potatoes. Like au gratin but not goopy. It was also drizzled on with the most delicious sauce and topped with roasted peppers. Heaaaven for potato lovers.\\n\\nThen the beef hearts! It was super flavorful, and it was tender as far as beef hearts go. The sauce was delicious, the marinade was great.\\n\\nNow the 2 big plates that we shared.. I chose the lomo saltado because that's my favorite Peruvian dish. Probably everyone and their mamas' mamas' favorite dishes also. I always thought of it as a... casual dish. Andina really brought it up several levels. Geeezus.\\n\\nThe rice. Even the rice was flavorful. And so soft. Wtf. It had a hint of garlic flavor. The sauce. The sauce was just soooooooooooooo............. amazing. And the beeeeeef. Holy crap it just cut like butter. The FRIES... they didn't give enough of those. But putting everything together - rice, beef, fries, tomato, onions, and sauce......... put that in your mouth and it just fucks up your tongue cos now everything else will taste average. JK duh I'm exaggerating but it was freaking delicious.\\n\\nAnd my friend ordered some quinoa/cheese dish that was vegetarian and I was just not impressed. It could be the fact that it came after the lomo saltado or it could be the fact that I just simply was not impressed.\\n\\nAnyway that's as far as the food goes. Pretty effing fantastic. And service was awesome! Place is also really nice, although a bit crowded/cramped.\\n\\nMost of us got cocktails, and I got the horchata one... I think it tasted more like coffee than horchata? Coffee + horchata + alcohol? Hm it was quite good.

The risotto is to die for, the mussels are to die for, the gnocchi are to die for, well, you get my drift. The veggie pizza is one of the best I've ever had.\\n\\nThe owner and chef is incredible.  If you pass by the front of the restaurant, you can see her rolling dough and working her butt off.  I just wish she could better manage her employees!  \\n\\nFirst off- the acoustics in the restaurant are awful.  Even with only 4 other parties eating, its extremely loud. This may be due to the high ceilings and bare walls, but regardless, I should not hear echoing conversations from tables around me!\\n\\nService is pretty weak.   If you plan to sit outside, expect to be ignored, and make sure you have 2 hours to spend sitting there. Our waitress, although very sweet and personable (pretty sure she's the owner's daughter), forgot to bring us plates with our appetizer, and 10 minutes later a different woman came by to gave us our plates.  This was when we were already done with our arancini, and she didnt have any explanation and was not very polite (not that big of a deal, just weird and pointless that she even bothered). Food took a while to come out, which may be due to the fact that its quality. But regardless, as a former waitress, its a cardinal rule that patrons should not wait more than 10-15 minutes (MAX) to receive their entree after the appetizer has been cleared from the table (to give you an idea, my boyfriend ordered medium rare steak tips, and I got liguini with clams). Expect to wait 20 minutes (minimum)!  Even the bread and oil took a while- there's no excuse for that!\\n\\nA separate time I came in with my father and sat inside.  I'm not sure if it was the fact that we were sitting inside opposed to outside, or the fact that my father eats or gets take out from Pescatore at least once a week, but everything was much smoother. Food and drinks came out in a timely manner, and we were able to be in and out within an hour and 15 minutes.\\n\\nThere are some very good and some decent servers who work there.\\n But with the good comes the bad. We got the worst server possible. He was extremely rude and ignorant, and was in so much of a rush with his, hm.. 2 other parties, that he wouldn't give us the time of day!  He would take our orders and bolt from our table before I could finish a sentence. For such a small restaurant, you would think they would want the best servers possible! NOPE. I think he caught on that he was doing a crap job, so he brought us complimentary limoncello before we left. \\n\\nI do have to give Pescatore kudos.

I must say that the ambiance and the views from our window table were stunning. However, the sourdough bread in our crab toast appetizer was burnt in places and had an unpalatable lingering taste in every bite. I ordered the roasted chicken breast as my entree. After having a couple of pieces, I felt it had a funny taste and a strange rubbery texture as I would chew the piece of chicken. I felt embarrassed to take a flashlight from the phone and look at the center of the chicken but I chose to do it. I had just come to realize that I had eaten few bites of RAW chicken that was shiny, slimy and pinkish in middle and white on the top and bottom.\\n\\nOur server was good throughout the dinner and I politely asked her to take it back. She acknowledged the fact that the chicken didn't look right and offered me a pear salad while they fixed my entree. One of the manager's walked back to my table with a fresh chicken entree and apologized for the kitchen mishap. Our server also poured us a complimentary glass of champagne to make up for it.\\n\\nI did not get charged for my meal for being served raw chicken on my birthday.

Needed to be downtown or in the Pearl to work out right on timing. We'd tried to just drop into Andina once before after hearing positive reviews, but were turned away. \\n\\nWhen I called to ask for a same-day dinner reservation on a Friday I was told they were pretty booked already. I said I'd prefer an early dinner as we had a 7pm commitment. I also shamelessly deployed the \\"And It's My Birthday\\" method to encourage a reservation as well as mentioned the enthusiastic reviews for their veg*n menu that prompted my desire for a birthday dinner there. This conversation prompted their best efforts to get us in and a short time later I was phoned with a confirmation for a 5:30 dinner reservation for 2.\\n\\nWhen we arrived a little early the staff was still completing the set up of the dining room. We were welcomed and directed to the small bar area to have a drink while they finished getting our table ready. Although busy, we found a spot at the bar and ordered drinks. I'd only just begun to appreciate my Mojito de Pina when we were told our table was ready.\\n\\nHere's where Andina gets a star in continuity in making our dinner amazing. A note had been made with our reservation that we were vegan. We didn't even have to ask about the special vegetarian/vegan menu; we were presented with it when seated and never even saw the omni/meat menu. Still enjoying the awesome cocktails we perused the menu with delight and picked out a few small plates to enjoy a large variety of the offerings.\\n\\nWe were making our way with delight through the mixed vegetable cebiche, a vegan version of the causa, grilled asparagus, and the 3 potato plate someone from the kitchen staff came to our table with two small plates for each of us, compliments of the chef! Each plate contained a gorgeous tower of quinoa salad perched on a small coin of shiitake mushroom, drizzled with a red pepper sauce. Understand that I don't actually like mushrooms, neither does my wife. However, when the chef sends you out a specially prepared vegan tapas just for your birthday dinner... well, we had to try it!. Not really liking mushrooms notwithstanding, this was one of the most amazing things we were served all night!\\n\\nWe each had another fabulous cocktail, my choice being the Margarita Pintada. The drinks were all delicious and beautifully presented. That said, the Margarita Pintada is impressively beautiful!\\n\\nWell fed and well pleased with the whole dinner experience we expected our check to arrive. Nope, Andina wasn't done impressing us yet. Out came a totally unexpected dessert for us to share! Three small scoops of a cucumber melon sorbet garnished with mint leaves and a tiny chrysanthemum blossom. This gorgeous and tasty surprise dessert was presented on a long, white plate upon which 'Happy Birthday' had been written with dark chocolate in Spanish.\\n\\nSeriously. Wow.

In fact, I can think of pizza parlors in Amarillo and Oregon that I would much rather patronize -- and not because I'm not a thin crust girl. Because Austin obviously needs to step up its collective game. \\n\\nThe ingredients and beer selection are great, the service is fine, and the atmosphere is fun; I also totally appreciate the craft and spectacle of hand-tossed pizza dough. All the right elements are in place, so I'm not sure why it all falls a bit flat. Like I said, though... you won't find better without going to another city."},{"name":"Frank","address":"407 Colorado St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I came here for brunch about a week ago. The bartenders were super friendly and fun, and even introduced me to my first Tito's bacon infused bloody mary-- which was pretty good. As much as I hate to admit it, nothing tops a ZingZang bloody for me but this was definitely tasty and a little different.\\n\\nTo eat I had the Pork Belly Breakfast tacos. Now, before you put the relish on there is nothing super special about these tacos-- they're good, but not memorable. After putting the relish on, they are mind-blowing!

I blame my cravings on my holiday to a place that didn't have a large variety of restaurants.\\n\\nFirst, the soup is quite tasty. I didn't taste the MSG burn that so many other soups seem to have. It's on the salty side but I like my soup a little salty; it makes the noodles nicer.\\n\\nNext, the meat was quite good. I accidentally left them in the broth a little too long, so they were a little over-cooked but that's my mistake. \\n\\nI also had a spring roll and it was fine, not overly greasy and the dipping sauce was quite nice.\\n\\nGood pricing, the service is pretty good and if you get the chance, you should try their watermelon slush.

There's a reason for that, I can't stand how over priced and over packed South Austin is. I do like adventure and trying new things, though. Date day last Sunday consisted of the husband and I catching up with some old pals. One pal lives in South Austin and highly recommended this place so we met him here for a late lunch.\\n\\nWARNING ABOUT PARKING: First of all, South Congress on a Sunday is an absolute nightmare. It is PACKED with traffic, there is nowhere to park and if you're not from Austin, two things you should know: 1. People here can't park. 2. Since everyone and their brother has moved here from out of state, people here can't drive.\\n\\nHome Slice is on this small plot shared with a women's boutique next to it. They have like 5-6 parking spots in front of the establishment and then there's 5-6 to the left of their building and 5-6 to the right. I almost feel bad for the people who live in the neighborhood behind it cause their streets are filled with people parking in front of their houses. You're gonna have a hard time backing out of the front of this area cause you'll be reversing onto SoCo (South Congress for you out-of-towners.) Unless you're an expert at finding parking and can reverse without getting hit or hitting someone, take a Lyft or Uber.\\n\\nI got lucky and parallel parked on the side street near Home Slice that the Hey Cupcake! trailer is set up next to. End rant.\\n\\nACTUALLY GOING INSIDE TO EXPERIENCE THE AWESOME: Walk inside, wow is it packed. This is a pretty small joint, to give you an idea \\n of how small, there was a family of five in front of us at the host station and we were up against the front door. Spoke to the charming host to get a table reserved and I was offered outside seating or indoor. The husband prefers A/C so I requested indoor seating.The host said it would be about a 40 minute wait. He took my name, I wasn't handed a pager or anything but he told me I could go out back to their patio and grab a drink from the bar if I'd like. Our group of 4 went on out back where we caught up with each other on life.\\n\\nThat patio was just as packed as it was inside. No sitting room, only standing. The tables out back were covered by shade from large trees and canopies that Home Slice has to cover them, very energetic, loud atmosphere but it was a happy one.\\n\\nI waited about 30 minutes and I noticed another host came out onto the back patio and had a tablet (I'm assuming with reservation names.) I asked if he was looking for Christina C and he told me not yet. I decided to go inside and scope out how full it was. I noticed 3 empty tables that hadn't been cleaned off just yet so I assumed one would be ours. I checked with the charming host I originally spoke with and I didn't even have to bring up the empty tables, he just let me know that the booth behind him would be ours and they're getting it clean right now. Sweet!\\n\\nTHE EATING EXPERIENCE: We finally get seated and one of our friends is legit from New York so he has been skeptical about this place since we told him we were coming here. He kept saying there was no way this was authentic New York pizza, just no way. \\n\\nHusband and I order 2 Mexican Cokes, our friends get regular fountain drinks. Our waitress was an absolute joy, we cracked jokes with her and she was all the charismatic I could ask for. 10/10 would have again. We ordered 2 orders of garlic knots (comes with 4 each order) and we ordered just a large pepperoni pizza and a large margherita pizza.\\n\\nWe got the garlic knots first, that took about 10 minutes to get. Devoured them, we were so hungry (no one had eaten that day and one of our friends is hardcore dieting so he purposely didn't eat the day before so he could indulge.) Then the pizzas came out about 20-25 minutes later. The pizzas were HUGE!!! We actually destroyed the pepperoni pizza and there was about 3 slices of margherita left. Our New York buddy approved, by the way. He said it's authentic!\\n\\nThe only reason this is a 4 start review is the location/parking and the wait. Other than that, the food was surprisingly good! I thought it was just gonna be same old pizza you would get from Papa John's, but it was perfect. Pizza is very greasy, you will ruin your clothing if you don't eat it right. The sauce wasn't sweet which is a plus in my opinion and this is vegetarian friendly. This place would be an awesome first date place (we did see some couples that appeared to be on a first date) but if you're not into crowds, go with the take out. Just make sure you have someone with you to circle the block and pick you back up."},{"name":"Bar 145","address":"955 W 5th Ave","city":"Columbus","stars":"3","text":"went for burger and acoustic live music night.

Where it fell short for me was in the execution. They have an authentic pizza oven, but the crust wasn't up to snuff. The middle was thin enough that it was getting soggy by the end of the meal. The edge was thicker, but didn't rise as much (or develop the kind of structure) as this dough style should, so it resulted in a unpalatably gummy finish for each slice I ate. The toppings were good, but when the crust quality falls short of a chain pizzeria like Bertuccis (which serves the same style), I can't see returning to this place at these prices. \\n\\nService was fine for the price point, and the space is well-lit and attractive. The music was a bit loud for my taste, but I'm a crotchety old man. \\n\\nFinally, I want to say that the open kitchen idea might be a mistake at this place. It's neat to see the pizza oven, but sometimes there are things I'd rather not see. While I was eating, one of the young gentlemen working behind the counter sneezed into his arm, wiped his nose with his hand, and then scratched his arm and hair while conversing with a fellow pizzaiolo. He then returned to food preparation without regloving. Look: I know this type of stuff goes on everywhere.

I have celiac disease, so most pizza places are out, although more and more offer a gluten-free crust option. Of course, they also charge an arm and a leg for gluten-free crust, and I don't think I'll ever get used to having to pay fifteen to eighteen dollars for a stupid little pizza. Via 313 didn't change my mind, either. As a matter of fact, it pushed me in the opposite direction. I've started to consider never eating pizza again. Via 313 is all about the thick crust. It's more like pizza cake than pizza. If you're a thin-crust fan, think twice before eating here. Anyway, the gluten-free pizza was mediocre, as was the regular pizza, according to my companion. Very little in the way of toppings on a thick crust just doesn't cut it.

I want the Chinese food that reminds me of the Midwest where the egg rolls are so hot and phat, the grease will seep through the bag.  Where you can get almond cookies that make your teeth feel squeaky.  Where the shrimp egg foo young are big brown discs drenched in a salty savory gravy that gels when you refrigerate it. Where the words, dragon, lucky, garden, kitchen, happy, or golden show up somewhere in the business name.  Is that what I found at Happy House?  Kinda.  \\nI had the General Tso's chicken and shrimp fried rice.  The chunks of chicken were large and crisp, but the sauce was too syrupy sweet and reminded me of that chain \\"Chinese\\" place with the bear-esque mascot.  The shrimp fried rice was tender, delicious and packed with the plump pink crustaceans.  The two dishes were enough food for three meals at least. The decor of the location is something right out of the 70's where the dining room is large, long, and filled with plastic flowers.  It's connected to a bar that I'm most certain has it's own rendition of Cheers characters. Each person came in, nodded greetings to the waitstaff and slunk off into darkness of the bar. The service is friendly, eager and chatty, which was a nice welcome.\\nThe location is kind of awkward and might take some finagling to get into the lot if you are driving in off of Maryland.  I'll definitely return because it's fairly priced, the portions are abundant and there are more dishes to try!

The restaurant is available half a block down from Peachtree St on 14th. You seat yourself after receiving a number while ordering at the bakery counter. The staff will also take your drink order as you queue up. You pick up your drinks at the counter which not everyone seemed to understand. It also leads to a bit of clutter as people stand around the ordering line waiting for their drink. The staff seemed a little ornery trying to connect customers with their drinks. Condiments and boxes for leftovers can be found across from the bakery counter.\\n\\nWe all ordered coffee (a latte, a chai latte and a straight coffee). The drink orders were prepared quickly and everyone was more or less satisfied.\\n\\nThe menu is pretty standard fare with a few dishes which seemed to warrant investigation. One such dish was the peanut butter french toast. This comes with bananas and a drenching of caramel sauce.  The french toast was very thick and as a result a little dry. The dish overall was very sweet, probably too sweet for most. It could easily be split and given that it is very reasonably priced. However, bananas are sparse and just sort of thrown on. This left the presentation kind of crudely done. Overall, this was the best dish we had in terms of value but nothing special.\\n\\nWe also had a burrito de huevos. This dish is mostly just a tortilla wrapped around eggs served with beans. The portion size is again generous but the flavor is extremely forgettable and the presentation sloppy.\\n\\nFinally, we had an omelet where we chose the fillings. Definitely the worst value of the three dishes, a barely noticeable addition of pepper, onions, mushrooms, etc., cost 60 cents each to add. This added up quickly. Additionally, we got a double helping of meat but you would never know it. The spinach was way over cooked and for some reason all the fillings were served on the side. Worse yet, the egg was very thick and unremarkable. Altogether, it was overpriced and very disappointing.\\n\\nI admit that we didn't get any of their baked goods so this might be an unfair assessment of something dubbed a bakery but I can't recommend this place for brunch.  I'm sure Atlanta can do better."},{"name":"Mary Mac's Tea Room","address":"224 Ponce De Leon Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Arrived at Mary Mac's at 12 and was seated received our drinks promptly.

The waiter asked Susan Reed several times to  remove the salad from the ticket.  She refused and was argumentative and treated me extremely rudely while trying to diffuse situation rather than handling things in a customer oriented manner.  I guess Ms. Reed feels vindicated for collecting $10 for a meal served late.  In my opinion, she has much to learn about treating customers right and organizational leadership, especially in the restaurant business.

The bar is good-looking and clean, and features a wide variety of beers on tap and a great selection of bottled beer. The staff is quick to serve and refill and the prices are average and reasonable.\\n\\nOverall though, around 10pm this place really isn't too crowded and is sparsely populated.

To tell the truth, everything in the coconut tasted the same, all covered by the flavor of thai curry. The freshness of the seafood ingredient was also questionable. As a so called Thai restaurant, neither the owner (a lady) or the waiter appeared to be Thai. Not sure about the chef. In the end to my surprise, the bill came as handwritten.

It's more than a couple levels above your average fast food burger. \\n\\nPlace was fairly packed on a Friday night, and the line was out the door. Order at the counter and they bring your food out to you. There were 10 or so parties ahead of us and it took about 15 minutes for our turn to place our order. You can build your own burger or choose from one of their specialty burgers. I really enjoy the Dixie burger here, which comes with pimiento cheese, a fried green tomato, Carolina cole slaw, and chipotle ranch. So good it'll have you saying \\"y'all\\" all night. The burgers are fairly greasy, but extremely worth it. Burgers are ~$7 for a single, ~$9 for a double. They do not take the yelp check in offer. \\n\\nYou can make it a combo with fries and a fountain drink for $2.99 more. The fries are crinkle-cut, and they have both regular and sweet potato. They're ok, nothing special. They also have salads (if you're into that sort of thing), hot dogs, shakes (and boozy shakes). They have a full bar and nice selection of local beers on tap, including the ever elusive Creature Comforts Tropicalia! Food comes out in like 10 minutes after you order. \\n\\nPlenty of seating, and they have a screened in patio outside with heaters for when it's chilly out. \\n\\nParking can be slightly difficult- it's a one-way lot and it seems to always be full.

Call me asian, but when I read lobster roll review after review after review, I was thinking it was a lobster (sushi) roll! I didn't have time to look at any pics, so just went by the reviews. I was surprised to find that the lobster roll was a texas toast bun (in 1/2) with a lobster salad. The chunks of lobster were fresh - props!  (By the way, did I mention that I told me entire table that the lobster rolls got rave reviews, so everyone ordered it? It was our first visit.)  Everyone thoroughly enjoyed it! Personally, I just do not like \\"cold\\" dishes. Even when it comes to subs/sandwiches, I always prefer a hot sandwich over a cold ... because this was a cold sandwich, I didn't like it as much as I thought it was. However, I can recognize quality, and I tell you... it was real, quality lobster meat. It wasn't too salty nor sweet, it was fine - just cold ... (but normal!). \\n\\nAlso ordered the she crab soup. It was delicious as others mentioned. I read in a couple people's reviews that they were disappointed that the soup did not have chunks of crab meat. It was a puree. Regardless, the soup was delicious. Very thin puree, so don't expect anything too thick.  Our server told us up front that the soup did not have chunks of crab. She did good! \\n\\nService was excellent ... she was at our table refilling our waters every few minutes.

However, they're quite misleading when they say it's an open kitchen in the middle of the restaurant.

It tasted slightly spicy and watery.\\n - Bronzed scallops: the first couple of bites were good, but I really needed something to break it up. The flavor was almost making me ill by the end of the meal. But I was starving, so I ate it (barely). The scallops were perfectly cooked, but I think the flavor of the grits with them were a bit off-putting.

Once their food came out, out frustration was expressed, and the manager had the nerve to give us attitude about it. We asked to speak to another manager who gave us the same attitude back.

With the word Mac in their name you would think that their Mac and cheese would be consistently great.  Today it was just cooked noodles with a layer of cheese on it.  The worse thing about it that it was Luke warm.  The fried chicken was not cooked to order, it also was look warm.  The sweet potAtoe souffl√© has the sweet potAtoe but no souffl√© about it.  Last but not least the peach cobbler, omg now I know this is a huge restaurant and they are very busy but we are in Georgia, the peach capital of the world I think.  I would think it would be loaded with flavor like cinnamon, nutmeg allspice sugar something.  No no no,  I promise you this is nothing more than opening a can of peaches and cooking a pretty decent dough on top.  It also was luke warm more cold, and it was suppose to be ala mode!  I thought ala mode meant hot with ice cream.  The two stars are for the croquettes that were really good and the shrimp and oysters.  Otherwise I would have asked yelp to allow a zero star button for today.  Very disappointed.  The worse part was the waiter.  Omg he was something else.  My mother in law ordered the chicken goodness it could have still flown away with all the feathers on it.  It also was warm and not just out the fryer hot!  Fresh chicken straight out the fryer you can't even touch and when you break a leg the steam comes off.  We mentioned that to the waiter and in his outside voice he told her I wish you would have said something before you ate half of the chicken.  This ding bat then says well they cook chicken all day so yes it's fresh.  I says was it cooked to order he says yes people order it all day lmao!  Just rude their was three whole wings on the plate and the other was picked over not eaten.  This nut stormed off and we can hear the kitchen door slam open, when he came back you hear him say the F word then he turns around and with my mouth reading skills you see him say the F word.  That was enough for me.  As you know you just don't send food back by a fool like that.  But all and all I paid the whole bill, they don't have to worry because I think this visit was a flop and they couldn't offer me a refund to come back.  But you know what, I wrote him a nice note and told him we didn't appreciate the service or comments.  Our bill was $62 and I nicely told him even with the bad service and cold food as to not be stereotyped as the blacks that complain their way out if a bill, never tip or tip cheap, I tipped him $15 to help him get his ignorant self together.

And it was perfect!  \\n\\nIt is a very small restaurant right off the main 6th street strip (which, in my opinion, is full of tourist traps, but I don't really have much knowledge of the area to base this off of.  Just a gut feeling, I guess).  I walked in around 615 and the place was fairly empty.  By 630 it was packed with people waiting for tables.  I guess you could say it's a well liked establishment.

He greeted me with a smile and asked what I would like to drink.  \\n\\nI started with a glass of the Giacomo Borgogno, which was full bodied but fruity.  Perfect for the warm day it was.  I opted to stick with appetizers since I was meeting the bf for a late dinner, but had a hard time deciding what to get.  Everything sounded so good!  My little hipster bartender friend helped me out and confirmed what I had already been eyeing: roasted brussel sprouts, pancetta and pecorino romano.  Damn these were delicious.  The chefs roasted them in the pizza oven so they came out super crispy.  The pancetta added a great saltiness to the plate and the cheese was creamy goodness.  I'm glad I didn't have to share with anyone.\\n\\nI was still hungry, so for my second round I tried the prosciutto wrapped mozzarella with balsamic.  Salty and sweet, my favorite flavor combination.  I went with another recommendation from my bartender friend and had the primativo for my second glass of wine.  This was one of the more delicious wines I have had in recent memory.  The berry flavor was like a punch in the face of deliciousness.\\n\\nAll in all I was very pleased with my experience at Backspace, not only for the food, but also for my brave attitude to dine alone hehe.

The parking is ample out back. There seems to be lots going on food/drink wise in many different areas. You can go see a movie for free while you're there and there is a soak pool. The room looked comfortable as well. I would definitely stay here. Maybe I'll take a staycation some night! It's also very convenient to NE Alberta where there is lots going on... although I'm not sure why you'd need to leave the Kennedy School once you decided to check in!"},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"After a long drive from Sacramento, my wife and I were eager to visit our third location among many. Our first encounter was in Denver, then at Universal City, but this location was the 1st of them all. These little monster creations would span several states and eventually have one in Orlando. This place can cast a spell on me any day. Get your cravings on at Voodoo Doughnut in Portland, Oregon.\\n\\nLocated on the west side of the Willamette River on the northeast corner, SW 3rd Ave./SW Akeney St., you will find a brick building with some fencing containing some hyper customers which is home to the FIRST and ORIGINAL Voodoo Doughnut location. My wife and I know the spiel of Voodoo and their humorous design, but delicious doughnuts. There are names that I cannot say here, but due to Universal City location, I was able to keep my composure...to an extent.\\n\\nWe were there around 7-8pm on a Monday evening and there was a long line. However, we knew what we were getting ourselves into. The wait for us was about 10-15 minutes before getting to the door. If you are outside of the door, PLEASE KEEP THE DOOR CLOSED! It's to avoid any outside bugs coming in and stealing a spot in line. Just like the other locations, it was jumping like it was a liquidation sale. The first thing you will see is the stack of PINK VOODOO BOXES. If you don't see that, then you should leave and find the real Voodoo quickly!\\n\\n**REMEMBER, CASH ONLY!!** They do have ATMs inside, but its best to have cash ready before you get here. Portland, OR is not exactly how my wife remembered it many years ago.\\n\\nYou will see some cool merchandise/memorabilia on the wall as well as the rotating glass box filled with delicious Voodoo delicacies. All of the purchases were not for me. They were for family that I was going to deliver these to. My wife asked me: Are you sure you want to be getting those doughnuts? I smiled. My intention during this visit was something that you keep in your pants. As we approached the counter, my wife wanted ONE thing: As for me, I would never order this outside of Voodoo. I told the guy I wanted two CnB Doughnuts. He was like...What is that?! I wasn't sure if he wanted me to say it, but I realized that it was a genuine understanding that he has never heard of that before. He went to check the back, but there was only one available. However, he was willing to offer me a Vegan CnB for free. Yay and Thank You Universal City location on abbreviating the CnB for me! Of course, I had to get two Voodoo Doughnuts as a signature ending.\\n\\nAlthough my wife gave this location three (3) stars, I had to put Customer Service first over availability of items. Yeah, I wanted more CnBs, but the guy offered me a free doughnut from the case and that alone showed me that profit is not a big thing. Making people leave with a happy ending does. Hmmm...Perhaps, I shouldn't have stated it that way since I did order the CnB Doughnuts. Voodoo you keep doing your magic more than the mouse can and I will always will come to find you. I need more Voodoo in my life so I don't have to take it on the airplane and get stared at or drive thousands of miles for your deliciousness!\\n\\nThe Yelp Journey you take is an inspiration for others.

We were standing there a good 5 mins and the chick at the counter could've told us we were on the wrong side cuz we were standing at the counter. That's just bad customer service on her end. We ended up having to get on the right side and waited some more. Maybe there should be a clear sign on where u need to go once u are inside.

Minimalist menu, and retro-esque design. I enjoy that. I also appreciate the dedication of places such as LBB to using as-local-as-possible ingredients for their menus.\\n\\nThe burger, as the name suggests, is little, yet big. It's a 1/4-pounder, but it's not flattened out as most 1/4-pounders are typically served. It's a little thicker, so the finished product is slightly bigger than your typical slider. So I'm more than a little amused at the flurry of \\"THEY'RE TOO DAMN SMALL\\" comments about these burgers. It's a 1/4-pounder dudes! It just looks smaller!\\n\\nBut given the gluttonous portions at say, Five Guys, LBB's portions are a lot friendlier on the wallet and the waistline. \\n\\nThe burger was very moist & juicy, and was cooked medium as advertised. It was topped with diced red onions, shredded lettuce, and thin-sliced pickles. The combination of veggies was a very sweet counterbalance to the savoriness of the burger. And all that, in between a brioche bun. \\n\\nThe fries were tasty, but unremarkable even with the truffle shuffle they were given. Also, although their house catsup is billed as being Sriracha-infused, I didn't detect it at all.\\n\\nFirst time I'd been out to the Boise/Mississippi Ave. neighborhood, and LBB will guarantee many future returns."},{"name":"Cadillac Cafe","address":"1801 NE Broadway St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I like this place.

It was wonderfully rich and had a hint of spice.  It was perfect with the lime served with it.  My tandoori shrimp was cooked just right with bold flavor and no chewiness.  For a side, I ordered the rooti (whole wheat flatbread) instead of the fatty naan and a side of raita.  The rooti was really good even though the owner told me not to order it, but the raita was off.  It was so sickly sweet and watery that I couldn't take it - I've never had sweetened raita so maybe this is a Bangladeshi thing?\\n\\nThe service & experience:  The manager/owner was very interested in whether we had been there before.  Making a reservation was easy, but we had to wait for a while even though there were plenty of tables available.  Then we had to wait an unusually long time for anyone to take our orders.

I love their happy hour, which even runs on weekends. But my meal on NYE was outstanding! It was a grilled chicken served on a bed of quinoa risotto. Now being a natural food fanatic, I've had quinoa before. Bleh. But this really was outstanding. It was tossed with toasted nuts and peas and it had a rich flavor that made you forget you were eating a \\"healthy grain.\\" Although a tad too salty, it was still delicious. I took home leftovers and mixed them with brown rice to make another meal at home.\\n\\nThe location isn't the easiest to find but trust me, it's worth looking for.

In the past I've had the cinnamon crunch bagel and those things can be a little addictive. They also have a good chicken salad sandwich not the best that I've had but pretty good. As far as internet surfing goes, it's very good! Lots of seating and if you get lucky you may get a table next to an electrical outlet if you need to charge your laptop, pad, or phone because they have a few but not many spread out around the store. This may not be a good place to study because sometimes there are large groups of people gathered at the big tables having meetings or get togethers, and they can get noisy sometimes.

This time, I was with several friends and we opted to get snacks or smaller meals along with some drinks in the bar, which is separate from the dining areas and allows guests to seat themselves wherever tables are available. The bar menu has a fair amount of hearty meals, though it's just a fraction of what's available in the restaurant.\\n\\nWe ordered a dozen native oysters to start. I should've known to get their namesake oysters when I came last year. These were possibly the best raw, no-frills oysters I've ever had! We all loved them so much that we ordered another dozen. We devoured them in seconds.\\n\\nFor my personal snack, I got Clams Casino. It's clams baked with cheese and a little piece of bacon in each. I never knew baked clams could be so good! I could've eaten a dozen more of these! I also had a cup of clam chowdah. I personally prefer Manhattan clam chowder (sorry, New Englanders), but you can't find that in Boston.

OMG it was so delicious, if you are even a vague fan of short ribs, definitely order these. The meat was fall-apart tender, ultra flavorful and melty. Clearly these short ribs were expertly seasoned and cooked for a substantial amount of time. I appreciate the chef's effort to make these as good as they were. They were served with an unusual, cold potato - egg - pasta salad which was flavorful but not to the point that it competed with the short rib. Good paring, I thought.\\n\\nMy husband ordered the chili short rib dish and enjoyed it so much that I only got the tiniest little taste.

All the condiments were served in little plastic containers.

A lot of complaints I read are about the massive lines and long waits, which is to be expected honestly since Voodoo donuts seems more like a novelty place for locals and a tourist trap.

It's a clean place, with many treats to choose from. We got a bunch.

All of the donuts there are extremely sweet and choc-filled with candy toppings, frostings, and just a ton of sugar. So be aware. The staff are really helpful and always willing to recommend some favourites it seems. The price also isn't too bad.\\n\\nThe only thing I didn't like about Voodoo donuts and why it gets 4 stars instead of 5 is the fact that they are cash only. It's 2015, a lot of people like myself just don't always have cash on them. Though for those without cash, they have an atm inside of the donut shop where you can get cash.

For me, it's all about the crust.\\n\\nThese guys got it right.  Their pies are the bomb.  Only possible complaint would be that they could add a little salt to the dough for flavor.\\n\\nAlso, don't bother w carryout.  Pizza needs to be eaten there.  At the bar.\\n\\nGreat staff too.  Desserts rock too.\\n\\nGet their cheese pizza with the arugula on top.  AMAZING.  Margherita awesome too.  I have a hard time getting excited about Parkside with it's little brother in the back ready to kick big brother's azz.  \\n\\nBackspace does what only few restaurants do. . .make you crave their food."},{"name":"Camelot Cellars","address":"901 Oak St","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"Just wanted to write a quick bit not about the wine, but the FOOD and the service.\\nI came in on blah rainy Wednesday night in need of a quiet but inviting atmosphere and found it here.\\nThe food is handmade with love by Exec.

It's all about the amazing flavors.  \\nA few key tips: \\n1.  Make reservations.  This restaurant is tiny and that's a good thing.  It's in an old, but cute, restored house.  They used all recycled materials and local craftsman.   I counted three 2-tops, two 4-tops, and an 8-top communal table.   There's also a bar counter.   You may get seated at the bar or the communal table.   Bottom line, the smaller footprint allows the chef to focus on the food but you really need reservations.   \\n \\n2.  Carpool.   No valet (thank god) but very small parking lot in front and back.  If the patrons from an earlier seating haven't left yet, you may have difficulties parking.   \\n\\n3.  If you're in a rush, go elsewhere.   We found the service prompt and the food timing to be very good.  But, this is a prix fixe menu which lends itself to a longer than typical dinner.   Savor the food and enjoy the wine, relax.  \\n\\n4.  Be prepared for a 15 minute seating delay.   The tables don't turn quickly so your reservation may get delayed.   We got a call from the hostess while we were in route.   I suggest you call them before you arrive.   The waiting area is outside on the porch and on a cold night it's no bueno (even with the propane heater).   \\n\\n5.  Prix Fixe menu.  The menu changes daily.  Ours had 4 categories to choose from; Field (salads), Sea, Land, Dream (desserts).   Under each category there were 3 options, so a total of 12 options.  You pick any 3 for $38.   Add one for $10.  There are also daily specials on the board.   We had an amazing fresh baked naan bread app.   Our favorites were the salads.  Might get all 3 salads next time.   Dinner is going to run you $100 for two, plus wine and tip.  \\n\\nEnjoy!"},{"name":"Stammtisch","address":"401 NE 28th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Ok so, let's talk about that pretzel.

For the entrees I got the filet mignon($40) and the hubby got the NY strip ($42). Both were excellent but honestly although mine was melt in your mouth awesomeness, his actually had a better flavor. Mine came with fried asparagus (wasn't a big fan of that) and fingerling potatoes (good). His came with blue cheese mashed potatoes (so yummy) and green beans (they were crisp and oh so good). Can you tell I should've switched plates with him? For dessert we had the creme brulee (very creamy and wonderful). Our server was attentive and very friendly,  he didn't treat us like second class citizens or anything for using a Groupon.

If you're a meat-lover, I definitely recommend ordering the $5 side of extra pork cheek and belly with the ramen - lots of flavorful meat for a relatively decent price. Also recommend the bonito-flake-covered takoyaki (octopus balls), although if you're also ordering ramen with it you may want to consider splitting it with someone. The takoyaki can be heavy and very filling! The only thing I've been a bit disappointed in was the steamed bun filled with pork cheek.

If you don't like this place, you don't like Austin.\\n\\nNot the best coffee I've had. Not the most comfortable seating areas. Not the best prices. There may be a dirty table here and there. You might not always like the music ... Keep bitching. It doesn't matter.\\n\\nThe all-vegetarian menu at Bouldin will make all but the most artery-clogged eaters happy. I can't fathom why they got rid of the vegan sloppy joes and the excellent hummus tacos, but the current menu still has good stuff. And the blueberry cornbread ranks up there among the best things you can get at ANY restaurant in Austin. I'm not kidding.\\n\\nAside from the food, what makes this place great is what makes South Austin great: The VIBE. Lisa, Leslie (the co-owner, not the famed cross-dresser) and the rest of the ever-changing but nearly-always-awesome staff bend over backwards (in a typically laid-back South Austin way) to be a part of the neighborhood, and to make everyone who walks in the door feel at home. \\n\\nThe staff (baristas and cooks) take turns playing their favorite CDs. Dogs are welcome in the fairly spacious outdoor seating area. The screened-in patio is a good place to while away several hours (weather permitting). Flyers and literature (by and about local artists and activists) are everywhere. \\n\\nYeah, this IS a good place to people-watch, but there's no hipster posturing going on at Bouldin, at least not from the staff. Reviewers who wrote otherwise are perhaps projecting their own insecurities onto the hard-working, friendly people who work here. I've met some of the best friends I have in Austin by walking in for a beer, or a cup of joe, or a bite to eat, or for a quiet place to read, not intending to talk to anyone, only to end up conversing with a staff member for hours.\\n\\nWhat else? The happy-hour beer/wine specials are not bad. It's a good time to play a game of scrabble, discover some new music and meet an old friend (or make a new one)."},{"name":"Rheinlander German Restaurant","address":"5035 NE Sandy Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"My last meal would be the Bavarian Farmer's Schnitzel and a Blackberry Marguerita!

I'm not sure I've ever had a side dish that phenomenal before. The combination of flavors was simply to die for, and the spiciness was just right. My entire party was raving about them even after we left the restaurant.

There is nothing more to say about the brisket that hasn't already been said already.  It's smoky, moist, and tender.  Absolutely delicious.  The turkey is underrated and extremely moist.  I have a pretty light palate, so many times handmade sausages are on the salty end for me.  However, I think the sausage links I had actually could have used some more seasoning/spices.  They were out of pork ribs this time, but the pork ribs might actually be my favorite order at JMueller.  The smoky, slightly peppery flavor is just glorious, to the point where I have not used an ounce of barbecue sauce on them since my first time here.

I made reservations as this was a special Easter event they advertised with a sign outside stating Easter Egg hunt and brunch.  This was our first and last time eating here.  We arrived and there were no directions as to which door to enter, there are two.  None of the staff was paying any attention to our family standing in the door way.  With a restaurant not even half full and a reservation we had to wait 15 minutes to be seated.  By this point it was about 1:40 as we were a few minutes early.  The egg hunt was scheduled for 2 pm.  So we quickly started getting food for the kids as it was an open brunch.  I'm sure the food was good at some point but what we ate was old dry food that had obviously been sitting out all day.  At about 5 minutes until 2 pm I asked the waitress what we need to do for the egg hunt.  She said go outside at 2.  I looked at my watch and it was 5 minutes till and she also looked at hers and said she hadn't even realized.  And yes my phone is set by the phone company so it should be correct.  My husband was still eating, I told the kids to finish up so we could get outside.  At that point another staff member said the egg hunt was going on outside.  We rushed outside and before 2 pm the egg hunt was already over.  There was no announcement and no organization.  My kids waited all morning for this and there was not one single egg left.  There were not many kids there and could have easily been handled better in several ways.  We asked for the manager who didn't care and just said that the other kids had fun.  As he turned around the staff member who was apparently in charge said to him that it was 2 pm on her watch.  She could have waited to at least be out of ear shot of us, very poor taste.  The manager didn't even offer to refund any our meal which was $30 per person due to the \\"event\\" which lasted about 2 minutes.  We were treated like second rate citizens because we aren't regulars or golfers apparently.  My kids don't deserve that and there is nothing that can replace ruining their Easter event.

Overall, the service was excellent, from the moment I walked in the door until I retrieved my car from the valet. This staff knows customer service!\\n\\nI arrived early for my reservation, in order to check out the The Oyster Bar, since I'd heard raves about the famous punch. There were three on the menu, and I opted for the Pineapple Express. Made with gin, ginger tea, lemon and honey, this drink is an excellent combination of tart and sweet, and is dangerously delicious. \\n\\nThe oysters here are ordered a la carte, similar to the way sushi restaurants do it, and prices range from $2.50 to $3.50. This side of the restaurant seems like a perfect spot to sit and enjoy a casual seafood feast, paired with your libation of choice.\\n\\nThe main dining area is spacious and open, and surprisingly, the noise levels weren't too bad. I found it easy to maintain conversation with my dinner guest, and also enjoy the excellent music. I love a place that plays \\"You Can Have It All\\" by Yo La Tengo. I don't often hear Georgia and Ira in any of my usual in-town haunts.\\n\\nThe menu is completely different from the Oyster Bar, and the oysters are priced at $3.50 each, your choice of East or West coast. Since I had recently been in North Carolina, where I enjoyed an entire peck for $12, I decided to check out some of the other menu items. We started with the spicy Spanish octopus, which was expertly prepared and beautifully plated -- and devoured in a matter of minutes. To accompany our starter, my friend and I ordered the Winter on Cape Cod, essentially an upscale version of the traditional vodka cranberry. The added citrus and herbal notes were a nice touch.\\n\\nFor our entrees, I decided on the crispy triggerfish, served with brussel sprouts and bacon. The sweetness of the fish contrasted nicely with the smokiness of the bacon. A note on that smokiness - due to the wood burning grill, you will leave The Optimist faintly smelling of wood smoke. Not necessarily a bad thing, but you may not want to wear your fanciest dry-clean-only duds. Also, the dinner napkins are white, and very linty, so avoid dark pants or skirts or have a lint brush handy.\\n\\nMy friend raved about her scallop dish, and also informed me the complementary dinner roll was quite good. (No bread for me, alas, due to my gluten allergy. But many of the dishes at The Optimist are naturally gluten free, and Keesha said to just let her know what I wanted, and she'd see if the chef could make it GF for me. Great to have so many options!)\\n\\nBe sure to check out the bathrooms during your stay.

Twice in the last month, we've been there when the restaurant was not busy, plenty of open tables and staff to cover them, many parties already had their food. And yet, we experience things like this: 45 minutes to receive a Cobb Salad. \\n\\nNo. No McMenamins, there's really no excuse for that. Coming from a culinary background I can safely say with confidence that it does not take 45 minutes to grill the chicken which tops the salad, much less to assemble the whole thing. Every ingredient of that salad should have been prepped before opening, including pre-grilling the chicken (if that's how this kitchen operates), but even without the pre-grilling 45 minutes is ridiculous for a salad. Period. \\n\\nThe visit prior (almost exactly a month before) we were seated in a dark corner and forgotten for at least half an hour before being offered the chance to order. That was not the kitchen, of course. But once we *did* order, it took... that's right, about 45 minutes to receive COLD SANDWICHES! No. no. no. Still not okay. \\n\\nLook guys... this is not super complicated food you're purveying. It can be pretty tasty when you're on your game, but it's not like you're cracking open sea urchins for this stuff. Please, be respectful of your customers and pick up the pace a bit.

The food is so yum and so I look forward to trying out other things, especially breakfast (which you can get anytime of day I think).\\n\\nThe sandwich options are creative and they all sound good. We chose the ahi tuna wrap and the katsu poboy. The wrap is perfect for someone who wants something light. Their dressings/sauces are super flavorful. The fries and tots were a little soggy but I bet they're better fresh and eaten right away. I want to try the banh mi next time but I imagine it's good since the baguette for the poboy was legit. Vietnamese coffee was good. Not completely authentic, more like a DD version which works for me since the real stuff usually has me wired for days, but it is called Fusion Cafe after all. Thumbs up!\\n\\nEdit: So, don't be dumb like me and not check hours before going out to eat. They're closed Mondays haha. We came for brunch and while I'm not updating my review by removing stars, I was rather disappointed by our breakfast foods. We got the Irish Beni and Pina Colata Stuffed French Toast. The benedict was okay but salty. I found my French Toast to be off-putting. It was like a French Toast sandwich with fresh fruit in between. Had the fruit been caramelized maybe I would have like it better.\\n\\nBreakfast is my favorite and it would have been cool to see more of the creative fusion like in the sandwiches. Keeping the five stars for our previous visit because I did enjoy the food so much. I might have to just stick to that side of the menu next time though.

Many of you can relate to this, trekking hours or days down a sun-baked highway in a steamy sedan crammed to the gills with kids/pets/luggage to finally arrive at a tourist trap burg like the Wisconsin Dells (\\"RIDE THE DUCKS!\\") or Mammoth Cave (\\"SEE THE EYELESS FISH!\\"). And of course, there were the endless strings of run-down and faded shacks with all manner of goods catering to the tackiest of tastes: fudge, keychains, bumper stickers, and authentic Indian crafts (I could never understand why Indians were living in Taiwan making these to send back to the USA).  Childhood memories of tramping around with my family through these schlock-infested towns remain among my happiest.\\n\\nThus, my arrival at the building housing Lee & Rick's reignited memories of exploits past, eyeing the battleship grey, windowless, shabby stripclub exterior with a sense of nostalgia, not to mention trepidation. Stepping through the door, my eyes struggled to adjust to the dingy lighting and I was immediately walloped with the acrid sting of sanitizer vapors. This unpleasant telltale made me physically hesitate for a moment: you know, I thought to myself, people DIE from eating dirty seafood. \\n\\nThat was then that I noticed Warning Sign #2: glowing restaurant reviews singing praises for Lee and Rick's. From 1980. From 1982.  Okay, there was one from 2000 so at least we're within the same decade, but my past experiences with \\"great restaurants\\" indicated that I might be buying a one-way ticket into a gastrointestinal carnival. Warning Sign #3 was the nearly empty dining area. Hmmm.\\n\\nYet I remembered that sometimes, one is rewarded when looking past the cover of a book and that Lee and Rick's couldn't have survived the past 60 years on reputation alone. Girding my loins, I ventured forth as I seated myself at the well-worn aqua-hued raw bar. \\n\\nA quick perusal of the two-page menu revealed a number of intriguing raw and cooked items. Oysters on the half-shell figured prominently, along with snow crab, crawfish, and clams. I started with a dozen oysters, which is to say a half-dozen more than I usually order. Mom loves to slurp down these little pearl-making delicacies but my limit is tested if pushed to consume more than six.\\n\\nMy shucker donned heavy rubber gloves and cheerfully cleaned and rapidly set before me beautifully cleaned bivalves recently extracted from the sparkling waters of Apalachicola Bay. It's absolutely wonderful to watch your server pound and lever your meal into submission right before your eyes. A few drops of hot sauce and some freshly grated horseradish on each and down they went. \\n\\nThe oysters were absolutely impeccable, a little on the large side for me yet delicious and pristine, completely devoid of shell shards that you sometimes get from less-capable shucking hands.  I savored the oyster liqueur and made quick work of my dozen, happily making their way from shell to tongue.  By the way, 12 personally cleaned mollusks only set me back $6.95. The per-oyster price in many restaurants approaches that figure so these are an incredible value for the quality you get.\\n\\nSteamed peel-and-eat shrimp were up next. These arrive piping hot, tossed in Old Bay seasoning and accompanied by drawn butter. I am not a big fan of peel-and-eat (I'm kinda lazy) but these were well worth the effort of shelling. They were done just right, removed from the cooker before they started toughening and were really delicious.\\n\\nI wanted to keep going so I asked my new shucker friend about cooked items such as the fried shrimp.  She was noncommittal, saying \\"A lot of people order those\\" but her manner and expression told me that I might want to choose something else. \\n\\nOh well, in for a penny, in for a pound. I decided to sample the fried shrimp in a basket anyway. Neatly butterflied and lightly breaded, these were also very tender, and served with crinkle-cut fries and cole slaw. However, they seemed to be a little too uniform (read: portion-controlled) and a query to the server confirmed they were sourced from a food service vendor. \\n\\nThat's too bad. I'd love to recommend everything on the menu, but just can't make that leap right now. Clearly, the shining stars are the fresh raw and steamed seafood and if you stick to those you'll be in like Flint. As I looked around the raw bar at other orders, that seemed to be the consensus anyway.  One note: although the restaurant was virtually empty upon arrival, it quickly filled in and I imagine it gets very busy at peak times.\\n\\nThis rough-around-the-edges establishment is not for the faint of heart so you won't see Caspar Milquetoast sitting on the barstool next to you.  Have some courage though, and you'll be well rewarded. For a genuine local experience in Orlando, shy away from the plethora of chains in this ultimate of tourist trap towns and checkout Lee and Rick's."},{"name":"Top of the Hub","address":"800 Boylston St, Ste 52","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Here's the thing - you can't beat the view.

The Lobster soup was definitely a stand-out, but the Caesar salad was over-dressed and a bit fishy (from the anchovy in the dressing). The Kobe beef hot dogs were okay... a bit too \\"Fenway\\" for fine dining. The chicken flat bread was bland. The mussels were pretty good.

I actually liked the hearts better than the octopus kebobs, but I admit that Andina did a great job making the octopus chewy without being rubbery. Also chimichurri, yum. Keep in mind that small size tapas come with just 1 piece each.\\n\\nHowever, when I visit a restaurant, I fully expect the entr√©e to be the highlight of my meal. And unfortunately, none of the three were. We ordered the arroz con pato (duck confit over cilantro-infused rice), the lomo saltado (a Peruvian classic), and the seco a la Norte√±a (slow-cooked lamb shank over garlic rice). The duck stubbornly clings to the bone and is extremely dry - I used up so much effort trying to cut the meat from the bone and from chewing it that I was too tired to savor the flavor. As for the lomo, if you had blindfolded me, I wouldn't have been able to tell it apart from any other piece of well-done steak. The lamb was definitely the best of the three, but even then, it was nothing lam-azing.\\n\\nFINAL VERDICT: Palatable if you've never eaten Peruvian food before. Would recommend happy hour instead, since the tapas are cheaper. And that's really all that you need to try from the menu, anyway."},{"name":"Am√©lie's French Bakery & Caf√©","address":"840 Marietta St NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Asparagus soup!

Lenoir did not disappoint, and the best part was actually the service. We were seated at the end of the long table, which we've actually never sat at, and after a few minutes, the hostess came to ask if I would be more comfortable at one of the high tops. After I thought for a second about my ever increasing back pain, I told her yes I'd appreciate that. So thoughtful, and the lighting was much better! \\n\\nOur waiter was super helpful about explaining the menu, and we both ordered very different meals and loved them. He got poke, cold noodles, and quail while I had pistachio crusted fish, goat crepe, and spiced cake with cheddar ice cream. His meal was super light and fresh with watermelon balancing all the flavors, and my meal was rich and sheer perfection with lots of fresh figs! We both ate every last bite. The waiter even assured me the ice cream was made with pasteurized cheese, and I didn't even ask! \\n\\nI'm just amazed at the level of detail and service, and I already thought so highly of this restaurant after so many consistently wonderful visits.

It is unique to the restaurant - a well made old style molasses ale. It featureed a malty, sweet flavor that absolutely invoked the kind of ale available in colonial times. \\n\\nWe had to reminder the waiter to grab our cornbread (nice guy, but he was swamped), It was amazing. The caramelized edges added so muhc flavor.\\n\\nMy entree was the catch of the day, a filet of sole that I chose to be blackened. The meal was fine - no complaints but nothing to write home about either. The fish comes with three small boiled potatoes in butter, which was good for what it was. A couple people opted for the lazy mans lobster, which was pretty good nice blend of everything that I thought tasted better than my meal. \\n\\nUnfortunately, the lobster newburg one person ordered was undercooked (sherry sauce was bitter). She took a few bites before she sent it back and she threw up in the middle of the night. But to the restaurant's credit, they recognized the problem as soon as the meal went back to the kitchen and replaced it with another entree and offered free desserts for the table. That was much appreciated.\\n\\nIn our dessert rounds I ordered coffee with baileys and amaretto. It was the best thing i had all night! So well balanced, and I am not a coffee person by any means. For the actual dessert, I had the indian pudding. It was very earthy in a good way. It had a unique flavor and grainy texture. I am glad i tried it!

It should be noted that this place is vegetarian with plenty of vegan options, so if that puts you off you're going to miss out on a fantastic breakfast, we could probably all eat a little less meat anyhow.  \\n\\nWhile the wait time can be long (especially on weekends), get some coffee or a drink (beer / wine only) and go outside and relax a bit while waiting for a table.  Sometimes there are even pop-up shops to poke around in.  \\n\\nOn to the food... wide selection of scrambles, basic breakfasts (sans meat), tacos... as well as some house specials.  The eggs renedict is top notch if you're lucky enough to get it before it's sold out (I always have).  However, I'm a cheap bastard so I gravitate towards the tacos.  They are HUGE for around $3.50.  Pair a taco with a side of mixed beans and a cup of coffee and you have a perfect (healthy) breakfast for under 10 dollars. \\n\\nHaving gluten free and vegan options is also a win if you seem to have an increasingly amount of friends with 'dietary' preferences."},{"name":"Rossi Bar And Kitchen","address":"895 N High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"This is my first review.  The food was so poor at Rossi that I felt obligated to share my experience.\\n\\nMy wife and I love to eat out and try new restaurants.  This is our first visit to Rossi.  We like the Short North and have been meaning to try this place.  Our meal started with the appetizer special.  It was described as sort of an antipasti: olives, cheese, veg, etc.  What arrived was embarrassing, for lack of a better word.  The pickled vegetables looked like they were dumped out of a jar.  The deviled egg seemed off, and there was a handful of croutons on the side that must have come out of a bag.  Then we got our main courses.  My wife ordered salmon on mushroom risotto and I got chicken on a savory bread pudding.  The salmon was fishy and oily.   Bad enough that we sent it back (I can't remember ever sending food back, fwiw).  My chicken was standing in a pool of butter and it was very high in salt.  After a few bites, I was done.  My wife got a pasta meal as a replacement and it was as buttery as my chicken.  At this point, we were both done, our stomachs were actually bothering us.\\n\\nOn the upside, the waiter was nice and she understood we didn't care for our meals and did not charge us for them.\\n\\nI'd go back for a drink, the place is cool, but the food was memorably bad."},{"name":"Not Your Average Joe's","address":"4C Wayside Rd","city":"Burlington","stars":"3.5","text":"Food and service is phenomenal!!

I highly recommend  you attack that bowl and get into the noodles as soon as it is placed in front of you. If you wait any longer, the noodles will saturate and get soggy. And that is a shame.. \\n\\nI observed that there are 2 kinds of noodles used.  A finer noodle is used on the Tokyo, Black and White , while a larger gauged noodle is used for the Spicy.

When I finally made my way to Portland for a visit recently, I knew I had to stop by. Lucky for me, my hotel was right across the street. The line was long almost every time we went by. On Saturday night we decided the line was probably about as short as it was gonna get and we waited. Even though it seemed long, it moved pretty fast so don't be discouraged! When we finally got inside, it was a bit bigger than I thought it was going to be. They had 3 registers, which is why the line moved fairly fast, and display cases with rotating doughnuts so you can see clearly what you want to order. I ended up getting myself 4 doughnuts: Maple Bacon, ODB, Voodoo Doll, and Sprinkles. They all lived up to my expectations! I ate the ODB that night while fresh, and it was amazing. That was probably my favorite, however it was ridiculously sweet and would probably make me sick if I ate it too often haha. The other 3 made the trip back home with me and I have to say they held up super well. Even after a day or two the donuts still tasted really good. Maple Bacon was a lot better than I thought it might be; it really is a good flavor combo. The Voodoo Doll was  yummy and I liked the raspberry jelly but it also was really sweet. The Sprinkles, which I got so I could try one of their more traditional donuts, was just as delicious and wonderful as the crazy concoctions they're famous for.

Regardless, we wanted the focus to be the views.\\n\\nLocated on the 52nd floor of the Prudential building.  \\n\\nA few of tips to consider:\\n:Make a reservation to alleviate wait time and greater chances of being seated against the windows.\\nThere is a wait for the elevators, ushers manage the traffic.\\nThere seems to be a questionable process for the elevators marked for the rearurant.  There were several but they only allowed the use of one of them. \\nThey have one hostess station functioning with chaos.\\nThere is no seating in the waiting areas.\\nPreferred attire for lunch is business casual but they will not turn you away.  They will ask to remove hats.  The website states causal attire will lead to seating in the lounge but this was not the case.  \\n\\nWe had reservations for their opening time.  Staff was not prepared to seat anyone at the empty readied tables.  We were almost seated by one of the bus boys but he could not find our table.  He asked another host for directions and the host took over.\\n\\nThankfully we were granted a spacious table against the window with sprawling views of Boston.  You can't have better views anywhere else.\\n\\nOur lunch consisted of the Jumbo Lump Crab Cake Sandwich and the 3 course Prix-Fixe menu consisting of:  Chilled Potato and Leek Soup, Chipotle Glazed Short Ribs, and Peach Upside Down Cake. \\n\\nThe crab molded into a big thick patty, lightly seasoned.  Simply constructed with lettuce, tomato and even spread of remoulade on a soft toasty bun.  The crab sweet and chunky without filling.\\n\\nThe soup cool and smooth as the pesto oil drizzle adds a hint of garlic.  Pieces of ice were still swimming to chill the soup, not impacting the richness in flavor.\\n\\nShort rib was melt in your mouth tender but lacked salt as if forgotten altogether.  The sauce is reminiscent of a much tangier less sweet thinned version of barbecue, not chipotle as the menu indicates.  The bed of mash potatoes still had chunks avoiding a texture of mush as it laid firm on the plate and a worthy base for the beef.\\n\\nYou can smell the healthy mint leaf that adorned the cake before it hit the table.  Every fork cut into the cake pulled a piece of peach making a perfect bite.  Topped with a gracious dollop hand whipped cream and a fortunate over-drizzling of passion fruit sauce.\\n\\nOur server Karl provided understated service we can appreciate.

However, the restaurant charged me $4 over $20, which is my expected amount since I ordered combo set, which cost around $16.5, and the amount should be around $17-$18 after added the TAX.

Love the decor, it's cool without trying too hard, very Austin-ish. The staff is very accommodating from the host when you walk in the door, to our waitperson. The cocktail list was fabulous, I would go there just for drinks before going out. But on to the food. We had fried oysters, the plancha burger, cheesy cauliflower, sticky Brussels sprouts, hanger steak and frites, plus we tried their potato chips with pimento dipping sauce, yummmmm, and for dessert, the most sublime birthday cake ice cream sandwiches. Everything was outstandingly delicious, not a single dud in the mix. I could go into more detail on each dish, but I'll just say we try all the best that Austin has to offer seven nights a week, and this is our favorite by far, every item has been fabulous. I'm so happy to see them in the east/downtown area - Welcome Launderette, you had us from Hello!"},{"name":"Folk Art Restaurant","address":"465 N Highland Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"This is yet another awesome ATL eatery!

I went here for lunch and was super excited that I got introduced to this place. The sandwiches were amazing. I got to try different ones because everyone ordered a different kind and we ended up just trading a piece. It is very adorable and the food was extra yummy! I got the salmon sandwich and it was very fresh and tasty! I never ever go to the east side of 35 but it was totally worth it!"},{"name":"Lenoir","address":"1807 S 1st St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I held off writing this review for a few weeks, thinking I'd change my mind and suddenly feel more positive about Lenoir than I actually do. I rarely write reviews that fall below 5 or 4 stars but I couldn't shake the feeling I'd wasted my time. The best place I can compare Lenoir to is Fabi + Rossi which has a similar menu and ambiance but is cheaper and just as nice. Go to Lenoir if you're into paying Uchiko prices for 1/2 the quantity of food.\\n\\nThere are oodles of places to eat in Austin, if you're giving me a bill for $100 per person I should walk away not thinking about the bill. (2 people, 2 entrees, 2 glasses of wine each, 1 dessert). I dine out enough to afford it so I wasn't concerned about the $ coming here.\\n\\nPros: \\nThe ambiance- They really have the decor down here. Lenoir is beautiful, if you're going on a date and want somewhere for the wow factor- this is the place. The lighting is beautiful and not too dim but flattering. The interiors are whimsical and very old world, whoever beautified this place did so impressively.\\n\\nCons:\\nPortion size, I'm not a big girl but after dinner I went home hungry. You pick 3 courses from their pre-fixe menu from the land, sea and dream options. The plates are rather tiny. \\n\\nNeutral:\\nThe food here isn't knocking my socks off, that being said its not bad by any means. I just expected 1. more food and 2. something a bit different from the norm for the price. The food I ate was tasty but I feel like I've ordered from the same menu numerous times. My tip to Lenoir- if you're going to make your customers pay a ton for dinner at least give them enough food.\\n\\nService was good. Not overly friendly but very professional."},{"name":"Alfredo's Italian Kitchen","address":"425 Lynnway","city":"Lynn","stars":"3","text":"We order from this place regularly.  Not a lot of places deliver to the Point of Pines, so I was happy to see that they do.  The delivery is super fast.  They give you huge portions of food.  You most def. could split the pasta dishes or make at last 3 meals out of them.  The baked ziti is to die for and the bread triangles are out of this world!  The chicken cutlets are huge and unbelievably delicious.  My only complaint is that they don't fill their calzones enough. They do not lack it taste whatsoever since the bread is amazing, but when you cut into them it really is mostly bread.  Oh, and I really wish they would add linguine with clam sauce on their menu!  It's so hard to find that anywhere.  However, with that being sad, they are pretty fabulous and we will continue to order from them (nearly every weekend)!"},{"name":"Bouldin Creek Cafe","address":"1900 S 1st St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I liked the environment of the restaurant and level of laid back everyone was.

The weather this past weekend was absolutely gorgeous, and my boyfriend and I enjoyed lunch out on their porch area. The little \\"garden\\" out front takes away the cramped, alleyway feeling and was much appreciated. Our waiter was attentive, friendly, quick -- all things that I expect from great service.\\n\\nThe food was good but not great. I ordered chicken masamun curry while the boyfriend went for chicken pad thai. When I think Thai food, I'm expecting bold and exciting flavors, and the dishes came off bland, as if they held back purposely. On a previous visit a few years ago, I ate their pad thai in a puddle of tears because my mouth was on FIRE, so I was surprised to get little to no heat this go around. Maybe the cook at the time was playing horrible trick on me? Who knows. Either way, Thai Noodle House is no better and no worse than several of the Thai restaurants nearby. The prices are reasonable, and it's worth gambling on getting a good waiter."},{"name":"The Backspace","address":"507 San Jacinto St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Loved the quaint, romantic atmosphere.

Oh, and let me mention that I am NOT a vegetarian nor is my husband.  He got that fake out BLT and has been asking ever since to go back for another.  It is like the thickest, most delicious bacon you have ever tasted...except it's not bacon!  Crazy geniuses came up with this tofu bacon and I applaud them.  \\n\\nThe ambiance here is very chill and laid back.  People come just for a meal, others seem to linger on their computers all day.

Then when I cruising around looking for a bathroom and noticed there's a downstairs/basement portion, I was pretty surprised.
