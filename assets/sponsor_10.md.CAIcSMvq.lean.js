I won't review the cocktails I had but thought they were both decent; I will, however focus on the food I sampled below:\\n\\nHot and sour soup:\\nI thought their version of hot & sour was quite good, with a nice strong vinegar and white-pepper flavor that fans of this dish will appreciate.  Bamboo shoots were also julienned small which I prefer since the large wide cut usually induces a stringy, fibrous texture.  More tofu would have been nice as the portions were also cut quite small.  8/10\\n\\nSeafood dumplings (pan fried):\\nDelicately prepared and assembled, these may have been among the best dumplings/pot stickers I've had at any restaurant.  Per tradition, the dumplings were seared only on one side, leaving the back side to provide a wonderfully soft textural contrast.  The filling itself was simply and restrained (just diced shrimp) but paired wonderfully with the vinegar-based sauce provided.  Genuinely delicious.  10/10\\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tasting-east-portland?select=UyGd0nx2EqotzdUTRADdaQ#UyGd0nx2EqotzdUTRADdaQ\\n\\nSoy glazed Black Cod:\\nA special on the menu the night I was there, the soy glazed Black Cod met all of my expectations except for the portion size, although priced at $13, I suppose that was by design.  The fish was wonderfully oily (as only black cod and chilean bass can be) and succulent.  The crispy skin promised on the menu didn't fully materialize in this preparation but I didn't mind given the wonderful flavors that were created here.  A side of oyster mushroom-soy fried rice was included specifically with this dish and it paired beautifully with the fish.  Wonderful dish. 9/10\\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tasting-east-portland?select=txTCsEW95rDgawm3YcVCYw#txTCsEW95rDgawm3YcVCYw\\n\\nAll-in-all, I will surely be back on future trips to the area, and am glad that my usual hotel (The Paramount) has such a wonderful fixture attached to it.

It is very close to an authentic NY style deli in look and feel, although the food is not. It's loud, it's crowded, and the menu is fun because of the number of items that are on there. \\n\\nFirst they have a very deep menu. There are a large number of items to choose from including the standard breakfasts such as omelets, french toast, and corned beef hash. For lunch they have burgers, hot dogs, sandwiches, etc. However you can also get blintzes, egg cream sodas, knish, matzo ball soup, and much more which are typical of the deli's on the east coast where I grew up. Additionally they have a full service bakery where you can purchase their bagels and have various items made to order for you as long as you are willing to wait a day or two for it. \\n\\nOn my visit, I had the matzo ball soup, knish, and a roast beef sandwich, with an egg cream soda. The eggcream was actually the first one I had drunk in many years, and it was phenomenal. It is not a typical egg cream made with Fox's U Bet, and instead it was made with Hershey's. However I must say that the Hershey's version tasted much better. It was fantastic. Second, I had the authentic matzoball chicken soup. The matzoball was perfect, not too firm, not too soft. It was excellent. The potato knish was also good, and complemented the matzo ball soup well. Finally, I had a roast beef sandwich. The roast beef was flavorful and delicious, and there were just enough toppings on it to make the whole thing stand on its own. \\n\\nAll in all, it is a place that doesn't exactly remind me of home, but it is close enough to be an enjoyable experience.

On my first visit the bf and I were trying to grab a bite before taking in a flick at Starlight, but it was nearly impossible to actually find our server after we ordered our drinks and food (which took a good 8-10 mins to find their way to our table). When I finally spotted him he was walking across the street to the parking lot behind the buildings across the street with a friend, presumably for a smoke break. He came back 6 minutes later, stopped to talk to some people at a table outside, played with their dog, then made his way back to the table. By that time the food we ordered had come (we sent it to be wrapped for take out) and we were patiently waiting to pay our check. Strike one. \\n\\nThis past Saturday the bf and I decided to give the place another try (I really wanted to like this place, ya'll). The harried server tossed some menus at us, muttered something about three tables being sat at the same time and went off to deal with them, without getting our drink order. He made his way back and we ordered a pitcher of Texas 'ritas, which were bitter and tasted like regular house 'ritas. He messed up the salt/no salt rims (no big whoop) and took our food order. (A Tommy Taco, fish taco, shrimp taco for me and a traditional beef taco, pork jerk taco, and a shrimp taco combo for him). \\n\\nHere's where the place earns it's one star. I didn't receive my fish taco but instead got some sort of under seasoned chicken (I think)  taco. The shrimp taco was ok but the Tommy taco was HORRIBLY over-seasoned and resembled a forest with the quantity of cilantro that was on top of it. I ate a few bites of it.  My bf's jerk taco tasted like canned baked beans with a ton of cinnamon dumped on for good measure. He didn't finish it. The server never asked if our meal was going well or if he could top off our waters. The kicker was when we were paying our check. We decided to split the check, my bf paying cash and myself paying by debit card. He brought the slip for me to sign and stated \\"The cash he left didn't cover half and it doesn't cover my tip.\\" and walked away. What the wha?

The restaurant has cool mood lighting, videos and good music playing so you get the feel of being in a club without having to really be in one. This is about all we were impressed with. I will not be recommending this restaurant to anyone.\\n\\nGood: Atmosphere and music.\\n\\nBetter: The food was ok, flat bread pizza and salads and friend calamari. The same thing they have everywhere.  The cocktails were ok as well. I tend not to like sweet syrupy cocktails so their selection was just not my taste. Give me a Sazarac any day. There was nothing that wowed us. It's really more the atmosphere than anything else that makes the restaurant interesting. The IPads are a cool concept but if you don't have any Apple products they are bit confusing for the novice.\\n\\nBad: Customer service is abysmal. We were told as soon as we arrived that the beautiful birthday cake that a friend home baked special for us as a present was not allowed to be brought into the restaurant and eaten because they could get sued if we got sick from it (blank stare).That is a completely unfunded statement. I eat out often and have had or attended many a birthday celebration at five star dining restaurants down to your local sports bar and never once have we been told we could not bring a cake. They may charge a cutting fee, which is fine, but no cake....really?! We were then unable to do the whole blow out the candles and sing happy birthday which completely ruined the festive mood, and I am now stuck with an entire cake that will feed twenty five people sitting on my counter to go bad.\\n\\nOur guests were then told they could not bring in a number of their presents for us. A few people purchased bottles of wine and or champagne, brought then unopened and gift wrapped and were told they had to leave them in the car. Once again- where do they come up with these policies? I can understand you not wanting the bottles of alcohol opened and consumed in your establishment, but if you're concerned with missing out on making money off the bottle if they are consumed, charge a corking fee. But to not be able to bring them in, gift wrapped with a card attached, forces people to have to wait outside to have them pulled out of people trunks and handed off as an afterthought. It's just plain tacky.\\n\\nFinally, when we were winding down from our dinner we realized that we were being rushed out of out booths to make room for the next tables. They took away our IPad before we could even use the valet car retrieval feature. They started moving things around and fluffing up the pillows and asking if we were done, while we were still drinking. We finally felt s unwelcome that we got up and stood at the bar t finish our drinks.\\n\\nEvery time we would try t talk to management about it we were given short answers and told \\"that's just how it is, I can't do anything for you.\\" I work in the service industry and I know what it means to go above and beyond to make sure your guests feel appreciated and special every time they spend money with you. A successful business is more about the service than it is the product. Don't get me wrong, the product has to be consistent and at least good, but if your service is outstanding and the product is just ok (which their product is) people will come back because they feel like you actually want and value them as a client.

So of course we had to order from both menus.  And just across the hall is the Tap house from which you can enjoy drinks.  In fact, bring your drinks over or take your food to the tap house, but this is a pretty cool setup; reminds me a bit of a food truck court but indoors and there's no truck. There are, however, nice big windows that open to the street for fresh air when the weather is nice (like it has been lately).  \\n\\nI am third generation Norwegian and my mom is a horrible cook, so my experience with lefse has been... interesting. So I tried Ingrid's Norwegian meatball wrap which was a meatball in a lefse wrap with sour cabbage (Surk√•l), Aquavit (a Scandinavian anise type distilled spirit - this one is actually made locally but according to very authentic methods I was told), and then some lefse with cinnamon sugar (how my mom always had it as a kid and tried to make it for me).  First of all, the Aquavit was a subtly flavored spirit that I enjoyed, but I would still prefer beer (note: they offered two versions here, one that was dark in color and aged, the other was lighter in color. I tried the darker as I was told the anise flavor is lighter in it). The meatball wrap, however, was delicious! I loved the texture play between the delicately soft lefse and crunchy sour cabbage and savory meatballs. I must mention here that I don't typically ever eat mixed meats like meatballs, so this was a risk for me, but it worked! And the cinnamon sugar lefse was equally delicious with that delicate soft potato dough that just seemingly melted in your mouth.  This was way better than my mom's lefse and now I never want to eat a typical Mexican style tortilla wrap ever again! Ever. I can't wait to go back. Price is great, environment is super casual, but light and bright (cheerful!) and great for a lunch date or happy hour or even just grabbing something to go. \\n\\nAs far as Soban goes, hey that was super tasty too!

In fact it was surprising that there was so much fresh food there, since they closed soon after we got our orders.\\n- The quantity was amazing, probably because they had so much food to dish out prior to closing.\\n- Good value out of the sampler of falafel, baba ghanouj, hummus, tabouleh salad, and pita bread, which was cheap, plenteous, and generally pretty good, except for the pita bread.\\n\\nThe negatives:\\n- There was a really pushy Asian lady hanging around in front of the counter, don't know if she was a customer or the proprietor or a street person, but she was telling us what to order, what was good, etc, in a really annoying manner as we were trying to decide for ourselves what we wanted to order.\\n- The salad bar choices looked great, but it was all behind the glass, so if you order salad, you need to point to all the things you want, rather than building your own.\\n- Too much styrofoam.\\n- The aforementioned greasy pita, which was also overly piping hot when taken out of its foil.\\n\\nWith other choices in the food court, and other favorite Middle Eastern places, I doubt I'll return."},{"name":"St. Honor√© Boulangerie","address":"2335 NW Thurman St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"The Pain au Raisin pastry is delectable and the Apple Normandy is like a little square of brioche pudding happiness.

It is $12 for this plate of fried food.   You can get the same thing for $8, but it isn't \\"free range\\".

If fried bread is served, you usually get just one small piece, because it is super rich.  It is not a substitute for toast.  At Full English, they give you 3 big pieces of greasy fried bread instead of toast.  Tasty, but kind of disgusting.  What I like about traditional English breakfast is real toast, (not fried) in a little toast holder, with some good butter and wonderful English marmalade or lemon curd, hopefully, home made.  Then, I would get soft boiled eggs, served in egg cups.  Oh, and fruit.  Yes, fruit.  See, you can have a traditional English breakfast and NOT have it slathered in grease.

I've watched and admired her on TV for many years and was so excited to try her restaurant in Orlando with my co-worker (another foodie) while on a business trip.  First, we had a reservation for 8:15pm that I had made a week earlier, but didn't get seated until almost 9pm!  Then our waitress took forever to come take our order or even offer us water!  The complimentary bread was pretty good, as was the room-temp butter to go with it.  To start, we had the sampler platter with hummus, tzaziki, dolmas, and shrimp and lamb meatball skewers.  The hummus and tzaziki were average at best (certainly not what you'd expect of an iron chef who specializes in Mediterranean cuisine, I've had way better in many places), the dolmas ok, and the skewers, well, they were just skewers.  I had the flank steak and my co-worker had the fisherman stew for entree - both were just average.  We ordered the brussels sprouts as a side dish, and they were the single best thing on the table that night.  The suggested wine pairings were very good, too.  Overall, this is a casual restaurant that is loud, with mediocre service, average food at best, and kind of gave me a Friday's/Chili's vibe.

The atmosphere is very hipster which is super cute. There is a lake in the back which is very relaxing and nice to have on a hot day while enjoying your cold cup of shaved ice.

The place is not to loud, but not awkwardly quiet either, so it's a nice balance between the 2. We were seated at our table which was by the door, but the wall that was up made it a nice cozy spot. Our waitress was great, very friendly and responsive, though one critique I would give her is to consistently change out the plates the tapas are being eaten on. \\n\\nNow on to the food, we had a few tapas and dessert which were okay, but for the price you cant complain too much. The following is what we ate;\\n\\nGambas Al Ajillo - While this is one of my favorite things at most restaurants, and it was good here, I would offer some constructive criticism of this dish. It needed paprika or some sort of season on the fish itself, the oil was a bit overwhelming, it desperately needed salt, some sort of fresh her like cilantro and maybe some lime to bring some freshness to the plate.\\n\\nCroquetas De Bacalao- They were awesome for the most part, just a little dry on the inside, which is expected when you do a fritter with dried cod. I would have created a sauce to go along with the dish, just to bring some moisture, other than that flavor was great, perfectly fried and seasoned.\\n\\nCostillas De Ternera- Was our least favorite thing we ate, the sauce was very bland and under seasoned, the horseradish sauce on the top made the sauce just taste like cocktail sauce which doesn't really go well with short ribs. You definitely need to rethink the way this dish is prepared and served. (i.e. maybe add some chorizo and garlic and loose the horseradish sauce on the top)\\n\\n(special item) Duck empanada - These were perfect, the only thing that threw me off was the dough used for the empanada. \\n\\nBread Pudding- this was probably my favorite thing of the night, it was light enough that it didn't drop like a rock when you ate it and heavy enough that it had substance, the caramel sauce def made the dish, the only thing I wish I had more of was the amount of whipped cream served with this item\\n\\nCrema Catalana - The Cr√®me br√ªl√©e was awesome, nice hard shell on the top, nice cold cream underneath. well flavored.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I will definitely be back here, we still need to try the Paellas and a few other things, but I would recommend."},{"name":"Jim & Patty's Coffee","address":"4130 SW 117th Ave","city":"Beaverton","stars":"4.5","text":"FYI - this place *just* expanded (July 2016), so if you came here in the past and had a hard time finding seating (especially in the weekends), it's probably better now. \\n\\nI love their London Fog (earl grey tea vanilla latte), which I order with almond milk and half the sweetener.

My sister was excited to celebrate her birthday with family and friends and unfortunately they did not meet our expectations. We spent the majority of our time searching for the server to take our orders, bring food, napkins, refill drinks and even bring the checks. She would disappear literally 15-30 minutes at a time. We had to seek a manager on four separate occasions to help. I would occasionally see her assisting another large party seated adjacent from mine for which she appeared to be far more attentive to. Mind you we had been here almost an hour before this party was seated/served and they managed to receive food, drinks and their check before us. \\n\\nAfter I witnessed the manager speak with the server the first time, she continued the same behavior and had the audacity to appear annoyed with us. I hate the idea of being that customer who constantly complains but seriously. For example, instead of bringing pitchers to refill the drinks for a party of eight she rushed to the table after the conversation with her manager and simultaneously asked who needed refills all while picking up all our cups and rushing off. What's the problem? Well three guests had the same drink. How do you differentiate whose cup belongs to who? So I had to request new drinks for them.\\n\\nWe had to seek the manager a second time regarding one of our appetizers and than a third time for our entrees because it had been over  40 minutes (yes I timed  it) since we'd seen our server AGAIN! Afterwards, she never stopped by to check on us or even update us on the status of our entrees. She finally arrived with this barely warm food that I can imagine sat for quite a while waiting to be brought to our table. At this point, we're over this dining experience. \\n\\nThe manager apologized and extended us -25% off our checks. I really appreciated this offer. However, I would've appreciated another server more. The server dropped off our checks but never returned to pickup our payments. Shaking my head, we had to get the manager again to settle our checks so we can finally exit this mood killer of a restaurant. \\n\\nLong story short, I gave two stars because the server gave bad service with a smile, the manager was kind and helpful but probably should've stepped up to either replace the server or takeover himself after complaints #2-3. Although her birthday has passed now, I will definitely take my kid sister for a do over somewhere else soon to ease the memory of this underwhelming moment I can never take back. \\n\\nDefinitely have a drink and enjoy watching the games.

Piping hot fresh cut fries!! Mmm!! \\n\\nPrices: Best prices in town probably for the great quality of food you get, most items all under $10.

For value this place is amazing especially now that the new owner has implemented $10 dinner specials nightly. You simply cannot get fed this well at any other place in this city. The only special I caution against is the vindaloo special. Also the special of the night will come with slightly different sides than the same dish off the standard menu, with the exception of Monday night's pizzas which for $10 is incredible.\\nOtherwise you will NEVER regret ordering the roast lamb... as it is the signature dish and the stock and trade of this fine neighbourhood establishment and its founding family, who have since sold to the new (still Greek) owner. Their lamb recipe is literally a trade secret and you only need to try a bite of your friend's to know why.\\nAs for consistency the size of the lamb portion can vary from immense to modest. The quality of most dishes (with the exception of the nachos and the vindaloo specials) is excellent but also consistent. Not many restaurants can hit it this consistently.\\nI also really like the casual but strangely good-for-any-occasion ambience. There is no annoying hackneyed Greek stereotypes or blindingly blue and white murals. The place is as good for a drink at the large front bar as it is for a family dinner with grandparents or a date. There is live music some nights but if not in the mood the back room provides some quiet for eating and conversation. Also I have booked many a birthday group here so it is great for that sort of thing too.\\nLastly I tip my hat to the service staff who, I can say from almost ten years or so of witness experience, are some of the most down to earth and truly helpful sorts I have ever had. These aren't make up dolls starved for personality like many other places, but genuine people who make you feel like you are really in a good community restaurant.\\nSome people recommend the brunch here although it is really mostly a good value dinner joint."},{"name":"St. Honor√© Boulangerie","address":"2335 NW Thurman St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Really, what's not to love about St. Honore.

Boujhetto's opened up 5 months ago and has been thriving ever since. Their hours are Thursday to Sunday 12pm-7pm. It is a very clean restaurant and has a bathroom. There are 9 or so tables out front.\\n\\nThere is always a selection of 6 to 8 different types of meat per day and they vary from beef brisket to fried chicken n' waffles to sausages. On top of the main dishes, there is a variety of 6-8 different side dishes ranging from collard greens to candied yams to mashed potatoes. When you order you have the choice on one main dish and 2 sides as well as a drink and the desert. Random fact is that even though it my not be on the menu they always serve chicken n' waffles and when they are in stock, they have koolaid pickles (pickles that are soaked in koolaid for 2 weeks and they soak up the flavor making them kind of sweet). The koolaid pickles sell quick.\\n\\nWhen I went I got the beef brisket with the homemade mac n' cheese, mashed potatoes and peach cobbler. The brisket melted when I bit into it. It was so juicy and tender. The mac n' cheese probably had a mixture of 4 different cheeses that made it have a nice crust as well as an amazing taste. The mashed potatoes had small chunks of potato making a nice mixture of mashed and chunk. The gravy on top of the mashed potatoes had an amazing flavor and wasn't' too running it had a nice viscosity to it. Do not even get me started on the peach cobbler, I think you can imagine in your mind a perfect crunch and flavor its not hard to drift away when eating this well portioned dessert. Eat it while it is hot the flavor comes out more.\\n\\nBoujhetto's has a variety of different HOMEMADE sauces their special sauce is Bougie sauce which is a BBQ that has a great tang to it. They also have 3 other types of BBQ sauces and they have a great hot sauce. \\n\\nThe meal which is one main course, two sides and a drink is $9 or $10. You should know that by eating here you are helping support a worth cause called Rahab's Hideaway and a woman who has dedicated her life to help others get over different difficulties in their life.

Overall, the atmosphere is nice and definitely has a coffee shop vibe with   people sitting with their laptops and drinks typing/working away.\\n\\nHowever, I am giving this place a sub-par review due to their draconian alcohol policy which completely turned me off to the experience of being in the Newsfeed Cafe. Here's what happened:\\n\\nI went up to the counter to order a round of drinks for me and my friends.  I attempted to order 2 alcoholic drinks (one cocktail and one can of beer) along with a bottle of water. The person behind the counter informed me that I had to show her 2 ID's since I was ordering 2 drinks. So I had to go back to where I was sitting with my friends to ask them to give me one of their IDs. Slight inconvenience but there was nobody behind me in line so not a huge deal.\\n\\nSo I come back with my friend's ID to show along with my ID. After the person behind the counter verifies both ID's, she informs me that since I am buying multiple drinks, that I HAVE to buy a food item....um what? That seems mildly absurd that I am forced to buy a food item when I'm not even hungry and nothing that is on the menu looks appetizing to me at the moment but fine, I order what looks to be some type of blueberry coffee cake bar (which was $4-$5 so not exactly a cheap bakery item...also to add insult to injury, the blueberry coffee cake bar was ice cold like it had just been taken out of the freezer so it was hardly edible at all). \\n\\nI go to pay and 2 drinks and the water along with the food is now running me nearly $30. Here is where the final straw for me occurs. Since I ordered a can of beer, they proceeded to pour what they could into a small-sized glass and handed it to me. When I asked them where the rest of it was, they told me that they couldn't give me the rest of the contents of the can and that when I was done what they poured me, I'd have to come back to the counter and they'd pour the rest into my glass...so basically they have some completely asinine policy of not allowing patrons to be able to hold onto their own containers of alcohol that they've bought. Utterly ridiculous!\\n\\nMy take on all this is if you're going to serve alcohol, then serve it and don't put up all these stupid restrictions in place. Otherwise, don't even bother serving. I can't imagine a library cafe being the setting for such unruly behavior that these measures need to be put into place."},{"name":"Maekha Thai","address":"163 Squire Rd","city":"Revere","stars":"4","text":"I ordered through the yelp app and the restaurant delivered the meal with the wrong meat.

With our shelf exams coming up, I knew I could go there and find a perfect balance of cozy cafe feels and an atmosphere full of life - as opposed to the silent fortresses that are campus libraries. While the latter has been an important part of my academic career thus far, starting third year of med school has made me realize I crave any opportunity to be out and about, and Stauf's does a great job of satisfying this thirst.\\n\\nFirst off, I love that there is parking in the back! And, in stark contrast to most of Columbus, you can be sure to find a spot 95% of the time. During the quick walk to the cafe from the parking lot, you can notice tables conveniently placed outside for those who wish to paint, catch up with friends, or simply take in Grandview's beauty.\\n\\nAfter entering, I grabbed a table for two and placed an order for \\"The Wrap,\\" which was brought out to me within 5-10 mins. The spinach, bell peppers, and red-skinned potatoes complimented the egg so perfectly, and I was impressed with the freshness of each bite. Plus, they had cute little Tabasco bottles you could grab, which added a nice subtle spicy taste to the mix. I did not get coffee this time, but I have in the past and can say the high standard carries over to that as well.\\n\\nOf course, I appreciate their free wifi, but I, along with other friends, have noted it can sometimes take 15-20 mins to connect when you first get there. Just a heads up. The art on the walls changes every time I go there and adds a vibrant touch to the cafe, presenting a superb opportunity to take breaks from staring at my laptop screen and marvel at the talent of local artists. As an artist myself, this is definitely one of my favorite parts of frequenting this coffee shop. A very unique touch.\\n\\nSo, whether you're looking to treat those out-of-town friends to some delicious brunch, hoping to relax and turn a few pages of your new book, or simply enjoy sipping on some good coffee, Stauf's is sure to have something for everyone."},{"name":"Rogue Eastside Pub & Pilot Brewery","address":"928 SE 9th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"If you want a great beer selection, this is the place to go, five stars.

It would not be so noticeable if the place was not so small and he did not float around drunk trying to talk to customers.The 3rd time he actually grabbed my arm very harshly to show us where we should sit. I brought this to his attention and he proceeded to apologize and blab about playing football and being a very physical person (?) and buy me a drink...which he then spilled on the table in front of me in his drunken stupor.

The two meat ones were no frills.  Just good amounts of meat, a tad of some green topping (inconsequential), wrapped in 2 corn tortillas and aluminum foil.  They were tasty and cheap goodness.  The chile relleno tacos were nice, but lacked some expected flavor, and just not as exciting as flesh to me.\\n\\nThe plate took some time to come out, but was worth the wait.

Yes, please!\\n\\nOn a nice summer day, ordering a bowl of cold ramen for lunch seemed like the perfect choice. \\n\\nThe waitress asked if I've ordered it before, and they ask this for good reason. This dish comes with a softly poached egg, which you break and mix in with the noodles and the sauce/soup. If you're not a fan of runny eggs, you can opt for a hard boiled egg. When you're about 2/3 way done, you can ask for soup to mix in another layer of flavour.\\n\\nThe serving was quite large, as I couldn't finish the entire bowl. Mind you though, I did split an order of gyoza with a friend. I think it was the additional soup that sealed the deal for me. The dish wasn't screaming with MSG, so I liked it. But for some who are used to saltier broths, it may taste like it lacks a bit of flavour.\\n\\nI've also tried the Dark Miso Ramen before, and boy, did it play with my head. The charcoal from that dish turns the broth pretty much black, so anyone would think twice before slurping on any black liquid. It doesn't alter the taste though, and they say it's healthy for you. So bottoms up!\\n\\nI definitely like this place more than I like Kintaro. I find the soup here not as oily. It's a few doors further down from Robson, but the environment feels more calm, and the little fresh flowers they place on your dining tray adds a nice touch.\\n\\nLike most ramen joints, it's small, so you do have to come early before any lunch or dinner time rushes.

Maybe bbq is already gourmet enough; to do it right requires expertise and great amounts of time and heart/TLC. So, when a TV-show chef tackles bbq, I guess you get Sweet Cheeks, a mixture of misses. Rather than falling short of good bbq, each dish seems to take a wrong turn somewhere. The ribs are rather mediocre; obviously smoked but doesn't have that deeply moist, almost internally carmelized tenderness of good 'cue. The brisket is tender, but seems to be the most fatty cut of brisket possible; plus it's very salty. The pulled pork is simply dry. The pork belly is the best among the bunch, partly because it's not common (I've never had it 'cued this way before) and therefore has no comparison. Still, there's a strange saltiness to it...it must have been brined and the brine is overwhelming. Many side dishes are also strange-tasting (ie. \\"gourmet\\"). The collard greens are way too sour, even though the nice fresh leafy greens cry out for a better treatment. The baked beans are too mushy and non-descript. The black eye peas are also too mushy and bland. The broccoli in cheese is OK, most because they drown the whole thing mercilessly in max-fat creamy cheesiness. Can't go wrong with that. The mac and cheese is surprisingly standard, as if they couldn't think of how to mess with it. The cole slaw is another gourmet attempt to be different but not better; huge chunks of purple cabbage with very light, slightly sour (that's the theme here!) dressing. OK, best and worst: the two best things they have are the \\"farm salad\\" which is something original and doesn't really have much to do with bbq; a mix of greens, beans and some grilled veggies in a light dressing. It's a winner and shows what Faison can do when she's original. Second best is a monstrous peanut butter cookie dessert comprised of two of the largest cookies you've ever seen with a peanut butter cream layer in between. This would be a home-run if it weren't so salty. I confess that others thought it wasn't too salty, so ymmv. The worst? It was hard to choose, but I would say the bbq SAUCE itself. Both the spicy-gloppy one and the watery vinegary one are grade C at best. Considering how critical the sauce is (the sauce is the boss) for 'cue, I have to give Sweek Cheeks a low grade overall. Conclusion: the menu overall is sour, salty and strange...a far cry from SWEET cheeks."},{"name":"Cactus Club Cafe","address":"1085 Canada Place","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"This is a chain restaurant that is basically a Canadian version of a cheesecake factory food-wise; they serve burgers, basic meat options (steak, salmon, chicken, etc.), and have a big alcohol menu. The real reason to stop here is for the amazing view of Stanley park and part of the walkway.\\n\\nI came on a sunny weekend afternoon and requested a table with a view and was told it would take 30 minutes. Getting a table was a bit confusing because my phone kept getting a text saying it was ready, but then I was informed multiple times it was not until the third notification. The service staff was also a bunch of high school girls wearing blue, which made it harder to tell who was supposed to help me. Anyways, we got a view of Stanley Park, and then around 5 they lowered the shades, covering over 50%. But it was still nice to dine with a breeze and partly outdoors. I ordered a maple salmon and it was cooked well, moist and not too heavily seasoned. The side component was lacking, but at least the \\"star of the dish\\" was cooked well. I also tried a piece of barbequed chicken and it was very moist and flavorful.

To my surprise, the steak was flavorless and extremely hard to cut into and hurt my jaw when I chewed. I had it taken back and asked for another one to be made, and it was just as bad if not edible for anyone to eat. The fries were also really stale.

I would have preferred the appetizer to come first but not a big deal.\\n\\nScallops with Garlic Butter ($11.95-3/5): You get four pieces of jumbo scallops on a sizzling cast iron pan. It would work out to $3 a piece. The scallops were cooked perfectly but it was tasteless on its own. Like you'd really have to scoop a spoonful of sauce to accompany it. The garlic butter sauce was yum! The price is a bit steep for such a small plate but I guess this what you'd normally pay for scallops. \\n\\nMiso Beef hot stone bowl ($12.95-3/5): Huge portion! Comes with a side of edamame, sesame bean sprouts and pickled radish. The hot stone bowl had slices of beef, onion and rice. It has a strong miso fragrance but in my opinion it didn't have much taste and required more sauce. The miso soup was very tasty, perhaps the best I've had. \\n\\nHot stone pot with beef, sweet corn and cheese ($12.95-4/5): Also Huge portion! There was a generous amount of cheese, some sweet corn and minced beef. I believe they've also topped it with some shredded carrots (?). This bowl had more flavor but I added the remaining garlic butter to my bowl and it tasted awesome! I like it spicy so I sprinkled some Japanese pepper from time to time. Due to the cheese in this bowl, it does crisp up, so mix it frequently if you don't like your rice hard. This didn't happen with the miso beef. Also comes with sides and soup. \\n\\nHonestly, if you want something warm and filling, get their hot stone bowls! One bowl was too much for either of us and could have easily shared one. But...I wouldn't want to share my soup, though. If you do get the bowls, I'd suggest getting the one with cheese as the miso beef wasn't anything special.

Fortunately for me, I lived in the land of (pork) milk and honey for ten years - the American south. While there, I personally ate enough BBQ to embarrass a family of four, sometimes enough that I began to think porcine thoughts and have porcine dreams.\\n\\nSpeaking of porcine dreams, Sweet Cheeks has a pretty good thing going. We made an early reservation for 6:00 on Saturday because we were trying to make it to a show, but showed up about twenty minutes late. They sat us after a very brief wait and we exchanged a foodlust glance that said \\"oh my god we're going to eat smoked pork.\\"\\n\\n(We also had fried okra. Each piece was sliced in half and lightly battered, a technique that I guess reduces the amount of okra goo you have to contend with. I don't mind okra goo, so I'm ok with the traditional disks with the heavy breading, but I did very much enjoy this version, which was really a nice variation on the usual way of doing this dish).\\n\\nYou have to respect smoked pork. Not just anyone can appreciate the carnal beauty of a crusty salty smoky hunk of rib, so before you go choose your company wisely. Imagine how bad it would be if the server set down a tray of pork belly, brisket with a thick vein of fat in it, fall-off-the-bone tender ribs, roughly chopped coleslaw, and creamy sharp mac and cheese, and you grabbed one of the ribs and shoved the thing in your face, fat and sauce dripping down your chin, only to look across the table to see your companion digging in with a knife and fork.\\n\\nNo, I don't think so. So go with someone good, split a $25 tray of meat and sides and onions (yeah, I ate them raw) and homemade pickles, and when it comes out on a metal tray, just dig in with your hands.\\n\\nI mean, come on. Isn't the existence of BBQ proof that you only live once?"},{"name":"Market Street Cafe","address":"701 Front St","city":"Celebration","stars":"3","text":"this place was good!

Ordering a cha siu ramen with yatai broth and a tasty egg, the woman told me it would be five minutes to be ready so I walked to my car and drove there.\\n\\nWhen I got there, the woman was really apologetic but said that I would have to wait. I was fine with that, but I was nonplussed when I saw other people who ordered just as I got into the door get their food before I got mine. In total, I waited about 15 minutes in the store - added to the 5 minutes getting there and I was delayed a good deal. Not the server's fault since she was telling the staff in the kitchen to get it ready ASAP but the staff were really lackadaisical in preparing my to-go order.\\n\\nThe ramen itself is always good - the noodles are firm and tender, with a nice characteristic creaminess that matches well with the soup. The yatai soup is a lighter, clearer broth with more of a clear onion and bamboo input (though it also has the standard pork bone thick flavour) and accents the ramen. The taste of the soup and ramen matched up perfectly with one another, though the cha siu pieces were kind of tough but still well-flavoured. However, I think the additional flavour was lost in the broth because the pork didn't have a strong element on its own to stand out in the dish. \\n\\nThe tasty egg is one of those Japanese soft-boiled eggs that has been marinated in some kind of soy sauce and sugar glaze. It's definitely my favorite item at Sanpachi because the yolk has the same flavor and it definitely imparts a light creaminess to the broth when broken open. \\n\\nOverall, I liked my ramen a good deal and the restaurant would have four stars (not five because the pork didn't match up with the rest of the dish), but the poor attentiveness of the kitchen staff didn't add up. It didn't impact my meal at all but I do think it's a simple point that should be better addressed."},{"name":"Winflo Osteria","address":"1315 W 6th St","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"Almost close enough to be a neighborhood hangout for us, it is often on the way home.

This is the type of place you would expect in a trendy shopping/dining area, but instead is seated in a traditional suburban area in a small shopping center.

The outdoor seating is a small patio area that would be much more quaint it it didn't overlook the parking lot or the road.\\n\\nThe food: presentation was above average. Organized presentation without compromise on the contents of the dish. I ordered the chicken chimichanga, my wife ordered the chicken flauntas , & my son ordered a pair of soft tacos.

Yes, it is expensive, but worth every penny. We've gone here three times now, and every single time that we have gone the food has been spectacular. I'm not sure why prior reviews have said that the staff have been unresponsive and poor, but our experience has been very different. Every time we have gone the service has been at least good, and usually much better than that. They were even able to deal with our extremely large group of 25+ on two separate occasions, with very little advance notice, and not much extra waitstaff.\\n\\nTheir menu is essentially √† la carte, and if you're not really sure what you're ordering, it is best asked for suggestions, either from someone who has already been there, or from the staff. Keep in mind, that even though the food is in itself expensive per order, most of the food is intended to be shared. Even a single order of any of those things is not really meant for a single person. If you order a single bulgogi order, you should plan to share that with two people.\\n\\nFor those of you who are not particularly familiar with Korean barbecue, essentially there is a grill in the middle of the table. They bring a large platter of meat for you to grill yourself, and then you do all the grilling yourself. The nice thing about this is that you are able to grill things to the doneness of meat that you enjoy, as opposed to being forced to deal with a specific type of cooking. This is an especially good thing for me, as I like my meat essentially rare and alive, where my girlfriend prefers things dead. To be specific, I like my food raw. Even meat. She likes hers pink. This was put in due to evil glare from her.\\n\\nI am aware that this is not the best Korean restaurant in the world, having had it originally actually in Korea, and I am also aware that other Korean restaurants that are better than this do exist farther south. California in particular has a very large quantity of Korean barbecues, many of which are better than this place. However, for Portland this is the best that I am likely to find. As dipsticks go, there are a lot of Korean customers in this restaurant, and that is good enough for me.

I was on the phone with my girl and told her \\"I have to call you back, it's way to loud in here.\\" If that tells you anything about the noise level. I walked up, and was greeted by a very cheerful employee.  I saw the menu and ordered a Bacon Cheeseburger with everything + A1 Sauce. \\nThe wait was meh, the peanuts too munch on just don't match food to me.. but what ever.. \\nNow i did notice the same thing that other reviewers stated. There are like 20 employees in the kitchen. I was wondering if it's not trainers or something as this place just opened. (I did hear instructions being shouted and such)\\nWhen my order came. (number 97!) i got up from my crowded seating and got my brown bagged burger.\\nI had to sit outside to hear my thoughts, when i got out there i sat down and opened my bag to the sight of fries everywhere. I had to dig around to find my burger. Once this brave expedition ended (grease and salt covered hand later) I exhumed my tasty and greasy morsel. \\n\\nNot bad. It was good. Not the best (I am a Dan's Supporter) The burger was quite messy to eat. The toppings went everywhere as the size of the bun seems to not hold in the amount of treasure in my sandwich. I will say this, even though they don't tell you. The burgers have 2 patties, the minis have 1. So be for warned thin and weak people. \\nThe fries deserve a whole paragraph. They were perfect, if i have to come back for something extraordinary it would be the fries. \\nCrisp, Salty, and fresh. (these scream for cheese and chili) \\n\\nI then threw my bag away hopped in my car and drove away full and content (only to be hit by a mean case of heart burn later) :P\\n\\nWould i go out of my way to eat here.. No. Will i go again yes.\\n\\nFrankly, i have to say In n Out has better burgers. But these fries are awesome.

The sounds of the main dinner house were completely absent from our room.  That presented speakers at my meeting the ability to communicate without having to use mics or speak loudly.  It was perfection.  I can see this being perfect for a wedding rehearsal dinner, an adult birthday party, shower, anniversary, and such.  Cozy but not to the point of feeling crowded.\\n\\nAt my event, we were served champagne, Bellini, and an assortment of  delicious appetizers upon arrival.  The servers were also quick to accommodate special requests, like my seltzer water, and the server actually remembered my choice and brought me more when my glass was getting near empty.\\n\\nWhile we had a preset menu of pasta, salmon or steak, all of the meals looked amazing.  Side orders of mashed potatoes and green beans were served 'family style' and the portions were shared and ample for each table.\\n\\nI ordered the salmon and it was absolutely excellent!  Cooked to perfection with a delightful sauce that complemented the meal.  It was about the best salmon I have ever enjoyed at a restaurant, and I wish I could have eaten the entire salmon filet, but it was impossible.  The portion was huge!  A coworker ordered a steak and that also looked amazing and huge, cooked to perfection as well.\\n\\nThe dessert was also preset selection, cheesecake, chocolate cake [I think] and one other choice.  I stayed away from the dessert, but it looked amazing and all of my peers were raving, especially about the cheesecake!\\n\\nThere was ample parking when I arrived, so I self-parked, but there is valet parking that begins around 5pm or so.\\n\\nThe restaurant was beautifully designed and the decor was trendy and welcoming.\\n\\nGreat restaurant, beginning to end.\\n\\nWe will be back soon!\\n\\n[Usually, I take a lot of pictures to post, but it would have been quite inappropriate for me to do so at this dinner, so hopefully my descriptions will provide enough for now--EXCELLENT CUISINE!]"},{"name":"Bancroft & Co","address":"210 Andover St","city":"Peabody","stars":"3.5","text":"I went there last night and was very surprised to see such a posh restaurant in Peabody The staff was super friendly especially the two guys at the bar they knew I was in a rush so they got my steak out super fast , they have a expensive scotch list which is a big plus I will definitely be going back here again and again when I am in Peabody"},{"name":"ZamZam Foods","address":"1275 Boston Prov Hwy","city":"Norwood","stars":"3","text":"Food is fresh and AUTHENTIC Pakistani food.

I will say that although I requested it to be toasted, it wasn't as crispy as I thought it might be, but overall, a very good bagel. (4/5)\\n\\nNow pile on the cream cheese (actually, not THAT much), add the nova, capers, and red onions - and yes. a delicious combination you have. the red onions were sharp and crisp, the capers were great, and they cream cheese wasn't too thick/heavy - in fact, it was a nice somewhat thick and creamy consistency that really helped keep everything in between the bagels together.

The young girl working there looked like Milla Jovovich for anyone who is a fan of her.. you can fantasize that a model is making your crepes.  As people say- the line up was slow and long... but who cares on a nice sunny day.  It just makes the anticipation of tasty food all the more exciting.  The only thing that annoyed me was the farmer's market workers got to go to a secret line up in the back that was shorter.  I know they work there.. but I couldn't help feeling jealous.  \\n\\nI had the Ali baba crepe.  I asked for non-dairy.  So sweet that they have some non dairy crepes all ready to go.  And so awesome that it's gluten free!!  The lady was super nice - she right away offered that I could substitute something else since I wasn't having cheese.  It's a little thing to do but it means SO MUCH.  Often restaraunts are so annoyed when you ask to swap the cheese for something else.  (Usually what you are swapping would be cheaper than cheese but somehow server's don't see the logic behind this.)  I was so happy she offered and she was so eager to make my crepe enjoyable.  I substitued artichokes.  Oh yea... artichokes.\\n\\nThe crepe was crispy and yet softly wrapped around fresh flavourful ingredients.  Mine had red pepper spread, greens, garlic eggplant, and of course, artichokes.  My husband had a big one with cheese and potatoes and other stuff.  He really enjoyed it as well.  We walked around the market while eating the crepes.  It was a filling meal and my tummy was very pleased, as were my taste buds.\\n\\nIt was a great treat to have on a Saturday at the park.

The tabbouleh is very flavorful and the vegetables are very fresh, as is their fantastic house made pita bread.

Everything I have tried here I have really enjoyed and it is a great place to eat if you are vegetarian, however there is one thing that is bothering me and that is the meat. The meat quality is fine, I have just found it a bit bland, whether it is the kebabs or gyros I have experienced the same thing. While everything else on their menu is better than any other middle eastern food I have tried in town, the meat just left something to be desired, and I'm thinking it could use more seasoning or a different marinade. \\n\\nThat aside, this place is great. They also have some very good desserts, my favorites being the baklava and the Persian ice cream, which is flavored with rose water and pistachios, and is a must try as it is one of the best and most unique ice cream flavors I have ever had.

Here, there was one server walking around with the bottle and infrequently actually. There were times that my glass was empty and I just wanted to have the bottle there.  \\n\\nIn conclusion, Emerald is a great place to meet up for a cocktail before heading out for the night.

One of my close friends took me here for my birthday last year.  It was interesting as I just had Uchi 2 days before so there was opportunity for direct comparison.  \\n\\nA few complaints that I do have is that it isn't really well labeled.  Chinatown is what is says out front.  There's nothing that says Musashino from the street.  Also, it was really crowded (which really isn't the issues), but the tables and seats were so close together that my friend and I were literally next to a couple.  I might as well have been sitting in the dude's lap we were so close. \\n\\nThe sushi was good.  The service was decent.  As compared to Uchi, I would say that the sushi is much less creative, and bigger.  Instead of having bite site delectable goodies, you get normal size rolls with mainstream ingredients.  The ingredients were much less exotic, and the plating not as spectacular.  \\n\\nAdditionally, at Uchi, the waitstaff seemed to be there to serve you, inform you of everything sushi, entertain you, and make the date fabulous.  Musashino's wait staff was more functional - they took orders and made sure you didn't have anything to complain about.

Our daughter opened for the veggie-friendly Centro Cazuela, a yuca-plantain hash served with fried eggs, arugula,\\nmole verde & cotija. She loved it! Hubbs went for the biscuits & gravy, which, of course, had a Mexican flare with smoked cheddar-green chile biscuits and chorizo gravy. Again, he reported it was outstanding. All three of us were full by the half-way point (and remained that way for the rest of the day, I might add). \\n\\nMy visits to Centro have mostly been the same caliber in terms of service and food quality.

I would come back here for a glass of Sangria on a hot summer day. \\n\\nWe ordered: \\nCured Spanish ham and shaved Manchego cheese served with tomato toasted crostinis.

The sauce was terrible (what little taste it offered was undesirable and a little on the gritty side). I would rate this dish 2/10. \\n\\nWe had one of the special that evening, a Carpaccio dish that was pretty decent. Again, while there was a generous helping of meat, it only came with 2 crostinis and cheese. The flavor was really good when you were able to put them all together, but that was approximately 1 bite for each of us. I would give the one bite a 6/10. \\n\\nWe had planned to order paella, but when our waitress failed to return to check on us or deliver the check . . . we decided it was a good time to call this restaurant experience to a close. \\n\\nToro is my favorite tapas so far in Boston, well worth the extra dollars a meal there will cost you compared to Tasca.

They charged me full price for the dish, which comes with shrimp, which I'm allergic to, so I got it without shrimp. I have never asked for seafood to be removed from a dish with no price adjustment.

I had no problems the food was amazing.. and the PRICE WAS EVEN MORE IMPRESSIVE.. all that cost only $33 .. \\n\\nThe portions of the food was just right, it was not too much , I feel Americans totally over eat.  \\n\\nThe food was so good I went back again by myself, then ordered food for my partner to go..

It was probably about 30 percent full.  Not busy.  I had no expectations coming to this place, which is good for me.  Wish I could say the same for my fiancee. \\n\\nWe were seated in an adequate amount of time.  There seemed to be about 2 or 3 waitresses for the entire restaurant as I looked around.  \\n\\nUpon seating, they brought the chips, salsa, and water, then disappeared for a good bit while we looked over the menu.  The salsa was decently spicy with a good flavor, but the chips were mediocre, store-bought-flavored bland.  \\n\\nThe salsa forced me to power through my water and I sat a good while with an empty glass as the waitresses walked casually by.  But hey, it's not like they're being paid on how well they serve me.\\n\\nWhen we finally began to overtly start looking for service, they got the hint and stopped by and refilled things.  Whew.  I was close to grabbing the pitcher and pouring the water for myself.  Because I'm crude like that.\\n\\nOk now let's get some food.  I made sure to get a mojito, because any Mexican restaurant should know about at least three drinks; margaritas, cervezas, and mojitos(yes I know it's a Cuban drink but this is also America).\\n\\n\\nMy fiancee and I both went with the camarones chac mool, which is sauteed \\"gulf\\" shrimp, chef's choice of vegetables, and a scoop of white rice(huh?).\\n\\n\\nSkipping to the plates arriving, which was in a reasonable time.\\n\\n\\nThe camarones came in a delicious sauce, although they MOST DEFINITELY were NOT gulf shrimp.  Most likely these were farm raised because they were ridiculously small.  These also came with the tails on them, which isn't a big deal to me, but just be aware that it's there and you shouldn't just eat the tail, even if it is covered in sauce.\\n\\nThe rice was white and scooped out, dabbed with a piece of cilantro on it.  White rice?  Huh?  No doubt, another store-bought fail.\\n\\nThe chef's choice vegetables were just steamed spinach leaves.  No flavoring, just wet leaves(and I LOVE spinach so wtf?).  So I decided to mix it all together with the sauce and it made up for the amazingly bland flavor of EVERYTHING.  \\n\\nOddly enough, their credit card machine was down so they had to do it the old fashioned-way.  Meh.  They probably just can't afford to pay for the service any more.  \\n\\nI have to say that they're good with sauces, but fail at just about everything else.  \\n\\nI give this place 2 stars.  The service was bad, the food bland, the sauces were good, and the mojito was ok.  \\n\\nOnce again, I'm glad I didn't come here expecting anything.  And these prices?  They should be ashamed.  What a racket.  \\n\\nDo not go here.  \\n\\nFor the same prices and way better Mexican food in a better atmosphere, just go to Corazon at Castle Hill on 5th.\\n\\nJust sayin'.\\n\\nW.

Quick note: this being C-bus, I'm okay with flash-frozen fish being used in raw sushi, as long as it's used QUICKLY and not re-used the next day; anything much past a few hours, and the fish tastes icky.  \\n\\n1.  The rolls here are tasty, the fish for the nigiri is either fresh or used very very quickly after thaw.  We've never, EVER, had off-tasting fish from this place.  Personal favorite rolls: the dragon roll, caterpillar roll, nutty almond, lobster-salad roll. \\n\\n2.  Their presentation has been sliding a bit in the last couple months.  The dragon & caterpillar rolls -- they used to put some effort into making them look like said beasties, but now, just a standard roll-up and slice.  Boring.  Even the other plates, there's no real effort to make them look pretty.  C'mon, Edamame, have a bit of fun!\\n\\n3.  The deserts here are interesting:  my personal favorite is the \\"mochi\\" ice cream, gel-beaded balls of different flavors of Japanese ice cream.  \\n\\n3.  The gyoza is another personal favorite appetizer.  Yummy!\\n\\n4.  You must, MUST, try the crab salad.  It's a very inventive presentation -- it looks like an ice cream sundae when it's brought out, but man, is it good.  shredded imitation crab, shredded seaweed, lettuce, daikon, panko, with spicy sauce -- it's delicious.

It started with our reservation- the hostess asked me if we prefer to sit upstairs ( quieter and more intimate) of course I said yes. We waited past our reservation time to sit upstairs only to be told 15 minutes later there was nothing available. We were then escorted to a table on the first level, a huge round table for 6! I asked if they had a smaller table, and she took us to a 4 top booth (fine). \\n\\nNext: I don't think my a$$ had hit the chair yet before our HYPED UP waiter came rushing over to hand us menus. He literally lingered around the table while we reviewed the menu waiting for us to place an order. (Rushing rushing) We finally decide on some appetizers and all I kept hearing was his very poor up-selling. It was just a coincidence that all of his favorite items were the most expensive items on the menu. Mind you last night they were offering the regular menu and a prefix menu (which he never offered us) anyways... he convinces Vinny that the Porterhouse is the way to go and we continue to place our dinner order! \\n\\nNext: drinks and apps come out and I will say that the shrimp cocktail was very good and Vinny enjoyed his tomato bisque soup! Oh and the bread was yummy too, however throughout the night he continued to forget (lemon in my Diet Coke which annoys me to no end)\\n\\nNext: dinner comes out!\\nMy steak is completely raw in the middle ( I ordered medium) Vinny's steak is like a leather shoe sole completely burnt, dry and chewy. (He ordered well)\\nLobster mac n cheese is cold, mashed potatoes were cold. So now of course everything has to go back, and the waiter seems to be annoyed and he sends the floor manager over. We explain to the manager and of course he apologizes and starts jumping to things rectified.. \\n\\nNext: my steak comes back first (same steak) they cooked it some more. I accepted it because I was starving. Lobster man n cheese comes back piping hot! 15 minutes later Vinny's steak comes back out cooked properly and by then I was almost done eating my steak. (Very upsetting that we could not enjoy this meal together) And once the food came back out our HYPED UP waiter seemed to not care about refills or anything else for that matter.\\n\\nNext: Vinny ate a little bit and decided to have the rest packed to go. ( his steak, mashed potatoes and my lobster mac n cheese) the waiter took the food and said he would box it.\\n\\nThe floor manager returned to our table to apologize again and to tell us that he would be taking Vin's steak off the bill and sending over desserts on the house. Of course Vinny tried to refuse this offer, but I had no problem saying thank you and accepting it! I am in this business and when you screw up, you make it right!\\n\\nNext: we order dessert, Vin orders coffee and I order cappuccino. Desserts come out ( they were good, nothing to write home about ) coffee is good and my cappuccino is sitting on a coaster that for sure came out of the freezer. COLD ASS CAPPUCCINO he brought me! Vinny is now laughing uncontrollably and I am to the point where If i don't get out of there I'm going to go off in this manager. \\n\\nNext: Mr. HYPED UP brings out the check with our boxed food. We pay and we leave. At this point I am in total disgust. To make matters worse it was raining and the valet was one big disorganization, they were driving cars right past the guests trying to figure out what car belonged to who. \\n\\nNext: finally we get the hell out of there and we arrive home. I noticed that there were only two boxes packed which I found weird because we had 4 items to go. Well! I open the first box and I could not believe what I saw! This piece of work had thrown Vinnys steak in the box along with the mashed potatoes and lobster mac n cheese! (See photo)\\n\\nAnd If things couldn't get worse I was so sick last night! Spent it in the bathroom!\\n\\nI have NEVER EVER been though an experience like this EVER! I am appalled! I have worked way to hard in my life catering to customers, going above and beyond, taking pride in our food and service. I have worked every position in the restaurant business from the back to the front and from the bottom to the top! Never once have I ever been okay with treating customers like crap and never once have I slacked off on my management skills.

They can get there, but they need to work on the gracious, welcoming, smiling attitude--not quite there.  \\n\\nAdditionally, some of the wait staff seem to be junior in their careers, so they're not quite there in confidence or skill.  Which means that they may not bring things out from the kitchen in a good staggered manner and may not get the wine out as fast as you'd like.  That said, the more senior staff is wonderful, so it's kind of luck of the draw.  \\n\\nThe atmosphere and decor are wonderful.  And the setup is quite nice.  They serve the full menu downstairs and upstairs in the dining area.  On the upstairs patio, it's just appetizers and tapas style items.\\n\\nThe menu is oddly arranged, so this may be throwing some of the other reviewers off.  appetizers are at the top left.  Main dishes are top right with side dishes to the right of that.  Tapas style appetizers are below main dishes.  And pasta is below the appetizers.  The layout isn't conducive to figuring out how to start or order.  And the layout of the wine menu is a bit overwhelming as well because it's on tons of small pages that you have to flip back and forth through.  \\n\\nBut, get over it because the food's worth it.  And ignore the reviews from folks who wanted things like giant plates of food or giant salads.  You're not at that kind of restaurant.  These are smaller plates and are designed so that you can order multiple things and share.  But it's not an inexpensive place.  If you want inexpensive quantity, go somewhere else.  \\n\\nHere's what I suggest.  Approach it as if you were ordering tapas or sushi.  Order some things to get started, and then keep ordering bits of things as you sit.  Stop ordering when you're full.  We take this approach and have never been sorry.\\n - There are tapas style \\"pieces\\" of appetizers.  order a bunch of these when you get there and just enjoy them as they come out in a staggered style -- just like ordering tapas.  the crostini are amazing as are just about everything I've tried off of the piccolo menu.  \\n - Try an appetizer or two.  The polenta dish with the farm egg and mushrooms is amazing.  it's creamy style polenta and is just perfect.\\n - if you're still hungry, try a pasta and maybe some side dishes.  \\n - if you're still hungry after this, keep ordering.  \\n\\nWe haven't really done the main dishes, because we're always full before we can get to that part.  \\n\\nAND, go on Sundays when they have a family style fixed price dinner with a bazillion courses.  They're extremely accommodating of vegetarians, so go even if you're vegetarian and the menu doesn't look to be friendly.

Hey, if you've worked in a restaurant you know, as a server you can't make the bar/kitchen move any faster. That is the MANAGER's job!\\n\\nBest of Mahers: Outdoor patios. Mostly nice servers. Beer selection is good. The food is average though.\\n\\nWorst of Mahers: The aroma inside is a bit stale and sweaty, possibly due to poor ventilation, slow kitchen & bar (too slow), they run out of food on the menu quite often.\\n\\nMy husband absolutely loves this place (he's from Germany and likes the vibe there) but every time we go there we are amazed at how slow it is. There is so much I could write here but the gist is - only go there if you have time or if you plan to sit AT the bar.\\n\\nThat said, we talk all the time about how they could improve service - bottom line hire a few more people and bite the bullet that you only have to pay...ah....almost nothing as they work on tips. Lots of people are there = more drinks and food = more revenue = more tips. The additional help will pay off! It's amazing to us how the management either doesn't notice or doesn't care. \\n\\nAll that said, let the management know this rather than just review. Hopefully they will listen to the customers. So far, we haven't seen any results but,  maybe, If enough of us tell them maybe, just maybe, they'll listen.\\n\\n**Most importantly**, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE don't make the servers suffer with a bad tip because the bar and the kitchen is, literally, the slowest I've EVER experienced. The girls that work there are constantly running around trying to get to people. The guys, not so much. There are a couple of bad servers there - so I'm not referring to tipping appropriately is the server is just plain bad. \\n\\nTake it all in and just notice also that the setup has really slowed down the servers too.

Anderson Lane","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"There is nothing better than a good burger; much to my disappointment, I think most burger places are mediocre at best. In my opinion, it takes a gourmet burger to earn 5 stars. Elevation Burger is the exception to the rule.  \\n\\nThere are two categories: the classic cheeseburger & the gourmet burger. The classic cheeseburger is what I want on a Sunday afternoon after a long night of drinking. It's simple and usually had a thin meat patty. Enter Elevation burger. \\n\\nThe Meat:\\nI won't go to a burger restaurant that does not grind the patty on premises. Elevation not only does this, but uses only organic, grass fed beef. The meat tasted great. \\n\\nThe Cheese:\\nElevation burger's menu say \\"real cheddar.\\" I don't even think they offer \\"American cheese.\\" All that any burger restaurant has to do is buy good cheese and put it on top of the burger. If a restaurant ONLY serves burgers with \\"American\\" cheese, I won't go there. American cheese isn't cheese, it's garbage. I don't want a garbageburger, I want a cheeseburger. I understand that some people may expect it and as a business decision, it may be smart to offer it, but if a burger joint only has good cheese, I will respect them for saying no to bad ingredients. If you think I'm un-American or that I only eat European cheese, you are wrong. Wisconsin makes countless good cheese varieties. Why can't a Wisconsin sharp cheddar be the archetype of \\"American\\" cheese. Let's have some pride in the true American cheeses and start putting those on our burgers.  Elevation burger receives bonus points for refusing to conform to mediocrity, bad taste, and processed cheese.\\n\\nThe Accessories:\\nThe fries are cooked in olive oil. That's monounsaturated fat, people! The are perfectly thin and crispy and now I don't feel as bad for finishing the giant portion of them.\\n\\nMilkshakes:\\nOf course, they use real ice cream. I'll be back for one. \\n\\nThe simplicity:\\nI'm ashamed and amazed that so many places serve bad burgers with cheap ingredients and people eat them. Elevation burgers and their menu choices are simple with a few bonus toppings like caramelized onions. They have fries as a side, sodas, and milkshakes. It's Americana executed with simplicity and perfection."},{"name":"Bittersweet - Cafe & Confections","address":"836 Main St","city":"Louisville","stars":"3.5","text":"With front, back, and side patios, this place is wonderful for casual after dinner confections and drinks.

Let me just put that out there first. Before discovering this place - I got my at The Melting Pot (yeah I know it's not the same - mm cheese - but it was better than Shabu). \\n\\nSo anyhow - glad to have an actual hot pot place. For those who don't know what that is - think giant bowl of bubbly soup broth base, a bunch of raw ingredients (meat, veggies, etc). Just drop it in to cook. Fish it out.  Dip it in sauce. Good. Repeat. \\n\\nWhat I like to do is a combo of the regular broth and the spicy. They'll give you a pot with a divider. One side will have a ton of peppers floating in there (if you haven't guessed-that's the spicy side duh). I also like putting in leafy greens early so they can cook and soak in some flavor - cabbage and bok choy my go tos). I also like tossing in some shiitakes and mushrooms - adds some flavor to the broth. From there - you gotta rock the meat. Ribeye. Shrimp. Meatballs (esp the shrimp ones with the hidden meat in the center). \\n\\nFor dipping sauce - you have to get obnoxious. And I mean OBNOXIOUS. I go heavy on the garlic and mix that with some spicy oil and sacha sauce. If you're adventuresome - go ahead and crack a raw egg in there and give it a good stir - that's your dipping sauce. Mm mm mm. \\n\\nAnd if you like noodles. Order some. But wait until you're about half full to chuck them in. This way when they get done and you eat them-you'll be beyond stuffed but won't have a ton of noodles left. Why you ask?  Because the noodles will absorb all the broth which is a no-no if you plan to take any leftovers home. \\n\\nAppetizers are good too.

It was obvious the young man really didn't know that much about wine and was reciting a script.  Given that this is a neighborhood family style restaurant, the prospect of opening a $100 bottle of wines was not in my cards.

I was walking down 4th with a friend looking for a good pho restaurant to stop in at and didn't see too many options as we traveled.

The locations seemed to have been replaced with Chinese/Greek/Parisian/Indian/Japanese restaurants. I can't explain this at all. So, we walked by and I was lured in by the site of people hunkered over bowls of noodles, and poppin' music flowing out the door. This place is slightly hipster with slightly industrial d√©cor and younguns in Volcom gear serving up noodles in a bowl, but I bet they would serve it in a box if you asked. I got the peanut noodle bowl, since that's what made this place popular, but there were other great looking eats. I got it medium spicy which is 3 stars. There are the 4 star and 5 star, but per the dude behind the counter 3 was plenty heat, and he's not Nordic so I took his word for it. 3 star was perfect. I wouldn't go any higher since I like to taste the food and not the sting. It was a large portion of noodles, veggies, and shrimp (added for extra $). I would recommend and will hope to come again.

The atmosphere felt horribly disjointed - rickety wooden tables and chairs, stained glass window accents, old brick, eclectic artwork, and an odd floor layout to fill the space.  I'm trying to give them the benefit of the doubt (since they opened not too long ago) - but even then, I can only go so far.\\n\\nWe weren't served by any one waiter or waitress - just whoever so happened to be walking by at a particular time.  Service was sloppy.  When we ordered our food, my wife asked for no tomato or pickles on her Roast Beef Po' Boy.  Guess what she bit into when she got her sandwich?  Yup, pickles and tomato.  My wife reports that the Roast Beef Po' Boy, after removing those pesky pickles and tomatoes, was only \\"ok\\" - average at best.  I ordered the Buffalo Bleu Burger.  It too, was only \\"ok\\" - I scarfed it down alright, but you won't see me adding it to any \\"best burgers in Metro-ATL\\" lists anytime soon.  \\n\\nThe ONE thing I can do to sing The Imperial's praises is tell you about their \\"La Poutine De Georgia\\".  A-MAZING.  They take fries (which are pretty good on their own), ladle on some po' boy gravy, and top it with pimento cheese.  For an additional $1.50, you can get it with bacon.  Do it.  The bacon is entirely worth it.  Yes, it is a heart attack in a bowl - but a guilty pleasure worth having.\\n\\nIt's too bad that the poutine didn't make up for the overall lousy experience.  With so many other restaurants in the area that have their act together, I don't really see myself coming back here."},{"name":"101 Steak","address":"3621 Vinings Slope SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"What a fantastic experience!

My recommendation for the base soup is to go for the dual pot, which is partitioned into a herbal soup on one half of the pot and a spicy soup on the other, because it's the same price as a whole pot of one soup so you may as well get two different tastes.\\n\\nWhether you are into meats or vegetable, you will be able to find your favorite on the a-la-carte menu. Aside from a basic plate of raw basic materials like meat slices, you can also get interesting choices like fish balls or noodles.

I do not like nori, which is why I usually avoid rolls, but Edamame has the option of soy wraps, which made the California roll a thousand times tastier.  So overall, my usual meal was far better here.\\n\\nI also had miso soup, which tasted like miso soup, and we started with a plate of fried veggie gyoza, which tasted great but seemed quite pricey, at $4 for six little bite-sized pieces.

I come here when the truck is at MGH.\\n\\nThe first thing I tried was the kimchi hot dog. Kimchi and pimento cheese is a daring combination and I didn't know if the end result was going to be delicious or disgusting- turns out it's super good. Recommended.\\n\\nThe next time I came back, I was super tempted to get the hot dog again, but decided to try something new and got the mushroom roll and the togarashi fries. I didn't think the mushroom roll could possibly be better than the hot dog, but I daresay it was.. it was an amazing umami bomb of flavor, A+++ would get again. It was also satisfying for this omnivore, and it's nice to have a vegetarian option that's actually filling. The fries were definitely good, though I prefer shoestring fries over homefries. If you're a homefry person, you would probably dig these. \\n\\nPrices aren't cheap ($10 for the hot dog, $10 for the mushroom sandwich), but the portions filled me up and I think they're fair compared to similar trucks (ex: the mushroom sandwiches at Clover are around 10 dollars as well). The food is delicious and the people staffing the truck are super nice, so I'm willing to spend a little more to support them."},{"name":"Hong Kong","address":"1238 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3","text":"So, obviously, Hong Kong is not fine dining. That being said, when measured against other Chinese restaurants of this type, it's pretty good. It's fast, it's open super late, and it's reasonably cheap. Our go-to dishes: the egg drop soup is the classic Westernized version done right: bright yellow, lots of egg, and with just that right zing from the MSG. We quite like their potstickers, though they're definitely on the thick and heavy side; they're called Peking ravioli on the menu, and we always get them pan fried. For a lighter, trendier dish, their Singapore noodles are consistently good. We're always pleasantly surprised by how large and succulent the shrimp are given that the entree-sized portion is less than $9. The fried bananas are fun for dessert, but since the breading is on the thick and heavy side and the portion is huge, don't order it unless you're going to be sharing with at least two other people, either that or just skip dinner entirely and get the bananas."},{"name":"Library Square","address":"300 W Georgia St","city":"Vancouver","stars":"2.5","text":"Came here during the day for a non alcoholic drink last year after working on my zine.

To drink, I had a strawberry lemonade (alcoholic) and it was just the right amount of sweet, but it tasted more like a virgin drink. It was also very warm. I had to stir up some serious wind action to cool it down. \\n\\nOne of my friends had the Chinese chicken salad, which she said was great.

A while later we got potato skins they were not hot but tasted OK we asked about the onion and they said it was coming.  Then they started bringing salads, we said no we were still waiting for the onion, after about 10 minutes the manager came over and said the waitress had put the order in for the onion but had marked it as a to go item?  Now i have 2 questions didn't anyone think to ask why they Blossom was sitting in the to go area and no one there, the other thing is while the manager did agree it was there error, and we all know mistakes but mistakes to me are how a company shows how good it is.  We were offered nothing in compensation for waiting probably 45 minutes for our onion.  we were rushed after this as before we even had  chance to enjoy the onion we got our salads and soup, and then the main course arrived.  The good part is we had filled up on potato skins and Blossom onions  because no one ate much of their steak or chicken.  The steaks were  just tasteless and a bit salty the chicken my brother in law said was also salty and dry, I could see how dry it was and the ribs were also not very good.\\n\\nNow in the past in Colorado they have always offered a free rib for people to try and they did not here. \\n\\nWe also had to chase down someone for drink refills and one time the waitress said she was going to refill my drink and 5 minutes later still no refill?\\n\\nNow I am sure someone is now thinking if things were so bad why didn't you call and ask for a manager, well first if the manager didn't think a missed order was any bug deal I don't think she would do much for us, it was my Dad's birthday and I know he does not like complaining in restaurants.\\n\\nSo I am posting here if you are looking for a great tasting steak don't try here, if you like the steaks more power to you that is why there is more than one place to eat steak but if you are looking for a new place try somewhere else."},{"name":"Chick-fil-A","address":"12520 SE 93rd Ave","city":"Clackamas","stars":"3.5","text":"Wonderful, reminds me of my days in the USMC living on the East Coast."},{"name":"I Love Sushi","address":"2086 Cobb Pkwy SE","city":"Smyrna","stars":"3.5","text":"What I love about this place is the wide variety of authentic Japanese food.

When you step inside, it's dark as tar in there so be careful until your eyes adjust. Once they do, it's a typical, yet very likeable Tiki cocktail joint, with festive staff, decor, and music. \\n\\nWe went for happy hour which, if my memory serves me correctly, runs from 4-6pm. There was a happy hour list with select cocktails on sale for $6 each. After attempting to try about 2-3 of them, my friend convinced me to get the Volcano Bowl. After splitting it three ways it came to a  reasonable price, so my cheap behind, said \\"let's do it\\". To my surprise, this was tastier than all the other drinks I ordered... and I wish I'd known how tasty it was beforehand! I would have asked for this drink instead of all the others I tried. (Which let's be real, most of the time the gimmick drink/food of a place, is lackluster; but not in this case!)\\n\\nNow remember kids, the drinks are ranked by alcohol level. As a drinker, I was into this, because I wanted to know what drink packed the punch I was desiring. \\n\\nThis place unlike many places in Portland, had AC and I wasn't sweating the black off me. (Too be fair, we went during Portland's \\"heatwave\\" of the year, so even with the (LOW) high heat at 88, you could most likely disregard this entire comment any other time temperatures and heat comes up)\\n\\nConsidering this was my first Tiki Hut, I loved it, and will try to find more.

So that was some chocolate coconut mousse they were out of, and I settled on two of the other \\"sweet mini dessert\\" (clearly a pleonasm), which was called \\"Dessert Rosa\\" and described as \\"Delicious butter cake topped with pastry cream, bananas, strawberries, pineapple and whipped cream\\".  Only one problem: that's not whipped cream upon my buds' closer examination - clearly some kind of ersatz non-dairy white fluff.  \\n\\nSo is taking away half a star just for using \\"topping\\" as harsh as giving Jordyn Wieber 14.666 for one little step out of bounds on the floor exercise? (in case you're scratching your head, we're talking Olympics here)  Hell no!!  Here's why - if you go out of your way to describe a fake topping as \\"whipped cream\\", you're totally dishonest, for one thing, and for another, you're basically calling your consumers \\"stupid\\", because you don't think we can tell the difference.  That's an affront and a HUGE mistake in this consumer-dominated world of social media.  TOGETHER, we're VERY smart.\\n\\nThe other markdown is also for dishonesty, or just sloppiness - not sure which.

I get it that you don't or can't or don't want to do \\"special requests\\" like \\"lighter\\" \\"less oil please\\" or \\"no extra butter pls\\" - that's YOUR prerogative.

I do have to admit, I do have a tolerance for spicy food so that could be why I didn't feel like the level 2 was spicy at all. When trying a new spicy dish, I always go for the mid range in terms of spiciness level because each place is different. The broth not spicy at all, instead it was just super salt.

But no worries, their regular menu looked delish as well. \\n\\nTogether we shared the mussels + frites, fried pickles, and the sausage stuffed peppers. \\n\\nMussels were cooked in a white wine based sauce and also had chunks of smoked ham (I'm guessing it was housemade?) which were quite delish. However my friend had said that places like Justine's had larger portions for a only little bit more expensive. I liked it though, I would recommend it if you love seafood. This also came with frites (which are fries) which was served with what tasted like a mustard-mayo dip. Nothing special about the fries, but they were a-ok.\\n\\nFried pickles were odd. Not as flavorful/sour as most pickles I've had; they were incredibly light in flavor. Definitely house made, I would say. But I liked the crispness of the fried coating, well done.\\n\\nThe sausage in the peppers had to have been homemade, I loved it. It was 4-5 stuffed peppers served with 4-5 pieces of bread to dip in the sauce smothering the peppers. It was a vibrant red-orange color so we thought it would be flavor-overload or super spicy or something, but it was fairly mild. Very tomato-y, not as garlicky as expected given the description of the dish, but still good. Slightly disappointed it wasn't the flavor explosion we expected. I would rather just get the sausage and do without the bread and sauce.\\n\\nDefinitely worth a return trip.

But I was very pleasantly surprised.\\n\\nMy friend had heard that they offered half off wine on Thursdays, and we wanted to check it out.  We found out that the discount only applied to bottles (not glasses), but that wasn't a problem once we saw the extensive wine list.  We asked our server for a recommendation, and were impressed that she had several recommendations, in various price ranges, when we told her what we were looking for.  We chose a bottle that normally would have been out of our price range, but with the discount, it only ended up costing us what we would have spent on a couple of glasses anyway.  So, that was great!  \\n\\nWe each ordered a salad.  I had the arugula, and my friend had the tomato and mozzarella.  Both were fantastic.  The bread was average, but the crackers that came in the bread basket were good enough to make up for the rolls.\\n\\nWhen it came time to order, we had trouble deciding, and asked our server her opinions.  It was refreshing when she honestly told us that she didn't recommend one of the dishes we thought sounded good - and even explained why!  When all was said and done, we decided on the sea scallops and the veggie lasagna - both \\"top picks\\" from our server.  She was right.  They were both great.  The lasagna was full of cheese and loaded with tasty vegetables, and the sauce had just a little bit of a kick to it for extra flavor.  I was happy that the veggies hadn't turned to complete mush in the oven as I've experienced with some other vegetable lasagnas.  My friend's scallops looked absolutely amazing.  Four HUGE scallops with risotto and vegetables.  We both cleaned our plates.\\n\\nAfter salads and entrees, we didn't have room left for dessert, but a few passed by us on their way to another table, and they looked good too.  Next time.\\n\\nOur server was friendly and honest, and made us feel totally comfortable.  She seemed very knowledgeable about the menu, and her opinions seemed to be right on.  We had a good experience at Mezzo and will definitely go back - especially on Thursdays for half price wine!\\n\\nAnd by the way, their patio is amazing!  Great views of Creekside and the park/river, plus a huge fire pit that was perfect once the sun started to go down.

With the typical rusky party girl voice, lackadaisical approach to her job, and the sheer fact that she spent more time in the back likely with her boyfriend the dish washer than out front where she belonged, this solidified things for me.

It's cozy with a wooden/stone interior and heavy Japanese style dinnerware (let's be real, I'm a sucker for cuisine-appropriate dinnerware). The servers are efficient and constantly buzzing around you, which might be a turn off for some but nevertheless adds to the overall feel of being in a specialty ramen shop. \\n\\nI came here with in a large group and we had to wait quite a while for seating -- because the place is so small it is much better to come in pairs. We got a BBQ Pork appetizer to start, and I got to try some of the Extra BBQ Pork Shoyu Ramen, the Spicy Tsukemen ramen (I don't remember the exact name), and personally ordered the Black Charcoal Miso Ramen. \\n\\nTo be honest, only the Shoyu broth was especially delicious. It was fairly light and you could taste both the smoky meat broth as well as the shoyu flavors. The other two ramens were too flavorful, most likely packed with heavy doses of MSG (my mother, who is quite sensitive to the stuff, was drinking water all night after this meal). However, the star of the night was the BBQ pork (Cha Su). Motomachi Shokudo really doesn't skim on their meats and each piece was more succulent than the next. The appetizer was also served with cooked beansprouts and a chili paste that went very well with the pork. The bamboo shoots that came with each serving were also surprisingly delicious. While they are usually an innocuous part of ramen bowls, these bamboo shoots were cooked to crunchy perfection!\\n\\nWhat a wonderful welcome to Vancouver :D"},{"name":"Musashino Sushi Dokoro","address":"2905 San Gabriel St, Ste 200","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Same taste, same good service!

For years it was the go to place in South Austin for some interior grub. I remember the hype and the great reviews and those huitlacoche empanadas. A few days ago I needed an al pastor taco fix and despite the falling ratings I turned in the parking lot.\\n\\nPlace hadn't seemed to change much. I had changed a bit; thinking the wife was barely pregnant when we dined here previously. Now, a two year old little Rooster tagging along with me. For the venue I'm changing his name to reflect his Mexican counterpart.\\n\\nEl Gallo started off with the queso. I usually throw out some cheese on a plate for his chips and tortillas. The rest never gets eaten and ends up a congealed brick in a bean bowl. Not this day my friends; the blend of the white cheese with the pico was naughty good. The bowl was empty and hopefully no passerby got photos of me almost pouring queso in my mouth. I'll also give them some props for the smoky chipotle salsa as well.\\n\\nMy al pastor arrived as well as El Gallo's rice. The flavors of the al pastor were the best I've had in a while. Seems they threw the meat and the pineapple on the griddle producing a crunchy yet refined texure on the filling. Delicious charro beans and flavorful pacific style rice rounded out a surprisingly good meal for both of us. There were no issues with service on this visit; both servers working hard for the tables with lunch patrons. \\n\\nFor this visit Sazon picks up right where I left her some two years ago.

The pork belly masa cake is explosively flavorful, with bacon in surprising places.  The sauce with it is so incredibly spicy that nobody, not even the friend that eats his sushi coated with an inch-thick layer of wasabi can eat it. It doesn't matter.  The dish doesn't need it.  It's plenty flavorful enough.\\n\\nNext up is the avocado salsa.  I am an avocado snob.  If an avocado is one day too ripe, it can ruin an entire dish, even if avocado makes up only 5% of the total food.  This salsa, however, is fresh and perfect, served with crisp chips that stand up to the task of scooping up the fleshy chunks.  (No, fleshy chunks is not the most appetizing way of describing food, but the tomatoes are so plump and juicy that it's the first phrase that comes to mind.)\\n\\nThe ahi tuna tacos arrive so heavily piled with cucumber, seaweed, and serrano peppers that at first I can't even find the tuna.  When I do find it, it's so pillowy and sinew-free that I think it's a bed of tomatoes.  The serranos overpower the tacos a bit - God help you if you accidentally take a bite with more than one pepper - but they are easy to arrange or remove based on your taste and spice-tolerance.  The fish is sushi-quality, melt-in-your-mouth goodness, its ocean flavor amped up by the seaweed and freshened even more by the cucumber.\\n\\nTo relieve my poor mouth from all the spiciness, I've been drinking a lot of my cucumber mint limeade.  In fact, I need another one before the appetizers are even over.  I notice something when I order the same drink twice; it tastes entirely different the second time.  My first drink is cucumber-heavy, almost too vegetabley-fresh, with a weak kick of mint and hardy any lime.  My second one is minty nearly to the point of suffocation, with a strong bitter undertone that must come from the lime peel, because if it's not, it's coming from something poisonous.  This second drink must be tempered with strong food or else the bitter undertone stays, coloring such delicate flavors as the ahi tuna and the avocado salsa.  Another friend, who's driving back later, has a nonalcoholic something called a 'Mango Spritzer', which, to me and to everybody else, tastes exactly like orange juice.  Perhaps Centro's nonalcoholic drinks are not their specialty.\\n\\nSince the restaurant's name conjures up a vision of a palace full of bartenders who only care about mixing the perfect drink, we are pleasantly shocked to find that the entrees are, without exception, delicious, unique, and hearty.  These are no foo-foo square plates with tiny heaps of fussy food in the middle.  My 'El Hombre' burrito comes positively bursting at the seams, with meat and shrimp and mushrooms and creamy sauce spilling out the sides and nearly flooding over the edges of my plate.  The aroma of it when my fork pierces the tortilla skin mixes nicely with the shrimp tacos across the way, which are delicately arranged and fiercely garlicky.  Even the vegan among us, who is perfectly happy eating lentils for weeks, admits that his big, overflowing crispy tofu and vegetable bowl is 'unlike anything [he's] ever tasted'.  The real surprise, though, at least for me, is the barbacoa lacquered short ribs.  Along with being an avocado snob, I am also a rib snob.  The meat must fall off the bones, it must not be in the least bit tough, and the sauce must be strong enough to flavor the meat for the entire time it takes to chew, so there isn't that stale, bland old bit of meat still left in your mouth after all the sauce has been swallowed.  Centro's ribs reach and then far surpass my standards with their strong, sweet-savory sauce drenching the ribs from the outside all the way to the bone.\\n\\nFor dessert, what do we try?  Actually, to be simpler about it, what don't we try?  Just the sopapillas.  They look boring.  Everything else arrives on a giant platter with a sprinkling of spoons, and even though some of us are so stuffed we had to ask for doggie bags, there's a loud clinking of warring spoons as we all fight for the first bite of the mango and lime pie.  Or the vanilla bean cheesecake.  Or the chocolate mousse and praline pie.  Our hands jostle one another, then relax as we all shove our spoonfuls into our mouths and let out a collective sigh.  Needless to say, nothing at all is left on the dessert tray, not one tangy smear of mango-lime filling, not one rich sliver of cheesecake.  Not even a drop of the two sauces that came with the cheesecake.  \\"I dare you to drink that chocolate sauce,\\" someone says to someone else.  \\"Why would you have to dare me?\\" someone else says back to someone as they raise the cup and drain every bit."},{"name":"Flyers Wings & Grill","address":"5621 W Colonial Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"These are the best wings.

But watching how unorganized the 4 people working at the front desk (why not have some of them bussing tables? or doing anything productive???) were and how rude they were when asked what type of wait we were looking at was really off putting. I also watched parties of 4 who got there after us get seated prior to our party of two and it just didn't make sense. It also does not make sense to have two to three tables just sitting there empty while your hostesses seem to just sit bewildered about how to run the front of the house. \\n\\nThat being said, our waitress was fairly quick and quite nice.

And that's a good thing! \\n\\nMy first time here I ordered a chicken focaccia sandwich at $9.50. It was ok, but a bit light on the chicken which was disappointing so I would take a pass on that one.\\n\\nI was invited back, and this time I enjoyed the chicken club, quinoa yoghurt-based salad and gluten free brownie. And of course how could I overlook the tea?! I decided to try a lovely decaffeinated tea: \\"The Natural Beauty,\\"  and it did not disappoint. If I ever decide to give up coffee for good, this would definitely be my first stop for a modern tea shop. I nursed this cup throughout the day in fact, and it was quite sweet, pleasing to drink and flavourful, yes, even for a self-professed coffee addict. \\n\\nThe sandwich, while still sparse on the fillings was a much better choice.\\n \\nThe quinoa salad was quite tasty and a satisfying accompaniment to the rest of my lunch. It kept well as take out, and I was able to eat the rest with my dinner which was an added bonus.\\n\\nThe brownie, while not as sweet as what I've become so accustomed to eating from most bakeries was delicious and did not leave me feeling like I had overdone it with the sugar. In the end, I much preferred it to the rot-your-teeth kind of brownie that I've ordered all too often at other bakeries. Although I'm certainly not gluten free and I'm reluctant to become so, I appreciated this one, and I'd recommend it to those watching their gluten intake or otherwise.\\n\\nI did not eat \\"in\\" for either visit, although I enjoyed the environment of the quaint little tea shop. Too bad the tables and chairs weren't near the front, however, as I'm sure it would draw even more people if they could re-arrange their layout to appear more welcoming.\\n\\nBoth times I was served by the sweetest server and proprietors ever. While it never seemed to get too lined up at the counter, they were busy serving both restaurant patrons and counter guests at the same time. It was fun to look at all of the products while I waited, so it didn't feel as if I was standing there for long. \\n\\nSo, altho the sandwiches are a bit pricier than one might expect, I'd venture to go for the salads, desserts and teas that they offer and you won't be disappointed.

In fear they might not come back, my elderly mother wanted to just go ahead n place the order.  Her assistant said that was fine...no problem.  Our waitress came back and pretty much bitched us out for placing our full order.  I tried to explain the situation and asked her to be sure the food didn't come out all together at the same time.  She was fine with that, but treated us bad the entire time.  We came in at 1:30...we didn't leave the restaurant until 4:00.  There were only three of us...no alcoholic drinks, no speacial requests...it took that long to get our food from appetizer, to salad, to entree to dessert.  Unfreakin believable...besides the fact she was rude the entire time.  \\n\\nNow the food...oh the food...it was good.  We ordered the Fried Cheese and Chopped Salad.  Some of my favorite things.  Then my boyfriend got the special sandwich, which was Italian Beef on Focacia...it was amazing.  I ordered the Rustic Chicken/Shrimp.  It was good, really good, but not as good as some other things I've ordered.  Believe me, that's not a complaint just that I didn't enjoy it as much as some other things I've ordered there.  My mother ordered her usual pasta dish.  When they finally allowed us to order dessert (took over 30 minutes just to get them to come back and take our order), we ordered Nana's pound cake and two individual desserts.  Everyone at the table said the pound cake wasn't as good as it normally is.  The bananas were too big and the cake was much drier than normal.

After pioneering the farm-to-table movement in Atlanta and earning a James Beard Award in the process, owners Emily Saliers (of the Grammy winning Indigo Girls) and Ross Jones moved the restaurant to its current uptown location in May 2012. The new space boasts a patio, private dining, an expansive bar and valet parking in a comforting, yet elegant atmosphere.\\nToday, Watershed on Peachtree continues the restaurant's long standing commitment to its founding principles with great attention to detail and community consciousness. The best tasting food arrives fresh from local and organic farmers. The best tasting wine is served in a proper glass at the proper temperature. We value each guest and everyone is welcome at Watershed on Peachtree.\\"\\n\\nMy dinner club visited Watershed on their Wednesday fried chicken night. The restaurant has received numerous accolades about their fried chicken so we had to check it out. I am familiar with the location as I once considered moving to Brookwood. I parked on the street, but valet parking is available at the back of the building. \\n\\nI was the first to arrive so I took that time to peruse the menu. I knew I was getting the fried chicken, but wanted to see what other items I may want with my entree. The fried chicken comes with biscuits but no other side. I asked about the seasonal veggies and luckily they had brussels sprouts on the menu. I ordered just baked cornbread sticks to start even though I was getting biscuits. This was shared with the table. The sticks were decent. I thought they were cooked a bit too long. I was expecting it to be more gooey. More like a corn casserole in a way. Oh well. The chicken arrived and we were all rather surprised at the appearance. This is not your standard Southern cooked fried chicken. They have ruined it! It's all fancy and specialty. Ugh. I just want a piece of fried chicken like my mom cooks. Skin on, deep fried, nice crunch. This chicken was obviously not battered in flour and deep fried. I'm sure it is healthier, but it sure isn't tastier. OK, the seasoning itself is fine. But this is not what I want when I want fried chicken. Everyone got a different mix of chicken pieces. Too bad we didn't discuss till after we ate as we seemed to have each gotten pieces we didn't really want and could have swapped a thigh for a breast, for example, with each other. Biscuits were good and great to have honey to go with. Brussels sprouts were very good. Someone else had commented that they wish they had ordered them. \\n\\nI would be willing to try something else on the menu. I don't get the hype about the fried chicken."},{"name":"Watershed on Peachtree","address":"1820 Peachtree Rd NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Great food great location great service valet parking the fried chicken is amazing \\nCS is a great bartender will def be back."},{"name":"Hale Pele","address":"2733 NE Broadway","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Cocktails are amazing, as you would expect.

Especially veggie juice. Especially organic veggie juice. And that's what this place seems to be all about. \\n\\nGreenleaf was an unexpected find. I happened to be killing time in the Pearl and stumbled upon a juice bar! Something that even a few years ago didn't even really exist here, and now they seem to be popping up everywhere. And I only have two words to say about that: fuck yeah!\\n\\nSo yeah, these guys make juices and smoothies to order. The veggie juice combos are more creative than some of the other joints in town (Cilantro! Jalape√±o! Tomato!) and the smoothies look tasty as well. My choice was a tomato, veggie and jalape√±o number (the G8?) that tasted exactly as I expected. Like a damn good virgin bloody, but crazy healthy instead of morning drunk style. At about $6 for a 16oz, it's what you'd expect to pay for fresh organic juice. \\n\\nThe guys here are plenty friendly. The space is acceptable for a quick sit, but the vibe is hectic. A few tables and chairs, a counter and a large blackboard wall with chalk menus. \\n\\nBut hey, it's all about the juice, right?"},{"name":"Rogue Eastside Pub & Pilot Brewery","address":"928 SE 9th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"We were on a super fun cycle pub ride with a mixed group with a birthday and a bachelorette party. We stopped by 2 places and then stopped by Rogue. They had a \\"block party\\" going on. We arrived at 2:52 and a worker said the private party had pretty much wound down and we were welcome to come in. He removed the private party flyers and the 12 of us came inside. We walked up to the bar and the bartender Russ told us we had to leave until the private party was over. We informed him of the other Rogue employee telling us to \\"come on in, have a seat\\" and he was quick to respond \\"Well, I'm the manager and you need to leave until the private party is over.\\" We were kind of shocked and dismayed that he chose to be a real a-hole about this and as a group, we got back on the cycle pub and went to a pub that welcomed us with open arms. I totally understand if we were to walk in and crash a party, but the event was a over at 3:00  and the place was pretty much a ghost town, but Russ was a total ass and ran us all out of the place, and told us to come back in 8 minutes. The driver of the cycle pub was shocked as well and stated they may have to look at someplace else for their stop on the tour. \\n\\n\\nShame on you Rogue and especially Russ, I'm not sure if you had been having a bad day, or were just \\"over it\\" for the day, but the way you treated us was totally out of line and very inappropriate as the manager of a place that we all used to enjoy  frequenting.

In other words.... all the \\"artifacts\\" of a good Chinese restaurant. \\n\\nMy dining partner (very well traveled) noted these artifacts and observed that there was a good shot that the food ought to be authentic and good.\\n\\nExcept that it wasn't. It was mostly awful. \\n\\nEven though my colleague reported his egg-drop soup to be good, my hot & sour soup was thick as paste and gave me a very rare case of texture nausea. I had left most of my soup in the bowl--which was removed from the table after only asking whether I was done and not asking for my opinion. \\n\\nEven though my teriyaki beef skewers were decent, his egg rolls were overcooked, had meat instead of shrimp (unexpected but perhaps a localization), and he left 1 1/2 of them (they were big) on his plate. His uneaten egg rolls were also removed without comment. \\n\\nMy crispy garlic chicken was fair, but in contrast my friend couldn't make it past one mu shu pork wrap and said the whole thing tasted \\"weird\\". His pile of mu shu appeared untouched and when the server asked whether he'd like a take-home box he said, \\"no\\" she asked \\"you no like?\\" And my colleague said, \\"no, I no like.\\" \\n\\nShe just took it away, too, and handed us the bill. Nothing was comped. \\n\\nThe fact that between the two of us 6 items were ordered and only 3 of them were fully consumed was not acknowledged. Of the other 3 items all were at least 50% untouched and one was over 90% untouched--seemed to go unnoticed. \\n\\nThese sorts of performance results might have prompted some sort of observation on the part of the establishment. As would likely happen in any self-respecting restaurant where a $14 entree was completely dumped, in addition to all the other uneaten food, one might think something would be comped or at least an acknowledgment or apology.

Then the rolls and hamachi came out at about the same time and while they were good, they couldn't stand up to the first 2 dishes we had.

I would've given it a 1 star, but knowing that it isn't a ramen joint that I should be more giving.  The ramen is prob the worse I've had... I should've stayed home and eaten my instant ramen instead.  The tonkotsu broth didn't taste like tonkotsu because it is usually milky colored.  I asked for mine to be spicy and they ended up using the korean bulgogi sauce for that.  Umm first of all, that sauce isn't even spicy to begin with!!  It has a lot of sodium which made my broth EXTRA salty!!!  Then the noodles weren't even ramen noodles.  I think they used tonkotsu noodles, which I've never had before.  It reminded me of angel hair pasta or wonton noodles.  They were soggy and soft which was a horrible texture in noodle soups.  The pork was ok, and the only good thing in the bowl was the egg.  It was a soft boiled egg and was perfect once i cracked it open.  The service was beyond slow.. it took us more than 30 mins to get our noodles once we placed the order.  I thought it was ramen night and expected the ramen to come out a lot faster than it did.  I think other people who sat after us got their ramen before us too!  I will prob come back for their bbq food but will never recommend anyone for their ramen unless they change their recipes."},{"name":"Sweet Cheeks Q","address":"1381 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"We went to this place because a friend of ours was dying to try it.

The prices are outrageous for horrible food and the wait staff is less than mediocre. The atmosphere was great and could be pulled off if the food delivered.

Recently however I've noted that my seafood linguine's mussels and prawns have been a bit sandy, and the feta appetizer now has more tasteless tomatoes and less tasty feta.

You can purchase a pre-selected tasting menu of four items plus a desert or you can select as many items as you want on an a-la-carte basis.   The tasting menu (or an equivalent a-la-carte selection) adds up to a full meal for this reviewer (whose appetite is lamentably robust)  and costs about what an equivalent amount of food would cost in a more traditional restaurant of comparable quality.  The small offerings allow diners to pig out with more or graze with less depending on preference and budget.\\n\\nThe two chefs prepare the food behind the counter that accommodates about half of the clientele (the others being seated at a few tables nearby.)  A lot of the preparation occurs before the restaurant opens but final prep occurs in full view of the lucky recipients.  They use a number of new cooking techniques involving very slow cooking at very precisely controlled temperatures but there is not a stove or an oven in sight.  They will discuss with you at whatever length you wish the preparation techniques but the bottom line for me is that it tastes sublime.  The quality of the ingredients is first rate and the combinations are inspired.\\n\\nThe cooking techniques obviously contribute to the final result, probably in a lot of ways that exceed my technical capacity to appreciate.  It is certainly true that the ingredients are presented with a level of precision that would be hard to achieve with more traditional methods.  It is also true that, if you are looking for fried or roasted food, this is probably not the place for you.  That said, a lot of what makes Racion special for me is the ordinary, old-fashioned task of finding tastes and textures that fit well together and combining them to produce something much more delectable than the sum of its parts.\\n\\nIt is hard to overestimate the magnitude of the challenge that Racion has set for itself.  Not only do they come up with sublime combinations perfectly prepared but they do it in ways that are nowhere to be found in the Cordon Bleu book or the published recipes of some famous chef somewhere.  (You will search in vain for canard a l'orange, steak au poivre, sole meuniere or any other dish that you have had anywhere else.)  For the typical diner, they have to do this not once or twice (as in a more traditional restaurant) but five times or more.  A quick review of the menu will be sufficient to illustrate how innovative these plates are.  Most of us can't really imagine the dish from the description but we can easily see that whatever is coming, it will be unique.\\n\\nAt its core, Racion's excellence is, for me, embodied in its ability to conceive and execute culinary ideas that are innovative and delicious. a completely traditional accomplishment.  We ate there last night and my first selection (the foie gras torchon creation) left me planning a return in which I would order five of them and nothing else.  The other four selections, however, were all excellent and I am glad I did not miss them.  I also tasted some of my companions' selections and found them to be of equally exceptional quality.\\n\\nThe ability to succeed not only in creating one or two interesting and exceptional dishes but to do it over and over with uniformly stunning success is something that Portland is lucky to have at its disposal.\\n\\nPortland is, of course, lucky to have its many fine and varied restaurants.  Racion is not for everyone.  If you are looking for a big slab of meat, this is not your restaurant.  If you measure the quality of your experience in dollars-per-ounce, you will likely be dissatisfied (although not more so that at any top end Portland restaurant.)  If you want the chance to sample a variety of innovative and delectable creations that you probably could not even imagine on your own, Racion cannot be improved on."},{"name":"Al Hawr","address":"3500 SW River Pkwy","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"We travelled from Seattle and wanted authentic Lebanese food.

First, it's really easy to get to.  There is ample parking in the front along the street as most people are just coming and going.  Second, the staff is really friendly and patient with you if you're like me and it takes you FOREVER to decide what you want.\\n\\nAt any rate, I ordered two falafel pitas, two extra sides of falafels (to save for later), and a greek salad.  The falafel pitas were delicious - the bread was light and fluffy, the vegetables were fresh, and the falafels were tasty.  The hummus could have used a little bit of a \\"kick\\" to it, but overall, it was delicious.  I popped the extra falafels in the freezer once I got home and reheated those later - still yummy.  \\n\\nAt the time of my visit, the menu board had a handwritten sign next to it saying prices went up by a $1 and were not reflected on that current sign.  Okay, so it wasn't the most ideal situation, and it was certainly nothing that broke the bank per se.  When LivingSocial sent me a survey about my visit, I did mention it.  The owner contacted me and explained that the new menu board hadn't arrived yet, but their point-of-sale system had, and the employee at the time didn't feel comfortable having to explain it to customers when given a higher bill.

I was half worried that we wouldn't be able to find a decent place to sit down nearby, but I was wrong. We walked into Sweet Cheeks and were greeted by three smiling hostesses and were seated immediately even though it was dinner time, and Fenway was filled with people. \\n\\nThe atmosphere of Sweet Cheeks is awesome. It's a venue where alternative personalities seem to find their groove in the work place. I ordered a cocktail ($10) and it was amazing. It ended up being the only drink I had all night because it got me so buzzed, and it's delicious flavour made me forget to drink it slowly. I should note that their alcohol selection (including beer) is MASSIVE!!! It reminded me of being in Europe, and was not at all what I am used to seeing in American restaurants. \\n\\nWe filled our table with Hush Puppies, Biscuits, and Fried Green Tomatoes. The hush puppies felt more like a dessert so we didn't eat too many of them even though they were delicious. The biscuits were massive, and we realised that next time we would probably just order half the amount of biscuits and have everyone split one. They were like heaven, and their amazing taste was partly due to the honey butter provided to spread over them. Never in my life would I have thought I'd enjoy a fried green tomato - but even now I am dreaming about returning just for them and how good they were. No one at the table had had them before - and everyone was in love. \\n\\nI ordered brisket and by the time it arrived I was already full. One bite of it with the house made vinegar and I was hooked. Everyone at the table ate and ate and ate until we were beyond full because of how delicious everything was. Every single thing that we were given had the most immense flavour to it. It all tasted fresh, well prepared and cooked. As we ate we admired the ascetics of the place - gorgeous wooden walls, long tables which we shared with other patrons, and the smell of the smoker were enough to create the perfect atmosphere. It was awesome to be able to see the entire kitchen, and layout of the place while we were dining. \\n\\nMy friend was so excited about her left overs the next day that she texted me about eating them - and I was insanely jealous that I had finished my plate. I think Sweet Cheeks is the best restaurant that I have ever been to. \\n\\nNow don't let anything that I say next taint the awesomeness that is Sweet Cheeks - but the only thing that was sorta bad was it seemed out waitress forgot about us after she took our order. We really didn't see her much after that. The cocktails are also a bit steep in price, and the decor in the bathroom is really tacky and doesn't fit with the ascetics of the place- I can see what they were aiming for, but it sorta feels like you're walking into the bathroom at someone's house and not a restaurant. Also they put bread on all the trays but I didn't see a single person in the place eat it. It seemed that all the trays were being cleared with their bread still on it. \\n\\nI'd also like to recommend if you go there to get half a pound of the meat you want and then order a side or an appetizer of something - it can be cheaper than getting the actual tray and you will probably be just as full. Should also note that I thought I heard someone mention everything is really organic while we were there, but also heard there is High Fructose Corn Syrup in all the sauces - so if anyone has allergies or issues with that you should probably take note that its in there."},{"name":"Sweet Cheeks Q","address":"1381 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I love ribs and can't seem to find any good BBQ places around Boston.

I tried the berkshire pork ribs (1/2 slab) and pulled pork. The ribs and pulled pork lacked the smoky flavor that I was looking for. The ribs were also a little dry. I had to dab it in a lot of sauce to add more flavor to the dish. Also, the BBQ sauces that they have on the side are also not that special. It was a little runny and I personally prefer a thicker sauce with my BBQ.\\n\\nThe sides are also not that impressive. For the sides I got grits and cole slaw. The cole slaw was super chunky and tasted very onion-y. I wish there was more acidity and for it to be more thinly sliced. The grits however, was very delicious. It was warm and fluffy. It was comforting eating the cheesy grits. I would say that was the star of my meal.\\n\\nI also ordered some biscuits on the side. The biscuits are huge! They also serve it with honey butter.

We were then greeted by the manger where he asked us, \\"Did you guys just seat yourselves?\\" When we explained to him that we sat down because a waitress told us we could, he simply told us that we would have to get up and wait to be seated at the numerous empty tables. He did not care to compensate or acknowledge the fact that we sat down because of the advisement of his team so we left. I understand that you have to respect the current reservations that other guest have set but when your restaurant is 20% full on a Saturday night because you're hoping that the customers that set reservations actually show up and you currently have paying customers waiting to eat.... bad management skills."},{"name":"St. Honor√© Boulangerie","address":"2335 NW Thurman St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Their baked goods are super cute and tasty!

I've never had to wait long for a table, but just hanging out at the front is a kind of nice way to start your evening. The hostess and bartender are super nice. The decor and lighting are perfect for a rustic Spanish meal. I even love the guitar music - not too loud so you can still have a conversation. \\n\\nThis is the Anti-TGI Fridays. No gimmicks, no flair, no huck-huck waiters trying to be your best friend. Just really good food, and great service. \\n\\nThe bread before the meal comes with a different spread depending on what day of the week you're there and what the chef feels like making. I've had the roasted red pepper spread (yum), a buttery garlic one and my favorite, a mushroom spread that was full of flavor. \\n\\nIf you're going to Tasca, you have to have the sangria, so find a safe way to get home. It's award-winning, and during the summer, there are several varieties. You can get a full or half pitcher or drink by the glass. Go full if you're sharing. It's delicious.\\n\\nI've never had the entrees, just the tapas. Get two or three per person, you won't regret it. I've literally had everything on their last two menus (they switch it up every once in a while) and everything is delicious. \\n\\nI've daydreamed about the cassoulet - definitely try it! \\n\\nThe garlicky shrimp is so so good, and you can smell it coming down the restaurant. \\n\\nThis is a great place to take your time and try something new. Really enjoy your food. You're never rushed here. \\n\\nDefinitely sign up for the emails at the end of your meal. It's worth it. Tasca has monthly events (live entertainment, wine tastings) that you get first dibs on with the emails. They also send you a coupon for your birthday.\\n\\nI've brought my mom here for Mother's Day two years running and the prix fixe meal does not disappoint.

It's an old style location with no indoor seating at all.  They do have a parking lot so you can eat in your car.  They also have some outdoor tables, but when the temperature drops below a certain point, nobody is going to want to sit outside to eat ice cream.  There is a walk-up window and a drive-thru window, so taking your order to go would be a good option.  I used to love their Peanut Buster Parfaits which were freshly made in tall plastic cups.  However, those need to be eaten with a spoon so it was impractical to eat them when driving (remember they have no indoor seating, so I would order to go and start heading home).  Nowadays, I get a Buster Bar which is a facsimile of a Peanut Buster Parfait with all the same ingredients.  The difference is that it's on a stick and is pre-made and kept in the freezer.

The price was alright that time, but when I came back, I definitely saw that if you order more than one thing, that price goes crazy. \\n\\nThe second time I was back, I ordered oatmeal (which my tongue translated as granola, so I didn't eat too much of it) and asked for the dessert menu (which is a bit odd at brunch, but I love dessert at any time of the day), but she just brought me the check instead.

I pointed out that the lobster roll came with fries and the server said she'd check with another server and the chef. After 5 minutes she came back and said that the menu had an error but since it was their fault, they would make the fries. That's great! The dish then arrived with home fries. I politely told the busboy that I had requested french fries, and was told again, very rudely, that they don't make fries.

You will find that this creamy, freshly fermented dairy certainly makes its way into pretty much everything. All in all, I cannot say enough about the mouthfeel of all of the grub. The panelle is mushed up chickpeas, fried into a light rod. The suppli is the perfect rendition of arancini, what with spot-on creamy rice. The crostinis are pretty dang amazing--the special pear, honey, and ricotta one was downright amazing.\\n\\nThe pastas were absolutely insane, being perfectly al dente and all. The bucatini amatriciana offers up Calabrian (which I just found out is a region South of Naples--doesn't it sound like it comes out of Spain?) chiles, guanciale (think the most soft pork fat in town), and a heavy dose of oily tomato sauce. It coats your mouth, so that you will just get all of that unctuous character in every nook and cranny of you trap. The rigatone? Savory rib stickin' ragu, cherries, pine nuts, and a perfect nutty touch provided by the sliced ricotta salata. You can't even imagine.\\n\\nAll these simple ingredients clearly demonstrate that a top notch chef can do anything.

When not getting too many wings than my body should consume, I get the chicken finger salad.  Sounds lighter but it sure fills me and makes me just as happy.

FOOD & DRINK\\nLike any taqueria, they have tacos, burritos, quesadillas, etc... Being a taco man, I tried four different kinds.\\n\\n*Al Pastor: Pretty disappointing. They smother the meat in this sauce that tastes like orange juice and tomatoes, and it's way too sweet. They should've used a dry rub, like a marinade like for kabob. I would not recommend.\\n\\nNote: Regarding the actual tortilla for the al pastor -- and the other tacos -- came in, it's soft and flaky due to the fact that the wrap each one in tin foil. I'm personally not a fan of this style, since I don't think it makes the tacos taste any better.\\n\\n*Carnitas: Also not so great. The tough meat didn't break apart. Really dry. \\n\\n*Barbacoa: Super savory with nice heat. My favorite of the four.\\n\\n*Carne Asada: The charbroiled steak came in as a close second. Very tender and juicy. \\n\\n**Horchata: Perfect amount of cinnamon and a little sweet. I could drink this all day.\\n\\nII. SERVICE\\nI didn't go through the drive-through like some other yelpers and ordered inside. The food came out in about ten minutes or so, during a busy night.\\n\\nIII. ATMOSPHERE/ D√âCOR\\nIt's a tiny shack off of Buford Highway, with four marble picnic tables inside and a drive-through. The converted their patio into their outdoor seating by putting up huge screens. They have seats inside the ordering area - which is essentially like six by six feet large - and people just cram in there waiting for their food or to order. It's fine.\\n\\nIV. PRICES\\nMost of the tacos fall under $2, horchata was $3 (for a medium), and their other eats aren't expensive at all. \\n\\nV. OVERALL\\nAlthough super affordable, I am not sure if the food is worth driving out of your way for.

The dish itself is painfully salty though, so unless you are an avid water drinker, this dish might not be for you. \\nThe lamb was tender and tasty. The appetizers and small plates neither offend me nor blow me away. The bar is a great spot for an evening drink. \\nAll that being said, the $20 for $20 (once a month) is a fabulous event I highly recommend trying at least once. $20 (usually comes out to more like $26 with included gratuity and tax) gives you an opportunity to taste the different wines brought in to the event.

We ordered soda, an appetizer, and a large Chicago pizza. We had Megan as our server. She brought us refills on the spot and didn't have that fake friendly personality most waitresses have.

One of my friends had called ahead and made a reservation for 15 of us at 8 pm.  However, we weren't seated until around 8:40ish.  Our large group basically stood awkwardly by the door for about 40 minutes until our tables were ready.  \\n\\nThe hostess, who bears a *slight* resemblance to Kim Kardashian, was nice - but she did not do a great job of estimating how much time it would take for us to be seated.  She kept telling us \\"just a few more minutes\\" when it took a lot longer than that.\\n\\nWhen our group was finally about to be seated, we realized that several more people had arrived than expected.  Unfortunately we couldn't all be seated together, but at least our other friends were seated at another table close by.\\n\\nIt took a WHILE for us to finally be able to order since the place was pretty packed.  After looking through pages and pages of their LONG menu, and being horrified by the names of some of their sushi (\\"Pearl Harbor Shrimp Bomb Sushi\\"...  REALLY?!?!!), I finally decided to order a Katsu California Roll and a Spicy Tuna Tempura Roll.  I thought that these sounded like items that would be hard to mess up.  I was wrong.\\n\\nOur group enjoyed several rounds of Sake Bombs.  It was my first time EVER having Sake Bombs, but I thought it was fun.  The place got pretty loud because there were several other tables getting their Sake Bombs on.\\n\\nAfter what seemed like forever, we finally got our food...\\n\\nKatsu California Roll ($5.95) - According to their menu, this consists of \\"Crab Stick & Avocado Rolled in Sushi Rice, Katsu Fried, and Served with Rusan's Spicy Sauce.\\"  Honestly, this was the worst roll I've ever had.  It just tasted like fried batter.  Soy sauce with wasabi helped a little, but it was pretty terrible.\\n\\nSpicy Tuna Tempura Roll ($5.95) - So this sounds simple enough, right?  \\"Spicy Tuna Rolled in Sushi Rice, Tempura Fried, and Served with Rusan's Spicy Sauce.\\"  Who could mess THIS up?  They could, and did.  It tasted almost identical to the Katsu California Roll - like fried batter.  I couldn't even taste the \\"spicy tuna\\" in it.  I was incredibly disappointed.  I can usually eat a lot, but I needed my friends to help me finish my two rolls.\\n\\nMy friend didn't want his miso soup, so I had that.  It tasted decent enough, but I thought it was kind of odd that there were noodles in it.  I also tried a piece of my friend's Pork Katsu (tonkatsu) with the sauce.  I actually thought this tasted pretty decent, and I am picky about my tonkatsu.  Their fried ice cream also wasn't bad.\\n\\nOverall, Ru San's at Tower Place gets 2 stars from me - for their slow service (they didn't seem to have enough staff for a Friday night) and mediocre food.  But compared to better sushi restaurants, this place is cheap.  I know that cheap isn't always good, but my rolls were pretty bad.  If I ever come back, it will be with a group - and most likely for their Sake Bombs.\\n\\n[Review 024 of 366]"},{"name":"Little Big Burger","address":"1630 E 6th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I ate here for lunch today and loved it.

We are frequent customers here but this was our first time getting the buffet. As usual, the place was very clean and not so crowded. We were seated promptly and were able to place our order right away. For the buffet, the menu is very similar to the regular menu. For the two of us, we ordered Angus rib eye (recommended), Sirloin beef, beef tongue, shrimps, scallops, and assorted mushroom. We found each plate to be decent. The portion is quite large (it's the same as a la carte), so you may have to be careful about not ordering too much. Ice-cream is also included although they ran out of green tea and red bean flavors that day.

My daughter and I cheated and previewed the menu before leaving.. or maybe we prepared our taste buds? \\n\\n  All in all, I cannot place a proper metaphor or quirky description to convey that the: Service was great, the attention to detail was amazing, the comfort and ambiance were the best, and though it seemed crowded you could have a conversation and a smile without being interrupted or interrupting someone. You seemingly forget that you are in a restaurant that is as big as most modern homes 1st floor!\\n\\n First, the Asahi Beer was chilled at a great proper temp, along with the glass that accompanied it. (Details.. I tell you.. make a great meal)\\n\\nThe menu for us:\\nWarm and fresh Miso soup ~ simply great.\\n\\nAvocado Kama Evo ~ Avocado stuffed with smoked mussel and a spicy sauce that was creamy and amazing.\\n\\nBakudan Mussel (Mussel Dynamite) ~ Baked mussels on the half-shell with the spicy sauce..again the sauce was great and the garnishes were balanced for the taste.\\n\\nSushi Regular (Nami Nigiri) ~ my daughter loved the fresh tastes, and the sized portions that were a great meal for her.\\n\\nSouthern Spicy Roll ~ Great tasting sushi rolls in rice paper with a Habanero sauce drizzled over the rolls and on he side for more savoring; all trimmed in fresh jalape√±os.\\n\\nand the last main was.... a Sushi Roll, bathed in Tempura batter fried gently to a crisp outside and delectable inside... truly a contrast of tastes that marry well.\\n\\n~ I must note that I was pleased with all the well sized portions and that they were not dwarfed by frilly garnishes ~\\n\\n  To finish the meal, my daughter loved the Macha (Green Tea ice cream). It was a great palate cleaner that did not taste like ice cream at all. It was light and refreshing, and just when we thought we could not eat anymore, opened our stomachs to more comfort and satisfaction.\\n\\n  The great spicy tastes, light salty caviar, and the perfectly fatty flavor of salmon and tuna all showed that the flavors blend well to meet any of your expectations.\\n\\n  Remember you may pay for the premium items of  your choice, but you can never short change your memory of an unforgettable meal.   \\n\\n For my daughter, she will always remember it (as I enjoyed the smile on her face all night long)\\n  Thank you to the master chefs with their amazing knife skills, the fish monger selections, and the ladies of the wait staff."},{"name":"New China Pearl","address":"288 Mishawum Rd","city":"Woburn","stars":"3","text":"The food is great here and the waiters and waitresses are really friendly.

I opted for Cole Slaw instead of rice but after I saw the Steak Fries I ordered a side (so much for low carb eating ...).  I was happy that the Chardonnay Cream Sauce did not overwhelm the fish - it was light, flavorful, and a perfect complement. \\n\\nBecause the Key Lime Pie was the dessert of the day and, more importantly homemade, we decided to share one.

Not only is it the go-to destination for first dates at BC (ok, maybe #2 after a theme party in the Mods), but Tasca is also a great destination for groups of friends (I had my birthday dinner there with my roommates this past spring).  The tapas menu is great, and offers a wide variety of options for people with different dietary needs. My favorites normally involve a mixture of a tomato sauce, melted cheese, and sausage.  I've never ordered an entree, but the desserts are pretty solid.  One of the highlights of going to  Tasca would have to be the sangria.  Their sangria is some of the best that I have had, and is filled with pieces of apples and oranges. \\n\\nThe general ambiance of Tasca is also very nice.  Romantic aka low lighting works with the paintings that are on some of the walls (think Spain at night with stars in the sky in colors that may or may night glow in the dark) to create a cute atmosphere.  Tasca is also really good about having special events, such as Flamenco guitar and dancers or wine tastings at the restaurant.  If you sign up for their  mailing list, you'll also get  discounts on food and sangria on a semi-regular basis.  Tasca is a restaurant that is skilled at giving their patrons reasons to return again and again.\\n\\nThe only negative aspects of the dining experience at Tasca is that they don't take reservations (you can call ahead), so getting a table there on the weekend can be a little frustrating and time-consuming.  Exacerbating this issue is the fact that there really isn't anywhere for you to go while you wait for a table - the entrance to the restaurant is extremely small, and the bar isn't that large, either.

Our server was assigned to their table. They placed their drink order and appetizer order. I know because we watched as their drinks and appetizers were later delivered. They placed their meal orders as well. At this point I flagged another server and asked when would our drinks and appetizer arrive. She went to our server and pointed towards us. I assume telling him our table needed service. He went to the back and came back with our appetizers. Went to the bar and spoke to the bartender and here came our drinks. We told him we were ready to order and he continued to look at the large group of ladies and in the midst of our order said hold one sec and ran to their table where one of the ladies needed a drink refill which he promptly got for her. When we placed our order I asked would we have to wait 45 minutes for the food as we did for the appetizer. He said no he just forgot about us and laughed. The ladies completed their meal and asked for their checks and began to individually pay. Which again put us on a hold of getting our food as apparently their tickets were not correct. When we got our food I asked for the check and asked for takeout containers which never came. He brought back my card but never the containers. I assume because we were male he felt intimidated and thought he would get a larger tip from the ladies.

Even after asking about our food, only the biscuits and gravy came out. At least five more minutes went by before my eggs benedict was set before me. I was starving and licked the plate clean, but I won't be going back there for a few more months until they figure out timing and service. Frankly, though the server was pleasant, she should have been watching her tables enough to know that we had clearly been overlooked. We shouldn't have had to flag down a different staffer to ask about our food, and our server should have offered an apology, and asked about a soda refill for the hubby, and acknowledged somehow that service wasn't up to par. And Gigi's should cut back its menu options to something it can handle, if that's what it takes. But ignoring and starving your customers is not acceptable.\\n\\nI'm giving them two stars.

When you get inside, there's not a clear hostess \\"podium\\" and it doesn't have that typical restaurant feel to it. It's more or less a big room with a bunch of tables and a bar in it. When we visited for lunch, we were welcomed immediately and prompted to have a seat wherever we wanted. Service was slow after that, though, but it was tolerable, even for a gotta-have-it-now-generation-y like myself. \\n\\nAs much as I hate to say it, both baskets of chips we were served were stale. The salsa was pretty tasty, though, and after a few handfuls of chips it didn't bug me anymore. I'm banking on that being a one-time-occurrence, though. \\n\\nThe Tacos de Carnitas I ordered ($7) were pretty tasty and filling. They could have been a bit more dressed up, but I'm all about simple food that tastes good so they worked for me. The side of garlic rice was delicious.\\n\\nTheir house margaritas don't use any syrups, so you get fresh strawberries for a strawberry margarita, which is a nice touch. For $6, though, it didn't have much tequila in it, or I just like them stronger than most. \\n\\nOverall, if you'd like to taste real Mexican food and not the Cheese Grease Pool of DoomÔøΩ?that Taqueria Arandas served me in place of enchiladas, stop by Sazon for \\"Breakfast, Lunch [or] Dinner\\"."},{"name":"Hill's Cafe","address":"3600 Presidential Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"2","text":"We landed at 7:30 from Orlando and went to get dinner.

Dante's always offer something different everyday of the week.  Monday and Sunday are my favorite night's to attend, one being Sinferno Cabaret on Sunday night and Karaoke from Hell on Monday night.  \\n\\nIf you want a really great experience for Sunday night, arrive early!  That is if you want a seat towards the front so you can see all the action.  I would maybe suggest getting there like at 9-9:30 even if the show starts at 11 PM.  They usually have an act between those times, if not, watching some great cartoons helps kill the time too.    Once the show begins, the magic begins.  Acts range from traditional strip teases, to elaborate and exotic fire dancers.  In between acts, they bring \\"the go go girls\\" that aren't that impressive.  They can't dance that well and they're pretty corny for the most part.  The club has them perform mainly as filler while the next act is set up.  I enjoy the \\"amateur hour\\" they have around 1 AM.  Any female from the audience can go on stage and perform strip teases, this is when the show slows down as not a lot of gals volunteer for the last part.\\n\\nKaraoke from Hell is a great place to sing with a live band.  The leader singer, Tres Shannon is a very nice guy whom I have sang on stage a many occasion in the past  I usually get there by 9-9:30 PM before the show starts at 10.  Sometimes they charge a cover, usually 2 bucks, sometimes they don't.  If you love to sing and sing right away, sign up ASAP.  Tipping is greatly appreciated and the Kabuki lady will provide a copy of the lyrics if you ask.  Tres does call the names by random so don't feel discouraged if you don't get called right away.  Everytime I have performed, I always get a huge round of applause by the audience and hi-fives.  \\n\\nThe food is pretty good, can't complain about the huge chicken strips or their giant slices of pizza.  happy hour is a real steal, $1.50 per slice for cheese and pepperoni.  The entrees are a great deal, get main dish with a choice of a good size salad, fries, or garlic bread.  The fettucini alfredo was great a year ago, but it's been on/off depending who makes it.  The cheesier, the better in my opinion.  A lot of great beer and spirit options too, I prefer getting the drinks at the bar for more prompt service.  The waitress's during the big shows are mediocre, they either come too often or never enough, especially when you want to close your tab.\\n\\nOverall, a great place to chill, people are friendly for the most part, especially when random people ask to join my table if no where else is available."},{"name":"China Palace","address":"6605 Airport Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"This is a decent restaurant with reasonable prices.

I'm not sure if it's the of quality beef, the slathering of sauce or just the tender loving care that's in each hand-formed patty but I have NEVER had to ask GB to cook my burger to any certain doneness. They just do it they way the do it and it's always good. \\n\\nI always order the namesake Original Graffiti Burger when I visit or take out. If my appetite is smaller, I'll get the Jr. GB, which is no compromise on taste. The Original GB is two patties, American cheese, their amazing slaw (that has pepperoncini in it), their special sauce, pickles and tomatoes.

I know some people like them and maybe I'm missing something but I've tried them several times and they just don't do it for me. If you're really craving fries, they'll do, but the times I've had them they never had any crispiness and often have that dreaded \\"gritty potato\\" texture inside. It doesn't matter though, as much as I love fries, they're totally worth foregoing for this awesome burger. Besides, the burgers are a meal themselves.

But the last time we went, we had a horrible experience and will never be back.  We went with our two kiddos (age 1 and 5) on a Sunday morning for breakfast.  The girl behind the counter was on the phone with someone who sounded like they were changing a call-in order, and she was VERY irritated at them.  While we were waiting for her to finish her call, my 5 year old stood by the counter and was looking at the bottom of the tip jar trying to count the coins (there was about $.72 in there.)  She was touching the outside of the tip jar pointing to the coins as she was counting.  Then out of nowhere, the girl on the phone snatched the jar away from my kid (who was just touching it not trying to get anything out) and slammed it on the other side of the counter.  After she finished with my call, I walked up to her and said \\"Don't snatch something away from my child like that.\\"  To which she spat \\"Keep your kid away from my tip jar.\\"  I said \\"She's 5 years old!  She wasn't taking your pitiful little $.72 in tips!\\"  And she said \\"I don't care, keep her the hell away from my tip jar.\\"  \\n\\nReally?  She was just touching it counting the coins waiting for you to finish up your call.  We walked out, unwilling to spend our money at a place where a worker is so rude and unprofessional.  But as I walked to the car, I got more pissed.  And I walked back in and as soon as I did a manager pulled me aside and asked me what had happened.  I told him exactly what happened and he apologized.  He said that the woman in question \\"Had worked there a really long time and was usually very good with customers.\\"  I really didn't care.  If it was \\"against the rules\\" for a child to touch the tip jar, all she had to say was \\"Please don't touch that.\\"  But don't be mean to my child.  The manager asked if there was anything he could do.  And I told him that there wasn't.  So we went down the street to Bacon and had a wonderful breakfast.  I like to patronize local Austin businesses, but it won't ever be Austin Java again."},{"name":"Rolling In Thyme & Dough","address":"333 W Hwy 290","city":"Dripping Springs","stars":"4","text":"Great food!

I work in the area and was craving sushi. Decided to try out their Tuesday buy one get one half off sushi rolls deal. I called ahead and when I arrived to pick up my order I had to wait in line. This is order at the cashier style of restaurant. So waited a good 10 minutes which already defeated the purpose of carryout. I ordered the buckeye and unagi rolls which totaled $16 with the Tuesday deal. First, the buckeye roll had barely any fish. Seriously the tiniest of slivers. The tempura was really weird. It was like the outside of a corn dog. This is not the tempura battered roll I am accustomed to at every other sushi place. There was no crunch. The unagi roll was equally disappointing with the tiniest amount of eel. I am still incredible hungry after spending $16 and consuming 2 speciality rolls. 2 speciality rolls at any other sushi joint is guaranteed to fill the average person.

My only critiques of this dish are that the side of sweet potato fries were slightly soggy, and the sandwich was a bit too heavy on avocado. Since the slices were cut pretty thick, they kept falling out of the sandwich. I however am a pretty big fan of avocado; so all stray ingredients on my plate were consumed.\\n\\nMy friend got the pad thai burrito, which was decent. The taste was good, but it's a flavor I would have gotten bored with after a few bites. I definitely liked the texture and taste that the crunchy slaw added.

Well, for nostalgic reasons, I loved them more when they were a smaller space. Their coffee has always been my favorite, and I was lucky to live nearby for four years and afford a coffee practically every day. I had to stop visiting from 2013-2014 because I decided to stop drinking coffee while I was pregnant and breastfeeding.  That was hard! But I've recently allowed myself a treat now and then and was surprised and disappointed to find that a latte is now $4.21, and only served in 12oz cups. I remember having the option to get a small  (12oz) or large (16oz).  And, for me, $4.21 for a small latte that takes me less than a minute to drink down is too pricey now. What happened to offering options? Only offering small for what the large used to almost cost seems...I don't even know...sneaky? I was bummed. Hence the 4 star rating instead of 5. Did other loyal, longtime customers catch this too?  I understand inflation and prices need to go up to cover expenses and overhead, but at least offer small and large options for the espresso drinks like you always have. The coffee is still amazing. \\n\\n10/30- I stopped by here again with an old friend of mine who used to frequent Diesel with me. We used to read and knit here when before the addition. I ordered a latte and asked if they could upgrade it to a 16 oz for an additional charge, like they did for me a few times before this visit, and the cashier adamantly said no, they can't.

My total was almost 10$, which I found to be really overpriced. The other bakery I frequent, I usually end up paying around the same price for 6-7 baked goods. The actual buns and breads were nothing to rave about- I found them to be mostly dry and without any outstanding flavors. Definitely not worth the price. I will be sticking to my usual bakery.

The ciabatta was good, but it was so tough, our jaw muscles were sore after consuming it! The French onion soup was ok and lacked on the amount of gruyere cheese, and was nothing memorable. The escargot and hanger steak were well seasoned and cooked. I was disappointed by the thicker cut fries and green beans. Frites are typically thinly sliced and haricot verts are thin and have a nice crisp. I enjoyed the apple tart--it reminded me of a fresh pastry from France! \\n\\nThe service reminded me of France with the French speaking staff and the longer wait time between courses.

I got the lamb combo, udon noodles, and spicy Sichuan soup. When you get the combo, you can choose four different types of veggies. I had the feeling the hot pot was not gonna fill me and my gf up so I also ordered shoyu ramen. The server said many people share the hotpot combo and they get full. I look at our portions. It's not that much, sadly. $18.95 for small portions. Not worth it. Might be enough for one person but not two people. We didn't like the spicy Sichuan taste. It was pretty spicy but had this weird taste. Maybe this is how Sichuan taste like in a soup (if you like it, go for it), I don't like it. I'll stick with the stir fry Sichuan flavor for me. I tried to suck it up for the soup but I couldn't. The food didn't taste good for me with it so I asked if I could change it. The manager/owner was nice enough to change it for us. We got the berth broth and sauce on the side. We dump the whole sauce in cuz the broth seem little bit bland. There are sauces that you can dip with your food but not many options. The lamb meat was good but small portion. \\n\\nThe shoyu ramen tastes pretty good. I would get it again. It comes with 3 fish pink-white fish cake and 3 naruto swirl fish cake. \\n\\nThis was a sad dinner cuz we were eating here for my girlfriend's early birthday dinner.

I'd never tried tsukemen before as the prospect of dunking cold sticky noodles into a vat of hot flavorful soup really didn't inspire my taste buds. I wondered how well the noodles would be able to absorb the flavor when they're immersed only for mere seconds. But watching two rotund dudes chowing down on tsukemen really piqued my intrigue. \\n\\nI gotta say, this is some of the best damn ramen I've ever had. And since the noodles aren't bathed in the broth they don't become slimy or stringy. They maintain their perfect taste and texture in tsukemen. I love the springiness of the noodles! I found they were just glutinous enough that every chew was like mana from heaven. The soup itself was damn near perfect! Just the right level of spiciness to tickle one's tongue without setting it afire. I don't know how they do it but the absorption of the soup into the noodles was magnificent. I never needed to slurp the soup to compliment the taste from the noodles, they were coated too nicely. \\n\\nThe wife had some sort of charcoal miso thing which was kinda gimmicky that I didn't really care for. The egg had good flavor and wasn't overcooked, the pork was good with just a hint of sweetness to it which I liked. Basically it's pretty hard to screw up the egg and pork and seaweed so they don't get many points for that stuff. \\n\\nWe also ordered the gyozas which were pretty meh IMHO.

Nobody came by to check on us during our meal, even though the restaurant was nearly empty, and that's typical of this location. \\n\\nSodas are served in small plastic bottles, which is environmentally wasteful and more expensive to the customer who wants refills. No, I'm not a sugar guzzler, but when I go out to eat I sometimes get a drink refill - without spending an extra $3. The only good thing about this place is the veggie burger; everything else is bland and overpriced. Honestly, I will drive to the Short North location from now on just to avoid Beechwold's awful service. Seating is uncomfortable, and don't even think about bringing a baby or stroller; there's no room for it and staff won't try to help. It's going downhill, and I predict that it will lose a lot of business in the next two years."},{"name":"Dragon Wok","address":"145 Harvard Ave","city":"Allston","stars":"3","text":"I would have rather gone to asia wok, the general tso was nasty as hell and the rice had no taste at all. \\n\\new."},{"name":"Yakuza","address":"5411 NE 30th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"I so wish I could give Yakuza more.

The other server, when we called out, would turn around but keep walking away, like \\"You'll have to yell to me as I walk backwards because I'm too busy to stop and find out what you need.\\"  Not very cool.  The nail in the coffin for us was our last order--just 5 hand sushi rolls, but they took more than 40 minutes to get.  I thought they had been forgotten, but after they came out, then came the dessert that we had ordered at the same time ... were they all forgotten and then remembered, or did it really take 40 minutes to make a few hand rolls?

It displayed its seasoned colors last Friday as three friends and I descended upon the establishment to catch up and share a few laughs. Franks is a place out of central casting from Hollywood. The typical small town corner store where everyone knows each other like some extended high school reunion. Local legend has given the restaurant rave reviews over the years as being the best steakhouse located outside of the city.  \\n\\nKnow this, you'll need to fight for a parking space on Mass Ave. Dennis D is a minute ahead of me and I drive by him backing into the only close space available.  I finally find a spot a quarter mile away and after a 5 minute walk, I enter Frank's and notice patrons playing keno and intently staring at television sets like they're watching the first moon landing. Eight foot ceilings give the restaurant a rural feel. Stacked two deep at the bar and almost all the tables filled to capacity, give the best review an owner or a newbie could ask for. However, between employees and customers, there aren't 10 people in the place who are under 50 years old. We'll see how many people are left after the early bird special clientele exit. In addition, I feel like I just walked into a commercial for drab Kohl's clothes.  I haven't seen this many people walk around wearing old refurbished drapes and bed sheets since my grandmothers 90 birthday. Besides the poorly dressed staff and clientele, low end rugs, plates, glasses and napkins round out my first impressions as we make our way to bar for a quick cocktail.\\n\\nThe bar scene quickly engulfs us. An unknown guy to our right quickly sparks up a conversation over Mike G's crown and ginger order. There's a guy playing a piano to our right, but we notice he plays the same song for the entire duration of our time there. One bartender serving the whole crowd moves to slowly and takes close to 10 minutes to get to everyone's order. Drinks are strong, albeit a little small, and come just in time for some who started to worry they may die of thirst. Mike G, who arrived 30 minutes early, sets the pace with a 4 drink, 2 cheeseburger lead and introduces us to his new friends met a half hour earlier.  \\n\\nOne of the ubiquitous 60 year old waitresses soon comes over and lets us know our table is ready. Table space is fine and drinks refreshed, talking is reduced to a low hum as the hungry party peruses the menus. The troop, used to meeting at high end steakhouses in Boston, quickly realizes the price and size reduction of steaks available. The loin special on the menu is Big Franks 18oz sirloin... in the big leagues; this would merely be considered a petite filet. The wine list is extremely friendly with solid bottles of Beranger and JLohr priced less than $24 a bottle. Delicious looking dishes pass by to other tables that keep spirits up.\\n\\nDinner started with an uninspiring small town salad.... then Frank stopped playing around and started to backup the great reputation. The clam chowder is excellent as it's perfectly creamy and thick. Warm bread served to the table is asked to be refreshed after the first loaf doesn't survive 10 minutes.  Big Franks 18oz comes up next and it's awesome.  Frank charred the top, but the middle is nicely red...  The sizzling steak is tender and juicy....and done just right. It doesn't belong in the big leagues, but for what you're paying you're more then satisfied. If nothing else had gone well for the rest of the evening, the steak would have been worth the trip.  However, the mashed potatoes finish off a 1, 2 punch and put this steakhouse on the map.  Baby carrots are served with a hint of maple syrup and come in a little soggy... but at this point... who cares, I'm still in steak heaven. Drinks are depleted halfway through dinner and they aren't refreshed until well after the meal is done. The slow service can't hold the compliments back for the dynamite dinner the patrons just completed.  \\n\\nDessert menus are handed out and turned in quickly. With brownie Sundays all around the group of 37 year old men act like children as the youths dive into mounds of cool whip and ice cream... and avoid the dry brownie.\\n\\nNearing the end of the night the bill arrives. This group of once heavy hitters, used to spending upwards of $125 a night each on dinner, is pleasantly surprised to find the total for the table is less than $150. \\n\\nIn the end, Franks Steakhouse proved its reputation correct as the best meal the minor leagues can muster. It's not a \\"Babe Ruth\\" steakhouse..... but a \\"Bull Durham\\" dinner and for diners who want to avoid the big city and big bill, this restaurant provides the greatest deal for the dollar this side of the Charles River.\\n\\nTotal Grade:  B  \\n  Service: D\\n  Ambiance: C+ \\n  Extras: B-\\n  Steak: B\\n  Price: A+"},{"name":"Toji Korean Grill House","address":"4615 SE Hawthorne Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Not bad. the dukboki was delicious!

Edamame is good if you're in the area and want sushi, but it's not a place I would make a special trip to Easton for. \\n\\nThe rolls we had were fairly priced and good sized. We usually get 5 rolls to split between the two of us and then maybe some sashimi and of course, I always get miso soup. Again, all of that was just fine here, but not much stood out.

That being said, it breaks my heart that I can only give it a 3 star rating after my recent experience there, nearly 2 years after my original departure from the city.  I'm still trying to pinpoint exactly what it was that made this experience so drastically different from the others I've had there, but I can only arrive at the fact that it was likely a combination of both mediocre customer service and sushi.\\n\\nI arrived with a couple of friends on a Friday night without so much as a 5 minute wait, which was fantastic.  We initially asked for a table on the patio but when it started storming, we asked if we could please be moved inside.  The look from the waitress carrying 3 glasses of water on her tray was enough to turn someone to stone and I seriously considered mentioning that to her as we were led inside by the kind hostess.  Our waiter was nice but seemed to be in a big hurry despite the fact that I've seen this place much busier than it was that Friday evening.  I do have to say, however, that he went to extra lengths to make our dining experience pleasurable, answering all of our questions and also requesting from the chef, the preparation of a dish that was not a regular on their menu, but the best thing that I ate there that evening.\\n\\nI was a bit disappointed in the taste of the sushi.  The crunching buckeye roll, one of my former favorites, lacked its usual flare and the spicy scallop hand roll was not spicy at all...in fact, it lacked flavor completely.  One of my friends ordered the calamari salad which, at the risk of sounding completely uncultured, tasted like \\"dirt.\\"  The blend of spices/herbs covering a heap of calamari, shredded carrots, and sliced onions appeared like something I could have concocted in my own kitchen and had a texture comparable to sand.  The highlight of the evening was a calamari appetizer that consisted of very lightly fried pieces of calamari tossed in a blend of herbs, spices, jalapeno peppers, and sweet onions.

Lunch is served until 4:00 PM and Dinner until close. Over the years, we have got know the owners and waite staff who always greet us with friendly conversation and make us feel like family.\\n\\nWe were seated upstairs, in a booth near the fireplace. This is a quiet intimate area for small groups. There is also seating for larger groups in the solarium or private dining room. The waitress gave us menus and quickly returned with our drink orders. She also served hot rolls with olive oil for dipping. We ordered Dinner off the Early Bird Menu available until 4:00 PM, Tuesday through Thursday.  For $12.95 you get a full course entr√©e with soup or salad. \\n\\nI had the Chicken, Broccoli & Penne which is to die for. It is saut√©ed in a white wine sauce with garlic and butter. The chicken is tender and the broccoli al dente. Although it was the special, there was enough for me to take home for another meal. My wife had the Veal Parmesan in a red sauce over angel pasta.

When this restaurant opened ca. 1994 it was a huge shot in the arm for Austin's Italian food offerings:  the place was a close copy of the original Houston location on Kirby Drive which is still--so I'm told--a good Italian restaurant.  At the time Johnny Carrabba owned it along with Damian Mandola, and Carrabba's reflected their depth and expertise in the art of cooking Italian food.  The original menu featured a huge bone-in veal chop, butterflied chicken breast dishes as good as a steak, shrimp as big as your hand, a wonderful marinara which you want to drink from a cup (like Mario Batali drinks his), and pasta which was always prepared al dente, the way it invariably is in Italy.\\n\\nThe al dente pasta lasted about two months before they received enough complaints from 'mom & pop' to overcook the pasta, the way it is usually served in the US.  And even though Carrabba's started from a high place in the then-short list of Italian places in Austin, it has slowly and steadily declined.  The veal chop disappeared pretty quickly.  In the beginning they served a nice loaf of ambrosial Italian bread steaming from the oven, accompanied by a whole stick of butter--you had to sit on both hands not to devour the entire thing before dinner.  This was eventually replaced by half a loaf of ersatz stuff nothing like the original, and the butter disappeared.  Eggplant Parmesan disappeared from the menu along with many other of the authentic Italian dishes, one by one.\\n\\nThis transmogrification from the original concept to what 'Carrabba's' is now was accelerated when the owners sold it to some corporation.  Now Carrabba's is competing with the likes of the Olive Garden and consequently it becomes more and more like that place with every visit.  They have added dishes like 'Chianti chicken' that have nothing whatsoever to do with anything that would ever be sold in Italy.  And this brings me to the sad reason for this review:  their mussels.\\n\\nThe mussels steamed in a white wine garlic butter sauce used to be one of the best shellfish dishes in any restaurant in Austin, rich and redolent with lots of garlic steaming from the plate.  I used to order a side of plain spaghetti (al dente!) to go simply with the mussels.  Tonight (Friday, July 9, 2016) I ordered the mussels, and although the shellfish themselves were in pretty good condition, the underlying 'white wine garlic sauce' was vile, with most of the butter replaced with something that savored of a cheap dessert wine--the controlling note was SUGAR.  It's a trend in American restaurants to replace fats in their featured dishes with sugar, where sugar is a staple, not a condiment.  The dish was disgusting, and it was no fault of the staff there at the restaurant but rather of the corporate HQ who had made the decision to disfigure this classic dish in this unhealthful way.  But sugar sells, Italian food be damned.\\n\\nOne by one the classic Italian dishes at the old Carrabba's have been replaced by some corporate 'vision' of what will sell better, or at least more cheaply to their customers.  It has become a hollowed-out parody of the original store on Kirby Drive, and the restaurant now has almost nothing to do with real Italian food.  So far as I can tell they still serve the excellent Caesar dressing formulated by Damian Mandola with their Caesar salad, but how long will that last?  I feel sorry for Johnny Carrabba for the times when he drives by one of these namesake offshoots and sees his name on the marquee, but I really feel sorry for the ancestral portraits of the original family who still look down from the walls at what Carrabba's has become:  not an Italian bone in its body.\\n\\nIf you want authentic, inexpensive Italian food in Austin which is the most like what you would get in The Boot itself, your best bet is Mandola's Italian Market:  Italian food is alive and well at Mr. Mandola's restaurants.  (I am an attorney in Austin and have no connection whatsoever with the restaurant except to be a regular customer there.)

Just enough crisp in the bread to have the perfect texture, but not too crunchy, as once you broke the crispy exterior, it was yummy moist focaccia. The ONLY thing i could see that could have been better was to put the egg BELOW the prosciutto, like a baby under a prosciutto blanket so that the oozing egg yolk will be trapped in the bread when you cut. but really, that's just details. (and i just realized i made it sound like I am killing a baby in its bed, but it's a delicious baby with yummny yolk brain... braaaaainzzzz!).\\n\\nThe Shooting Star drink was quite good and refreshing, balancing out the tang of orange, with the sweetness of carrot and a slight hint of ginger. well played Northstar, well played.\\n\\nThe Summer Vegetable Strada was also very good, we got the last piece and it really is like a quiche looking thing and cut like lasagna, but tasted like a healthy party in my mouth.  Spot on! The vegetables were fresh and the gouda was perfect and complementary, not 'in your face'.\\n\\nBoth dishes came with a side salad that provided a break from the yumminess with a light balsamic vinegar dressing over baby greens. \\n\\nOverall this place takes the cake so far in Columbus.

And the amount of emails from them just was too much to handle. Another occasion I dined at this restaurant, we had to wait forever for a table. About an hour and a half. There were five of us in the party, but they sat us in a four person booth so the fifth person had to sit on the chair that stuck out. So, every person who walked by would have to squeeze by or my friend would have to move and adjust her chair. And, she's a 5'2, 110 pound asian girl! You can imagine how big she is huh. Any way, it took about 15 minutes before our water came and the waiter decided to acknowledge us. He seemed bored and not friendly. Ew. The food was ok.

Authentic ethnic restaurants can easily shoot to extremes. Either they will only attract a small niche group of consumers or they will spread like wildfire within an area. This mostly relies on their food and K-Bop does well to deliver.\\n\\nThe Food\\nAuthentic Korean food. I'd even recommend picky eaters to try it and to form an opinion. I believed that it was good, but hey, you don't have to like everything that's good or hate everything that's bad. That being said, I enjoyed the food but also realize it caters to an Asian taste. Great if you like authentic Asian food.\\n\\nThe Price\\nRegular prices for small portions. I was still hungry after finishing the beef bulgolgi, one of the more expensive items.\\n\\nThe Restaurant \\nWith the resources available, K-Bop manages but does not excel. It has a great location on the drag, making it a popular place for Asian students. The speed is decent but you can't expect too much with their popularity. By no means does popularity = quality, but K-Bop does fine to accommodate. However, I'm not a fan of the cramped cafeteria like seating and the constant flow of people. I do appreciate the fact that K-Bop knows it's objective and doesn't try to become something it's not.\\n\\nOverall\\nI liked the experience of eating here, but it's not some place I'd regularly attend. You won't get much bang for your buck and I definitely don't recommend it for the claustrophobic."},{"name":"Stauf's Coffee Roasters","address":"1277 Grandview Ave","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Atmosphere- I think the cafe area is due for a refresh.

Complimentary valet is a nice touch.  Had a reservation for 8:30pm but probably wasn't seated until about 9pm.  The upstairs bar was booming though, so we joined the crowd and enjoyed a pre-dinner drink.  The aesthetic appeal of this location, as many people know, is fantastic.  And I think it will be a fabulous place to grab drinks outside once the weather becomes a bit more consistent (they don't have heat lamps available at the moment).  The hostesses and our waitress were all very friendly, and the food was ok.  My biggest complaint, and the reason I couldn't allot more stars, is that I think the food quality doesn't justify the high prices.  As a general rule, I'm happy to pay a little more for ambiance and great food, but I was a little disappointed on that count here. \\n\\nOn the other hand, my dining companion, who was visiting from Boston, would probably have given this place 4 or 5 stars.

My husband loves their quesadillas and their tacos. However- this particular location is VERY spotty on service and food quality. Sometimes we will get a 5 star meal, other times, a 2 star meal with really crappy service. \\n\\nWe almost always go through the drive thru, which regularly takes forever, in a very poorly laid out parking lot, where if you try to do the right thing, and back up to create a line that goes into the back parking lot, rather than wraps around the building (blocking people from parking if they enter off of Buford Hwy), you will more than likely end up with an angry person thinking that they were there first. We literally had a guy yelling at us, even though we had been there for 3 minutes before he arrived. I highly suggest going inside to order, and not just because of the parking lot situation. (but always order take out, because the only seating is on an enclosed patio, and it's pretty dirty feeling... I've honestly chosen to eat in the car over eating on their patio)\\n\\nI have a raw onion allergy (apparently it has to do with sulfites), and every time we go here, I tell them (in spanish) that I have an onion allergy, and no pico or onions on my meal. 50% of the time, it comes out with onions... then other times, they forget a taco, then next time, there won't be the drink we ordered. \\n\\nLast time we went, after I sent back my nachos, telling them that I have an onion allergy and cannot eat what they gave me, they literally just took the onions off and added more sour cream. Not only no, but hell no. You CANNOT do that to someone with a food allergy- that is dangerous. Thankfully my allergy is less dangerous and more like my throat and face swell up, and I'll be itchy for days... but you don't do that. This is why I suggest going inside... So that you can check, double check, and triple check your order. \\n\\nAside from all that- their carne asada and lengua tacos are my husband's favorites... They're fresh, authentic, and cheap. Their salsas are delicious (and ultra spicy), and I LOVE their nachos (their chips are magical- crispy with that incredible toasted corn flavor). Sometimes their meats are overcooked, sometimes they are great... It's a bit like playing Russian Roulette if I am being honest.\\n\\nAll of that being said- I prefer the Taco Veloz on Roswell Road over this one due to personnel and quality... but if you're on this side of town, and the Buford Farmer's Market is closed (their food court tacos are reliably good and I choose them over Taco Veloz every time), this is your best bet at good tacos."},{"name":"Toasted","address":"1945 Aloma Ave","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4","text":"Grilled cheese adult style.

I have often enjoyed this restaurant but my experience last night was exceptional. I had a bottle of wine that was questionable and I wanted assistance in case it was off. I do not like to waste and I am lucky enough to be able to afford to eat out regularly. The wine was Joie Chardonnay, a wonderful BC wine. The cork had a wet smell and we thought it tasted a bit off but I had only once drank the wine and my friend never. Ben came over and was helpful. He offerred to immediately replace the wine, no questions asked. We wanted his professional opinion before we did though and so he gave us a wonderful wine tasting lesson and then later my server Brian said Ben had even had him do the same. We learned plus we enjoyed a new bottle. But it does not stop there. My friend and I were deeply engaged in conversation the whole night. Brian was there, never intrusive, yet always ready to serve.  He has an innate ability to read the situation and really helped us enjoy our evening. He was always a pleasure, very genuine and helpful. He cared that we enjoyed our food and atmosphere. It was above and beyond and as a result we had an excellent evening. And to top it all off they gave us the bottle complimentary.
