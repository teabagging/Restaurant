And what a beautiful space it is. A sad reminder of all the businesses hit hard by the economic downturn. But, West Linn has been coming back. We've seen a number of new restaurants open in the last year at both the high end (Allium) and low end (Biscuits) of the dining spectrum. \\n\\nAnd now the latest location of Portland's Typhoon! chain has opened in the West Linn Central Village. They kept the best and most unique things about the space. The tree at the entrance and the large circular fire pit at the back. The rest has been redesigned to replace the southwest decor (cowhide booths) of the prior tenant with upscale Asian touches and it is beautiful.\\n\\nThe original Typhoon! on NW 23rd was one of the first restaurants I remember visiting in Portland way back in 1996 close to when they opened. What set them apart then, as it does now, from many other Thai restaurants is their large tea menu. \\n\\nIn the present day, what is most notable is the small serving size and the high price compared to other restaurants in the area. They are going for a high end experience in a high end suburb and I think they'll do fine. Not so much with families, because it can get painfully expensive really quick, but with people looking for a nice spot to have a business lunch or dinner.\\n\\nPart of the expense is that we tend to order more here because there are better options. In addition to the tea menu, they serve cocktails and strawberry or raspberry lemonade for the kids. But overall, our dinner here was two times what we normally pay for a Thai dinner at another local place. Ouch.\\n\\nThe food quality is quite good and overall we've been happy. Nothing that we are mooning over, but we have been satisfied. It is a place where everyone in the family can happily eat, but as Mr. K said, \\"I'm left wanting more.\\" The best item we ordered at our first dinner visit were the spicy green beans. We didn't particularly care for the drunken noodles. On our second visit for lunch, the prices weren't as painful and we enjoyed several curries.\\n\\nOverall a positive experience, but I think they are going to have a fairly narrow customer base because even in West Linn, we weigh quality, quantity and overall value. So far our service has been excellent. I suspect some very specific training takes place with their employees and it is almost painfully polite and formal. \\n\\nI started this review with part of a traditional Buddhist blessing and healing chant because we witnessed a ceremony yesterday in the restaurant. I don't know if this was the particular chant the monks used to bless this new venture, but it seemed appropriate. The doors are open, the restaurant has been blessed, we will see if the customers come."},{"name":"Guac y Margys","address":"661 Auburn Ave NE, Ste 120","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Service- excellent\\nLocationRight onto the Beltline so excellent \\nTaco- freshly made daily with local ingredientsx so varieties vary.

I do agree that the view onto the water cant be replicated anywhere as I sat by the window and enjoyed the view.  \\n\\nWe got reservations online easily and even on a Sunday afternoon, you do need it.  There is a constant flow of people trying to get a late lunch spot on the weekend.  We overheard the wait being at least 40 minutes for a larger table.  Getting a rez would be a good thing to do even if you think a 2 pm slot would be slow... it isnt!\\n\\nJust a warning about getting here... parking is just awful.  Terrifyingly bad.  Expect 15 to 20 minute of roaming around to find a spot on the weekend and if you think you could sneak in on a spot that isn't quite legal, forget it.  There is tons of parking enforcement handing out tickets.  It could really dampen your overall Deep Cove experience if you werent warned or expecting this.  \\n\\nService here is ... ok.  It works mostly.  They're not bad but it feels like they're just going through the motions and that they would like to be any where but there.  It's not unattentive but it looks quite bored.  Perhaps it was a long weekend for work but at try to be attentive.  Menu reads like a typical bistro with a price point that seems reasonable till you see the dishes in front of you.  \\n\\nBaby Kale Salad with addition of chicken - At $20, there's hope that a salad is plentiful or filled with really good ingredients.  This was literally just as described... baby kale with a few slivers of fennel and pickled onions.  And the portion size is what Vancouver would call a side salad instead of a meal sized.  The chicken was a bit dry and bland.  Overall, it's just a small and bland salad for $20.  3/5\\n\\nBeet salad with tomatoes - Though it looked a lot prettier with the shades, this was possibly even smaller than the kale salad.  At least it had a few more interesting sprigs of greens on it.  It was very boring ... sure we ordered wrong but these should not be on any menus for the price points. These are side dishes that should be much less.  3/5\\n\\nFried green beans - These were laughably bad... oil laden, heavy, and maybe 20 fried green beans for $8.  I ordered this because I was told these were delicious.  Absolutely not...  it was so hard to eat because they didnt even take off the stems which was fried to a bark texture.  2/5\\n\\nI dont want to call this place a tourist trap.

The restaurant is split between a bar with open space for waiting reservations and the dining area, where in the corner you will hear live music.\\n\\nfood: \\n+ BEIGNETS: I was very hesitant to get this appetizer because I haven't had a good beignet in Boston, but these are worth it! At $5, you get five beignets dusted in powdered sugar. The outside doesn't look amazing, but once you bite into it, you get a doughy and moist texture that almost makes it feel like there is cream inside. It's that soft! They are not overly fried or sweet, so they are the perfect starter.\\n\\n+ DIRTY BIRD: This is what they're famous for, so we had to try it. Fried chicken, bacon, and fried egg sandwiched between buttermilk biscuits and swimming in a sausage gravy, this sounds like a heart attack. But it really wasn't too heavy and didn't make us hate ourselves after. The sandwich is small enough that it is the perfect size, and the gravy accompanies the sandwich so that you can really add as much as you need to each bite. The fried chicken was perfectly breaded, not too heavy, and the biscuits were super crunchy so that it didn't get soggy after you ate it with the gravy.\\n\\n+ BUTTERMILK PANCAKES: This dish is enormous. It comes with 3 pancakes, but each pancake is the size of my entire head. They are crunchy along the edges, but soft in the middle. They have perfected these pancakes!\\n\\nTheir orange juice really is freshly squeezed (this is a huge deal for me). Therefore, there is pulp in their OJ. If you aren't okay with this, don't order it. The MIMOSAS were so good!! I loved the pulp at the bottom of my glass when I had my last sip.\\n\\ntips:\\n* No reservations available. First come, first serve. If you see a line out the door, this is simply the line to put your name down at the hostess stand.\\n* Come to the restaurant around 10:30 AM to be in the first wave of seating for weekend brunch. Otherwise, you are looking at a 1 hour wait after 11:00 AM. \\n* Groups of 4 are better accommodated over groups of 2, since there are more four-top tables throughout the dining area. \\n\\nService was amazing. Once we were seated, we were out within 30-40 minutes. They were sure to refill our waters, see if we wanted a refill on our OJ, and cleared our table within seconds of finishing."},{"name":"Eat Me Thai","address":"6364 Fraser Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"This place was closed the first time I came despite the sign, but I'm glad I tried again.

The sliders were by far our favorite--so juicy, flavorful, and different than your typical sliders. The hot chicken was so tender you didn't even need a knife to cut through it! They were also juicy and crispy with a little spice, but not super spicy (although I have a high spice tolerance so the average person might find them pretty spicy). The shrimp pancakes were surprisingly crisp, but not heavy even though they were deep-fried. Must squeeze the lemon over them it really brings out the flavors!

We have been coming at least once a week, usually twice a week. Service has always been lacking, however. Often times we would sit for 10-15min trying to get someone's attention to take our order, but the servers seem to have tunnel vision and speed by the tables. Despite this, we put up with their shortcomings.

We ordered a hot drink to go with our meal, but a cold drink came (after it went to the table next to us by mistake). We said to the owner/waitress that we ordered a hot drink, not cold. She hesitated and didn't say anything, giving us the impression that she didn't want to correct it. So to keep things friendly, we offered to keep the cold drink so it doesn't go to waste. Upon paying for the bill, we noticed they had charged us an extra $1 for the cold drink. We politely mentioned to them that this was their mistake and we had told the owner about it. The owner came back saying we should have asked her to change it back to a hot drink. If that is how they do business, then fair enough. But what followed was the owner's son giving us attitude that we were so petty to fight over $1, and he even shook his head at us and reluctantly deducted it off our bill. I can care less about the money, but my principle is that we shouldn't be expected to pay for their mistake that they did NOT offer to correct.\\n\\nDuring another visit, a table next to us had ordered a white sauce pasta. What then happened was the owner bringing a plate of egg & shrimp on rice to them saying, \\"we made egg & shrimp on rice instead, is it OK?\\". The customer then said he doesn't eat shrimp, so the owner didn't say a word and just turned away and walked back to the kitchen.

When I got there, I walked inside to pay. The guy behind the counter greeted me, but it wasn't until the guy on the barbecue stepped inside that I paid for and received my food. When he handed me my food, he told me that there was a woman in line as I was placing my order that also wanted a Char Su Bao, so he sold it to her, but then commented that it was good that I called in my order.

Today was one of those days.  \\n\\nI was supposed to be in Seattle today, but a rockslide across Snoqualmie Pass and I-90 last night diverted me back to Portland from the Tri-Cities.  But that's fine because it allowed me to enjoy a 4 stars plus lunch today at Accanto.  So many aspects of Accanto are outstanding.  I loved the modern Italian design and the varying sizes of finished wood strips that partially concealed the ceiling joists.   \\n\\nI started out with a cup of drip coffee.  Served in a traditional cup on a saucer, the coffee was exceptionally delicious with a fleeting hint of hazelnut.  Drunk with cream, the coffee was perfect.\\n\\nI went with the \\"Menu Fisso.\\"  This is a great bargain where you can get a sandwich, soup or salad and cookie for $12.  I requested the soup of the day and the Cattail Creek Lamb Sandwich.  \\n\\nThe soup of the day was wonderful.  Flavored with olive, it contained kale, celery leaves, potato and rice.  The bowl was more than decent sized.\\n\\nAt this point, since service had been very good, I thought Accanto was a shoe-in for five stars.  But the lamb sandwich was just three stars.  It came with extra-good potato chips and marinated carrot sticks and slender onion slices (or was that fennel?) .  But what put me off before I even sampled the sandwich was the overabundance of a chopped greenish seasoning that had been blended with the lamb.  Not attractive.\\n\\nI believe the seasoning was oregano and because there was so much, it overwhelmed the lamb and bread.  The oily dipping sauce had the same flavors as the oregano-ey meat.\\n\\nMy cookie was an excellent snickerdoodle.  It had a perfect soft/crispy texture and balanced cinnamon flavor.  It was pretty big.  Hint:  for maximum enjoyment, dunk the cookie in your coffee.  That is so good!!!\\n\\nOne last note - since there was just one waitress and one chef manning the restaurant, it took a while for my dish to be made and brought out.  So beware if you are in a hurry."},{"name":"The Manchester Arms","address":"1705 Virginia Ave","city":"College Park","stars":"4","text":"Great outside area for dining!

I came here for the first time about a month ago. On my first visit, the cashier lady suggested I try the \\"Medium\\" level of hotness because she said that it was already quite hot. I took her suggestion, and their \\"Medium\\" was way hotter than hot, spicy chicken from all other mainstream chicken places like KFC and Churches. \\n\\nA week later, I tried their \\"Hot\\", and it was very fiery. It wasn't painfully hot, but you felt it as a mild, stinging sensation in your palate. \\n\\nIt wasn't until another week passed by and I tried the \\"Extra Hot\\" which was painfully hot. I had to drink milk, and it was painful going down......and coming out the next day. You might be thinking....TMI. \\n\\nAnyways, this week, I pumped myself up and ordered their \\"Side of Milk\\" level of hotness. Perhaps my body had gotten aclimitized to the hotness, or maybe the previous occasions had permanently damaged my taste buds beyond repair, but I found it tolerable. Yes, it hurt going down. Yes, it felt like I had a swarm of hornets in my mouth. Yes, it felt like I was drinking bear repellent or mace. But, after about 10 minutes, the searing pain subsided. I had to drink several glasses of milk, like in previous weeks. But, I didn't suffer from cramps and the \\"ring of fire\\" like I did a few weeks ago when I had the merely \\"Extra Hot\\". \\n\\nTalking to the staff, I learned that the \\"Side of Milk\\" level of hotness is due to the use of Carolina Reaper Peppers. The other levels of hotness only use weaker peppers like Habaneros or Ghost Peppers. \\n\\nI suggest that you try the lower levels of hotness and work your way up like I did. My favorite Downlow Chicken is actually their Jamaican Jerk which is not so much hot as it is spicy and flavourful. \\n\\nThis place is now my favorite fried chicken place now.

I decided to drop in on a Saturday evening, which may not be the best idea, but I usually find I'm safe since I'm alone and tend to just snag a seat at the bar. Not the case here... there are only 4 seats at the bar, so keep that in mind. Reservation is recommended because it is tight and intimate inside and there is ultimately no where to wait where you aren't blocking the front door, which the servers use constantly to access patio diners. It's a tough wait outside with the heat/humidity, even in the evening. You're probably looking cute when you arrive, and you'll feel much less than cute by the time you sit. I hope I made my point.\\n\\nI stalked the bar and snagged a seat as soon as one opened. I started off with an Amalfi cocktail- limoncello, cucumber vodka, lemon, and mint- and it was tasty. Service was really on point, and I was set up with warm bread and olive oil in no time. I ended up with the arugula salad, and per all you Yelpers suggestion, the sausage/apple ravioli. Salad was nice, and the ravioli were good... but a little dry inside. The brown butter sauce on them was delicious and really brought all the flavors together, I just wish there was a little more of it for a moister (is that a word? Haha) bite. I finished with the creme br√ªl√©e. I have to say it wasn't my favorite, it was especially thick and not smooth. The bartender agreed it didn't look quite right and apologized, quickly offering to do another dessert to-go instead. It appears the creme br√ªl√©e is fairly popular there, so this was likely just a fluke. I'd return if in the area again to try other dishes.\\n\\nI have to say what *really* stood out here was how everyone working really hustled during the peak of busyness and worked together to support one another. Servers did not hesitate to check in on me and make conversation even though I was not \\"theirs,\\" the bartender took drinks to guest tables if the server was tied up, sometimes both pitched in to get something out quicker... pleases, thank yous, smiles... communication was great. I imagine it would be far too easy to just get frustrated instead, so it was impressive. I thought it was really nice that they even took a moment to thank one of the hostesses for coming in to work that evening and brought out a small cake to celebrate her birthday and sing to her. \\n\\nThe small things make a difference, even if everything isn't perfect.

First experience is love at first sight, wondering why I have never seen them around town. Second is deep love and admiration. And third is discontent and boredom.

It seems like a great place to work, since the staff is always positive and helpful. \\n\\nThe happy hour at Swifts is one of the best in town.

However, the New Yorker in me was deeply saddened and bored by the New Yorker board- the super dry pastrami and corned beef were not seasoned well and the rye did not have the proper rye oomph to it and tasted stale.

Williams Street in the formerly-cursed Nutshell and Anju space, Tasty and Sons is the brainchild of Toro Bravo's John Gorham. Already a member of Portland's chef elite, Gorham has expanded his empire from the always-packed tapas spot on Russell to this new brunch (9am to 3pm) endeavor just around the corner. Bringing with him his signature shared-plate style and open-kitchen panache, John has opened up a new world of flavor with what could easily be a Toro Bravo breakfast. \\n\\nThe menu is not as extensive as your average brunch spot, but the offerings are diverse, delicious, and carefully crafted. The small plates section includes offerings such as a breakfast board, patatas bravas, and similar. I sampled the maple-glazed yams. Served with a hint of fragrant spice, these perfectly-cooked and carefully glazed pillows of heaven might as well have been candy made from the earth itself. Fantastic. Hilary B and I just ate in silence, drawing looks of pleasure from each other through half-closed eyes heavy with bliss. Utterly fantastic, and nothing like I've ever had for breakfast before.\\n\\nFrom the larger plate menu (including items like a boudin blanc omelet, an African sausage with fried egg and cous cous, pork cutlets, and similar), we sampled an asparagus, nettle, olive and fromage blanc fritatta, and a dish called shakshuka, which is a cassoulet filled with a tomato, onion and pepper stew then baked with 2 eggs on top and served with some fresh, thick cut grilled bread. The fritatta was served in the hot cast-iron skillet in which it was cooked, and the shakshuka was served up in the hot cassoulet, each with a spoon for dishing up shared portions to waiting taster plates. \\n\\nBoth the fritatta and shakshuka were simply divine. The fritatta was a great combination of nettle and asparagus with a nice fromage blanc and caramelized onions. The olives were a tad overpowering but added a distinct zing to the overall combination. The shakshuka literally took my breath away. It was the exact flavor I look for when making a nice, thick marinara/gravy, with the added creaminess of baked egg on top. Once again, we were lost in a zoned out moment of sheer joy while consuming these treasures. \\n\\nWhile desserts such as a fresh baked chocolate cookie (to order) or a Ristretto Roasters espresso panna cotta with amarena cherries sounded delectable, we were simply too full to indulge. And of course, had it been a weekend, a tasty cocktail would have been in order. However with a green tea, a coffee, and the aforementioned dishes, we escaped for a mere $25. \\n\\nThe space is large and open - longer than it is wide, with a kitchen running most of the length, tables positioned opposite, and an open bar area with communal table up front. Both spartan and welcoming (with reclaimed wood fixtures, dark wood tables, and dark booths offsetting the white walls and concrete floors), it's truly elegant in its simplicty. \\n\\nThey're still in progress of working out the kinks, as they haven't even had their official grand opening yet. For now, it's Tuesday through Saturday, 9am to 3pm. Starting soon, they will be officially open, and Sundays will be in play. Until then, this is your chance to slide in and see what a truly talented chef is doing with a meal he's otherwise not accustomed to making.

As a Haitian American, this is obviously the food I grew up on. This is the cuisine both my mom and mother-in-law cook when I go back home; even wifey throws it down. So when a Haitian restaurant opens up and yelp nation has given it near perfect reviews up to this point, my culinary senses are tingling. \\n\\nIn the short time I've lived in the area, I can tell you that Massachusetts does not do Haitian food justice, period. Miami? Yep. NYC? Yep. Mass? Not so much. This skepticism has held me from visiting Pikliz, until now of course. Time to make the leap! \\n\\nThe good: \\nThe food is beyond reproach! Pikliz has nailed every single dish. Perfectly seasoned, authentic dishes, and ginormous portions sold for probably a 3rd of the price of what they should be. The black rice(the best version of rice this side of the universe lol) is one of the best I've ever tasted. Hands down the best Haitian food I've had in Boston/Malden/Somerville/mattapan. \\n\\nThe not so good:\\nIt really pains me to go here. Now there is a stigma about Haitian restaurants: the customer service sucks and the menu too often is inconsistent. Is this generally true? Yes, yes it is. I've probably visited 25 or so Haitian establishments in my lifetime and these things are just to be accepted. It's completely normal, as sad as it sounds. This even crosses borders as the same traits can be found in Haitian restaurants in Canada or even France. I for some reason thought Pikliz would rise above the unfortunate norm, but it is not the case. Half of the menu is not available on any given day, and you will not be catered to. \\n\\nBad customer experience = the cashier making you feel like you are bothering them by asking questions. Or even worse? How about charging a customer $2 for an extra plastic container because the food couldn't all fit in the provided container. $2(randomly set price) for a container that was bought in bulk and realistically worth no more than 25 cents. These are the types of things that make customers not want to come back. A 25 cent container is not worth losing a customer. \\n\\nI am Ultimately torn. The food is easily a 5, but the overall experience must be considered. I guess I'm tired of giving my people a pass for dropping the ball on the customer side. Will it stop me from coming back?

The cooking here is pretty straightforward.  You're getting pretty simple classical dishes with great ingredients.  Ingredients are combined very well.  Wines are pairings are well selected.  There's not a whole lot of complexity, that I could notice at least, in the preparation.  The dining environment is very comfortable, and it feels like you're eating at a friend's house.  \\n\\nBeast reminds me very much like eating at Alice Water's Chez Panisse (which I had the pleasure of trying for the first time a week after dining at Beast).  Like Chez Panisse, there are no course substitutions.  This perfectly fine, as both chefs are awesome.  The approach is very similar, and I love this type of minimalist but nonetheless effective cooking.  The food is always great, satisfying, and reasonably accessible to most palates.  The main difference is that Beast seems to have a more pronounced French influence, and the food can be a tad heavier.  I don't think this is necessarily a good or bad thing. Our dinner here followed this theme consistently.  Organization and focus at Beast is very good..\\n\\nWe began with 'spring onion soup.  goat butter, green garlic toast'.\\nThis was a very good soup with intense robust flavors.  The preparation appears to be fairly conventional, so my guess would be that again, everything comes from the well-though out combination of great ingredients.  best onion soup ever, and a nice, if somewhat heavy way to start.  This was my gf's favorite dish.\\n \\n'chacuterie plate' next.\\n\\nfoie gras bon bon, sauternes gelee.  shaped like a gourmet white chocolate, and resembles it somewhat in flavor.  fun dish, and arguably the most creative dish of the evening.  I try to have foie gras often, but I've yet to have it prepared like this here.\\n \\n'chicken liver mousse, leaf lard cracker'.  sweet, fine, and buttery.  almost like a dessert.  not gamey at all.  very pleasant.  one of the better chicken mousse I've had.\\n \\n'olympic provisions salami' delicate smokey & fatty flavors.\\nwent well w grain mustard & pickle.  It was good, but probably the weakest dish of the whole dinner.\\n \\n'pigs head terrine lemon zest, sherry, parsley'.  Fun play in flavors and texture.  Nonetheless delicate and tasty. great with our wine.\\n \\n'steak tartare, quail egg toast'. rich, robust, great tartare.  wish I had a giant portion.  Probably ties with the ribeye as the best part of the meal. This was the last item I sampled on the charcuterie board. \\n\\n'grapewood smoked carmen ranch rib eye creamed gathering together farms chard porcini mushrooms, fresh favas, demi glace'.\\nThis was a steak main course.  Had nice subtle smokey flavors, and didn't notice any char.  Meat cooked a nice medium rare, although closer to medium well towards the edge.  It was very juicy and had a good proportion of fat.  Wonderful, thick cut of steak.  Excellent. divine wine pairing with heavier velvety Bordeux (Chateau La Peyre St. Estephe Cru Artisan 2002).  Fava beans were a nice addition.  Demi glace is fairly subtle and thankfully didn't overpower the meat.  Some diners on our table, including my gf found this too rich, but I loved it.\\n\\n'arugala and strawberry salad.  shaved stilton cheese'  This was a  salad with fresh strawberries & pickled strawberries.  The combination of flavors flow very well together, especially when both types of strawberries are combined.  I normally don't care for Stilton blue cheese (if it was a blue, I'm not sure), because it usually overpowers everything in my past experience.  Not so much here.  Everything complemented each other well in harmony.  I'm just not a huge fan of serving salad as one of the last courses.  Wish it was offered before the soup.  After eating the steak, some of the subtle flavors might have been more muted.\\n\\nCheeseboard (certoux goat, le pommelier cow, fraga farms raw goat) very good, esp the certoux).  Poached apricot and the shortbread were an excellent condiments. (no more space)\\n \\n'rhubarb galette, creme fraiche ice cream, butterscotch sauce' \\ngreat sundae.  fresh rhubarb with warm flaky pastry.  nice reinterpretation of (what I believed to be) pie a la mode.  very good dish.  sprinkled gold flakes were a corny, but amusing.\\n\\nHighly recommended."},{"name":"Gloria Food Store","address":"268 Rantoul St","city":"Beverly","stars":"4.5","text":"This is the place for cold cuts, rolls, anti pasta, sandwiches and prepared salads."},{"name":"Guy Fieri's Tequila Cocina","address":"110 Causeway St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"All tequila and no cocina.

Would have liked to see the dish come with grilled bread so that the sauce does not go to waste!\\nQuinoa fritters (4+): Surprisingly good dish, very well-seasoned and moist. If I was to be critical, I would say that the ball had a tendency to crumble and I would have liked it to stay together just a little bit better, perhaps a bit more like falafel. \\nJumbo shrimp wrapped in prosciutto (4+): More like prosciutto-topped than wrapped. Spices suggested some cajun influences. Proportion of quinoa to the shrimp seemed a little bit off, but can't really complain for having more food, right? \\nVegetable risotto (5): Well composed and executed, delicious. Great roasted garlic flavor. \\nBraised short rib (3-): This had all the components of a great dish, and the protein was treated well.

I have zero complaints about my order or how long it took to come out. My friends all came in for Sunday brunch hoping to have a relaxing Sunday afternoon with some bomb food and $1 mimosas ($2 for doubles. We all got doubles. How can you not?). I ordered the bowling alley burger with an added egg and it was easily one of the best burgers I've ever had. It was juicy (I mean, really... that beautiful juice was oozing down my hands the entire time. Definitely dirtied up the napkin sitting on my lap) and packed with just the right amount of flavor. Simple and spectacular. \\n\\nNow let's backtrack and start from the beginning so ya'll understand why I'm giving this place a solid 2.5 when the food deserves a 5. \\n\\nWe were on our way to the restaurant when one of my friends called to ask them how long the wait currently was. Whoever was on the other side of that phone call told us about an hour. Cue the slight panic to try and find other brunch spots in the area that had less of a wait time and cheap mimosas. In the end, we decided to just wait for Swift's because it was everyone's first time and we wanted to try the food. However, one of our friends had work in about 1.5 hrs so decided to go home instead. Damn. Our bad. But was it really our bad? Because 15 minutes later my friend and I walked in asking to be put on the waitlist for 4 people and was told there was currently zero wait but she couldn't seat us unless our entire party was present. What. The. Flying. ????. I felt cheated. You'd think we would be happy, but now everyone who thought we had an hour to wait was scrambling to get to the restaurant. Strike 1. Another friend showed up 3 minutes later. Our last friend was having trouble finding parking so the three of us stood there waiting for her for another 15 minutes when there were clearly multiple empty tables in the restaurant. I understand that there are policies in place, I get that. But when it's roughly 1 hour before closing and a table for 4 is the exact same size as a table for 3 and is just sitting there empty.... You could at least seat us and let us order our freakin' mimosas. Then the hostess comes to us and asks where our friend is. Cue the ray of light that enters my brain thinking that she's going to seat us because our friend was literally running down the block to us, but nope, she just walks away. Strike 2. Then we get seated and all is good in the world again because now have food ordered and mimosas in hand but the waiter dropped off our food and kind of never came back or asked us if we needed anything after. If he did, he would have known I wanted some ketchup for my fries. But the real worry came when we finished our first glass of mimosas and were stalking the room to find him so we could get a second round before they closed. Strike 3. \\n\\nThree strikes on a Sunday afternoon. I think my blood pressure also rose a little and lasers were shooting out of my eyes at some points. Even though the food had me drooling, my health is more important, and this experience was just too stressful.

They said they enjoyed the tofu bowl, and they eat a decent amount of Korean food - so maybe the tofu bowl is actually good?\\n\\nHowever, in my opinion, the bibimbap tofu bowl to me was just a bowl with bland ingredients inside, and I wish there was just more flavor in it.

I'm also usually bored with the menu, not typically finding something exciting to try.\\n\\nHighland Kitchen is the answer to my prayers.\\n\\nAfter a 45 minute wait (which I expected), we were seated at a 2 top. I already had a drink from the bar, but they were careful in watching when I was almost finished and if I wanted a second. The drink I had was called a Bloodhound: a play on a greyhound, it was vodka, grapefruit juice, and blood orange juice. It was very delicious and very strong. \\n\\nI couldn't decide what to get, so I got 3 things: fried green tomatoes, fried buffalo brussels sprouts, and mozzarella ricotta fritters. My boyfriend opted for the pulled pork sandwich. We were served bread as we waited for our entrees.\\n\\nThe fried green tomatoes were fantastic. Hot and crispy with a delicious creamy garlic sauce. I also ate the greens they were served on, due to the dressing.\\n\\nNext came the other two entrees. The buffalo brussels sprouts were VERY good, my one complaint being that the sauce was very spicy. My boyfriend, a buffalo fiend, kept dipping his fries in the sauce. The blue cheese sauce served on the side was a nice, thinner consistency and complimented the sprouts.\\n\\nThe mozzarella ricotta fritters...they were out of this world. They're something from a dream. Similar to a fried donut, the fritter part was crisp on the outside, with a thinner puffier part right underneath, and a simultaneously gooey but fluffy cheese inside. The mozzarella part was gooey, the ricotta was soft and cloud like. It came with a very sweet dipping sauce, which was good but not great. I mixed it with ketchup to tone it down.\\n\\nThe best part? The fritters and sprouts reheated AMAZINGLY the next day in the oven. A miracle? Yes. A miracle from heaven. I actually drizzled Mrs. Butterworth's syrup on it, and it was amazing. \\n\\nAlso, guys, when you pack my leftovers, make sure you include the sauce that came with it!"},{"name":"Choice of India Restaurant","address":"305 NW 21st Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"We had such a wonderful dinner here!

I told her I'm gonna use the restroom before I was seated, and to seat the rest of my group first. When I was done and came to the front I couldn't find where my group was sitting and stood there. She was also there staring at me as I was waiting for her to tell me where the group was. Then she was like, \\"your group is over there\\" really rudely expecting I should already knew where they were. \\n\\nWe had a large party and ordered 8 dishes. All of them came out within 5 minutes of ordering. I am not exaggerating. The food is oily but doesn't taste super horrible... \\nThe beef chow fun: noodles were not the regular cut chow fun. Oily and the noodles all stuck together. I found some beef pieces that weren't cooked all the way and was red. Although eating raw beef is okay, this classic dish is not meant for raw beef. \\nEverything else is just mediocre. It was honestly really concerning that the food came out so fast. Sure, they could have had a lot of cooks but within 5 minutes of ordering is pretty skeptical.

Service, food and seating ergonomics were all top notch.  We found parking just a block away off Mississippi, ducked into Quaintrelle from the rain, and were warmly greeted by the staff.  \\n\\nAfter quickly being seated, we ordered Hendrick's martinis (served dry, cold and with a twist).   OK, so this is a mostly a style thing for me - though not entirely a style thing - but it seems everywhere we go these days, martinis are being served in coupe glasses and I don't like these outlandish glasses.  They seem 1930s-ish and their thin walls are not appealing to the lips.  As far as the martinis themselves, though we ordered them dry, they were very vermouthy.  But in the big picture of our Quaintrelle experience, not a big deal.\\n\\nWe started out with a salad comprised on corn, cabbage, chanterelle mushrooms, walnuts and the vegetable green sorrel.   Think of this dish as a light Waldorf salad and it was delicious.  For another starter we ordered the Magret ham with pickles.   This a-little-bit-pungent duck ham was served in thin oval shapes that covered an entire plate, reminding me somewhat of the appearance of fish scales.  The pickles were served separately in a little cup.  The ham was best when a bite of it was taken along with a bite of pickle.\\n\\nThe pork confit entree was very good and huge.  I recommend splitting it between two people.  The confit was served with turnips, mustard greens and apriums.  An aprium is a cross-breed between an apricot and a plum.\\n\\nJP ordered the half chicken served with wax beans and padr√≥n peppers.  I would've ordered this dish, but was scared away when our server mentioned that the chicken was seasoned with tarragon.  Generally, I find this spice loathsome, and disconcertingly, now becoming commonplace.  However, I couldn't detect the tarragon in the chicken.   Instead, the chicken was tasty.   Live and learn!\\n\\nBecause this was a birthday dinner, we went all out and ordered Grappa Nardini for dessert, along with a very good Aricha Station coffee pudding.  The pudding was accompanied by vanilla cream and blueberries.   While I have to admit that I don't believe I've ever met a grappa I didn't like, I really did enjoy the Grappa Nardini.  I consider grappa a potent liquorized wine.   \\n\\nAlso pleasing about Quaintrelle was that our server frequently checked with us to see if we needed more drinks, or wanted wine with our entrees.   Nobody likes to sit with an empty glass and that certainly doesn't happen at Quaintrelle."},{"name":"iPho Noodle House","address":"3005 West Lake Mary Blvd, Ste 108","city":"Lake Mary","stars":"4","text":"Best local Vietnamese restaurant!

So I finally get to go because I'm helping at the black market and I'm picking up orders but the chef is just rude and berating me and I'm just standing there shook. The lady at the cashier who took my order comes over and apologizes on his behalf with two cookies because she too is just as confused as I am. Cause I literally just stood to wait for my order when he came over. Now I'm just like to her \\"I don't know what just happened miss, I was just waiting for the order.\\" The chef is out here Taking his frustration out on the previous customer, berating him while he's dining . Like he practically pushed the food to him so hard the food fell off the plate to the floor and then also practically tossing one of the Togo plates to me. Telling me to get out his wayÔøΩ?now I'm not an emotional person but this week has just been the worst and like I said in a previously post I have literally become numb to every bad news I've been hearing all week. So now of course it just took one more thing to finally push me over and his actions was it. So I just took a seat, trying not to cry (I did cry/ it was a deep) smh and keep it together because literally everything was coming on all at once. So as I was waiting I was like what if he's just like me and just having a bad day. But even then you shouldn't treat people like that you work to serve.\\n\\nIf you are in customer service industry. You are suppose to be the face of the business and treat everyone no matter what with decency and respect because you might have a customer like me who could be out here trying to also keep it together emotionally and you because of your rudeness have insured that customer won't be back. You can have a customer like me excited because they've heard so much good things and then because of the disrespect in the way you served them Now will be writing to the manager or yelp about the behavior. \\n\\nIf you are a worker having a bad day- stay home take care of your own mental and emotional stuff and come in another day. If something is pushing you to the edge during work, tell someone that you need to take a break and chill and then come back after it's dealt with. It should never be that type of situation where whatever your dealing with intervenes with the way you treat the people you suppose to serve.\\n\\nAnd as a customer we also have to understand  that maybe our server is having a bad day. Maybe he just heard some bad news. Cause I really can't understand why anyone would come to work and act like an ass on the normal. So I talked to one of the servers and gave a man a tip with the note to do better just in case.  And I left and I ended up going back cause he messed up an order and when he saw me he was softer but he still was an ass. \\n\\nMoral of the story take care of yourself if you choose to serve people. Because as one of the faces of a business, your actions if you choose not to will make you and the business loose some money. Just like Haley house just lost mine. And as a customer just understand that it's not easy to be in a serving role day after the day after day. Especially at restaurants. If you can just be aware of that and tip if you can. \\"\\n\\nI am so sad I had this experience after months of hearing nothing but good things. Only to be treated like this by the chef. and yes I know all about Haley house and there mission as a transitional workplace and providing jobs to those who've been previously incarcerated. It's one of the reasons I wanted to come and support but as I said previously if your having a bad day you still need to take care of yourself before you come into work for the day."},{"name":"Kings Dining & Entertainment","address":"50 Dalton St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"My friend visited Boston from Puerto Rico for the first time.

Only me and 2 other customers inside. I ordered the cheeseburger and also 5 wings and fries (greedy I know but I couldn't decide which one I wanted ) the wait was extremely long. Like I said there were only 2 other customers in there. I will take into account that there were at least 3 drivers picking up for Uber Eats. So I didn't trip. But I still think it was a bit long. I waited almost 30 minutes for a burger and wings. The burger was good it was on Texas toast bread but a bit greasy.  I got the honey lemon pepper wings. The wings were cooked just like I like them and they weren't oversized wings which is plus with me. The sauce however was a bit bland. I felt it needed more lemon  to make a sweet/tangy blend. It was more honey than anything. But they were satisfactory none the less. I will go back because a friend swears by the shrimp  potato.

I was very excited to try it.\\n\\nFood:  I got the Spaghetti Carbonara (\\"House made Italian sausage folded with farm eggs, cream, and Italian bacon finished with parmigian cheese and fried basil\\").  I didn't eat much of the Italian sausage because it had fennel seeds in it.  I despise fennel seeds,  I could not, for the life of me, find any eggs or bacon in this dish.  Did they chop them up so fine that I couldn't see them?    Were they in the sausage meatballs?  I didn't see or taste eggs or bacon in the sausage.  The dish was just okay.  I can't figure out why it was spicy.  Had I known it would be spicy, I would have ordered something else.  I don't completely dislike spicy stuff, but I didn't want anything spicy for brunch.  Everyone else's food looked much better than mine.  \\n\\nService:  Was almost nonexistent.  It took the waiter five minutes to see that I was there and take my drink order.  He wasn't an especially friendly fellow, either. Once he delivered our food, he only came back to clear away plates; he never came during the meal to ask if everything tasted okay.\\n\\nAmbiance:  They were playing blues music when we were there.  It made me want to go down the street to Gene's for a shrimp po'boy rather than stay put and eat Italian food.\\n\\nI wanted to try some dessert, but each dessert item was $8.  Yikes!\\n\\nSomebody at the other end of the table got Sfingi (Italian doughnuts).  I wanted to try one, but the plate never made it to my part of the table, unfortunately.

I originally thought about ordering some, but my ticket was already $16.\\n\\nThe \\"Blue Crab Risotto Cake, Parma Prosciutto, Poached Egg\\" and the \\"Scrambled Eggs, Spinach, Fonduta, Apple Bacon\\", which I almost ordered, looked good.

We also had recently went to The Beehive and had a glorious delicious dinner with The Boy's dad so we thought Beat must be equally as good considering their sister restaurants .... right?\\n\\nWrong. A decent amount of the dishes at Beat overlap with The Beehive which was promising but overall Beat lacked the execution. We split the Buffalo Cauliflower, Memphis Flatbread, and Baked Rigatoni. Of all these dishes the only thing we really enjoyed was the Buffalo Cauliflower and even then it wasn't the best dish of its kind that I've had (Legal Seafoods does a better one).\\n\\nThe Memphis Flatbread which is supposed to be bbq chicken, pimento cheese, jalapeno, and scallions was just a bunch of ingredients haphazardly thrown on top of a crispy dough that more resembles crispy pita ... and was pre-cut? ... because for some reason the ingredients weren't even centered or evenly distributed across the pizza. Look at the photo - one slice is pretty much just a piece of bread with some ingredients on the tip. Chicken was dry, but the sauce being drizzled on top of all the ingredients meant nothing was holding the ingredients to the dough. Overall not worth your buck.\\n\\nThe Baked Rigatoni was an even bigger disaster than the flatbread. I can't comprehend how something that consists of duck confit - duck cooked in rendered fat - came out SO DRY. The pesto was dry thus making the pasta dry and even the mozzarella was lackluster (how can that be possible with MELTY CHEESE?!).\\n\\nStick to drinks here, avoid the food - bring your business to The Beehive instead if you're looking for a satisfying meal."},{"name":"Southern Kin Cookhouse","address":"500 Assembly Row","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"Wow what a bad experience.

Parking, as with any Commercial spot, is nearly non-existent. I had to park at the nearby rec centre.  The ambiance is good, a busy and boisterous team which is aiming to please.\\n\\nThe Rookie was a good showcase for the chicken, as it dominates the dish. A full breast is provided at the heat level of your choice. I chose the least spicy, and it still had a bit of a kick.  The coating was crispy and delicious, but became unglued from the meat midway through the burger. At that point the burger fell apart, so I grabbed a knife and fork to get through the rest. Still good, but I suspect there is another dish that matches my tastes more and is a better balance between elements.\\n\\nThe fries were great and spicy as ordered. I like spice and the generous helping overwhelmed the two drinks I had already procured for the meal. Eat a single serving with friends. It comes with house sauce which seems to be a mix of mayo, hot sauce, and some pureed pickle.\\n\\nOverall this is a great place, but I think another dish will feature the chicken a bit better.

One night, we were on a walking ghost tour, and our tour guide was giving us the history of the Turner's Seafood building. I checked the photos on Yelp, and the combination of spooky and delicious made for an intriguing dinner option, so we made a reservation for the next night! Hot tip: if you want to make sure you get seated at a specific time, definitely call to make a reservation in October, as Salem gets CRAZY busy! :)\\n\\nWe arrived a little earlier than our reservation time, but the hostess was extremely sweet and told us we could grab a drink at the bar until our table was ready. I'll never say no to that! My friend ordered a pumpkin beer, which came with a salted caramel rim. I ordered a cider, and I must've looked longingly at the salted rim of my friend's drink, because the bartender asked if I wanted one, too. Obviously I said yes!\\n\\nAfter hanging out for a bit, we were called to our table about 10 minutes before our scheduled reservation time. Hell yes. We got lucky enough to sit next to what looked like an old vault door, in the back area of the restaurant. A few minutes after being seated, we each ordered a drink off of their menu, which featured quite a few fall options. I picked the Fall Sangria, which was very apple-y. If you're a fan of fruity alcohol, go for this one!\\n\\nTo eat, I *knew* lobster was the way to go, so I chose a New England Lobster Roll, which came with slaw and fries. Our waitress also brought out bread, and I happily scarfed some of that down, too.\\n\\nThe whole layout of this place is gorgeous and has a very spooky feel, especially after learning about a lot of the building's history.

The relleno was pretty standard, the tamale was actually very nice; the cornmeal was very soft and moist and no dry and crumbly, and the quesadilla was very crispy and had an excellent filling:tortilla ratio that lead to no dripping out of toppings. \\n\\nI ordered the combination fajitas, steak, chicken, and shrimp. The steak was what actually dropped this review from 5 stars to 4 stars. It was tough. I'm used to Mexican places knowing their way around a piece of flank steak, but this one was not enjoyable. The chicken and the shrimp, however, are the best I've had in many years. The chicken was perfectly moist and seasoned, and the shrimp was not overcooked, which is all I've ever wanted from my fajita. \\n\\nThe only other gripe I have is that the serving of rice and beans that came with my fajita was super small compared to other restaurants, but that balances out with the fact that I asked for extra tortillas to go and they didn't charge me for them. \\n\\nOverall, wow, the bang for your buck at this place is extreme.

None of the guests were talking to each other, so the neighborhood thing didn't play out as romantically as I suppose I had hoped.  \\n\\nOnce we put on our, \\"really, I do know some things about wine,\\" act, our bartender, Matt, warmed significantly.  He regaled us with no shortage of wine information.  He recalled regions, wine makers, grapes, and fermenting styles with professionalism and ease.  We started with a bottle of an unfiltered Italian \\"orange wine\\" called Prauar.  It was a great call on Matt's part.  It was followed with a bottle of Movia Lunar, from Slovenia, another win!!\\n\\nWe sampled some cheeses, they were mostly great, however, we were slightly disappointed when our order was wrong and only two slices of each were provided to three guests on their second bottle of medium to high priced wine.  Alas, in the beautiful neighborhood around 552 Tremont, I can understand supply, demand, and overhead.\\n\\nThe expereince was a delight.  We will definitely return.  Expensive wine costs money and the Butcher Shop atmosphere provides an excellent ambiance in which to indulge.  Thank you Matt for hosting us and blending your comprehensive understanding of your product with a relaxed presentation and your comfortable style."},{"name":"Kings Dining & Entertainment","address":"50 Dalton St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"Came here for date night and honestly was such a great experience! We made reservations for the dine and bowl which essentially gets you dinner and then priority for bowling. We were served by Nephy and honestly one of the best waitresses! She gave stellar recommendations and told us that the menu was recently changed. For drinks, she recommended the bull & bear and the Japanese blood orange fizz! I loved the bull & bear, comes with gummy bears and a tropical Red Bull, peach liquor and vodka! Hits the spot and the Japanese blood orange fix was a refreshing twist on the gin and tonic. For main course, we got the burger with a side of Parmesan fries and her recommended tortellini with sausage. Both extremely delicious. We filled out a sheet with our names and shoe sizes so that when we were ready to bowl we would get to have it all ready. We actually were given complimentary Prosecco after telling her it was date night! Since it was a busy night, we were told bowling wouldn't be ready until 8 (our reservation was 6:15) so we also got complimentary skeeball balls to play and tokens for the arcade! Honestly this place was amazing and the amount of attention we got made our night. We were checked on often and the manager came over to talk as well. The menu changes every 6 months and I highly recommend the beignets for dessert! You get 6 fried pieces of dough with powdered sugar and jelly and caramel syringes to insert into them which we were able to eat right on the bowling lane! Bowling is by the hour and I think it was $13/hr with a rental fee for shoes ($6~) if u get an entree or burger with a side. Recommend this fun retro spot as a cute date night or fun team bonding activity!

First positive sign was that there's lots of easy parking in front because of their strip mall location.  An order of teriyaki chicken with white rice and veggies was only $6.95. . .a very reasonable price, since many other places charge at least a dollar more for the same item.  The grilled chicken was good. . .tender, and not chewy.  I liked the taste of their teriyaki sauce and also liked its thicker consistency that stuck to the food (unlike some other sauces that are thin and watery).  I wished that the vegetables consisted of more broccoli and carrot and not as much cabbage. . .it was just about entirely cabbage with two pieces of broccoli and two thin slices of carrot (sigh).  Overall though, the tastiness of the grilled chicken and teriyaki sauce outweighed the \\"inadequacy\\" of the veggies, and the excellent value due to the low price made it even better.

I may go back and purchase one it was so cool and really appealed to me. The women's bathroom also had a different theme of art for sale (it was also very clean and nice). \\nThe menu had a good variety of lunch items, dinner items and brunch.

I wasn't keen on the mimosa and traded my dining partner in crime for his black and tan. That was better - a bit strong. So some might really like that!\\nFor meals, we got the poutine as a starter. It was SO good. The gravy was right and it had tons of meat on top. We devoured it. I got the Belgian waffles with strawberries. Yum. And a bowl of their chicken rice and veggie soup. Another yum. My mother got the hash breakfast and it was huge. Came with a ton of hash and home fries. The home fries were really hot and took a long time to cool off. I didn't find them that great.

I tasted the \\"Mediterranean Tomato and Chickpea soup\\", and it's consistency and flavor resembled pureed canned tomatoes, no chickpeas, no flavor aside from sodium.  I tried a bite of the rice/\\"kale salad\\".  It just tasted like sesame oil.  I couldn't get past the lack of fresh.  It made New Seasons pre-packaged deli salads look like an atrium of farm fresh produce.\\n\\nI am embarrassed about this last part.  I walked out, leaving the plate of food on the table.

Nice dimly lit candles, sleek modern look and a nice open raw bar/pasta/bar station to watch all the chefs and bartenders in action (see video).

It looked that good!   \\n\\nOut of everything we had, my 2 most absolute favorite finds here has got to be the super affordable house Chardonnay they sell by the bottle that was under $20 and the option to have any of their fried seafood served buffalo style.  Our fried buffalo oysters were amazing!  And where the heck can you get a decent bottle of wine in a nice restaurant for under $20 these days?  Nowhere, that is, besides here.  Pure awesomeness.\\n\\nTheir raw bar and cod cakes were also excellent.  The clams and oysters were freshly shucked right in front of us in under 5 minutes and the cod cakes reminded me of a delicious oversized salt cod croquette except it's less salty and much bigger.

The hostess suggested that I wait at the bar, which I happily obliged. The hostess was kind and said nothing about my dress attire. While waiting at the bar in a full suit & tie, which included an expensive dress ivy wool cap, I was approached by the manager who asked me to take my hat off. I advised that I was not aware of any formal dress code.  The manager stated that I could finish my drink and check my hat afterwards. Within 2-3 minutes later in the middle of my drink, this manager returned and in a rude, loud voice state that I needed to take my hat off or leave.  I was absolutely stunned and so was my party, at how rude this manager was to us.  \\n\\nShocked from his behavior,  I didn't finish my drink, paid for it and advised that he could cancel my reservation.

I advised that it was not her fault but we were simply upset, as this was a corporate reservation and no restrictions were previously advised.

After arriving back to California, we removed Truluck's from our corporate list and added Eddie V's.  My issue in this story was not with the dress code, if it existed, it should have been formally enforced via multiple means (which I broke down to the manager, who rebuffed my suggestions).

It gets a little busy so all ahead to try to secure a reservation or expect a wait during dinner hour. Everything here is designed for sharing (which I recommend because you can try everything) so some of the dishes are very tiny portions. \\n\\nThis is what I had over my two visits (I am not that much of a fattie to consume this much in one sitting). To start I would get the brussels sprouts, sweet potato with curry, a mixed fungi dish, and the octopus and tofu (this one was on a special menu, not sure how often they change that out). The brussels sprouts were cooked to perfect crispness and flavor, that didn't last more than a minute on the table. The hot & sour 'fun guy' dish was one of my favorites, two rare types of mushrooms tossed with ginger, it's such a unique medley of different type of fungi that you don't commonly see used in dishes and the flavor was just so good. Then we followed all that with pork cheeks served with a sweet marmalade and mustard and sourdough bread. I recommend the sweet spread to balance out the flavors of the pork. Make sure you mix up the pork with the spoon to make it more spreadable. Next came the goat with gnocchi, you can definitely taste the goat flavor, overall also yummy. The pork belly was crisp to perfection, tends to be a tad fattier which is my favorite kind. My all time favorite HIGHLY RECOMMENDED Is the Korean BBQ beef flank. They utilize a Korean spicy kimchi flavor and sweet galbi sauce and topped that over rice cakes which is soooooo good when you use it to sop up the sauce. The beef was also just cooked so well, words can't even describe it. \\n\\nDrinks were also very good. They specialize in unique crafted cocktails. Their famous ice balls are a unique concept in which the flavors are mixed into a frozen ball which gradually melts as you sip on your drink slowly releasing flavors. Very potent, drink with caution. \\n\\nOverall great ambiance, a little noisy, friendly waitstaff and great service.

My first night I arrived at 2am and of course the lobby closes at 11pm so there was no one there to speak with. My 2nd bedroom blinds were broken and did not have a drape to pull to block the morning sun. Also, housekeeping obviously swept the trash from the bedroom into the closet (inside the closet) that was used to store room d√©cor, towels randomly hanging from the shelves and an almost empty bottle of dish washing liquid, sponges, etc. all in Walmart bags. The entry door had a screw handing from the pad and the lock pad was detached from the door which did not lock and the baseboards were filthy. Of course I complained the next morning and was moved to another room which was considered an upgrade (a 3 bdrm). This room had the same issue with the door, this time the screw missing completely, the door was detached at the bottom as if it was pushed in by the police, the 2nd bdrm TV did not work at all, the thermostat was stuck on 63 for 10 hours, and again, the baseboards were filthy, the washing machine smelled like mildew, there was a roach in the master bedroom, there was a stain on one of the twin beds in the 3rd bdrm and there was trash outside of the front door under the staircase next to an empty trash can and the room phones did not work. They bought another phone in and stated they had to call the phone company......The phone company for a hotel room? On the third day I realized that the staircase was obviously where the guests stored their trash and where they let their animals use the restroom because there was another pile of trash in addition to the first pile and also 4 empty Coors beer cans next to a trash bag and dog sh*t. All of this was mentioned to the front desk. They sent maintenance to put a screw in the door and clean the room (on the 2nd day). The screw was still hanging out when I checked out. As for the washing machine, I asked for 8 sets of fresh towels the next morning before leaving for the parks and was told that they would be placed in the room. I received 5 INDIVIDUAL towels (2 face towels, a wash towel, a dry towel and a floor mat)  5 towels for a room that had 8 people. I wasn't able to get more towels until the next morning when the lobby opened and at that time I was told to use the washing machine. I had to remind them that the machine smelled like mold. (after that day, I stopped every morning fro clean towels) As for the stained sheets, housekeeping bought me a bag of sheets as if I was supposed to change the linens on the bed myself. And someone picked up the dog mess. Of course, I took pictures of everything and was compensated for my 1st night stay. This resort if horrible. They couldn't give me a week free stay at this resort. The pictures are very deceiving. ALSO! I was offered 3 free gifts at the time of booking and only received one which was a $5 Starbucks coupon...I'll be sure to follow up to let you know if it's honored.

I almost wish I'd gotten JUST jamabalaya - it was REALLY good, particularly for being, you know, off a Massachusetts highway.

Interesting how that works.\\n\\nWe drove by the Salt & Straw closer to downtown and the line was out the door and around the corner. It was a warm day out, but it wasn't THAT warm. Anyway, we decided to give this one a try before heading back to Seattle and the line was still out the door, but we were willing to do the wait.\\n\\nHere's where this service comes in. We were in line outside, and remember I said it wasn't THAT hot of a day, maybe like high 60s low 70s, with cloud cover. One of the workers came outside and offered water cups and hand menus! That was awesome. The menu looks like it's composed of about 10 \\"classic\\" flavors and 5 or 6 monthly creations. I say classic lightly because they're not your typical flavors, they're still quite a bit quirky, but they're just a mainstay on the menu. Some of these include Salted caramel, pear and blue cheese (pear was great, but blue cheese in ice cream is a bit weird), and vanilla and chocolate. \\n\\nWe actually weren't all the way at the counter yet when a worker came to ask if we wanted to try anything. She remembered all of our flavors (there were 8 of them) and she came back with 8 spoons with the flavors we asked for! I ended up ordering a kids scoop ($3.50, and still quite a big scoop) of the Strawberry Honey Balsamic with Black pepper. I was skeptical at first, but it just tasted like a sweeter strawberry ice cream with black pepper bits that you could see but not exactly taste. The ice cream was super creamy and made from fresh, local ingredients. \\n\\nLeaving this place, I enjoyed me ice cream, but I'll definitely remember the friendly people who ran this store. It was super busy, but they handled it all with smiling faces and polite attitudes, giving great flavor suggestions and not rushing anyone at all!

We ordered chicken pakora as an appetizer and for our dinner we pigged out and ordered aloo gobi (pan fried cauliflower and potatoes in savory tomato sauce), lamb tikka masala, and cheesy naan. Every bite was wonderful, and there were so many outstanding-looking things on the menu that we simply couldn't stuff in our bellies. Good thing we have that buffet coming up soon!\\n\\nAlso, I need to point out that the service was top notch. The server and the manager were both so warm and welcoming, and we were never left wanting for anything. They definitely understand hospitality and making people feel at home, and I can only imagine this would be a wonderful place at which to be a regular. \\n\\nI'll be back in a week for that special holiday buffet, and I'd wager that I'll return again after that, too."},{"name":"Jaho Coffee Roaster & Wine Bar","address":"116 Huntington Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Disappointing all around. 1. I asked the cashier what was in a particular latte, and she legitimately could not answer and then stared at me as if I was asking for her blood type. I don't think that's a lofty expectation--it's a coffee shop. You should know what's in your drinks. 2. No prices. How can you be a boutique coffee shop and not post prices, but then charge $4 for a small latte? Be expensive, but be transparent. 3. It took FOREVER. Literally forever, compounded by the fact that my friends order was made incorrectly, and then they tried to 'make it right' by just dumping espresso in it. A dirty chai latte is not the same as a chai latte. 5. It was lukewarm. But after everything I listed above, it was almost easier to just drink the cold hot latte rather than deal with having it remade.

The food is great, environment is quite decent. However the waiter served our table was not satisfactory. We had 6 people, on business trip, had $100/person budget for a decent dinner. I was going to order some crab cake as appetizer for us, so I asked him how large is the crab cake, is it fried, and he answered. Then I asked others do you want some crab cake, and some says yes, and we confirmed 2 should be enough for all. Then he asked me \\"what side course do you want with the crab cake?\\" I asked \\"does the price of crab cake include a side course?\\" because normally when I was asked this question, I would assume so, otherwise he could ask \\"would you like some side course with the crab cake?\\" You get it, they have different implies. But he said \\"no it's not, but normally people would order some side course with it.\\" I didn't say anything besides no, but seriously? Even if everyone else is ordering side course, I may not, so why do you have to sound like the price is included? Money isn't really a problem for us, just we don't have much interest in veggies.\\n\\nI guess that's how he thought we were short on budget, and we were wearing T-shirts and sneakers (because we had Karting races right before the dinner). If the waiter has listened to any part of the conversation earlier of me asking others about crab cake, he should understand the crab cake was meant to for us to share. However he thought that was my main course, and without asking \\"would you like anything else\\", he just moved on to the next person. So after the next person finished his order, I had to tell him \\"I haven't ordered my main course\\". \\n\\nAnd a few times when I asked/told him something, he didn't stop and listened to me, but just kept walking and turned his head partially to me and nodded. Are you really that busy? Overall I felt the waiter's manner is below the standard for such restaurant. I was demanding about his manner because it's such a high end restaurant.

I don't know how this place gets such good ratings.\\n\\nThe Service: \\nThe dinner started off great with superb service. The waiter was very kind and professional. The classic hip-hop music gives the place a nice vibe. The restaurant complements the Elephant Room downstairs well. There weren't too many people inside, but it wasn't completely empty. At one point in the meal, the chef and a second waiter visited our table to ask us how things were going. They even brought a second table to join our table to give us more room for our dishes, which was a very nice gesture. Our waiter, however, didn't really know what type of wine would complement well with our dishes. Service/atmosphere gets 4/5 stars.\\n\\nThe Food: \\nThe Sweet Potato vegetable dish: it had an interesting curry flavor to it. It was pretty good. 4/5 stars.\\nThe Quail meat dish: not bad, but I've experienced better quail dishes. 3/5 stars.\\nThe Atlantic Salmon seafood dish: this just did not comport with my taste buds. The salmon was a little dry, and I had to dip it into the brothy sauce for it to be better. It needed more butter or the piece needed to be fresher and fattier. I think the combination with the broccolini was a bad match. I've made much better salmon at home. For a $24 dish, I expected A LOT more. 2/5 stars.\\n\\nThe Dessert:\\nThe milk and cookies \\"special\\" dessert: the description of this dessert sounded so good, so we got it, but it was probably the worst dessert I've ever had out at a restaurant. When it was brought to our table, I thought it was a joke. Like a kid had prepared it. I immediately noticed that the \\"cookies\\" part of the dessert were literally three Fig Newtons folded on top of one another. We were hoping it was something else that just so happened to look like Fig Newtons, but we tasted them, and they were actually warmed up Fig Newtons... REALLY!? FIG NEWTONS!? You can get 12 fig newtons packaged at a grocery store in the dessert/snack aisle for 99 cents. It's the CHEAPEST packaged dessert option at a grocery store. How do I know this, you ask? Because I have fig newtons in my pantry in my apartment, and I buy it because it's cheap and makes a good cheap snack. It does not, however, make a worthy ingredient for a nightly special dessert out at a nice restaurant that I have to pay $8 for!  The dish also had a spoonful of chocolate ice cream and a couple rasberries on the dish as well. That was it. That was the dish. After we ate some of the dessert, the chef came out to ask us how we liked it. I could barely look at him to tell him anything. I was still in shock and uncomfotable awe of how bad this dessert was. The chef was so nice to come to our table to see how things were going. I should have said something to him. He certainly could have used the feedback. 0/5 stars.\\n\\nAfter paying for the check, and as I was about to leave, one of the waiters asked me what we got for dessert. I told him we got the \\"milk and cookies\\". I was still hoping that maybe, just maybe, we got it wrong - that these \\"fig newton\\" like cookies were actually homemade cookies that they made in the kitchen and these just so happened to look and taste like Fig Newtons. But the waiter responded happily, \\"ah, the fancy fig newtons!\\" I was stumped. I felt like I was in a Seinfeld episode. How could a restaurant this nice do this to its patrons? My guess is that they are a business struggling. Maybe profit margins are thin. Maybe management is on the chef's back about cost. Or maybe this was a new chef. Or perhaps a temporary chef and the real chef was out for the thanksgiving week. Or maybe this chef was just trying to f*ck with cheap ingredients and make something good out of nothing? Or maybe the chef is rebelling? I don't know.\\n\\nI don't care how much you like Fig Newtons, but they should never be served as part of a dessert dish at a seemingly nice restaurant for $8. Please don't do this! I felt robbed. I will never be back here. Their decent and polite service does not make up for how bad that dessert was.

The Burmese red stew reminds me a lot of a dish my mom makes back at home, but this one was a bit sweeter and had an oozing egg, which made this dish much more tasty and attractive to me. Our Shashuka took awhile because the cook messed up so we were given a complimentary salad while we waited. The purple/reddish cabbage was bitter and really hard to enjoy, but the bread crumbs were delicious. We didn't finish that dish unfortunately. When our Shashuka came, we were getting full. The dish is best with bread to dip with because the veggies were a little too heavy for breakfast. I thought it was a baked dish with rice or something, but it was mostly bell peppers with a kick. Reminded me of salsa and that was too much for me for a breakfast dish. I ate all the eggs but we didn't finish that either.

A bit pricey for just toast and tea, buuut I knew what I was getting myself into.\\n\\nWe got there a little earlier, about 15 min before they opened, but their doors were wide open so I just walked right in. I didn't even know they hadn't opened yet (like I said, it was my first time). But they weren't rude or anything, or kick us out. The girl who helped us was very friendly. She took our order before they opened, which was nice of her (totally didn't expect her to do that), but she told us since the kitchen was still opening up and getting ready for opening and such, it might take a little bit. Which was totally fine and understandable.\\n\\nThey have a small section of wall dedicated to their iced teas and lemonades. My husband got \\"rose pedal lemoade\\" which taste very fresh tart. I got one of their hot teas, some kind of dragon jasmine white/green tea blend, and can I just say, I'm obsessed. Yes, after having it once I literally looked it up bc I want to buy it. I did ask for honey with my tea. When I got it, I thought they would give me a little thing of honey on the side so I could put in the amount I wanted, but no, apparently they put the honey in your tea before they serve it to you. That was the only thing I wasn't thrilled about because the servers don't know how much honey you want or is to your liking. So when I got my tea, it tasted bitter to me even though they had already added honey. So I went and got some turbinado sugar and added 2 packets to my tea to sweeten it up, and after that it was perfect. I think they should let you put in the honey yourself (like how the steeping room does it).\\n\\nThe food did not take that long to get out to us. It was presented very nicely and pretty. Very insta-worthy. The tomato toast is a lot more savory and sweet than the toast. It is slathered in a thick layer of goat cheese, tomato, and balsamic. SO good. Highly recommend. My avo toast was great as well, if you're looking for something with a little less kick. Thick layer of avocado, an egg, and topped with black sesame seeds. You can add hot sauce if you'd like and honestly I think it gives it a little more of a kick that makes it perfect. They cut each piece of bread into thirds, so its perfect for sharing!\\n\\nAmbiance inside and out is really pretty, but also laid back. Gives me a sense of being a hippy, but with money. Know what I mean? Haha, anywho, all in all, when I have extra money to blow, I think I'll come back here for my avo toast fix. :)"},{"name":"The Manchester Arms","address":"1705 Virginia Ave","city":"College Park","stars":"4","text":"We had some time to kill before a flight and found this place on Google.

We settled on a French Chardonnay and ordered all of the small plates on the menu. \\n\\nThe cheese souffl√© and pork terrine were both very classic and delicious, but our favorite dishes were the shrimp cocktail (which involved a fun twist of a half-frozen tomato gazpacho) and the oysters Rockefeller, which used Kumamoto oysters in a subtle preparation that really highlighted the quality of the oysters. The salad included bitter mustard greens, house made croutons, and fromage blanc artfully brushed around the rim of the bowl. \\n\\nWe finished with the canneles, which were utter perfection.

In the space that used to be Petit Robert, you will find an upscale, trendy vibe that is perfect for the working professionals of the area. The restaurant opens for lunch at 11, and during the week has a steady, packed dining room until about 2. Dinner starts to heat up around 5. Definitely make a reservation if you are coming for lunch, but they always find room for walk-in customers who have a smile on their face. As the weather gets cooler and the theatre district starts to get busy, as does CB. The holiday season is especially busy, so reservations are key!\\n\\nThe bar and lounge area is perfect for a drink and apps, cocktail hour with your coworkers, or even a casual dinner/lunch at the bar. If you're lucky, you'll get served by the Bar-Master himself, Winston, and his many exciting cocktail creations. The dining room is a bit more formal around dinnertime, with formal service from well-trained waiters and waitresses. You can expect to see both the Event Manager and the GM walking around checking on tables and assisting servers as needed during lunch and often times at dinner.\\n\\nThe menu changes seasonally, always offering a wide selection of sandwiches, main courses, and interesting small bites. You will definitely notice the artistic nature of the kitchen staff on the dinner menu, as they get creative with flavor combinations and presentation. For lunch, you will not be disappointed by the Chicken Sandwich or Reuben, and don't forget the French Onion Soup. I have been eating here (way too often) for a year and I still am a frequent and happy customer.\\n\\nOne of the best things about CB, is their ability to host any and all kinds of events. Mike, the Event Manager, is incredibly easy to work with and will make your vision come to life. After working on the staff side of weddings, work parties, formal dinners, and cast/wrap parties, I now am on the other side and get to plan my events with Mike, and it is always a seamless process. Competitive rates, exciting menus, and the most hospitable staff in the area make CB a great spot for your next function.

Every single dish we had was so good. \\n\\nSweet Pepper Burrata: Is this heaven? It's super soft and melty. I love that it's served with toast. The pieces of toast are not crunchy or completely soft. It's perfectly crunchy soft if it makes sense.\\n\\nBrussel Sprouts: Simply flavorful. We had two orders and still wanted more, so we had to order more.\\n\\nSquid Fries: They're sticks of calamari. Yummy!\\n\\nCharred Edamame: This place takes edamame to the next level. The edamame is charred nicely, tossed in chili oil for a good kick of heat, and served with POP ROCK. It has the nice balance of salty and sweet and popping in your mouth. Surprisingly delicious! Whoever thinks of this dish is a genius! \\n\\nBlistered Shishitos: Perfectly charred. The dipping sauce is such a great match.\\n\\nSeared Scallops: Amazing! It's perfectly cooked. I feel like Gordon Ramsey would definitely approve it if this dish was made on Hell's Kitchen.\\n\\nSeoul Food: The shrimp is very flavorful. It's a beautiful marriage with kimchi grits and bacon bits mixed inside the grits. \\n\\nTender Belly Farms Pork Cheeks: Pork cheeks are cooked until it's super tender. It's served with sourdough toast, fig jam, and mustard. Get a piece of toast, spread some fig jam and mustard on it, scoop a piece of pork cheeks and put on the toast. It'll knock your socks off! \\n\\nKorean BBQ Flank Steak: This dish is decent. It's not really special to me. We just needed some protein from meat, so we just went with it. \\n\\nDesserts: Chocolate Fig Tart and Maple Custard. These two are so good!!!! Maple custard just melts in your mouth and it's not overly sweet. Nicely served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Chocolate fig tart is rich, but the fig jam and pieces balance it out. \\n\\nInterior: Very nice decoration. I want to live here!\\n\\nStaff: Our servers were Mike and Grant. They provided us fantastic service. Very personable, friendly, and helpful. Our glasses were always filled with wine and water without us asking. They were always around when we needed to place extra orders. Food also came out very fast. \\n\\nPricing: Not cheap but not too expensive.

For the people taking stars away from lack of cartage (is that even a word? well, it is now), I'm here to counterbalance that perception. This is precisely WHY I go...though my rating here is not directly impacted by cartage, it is indirectly impacted by the fact that I suspect lack of cartage is why the food arrives faster here and the service is less grouchy/arbitrary about seating (looking at you, Hei La Moon). \\n\\nBecause the space is pretty small, prepare to wait (though not too long, everyone else eating is pretty good about not lingering and also, since everyone sees you waiting, management is good about first come first come seating) and in really busy seasons, to share a large round table with another party. \\n\\nHighlights include the turnip cakes (that sauce is pretty darn good) and shrimp dumplings (large shrimp...legit). My friend takes out orders of the rice flour rolls to go when she needs to travel on the Amtrak for work (but make sure to eat them within a few hours, they will harden)."},{"name":"Choice of India Restaurant","address":"305 NW 21st Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"My husband and I came here last night.

We ordered an appetizer chicken pakora.  The flavor was amazing.  Even tho it was fried it wasn't oily.  That means the cook knows what they're doing.  We also had the hot tea.  I absolutely loved it.  The buttered chicken was everything I hoped it'd be and more!  We also had Dahl kabila (I hope I spelled that right) both was amazing.  We ate two orders of the naan.

Then when i said to her the red eye was 56.00 she replied that has been the price for the last year and a half. Her response was cold and if it was meant to be rude it worked.

Well, she has eaten at this restaurant twice and had a great experience.  Apparently, this restaurant is under new management and has been renovated. It has been operational for a little over two months. \\n\\nArrival:  upon arrival, there was a short line up the street for the valet. Odd, but not alarming.  Once I was close enough to see the restaurant, I realized the delay was due to inexperienced valet attendants who only allowed one car to drive in the gate at a time. Clearly there was enough room for at least three cars to pull in at a time so I was confused as to why it was being done this way, but whatever. Lol. So, once I pull up, the attendant opened my door, greeted me with a smile and asked for my name. He then addressed me by name and asked if it was my first time. I said, \\"yes\\", then he said, \\"I see you have on heels so let me help you out if the car\\". He gave me his hand to help me out of the car then handed me a valet claim ticket. He then proceeded to help me up the stairs to be sure I didn't trip walking in. He was pleasant and respectful. Great job!\\n\\nUpon walking in, I was very impressed with the look and feel of the place. I didn't expect it to look so nice. The large bar is the focal point of the room, it's the first thing you see when you walk in. There are several chairs at the bar for seating with hi boys nearby and tables on the main floor with large booth seated areas along the wall. I also saw another space behind the main dining floor and I was also told there was a club in the basement. \\n\\nOnce again, the customer service was excellent! The waitresses, managers, valet, everyone was fantastic! Two ladies from my party were seated once I arrived and had already ordered the bottomless mimosas.  Once I arrived the waitress gave me a menu and took my drink order. I only ordered water and I observed as the waitresses took orders at other tables and I saw the food as it was delivered to tables. The food looked delicious! Pancakes, grits, steak, eggs, pork chops, shrimp and grits! Yes, yes, yes! I couldn't wait to order. \\n\\nI ordered the pancake meal which came with two pancakes, 2 eggs any style and a meat. I ordered egg whites, turkey bacon and a side of grits. I knew I wanted pancakes before I arrived so I had my sugar free cary's syrup packets with me (don't judge, lol). As more ladies in our party arrived they ordered also. Shortly after, I realized a band was setting up. I immediately got excited because I love live music. Well, the gentleman sang popular R&B music so we were more than happy to sing along.  After the third song, I was really having a great time until I realized our food had not arrived. Oh, boy. Well, we were assured the food would be another 15 minutes.  Ok. No problem. Two more songs in, we all stopped singing and became annoyed. Still no food but the bottomless mimosas kept coming (for those who ordered them). This time, we asked the manager about the food and he said he would check. At this time it had been a little over an hour since I ordered. Maybe another 30 minutes later, our food began to arrive. My order was correct minus the egg whites. They gave me regular eggs but said to keep the eggs and they would cook some egg whites for me (these eggs came after I ate my pancakes and sent the rest of the food back). Since I had my own syrup, I started eating the pancakes immediately and asked the waitress for butter for my grits. The turkey bacon was very oily and by the time I got butter (about 10 minutes later) the grits were cold and watery. Basically the only thing edible on my plate were the pancakes, not to mention the fact they never gave us any syrup so my friend asked if I would share mine.  My other friend ordered the catfish, eggs and grits and said her grits were watery, the catfish and eggs were cold. Another ordered the shrimp and grits which came with toast. The toast arrived burnt and she said the shrimp and grits were cold.  There were 7 of us. I could go on and on about the cold food, under cooked and overcooked food but there is no need. Ultimately several waitresses and other staff continued to apologize, offer free drinks and explain the restaurant is fairly new and the kitchen was not ready for the crowd and scrambled the orders. \\n\\nEventually the floor manager said he would only charge the table $50 for the food and apologized again. We paid the $50 plus tip and exited the building. Sadly, there were several people in the parking lot complaining about never getting food or had an experience similar to ours. \\n\\nI give this restaurant 2 stars.  If it wasnt for the customer service, it would be 1 star because 5 of us got sick after we left the restaurant. Coincidence,  possibly but not likely.

German food is definitely not at the top of my list of favorite foods, but man oh man, does this place hit the spot. Located just a block or two away from the infamous dirty sixth street, this place has a calm European charm to it that completely differentiates it from the crazy ratchet bars next door. There's a cute little bakery when you walk through the doors that sells various pastries and artisan breads, then you walk down to find their indoor seating and bar area, and further down there's the outdoor patio area with string lights and a smaller bar. It is open seating throughout the entire restaurant, whether you're inside or outside. If you're at one of the long bench tables outside, more likely than not, you'll be sharing the table with a bunch of other people. Finding seating here is not my favorite, but the food and beer make up for it! \\n\\nWe came for the Bell's Brewery Launch Party, which is a brewery in Michigan where my friend is from so he wanted to check it out. They had four of Bell's beers available -- Lager of the Lakes , Bohemian Pilsner; Two Hearted Ale, American IPA; Porter, Robust Porter; Kalamazoo Stout, American Stout. I'm not a huge fan of porters or stouts, so instead of going for a flight like I usually do, I went ahead and got the Two Hearted IPA (this was also highly recommended by my good ol' Michigan friend). This alongside their pastrami sandwich made for a great meal. Made with rye bread, pastrami, kraut, swiss, and easy island dressing, this sandwich was packed with tons of flavor and an overwhelming amount of meat. The pastrami was a bit salty at times, but still a hit overall. Will definitely need to come back and try their hyped up sausages and pretzel bread next time around!\\n\\nOne last note, our table was right in front of the DJ and I was literally shouting at my friends all night.

The flavor of the cheese, sauce and toppings are wonderful (try the meatball as a topping!). We had the garlic cheese bread which was also good. Average service with a small dining area that reminded me of the old Sbarro's at the mall you could sit down in. The price is decent ($18 for a XL pie with 3 toppings) and the slices are so large that you have to fold them in half to eat them.

Unfortunately I've had more bad experiences at Crisp than good ones. I keep going back and hoping it will be that day when they do it right, but today I think I was disappointed for the final time. Inconsistency is my biggest frustration with Crisp (for the price, they can't afford to be inconsistent). The experience depends on who is working, which doesn't inspire a lot of faith when I'm deciding whether I want to drive 20 minutes and look for parking near Williams St. On 3 occasions, I have arrived home and discovered that at least one ingredient was left out of my salad. When the ingredient they are leaving out ends up being the protein (which happened once), it is especially aggravating. On 2 occasions my dressing was left out (this happened to my boyfriend once as well), and when I went in a couple of weeks ago and ordered the Chicken Caesar, there was virtually no lettuce in my salad - it was seriously a little bit of lettuce and a bowl full of croutons an chicken. I wish I had taken a photo of the pile of croutons that cost me $15. Today I ordered the \\"bigger\\" size but they only filled the container 3/4 of the way, which is essentially the \\"big\\" size but more expensive and not enough food if I'm hungry enough to order \\"bigger.\\" This is not the first time this has happened with the size - it's not even the 3rd time. This has happened countless times. I'm not sure why they think it is acceptable to hand me a salad that is clearly smaller than what they are charging me for, but they do it happily every time. Nobody took a look at my 3/4 full container and thought that maybe they better make it right before handing it over? They can't even blame it on the lettuce settling because they hand it to me looking like this immediately after making it. I'm not comfortable making a fuss because I worked customer service for 20 years, so I just take the salad and leave frustrated every time. This is my first review on Yelp. I don't usually take the time to complain publicly, but today I'm done being passive and frankly, I'm done giving Crisp multiple chances to get it together. My boyfriend had more than one inconsistent experience as well, and he refuses to eat there with me anymore. When you charge almost $15 for a salad, you need to make sure that you are giving quality and proper quantity. Crisp, I really want to like you! Unfortunately, I can't afford to fork over $15 for a mediocre food experience multiple times each week - which is about how often I've been coming lately.

In general, the fried chicken was really dry to eat and didn't have too much flavor if you ate it without the sauce. Definitely was a fan of the roti with its distinct chewiness and taste. For the sticky rice, it was a bit too dry and the curry itself was too salty. One downer about this combo was the temperature. My friend and I ordered similar combos and both of us got it lukewarm to cold. My friend was also told that these combos are often made ahead of time, hence, this could explain the temperature. \\n\\nOther things to note: Love the policy of ordering first before you can take a seat!

Sauce was not to overpoweringly sweet and had the right amount of heat to it... The rice and beans were yum! I tend to like sticky rice and this was perfect for me, beans were well seasoned and the corn was DELISH...\\n\\nI also have to mention that Floyd's has a fairly decent amount of craft beers available both on tap and bottled. Funky Buddha Hiefenweizen was my choice and I enjoyed the light citrus take on my palate. \\n\\nDessert was the banana pudding OMG!!!!! enough said :)\\n\\nPrices aren't dirt cheap but it's not extreme. $15 for a well sized entree is reasonable to me.

It doesn't move very quickly, and the overall wait was about 30 minutes. Once you reach the front of the line, you realize that it is so long because most people try tons of different flavors before deciding. Can't really blame them because many of the flavors are so unfamiliar, but it's a bit annoying to be standing behind someone licking their 12th or 13th tasting spoon when you're already pretty sure of what you want. Not sure how to improve the process other than size and number of employees, both of which seem pretty maxed out already.\\n\\nWith that said, the staff were all quite friendly. I ordered a vanilla malt and the others in my party ordered a variety of other flavors in cones and cups. The waffle cones are freshly made, which is pretty neat.

Beginning with the music and overall style and ending (most importantly) with the food, I'm just not into it. I'd been in once before for a drink but most recently had some food that was EXTREMELY disappointing. I ordered the tuna spring rolls & vegetarian nachos. Both sound delicious and decadent but they were equally bland.\\n\\nThe tuna spring rolls barely had any tuna but most notably, they were filled with lettuce and soggy/poorly cooked RICE. Why on earth would you stuff a spring roll with rice? I wonder if they were kind of mimicking the burrito concept? Whatever the case, it just didn't work. And even if it did work, at LEAST cook the rice properly! The lettuce was disconcerting as well.. I don't like the concept of typically crisp/fresh veggies like lettuce or cucumber being cooked in hot oil. Finally, the rolls were not fried at a proper temperature because they were soggy and oily instead of crisp. Ah, and they came w/ a side of napa cabbage slaw that was also poorly seasoned and unflavorful.\\n\\nThe vegetarian nachos looked promising. I loved the quality of the chip & the overall quality of the ingredients (namely, the cheese), but they were totally dry (no guac/pico de gallo or anything moist). Also, they had some unseasoned/plain cabbage on them which seemed like a missed opportunity (for flavor and moisture.. wish it was pickled cabbage, for example). Wasn't impressed.\\n\\nIf I never come back here again, I won't mind at all-!\\n\\nImportant to note however, that my dining companions had a burger and really enjoyed it.

I was lucky enough that the line was not out the door. When ordering, the people are friendly and gave me buzzer when my food is ready. However, I think my buzzer was broken. It kept on buzzing on and off when my food was not ready. \\n\\nFood/Sauce: They have a variety of fried chicken and sauces. I ordered two 5 piece chicken tenders. My boyfriend ordered a salad and tenders with a bunch of sauces as well.  If you know me, I love my hot sauces. I ordered the entire hot 'n' spicy sauces: chipotle ranch, nashville hot honey, peri peri, habanero hot sauce, spicy mayo, and sweet sriracha bbq. After trying each sauce with my chicken tenders, it was a disappointment. It was not \\"hot\\" at all. It was more like a mild/medium-hot sauce.

Drink one glass of house wine and split one appetizer--both Yelp SXSW specials. Really, that was the plan. \\n\\nWell, three glasses of sparkling wine later, I ordered the three course meal ($30).  Wow!  Seriously delicious. The three courses consisted of ahi tuna, chicken confit with sugar snap peas, little onions, and farro, and a molten chocolate cake for dessert. I loved every bite of every item.  The chicken was particularly tender, juicy, and flavorful, and the sides really complimented the dish. I'm still having dreams about that cake. While I spent more than I planned to, I didn't really mind. I'm happy to support businesses who value excellence and try to do something a little different.    \\n\\nIn addition to the exemplary cuisine, Taste boasts an extensive wine selection.  If you're not sure what you want, that's okay.  They have a little testing area where an automated dispenser can provide you with samples of wines in many price ranges. Not being an expert on wine, I appreciate this concept.  Not only is it a novelty, but it would prevent me from wasting money on a bottle of wine I'm not fond of.  I can try a few ounces of a few different wines, then make my decision accordingly. \\n\\nThe atmosphere at Taste is upscale but not \\"fancy.\\"  The walls are brick, the ceilings high, the light fixtures unique, and the decor dark, rich woods. I wore a nice dress, as did my friend and quite a few other patrons.  Men mostly wore jeans and button down shirts. Actually, the attire was a bit Dallas-esque, which I actually enjoy from time to time.  :)\\n\\nAlso of note--\\nHolly P. and I shared the meal but incurred no split plate charge even though they split everything in the kitchen. \\n \\nAnd Taste does take reservations."},{"name":"Beast","address":"5425 NE 30th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Don't get me wrong, the food is good.

It was $6 for a champagne glass of OJ - if I've known, I would get mimosa for $2 more.\\n\\nAs for dinner, we went on a Thursday, 8:45 seating.  We got there a few minutes early and weren't allowed to sit yet.  By the time the meal start, it was almost 9pm.  Water was room temperature on an awkward vase-like water vessels.

We didn't get out til after 11:30.  Definitely slower than the early seating because they were out before 8:30pm.  They didn't start plating the next course until everyone finishes the previous course.  I would think a slight overlap would be better.

First off, finding the restaurant was a little bit tricky. We parked in the parking deck, but the sign on the building had us confused. Do we go inside and then turn right? Do we stay in the parking deck and walk to the right? Wait, but that's the resident entrance. To make it easier for everyone who is as clueless as we were, Saltyard is right across the street from where Lusca used to be. Our dinner was at 6 pm due to the colleagues' jet lag and the restaurant was empty, which is to be expected. Repeating the sentiments of other reviewers, the decor is nice yet casual.\\n\\nNow onto food and drink. Sundays are half off bottles of wine, but we stuck with beer and cocktails. The beer list is mostly comprised of Georgia beers, so that was nice. No complaints on the drink front. Food-wise, we ordered the bacon-wrapped dates, poke tacos, steak tartare, pear bruschetta, corn muffins, brussel sprouts, mushrooms on toast,  pork empanada, and the pork cheek special. The only dish that really stood out were the poke tacos, which had a nice crunch and spicy kick to them. The rest of the dishes were just inoffensive. I should note that the pork cheek took about fifteen minutes to come out after we were finished eating. That said, either the prep time for the dish or the firing time can be improved upon, but it was a special for the day, so I guess they get a pass.\\n\\nAll in all, Saltyard is an ok restaurant. The food is fine, the service is fine, but sadly, nothing was all that memorable."},{"name":"Downlow Chicken Shack","address":"905 Commercial Drive","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Met up with a few friends I hadn't seen in ages.

There was still a line when we left. The wait was about 20 minutes to order and we were lucky to snag a table inside. Water is self serve. \\n\\nThe menu is all about chicken; chicken by the piece, the sando, tenders, all the combos and chicken & waffles. You can choose from 5 heat levels (mild, medium, hot, extra hot and side of milk).\\n\\n- 6x Big wing Wednesday ($2.00 each) - we decided to try half a dozen of \\"hot\\" level wings. These are just as described and not your typical dinky wings. Crispy, thick and the hot was a perfect heat level. The white bread and pickles weren't my favourite. \\n- Tenders ($9.00 small) - comes with one sauce (we chose honey mustard). Tenders were fantastic. Perfectly breaded and juicy. These are chicken tenders elevated. \\n- Two by four ($22.00) - 4 boneless thighs and two sides. We picked the fries and mac salad. I had heard great things about the fries but found them average. Mac salad was cold and bland. I'd skip on the sides. That being said, the thighs were top notch. \\n\\nGlad we finally tried out Downlow but don't have a hankering to come back. 3.5 stars."},{"name":"Tuscana Resort Orlando by Aston","address":"1395 Tuscana Ln","city":"Davenport","stars":"2.5","text":"Condo furnishings are dated and broken.

It was it a little bit Bland to me but  the  waitress brought a jalapeno hot sauce and a habanero hot sauce, both which were very excellent and added a kick that was needed . My taco was the star of the show. I wish I ordered five of them. The Carnitas were  real crispy and very flavorful and the cilantro and onions that were put on top added a nice crunch.\\nMy husband got a stewed shrimp dish. He said it was good but when I tasted it I thought there was too much cumin in it.  It overpowered the whole dish. \\nMy daughter who is vegetarian got a combination plate as well that had a potato enchilada, a mushroom quesadilla, and a bean and cheese burrito.

I called ahead to reserve seating, and was informed that although the dining room was booked, we could reserve a seat at the oyster bar.  As Chris R. pointed out, this was a really neat experience, as we were able to watch the pastry chefs working their magic on some awesome desserts, and they were more than willing to interact with us on questions about the food they were making.  \\n\\nBefore we even made it to the restaurant, they had put out an update on Facebook, alerting everyone to Ron's newest beer creation, which was watermelon beer.  Obviously, this had to be tasted, and was a nice, refreshing change of pace from the more standard beers.  This is going to be a great feature at the restaurant, as he is free to really explore so many types of beers, it seems there is a new one every few days.\\n\\nAs for the food, we ordered the Mac and Cheese, and the Hot Brown for starters.  The Mac and Cheese was phenomenal, with a small hint of mustard that really made it taste great.  The Hot Brown was slightly disappointing, but overall, not bad as it had good flavor.  For entrees, I decided to make the Ham Sampler a full meal.  That was amazing stuff, as each ham was progressively aged longer, leading to a great experience of what the waiter termed \\"basic to advanced\\" ham.  The biscuits were awesome (we were watching them get made from out seat), and the pepper jelly complimented them most excellently.  My wife went for the Fried Bologna, which was a very interesting take on the old college standby, accompanied with some incredibly seasoned (and marinated) kale.\\n\\nObviously, this evening was not going to be complete without dessert staring us right in the face all night.  We decided that since we had struck up some great conversation with a gentleman sitting next to us, we would all order something and share it.  We ordered the Mud Pie, a Candy Sampler, and the Wit Beer Donunts.  The Mud Pie was a bit rich for my liking, but the Donuts were outstanding.  The custard that was paired with them was truly one of the best desserts I have had in quite some time.  The candy sampler was equally delicious, as it included some salted caramel that they had been working on while we were eating.  This stuff just melted in your mouth.\\n\\nOverall, a great experience, the decor is really nice, and the food lived up to what I was hoping for.  A word of caution though, getting in and and out of the this area is truly an accident waiting to happen.  Many people narrowly missed getting hit by oncoming traffic while trying to enter the parking lot.  Just be aware that this is an issue, and attempt to come in on the side of the street the restaurant is on, or enter at your own risk."},{"name":"Jester King Brewery","address":"13187 Fitzhugh Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"The operation here is quite impressive. They've got things down to a science basically. From the moment you drive in, you're blown away with the space and organization. They had people working the parking lot and directing you to spots, which was very appreciated. This ranch is expansive and could be confusing, but they've got people everywhere being helpful! We saw the line to the bar inside and were directed to a tent in the opposite direction for a shorter wait with virtually almost all of their beers as well. We opened a tab and chose a bunch of beers in the 4oz (flight) size. My favorite and really the only beer I liked was the \\"Colour Five.\\" It is a blueberry sour and it was magnificent. This beer was also quite pricey at $9 for 8oz. EEEK. \\n\\nDespite the pricey beer, this is a legit Sunday funday spot. Some people were having birthday gatherings, lots of people brought their children so it appears to be kid friendly and also dog friendly. There were hundreds of people here, yet it never felt crowded and there was more than enough seating for the masses. And thankfully they had Stanley's Farmhouse pizza because we got hungry and ordered some pizza. For those who don't do beer, they had plenty of wine options as well.

My friends and I went to this location after a later dinner at Radar. We were fortunate and didn't have to park too far away; I was so grateful for the short walking distance. \\n\\nPreviously, I went to the more crowded location on Mississippi Street (I think that's where it was), but I had never been to this location before. My friend recommended this one because it's usually less crowded. The line definitely wasn't out the door; it merely went for a short loop inside the store. Though the evening was chilly, that wasn't about to stop me from indulging in that creamy goodness. \\n\\nI especially wanted to visit Salt & Straw during this particular month (February) because of the store's chocolate flavor series. There were featured flavors of the month that appealed to me ... and I know I wouldn't be able to try them again. \\n\\nMy friends and I were able to peruse the menu while we stood in line, but the line moved quickly. All of the elements of Salt & Straw that I loved from the other location were still at this one -- the warm and friendly customer service, and of course, the ability to try as many samples as I wanted before making a decision. My mind is usually made up by the time I get to the sampling part, but sometimes, I end up altering my decisions based on the samples.\\n\\nI was so glad to experience another Salt & Straw store, and it's good to keep this option in mind if you're looking for someplace a little less crowded. It didn't seem like there was much seating here, but my friends and I were able to score part of the table to enjoy our treats.\\n\\nHere's what we got: \\n\\n\\"Woodblock Chocolate's Single Origins Chocolate and Coffee\\": This was the specific flavor that I wanted to try, and it was part of the February flavor series. The sample I had confirmed that this flavor was every bit as good as it sounded on the menu. It featured a delicate balance of coffee and chocolate and I enjoyed a hint of both in every scoop. Though it costs a bit more to get a split scoop, I just paid the extra fee so I could enjoy this one as well as the \\"Stumptown\\" coffee flavor, which still reigns as my favorite from Salt & Straw. I was so glad I got to try this Woodblock Chocolate + Coffee flavor while it was available. \\n\\n\\"Missionary Chocolate's Coconut Cinnamon Chipotle Rocky Road\\": One of my friends got this flavor as a single scoop in a cone. I had a bite of it and I did enjoy the taste of rocky road. I didn't order this one for myself because I'm not a fan of coconut, and even though the flavor itself wasn't overwhelming, it did still have that hint of coconut. My friend really enjoyed the medley of flavors, though, saying that the cinnamon chipotle really added to the mix. \\n\\n\\"Pear with Blue Cheese\\": My other friend always gets this flavor in a cone, and it's probably one of the most unique concoctions from Salt & Straw. You get the sweetness from the pear and the distinct blue cheese taste, but it's more subtle and it actually pairs really nicely together. If you don't have a huge sweet tooth and want something a little more savory--or are just feeling more adventurous--I would highly recommend this flavor. The only reason why I don't get it is because I can never turn down a chocolate option. \\n\\n\\"Stumptown Coffee and Burnside Bourbon\\": This is my favorite flavor from Salt & Straw ... hands down. I usually get a split scoop of this and another flavor, but I like it so much because it has a strong coffee flavor. It's creamy and rich, just like you're enjoying a cup of coffee but in ice cream form. I really love Salt & Straw because of their quality, but also because the ice cream never melts fast. I feel like I can actually savor the flavors and taste all the elements, instead of just trying to rush before I have a sticky, gooey mess on my hands."},{"name":"NFA Burger","address":"5465 Chamblee Dunwoody Rd, Inside the Chevron, Salim Thobani's Chevron","city":"Dunwoody","stars":"4.5","text":"Don't eat here if you have high blood pressure!\\n\\nFirst, let me start with the burger.

You've always managed to provide me with some pretty decent bar food. Hey, remember that time you put mango chutney in your tuna melt? That was fun, right? And I know that you, or your staff in this case, likes to smile. I've seen them do it! And hey, we all make mistakes right? What's a few extra drink charges between friends? As long as we're both polite about it, we can work it out! So simple! \\n\\nMJ, this is why we need to talk. What's going on here man? What's with this animosity towards the Seaport area? Here's the deal, you're one of the only games in town. Or, at least this part of town. There's not a lot of mid-level bar/restaurants in this area, unless of course you go into Southie proper. And the places around here that could be your competition? Well, MJ, they're not doing so hot. Atlantic Beer Garden's struggling a bit. The Seaport Bar and Grille is better known for their deck than for their bar or their grille. This could be your chance to shine! Come on man, I know you have it in you! \\n\\nSo here's my advice: First, tell your waitresses to drop the attitude. It only takes 17 muscles to smile, yadda yadda yadda, whatever, I don't really care about their face muscles. I'm not asking for beauty pageant grins here, but I could do without the eye rolling and pouts. Second, let's try to get that food out hot. With the exception of the curry fries (great job on those by the way. Seriously, cravings), everything I've had here has been lukewarm. Third, could we not insult my intelligence? Or in this case, sobriety. I know the difference between 3 and 5. Please don't tell me I've had 5 drinks when we both know I've only had 3. 3 means I'm still sober! So when you try to pad my bar tab, I'm probably going to notice! What's that? You weren't trying to pad it? No problem, like I said, we all make mistakes.

Perfectly seasoned and I liked that it was slightly aged.  \\n\\nI came here to sing praises of Cabbage and Carrots, tarragon yogurt, cured yolk, berbere, 'pretentious flowers,' and olive pur√©e. I absolutely hate carrots. I leave a pile of carrots behind anytime it has carrots in anything. I only eat carrots when they're candied (yeah, it's literally cooked and coated in sugar). The dish is visually stunning. Absolutely one of the most beautifully plated dishes I've ever seen. I tried to eat around them and I just couldn't. They were like these mini cute AF carrots. It was kind of the star of the dish so I gave it a try. \\n\\nIt changed my life fam. \\n\\nI think these were some magical unicorn carrots. They were very tasty, tender, and not overwhelmingly sweet with every bite. Berbere gave just enough spice and beautiful coloring to this dish. The flowers were delicious; they gave excellent texture and delicacy to the dish and also added a bright splash of whimsical color to the dish as well. \\n\\nI could've eaten five more of these dishes. I must say everything on the menu was fantastic and the best parts were the vegetable sides. I was more excited about the vegetable sides than some of the protein (and the pork belly was ridiculously soft, melt straight in your mouth, gooey, crunchy, and tasty). The vegetables were some of the best that I've ever had. I don't think I've had vegetables that just stood out so much that it overshadowed proteins. \\n\\nDesserts were phenomenal.

Their Sambhar was very flavourful and had good thickness to it, which is how it should be traditionally. \\n\\nTheir kadhai Paneer was bad, too much oil and just a ton of spices that were really ruining the overall taste. The mango dal on the other hand didn't look like it had enough salt and spices to it. The idlis were flat super flat! I'm not used to eating flat idlis so didn't like these either. Utappas on the other hand were very good and tasted even better with their tomato chutney. Their carrot kheer was a joke, literally it had shredded carrot floating in sweet milk. Typically kheer is thick because the milk is boiled for a long time to get a creamy consistency for kheer. I'm not sure if there's a specific region in India that makes carrot kheer but I've never heard of it before. Not sure if they were going for a fusion between carrot halwa and kheer? \\n\\nThe non vegetarian items including chicken and goat biryani were very good according to my friends, they really enjoyed all the rest of the items. \\n\\nPS: if I'm going to remember this restaurant, it would be for their slippery floor!"},{"name":"The Yaletown Distillery Bar + Kitchen","address":"1131 Mainland Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Honestly I took 5 friends from Minnesota to the bar.

I got to experience it first during an annual passholder sneak preview and I was shocked at how good it was. Satu'li Canteen doesn't offer the typical fried foods you would expect.  It's generally healthy and reasonable priced food that is actually quite delicious.  More than once during my meal I thought, \\"Wow, I would order this in a restaurant.\\", which was such a surprise.  For the bowls you select a base (such a quinoa), a protein, and sauce (such as chimichurri). They even put some boba on top for a garnish! They also have unusual items such as steamed cheeseburger buns (the Asian type of buns, not hamburger buns). The dessert cakes are the perfect size for a nice treat but not big enough to be a caloric disaster. \\n\\nI was set to give Satu'li Canteen five stars after my visit but I wanted return again after they had mobile ordering enabled.  It made me love this place even more.  Using the My Disney Experience app I was able to construct our order and inform them that we were at the restaurant.  We then just relaxed at a table we found.

So you don't fight the bone?  That's the best.  I went with some friends.  I got the Two by Four (4 Boneless Thighs, 2 sides).  For sides we got The Fries with Medium Dust and the DL Sauce and I wanted Mac Salad but they were out (must be bomb) so instead they had a potato salad.  Damn that potato salad was so good.  I was surprised by the amount of fries for the side.  There was a HELLA a lot of fries for a side.  The DL sauce was kinda like a spicy mayo it was dope.  On to the chicken, those bad boys were resting on slices of bread what other chicken place do you see that?  Nowhere.  It's not a bad thing at all because the oil and the juices from the chicken soak up into the bread and then you get tasty bread and then you become satiated with all that you ate.  Oh yeah and you got some pickles on top of that.  Nice contrast.  Ok now I will get to why it's 4 stars.  When I walked around in there the floors had a layer with what seemed like the breading or the flour they used on the chicken.  It was like the floors haven't been mopped or sweeped in a very long time so flour is white but the flour layer on the floor was brown and so it was just gross visually and also walking feeling this layer on your shoes.

I think of the Robot Fraternity from Futurama, and the Dean constantly yelling \\"Robot House!\\" But unlike, Robot House, The Picnic House is not about shenanigans or endless drinking [though they have some great options!], they serve delicious and beautifully presented food within an elegant and fun atmosphere. \\n\\nWhile perusing the town of Portland earlier in the day, we walked past The Picnic House, and with a quick glance inside, I made the comment to my fellow friend-traveler that it looked very cute and sophisticated inside, and that we should attempt a dinner there. It just happened to work out later that evening, as we were lying in our hotel room, that we stumbled upon it on Yelp, and decided to make a reservation.  Good thing we did too; once making it inside, the group in front of us was told it was a 45 minute wait. Utilize the online reservation booking! \\n\\nI came in craving veggies, so after looking over the menu, I decided to go with the Beet Salad [Beets, Goat Cheese, Pomegranate, Beet Dust] with a side of their soup of the day: Butternut squash.  My friend went with the Macaroni and Cheese - an option I was very pleased with, as I was also able to try it.  \\n\\nThe salad was excellent. Goat cheese on anything is amazing, and it very much added to the salad. It was a cute little fall mix of beets, pomegranate seeds and arugula/kale. Their also-fall themed soup, the Butternut Squash, was a nice addition to my dinner, and I will successfully declare that I ate everything that was put in front of me. With no regret.   The Macaroni and Cheese was absolutely delectable. With truffle oil, squash and the obligatory amount of cheese, the two bites of this dish that I had stuck with me all night. It was extremely rich, and after consuming almost the entirety of his meal, my friend was very full and bloated, and had become walking Mac and Cheese. [Lesson: split this dish and a salad with a friend, or take half of it home.]\\n\\nAnd again! Another huge plus for me: The Picnic House uses a ton of local and organic ingredients in their food. I love it. \\n\\nThe atmosphere within the Picnic House is enjoyable. It's darkly intimate, with fun decorations and tall curtains. I did feel like the most popular people in the joint however, because we were placed at a table where the surrounding guests could easily talk with us and eye our food. It wasn't particularly bad - just less able to have a one-on-one conversation with your food partner/friend/lover/etc. In the back area, it was very French-style seating, that's for sure. \\n\\nThe Picnic House supplied us with a tasty, and somewhat heavy meal. The prices really were not bad at all for the amount of food we got, as well as the great service. [And I'm always willing to pay a little more for locally sourced items in restaurants]. The Picnic House inspired warm feelings when filling my stomach with healthy ingredients/foods, and reminding me of Futurama. \\n\\nTL;DR:\\nRobot House! Er... I mean Picnic House!! PH provided us with a lovely dining experience; great and friendly staff, yummy food, and a unique ambiance.  With locally sourced ingredients, and nice prices, Picnic House is a great stop in Portland. Walk the town, online book a reservation for later in the evening, watch a few Futurama episodes, and then head over to the Picnic House for a deliciously enjoyable night of dining."},{"name":"Winsor Dim Sum Caf√©","address":"10 Tyler St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Came here at 1:30pm on a Friday for lunch with my mom and uncle and got a table immediately.

Not the best dim sum I've had in my life (relative to my pretentious I've-been-to-Hong-Kong standards) but definitely above average for Boston and New York. Rather than carts that roll around, you order off a sheet a la carte (similar to how you order at hot pot places) and they bring you the food. I actually prefer this method as you don't have to battle a mob for a cart that just got stocked and the food is super fresh. You can tell the roast pork buns and beef rice noodles were just freshly steamed, giving it such a nice and fluffy texture, and the shrimp rolls and sesame balls just came out of the fryer, and they have this piping hot crispy exterior.

For entrees I got a basic cheeseburger with extra cheese and fries cooked perfectly nice and pink/red and juicy with fries.

The shrimp scampi was not good at all, and there's the problem, it was also expensive, almost every dish was really pricy, so if ur on a budget this month i would look elsewhere to eat, i assume the reason for high price is the location of the place, being in downtown might raise the prices on the menu.

The taco that you get for $6 was tiny, almost bite size, but very good. We never received one of the tacos that we ordered. She never came over to see how our food was during any course. We had empty drinks by the time we started eating our meal. Luckily the woman with the water pitcher came to fill our glasses. Finally got our server's attention and told her the taco was missing.

After eating breakfast at places like Snooze in Colorado and Goldie's In Boise you get spoiled a bit I suppose. Maybe that's why this meal was so disappointing. Every course was minuscule, it made me think that this was a tapas bar instead of a breakfast place. Our first courses were good, but nothing stood out as mind blowing. The drinks were all fine, nothing stellar nothing horrible. My friends frittata was a mess of oil and onions, really strange and not yummy at all. My brothers partner had the meal of the table the steak and eggs and it was excellent (hence 2 stars instead 1), my biscuit and fried chicken was nothing compared to Pine State, or my own for that matter. My mothers sunny side up egg with spinach tasted fine but was a little watery. \\n        In summation this place simply seems overrated. Maybe we came on an off day.

Really one of the top restaurants in Austin and quite a good location if staying downtown on vacation.  Lots of shared tables and bar seating, but some pre-reserved seats as well.  Might be worth to ask for a certain table when reserving, else you'll be eating quite communally.\\n\\nThe meal will run you a typical high quality, tapas type meal.  Cocktails $13, beer $6-9.  Cocktail list creative, especially the ice ball cocktail that melts as you drink which is very unique.  Beer list very large and offers more than just Austin-based, different from most restaurants in town.  Food comes out well-paced and everything is delicious . The apricot draper and rye not are fine but could be a bit boozier.  The old fashioned ice ball is a must order and you can even get extra shots if you're sipping too fast.  For food, of course start with the pop rocks edamame.  Very sharable, and although you'll probably get bored of the pop rocks feeling a few in, the edamame themselves are warm and large so good app on its own with the chili coating adding a bit of heat.  Brussel sprouts were fine and probably could have used some more grilling.  Lightly cooked with pickled onions and raisins.  Sauce at the bottom of the dish makes the taste go round, so make sure you scoop that Thai sauce onto each bite for optimal taste.    Entrees were star of the meal.  Special grilled salmon came with tons of veggies and grilled broccolini.  Just a good fish with grill marks - tasty and healthy option.  The Korean flank steak was honestly one of the best dishes I've had since coming to Austin.  Definitely get the fried egg on top and ask for some gochujang sauce for the side to make this a truly Korean dish.  Steak itself was cooked perfectly with slight red middle.  Rice cakes had hint of kimchi with crispy rice on outside, making this a pseudo-brunch dish at dinner time.  Super filling and just greatness with each bite.  Not too Korean flavor-wise, so don't expect overly garlic bites.  Just a very nice dish that delivers for a steal $25.  Tres leches dessert a great option for those wanting to try a few things for dessert.  Chocolate and mousse and tres leches combo works here and I'd say the mousse actually takes the cake for this course.\\n\\nSwift's Attic continuously delivers.  Glad they reopened and will be back for every meal.  Dishes are small enough that you can keep coming back and trying new things without overwhelming yourself.  Reservation probably needed, but with some bar seating I bet you could sneak in off hours.  Happy hour until 6:30 and they offer some smaller snacks not on main dinner menu as well as burger.

It's amazing!\\n\\nI don't think I have ever tried anything so damn delicious.  I could swim in an ocean of this soup and die of happiness.  It's that good.  You absolutely have to try it.\\n\\nBasically it's a tortilla soup (chipotle pepper, diced avocado, cheese and house sour cream)\\n\\nThe way it is served is the best part.  You basically put your spoon in the bowl, grab some of the melted cheese at the bottom, a bit of tortilla chips, and some avocado, stick it in your mouth, and you're in heaven.\\n\\nThe avocado just melts in your mouth like butter.  The base of the soup itself is not watery, but not thick either.  It is the perfect balance of tomato-chipotle flavour, and you just want more and more of it.  They're able to do take-out with this soup too, and it's just as good.\\n\\nAlso, try their Margaritas.  I usually go for a Lime Margarita on the rocks.  You can get it blended if you like, but I find you get more out of it the way I order it.  It's not a weak drink either, it's the perfect Margarita.  I've gone to so many places and they manage to screw up Margarita's all the time.  Either by making it way too watery/weak or too much ice.  Salsa & Agave makes it the right way.\\n\\nSome of the other items on the menu I have yet to try, but so far, the tacos are good (4 for $10, best type is carnita), burritos, nachos, gringa (quesadilla) are all terrific!\\n\\nThe restaurant has seating both inside and on their patio outside.  Perfect for summer.  It can get quite busy later on in the evenings, so I like going mid-afternoon.  That way you don't have to worry about seating and you'll be served pretty fast.

One sells beer by the glass and the other sells chilled bottles.\\n\\nI grabbed a 750ml bottle while my friend ordered several pours of different types of brew. The beer is fermented or \\"sour\\" beer. If you haven't had sour beer it's different from the beer you're used to.

Especially if you throw in some sides too. I really liked the flavor of the chicken al pastor taco. I'm a huuuge fan of cilantro so that was an immediate plus. It had lots of fresh flavors because of the watermelon radish and pineapple salsa.   I probably shouldn't have ordered the Butter chicken taco with this. It just didn't sit well with me for some reason. Maybe because of the contrasting flavors or because I was full?  Also it is quite spicy with the jalapenos. I like spicy but I actually had to pull some off the taco as it was too much for me. The sides I ordered were excellent. The yucca fries with their \\"fancy sauce\\" is a must . I wasn't going to order another side until I heard the customer in front of me order 3 of the grilled corn on the cobs and simultaneously rave about them.   He was right. The mix of chili, lime and cotija cheese on the grilled corn couldn't be beat.   My husband had the Barbakoa Banh Mi and the fried plantains.

It was a HUGE disappointment.  This is what my partner has to say:\\n\\nI went to Beast last night to experience something new, something extraordinary, something that would challenge my preconceptions of fine dining. Maybe that is asking too much, however when one is paying $300.00 for two at least one should leave having experienced something competent. Sadly What I found was mass catering masquerading itself as fine dining. Amateurish dishes sold at an exorbitant price.\\n\\nWe showed before the appointed time of 8:45 pm. 8:45 was the time we were told to be there. We were prompt, and they weren't and they didn't seem to care. We were left standing outside in the cold as the wait staff slowly cleaned the cutlery and glassware watching us wait for them. We should have left then and there - but we waited. They could see us standing outside and their restaurant was empty yet they made us wait outside well past the appointed time with doors locked. Nice way to make a first impression.\\n\\nFinally we were let in. The chef at the counter greeted us with \\"How are you doing\\" I responded \\"Better now that we are allowed in from the cold\\". No apology was given nor concern shared for their tardiness. Those were the last words he spoke to us all evening long. I figured the silence was a Zen Meditation technique that he had mastered so that he may focus his culinary Chakra to prepare for us an even greater meal. However I don't think that is entirely necessary when most of what you are doing is just reheating pre-made food. We settled in. Our first course was a Mushroom Veloute' with Squab Broth. Decent, correct temperature yet neither stunning nor moving. Average yes, somewhere between Whole Foods Deli and The Olive Garden. I love Whole Foods, but I didn't come here for that.\\n\\nNow only if the wait staff would smile or at least show some glimmer of friendliness or gratitude that we were there. The staff was as inviting and interesting as wet cardboard. Hardly a smile, or any show of friendliness. I searched in vain for any sign of passion or joy. Perhaps they were tired being the second serving of the evening but then this is one of Portland most expensive dinning experiences and one should not have to find excuses for a disinterested staff. Perhaps that is the greatest fault I found: a lack of joy for cooking. It felt like a meal prepared by people who don't like food.\\n\\nNext came the Charcuterie plate that many have talked about. Most of the items did not jump out in any meaningful way. They were mostly just mediocre and one expects more. The Quail Egg Toast for instance was somewhat interesting, but most of the others were as interesting as Novocain.\\n\\nOnto the overly seasoned and salty Snake River Farms Hanger Steak, hardly successful with the Pommes Alumettes that were as inspired as deep fried battered dental floss that had been prepared hours in advance. Perhaps they were.\\n\\nThe next dish was a palette cleansing sorbet which was the only gem of inspiration in an evening a wash in a sea of culinary banality.\\n\\nWe then came to a very passable One Seared Sea Scallop with Prosciutto wrapped asparagus. There might have been a little extra seasoning from the spatter of the dish washing station next to the stove as a handful of the last batch of scallops was left unattended on the stove and I observed from my chef counter table vantage some of the spray hit the mark. Oh well. I will take that over the server that was plating the food, then handling a cleaning rag to wipe some items down and then continuing to plate without thinking of perhaps washing her hands.\\n\\nWe had the wine pairings and were poured 1/3 of a glass with each or less. Considering the price of the flight one would expect at least a decent pour. A couple of the pairings were passable. Most of the pairings were unmemorable and plain awful and considering you are paying $100.00 extra for a couple you should at least be matched with something more suitable from a competent sommelier. \\n\\nThat was followed by a selection of cheeses, selection is defined as three but that's O.K. of which only one was a stand out, a delightful chevre, the others were unexceptional and downright boring. And yes you get stale crackers.\\n\\nOur final course was a Chilled Coconut Tapioca. Again passable but nothing that would justify the reputation and accolades that this place has received. Certainly I can think of far better deserts around town.\\n\\nThere is nothing at Beast that makes one eager to return. I expected the exceptional but what I found was a myth that believes in itself and a hype that this restaurant does not deserve. It is overrated and overpriced. There are far better places, Le Pigeon, Imperial, Cabezon, Clarke lewis all come to mind. Not once did any of the staff ask \\"How's the food?\\" They seemed so bored as to not care.

As a Texan, I scoff and find myself personally irritated by most restaurants that conscript the long and exceptional barbecue history of my native country. I almost 100% irritated and indignant when I see the Lone Star flag of Texas slapped on a wall with a claim by restaurants, joints, and smokehouses that they serve \\"Texas BBQ\\".  Usually the first sign is the presence of pork bbq, followed by the absence of beef ribs, and red hot-links. The final indicator of a fraud upon the history of my bbq people comes at delivery. The absence of white onion, untoasted Texas toast bread, and pickles as a garnish tells me, \\"this aint like my daddy use to make\\". All of these things were present at Legacy Smokehouse, except one. The brisket on my sandwich WAS just like my daddy used to make in the greatest of all bbq states. The perfect balance of fat, moist, strong but not overbearing smoke taste, and large portions creates a Legacy for this place. \\n\\nLegacy Smokehouse is a Shangri-La for Texans living, vacationing, and passing through Central Ohio. Despite the lack of onion, pickles, no beef ribs or red hot links, the food was exceptionally Texan. Of course, this review is based only on one experience I feel extremely confidant in \\"unofficially certifying\\" THIS restaurant as a purveyor of Texas brisket. The brisket was prepared simply with only salt and pepper, smoked for 12 hours and generously piled on a brioche bun to satisfy my tastebuds and challenge my theory of Texas BBQ outside of Texas.\\n\\nI hope that others will support this uniquely qualified purveyor of the brisket culinary arts if nothing else but to allow Legacy Smokehouse to continue to be available to me when I return to OHIO.\\n\\nThe owner responded and reminded that onion and pickles were served.

I do have to give kudos to the fact that the cheese itself was very thick, implying that real cheese was used in the mac and cheese. Now the only issue was that the mac and cheese was *literally* just macaroni and cheese. No garnishes or seasonings at all. I had to add a bit of salt and actually some hot sauce (believe it or not, hot sauce in the mac and cheese elevates the cheesy experience and the heat often does not come into play) to get it to a real tasty level. One thing that kind of peeved me was that the mac and cheese was so obviously just roughly ladled into the bowl though (the mac and cheese was served so haphazardly). No attempt was made to make it in any way presentable (at least like, make it a uniform mound?). \\n\\nThe Mother Earth bowl was amazing. Fantastic spread of pan-fried veggies, cold arugula greens, roasted sweet potatoes, and this awesome hot chili sauce, all with quinoa and protein (my choice of tofu).

I live a few blocks away and I love the idea of a custom salad.vI have been a restaurant manager for nearly ten years and unfortunately, I could quickly see that if there is management, they have little to no experience on how to run a restaurant, or how to scout an appropriate location for their idea. Go by there after 3pm any day. It's dead. Then walk to any other place within a block. Busy. \\n\\nThe first three times I came in, I got the vegan caesar, as I am dairy and egg free. I appreciate their nice list of vegan dressings, although originally the coconut based dressing was said to be vegan, but come to find out had butter in it. The recipe was changed, but food allergies are no joke, and it felt wrong that it took three people to finally admit there was dairy in it. The first time I ordered the salad, it was decent, but the dressing was very tart. Watery and not caesar like. It was about $9, which was fine. Unfortunately, as others have noticed, their scoopers are tiny. You get mostly greens. The third time I came in, I asked for a different dressing, and to keep the tempeh but add steak. When I got home with my food, it had caesar dressing on the side which was wrong, and they forgot the tempeh. The salad came out to $13! That is just crazy. I can get some amazing food next door and around the corner for that price. The caesar dressing also tasted different. Not as tart. Not consistent with the first two times I had it. \\n\\nTheir greens aren't organic, which goes against their motto which includes, \\"Sourcing from local partners and farmers\\", and \\"You can feel good about what you're eating\\". There are so many local sources for organic produce around here.. I don't feel good about it. It's saving a buck. I decided to go buy some organic greens for $3 at the New Seasons Market nearby, and then purchased the ingredients for the vegan caesar to go at Crisp. I even added the steak which is $3.50, and my bill came out to $5. The last time I purchased the vegan caesar with steak, it was $13. To me that says that I am getting charged $7 JUST for their non organic kale. What a joke.\\n\\nThe owners are always around. They are always are on computers, hovering over their employees. I've learned over the years that this is not only uncomfortable for your customers, but also for your employees, who have all been wonderful. I feel bad that they have to work in the \\"line system\\" which leaves people waiting in line in silence for 5-8 minutes. Obviously the owners want customers to see their salads made in front of them, but people would rather pay, sit, and have someone bring the food out. Think about it, if you don't want people to see the small scoopers and skimpy ingredients everyone complains about, don't let them. At least have them relax with their drinks instead of seeing how much they are paying for how little they receive. \\n\\nOverall, a disappointment.

But when we sat down in the near-empty place and were handed the menus, I was surprised to see that it was purely a brunch menu. It had some of the same stuff as the lunch one, except it was missing (can you guess?) the black cod. Sad face. I asked about it, and the server replied that they only serve brunch on weekends, even though their website says lunch is served daily. Clearly it needs updating.\\n\\nWe were given some delicious bread that was warm and soft. And, since it was 1:30pm, we devoured it. Our food choices for the meal were: seafood chowder, chicken quesadilla, and a reuben sandwich. Despite the website saying that lunch is served until 2pm, our server quickly put our order through without fuss. The first to arrive (literally within a minute of placing the order) was the seafood chowder. I'll be frank, it was the pits. It wasn't bad tasting or anything, but it was basically cream soup with bits of carrots and celery and onions, ONE sushi-sized piece of salmon, and topped with a teaspoon-full of shredded crab meat. Not really what I pictured for seafood (especially when the menu said it would have clams, and when, you know, it's a seafood chowder). So that was a strike right there, for $9.\\n\\nThe quesadillas were better, though the avocados seemed more like guacamole to me (I didn't see any avocado shape, it was just mush). It was tasty though, and a good filler for an appetizer. The reuben was also a good choice, it was definitely filling and oozing with cheese. Their fries were probably the highlight of the meal - they were hot and crispy and salted just right. Okay for $14.\\n\\nAs we were paying the bill, we noticed a pricing error with the quesadillas from what we saw on the menu. We asked the server, who looked at it and said he would go check - but I suspect he only went to his online ordering system and noted the price from there. He quickly came back to say that the price on the bill was correct and then walked away. Husband had to go find an actual menu to show him the error. Strange reaction, the server told us the menu is old and needs to be updated, and the correct price is the one on the bill. I raised an eyebrow, but it didn't seem like he was going to budge and we didn't want to cause a scene, so we left it as is. \\n\\nLuckily for us, the waiter returned a few minutes later as we were about to sign our receipt with the difference in cash. A slight redemption.\\n\\nOverall, it's a nice place and I can see that it may be popular on the weekdays for lunch or perhaps during a nice dinner. It's probably a great choice for those staying at the Hyatt (I think that was the case for some of the diners there), though I don't know if I'll return."},{"name":"Mambo Italian Street Food","address":"2022 Powers Ferry Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"We came for Sunday brunch partially due to location and the sign outside their restaurant.

There was a huge selection of options but our server helped explain the options and we went with 2 mimosas, huevos rancheros and the green eggs and ham. \\n\\nHuevos rancheros: it was not the best one that I have had in the metro-Atlanta area but was very filling for the price. The tortilla was soggy and did not have the extra crisp. The serving size of black beans was extremely generous and the egg was perfectly runny -- and worked as a nice addition to the rest of the meal. Some of the potatoes were undercooked and the cook made sure to fully cook it and the server brought  it out to us fresh and crisp the second time around. The little pieces of fruit were a nice dessert/addition to the mimosas. \\n\\nGreen eggs and ham: it was a very hardy meal and was a great value for the price.

BF and I grabbed some breakfast the other day and it was disappointing, especially for a place that I used to love. We were seated after waiting half an hour and someone came by to grab our order rather quickly, but that was where the swiftness stopped. I have to imagine it was our waitress that caused the timing issue, as people around us, who sat after us received their food before we did. Annoying. I ordered a waffle with fruit and he ordered a triple double, which I suggest people avoiding. First off, the substitutions you can make are really silly. Instead of home fries you can either have spinach, avocado or fruit and thats it. No beans, no toast, no french fries, nothing else that other places might offer. When our food came out, we were somewhat disappointed. His 3 eggs scrambled really only looked like two eggs, and they seemed flat, cold and lifeless almost like they were pre-made. The bacon? Sad, small, cold, and not crispy. The only things he liked were the giant pancake and the fruit. My waffle? Just ok, seemed really dark, kind of cold and had no fluff, all crunch. I didn't have the patience to ask for a new one since I had to leave for work, so we just ate it and left. Overall our meal was $30, and for that price, I expect so much better. We also waited 40 minutes for our food. So, ya, quality dropped, and so did their service.

It's like its own world that has a small town type of feel with restaurants showcasing foods of all kinds, including tacos. At Holy Taco, you have to appreciate what they do by focusing on utilizing local and sustainable ingredients for its food. Probably because of this, the menu does rotate and change. \\n\\nI suppose a good thing about Holy Taco is that it's not located right on Flat Shoals so it's a bit easier getting parking here than for other areas of EAV. During peak hours in EAV, parking gets a bit tough. However, with Holy Taco, they have their own small lot and there's decent street parking close by. \\n\\nWith the weather slowly warming up, you can make use of the plentiful outdoor seating here. It's definitely a great place to hang out and it's pretty casual at Holy Taco. It seems like it's a solid to cure that hangover - I came here during lunch hours and I saw a few people slowly make their way in their pajamas.\\n\\nWith the menu changing and rotating, there's a chance that what you read about in the reviews may not be there. For example, I personally looking forward to trying the lengua and chicken heart tacos, but sadly was not there. No matter though - there's plenty of other options, including a vegan taco for those not interested in lamb, goat, pork, chicken, beef, or shrimp. The tacos range from $3.50 to $4.50 each and are decently portioned. If you're hungry, you should be fine with three to four tacos. I was able to try four tacos:\\n\\n- Sauteed adobe skirt steak with salsa Mexicana, and queso cotija // $4.25\\n- Barbacoa Tewksbury Farms young goat with caramelized cippoolini, guindilla pepper // $4.50\\n- Grilled gulf shrimp with pico de gallo, cilantro, and queso fresco // $3.75\\n- 12 hour roasted pork shoulder with Mexican slaw // $3.75\\n\\nThey all sound delicious, and honestly, they were decent and all of the meats were cooked well. However, they just that weren't that flavorful and none of them really blew me away with each bite. I think I'll probably have to come back and try some other tacos and see if ordering something different might change my mind.\\n\\nService here was great - attentive, but not overbearing. The food came out pretty quickly and I can't complain about the staff. \\n\\nOverall, it's probably worth a visit since there are plenty of people that do like this place, and I'll have to come back and see if the other taco fillings are better."},{"name":"Hat Yai","address":"1605 NE Killingsworth St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"This place came down to be my favorite place in PDX.

I savored my meal because of all the clear and interesting flavors.\\n\\nThe interior of the restaurant is clean and spare with several tasteful photos of Vietnamese street scenes.  Because it is a smaller space, the volume level of customers talking can be loud at lunch and dinner.

Nothing wrong with that! I'm Chinese and there are days when I crave for nothing except Panda Express.\\n\\nHowever, even for Americanized Vietnamese cuisine, there are some shortcomings. \\n\\n1) Ordered the pho #5 (rare beef and brisket) - The bowl came out with no rare beef, everything was well done and the meat portion was extremely lacking. The broth was basic and left a funny (in a bad way) aftertaste. If you know your broths, you will know that the house broth they have is from instant unami, MSG and cinnamon. Since Pho Oregon on SE 82nd still holds the crown for the best pho broth in Portland, if their broth was a perfect ten, Pho Zen's broth rates at about a 3/10.\\n\\n2) My date ordered a pho dac biet (the \\"super bowl\\") - same dilemma. Below average broth with a serious lack of meat portions. \\n\\n3) I ordered a rice vermicelli with lemongrass grilled pork and eggroll to round out the experience - great presentation as a whole, however you get about three bites of vermicelli before being drowned in raw bean sprouts (the photo I have is deceiving as the bean sprouts are all hidden). The \\"grilled\\" pork is not grilled - it is stir fried. I have ordered this dish enough times at various Vietnamese restaurants to know when a protein is stir fried or grilled. Pho Zen, your customers may be in for an Americanized Vietnamese cuisine experience, but they are not dumb. Accompanying fish sauce was bland as water. \\n\\nIn short; the low rating has nothing to do with the fact that this place is Americanized, but it is the way things are presented in the menu vs how they are really cooked (rare beef comes out to be well done, \\"grilled\\" pork is not really grilled but stir fried), the broth is below average (with a negative aftertaste) and the deceiving portion size (the protein in pho options and the overwhelming amount of raw bean sprouts tucked under a shallow layer of vermicelli noodles).\\n\\nAs for service; no one checked up on us after the food drop off. They weren't busy either. \\n\\nTheir food is below average but their restaurant ambiance is very nice - tasteful furnishings, high ceiling, clean bathrooms and a creative restaurant logo."},{"name":"Memphis Blues","address":"1342 Commercial Drive","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"THE best place to take a group of guys to eat.

We should have checked first what time it opened, because we just assumed it would be open. We got there around 2:30 and we were wrong -- it wasn't open until 3:00. But, you wouldn't know that by driving up to it. There was already a line formed in front of the restaurant, so we thought it was already open and those people were just waiting for a table. Nope! When I got in line, we were like the sixth party, and there was still a half hour to go! By the time the restaurant opened its doors, all the tables were filled.\\n\\nThe place is small... tiny, as a matter of fact. It reminded me of Ten Tables in JP. It probably seated 20-30 people maximum. The inside looks like a railroad car... very cute. Due to the limited space, the tables were a little close together. We had people behind us, in front of us, and to the side of us. Every time a chair was pulled out, we got hit... you know the deal. \\n\\nThe menu is quite extensive. In addition to their regular menu, they also give you a hand-written menu of specials that changes daily. I found the selections on the special menu to be better than those on the regular menu. We ended up ordering an appetizer of arancini, and then we each got a pasta dish.\\n\\nThe bread was OK, but nothing special. Same with the salad. The arancini though, was AMAZING! They were a little bigger than a golf ball, and even though we only got a half order, it was more than enough for two of us. We had to wait an exorbitantly long time for our entrees to come, but it was worth it! We both got fusilli, and in addition to being homemade, it was downright delicious. The portion was ENORMOUS! I mean, truly truly gigantic. If we had known this in advance, the two of us could have just split an entree (but, please note that I do believe they charge you to split an entree, so it'd be worth it to get two instead and take home the leftovers). The sauce, veggies, meat... everything was just so fresh and yummy. We both attempted to eat as much as we could, but after 15 minutes, gave up and took the rest home. I ended up having my pasta for three straight days at lunch before I was able to finish the whole serving. \\n\\nService was friendly, but slow. The people to the left of us finished their whole entire meal and left before we even got our entrees. Turnover was pretty quick... most people left in 30-45 minutes, and there was a constant line of people waiting outside to get a table. Thankfully, it was a nice day out.\\n\\nThe staff there did tell us that the owners also purchased the retail space across the street and plan on making that a bar/lounge area so that guests can enjoy a drink or two there while waiting for a table.

However a situation took place last night ( Sunday November 23rd) that unfortunately has questioned my support and further buisiness. \\n\\nLast night a group of friends and I went to sweethereafter for some food and drinks. I was the designated driver so I restrained from drinking and instead had the burger, (always delicious by the way)\\n\\nWe noticed that the door man (who's name I didn't catch though he is just under 6 feet, black short hair with neck and face tattoos) was abrasive and rude to us on the way in. I figured he was just having a rough day so I went forth without a second thought, that's when things took an interesting turn. \\n\\nWe sat in the window booth and watched as a friend of ours approached the bar and was smoking a vape as he walked up to the door. He then placed the vape in his pocket, grabbed his ID and tried to hand it to the door man, who refused to let him inside. When he asked why he couldn't be let in the door man said there's no vaping allowed at this bar, though my friend was vaping outside in the public, smoking allowed area. Still he refused to let him inside. \\nThen, my other friend stepped outside to speak with to the door man and have a cigarette, trying to understand the situation better. The door man then refused to let him back inside as well and claimed there was no re entry to the bar. No re entry? This is a public establishment open to the public until 2 am on regular buisiness days. There was no event this night, no cover charge, and no re entry was completely false. \\nSo when we chose to leave, because our friends were stuck waiting outside for us for no reason other then the door man decided he didn't like them and that he was the dominant, I went up to the bar to speak to the bartenders about the doorman. I asked about the no re entry, which they were completely baffled by. They said they knew I was a regular and completely agreed with me that this man was being abusive of his power and aggressive to people for no reason. I spoke with the manager who agreed with me as well and apologized. I said no worries, I just wanted to let the management know that this man is causing all of us to feel unwelcome and uncomfortable. \\n\\nWhen I turned around the doorman was standing behind me and listening to me talk to the bartenders about him. I nodded at him and turned to leave, when I was outside he followed me and shouted at me that I'm 86d and am never allowed in the bar again. \\nI turned to him and told him he has no right to do that to me and that he needs to learn some serious social skills. I've been a good paying customer for years and the management will not 86 me. He said that isn't true and they have me on camera to throw me out if I try to ever enter the bar again. \\n\\nI took one step toward him and he jumped back and said if you touch me that's assault and I'll have you arrested. \\nI am a 5 foot girl. It was absolutely insane. I do not back down from men with power trips. I stood my ground and asked him how he could act like this toward pleasantly sober people who just went in to have dinner and pay a decent amount of money to help support this business. He couldn't care less and turned, ignored me, flipped me off and walked inside. \\n\\nI love sweethereafter, I love everything about this wonderful bar. however I will not be treated like this and I hope that sweethereafter doesn't intend to keep someone around that questions the safety and welcoming vibe I know they want to maintain as a buisiness and as a social community."},{"name":"Chicken Guy!","address":"1506 E Buena Vista Dr, Ste A","city":"Lake Buena Vista","stars":"3.5","text":"Overall I never go to this place.

The salad was overly dressed but OK; both my son and I got the filets and they were cooked perfectly and were a lovely color but not seasoned at all and mine had a large piece of gristle through the middle making 1/3 of it inedible.   My husband ordered the ribeye which came out over done and looking funny- the part that was supposed to be red or pink was dark purple. He sent it back and the made another which was cooked OK but it was still purple. He wouldn't even try it but I did and the texture was not right. We eat ribeyes all the time and none have ever been like this. He ended up just eating his potato and part of my steak as he really didn't want anything else. And they did not have an explanation for the bad meat, just some shoulder shrugs and apologies. Explaining how they hand cut and age the meat. A quick google and we found that this is considered dark cutting beef and is very undesirable, how this got past quality control is beyond me, but maybe that is just the low quality of stuff they get? Sub choice? Yuck. And we know the difference between longhorn, outback and a prime steakhouse like Christners or Charlies.

LOCATION & PARKING: Using Google Maps or Waze, one shouldn't have any trouble finding this restaurant. It sits in between Savi Provisions and a Delta Credit Union location.\\n\\nRegarding parking, I suggest finding a spot on Peachtree Place NE. Download the Parkmobile app before getting there. \\n\\nII. FOOD & DRINK: Like many other Mediterranean joints, Cafe Agora offers rice plates, sandwiches, salads, and desserts, and various vegetable appetizers. The food, honestly, does not set itself apart from others, but I do think they can satisfy a fix. What I've had:\\n\\n*Fried Eggplant: Like the name says, this appetizer comes with fried eggplant as well as green peppers, tomato sauce, and garlic. It's basically a Mediterranean stirfry with a lot of flavors. I wouldn't necessarily recommend it, but if you love eggplant then give it a try for yourself.\\n\\n*Lamb & Beef Gyro: Call me basic, but I love this beef and lamb beauty wrapped in a pita bread. Topped with lettuce, onions and tzatziki sauce, it perfectly combines savory, crunchy, and fresh. The sauce could use more garlic, dill, and black pepper to bring a harder kick, but it did a well-enough job tying everything together. Consider ordering this!\\n\\n*Hummus: Their hummus -- consisting of mashed chickpeas, fresh lemon juice, mined garlic, olive oil, and tahini and garnished with ezme and tabouli -- is A-OK. I thought it could have been smoother and more flavorful. After having a few other hummuses in the city, though, I wouldn't call it one of my favorites. \\n\\nIII. SERVICE: During each of my visits, I've been called, \\"friend\\" and received my food promptly. I've never had any problems.\\n\\nIV. AMBIENCE & DECOR: In contrast to the rest of the Peachtree Street NE, this hole-in-the-wall seems to have endured the renovations in the area. (That's a good thing.) The humble interior has two floors, and, by the looks of the seating, the restaurant caters to the lunch crowd.\\n\\nV. PRICES: It's hard to complain about prices when most things on the menu cost less than $15. And when considering Cafe Agora resides in Midtown, it's a great bargain.\\n\\nVI.

The moment you walk in you get hit with a waft of smoked meats. The place always seems to be packed, but not overwhelmingly so; there's a nice and easy vibe that makes you feel welcome. Despite the large number of people, service was extremely quick and I was surprised to have my order brought to me within a few minutes. Staff is super friendly as well and I really appreciate a staff that gives you a genuine smile and makes recommendations for you even when they have a line out the door.\\n\\nI got the butter chicken tacos, pork belly tacos, and the shrimp and sausage tacos. All of them had interesting flavors but hands down the shrimp and sausage tacos are the best. Even though they cost an extra dollar per taco, the greek yogurt brings a mellow flavor and cohesion to the spiciness of the shrimp and the flavorful sausage. My buddy got the ribs which were nicely smoked albeit a little on the dry side. The sides we got were rice and black beans, which were decent but not spectacular.\\n\\nWhile I was there I had the opportunity to speak to the owner - a friendly bear of a man who you can't possibly miss at 6 and a half feet. This is his first restaurant, yet I extremely impressed by his attention to detail and his commitment to local produce. For example all of his meat comes from Ocala.

The ambiance is beautiful and there's often a live jazz band. However one evening I called 4 times to order ahead and no one picked up. My mind was set on having Chianti tonight since I thought about it my whole drive home. I came by and the jazz was blasting and such an awesome environment, while the place was packed on a Sunday night! That's probably why they didn't pick up the phones. I had an intense craving for it so I was able to order in person and continue to my pesto state of bliss. I just wish there was more pasta in the container, for $22 each time I come. Pasta is like $4. It is enough, or almost enough for 1 meal but if you sit down and eat then take the rest out you'll get more.

I suppose it may be because I've always been able to find any Asian items I needed at Fred Meyer usually.  However, recently the man and I have been experimenting with a more of a vegetarian diet due to some significant health issues that have arisen over the past couple of months.  The doctor gave him the wake-up call and said a change was needed and soon.  We found all the needed items for parts of the diet change readily at Whole Foods or New Seasons.  He has lost 25 pounds and his doctor has found a star patient.  However, the man is now actively researching the health benefits of different cuisines.  He read about the significant health benefits of Natto (Japanese fermented soy beans).  Whole Foods on their website indicated they carried Natto, but when we arrived there, the store manager had never heard of such an item.  I whipped onto my Yelp app and asked my local Yelpers on Yelp Talk if they knew of where locally we could find this product.  And, of course, the minute I hit the send button, the light bulbs went off over our heads and we both almost shouted \\"UWAJIMAYA!!\\"  And before you know it, we flew out on our magic carpet (does an electrical vehicle count???) out to Uwajamiya.\\n\\nWhat fun!!!  We had to move things along a bit as it was 9:30 p.m., but we ran into one of the best store employees ever.  He even eats Natto frequently and helped us find the right Natto product for the man's needs and how to prepared it to perhaps avoid the used sweat sock smell (this is why I'm waiting for him to figure out how to do this because evidently I'm a coward).  Since it was closing time, we did have to go, but we do want to come back and explore.  The items are a bit out of our ken, but how can one not want to come back and explore such items as frozen octopus tentacles.  \\n\\nWhen I went back and checked on the Yelp Talk replies, Uwajimaya was frequently recommended, and we are just about to get a new HMart outlet on the SE side here in Portland.  Still and all, it was worth going over just for the $2.39 package of Natto for the adventure and fun and discovery.  Who said you can't teach old dogs new tricks?

I was having a hard time finding seaweed which did not come from China so Uwajimaya was my last stop on my search. I do use some food products from China but seaweed can contain unhealthy amounts of heavy metals and the waters along the coast of China are often polluted. Anyway, I found both kombu and wakame seaweed from Japan and was quite happy. It costs 3X as much as Chinese seaweed which is also sold there but worth it if you are going to eat it regularly.

It was a Tuesday, so I expected that people from the surrounding businesses would be having lunch there.  However, there were only a  couple of other people.  I wondered if this was a sign that the food was not good or if people simply don't know about it yet.  My companion ordered three tacos, and I had a burrito.  The food came out quickly and was piping hot.  Not only was it hot, but it was also quite good and very filling.  For the price, the quantity and quality were superb.\\n\\nThe decor is rather simplistic, as if it were a work in progress.  It is located in a former Chipotle, so the new owners have kept the walk-up format of ordering at the bar and moving down toward condiments, napkins, etc.  Obviously, all indications that it used to be a Chipotle have been removed -- including padding from the seats and booths, which have plain plywood backing now.  Hopefully the owners will make it a little more visually inviting soon.  The two large televisions provided soccer entertainment.\\n\\nWill I go back?  Yeah.

It actually has tents, a hot tub, a children's pool area and a small bar area for drinks and snacks. Making our way to the room, we were very pleased to have an elevator to our second room. The room was a spacious 2 bedroom with Tuscan style tile, pictures and styling. It had a kitchen with an eating counter with it's own chairs, separate from the dining room table. The master bedroom bathroom was big, with a counter top that could fit enough for an entire family. Now I must get to my favorite part. The living room has sliding glass doors to a screened in patio. The patio has a table where you can dine or just sit and relax free of bugs. The view from the second floor screened patio is magnificent. It literally overlooks a world class golf course. Also, we would walk every day up to one of the many restaurants that are a stones throw away. We had a very filling lunch at Millers for 5.99 each. The main street of Championsgate is clean and beautifully designed and appears to be safe for walking.

We heard nothing but classic 90's hiphop during our visit.  \\n\\nThe menu changes each time you visit based on the dishes they are working on this week.  The menu had a variety of appetizers, salads, and then separated into types of dishes.  There was a section for Meats, Seafood, and Vegetarian options.

We had dishes like Carnitas puffy tacos, Korean BBQ flank steak, Niman Ranch pork cheeks, Seared Sea Scallops to name a few.\\n\\nThe service is top of the line.

It is very well cooked, seasoned, high quality prepared food.  This is one of the places that tries to make art with your dish.  My complaint there was maybe just only one dish that made me say wow on flavor.  I think something can be high ingredients and cooked well yet still have be lackluster flavor Party of 6 with a few drinks, several dishes and 1 dessert & 18% gratuity added was $270 tab.  Divide it by 6 to get your answer per person. \\n\\nSwifts Attic is a well run, fancy downtown establishment for high end food, dessert and variety of drinks.

Coming from a James beard award winning chef, the food was nowhere near innovative or creative. It felt like an average healthier Southern meal with green chili hush puppies, baby back ribs, a lobster roll, a really poorly done salty halibut, collard greens and a pecan pie.

I wasn't a fan of the mushroom spread but the olive spread and salmon spread were good. \\n\\nThe wines were really dull, didn't pair well, and hard to drink. When they asked how the meal was going, I was honest and said the fish was really salty. Right away they did say they'd take that off the bill. It was a nice gesture and I appreciate that. I was just super underwhelmed by the food and the wine. I was only in Portland for 24 hours and talking to other Portlanders the day after, and they weren't really sure why Beast was so popular either since the food wasn't good.

It is one of my favorite brunch spots in the area (if not THE fave). My last time there was this past Sunday. It is a really popular spot, so I always plan to line up early before they even open at 11. This time, I was running behind and didn't get there until 10:47 (gasp!). There were only a few people waiting outside, so I was relieved. Despite the small line, I dropped my boyfriend off to wait while I went to look for parking. Good thing I did! By the time I parked and walked back, the line was 5x as long! Basically, you either have to get there before they open for brunch or wait until the crowd dies down. I would hate to get there right at 11 and be a part of the 2nd wave as that means you have to wait for at least 45 mins.\\n\\nAnyway - we got right in. They are always good about opening their doors right at 11. No dilly dallying. They are also efficient with seating folks. Just make sure your whole party is there as you may lose your place in line.\\n\\nThey have wonderful brunch dishes and drinks as well. My favorite entree is the Dirty Bird which is fried chicken, egg, bacon and sausage gravy on a biscuit. I'm not really a gravy fan, nor was I a fan of runny egg, but this dish changed my mind. When I get it - I let them make it as-is because it's perfect! Maybe a perfect heart attack waiting to happen, but perfect nonetheless. This time around, my boyfriend (who used to think brunch was dumb - guess whose idea it was to come to Highland Kitchen this weekend.... mmmhm!) got the Dirty Bird and I went with the pancakes. Oooo, they are so good! A little crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside and covered with a bit of powdered sugar, berries and bourbon maple syrup (the good stuff). We basically shared both dishes and I was in sweet and savory heaven. I wouldn't change a thing (well, I DID ask for more syrup).\\n\\nI was going to go with the Biggie mimosa for my drink, but my boyfriend wanted to order for me. He got me the Cereal Killer, which was a good call. I can get a mimosa anywhere. The Cereal Killer is basically a white russian made with cereal milk and it even had some cinnamon toast crunch on the top. It was boozy and delicious. The bf got the bloody and was happy with it. I'm not a bloody fan at all, but it is the 2nd best one I've tasted (after Ruby Slipper in New Orleans).\\n\\nEven though the wait staff is slammed, 95% of the time, they are super helpful, present and polite.

Our first attempt to dine here over the summer was aborted by the long line out the door. That and the 'atmosphere' was a little too much for my casual Mr. K. That day we ended up at a waffle cart, because that is what you do in Portland, and all was good.\\n\\nMonths pass and the rave reviews keep building. Then they are chosen as Restaurant of the Year by Willamette Week. I NEED to eat here. So I cash in my chips and choose Tasty n Sons for my birthday breakfast. How can Mr. K refuse? I also might have said, \\"Suck it up!\\"\\n\\nThis time we arrive before they open at 9:00a and are the first in the door. We sat at the kitchen counter, since that is almost always my preference, and overall it was a great experience. We ordered five dishes: two were excellent, one very good and two just fair.\\n\\nThe items that left the best impression were Erin's Sweet Biscuits with blueberry compote and the Polenta & Sausage Ragu with mozzarella & fried egg. One savory, one sweet and both delicious. \\n\\nTo start our meal, we chose the Chocolate Potato Doughnut with cr√®me anglaise. It is a doughnut hole, so a small serving but very tasty. At $1.50 a pop, it was a novelty that I don't feel the need to order again. The Fried Egg & Cheddar Biscuit with fried chicken was good, but I've enjoyed this particular dish elsewhere. Biscuit was flaky, chicken was tender, but it just doesn't seem unique to this place so next time I'll pass.\\n\\nWe should have stopped there, but after so many rave reviews we also ordered the Glazed Yams with cumin-maple. And it was my least favorite part of the meal. I am a bit of a yam addict and cook with it all the time, so perhaps that is why it didn't appeal to me as much as other diners. \\n\\nIn all Tasty n Sons was well worth the visit. No matter how lovely a place, I just can't tolerate long lines, so I'll keep my visits to the early morning hours and continue to try new items on their menu. I can understand its detractors since this place is not the best choice for every circumstance. \\n\\nIt feels like an a la carte buffet and it is probably best enjoyed when you can go with friends and order a number of dishes to share.

The lamb was a huge piece; it was pretty good with the fat and bone meat. There were plenty of rice to mellow out the lamb's flavor. The hummus and salad helped as well.\\n\\nThe mouslia kubba was interesting and different. It's a big circular kebba borghal that was stuffed with minced meat. It was sort of like a dry, stuffed pancake with a hard crust and dry ish meat inside. The hubs seemed to like it, but it was too dry for my palate. It's def something different from the typical wraps and platters.\\n\\nOverall the food here wasn't bad.

We had a server with a dermal near her eye and she was great- she checked in just enough and never left us hanging for refills.\\n\\nWhat we got:\\nIced coffee (black)- smooth and very good\\n\\nBeignets (6 for $2.49)- How can you go wrong with fried dough covered in butter, powdered sugar, and cinnamon? Delicious.\\n\\nBreakfast Sandwich ($3.99)- He got the bacon, egg, and cheese on a plain bagel. He said it was very good with just enough bacon and cheese.\\n\\nTwo Eggs ($4.79 with no meat)- I got my eggs scrambled with home fries and cinnamon raisin toast. The potatoes were great (crispy and not those nasty, square ones from the freezer section) and the toast was HUGE. I got two slices of giant cinnamon raisin bread which was really the equivalent of three slices. They were at least six inches long each.\\n\\nTotal bill: under $20 and we left stuffed.

I first learned about Naomi Pomeroy when she competed on Top Chef Masters. I really didn't know what to think, but when I saw her recently on The Taste, I found my woman crush. When we were planning our weekend in Portland, the memory of her restaurant being there popped into my brain and we looked it up. When first reading about it, we were a little hesitant but we kept reading and fell deeper into a trance. And then I read the sample menu. \\n\\nDat menu doh.\\n\\nWe booked our reservation and waited on pins & needles for the week's menu to be posted. From first glance our mouths started to water. It was going to be a long four days to wait until Saturday night. The evening finally arrived and we attempted to make our way (more about that later) to an unassuming dining spot in the arts district and the show was ready to begin.\\n\\nDinner was a show & the staff - small but superb - was the orchestra. This was an orchestrated affair like very few I have attended. When you first walk in, you feel like you're being invited into Naomi's personal dining room. I've seen many an open kitchen, but none like this one. We were seated promptly and awaited our first wine. To paraphrase Lumiere, \\"Course by course, one by one, (I never shouted) enough I'm done\\". It's hard to pick a favorite course, it's even difficult to name a least favorite course. The dinner was so well put together and progressed at just the right speed to really enjoy yourself. I could wax poetic about each course from the first to the sixth and even the extras like the palate cleanser and the fruit jelly; but since the menu is different every single week, I will try my best to give you the highest of the highlights. Ms. Pomeroy has made me a believer in all the loveliness that is foie gras. Her bon bon was like something I've never had and I would easily take a box of those on Valentine's Day. The short rib bourguignon was melt in your mouth fabulous. I even enjoyed a bite of oyster mushroom; and for this fungi tolerator (barely) that's a big deal. And skipping straight to dessert for this sugar addict, it was like they called up my husband and asked what his favorite flavors were. Don't get me wrong, I hesitated about licking the rosemary caramel off the plate. \\n\\nSince I read several reviews mentioning the uncomfortable chairs, I'm here to say they're not that bad. I've sat in worse. Yes, it's a long dinner and a cushion might be nice; but I found the chairs to be quite supportive. Another plus for the service, they arranged our car home; and after our arrival debacle, it was much needed. \\n\\nA note to future diners: if you are traveling to Beast from anywhere in the Arts District quadrant, do yourself a favor and call a cab. It won't cost you much. If you live in the area, you might be used to the walk. However, to this visitor, we got caught off guard with a public transit snafu and walked 30+ blocks at cheetah pace to make our reservation. Was dinner worth the calorie deficit?

From there, you choose what protein you want. Let me tell you, their grilling technique and lemongrass marinade is LEGIT, ON POINT, ON FLEEK, ON...what else do kids say these days? Sexy grill marks on my food PLUS fragrant seasonings with each bite? Mmmhmm, yezzir.

If I'm in a rush, I get their salad rolls, and the meatball salad roll (haha that sounds funny) is probably my favorite (dip that in the peanut sauce and say hello to a happy food-induced hyperventilation). With salad rolls, you get a choice of three sauces (fish sauce, peanut sauce and hoisin tamarind sauce). I love sauce so I usually request all three (no extra charge, which is nice). \\n\\nHi vegetarians. Ya'll are probably cray cray for tofu right? Their tofu salad rolls here are wholesome and will make you feel full (I tried one). You can also opt for the rice/vermicelli combo and get grilled tofu instead.

For Columbus Day, there was a comfortable group of people inside (around 4 tables or so, 2 to 3 people each) tended by 2 servers. One would think that this would make the service a little more \\"personal\\", but half of the time our servers were nowhere to be seen. The only only people in sight were one of the sushi chefs standing at the far end of the room and the owner who was busy talking to one of the other tables.\\n\\nWhen we did receive the food (we ordered a Sushi Party \\"A\\" Set), the quality of the food left something to be desired for the price we were paying. The fish had the \\"fishy\\" after-taste that indicated un-fresh fish, while the rice was stale, stiff, hard, and went down our throats roughly. Almost painfully. The mochi ice cream was to die for though. We tried one of each and the Green Tea and Red Bean still came out on top.\\n\\nOur bill took a really long time to arrive, and at that point in time one server was counting cash on the outside table, the owner and a sushi chef were talking to each other, and whenever each looked in our direction they seemed to miss our waving hands signalling for the bill.\\n\\nWhen the bill did arrive, I was surprised to find an 18% gratuity tacked on to our bill without any explanation. Now, in my experience, this 18% gratuity is only charged for large parties in most other restaurants, typically 6+, and in normal circumstances we are left to determine the tip on our own. When we called the server over to ask for an explanation, we were simply told over and over that the 18% gratuity was charged by default. At this point in time, the owner was nowhere to be found and I had run out of both time and patience to deal with the matter.\\n\\nFor the price we paid, I'd rather have gone to Yama's in Wellesley Hills where, for the same price, we'd also have got a salad and miso soup in addition to fresher fish and rice. Otherwise, if I were willing to pay slightly more and travel further, I'd have gone to Oga's down by Route 9.\\n\\nI wish I had the same kind of experience as everyone seems to be raving about, but until the quality of the food and service improves, I will never be coming back here again.

In fact the man at the next table commented that \\"the bacon doesn't match the pancakes and they should give you at least 2 strips of bacon for each pancake if it's gonna be that little and thin.\\" I said that I agreed!\\nThe staff was friendly but not especially attentive. We had to flag several other servers down bc they were always looking down. The clientele was mostly over 65 with a few families of 3 sprinkled in. \\nEverything was fine here but nothing was great.

I placed an order for Ten Mighty Wings, Fries, Drink AND the Quarter Pounder Deluxe. The total came to ~$20 before the coupon. I drove around to the window and handed the coupon & my credit card to the clerk.

After much discussion he finally returned my credit card with a REFUND receipt, but he did not sign or complete the form, as is required to do so. When I asked him to do so, he refused telling me it was not necessary. I politely asked him his name and he refused to give it to me telling me it was none of my business. Thus he became known only as the man with the long ponytail. I left, still wondering what the Mighty Wings tasted like, but at least I know how much they cost. \\n\\nIn all, the McDonald's franchisee waste about 30 minutes of my time, that could have been avoided by simply telling me up front they would not take the coupon, and then by not harassing me during the rest of the process. I still have to check my credit card statement to verify that I was charged the same amount as I was refunded, that the credit was actually made to my card and not reversed, etc. The way this man acted does not make me think I can trust him to have done the right thing at all. I would say that this incident has wasted about an hour of my time.\\n\\nDid I mention that since I insisted they finally returned the coupon and that Wendy's, Burger King, etc are all willing to redeem the coupon.

That and it's currently January, our trip was in August and he's still talking about it, or how he can't wait for the next trip to eat there again *insert heavy eye roll*. I was surprised that i ended up liking it as well considering IIIIIII am not a healthy eater by any means haha. Once you go inside there are two lines, one for app orders (via the WDW app) and one for window orders. A cashier takes your orders, scans the magic band, hands you your receipt and you take that to the back window and hand it off to the CM who preps your orders. Grab your noms and head to the \\"Commissary\\", the seating areas. Along the back wall are the soda machines, paper straws[side note: we'll talk about this in my Animal Kingdom Park review] and utensils. There is a ton of seating inside and plenty outside as well (^_^)\\n\\nThe first day I didn't grab anything from here because I was busy snacking away at other munchies and my Night Blossom drink. Boyfriend ordered the Satu'li bowl($12.99) with sliced beef, rice & grain mix, veggie slaw, the charred onion chimichurri dressing and yogurt balls. The beef was super tasty, not overly cooked or seasoned, the rice was a touch salty but once mixed in with the herb dressing it balanced out a bit. The yogurt balls are similar to the popping boba pearls but filled with a creamy yogurt sauce not like actual yogurt haha. The second time I decided on the beef bowl with sweet and red potato hash and no sauce. I really liked this, considering I thoroughly hate sweet potatoes. The grilled beef is cooked to about medium rare, and it mixes really well with the hash and yogurt balls. I ended up not being too fond of the veggie slaw so it was picked off because sometimes I'm 5 and hate vegetables, mkay? The dish itself does work well without sauce, happy about that, but I'm sure i'd have enjoyed the rice option as well. He got the same as I did but with the black bean vinaigrette sauce. Considering he inhaled it in about 10 minutes..kinda think he liked it(^_^) They do have a tofu, sustainable fish fillet and chicken option for your protein, in case you're not particularly fond of red meat. Satu'li does have a specialty drink that I forgot to try called the Pandoran Sunrise($4.49) which was an interesting mix of tropical juices mixed with Powerade Melon. You can see why i forgot to try it haha. It's also available in a souvenir Na'vi flute cup for an extra $9 too($13.49). They've also got some dessert options if you've got room at the end! If the protein bowls don't interest you, they've got Steam Pods which are bao buns that come stuffed with a vegetable-curry or cheeseburger fillings. Served with root vegetable chips and the crunchy veggie slaw. Like I said, a pretty healthy place overall. \\n\\nI honestly can't wait to eat here again. The bowls were filling, tasty and didn't put me in a food coma on a hot day. Next time I'll try the dessert options and maybe just the bao buns since I really didn't enjoy the slaw on my Satu'li bowl. I gave it 5 stars because the concept was really cool and on par with what you'd expect to find in a cafeteria of a scientific research center on an alien planet. The decor was fun to look at and it was plenty to keep you busy while you chow down. I like that the food only took a matter of minutes to get after you order and that the seating was plentiful indoors since humidity really isn't anyone's friend, ever. If you like healthy foods or need vegan/gluten-free options, you will find it here. See ya next time Satu'li!

I really have no words to describe how delicious and awesome the food is here. I've ordered Pikliz as well as gone to the restaurant to order some take out. The place is rather small and they have some high top bar like seating where you can definitely eat. Seems like not many people stay to eat but rather take out or order for delivery. \\n\\nWhether ordering for delivery or ordering at the restaurant to go, the food is always on point. You pretty much have an option from different meats and different sides. They also have Jamaican patties which are really tasty and I sometimes get. Everyone is kind and was pretty helpful in walking us through what they offer.\\n\\nMy go to is the jerk chicken with the black rice and the okra. The jerk chicken is pretty spicy but really delicious - it is both tasty and spicy. The black rice comes with some beans and can at times be a bit spicy but for the most part it is just very good and really amazingly seasoned. The okra is cooked in a way that it's very tasty but the okra character is there and I wouldn't recommend it to those who don't like okra or it's slimy like texture. The cabbage and carrot cooked vegetables is also another great side order to have - it's nice and salty and almost tastes like it has some soy sauce. The fried plantains are an additional awesome side to have and are fried well, not greasy or oily at all and just the way tostones / fried plantains should be. I definitely would recommend getting the black rice and whatever meat. Another incredible meat option is the fried pork. It is so juicy, tasty, and tender. I have high standards for pork dishes having grown up in Miami and around a lot of awesome Cuban food and this definitely lives up and even surpassed those standards. So yum!!! I have also always wanted to try the oxtail stew dish but whenever I try to order it they are sold out. \\n\\nOverall, this is such an amazing place I wish I could eat here all the time!

At one point we asked for more salsa, the guy brought it and it didn't look right. When our waiter came by we told him, he looked at it and thought it was chipotle-lime sauce but he said he would bring us some salsa. We never got it or the second basket of chips to go with it. As he was cleaning the table and struggling to stack dishes he dropped the sauce. It went all over me, my pants, and a sweatshirt that was extremely special to me. It is a Fallen firefighter sweatshirt bought at the national memorial in remembrance of a fallen comrade. He was apologetic, and said he would get the manager and some club soda. He brought me a napkin with club soda on it? Really? I'd have to bathe in it to do any good. Manager came, she was apologetic and offered me her boss's business card or to take something off the bill. The jeans were older, but the sweatshirt was probably 50 bucks, and it's not the point. If the guy wasn't trying to carry so much it wouldn't have happened. They also dropped plate 3-4 times while we were there, i think there was definitely something going on with the staff tonight.

How do we order? She walks to the bar. They tell her her waitress will take our order. Meanwhile I, 29 years old, try to figure out the computer system from a keyboard and monitor 15 feet away figuring out why there seemed to be a big blue error message on the screen. Realized its a warning about no rough housing and squinted to see if I triggered bumpers or not. When I had set up our names and bumpers (dont judge us :P) the computer had a turtle saying it took me 10 min to start. The waitress comes over around then and I point her to my mom. She orders and returns with a cosmo not long after. Our bowling balls had gotten stuck before we even begun (noticd after first round and the balls werent coming back), so my mom asked for assistance and maintenance came promptly and fixed the issue.\\n\\nDuring the 2nd game, I decided to order a drink. I waited for a waitress as I hadnt seen ours since she dropped off the cosmo during the 1st game. I wished there was a light or something you could turn on to let staff know you'd like to order something instead of hoping someone would return. Saw someone who looked like a waitress bussing a table. \\"Hi, can I order a nuttella milkshake? How is it?\\" She mumbled, \\"Uh...I'll be back.\\" Next time I saw her, she avoided eye contact and disappeared. 20 minutes later, I see a waitress walk over to the front counter. \\"Excuse me, how do I let my waitress know I'd like to order something?\\" \\"I'm your waitress!\\" \\"Oh!\\" We have a nice chat about her recommendations, going with hers I got the strawberry cheesecaske milkshake because it comes with a mini cheesecake on the glass. Arrives in a mason jar with whipped cream and a straw. It was good. Not all that exciting though. \\n\\nAt some point my mom ordered wine after her small cosmo. After waiting around for 20 min, she went to the bar to complain she still hadnt gotten her drink.

As I walk over, I try to make eye contact asking thumbs down. She doesnt. \\"Ready?\\" \\"No... 2 minutes.\\" \\"Uh ok, wave me over when it is.\\"\\n\\nIts at this time when the manager comes over to me with the waitress to inform me they feel uncomfortable serving my mom anymore alcohol and they think she's intoxicated. \\"What?\\" I was so confused. I've seen my mom drunk, even annoyingly typsy, but this was not it, \\"She's fine! She's not drunk...This just sucks, cuz I wanted to take her out for her birthday and youre cutting her off after 1 drink saying shes too drunk when shes not.\\" \\"Just now, she was faling off the bench.\\" \\"When...? Like when I was sitting next to her?\\" \\"No, you were over there.\\" \\"...You advertise yourself as a bar and bowling alley. Isnt that your thing? You've seen drunk people before.\\" \\"I understand ma'am, but I just dont feel comfortable giving her anymore alcohol. It's a liability.\\" Mom is pissed and insulted. Waitress takes responsibility. I ask them, \\"Is it because youre extra precautious, because of the bowling balls...\\" \\"No, she's intoxicated.\\" (Look man, I gave you a way to be tactful.) When he brings up her falling, she explains she slipped on the lane because of the wax. He says no, on the bench, she looks at him like what are you talking about? We can only guess its when I was being a goof and she laughed so hard she was falling off the bench. (But she can also be a little clumsy.) When they walk aw ay I ask mom if she wants to still stay. She says yeahhh, she really wants to bowl more games, but she'll just order water. I ask for water, \\"Yes! We'd be happy to get her water.\\" Whatever. I go to hostess, \\"Ok 2 for unlimited!\\" \\"Uh... hold on.\\"  Manager comes back. \\"I dont feel comfortable having her stay and play more games.\\"\\n\\nAlso gave suggestions, but manager said having someone greet and show their \\"enter bowler and bumper\\" setup is a liability and that the waitstaff cant keep track of all their customers.

Cheap Chinese restaurant open 24 hours?  It was a dream to me.  One of my picky friends thought he had the best breakfasts he's ever had here.\\n\\nHowever, after a few bad experiences, this is a restaurant I have boycotted.  While it was usually all well and good - being open 24 hours meant high variance in quality with the staff/cook shifts.  Here are a couple of lowlights from my patronage over the years:\\n\\n - For reasons beyond me, being glared at by the 'manager' after settling the bill and while finishing my cup of tea.  She exclaimated her point (whatever that was) by clearing the table while glaring at us and even removing the seasoning tray... what?  Okay, maybe just one bad server but then...\\n - They made me wait 40 minutes for a clubhouse sandwich that never came.  After they repeatedly assuring me and apologizing for the long wait - they realized they couldn't make it.  The only 'compensation' offered was that manager (another one) asked me if I would like to *order* something else after the rest of my group was finished eating.  An overly generous $0.05 tip was given.\\n - A friend ordered curry beef brisket on rice - a dish almost impossible to screw up.  After a long wait, they gave him beef stir-fried in ginger over rice (looks like the chef was trying to improvise for the lack of curry).  My friend proclaimed as the worst thing he's ever eaten (he refused to send it back as he was hungry and feared reprisal).  Another $0.05 tip was given.\\n\\nHaving eaten at Chinese restaurants all my life - I know what to expect, but this was inexcusable.\\n\\nKnowing more late-night places in Richmond, I have managed to avoid this place.  However, I have come here on a few occasions when starved in Richmond at 4AM (after *all* other places have closed and drive-thru fast food is serving breakfast).

I was very disappointed but with a seat overlooking the pastry area and able to see what they were making, I quickly got over missing out on them...\\n\\nI have to say that from the moment we walked in the door to the time we left, the staff went out of their way to cater to us. They TRULY understand the concept of customer service and I have to give praise to the entire staff because they all work together to make the dining experience memorable. \\n\\nMy wife started off with a glass of Cabernet Sauvignon as usual it was iced tea with lime for me. Trust me, tonight was a night I really wish I was not allergic to alcohol because of what I chose but we'll get to that. I did however get to sniff the bouquet of her wine and I was jealous. \\n\\nMy wife started with the Kale Salad and followed up with the Hanger Steak. I chose to start off with the Venison Tartare and follow up with the Braised Rabbit. I ordered the Cask Mac n Cheese for us to share and we saved room to share the Chocolate Chess Pie.\\n\\nThe Kale Salad was wonderful and I am not even a fan of raw Kale because of the texture BUT the flavors used in that salad just sang in harmony...  WELL DONE!\\n\\nThe Venison Tartare was definitely the best I have ever had. The texture was wonderful and the flavor just stole the show. Just a light gaminess but the meat was so tender it just melted like butter in your mouth. That Lardo toast was a perfect match but the portion of tartare made quick work of the three pieces of toast. The gentleman that made it for me overheard me comment to my wife that I could have used a fourth piece and took care of it. I did not think I said it loud enough for anybody to hear me but that goes to show that he was keeping an eye on our needs. A special thanks to him for going the extra mile tonight.\\n\\nThat Cask Mac n Cheese was also a show stopper...  The combination of cheese, cauliflower and tasso ham was amazing. I honestly had to force myself to stop eating it so I had room for dessert.\\n\\nThe Braised Rabbit was another dish that just took my breath away. No gaminess at all and the choice of vegetables was perfect. The maitake mushrooms complimented the taste of the rabbit meat perfectly and the sweetness of the sweet potato was just enough to bring it all together. I could not believe my wife said it tasted like chicken because chicken NEVER tasted that good. SIGH\\n\\nThe Hanger Steak was well executed. The brown butter sauce and Horseradish were a perfect compliment to the meat. I did not sample the broccoli rabe or the potatoes but odds are I will be ordering it the next time I drop by...  Well unless the Butcher Chops are on the menu...  WINK\\n\\nThe Chocolate Chess Pie was recommended by the gal making the pastries and THANK YOU for recommending it...  The pie itself was amazing but that chai chantilly just took it to the next level. Add to that the amazing ginger biscotti and the coffee cream and all I can say is...  WOW! I am so glad I saved room for dessert tonight.\\n\\nI would have normally made reservations BUT Rhys Gawlak is a member of a foodie group I help to manage on Facebook and I wanted to slip in undetected to get the TRUE customer experience. Well I am pleased to say that this was one of the best dining experiences I have had without making a reservation. Give your staff a pat on the back for their excellence in execution.

We frequent this restaurant at least 1-2 times a month. With that being said.. it's been slowly going down-hill over the past few visits.\\nFor example. I visited on 2/28 with a few of my friends.. We arrived around 4:30.. plenty of tables available. Yet had to wait 10 mins to sit. While waiting I went to the restroom.. It was a disaster.. Every time I visit this establish the restroom is in shambles. And that's apparently OK because this past time an employee was walking out as I entered.. She didn't bother to take note and clean it up. Toilet paper was all over the floor.. all of the toilets were clogged and un-flushed.. puddles of water around the sinks.. one stall even had a entire dispenser for the toilet paper laying on the ground.  \\nAside from dirty restrooms.. the floor of the restaurant is dangerously slippery. You have to take caution with each step so as not to slip and fall. On one visit I watched as a waiter did slip and fall while carrying multiple dinners.\\nFinally when we were seated.. we had to wait before we could actually sit because the table was not properly whipped clean. Food was still on the table.. and what was 'cleaned' was not collected on the seats. \\nWrapping this up. The service has gone down hill. After sitting it's a chore just to get your servers attention.. let alone any server. It was mid way into our appetizer before our server checked on us and we were able to ask for plats AND utensils.  (two visits I have had to ask to receive utensils) When we finally received our meal we were missing sauce... I looked around for probably a good 10 mins before I was able to get someone's attention to get it. Then that took another 5 mins to receive. Paying and leaving is just as hard.. We waited and waited and waited after finishing our meal before she finally came over to us to take note we wanted to leave. Then getting the check..more intense prolonged waiting.. paying and getting receipts.. that actually took so long another server brought the receipts back. \\nGet it together Chevys!

We ordered a Cabernet that was fruity and light and not too sweet for $16. That was really good. The appetizers were good but simple and nothing exciting. They were just okay. I did really like one of the house-made salamis though. For the entrees the sausage plate was good and interesting but got kind of boring after eating it for a while. The steak dish had a little more variety. The steak was cooked amazingly, nice and crispy on the outside, but not charred and seasoned beautifully. The potatoes were SO good.

I'd return for those nachos alone. My margarita was underwhelming - not strong at all and just generally lacked in flavor. The guacamole was the same way. It came with nacho strips which were a great idea for dipping, but the batches were hit or miss. Some were hot and crunchy, some were colder and oily. The prices are also a little steep for the area, so that's not encouraging me to run back any time soon.\\n\\nOverall, the vibe is fun and the nachos are as good as everyone says - I got a few great pictures inside, but I think I'll be returning to some other restaurants when I need a Tex-Mex fix."},{"name":"Pig Floyd's Urban Barbakoa","address":"1326 N Mills Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"This place is always the best.

The Mongolian Beef was good but could have gone a bit heavier on the mushrooms (again, just a personal preference).  The beef was well-flavored but one bite consisted of pure fat - never appealing.

I thought 18 reviews (not including the ones Yelp shows as not recommended) being 5 stars were all incredibly unlikely to be wrong.\\n\\nUnfortunately, rather than having this become one of my favorite Mediterranean places on the North Shore, it fell a little flat... and while I might return to try the salad, I do not feel a longing to come back here and bring all my friends here to try it. \\n\\nBefore I get into the food, I would like to say that service at this location is terrific. \\n\\nI was able to try both everything on the Hummus Platter w/ Falafel, and from the Adea's sampler.\\n\\nOne of the things I was most looking forward to trying was the grape leaves. This is because they are one of the more unusual items, and that other Yelpers said good things. Unfortunately, for me personally, they left a bad taste in the mouth, literally. \\n\\nAs I understand it, they are filled with rice and possibly some other stuff (like lentils) with lemon juice to bring it all together. However, the filling was rather mushy, as for the lemon... there was way too much of it. The lemon (or another sour, acidic something) completely overwhelmed the flavor... with the sourness lingering even after I had left the restaurant. \\n\\nThe Pita bread was fantastic. It was delightfully warmed, flavorful, sturdy, and overall awesome. Great for stuffing it with hummus and falafel.\\n\\nSpeaking of falafel... I had no issues with the flavor of the falafel, as the flavors were all there. However, when it comes to falafel, texture is important too. These falafels were tiny! I mean they were the size tater tots. The issue is that, as I understand it, falafel is supposed to have a little more crisp on the outside, with a very warm, soft, awesome inside. While the outside was inward and soft, and the outside was crisp, the size disrupted that wonderful feeling of biting through the outer shell into the wonderful inside. \\n\\nHummus and babaganoush were both very good. They both seemed like they were made in house, the spices were all there, and they were an overall delight. However, I will comment the following things I would have liked to see. First, while I understand that these two are somewhat similar, I would have liked to see them differentiated more. To someone who has never had babaganoush before, it seemed like a different variation on hummus. \\n\\nSpeaking of, in the hummus platter, there was quite a bit of it. I do realize it is a HUMMUS platter, but still, I struggled to figure out what to do with all this hummus!\\n\\nHowever, to tie everything together, here are the reasons why I had to deduct two stars.\\n\\nFirst, the grape leaves: unless I completely misunderstood the way this is supposed to be prepared, they were one of the things that took away from the overall experience, and literally left a bad taste in the mouth.\\n\\nSecond, I felt the dishes were rather one-dimensional. There was a warm tomato in the sampler, and there were some wonderful green olives (I mean REALLY good ones) and pickles provided with one of the dishes. However, this was not enough to save the dishes. They were screaming for a fresh component. Something to add a burst of crispness, freshness, and a different flavor than the ones carried by lentils and chickpeas (which comprises a supermajority of the things on the plate). Offering a side salad would make everything so much better.\\n\\nMy final gripe is the prices. Unfortunately, for what I got, I felt the prices were on the high side. You do get a plate of food for around 8 bucks, but I felt for what you get, the prices could be lower."},{"name":"McKay's Breakfast and Lunch","address":"144 Franklin St","city":"Quincy","stars":"4","text":"You have to love it here!!

We went in person to order a simple take-out lunch for 3 (i.e. no substitutes or anything special requested), and we had to repeat our order at least 3 times for her when we initially made the order.  Then she came back TWO more times after while we were waiting to confirm again what it was we ordered.  After we paid, I looked at the receipt, and she put well-done for the burger instead of medium-rare.  I told her right away and she said she'd fix it; yet when we got the order the burger was well-done and the bun was super soggy because they put way too much sauce.  The key lime pie clearly stated on the menu that it came with toasted meringue and candied lime, which it did not at all.  When we questioned them about the missing ingredients of the pie, they said it was a limited time thing(?) and they did not make any effort to offer another solution or apologize.  If they had told me while I was ordering that they were out, I'd understand and not order, but they did not.  I returned the plain pie and had to push for a refund.

I simply was not in the mood to eat at another chain. The items on the menu sounded delicious and were very competitively priced. I was pretty excited to try out the brisket. And while it had a pretty good taste, it disappointed me. The marinade was too strong on some pieces and not strong enough on others. The green beans were categorically unbearable: way too salty and buttery. I will admit the fried yuca was good. For as long as I can remember, the way I've been able to discern if what I ate was of poor quality is how my stomach feels afterward. I typically eat very healthy and my body will reveal to me if I've strayed too far from my normal diet. After this meal at Pig Floyd's, my stomach was groaning and squealing and aching until the morning; do the math. If I do return (long shot) I will probably try something else besides the brisket and icky vegetables.\\n\\nMOOD: 5 stars. I love the mood around Pig Floyd's. It's very eclectic and hipster-ish. The entire Mills 50 district is very trendy and chic, so this restaurant follows suit quite well. The decor is a little rustic, the outdoor seating provides a nice romantic backdrop, and the 2000s pop playlist blaring through the speakers was a welcome addition.\\n\\nSTAFF: 4 stars. The staff seemed pretty nice for the most part. I've been on a no-sugar diet for a few weeks and was searching for a meal at Pig Floyd's without barbecue sauce or sugar. I didn't understand when the cashier told me that all of their meats' dry rub contains sugar, because why would dry rub contain sugar? The cashier was a little stern and impatient at my inability to understand an admittedly seemingly basic concept, but still, I could've done without her mini-attitude. This one blunder aside, the rest of the staff was top-shelf, with several other waiters and the manager asking us about our satisfaction level.\\n\\nTL; DR VERDICT: 4 stars. I probably won't be back unless I'm forced to by my party because the food does not appear to be of great quality, but the mood is fantastic and the staff gets the job done so I recommend at least finding out for yourselves if Pig Floyd's is worth it."},{"name":"Clean Juice Winter Park","address":"480 Orlando Ave, Ste C-126","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4","text":"This was my second time trying Clean Juice.

Although it was very empty when we arrived, the service was kind and efficient. We ordered the pad see ew, pad thai and spicy green bean stir fry with chicken. All portions looked a little small upon arrival but they ended up stuffing us absolutely FULL. The pad see ew did not have too much flavour in it other than soy sauce but the noodles were cooked perfectly being springy and not mushy! They give an ample amount of meat and it is not too oily either. The pad thai I really enjoyed because instead of being too sweet, it had the perfect balance of sweet and sour. It could have benefited from more egg, tofu and chicken but overall, it was great with toothsome noodles and not gloopy at all. Finally, the spicy green beans were a little bit oily but again, lots of chicken to go and very flavourful without being mouth numbingly spicy. \\n\\nI recommend this place for thai food although prices are a little high because of their delicious flavours and overall less oily dishes."},{"name":"Ty Ginger Asian Bistro","address":"5689 Woerner Temple Rd","city":"Dublin","stars":"4","text":"Food was pretty good.

The country music plays very loudly and the place is always packed so there are a lot of voices. Not a bad thing! Just something to keep in mind if you are bringing a first date there or an elderly relative. Sometimes you have to shout to be heard.\\n\\n2. The Border Caf√© parking lot is usually full. If that is the case, rather than waiting for someone to leave, I just park over at Trader Joe's. It is perfectly legal and you will not be towed.\\n\\n3. When you are seated, you will receive unlimited chips and salsa! Woo-Hoo! The chips are made in-house and have always been fresh-out-of-the-oven hot every time we have gone. They are SO GOOD. The salsa is mildly hot, chunky, and a cooler temperature that matches perfectly with the hot chips. You'll see what I mean. \\n\\n4. The prices are dirt cheap! The two of us typically eat for around $20-$25 and we have tons of food to take home. You will leave STUFFED. The French fries are unbelievable- I am not sure if they are fried twice and seasoned? They are ridiculously delicious and you have to try them. BEST shoe string fries I have ever had. The drink size is also HUGE.\\n\\n5. The kid's menu is VERY cheap- I don't remember the exact price but it is around $3 for a kid's meal and, again, the portions are huge. You could probably feed your child twice. Also, they get to choose from a bag of M&M's or Starburst at the end of the meal so there is their incentive to behave and eat their food.\\n\\nOverall, you can't go wrong!

His balls can wait.'\\n\\nI thought he was going to pop out of bed and start singing, \\"I wanna be like youuuuu!  Now gimme the secret, man cub!\\"\\n\\nHe did all the cooking too.  If I was Ruth, I would have made Marty wear a hazmat suit while he made marinara.  I hear he was known in tax circles as Ol' Pubic Wrist.\\n\\nI get distracted very easily.  Luckily, the movie resumed its focus on that incredible English muffin Felicity Jones with her chestnut hair and tasteful overbite.  I find a bit of an oral bulge sexy.  Somewhere in between Welven da Great and I can't find my dentures.  RBG is one of my heroes and 'Basis of Sex' ended up being one of the best movies I have ever watched.\\n\\nI had exactly the same experience at Highland Kitchen.\\n\\nIt looks like a place I would visit to remove my head and replace it with an inverted bottle of rum, like a water cooler jug.  I was dreaming about what a convenient joint it is to get shitfaced in.  Then I tasted their special for the night, the jerk chicken wings.  This is not on their regular menu and appeared on a separate menu, printed on a blue sheet of A4 paper.  Don't ignore this menu if you go there, regardless of what you've heard about the regular dishes.\\n\\nI don't know if they have circulating specials or if they were trying out new recipes but it doesn't matter.  Put those wings on the regular menu, PLEASE.  I implore you, against the advice of the prickly heat in my crack.  Yeah, they are spicy, as jerk should be, thank Christ.  The way the bar looked made me think they were going to be bland, like any other pub.\\n\\nSo I asked the waitress if she could get them to make it more spicy.  She could and they did.  I polished off six and ordered another plate.  She asked me whether the spice level was okay and looked happy when I grinned through a trickle of snot and chicken grease.\\n\\nShe looked like she was about 5'11\\", lean, and model-like with dark hair.  She was efficient and professional and if you're lucky enough to get her as a server, she'll help you out if your request is reasonable.\\n\\nJerk chicken is best made over a fire or, better yet, hot coals so that a nice char develops.  Allspice and thyme, two key ingredients, transform really well into an addictive bark on the surface of the wing.  I make a jerk marinade that I could sell but my chicken leg quarters will never be as good out of the oven as they would be over a wood fire.\\n\\nHighland Kitchen's wings were juicy and had a crisp bark on the outside.  They were perfect flavor-wise and texture-wise.  I got a chance to taste the gumbo as well and it was also hot, like a gumbo should be.  Normally, I don't want gumbo unless it's prepared by a woman named Claudette who looks like Mammy from Tom & Jerry.  She should be wearing an apron and a polka-dot du-rag and stirring a cauldron of gumbo with an oar.\\n\\nOtherwise, GTFO as the kids say.\\n\\nBut, somehow, the geniuses in the kitchen loaded it with meat, flavor, and just the right amount of heat.  It looked sexy too.  I don't have a photo but order it and see it live.\\n\\nAfter the meal, I realized that the name of the place announces everything you need to know about it in a very understated way: It's a kitchen.  First and foremost, it is a place that prides itself on making food you'll like.  Sure, it looks nice and you can spend many hours getting so rat-faced, you'll shit yourself on the bar stool.

Which was so creamy, and really delicious. A surprise for sure. \\n\\n_ Ravioli Di Funghi $17\\nI had a few options in mind, and the waiter steered me in the direction of the funghi ravioli. It was a solid choice. The mushrooms were sauteed beautifully and the ravioli was perfectly cooked. Lots of delicious flavor in one bite, absolutely. The spiralized zucchini was an... interesting addition. I thought it was unnecessary, to be completely honest. I'm not complaining because hey, more vegetables to eat, but it didn't particularly add anything special to the dish. The only real negative to this dish was that it had too much oil. It was pretty greasy.

And she takes her time. I know, I know... it says so on the cover of their menu that \\"good quality takes time\\" but for me it took a little too long, specifically also because the couple that was seated after us was served bread and water before us. I ordered the parpadelle Bologna. The pasta was over cooked and while the bologna sauce was good, it wasn't something outstanding. We also ordered a bottle of wine which was delicious. But overall there are a lot of options in this area for outstanding pasta and service."},{"name":"Southern Kin Cookhouse","address":"500 Assembly Row","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"Like any regional cuisine with a ton of history behind it, Southern cooking is too complex to summarize.\\n\\nIf I were to try to summarize Southern food, it would have to be in a philosophical sense.  Southern food's defining characteristic is all about making the best of what you've got.  States like Alabama were agrarian societies for the longest time so they used everything available.\\n\\nI was reminded of what a great talent this is yesterday when I saw a blind couple feel their way onto the subway.  They found their way to a couple of seats and started talking.  Their conversation was lively and he made her laugh.  I looked around.  Everyone else was on their phones and looking neutral to miserable.\\n\\nI chuckled.  Their sockets were nothing more than long-term parking for their useless eyeballs but they were having a blast anyway.  It took being blind for them not to be on their phones.  The thing is, if we were actually in the South, I doubt that would be true to the same extent.  \\n\\nIt's still 1970 in parts of the South and Midwest and people still talk to strangers like they used to back when portable phones were heavy enough to be used as dumbbells.  That was the hardest habit for me to drop when I moved here from the Midwest.  I went around grinning moronically and saying \\"Hi!\\" to everyone.  People looked at me the way Clarice looked at Hannibal Lecter when he gave her the fava-beans-and-a-nice-Chianti speech.\\n\\nNot anymore.  Now?  I'm one of them.  An asshole.  In Boston, a guy you never met acts the same way towards you as a guy whose mom you killed.\\n\\nToday, when some tourist from Indiana says hi, I think, \\"What the FUCK do you want??\\"\\n\\nThis attitude dissolves when I walk into Southern Kin.  The restaurant embraces the hospitality associated with its cuisine.\\n\\nEvery server was friendly and patient, despite being under a tremendous amount of pressure from the manager patrolling the floor and every seat in the house being taken.  The only gap in the service aspect of our experience was that the food took unusually long to come out, causing Linda, the hungriest in our party, to stare at the kitchen like a husky stares out the mesh door when his owners leave the house.  All she'd had to eat that day was soggy home fries at a conference.\\n\\nI don't expect anything more than an explanation from the staff when this happens, but the manager himself offered us either a free round of drinks or a free round of desserts as compensation for the wait.\\n\\nWe went with the desserts and I loved our selection.  Myself, Miss K, and home-fries-Linda shared a chocolate mud pie and it was decadent.  It came with ice cream and the first thing I noticed about them was how perfectly triangular the slice of pie was and how perfectly spherical the ice cream was.\\n\\nI'm surprised I had room for them because my Frogmore stew was gigantic and phenomenal.\\n\\nFrogmore stew is a South Carolina seafood boil with very permissive methods of preparation.  You can throw in whatever seafood you have and make the broth out of anything you have on hand, mirroring the Southern spirit of adapting to the circumstances.  In fact, if Frogomore stew was in a relationship with its recipe, it'd be an open relationship.\\n\\nThis stew had corn, shrimp, mussels, seared scallops, Andouille sausage, and corn bread in a very light tomato-ish broth that was seasoned perfectly.\\n\\nIt was one of the most delicious stews I've ever had.  Seafood is where the spotlight is supposed to shine but the broth provided the ideal environment for the marine life in the bowl, like a perfectly choreographed row of backup dancers.  I incinerated every last bite, including the corn, and made a mental note in permanent marker to come back and have it again.\\n\\nI ate so quickly that Miss K was still eating when I finished.  She offered me a bite of her Bourbon-brined chicken.\\n\\nSay those three words out loud.  I don't think there are more erotic sounds in the English language.  Each word promises a good time on its own but, put together, they'll make you salivate and pitch a tent at the same time.  The half-chicken was so tender and juicy from the brine, I polished it off as well.\\n\\nI've had the Bayou tacos here once and reviewed them too but Yelp removed that review, probably because they didn't like my rant on fat people and the fact that I praised Phil Robertson's self-reliance.  They missed the point.  I was trying to contrast chubsters with the lean nature of gator tail meat and, like the tacos, Phil's from Louisiana.  I'll condense it this time around: Gator meat is lean but it's tender and really well-seasoned from twelve hours in the smoker.  \\n\\nIf you're just looking for a quick bite with Cajun flavors and a decent amount of heat, the Bayou tacos are very satisfying.  They'll get you to the next meal with no difficulty . . .\\n\\n. . . without turning you into a fatty for whom krill would be a more appropriate meal than gator."},{"name":"Tasty n Sons","address":"3808 N Williams Ave, Ste C, Hub Building","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"In town with some girlfriends for the weekend and a friend recommended this place for brunch.

Overall, I would return to Truluck's if I were celebrating a special occasion (birthday, anniversary) because you get dessert on the house and a little extra decor added to your table. It just feels nice to get a little dressed up and feel fancy sometimes, doesn't it?\\n\\nPositives:\\n-We were greeted warmly and got to our reservation 45 minutes early because we wanted to check out the happy hour only available in the bar. We were able to pick two comfy chairs at the end of the bar right by the hostess stand, order a tuna tartare tower (worth it!) and two yummy cocktails, then head to our reservation once we were ready.\\n-Our server and the manager were both pleasant, as well as the woman who brought out our food. We did notice another server in the area had a much bigger personality than ours, but that didn't bug us. He did read off a bit more specials than she had to the table next to ours after we had already ordered, so that would have been nice to hear.\\n-Our dessert was one of our favorite things! We got a Baked Alaska on the house for my boyfriend's birthday, and it was so yummy and felt special to get an extra treat after spending a bit of money out for a nice meal.\\n\\nNeutrals (pluses and minuses in each category):\\n\\nFood: Overall, positive experience, but it's of course pricey. Some items didn't seem completely worth it based on the taste and preparation. Our favorites were the tuna tartare tower ordered on happy-hour prices at the bar, as well as the ceviche at our dining table (SO much seafood -- what a great deal!), and the umami Brussels sprouts! The bread served at the table before your meal is good, but quite yeasty, so not for everyone likely. My boyfriend had the Oscar Royale as his entree, which was prepared as rare instead of medium rare, but still delicious. My Salmon Bearnaise was flaky and flavorful, but I did not receive crab topping mixed with my shrimp -- only shrimp. We did not bring up either fact with our server because overall, we were pleased. For the entrees, the bang isn't as there for the buck.\\n\\nDrinks: We ordered two cocktails each, and our happy-hour ones were better than our dining ones. Not even price-related, but, the Peachy Keen was quite booze-heavy, and the Aviator was too sweet. The happy-hour cocktails worth your while are the Tiki Margarita and the La Vie en Rose. Both refreshing, great balance and hey -- the prices ($6.50 and $7, respectively) didn't hurt! By comparison, I paid $16 at dinner for the Peachy Keen and was bummed I didn't like it. For me, it evened out, though.\\n\\nEnvironment: This place isn't for everyone, even outside of price point. I liked the piano guy, but my boyfriend didn't. The bar is set up sort of weird (he's a bartender and noticed), and there are what feels like some awkward exchanges in general between guests and staff. Maybe we're just weirdos and/or not comfortable everywhere? I mean, my dad and grandma would have loved this joint, and it was an upscale version of the sort of steakhouses we would go to in Chicago when I was a kid. In fact, there was an older gentleman at the bar who looked very similar to my father (who passed away five years ago), and it just made me happy to see that man so happy. It's just not our normal sort of food or environment we'd partake in, but we had a nice time overall."},{"name":"El Pueblo Mexican Restaurant","address":"7124 Aloma Ave","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4.5","text":"This is one of my favorite Mexican spots in all of Orlando.

You have to get lucky and come at a time that's not super busy or you might find yourself waiting a long time for a table in the small five-table restaurant or for your food. They have options for natural juices, which is one of my favorite parts about Spanish foods, and if you order a large they serve it in a small pitcher that's more than enough. \\n\\nThey have a ton of options for food to include tacos enchiladas and sopes which are a couple of my favorites that can order a la carte in any combination.

The chicken was delicious and a huge portion for $12. They packaged mine to go on accident, but it was stuffed inside the to-go container. 3 meals worth at least. The rice with curry on top tastes vaguely indian... lots of cardamom and other indian type spices. Super tasty. The spaghetti has a couple of tiny meat bits mixed up with the red sauce.

All of the dishes we ordered were pretty good, but I feel like you wouldn't be getting your money's worth if you did not order the steak. The steak was amazing - a great crust and perfectly rare - and it was served with damn good potatoes which were probably the highlight of the meal. The dessert selection was pretty standard - the sorbet trio was light and refreshing, the chocolate mousse not too sweet or thick, and the coconut cake had me itching for a cup of coffee. \\n\\nOverall, the ambiance of the setting and the charm of the South End made this a nice venture for Dine Out.

It was the most bitter drink I've had, and tasted nothing like a Truly seltzer or like pineapple.

The tap cut out *again* halfway through pouring the glass. The bartender gave me half a Truly to enjoy while fixing the tap (again). I appreciated that. This drink was definitely sweeter than the first, but still tasted nothing like a Truly in a can.\\n\\nWe waited 60 minutes and were seated for our meal - yay! Our waitress was incredibly friendly (good job, hiring team!). We had water poured quite quickly after being seated (yay!), but then it wasn't refilled after being empty for quite some time. We ended up asking for more water towards the end of our meal.\\n\\nThe Ugly:\\nTheir TV stream kept freezing. It's a good thing I didn't care about the football game that was on every TV. It's ironic that in a restuarant that's connected to TD Garden, they couldn't play a sports game on the TVs without issue. \\n\\nEvery single beverage is served in plastic glasses. Apparently it's so people can bring their drinks into the concert venue. Couldn't you just pour drinks into a plastic cup if people are heading into the concert, versus making a $15 margarita feel super cheap in a plastic cup while dining in the restaurant?\\n\\nI'll admit that outside of knowing Guy Fieri is tied to the term Flavortown, I know nothing about him. Going into his restaurant, my expectations in terms of flavor were through the roof. If you're the \\"Mayor of Flavortown\\", shouldn't your food be flavorful? Well, it wasn't. We ordered 3 of the 6 tacos on the menu, as well as the Trash Can Nachos. I've never had such bland tacos in my entire life. They were lacking any type of flavor. Every table seemed to be ordering the Trash Can Nachos and filming the removal of the can. Yay Instagram? I'll take food that tastes good over Instagrammable food, though.  It's definitely a one-and-done for me in terms of dining at the Tequila Cocina. \\n\\n--\\n\\nOverall, some of the issues I think we can say are written off because it was their first night (TV issues, tap issues, water refilling issues)... but will the flavor of the food really improve? I do hope the food improves... but I'm guessing it won't, and I'm sure they'll be successful anyways because they're tied to a famous person, TD Garden & North Station.\\n\\n2 stars because the staff was nice and the ambiance was cool... would have been 1 star otherwise!"},{"name":"Domino's Pizza","address":"1606 E Parmer Ln, Ste 200","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"This review is for \\"Logan\\" I work in the customer service industry and go above and beyond to help anyone out when I can.

Told him my address, says I was out of his delivery area. I asked if I could just show up outside of his shop and him deliver it to me outside since it would be paid for over the phone. A simple exchange, he said anything and everything not to help me out with my order. I just wanted a pizza lol. I'd like to think maybe it's because he's afraid of being robbed or maybe that's the reason he couldn't help me out. If he would've just told me it was due to that then I understand.

I would not recommend that drink. I also had a Pomegranate Martini that was slightly better.  \\nWe were surprised when the meals were delivered to the table on very small plates; the amount of food was not in line with their prices.

Then you can tell the waiter how many you have and in our case it was a party of 10 to 12 people. We sat down, ordered some drinks.\\n\\nFrom there, you choose on the taco menu how you want your tacos prepared. I got the hard shell and soft shell combination and loved both options. Then you can pick your protein of meats. If you don't eat meat there are also vegetarian options. Then your vegetables and cheese at the end.\\n\\nBetween 2 to 3 tacos should make the average person full depending how many ingredients you add to the taco. I usually get full with 2 alone. The texture and taste of each taco is just unique compared to your local taco bell where it's just standard pre-made tacos.\\n\\nCondado is just overall a great place to get together with friends whether for lunch or dinner or any sort of event it basically caters to everything.

The chicken tender melt, buffalo-style, is a super satisfying sandwich.  Their burger does everything right, especially if you can get it medium rare.

While I was waiting I thought why not speak to the woman so I asked \\"I just seen you blow your nose don't you think you should wash your hands\\" she had an attitude she said I blew my nose in paper, her words not mine, and I used hand sanitizer. I said nothing more, I backed up because (A) I did not observe her use anything to clean her hands, and (B) hand sanitizer does not take the place or substitute for soap and water. As a matter of fact what happened to the use of gloves in the fast food work place. The disregard did not end there because as I waited for the other server whom was working she never came over to serve or acknowledge me waiting there.

They have a wonderfully attentive staff and a solid menu. I primarily come here for brunch on Sundays when they open at noon. It is quiet but not as quiet as an empty home that used to be filled with joy, love, and laughter. No, it is quiet in a comforting way that let's you feel like you are part of something greater than yourself even as you sit alone, counting the seconds until 12:30PM when you can finally sip on a tasty, spicy BM. They have great specials and though I do not order them every time, they are always enticing. They have a patio that is a blessing on nice Sunday afternoons and it is close enough to the sidewalk that you are able to feel like you are included in the many passing conversations of couples, friends, and families. It is important to get out of the house and interact with others every now and then. My roommate Norman travels a lot for work and my ex wife Ida has not been consistently returning my phone calls about being able to see our boy more often.

For me, a standout is the tuna sashimi appetizer.  If you are not super hungry, this can make a great meal.  The buckwheat noodles are somewhat filling and there is sushi-grade tuna and seaweed on top.  On the side are some dollops of sriracha and wasabi.  It's delish!  The Mediterranean plate is another solid choice, especially if you want to avoid fried foods.  You get an assortment of raw veggies, some pita, and a good amount of hummus.  \\n\\nIn terms of drinks, I'd say they are at their best with beer and mixed drinks.

That flavor is only achieved by using wok with high flame.\\n\\nService still left much to be desired. So hard to get anyone's attention.

The food was far worse than I ever thought an Americanized Chinese restaurant could be. This place was so bad that I actually had to order myself a second dinner (from somewhere else, thank god) after I threw out nearly all of the Beijing Wok \\"food\\".\\n\\nOrange chicken -- I'm pretty sure there were no oranges involved in the creation of the dish -- it tasted like they used some orange scented Palmolive as a substitute. On top of that, the chicken was tough and fatty. There were also  \\"mushrooms\\" in the mix. They were actually pretty tasty, if you like moldy drywall. Oh, and the brocolli was brown and waaaaay overcooked.\\n\\nHot and sour soup -- Okay, but WAY too salty.\\n\\nEgg rolls -- Generic, cheap Chinese egg rolls -- the kind that every Chinese take-out place has. \\n\\nChicken wings -- Probably the best tasting item in my order (and that's not even a compliment). It was a tiny fried chicken wing.\\n\\nFried buns -- These were okay.\\n\\nSpring Rolls (the authentic ones in rice paper) -- These were pretty decent.\\n\\nSesame Tofu: The sauce was okay, but the tofu itself wasn't very good. Not at all crisp, for supposedly being fried. Just small, squishy tofu.The broccoli that came with it was pretty bad tasting - almost as if they used canned broccoli, if that is even a thing.\\n\\nI don't think I'd ever hazard ordering a \\"meal\\" from this place again."},{"name":"AVA Cucina","address":"107 Ripley Rd","city":"Cohasset","stars":"3.5","text":"Gave this place another try.
