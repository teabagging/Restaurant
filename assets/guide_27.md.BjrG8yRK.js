He ordered 1/2 a chicken with a regular side.\\n\\nThe chicken looked amazing as our server was cutting it up...plump and juicy and the smells were incredible!   The pricing for the chicken is very reasonable as well...$3.49 for a 1/4 chicken beats Bill Miller's (BM) price of $4.99....$5.69 if you want white meat.   Their 1/2 chicken was right on par at 6.49 same as Miller's.\\n\\nOn to the sides... this is where I had my first disappointment.   Serving alongside of this mouth-watering chicken were somewhat non-traditional sides.  (I say non-traditional becuase I would find it hard to believe that Peruvians eat french fries, mac & cheese, corn on the cob, and pasta salad.)  They did offer basmati rice and mashed potatoes which might be more traditional but perhaps not in the style offered.   For an additional .75 you could upgrade your side to something more traditional in the Yucca fries or the fried plantains, or something healthier with their fresh salad or vegetable medley.   I opted for the vegetable medley since the looks of their salad options were pretty scarce...although I should mention that the veggies were pretty much just \\"frozen mixed blend\\" consisting of carrots, green beans, red peppers, and some broccoli.\\n\\nOn top of the options for sides being a bit disappointing was the price:   $1.89 for a regular side, $2.64 for a premium side.   This is about .40 more for a regular portion at the before mentioned BBQ joint....and even there I can get a pint of one of their sides for less than a premium side here at Inka's.\\n\\nOk, selections made, we went to check out.   Doing the math we opted to forgo the combo meal since we didn't want the soda and just get the chicken and side:\\n\\nCombo Route:\\n1/4 Chicken Combo: $6.49  (1/4 chicken, 1 side, drink)\\n1/2 Chicken Combo: $9.49  (1/2 chicken, 1 side, drink)\\nTotal:16.73 + tax: $18.11   (this includes the extra .75 for my premium side)\\n\\nOur Route:\\n1/4 Chicken: $3.49\\n1/2 Chicken: $6.49\\nReg side: 1.89\\nPremium side: 2.64\\nTotal for our order: 14.51+tax: $15.71\\n\\nUnfortunately, we could not get the kid at the register to understand that we just got the chicken and sides...NOT the combo....so we ended up paying more than we should have.  We thought about taking it up with a manager but it was opening day and the kids were new at the registered....they all looked a bit scared and tired at the same time...so we just let it slide...this time.  :o)\\n\\nTASTE\\n\\nThe chicken was great....very moist and full of flavor.   I opted to pull most of the skin of of mine simply for health reasons but I did taste one piece and the seasonings were rich and bold....very enjoyable.   They also offer two sauces, hot and mild, which I found amusing becuase I expected them to be similar with just heat variances.  However, they are totally different.  The hot sauce is not really that hot, but being an native Texan and believing that jalapenos are one of the main food groups, it could just be my preferences.   The flavor of this sauce was wonderful...a little spicy and good jalapeno flavor....reminded me a little of salsa without too much tomato.  The mild sauce was more of a mustard style sauce that I found good but not as much as the spicy one.\\n\\nThe side were as unmemorable as my first thoughts of them....mashed  potatoes were pretty plain as they usually are and veggies not having a ton of flavor either.   I suppose I should have opted for the yucca fries or the plantains but I tend to stay away from fried foods and I already knew I didn't like fried plantains....\\n\\nDESERTS\\n\\nI didn't get one but they did have the following available:\\nTres Leches\\nKey Lime Cheesecake\\nChoc Chipolte Torte\\nInka's Delight\\nFlan\\nSoft Ice Cream\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nI think that this place will be great for picking up some tasty chicken via the drive through for a quick dinner at home but probably not much more than that.... I hope that they decide to update their sides just a bit to include more traditional (or at least traditionally prepared) options or at least bring the prices down a bit.... $2.64 is just a bit much for a portion of  once-frozen veggies without much flavor.\\n\\nmy two cents.

I'm a huge fan of the Margherita pizza, and occasionally add pepperoni to it. Unfortunately, modifying their signature pizzas creates an additional cost as the signature price no longer applies and you are charged for each topping separately.

It had a good amount of porky-umami savoriness without O.D.ing on the cabbage. That said, the bun was a little dry and the filling very compact which led to it rolling out of the bun when it was bitten. The XLB by itself was pretty bland but perked up with the addition of the soy / vinegar / ginger sauce. Half of the dumplings stuck to the paper they came on, leading to unavoidable tears in the wrapper and loss of broth. The beef ho fun was flavorless & forgettable. What it lacked in pieces of beef & noodles it more than made up for with bean sprouts.

I said to myself, \\"Self, the brisket will have to work to be better than the prime rib.\\"  Let me tell you, the brisket delivered and blew the prime rib away.  The moist brisket is moist, tender, and juicy, yet isn't just globs of fat.  Both the brisket and the prime rib have a bark heavy with black pepper, making this possibly the spiciest BBQ I've had.  Combine that with a sauce that's hotter than Rudy's was back in its heyday and you have an explosion of spicy, hot BBQ.  For an early summer lunch in Texas, that's damned good.  I almost neglected to mention the sample piece of brisket, which I think came from the lean end.   Also a super flavor with a slightly more concentrated beef taste.

There is live entertainment in half of the place and another half where you can still hear the music but at a much diminished level. There is a lounge menu and a dining room menu, both offering what looks like regional and mainly typical preparations. They have copies of these menus as you get off the elevator on the 52nd floor. Unfortunately what you see on those menus are not the same as what they hand you at the table. There are signs clearly telling you that this isn't the floor on which you can just walk around and see the view. Makes sense as you don't want to disturb diners. Unfortunately, the 50th floor observation deck that is specifically for walking around and seeing the view was closed when we attempted to to go there at 10:00 after dinner.

The lobster wouldn't come out of the shell in its entirety, the crab was pitifully small and tasteless, the shrimp was ok but small and I didn't dare try anything else. The salads were excellent. Very fresh. The candied pecans were the best part, which may not say much for the salads themselves, but they were very good.

That's what happened here tonight. I'll start by saying my dishes were fine (not delicious, just fine). My boyfriend ordered French onion soup to start and the bread that was in it was charred - I could clearly see it from across the table. He's been eating that soup as long as I've known him and never disliked it until tonight. The waitress came back after taking it away and basically whispered to us that she was taking it off the bill...strange to whisper but ok. After being there for over an hour our meals finally came out. I got eggplant parm with pasta which was fine. My boyfriend got the pan seared scallop dish and when they put it down I literally said \\"where are the scallops\\" because there was about 4 1/2 rubbery looking scallops on top of a huge bed of risotto. It didn't look appetizing. He didn't think the dish tasted good at all. The waitress picked up on that but when we got the bill it was  $55 - way too much to be spending on a less than par meal. The manager swooped in to say he'd take care of the scallop dish. Moments later the chef, Joe, who's apparently the owner appeared at our table. His demeanor immediately made me feel uncomfortable. He started (loudly) giving my boyfriend a hard time about not liking his dishes. Basically saying there was nothing wrong with the soup or scallops and implying that my boyfriend didn't know what he was talking about. Mind you, neither of us ever complain about restaurant meals. He was belligerent, rude, and inappropriate. In my opinion he should've apologized for us not enjoying the meals and offered some sort of compensation to come back another time. But since he made me feel intimidated and uncomfortable to the point that my heart was racing is unacceptable. He was raising his voice to my boyfriend with multiple customers around. Both of us were absolutely floored that a business owner would verbally attack a customer like that, we left speechless. Our poor waitress came over mortified and apologizing on behalf of him saying how unprofessional it was of him. No wonder she whispered to us about removing the soup! It's very unfortunate this happened because I like supporting local businesses in town but we will never return to this establishment."},{"name":"Santouka Harvard Square","address":"1 Bow St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Love the Kara-Age (fried chicken).

The octopus was perfectly grilled and served with a creme fraiche, tiny potatoes, chorizo and herbs. The fried oysters came with pickles and a white barbecue sauce.

Plenty of awesome beer to go around, right?! I only give them the two stars because the beer was tolerable and I save the one stars for the really atrocious. The food was just awful. I mean...awful. I got the reuben sans sauerkraut.  Being from the east coast I'm a little spoiled when it comes to deli, but this sandwich was just an insult to deli everywhere. I realize I asked for no sauerkraut but I always get it that way because I just hate the stuff. I've had wonderful to decent reubens prepared the same way. This thing I was served had like a baby spoon worth of thousand island dressing, hardly any cheese, toast like cardboard (yes, toast)  and deli meat so bad it would make Woody Allen cry. It's that bad, folks. My friend was equally displeased with what she ordered, the pork toast she got looked absolutely rancid and disgusting. She didn't eat it. The blond who served us was rude, unpersonable, couldn't be bothered to remember we were on separate checks, and clearly preoccupied with the cute young hipsters across the room. Our food was sitting on the counter getting cold while she chatted them up, I almost got up and retrieved it for myself. I would definitely NOT go back there for any kind of food, whatsoever.

Not that cheesy, and again a bit on the dry side.  The lobster wontons were good with the mango sauce, but there was very little lobster in them.  Entree...had the panang curry with tofu.  That was very creamy and tasty.  Annoyed they charge $1 for an extra small bowl of white rice.  Husband had what was called the bird's nest.  I got to try it, and it was good, too.

I had already planned a couple sight seeing and typical Atlanta landmarks and restaurants, so I was looking for something unique that they didn't have back home. \\n\\nWe ended up at Poor Calvin's on a Friday night. There was a little bobbing and weaving involved, and a bunch of homeless people gathered on the sidewalk and wandering into the street from the mission around the corner. There was a guy or two walking around and shouting right outside the car, so it was a little disconcerting at first. \\n\\nWe found street parking and they had a table ready. I like the exposed brick inside. The wall decor was trying to be whimsical, I guess. But it didn't do anything for me. \\n\\nWe started with dumplings and the lobster mac and cheese to share. The dumplings had chili oil or something, but overall I wasn't wowed. I could make something similar at home, so skip those. The lobster mac n cheese was rich and creamy and hit the spot (although really, it was kind of light on the lobster as a shared appetizer; for one person I probably would have been okay with the lobster proportion). \\n\\nWe ordered the pineapple fried rice, pad thai, and lamb rack. The pineapple fried rice came out in half a pineapple. It was enjoyable, but there are better things on the menu. The pad thai was good: it came with big tiger shrimp with a light brushing of gochujang, and there was dill and other herbs scattered on the top that gave it an interesting flavor. The lamb was the highlight: good portion, cooked well, very flavorful (again, with the gochujang), and came with a lot of veggies. \\n\\nWe finished the night with their suspension cake, which was layers of red velvet.

But if you're gonna be adventurous and try something pretzel-impaled or cereal-topped then you've come to the right place. \\n\\nVoodoo Doughnuts. Just the name conjures up that neon-glowing little voodoo man, \\"Keep Portland Weird\\" bumper stickers, and herds of adolescents gripping large pink doughnut-filled boxes while strutting down SW 3rd avenue. \\n  \\nLet's get to the point. Haters be hatin' on Voodoo for a few reasons. There is always a huge line of out-of-state folks lining up on the sidewalk because they saw this place on TV. \\n\\nThe doughnuts are just that...doughnuts. People expect that because there is a huge line, these donuts possess some god-like doughnut quality... Well guess what; they don't. People think these bundles of fried flour and water are imbued with a mystical quality. They want to have some transcendental experience when they go here because there is a super long line. They also get mad because they fallaciously assume because it's super popular, it's delicious. But guess what? The popular taste isn't always geared towards quality. In this case it's geared towards novelty. But novelty can still satisfy drunken urges at 1:30 in the morning...\\n\\nPeople tend to get mad at Voodoo because their donuts are not the freshest or tastiest. But I don't think that's what they're going for. They're going for weirdness, and succeeding on all fronts. How many donut shops can you think of that are open 24 hours? \\n\\nI had a voodoo donut at 1 am the other day because I was craving something chewy and loaded with fat and sugar. Voodoo delivered the goods. It was a mess of insanely sweet raspberry jelly, rich chocolaty frosting, and soft chewy goodness. There were only three people in the line and I tore through that doughnut. I was in and out in less than a minute.

I also ordered the foul play...the chicken and waffles except they don't do waffles after 4pm so I ordered the foul play with pancakes (chicken and pancakes).

But it's on the other page of the Menu where things come alive.\\n\\nFirstly, they serve up Oaxacan Tamales. These are the ones served in banana leaves and have a consistency very different than traditional Mexican Tamales. It has to do with the way the masa is made with lime (the stone, not the fruit) to separate the soft stuff from the rough stuff. These aren't quite as white and glutinous as the ones you can get from the Farmer's Market or Oaxacan Tamaleo, but this is where I will come to get my local fix. Could these infact be \\"Breakfast Tamales\\"? My favorite so far is the Potato and Poblano Tamale.\\n\\nThe Tacos Ahogados were very fresh and tasty. The preparation with tomatillo/avocado salsa and cabbage reminded me of actually being on the Coast in Mexico. The Agua Frescas were not too sweet.

So, we came back today--guess what? All you offered was a few sorry plain bagels. The guy said \\"we stopped carrying them so much since they didn't sell.\\" Who? What? Where? I am so confused.

The pork belly was amazing...perfectly cooked and juicy with a deep flavor.  It came with a cucumber kimchi and some charred pineapples, which added a very nice tangy/spicy/sweet to go with the savory of the pork.  \\n\\nFor dinner I had the shellfish wood roast, which was beyond delicious.  It should be noted that this dish requires you to do some work (shell cracking, peeling, etc), but it is 100% worth it if you love fresh seafood.  The dish has mussels, whole local shrimp, and half of a lobster still in the shell, all of which was roasted in a chili lime sauce with fresh garlic.  The sauce was just the right amount of heat and lime to complement the shellfish without over powering the natural flavor of the fresh seafood.  I haven't had shrimp and lobster that good in a long long time.  \\n\\nI had ordered wine with dinner, and they have a very cool \\"wine on tap\\" system that keeps the wine in barrels, and allows you to order a glass or a varying size of carafe of a couple of dozen different wines.  \\n\\nFor dessert we ordered the memphis mud bar, which had a peanut butter mousse filling topped with a chocolate ganache and served with a scoop of banana ice cream.

Unfortunately having worked in restaurants off and on for more than 20 years, some things really bother me like inconsistent pricing. \\n\\nI've been here a handful of times and have enjoyed it. Been here for dinner, brunch and lunch. \\n\\nI noticed today though, the bartender got a little over zealous with the pricing. \\n\\nWhen I ordered Vodka, soda and a cranberry splash - I asked for titos. \\"We only have Kettle.\\" Keep in mind, I can see the bar shelf and there are others but sure - give me top shelf. I will take it! \\n\\nI ordered a salad with salmon. They automatically gave me large, totally fine with that. I asked if this was the warm bacon vinegarette dressing. Clearly it wasn't. She said \\"its made fresh everyday from different chefs so it looks different.\\" I just let it go knowing that it wasn't cause their dressing is 1) warm and 2) has bacon in it. I specifically remember what I have had before. I was hungry and just kept on eating. Too tired to argue and the salad was so good, didn't care. \\n\\nGetting the bill...\\nHaving an add on of salmon normally doesn't mean double price of the salad (9.99) especially if the piece was small. It wasn't like that last time. Did something change? Market price for chicken is 4.99 for an add on. Salmon should be around 6.99 tops. But instead - same price as whole salad. Ok, it was good and I got over that too. \\n\\nHowever, I had 2 top shelf drinks with a splash of cranberry juice. I was charged $3 for the splash. Seriously?!? My drink literally had a splash and was barely even pink. And the bartender was waiting on me? I'd understand if it was a server who had to type it in the computer just to pick up the drink. But there is really no excuse for that. I did ask her \\"were you bringing me a glass of cranberry? You charged me for one.\\" She did take it off and said the computer did it. Ok.... \\n\\nWill I be back? Maybe, only because my sister is obsessed with the french toast.

We actually left the restaurant and didn't eat our food. This is my first Yelp review and unfortunately it had to be a negative one. We ordered a laksa noodle soup (where you get to pick the broth, type of noodle & toppings) and another dish. The laksa soup didn't look right as it was neon yellow. We've had laksa at a few different places, including at M cafe in the past, so we definitely know what laksa soup should look and taste like, and this wasn't it. It tasted like curry! We asked the waitress if that was laksa soup and she seems unsure since the colour of the soup was off. She took our food to the kitchen to check and was told that they had a few complaints that their laksa soup was too spicy so they decided to tweak it. We told the waitress it didn't taste good and that there was no laksa taste at all. She offered to get us the menu so we can pick something else.  She came back with no menu, however with a message from the manager saying that we can not order anything different on the menu except for another noodle soup. The only thing they could do is to change the kind of broth. That's absolutely ridiculous! We explained to her that we didn't like any other kind of broth and would prefer to order a rice or fried noodle dish instead (this would've cost more than the noodle soup anyway) but she said no it wasn't her decision. We asked if they were just going to dump out the laksa broth and reuse the ingredients with another broth and she said no. Somehow I doubt that. It made no sense. If they were going to discard the entire bowl of noodle soup why won't they allow the customer to choose anything on the menu but rather restricting to order only noodle soup, unless they were going to reuse the ingredients. Long story short, the waitress went to get the manager since she has no authorization. We once again explained to the manager what they're doing is unacceptable. He didn't say anything except telling us that it is their version of laksa.  Needless to say we got up and left and won't be coming back.

It was a surprise from my friend R.  I didn't know where were going but once we got to the elevator of the Pru my eyes lit up like diamonds! I have always wanted to eat here and was super excited.\\n\\nThe first thing to note is it's 52 floors above ground.  The view is like no other save for perhaps the space needle in Seattle.  This to me was reason enough to go.  We were met by our lovely server, Jana [pronounced yana].  She was pleasant, knowledgeable and accommodating.   With the slow lunch crowd it would have been nice to have her more available than she was.  That said she was fairly decent.\\n\\nThe drink menu was quite impressive.  They offer a wide variety of wines and some decadent liquors, some going to $100.00 a shot.  We went with plain old water and some diet cokes.  I was a bit miffed when we found out after the fact that there weren't free refills on the soft drinks.  For what is being charged this should be in my opinion should be a given.\\n\\nThe menu for lunch was decent.  It wasn't an inspiring selection but it covered all the bases.  On retrospect I may have done better with a sandwich offering but I digress.  We started off with the Fried Point Judith Calamari which was finished with tomato coulis, banana peppers, and lemon parmesan peppercorn aioli.   i make no exaggeration that this was prepared perfectly.  The calamari was tender and crispy and the sauces complemented exquisitely.\\n\\nEntree's things went a tad south.  R had the Shrimp Spaghettini Arrabiata which was tossed with huge shrimp, basil, braised fennel, chili flakes and tomatoes.  It was quite good, I will not lie.  I think i was a bit put off that it was dried pasta instead of fresh.  Again, price and notoriety makes one expect more.  \\n\\nI had the Hanger Steak with garlic fries, port wine onions and bleu cheese butter.  The presentation was gorgeous.  A nice cone of crispy garlic fries and a stunning steak.  The issue with this is they overcooked to to a well done versus the medium I ordered.  plus it was touch as leather.  I didn't make a fuss because I was enjoying the notion of being at the Top of the Hub, plus being a gift.  It tasted great though.\\n\\nDessert of course not to be missed. We shared the Chocolate Banana Cream tart.  This was truly a work of art.  It was a rich custard of chocolate and banana with fresh sliced banana and served in a chocolate wonton shell.  The issue - the shell was completely inedible.  It had no flavor other than unsweetened cocoa and was hard and chewy.  The custard was wonderful but the shell completely took away any merit of calling it a tart.  A puff pastry shell, a plain pie crust, anything else could have rescued it.\\n\\nIn conclusion I might give it another try.  It is truly impressive to be frank.  The food however I could have obtained nearly anywhere for a much more modest price.  The bill ran about $100.00 for the two of us."},{"name":"Armando's Pizza & Subs","address":"163 Huron Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"I am a native New Yorker and admittedly a total pizza snob.

Then I saw people getting married in this place on a Food Network show, met the maple/bacon bar over the airwaves, and whilst living 3,000 miles away, started to crave a donut. That I don't usually like. \\n\\nOn my most recent trip to Portland we came upon the VD down an alley, with a pink pill shaped sign and a zombie with a steak in its heart, while going to the Portland Farmers Market. I was sold. There is was. Calling to me. No line, just the VD. When we approached the building, however, we were greeted with quite a long line and a 40 degree soggy PNW day. Thinking \\"it'll die down\\" we went about our business and returned a few hours later. Still with a line, but obviously worth the effort, we stood and waited for donuts. \\n\\nThe line was pleasant. Not a phrase I am accustomed to proclaiming, by the way. It moved fast, the building shielded a bit of the cold, we were stationed outside the 'Keep Portland Weird' sign seen in Portlandia (and on the streets of Portland for those who are more familiar, of course), a funny man selling the homeless newspaper cajoled people in line--making them laugh with his sales tactics---, and the donuts were ahead. \\n\\nLess than 30 minutes later we were inside with a plethora of combinations to choose from, good smells, happy (if anxious) people waiting to try or get something their palates were craving. I decided amongst the stimuli which included pink walls, unique lighting, and crazy decor...I had to write (err...type on my iphone) our list. Otherwise we would appear (accurately) as VD virgins who were holding up the show. \\n\\nI made a list and handed my phone over. Five minutes and one large pink box later, we were out of there. Nearly a dozen treats to delight a little later in the day...though I would have loved to sit and try one right there, it was getting cold. I also regret not trying the Stumptown coffee, but I was in a bit of a rush to get the donuts and forgot about the classic companion. \\n\\nOf the donuts we got, the cereal coated was the least admired. I prefer dense, uncomplicated donuts, and also coconut, so I tried the vanilla coconut, a chocolate coconut, and a Mexican hot chocolate variety. All get thumbs up, with the Mexican hot chocolate being my favorite for the kick and surprise it provided. Yum! \\n\\nThere were cream filled, jelly filled, bar shape, round shape, and colored concoctions in the box. So far no one has complained. \\n\\nAs someone who would not claim to be a donut fan, these are well done and quite tasty. They are fresh, flavorful, and interesting. All good things. \\n\\nAfter all this writing, I think I'm going to rummage through that pink box to see what remains. Try the VD....it worth the wait, and your taste buds with thank you. \\n\\nAlso, avoid the real VD by practicing safer sex, and have a nice day ;)"},{"name":"Mediterranea","address":"332 Ormond St SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Couldn't believe that everything on the menu was gluten free!

Date made the reservation in advance for 8 pm on a Friday night. First off, I don't know why they set up the valet to go through the garage. It's convenient to get dropped off right by the entrance but since they use the same method for getting your car afterwards, this creates a logistical disaster for the valet. Imagine 30 people standing at the door to the restaurant waiting for their cars...new customers are still pulling in. Not enough valet guys so they don't even open your door. My date was observant and opened my side of the door for me to get in. But this also backs cars up. Valet is a clusterfuck. I would just park elsewhere and walk. \\n\\nOverpriced alcohol. But I guess all new hip places are doing this so I can't blame them. $10 ain't enough for a shot of liquor over ice. But we ATLiens are used to this. Onto seating. So I kind of have this expectation that when u have a reservation, they would avoid seating u at the middle aisle tables where ur elbows on both sides are getting bumped by every single wait staff that walk by u. I was very annoyed by the distraction and commotion of sitting at a small 2 person table in the middle of the aisle. Those tables should be used for walk ins, in my opinion.\\n\\nI picked the appetizer and main dish that the wait staff had recommended to be his favorite. I expected them to be out of this world delicious. Not so much. Standard fried calamari, which was a dinner portion and not an appetizer portion. My date and I filled up on this ginormous bowl of calamari that we couldn't actually finish our main dish. I ordered some kind of a fall off the bone pork dish that waiter recommended. It was aiite. Yes, it fell off the bone with fork. Flavor wise, nothing spectacular. And it came with an extra bone with no meat on it. I wondered what that was about.....hm.....confused.....my date had sword fish. Again, good. Not out of this world. \\n\\nGreat service. Waiter came by frequently. But did not offer a doggy bag although it was quite a bit of main dish left. I guess this is such a hipster place that no one dares to take a doggy bag or the waiter was simply being lazy. Or perhaps I would have asked for one if it was that delicious. Haha. I wasn't that impressed by the food. But will give it a few more tries because I wondered what that grill bar was all about. So I will have to check that out and maybe another visit during the week when it's not uber crowded. But since I was with a lovely date with great convo and he actually made a reservation here and drove over an hours distance from otp, I wasn't really annoyed about their mediocre food, bad recommendations by the waiter, and sitting at an aisle table.

It's easier on the pocket book, and lets us try more places in Boulder and Niwot. We went to The Leaf this week, and quickly became big fans of this place. After watching Food, Inc. last year, we committed to adopting a diet with more raw and organic veggies. We are trying to move away from animal products unless they are locally and sustainably raised (not corn fed). Anyway, we loved everything about The Leaf. It was a quiet Wednesday and very peaceful. We ordered Chai, House black organic tea, Jamaican Jerk Tempeh and the Reuben, along with a raw wrap appetizer. The nutty pestos in the appetizer were tantalizing, and I was pleasantly surprised by how good a veggie Reuben with carmelized onions could be. The Jamaican Jerk Tempeh won best in show, and is worth ordering for presentation alone. A delight in every bite! We left completely invigorated and satisfied, and will be back there soon for happy hour and infused martinis, or the three course menu. Major thumbs up! Thank you Leaf, for inspiring me to become at least mostly vegetarian.

I did understand that I have to wait since no reservation was made in advance, so was looking for the chair to sit down and wait. There are six chairs near the entrance, providing seats for people waiting, and four of them were occupied by a group of four girls. Before I was about to sit down, the waiter yelled \\"No table. You have to go outside!\\" I didn't understand so explained I could wait for the table, then he refused again. I further confirmed if I can order take out, he said \\"No! We are closing out!\\" The group of four girls noticed and confirmed with the waiter that they could wait. This makes me question why the take out orders couldn't be made. \\"You cannot do take out unless you want to go to the kitchen to cook!\\" This time everyone in the restaurant noticed his angry and loud voice.

Overall, i would say a definite choice for a light lunch any day of the week, (sundays being my favorite)."},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"There are certain bites of food that make you close your eyes and say a silent prayer to the god of your choice.

I challenged my friend as to whether he could think of a dish that wouldn't be improved by bacon, and he couldn't think of one.  So any place that serves a Bloody Mary with bacon infused Dripping Springs Vodka and garnishes it with a whole strip of bacon and a cheese cube is pretty bad ass in my book.  \\n\\nSo dear reader, you may be asking, what's so great about a place that serves cylindrically shaped pork products covered in bacon, anybody could do that?

We would almost always see the bright yellow Victoria's sign from the T during our commutes to and from south station and comment that the place looked like a typical cheap, Chinese takeout spot (and who would ever want/expect to have good, fresh seafood from a place like that, especially since they advertise their twin-lobster special right underneath aforementioned yellow signage in an equally bright, pink color).\\n\\nBoy, were we wrong.\\n\\nAfter moving into the neighborhood, we decided to try Victoria's for takeout on Chinese New Year (of all days, right?) for some Buddha's delight and Vegetable Lo Mein. Sooo good. All the ingredients in the former were cooked perfectly and made me feel like I was eating my momma's yummy homecooked version. Vegetable Lo Mein was alright, had to add some soy sauce to get the flavor to my liking. Since then, we've gotten take-out numerous times. Peking raviolis (why not just call them dumplings!? One time I tried ordering dumplings only to be told that they didn't have them, was then later informed by a Bostonian that they are called raviolis up here, reh), sesame beef, roast pork lo mein (char siu, yes!), chow mein, and beef chow foon are among our favorites; all are very consistent in terms of flavor and portion size. Only complaints are the wonton soup (wontons tasted off, broth wasn't flavorful), egg foo young (have had better), and sesame shrimp (meh).

We wanted it to be great. Final verdict, trailer is impeccably done on the outside, a real draw, polished and great neon, but the food was unacceptable. Had chicken, mac and cheese and fries. Fries were very good. Chicken was not. It appeared to be overcooked or fried twice, not sure but the outside was well past the golden brown, but at the same time very greasy, which made me think maybe they partially cook it earlier, then pull it it out of the fridge and drop it in the fryer to finish it off due to how long it takes to actually fry chicken correctly and have it completely done. We did not have to wait long enough for our order to be ready for that to happen. The meat of the chicken was ok, but isn't it just as much about the skin? The crispy fried morsels of skin that make you gravitate  toward the fried chicken in the first place. We got an 8 piece bucket and left 4 pieces and it wasn't because we were full. The puzzling part also(although it really doesn't matter due to our dissatisfaction w/ the chicken) was I would have assumed if you ordered an 8 piece bucket for $15.00 you would be getting basiaclly a whole chicken (2 wings ,2 thighs, 2 breasts and 2 legs), but do not assume that. We got 4 wings, 1 breast and 3 thighs.....I know that does add up to 8......I guess I should have asked. The mac and cheese needs a ton of help at least it did the evening we were there.

Nice looking restaurant and moreover they have patio to sit outside with a good view of downtown. \\n\\nNow come to food. As their name says it is only buffet. Yes if you want to avoid buffet and order dishes and naan, well then you are at wrong place. Their was only one employee who was kind of welcoming guest and picking up dishes. I said kind of because it was kind of not very pleasant welcome and seems arrogant to me.

Chilli Chicken was missing. I just went to buffet because I wanted to have some snacks before meal. So my first look was at tandoori chicken. Believe me guys it looked so disgusting. Tandoori chicken is suppose to be red and juicy. But here it was black because of way too much of over cook and it was dry and pieces were bite size as they cut it to small pieces which didn't make sense to me as it suppose to be full thigh and full leg at least. Anyways I tried one piece and it was horrible. Next thing I tried was spring roll and only could taste the outer layer as the filling inside almost next to nothing.\\n\\nNext is meal. Butter chicken and chicken curry I tried was good in appearance and good in taste. Potato and coleslaw salad was good as well. Didn't tried other salads as they looked all right. Their so called tava vegetable dish looked horrible so i skipped( Tava means something you make dry on flat surface but it wasn't the case here it had thick curry in it so the name of the dish is wrong itself). Allo gobhi was not too bad taste wise but it was little over done as well. Raita(yogurt) had way too much of spices in it.\\nNow comes to interesting part. Naan is most important part of our indian meal. But seemed like they didn't care about it. Naans looked it they were sitting their for while and was so hard, thick and cold. My opinion if a restaurant cant serve you nice hot and fresh naan, better to avoid them in future.\\n\\nTo cap all, not a place for someone who care about food quality. If you are from different community and don't have much experienced of indian food then I would say try some where else as you will experience better indian aroma and flavours hopefully."},{"name":"Home Slice Pizza","address":"1415 S Congress St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Lmao I love Austin Texas and their amazinly clever food marketing and advertising.

The beef tartare was by far the best dish I had, while the kale salad was dressed well and had a lot of flavor.  The worst dish was the gnocchi special.

History is another: this is the birthplace of Chick-fil-A.  Were this Dwarf House's only asset, it would not deserve a place in the pantheon of Atlanta eateries.  But if you have only a few hours between flights, and can afford a cab to the nearby community of Hapeville, the best way to experience Atlanta's warm welcome is to place yourself in the care of Tammy and her co-workers.\\n\\nIf you really are a dwarf, or if you're a child, Dwarf House has an entrance just for you.  I stooped through it as a joke, but it's a functioning entryway and a testament to the difference between Dwarf House and any other Chick-fil-A location on Earth.  Here's one more difference:\\n\\nYou can be served on Sunday at Dwarf House.  Sort of.  If you're up early enough, or late enough, you can visit before 4am on the Lord's day and still get your fix of sweet tea or deep-fried peach pie.  After 4am, Dwarf House remains closed until midnight makes it Monday again -- after which they're open 24 hours a day until 4am Sunday.\\n\\nTammy, our server, is the very soul of Southern hospitality.  We were truly her GUESTS, and she would have it no other way.  She was unfailingly courteous, welcoming, happy to explain or recommend menu items, happy to discuss the history of Dwarf House, and under no circumstances did she ever let our glasses become half-full without offering a refill.  On the other hand, we felt that we had the conversation to ourselves.  Tammy has perfected the art of watching like a mother hen (you should pardon the analogy) without hovering.  I can honestly say that being Tammy's guest was among the finest examples of hospitality which it has ever been my pleasure to experience.  I can't bring myself to call it great \\"customer service\\" because, in my opinion, \\"customer service\\" is what companies offer in lieu of hospitality.  Tammy's hospitality is the real deal.\\n\\nI had a baked potato with cheese and smothered (grilled) onions, and let me tell you, the 30 cents I was charged for the onions wouldn't even buy that much onion at a store.  It was enough to cover the potato even after I splayed it out, dissection-style, on the plate.  That should give you some idea of the quantity and price.\\n\\nI also had a side salad, another good value.  Chunks of broccoli accompanied tiny sweet grape tomatoes on top, and the Truett's House dressing (a French-style dressing, with pickle juice as the third ingredient) was a refreshing change from ranch, blue cheese, and vinaigrette.  A packet of sunflower seeds and a packet of croutons made the salad better than I felt I had a right to expect for only around two dollars.\\n\\nIf you'd like to be Tammy's guest -- and who, janitor or monarch, wouldn't? -- she's currently working afternoons and nights, from 2pm to 10pm.

As you open the door, it actually looks like you are inside a ship. \\n\\nFriendly staff and diners with great southern hospitality and conversation going on. You definitely don't get this kind of crowd in the city, especially in Philly.. which is very refreshing. Many tourists don't stop by here... and sheesh, they don't know what they're missing out on.\\n\\nGetting quality seafood here won't cost you a pretty penny compared to other places. A bucket of oysters for 18?? A steal! They are shucked with such finesse and skill. Order them raw - they're guaranteed to be fresh, sweet and tasty. The snow crab legs were bangin.  A bucket of oysters, steamed seafood platter, and crawfish platter, totaled up to be no more than $50. Not too shabby....\\n\\nSigh, I wish we lived closer."},{"name":"McMenamins Kennedy School","address":"5736 NE 33rd Ave.","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"McMenamins haters, it's time to back off.\\n\\nThe Kennedy School is my fav of the McMenamins empire. When I first moved to P-Town and my hubby told me about a school that had been converted to a bar, I began salivating even before he was done describing all the amenities.\\n\\nRestaurant: Okay. Sometimes can be a long wait if you're with a large group and they are busy. Food is McMenamins food (not out of this world fantastic, but I crave those damn french fries and tator tots when I need good, greasy comfort food. And why can't they have a basket that contains both?! I feel like a lard-ass when I want to order one basket of each. And at 5'2\\", 115 lbs, it's odd to order both). The ceiling is decorated with a variety of neat pendant lighting, so if you're with boring company, you at least will have something interesting to look at.\\n\\nWhile their beer is also a mainstay, for some reason I love McMenamins' Greyhounds (vodka + grapefruit juice). They manage to have the right amount of vodka and not-too-sweet but not-too-sour grapefruit juice in their Greyhounds. I could drink them all night (and have!).\\n\\nMovie Theatre: Growing up in a podunk town gives me the opportunity to be easily amazed at things out of the ordinary. Like: a movie theatre who serves beer and good greasy pizza! And going to the movies is cheap, too (mostly because the movie has been released to theaters for some time). \\n\\nDetention Room: I'm not sure how they handled the smoking rooms since the Great Smoking Ban of Oregon of 2009 (hooray I say!), but if you like smoking or cigars, they (might) have spaces for you.\\n\\nThe school also has classrooms groups can rent out (the law firm I used to work for had their annual retreat in one of the classrooms--we got breakfast and lunch, and it took every ounce of me not to order a mimosa at breakfast...).\\n\\nIf you get a chance, peruse the halls and explore the art hanging on the walls. Some of them are so odd they end up being wonderful. \\n\\nThere are also more bars within the school, and also a hotel and shop for tourists to buy their touristy McMenamins stuff.\\n\\nDefinitely a must for P-Town residents and tourists alike."},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"As the pink box says, \\"Good things come in pink boxes.\\" 4 stars because this place has got to have the most personable employees ever!

So I went to the restaurant Frank in Austin.\\n\\nThe Breakdown...\\nFood Purchased:  Jackalope (antelope, rabbit & pork sausage), Waffle Fries + Bacon Buttermilk dipping sauce, and Chocolate Chip & Bacon Cookie \\nVerdict:   The Jackalope sausage had a unique, very mild taste (need to try it for yourself) that mixed well w/ the huckleberry compote & sriracha aioli, providing a sweet and spicy party in my mouth.  However, I felt it could have been juicier & have more condiments.  The waffle fries were just OK, & the sauce was literally bacon bits mixed w/ buttermilk ranch.  Pathetic.

That means he hasn't a clue.\\n\\nWe started with stuffed mushrooms. Five large mushrooms were served, they were tasty, but were served on a leaf of Romaine lettuce that was wilted from the heat of the mushrooms by the time the plate made it to our table. Replace the lettuce with a sprig of rosemary or parsley and this would be a nice appetizer.\\n\\nThis was followed by a side salad and a bunch of homemade bread sticks. The sticks were oily with a texture that reminded us of under cooked pizza dough. The salads were average, the dressing (blue cheese) tasted and looked like it came out of a bottle; far too much was served on the salad.\\n\\nOur entrees were Tortellini ala Carbonara which was OK, the sauce was a bit bland, under cheesed. And veal saltimbocca which also was OK. The veal was pounded to be paper thin, didn't like it that thin as it was a bit overcooked. The sauce was as described. The side of fettuccine alfredo was awful, especially for family-run restaurant.

It was the best thing and we were the happiest vegans in the world. The crust seems impossible: buttery and soft, but with a perfectly crispy underside. It was the perfect end to our health binge.\\n\\nWe were meeting people for a crazy costumed bar crawl after our pizza, and some of those people happened to be dressed as Juggalos. When those ninjas heard that we were stopping here for dinner, they had one request: bring us some Faygo. Because that's a thing they also have here. They also sell Verner's, which is a pretty delicious Ginger Ale that seems to make everyone from Michigan pee a little from all the joy.\\n\\nThe only real downside to this place is the wait.

Although the backless seating near the open kitchen was an initial deterrent, it was new for us and we went for it. This ended up being a great idea. We saw the attentiveness given to the dishes as they were being made, were able to ask the cooks questions, get their recommendations, and we even got a sample of the house mustard and biscuits. We started dinner by sharing the beef tartare, which was great! So much so that we forgot to take a picture and wished that we'd each gotten our own. We followed by sharing the soft shell crab special, the octopus, and the duck leg. The octopus and duck leg were delicious, try them. The wine pour was generous and the Rose desert a nice finish.

It's their signature steamed bun stuffed with pork chashu, cucumber, and mixed greens served with kewpie mayonnaise.

The octopus balls were cooked to perfection and sat on a bed of egg tartar that complimented the dish nicely. It was also accompanied by a few sauces, green onions, and smoked bonito flakes.\\n\\nFor our main course, we both ordered a bowl of ramen.

You just have to try it for yourself! \\n\\nHere's what we got:\\n\\n*Sprouting Up Ramen ($12.95)--This ramen comes with a pork & chicken broth and thick noodles. The addition of crispy brussel sprouts was unique, but worked quite well.

We got to stop in for lunch and each opted for the 1/4 chicken plate with plantains and yuca fries, my husband going for dark meat and I chose the white meat.  The meat was really delicious, juicy and spiced nicely.  The yuca fries were hot, crispy and tasty;  I watched the woman from the kitchen bring out a fresh batch, take the cold ones off my plate that the serving girl had plopped down and replace them with the choicest morsels she'd just made.  Yay!  The plantains had a pleasant banana sweetness, and the sides were surprisingly filling.  I opted for the chocolate chipotle torte for dessert, and was hoping for just a little more heat.  I guess \\"slight tingle\\" is all you can really hope for in a fast-food-for-the-masses atmosphere.  Next time I will try the Inka's Delight, which is a plantain sundae with caramel, from what I understand.  I am excited for next time!

If I were to come back, I probably wouldn't order the same dishes again.\\n\\nWe had:\\nDrinks:\\n- Calvin's Lychee Martini $10: Like the name states, one of their signature cocktails. The lychee and grapefruit liqueur is sweet, lychees are plump, and will hit you before you realize. \\n\\nFood:\\n- Lobster Wontons $12: You get 3 with your order. We had to add an extra one so each person could have one. Interesting combination of flavors here. Lobster and cream cheese packed inside crispy fried wonton skin. The real flavor comes from the mango glaze and truffle balsamic. These were good and opened up our appetite.\\n- Grilled New Zealand Lamb Chops $29: Lamb chops with thai curry sauce. Came with kale, asparagus tips, and a scoop of mash. My partner loves curry anything. Flavors were a bit muted. I think it would've been better with heavier emphasis on the curry. Decent, but not memorable.\\n- Duck Dynasty $28: Didn't get to try this one so no comment.\\n- Seafood Melange $29: Diver scallop, Tiger shrimp, Squid Ink Pasta, creamy artichoke blanco. I was so excited for this dish because it was an assortment of everything I love in a bowl. This was the most disappointing of them all. It was overly sweet, and my dish was swimming in so much sauce that it seemed like noodle soup. Squid Ink Pasta was overcooked and soft, not even near al dente.

Their selection of sauces can appeal most (I can't speak for everyone). The service is also something I cannot forget to mention.

The sandwich was fine but the pizza - half Manray and half Biotech - was really disappointing. The toppings were adequate but the crust was like saltine crackers.

I was very tempted by the El Diablo tequila cocktail but with such an interesting wines-by-the-glass list, we opted for a glass of the gruner veltliner and one of their French whites based on the recommendation of our server who was more than helpful. While both were very good, the gruner was excellent!\\n\\nSpeaking of helpful, our server asked if we had questions about the menu, we did and were given thoughtful explanations and suggestions. We were torn between the Tilefish crudo and the lamb and green harissa from their crudo menu but opted for the Tilefish and the Fava and English Pea dishes. Both were excellent and to our surprise, the server who had made the recommendations brought out the harissa lamb 'with our compliments - I just wanted you to try it' and it too was fabulous.\\n\\nGoing for a complete sharing, tapas like experience, we shared everything and opted instead of entrees to go for a few appetizers, including the asparagus a la plancha and the carrot and spicy chicken sugo.\\n\\nAs I've already said, the level of flavors across the board was exceptional but the carrot and spicy chicken sugo was at yet another level of exceptional. The dish is like a Bolognese or ragu of spiced (not spicy) chicken, with the crescent shaped pasta filled with carrot puree.  I can't explain adequately how complex and great this dish was so I highly suggest you go, sit at the crudo bar and get it yourself.\\n\\nThe only near-miss for us was the pierogies, while served perfectly browned and plated, for us, we would have loved a sauce more than the smear of sunchoke puree (which was good but not saucy).\\n\\nWe were pretty full but the dessert menu looked so equally interesting that we had to try something...but what?  For us the decisions were between the candy Cap ice-cream with toasted oats or the hibiscus dessert.\\n\\nOur server explained that a candy cap is a type of mushroom that tastes of maple syrup and we said the hibiscus dessert was recommended by our daughter who has been recently but we typically don't enjoy hibiscus because of a soapy flavor we've detected in the prior experiences so...we opted for the candy cap, mushroom ice-cream. It was fabulous!!! \\n\\nAgain, much to our surprise, \\"Meredith\\" the general manager who was doing all the expediting from the kitchen, brought us the hibiscus dessert 'from us, we just want you to try what hibiscus can be'. I have no idea at this point which was 'better' because both were outstanding, as was the entire evening.\\n\\nWas our experience unique or exceptional at Townsman? Well it was certainly exceptional to us!\\nA clear top 5 Boston restaurant on our list!\\n\\nPS. If you are wondering who the others on our top 5 are...ASTA (tasting menu phenomenon), Alden & Harlow (quality and experience similar to Townsman - another must visit), O Ya (sushi and flavors like no other) and our sentimental, date-night old favorite - Clio (still good after all these years). It's tough to come up with a top 5 with Ten Tables Cambridge, Deuxave and so, so many others deserving a solid nod but last night, Townsman was king!"},{"name":"El Potro","address":"981 S Orange Blossom Trl","city":"Apopka","stars":"4","text":"Love going here for the Buffet and the Mariachi!!! you cannot go wrong by eating here!!!"},{"name":"Equinox Restaurant and Bar","address":"830 N Shaver St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"The service was wonderful but the food was not that great.

It was one long ribbon of pasta and a nice few tablespoons of ragu meat.  While it was good, it was a teaser, it was not a dinner portion of pasta.  Obviously these folks have not been to Jersey or NYC.  \\nThere was no bread service with dinner :(  \\nOur server/ bartender did acknowledge that the dinner was taking a while and presented us with an appetizer of the lebnah while we were waiting. \\nAfter we had finished our entree, I did tell the bartender/ server that the portion size was not good!

Bone marrow, chicken livers, octopus and duck seem to be ubiquitous.  Personally I don't get it.\\n\\nObviously, I'm in the minority - if people didn't order it, they wouldn't serve it.  It just doesn't match my culinary sensibilities.  There wasn't a whole lot on the menu that appealed to me.\\n\\nBack to K&D.  I had the scallops.  THREE of them about the size of half dollars with a little endive for $27.  Unacceptable.  Basic scallops, nothing special.  \\n\\nMy wife had the burger which was... well an average burger for $16.

I took one bite of 2 of the donuts and couldn't go on. The most sugary awful things i've ever had.

Nan bread was fresh, soft and piping hot.  Veg samosas were excellent, as were all the chutneys. The service by the husband and wife managers was cheerful, welcoming and attentive.  The place was totally renovated and is big, airy and modern.  Like the restaurant, the bathrooms were spotless (I see a dirty restaurant bathroom and assume the kitchen is similar).

He said it had the best veggie burger he's tried. I was skeptical particularly because I don't like ordering veggie burgers at restaurants because they're usually half-assed and nothing special. Still, I was curious, so we went. We got the hummus plate and the veggie burger with Asian cole slaw. Now let me preface this by saying that my girlfriend is a bit of a hummus connoisseur. She was spoiled by Hummus World in Long Island which she's been unable to match anywhere in Austin. She's been to just about every recommended place for hummus in town, and she says this is the best one she's had in Austin. Not Hummus World quality, but the best in Austin (I still don't think she'll ever find anything as good as Hummus World). So that's a glowing endorsement.\\n\\nBack to the veggie burger (Veggie Royale) though: I had it with the chipotle-pecan pesto, and it was AMAZING. So good. The pesto was absolutely delicious, but I want to say even without that, it was a very solid veggie burger. You can tell that they put some effort into it. Definitely not your run-of-the-mill veggie burger. The Asian cole slaw was interesting, but I can't say that it was great. Not bad, though.

They are obviously a direct competitor with Buffalo Wild Wings, and they are putting up a good fight.  This place was really good!\\n\\nInside it does look like your typical wing joint. The atmosphere is pretty cool - very casual yet nice, with a big bar and plenty of seating.  There were lots of TVs all over the place so it would be a great place to go to watch a sporting event.\\n\\nOur hostess and server were both very polite and we were promptly taken care of.  I should also mention that our server was quick to make sure that our drinks never reached the bottom of the glass.  \\n\\nThe menu offered a lot to choose from aside from just wings.  There were burgers, salads, etc., and the prices seemed to be quite appropriate.  We ordered an appetizer - the sloppy fries, I believe. These fries were covered in chili and cheese and I think some sort of gravy. It was my boyfriend's choice.  It wasn't really my thing, but they were pretty good. They were curly fries, too, which I liked.  \\n\\nOur wings were brought out almost right after the fries.  I should talk about the wings a bit - here's where they differ from any other typical wing place: You choose your flavor of sauce, and then you choose the level of hotness of the sauce.  So you can get spicy garlic parmesan if you want, and we did.  That's kind of nice, because I love garlic parmesan wings, but they are never spicy at all.  The wings turned out to be a little less spicy than I'd hoped, but I think we chose Hot, which is right in the middle of their hotness scale.  If you go there and look at the menu or view it online, it will make more sense.  The menu makes it easy to understand.  \\n\\nI think we ran into a problem as far as getting multiple flavors. We ordered one big serving to split and they wouldn't let us get as many flavors as they wanted. Maybe we had to buy a bigger number of wings - we didn't get too much because the french fry thing was HUGE.  BTW, we had enough leftovers for quite a snack later on. But I was a little disappointed that we couldn't mix it up too much.\\n\\nThe wings themselves were good, really meaty.  They tasted a little more crispy and fried than I prefer, but they were still high-quality wings and I would definitely get them again.  I should mention that we got regular wings with the bones.  I haven't tried their boneless, but they do offer them.\\n\\nThe service was really great for a wings place and they excel BW3's in this area by far.  Whenever I dine at BW3's, our server seems to disappear for long periods of time.  But here, our server checked on us several times, and we were inclined to tip her very well.\\n\\nAll in all a great wing experience. I recommend checking it out over BW3's sometime. I think that they are courageous for going up against such a solid competitor, but they're doing a good job.  The location wasn't the best, kind of out in the middle of nowhere, but I think these places are starting to pop up everywhere.

Because this place has changed about 15 times since it's opened. I've probably witnessed 10 of them. I liked this place when it first opened and then never again. It just kept getting worse every time. Yesterday I came in because my boss wanted to try it. Turns out they once again just changed everything. I was extremely apprehensive based on the terrible food and service of the last 10 reincarnations. I ordered a turkey BLT. Guess what? It was good. Not great but good. Service was great! They also have a frequent flier program now where if you get the free card you'll get 25% off of every lunch and every 7th lunch is free. Things are looking up. I'll be back.

When this place was the Bo Kong, it was always cold, even in the summer; now it's just the right temp.  Some of the staff are the same and some are new.\\n\\nInitially the new serving staff did strange things like reaching over rather than going around a person but that seems to have stopped.  We have not had any problems with getting orders wrong, and they always honour my request of soft rather than deep-fried tofu without any problem.  The bill comes printed in both English and Chinese which is a nice improvement (before just came written in Chinese).\\n\\nThere's a huge selection of dishes.  Some of the favourites are the pepper \\"steak\\", sweet and sour delight (mostly sweet, with pineapple and peppers), spicy green beans, and bean curd skin rolls with black bean sauce.  Wonton soup and thick spinach soups are good, and I also like the eggplant and tofu made with soft tofu.  \\"Chicken drumsticks\\" are fun but you can buy these frozen from the Whole Veg. stores so we don't order them in the restaurant.\\n\\nService is very fast and, after a couple of times, the new serving staff recognized us.  The staff are friendly but don't expect them to fawn over you -- the service is efficient, not overly attentive which is fine.\\n\\nAs this is a Buddhist Chinese restaurant, there is no onion or garlic but, despite this, the flavours are fresh and very tasty.\\n\\nThere's free parking beside the restaurant, monitored by video camera.\\n\\nIf we think it will be busy (eg Mother's day) we'll make a reservation but it's usually not necessary for smaller groups.\\n\\nThe name comes from the fact that the new owners are the Whole Vegetarian chain of stores, with several stores in the Lower Mainland.  After eating here one day, we checked out the closest one and bought quite a few dry goods and freezer items.  Certainly worth a visit if you're vegetarian and have freezer space.  \\n\\nThis is one of our favourite places to eat and we visit at least once a month, ordering too much deliberately and taking it home.  At this point, they're used to the fact that we take our own containers, anticipating this.  Definitely worth checking out even if you're not vegetarian due to the large selection."},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Creative genius culminating in sugary sweet perfection!

We sat at the bar where the ceiling vents blew extremely cold air on me. They allowed us to move to other seats at the bar, but there was still a cold draft. The food here really is great. We did three courses for $45. All the food was fresh and delicious. The decor here was a bit of a surprise to me. If I'm going to drop one-fiddy on dinner and drinks, I expect everything to be top-notch from the food, to the service, to the ambiance.

This is the original location near Chinatown and is just so much better than the Davis street location.

The chewiness of the donut was slightly different and there was more greasiness to the Davis donut.  \\n\\nAfter single-handedly eating over 3 dozen donuts from the original location and about 6 from the Davis location, I think I have a pretty good idea that the original is worth the wait.  I may give the new location another try to see if they were just a bit off that time.  \\n\\nOreo donut, maple bacon and old dirty bastard donuts are still my favorites.  The crunch of the oreo in addition to the chewiness of the dough is the perfect combination.  (Another reason the Davis street location let me down is that the oreos had NO crunch :( and the bacon was no as crunchy either.)  The cake donuts are pretty darn delicious as well and have a fluffier texture than most.

The goat cheese stuffed chicken was amazing, as was the gorgonzola cheescake.  The vegetable risotto was kind of bland.  The caesar salad was simple and average.

I don't know what people who return time and time again to brave the line and tight spacing are smoking.

I was very excited when I heard about Midtown opening up but that excitement was quickly tempered when I heard that the owners were the same people who operated the previous restaurant in this space, Village Fish.  Village Fish was great when it was in Brookline.  For some reason, when it moved to Needham it went way downhill.  The food became bland and the service was horrible.  So, I went into Midtown expecting more of the same.\\n\\nI've now eaten lunch there twice and considered a takeout dinner once.  The first time was takeout at lunch time and I ordered a brisket sandwich and a cobb salad for my co-worker.  I arrived at Midtown to pick up the food and waited at least 10 minutes past the estimated pick up time for my food.  The brisket was OK flavor-wise but there wasn't enough sauce on the sandwich for my taste and no one thought to put extra sauce in the bag (or even ask if I wanted any).  The meat itself was chopped up into pieces instead of sliced and it was definitely on the dry side as well hence my desire for more sauce.  In my opinion, REALLY REALLY good BBQ doesn't even need sauce.  The bun was very soft and fluffy and quite enjoyable though.  Also, I asked for sweet potato fries and found regular french fries in the box when I opened it up.  The feedback I received on the salad from my co-worker was: meh.  She said the bacon in the salad was VERY fatty and picked it out.\\n\\nThe other night I called to place a takeout order for dinner.  The lady who picked up asked me to call back in ten minutes . . . NO WAY!  If you don't want my business, I'll call someone else who does.\\n\\nMy next lunch visit to Midtown I ate in the restaurant.  The decor is sparse with some \\"western\\" items tacked up on the wall and a faux fireplace near the entrance.  At the time we walked in, there were only a few occupied tables.  So, we were seated quickly and the waitress was very attentive.  I ordered a pulled pork sandwich and the wife ordered a pulled chicken sandwich.  The same soft bun again but this time filled with nearly flavorless pulled pork.  I tried their \\"sweet sauce\\" to add some flavor .  . . AWFUL.  It tasted like watered down ketchup.  The \\"spicey\\" sauce was decent but the consitency was very thin and the name is a total misnomer as it was not spicey at all.  The word on the pulled chicken was that it was \\"good.\\"  I also finally managed to get my hands on their sweet potato fries and they were good as well.  Plus, when we sat down the waitress brought us a couple pieces of cornbread.  The cornbread was pretty good.  It was very moist, but maybe a little too sweet.\\n\\nOverall, I thought Midtown was OK.  The food is fare but with few other BBQ restaurants so conviently located near me I can see going back to satisfy a BBQ craving.  When I want great BBQ though I'll get in the car and head someplace further away."},{"name":"Mary Mac's Tea Room","address":"224 Ponce De Leon Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I take everyone and anyone I know here.

My favorites are definitely the shrimp scampi and the buffalo chicken pizza.\\n\\nTheir pasta is very, very tasty. My favorite is the Chicken Broccoli Alfredo, but all of the pasta I've tried there has been amazing. The pasta is very filling! Their portions are huge.

At one time, long before I lived there, the city had a number of coffeehouses like the old Bouldin Creek: funky, eclectic, full of an odd mix of characters. (Note: none of them were anything like the Central Perk coffeehouse seen on \\"Friends,\\" the product of a Hollywood writer's imagination.) Then gentrification and escalating rents -- along with the influx of Starbucks -- forced many of them to start selling food, switching to a table-service model, and generally morphing into places where you felt weird, like you were stiffing the waiter or something, if you just wanted to go in and have a latte or two while you read or worked on your laptop.\\n\\nSadly, the new Bouldin Creek feels like NYC Coffeehouse, 2.0 Version. The whole table service concept is convoluted to begin with, as evidenced by the continual confusion of new customers unsure where to sit (either at the bar, or wait at a host stand restaurant-style to be assigned a table), and while I very much appreciate the adaptive reuse of an old tire store, the layout forced by the adaption has led to some piss-poor interior design decisions (e.g. the ramp near the entrance, obviously necessitated by a need to comply with disabilities regulations but one now surrounded by warning flags, presumably indicating that people have been constantly tripping over it). The expanded menu is fine but a little on the pricey side, particularly for breakfast items (about 40% more than the fare at La Reyna a mere 50 feet away), though it's certainly vegan-friendly even by South Austin standards.\\n\\nNot sure I'm getting the complaints about parking - the old coffeehouse had, what, four spots? The new one, with 20-25 spots, is a considerable improvement, and if it's full you can just park on the street like you used to at the old place.\\n\\nI know the Bouldin neighborhood and S. 1st in general are rapidly becoming \\"the new SoCo\\" (do note that I DETEST that acronym, nearly as much as the \\"SoFi\\" one I've heard a few realtor types dare to use about the S. 1st vicinity); I'm just sad to see its quirkiness slowly die away. Btw you know those NYC coffeehouses I mentioned? Without exception, they're all shuttered. Today you can get coffee at Starbucks, Dunkin Donuts, indie coffee bars (generally with limited or no seating), or establishments with a full restaurant-style menu -- like the new and \\"improved\\" Bouldin Creek Coffeehouse ... er, \\"Cafe.\\""},{"name":"The Paramount","address":"44 Charles St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I've gone here for lunch during weekdays a few times and the food is DELICIOUS!!!\\n\\nThis is a favorite spot for me and my colleagues and they also rave about how tasty the food is.

They don't have the strong beef flavor that is so characteristic of the hot dogs from Yeah Burger or Grindhouse; it probably means that there is a fair share of questionable ingredient(s), but it just wouldn't be a hot dog without some  enigmatic allure surrounding its ingredients, right? The other memorable aspect about this place is the variety of toppings that are included in the price of your meal. The only downside to the menu is that the selection of sides is limited; you have your choice of regular or cajun fries, both of which are flavorful and served in generous portions that are more than enough to share between two, perhaps even three, reasonably sized individuals.\\n\\nService: Service was friendly and quick. The only issue I have with the ordering process is that you pay at the counter and then pick-up your order once it's called. This originally didn't seem problematic to me, until I realized that the calling process was achieved through a microphone that was utilized several times per minute. Needless to say, don't expect to have any in-depth conversations while dining here.\\n\\nAtmosphere: With respect to atmosphere, Five Guys is a typical fast food chain. The dining area is very institutional and you can guarantee that your seat will be within an arms throw (or smell) of a garbage can. Although I'm sure many will disagree, the one thing I do appreciate about Five Guys is that the kitchen area is completely visible from the dining area; when eating fast food, I'm a huge fan of being able to see both the equipment and individuals preparing anything that's about to enter my mouth.\\n\\nCost: Inexpensive. A hamburger or hot dog with unlimited toppings, regular fries, and a drink will cost approximately $10. \\n\\nOther: I was later told that this is a trademark of Five Guys, but they dump an extra handful of fries into your bag after putting the hot dog/hamburger and cup of fries inside. Some may see this as an added plus, but it takes practice to remove the items from the bag without either burning your fingers or dumping grease/salt filled fries on yourself."},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Voodoo is a place that has so much hype in portland.

I was very excited when I saw the vegetarian burger, but that was where my excitement ended. After what seemed like forever, we got our food. As soon as I looked at my burger, I knew this wasn't going to be fun. It was already falling apart and I hadn't even touched it. I decided to just go for it, picked it up, and it literally disintegrated in my hands. It fell into my salad dressing, into my lap, and all over the table. I seriously looked like a drunk toddler who didn't know how to eat (for the record, I was neither drunk at that current moment, or a child).\\n\\nAfter dealing with the merciless teasing of my friends for being messy, I realized I was going to have to think outside the box if I wanted to eat it. Failure was not an option, as I was really hungry and refused to wait another 20-25 minutes for another meal to come out. Being the resourceful creature I am, I decided to ditch the buns (which were way too big, in my opinion) and scrape everything onto my plate. I then used a fork to eat what was left of my \\"burger\\"- this in itself was annoying. The best part about a burger is eating it with your hands. I was having to be civilized and use utensils. This all could have been forgiven if it was a great veggie burger...unfortunately, it was not. It wasn't terrible. It was just bland. I've had probably 50 different veggie burgers from restaurants in the MA/ NH area, and this one was definitely at the bottom. I didn't even see any black beans in the burger- it was mainly rice. I didn't pay $10.99 for a rice burger. \\n\\nThis whole ordeal was pretty upsetting because I had been mentally pumped for a good veggie burger. I ordered the seasonal strawberry basil margarita, because quite frankly, I earned it. That drink was really good. It came in a cute mason jar too, so that was pretty adorable. My husband ordered the blue burger, and he seemed to be pleased with it. I might give this place another try- I haven't decided yet. I would definitely order a drink first so I have something to get me through the meal if it was bad again. \\n\\nOur server was Celia. She was nice, knew the menu, and did a good job. She did seem to be a little over booked with the tables though- there was a large party in the back that she was working too so it took some patience for her to get to us when we needed something.

Please,  setting up another line for pick up would be so much more efficient.  after waiting another 15 mins in line, turns out they had a gluten free Herbivore waiting for me... not vegan.

The manager ordered for us 5 courses and many of them are shared, so you have a plate per two people.  I was stuffed by the 3rd course.

I was extremely surprised because I expected to pay more for the service and wonderful meal that we ate.  I highly recommend coming here again.

We were seated right by the host station which was fine at first but not long after ordering a large rush of people came in and needed to wait for tables. The waiting area spilled into the dining area and some kids ended up sitting at our table next to us, other people put their waters and coffee on our table while standing around it chatting, acting as if it was an extension of the bar, and our waitress couldn't even easily make it to our table anymore.

I am not quite sure why I have never written a review after all these years of eating there.  \\n\\nFour years ago, I lost a bet in a cook-off and had to treat my friend to a professional massage.  After going the spa, we were famished and he had been craving Peruvian food.  We didn't have a reservation so they sat us downstairs and it happened to be happy hour.  To start off, I had a Pisco Sour to drink then we ordered a few items off the tapas menu to share--the beef empanadas, marinated chicken kebobs, grilled octopus kebobs, yucca croquettes stuffed with mozzerella and cotija cheese.  \\n\\nThe food!  Ohh, I loved that they have three different types of dipping sauces (coconut, peanut, and verde) for the complimentary basket of breads.  I have never been a fan of yucca or, what Asians like to call, cassava.  Its very starchy and poor in protein/nutrients yet something about the way Central/South Americans prepare yucca makes it so tasty and the yucca croquettes made me want more of it.  My friend does not care for seafood, but I got him eating tentacles off a skewer and liking it. The empanadas and chicken kebobs were delectable.  It was the more unique items that stood out.\\n\\nLast time I was at Andina was a month ago with another friend, he was in town and has been wanting to try the restaurant for quite some time.  Normally, I am good about making reservations but this was spur of the moment.  We were seated downstairs which is fine but it's in an awkward spot--wedged in between a wall and staircase.  We came for the food, but it was distracting with people constantly coming down the stairs above our heads and a high traffic path in front of our table that cut us off from the rest of the area.  At least, it was easy to get a servers' attention.\\n\\nWe shared a Cebiche, Mango Verde y Langostinos which had prawns and green mango in a creamy passion-fruit sauce.  It was good but too sour for my preference.  I had the Seco a la Nortena, a slow-cooked lamb shank, and my friend opted for the Arroz con Pato, a duck served two ways (duck confit and pan-seared).  Both were incredibly succulent!!! The lamb was fork-tender and melted off the bone.  The duck was seared perfectly, crispy skin and moist meat, but the confit was a little dry.  We were stuffed after dinner, we almost passed on dessert and couldn't because everything sounded so enticing.  I had the fried ice cream toppped with figs and a goat cheese chantilly.  I love the combination of cheese and sweets, but the breading of quinoa and peanut around the ice cream made it so heavy.  I wanted to trade my friend, he chose the cannolis stuffed with passion-fruit mousse served with mango-lemongrass sorbet and mango sauce.  That was light and refreshing.  \\n\\nExcellent service!  It gets very busy so make sure you get reservations so you don't get stuck in a weird table, tucked away from everyone.  To this day, I have yet to find a place that makes a better Pisco Sour.

Pretty nice price point for a good glass of wine.\\n\\nNow to the important part: the noms. \\n\\nWe pretty much ordered the menu. We had the house bread with olive oil, which was served warm and had a nice taste to it, the meatballs, the cauliflower with mint, which was one of my favorite dishes in a while. Wow! The mint really made it pop, the aioli sauce was perfect with it. We also ordered the deep fried mozzarella cheese/risotto sticks with a spicy marinara sauce. These were pretty much an adult version of my childhood favorite mozzarella sticks. The inside was gooey and oh-so-cheesy, the outside was crispy and salty, which was the perfect balance. The little bit of spice in the marinara cut through the fat from the cheese and really rounded out the dish. \\n\\nFor mains, we shared the duck ragu and the ricotta and butternut squash ravioli. The ragu was absolutely perfect, and I would order that for dinner hands down every time. The duck was so tasty, the pasta was perfectly al dente and the sauce was rich and just the right amount of salt. It was a great combination. I'm still drooling over it. The ricotta ravioli were great too, but compared to the ragu, it was a little forgettable. The ravioli were light and full of fluffy cheese, and the sauce was nice. I would recommend it for any veggie friends out there for sure. \\n\\nSkipped the desserts, but can't wait to come back."},{"name":"Ganko Ittetsu Ramen","address":"318 Harvard St, Unit 3","city":"Brookline","stars":"4","text":"Nestled in the Coolidge arcade is something I have never experienced before.

I held a grudge against Cafe 47 for a very long time. Why? Well, I was grieving the loss of my go-to pizza place (Despina's) that it replaced and I think I got stuck in the anger phase of grief for a longer period of time than was reasonable. But I've put all that behind me now.\\n\\nWhere Despina's was dingy and old, Cafe 47 is polished and new. The newly re-designed space looks great and even pays homage to its history by integrating pieces of the old Despina's street sign into the front desk and (more importantly) are still employing one of Despina's pizza chefs who makes pizza just like they always have. Wise move!\\n\\nThere's a bar area that serves beer and wine now and the seating area which was previously a sea of aging red vinyl has been replaced by rich mahogany and leather-like seating surfaces that would make Ron Burgundy proud. The exposed brick walls and mirrored cornices are also nice to look at. The only change I'd make is a practical one: add a breezeway on the front door to keep icy winter drafts away from the patrons eating close to the front, please.\\n\\nThe new owners have moved the entire menu upmarket and increased prices but not too much so. They've also expanded into weekend brunches which is a welcome addition to the neighborhood.\\n\\nGenerally speaking the food is very respectable here and it seems like the menu is appropriately sized - almost as if they're trying to focus on what they know they can do really well instead of having a giant menu and doing nothing well. Bonus points for that. A few examples of what they do well are things like the salads, the angus and tuna burgers, steak sandwiches, sweet potato fries, and of course, the legendary pizza.\\n\\nThere's some room for improvement in the service area. As it stands now, it's pretty hit or miss - some of the staff is spectacular while others seem inexperienced. This is especially evident when it gets busy on weekends and during brunch. I realize it takes time to find, train, and refine a restaurant staff so I'm hoping this aspect will get better with time.\\n\\nNow that I'm in the acceptance stage of the grieving process I can finally enjoy Cafe 47 for what it is now instead of what it was in days past - and what it is now is pretty damn good!"},{"name":"Panahar - Bangladeshi Place","address":"3375 Buford Hwy NE, Ste 1060","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Let me start by saying that I have been going to Panahar for a very long time.

Our first trip back was around 5:00 and happy hour was just getting under way. We were one of two tables in the place. The service was friendly and efficient. The food was well prepared and inventive. One thing I'm beginning to notice in restaurants these days is a trend for using mid range ingredients prepared well. IOW, rather than offering a fillet mignon they offer a hanger steak or some other lesser cut. But they prepare it quite nicely. Equinox seems to be in that mold. The result is a menu without out any items that jump out at you. A benefit, for me anyway, is that encourages me to order something I may not otherwise. Our second trip was a prime example. For the first time I can remember I ordered a vegetarian entre! And it was very good. I had a risotto with wild mushrooms and snap peas. \\n\\nService on our second trip was decent. Friendly if not engaging. We got there just as happy hour was ending this time. Busier than the previous dinner but still not hopping. As things picked up the service got spottier. Our server told us she would bring more coffee but never did. Then our check was delayed because she mistakenly added the table next to us to our bill and had to separate it out. Minor glitches.\\n\\nOn this most recent trip we got to dine on their patio which is very nice. Over all I'd say they redeemed themselves from our initial visit.

However, don't let that fool you. The service was, as another reviewer noted, top notch. My waiter was very friendly and attentive without being overbearing at all. When a couple sitting at a table asked him to change the TV channel, he offered them the remote to select whatever they wanted to watch.\\n\\nI ordered the Pad Kee Mao and asked for no onions and a little less spice, which they were happy to accommodate.

The portion size was perfect; I'd even say it was generous for the price.

My girlfriend ordered her favorite treat, Frank's hot wings. They came out with barely any hot sauce on them. Not even an orange tinge of spice. When asked for a side of sauce, the server said yes but completely forgot until my girlfriend asked her again, and the server reached over to another table and grabbed a random bottle of Mexican Valentino, slammed it down, and walked off.

Half fries, half caesar.\\nThe beef was flavorless and dry, the bun looked thrown together without a care. And the Caesar! I've never seen a worse caesar salad. I was so sad. Almost every piece of lettuce was brown and wilted, no crisp left in it at all. \\n\\nBut the worse part was, we'd already asked for new beers and although things continually went downhill, I didn't want to be an ass and send the food back. We asked for the bill right away, and I just watched the server putter around for ages before dropping it to us. Then I got annoyed because I really hate it when you ask servers if you can customize something in your meal, and they say yes, but they don't inform you it's costs something. So I had to pay $2 extra for the nastiest soggy salad and $45 for the whole shitty experience!\\n\\nConsidering the place wasn't even busy on a Sunday night, I'm really surprised everything was so poorly prepared. But in saying all this, other times when I've eaten at The Whip, busy or not, the food was always good and the service was always up to par.

First one to try was the Bacon Maple bar. Just the maple part was incredibly sweet even with black coffee but the salty crispy bacon evened it out. My husband loves Captain Crunch cereal and he completely enjoyed the Oh Captain my Captain. For me, it's the Oreo fix in Old Dirty Bastard. Oreo's and Peanut Butter!! The glazed donut compared to Krispy Creme was a tad sweeter but I like it because it was a bit more airy and light. The hubby ate the whole crueler by himself in three bites so that must have been good. Last one to devour was the Voodoo Doll. I ate the head first and it was like eating a plain donut with chocolate glaze. Still good after sitting in a box for almost two days! I got down to the \\"bloody\\" jelly center which was a really good tasting raspberry jam.\\n\\nWe got to this location on a weekday which must have been good because we found metered parking super close. Another perk was we skipped what could have been a crazy long line. We saw rope outside the store and a sign that said not to block the door and wait outside but we walked right in and ordered within a couple of minutes. Even though we went when it was \\"slow\\" people behind the counter were still rushing around like crazy. There was stacks of donuts on racks and the place is cramped. You got interesting decor and just reading all the choices does take awhile so I guess  you can keep yourself entertained that way.\\n\\nI would really love a Dirty Old Bastard again.

The presentation was just like you would see in a magazine so much so that I was inspired to take a picture of it.  The French toast was perfectly cooked, had a crisp edge on the outside just the way I like it it was topped with walnuts served with syrup and dusted with some powdered sugar.. on the side where a few blackberries and raspberries which presented a nice touch... The hash brown potatoes where arguably the best I've ever had..  Cut in small cubes they had a medley of carrots as well as some other vegetables that perfectly balanced the flavor...

It was a thick gooey layer of sugar and was just too much for me. \\nThe apple turnover- nice and flaky, exceptionally delicious, weird after taste but really I would order this again. \\nThe incorrect chocolate petit four- turns out this was a large chocolate ganache cupcake type of dessert. I absolutely hated the peanut crusting on the outside, so I really just dove into the middle. The cake and mousse were amazing!!! So I ended up eating about half of it due to the peanut type of casing. \\nTotal price $14.46 (including the $6 item I didn't order) \\n\\nBottom line, for me- between the incorrect order, the high prices, for me, just not worth the money."},{"name":"Jae's Cafe","address":"1223 Beacon St","city":"Brookline","stars":"3.5","text":"I rarely right a bad review so first let me say the food at Jae's was good!

My new personal favorite is the Rye bagel, and their straight up rye bread is also awesome.  They keep the Portland vibe rolling with the organic natural mumbo jumbo, which only adds to this places charm, and according to my friends really makes the bagels taste better.  I know better, and realize that the difference is that this place keeps it fresh and boils their bagels the good ol' fashioned way.  The coffee is Stumptown, which I am pretty sure is the best Portland has to offer.  The atmosphere inside is great, really chill with used books lining almost every wall.  I have lots of love for Kettlemans because of their free wireless, I know every two bit cafe has it now, but this was the place I chose to bring my laptop when I was searching for a house on craigslist.

I've ordered delivery from them a couple of times now.  No complaints about the actual delivery process, other than that it'd be nice if they had an online ordering option, but given that they're newish that seems to be expected.\\n\\nI like the pizza a lot.  First thing, I noticed that someone else complained that some of the pizzas were inconsistently sized.  Thing is, that probably isn't a bad thing, because I'm sure the pies are equal by weight, and that just means it's hand shaped.  Second, the real highlight of this pizza is the crust.  It's less sweet and has a lot more chew to it than other crusts in town.  They also get some really nice char on it.  You usually don't see that from the delivery places in town.  Their sauce is much less dressed up than a lot of places.  It's noticeably more tart than most other places and much closer to the just plain crushed tomatoes used on a lot of Neapolitan pizzas.  The cheese seems to be good quality, but I might have to try an extra cheese sometime.  And the pepperoni has some nice bite to it.  Haven't tried any veggies yet, so I can't comment.\\n\\nI think these guys are leading the pack in Boulder for delivery pizza.

And it's the best pizza (non-New York style) you will find in Westerville, without question.  I mentioned besides New York style because that is my favorite type of pizza and for that no one can beat the Flying Pizza on Bethel.  This place also does fantastic wings as well.  They are a bit on the small side but you order them by the pound so you don't get cheated.  And even though the wings are a bit on the small side they are very, very meaty.  The buffalo are very very mildly spicy so no worries if you don't like hot food.\\n\\nAnother thing I love about Pasquales is that their pizza has a decent amount of cheese on it.  A lot of time when I order pizza I am not sure if I need to order extra cheese or not.  Well at this place I can tell you that unless you want a LOT of cheese you will be satisfied with the amount of cheese on their pizza.  And each pizza box comes with a $1 off a medium or $2 off a large coupon right on the box so be sure to save your box and cut out the coupon.  I've noticed though most of the time the driver doesn't even ask for the coupon.  \\n\\nMy girlfriend and I order from here at least once a month and they do deliver to us.  Call to see if they deliver to your area but they do deliver to most of the surrounding Westerville area.  Expect to wait about 45 minutes or so for your order but that's not unheard of anymore in the pizza business.\\n\\nThe only gripe I have with this place is they should open for lunch on Sunday.  I don't know how many times this past NFL season when my friends and I would have loved to have ordered some pizza and wings for the game but they do not open until 4pm on Sunday.

The bread we got was delicious, but be warned you're paying $2.00 for a SMALL amount of bread, if you want more, you pay some more. This is sort of reasonable considering alot of patrons going to high end restaurants try to get free bread to take home, but it would have been nice to START the meal with  free bread, since our total bill with tip was over $200 with three glasses of wine for 3 people.\\n\\nOnto the entrees: we decided to get the Surprise.

The Dessert Surprise was a piece of chocolate cake and a small piece of flourless chocolate cake. I thought the chocolate cake with the frosting rosettes was a packaged mix (ala Betty Crocker).

The sole purpose of my trip this time (and a couple of my stops in the fall) was to sit at the downstairs oyster bar, have a couple bivalves, and enjoy a Sam. Fortunately, the oyster bar had some open spots on a Sunday in the early afternoon so we were able to sit right down.\\n\\nThe staff at Union has always been solid, especially at the oyster bar where you are really up close and personal with the bartenders/shuckers. There are not multiple options for different types of oysters here, which I suppose is part of the charm. The presentation can best be described as sloppy-tossing the oysters onto a nondescript plate before being sent out. Not sure if it's the quality of the product or the speed at which the oyster is cleaned and shucked that usually leaves grit and/or pieces of the shell in your mouth. I know it's a hazard of eating oysters, but other places in town seem to have a better way to prevent this from happening. \\n\\nThe price for a half dozen oysters is roughly the same as other places known for oysters in town, but when you factor in selection (one type) and presentation (fairly sloppy) I think it's a little on the pricey side. \\n \\nBeer wise they have Sam Adams Boston Lager, Sam Adams Brick Red (Boston exclusive that is pretty good), and a Sam Adams Colonial Ale that can only be found at Union available. I went ahead and tossed in a third star because I knew what I was getting into before going, but really enjoy the historical aspect of Union, especially being able to sit at the oyster bar downstairs."},{"name":"Home Slice Pizza","address":"1415 S Congress St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Love this place!

You really don't have a meal option because passengers normally sleep during this flight...but then again, who wants to eat atrocious airplane food? Landing at Logan and famished, you begin searching for options. Where do you go for breakfast? Why not try The Paramount?\\n\\nLocated in Beacon Hill (an affluent area of Boston known to command a premium on goods), The Paramount offers generous portions at sensible prices.\\n\\nNotorious for attracting droves of patrons, the best time to avoid the masses undoubtedly is during early morning hours, namely within the first hour of operation. At that time, you may dine at The Paramount in total peace with the entire restaurant to yourself.\\n\\nOrdering at The Paramount is rather simple process, where the counter service method is employed. Once you've decided, ordered, and paid at the register, your meal will be brought to your table.\\n\\nFresh Squeezed Orange Juice ($3.75 Large): 5/5\\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-paramount-boston?select=1mOA_TTLUuYKBQAa-yVn2w\\nCold, refreshing, and thoroughly addicting, The Paramount's orange juice possessed a delightful natural sweetness and light pulp while lacking any sour/tart traces. Might I add that a large glass of fresh squeezed at just about any other restaurant would be priced up to a few dollars higher.\\n\\nBacon, Blue Cheese & Baby Spinach Omelette ($9.00): 4.75/5\\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-paramount-boston?select=FoXO-oTmjrdqUSc7PdAkzw\\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-paramount-boston?select=2LXiAe_vVjCkDyKQh98gAA\\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-paramount-boston?select=KB4dteJW_CrNDTON2DKV4Q\\nServed with home fries and toast. Blue cheese lovers will assuredly take pleasure in the pungent fromage that is liberally folded into this omelette. Crispier bacon would have enhanced the omelette by creating a bit of contrasting texture. I did noticed that the fresh spinach was added later in the cooking process as each leaf was not wilted. Finally, The Paramount's mouthwatering home fries were firmly tender, ideally prepared, and seasoned with precision.\\n\\nBanana Pancakes ($7.50): 5/5\\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-paramount-boston?select=wB1ruiKE2awWgb0Y2EG77A\\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-paramount-boston?select=cH4phB81qcL2_h8GMuhXJw\\nYou'll go bananas for these pancakes...seriously! This flawless triple stack of banana pancakes were mildly dense and pillowy soft. Strategically placed banana slices provided natural sweetness thanks to the caramelizing process. That being said, dousing these pancakes with syrup would be a mistake, that is unless you have a super sweet tooth!\\n\\nWhether you're a Bostonian or an out-of-owner, you gotta try The Paramount. Their accolades are well-deserved and they deserve your business, so the next time you're in the area or strolling by The Common in the morning, swing by The Paramount for a satisfying breakfast.

More of a classic approach to mussels, nothing unusual. \\n\\nMonkfish - the monkfish was excellent - well cooked and great flavor. The description on the menu did not accurately describe it - I believe it only mentioned pickled fennel and onions, but it was served over tomato sauce with olives as well. Kind of a monkfish provencal, which I liked but was much heavier than I anticipated. \\n\\nCocktails - very good and well mixed\\n\\nService - It may be a product of a new or bad waitress, but we were ignored for the first 20 minutes after being seated. The junior server/bus girl brought us bread and poured water promptly, and luckily came back 15 minutes later when she saw that our waitress had not been by yet. This is understandable if the restaurant is crowded or understaffed, or if you're with a large party, but there were 2 of us, with plenty of open seats around and no one outside our area appeared to experience these problems.

If you close at 10PM, that customer deserves the FULL experience, not feeling like they are imposing for the time that they arrived, folks mopping up their feet, chairs going up & folks looking at them like - 'can you leave'.  Keep in mind why you are in business, the customer and don't do things to make them feel unwelcomed.

Instead of bringing the soup out to him right away, he just held it out until delivering the appetizer (we waited at least 20 minutes), so he really didn't want it any longer.  \\n\\nI ordered a shrimp caesar salad.

To be more accurate I wasn't disappointed so much as pissed off. Considering I paid $37 (which included 2 things of Mac n cheese) I expected more. Wouldn't you? No, because you are smart enough to read reviews BEFORE rather than AFTER trying a place. \\n\\nSo, if you're a tourist hanging out around SOCO, likely enamored with the food truck concept, and you want a little chicken snack then by all means give it a go. It will be made to order and hot. But if you like traditional fried chicken with recognizable parts both meaty and bony, you best go elsewhere.

To me though, service is just as important as the food. Due to the 'manager' being an irrational crazy person, I will not be dining here, or at least not without a formal apology. I called last night just before 11pm. The girl answered, and asked if I would be picking up, and I said I would. \\"Ok what can I get you\\", she asks. I say that I would like a spinach calzone.. ok everything is good... I would also like a chicken parm calzone. \\"We do not have that\\", she tells me. I ask if they have a chicken parm sub. She says they do. \\"Ok, I would like everything that comes in your meat and sausage calzone, just with chicken parm instead of the other meats- Chicken parm, ricotta, mozzarella, and dipping marinara on the side.\\" Sounds delicious right? So, this girl says she cannot do it and  I ask to speak with a manager.\\n\\n I hold for a minute, somebody picks up, and says \\"Hello\\", I say, \\"Hi, I would like to ord....\\" Back on hold without a  word! Some lady then gets on the phone without introducing herself. I say,'Hi, you guys have chicken parm sub...\\" She stops me right there and snaps back- \\"WE DO NOT PUT THAT CHICKEN IN ANYTHING ELSE THEN THAT SUB....\\" \\n\\n\\"..but if you guys do a chicken par....\\" \\n\\"WE DO NOT PUT THAT CHICKEN IN ANYTHING ELSE THEN THAT SUB. AND IT IS NOW 11 O'CLOCK AND WE ARE CLOSED!\\" I then politely tell her, that I was just trying to pay her for food, and that I did not mean to offend her, and for her to have a good night. \\n\\nWhen I was a floor manager for a restaurant inside of a NYC hotel, once a guest called room service for breakfast and asked for a banana when we were out of them. The girl that answered the phone, said no we do not have that, and proceeded to politely hang up with the guest. I asked her what that was all about, and she told me that the guest wanted a banana and that we did not have any more. I immediately called the guest back and told her that the banana and anything else she wanted would be right up. I then ran, literally ran, in stuffy August weather, wearing a suit, to the store to get her a banana. Then I came back, and grabbed the rest of the new order, now full breakfast for 2, and delivered the order personally to her room, because it was too early and our room service guys were not in yet. Bottom line is, if you are in the hospitality industry, you do everything you can possibly do to make your guest happy. Happy guests pay you. Happy guests come back. Happy guests tell their friends. Happy guests write great reviews. You have pizza dough. You have chicken. Fry the chicken. Roll out the dough. Egg wash the outside rim. Place the filling on half of the the dough. Fold in half. Place in oven. It is truly that easy. Unless there is really something weird going on, like their pizzas and calzones are all pre-made or frozen. I am paying you.. or tried to pay you for food.

Their version comes in a beautiful light pork broth simmered in onions, cilantro and white pepper, topped with big peices of cauliflower and brocolli and wontons  The salad rolls can be a hit or miss.  Sometimes the peanut sauce is too runny so its hard to soak the the salad roll in the peanut dip.  Price wise - dinner for 1 under $10 is pretty good and you'll be in and out in 30 minutes. This place takes credit card and debit as well, which is a rarity for good pho restaurants.  The spring rolls are crunchy and sinful.  Deep fried and sometimes I wrap my napkin around them and am surprised how much oil comes out.  The vermicell bowl  comes with crunchy pickled carrots, daikon and fresh cucumber, with a dollop of crushed peanuts, topped with lemongrass chicken (not skin-less/thigh meat) and one spring roll.  It comes with a small bowl of fish sauce vinegarette and you dump it in your noodle salad bowl and the flavours marry and you have one tasty meal. I often order the vermicelli rice bowl when I want a hearty meal with lots of fresh veggies.  For $1.50 you can order a side of broth and you can sip it as you eat the rice bowl.

Some of the dishes fell short, though, like the herb-crusted cod, which was quite bland. The two desserts we shared, the lemon semifreddo and banoffee pie, were both amazing. However, the one thing that just made the whole night seem \\"off\\" was that our server never introduced himself to our table.

In addition, a Russian style banquet means you walk in, there are endless cold appetizers and alcohol already on the table.  While you stuff yourself with that, they bring out endless hot appetizers, followed by the potato course, and then the main course (which usually involves several types of meat).  Intermittently, you dance.  You go home stuffed and drunk, and wake up disgusted the next day.  The flipside is it's superfun to eat, drink, and dance all in the same place.\\n\\nBUT: I really really liked this place.  It's tiny, and they don't have a cheesy band, so subtract the dancing from the banquet.  We had 40 people at my mom's birthday banquet, and that closed out the restaurant. The food was excellent!  I wouldn't say it typical Russian restaurant food, because I doubt in communist St. Petersburg they had ever heard of eel, seared tuna or avocado, but if they had, this is how they would serve it.  In addition to creative items, you also have all the basics, like blintzes with caviar, and mushroom julienne.  The main courses were very well made too, and included classics (Karsky lamb) and originals (who's ever heard of duck?).\\n\\nService was impeccable, like a royal dinner: dishes appear and disappear, and never at want of water, alcohol, or a clean plate.  It's not cheap, but it's great!  \\n\\nEDIT, 10/14/07: you don't have to have a banquet, you can also order a la carte.  I brought a bunch of non-Russians here, and although at first, people were curious but reticent to try the borscht (it's pink!), and the potato dumplings (sour cream? really?), and blintzes with caviar (crepes with fish eggs?), in the end everyone was very satisfied.  The tea and cherry jam was a huge success, especially.  For 8 people: 1 carafe vodka, 3 apps, entrees for all, tea for all and 3 desserts: $350 including tip.

I really did. I get what she is trying to do. I like local. I like seasonal. However, it seemed like the name of the game here is presenting what is in reality average home cooking as what folks in Columbus, Ohio *think* high end cuisine is supposed to be.\\n\\nTo start we ordered the Old School Beef vegetable soup and curry brussels sprouts with cashews. Of everything, the brussels sprouts were the stand out. They were slightly crispy and caramelized on the outside with a good salty sweet flavor that mixed well with the cashews and madras cream curry sauce. I was excited as if everything was to this level, this place is going to be great.\\n\\nFrom here, things went down hill. The beef vegetable soup was neither particularly beefy nor vegetably. The beef seemed to be left over roast and there were more beans and lentils than vegetables. Not that this was bad, but it was on par with what my mom would make in a hurry out of left overs. Hearty, but bland and generally unexciting. \\n\\nNext came the main courses. I ordered the pasta apropo with a portabello. The mushroom was pretty good. It seemed to be saut√©ed with balsamic and salt. Again, good, but nothing extraordinary that you wouldn't make on the average night when in a hurry. The pasta was a germelli like noodle with a ch√®vre and bell pepper sauce. Again, the dish was not well integrated. The ch√®vre was a harsh and gamey contrast to what was bland pasta and mushy, flavorless bell peppers. Not fantastic, not terrible; average weeknight home cooking that I could really do without.\\n\\nThe \\"surprise\\" was a veal shank with risotto. The veal shank, again, was terribly bland (do we see a pattern yet?). Additionally, I expect a veal, lamb, goat, whatever shank to essentially fall apart. This was a dry affair on the outside with what seemed to be some fat on the inside that could have rescued the poor thing had it not gone under the broiler or whatever abused its poor outside to be so dry. There was a red wine reduction attempt which was pretty acidic. The risotto was mealy and not creamy... essentially what risotto turns out like when someone is in a hurry or doesn't know what they are doing. There were onions in the risotto/wine reduction and they were clear and boiled. You would expect them to be simmered or reduced somehow. Nope, plain old boiled onions. Again, the risotto was done too quickly and the onions were tossed in as an after thought.\\n\\nMaybe I am being overly difficult here. However, with the pretension this place carries, supposed high reviews, and high prices, I expect much more. Again, the food is what I think people like to think high end food is that really don't know any better. I would have much rather been across the street at Indian Kitchen or Blue Nile considering the price and food quality. If you want to spend some bucks on a meal, get to Deep Woods, the Refectory or the Worthington Inn (or better yet, Montreal, but that's a hell of a drive). Alana's is really nothing special but a place to spend a lot of money and get little in return. I went 2 stars as it says \\"Meh, I've experienced better\\" and I certainly have. Perhaps I would bump it to 3 stars as the wait staff were generally fantastic, but that doesn't salvage very mediocre food at a place that SHOULD be a foodie's dream."},{"name":"Grass Fed","address":"605 Centre St","city":"Jamaica Plain","stars":"3","text":"Let me be clear - I love hamburgers and eat them at every chance I get.\\n\\nEveryone had high hopes for Grass Fed, and you'd think a place owned by the same person as Ten Tables would really bring their A-game to a casual, locally-sourced neighborhood burger joint. But you'd be wrong.  Krista Kranyak - what happened?!\\n\\nI went to Grass Fed last night (for the 5th and final time). I even called ahead because there's always been a line and then a wait for food. But alas, it did me no good. I still had to wait 15 minutes for my to-go order.\\n\\nThe Pros:\\n- the counter-person was very apologetic about the wait and gave me free beet fries and a seltzer\\n\\nThe Cons:\\n- the burger patty -- what has happened to them? It was smaller, dryer and more flavorless than any previous encounter. \\n- i specifically stated no cheese and yet there was cheese on the burger\\n- i ordered it \\"in the grass\\" thinking it came on top of a salad. apparently \\"in the grass\\" means it will be sitting on a few wilted mesclun greens.\\n- it didn't seem like anyone working there knew what was going on; a clear lack of management.\\n\\nConsidering that Grass Fed is literally RIGHT next door to Ten Tables, you'd think there would be some quality control and oversight. But again, you'd be wrong. I so badly wish Grass Fed was good, but I'm officially done going there. If you want a great burger in JP I still recommend the Haven, followed by Canary Square."},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Got a variety of donuts from orginal to Oreo topping.

I made a mental note to one day go back and stay there.\\n\\n10 years later I got married! and stopped off there for 2 nights on a honeymoon roadtrip. We got in late from the Oregon Coast and were pretty road weary. After dinner we settled in totally beat, put our heads on the pillow and then the power went out! 5 Seconds later a generator started that was as loud as street cleaner underneath our window! I looked outside and the generator wasn't located in a basement away from the guests, but 30 feet from our window. Looking at the map of rooms our room (the bird room) was the closest to the generator.\\n\\nI went to the desk and the weirdest thing happened. The maintenance/security guy I spoke to just repeated over and over the same phrase: \\"Sorry for your Inconvenience\\" at the end of everything I had to say. And that was it. Seriously, nothing else except that one phrase. No other reply or engagement whatsoever to anything I had to say. Can we switch to another room? Sorry for your inconvenience. Can we be discounted for paying 145 bucks for a room that has a noise level of an airplane engine coming through the window? Sorry for your inconvenience. Once was enough. This was obvious \\"quit bothering us\\" passive aggressiveness. We were tired after a long trip and wanted a solution instead of a \\"go away\\" robotic reply. I'm not certain if this person was just sick of their job, or flat out rude.\\n\\nI can understand you can't control the power going out. You can however control where you put your generator. A basement away from your rooms is probably a good idea. If you choose to put it right next to a room, understand there are perhaps consequences when it goes off once in a blue moon, and try to be sympathetic to the noise disturbance this will create.\\n\\nWe dropped almost half a grand during our two day stay there. We should have been treated with more respect at the least, and at the bare minimum been partially compensated for a loudly interrupted evening at 2 in the morning.\\n\\nThe rest of our stay was great.

(Full disclosure: We had called them up after they opened earlier in the week to advise them of our plans. They had suggested we get there before 7 to avoid the rush, but at that point 7:30 was the best we could do as a group.)\\n\\nWhen we arrived, we were told to expect a wait of around an hour, as there was one table in play that night that could accommodate a party of our size and it already was occupied. So we went outdoors to the bar. It was chilly that evening -- in the upper 30s -- but they had some futuristic infrared heaters overhead that kept the seats at the bar decently warm. Initially the bar was full, so our group got our drinks and stood in the open area behind the seats. We were dressed pretty warmly, but the heaters struggled to warm the areas that weren't directly underneath them. The fire pits were in use, so we didn't get a chance to check out how well they heated.\\n\\nThe cocktails were interesting and very good. I had The Hollow Men and an Autumn Still. The Ink & Fire proved popular with our group, particularly one smoky version of it that used mezcal. They definitely didn't skimp when hiring the bar staff, who appear to be very good at their craft and have a real interest in their craft.\\n\\nThe estimated hour wait came and went and soon our wait time had reached 90 minutes, but the party at our future table was going nowhere, ordering multiple rounds of drinks after dinner. Soon two hours had elapsed, we were getting cold and hungry, and the other group was showing no signs of going anywhere. (Side note: I believe it's unethical for a group to tie up a restaurant's table like this during peak hours. If you're done eating and are going to just drink, move to a drinking space and let the establishment turn over the table to people looking to eat.)\\n\\nEventually, we decided to order food at the outdoor bar and split our group into two seats at the bar, and two nearby tables. My grilled sirloin was done medium rare as I had ordered and was excellent. Curiously, a friend ordered the same exact thing and his came out medium to medium well, but he said it still was good. The Chinese sausage received rave reviews, as did the appetizers (shrimp chips and the dumplings). It was only at the tables (which were between the heated bar and the restaurant's windows) that most of us really started to get unpleasantly cold.\\n\\nThe staff there was very gracious and sympathetic to our plight. They offered us complimentary digestifs, which were excellent. As soon as the party occupying the table finally did leave, we were whisked inside to the table and given complimentary champagne for the birthday we were celebrating. We were a fairly non-fussy group that I would describe as more humorously incredulous at our loitering tormentors than annoyed at the situation, but the staff's attention to our plight definitely helped matters.\\n\\nAll in all, despite the cold and the wait, it was an enjoyable and oddly memorable experience and I'd definitely go back to what promises to be the best drinking spot in the new Assembly Row. I'm curious how the outdoor area is going to fare in the colder months, as the current heating solution isn't going to keep you warm for extended periods out there, unless you're seated at the bar. As currently formulated, it's probably going to be good for a drink in cold weather, but not for gathering and hanging out. I'm sure they wish they could've opened six months earlier, as this space is going to be ridiculously popular in the warmer months."},{"name":"Andina Restaurant","address":"1314 NW Glisan St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Impeccable - exotic Peruvian delicious Tapas    Located in Portland's Pearl District.

Any grandmother worth her salt can win handsdown against this place.\\n\\nYou come here for history.   This is the oldest brick building in Boston built somewhere in 1740.  The restaurant has been in operation since 1826, the oldest restaurant in the United States.  They claim the toothpick was first used here.   One our country's most famous drunk, Daniel Webster, ate breakfast here everyday  when he was in town...a few dozen oysters and a pint of brandy.....darn good thing we didnt have cars in those days.  Now on to the food.\\n\\nNew England Clam Chowder:  5 stars.   This is one of the best clam chowders you can taste.   This is why you come here..AFTER the history.\\n\\nGrilled Sea Scallops:  4.5 Stars.  It was excellent.  Slightly crisp on the outside, tender and moist on the inside.  Would have rated higher if it was served better...they were piled on each other, which made the bottom ones kinda steamed.  Still EXCELLENT.\\n\\nCrab cakes:  1 star   Go to BALTIMORE for crab cakes.   These were awful.   You will do  better in the frozen food freezer in your supermarket..   Too much breading and spices...WHERE WAS THE CRAB?????\\n\\nCole slaw:  1 star   I felt like i was eating a head of cabbage.  Very little dressing and taste.   Our table threw it all away.\\n\\nFried Fish Platter:  2 stars   You can get the same quality at any diner.\\n\\nRaw Oysters:  Hard for me to rate this because the only thing that the restaurant adds to the flavor is the knife used to shuck it.   It is so variable hour to hour on raw oysters in general.  If you like it...you have belly up to the bar and have a half dozen or so., take a shot of brandy..and pretend to be Daniel Webster.\\n\\nSummary:  Come here and order a cup or bowl of New England Clam Chowder, share a plate of grilled sea scallops with your party. and then go down the street to any highly rated estabilshments for a real Boston dinner.  You will be happy happy.  You will have also touched a piece of US history at the same time."},{"name":"Am√©lie's French Bakery & Caf√©","address":"840 Marietta St NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Amelie's is a fairly decent pastry and coffee shop.

But Merrill & Co. was on the ground floor with a rather sizeable outside patio area on the corner.  Inside was even bigger, even after discounting the bar area with its diner style stools attached to the ground.\\n\\nWe ordered a variety of dishes, and found them pretty tasty on the whole.\\n\\nThe most healthy of the batch was the Succatash Salad $13 romaine, charred kale, carrots, grilled corn, fresh peas, cherry tomatoes, chimi-grette.  It was fresh and found pleasing by all who sampled it.\\n\\nThe Stack o'French Toast $10 baguette, macerated berries, whipped cream was skimping out on the strawberries, but the sweetened whipped cream was lovely, almost a dessert.  The french toast being made of thick sliced baguette made for a tough to chew crust.  The egg did not soak through the slice, and the bottom of one slice was burnt.\\n\\nI had been enticed by the sound of Eggs Benedict with Oyster $16 two poached eggs, hollandaise, english muffin, homefries.  The homefries were buttery, and good even without ketchup, though I generally prefer mine to be more the crisp sort.  The eggs were uneven - although mine had some goo, my DC's were hard yolked, which my DC ultimately forgave due to the redemption of their yummy hollandaise.\\n\\nService was pleasant but she had some major difficulties splitting the charge between two credit cards.\\n\\nThe food was tasty, but quality control was lacking.  This is something they could easily fix by paying greater attention in the kitchen.  I'd be up for a future visit to sample additional items off their brunch menu (ie. The Breakfast Sando $11 two fried eggs, bacon, goat cheese, apricot jam, and greens on sourdough, with homefries) and to see if their QC improves.\\n\\n4 stars.\\n\\n*** Dinner Time Visit ***\\n\\nWith a voucher to use and a $25 spend to hit, I opted to enjoy an appetizer and a dessert in place of my initial consideration of an entree and dessert.\\n\\nDessert that day was either a chipwich or chocolate cake for $9, but two fruity-savory sounding options caught my attention.\\n\\nThe Monte Cristo Spring Rolls $9 (fried egg roll, ham, turkey, cheddar, apricot jam) arrived two rolls to a plate, cut on the diagonal, served on top of a pool of a dense creamy jam.  Hot and crisp, it was pretty tasty, but at $4.50 a roll, it was a bit richly priced in my opinion.\\n\\nThe entree was the pan roasted salmon $22 roasted potatoes, almond peach romesco.  The fish was a small yet thick fillet, nicely crusted, but just a tad over cooked.  The skin was crisp as I prefer, however, it was way too overly salted.  I let the server know in hopes that the information would be conveyed to the kitchen, so hopefully this would no longer be an issue in the future.  The potatoes were tasty and a generous portion, however the romesco was more tangy than sweet, and if it weren't for the menu description, I wouldn't have had any idea that there were peaches in it.\\n\\n3 stars.\\n\\n*** 6/2015 ***\\n\\nBye Merrill... gee, that was quick.\\nhttp://boston.eater.com/2015/6/15/8785333/merrill-co-closing-south-end-competition"},{"name":"Bouldin Creek Cafe","address":"1900 S 1st St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"The best almond and coconut milk chais in town.

The wait was really long and we had to wait about an hour and a half to get seated for our table. Just the line tells how great of a place of this is.  So essentially this is the quintessential southern food joint. They both said that every thing on the menu is cooked fresh and never frozen. They also said that all of the recipes were handpicked by the original owner. The dish that I had was the country fried chicken with mac & cheese, bread, and sweet tea. When they say that southern food is comfort food I can thoroughly agree. By the end of the meal I was stuffed and ready to pass out on the couch.

Which brings me to my next tip: do your research before you go.  Ask For Luigi is a teeny-tiny restaurant that does not accept reservations and has no bar or waiting area. You may not like it, but as they say, \\"it is what it is.\\"  \\n\\nWe followed our own advice and read up about this place before we went for lunch on Wednesday.  We waited less than 10 minutes for a table.  Our server was friendly, knowledgeable, and efficient.  We each had a starter (the cauliflower and the anchovies and eggs) and a main (the bucatini and the gnocchi).  All were delicious, and we found the portions to be quite generous.  Overall, I think the place is very reasonably priced for what you get.  The all-Italian wine list is thoughtfully-selected, with glass, half-litre and bottle choices available.

The small stuff was the best: deviled eggs with fried capers and crispy hen skin were delicious and had a wonderful texture contrast the fluke puree was light and very tasty - lots of layers of taste.

This, on top of having the glass of white wine we had ordered to go with the starters coming when we were just about finished eating the first courses.  Again, no apologies.\\n\\nThe entrees were nothing special.  Bland flavors, undercooked vegetables, and an unremarkable rib eye steak for 2 into which most of the thought seemed to have been given to the presentation rather than getting a superior cut of meat.  The duck was cooked perfectly but I could have done as well at home.  The accompanying savory oats and crispy spinach added some needed flavor and texture; the beets seemed like an afterthought.   The lamb saddle was good but the vegetables were so undercooked they were hard and crunchy.   And the entrees did not all come at the same time (but got an apology this time)\\n\\nGood wine list - more Italian wines would be nice.  Desserts were good, I guess.  We were so tired of having waited around for each course our spirits were a bit dampened by dessert time.

With the recent trend of this city, and the more popular places out there, I wanted to find a place that wasn't crammed with people, less commercialized, and still serve up some wicked Mexican, and after a first impression, I think I will be coming back.\\n\\nIf your looking for style and comfort, this is not the place to go, but if your looking for authenticity, you have come to the right place. This place is downright simple, a few tables set up, some pictures of mexico hanging around the walls with some Mexican decorations. The cashregister near the food window, but if you take a clear look you will also see the kitchen, and the two people (on this night) working. Nothing fancy, and your wanting tacos... wait a minute they don't mix... so this should be good.\\n\\nThe menu was quite vast, for a small place, from tacos, to salads, to burritors, and if I recall, a steak selection, there was about 3 pages worth to read. We went right for the tacos... as my dear was craving for this dish for the night... a choice of pork, chicken and beef. She wanted a variety of all meats, but 3 for $6 doesn't get you this, so we went for the chicken. It didn't take too long for the two in the back to muster up our simple dish of 2 tacos, For a 'dive' place like this, the food is very presentable, where they don't make things look perfect. The meat is a little overflowing on top of the three corn toritllas, as they were all lined up in a straight row, and topped off with the chicken. This is finger food people, it doesn't need to look picture perferct, and in some ways because of this, it actually looks good. The meat wasn't overflowing, but they definitely didn't cheap out. Throw a few lime wedges on the side and you have got a fine dish on your hands. Also the tackiness of the salsa coming in squeeze bottle containers that should be housing ketchup and mustard that arrived at our table just said something to us that we were in the right place.\\n\\nThe tacos tasted great, with the addition of the spices they used to cook and make the chicken all tender, and the addition of the lime on the side, this was a solid taco. Adding their salsa just made this thing even more a treat to eat. There was a green one that was pretty good, and there was a couple speaking Spanish to the waitress, and eventually she packaged some of this creamy green looking sauce in a little sandwich bag, tied up, for them to take home, with the additional food they ordered to go.\\n\\nThe first experience here was pretty good. Service can be a little slow, just due to the fact there is only one person working in the front, but that can definitely be overlooked cause your getting some pretty good food for the price. You don't need to go to the heavily commercialized places for Mexican, as this place is probably more authentic than them.

For me, Vietnamese food has never been a go-to type of cuisine (compared to Japanese or Italian where I would always say yes to), until I discovered Lotus.\\n\\nThis gem is located right on the other end of the city where I live. My friend was craving Pho after we saw a movie and wanted to go here. I guess I can credit her for that; I'm glad she wanted Pho that evening or I would never have known about this place.\\n\\nSince it was late when we got there, there was only one other table that was occupied. It's a spacious restaurant with a handful of TV's, all showing sports channels (on both times I've gone). I didn't mind; there was a game that night and recaps are always good. We got there pretty late, so I was expecting a bit of attitude/passive aggressiveness from our server. I was so mistaken. She was the loveliest and most courteous server! Anyway, as soon as I open the menu I find out that the selection is pretty decent. Prices are reasonable, but I wasn't sure how they defined \\"regular\\" vs \\"large\\" for their bowls of Pho. On the both times I've gone, I've tried the Pho Chin Nac, Bo Vien and the Pho Tai, Bo Vien. Both have such flavourful broths, a great amount of noodles, and excellent amount of meats. I usually like flavoured meat, but because the broth was so rich, it really gave the meat the flavour that it was lacking. It was sprinkled with chopped green onions and cilantro? Or possibly parsley, which definitely added to the dishes.\\n\\nPortion wise, I would say their 'regular' and 'large' is quite generous. Large is pretty huge and I was so full after eating two-thirds of my bowl. But I ain't gonna waste no damn Pho, especially something this delish. I had to power through that bad boy, and power through I did. You probably read that and thought of something dirty. You're filthy, so you need to stop. Anyway, $6.95 for a regular and $7.95 for the large is such great value, especially since it tastes this good.\\n\\nAnother thing I got was the Nuoc Dua - Iced Coconut Juice with Fresh Coconut pieces ($3.75). I was told it's a lil pricey, but honestly after trying it, I think it's worth way more than that. Holy nectar of the gods, it is amazing. The first time I was there, I got my non-believer friends to try it. As soon as they did, they all ordered their own glasses. And I will quote them \\"Oh wow, that IS good!\\". The other time I was there, I convinced my mom and brother to try it. As soon as they did, they said the exact same thing. Just trust me on this one, try it when you're there. You will not regret it.\\n\\nAs always, I like to mention bathrooms when I talk reviews. Theirs is a decent size. It's well lit, clean, and fairly stocked. No complains in that department.\\n\\nOverall I can't wait to go back and enjoy my next bowl of Pho. Actually, I would love to try their other offerings. This place seriously makes me want to have 3 stomachs so I can eat 3 meals from there. If I could give this place a 7 stars I would. Can I do that? Ok well consider my 5 stars as 7.

Wings were okay sized and crispy. Not burned, crispy and tender meat. Perfectly cooked. BBQ sauce was full of flavor. Hot wasn't as spicy as I like, but good flavor. Not just a spicy oil like some places try to do. This sauce had some definite soul to it. My burger-master son gave the burger two thumbs up. The cheesesteak was really good, not quite Penn Station but it can hold its own and for the price it was a steal. The steak wrap had the 12 year old in a food coma. The onion rings were also perfectly cooked. Crisp, good flavor. Fries were fantastic. Think Arby's curly fries but less greasy and better. What I also appreciated is they have Heinz ketchup. Prices were decent for the area. After spending time in Disney and Universal with their prices this place is a downright steal. Adding in the 20% tip the bill came to $67.

I had never been to a McMenamins hotel chain before this visit and was thinking big things about what to expect - coming from the opposite coast state. Although I learned a little about this particular resort previous to my stay and about their rooms and what they looked like (with their chalkboard and all), I was thinking - that's strange!  And although I was later told my room was in the English wing, I never heard it until much later. (After the meet, I read about their room configs, but what I got was a room in the English wing. The group pre-purchased my room and failed to mention until very late in the itinerary that they purchased ones in the English Wing which had NO CHALKBOARD (not like I would have used it, but would have looked #awkward to find ones in a hotel room). (I didn't expect to check the website to see room configuration or expectations of room.\\n\\nI stayed here the three consecutive nights. Since I always put out a privacy ticket (with my laptop in the room for most of my stay), I was greeted by three members of the cleaning staff who I told them why I didn't want anyone in the room and they obliged walking quietly away. (It seemed like they were waiting there for many minutes(after checking the \\"we arrived here but found you out\\" sticker on the doorknob they had been standing around waiting for my return. I told them about a fix though. I entered my room & placed my laptop \\"on safety\\" in an area that the fixer-uppers wouldn't have suspected the laptop to be in, and decided to report down to where I saw a cart and where another person was at to tell them about a fix (one of the lights blew - didn't know when it happened). I was able to coax the employee to come down and change the light (the one on top of the door).  I explained my situation, and after I had the \\"service please\\" sign out, I told him to flip it to \\"privacy please\\" - in which he took care of it.\\n\\nAlthough I never had a chance before this 3-night stay to stay at a McMenamins, I am starting to wish that the East Coast would have at the very least 1 (or more) of these. It was a very pleasant stay.\\n\\nThe only real problem I found was that my room didn't have a TV (that tends to be customary for a hotel room) nor did it have any form of a desk inside the room (also quite customary). (I definitely was silly to forget to check these room configurations, and this was partially my fault, along with the person who reserved the room to not explain it to me. I don't like placing my laptop on my lap (since my laptop gets awful warm and really isn't ergonomic at such an angle on my lap). Watch out what type of room you pick  English wingers: those rooms don't get these extras! \\n\\nThe hotel wasn't bad - a little weird, but worthwhile. Expecting more, and receiving less - The bed was big, and after reading a book when I was at home about bed bugs - I got the \\"willies\\" the first night and ended up (I don't even know if this is the right word to use) scared after the first fly (or small insect) landed on my leg moments after I laid down to rest.\\n\\nThe meeting rooms were interesting. Although this was formerly a school from the 1970s (it closed in 1976 and opened in 1997 as a bar), there were some rooms that the chalkboards were still present. Others had other amenities - the Library had books that you could borrow but weren't based on the elementary school level that this place was once a part of. I liked the Library because it had several comfortable chairs and a nice padded sofa.\\n\\nI didn't like their food though. Yes, their salad with chicken was delicious, and the water in the giant pitcher was actually a pleasant surprise, but the rest I was told wasn't medically fixed for my soybean oil problem. - I was told everything was cooked/baked in soy. I know I didn't mention my thoughts about some of the foods they served, but none of the menus ever seemed to suit \\"me\\". I'll let it go, it was my fault I never specified it, but this could have been prevented. After the problematic day, on the next days they served their catering with special meals where I and a few others got fruit salad that I could eat and enjoy.\\n\\nI wish I would have had more time to explore this place a little more. I knew a little about some of the other amenities this hotel had. After coming in at the front desk the first day, I heard a live band in one of the band rooms just before you exited out the door to the English wing. I also researched before the trip and found a movie theatre that McMenamins at Kennedy School has that apparently was where the gym's Stage was. Never had time to get there, but would have been nice to see.\\n\\nMaybe in time I'll come back. Not right now; from the East coast and the cost just to get back to Portland is more than I can afford on my own.

Nice and perfectly cooked, this bad boy was thick and topped with guacamole, veggies, and a savory mayo sauce. It was delicious and quite filling, so I ended up taking half home.

The price was reasonable, and the quality was great.\\n\\nOn this particular visit, though, some issues became glaringly obvious.  For starters, the place is cramped.  VERY cramped.  That's fine if you have a bunch of couples or such, but when you have a group of eight folks stop by (as was the case this evening), the end result is people forced to stand to eat.  And that's never good.\\n\\nThe second was the lack of staffing on a Sunday night, during the summer, on a beautiful day, near a popular beach area.  With only two people behind the counter, it took a ridiculously long time for orders to come through - and the line only grew as the evening went on.  Granted, I think a third person finally came in - and I realize such things are inevitable - but there were some folks who were clearly agitated.\\n\\nLastly was a fly issue - they were buzzing all around all night long - I almost want to chalk that up to having the giant doors open for the weather, but there weren't many flies buzzing around outside, so.... yeah.\\n\\nI really want to give this place a second chance - thinking this was totally an off night, and maybe things just didn't go as well as they should have."},{"name":"Taco Mex","address":"65 Maverick Sq","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"This place is beyond amazing!!

Most of the Texans I've talked to seem to think Dominos is real pizza! So when I heard about Home Slice Pizza and that they are \\"authentic new york pizza\\", I was over the moon! I got up there as fast as I could and ordered a large pie. The atmosphere is very trendy and reminds me of Williamsburg, complete with the hip crowd and music. The garlic knots reminded me more of garlic rolls, but they were delicious! As for the pizza itself, while it was a huge step up from all other texan pizzas, it was missing that certain something in the flavor that I can only find when I visit home. Still the best pizza in Austin and I recommend it to all my NYC friends when they come to visit!"},{"name":"The Eisenhower Bagelhouse","address":"3990 N Interstate Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"I'm impressed!

Goofy eats, quirky help and constant reminders on the Travel Channel.  Even Anthony Bourdain gave it a thumbs up.  From what I have heard, Tony still has flashbacks to the Maple Bacon wonder.\\n\\nWell the hype is true.  VooDoo is more than a doughnut shop; it is a shrine to the sublime,  a temple to the taste buds, and Mecca for the fans of this culinary masterpiece. A trip to VooDoo on your first visit is more like a pilgrimage, a wonderful convoluted combination of Portland Hipster culture and a true 5 Star doughnut experience.\\n\\nDescribing VooDoo is a moving target because it is a constant state of flux where the owners never are satisfied with conventional wisdom and relentlessly pursue the unique and the delicious.  Every visit to VooDoo is, an essence, a flipping of the bird to large corporate doughnut chains that forgot why they got in the business in the beginning.  Sure, Krispy Kreme has a wonderful assembly line approach to cranking out the crispy critters.... and they have heart.  VooDoo doughnuts has soul.\\n\\nTrying to capture the essence of VooDoo is like digging a hole in the sand in the beach.  Just as you start digging, the waves crash and hole you were digging magically fills up.  The magic is truly in the hole.  Embracing the existentialist nada, every day is filled with great opportunity and unlimited possibilities.  Do not fear the whole.... embrace it my friend.  Embrace it and never let go."},{"name":"The Optimist","address":"914 Howell Mill Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"When I called to make reservations 3 days later, I was informed only availability would be 9pm.

Moving from Texas, I felt right at home with the selection of fresh seafood. We tried the scallops and mahi mahi crudo - they're better than your sashimi at an upscale Japanese restaurant. The delicate flavors truly shined through with each bite. I also loved the GA Shrimp a la Plancha as our hot appetizer and the Shrimp and Nduja as our entree. My family enjoyed dinner tapas-style and our server, Mark C., executed our dinner perfectly. My mother-in-law had one of their newest cocktail, The Road Warrior, a summer play on a dirty Gin Gibson Martini... she ordered a second one - that's a good sign.

Olive oil running down your wrist as you snapped your slice in half?  Stop reminiscing and get a slice or two from this place.
