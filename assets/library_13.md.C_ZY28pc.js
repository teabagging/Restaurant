This place was a disappontment and not even comparable to what a considered a cheap rodizio place in North Philadelphia (which itself was a huge downgrade from the best in the city but still good). \\n\\nWe were seated promptly by a waitress next to another table of fifty-something year old grandmas that kept talking about sex-related topics so it was hard not to overhear given our distance. That was annoying and gross. We were then told we could not eat by weight - it's only for takeout which I could at other places. So we had to order the rodizio which was $21.95 for weekdays ($28.95 for weekends). I was fine with that since I had a LivingSocial voucher but that hardly even made a difference to the bill. \\n\\nThe men took forever to serve us meat. We waited and ate our vegetarian side dishes for about 10 minutes (I was about to leave) before a server arrived with \\"pork\\". In my mind, I was like buddy I came here for MEAT aka STEAK. There was literally 5 minute or more intervals between each serving of meat. The chefs in white were manning the meat station for the crowds of take-out people and I guess forgot about the people who were sitting at the tables (and obviously paying more). When we got the sirloin, it was either rubbery or mad raw. Meat quality is average. And why do they make busboys serve us meat? They don't even hold the skewers properly and look like they hate doing it. The pants hanging down their butt doesn't help either. \\n\\nThe waitresses were nice but not very attentive since they were occupied with setting up and serving a large party next door who came after us. They soon swarmed the tiny buffet stations - which had minimal selection. Everything they offered there was either pickled, salad, or french fries. Seriously? French Fries at a Brazilian place? Not pleased at all with its authenticity. \\n\\nWhen the bill came for two people, they automatically added 18% gratutity. I fnd it offensive when restaurants do this. I want to tip \\"accordingly\\". They can have their 18% tip, I won't be returning to give them more in the future. \\n\\nOverall, for the amount of money I am spending for a rodizio dinner, I would recommend going elsewhere that is going to serve you promptly and offer you quality food as well as selection."},{"name":"Petunia's Pies & Pastries","address":"610 SW 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I am repeatedly disappointed with the taste here.

Osaka came up and takoyaki was theirs. For those of you that don't know what takoyaki is , it's a little ball shaped donut-like dumpling the size of a ping-pong ball that usually contains like pieces of cooked octopus, pickled ginger and green onions. The ball is made from a batter similar to pancake mix. The takoyaki is then topped with okonomiyaki sauce, green laver (aonori), mayonnaise, and katsuobushi (fish shavings).\\nThen there is BAKUDANYAKI. This is the same concept except that  these tasty morsels are the size of a softball !!! How can anyone resist giant sized food !!! MMMMMMMMmmmmmmmm\\nI heard about this place a few weeks ago and stumbled onto something on the internet. We found out it was in Richmond but didn't really get the address ?? Someone said it wasn't a restaurant but in a trailer ...... ????? So blindly off we went and discovered it in the Parking lot of an old club, across the street from the RONA hardware store. LOL !!! We pulled up and laughed our asses off. It was a trailer with a small kitchen setup inside it. The service was friendly and liked the selection of Curry, Chili Mayo, Original, Wasabi Mayo, Mustard Mayo, Pizza, or the special. Each bakudanyaki costs $ 5.00 (tax included). So we ordered and waited anxiously for this unique experience. Now I'm a takoyaki fan and love eating these at night market and Powell street festival, so I was really looking forward to having this monster ball in my mouth......hahaha........ yes I just said that !!! \\nAfter about 5 min we get our original bakudanyaki served in a chinese takeout container (very cute). The aroma was great and authentic. The taste was .... good. Good, not great ! It was tasty but to be expected the  texture was a bit more mushy than should be. I know that takoyaki is supposed to be a bit mushy inside, but these were a bit more mushy that I like. Maybe they haven't quite perfected the cooking time but all in all a good experience. There was lots of tasty bits inside, but I think I got squid instead of octopus ...... not sure if this was a way to economize, but good nonetheless. After the consensus was that the texture was a bit odd, we all liked the bakudanyaki and thought it was a fantastic idea and had a very marketable product ! \\nGood luck Tenku Bakudanyaki !!!!

Let me first start by saying the truck is amazing, they staff is as friendly as can be. It is blowing wind and cold outside and the guy gave me a timeframe on my food so I could come back inside and wait. That will automatically give me respect for a business. I also didn't feel rushed to order and get out of the way. When I walked back outside the girl at the pick up window was sweet as can be. \\n\\nNow the burger. It was good. Not amazing. The description made me feel like I was about to walk into a flavorful spectra of burger goodness, I was waiting for the fusion. Mostly, I just tasted the BBQ sauce, which was very sweet. There were next to no onion strings on my burger which disappoints me because I think they could've balanced out the flavor and texture, and kept the bun from getting too saturated with all the sauce and yolk. By second bite, it was falling apart and instead of make a mess, I switched to fork and knife to finish the burger. \\n\\nThe meat itself was well cooked, Medium and nice and juicy. I could have used some seasoning as the toppings really overwhelmed the meat. I couldn't taste the tomato jam, though I could see it. I think I got a hint or two in there. The egg was nice and the yolk burst immediately adding that nice flavor where the BBQ sauce didn't overwhelm.  I feel like the sweet needed to be balanced with something salty or tangy or spicy, my palette was begging for that throughout, something to round the whole thing out. \\n\\nI have a feeling I might have to try this in the restaurant with some fries on the side (I didn't order any).

The decor was really awesome, definitely like a \\"traditional\\" diner. \\n\\nI ordered iced tea and an omelet with portobello mushrooms and house-made vegan cheese ($8.50), and a side of tempeh bacon ($1.75). My friend ordered the eggs benedict breakfast sandwich ($8.25). The iced tea was tasty. When I asked them if they had any sweetener, they said they only had Pure Via, which is made from stevia. At first I was weirded out, but then I tried it and it was actually really tasty. (I even bought a box for myself at home after tasting it). The waitress was a bit slow on refilling my iced tea glass, but they did a decent job at keeping our water glasses full.\\n\\nWe actually had a pretty long wait for our food, and I was starving. Eventually the food came, and honestly, it was worth the wait. My omelet was really light and thin, and wrapped whole portobello mushrooms. The house-made vegan cheese was so light and delicious, I really want to know how they made it. The combination made my omelet taste filling, but also clean and light and healthy. My friend and I didn't like the tempeh bacon- I think it was a bit too thick, which made the texture a bit weird. My friend was neutral on his eggs benedict breakfast sandwich, but I didn't taste it to see what I thought. \\n\\nOverall, a solid vegetarian/vegan establishment, which are always much needed. There are definitely great things on the menu for brunch, and a few things that were less tasty than I hoped for (for example, the bacon).

In my mind the food here is excellent not because they offer an eclectic collection of offerings on the menus (they do) but because their offerings focus on the taste and the quality of the dishes sourced from local and fresh ingredients. For instance, their sausages come from Big Lou's (butcher shop a block away who also sell locally sourced meats), ham from Sloping Hills farm in Qualicum Beach and chicken from Polderside farms in Chilliwack. All the eggs are listed in their menus as being cage-free and the beef grass fed. I'm not going to get side tracked and discuss why it's important for all of us to try and support local and cruelty-free meat products if you consume meat - that's a whole other discussion for another day - but it is nice to see more and more restaurants such as 2 chefs adopt such policy.\\n\\nI've yet to try their dinner offerings, which I am sure are fantastic given my experience with their brunch and lunch menus. Now, having said that I must point out one annoyance of the dishes I have tried so far and that is the Chicken and Waffles. Maybe I am just being snobbish and was fortunate enough to have a relatively expansive culinary experience in my life but I did not enjoy this dish at all: Chicken was very dry and the waffles rubbery. I've tasted some fantastic deep-fried chickens and waffles individually and this dish was not able to come anywhere close to those standards. Collectively and the dish as a whole was definitely well off the mark from the quality I tasted at the legendary Chicken and Waffles restaurant Roscoes House of Chicken and Waffles in LA area. I also feel as though I was harsh on this dish because everything else I have ordered here were fantastic. Could have been an off-day but there are so many offerings on the menu I can always get an entirely different dish each visit. \\n\\nIf you haven't had the pleasure of visiting this spot, I'd highly recommend you do so.

The mushrooms were very well cooked and very decedent. My husband ordered the pork shoulder which is was cooked in a tomato based sauce. His leftovers were turned into an excellent pasta w/ the pork shoulder mixed in. Resembled a Sunday Gravy you would find at any good Italian restaurant.

It was clean, beautifully decorated, easy to park and get around, and most of the staff was friendly. I would definitely recommend it, but since this is a review, here are my complaints. We ate at the buffet. Kind of high to have to pay $20 per person, I thought, and the food was stone cold by the time I sat down, and it definitely wasn't like eating in Las Vegas - no crab at all! Then we played the slots. No complaints there, but we didn't get rich off of them, that's for sure. Then we grabbed a bite at the grill. The hotdog was $9 and wayyyy too big, I could only eat half. Then we popped into the lounge to check out the band. A great little band was playing and we very much enjoyed that, and they had O'Doul's beer, as we don't drink. Then I went to ask a guy what I needed to play Blackjack since it was my first time, and where to get chips, and he said I had to go to the cashier. When I got there she seemed confused and said I normally get them at the table, but did get the chips for me. When I looked for a table I was shocked that it was a $25 minimum, seemed rather steep. I lost immediately but had $15 left, he said I could spend it on roulette but couldn't find any $15 roulette tables. I finally stumbled upon a $15 minimum Blackjack table and happily settled in and won enough for two or three games. I found the dealers not as friendly as I thought they should have been. We also checked out the price of the steakhouse and found that you could eat at the Refectory for cheaper. You'd drop $150 easy for 2 people. Ridiculous!\\n\\nSo, overall, I give it a B - and can't wait to go back and settle in for more Blackjack and/or maybe I'll try roulette, which I've never had the nerve to try either."},{"name":"Salty Sow","address":"1917 Manor Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I've been here multiple times on most occasions I try to make it in for Happy Hour.

I would highly recommend the Happy Hour if possible, that way you can try a bit of both menus. I tend to try to make a reservation as well, it can get busy. It wasn't so busy when I arrived on this last time at 5:30, but it was also a rainy Monday.\\n\\nThere is a parking lot attached to the business, it's right before you actually get to the building. It's fairly large for being downtown, but it does get full pretty quick and hard to park when it gets crowded. \\n\\nThe atmosphere is outstanding, very Austin-ish. The food is unbelievable. There are so many things on the menu to choose from, that picking just one is the hardest part. So I didn't just pick one. I had a little bit of everything. The Triple Duck Fat Fries are outstanding and enough to share, the green chili grits and eggs were also delicious. The pork belly is so decadent that it is a smart idea to share that than to eat it all for a meal. The crispy chicken is so good as well. Everything is just fabulous, \\n\\nThe service is great as well for being a Austin Hot Spot. The dessert is so good that you have to get at least one thing.

The spicy scallop sounded better on paper but I loved the crispy seaweed it was encased in.  During HH (4:30-6:30) rolls start at $4.00.  Sushi at $1.25.  Miso soup a mere $1.

This isn't about her though, this is about her restaurant, Gladys Knight's Chicken and Waffles. Just to warn you, my friends and I arrived here at 10:15 pm and there was a 10-15 minute wait to get a table... AT 10 PM. Moreover, I came here relatively drunk. Whether my memory is reliable on the quality of food may me dulled by the few drinks I had before stumbling in here.\\n\\n When we were seated we already knew what we were going to get, \\"Midnight Train\\", the famous song and the famous recipe together, fried chicken and waffles. As an Atlanta native, southern raised girl at the heart, I had to get the sweet tea. Unfortunately, I prefer my sweet tea a fair amount of tea and sweet however this tea was just a horrendous amount of sugar. I mean, Paula Deen would have been impressed by the amount of sugar in this tea. In the end, I had to douse my sugar drink with water three or four times to get a tolerable consistency. Some people like their sweet tea drowning in sugar unfortunately not me. \\n Then, the food came. Four pieces of chicken laid over a waffle with a side of macaroni and cheese, and hot damn was I a fat kid again. The chicken was good and crispy, and not the kind where the skin falls of but the kind where you bite into it and there's a good crunch. I mean, potato chip crunch. It was wonderful. Helpful tip: If you're adventurous, do what you're supposed to and put syrup on the chicken. The waffle... well was a waffle. There wasn't anything special to it. The mac n' cheese was gooey, and the perfect texture between oven baked and stove top mac n cheese (yes there is a difference). \\n\\nOverall, a good place to go and a good experience for those who want to know what soul food is. You most likely will have to wait. This was a first time experience so waiting was worth the while. Now having tried it, I'm not sure I would be willing to wait in line for it again. Whether it's worth the money is also up for debate. I paid $21 for my whole meal. Either way, I would say if you even have the slightest interest, go and give it a shot."},{"name":"Domino's Pizza","address":"4763 Buford Hwy","city":"Atlanta","stars":"2","text":"slow to deliver ...  1 hour on a Wed mid afternoon"},{"name":"Pistilli's Bistro & Pizzeria","address":"304 South Washington Ave","city":"Titusville","stars":"4","text":"I had the chicken, spinach artichoke flatbread.

Yeah, the pancakes my husband ordered were delicious, but $3 for more syrup?? I ordered the BBQ brisket and eggs. Sure, the menu said it came with jalape√±o cornbread, but I did not expect the entire dish to be so incredibly spicy. Maybe add a warning to the menu? The brisket, eggs, cornbread and homefries were all absolutely smothered in the super spicy BBQ sauce; I couldn't even taste the eggs or brisket, and most of the cornbread was soggy as a result. The sauce overpowered everything, and tasted an awful lot like ketchup to me. I was super disappointed, and ate less than half of the meal. The waiter really didn't seem to care. \\nThe restaurant itself is in an awful state of disrepair-- the bathroom in particular was pretty gross. It was dirty, and the floor was soaked and very slippery. Whatever liquid was on the floor, I trudged through the kitchen as I made my way back to my table. \\nAnd then came the bill. It was over $30 for the two of us to have breakfast there. I didn't even order anything other than water to drink, and we didn't get any extra sides. My husband got a coffee. My dish might have been worth the $14 if I could actually taste the brisket. The pancakes were great, but I don't think I'm in a rush to go back and wait in line in the cold.

I was driving back from dropping off some donated clothes at Goodwill.  I was feeling generous of spirit -- and not even a little hungry.  I passed Rustica Pizza -- site of four or five different eateries in the 25 years that I've been living in and about Roslindale.  They had a sandwich board in front of the restaurant -- so I knew that they were once again open.  Good, I thought, I'll see what their menu is like and maybe come back when I want to eat something.\\n\\nI went in.  There were no customers.  There were no staff at the counter.  They were in the back -- constructing, or fixing, or arranging some cooking equipment.  Three or four people seemed to be back there.  Two of them looked toward me, smiled, and then one of them came down from the back to ask me what I'd like.  \\n\\nI asked him whether they had a signature dish.  He smiled again, took out a menu, went through it and pointed to the many special pizzas they had.  \\n\\nI couldn't leave without eating, so even though I was not hungry, I ordered what I thought might be the most modest item I could get away with ordering and not looking ridiculous.  I mean I suppose I could have just had a soda --but what's the point of that.\\n\\nI settled on the small chicken kabob sandwich -- without onions.  He told me it would be about 15 minutes.  So I settled down with my newspaper, tuned the flat screen TV that was playing a Hallmark movie to the Master's, and waited.\\n\\n7 minutes into the wait a staff person came out and confirmed that I wanted the chicken kabob sandwich without onions.  I told him he had the order exactly right.  He smiled and returned to the kitchen.  13 minutes went by and he came out again, smiling and asking if I wanted the sandwich to go or for here.  I told him that I would eat it here -- engrossed as I was with the Master's.  He smiled and said thank you.\\n\\n15 minutes to the second from when I ordered my sandwich came out.  The chicken was moderately spiced, in small cubes that fit perfectly into the sub roll without spilling out -- though they were ample.  There was a small amount of light white dressing of some kind -- that added a little zing but no mess.  The sub roll was toasted.  The tomatoes and other vegetables (lettuce, peppers?) were well amalgamated in a sort of sauce that coated the chicken and the roll neatly.  In short, it was just about the best prepared chicken kabob sandwich that I have had.  Unlike the pizzas, that struck me as a little expensive for a pizza place, the small sandwich -- perhaps 8\\" or so -- was modestly priced.\\n\\nI stayed about 40 minutes -- as I lingered over the paper.  During my time there no one else came in -- neither to dine nor to take out.  I felt bad -- but chalk it up to a place that is still trying to establish itself in the neighborhood.  \\n\\nI'm eager to go back and order more food so I can better sample the menu.

Literally. All the reviews here are accurate: the portions are gigantic and can easily be used for lunch or dinner or both the next day. My personal favorite is the Chicken Marianna, which is served with artichoke hearts, olives, tomatoes, broccoli, and a light white wine sauce. Every meat entree comes served with pasta, and for an extra $3, they let you choose any of their fresh pastas. I had the cavatelli and my boyfriend had the gnocchi, both of which were clearly made that day and so delicious!\\n\\nThey have an impressive wine list. I've only ever gone as a party of 2, but I can see that Giorgio's would be a great choice for a bigger party as well, since they have plenty of space to line up a long table along one wall. \\n\\n*If you must know (adorable warning!), my boyfriend took me there for our first date, and recently, for our anniversary.

I knew Chef Choo was involved with Hanabi and like the other restaurants that don his menu items (Beluga, Osaka and the former Afin) I was hoping that Hanabi would be a decent place for sushi. Well it wasn't, it was better!\\n\\nI sat at the sushi bar and was in awe of the chef in front of me slicing fishes with the ease and precision, whipping up beautiful edible concoctions. Before I could order my lunch a squid cucumber salad was prepared in front my eyes and quickly placed in front of me. I graciously thanked the chef and ask his name, he replies \\"Chef Choo, as in choo choo!\\". We both laugh and I am instantly charmed. Not only is he an awesome chef, he is down to earth with a sense of humor. \\n\\nI ordered some nigiri and a kappa maki roll. The nigiri I ordered was the sake toro, binnaga and madai. OMG each piece of fish was absolutely delicious. Fresh cuts perfectly paired with items like garlic or ponzu. The normally simple kappa maki was even beautifully plated with a radish cut out as a flower. I leave beyond happy and quickly forgot my woes. The manager came by and asked for constructive input. I offered up what I thought and he was very appreciative. \\n\\nI returned the following week when they kicked off their happy hour which is Monday through Sunday 4:30-6:30. I found my way back to the sushi bar and yay Chef Choo was manning the bar once again. The happy hour menu was just as kick ass as Afin but do I dare say I like Hanabi's sushi better? I ordered the chili escolar, hamachi nigiri and flounder nigiri. Chef decided I needed to taste flounder fin and had a piece served as nigiri. This piece of fish was described as a Japanese delicacy and I must say it had a very unique taste and chewy (like octopus but chewier). Once again everything was absolutely amazing.\\n\\nBoth visits had me giddy as a school girl.  The quality is there without the higher prices of some other places. They have fresh fish offerings from the Tsukiji market which of course is priced higher than regular menu items. If you dine at Hanabi I can say in confidence you will not be disappointed."},{"name":"Abby Lane","address":"255 Tremont St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Nice atmosphere but we didn't get what we ordered.

It wasn't exactly my cup of tea though.\\n\\nIt's got a urban, edgy, vibe in a trendy area of the east side.  Dress is casual but you'll find plenty of dressed up people.  There is definitely a glitterati - and rather young - crowd here.  \\n\\nThe decor is beautifully done but the tables are a bit crowded.  There's an outside area as well that's fine for part of the year when it's not 1000 degrees outside.\\n\\nService was rather spotty with long waits after seating.  I think you're supposed to order drinks first and ruminate on those while waiting to place a food order.  I'm not a drinker so that wasn't too interesting for me.  They have a \\"flight\\" of drinks which I'd recommend to drinkers as you get small portions of a variety of mixed drinks to try in small portions.\\n\\nThe food is mixed, and often very expensive, but you'd expect that from a place like this.  Much of it is common - richly-described however.  For example, there's pork belly in a taco.  Eh.  Every trendy place is serving pork belly these days.  It's gross - thick layers of spongy fat with stripes of nicer meat.  They top it with a soft-boiled egg.  Nice touch.  In fact, their use of eggs is widespread and welcome.  \\n\\nThen of course they have the ubiquitous brussel sprouts that are de rigueur in places like this.  The eggplant fries were a new dish to me.  OK but it's hard to make a watery, mushy veg into a fry. They tried.\\n\\nThe truffled deviled eggs are an interesting item.  They put a little truffle oil on them and they're good.  \\n\\nThe duck fat fries are often raved about.  Again with that ubiquitous soft-boiled egg on them.  Nice touch.\\n\\nFor me, however, I prefer a less chaotic, more homey place.  I can't decide whether this place is about the food or the drinks, though I think it's more a fancy drink place than restaurant, although they do have plenty of food.\\n\\nDon't order take out.  They seem to find that an inconvenience and don't honor their happy-hour prices, claiming they can't make those portions for take out.  \\n\\nIf you like trendy, hipster, young, busy, crowded, and fancy drinks, this could be your place.\\n\\nAnd oh yes - it's on the East Side.  That's a prestigious address for this type of place.  It certainly doesn't fit the neighborhood, although there's a string of this type of place along this stretch of road."},{"name":"Ovation Coffee & Tea","address":"941 NW Overton St","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"I usually don't write reviews, mostly because I find other reviewers are pretty accurate to my experience. However, in this case I think the ones found here aren't exactly painting a fair picture.\\n\\nPro's:\\nThe food was decent for a cafe. Nothing special, but certainly nothing to complain about either. If you want a quick bite it is a good option, especially considering it sits in an area of the pearl that doesn't have much options...although it's really not that far of a walk to better ones.\\n\\nThe staff/owners are very friendly and you will most likely receive good service.\\n\\nIt sits right on the edge of \\"The Fields\\".

We have a lot of great coffee shops in Portland, I'm sorry to say this is not one of them (if coffee is what you seek). My cappuccino was burnt and the foam was that classic \\"I have no idea what I'm doing\\" ladled on top mess.\\n\\nSo if you're just looking for convenience, and you don't really care about the coffee, it's likely you will have a good experience.\\n\\n*It's hard to write a review that isn't extremely positive about a business that has good service and are friendly, but I just thought some honesty would be fresh...as it seems to be very unbiased so far."},{"name":"Clay's Sports Cafe","address":"6518 Roswell Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Great food and great service.

I mean, how often am I going to wander down I-Drive?  Meeting some friends to celebrate their son's birthday presented such an opp.  We had a reservation for 7 at 7, but 2 bowed out on account of health; and then there were 5.\\n\\nThe presence of the piano (and its sound) greeted us as we're taken to our table.  Upon check-in, we were presently (and pleasantly) surprised to find a 20% discount on Yelp!  I wouldn't call the menu expansive, but I'd always rather a chef does a small number of things well than a large number of mediocrities.  I'd heard some good things about the she-crab soup, and some of the salads looked interesting ($7, $10 to share; not clear if the latter is a larger portion than the former - wish I'd asked).  But there seemed little collective desire other than to just jump into the main course.\\n\\nI asked our waiter Sal whether the lamb chops (2 of them, we're told, $27) were rack-of-lamb type, or what's commonly called loin chops (guess they're ALL loin chops: so I specifically mentioned T-bone).  Sal assured me they were not the T-bone variety.\\n\\nSal wrong.\\n\\nTurns out these were 2 double rack of lamb style chops, really on the small side (maybe 4 oz. of meat net of bones).  I understand the price of racks ($11 /lb even at Costco), and don't begrudge them this rather miserly portion - just for comparison, Capital Grille has a full, larger rack (8 ribs) for $45, but they're Cap Grille.  In any case, if you're a major carnivore, skip this, as you'll be disappointed with the portion.  It was done perfectly as ordered, accompanied by a nicely done risotto and spinach (but both are definitely NOT low fat, or reduced sodium).  By contrast, my wife's duck confit was surprisingly no-sodium.  It was otherwise quite well prepared, but duck confit with no taste is, well, unusual.  Our friend's special of the day, a 16-oz. bone in striploin with herb butter looked nice, but the other dish of jambalaya was, well, unusual.  It was a very small portion of the rice, but off on their own were 4 shrimps and the Andouille.  I've had my share of this dish, and I must say this is the most unusual presentation I've ever seen.  Separate or not, the entire dish was also on the small side.\\n\\nConsidering that there were few tables there, food took a while to arrive, but we didn't mind too much.  Service was fine, but we were disappointed that nothing was offered to our 12-y.o. b-day boy other than the scoop of ice cream he was getting from his kid's meal.  So we ended up ordering the strawberry cake, which was OK, but the cream was artificial, and there was no candle.\\n\\nI think the price-value proposition is a wee bit on the negative side - cloth napkins and thick bathroom paper towels suggest a pricey place (even if it's a wooden table with no table cloth), and of course there's live entertainment.  I'm not going to say we were disappointed, as we weren't overall.

The backyard in the back is awesome.\\n\\nI read some reviews that did not like the food. Well, here is the thing: Mexican cuisine is very varied. Every one of the 32 states has its own set of dishes. There are dozens of types of Mole. So if you did not like the Mole here it is probably because you were expecting Mole Poblano (brown, sweet) and not the traditional Mole Negro from Oaxaca. \\n\\nI was born and raised in central Mexico, traveled around the country and love authentic Mexican food. This place is fantastic and authentic.\\n\\nWe ordered a Llorona and a Strawberry cocktail. Both were unique and delicious. The tamales and garnachas were great. The 7-chile salsa was fantastic, flavorful and with the right level of hotness.\\n\\nThe bean soup was delicious. I have never had a bean soup that tasted like that in the U.S. although I was expecting some sour cream on top, queso cotija and more fried tortilla strips - at least for decor.\\n\\nThe chile relleno was very well prepared. I tried my firend's black mole with chicken. The mole, as I wrote above, was excellent and flavorful. At the beginning you may feel your palate is confounded with a new taste. By the time you are finishing up you are scraping the plate for the last drop.\\n\\nThe spinach Pastel Azteca was exquisite. Especially after adding some of the 7-chile salsa on top. But the highlight of the evening was the cochinita pibil. There are a couple places in Austin that make good cochinita pibil. Honestly, you can get some decent packaged cochinita at HEB (by the tuna fish and canned chicken). But this one was extraordinary. The tortillas were delicious and house-made.\\n\\nOur server was super friendly and helpful. Chef De la Vega (I think?) stopped by our table to check everything was right. I ate a lot and feel proud about it. Looking forward to come back and try the Tinga. See if it can beat my wife's Tinga - haha.\\n\\nYes, it is on the pricey side.

There 'twaren't  a dish in all creation--or at least on their nifty menu--that didn't pass through a fire of smoky hard wood pirouettes and vinegar kisses and dreams.

But I'm one Honcho in the crowd, and probably not the only one-for that matter-- that wants bbq hot sauce w/a Texas-sized mule kick in the teeth. Like Foghorn Leghorn said, I want it to be \\"about as subtle as a hand grenade in a barrel of oatmeal.\\"\\n\\n\\nI loved their smoked trout--tender and delicious! The pork ribs were fall-off the tender and a bodyfat percentage highly conducive to retaining the smoky emanations.

I dunked it all the afore-mentioned sauces in turn, and the main flavor was, wait for it........ vinegar! Tang! Their hot link was MIA, and their pulled pork was tender and flavorful and had great mouth-feel. My group was unanimous on the ribs and pulled pork as winners, also liked the corn-bread crumbly mac and cheese, and felt the greens were far too oniony and yes once more, dear hearts, too vinegary. \\n\\nThere it is.

Yes, they've upgraded their interior a bit, but the food quality has been utterly downgraded. They charge $23 for Galbi (marinated beef short ribs) but we were disgusted to find that it was NOT short ribs at all. They were using a less expensive meat which had been cut up into pieces prior to arriving to hide the fact that it was NOT short ribs!  (Galbi is usually served in long strips and cut at the table in the grill.). And the meat was of poor quality. \\n\\nWhat makes it worse is that the waitress was rude and dismissive. No one gave us menus until a good 5 mins after sitting down even though there were 4 servers hanging around with just two other tables. A Korean waitress came finally with water on a serving dish and exclaimed 'I didn't give you menus!' And proceeded to leave the entire serving dish with the waters unserved in the table while she left to get the menus. \\n\\nWhat was worse was when she handed me the salad bowl and asked me why I wasn't taking it from her hand.  Then she handed me another salad bowl to pass to my husband.

When we asked why she was not helping us grill it (as is expected at Korean BBQ), she simply replied that she couldn't reach the grill. \\n\\nThen to top it off, she charged us 18% gratuity.

I walked up, and they told me it was actually $5.95. I told them that it said $4.95, and they said their menu and prices had recently changed. For a few minutes they refused to come over and check at all. Then one lady said she would check with me, and then proceeded to walk right in the opposite direction.

Eat your cake.\\" I told her she didn't have to, but she refused to take her money back. I bought the cake, paying $6.50. The person at the counter grabbed something totally different than what I wanted. I told her I wanted the other thing. She said what I wanted was the Buckeye Brownie. It CLEARLY was not a brownie. I still got it, and it cost $4.50. I ran and told the incredibly kind woman who gave me a dollar to give me a second and I could give her dollar back. Well, the lady at the counter handed me nine cents. She said she owed me 22, and had already given me 13 before. What? I told her I needed two more dollars, and she refused until I told her I had paid $6.50 before instead of $4.50. By the time this all ended, the lady who gave me the dollar was gone.

I absolutely love good carne guisada.  You know the kind slow cooked to where it is good and tender, filled with flavor, swimming in just enough gravy to drip out from a perfectly filled tortilla.  Having said this, Amaya's fits the bill better than anyone I have found in Austin yet.\\n\\nI used to work close by and found myself frequenting their to go window at least once a week for a good stint of time.  I haven't been back in a while, but my order usually consisted of carne guisada tacos and breakfast tacos of sausage potato and cilantro.  I typically avoid their cheese because it's reminds me of government issued cheese.  They use fresh potatoes rather than frozen and depending on the day will cut sausage patties in half to fill your taco or crumble the sausage.  Their carne guisada is always good and lean (nothing worse than biting into a nice hunk of fat at 8am in the morning) with a flavorful thick gravy that is seasoned perfectly.  I love heat so I always add a ton of their salsa which is also quite good.  \\n\\nI had their crunchy picadillo (ground beef) tacos a couple of times.  They were adequate,  but greasy.  Definitely not something to eat unless followed by a nap or a 2 mile run.  \\n\\nI've found that breakfast is always a safe and tasty bet.  The place is always packed for breakfast which is why I place my order to-go.  The ladies at the to go counter are always friendly and efficient.  I've never had an incorrect order and they are always willing to give me more salsa without an extra charge even when I ask for 10 salsas on 3 tacos.  Overall I have very fond memories of Amaya's especially their carne guisada.  I don't understand the recent bad review about their carne guisada, but it has been a while since I've been there.  Maybe it's time for another visit.."},{"name":"Pupuseria Maya","address":"2108 Michigan Ave","city":"Kissimmee","stars":"4","text":"My husband and i were craving pupusas and they are hard to find over in Brevard county where we live.

I've never really wanted to try it sooner because of the shady parking lot right next to it. It's just really sketchy. There's ALWAYS a guy standing at the front of the lot trying to get money from you. It's gotten so bad that there's a continuous announcement outside of the restaurant that tells you NOT to buy parking tickets from them. PLEASE pay by the machine and be alert. The guy will tell you to park in the back of the lot ... Which is very dim. The parking itself makes dining at this establishment kind of scary & uncomfortable. \\n\\nThe food was okay. I believe it was a bit overpriced. I had the smothered chicken with grits, cornbread muffin, and mac & cheese. The chicken is boneless and fried covered with gravy all on too of rice. The sweet tea was really sweet. I've never had it that sweet before and I really like sweet tea...too sweet. The combination of gravy, fried chicken, and rice was good. The grits were good and buttery. The mac & cheese was not good. It was dry. \\n\\nThe service was below average. Our server barely checked up on us and we had to grab his attention so that he can pay and leave. He didn't even give us the dinner check. He just took my credit card without asking if my friend and I were splitting the check...super awkward and weird of the server not to ask since it's pretty standard nowadays. My knife was given to me with good particles still on it, but good thing my friend wasn't using his. \\n\\nOverall, I would dine here again, but not anytime soon.

Their lunch prices are incredibly low for all you can eat meat. The food is fine, it's just not going to blow you away. You get the occasional perfectly crispy and juicy cut, but the meat tends to be on the overdone and salty side. My favorite here is the beef short ribs. If you get chicken, pork, or lamb, ask for the crispy edges or juicer sections. You also get access to the buffet which features a salad bar and sides. They are generally fine. For dessert get the grilled pineapple with cinnamon. \\n\\nService is friendly and these days the restaurant doesn't really get too crowded so you should get plenty of attention.  It might even be better to go when it's a bit crowded, as they'll have more meat in circulation.

I've been here a few times, and had been to Happy's as well, and, there's just not many good things to say, but I will start with the positive:\\n\\nKevin, the bartender, is great. He is very friendly and polite and he looks like Michael Buble. He also makes delicious drinks (and they were pretty strong). The only cocktails on the menu were margaritas and 3 other ones with just vodka, so I told him what liquor and flavors I like and he whipped up something delicious. \\n\\nThe other good thing about Barrio is the space itself. It's gorgeous and has an outside patio. I really like the layout, as there are lots of different options, bar, booth, table, cozy nook with comfy chairs and there's a band in the restaurant where I bet you could go to get out of the riffraff...if this place ever gets busy. \\n\\nSo, my brother and I arrived on a Thursday summer night to an empty bar in Fenway.

And then instead of brushing it off as a silly mistake and moving on, he was super awkward and weird and just stood there behind us at the bar. Ahhhhh. \\n\\n-When we said we were not interested in ordering food, the manager said, \\"Why?\\" I'm sorry but....we were sitting at the bar at 9pm and had already eaten. We were just out for drinks.\\n\\n-TV was showing an infomercial. About sexual dysfunction. What?!\\n\\n-No music. That is, until my brother and I said something and the manager took out his laptop and hooked it up to the speakers. He took my requests, but it was oddly silent in between songs because he was using youtube to play the songs. \\n\\n-Ok, after a few drinks, my brother and I took the liberty of talking to manager, since he was so interested in us, about how he could make improvements, like the music, TV, etc. And he responded with saying that he thought the place was doing really well.

One was a hit, one was not...\\n\\nThe wontons were like over-sized pot-stickers with almost zero filling inside - the sauce was too syrupy and didn't seem to go well with the dumplings, although I did like the spiciness of the sauce.\\n\\nThe Lemon Pepper Chicken was good; the chicken was the tough texture you often find at lower-end Chinese restaurants, but wasn't awful and wasn't just gristle.  The fry-job on the chicken (before being sauced) was good but a little heavy, and the sauce was the best part.  Not quite citrus flavored, but peppery and lightened by acid from some ingredient; also, the sauce was almost dried on to the dish, rather than the runny, syrupy sauce on most dishes at a place like this.  The dish also had great pieces of red and green bell pepper, baby corn, and snow peas which went well with the sauce.\\n\\nTheir white rice was pretty standard, maybe a little better than some places.\\n\\nThe service was quick, ordering was no hassle and in fairly good English, and the place seemed fairly clean for a strip-mall Chinese joint."},{"name":"Hanabi","address":"2525 W Anderson Ln, Ste 120","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Family wanted Asian food for dinner and wasn't really something I was prepared for since when you're in TX, normally you want to eat BBQ and tacos.

I have had the pleasure of dining at some of the finest steakhouses across the country over the years, and from a standpoint of steak alone, American Cut definitely delivers a fine steak, cooked as ordered with excellent flavor.  However, the similarities between American Cut and the true 5 star and 4 star steakhouses unfortunately end there.  The side dishes, which for us were the Buffalo Cauliflower, Sunchoked Spinach and Tobacco Onions missed on 2 out of 3.  While the Tobacco Onions were very tasty, the Buffalo Cauliflower and Sunchoked Spinach were simply mediocre.  All that being said, the biggest miss was the service.  Now I am not one requiring over the top pampering, however if you are going to operate a high end steakhouse, there is an expectation that you will receive high end service.  The beginning of our experience was very positive with our server, a helper and a water attendant.  As it was a Sunday evening at 7:00, the restaurant was not busy with only 1 or 2 other small parties and other than a slight delay with our drink orders, everything was fine.  While we were eating, a large party of 8 or 9 was seated near us, and that was the end of our service.  We sat at our table, with finished meals for 25 minutes, with only continued water service.  Finally, the helper, dropped off 4 dessert menus...no explanation, no offers of additional drinks, no questions as to how our meal was...nothing.  After another 15 minutes, the helper came back and collected the dessert menus, and I was able to ask for the check before he rushed off.  Ten minutes later he brought it and after another 10 minutes of it sitting on the table with my credit card on it, I was able to flag down our server to ask her if she could run it through, so nearly an hour after finishing our meal, and minimal additional attention, we were able to leave.

Don't get me wrong, this market is much better than a Safeway or Fred Meyer, they do have live tanks, but I felt like the prices were too step for me.

We ordered a cappuccino and a latte.\\n\\nUpon taking my first sip of the cappuccino outside the shop, I said out loud \\"I haven't had coffee this bad since 2005, back in Michigan!\\" The espresso in both drinks was bitter. Clearly the beans were improperly roasted, ground too long ago, or simply old. The preparation of the milk was terrible as well. The milk in both drinks was overheated and burnt which only enhanced the bitterness of the espresso. My cappuccino had course scooped foam on top (early 2000s second wave style) not the finely textured milk that I get even from some Starbucks baristas now.\\n\\nThe coffee was so bad that we threw it in the trash a block from the store and bought replacement drinks at another shop.\\n\\nI know that Anna Bannanas serves more than just coffee, and perhaps coffee isn't even the focus of their business, but I believe that if you're going to prepare and sell a product, you should do it right. Every item sold reflects upon the quality of the available products as a whole.

The lounge is filled with the most comfortable looking chairs-don't you hate when you go to your favorite cafe and someone is seating in your most favorite chair? Well you don't have to worry about that here, because all chairs look equally comfortable and inviting. The space is decorated in a dark, almost victorian-esque way that makes you want to curl into a chair with whatever literature you chose to bring along. They also have a bookcase full of games that look as if they still have all the pieces in the box. I absolutely loved the atmosphere this place had, which was completely void of any hipster quality and instead more like a real neighborhood cafe. \\n\\nThe menu was slightly overwhelming, but that could just be because I work at a coffee shop myself. I felt like the barista was slightly impatient with me, but I was the only customer needing to order, so maybe he just doesn't have the friendliest of personalities.

They served a lot of food and was very presentable and overall had good taste. I have gone a total amount of about two times recently and have left completely dissatisfied. Today I gave it another chance thinking the last 2 times were probably bad because we went on a weekend but no today it was the same exact thing. Order a 6oz steak with shrimps and received a steak that looked like it 3oz and literally only received three really small shrimps. Steak had no flavor and was very hard to chew on, the three little shrimps were tender but had absolutely no flavor. My wife ordered a chicken tender salad and they gave her one chicken tender cut into five little pieces. Aside from the little chicken tenders they forgot to bring the croissant with honey butter. Waiter was ok but was also not the best seemed like she was getting frustrated from working but if I do not receive what I ask for and I am dissatisfied I have to let them know.

Not that all of the food was terrible, but none of it was great. I had Mole Pablano, my wife ordered Pollo Adabado (Chicken fajitas), we had the queso fundido as an app, both had (2) margaritas and with tip the bill came to $160. We were out for a nice dinner so I don't mind paying a little extra for good food and better service but something was lacking in both. The salsa they bought with fresh chips started things off well, we both really enjoyed the salsa. The queso app was very bad. It came out in a cast skillet but was just a solid glop of cheese that over time separated and became a glop of cheese sitting in milky, watery fluid. My Mole was good to very good but my wife's fajitas were average at best. Margaritas were good but nothing great. The service was ok but felt like they should be more attentive considering it wasn't that busy when we were there. My wife asked for flour tortillas with her dinner and got corn. The waiter never came back and asked how our food was and I had to flag him down to order the second round of margaritas.

They do make good steaks, and for the value, it is better than Gothams (both owned by same person).  Likely, they both source the meat from the same place but the marketing, branding and target market is different. Hy's is a lot more conservative and refined, if I can use that word.  Gothams is more towards the modern and trendy crowd.  At Hy's you get the same thing as Gothams, but at a lower price point.\\n\\nThe inside decor is like an old boy's club.

And nothing really even came close to expectations. Now, to their benefit, most of the appetizers are priced pretty reasonably (e.g. Deviled Eggs are $3.95, which isn't bad).

Not only are the portions small, but the flavor is missing.\\n\\nI've had better dressed, presented, and sized burgers at random dive bars than here. So I can't really recommend their burgers.\\n\\nAs far as steaks go, I was assured they were fresh, but that was the extent of the detail given. I was not impressed. I'd say it was about on-par with Outback Steakhouse, a few dollars more expensive, with a lot less overall food (since Outback gives you a number of sides).\\n\\nThe Creme Brulee is laughable. I cannot recommend this dessert. The menu, first of all, does not mention it is a banana creme brulee. I would actually not have ordered it if this were the case, but furthermore, the execution is just bad. It was chunky / soggy, and the top wasn't even crisped. It was really anything but a creme brulee.\\n\\nNow, all that said, again, the ambiance and beer selection is pretty nice.

We ended up waiting nearly an hour and forty-five minutes and each time (three times) we asked the hostess (possibly the owner/manager) how much longer the wait wild be he informed us it would be fifteen minutes in a somewhat bothered tone.  Once we were finally seated, we were promptly served water and bread with some olive oil.   This though would be the highlight of our evening as the waitress only talked to us twice, once to order our food and the second time for our check.  No employee ever truly apologized for the wait and many tables were left empty despite at least 20 people still waiting outside.  The kicker is the food was bland and didn't live up to the hype of previous reviewers.  My wife upgraded to the homemade pasta option and was severely disappointed by it's easy bake oven level of taste.  This restaurant for lack of a better word sucks.

Unfortunately, we were super disappointed. We loved the speak-easy theme of the restaurant so we went to their website to get the password for that night's entry, but upon or arrival, we were greeted by a less than enthusiastic hostess who simply asked if we'd like a booth or a table - no mention of the password. Anyway, we took a seat at the bar and were greeted by a super friendly waitress. My husband ordered an old fashioned, and I asked to see the cocktail menu. The bartender said that they are still working on a printed menu. I found that disappointing, as I really enjoy trying restaurant-inspired cocktails, and with no menu, we struggled a bit to make a selection. We then ordered the fried green tomatoes, which were quite bland, and scarcely showed a trace of the remoulade that was supposed to garnish the dish. We also ordered the she crab soup. It was served lukewarm so we asked if they could heat it up a bit. Once served to temperature, it was easily one of the best she crab soups I have ever tasted - it was amazing! I ordered the shrimp and grits, and unfortunately, they too were not at temperature. They were again lukewarm. I didn't return it to the kitchen because after one bite it was clear that even proper temperature would not be able to save this dish. The flavor was mediocre, at best. My husband had the duck and waffles with blueberry confit. He noted that the flavor was bland, and there was nothing to marry the flavors of the two main ingredients. Lastly, the restaurant had a live pianist who was quite awful. She was reading the music (as opposed to playing by ear) and would often stop mid-song to look down at the keys to find her next note.

We got to our table and sat down and for the rest of our meal there were at least 4 or 5 open tables for the ENTIRE rest of the time we were there. I totally understand mistakes happen and technology isn't perfect but the way the hostess was so rude about it left a bad taste in our mouths. We appreciated her getting the table for us but some courtesy and apology would have gone a long way at the get go.\\n\\nNow as far as food and drinks go! Every single thing that we ordered was absolutely amazing and our waiter was fantastic! I highly recommend the La Fresa for a drink. It was super refreshing and not too sweet. The Queso Fundido was to die for as well! They brought out these tiny rolls with this chile sauce that was really hot but had a really really great flavor. I had the Tinga Poblana and it was sooooo good! Another person in our group got the Chile Relleno and it was the best I think I have ever had! My fiance got the sea bass and it was a perfect cut of fish and was so rich and delicious! The meal itself could not have been better! \\n\\nI wish that we had had a better experience from the start but our friendly waiter and wonderful food made up for it! \\n\\nMoral of the story do not depend on the online reservations, I would call the restaurant directly to make sure that you actually have the reservation you think you have!

I wasn't sure what to get so I asked the waitress what she recommends.  She recommended a couple options, and I ended up choosing the Club, and it was delicious!

However, Salty Sow did a wonderful job with the renovations and its very cozy and inviting. All of the staff was exceptionally nice. The food was really really good. We ordered 2 appetizers and 2 entrees and each was extremely well done and delicious. The oyster and boudan fritters were stupid good. All in all they did a great job. The only downside I can see is that the patio area doesn't have the same sit back and relax feel that Red House did. Meaning, it may not be the very best place to just go and hang out.

It's somewhat unusual in that aspect because you don't really know who to look for or ask for when you want or need something so you end up grabbing the next person to pass by your table wearing a black shirt (chosen color for the waitstaff). for food we ordered the smoked salmon frittata, traditional french toast, coconut chia breakfast salad with almond butter toast, side of potatoes, a kids half waffle, a power wrap and a carrot cake pancake. coffee was brought to the table in a carafe to allow it to keep warm and you could pour as you drank. all the tables had small bowls filled with either flavored (hazelnut or vanilla) or regular creamers. we also tried the energizer drinks-one with kale and one with beets. The food was fantastic (with the exception of the french toast) and full of flavor. i expected the salmon frittata to be a little bit larger for the price ($10) but it tasted amazing so it made up for the size. the french toast was a bit on the drier side and tasted more like pan fried bread than true french toast but the other menu items were absolutely delicious. the coconut milk chia pudding tasted like coconut and the fruit it was topped with was super fresh. the belgian kids waffle was light and fluffy. the power wrap was flavorful and the potatoes were just right with a bit of crisp but still some softness to them. the energizer drinks were good (especially the kale one!) but the one with beets was a bit on the sweeter side and i found it to be too sweet for me personally. \\n\\nthey initially forgot to bring out the side of potatoes when everything came out and i was impressed with how quickly the manager attended to the issue to make sure it was resolved. in less than 5 minutes we had our potatoes on the table. \\n\\nthe ambiance in the place is rustic and the design is more of an industrial setting which i liked. woods mixed with metals and simple decor such as edison lights and hanging cast iron pans.

On top of that, they force you to order at least one entree from the most expensive section (during lunch) before they will honor it and you can't order from the specials even they aren't on the menu at full price. So are they really specials to begin with? Oh and forget about substituting anything they will up-charge you any chance they get.

This is a good place to watch not only Orlando soccer games, but world games as well. The staff are more than happy to accommodate you if you want to watch an Arsenal or Barcelona match.\\n\\nTheir brunch selection isn't big, but this is one of those places where you'd rather have them do a few things perfectly instead doing of a lot of things half-assedly (I'm an English major. I'm allowed to make up words). I mean, all you really need is the traditional Irish breakfast which consists of two Irish sausages,two rashers (Irish bacon), two servings of black pudding, two servings of white pudding, 2 eggs, and some mushrooms. If that sounds like too much, they offer the option of ordering a half-size portion. You can also get some Jameson whiskey in your coffee if you're feeling saucy during brunch and want an excuse to use more four letter words to shout during a soccer game.\\n\\nBut this isn't just a great brunch place. Their dinner service is just as great. Most of it are Irish twists on traditional American fare like burgers and nachos, but their concoctions are always top notch. I highly recommend \\"The Dubliner\\" and the \\"Irish Stew\\". Do it. You won't be disappointed. \\n\\nWhenever a friend suggests going to Harp & Celt, I'm always down for it. The food is delicious, the staff are always on top of things, and, in general, it's just a cool place to hang out at. The next time you want to watch a soccer game with some friends, head to the Harp & Celt and invite me because I will totally take you up on that offer."},{"name":"El Naranjo","address":"85 Rainey St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"OMG!

I love eggs benedict with pimento cheese and having it on biscuits instead of english muffins (which I always think are boring) makes it really good.\\n\\nThe breakfast bowl is also really good in a super indulgent way. It's basically a big ol bowl of their grits (which are dangerously creamy and dreamy) with two fried eggs, their oven baked green tomatoes, bacon and salsa. I can't finish it because there are just so many grits, but it's really good (based on the assumption that you like grits). \\n\\nTheir green tomatoes are good by themselves and not fried ( if you care about that) but still crunchy. You can get them as an appetizer that comes with goat cheese and like a walnut medley and there was a Yelp deal for a free one of these when we went!\\n\\n\\nThings that are meh to me:\\n-oatmeal pancakes\\n-their potatoes\\n-turkey hash\\n-turkey burger\\n\\nService is normally fine, but they won't seat you (at least on weekends) until your party is there.

We were not deterred even though it said family style dining.\\n\\nUpon walking in, we were seated right up front by the window in the open air, it was perfect. They had a separate menu with lunch specials. There were about 5 different choices all for $7.95. You could choose 1 or all 5 if you wanted to try them all. I ordered the lunch Chicken Marsala and Chicken Calabrese. WHOA! I figured since it was lunch and very inexpensive, the portion wouldn't be family sized, but I was wrong. Nonetheless, the flavor was out of this world and while it didn't come with pasta, I didn't even need it!

The Quesadillas were good though I have never been a huge fan as it's just cheese and chicken. The portion was large though so I have no complaints. It was for the kids anyway.\\n\\nThe Hummus was awesome! I am kind of a Hummus snob and like to try it whenever I find it on the Menu and this was no disappointment. I rank it right up there with Yanni's on Cleveland Ave which has been my favorite. i like a lot of garlic and this batch had plenty. It included 2 different flavors and both were perfect with the Jalapeno being my favorite and not too spicy hot at all. Kids loved it too.\\n\\nI then tried the Kentucky Bourbon Chicken sandwich and it was another winner. Great portion size and the bun was fresh. I got it with the fries and they were what you would expect when ordering fries. Great flavor, great sandwich.\\n\\nI decided to try the bread pudding as it is one of my favorite desserts. I am not a fan of theirs. It was essentially baked bread with some sweetness but none of the custard'y soft wetness one expects from bread pudding.

Like me, the main blogger there is a stickler for burgers cooked to order and he recommended Casablanca as a restaurant which knows how to cook to order.\\n\\nI took advantage of a 50% off Scoutmob certificate, and tried the bacon cheeseburger last weekend.  While waiting for my burger, I chatted with the waiter/manager about the blog entry which I had read, and he wholeheartedly agreed that it's important to cook burgers to order.\\n\\nOf course, they screwed up the burger by charring a burger ordered medium rare to a shade below medium well.  The interior of the burger was half-gray and half-very pale pink.  The exterior was almost entirely blackened.  It had been overcooked for so long that the burger shrunk down to half the size of the bun.\\n\\nSurprisingly, you can't chalk it up to a chef/cook with too much to juggle at once.  I dined on a Sunday afternoon around 2 pm and there weren't more than five tables to concern the waitstaff and kitchen during my visit.\\n\\nYet, they still incinerated the burger.\\n\\nWhen I told the waiter/manager about this after my meal, he said what every waitperson says when I tell them that a burger was overcooked:  I should have told them so they could remake the meal.  While I appreciate the sentiment and offer to start on a new burger from scratch, I don't usually feel like spending two hours at a restaurant waiting for my food because they messed up the order the first time.\\n\\nIf you're paying $3, give or take, for a burger at Wendy's or wherever, you get what you pay for as it rolls off the assembly line.  But if you're paying north of $10 for a burger, you've got every right to order it to your liking and every right to expect that it's cooked to order.\\n\\nReally, if you can't get it right every time, stop serving burgers and leave it to people who know what they're doing."},{"name":"La Famiglia Giorgio's","address":"112 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"This area of town is incredible for Italian restaurants.  Walking up neighboring Hanover Street, almost all one sees is restaurants, and they are all Italian.  This restaurant is two blocks off that expensive area, but the parade of Italian restaurants continues.  The difference is that the prices get better and more affordable as you get away from the main drag.  For example, a basic plate on Hanover Street would be at least $20, but probably more.  Over here, it's more like $12, and at least of the same quality.  \\n\\nThis restaurant has a number of vegetarian and gluten-free options, offering at least 12 different kinds of sauces, and at least eight different kinds of pasta.  They also do a nice eggplant parmigiana, and even offer a sauce with the breaded eggplant already in it.  \\n\\nThe service at this restaurant was beyond compare.

Huge glass doors open up the front of the restaurant for pseudo alfresco dining.  A modern and inviting atmosphere inside makes this a comfortable place for a date or dinner with friends.  The best thing? The food!  \\n\\nI went here last night for the first time and there wasn't a dish I did not like.  The tuna carpaccio was delicious it came with an olive oil gelato (very inventive!).  The frito misto was yummy although through the fried crispy layer I couldn't always tell what veggie I was eating.  The dipping sauce that came with the dish was tangy and delightful.  The beet salad was light and tasty.  The zuppa clams were cooked perfectly and came with a delicious flavorful broth.  The risotto was a little heavy but it was also the last dish we tried.  I thought the portion sizes were appropriate for \\"small plates\\", they were definitely a little bigger than tapas style which was a nice.  I think it is interesting when people complain about prices.  I know we are in a recession, but don't go out to dinner if you can't afford it.  If you want cheap food and big portions go to La Familia Giorgio, if you want well presented and flavorful dishes, come here. \\n\\nService:  I saw some reviews complaining about service but my direct experience was great.  Our server was super attentive and knowledgeable.  When asked she gave us good suggestions for wine and food.  \\n\\nNow for the critique: I mentioned the big glass doors?  It was probably only about 55 degrees last night and they had the doors wide open.  If you're going to open up the front of the restaurant you should be aware of the temperature.  It might be hot behind the stove, but I was definitely freezing!  Next, if you are going to have an open kitchen (which is great because you can smell the inviting aromas) you need to be mindful that your customers can hear you!  Our service was great but someone did bring over a dish that we didn't order.  I also over heard the chefs getting very frustrated with the staff: \\"I told you the risotto goes to table 3!! Why is it over on table 5?\\".  This was distracting and also alterted me to the fact that someone didn't know what they were doing.

We decided to drive over to Charles Street and take it from there.  I had eaten at Bin 26 twice before, so I knew that their entrees were about $22, and that the food was good.  WELL, I should mention, that I did not PAY the last time I went, and the time before that, I wasn't drinking.  \\n\\nI want to make something VERY clear.  I will pay just about anything for a good meal.  I appreciate great service, I love great food, and the last word anyone would ever use to describe me is \\"Cheap\\".  HOWEVER... I do not appreciate being Duped... and thats what Bin 26 Enoteca did.\\n\\nWhen we arrived, I simply asked for whatever their HOUSE Pino was.  My friend wanted to look at the menu.  My wine came in a very large glass, with a small carafe.  Looking back, I should have realized that it was a very large pour, but given that this is a place that prides themselves on their Wine Selection, I thought... ok, its their thing.. this makes sense.  My friend opened the wine list, and ordered a 9 dollar Sharaz... I asked her to check what mine cost and she said $8.50.  Her's came the same way.\\n\\nShe ordered an appetizer, I ordered a soup.  For Entrees, I had a Seafood Risotto, and she had chicken.  We ordered a second glass of wine with dinner.  After we were done eating, and I will point out that the food was very good, we decided to forgo desert, but wanted a third glass instead.\\n\\nWe really enjoyed ourselves, it had been a while since we sat and had dinner together, we were not rushed, our food was good, and the wine was tasty..... THEN we got the bill.\\n\\nOur meal was a whopping $190.00!!! WITHOUT an added gratuity!!  At first we were just going to pay and move on, but after thinking it through our wine hazed brains we called a waiter over and asked WTF was up!!  \\n\\nRemember those $9.00 glasses of wine... .WELL... if you look at the bottom of the menu in extremely small, cursive print, in a low lit restaurant... you would notice that the prices reflect 4 ounce servings... and unless you request otherwise, you will be served the large serving at DOUBLE the cost!!!  Our wine total was $110.00!!!  To say we were completely turned off would be an understatement.  I mean talk about trying to pull one over on your customers!! It REALLY pissed me off.  What pissed me off even MORE was when the Waiter acted as if we were trying to get out of paying... typical \\"Your on Beacon Hill, exactly what did you peasant girls expect\\" ----- I wanted to tell him \\"Go F@#$ YOURSELF.\\"\\n\\nIt gets worse.  They charged my AMEX twice!!! I called the next day and the manager told me \\"I was crazy.. they would NEVER make that mistake... things like that JUST DON'T HAPPEN here\\"  Right... and me and American Express are making this up.  After 10 minutes of my insisting that they charged me twice his response was \\"I can go downstairs and look in the computer, but I am 100% sure that this is not our fault.  What is your phone number.. actually, what is your E-mail address, thats a much easier way for me to deal with this\\"  \\nI gave the D-bag my information, but I never heard from him.\\n\\nI called AMEX an hour later, and the restaurant had issued a credit.  They recognized it was their mistake and issued a CREDIT!!!  Not only was I right, BUT, this guy couldn't even follow up with an apology??  Or even a quick \\"We made a mistake and have issued a credit\\"....\\n\\nThe saying goes \\"You can't buy Class\\", and at Bin 26 Enoteca, It certainly stands true.\\n\\n\\nDon't waste your time, go elsewhere..."},{"name":"Amaya's Taco Village","address":"5804 N Interstate 35","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Delicious food at fair prices.

They also charged us for extra rice and sides. To me, they should have put a sign or somewhere in the menu, that they will start charging for more at a specific limit, instead by letting us know with the bill. \\nThe restroom were also not really clean and the waiters were way to stressed and kept forgetting refilling our water and sides, so we sat at the table doing nothing for a while. \\nI guess it is worth the experience but I have been to better KBBQ Restaurants before."},{"name":"Clay's Sports Cafe","address":"6518 Roswell Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Great wings.

Sweet Auburn BBQ (SABBQ henceforth) is a nice alternative with a slightly shorter wait.\\n\\n1st star -- Relatively speedy line.\\n\\nIf you get to SABBQ early enough (11:45am or earlier), the line should be manageable.  When my coworkers set the Grindhouse train out late, I defer to SABBQ.  Be wary of people in scrubs from the nearby children's hospital.  They are usually picking up a metric sh*t ton of food, and they will clog the works.  But they're saving kids, so whatevs.\\n\\nThe easiest way to order is the $8.99 lunch special.  It includes a drink, 2 sides and your choice of chopped pork or chicken.  It could easily be eaten over 2 lunches, unless you're a pick like me.  Prep time is about 5-6 minutes.\\n\\n2nd star -- Nice portions for specials.\\n\\nAs I already noted, the portions for $9 are good.  You get several ounces of BBQ, and the two sides are plentiful.  They also include a piece of toast for sopping up BBQ sauce.  Slaw is also included.\\n\\n3rd star -- Decent BBQ.\\n\\nI'm nitpicky about BBQ.  I'm not a connoisseur, but my BBQ does have to be:\\n\\n1. Mostly meat -- Don't serve me chopped up fat with a smokey flavor.\\n2. Smokey -- If it's just sauce, then it's wrong.\\n3. Some crust -- Good BBQ has a crust on it -- seals in the juices.\\n4. Juicy -- Dry BBQ is awful BBQ.  There should be juices in the meats, dammit!\\n\\nSABBQ scores, on a scale of 1 - 10, with 10 being world's best BBQ, between a 6 and 7.  I've had both good and meh BBQ from SABBQ, hence the lower score.\\n\\nThis is acceptable for an urban BBQ shop that has to smoke the meat off site.  They bring in the BBQ from McDonough because they can't (yet) have a smoker on site.  I hope this changes soon, because when it's good, it's really good for the money.\\n\\nLost 4th star -- Please wear gloves with my food.\\n\\nLook -- Sweet Auburn Curb Market is already a little weird place in which to eat.  You can be sinking your teeth into a juicy burger one minute and then be examining the tripe-y innards of dead animals the next.\\n\\nLast time I was at SABBQ, I watched my meal put together without the standard plastic gloves.  I know it's a little OCD, but it sorta ruined the lunch it for me.  Even more annoying was coming back for more sauce 10 minutes later and seeing the same prep going on with gloves.  [sigh]\\n\\nLost 5th star -- Sometimes meh food quality.\\n\\nLast time I was there, I got BBQ that was a little cold.  The collards were also mushy -- like they'd been sitting a little while.  Made me worry that they were prepped a little too far in advance.  I enjoyed the meal, but I liked my first outing better.\\n\\nI'll be back to SABBQ, don't get me wrong, but I'm not ruling out Grindhouse if the line's short.  So, come on SABBQ -- be consistent, and give me an awesome BBQ alternative for my long walk to the curb market."},{"name":"The Four's Norwell","address":"285 Washington St","city":"Norwell","stars":"3","text":"Went to have lunch today.

A few minutes later, our server came back and proceeded to tear open the chimi, poke around with her fork, and show us that it was indeed chicken!  I know what I ate and I know that it was shrimp, whether it was inadvertently put there or not is irrelevant. There was no need to humiliate a first time customer (she knew this because she asked us earlier) by eviscerating their food in front of them and trying to prove them wrong.\\n\\nNow that I have that off my chest, we should move on to the food. The one shining star of the meal was the fried plantains and whatever the dipping sauce was. They were excellent. Second on the list was the chicken quesadilla which was plump and tasty. The \\"fusion chicken\\" sandwich was as my friend put it \\"just a chicken sandwich.\\" Nothing special going on here. The two kids meals were definitely not \\"made from scratch\\" as the waitress suggested all the food is.

The server didn't charge us for the chimi and the bill still came out to over sixty dollars (what?!). Sixty dollars for 3 adults and two children is, in my opinion, quite a stretch for a place like this. We didn't drink any alcohol and one person only had water.

I think they were busier than they anticipated and were \\nunderstaffed in the kitchen. Our miso and salads arrived fairly quickly, but our entrees were slow to appear and the gyoza showed up pretty late. Then it was a fairly long wait for my kid to get her green tea ice cream ( she wanted tempura bananas but they were out). \\n\\nThe table next to us asked if they did a birthday dessert and were told no because it was just too crazy of a night. So I did not even ask. Nor did we complain or question anything except once to remind the server about the gyoza just in case they forgot. She did tell us the chef took 10% off our bill, which was something. \\n\\nThe redeeming features here were 1) the food was flavorful and thoughtful ( the dipping sauce for my zaru soba had ice cubes in it so it would stay chilled). My kid commented that even her steamed rice was extra good.  Her salmon was tender and savory. And 2) our server was sweet and clearly coping with the timing of things was causing her concern. She also asked us if we were good with chopsticks which we are. It's nice to be offered a choice.  Also 3) the atmosphere is pretty with a school of metal fish on the wall  ( although the sticky laminated sushi menu on the table needed a good wipe or a clean replacement). \\n\\nWe would go back."},{"name":"Ahmed Indian Restaurant OBT","address":"11301 S Orange Blossom Trl, Ste 104","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"Took an hour and 10 minutes to bring the food for 6 people and when it came it was HORRIBLE.

The brisket at La Barbecue has ruined all other briskets for us for the foreseeable future, as we do not live in Texas.  That being said, while in town, husband and I tried plenty of other famous briskets--this was by far the best.\\n\\nAfter a fairly long flight, this place was our first destination stop, as I had been reading up on brisket and giant beef rib joints online and asking for local opinions from friends.\\n\\nI was seriously in the mood for a drink.  That day (and that week, for that matter) the temperature was 100+.  Luckily, La Barbecue is attached to the Quickie Pickie, which I expected to be your average convenience store--definitely not the case.  Although the restaurant is not affiliated, they use their space, and the QP has a vast array of wine, beer, and other libations to choose from.  I mean vast.  I chose a good quality bottle of rose and husband chose beer, and we sidled up to the counter to order.\\n\\nWe looked a little like aged aliens amongst mainly millennial hipsters, and ordering was just as awkward.  I knew the drill better than husband, so I ordered a pound and a half of brisket, in two separate orders, and a homemade jalape√±o sausage.  I asked for the house jalape√±o pickles and some onions on the side.  At first I was confused because it all came on one tray with butcher paper for both of us instead of separate plates, I'm such an idiot. The staff kindly, if a little incredulously, 'splained to us, we paid, and looked for seats.\\n\\nSeating consists of community long tables inside and picnic tables outside on the covered patio.  Despite the heat, we went outside after grabbing some sauce on the side.  It was pretty busy indoors.\\n\\nThe brisket was fabulous.  It blew our minds.  Amazing smoke, great crust, and most of all, meltingly fatty and moist, which for me is the point.  The raw white onion and lightly pickled jalape√±os were the perfect accompaniment.  Although tasty, the sauce was entirely unnecessary and we basically ate everything as is.  The homemade sausage was good, but a little chunky for me.\\n\\nAt the end of this meal we were both pi√±atas, but it was just awesome.

The salad was 3 slices of cheese, each about 3/8\\" plus 3 halves of a peeled cherry/pear tomato.  For that price, I would expect more cheese and some arugula and a boatload of tomatoes.

Have gone many, many times and never a bad experience or dish to report.\\n\\nA lot of the negative reviews seem to be due to either the size of the restaurant or their food not 100% adhering to the standards of classic \\"American\\" barbecue, as one would find in a classic Texas joint, so I figured I'd address these things:\\n\\nFirst off, it's definitely a small place. I think I recall 7 or 8 tables inside, and there's usually another couple out front when weather permits. Similarly, while I've obviously never been in their kitchen, they also seem to do smaller batches of barbecue to keep things fresh (you can actually see their meat smoker for yourself out front, to the left of their front door. It's not particularly gigantic, they're running a pretty small operation here). This in mind, yes there will be a wait during peak hours, and yes they will sometimes run out of menu items. I can't knock a small restaurant for running out of things occasionally--it means they're doing small batches, and often, so everything's fresh, instead of keeping a whole pile in the fridge for a week. It's a good thing! \\n\\nSecondly, I can't say I've been to Texas and had super-traditional barbecue. But I don't think it's fair to knock them for *not* being 100% traditional. I don't think they attempt to claim they are. This is the Pacific Northwest's take on barbecue. It might not be what you'd get in Texas, but it's absolutely phenomenal nonetheless. Like I mentioned, I've never had anything that wasn't fantastic here. The brisket is always butter-soft, and the last time I had ribs, they kept falling off the bone as I was trying to eat them. Really excellent. They've just added liquor and cocktails as well.

They say that you need more then 3 people, and need to have a minimum purchase of $9, and can only stay in there for a hour...I was only with one other person, purchased just 2 drinks which were about 6 dollars, and was there for 1.5 hours...so I don't think they strictly enforce it unless it's busy or there is someone signed up after you...Friday evening around 5:30, it wasn't busy.\\n\\nBombay chai latte is where it's at! They don't advertise the Bombay chai, but they have it. Their tea tastes far superior then Blenz and Starbucks, because Waves uses Harney and Sons (like Take 5 as well). Mmmmm...so stick to their tea latte's and you'll be just fine! It's called the \\"Bombay Fog\\" actually, if you don't specify they'll use yucky chai syrup! \\n\\nAnyways the ambiance of basically all Waves isn't close to being cozy...they should have really paid attention to that...the lighting and colours is way off...\\n\\n*The smoothies are not made from real fruit*"},{"name":"Salty Sow","address":"1917 Manor Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Eastside staple, great for a date night, super good happy hour, great patio, great service.

There were still a few people inside, and the lunch buffet was still being offered, so we were ready to eat.  There were many standard offerings, and not too many with chickpeas (which I was happy about); such as rice, chicken curry, saag paneer, tandoori chicken and some veggie curries. Naan was extremely limited, so we had to ask for more to be made. The pickings were slim as it was the end of the buffet, so can't complain about that.\\n\\nHowever, what my complaint is, is on the service and taste. The food was not earth shattering; it was typical Indian Buffet food. The food got cold very quickly, and when I asked the server if he could warm it up, he looked at me like I had 4 heads.

First of all, let me start off by saying that, being from New Mexico, I'm a total stickler for good Mexican food and it's really hard to come by in the Boston area. We went to Barrio on a whim hoping to find something more than a taqueria-- and we did! The menu is kind of small but certainly has some tasty things on there. Both the chicken cheese green enchiladas and the red beef enchiladas were great! I asked for the spiciest sauce they have and let me warn you, it's not to be messed with (and I ain't no gringa!)! Thats some seriously fiery stuff. Also, the chicken fajitas are very filling and super tasty. \\nSecondly, there assortment of margaritas is excellent and you can add a mini corona ($3 bucks more) to any of them which is just fun. I like the hot n skinny. \\n The place is never too packed which I think is a plus but it's still a good spot to go and right near Fenway. The bar was full when we went the last time but we easily got a table and visa versa the time before. \\nLastly, it's important to mention that the service was really great. Our server was attentive and really kind. Our bartender the time before was great too. Food runner, host, and everyone else who came near our table to all wore smiles and were all friendly.

For many years it's been a favorite restaurant. The winter greens salad and the carrot soup first courses were excellent, but the mains were, in the main, disappointing. I had the tortoloni with pork shoulder, and the pasta was dry and tough, as though it had been held under a heat lamp. My wife had the trout with cauliflower, and it was just so-so. All four of us ordered espressos, and they all came cold. This was the tipping point: when a restaurant can't be troubled to make a decent cup of coffee and serve it hot, it's a sure sign that someone is not paying attention to detail,which was our overall impression of the meal.

Nonetheless, the drink as delicious and the bartender provided great service.\\n\\nAfter the rest of our party arrived and we were seated, our orders were taken. All of the appetizers were ordered were delicious. The calamari was seasoned perfectly and wasn't overly breaded. For dinner, I ordered the enchiladas which were amazing.

It was crowded, but not packed. The bar definitely had a good amount of people at it, and the restaurant as a whole felt energetic. The restaurant is nice and spacious, has a lounge-y feel to it with lots of comfy looking couches and chairs, but is still very casual. We were offered a Valentine's Day shot upon arrival...but declined because, let's be real, I'm a #superlightweight.\\n\\nThey have a good menu with a lot of variety for people who are vegetarian, which is nice as I tend to veer in that direction sometimes. I was feeling some fish tacos though, so when I saw those I knew I was getting them. My companion had a hard time choosing between the tongue n cheek taco and the burrito, but went with the tacos. We also ordered a veggie and black bean quesadilla to share as an appetizer, as well as a shrimp and sweet potato tamale. He ordered a porter (they had run out of his first choice) and I ordered a Dark n'Stormy, which was incredibly boozy (not a bad thing!)\\n\\nThey brought us chips and salsa which, obviously, I would not say no to. Our tacos arrived before the quesadilla, and there were two tacos to each order. I don't want to say that the food was bad, as it was presented quite nicely and there was definitely thought into what went into (or on top of) each dish. However, the food was BLAND. How do you make Tex-Mex bland?? Is that even possible? I guess it is. #sadface\\n\\nIt's unfortunate that the food was bland, because their price point is really good for the Fenway area.

I was there during Spring Break of 2011. I had the Midnight Train (\\"four southern fried jumbo chicken wings and one original waffle\\") and the macaroni and cheese. The chicken wings were jumbo and delicious. They were crispy and reminded me of my mom's homemade fried chicken (hard to find fried chicken like my mother's). The meat was juicy and perfect. The waffle was the best I've tasted and it was so soft. The maple syrup they have is a great complement to the waffle. The mac and cheese is not the best I've tasted (the best I've tasted is here in NYC at the Blue Smoke). I have yet to find a better mac and cheese but Gladys and Ron's mac and cheese was good, nothing to write home about though. We ordered the Sweet Potato Cheesecake but I didn't get to taste it (I was too stuffed), but my husband told me it was delicious and he is picky about sweets. Parking is in the back of the restaurant (there are two parking lots on both sides of the restaurant but neither of those are the restaurant's parking lot; the one behind the restaurant is the parking lot). We waited for about twenty minutes before the host called our name, which I don't think was a very long wait and the weather was great. The waitress was very nice and very responsive to our needs.

I got the buffalo mac n cheese and hubs got some kind of panini which he said was alright. My meal was surprisingly delicious. I felt a little juvenile ordering mac n cheese but I didn't care and was glad I did! The garlic cheese sauce was awesome and with the melted mozzarella on top with buffalo chicken and some hot sauce splattered about, wow. It was intense. My husband had a few bites of mine as there was so much of it and he was definitely jealous of my meal. After a few bites we both were lightly sweating! The combo of the hot sauce and chicken and the garlic cheese sauce was a lot but soooooo good! Definitely not for the lactose intolerant. We took the rest home and that ended up being about half the plates worth.

Hamburgers were considered a separate food group. Everyone had his or her perfect burger recipe. You had to specify how you wanted it cooked...if you didn't, you might as well have said 'raw.' Now that burgers are suddenly a gourmet item in Austin, the pretenders and the contenders are sprouting everywhere.\\n\\nPreliminaries\\n\\nLocation: easy to find.\\n\\nParking: small , cramped, but no different than the rest of east Austin\\n\\nAtmosphere:  very similar to a highway rest stop with picnic tables...only covered.  Of course, it's 'east Austin' chic, so if you don't like looking around to see an electrical code violation in progress, refurbed crack house exterior, or rain dripping through the ceiling, don't go. YMBB is not advertising Truluck's atmosphere. The customer's were a good cross section of Austin: two gay guys discussing \\"pre-defined reality,\\" two Christian women discussing their next medical mission trip, and four IT guys trading tips on how to talk to women. What more could you ask? (Yes, I have spider man like hearing...) Again, if you have a problem with people different than you, don't go.\\n\\nAmbiance: local weed growers co-op annual burger cookout\\n\\nWaitstaff: somewhat absent minded. Very relaxed (see 'ambiance' above)\\n\\nPrice:  typical for Austin. $7.95 for a 1/2 lb burger.\\n\\nTime: The great news is that they cook burgers after they are ordered, not before. The bad news is that each table in the room received their food at a different time, except for my wife and I. Some people were nearly finished before their lunch companions got their burger. We waited 20 minutes for our burgers. If you don't want to sit and wait or you are in a hurry, go somewhere else. Or call in your order. We had no urgent plans, so waiting was not so bad.\\n\\nQuantity: sufficient unless you think that a basket of excellent, home made fries is not enough. If that's the case, go supersize your largeness elsewhere.\\n\\nQuality: \\n--Fries are great. Low salt.  Did not have the onion rings, but they looked fantastic. Everyone who did order onion rings did not appear to willing to share with those who did not. We had the Irish Nachos. Delicious. Not gourmet, just simple comfort food very well prepared.\\n\\n--Burgers (Marie Laveau and John D. Rockefeller): bland. Meat patty charred on the outside, cooked completely through. We didn't specify rare, medium, or well done. If you want a certain degree of cooking, let them know.  My Cajun grandmother often prepared Cajun style burgers. Hers are full of flavor. The burgers were so bland that I had difficulty discerning which one was which.  We each took home half of our burger, as we were full from the delicious Irish nachos.\\n\\nLater, my long time friend from west Texas came over dinner. I asked him to smell the burgers and tell me what came to mind. He sniffed. He couldn't place it. I offered \\"Dairy Queen?\\" He nodded, knowingly, remembering those Hunger Busters from days gone by. Sadly, these burgers were identical in taste to Dairy  Queen.\\n\\nGo for the Sides or the other menu offerings. If you want an $8 burger, at least go to Huts on Two For One night."},{"name":"Subway","address":"1576 W 5th Ave","city":"Columbus","stars":"3","text":"This is my favorite Subway in town.

The first comes from TILT, a small local chain featuring handcrafted food with an emphasis on burgers and sandwiches. We visited with some friends who highly recommended this for our first meal of the trip.\\n\\nInside TILT the feeling is very industrial, and there are even pieces of old manufacturing equipment that the space is built around. The layout is cafeteria style with long counters where orders are placed, quick assembled, and picked up at the end. Draft beer and classic cocktails are also available for ordering at the same time, or there are a couple of bars where drink orders can be placed.\\n\\nThis is a no-frills kind of place, with a tagline of handcrafted food and drink built for the American workforce. They also claim to be blue-collar inspired and feature shop towels rather than paper napkins. Meals are served on metal trays and silverware is minimal.\\n\\nMy wife went with freebird sandwich featuring a southern fried chicken breast, bacon, Swiss, jalapeno slaw, and bacon honey mustard ($9). She also added an order of their original handcrafted cheddar tots (6 pieces for $4). I stole a few bites of each and her sandwich choice was excellent, as were the tots. I think this would be my go to order if I lived in the area. The sandwich was a bit spicy, but the honey mustard and bacon flavors helped to tame it down a bit.\\n\\nI went with the non-union club featuring a grilled chicken breast, sweet ham, bacon, Swiss, avocado, lettuce, tomato, onions, and mayo ($10). This sandwich was massive! And while I enjoyed it I thought the freebird was a better choice. Perhaps the mayo needed a little something extra in it to really make this one shine.

But maybe it's how they are supposed to be being it's so busy?

So much that even though I no longer live close to hear, whenever I am in the area, I go out of my way to come and get a latte. The espresso is rich and the milk is perfectly foamy and delicious! On weekdays, it was also the perfect place to work - not too quiet, or too loud, with unlimited and free wifi, and the decor was simple but elegant. \\n\\nHowever, on weekends, this place becomes chaotic and unpleasant. Steveston naturally becomes a hub on weekends, but I do think that this business needs to do something to match the volume of people. Perhaps limit the number of hours of internet to minimize the number of people taking up tables for the entire afternoon. \\n\\nThe main concern is the staff. As soon as the staff has to make more than one or two drinks, it becomes overwhelming (and I've seen this many, many occasions), and the staff forgets orders, and everything is incredibly slow. For example, yesterday I ordered my latte right after 3 people had ordered in front of me, so as far as I know, I was the 4th drink up. It took 20 minutes for me to receive my latte! It seemed incredibly slow, especially since it was one person making drinks (at a leisurely pace), while two people sort of stood around.\\n\\nOverall, I think this is a great business and location and amazing coffee, but perhaps a more rigorous training of the staff needs to be done to accommodate the weekend traffic!"},{"name":"Denny's","address":"622 SW Marine Dr","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"Never had any problems when I go here.

My friend went with the short stack of pancakes as well as the side of grits as well as bacon (the pork kind). Lately, I have been into benedicts, so I ordered that with a few modifications. I'm not a fan of pimento cheese so I went with cheddar instead, in fact I went with extra cheddar. I also swapped out the turkey bacon for a regular pork bacon. I ordered a soy chai latte as well. The food did take quite a while to come out erring on the side of 15 minutes, which I would expect because the restaurant was so empty. But when the food did arrive it was absolutely amazing the Benedict had the perfect flavor hollandaise sauce was great egg was poached perfectly and the biscuit at the bottom was to die for! My friend said her pancakes were good although I don't agree with her decision to omit the butter from the pancakes. I've eaten a lot of grits and my day, cheese grits, sweet grits, even spicy garlic grits. And these have to be my top five; on their menu it says it they are their famous creamy dreamy grits and they were not lying. My soy chai latte, for whatever reason came out after the food.

The servers were really really nice. Sometimes they forgot small things but I just didn't bother asking twice because they were so nice. The booths are worn and the leather is torn but I kind of like that. However, I give the food 3 stars. This restaurant is about quantity. The food comes in huge proportions but tasted just OK. To be picky: the food tastes fairly healthy but is bland. It felt like the restaurant was trying to cut corners. I would rather have really flavorful food in much smaller portions. Where I thought they cut corners- I noticed a lack of real cheese and fresh tomatoes, cilantro, lime juice in the food. The guacamole was good. The only real cheese was on the refried beans. There was very little cheese in the burritos or the chimichangas, just this **runny/thin white sauce** on top. It tasted like a white sauce with a tiny bit of cheese in it. I would have preferred a red sauce and/or real cheese. They do give a lot of meat (chicken, beef) but again, it didn't have a lot of flavor. It is definitely mass-produced tasting meat. The salsa that came with the chips had a slightly bitter taste, not enough flavor or bite and didn't have chunks of fresh tomatoes. Also the hot sauce at the table was a brand I have never seen and has food coloring in it; I think it would be better to go with Cholula or some other brand which doesn't have food coloring and tastes better. The Mexican rice also could have had more tomatoes and spices mixed into it. I think if they made smaller portions (cut down to 1/3 of what they serve now), used higher quality ingredients, and added more flavor, this restaurant could be fantastic. Also the plates come out scorching hot. I think this is good because I like my food really hot but dangerous. For Ohio, it is a pretty good Mexican restaurant but for some other state like California, it would be below average in taste (only)."},{"name":"Hunan House Chinese Restaurant","address":"2350 E Dublin Granville Rd","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"The wife and I used to eat here occasionally until I was transferred out of the area in 2001 and always enjoyed the food.

By that I don't mean to imply there's only one \\"right\\" recipe for whatever which dish I've ordered.

There are eggs involved (lots of eggs), and bacon (lots of bacon) and pancakes and bacon and fried potatoes and eggs and suchlike. Nobody sane will argue this is a low-calorie, low-fat menu. But that's no excuse for the all-too-common _excessive_ grease or oil that so often yuckifies diner food, an important point the Red Wagon people obviously understand. Yes, the potatoes are fried. Yes, the bacon is, erm, bacon. But it's all done carefully and correctly so I get to taste the food I ordered, not the griddle it was cooked on. Last time I was in, I ordered a traditional eggs benedict (i.e., with back bacon) and had 'em add some white cheddar cheese to it. This they did cheerfully, and was it ever good! I was smiling about it all day long. Not walking distance from me, but worth getting in the car for.

The Burgers are great, the salads are usually good, the egg dishes are all good except for the Benny's.  Avoid them if you anticipate anything approaching the experience of a properly prepared Eggs Benedict with Hollandaise.  Denny's uses some sort of powdered hollandaise-esque stuff that is crap.

Based on the name, I had high hopes that this would be East Coast/NY style Italian. Like many of the reviews, our meal was hit and miss. \\n\\nCame here on a Sunday night and the restaurant was at about 30% capacity. The dining room is spacious with several large curved and cushioned booths, wood tables and chairs for parties of four or more, and high tables with bar stool height chairs. Since all of the cushioned booths were taken, we opted for the bar height table. \\n\\nService was attentive, friendly, specials were described in detail, questions answered, service fast. No complaints here at all.\\n\\nMy friend ordered the pesto pasta with chicken and it was delicious. A definite 5 stars. Cavatelli shaped pasta cooked perfectly al dente, chicken was moist and tender, pesto sauce bright and flavorful. Immediately I had buyers envy and wished I had ordered the same dish. \\n\\nHaving seen veal parmigian with linguini on the menu, something you can find at every Italian restaurant and pizzeria in NJ/NY/Boston, but rarely can find in Portland, I immediately chose veal parm for my dinner without hesitation. And I was excited. Unfortunately the meal was barely a 2 star dish. \\n\\nFirst, the linguini which I think was fresh, was so over cooked it had a mushy consistency. What a disappointment. The sauce was all wrong. Liquidy with chunks of what seemed like sun dried tomatoes rather than a rich, thick tomato sauce. \\n\\nNow to what should have been the star of the meal, the veal. The veal was sliced super thin, deep fried and so over cooked it had a tough consistency and no flavor. What a shame! Veal is an expensive cut of meat and needs to be treated with, cooked with, respect. Cut thin, pounded flat, dipped in egg and breadcrumbs, and fried gently in a pan. Cooked properly, it melts in your mouth. \\n\\nWas hoping Brooklyn Trattatoria would become a go-to place for HH or dinner when visiting a friend of mine who just moved to Bethany. Even though she lucked out with the pasta pesto dish, not sure I want to take another chance of blowing money on a less than mediocre meal. It pains me to write this.

Honestly, I don't think most people reading reviews for Chipotle on Yelp are looking to see whether or not the Chipotle food and concept are good. You either love it or you don't. What people, I imagine, are interested in however is how this specific Chipotle compares to the average Chipotle. So that's what I'm reviewing.\\n\\nThe food tastes just as good as any other Chipotle..mmm delicious! I usually get the burrito bowl and I think the burrito bowl is usually made well. I always get large portions of rice, beans, and meat and lately I've taken to ordering double meat so that the bowl makes two meals. The burrito, on the other hand, can sometimes be a mess. When my boyfriend gets a burrito he always gets less rice and meat than he normally gets at other Chipotle branches. His burrito is sometimes messily wrapped as well, leaving tears in the tortilla. \\n\\nOverall a great Chipotle branch if you're getting a burrito bowl but not so good if you want a burrito.

The Spring Frittata was perfection- delicate earthy flavors brought together with creamy feta- so great. After breakfast we had breakfast dessert-- a coffee float! The coffee is a bottled coffee flavored soda from Italy. The carbonation is a perfect match to the smooth creamy vanilla- I was definitely in coffee bliss. I recommend all you coffee lovers out there to give the coffee float a try! My friend tried the single speed (a great incentive to drink alcohol in the morning) which was a very well balanced hard-coffee drink. Both the food and drink, needless to say, exceeded my expectations.\\nOther Notes: The wait was pretty long- 2 hours- but well worth it!

I really wasn't expecting much for the price, and it sounded like a great deal.\\n\\nI wasn't going to complain about the food, because it is afterall, buffet food. I was pretty content with the tandoori chicken, but the chicken tikka and chicken jalfrazee were probably best left off the buffet menu. I found neither appetizing, and since I love naan and some sort of curry together I was forced to eat it. The naan was good, the chicken tikka wasn't horrible, but it wasn't great. However, the chicken jalfrazee was plain bad. I didn't even bother getting it twice. The other stuff I felt obligated to get more of simply because I wanted to get my moneys worth. Rice was definitely stale, and the raita was a little too sour for me.\\n\\nThe highlight of the whole thing was when our server tried telling us he couldn't take our \\"Groupons\\". First his excuse was that we didn't tell him before we came, but to our defense there were no stipulations on the Groupon itself. Then he told us he will only do 1 per table, which again, not on the Groupon. After some hard deliberation by himself, he came back and agreed to accept our Groupons. We only had 3, and were a small party, I don't think it should have been that big of an issue, but it was. Worse than anything was the service. I hate to rate a place on service, because if my taste buds are tickled, I don't care if I am treated like the Shah of India, but we also saw our server giving another party some trouble that I'd rather not get into.\\n\\nGet rid of the server, and its still maybe a 3-stars at most."},{"name":"PRESSED","address":"120 Charles St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"The ZINC, y'all.\\n\\nCucumber, apple, lime, mint, kale and wheatgrass, presumably set to load your temple with copious amounts of Zn and other riboflavo-antiradicaliciousness.

As a whole package, nothing beats the warm glow of Mamma Maria.\\n\\nI had been there 10 years ago, and all I remembered about it was that I really liked it. I was skeptical about going again recently because some have said it's gone down hill. I think anyone can have a bad experience at the best of restaurants.

There were only two disappointments: we had requested a window table when making the reservation and didn't get it, and the dessert was typical North End sub-par.\\n\\nBoth my friend and I started with the Ribollita, which was thick like stew with root vegetables and bread, and Italian seasoning. Yum. And filling. Vegetarians beware: there was one small piece of ham in each of our dishes, and maybe a meat broth. I avoided the ham bit and played blissfully ignorant.\\n\\nFor entrees I had the mushroom ravioli which was sublime and had so many interesting varieties of mushrooms I didn't recognize most. My friend had the famed Osso Bucco (the veal was free-range according to the chef). It looked fantastic, slid off the bone, and melted in the mouth (according to carnivorous friend). \\n\\nFor dessert I had flourless chocolate cake with mint gelato. The cake was actually bad, with the taste and texture of cocoa powder. (I'd had the same thing at Prezza, but at least there was a molten reward in the center.) My friend had the fried sweet coconut bread with coconut gelato and chocolate glace. How could it not be great? I don't know, but it wasn't. Just okay.\\n\\nThe service was great. The waiter was just slightly over talkative. The atmosphere was great: warm, nice views, romantic, cozy. It felt elegant and homey at the same time.

The maitre d' hesitated, but said okay, which seemed weird. Turns out they were using the bar as a prep room where they trayed the orders before taking them out.

Even worse, it was ground beef instead of the typical slices of meat, making it more like a chopped up bulgogi burger.

The service was super, even if it did take quite a while between courses (I forgive; there were like 14 of us, and I know that can be hard to get up at once).  We started off with the seared scallop, which YUM.  Serving it with spaghetti squash rather than pasta was a fun twist for an Italian joint.  We moved on to these lovely towers of appetizers.  Seafood on the bottom (tuna tartare, oysters, calamari, cod cakes), meat on the second level (sopresata, pancetta, beef tartare, pork loin), and veggies on top (beans, eggplant, arancini, mozzarella di bufala, and an Italian bread salad with tomatoes, capers and olives).

Never think about where your food comes from just before trying to eat it folks.

This is my second time eating at this restaurant, the first was two years ago. When I first moved to Atlanta I was invited for a birthday dinner and that experience was fairly mediocre. The food was less a little less than I expected so I made a mental note that this would not be a place that I would frequent often. Fast forward two years and my in-laws were in town. Supposedly, they were to meet 3 of their friends for lunch but showed up sometime after them. As there were 5 of them, the smaller booths could only hold a max of 2 individuals on each side so the parties could not sit together. No you can not pull up a chair, no you can not wait to be seated at a larger table unless you want to wait another hour and a half and no there are no exceptions. As my in-laws were forced to sit at a separate table than the party they were supposed to dine with, my in-laws proceeded to invite my sister, grandmother, and I to come join their half empty table. They did not realize that we would face the same dilemma all over again, as there would be 5 of us once again. When we arrived the manager asked my sister to take off her hat. No big deal, I completely understand there are certain rules and regulations at dining establishments... but have fun telling that to an 18 year old teenage girl. Anyway, we proceeded to squeeze at the little booth my in-laws were eating at, reading our menus. Literally, no exaggeration, two minutes after I was handed a menu and water the waitress comes over to take our order. I said, \\"Oh, I am not ready yet\\". She proceeded to tell me that she was instructed by her manager to immediately take our order anyway. Again, I told her I didn't get a chance to even look at the menu fully so she proceeds to cite off the entire menu as I SLOWLY continue searching for something that looks appetizing. When she is done, I silently continue scanning the menu and make her wait some seconds before I tell her what I want. Lunch continues with everyone at the table discussing how many places in Atlanta lack adequate customer service, no matter how prestigious or famous the restaurant/company. After this incident, the waitress' attitude took a 360 and I felt that she was trying to overcompensate for her (AND THE MANAGERS) nasty attitude. I can say that I will not be bullied at an establishment that I am PAYING to eat at. If you do not know the bougie ways of Gladys Knights Signature Chicken and Waffles, beware. There are many many many other awesome restaurants to eat at in Atlanta where you can experience the view of a skyline, eat with your entire party at a full-sized table, and even have drinks while you wait. Glady's is NOT the place to have an overall great experience. Do your research.\\n\\n**The second star is for the first time I ate at the restaurant 2 years ago.

I had the crispy green beans, fried quail legs, and pigs-in-a-blanket. The best dish was the crispy green beans! It was nicely fried with a light batter and perfectly salted. The aioli was also kickin! I definitely recommend this.\\n\\nHowever, the quail legs and pigs in a blanket were disappointing. I feel like the quail legs were overcooked and didn't really have any flavor. It came with with wing sauce on the side for dipping but that didn't really help. There was also a slice of cheese on the side. The fried quail legs was an attempt by Contigo at a unique spin to hot wings. I think I would have just preferred traditional wings.

First and foremost, Jackie the bartender was an amazing individual who took care of everyone, including us.  Unfortunately, there was a function of 55 people in the other room. After our first martini we order a bottle of wine, took a little bit for our artichoke appetizer and a salad. Needless to say, The artichoke was awesome and the salad was okay. Now, waiting for a meal, sitting at the bar, almost done with our bottle of wine, we witnessed three takeout orders given for free for the wait. Jackie, who again I have nothing but great words to say about her, kept going out back to find out where the food was. Now the food comes, the Paella that my sister ordered all the shells on the clams and mussels were closed in the risotto was cold. I had a craving for eggplant parmigiana and paid the two extra dollars for the only fresh pasta which is fusilli that was over cooked. I didn't even get to touch it! The portion size was so small it wasn't even enough for the two of us to share, after sending back my sisters meal. This gentleman who is working in the kitchen, to whom I have no idea who he was, was the one giving the free food away to the takeout orders. He approached us questioning us about my sister dinner in the mitts of my sister speaking and indicating the seafood was under-cooked and the risotto was cold, he turns and walks away. A young gentleman who stated he was the owners nephew (Vincenzo) gave us his business card and told us not to talk to that guy because he didn't know what he is talking about.  As I told the other guy to go away, I was embarrassed to find out it was the owner! Who does that to a customer!!!  As we asked for the check, we had two martinis one appetizers and one salad, a bottle of wine AND the check was just under $100.   Of course none of this was Jackie's fault, so we left her generous tip.

Bark. Bark. Bark! BARK! OMG the BARK! Seriously, that bark tho. I've had brisket and ribs before, but never as succulent, flavorful, and satisfying as what I've had at la. I actually get really annoyed now when people tell me that they've had the best BBQ ever in [insert some stupid place] and its some place outside of Texas (or Memphis, the Carolinas, etc.): \\"Shut your stupid, uncultured, ignorant mouth, you dumb face, no you haven't had the best BBQ in [insert some stupid place].\\" This isn't to suggest that there can't be better BBQ than la, because there most certainly is. It's just not from your dumb state. Like Oklahoma. Stupid, no-good-BBQ-havin' Oklahoma.\\n\\nWe only got the meat (to go; ordered in advance). No sides (apparently they suck).

The prices can be... \\"Oh geez.\\" The brisket is what, $20/lb? Cheap? Nope. Worth it? Yeah, I'd say so.

I only wanted one...\\" But even with one rib, you're looking at prices like $36, which is... I mean, what even? I wanna be offended, but then the beef rib is so good, and I'm really happy upon first bite. Then a sadness sets in that a beef rib of all things brought me such satisfaction. Then I start thinking, \\"Will there be beef ribs in heaven?\\" Then I remember that it's ~$36 for a beef rib, and I'm back to \\"WTH, la?\\" The beef brisket also leaves me filled, both physically and emotionally to such an extent that I'm genuinely concerned that food can have such an impact on my overall state of mind... \\n\\nGo now, fatty fatty boombalatty."},{"name":"Salty Sow","address":"1917 Manor Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I finally made my way to the Salty Sow to experience all the good Yelp reviews.

I should have asked for a 3rd because I inhaled these and was immediately filled with greedy regret.  Did I get back in line?  Hell yes I did, but I waited till everyone got a first helping first.  See, I am nice.  Next round, I tried the szechuan veggie taco, which was surprisingly yummy, spicy, and savory.  Of course, I got another pork belly slider too.

You start right away with a cup of water - pretty basic tap and no ice :(. Once the menu arrives, wow there are so many options. I had trouble narrowing it down between options but there are so many options on the sweet and savory spectrum. I ultimately decided on a southern Benedict, fried avocado, and orange juice. The food arrived about 10 minutes after we ordered (+1 for short wait once again!). Although, it may have been for a reason...The biscuits on the Benedict tasted a bit like raw batter, clearly undercooked. Luckily, the poached egg hid the taste really well and was cooked perfectly. Now the ugly--as a former vegetarian, I've had my fair share of plant-based chicken. The \\"chicken\\" from the Benedict was one of the worst I've tried; very chewy and flavorless. I'd also advise against the home fries if you're not fond of turmeric. My fried avocado was delicious and interesting (definitely recommend, but it is filling!). Another minor complaint is the serving of orange juice I received which was pretty small for its price (luckily, there's free refills on warm tap water).

My boyfriend ordered the Basil Chicken which he ordered extra spicy as well and though the ingredients were fresh it lacked flavor and again Spiciness.

The hostess introduced us to our server (who had a trainee with him), and they asked us for drink orders. About five minutes later, we were asked if we had any questions about the menu. I asked if the risotto was vegetarian, and the server went to the kitchen to check. He then came back a few minutes later to tell me that it was indeed vegetarian, but then left. Around ten minutes later, we were finally asked for our orders. My friend ordered the classic lasagne and I got their seasonal risotto (it was pine nut and fennel).\\n\\nThe trainee then came around with bread, and they served us one small slice of bread per person along with a small cup of butter, rather than giving us a basket or serving the single slices of bread with our entrees. This was a little strange, but the bread didn't taste awful.\\n\\nWe got our entrees in a timely manner, and they were both delicious. By the time we finished, it was 7:00 pm, and they asked us if we wanted dessert. Both of us love tiramisu, so we immediately said we wanted one. They said they'd get it for us and then they took our plates and left. Then, they came back a few minutes later to tell us they were out of the tiramisu. Usually this would be fine, but the restaurant was still going to be open for almost two hours more, so it was confusing that they'd already be out of a pretty popular dessert. Our servers offered us the cannoli instead, which we took. We got two cannoli on our plate, which it had a dulce de leche drizzle. The cannoli themselves were drizzled in what seemed to be raw honey, which tasted rather odd.\\n\\nBetween receiving our dessert and receiving our check, we were asked how we were doing about four times (twice by our servers, once by the hostess and once by the owner himself, who was welcoming everybody as this restaurant is pretty new). We appreciated the owner talking to us, but we also wanted to get our check so we could take care of payment. That took an absurd amount of time, and we got out at least twenty minutes after we'd gotten our dessert.\\n\\nOverall, the food was delicious (especially the risotto), but the service was a little rocky, perhaps because one of our servers was a trainee.

Each cake is about standard sized of 2.5\\" L x 1.5 W x 2.5\\" H.  \\n\\nNow, I had the caramel mousse thing first, and it's a really great cake!  I actually can't think of anything better other than Azuki Cream Puff (Japonaise) within US.  It's not too sweet, and tastes delicious!  The cake itself is pretty weighty too, with a good strong ... interior(?).  There's some kind of nut on top that gave it a good crunch, and I liked it too.\\n\\nAfter the caramel mousee thing, I immediately started on the mango thing (yes, I'm a pig).  That might have been a mistake, because I didn't much enjoy the mango cake!  Actually, it wasn't the mango cake that sucked, it was the bitter chocolate flakes on top.  Perhaps my sweet taste buds were over saturated or something, but the only thing I could taste was the bitterness!  I understand that there are some bitter chocolates out there - but it really didn't go with the rest of the mango thing.  \\n\\nIf the fine patisserie over at Aroa read this, change that weird chocolate on top of the mango thing (+1 star) and reduce the price for the cakes by a buck (+1 star) and I'd have a perfect place to go for dessert and coffee!  I know the word \\"fine\\" in the name requires you to be expensive... but still, 3.99 for a cake that I can fit entirely into my mouth with one bite?

They specialize in Oaxacan style cuisine, robust and bold flavors with proper uses of various chiles. Situated half way down Rainey St., the quaint, classic interior provides a clean atmosphere for food that is alive with delicious flavors. \\n\\nWe started our meal with the ceviche of the week (Ceviche de la Semana), which was a tuna ceviche, served with hot, house made tortilla chips. I highly recommend this app. I think it was a perfect way to start a meal that packs a punch to the taste buds. \\n\\nFor cocktails they have a variety of Hispanic classics, with a little twist. I had the Mezcali√±a - Mezcal, muddled seranos (gives it quite the kick), basil (fresh), agave, lime and pineapple juice, rimmed with jalapeno salt. My wife had a Jamaica Sour - pisco capel, rum, lime juice, simple syrup, and hibiscus, fresh and tropical.\\n\\nBefore our entrees arrived our server brought out some house made mini cibatas and 3 different salsas and a butter to try. The traditional tomatillo salsa and the roasted red pepper salsa were some of the best of their variety that I've ever experienced. They even sell them by the jar. A stocking stuffer or small local Austin gift we may have to go back for.\\n\\nFor entrees they have a variety of Moles, Chiles Rellenos, Fish, and Meat dishes. There is a mole of the week (Mole de la Semana). We went with the Mole Amarillo, the mole special of the day, which wasn't made with an almond base like most moles. We had the choice of either shrimp, duck, or chicken. The broth was fantastic, with a very roasted red pepper flavor that wasn't so spicy that you weren't able to taste the rest of the food. It was served with either arroz blanco or verde, a rice made with serano broth. The rice was again, awesome, and was a great compliment to the mole sauce.\\n\\nThe 2nd entree we had was the Cochinita Pibil, served with fresh tortillas, pickled onions, and black beans. This is by far the best Cochinita Pibil I've ever had. I'm not typically a fan of overly plantain tasting Cochinita Pibils and thought this one was subtle enough with a nice achiote flavor.\\n\\nWe had a choice to end our meal with either a chocolate tart or tres leches. The tres leches made me a believer that tres leches are good. Not typically a fan, but the bread was not overly soggy and had a perfect balance of the three creams and sweetness.\\n\\nService was attentive and knowledgeable.

I recently went here with some clients who were in town and everyone LOVED their meals. I'd definitely recommend a reservation since it was packed! \\n\\nWe started out with the deviled eggs and they were so creamy & delicious. The filling is super rich but yet light. I don't know how they do it but the filling was practically like an egg yolk whipped mousse. Everyone enjoyed these. We also ate the Charcuterie & Cheese board. This was a nice plate to share. There was salumi, smoked salmon, smoked turkey breast, chicken liver mousse and pate. In addition to the meat selection, there were two cheeses and some pickled vegetables with bread. \\n\\nFor entrees, I got the bone-in filet. It was cooked perfectly medium rare and melted in my mouth. The mushroom gravy with the meat was fantastic. This was a great steak. My guests got the pork special and beef shoulder (served in a pot! very cute) For sides we got the smashed potatoes (they were just alright, nothing special, wished we got the mashed potatoes instead), fried brussel sprouts and the cauliflower & wild rice. \\nThe brussel sprouts were so tasty with nice sweet & salty element with some golden raisins shaved in. I'd really recommend this. The cauliflower was also very nice, like a gratin with a very savory cheese sauce. I couldn't quite put my finger on it but it tasted like a very mild gorgonzola sauce. Overall it was delicious.\\n\\nLastly, for dessert we shared the butterscotch budino with caramel sauce. It was so good! Amazing dessert. I really like how the custard was not overly sweet but with the caramel and whipped cream, it was an excellent dessert with just the rest amount of sweetness. It was an excellent way to end the meal.\\n\\nThe only reason for the deduction in 1 star is due to the fact that the restaurant is really, really noisy and parking is a little crowded. If you are looking for a quiet, intimate dinner, you might want to consider somewhere else. It was hard to hear conversation across from me at the table unless my guests were practically yelling.

So I planned my for my birthday to be celebrated here, I had originally contacted Relish and told them that it was a party of 20. Once I got the confirmation back that it was reserved I sent out a Facebook invite. So most people either didn't RSVP or didn't respond until last minute, which is no fun.  The reservation went from 20 to 13 people because I still didn't know who was coming and wanted to make sure that there would be enough space. When the night finally arrived it ended up that only 7 of my very closest friends and family could make it, which was fine by me, I had a great time! I kinda felt bad for Relish because maybe they thought I would be bringing in tons of business, but I'm not really that popular lol. In the end it all worked out because when we got there the only spot that was reserved for us were two fairly small tables that could only probably fit 8 max. The Relish staff must have some sort of foresight ability, because I didn't tell them that there would only be 8 of us all together. I was expecting this huge table to be reserved LOL and thought they may be pissed when I arrived with only 8 people including myself.\\n\\nAnyways, the food was good and the service great, our waitress was very attentive and often came by our table to see how we were doing.

Contigo is in an odd setting -- around the corner from the main Airport Blvd. stretch, facing what once upon a time was Austin's flagship airport -- but it's an oasis in multiple facets, and one of the best places in town (regardless of area) to enjoy a relaxed evening out with friends, thanks to its massive patio area (though on the flip side, it's closed in the winter and only a tiny portion of it, near the main building, is plastic enclosed and warmed with space heaters).\\n\\nLike a rapidly increasing number of restaurants/bars around town, it has a drinks menu done up in full mixologist style, with ingredients you've probably never seen (unless you frequent mixology bars) such as velvet falernum and d'aristi xtabentun, along with a decent selection of draft beer (although nothing close to places like the Ginger Man or Hopfields). Small plates and charcuterie, most of the French or Italian variety, comprise most of the food menu, though if you want a full dinner they have that, too, with dishes like rabbit & dumplings on there alongside basics like burgers and fries. As is also the trend these days, Contigo uses locally sourced ingredients as much as possible, and as a result the menu can vary substantially depending on the season. I've tried most of the menu at this point and have yet to encounter anything that isn't fantastic.\\n\\nDownsides: Contigo is often a little *too* popular, and if there's a decent chance of rain most of the exterior tables are closed off; during my most recent visit, this resulted in an hour and forty-five minute wait for a table (to be fair, it was prime time on a Friday night). Also, the parking lot, while by no means small, nevertheless fills up on crowded evening, leaving one to park on the darkened surrounding street ... and while Contigo and Mueller may be yuppie meccas, the area surrounding Contigo (which is not in Mueller proper) remains one to be wary of at night."},{"name":"la Barbecue","address":"2027 E Cesar Chavez St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I've been back maybe 10 times.

Is it really necessary to capitalize the word \\"TEXAS\\" in the response (although, everything is bigger there lol)? Yelp is a place to write reviews based on your own experience, and apparently for this place, you're completely wrong if for some reason the food you've had elsewhere is better. I don't rely on Urban Spoon for menus, but I do have a picture of the cottage pie from Stag's Head in Houston. Should I upload it here to prove that I've eaten it? I don't care if they're a corporation or not; the fact is, it's a better cottage pie. Maybe I was supposed to have carrots and peas in mine, but they didn't exist, and I can only write based on my one-time experience. The scotch egg I ate at a pub in Columbus was also better than what I ate at this establishment. Should I lie and write 3 stars for this bar (A-OK) instead of 2 stars (Meh, I've experienced better)? \\n\\nWhy do I wish the scotch egg to be cut in half instead of fourths? There's a simple answer: surface area. With a scotch egg that small and cut up as little as it was, it gets colder. I did not bother nit picking every single issue I had during my visit because the staff just didn't seem interested. It took about 10 minutes after I sat at the bar before someone came to even offer a drink, despite there being less than 8 others in the whole entire place. \\n\\nI admit I probably am more traveled than most Yelpers. To give an idea of how much travel I do, I flew 8,387 miles during the first three weeks of this month, and it's actually been a slow month. Therefore, my experiences are going to be vastly different than someone (for example) who has never left Orlando.\\n\\nMy main concern is that if the manager's comments are like this, then what kind of tone does that set for staff? What kind of positive problem solving does this foster in such a service-based industry? Such a defensive response only deters improvement.

The latte is small and the coffee fine, although more was not offered (whatever, I could have asked).\\n\\nAs I mentioned, the menu is wonderful looking.  A few friends ordered more savory items (taco, slider, huevos racheros) and while I didn't taste them they were all entirely gone by the end of the meal.

I asked for my eggs scrambled.\\n\\n1. Eggs were scrambled soft - Yuck\\n2. Hash browns were \\"just\\" done. Thrown on the grill to get a little brown but obviously we're not turned and were super salty.\\n3. Fruit (not in the description) contained blue berries (can't eat them) \\n4. Bacon (1 slice) was cooked but one thick slice does not justify making it name-worthy\\n5. Server only checked on us once when we first got our food and never returned till it was time to pay the cheque. \\n\\nOverall, it was a poor experience. Tony Roma's changed their image to appease the \\"millennials\\" and in the process, alienated most anyone that just wants something tasty and uncomplicated.

Basically, you pay about the same amount per item as you'd pay at places just down the street, but you get a lot less food that's not quite as good (and so you have to order multiple dishes to make a full meal).  The concept of small plates so that you can sample lots of things is nice, but to make it work they need one of two things: 1.) Really good food, so you don't mind shelling out twice what you'd pay at a standard North End Italian place OR 2.) Lower prices so that you can try lots of different things for a reasonable price.  Without one of those two things, the concept just doesn't work. \\n\\nWe had short rib ravioli, which were well cooked but nothing special--the meat tasted good, but had no texture, and the sauce was a chef-boy-r-d consistency and flavor (not that there's anything wrong with that--it's just cheaper to buy it in the can).  The beef carpaccio was fine, but seemed to be trying a bit too hard with excessive truffle oil.  And the spicy alfredo dish with sausage and chicken was just ok.  \\n\\nI don't mind paying for a great meal, and I love food enough to enjoy even just a so-so meal.

Aside from the standard pies, offering interesting combinations that break away from your common simple Italian pizzas.  They also have seasonal pies which brings just that much more diversity.  \\n\\nLots of food, cheaper than other chains of its class its actually not half bad.  My only caveat being, in the city of Boston, with the renown Italian North End, that eating at Bertucci's is kind of silly with the plethora of Italian spots there.

I asked her the price of tempura and she said $3. I asked if I could get only veggie tempura, without shrimp or fish, and she said yes. Once the tempura came out it had two pieces of shrimp. I'd understand the mix up if it was busy, but it was me and my friend, and one other couple in the restaurant. other than that it was totally dead. Once she noticed it she said \\"well I hope your okay with shrimp cuz it's in the tempura.\\" I didn't even want to argue I was so frustrated. we then proceeded to wait 12 minutes for our check, we made signals by putting all of our plates together in stacks by color, and I got my purse and my friend grabbed his sunglasses and put them on, and we even stood up, but the girl was to busy spending her time talking with another server across the track to notice or care. when I got to the register (finally) an older woman rang me up, but after paying and leaving I did the math and realized I had been charged $5 for the tempura.

To be honest , I always believed Taco Bell or restaurants such as \\"On the Border\\" were the real Mexican food places. And that was the reason I disliked Mexican food, going by the standards of such crappy restaurants. I was so wrong. For one to taste the authentic, real-real Mexican food, one must go to a place where you can find majority of the people that represent that place that is Mexicans more in a Mexican restaurant. And \\"Tacos La Villa\\" is just that - A real Mexican place that serves authentic Mexican food and where you can find majority of the customers, Mexicans.\\n\\nThis restaurant was a accidental find for me. Although it was within half mile from where I lived, I never really cared to even look at it, least go and eat there. But one fortunate day, in a zeal to try something different, I stopped here and I was blown away by the food. Where in the world I was living to not have been introduced to such real Mexican food before. After I tasted the food here, this became my favorite place to go for a long time. Only from this restaurant did I know, how to identify a real Mexican restaurant from others. A fresh salsa bar, hot and spicy food and cheaper prices, that is a sign that you are in a real Mexican place. This restaurant serves best salsas and fresh marinated sides( carrots, garlic in vinegar) that are crunchy and flavorful. The quesadillas are awesome and so are the enchiladas, burritos and tacos. Nothing in this place will disappoint you. I have not eaten in any other \\"so called\\" Mexican places like \\"Taco Bell\\" or \\"On the Border\\" after this.

One who has never tasted real Mexican food gets easily fooled by such chains to believe it to be real Mexican.\\n\\nI moved out of Smyrna after some years, to Cumming, but Tacos La Villa remains my most favorite restaurant till date and if I have to visit Smyrna any time, I make sure to stop here for a lunch."},{"name":"HML Seafood Restaurant","address":"5890 No 3 Rd, Ste 200","city":"Richmond","stars":"2.5","text":"Been a long time I haven't had their food.

This was the case here.  This place was on my long list of places to go and get BBQ.  This place has a whole lot of good reviews, so of course my interest was raised.  I didn't know much about this place, just from the reviews.  So I (we) took a visit to this place on a Saturday around noon.  Once we arrived at the restaurant, there was a line that zigzag outside and down the front-side of the restaurant.  The line really didn't bother me, it just reinforce the notion that we arrived at a really good BBQ establishment.  Once we got in line we then noticed that the line also wrapped along the inside of the restaurant.  Not a problem at this point.  We were being occupied by conversations in the line,  a lot of people came to Austin this weekend for either meet with friends or picked Austin to host their bachelor party.  So it was the first for a lot of in line to visit this place.  While in line, the place sold out of their chipotle (spicy) sausage and then later the beef ribs.  I was really looking forward to the beef ribs. It took about 2.5 hours to get inside the restaurant.  Once I got inside the restaurant, it was apparent on why it was taking a long time to get served.  They only had one person slicing the meat while your order was taken!  The building was being occupied by 2 business (la Barbecue & Grocery store).  The counter has 2 cashiers, 1 for la Barbecue and the other for the store. and at the right end of the counter was consumed by the beverage portion of the business.  So by the time I finally got my order and sat down, it was 3 hours since I got in line.  People spirit was still good, but there was a lot of jesters by people in line and even after getting their orders. like $500 for the first bid on my order to the ones still in line.\\n\\nSo when I finally got to sit down, 3 hours later, with my order. The barbeque was very excellent!  The brisket was lean, tender and very tasty.  The pork ribs were exactly the same. The turkey was very juicy and tender, really loved the turkey.  Their regular sausage was great, just the right portion of meat, fat, and cereal.  None of the meats need any barbeque sauce, they will satisfy any palette on their own!\\n\\nSo would I go back?  Great question.  I'm not sure.

The cup might as well have been a bowl, it was so large.  The soup was spicy and delicious. Ive had better H&S soup (at Four Seasons Chinese on Bratton) which was sour the way it should be, but this was still delicious.\\n\\nThe Roast Duck with sauce was interesting.  And by interesting, I mean terrible. I didn't see it on the menu. But there were so many yelpers proclaiming it the best dish on the menu, I decided to try it. It was garnished with cilantro on the side which was very wilted. Without the sauce, the duck was chewy and over cooked.  The batter was hard to chew. It seemed as if the duck had been frozen, then roasted, then deep fried.  If dunked in the accompanying sauce, it was semi-edible.   The duck itself seemed fatty and had a strange taste to it. Like licking a stray animal (not that I've ever done that).  I will not order it again.  The rave reviews for it seem suspicious.  I removed the garnish and batter, and gave the duck meat to my dog.  She actually seemed to like it.  \\n\\nThe Bean Curd with Crab was surprisingly delicious.  It came with crab, shrimp, and egg.   It tasted a little like egg drop soup, which I didn't mind.  It did Not taste fishy like spoiled seafood.  Overall, good dish. I would order it again if I was hungry for an extra large helping of egg drop soup. But it will not be my first choice on the menu, even on a drunk night. \\n\\nThe Mapo Tofu was very spiced. I've never had it from any restaurant before.  I couldn't tell if that was ground beef or ground pork.  It had a kick to it, and the flavors were pungent and not delicious at the same time- although still more edible than the duck. I won't order it again either.\\n\\nEverything was piping hot, as it should be during lunch hour.  \\nThey gave me a big to-go box full of steamed rice which was perfect for soaking up the juices in the mapo tofu and the bean curd, so they would be easily eaten with chopsticks.

Overall this dish was passable but I would not deem it authentic Italian cuisine given that the veal was a bit tough, the mushrooms were obviously from a can and the prosciutto was lacking its usual cured flavour.

Perhaps it had been overcooked as it was placed between the veal and the melted mozzarella. \\n\\nChicken Parmigiana Combo -Combination of chicken & eggplant lightly breaded and fried, topped with melted mozzarella and marinara sauce. This dish was terrible and lacked any Italian flavour. The crumbing around the chicken and eggplant was bland and made the dish taste like stale bread.

Instead, El Naranjo offers inventive and fabulous interior Mexican cuisine, focused on the flavors of my favorite state in Mexico, Oaxaca. \\n\\nThe menu looks relatively short at first, then you learn that each of the three moles (one of which changes weekly) are available with shrimp, pork or duck -- turning three lovely and complex moles into nine menu choices.  I had a beautiful and generous piece of salmon, perfectly cooked to order (I like my salmon medium rare)  in some kind of tropical leaf, finished with a tomato-guajillo sauce.  The sauce was positively revelatory: smoky yet not hot, complex and in every way perfect for the salmon it topped. The other fish offered that night was a red snapper Veracruzano style and from the plate I saw on another table, it looked wonderful too. With shrimp available with any of three moles and these two fish choices, I found the seafood offerings to be varied and enticing.\\n\\nMy wife had a chile poblano relleno, stuffed with a pork stew that tasted of tomatillo, herbs and caper, topped with another amazing tomato based sauce with almonds. It was every bit as nice as my fish and we enjoyed sharing. \\n\\nOur less adventurous teenage diners had the tenderloin steak with a red wine reduction sauce with hints of pasilla chiles and mushrooms. The steak was the most expensive item on the menu and was only $23.  All of those boring steakhouses downtown would have charged far more for a similar steak(around $40 at Sullivan's for example, without the wonderful sauce). It was simple and delicious. We also had appetizers, taking tuns marveling at the tortilla soup and fighting over the queso fundillo with tiny corn tortillas. I can't say enough good things about this food.  We were too full for dessert, although the choices were tempting, especially the flan.\\n\\n I never went to the food trailer, but had been to the owners' original restaurant of the same name, just off the zocalo in Oaxaca -- years ago. We went even before the NY Times wrote a glowing article about how the chef-owner was challenging the traditions of conventional Mexican cuisine by cooking without lard. The re-creation in Austin is the best thing to happen to Austin dining in 2012. I put El Naranjo on my list of very best restaurant experiences in town, along with Barley Swine, Wink, and Uchiko. And unlike those other favorites, there is a lovely outdoor dining area.  Full bar too, with amazingly good margaritas.

The calamari were lightly coated and fried, there were no tentacles in sight. The dipping sauces were quite good for both dishes.\\n\\nMy friend enjoyed her special Crab Pad Thai.

We were seated at 8 and left at approx 9:30pm (party of 5.) From start to finish there were issues. Drinks: gave the wrong soda drinks to the wrong people, including root beer to someone who ordered Diet Coke, then regular coke to someone who ordered Diet Coke. Appetizers: ordered the lettuce wraps, which were delivered promptly but without any of the sauces/oils. 5 minutes passed before we even saw our server to ask for the sauce, then another several minutes before it was brought to us. All the while we stared at our plate of lettuce wraps sitting in the middle of the table. I ordered Beef Lo Mein and asked for it spicy. There was no spice to it at all. Other orders at the table of scallops and Mongolian beef were each happy with theirs; the couple who ordered the asian grilled salmon said there was nothing asian grilled about it, that it was just plain salmon. Next, we were celebrating my nephews 18 birthday so we arranged to have two small dessert \\"shots\\" brought out, his with a candle. The two small dessert shots were delivered, one with an unlit candle. In addition, no one else at the table was offered the dessert menu at all. Really? Time for the bill...10 minutes later after we had to again track down our waiter, another 5 minutes to get the bill, we received our bill and paid. Since partial payment was on a gift card we told the waiter the amount to charge separately on our Credit Card and exactly what his tip should be in that. He brought it back out for our signature and had written down for himself $5 MORE into his tip amount than we told him to. His response, as was with everything all evening \\"I don't know what happened!\\" The bill was adjusted, credit card reran, etc etc. $75 later (for 3 of us) and a botched birthday dinner all the way around, I awoke Sunday morning to realize through all of the confusion with my bill my credit card was left at the restaurant. I was able to retrieve it without further incident. Overall, just a really really disappointing experience. Makes me sad because have typically enjoyed PF Changs in the past.

Please note that their fryer is used with gluten items so the oil will contain gluten residual. Avoid the fried items on the menu if you are celiac.\\n\\nThe Happy Hour is everyday from 4:30 to 6:30.\\n\\nCocktails are good and come in a glass with a single large ice cube. I recommend the Salty Sow'r & Moscow Sow for non-sweet cocktails, while the Rosemary's Piglet and Sparkling Sangria are more on the fruity side. \\n\\nThe evening meal consist of the following item: \\n**Starters: Pastrami Salmon (GF w/o bread), Roasted Organic Beets (GF), Oyster Boudin Fritters, Crispy Brussels Sprout Leaves, Eggplant Fries\\n**Main: Blackened Redfish, Slow-cooked Beef Shoulder, Bacon Wrapped Pork Filet Mignon\\n**Sides: Green Chile Grits, Collard Greens, Cauliflower & Wild Rice Casserole\\n**Dessert: Bananas Foster Beignets & the special dessert\\nAll the items were very appetizing, full of favors, and just yummy. I would recommend all the items above, with special recognition to the redfish.\\n\\nNow to the service ... our server was just in a grumpy mood and expressed it thru out the duration. When we asked for details about how the items were prepared, his attitude was just get something. When transitioning from one course to the next, he would come to ask us what we want but would not bring back additional menus. So the table of 4+ people were sharing one menu and I had to grab additional from the hostess. He let us order the main course without the sides. Of all the times eating here, this is the 1st time that the eating atmosphere was so nasty and unreliable. I have had this server before so I don't really know what is going on. But after this, I cannot go back. I have relied on this place to be dependable in providing service for casual and business dinners.

And really, even bbq that's not that good is still pretty good.  But this place is great, but not just for the meat.\\n\\n1. When they first changed to Le Barbecue, they were handing out free Lone Stars.  That was so cool cause for like $15 I got tons of rad bbq and two beers and a tons of bbq to take home.  I don't know if they still do this, but it will forever warm my heart to remember those first days they were re-opened.\\n\\n2. They also got rid of the piped in country radio and every time I've been there, there has been a live country band, or at least a two piece.  Live country vs. recorded KVET bs is totally a horse of the different color.  If you don't believe me, go to The White Horse.  You'll see.

I was so full that I did not eat anything for approximately 14 hours (that's the length of time to go from San Francisco to Hong Kong on an airliner) and tried to find ways to keep myself physically active and not feel too heavy in weight. \\n\\nWhen you come in for the buffet, they give you a card. One side is green, which says \\"GO AHEAD\\" and the other side of the card says \\"STOP/BASTA\\". This card indicates whether or not you want your server to keep giving you the meats, and they come in different varieties on a giant skewer. You use a tong to grab the meats once they cut it. The servers were nice and they seem very patient which is good. \\n\\nThe meats I liked the most and thought were the tastiest were the pork loin, lamb, some of the beef dishes and kielbasa sausage. The pork loin had a nice tenderness to the taste. The kielbasa sausage also tender and flavorful but had plenty of greased oil inside. The lamb was really tasty and that's all I have to say. The garlic beef had a nice tasty flavor and was decently chewy.\\n\\nThe most disappointing meats were probably the other beef dishes, and chicken wrapped in bacon. The chicken was kind of dry and not tender and the bacon was okay. The roast beef was kind of rough to chew and lacked the meaty tenderness and chewiness I was looking for. As for the beef ribs, despite the fact they were tasty, they were also rough to chew. \\n\\nI did not eat too many of the side dishes from the buffet. Most of the side dishes I ate were the corn, a bunch of lettuce from the salad bar (because I always need a good balance of vegetables when I eat a lot of meat) and rice (because I wanted rice with the tasty meats). The corn was decent. The lettuce from the salad bar was also decent, but lacked some freshness from sitting in the salad bar all day. Rice was also decent but appear to have some grease on them. However it tasted really well with the meats and made the meats much more enjoyable to eat. \\n\\nOverall, this is not a bad choice to splurge and pig out on some tasty Brazilian Barbecue meats as long as you choose carefully. It is also a good place to come with a group of at least 3 people and I think you definitely can get a better deal if you come during lunch between Sunday and Thursday (less than $20).

Well we weren't going to wait 4 hours for Franklins...but I heard from a colleague and got a tip from our waiter at dinner that there is an ex Franklin employee that started up a BBQ food truck called La Barbecue.\\n\\nSo we got to the La Barbecue 'compound' 15 minutes before it opened.  The line was already at least 100 people.  We decided to wait.  They served free beer to us as we waited...we talked with locals and vacationers alike while we waited.  We waited for 2hrs and 40 mins.  AND IT WAS WORTH IT.  Now I get it.  Now I get why people will stand in line for hours just to eat great BBQ.\\n\\nWe had the beef brisket, the pork ribs and the hot sausage link.  All were outstanding but the magic was the brisket.  I had never had moist beef brisket nearly melt in my mouth.  We had both the moist (fatty) and the lean.  My favorite was the fatty moist brisket.  The pork ribs were fall off the bone tender.  I used no sauces.  the simple salt and pepper seasoning and the wood smoke did magical things to both the beef and the pork.\\n\\nSo if your in Austin and you want mind blowing BBQ, try La Barbecue...it will be worth the wait."},{"name":"Salty Sow","address":"1917 Manor Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Great atmosphere with a courteous and knowledgeable staff.

Things I have realized during my subsequent SS-induced food comas:\\n\\n- It's undeniable that Salty Sow and I should be together.\\n-  I have NEVER had a bad experience here. Service: Tops. Atmosphere: Tops. Drinks: Top it off. 110-minute egg: On top of my duck fat fries.\\n- Happy Hour: That exquisite time between sunset and \\"I'm so full, you guys,\\" when one can lose themselves in Blanche margaritas and catfish + pork belly tacos.\\n- On that note, Salty Sow's fried chicken + sweet potato biscuit is what made me break my five-year pescatarian, non-meat-eating habits. I had one bite of the chicken, and the rest is her-story.\\n- Oyster boudin fritters, roasted beets + goat cheese, the ever-rotating seasonal veggie plate, candied pork belly, all the tacos, duck fat fries, brussels sprouts salad and straight up brussels sprout leaves, zucchini fries (what?), blackened redfish (GENUWINE), cauliflower casserole (cruciferous veggies have NEVER tasted so rich or good), the never-disappointing slew of chef specials...\\n- So I memorized the menu, whatever. It's like knowing the words to your favorite song.\\n- The bananas foster beignets deserve their own bullet point. I don't care who you are, where you're from, what you did - these beignets will transform your life. They are exquisitely hot and crispy with a soothing (but similarly hot!) banana on the inside. Is it burning the roof of your mouth? No worries, that's what the ice cream that accompanies the dish is for. (When they brought us the platter, they said, \\"It's kind of big for two people.\\" They were wrong: It was too small for one me.) \\n\\nListen, I could go on and on about the utter perfection of this restaurant.

The Caesar salad is terrific - garlicky, creamy, and you can taste the lemon. Also a substantial portion for a side. (I saw others with full-serving salads, which were enormous...served in something that looked like a supper dish for a very hungry Great Dane).\\nBrews: a great selection of local stuff. The staff was good-natured about having tapped out of 10 Barrel, but no regrets after having the Breakside IPA. I likes me hops, and it had me at first sip; not overwhelming, nicely balanced.\\nThe burgers are, as others have reported here, awesome. I had the Mad Andy, which had onion ring, bacon, blue cheese, a fried egg, and jalapenos. My partner had the Woody Royale, with BBQ prime rib, jalapeno slaw, onion ring, cheddar, and so full it was falling out the sides of the bun before we even picked up the tray. The only criticism I have about their burgers - and it's a small one, all things considered - is that a sturdier bun would make the eating less challenging. The poor thing strains to contain all the goodness it's charged with delivering and understandably gave up about 3/4 of the way through the meal.\\nPie is probably my favorite food, so I had to at least try the blueberry hand pie. Even though you'll probably want to take that to go after the gigantic meal. It was nicely done, but the pie crust (which might include lard, might include shortening) is a bit on the softer/powdery side.

I am a HUGE Indian food fan, so I have tried almost every Indian restaurant in this city (and many other cities), and I have been generally disappointed.  That said, Raja is one of the best of the bunch (within the city limits - I also like Madras Chettinaad in Alpharetta for their lunch buffet).  I typically always order the same dish because I love it, so my experience is limited, but for what I get, Raja is really very good.  I order the paneer tikka masala mild and Peswari naan with a side of raita.  The tikki masala sauce is amazing!!  It's sweet and tangy with bits of onions, incredible.  So, if you are ordering paneer tikka masala, chicken tikka masala, or any variation on that theme, you will be in good shape.  The Peswari naan is SO tasty - sweet and nutty, delicious.  Some places skimp on adding real fruit and nuts to this type of naan, but not Raja.  They really do it right.  Now, the atmosphere is blah (though always clean seeming), and the prices are standard for Indian, which is to say higher than your ave casual dining place, but for my Indian craving, it's worth it.  One big downside is they lack a lunch buffet, which most Indian places offer, but they do have lunch specials during the week.  These come with veggies, dal, soup, dessert, etc. (though no bread, you have to order separately).  Chicken tikka masala is on there, but paneer is not, but they always do it for me as a lunch special when I ask.  Be sure to remind them about the lunch special accompaniments, sometimes they forget to bring the veggies or other side.

At lunch the wait can get pretty ridiculous (30 - 45 min). While the staff is efficient and courteous they are no match for the onslaught of slavering masses that come through the doors! So go to lunch early (11AM) or a little bit late (after 1PM), because if you don't you'll be crammed into the front of the restaurant with the rest of us drooling fools!!\\nI usually can tell how good a Mexican restaurant is by the salsa. Amaya's has AMAZING salsa. Not too spicy, not too runny, not too tomato-y but juuuust right. My preference is for the Chalupas Compuestas. Two flattened tortilla shells with your choice of meat (ground beef, chicken, fajita beef or fajita chicken) with refried beans lettuce and cheese topped with a FAT dollop of guacamole...YUM!!! They are so simple but taste soooo frickin' good!\\nI've also had the Fajita Tampiquena plate. Pretty much a traditional Fajita style plate but with one exception. Unlike other Mexican restaurants, the meat here is actually diced into bite sized pieces and not overly gristle-y making the fajita taco creation process a bit more easy. Gone are those moments of embarrassment when you bite into your newly created taco masterpiece only to have the meat smacking into your chin and spreading the toppings on your freshly ironed work shirt like some culinary Jackson Pollock creation. It actually stays in the taco. (What a concept!)\\nI have a friend that always gets the Carne Guisada and all I can say is OMFG! This plate is HUGE!!!

I called on a whim today and ordered a calzone because I didn't want to drive across town to Flying Pie. I should have driven across town. I phoned in an order for a calzone with 2 extra toppings since it only comes with 2 toppings.  I asked how much- $14.75 (seriously?!). She said it was big and I'd have leftovers.  When I picked it up, the box seemed light so I looked at- it looked like a stuffed breadstick.  It was about as thick as my skinny wrist and as long as a small pizza box. Where was the rest? They consider that a $14.75 calzone? It's not even the right shape!\\nI'd like to report that it was the best calzone I've ever eaten and well worth the price, but that would be far from the truth.

When I called them and asked for my money back, they offered to credit half.  Only when I told them I would leave everything outside my hotel room door for the driver to come back and pick up, would they agree to credit back the cost of the entire order.  I wish I had taken a picture of the food.   I will never order from this place again. As we left the hotel to walk to a carrabas in the parking lot, we met the delivery driver who had picked up our pizzas,  in the elevator. He said he had had difficulty with a previous delivery giving their address correctly, which had delayed our delivery. He was extremely apologetic and kind.

I was worried that the portions of the soft shell crab would be small, but was pleasantly suprised. The dish tasted great, and there was no effort needed to feast. The sizzling fish filet was delicious and satisfying. The sizzling steak was a tad bit tough to chew, but that meant I could savor the flavor for an extended time. My main complaint would be that the sizzling dishes, although quickly prepared, did not arrive sizzling, as is the standard. The golden dish of the night, however, was the Hunan crispy fish. While the other dishes were served quite quickly, this one took a while.

But worth the buy!"},{"name":"Amaya's Taco Village","address":"5804 N Interstate 35","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Imagine my shock as we pull up to Amaya's Taco Village for lunch and see this line of people outside?  Really?  Aren't we in a kinda low-rent area...I wonder.  What is going on inside that there are tons of people waiting to get into this place?\\n\\nHonestly, I can't answer that question.  The restaurant was packed with lunch patrons of all types, and the staff was hustling.  After the 15 minute wait, we are lead to our table and we order.  Ok, the menu looks pretty average, nothing too unique.  The one thing that does grab my eye is the prices - very, very cheap.  Uh oh, cheap usually equals a trip to the bathroom when it comes to Mexican food for yours truly.  \\n\\nBut I am happy to report my lunch stayed in the right place and did satisfy my craving for greasy cheese enchiladas.  Nothing to crow about, but nothing to ding either.  It was a really good, inexpensive lunch with great service.  And I assume that is the reason for the throngs of happy people  outside of Amaya's."},{"name":"Moorish Medicine","address":"2440 Wesley Chapel Rd","city":"Decatur","stars":"4","text":"I tried a smoothie and the black bean burger.

It was really good but pricey. I had the lobster ravioli so kind of an expensive thing in the first place but it was worth it.

I've been going for years and have noticed that their portions are getting smaller. Yes I know it's happy hour and portion sizes are smaller than normal. However, even for happy hour- the portions are noticeably getting smaller. In my tofu drunken noodles I could count on my fingers the amount of noodles that were used. Flavor is still there but I would rather just order off the normal menu instead of happy hour for the price and portion. \\n\\nService is also nothing to write home about.

The food was fair no complaints with price.
