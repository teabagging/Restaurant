So went on Yelp to look for another restaurant in the area and we came across the Optimist.  After reading several reviews, we decided on going there.  \\nWe were actually kind of surprised on how well this restaurant looked and was laid out.  Initially we thought we needed reservations but the Hostess was very accommodating.  Even though we advised her that we could sit at either bar.  After being seated in the back corner, we were greeted by Lou our waiter.  He was very attentive and knowledgeable about everything on their menu and their whiskeys in stock.  I supposed we talked well over 30-40 minutes on and off about bourbon, Scotch and Japanese whiskeys all night.  We also discussed other restaurants in the Atlanta area, along with several of their sister restaurants that we just so happen to visit the prior Sunday at King and Duke. Which is another review I will have to write shortly after this one and I also recommend if you're in the market for excellent steaks, seafood and drinks.\\nWe decided to go with a dozen oysters along with the She crab soup and both were excellent.  Since we couldn't decide on which entree to go with because we wanted to try them all.  Lou recommended we go with the Grilled Octopus which was marinated for 7 hours in their house blended Sherry.  It was then served with a Basil type salsa.  It was very fresh and tender, along with having a distinct grilling/char flavor. After sharing the entree and soup, we couldn't eat anymore.

There is a large variety of meats going around from chicken, to sausage, to sirloin. Our favorite without a doubt was the pichana!

The presentation was more delicious than the initial dive. My expectations may have been too high but for me it tasted like your average fried rice.

Next, I had the redfish and husband had the shrimp/squid.  The fish was, again, excellent and a bit spicy.  The shrimp dish was overwhelmed by the squid flavor, and honestly the squid were kind of gross; they resembled worms more than pieces of squid.  Finally, I had sweet potato pot de creme and husband had the antelope heart with dosa and winter vegetables.  The pot de creme was amazing, and the date ice cream that came with it was wonderful too.  The heart just didn't do it for either of us. The vegetables were oddly vinegary, the heart was very strong, the dosa just didn't go with any of it.  We highly recommend the bread and spread.

It's the oldest restaurant in Boston, and there are hints of that here and there.\\n2) The complimentary corn bread that they serve is the best I know. They sell the mix in the gift shop on the 1st floor!\\n3) The historical U-shaped oyster bar on the 1st floor makes for a great stop if you're not around for dinner. There's also usually no wait, whereas dinner time can get crowded. Beer, oysters and chowder. Heaven.\\n4) The clam chowder beats anything I've ever had at Legal Seafoods. Hence, it is the best clam chowder you can get in New England.\\n5) The Lazy Man's Lobster is my single favorite American seafood dish I've ever had. Squeeze on lots of lemon! Warning: some of the other stuff is bland, so choose wisely.

The price was alright for a small business at $5.99, but I can't help but feel since this place is basically a complete copycat of Dairy Queen, I could have had a burger, fries, drink, AND a sundae for $5.00 flat.\\n\\nThe gyro wasn't bad, it was obviously sliced beef with smooth corners resembling the taste and texture of prepackaged bologna.  The fries seem like they would have been great when they were fresh, but mine were lukewarm and kind of chewy; everyone knows what old fries taste like.  Their coke machine was wonky and the coke was way too much carbonated water, I switched to sprite and typical fountain drink quality.\\n\\nI figured I'd give it a real saving grace and got a traditional zesto cone, which was great.  It's pretty hard to screw up a soft-serve cone.  This was actually the highlight of the experience though.  This cone was a monster, easily 6\\" of stacked ice cream above the rim of the cone.\\n\\nSeating was a little cramped as they were busy and it's all bar stool seating.  Given how busy they were, I was further perplexed how their fries were so old; this was prime time lunch rush at about 12:30pm.  Nearly everyone around me ordered their most popular item: the Chubby burger.  It's basically a Big Mac with a little more beef and cheese.  I'll be back to try this as it's clearly the selling point of this place.  Any place that's been in business in the fast moving Little Five Points hipster hotspot in east Atlanta since 1949 (68 years as of this review) has to be doing something right to still be around and be packed on a Monday.  I will definitely stick to the praised favorites and avoid the expanded menu."},{"name":"Two Urban Licks","address":"820 Ralph McGill Blvd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I love the ambiance of Two Urban Licks.  It has a great view of the city and I enjoy the industrial look in the warehouse.  It really is one of those restaurants to take friends from out of town to because although the food can be rather \\"meh\\" most people will like the look and feel of the bustling restaurant.   \\n\\nI enjoy infused vodka and love the way they look hanging over the bar but I do have to say I think their drinks are VERY overpriced albeit strong.  The food is very hit or miss.  Overall, I'd never go here and say this is the best thing I've ever eaten.  However, the salmon chips are tasty and have a good kick to them and the scallops I had last timewere cooked well but the grits they were on top of were really the highlight of the meal.  \\n\\nOverall, great place to take out-of-town guests and fun ambiance, but not the best meal you've had in Atlanta."},{"name":"Grindhouse Killer Burgers","address":"1842 Piedmont Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"This place is awesome.

We were in Atlanta for the day and happened to be nearby and see the good Yelp reviews. What we didn't know is that it was Restaurant Week, that Poor Calvin's is one of the best places around, or that they'd have special prix-fixe menus only that evening.\\n\\nThere was free valet parking out front, and although the valet seemed overworked and overtired, he got the job done. Meanwhile, the Boy and I were able to walk in without a reservation and be seated within ten minutes at a charming little table in an enclosed patio space, with plenty of atmosphere and privacy but with a great view for people-watching. Loved it from the start! \\n\\nOur waiter, MAC, was as charming as they come, and he stopped by just often enough, neither hovering nor going MIA. The host - whose name I will butcher, but may have been Allende? - was equally charming and helpful! Long story short, atmosphere and service were delightful.\\n\\nI'm not sure what the regular menu looks like - I wish that we lived closer so that we could go back again and again!\\n\\nEach of us began with a glass of wine. I had the Riesling, which was just sweet enough for me to love it, and he had the Pinot Grigio, which he loved in turn.\\n\\nOf the choices presented to us, we both began with the dumpling appetizer (chicken & pork dumplings with a ginger & soy dipping sauce), because we knew we wouldn't be able to share. So true! These were DELICIOUS. Light and delicate yet bursting with flavor; the perfect texture and temperature. The dipping sauce was divine.\\n\\nFor my entree, I picked the vegan Pad Thai, prepared with tofu instead of chicken. It didn't disappoint! The portion was generous, and the flavors were wonderfully balanced. Noodles, bean sprouts, fried tofu, bits of veggies, a peanut and fish sauce... my absolute favorite part was the garnish of pickled daikon - yum! In any case, it's not a particularly unique dish, but it was made very well and thoroughly enjoyable (and equally so the next day, heated up for lunch). \\n\\nFor his entree, Boy had the Maple Duck with kale mashed potatoes and veggies (asparagus, mushrooms, zucchini). I didn't try the duck, but he said its was tender and perfect; the kale mashed potatoes were warm and fluffy and comfort food at its best. The asparagus were perfectly cooked - easy to bite through with a very light \\"snap,\\" but not crunchy or tough in any way. Perfectly marinated as well! \\n\\nDessert was a generous slice of chocolate layer cake for each of us; the middle tier was some sort of light, white cream with hidden mango-tapioca pearls that absolutely MADE the dish. There was also very light frosting around the cake, which was surprisingly good. As a general rule, I enjoy cake but despise frosting. It's overly sweet, too heavy, and always gets scraped off and left on my plate. I ate every bite of this cake - it was moist, sweet with a hint of bitter chocolate, accented with mango bursts, and not too rich (insofar as I was able to finish it all without groaning). Boy also got a coffee to help wash it down, and the coffee was a generous cup with a very pleasing aroma and flavor.\\n\\nAll in all, an EXCELLENT experience - I was happy to pay $101 (which covered, to recap, two glasses of wine, two perfect appetizers, two generous entrees (one of which was the most expensive on the menu), two large slices of cake, a cup of coffee, and a modest tip). We also tipped the valet guy, of course, but Boy did that, so I'm not factoring it into my cost here. \\n\\nLong story short: Next time we're in Atlanta, we will be going back!!"},{"name":"Mary Mac's Tea Room","address":"224 Ponce De Leon Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Wow! Glad I came across this place yesterday in Atlanta. Down home southern cooking since 1945. It's always a little crowded so it takes a minute for parking and to be seated. From what I could see, not much parking, since it is in downtown Atlanta, be prepared to walk about about a block or 2. The whole area is a nice residential area so I wouldn't worry. The restaurant is very homey and kinda upscale-ish in my opinion. Crowded but very spacious. So you won't have to worry about being all up under the next table. All of the staff are friendly and everything is organized. You check in at the front, they give you a beeper and you wait around until your beeper goes off and then be seated. On a very busy Friday night, my wait was about 20 minutes. No time. The food is definitely worth it. Everything was obviously fresh and homemade. I ordered the 4 piece fried chicken with squash souffle, fried okra, macaroni and cheese and collard greens with cracklin cornbread. And I tried some of my companion's food. The seasoning and texture on everything was good.  It was all delicious. (Understatement) I would recommend the cornbread dressing with gravy, macaroni and cheese and collard greens as sides.

Everything tasted so off and tasted like everything else, something is very wrong when you can't tell the difference between a meat and veggie dish in flavor, and each so terrible beyond words.

My husband ordered the vegan crab cake sandwich with the aji yellow pepper soup.  I ordered the vegan mushroom burger with the cauliflower truffle soup.  The combo potato fries and sweet potato fries sounded yummy too, so we ordered them as a side.\\n\\nWow!  Words almost fail me!  The aji yellow pepper soup was flavorful, spicy and intense.  The cauliflower truffle soup was rich, creamy and subtle.  The mushroom burger was a bit messy, but incredibly tasty!  The bun was roasted, the patty was rich with umami flavors, with spicy sweet condiments.  The crab cake sandwich was likely the best we've ever tasted!  The brioche bun was toasted, the crab cake patty had a delicate texture and wonderful flavor, and the condiments nicely complimented the crab cake flavor.  We were glad we ordered the mixed french fry combo, finding the potato fries, the sweet potato fries and the house ketchup all super tasty!  We devoured everything, savoring every single taste!  Maya checked on us often and was one of the best servers we've ever experienced!  Maya was attentive, friendly and helpful without ever crowding us.  \\n\\nAfter dinner we were quite full, but Maya offered us the dessert menu to explore for fun.  Good choice on her part, since we couldn't resist ordering a slice of vegan carrot cake to go!  We had a wonderful experience at Leaf and wish we could eat here all the time!  Fantastic food and excellent service, what more could we ever want!  BTW, we devoured the carrot cake about an hour or so later, and it was delicious!"},{"name":"Bar 145","address":"955 W 5th Ave","city":"Columbus","stars":"3","text":"This is the worst bar in Columbus. 45 minute wait for a diet coke.

This place has been packed with 2+ hour waits any other time I've tried to dine here, and unfortunately they don't take reservations.

He took about 10+ minutes though to come back and take our drink orders. I went with a glass of Ros√© while my boyfriend just went with a beer (which came with a Launderette koozie!) The koozie was a nice touch, as you were able to take it home as a \\"souvenir.\\" However, I highly recommend that the restaurant try a more unique design.... what they currently have is extremely grainy and hard to read.\\n\\nAfter we received our drinks, it took our server another 10+ minutes to come back and ask if we were ready to order.... and we were, because I was super hungry! Here's what we went with and my thoughts on each:\\n\\n* Chips with pimento cheese -- This was $6 which I thought was rather expensive for something equivalent to the FREE chips and salsa one would receive at a mexican food restaurant. I mean it was good, but didn't seem like something worth paying for.\\n* Crab Toast -- be prepared, this $9 order comes with only 1 little toast. Not enough to really share with someone and actually be able to enjoy. It sure was delicious though, but rather expensive for such a tiny bite.\\n* Sticky Brussels Sprouts - all vegetable sides are $9. I'd say this is fairly reasonable for how much they serve. Great for sharing! But these Brussels sprouts were Delilah with an apple-bacon and had a bit of a kick with some kind of chopped up pepper \\n* Hanger Steak - pretty delish, but also pretty small. No side includes so make sure to order something extra if you're hungry. Only  $18, which seemed fair for steak\\n* Chicken Thighs - these were yummy as well and had some kind of scrumptious aioli to dip your bites of chicken in. Super tasty and only a  $12 dish.\\n\\nOverall, I did really enjoy our dinner. Great atmosphere in the heart of East Austin. I recommend trying this place out at least once.

The special rolls were alright but nothing to 'wow' about. I'm not sure how it can even compare to Kishimoto, because it simply just doesn't. The presentation of the dishes were nicely decorated, so I'll give them that. We ordered the crunchy tatsu roll and the fried toppings were soggy and the outside layer that's fried was really hard and had an unpleasant taste. \\n\\nLastly, service was horrendous. Probably the worst I've experienced in a while. The waitresses were not attentive and it took 30 minutes just for our sashimi to arrive. Another 20 minutes for our next roll of sushi. We were never offered water or tea when we sat down and had to wait a good 10 minutes before a waitress came to take our order. Mind you, we tried to flag them down but they don't scan their surroundings and they harsh tunnel vision.

I didn't have any of the slice of bacon that came in the drink but I'm guessing that is there more for novelty than as a snack. Not everything was perfect of course. The meal I had consisted of fried eggs and pulled pork on top of their homemade biscuits and I gotta say that the pulled pork was a pretty bland affair.

Like other FF restaurants, Optimist is well conceptualized with trend setting menu, mostly solid executions, and stunning space.  The restaurant had halfheartedly marketed itself as evoking the charm of a seafood shack on the New England shore.  What we really have is large high ceiling dining room, enormous fancy bar, gorgeous natural lighting via gigantic windows which makes it a pleasure to visit early evening or at lunch time.  It does not look like a seafood shack, ha ha.  It looks every bit as elegant and recognizable as the other FF creations.  That's good enough for me.  \\n\\nI ate here a few times over the past two years.  It's mostly hits with just some misses.  The menu is easy to like: small plates and sides are many and varied.  Many oysters.  The requisite lobster roll.  Most of the mains come with different, unique preparations, sides, and/or sauces.  The fancy bar makes you want to order one of the trendy cocktails, which at any FF restaurant usually turns out to be quite delightful.  I like almost all the small plates I ate here, except for the soups which makes me sad.  If you are a traditionalist with seafood preparation, you might not like the mains as much.  I am not a traditionalist but I still felt a couple times where the fish was messed with a bit too much or that there's just too much distractions in a smothered plating of lots of different things (delicious things, though) on the fish.  I have no verdict on who has Atlanta's best lobster roll.  Optimist's will certainly not disappoint.  \\n\\nOverall, even if the food is not perfect and there probably isn't any dish I would crave and regularly want to eat, Optimist delivers a smooth, pleasurable dining experience, with foods that generally excite, very much meeting justifiably high expectation of a FF restaurant.  And is a good option on the Howell Mill corridor that has become a mini food mecca over the years."},{"name":"Ask For Luigi","address":"305 Alexander Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Now, I'm not normally one to wait an hour or more in line for dinner but this place was totally worth the wait!

Low and behold, we got there and it turned out there was an actual event being held (80's prom night) instead of being able to see a movie!

My friend ordered the Bacon Maple Bar, although hesitant at first, it was awesome! In fact I kind of want another one right now.  The reason I only give it 3 stars is because I also tried a frosted doughnut with fruit loops on it and a chocolate frosted doughnut with butterfingers crumbled on top, I was not impressed with the last two doughnuts.

Had Bison burger and it had a good taste but was also $16 compared to a normal burger that was around $13.  Maple Mac/ cheese was pretty good.\\n\\nCons: wait staff and hostess staff obviously not trained at all!  \\n \\n-Ex. while waiting in line for a table (while may were available) we heard the couple in front of us ask to be seated in a particular server's station.  The hostess asked \\"Why\\"?  the gentleman said  \\"because he is our son\\"!  To which the hostess replied, \\"I'm not even sure he is here tonight\\".  Seriously?  The man said, \\"I promise he is\\" She walked away and another hostess came over and said \\"we don't think there are any tables available in his section\\".  Not, would you mind waiting or let me see what I can do for you.    After the man put up a stink saying basically if we can't sit in my son's section we are leaving, they found the couple a table.\\n\\n-Due to not having many prices on menu for a lot of the drinks we found ourselves asking waitress for prices (shouldn't have to ask right...they should just have prices on menu).  Even worse, waitress didn't know prices either.  When asked specifically about prices of specialty drinks she said \\"somewhere between $6-$8.  Hmmnnn.   I ordered a scotch which listed on menu at $5.50 for 1 oz or $10.50 for 2 oz.   After ordering a 1 oz. pour, she brought it back saying good news is that it actually is a 1.5oz pour.  Great, I thought until I later looked at the bill and they charged me $13 each for two of them.  Wow!!  \\n\\n-Wife had a Jalapeno/ Cucumber lemonade that tasted watered down and had no flavor compared to the ones we've had elsewhere.\\n\\n-We also asked for a specialty cocktail that was not on the menu.  Waitress said she would ask mgr.  She finally came back to say \\"The answer was NO\\".   If the answer is no, IMO the mgr. should have come over to explain why and handle any concerns instead of sending the waitress back with a \\"NO\\".  What ever happened to good old fashioned customer service. ie, the customer is always right.  Now, believe I know this can't always be the case, but when you are going to deny a request from a customer, that should be handled delicately, and not by a poorly trained server.  Again, just my opinion. \\n\\nI will say Bar 145 was crazy crowded (over 1.5 hr. wait by the time we left on a Sat. night).  Just can't figure out why, unless it's just because it's new and most probably are starved for live music in Dayton and didn't want to travel downtown.\\n\\n-Good luck and maybe they will get it together.

I said do you let your employees talk to customers like that they laugh say it doesn't matter we are the boss. All this in front of my son.

Definitely a date restaurant. Inside and outside I can't say a negative word about the decor or vibe. Mussels were heavenly. No doubt the best I've had in Atlanta (probably due to the fabulously heavy hand with the cream). What little I saw of my server, she was wonderfully knowledgable. I saw actual French diners in there and felt it would be a promising meal.\\n\\nBad: Service was slow - or do we say European? I didn't want the table for the night, just for a couple of hours. Water came right away but it's a steamy night in Georgia in June. Bring on the ice cold Chablis already-- Not half an hour after we sit down. Darling plastic bag shaped ice bucket for the bottle was  a welcome table addition.  Another 10 minutes to take an order that was ready to be give with the wine order.  Good thing the scene is nice or I would have been more impatient than I already was.\\n\\nBoth of us got one of the two special entrees of the night. I had a steak that , while cooked perfectly and the wild mushroom corn hot buttery relish atop it was good , the actual cut of meat was not. more tendon than edible. The tilefish special was quite good though. Interesting combinations of proteins and sides on the menu. For that I say Brava.\\n\\nNow the very unfortunate ugly. French desserts are legendary. I don't believe  the chef knows this. No mousse on the menu. No I am not joking.  We selected flourless chocolate cake and profiteroles. The cake was too eggy and the profiteroles were overcooked and burned in parts. 4 out of 10 stars for that.

As far as variety of options goes, Voodoo has it all.  They even have some oversized fun donuts to experience.  The taste, I thought, was nothing special.

The service was fantastic, (name was Robert, I believe) and he was very knowledgeable and recommended the BEST margarita I've ever had, and to this hour, I still owe my etoh palate to his suggestions. The margarita was crisp, not overly sweet, married perfectly to the rim of salt surrounding the scotch glass.\\n\\nNow here comes the meal; we decided to share our meals, Asian...or Spanish style by ordering a slew of tapas. Between the four of us, we shared the yuca frita appetizer, the ensalada verde peruana (salad with palm hearts, cotija, and asparagus in passionfruit vinaigrette), des pescado 5 elementos cerviche, picadillo acebichado (filet mignon tartare), mixta nikkei (tuna and crab salad served over mashed potatoes), beef heart kebobs, and grilled octopus, and acelgas empanadas (braised spinah and chard with mushrrom). For dessert, we had the tres leches cake and the trio of creme brulee.\\n\\nAlright, EVERYTHING WAS DELICIOUS!!! The end. But to elaborate, my favorite was definitely the grilled octopus, as it was the most succulent, giant piece of octopus I've ever had (and it definitely didn't taste fishy at all). My next was actually the mixta nikkei, as the mashed potatoes tasted so light and delicate and the seafood mixture was delightful. The salad was surprisingly large, especially for the high quality ingredients and served as a relief in between the proteinacious meals. My GF really loved the tartare, although I was more entranced with the raw quail egg on top of the tartare than the actual beef. Finally, what really surprised me was how much I loved the creme brulee! I generally dislike caramel, but the three offered vanilla, chocolate and lemon flavors, all of which were not overpowering, but definitely offered a level of sophistication that can't be bought at any pastry shops in the northeast. The tres leches...not too crazy in comparison.\\n\\nOverall, the entire dinner was less than $200, which was amazing, considering it fed 4 people and my previous dinner for two was almost $250.

The last time I ate here with a friend their toroniku meat was SPOILED and had a really funny taste to it.  It was really difficult flagging down a waiter to ask for replacement meat and in retrospect I should have immediately talked to their hostess about it. They used to ask you mid-way how everything is but now we get absolutely no service between when the ramen arrives and when we are done eating. I informed the waitress that brought our check that the meat was spoiled and she told me that she would tell the staff and that we were the first patrons to bring this up. However, we did not receive any sort of compensation for the ramen or even an apology really.  After the meal my friend who unfortunately swallowed some of the spoiled meat suffered an episode of SEVERE GASTROINTESTINAL DISTRESS a la Stephen Fishbach during Survivor Cambodia.

After our unfortunate experience this evening, I doubt I will ever go back there again.\\n\\nThe problem I have is with their management. Our Groupon offer stated that the $25 gift certificate itself was good towards food only, with a $45 minimum TOTAL purchase. When we were ready to pay, their computer systems went down and our server was incredibly apologetic and even offered us a free dessert. We declined the dessert since we were so full, and waited an additional 40 minutes for our bill. She then proceeded to inform us that we hadn't reached our $45 minimum food purchase stated on the certificate's terms and conditions, and that our margarita purchases could not counted towards our minimum. We were at $40 of food, and were forced to order dessert after having waited 40 minutes for our bill. When she brought the bill, she said that our Groupon deal automatically added gratuity. I know this was a management decision, since she was sincere in her apologies and was slightly timid when approaching us with our bill. Their management must have assumed that we would not be tipping her due to the wait time, which was not the case whatsoever. There is nowhere on the Groupon fine print that states that gratuity is automatically added. It only says to make sure to tip your server appropriately based on the full amount. I know most Groupon type offers always state that certain charges are based upon the sole discretion of the restaurant itself, but we would assume that after having us wait for more than 40 minutes for our bill that these charges would not have been included. Or that we would not be forced to order something in addition, and wait additional time for that to be ready. We were fine with waiting, but the additional charges were just ridiculous. \\n\\nThe food was okay, but not enough for me want to give this place a second shot.

Finding the brewery is sort of tricky, you either have to know the Portland road system very well or use the directions on the Hair Of The Dog website. Once we finally found the place we pulled up to see the door of the brewery open and ready for us to enter. As you walk in it is sort of like walking into someone's very large garage. Barrels are piled all around and off in the back you can see all the brewing equipment. The size of the place is less than half of the newly opened Metropolitan Brewery in Chicago. When we walked in further we found Alan stirring the brew kettle, he was on his first batch for the day with three more to go. Alan finished what he was doing and then welcomed us to his brewery. The tour started and ended almost at once, you basically walk around in a small circle and Alan explains what everything is. My favorite part of the \\"tour\\" was being able to see all the barrels he had and what was being aged in each one. After Alan showed us around the brewery we stepped up to his bar to try what he had on tap. He gave a little history about the brewery and talked about each of his beers. Alan had five beers for us to sample; Greg, Fred, Blue Dot, Ruth, & the 2008 Doggie Claws. The Greg was the only one I had not had and one of the more unique beers I have had recently. He doesn't use any hops in the Greg, only squash.\\n\\nOverall it was great to visit the brewery and I greatly appreciate Alan for taking time out of his day to show me and the finacee around. If you're in Portland or just visiting and you love beer, be sure to make the time for Hair Of The Dog."},{"name":"Andina Restaurant","address":"1314 NW Glisan St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Dave is the best!!!

The yeast rolls that we started with were very good, and good bread is usually a sign of a good meal to follow.  But for me, the food fell short.  The charred octopus was very tough and chewy.  The spicy shrimp were good, but be prepared to make a big mess, because they come entirely in their shell, including heads and tails.  The sauce was tasty.  The sweet potatoes were good, but full of butter...how could they be bad?  The tuna was just not good...I've had way better tuna elsewhere.  It came served as huge slabs of meat...and it just didn't taste very good.  My friend got the black bass, and we decided to each try an eye. Yes, you read that correctly.

The McMenamins Kennedy School was a good find. There was a bar/coffee house attached to a kid friendly movie theater (during the day only) that featured Toy Story 3 and then in the evening showings featured the new flick-Salt. Our timing was in between showings so we didn't stay for a movie; however, I would definitely go back. The McMenamins' website is quite busy, but they have a lot of great resources to find what you are looking for. We at at the Courtyard restaurant and tried the beer sampler. The hammerhead and their stout I would highly recommend!! My husband and I split a personal pan pepperoni, black olive and blue cheese pizza and a burger w/ tater tots. Both were quite good! The lunch menu had enough for all interests, but we stuck to the generic pizza and beer idea.

Keep it up!\\n\\nGenerally I avoid writing negative reviews but this place is a joke. For background, I worked at a mall Taco Bell for 2 1/2 years as a teenager. We were busy as hell all the time, especially during the holidays. Even then we never had a turn around time of more than 10 minutes and when we had orders going heading up towards the 10 minute mark we addressed it with training and later firing if the employee couldn't carry their wait. This place clearly needs to revisit their approach on how to run a fast food franchise. \\n\\nObviously, I understand that the place is new and is staffed with mainly trainees. At some point however, the excuse becomes just that- an excuse. It's been several weeks since this place opened and so far we've had four bad experiences:\\n\\n- I waited in line for 15 minutes before someone came outside to tell me and the others in line that the refrigerator broke and they had to close.

Unfortunately there was no beef or sour cream on my wife's burrito and the side of guacamole we ordered was missing as well. \\n\\n- Just today we waited for 20 minutes for two items with one other person ahead of us. My chicken quesarito had the wrong chicken on it and my cheesy gordita crunch didn't have any baja sauce or shredded cheddar cheese. It's not hard: gordita shell with three cheese. Put in steamer until it beeps so the cheese is melted. Place hard taco with beef inside on top of melted cheese. Fold gordita around hard taco. Baja sauce on the beef. Lettuce. Cheddar cheese. Wrap. Put in bag. Walk away feeling competent enough to make a taco.\\n\\nIn summary, how hard is it to make a taco? Answer- it's not. Source: I've done it.\\n\\n--side note: staff is very friendly.

For dessert I had the grapefruit cremeux; a swirl of citrus, avocado and cream. My server was Hillary, who was very gracious to answer my questions and was attentive to my sporadic ordering style. My only critique was that my Bouchard Chardonnay was served too cold; so I was forced to wait a bit for it to come up to temperature   \\n\\nIf you come to Austin, please consider Launderette."},{"name":"Broder Caf√©","address":"2508 SE Clinton St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Had some real good food and drinks.

We went back to get new plates, we mentioned our issue (to one of the 5 guys in the grill area) and were brushed off and rude commnts made toward my friend and I. \\nWe were going to say something at the end of our meal, but two gals behind us immediately called them on it and when they were also scoffed at, they went to management... who didnt seem to care.\\n\\nWe came tonight for moms birthday, hopeing our previous visit  was a fluke. Unfortunately this wasnt the case. The same issues. Burnt meat, uncooked veggies. The resturaunt had, maybe 7 tables occupied, including ours. With two servers we should have been fine, right? Nope. When our server 'graced us' with her presence she was either mumbling along wih the radio, insulting our intelligence, or simply ignoring us.\\n\\nShe repeatedly walked passed our table to verbally ask others if they needed anything... 9 times. We got up to grab another plate,  and the old ones were still there when we got back. And still there for 15-20 minutes after.

The salmon tasted fresh from a smoker, nothing like the stuff in the packet in the deli section (thank goodness), hot, with great texture and a thin crust from the seasoning, and was accompanied by wilted tomato and spinach, topped with poached eggs and hollandaise sauce. I requested my eggs be poached medium, and they came out PERFECTLY! I ordered a side of grits with my entree and have found a new favorite place for grits! I'm not a super huge fan of them, but these were very creamy, and had fresh pieces of corn mixed in. Perfect topped with a little cheese!\\n\\nThe french toast: Everyone else at my table ordered a variation of the french toast and was equally as delicious. A slight buttery crunch on the edges, and delightfully chewy with cinnamon toward the center. I tasted the pork patty sausage as well, great crust and flavor. \\n\\nWe also had mimosas with our meal, and I tried their variation of the classic with orange juice and champagne with apple bitters, which added a slight bite to it, which I enjoyed, but be aware that it does add 'bitterness' and almost a tanginess to the drink.\\n\\nI will definitely be back here sooner than later!"},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Voodoo is definitely part of the \\"Portland Experience\\".

A great combination since the grilled octopus is a bit salty so the pickled cauliflower counteracted that.

I wish the fried chicken wasn't so overly battered and that the mac and cheese would have more lobster in it. I'm sure it was pricey for fried chicken because of the lobster so I was hoping for more..\\n\\nSeafood Siam wok tossed entree: really flavorful!!

It was strange, it almost had no taste and the veggies were all chopped up so finely you couldn't really taste them.  The mango salsa was really fantastic though, I loved that.

The third visit I tried the steak with asparagus and potatoes. On that one visit I'd recommend ordering your steak one level rarer. It was the vegetables that were outstanding.

But, before I go there. I need to rave about the things I loved.\\n\\nFirst, the ambiance. It's definitely a really happening place. hahah..\\"happening\\".  No really, even though that word is out of date, the place is not. The colors are warm, it's well lit but not bright, and the decor is spot on. \\n\\nGo there for happy hour and enjoy $5 drinks, oysters for $1 each, and sit at the bar to watch the bartender shake up some fancies -- unless you're not that type of person. (whatever that is). \\n\\nThis is what I ate:\\nVegetarian Causa (with feta, peppers, olives, red onion, avocado) -- probably my favorite dish of the night because of the mix of textures and flavors. It's a creative dish with the most delightful potato base, flavored in a mild but distinct way. The little bit of salty goodies on top rounded out the dish. \\n\\nDe Pescado \\"5 Elementos\\" Cebiche -- wow. the texture, the portion, the presentation, the everything was amazing....except ONE thing. it was way too salty!  (I know!! Such a bummer...) I had to eat it with the yam that presented with the dish because it was just too much to eat alone. And, again...I really like flavorful/salty things, but this was too much for me. \\n\\nOysters! Fresh East Coast and West Coast oysters.  I love that they had 2 options, and that the oysters were really fresh. The 3 different toppings they provide are untraditional for oysters, but such a creative mix of flavors that well suited the oysters. The only bummer was that the oysters were much smaller than I thought they would be. Eh, but still tasty...plus only one dollar. (..that it almost made me hollar). \\n\\nLastly, I had the Pisco Sour, because it was the most popular (and recommended) drink. And, sadly....I wasted $5. It just didn't have the UmPh! I was looking for. It was strong - don't get me wrong - but I didn't jive with the flavors. There are lots of other options; I'd go with one of those other ones. \\n\\nOtherwise, I'm really glad I went. The service was good, sitting at the bar was fun, and there's a lot of life there.

The food was inventive and delicious, the ambiance upbeat and cleverly retro diner-ish, and the service was energetic and attentive.\\n\\nThe details...\\n\\nThe food: We ordered 5 \\"jump-offs\\" (small plates), which was perfect for 2 people. The deviled eggs were straight up classic, creamy and salty and perfect. The shrimp were warm and flavorful. The cauliflower was cooked perfectly and had a great balance of flavors and textures. The waffle fries were thick and crunchy with a savory dusting of cheddar powder on top and a creamy tasty aoli. The catfish riette, which was the special for the evening, was the only dish we didn't love, but that was our fault for hearing \\"catfish\\" and \\"duck fat\\" and saying *obviously we must have that*.. Without knowing what riette was. It's a spread like p√¢t√©, and it was as described, but we just weren't in the mood for that texture. For drinks, we only got wine and beer, but will have to try the cocktails next time. \\n\\nThe ambiance: Awesome low-hanging warm lighting, a nice long bar with round diner-esque bar stools, an opening into the kitchen with a retro neon sign that days \\"sodas\\", and quite a few seats and tables but not too jam packed together. \\n\\nThe service: Matt was taking care of keeping our water glasses full, and he was at our table regularly to do so even though it was a busy Saturday night. Nikki was our server, and she was fun, energetic, informative, and just all around awesome. The dishes came out more slowly than small plates typically do, but I preferred the relaxed pace to being rushed. \\n\\nThe price: Totally reasonable. The small plates ranged from $6-16, so our food total was a perfectly fair $48. \\n\\nLooking forward to a return visit to try out some different menu items and sample the cocktails!"},{"name":"Union Oyster House","address":"41 Union St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Ye Olde Union Oyster House is the legend!

It seems like the bouillabaisse just got taken out of the menu recently, too.  \\n\\nFood tastes good (if unimpressive) and comes simply presented, with a tendency that most appetizers are larger than entrees. Cryspy Calamari and PEI Mussels are humongous (though the mussels' quality leaves much to be desired), even the escargots can potentially be a meal if paired with enough of the crusty bread ubiquitously served in French bistros.   Entrees tend to be starch deprived, but they do showcase the various vegetables which I think are cooked and paired really well, and hold your interests in general.  It might be one of their strong points.  \\n\\nNearly everywhere you read, a review of this restaurant will mention how suitable it is for a romantic dinner.  I would agree.

Granted the place was busy but it wasn't elbow-to-elbow standing room only busy. \\n\\nThe food itself is decent (selection & portion size) for the price you pay. Surprisingly, the fish is some of the best fish I've had at a restaurant in Vancouver. This place definitely isn't on the list of usual suspects for good filets of fish (like McDonald's filet-o-fish.. does that exist anymore?), but consider it the next time you're ordering a dinner here.\\n\\nThe drink selection is pretty decent with some good local and import beers. \\n\\nOverall, still a decent spot for food & drinks tucked away in this residential/industrial hodgepodge. Hope the service has improved when you go. So go and let me know! :)"},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Great vegan donuts.

The Southern Boy was awesome! THAT BBQ SAUCE! Yum. Anyway, the Notorious Sausage was really delicious but the macaroni on top didn't make ANY sense to me. It was described by the server that it was just a filler and not really there for flavor, which is okay but when I got it, I didn't expect it to be tasteless and really adding NOTHING to the meal. It didn't even taste like the 'n cheese was there, just the mac! So even though I enjoyed the sausage, the whole thing put together made me feel a little shorted.

There just that seasoning reminiscent of which is Raheim's on Peyton Rd from over 10 years.  I'm sorry I have yet to find a similar place outside Atlanta.  Maybe it has to do with the fact its a hole in a wall place that's been around for 30 years.  Either way, I love it.  I always order the croaker which is not common fish you find in many fish joints.  Just the right seasoning, the breading is not too thick.  Their fried shrimp is awesome too.  In addition, they have a hot bar which includes oxtails, baked chicken, collard greens, mac & cheese, and other southern favorites.  They also have fried and buffalo wings which I haven't tried.  They have other flavors which includes their own sweet and spicy sauce which they sell also I might try one day. Pricing is not bad my croaker dinner which comes with fries, coleslaw, and two hushpuppies was only $6.99.  The hot bar except the ox tails is about $5.00 which includes meat, 1 side, and a soda or 2 sides (no soda).  The wait is a bit long (15-20 min.) so its best to call ahead if you can.

They have completely renovated the inside and it looks beautiful! The Red Sox game was on the high def TVs at the bar when we got there. They have some awesome TVs, for my money, best place in Malden to watch a game. I think they want to be (and I think this because the manager told me) the place you go after dinner at Exchange Street or All Seasons. However, we were hungry on this Sunday afternoon, and we decided to eat here in addition to having a couple of draft beers. The menu is small, which was fine because it seems like they know what they are good at. We started with the boneless wings, it had an Asian name, but I'm going to offend someone if I try to guess what it was called. They were very tasty, didn't need any sauce. I had the Mexican style burger which had a spicy aioli and guacamole with onion straws. Fabulous. My girlfriend had the Breakfast burger which had bacon, fried egg,and spicy ketchup...unreal.  There was a guy playing accoustic guitar while we ate, and he was great (everything from James Taylor to Green Day). I guess they are having DJs and live bands Fridays and Saturdays which sounds cool. Last night they had a live band everyone was raving about. We heard the bartender talking about a beer pong tournament there next Sunday, which would sound terrifying if it was still Honey Fitz's but was intriguing because I still think I'm kinda good and I don't think I'll get stabbed if I go there. \\nI say this is the new cool bar in downtown Malden.\\nI would definitely go here to watch a game, check out a band, have a beer, or if someone dragged to me listen to a DJ.

To begin with, the place is so crammed and so small that you can actually rest your elbow onto your Neigbour table and that is uncontested. Secondly the big kitchen is in front of your eyes and you get to see your meal cooked in front of your eyes, but you get to inhale all the cloud formed by the cooking from the kitchen and the restaurants only entry door happens to be closed, so the heat and the atmosphere is very dangerous for those having asthma or allergic to smoke.

Quirky, delicious, and and potentially (wonderfully) offensive.\\n\\nIt's literally like no other doughnut shop you've ever been to. If you walk in expecting Dunkin' or Tim Horton's you are going to be extremely surprised and potentially appalled. Everything is made right in house so you can always expect a fresh batch of doughnuts ready to satisfy your sweet tooth. Way better than the shipped in junk the corporate guys have. The selection is also enormous. Plain doughnuts, filled doughnuts, doughnuts with breakfast cereal toppings, doughnuts with meat on them, they've got 'em all. It'll take you some time to try everything on the menu. I recommend the Portland Cream and their signature Bacon Maple bar.\\n\\nIf you're looking for a massive coffee selection, there's a probably a barista with gauged ears, a mohawk, flannel shirt and a terrible indie band down the street who can help, but Voodoo pretty much has one or two selections at most. That's fine by me as you come here for the doughnuts not the coffee. \\n\\nThey've got fun promos too such as the \\"Coffin Full of Donuts\\" which is exactly what it claims to be. Also, they have a challenge in which if you can eat their largest doughnut in a short enough time, you get it for free. The counter attendant at the location I went to advised me, \\"Drink a couple beers or smoke some pot and you'll be able to do it no problem.\\" Awesome.\\n\\nSome people say that Voodoo is \\"touristy\\". There's a reason a place draws tourists, it's good. My only two gripes: \\n1) No credit cards. Really? A business this successful can't afford the 2% swipe fee? I'd go much more often if they took cards. I don't always have cash when I have a craving.\\n2) Employees aren't exactly \\"friendly\\". It's not that they're rude it's just seems that they're all pretty jaded. \\"Right, we sell cream filled, dick shaped doughnuts. Are you ready to order or not?\\" For a place this fun I wish the staff was more engaging.\\n\\nOverall Voodoo Doughnut is a must go.

I'm surprised I haven't reviewed them until now and it may be unfortunate because I used to really like coming here. I even used to like walking by just for the smell of it. Walking down park Avenue, even if I was blind I would know where Panullos was because of the amazing garlic smell coming from it. And on my last visit I realized that doesn't happen any more. \\n\\nI've been here on dates, with family and friends, and as I write this review I realize how different it is each time I go there. Not that the menu is different, but the food tastes different. I remember taking that first bite and thinking \\"Mmmgood!\\", but no more.\\n\\nThe dough dishes like pizza and calzones are good and consistent but there isn't a whole lot to them. Not that it's a bad thing. I enjoy simplicity as long as the food is good. One problem about the calzones is that you get a calzone the size of your forearm and a dipping sauce dish the width of a peanut butter cup. \\n\\nBut my most recent visit I got the veal franko because it was on lunch special for $9.95 with a soup or salad. My friend asked the server if she liked the franko or the chicken parm better and she said \\"the chicken parm, definitely\\". So I asked her if the franko was bad and she said that it wasn't her favorite and I shouldn't get it if I've never tried sherry sauce before. Oh well, I'm an adventurous eater. So I told her I would get that with the salad bar.   \\n\\nThe salad bar is inside by the kitchen. The dishes are in the \\"chiller\\" by the greens. I put quotation marks because the chiller was basically just a cooler with a lid, I don't think it was turned on. The lettuce in the larger bowl was that prechopped bagged kind and looked like it had seen better days. It couldn't have been out that long because it was only noon when we ate there. So I opted for the spinach instead. They actually had a pretty good selection of toppings, I just wish the area was taken care of a bit better. This isn't the first time I got the salad bar and the lettuce looked like that on previous visits as well.\\n\\nWe got our entrees right as I returned with my salad so I didn't really get a chance to eat it. My veal franko wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either. The entire dish was bland and lacking in seasoning. Even just a little salt would have helped. The sauce, pasta, veal, all of it was just kind of there. I was hungry so I ate it but my friend and I ended up switching because her marinara sauce had huge pieces (I mean whole plum tomatoes) scattered through her sauce and she specifically asked if there was chunks in the sauce. I personally liked it, but it wasn't my order. \\n\\nI just think that somewhere over the years, Panullo and his staff just stopped caring. It's not bad, it's just not good. It's like when you've had a long relationship and one day you kiss the other person and you know they aren't really trying to impress you anymore and you just don't feel it. So you have to break up.

This golf course is absolutely stunning! I've only recently picked up the sport of golf with my fianc√©; whom has been playing his whole life, but Celebration was by far the best course we have ever played on. Not to mention that the price was absolutely on point! The greens were very well kept and maintained. I can say two things I did not enjoy:\\n\\n1.  The guy who told the 4 of us to pickup the pace as the group IN FRONT OF US, was 2 holes ahead of us. I can start by saying that there was NO ONE behind us and NO ONE waiting on us. We were not playing slow, we wound up catching up to the group in front of us and had to wait for them all to tee off. Which leads in to #2....\\n\\n\\n2.  We wouldn't have been taking as long if we were allowed to drive the cart on the fairway. They had recently seeded, understandably in November but walking that course takes a really long time and it is not an easy course... which now leads me in to #3....\\n\\n3.   The seeding was far too much, that it almost made putting impossible. You would putt the ball and it would bump, bump, bump, on the green so many times and then eventually veer-off. You were lucky if you could 1 putt on these greens.\\n\\nNow all of that being said, I still offer Celebrations a 4 star review because I believe it is deserving, based on the maintenance and we happened to come to the course at a time when they had recently seeded. However, the lost star is due to the staff being pushy about moving quickly when there was no one behind us and we were playing at the same pace as the other group in front of us, who had just had a 3 par while we were on a 5 par. Also, it is absolutely amazing the houses located along this course... they are to die for.

Unfortunately, it was a rainy/foggy evening so there wasn't much of a view even though we had a window seat.  I had the sparkling pear and level 52 martini.  I enjoyed the pear one more, the disaronno in it gave it a great taste.  The chambord in the level 52 martini was a little to sweet for my liking.  \\n\\nBased on other reviews, I wasn't expecting a mind blowing meal, but I really enjoyed the swordfish, which was crusted w macadamia nuts and served with a butternut squash puree and brussel sprouts w bacon.  While I wouldn't go back just for this meal, it was good.  My bf had a snapper dish, which was a special for the evening-his thoughts were the same.\\n\\nFor dessert, we got the creme brulee and the warm chocolate cake.  The cake was a molten lava cake and not very special, but the toffee ice cream served with it was delicious.  I wish I just had a bowl of that!  If ice cream is your best dessert option, that does not speak very well for you IMO.\\n\\nOur service was excellent.  Very nice and attentive (refilling my low martini glass) They acknowledged my 30th bday and even wrote a \\"Happy Birthday\\" on my dessert plate, which I appreciated.  My bf left a 25% tip, and the waiter came and thanked us profusely after.  As another reviewer noted, I don't think they get treated very kindly, often.  \\n\\nOver all-this is definitely a \\"special occasion\\" place and I would like to go back for drinks in the lounge on a clear night, rather than dinner.

Our server, Christopher, was well versed in the history of the building - which is probably on the minds of a lot of the diners there since the interior is so stunning. See my pics for more.\\n\\nTodd P's point that this is a \\"gem\\" is spot-on the money.

Pretentious places, unless you *intend to have that experience, are just that - full of pretense. \\n\\nI had the frothy She Crab soup, and while not as good as South City's, it's a totally different take: light, run through a sieve (yes, I'm a nerd and asked our server how it was made) and more brothy. I missed the chunks of yumminess that SCK's version has. Still, it was good.\\n\\nFor dinner I had the duck-fat poached swordfish. It was good, but the cut was small and the duck fat colored the flesh of the fish to a brown point that didn't seem right in my opinion. This dish could have been better, but I loved how tender it was. I cook swordfish all the time and would have made some adjustments to it. but hey - I ain't slavin' away in the kitchen there.\\n\\nMy dining co-conspirator, Jason, had the relished cornmeal-crusted redfish and this, by a mile, was the dish of the night.

Then he proceeded to do nothing about it. I could have been \\"ok\\" with the temperature of my steak if it at least tasted good but it actually had no flavor at all. I later tasted my son's burger to find it was flavorless also.  My wife confirmed that I was not having some sort of tastebud defect.  So after all of this I expected a small compensation for screwing up my steak- like a free dessert or knocking something off my tab, but what I got was...wait for it...nothing!  The waiter obviously recognized my dissatisfaction when. He brought the bill and said, \\"Sorry, Boss, we'll try better next time.\\".   Umm, no...see...there won't be a next time.

However, the service was really, really, very, painfully sloooow. \\n\\nThis was our second time here, we brought family from out of town with us this time. We were sat at a table that tilted at about a 28 degree angle because of a slant in the floor, (these slants run wild throughout the restaurant so be careful. But, this is the first time I have ever sat at a slanted table anywhere I felt like I was on Punk'd). So, it made keeping your drinks on the table difficult (we had three spills, two drinks and a side dish of mashed potatoes). It didn't help that they were slow about removing plates in the way and refills. My wife and her mom ordered fried chicken and asked for their fried chicken (a house specialty), to be prepared well done. It came back not as well done as they liked. The Server was fairly busy, but she didn't do an average job checking on us. When we finally told her about the chicken she said \\"All the chicken comes out the same way\\" something she should have said when they asked for it well done and extra crisp. \\n\\nWhen three of us got our food, my wife had to wait an extra ten minutes for her food to come out although she and her mom ordered the same thing besides the side items. She was upset because when it came out, the order was incomplete, (She is 39 1/2 weeks pregnant incidentally, which is why she asked for her chicken well done and was very hungry). She does not eat until her food is all on the table so she can eat the things she likes together. By the time her sides and bread came the chicken was cold and not cooked the way she liked. New mama was very disappointed. \\n\\nIf the restaurant management reads this, I hope they work on training staff to check on people more often, getting things right the first time, making people feel like they want a person's business (it is the hospitality business after all), being willing to go a little out of their way to please, because these are things essential to any service related business and it creates customer loyalty. Businesses have to learn to be better than their products. Good products are important, (in this case fried chicken and such) but good service execution makes a person add value to the product and want it again.

Ordered-me boneless wings with #2 buffalo sauce, side of blue cheese ($.69) , my daughter got a burger-extra $.79 for cheese, my husband great t wings - all drums which was extra. Food comes out-husbands aren't all drums, my buffalo sauce is very oily, and my daughters burger looks like a hockey puck. So, we eat and when you ur waitress brought the check I told her about not getting all drums which a was an extra charge. She apologized and brought the check -with no adjustment made for the extra charge.

My review for that business is on an entirely different website.\\n\\nI'll go ahead and post this review because I've eaten at 2UL enough that I have a pretty well-rounded and complete impression of the menu and service, but will likely have an update in a few months, as one would imagine that I'll have tried every item on their current menu by then. I'll also let it be known that, unlike most of the hip and stylish or business-attired folks filling the restaurant on any given night, I happen to have the privilege of getting all of my food at half-price, thanks to my undeniable suavit√©, or something to that effect.\\n\\nThe restaurant occupies an old industrial building, so the ceilings are high and the dining area expansive. Still, there has not been one night that I've eaten there when the entire place was not filled with the strong smell of smoke (from the kitchen). My hair and clothes reek of smoke every time I leave. Inside, the restaurant is dark and loud. Servers, hostesses and runners are constantly zipping to and fro, and this is a popular destination for large groups. You should call ahead for reservations (a near-certainty on weekends). Parking is valet-only, so I've never parked there. I typically will leave my car at either the Beltline skate park or Murder Kroger, or on Ralph McGill, and walk a couple of minutes along the Beltline trail to reach Two Urban Licks. Outside, there are two bocce courts for some pre- or post-meal entertainment. Restrooms are so dark that I'm not entirely sure I've been alone when using them.\\nService is a mixed bag. The wait staff tends to be excellent, but hindered by poor coordination and planning on the part of the organization as a whole (and I don't hesitate to use the term \\"organization\\" - I once walked into the place moments before 5:30, as the staff prepared to open, and there must have been forty or fifty people present). I usually have the pleasure of being served (not in a pants-off dance-off sort of way) by the ever-lovely Sky and a rotating assortment of 2-4 runners.\\n\\nNow... to paraphrase a certain woodpecker and bane of pretentious Swedish walruses everywhere... Food: My favorite dish. The menu at Two Urban Licks is divided into 4 sections, which have no titles but I'd list them as Starters, Small Plates, Large Plates, and Desserts. \\n\\nSo far, the recipes here are not so impressive. There are many good options, a couple of not-so-good, and some really good. Nothing life-changing. The calamari are salty, peppery, and more batter than squid. The prawns I ordered were quite good, until I sucked the insides from the heads of a couple of them and found that they were not fully cooked. Ever had cold, gooey shrimp brains in your mouth? The empanadas might be the best thing on the entire menu. Filled with brisket that's as tender as guacamole, they're absolutely delicious. The spicy Caesar salad is a nice attempt, but the romaine I received was about half a step above iceberg in quality and color. \\nLamb ribs are fantastic, but the sweetness becomes too much before finishing the helping. The mussels... well... they're mussels. I'm not a fan of them generally, but those at 2UL are no better or worse than those you'll find at most restaurants. The scallops are excellent - perfectly cooked - and go very well with the grits, but they're also served with a tomato sauce that doesn't fit. Not to mention the serving is three scallops, so at full price you're looking at about $8 per scallop. The duck is another excellent choice held back, this time by some Hoppin' John that doesn't pair well. The chicken is the only menu option I've seen thus far that might require a doggie bag. You get half a bird and enough mac & cheese to feed a bachelor for a week.\\nDesserts have let me down, somewhat. The chocolate cake is boring and nothing special, served with a room-temperature shot of vanilla milk. The peach ice cream sundae is probably the best item I've tasted so far. Keep in mind, also, that the desserts listed on the main menu may not be the full extent of what is available. There is a separate dessert menu featuring additional items.\\n\\nI hope my impression of the place improves in time, but I'm skeptical. If I were paying the full price for these meals, then there would have been only one or two items that had not totally disappointed. I'm looking forward to giving their steaks and pork a try, and hopeful that they'll sway my opinion.\\n\\nOverall, 5/10."},{"name":"Union Oyster House","address":"41 Union St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"one of the oldest restaurants in the country (try to be seated upstairs- cozy and quaint). \\noysters were fresh, salmon over rice pilaf was ok. besides the historical atmosphere- the place is average."},{"name":"Launderette","address":"2115 Holly St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"My favorite restaurant in Austin.

Let me say the food at cafe Broder is something like you've never had before it's delicious surprising and filling. I feel the quality and price are commiserate with one another. I've been here twice and the food was consistent both times. However I am giving them 2.5 stars because the server at my most recent brunch was so awful I will never bring friends here again. As anyone who's been here can attest to Broder usually has a bit of a line on the weekends. Which frankly I think is worth the wait because the food is so good. I had some friends in from Boisie ID who wanted to go to a great brunch place. We arrived and it took about 40mins to seat us which was 20 mins faster then we were told we'd have to wait. We were seated and our waiter came over. He asked if we knew what we wanted or if we'd need more time. We said we'd need time and my best friend who is a restaurant manager in Boisie asked for recommendations. The waiter was like \\" I dunno , umm a lot of people like this this and this\\" no explanation of what the food was, no questions about what her tastes were just a short unarticulated answer. Not terrible but no where near the awesome first experience we had with our waiter the first time my husband and I came. He then left after taking our drink orders and came back quickly and took our orders. We were a group of 8 obviously not related and he mentioned nothing about what their bill splitting policy was. We proceeded to eat our delicious meal of hashes lost eggs and spherical pancakes and as the consuming came to a close he dropped the check on our table. We asked if he could please split it. He responded with \\"we don't split checks 8 ways, our rule is 2 cards and cash for the rest.\\" This I feel was something he should have said when we sat down as a large group. He swiftly left the table and us who all had no cash to figure it out. After deliberating about how to do things he came back and asked if we were ready. We explained that only two of us had cash and the rest cards and attested that we really wished he would have said something to us when we sat down. Or heck! Someone could've said something during the 40 effing minute wait for a table!!! We asked if he could make an exception he said he could do one additional card. He then rudely mentioned that he didn't include gratuity on there and that he trusted us. Which my friend the restaurant manager mentioned was extremely tacky. After about another 35 mins (oh yes I timed it) we figured out how to spit it and paid. Having nearly forgotten the delicious food an pleasant company we'd just shared. Then the waiter had the nerve to mention how it was a small restaurant and people were waiting to be seated. If he'd just informed us ahead of time of the billing policy and or made an exception the extra time we had to take would have been avoided. Heck you probably could've seated another 4 parties in that time period. The asshole waiter basically ruined brunch with my friends and embarrassed me as i attested to how amazing this place was just before! So if you're the manager or owner and you read this you not only will be missing out on future business from my husband and I who've patroned your restaurant 2 time in the last month and would have made it a regular Saturday brunch stop but you've also missed out on the future business of me bringing my grandparents and parents little sister aunt uncle and cousins here on their various visits this summer as I had planned to do. We were really disappointed. And if the manager or owner read this and want the waiters name I saved the rect. and the tab with his initials on it. I'd post a pic but my goal was not to publicly shame him. I just want anyone that comes here to be aware of the billing rules for groups of 3 or more so that they won't have their brunch wrecked by incompetent service staff."},{"name":"Min-Ga Korean Restaurant","address":"800 Bethel Rd","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"This place is amazing!

Two examples of this: First,he asked if we wanted our picture taken, which I thought was really nice because it's awkward to ask. Second, my boyfriend and I ordered a crab cake appetizer to split. Without us even asking, the waiter told the kitchen to split it into two smaller crab cakes and put it on two different plates. That is some fantastic customer service if you ask me. For dinner, my bf and I both got steak which was also delicious. It was cooked perfectly and seemed to just melt in my mouth.

I eat there when I'm waiting for my vehicle to get serviced over at Goodyear, or taking a break from other downtown Lynn errands, and I try something different each time. The BBQ chicken is delish, and I wonder whether the leg is really from an ostrich or something, because I didn't think they could grow chickens that big to get a thigh/drumstick that huge.\\n\\nStuffed peppers were a tad overcooked so the peppers were pale and a little mushy, which is how I always expect them at any Brothers deli/restaurant, in any town, but there are two to a serving, the filling can be cooked forever and will still be tasty (rice/hamburg/a touch of herbs and spices), the size is generous and the sauce is yummy. With a mound of mashed spuds and cooked, sliced carrots, it's a big meal and I took a styrofoam box of it home and got two more meals out of it.\\n\\nThe desserts include Greek-style rice pudding that is creamy and not too sweet, and a selection of more humdrum stuff like Jell-o and commercially made cakes and pies. But so what. It's what you get in this sort of place, and it's fine.\\n\\nThe coolest thing about the Brothers in Lynn is that it seems to be the lunchtime hub for the local businessmen and the politicians from City Hall nearby. They all work each other's tables, shaking hands or air-kissing, hobnobbing, talking shop. One time I was there, the owner of a local lumber store was meeting with an aide from the governer's committee on low-cost housing, and they were talking about planning a public-service project. Then a couple of local bigwigs stopped by to schmooze, and at another table, a bunch of high-power City-Hallers were laying out their next strategy. It was like Brother's was the Roman Forum...er.. Greek Forum? :)"},{"name":"Highland Bakery Midtown","address":"1180 Peachtree St NE, Ste C","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"I had heard about Highland Bakery from a co-worker and she said wonderful things about it.

However, I also ordered a breakfast sandwich with egg and ham and I thought that was much better tasting. The service though was very slow and the waiter kept bringing out the wrong food. There weren't that many customers there, but they were too short on staff. I recommend that they hire more staff.

I want to prelude this review to state that the first time we came here, my boyfriend and I had a terrible experience.  I believe places deserve a second try.  \\n\\nTl;Dr: Ramen is perfect for a cold day. Expect long wait times.  The buns are amazing but a little expensive for my taste.  My sukiyaki bowl was a little thicker than I expected but still delicious. Overall, happy with the meal, even though the meal is a little more on the expensive side.\\n\\nWe came right after hurricane Irma. It was a cold and dreary type of day - perfect for ramen.   Due to previous experiences, I knew the wait would be long, so we tried to come here after the lunch rush.  We came around 1:30 pm, and it was still so busy. We had to wait for 30 minutes for a table.  Our group was a little shocked but we were fine with it.  The restaurant is very small, so it would be hard to get tables. \\n\\nThis is what our table ordered: 4 Jinya Bun.  The waitress took our order from a tablet, so our order came right after she left. It was so quick. Which was nice because we were so hungry.  I ordered the (new) sukiyaki, Cha cha cha (garlic lover), Tonkotsu Spicy (2x) and Jinya Tonkotsu Black.\\n\\nThe Jinya buns were very soft. The pork was very flavorful. It is kinda expensive. I would only get it if they had some kind of special on it. It is worth it, but I don't know if I want to spend $4 on just 1 bun. That's just me. The whole table loved theirs and it was gone before we knew it. \\n\\n\\nI was very excited about the sukiyaki ramen.  The dish itself is sweet - so I was excited to see what they were planning on doing with the dish.  I was pretty happy with it. I was longing for something in the dish, maybe some sweetness I was accustom too; but overall, I would get it again.  My egg was so nice.  It was a little cold, but it was cooked so nicely that the yolk was slightly runny yet still firm. It was my favorite.  This is a personal opinion, but I thought the broth was too thick and salty. Mine came with thin noodles, and I thought it was the perfect size. I did add nori to my soup. It was a thicker piece of nori.  My friend loved her Cha cha cha bowl. It was so much and we both couldn't finish our bowls.  The guys got the Tonkotsu, and my boyfriend's brother also got the Tonkotsu black.  I told them that if they save their soup - they could add more noodles. But I think that he was a little stubborn. They both ended up getting more noodles.   \\n\\nWaiting on the food didn't take long. The apps came very quickly. It was perfect for a cold day.

The pies were unbelievably good. Thin, fresh cheese, good sauce. We overindulged and ordered a large pie, along with a (half) spinach salad for me and an additional large slice for him. We also got some cheese balls- good but next time I'd stick with the pizza alone. We left stuffed and with lots of leftovers. \\nBesides with the extreme wait due to the popularity of HS, the only complaint I have is the leftovers. The pizza does not reheat well and does not taste good cold (my fave breakfast treat).

It was cute when you drive by but there never seem to be too many people (no line out of the door). But we tried it anyways and it was a pleasant surprise.\\n\\nFirst of all, there were tons of parking. This is not something you find very often along Howell Mill/Marietta Street. Not having to pay for parking? Great! Don't let the spots on the side of the restaurant fool you. There are at least 15 spots behind the back of it.\\n\\nWhen I first walked in, the decor reminded me of a modern arts museum. You have a diverse collection of paintings, light fixture, and furniture but all are related to France (or at least that's the attempt). It reminded me of Paris on Ponce but with pastry, coffee, sandwiches, soup, and salads.\\n\\nI ordered a chicken salad sandwich with a cup of the country vegetable soup. For dessert, I've ordered a cup of coffee and a small pecan tart. My wife order a turkey and brie sandwich with a berry & blue salad. She also had an apple tart and coffee for dessert.\\n\\nAs others have mentioned before, the chicken salad at this place was very good. It's more on the sweet side but quite refreshing (I know it's a weird description for a chicken salad). The croissant was not the best I've ever had, but it wasn't too bad (I thought it was a little too soft). The country vegetable soup was ok but the pecan tart was rich but not too sweet. I've had the house blend coffee, which was quite mild. According to my wife, her sandwich's brie and compote were great and the baugette was above board. She really enjoyed her salad because the ingredients were very fresh and the berries were very sweet.\\n\\nOverall, we enjoyed the ambience of the restaurant, the food was definitely good, parking was painless, and we definitely have to return and try out the rest of the menu. It is a great place to have a light breakfast/lunch/snack and just chat with your friends over a cup of coffee. But be careful, they only allow for one free refill. Also, the sandwiches are not that big even at full size so if you are a big guy, you probably will need something else to complement."},{"name":"Folk Art Restaurant","address":"465 N Highland Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Good is good but their system for their wait is questionable.

However, I have been thinking: \\"Let's give Anis a second chance.\\" Don't people always say everyone deserves a second chance or some crazy saying like that? After my visit today, once again proves to me that second chances can be so overrated \\n\\nLet's dive straight into what was good, what was so not good. \\n\\nSERVICE (4/5)\\nThe service was overall good. The host was friendly and hospitable. Our server Emily was attentive and helpful though I have to take off a point when the guys said they wanted the soup to come with their entr√©e. She brought the soup out for them before their entr√©e. She did come back and checked on us a few times.\\n\\nAMBIENCE (3/5)\\nIt was charming. I was not too sure if I like a view at the hair salon with a guy having his hair cut.

The plate of brioche-crusted Milanese chicken looked so sad. Doesn't whoever worked on my dish took pride in what he does? There was no presentation whatsoever on that plate in front of me.\\n* Perhaps if the restaurant uses a non-white plate, with some details, one may not noticed whoever prepared that chicken did not care about presentation.\\n\\nCroque Monsieur, Croque Saumon and Ham & Swiss Quiche - The rest do like their food, though they did not seemed to be completely wowed by them. Note the three dishes are hardly difficult to mess up.  \\n\\nSoup du jour was a mix of potato and tomato - The two who ordered said they were not bad, but they were just too bland. One even went on to say a soup at Panera tasted better than this. \\n\\nCr√®me Br√ªl√©e - I was so sad. This cr√®me br√ªl√©e ultimately decided that me and Anis can never have a love relationship. It was not mad love to begin with, but this cr√®me br√ªl√©e sealed our fate so we cannot even be friends. The cr√®me br√ªl√©e was not torched, it was like a flan.

I do not want to die just yet. \\n\\nThe cr√®me br√ªl√©e made me so sad and unhappy, I went to Amorino at The Shops Buckhead to cheer myself up with a gelato. \\n\\nMoving forward, you will not find me at Anis Bistro; that's a relationship that should not even have begun.

It was very good.  At first they were going to sit us against a wall in the middle of the room and it was a bit cramped with no light.  We moved to the windows and had a very nice roomy table with a view.  However, the wooden Windsor chairs are very small.  The men were uncomfortable since the seat was not big enough for them.  I am a small woman and only had about a half an inch on either side of me.\\n\\nThe food was delicious and very well presented.  We had oysters as appetizers.  The entrees were whole black sea bass, pork, and I had the lamb crudo as my entree.  All were very good.  Our servers were  excellent.  The wine was great.  The server did a good job suggesting glasses to go with my courses and he was right on.  \\n\\nI would definitely recommend Townsman, but I think they should change their chairs for better comfort (larger with upholstered seats?) and to maybe a color that goes better with the wall colors.  :)"},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Sorry for being a hater but this place is not worth the hype.... \\n\\nWe waited in line for about 30 minutes which is fine.

They're nothing special as far as doughnuts go. They taste like regular doughnuts ... maybe a bit sweeter. The voodoo man is only filled half way with the raspberry filling which left a bunch of dough left over. The mango tango was a weird combination of tart and sweet filling.

But we didn't have to wait long for a table for 4, it was maybe around 15 minutes.  It was the perfect day to eat outside so luckily we did score a table outside.  We were glad we did because when we went inside to use the bathroom, it felt really stuffy.  We all ordered the aebleskivers to share with lemon curd and lingonberry jam.  The lemon curd is highly recommended!  The lingonberry jam was not bad, but a little too light for my taste.  I can't say that I've had authentic aebleskivers before so I can't attest to the authenticity of the product, but it was very enjoyable with its slightly crispy exterior and light and fluffy interior.  These warm Danish pancakes don't have much taste by itself, so the sauces were a perfect addition.  I ordered the vegetarian hash, two of my friends ordered the smoked trout scramble, and another friend ordered the traditional hash.  The vegetarian hash was SO DELICIOUS!  I love that the potatoes were diced up much smaller than your usual hash.  It really allowed for the hash to have a crispy exterior and not just become a big pile of tasteless mush.  Seasoning was perfect, and my baked sunny-side up eggs were cooked just the way I liked them with a slightly runny egg yolk.  I wasn't a huge fan of the walnut toast...too hard and tasteless.

The only reason why this place didn't get 1 star is that their donuts are fairly cheap and not over priced, which they definitely could get away for. As a result, since Voodoo Doughnut is a Portland special and there are some unique flavors and shapes, it deserves 3 stars for recognition.

We had reservations but still had to wait approximately 15 minutes before we could even be seated.  The young girls at the front desk (greeters) were not very savvy with customer service:  they held conversations with themselves while customers stood at the desk waiting to be served.  They appeared to have no concern for a \\"paying\\" customer at all.  While standing at the desk waiting to be seated, I over heard a young lady and her friends come in for their reservation late but the restaurant cancelled their reservations after 15 minutes.  I understand there are policies and procedures in place but the lack of concern for the young lady and her friends was shocking.  However, after we were finally seated, the food and service from that point was good.  My second visit was this past weekend.  I had a reservation at 6 p.m. and saw that I was running late due to traffic and called the restaurant informing them that I was running late.  I spoke with Neff who assured me that she would go downstairs and handle it.  When I arrived to Scales, they cancelled the reservation and told me that they put me on the waiting list which was a 2 hour wait.  I was pissed and embarrassed because I had guests with me.  And once again there was no concern from the greeters at all.  A gentleman, by the name of Amir, walked by and asked if everything was ok.  I told him I was a little upset because of what happened.  He asked me to wait a few minutes to see what he could do.  Shortly after , he seated us.  I was very grateful, and from that point on the service was great!

No apologies no nothing it was basically hey do you want this soda cans for $2 & change you want a bottle water for $2 & change and of course the answers no. so our option is to go out to the car and get our bottle waters we had.

The reviews were mixed, but I was just excited to get pho delivered. I was disappointed. I ordered the spring rolls with pork and shrimp, they're very small and underwhelming with barely any pork wrapped inside. The peanut hoisin sauce is basically just hoisin sauce with crushed peanuts, most places make the peanut sauce... like a peanut sauce. The beef pho was terrible. Despite the 30 minute delivery from the time I ordered to the time it arrived, the soup was lukewarm at best, I ended up having to heat up the soup. The broth is just salty. That's all there is to it, no additional flavors just salt and msg. When I finally heated up my soup I put the bowl of pho together only to discover there were little eyelash hairs on one of the beef tendon pieces, as if it rolled over someone's face and collected it as it went. I understand that it's a restaurant and sometimes hair pieces can end up in food but this was the strangest way I've seen it happen. The bean sprouts and the jalape√±os that come on the side had this slimy feel to it, the vegetables were not fresh at all. Needless to say, it went into the trash. I'm not bothering to call the restaurant as it seems they don't take well with complaints, but I will never order from this restaurant again. The saving grace was the pork chops with rice. Hungry, sick and disappointed, the dish was able to fill my stomach. It says it comes with lettuce and cucumber, I'm expecting the usual amount of lettuce that comes on these plates... but I got literally one bite of lettuce and three cucumbers.

It was quite busy and there was only one metal hightop chair and a steel table at which we could stand only.  There were no chairs and the sign at the table actually said the table was for standing only.  We approached the register and were greeted by a staff member who informed us that there was a line to place an order.  Odd, because no one was standing in line.  Turns out, the grill was too busy, so the folks at the register were just telling people to have a drink and wait to place their orders until the grill was caught up.  \\n\\nOkay... where do I begin here?  I have no problem paying $10 for a good, grass fed burger or even $11 for one of their milkshakes, but there is no way I'm going to pay that much to eat at a glorified food stand.  There are cold metal tables and chairs (although not nearly enough chairs).  Take out isn't available, so the only option is to wait for a metal hightop chair in order to sit at the metal counter or stand at one of the metal tables.  Really?  I'm not going to pay to stand and eat my food at a restaurant.  Never.  Ever.  Also, the staff member at the register had a chance to take our order (and our money) right then and there.  We probably would have stayed, despite the lack luster atmosphere, but she wouldn't even take our order!  Instead, she insisted that we wait in order to order.  That's kinda dumb.\\n\\nI would recommend making the trek out to Cambridge to score a yummy, grass fed burger at Four Burgers.

We watched several people form new lines on the wrong end, only to become annoyed when they figure it out. The area you wait to pickup is tiny. \\n\\nRearrange the setup. You're also supposed to be able to sample soups first, but as a super busy lunch spot, this doesn't work. Having only a few employees who work very slowly ruins an already bad system. It should not take more than a couple minutes to receive an order of soup, when the soup is sitting in a pot a few feet away, ready to go. \\n\\nLastly, this place needs music.

After my experience, I feel that \\"Voodoo\\" stands for \\"Very Overtly Obvious Discrimination Of Other.\\"\\n\\nDoughnuts: They have a wide variety of interesting combinations ranging from sugar-rush-inducing cereal or candy toppings to your run-of-the-mill cream/jelly filled doughnuts . The taste of the doughnut itself is typical, nothing special - it's the toppings that make their doughnuts unique.  If you go, I would recommend the Bacon Maple Bar doughnut (there are two slices of real bacon). Overall, nothing to write home about, and certainly more hype than yumminess.\\n\\nAmbiance: Located in a less... delectable part of the city, be prepared to see some establishments not suitable for young eyes.  It's a small location that serves its purpose.  There's a small small standing table along one of the walls where you can eat your doughnuts if you don't want to walk around them.\\n\\nService: Insulting. I had read that sometimes the servers can be terse, but my friend and I were treated differently because of the color of our skin.  Our encounter: My friend told the brunette woman behind the counter that this was our first time in Portland in hopes of hearing a little bit about the menu, but we received a stony stare.  I thought to myself \\"maybe she's having a long/bad day,\\" and asked what were her favorites.  She pointed to a couple with lackluster effort, and my friend and I just ordered three doughnuts to try.  Our server then proceeded to give us our doughnuts in those little parchment paper slips.  I thought it was weird because other people had gotten little baggies, but maybe it's because we only ordered three. What I saw afterwards made my blood boil.  The two women who were behind us - who were Caucasian - were treated COMPLETELY differently.  They were chatted up (by the same server) with friendly smile and fanfare (and no, I don't think they were the server's friends), and while they only ordered two doughnuts, they received each one in a separate bag (without being asked).  When I went up to ask for a bag, I got an impatient look (there were no other customers) and a reluctant one bag.  While Voodoo probably doesn't need to care that much about customer service due to its large patronage, I would hope they would at least catch up to the 21st century and not practice discrimination.\\n\\nPricing: Reasonable.

In that respect it seems to be trying a little too hard to be special, which they must  hope will distract customers from some less than special menu items. \\n\\nBecause I went here with my rather large family, I got to sample almost every item on that night's menu. Nearly every entree item seemed to be overspiced or made with mediocre ingredients. If this restaurant wants to survive they should focus on their tapas-style appetizers and accompaniments.  \\n\\nI took one look at the menu and decided to only order appetizers for myself, which with worth it. The lamp lollipops with goat cheese and grape chili were particularly unique and delicious. The highlights were some of the entree accompaniments I sampled. The garlic bread with a rich buttery sauce was the best I have ever had and the gouda grits were quite good as well. Desserts were good, but nothing special. \\n\\nOverall this is a pricey place and if you want your money to go furthest, opt for appetizers and even try asking for some of the accompaniments without their entrees."},{"name":"Blitz Pearl","address":"110 NW 10th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3","text":"The dart boards where absolutely awful, the drinks are expensive, and, worst of all, one of the doors in the women's restroom doesn't close completely, meeting there was a three inch gap between the door and the wall.

Being a Steveston local, i was aware of which establishments were tourist traps (basically anything on the waterfront, if you were curious) but it was the best choice that day. We had originally planned to go to Moncton Cafe but we found that they had been shuttered. \\n\\nSeated and armed with menus, she and I immediately noticed that the prices were on the higher side. Not a very large selection either but we settled on fish tacos and mussels, $15.20 and $16.85 respectively. The fish tacos should really be renamed pepper tacos, because it was just a small piece of cajun-spiced fish buried under a mountain of sliced red peppers. Came with some sort of possibly bottles salsa verde but I personally would have preferred guac for better balance. Unremarkable flavors; discarded most of rhe peppers. The mussels, fortunately, were very good and in a delicious cream sauce. However, I found the cup of fries that came with it a bit of a mismatch. Perhaps a good chunk of bread would be better suited to dipping in the wonderful sauce. \\n\\nWe left feeling unsatisfied and slunk off to Timothy's for dessert. Funnily enough, the experience at Blue Canoe was not far from my initial expectation - faddish overpriced plates in small portions and forgettable flavors.

Then my husband ordered a $14 glass of wine and it was half of the pour size it should have been. We ordered our appetizers and they came out faster than if it was a Mexican restaurant. For a cassoulet and a giant lamb shank, that's alarming and tells me the food was all pre-prepared and just being warmed up before it came out. We also paid an extra $3 for bread service- the service consisted of sliced focaccia. If I'm paying extra for bread, I'm think there'd be a variety and it would be amazing. Lastly, dessert. The only option this night was truffles. We ordered 4 to go. They were $4 a piece and about the size of a dime.\\nOverall, I'd say they were set up for speed and turning tables since it was Valentine's Day.

However, my thoughts while sitting there were more like \\"wow, I really hate this place. I don't know how I didn't realize how much I hated it for so long.\\"\\nFor the most part, I like the food. There are some menu items I enjoy that I have not found elsewhere or been able to reciprocate in my own kitchen. But when you go to a restaurant and the food quality is inconsistent, good food is simply not enough for me to return. \\nWe visited this afternoon and I'm pretty sure it was the end of our server's shift when we arrived. She was clearly unhappy to see us seated in her section. Her greeting was a very blunt \\"Can I get you something to drink?\\" Literally not even a \\"hello.\\" A few minutes later, she came back, dropped off the drinks and said \\"Can I take your order?\\" We weren't ready, so of course she waited a very long time to come back and approached us with \\"Are you ready for me now?\\" Such a bitch, really!! \\nNext, it took an entire 20 minutes to receive our food. The restaurant was absolutely not busy but the employees certainly were. Not busy working, but busy socializing, including the manager. Having worked in customer service for many years myself, I am very understanding about slow service when they are actually busy, but when they are socializing right in front of me and we are starving, getting through our second basket of chips, it really is not acceptable. \\nOur food had clearly been sitting under a heating lamp for too long. My son's nachos were really gross and dry. When I worked there, we used to joke that Taco Bell food is better than Chevys, but after our experience today I honestly don't think we were joking!\\nWe finally were served our food by a second server. There was never a greeting from her, either. I don't know, maybe I just appear unapproachable? Has never been a problem before but these servers sure didn't seem to like us.\\nAfter a whole hour sitting at this place, the server finally decided to drop off our check, and the bill came to $29 and some change. I gave her 2 $20 bills, as I had no smaller bills. I think as a server it should be common sense that if someone pays you in big bills it's because they don't have smaller bills. So numb nuts comes back with my change, a $10 bill! DUH. Remember, I did not have small bills to pay with, so how am I going to tip now, with this $10? Maybe she really was dense enough to expect me to leave a $10 tip on a $30 bill after receiving terrible service?? And I wasn't about to ask her to break the $10 bill because considering all else, that likely would have cost me another 10 minutes of wasted time.\\nThere was a time when I used to care enough to try to talk to the manager and explain the situation so maybe they could work on improvement, but this disaster of an establishment is beyond saving. I simply put my $10 back in my wallet (I almost ALWAYS tip well, so it has to be extremely bad for me to stiff a server) and made my exit, with no intention to ever return!"},{"name":"Home Slice Pizza","address":"1415 S Congress St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Quintessential Austin.

Ordered the roasted okra and marinated olives, paired with two glasses of Sangiovese and Merlot Blend. The roasted Okra was out of this world, smoky, yet did not take over the dish while the Okra was perfectly cooked. Olives were marinated in a wonderful sauce, so good that we ordered another bowl! Sangiovese was a great pairing and was well worth the prices, but honestly the Merlot Blend I could of done without as it was not the best red I have had. Main course consisted of Fennel Sausage pizza (Shared) which was recommended by the bartender. I am in no way a pizza connoisseur, but the pizza was pretty darn good.

I wasn't a fan, but it's apparently a favorite. \\n\\nI went for lunch today and was again disappointed.

We are still waiting for our food.  After waiting for an hour (it IS Friday night, so we waited a while before calling), we were told that the driver \\"is stuck in traffic and will be there soon\\".

My burger, which was only 5oz, was $9 and that did not include any sides. I think a basic cheeseburger is $7, but they charge extra for every topping, even seemingly basic ones like lettuce, tomato and mayo (ketchup and mustard is included). A side of fries is another $4. Oddly enough, though, the beers are entirely reasonably priced, with Miller High Life at $3 and a small but eclectic selection of microbrews at $4 or $5.\\n\\nYes, it was a good burger, but not so overwhelming that I'd pay that much for it again.

Having a child stuck in a high chair can be great, but once they are expected to sit there while the grown ups chat for an hour, there isn't a lot of room for them to get antsy. And the other customers here probably aren't as laid back to be cool about it."},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Not a bad doughnut!

I was actually relieved as I really didn't want to sit down and eat. I ordered my pizza and was asked if I would like to get something to drink as it would be about 25 minutes. What 25 minutes? Ok, whatever I already paid. I let them know I was going to run and errand and would return. \\n\\nWhen I got back my pizza STILL was not fully cooked. What's up with that?? At this point I'm thinking what a lame ass pizza place. \\n\\nAt last my pizza is done. Ok, it really could have used a couple more minutes in the oven but I think I was rushing them. They sliced it and box it up for me. All is normal. Then they hand it to me, holy cow, I nearly dropped it. I weighed a ton. Seriously, my 12\\" pizza was really heavy. The employee joked, this isn't Dominos, we actually use real crust and lots of toppings. He wasn't kidding. \\n\\nOn the way home I decided to open the box and have a couple pieces of topping. I have never seen a pizza with so much topping, I got a half peperoni and half some sort of combo. I ate toppings during my 15 minute drive home. You couldn't tell that there were any gone when I got home that's how covered my pizza was. I'm sure I ate half a pound of sausage and peperoni off my pizza before I got home. when I got home I only managed to eat two slices as I was so full from the toppings. When my wife got home she had a couple slices and commented how much stuff there was on the pizza. Only then did I tell her how much I already ate. \\n\\nThe interior of the restaurant was spotless. The staff was very friendly. And for future use there is tons of parking. They also have 20 plus beers on tap. \\n\\nI will return with my family to eat and have a couple beers with my pizza.

And it's not just because of the doughnuts -- it's the whole \\"Voodoo\\" experience.\\n\\nDon't let the line steer you away from the doughnutty fun. It's a long line, but it keeps moving, so unless you go to Voodoo on a really bad day, you will only have to wait half an hour to an hour or so. \\n\\nPeople-watching helps pass the time spent waiting in line. For instance, a man wearing a kilt and a darth vader mask rode around on his unicycle and played the Star Wars theme on his bagpipes for the folks waiting in line. Definitely entertaining. \\n\\nThe shop itself is pretty small. Some of the employees are a little testy since they have to deal with tourists day in, day out, so don't get snappy with them.\\n\\nSo admire the glorious revolving doughnut displays instead as well as the quirky merchandise hanging from the walls. That giant doughnut? Go ahead, embrace your inner tourist and take a photo with it. But remember -- figure out what you want to order first because there is a lot to choose from and only so much time before you get to the counter.\\n\\nWe were pretty tame when it came to ordering. We decided to get the Voodoo Doll, the Dirty Snowball, the Bacon Maple Bar and the Grape Ape. It was raining by the time we got out, so we ran over to the nearest cafe to sample the sweets.\\n\\nThese doughnuts are not meant to be the most delicious doughnuts, but they certainly are one-of-a-kind (and still pretty tasty). The Voodoo Doll, for example, is filled with deliciously sinful raspberry jelly. The Bacon Maple Bar was not as fresh as it could have been, but the combination of crispy bacon atop sweet maple frosting was just too good.\\n\\nMy only regret, however, was that I did not do enough research on Voodoo doughnuts. I knew there were a bunch of doughnuts I wanted to try, but I had forgotten the names of them so I didn't get around to eating all of them. :("},{"name":"Miller's Ale House - Kirkman Rd","address":"5573 S Kirkman Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"3","text":"I go to Ale Houses all over central fl, and have noticed they all allow their cooks to have beards which contaminates your food with facial hair and droppings when they scratch their face while preparing food....GROSS!!"},{"name":"Not Your Average Joe's","address":"4C Wayside Rd","city":"Burlington","stars":"3.5","text":"No one else has made this joke yet?

Do not be fooled- it is not a quinoa bowl with veggies and a greek yogurt topping. Apparently what I envisioned was amateur hour. This dish is beautifully laid out to maximize the color in the plate.

As for the side dishes (kimchi, potatoes, seaweed, bean sprouts).....they never bring enough. Oddly, this is some of my favourite parts of Korean Food.

I generally struggle to recognize the items on the menu as nothing sounds familiar.  Ordered some lunch dish that supposedly was a chicken leg something rather...  Food delivered in quick 15 minutes, making it 1:15 and having a meeting at 1:30 at my nearby office made it impossible for me to stay and eat there, so I asked it packed up and my colleagues had to bring it to the office for me.  It's a shame that my experience was colored by this \\"too chill to take your orders on time\\" attitude.  Did I mention that it was so LOUD in there that it was impossible to hear anyone at your table speak?  ...Had my \\"chicken leg\\" - it appeared to be some type of pasta with cheese and maybe some ground-up chicken meat in it?  does not seem like that was what I ordered, however I saw that was exactly what was delivered to the table for me so there was no confusion on my colleagues' part.

When I ordered my sweet tea and asked for my usual \\"lots of lemon\\", he told me that they charged for extra lemons. I laughed, assuming it was a joke, and then realized he was dead serious. When i asked why, he said it was because too many patrons had asked for extra lemons with their water and used it to make lemonade. I stared at him incredulously and found myself at a loss of words. Finally, to end the awkward silence, he offered to bring me the lemons.\\n\\nAnd then there is the food. Lots of bland fried food. I love fried food, but it needs seasoning.

Some drinks do have dairy in them, and pisco sour traditionally contains egg), the waiter answered kindly, and from then on, everyone who put a dish in front of me gently and helpfully said, \\"Here's your beverage... vegan!\\" or \\"Here's that salad... minus cheese!\\" \\nMy dad owned a restaurant for 25 years so he is very picky about customer service, so everyone was very happy that our waiter was very knowledgeable and professional. We came here the night before Thanksgiving, so it was a little crowded, but we made a reservation for nine people upstairs and had a wonderful meal. Our mixed crowd ordered vegetarian, vegan, and meat dishes, and everyone was so very happy with the food and the service.

I had the same server who is great at what he does. He always greets you with a smile and very helpful. The fried chicken with the lobster Mac n cheese is very good. This was the first time I didn't indulge in an alcoholic beverage, so I tried the lavender lemonade. It was very tart so be careful if you don't like tart drinks. There is always a wait, especially for lunch so I suggest making reservations or sitting at the bar area. I've sat in the main dining room area and also in the patio area. The patio area is extremely nice when they open the doors/ windows and let a breeze come through. Parking is horrible. I circled the block at least three times.

Wifi. Overall, we had a pretty nice time.\\n\\nCons- No tabs/wristbands/stamps of any kind for the bar, we were asked for IDs multiple times by several different people each time we tried to get a drink. The bartender (who was the owner) smirked and made comments about my (nearly 30 year old) friend's ID photos looking fake and almost didn't serve them. Who looks exactly the same as they did in a photo taken 5+ years ago? \\n\\nAnd the biggest flaw of the evening, feeling like the bar area is a playground. The children's area is about 35 feet away with no enclosed 21+ area, so the two hours we were there were spent listening to constant screaming children run around our table and run up to the bar and grab at the wine bottles. I appreciate the family friendliness of the joint, but a small separate area for adults to sit and have a drink without being surrounded by screaming babies is necessary. \\n\\nNot even to mention the owner's poorly spelled insults hurled at the person who left a less-than 5 star review on Facebook. \\n\\nOverall, we're happy this business is in town and we will return, but our initial visit left a bitter taste in our mouths as we drove down the street to Valley Growlers to enjoy a beer in peace."},{"name":"River Bar","address":"661 Assembly Row","city":"Somerville","stars":"3","text":"I've been here for drinks a few times and dinner once.

My friend and I actually ordered the same thing and I realized after we ordered that they never asked how we wanted our burgers cooked. It came out pretty well done, which isn't what I expect most people like, but somehow it was surprisingly juicy still. Too juicy even, because I didn't eat the bottom bun on the second half because it was just soaked through and soggy. The flavors on the burger were great though. I really liked the bacon spring rolls, but they didn't taste very bacon-y to me.

A bakery claiming to be what I know as the best bakery in Charlotte, 250 miles from NoDa? This is clearly a mistake, and I have just the palate to find out! You could very well consider me a regular at not only the original store, but the other three Charlotte locations as well. I think I'm about as close to a certified & bonafide Am√©lie's expert as it gets (#humblebrag)!\\n\\nLet's start off with decor: Sitting right beside the Georgia Tech campus and within comfortable distance to the Aquarium, it definitely matches the Charlotte joints in terms of trendy locations. Inside, your eyes are quickly drawn to the French style artwork and the Am√©lie's signature chandelier, made from stainless steel measuring cups, whisks, and pans. The vintage tables adjacent to the blue striped walls are definitely reminding me of home. So they look the part, how's the food?\\n\\nLunchtime on a chilly Monday afternoon. One winner I've gotten at every Am√©lie's in the QC is the Chicken Salad croissant, so that's what we're going with today. I also opted for a side of Tomato & Lentil soup and some sweets for the drive back home. My lunch came out quickly, served by a friendly young man, and I was quick to dig right in. Two words: Instant gratification! One bite and I knew that this place is the real deal. I've had croissants that are very flaky, and some that have a rich, tender crumb, but rarely do you get both at the same time! Chicken salad was indistinguishable from my favorite hometown cafe; moist chicken, slightly sweet dressing, rich undertones... what a delight.\\n\\nThe soup was great as well. Served hot, hearty seasoning, and it had many complimentary veggies added in. I imagined this would work well in the summer too, maybe lightly pulsed with an immersion blender and served cold as a refreshing gazpacho (go ahead and steal my idea, you're welcome!).\\n\\nStaff was on point, the girl tending the pastry case was very friendly. I asked her what her favorite item in the case was and she pointed out a Cranberry/Pistachio macaron that I hadn't tried before, so I took it for the road. Whoever sat down and thought those two flavor profiles would work must have some otherworldly culinary insight because I wasn't sold....at least not until that first bite. Somehow the cranberry tartness perfectly segues into the more subtle nuttiness of pistachio (that had the unmistakable qualities of the similar petit four) that creates this amazing succulent melody of flavor.\\n\\nCould it be that my dear Am√©lie's has indeed taken solid root in The Big A? I give this place my seal of overwhelming approval! \\n\\nNow, was it perfect? Ok.. I'm going to nitpick real quick: The macarons in the display case, they weren't as 'technically perfect' as the ones you'll find in Charlotte. Just a few that we're slightly mis-shaped and a few surface cracks... This is coming from a self-proclaimed pastry snob who was classroom trained by a professional on French macaron technique and let me tell you, it ain't easy making perfect yields! To just about anyone else, this would probably be unnoticeable.  Also, the salted caramel brownies were missing their usual sheen. I ordered one and the bottom layer was just ever so slightly lacking the chew it usually has... I think both of these could have been caused by how dry the air was this morning (especially with the macarons). Again, nitpicking here. I've written so much praise I figured I needed to instill just a little room for improvement. The flavors were spot on all the same.\\n\\nSo no, it wasn't perfect, but who IS perfect all the time? The real question for me is: \\"Does this place, a whopping 4 hours away from home, immerse you in the same warm, welcoming, delicious, and unique setting that the Charlotte bakeries manage every single time?\\" The answer is yes!\\n\\n...And with that, my avocation to visit, review, and savor every Am√©lie's location is finally complete! Next time I visit ATL, I'm so glad to have a meaningful part of home nearby. Until next time.. au revior!!"},{"name":"Union Oyster House","address":"41 Union St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"The oldest operating restaurant in the country.

As it turns out, we were approached by a 20-something woman who stressed by the crowd. She says the wait is an hour, hour and a half, I have no way of knowing. She then asked if we had a preference for a table , bar or first available. We said first available. We were pushed into a tiny corner and waited and waited and waited. About 40 minutes later she comes up to us and said \\"I'm going to seat you at a shared table\\". We both said that is not acceptable as we are not that type of person.

However, don't quote me on that since we came during off-peak hours. We started our meal with the Jinya Buns, which I believe warrants a must-get status. Tender pork in a delicious sauce cooked to perfection then served on a fluffy flower bun.\\n\\nI chose the Cha Cha Cha bowl as my main since I'm a fan of pork broth (if you prefer something lighter, go with the chicken broth), I then added on the curry rice & salad for $5.50 more because I figured since I skipped lunch this should be just enough food. WRONG, my ramen came and it is a HUGE serving! Not that I'm complaining of course! The noodles were a bit undercooked, but the broth was amazingly rich and delicious. The Cha Cha Cha bowl is ideal if you're a garlic lover, it's topped with lots of bean sprouts, tender pork and the most important thing in any good ramen: a perfectly cooked egg. \\n\\nThe ramen was good and fulfilling I ended up taking the curry rice home because I simply didn't have anymore room in my stomach. Given the quality and portion, it is absolutely worth the price tag imho.\\n\\nOur waitress was wonderful, she was quick with service and checked on us throughout the meal.

Yes, you read that right. Their specialty.  So, the \\"cock\\" part of their doughnut is a twisted doughnut with chocolate on top.

The dish also came with a complimentary hot beverage, but I upgraded my drink to a cold milk green tea for an extra $2. Please note that these specials are only offered from 11:30am to 5pm. \\n\\nI was wondering why the waitress never asked me how I liked my steak cooked when she took my order.

BUT, despite the thinness, the steak itself was very wide and broad as you can see in the photos. The peppercorn gravy I specified made the steak appetizing despite not being cooked my preferred rare.  The platter was enough to make me full as it was served with rice and assorted veggies including broccoli.\\n\\nThe tea tasted somewhat synthetic. I had ordered a Mango Green Tea, but there was no evidence that a fresh mango had been sacrificed in its preparation.

I had the Southern Belle (Blackened, split Vienna Beef Hot Polish link dressed with pimento cheese, fried green tomatoes, Cajun Remoulade and scallions), which wasn't as tasty as it looked.

I decided to go here because I got a gift card for it. But their system wasn't working on the day for them to be able to accept gift cards, but credit card transactions went through (hmm... weird). So we ended up paying about $50 for a breakfast meal for 2 people. Also, we went in around 10.30am and had to wait in line for half an hour or so. But it was a nice day thankfully, so the wait wasn't bad. The annoying part is that once you get inside the place and are still waiting in line, your butt is next to other people's face. Eek!\\n\\nWe ordered Boston Cream Pancakes, Chorizo Omelet and Avocado Sunrise. The omelette and sandwich came with potato wedges that were simply delicious. I guess you can't really mess up fried potatoes. The Avocado Sunrise sandwich was made pretty well. Their bride slices are HUGE as is the quantity of food per plate. The eggs were cooked just right. I like it when the yolk oozes out when I cut/bite into the sandwich. The avocado tasted like it had been exposed to air for too long. You'll know what I'm talking about if you ate a brown avocado, that has been exposed to air, because even though it won't taste good it's expensive so you're going to eat it. I'g dive my sandwich a 3 out of 5. The chorizo omelet was pretty good. Regular omelet; that I am not a fan of to begin with so I'm not going to be unfair and give it a low rating. The pancakes felt like a total rip off. Because it has the words \\"Boston Cream\\" in the title , I expected either the pancake to be stuffed with custard or have a good layer of it between the pancakes. Their version was created with some custard between the last 2 pancakes (the plate had a total of 3). Notice how I said \\"some\\". There definitely wasn't enough. Because they have an open kitchen you can see them making everyone's food. When I was waiting in line to place my order I saw the guy use a huge can of whipped cream and put a generous amount on other plates. Unfortunately, mine did not have enough. It had one sorry blob on it that looked like he ran out of whipped cream in that can and did not wait to add more to my plate from the new can. And I take my whipped cream quantities VERY seriously. That and powdered sugar.\\n\\nAll in all, it was a pretty OK experience. Since I didn't get a chance to use my gift card and I don't want it to go to waste, I will go back and give this place another chance (the guy better give me more whipped cream this time).

I can only imagine the skyrocketing property taxes of the families who've lived for generations in this area of town previously thought undesirable.

Ooo weee!\\n\\nMy lunch companion is well-versed in all kinds of cuisines, loves a solid (insert French wine name I can't pronounce but she can here) and was raised with enough sense to know this fried chicken is sadly under-seasoned. It was the last order so we pounced on it, but meh. Chappelle said it and it's true: fried chicken is just damn tasty. I'm no expert, but isn't the breading an opportunity to incorporate more spices? Something like garlic, pepper, paprika? The meat was juicy, but we had to ask for black pepper and used it liberally. Bear in mind that I've told my honey that he puts too much pepper on our eggs when he's cooking them, so I'm not a crazy pepper liberal or anything.\\n\\nThe frites were tasty, though we weren't sure what the orange water-sauce was that came with them. I suggested that it was ground up frites with water because our frites only tasted soggier when we dipped them in this thing. Zero flavor upgrade. We also shared a burger which came with sauce, cheese and pickles. I mean some really good cheese and really delicious, likely housemade pickles, but it was just those two guys trying to make sense of a burger. The burger was small and it was just fine. They hadn't asked how we wanted the meat prepared but whatever.\\n\\nThey got me with the beverages. The eastside-something drink with gin was a refreshing gift and the corpse reviver was just as delightful.\\n\\nIf it's on someone's list of places to try, I'd give Launderette another go.

When we called in to make a reservation for 3, the boss or whoever is at the cashier desk picked up the call with an extreme fresh attitude.  I'm Cantonese so I know haha.  \\nWhen we sat down,. I hear the waiters talking smack in Cantonese (Chinese) about the customers already!  It was unusually quiet at the restaurant this time.... Maybe they have nothing to do?  Then the owner got into a heated debate with a customer who was complaining about their party of 12 was being ignored by the server's.  The owner said was like yea, you deserved to be ignored. WOW.... He didn't care at all. By the end of our dinner we asked a simple question if we can order a twin garlic lobster to go?  Mind you, we spent over $120 on this meal.  It's not like we ordered one dish.  The owner said only if you order an additional side dish with the twin lobsters or else we'll eat banana.  In Cantonese, that's a very rude and sarcastic comment.  That left a bad impression and we decided to go.  If the owner was professional he could've said sorry you would have to order an additional dish to it and not add the eat banana comment.  When we were about to leave a lady from another booth said to one of the server's... \\"In order to get respect, you gotta give respect.\\". The server didn't care.  I guess that's the norm in this restaurant.  Bad attitude.  If you're a foreigner, they'll smile in your face but talk smack about you when you leave and in their native tongue when you're there.

The fact that the pasta is made fresh and was cooked perfectly offered a texture that paired perfectly w/ the sauce (supplemented by the soft poached egg yolk). \\n\\nThe service was also a pleasant surprise.

However... Maluken is getting 2 stars for a very good reason: karaokeus interruptus.\\n\\nThe plusses: They offer bottles of Choya plum wine, complete with drunken plums at the bottom, which is one of my favorite drinks.\\n\\nThe drawbacks: They have only one kind of sake and it's hot, so not very high quality there. They also do not always list if a type of sushi has panko crunchies in it, so beware if you're gluten intolerant. And the biggest drawback of all? Karaoke was listed as from 9pm-1am and instead went from 10:15pm-11:30pm. Without any warning, the machine was turned off and karaoke was over, not to mention last call hit at 10 freakin' 30.\\n \\nIf you're looking for a place with decent sushi where you can sling back some beers with your dudes, you're in for a good time.

Our server was fantastic.  The interior is nice and open. These are the only 2 good things about the place.\\n\\nThey charge $3 and $3.50 for oysters now when oysters are in season.  That's a total rip off.  They also over sauce all of their dishes which is a clear indicator that the quality of the food isn't as great as they try to make it appear.  You can tell because this is an semi-upscale joint that serves Tilapia, probably one of the most cheapest fishes you can buy wholesale.  My friend ordered the Tilapia and I ordered the Short Ribs, better rephrase that to short rib since it was only 1 pathetic piece of meat that was over sauced and  looked very familiar to the Korean Short Rib dish that I eat all the time.  They charge $25 for this dish. At a Korean restaurant you can order a whole pan full of this for $25 and it'll come with about 3 or 4 pieces, not just one, and it won't be over sauced.  We did have the Beignet style hush puppies, which were awesome.  Being form New Orleans I always respect a New Orleans style or flavored dish. \\n\\nNow everything above was not that big a deal since my friend decided to pay for us. We had a group of 5 friends and she was in town for the holidays and decided to treat us because of her new job and new digs in Chicago.  \\n\\nNo the real complaint comes when I buy my friends a round of drinks.  Only 4 since 1 guy is a moron and can't drink BC he has 2 dui's.  So I order 4 Patrons.  The bartender says they don't have Patron.  So I ask, what do you have similar to Patron, he replies with Don Julio.  So I order 4 shots of Don Julio.  Very smooth until I got my check.  $53 for 4 shots of Don Julio.  I'm sorry, but is this a restaurant or a club?  \\n\\nI know most of my complaints about this place is about the price, but I'm a dude trying to ball on a budget, not live like a spendthrift like most of The Optimist's customers.  Also when you compensate quality with sauces, then that tells me the quality of food is not that great, unless of course the dish warrants such saucing.  If you don't mind paying $3 or $3.5 for an oyster that tells me you're a spendthrift.  \\n\\nSo I checked in on my Yelp App which is connected to my Twitter feed.  They tweeted me a few days later thanking me for checking in.  Everything above was mentioned.  So they tweeted back with this generic response: \\n@roylee1 Sorry to hear you weren't pleased with your experience - please call a manager at 404-477-6260 if you would like to discuss further\\n\\nActually I really don't want to discuss any further.  I was planning on giving them another shot, but when you respond with less personality then a mannequin then I'm assuming you really don't care.  I also don't like to be treated better after the fact, but if you look at my whole post you won't see a complaint about the service, because it was great.

I saw many amazing reviews so I thought it would be a great first experience.  Boy, was I wrong.  We had tables upstairs, which isn't the worst thing, although it would have been nice to have the option or have been asked if being upstairs would have been okay versus being downstairs where you can actually hear the music.  My biggest complaint was the service.  I am someone that tips 20% everywhere I go, restaurants, nail salon, hair salon etc.  Last night, I was so disgusted with service I wanted to put a fat X on the tip line.  After we were served our food, our waiter AND waitress (yes we had two) practically vanished.  We had to flag them down to get refills on water. Twice. Really?!  They only gave us 2 dessert menus, although there were 4 of us, but the crazy part they didn't even say anything about desserts, they just sat them down and vanished for a good 15-20 minutes.  It was really weird actually.  We were all so displeased with service that we did not even toy with trying to order desserts.  The only reason why I gave 2 stars is due to the food being good.  Furthermore, I just saw the review from Nanette on 6/18/15 and realize that maybe the service is due to the manager, since he doesn't seem to give a crap about customer service.

I suspect  every city has places like Voodoo: long lines, great conversation, distinctive signage and a location that allows for people watching.  It reminds me of Pink's hot dogs in L.A.  While we waited for over an hour, it went quickly and it was fun.  Once inside, the place was bright and pink (while I expected dark and foreboding, based on the name).\\n\\nThe line is long and I suspect the employees have to deal with upset, impatient customers all the time, but they (the employees) were cheerful, welcoming, explained the menu and the doughnuts, quick to get my order ready, and even chatted with me for a minute--not rushing me out.  The experience alone would make the trip worthwhile, even if their doughnuts were not excellent.  There are benches outside, which we shared with other tourists while chatting and comparing our choices.  People outside, unwilling to brave an hour's line, ask if they can take a picture of your doughnuts.\\n\\nWe had the cock and balls (terrible name for an awesome doughnut) filled with creamy goodness and covered in chocolate.  Messy, sticky, delicious.  Nothing out of the ordinary, though.  We also had the bacon doughnut, which sounds weird, but maple glaze and bacon? isn't this on your breakfast table when you're feeling self-destructive and have pancakes and bacon?  The glaze is syrupy.  The bacon is yummy.  This is as close to a breakfast doughnut as one can hope to find.  We also had a strange, fruit-loops covered thing that the kids would love (though most people outside eating them were in their 20's).\\n\\nFor a doughnut place, it's expensive.  For the experience it provides, it's super cheap.  This was my first time there, but I'll make sure to become a regular now.\\n\\nBy the way, if heading down to the carts/downtown/etc., park at Pine and Fifth in the parking structure.  $3.50 all day on weekends!

Short story - I wish I had gotten hers. While my dish was reasonably tasty, I wonder what chef thinks that a brown seafood casserole looks appetizing. Because it does not. You eat with the eyes first, right? So it looked like beef stew. It was ok but I wouldn't get it again. And, frankly, due to their lack of entrees (monkfish? no swordfish, no scallops) there weren't a lot of alternatives. \\n\\nWe did have about 8 or so excellent oysters, shared a tasty salad and had a couple of nice, warmed mulled wines. \\n\\nSo, I wanted to love this place but largely due to my entree, only liked it.

There are definitely a lot of different flavors and combos, but their glazed one seemed the best to us at the time. It was alright at best. Not very fresh and kind of blah...right away I thought to myself \\"I'd rather have a Krispy Kreme.\\" If you want to get a fancier donut though, then I recommend coming here just for the experience.

Fantastic service and wonderful atmosphere! The only thing I have to say was the valet was very disappointing. I believe it was Sunshine Valet company. The valet did not give us a ticket and did not open my passenger door for me which is usually expected. Then, when we came out, he didn't even pull our car out, he just told us we could get it ourselves. It was close, but it was wedged in between two other cars and I had to squeeze to get into the passenger side without dinging the car next to me.

Fair warning, this is a chain, so don't expect the same level of quality as you would in a boutique ramen shop. Japanese greetings from the staff, like in most chain Japanese restaurants, ring incredibly hollow and fake. During peak meal hours, your wait can be upwards of 30 minutes to an hour. Communal tables are fairly common too - if that's not your thing (fancy date? why are you bringing her to a ramen joint?) let the host(ess) know.\\n\\nFood-wise, you really can't go wrong with many of the menu items. My personal favorite is either the shio or miso ramen. The texture of the ramen is good, but not fantastic - at least it's consistent every time I go, though. The broth borders on the edge of a little too salty, but it's fantastically delicious to slurp in the Japanese way that tells the chef that you love it (seriously, this is a thing). The pork is soft, tender, and flavorful, it's clearly been cooked for a long time rather than rushed. Pro-tip: add an egg, it makes your broth delicious. If you're looking for Yume-level of portions, make sure to get a bigger bowl. Otherwise, the normal bowl size or the half-bowl size that come with the combos are enough to satisfy you while letting you taste other items on the menu.\\n\\nPrice-wise, you're paying a little bit on the premium side.

And its moniker \\"Sandwich Meltery\\" is no longer 100% true, as their current poster is touting new \\"un\\" grilled selections.\\n\\nUmm... isn't that making it more like the store next door?  Not literally of course, since that's Cakeology.\\n\\nIn checking out the menu, looks like the ungrilled sandwiches are made fresh daily and found in the grab & go case.  Sounds like Pret A Manger to me... but with a make your own sandwich option if you don't want it \\"their way,\\" but just give them a few minutes since those will be made to order.  A few pre-made salad options are also in the same case.\\n\\nThe familiar grilled cheese selections are still there.  I just hope the make your own sandwich option still goes for the hot, grilled type too.\\n\\nNew are the mac & cheese add in options, and $1.99 gourmet cheesecake pops.\\n\\n*** 3/2014 ***\\n\\nTurns out they have both a refrigerated case and a heated case for those who were in a rush and wished to grab'n'go.\\n\\nI didn't.  I ordered a Choco-Melt $3.79 (cinnamon swirl bread/Nutella/American cheese).  It came with a mint chocolate like their grilled cheeses do.  But it came in a smaller square box.  The dessert sandwich inside was rather small as well, and flat, and dusted with powdered sugar.\\n\\nFlipping over a quarter piece, I could not see the cinnamon swirls.  But tasting it, I realized that I don't care for American cheese with my Nutella.\\n\\nPS - during their brief hiatus, they fixed the directional issue... although that didn't stop a couple of ladies from pausing right after they entered and corraling me by the door.  Also there must have been a bit of a rush right before I got there, as there was nearly no room to wait to the left of the registers due to the crowd of folk patiently standing around waiting for their orders.\\n\\n*** 3/2014 again ***\\n\\nIn a past life (aka their original menu board) a make your own melt with protein was $5.49 (or $7.49 with the chip/fountain drink meal add-on), which aligned with the prices for their single protein signature sandwiches (ie. Chipotle Chicken, Roast Chief).  Now, according to my receipt, it was $8.59 for my meal, while if I had ordered one of those signature sandwich meal options it would have been $8.29.  So that's a 30 cent surcharge for making a meat melt my way vs ordering it off their board.\\n\\nSpeaking of which, it is a lot harder to make my own creation since there is no longer a list of the available ingredients out in plain sight.\\n\\nBut I must say, the new layout makes the room flow clearer to newbies, and it is interesting that they now have packaged cheese and crackers available for those who want to expand upon their cheese experience at home in a more classy manner.\\n\\nNote: the chip and fountain drink add on option price has gone up from $2 to $2.30.\\n\\n*** 6/2014 ***\\n\\nThis new menu format makes me less likely to make my own sandwich since I have no idea what choices there are or how much it will end up costing.  So I opted for the Roast Chief, which came out as ordered, and on good sized bread.\\n\\n*** 6/2014 again ***\\n\\nTried their Mac 'N Melt $6.99 (all-natural macaroni and cheese, hickory bacon, sharp cheddar cheese on artisan white).  It was tasty with flavorful crisp bacon contrasting with the soft elbows, but be careful!  The pasta elbowed its way out and burned my fingers!\\n\\nAs I awaited my dinner, I noticed that the pictures of their grilled sandwiches (both this mac 'n melt on the flat screen above the condiments and the new chicken sandwich on the poster adorning the window) are not of the pressed sandwiches that they sling in the store, but of generously filled unsquashed creations betwixt toasted bread.\\n\\n*** 8/12/2014 ***\\n\\nOdd, they were closed for breakfast service this morning...  I hope they are not going the way of their neighbor, Cakeology.\\n\\n*** 8/2014 ***\\n\\nMystery solved!  They have a new hours signage stating that they open daily at 10:30am.\\n\\n*** 9/2014 ***\\n\\nBrown paper totes with handles sighting.

Austin has plenty of good restaurants, but nothing quite like this -- their food and service is sophisticated, fresh, and creative, without any pretension.  The staff are gracious and friendly, the menu is fantastic, and you can be assured that every single dish will be carefully crafted and prepared.  Most recently, we enjoyed the bowfin caviar with miso flan, a remarkable pork soup, and a quinoa carbonara infused with smoked eggplant... sigh.  Fan-freaking-tastic.\\n\\nThere are a few things that Lenoir is NOT: \\n\\nThis is not an overstuffed \\"Dad restaurant\\" -- you know, the place with sumptuous leather, warm tones, buttery steaks, salty mashers, and a dessert list heavy on cheesecake and ultra chocolate.  Don't get me wrong -- those kind of places are great when you've got family in town, and want to be sure that your uncle Louie can get a decent steak and an iceberg lettuce salad.  Well, Lenoir ain't that.\\n\\nLenoir is also not corporate fancy -- a close cousin to the Dad restaurant, the corporate food mill is polished, with a mix of seafood, meats, and salads that make the business traveler on an expense account feel cared for.  Those places are ok, too, sometimes -- it's nice to have a reliable option for seared tuna or a decent risotto, with both the tables and the waitstaff swaddled in white linen.  But Lenoir ain't that, either.\\n\\nWhat Lenoir IS:\\n\\nA chef-driven, intimate restaurant that puts a premium on fresh, local foods, lovingly and innovatively prepared.  The care and creativity in the menu is amazing -- this is a labor of love, and it shows on every plate.  Particularly compared to a typical \\"fancy\\" restaurant where your dinner dollars are mostly going toward the lease and the interior designer, at Lenoir, the very reasonable prices go straight to the plate.  At $35 prix fixe for a three course dinner, Lenoir is a Stone Cold Bargain. If it were dressed up corporate garb, the prices would be double or triple, and the food would probably be half as good.  This is the best fine food value in town, bar none.\\n\\nDon't let Lenoir's cozy intimacy fool you; it's a world away from the baroque art food of celebrity chefs, but this is world class food.  Not sure what to compare it to -- maybe Blue Hill in New York City, which similarly features a rotating menu built from whatever is fresh from their own farm.\\n\\nThe owners have taken a gamble: that if they offer the most creative, freshest, and most intimate dining experience in town, those who truly love food will come.  It shouldn't be a gamble at all, but it's hard to cut through the clutter and artifice of what passes for \\"fine dining\\".  They've decided to treat diners with respect. Please thank them the best way possible: go eat there."},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Voodoo Donut is itself an \\"experience\\" you must for sure try at some point, but after that, it just lacks.  There are three things in particular that get me about these donuts\\n\\n1. They are a sugary nightmare or a sugary dream depending on how you see it.  Most of the donuts are overly sweet.  While unique and often tasty, the sheer amount of sugar can send anyone's sugar levels off the chart.\\n\\n2. They do not accept debit/credit cards.  I get it, you pay a transaction fee as a business everytime someone swipes their card, but by not accepting cards you basically force the poor out of towner who has never been to your shop to pay an ATM fee so they can try your donuts.  Thats bad business in my opinion.  There are great solutions like Square that charge 2.75% per swipe.  So that $3 that your customer just bought with their credit card, you lost 8 cents.  Where with your ATM, if you get half the fees back that it charges the customer, you just made an additional $1.25 on that $3 donut.  Again bad business.\\n\\n3.  To go along with the extra money that you are extracting from customers who do not bring cash, the donuts here are not cheap.

My remedy for this was to go with an assorted box. Yes, I trusted my taste buds to the man overcharging me for doughnuts. The flavors were so ludicrous that I had absolutely no preference. Except for one...\\n\\n \\"Do me a favor and throw in a bacon maple bar in there.\\"\\n\\n \\"That's not part of the assortment. It'll be an extra $3\\". \\n\\nOF COURSE IT WILL. \\n\\nWere the doughnuts delicious? Absolutely & I don't regret going there one bit. Except that they weren't worth the price, although I expect as much since it's a city staple. Also, they're SWEET. Yes, I know, they're supposed to be but seriously, they're SWEET. Don't go in there thinking you can handle more than 1 in a 6 hour period.

They plate 4 raviolis and the pasta is freshly made.  The combination of tastes was very satisfying.  Then we ordered the black Angus 8oz filet Mignons med-well.

It took the waiter over 30 minutes to come to our table to see if everything was okay and by then everyone else was done with their food. I told him the soups had meat in it and that he had told me it was vegetarian. His response to that was \\"oh I thought you meant are the grilled cheeses vegetarian\\"...why would I ONLY ask if the grilled cheeses are vegetarian? Obviously I'm asking because I'M vegetarian. Then he argued with me saying that the menu says there is green chili in the flight...I know it's crazy, but there is such a thing as vegetarian green chili. He offered to replace the soups with more tomato basil soup...but what is the point of getting a flight to sample the food if you're only getting one kind of soup? That makes no sense.

The restaurant I remember had a more authentic feel to it.  It looks absolutely great inside, but there was something missing about the experience.  Perhaps the according player doing modern tunes versus anything like a German Music Hall had something to do with it.  He was playing to families with kids, which was nice, but the adults were left to something you might see at a Chucky Cheese for entertainment and that was a little disappointing. Also the big screen TV in the lounge was more appropriate for a sports bar than a German-themed restaurant.\\n\\nFood - scores high - still has an excellent Fondue - we went through that in minutes.  Also had a flight of Bavarian style beers to get to try a little bit of everything, which was nice.  I had the lentil soup - which also scored well for me, as it was just as good as I remember from growing up in the area.  I did the Rhineland Combo plate, which had a little bit of everything (German link, Sauerbraten, Schnitzel, Red Cabbage and Sauerkraut. This was all very good and served at a reasonable price.

I'd recommend everyone go in, have a drink and maybe some oysters so we can keep the oldest restaurant in Boston open, but find another place in the area to have dinner.

However, we didn't have to wait there and they would text us when the table is ready. 45 mins later, we finally sat down at the table and we were starving!! We ordered a port belly ramen with shio broth and a karage (fried chicken) combo ramen with soy sauce broth. The broth is tasty (I preferred the soy sauce broth), however, the pork belly meat was way to far (literally all fat!!) and the noodles were a little bit over-boiled. The marinated soft boiled eggs that we ordered as a topping for the ramen were actually the best part of the meal! We also tried the Pao Zi (pork bun). It tasted ok but nothing special. \\n\\nAfter eating at many different ramen places, I have to say that this place is average at the best and not worth the long wait.

We went on a Saturday night at 7:00 PM. The good is basically the fact that it is a fun date night spot. It's a lively atmosphere and the ambiance is very well done. I judge restaurants by the price they charge. For the price, the food is ok. That's the best and worst I can say. The steak was full of fat and almost half of the entire thing was uneatable. I didn't find the sauce they put on top to be good or bad... it was just ok. The salmon chips seemed fresh although they didn't have much taste. Maybe that is how it was suppose to be? The waiters were stretched thin. We weren't even recognized for about 10 minutes after we were seated. I ended up enjoying our waiter but he wasn't available for good stretches in between each visit. I think management is ultimately to blame for that part. Desert and the salad were by far the best parts of the meal. Those were done well. I give this 3 stars because of the price. If this was sub $100 for two people I probably would go to 4. Definitively not 5. We paid $150 for one person drinking alcohol and two full course meals.

Their website does such an amazing job of pulling all the highlights of the space out!  I also enjoy the idea of a community-owned restaurant - something of a small investor, real neighborhood place.  Charming.  \\nHowever, Lenoir misses being actually charming in person because frankly, it's trying too hard.  To start with, Lenoir's dining room is a bit of a Monet, to quote the classic, 'Clueless,' - really pretty from far away but up close it's a bit of a mess.  On the website it appears cozy, romantic, sexy - I wanted to move right in!  In reality - seats are hard, white-washed wood, the array of lighting fixtures just looks like you're in the lighting section of a hardware store, and behind the bar - people please!! don't even get me started on how tacky and cheap those fake wood Home Depot cabinets with the fake chrome are.  I was seated at the communal table and truly could not tear my gaze away from those ugly things - I felt like i was eating dinner in someone's bathroom! I was basically in a one-room cabin and the Target-Shabby Chic collab collection had exploded all over it.  \\nLooks aside, what really got me was the cuisine.  First of all, when it's required that you enjoy a prix-fixe 3-course meal, you expect to be full when you leave.  This was the first time, after moving from Los Angeles 3 months ago, that I felt like I was back there, because honest to God I had to go by P. Terry's later on that night- I dropped $75 on a meal that was by all senses of the word - unsatisfying.  The flavors were so overwhelming - the tomato & cucumber salad - smothered in an Indian basil-style dressing.  Toasted shrimp ravioli - I just did NOT get this one - there was seriously a pea-size bit of shrimp in each dumpling - and about 3 pieces of 3-inch long okra on the plate.  I was struggling to find the food on it, really.  My friend ordered the spiced pork soup, was really excited, and had to replace her excitement with disappointment as the broth was so salty she could only handle about 3 bites. Lastly, the dessert - pistachio custard with bay ice cream - this one had NO discernible flavor. Just sweetness, no identifying taste.  Just really underwhelmed by the plates.\\nThe service was ok, albeit quirky - host was a bit spacy for only having 30 seats to figure out - maybe because he was left outside waiting to see when people came and went - and the server seemed shy with our group - however we never felt rushed,  that's for sure.

I  give it 3.5 stars to be exact.  We did the Valentines weekend package.  I will say first off that my experience for valentines weekend as per the food and the service (some what) has improved since my last visit over two years ago.  Yes I enjoyed my Valentines weekend package and I would stay there again.  A few suggestions for improvement would be:\\n1. Overnight guests should have access to park in the parking lot and should have spaces marked for overnight guests only.  One should not have to park on the street a few blocks away when one spends a bundle of money to stay with KS.  The parking lot was full.  You mean to tell me you don't have a special parking area for overnight guests?\\n2. They need TV in the rooms.  As Americans we expect to have a TV in a room. Some people need a TV on or they cannot go to sleep.  With the loud traffic noise outside we could have used a TV to drown out the noise.  What if someone wants to watch the news in the AM?  TV is expected.  Good thing we brought our laptop so we were able to watch the romantic movie my husband brought for us. \\n3. Use local made sustainable bath items/soaps lotions. With a city full of crafty people I am sure that KS can find someone to make soaps and lotions for them.  I would be afraid to use something not made in the USA or Canada on my skin. No thank you to products made in china. \\n4. When one is an overnight guest with a package deal don't make them wait for a table in the dining hall.  Allow them to choose a reserved time to dine.  Don't make them wait.  I heard that they don't take reservations which is not true because kitty-cornered from our table was a table/corner full of people with a reserved sign on their table. It seems to me that they may lack table service staff because when we were seated I noted that there were several empty tables and a few un-bussed tables.  Either they don't have enough table staff to cover all of the tables or someone does not know how to use a seating chart.  It seems that they could be making more money if all the tables were being utilized. \\n\\nOther tidbits:\\n\\nThey forgot our sparkling wine and glasses in our rooms and we had to go to the desk and ask for it.  This has happened several places I have stayed at over the years.  I think that \\"they\\" are just hoping we would forget that portion of the package deal. The chocolates that they had in the rooms were yummy.  \\n\\nThe rooms need more electrical outlets and more options for lighting.  No night light options.  Just very bright or dark! \\n\\nEven though Kennedy School is family friendly maybe they should rethink this and have family time from open-dusk.  It just seems to be an annoyance with children running around and screaming when it is an adult playground....i mean really.\\n\\nLater that evening we stopped into the boiler room for a drink.  The table service seemed a little disorganized and slow.The server didn't seem to care that much.  They should really keep tabs on those who drink too much and misbehave.  I saw a very intoxicated lady with bright red wobbly high high heels start fumbling with the special elevator.  \\n\\nI am sure I am forgetting some details and will add an addendum later.\\n\\nThe table service for the main dining room has improved.  Even if they did seem a little understaffed they did a great job for both dinner and breakfast. I was surprised that I didn't have to remind the waitstaff persons to bring me extra mayo/ketchup etc.  They were all proficient at remembering all of these items.  I had a burger and my husband had risotto neither were memorable or outstanding.  They were filling.  The beer was ok too. Not outstanding.  I did like the grapefruit beer that was yummy.  I would get that again.  I thought the breakfast was the best meal we had with them ever.  I got the farmers breakfast sandwich biscuit and the cottage potatoes.  Both were outstanding. My husband got a great breakfast as well. I will have to remember what he ordered and write an update later but we were both satisfied.  I noted that all the breakfast table staff for the day after valentines were all dudes age 30+.  They did an outstanding job.\\n\\nWe had a nice time and would stay there again.

I love Lambert's also because of the layout, especially that they put all the potato chips and candies and sodas in a corner that I am not forced to walk through to get to the register. I like the\\nmanageable size of it, the mini carts, the sense of pride the employees seem to have in working for a small business that treats them well (staff turnover seems low). It's the closest thing we have in Dorchester to an old world market -- the focus is so clearly on produce, butcher, baker, deli, and their kick-ass salad bar. I can't get everything on my list here, but it's okay.

As far as quality and taste goes, their donuts are not a whole lot better than what you would find at most of your other neighborhood doughnut shops. Other \\"boutique\\" doughnut places such as Dynamo Donuts in San Francisco are a leg up in terms of taste.  But the doughnuts here are an absolute visual feast.  Take for example, a doughnut that Food Network did not mention in DDD - the Cock n Balls doughnut.  \\n\\nIf you easily get offended by things that are sexual in nature please do not read any further as I am going to describe the best way to eat this doughnut.  If you easily get turned on by things that are sexual in nature, please remember that I am only talking about eating a particular doughnut and nothing else should be construed concerning my sexual orientation, occupation, or what I would do for crack.\\n\\nThe first thing that you will notice with the aforementioned doughnut is that it is a rather large and unwieldy monstrosity. It really requires that you handle with both hands otherwise you will just have a mess ending up all over your face.  If you are into that, then you may proceed to do so by all means.  Carefully cradle it by the base and start with the elongated portion and taste the chocolatey goodness.  This way you can start off light.  As you get toward the base of the doughnut, you will notice a shift in the weight distribution - this is because you have already gone through about a good 8 inches and what you are left with is the portion that is the true reward - the cream filling. You need to be extra careful here since just chomping for the cream will have it squirting out everywhere.  If you don't get that initial portion, don't worry, just give the base a light squeeze and you will eventually have some of that tasty filling in your mouth.  Then as your confidence builds, you can continue to eat the rest, all the while, being careful not to let all of the cream out.  If you just can't wait to get to the cream portion, then go straight for the base.  Ultimately, you will then be filled with ecstasy or guilt (depending on your upbringing) at the realization that you ate the equivalent of two doughnuts - a chocolate bar and a chocolate covered eclair!  Of course, you can always share and even eat the thing simultaneously.\\n\\nAs far as the other doughnuts were concerned, I thought that the Oreo doughnut was the next best as the glaze tasted just like the cream filling of the Oreo, and had crushed Oreos all over.  I found their fritter type doughnuts a bit too greasy and heavy.  The maple bar with bacon is decent, but the large strips of bacon made it a bit unwieldy and would have been better if they were cut into smaller pieces. So go here for pure entertainment and curiosity value and you will not be disappointed."},{"name":"Two Urban Licks","address":"820 Ralph McGill Blvd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I went just last night with 2 of my girlfriends.

Yes, they gave us a shrimp cocktail on the house, a nice gesture but still, who runs out of bread?  Also, not a single person ever apologized for our wait, even when I checked in with them they just said they were waiting on some tables to get up and they'd come get us, but no apology. The host staff is the worst because even when they finally got us for our table they walked us downstairs and then made us wait there to check and see if the table was actually ready.. why would you come get us if you weren't sure it was ready.

Judging from the rave reviews, we picked this spot for brunch and already had our eyes set on a few items. It was a Wednesday around noon, and wasn't too busy.\\n\\nWe were seated in the outside area. Our waiter (main culprit) slammed down my girlfriends coffee. I didn't make a big deal out of it. But then he came back and chucked the straws on the table. I was annoyed but still not a big deal. After ordering our food we asked the same waiter if he could turn the fan down because my girlfriend felt cold. He simply replied, \\" we lost the remote to the fan.\\" We went ahead and ordered and I went out to the car and got my jacket for her. We ordered an omelet and fried chicken and waffles and 2x hash browns. \\n\\nTwo parties were seated about 10-15 min after us. After 35 minutes, we noticed both of those parties received their food. My girlfriend was like \\"let's just- wait 5 more min. Maybe ours is taking longer bc of the fried chicken??\\" After 5 minutes, we flagged down another waiter to check the status. Our original waiter came back and told us, \\" the kitchen staff lost your order, would you like me to put it in for you now?\\" \\n\\nI asked him how come he never checked on us. There were only two parties seated after us and received their food first. He waited both of those tables. We said no. We were just gonna leave. We just didn't feel welcome. And he said sorry, and just walked away. \\n\\nComing from NYC, I have never experienced such unprofessionalism from any establishment. I'm not sure if our race had anything to do with it? Looking back, from the moment we sat down it felt like they were out to \\"get us\\".  Threw our items on the table, Never checked on us, didn't offer for us to move under the ceiling fan that did have a working remote. And really, he wasn't really apologetic. We should have realized something was up when he said they lost the remote to the fan.  Nobody checked up on us or our food until we've mentioned it. It was such a huge waste of time. \\n\\nWe left feeling like we were neglected for whatever reason. Maybe it was race (we were the only Asians in the restaurant), or he was having a bad day.

DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES GO TO THIS RESTAURANT IF YOU DON'T HAVE YOUR OWN CAR. This is not a taxi-friendly area and if you are in Buckhead you are facing a $35-50 cab fare each way for an agonizing 6 mile ride that takes about 45 minutes during the dinner-time rush hour. We were mighty unhappy with our meeting planner for sending 8 of us in two cabs for such a long way when the spectacular Seven Lamps restaurant was right under our noses here in Buckhead (their food was every bit as good and their service was far more friendly).\\n\\nSo we arrive and the place is half empty and the first 4 of our group of 8 walk in and the hostess refused to seat them until the second cab arrived (it took our cabbie 15 minutes longer to get there...go figure). The place was EMPTY and they made the first 4 stand around the hostess desk (no tables or anything) until we walked in the door and at which time they determined they could escort us to the table a few feet away that was sitting there empty waiting for us (we had a reservation). Very uppity and uncool hostess folks. The manager was nice and checked in with us on our food which was, as I said very very good but the hostess station staff was horrible.\\n\\nThe night ended as poorly as it started when we tried to get TWO cabs to come to get us. Our first group escaped after only 5-10 minutes but our second group waited another 30 minutes. The \\"valet\\" dudes were so overwhelmed getting cars and they had no interest in those of us needing cabs and the aforementioned not-so-great hostesses had said \\"the valet will get you a cab\\" and when we finally said we were still waiting for a cab they shrugged their shoulders and said they didn't know anything about it...yes, we were just standing there for 30 minutes because we liked hanging out in a driveway in a bad neighborhood watching valet dudes park cars. A couple of guys needed a cab after us and they actually flipped one of the hostesses (yep them again) a bunch of cash and she ran and got her car and last we heard they were getting her to drive them to wherever their hotel was. \\n\\nAnyway, if I was local I would definitely come here again (and not wear my best clothes because of the smell) but this is not a place for out-of-towners without cars...just the way it works.

Please do not read this 3 star posting and not go here. Your dining experience will blow your mind. After living on and off in Peru throughout my twenties and childhood, I would recommend Andina over many high-dining Peruvian restaraunts. Very authentic and so sufficient. The Seco a La Nortena, El Pato (one of the best prepared ducks I've ever tasted), the Saltados, the risotto quinoa, all the Anticuchos, Ceviches of all sorts (I would recommend the 5 fish elementos one), the yucca croquetes, only gazpacho I've ever liked, a sufficient and lovely wine list, best Pisco Sour I've had in the States by far.

Every time I have gone, I have waited way too long for drinks and appetizers. Today we had a party of 6 for a 40th birthday (which they forgot about recognizing) and waited 30 minutes for our drinks.... This offset our entire experience. We were starved. They served us insufficient amounts of bread (late) while we waited for both our drinks and food (which came at a decent time), but most of us were gluten free. We did realize, however, that they serve fried yucca if you are gluten free- a very amazing bonus. And then they forgot 2 of our orders, which was fine. We were all eating family style, so they just came out when we needed them. But the time it takes for things to get situated there is just uncalled for, new bartender or not.\\n\\nThe folks who run this establishment are made of gold. Everyone who manages here are also made of gold. Please go here because they are so wonderful and the food is lovely. However, it is loud. You will not have an intimate dining experience unless you sit downstairs or in a party of two against a wall near the bar on a slower night. You will wait a while for your drinks- so go liquored up or bring a flask.

Got there at 8:40 not realizing they don't open 'til 9. I'm not sure this is a good tactic because the whole place filled up exactly at 9 which means all stations were slammed at once: waiter, kitchen, etc. When we told our waiter we could order right away (hoping to get our ticket in early since the kitchen would soon be overwhelmed) he gave us attitude about how everyone had come in at once, etc.  I wish they would open at 8 which would allow for a more gentle moving into it for those who might be willing to start breakfast out before 9 on a weekend. I say this because I doubt there are that many people in SE who would line up before 8 and fill the joint up but I could be wrong. We tend to be a little slower getting going in this part of town.\\n\\nWe had the smoked trout hash and aebleskivers. Both were really good. The hash is really finely diced which makes for lots of nice browned bits. If you like chunky hash, you would be disappointed but I liked it.   The walnut toast with the hash has a really nice almost sourdough kind of flavor and might even have some rye in it? One of the eggs was a little firm while the other was softer and somewhat runny. For the hash, I think the softer egg is better! We have a 'skiver griddle at home and sometimes make them so we knew what to expect. Broder has good ones and the lemon curd, maple syrup, and lingonberry jam are nice condiments. The 'skivers are light, fluffy, nice and hot and have a good eggy flavor. I only wish Broder would whip up some real Swedish pancakes - one of my favorite breakfast dishes ever. Swedish pancakes as I know them are thin, light, eggy, almost crepe-like pancakes and usually served with lingonberry jam. They are simple to make as long as you whip up your batter the day before and allow it to cure overnight in the fridge.\\n\\nWe only had OJ for drinks but it was good quality juice. I'll be back to try other dishes since some of the things around us like the club sandwich made with gravlax looked amazing. You can't help but see everyone's food since the space is very small with tables lined up next to each other very close.  It's very bistro-style in that way.  Our neighbors had  the danish crown pastry that came with lemon curd and some kind of berry sauce and it looked super good and appeared to be fresh from the oven with a slightly gooey interior.

The food was mediocre and the staff was most inattentive. \\n\\nI arrived at the restaurant at slightly after 10:30pm. The host disappeared into the dining room to check for a table, a dining room that was by no means packed. Saw him go back and forth, talk to a couple other staff members, at one point holding a water pitcher. When he came back to me and apologized for getting distracted, I told him I would just sit at the bar. \\n\\nThe bar was also not packed at all, about 4 customers, not more than 5 at any given time throughout the time I was there. There were 2, at several points 3 bartenders behind the counter. Unfortunately they were apt to be too engrossed in wiping down glasses or chatting amongst themselves to notice waiting customers. I have sat at many other much busier bars with just a single bartender and had prompter service. I got up and walked up to where the bartenders were congregated to ask for a menu. Was then given the cocktail menu only, so I asked for the dinner menu, at which point the bartender reminded me that the kitchen was about to close in 15 minutes. One would have thought that with such a time crunch, they would have given me the menu the moment I sat down. Had I not got up to ask for a menu, I reckon I would not have had time to order food at all. \\n\\nI had the clam chowder to start, striped bass for the entree and olive cake for dessert, all 3 were recommended by two of the bartenders. The clam chowder was different. This was the first time I had seen calamari in a clam chowder. The calamari was interesting but fine and the clams were plenty, but the chowder tasted a little more watery than I was used to. Not the best chowder I've had. \\n\\nThe striped bass was served in a coconut milk tasting kind of broth, which I did not expect. It made it taste like some sort of pseudo-curry. Asian fusion to me is a challenging game. I'm just not a big fan of fusion in a non-asian restaurant that tastes more asian than otherwise. When the asian flavors become dominant in a fusion dish that is prepared by a chef who is not a master of asian cooking, it just descends into an inferior asian dish. The fish itself was cooked right and the accompanying clams were tasty, though. Definitely not a fan of the coconut base. \\n\\nThe desserts on the menu were not too inventive. I was surprised to overhear one of the bartenders talk somewhat highly about the pastry chef to one of the other patrons. I wonder if he was actually talking about a pastry chef at some other restaurant. Perhaps I simply had different expectations. \\n\\nAfter ordering dessert, I went to the restroom. When I came back to my seat, I was surprised to find my spoon and napkin had been removed. They definitely knew I was in the restroom and was expecting dessert because I had ordered the dessert beforehand and had asked one of the bartenders where the restroom was before I went. When the dessert was served, of course I didn't have a spoon. The bartender did immediately give me one when I flagged him down and asked for it. \\n\\nThe olive cake was alright, nothing special. It was a piece of cake with a scoop of rhubarb ice cream on top, served with a little bit of jam and some condiments decorated on the plate. Among the condiments were some olive slices, which I thought seemed more out of place than serve to elevate the dish taste-wise. \\n\\nI should also add that it took a full five minutes for the bartenders to grab my credit card from the counter when I was paying the check. \\n\\nOverall, this was a strange, inefficient experience for a restaurant in Boston. The staff members were no doubt pleasant and friendly though, when they talk to you. For all the accolades and good reviews this restaurant had received, including the recent recognition from Food & Wine, I had expected a much better experience, both in food and service.
