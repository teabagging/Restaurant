Good ambience yet with unexpected bad French food. At first you might be deceived by kind of full tables and crowded persons. But if you look more into that, obviously they take here as an alternative for other so crowded restaurants around downtown crossing since majority of them look like the employees and just eat salad for quick lunch, not traditional appetizer, entry or dessert what you apparently will choose when paying a visit to a FRENCH restaurant!!!!The \\"famous\\" mussels appetizer gave me a very bad impression at first as many of them stink!!! Then another \\"recommended\\" entry, beef bourguignon, was awful as the texture of beef stew is bad and more importantly, that beef tasted super sour! How could that happen even you use red wine to stew beef, let alone for this classic French dish! Given the impression about former dish, I strongly doubt that the beef was not fresh!Anyway, the dessert, Baked Alaska, is good finally!

I've been here a few times before, but never thought to Yelp about it myself.  Hmmm.  Wonder why that is?Now is my time to shine.The reason to go here is for their Over run bread/roll shelf.  You can get a loaf of bread here or a bag of rolls (6 or 8 in a bag.  I don't remember) for $1.  You read that correctly the first time.  $1 gets you some fresh baked bread or rolls.  You spend more than that on bread or rolls at Safeway or Freddy's.  This is better.I've never actually had any of their other baked goods and when I was in there today, the selection was pretty bare.  The cookies looked good and I seem to remember them having muffins one of the other times I was there.  I'm hoping the bare selection isn't because they are close to going out of business.I certainly hope not.  When I want to get my bread on, this is where I go.  I'm hoping that my few readers will go check this place out and they in turn will get their readers to go and show Alessio's some love.  You probably have $1 in your pocket right now.

Well, we finally went last week and it was absolutely lovely. The restaurant is really small and can get crowded very easily.  We were seated pretty quickly because we had reservations, but also I think because we came at the right time and there weren't many people waiting.  The waiting area is in the back, which I guess you could call their butcher table, because you can see a wall of meats in glass-doored fridges and the staff slicing up patrons' selected meats.  We were seated at the bar, which gave us a great view to people watch Tremont St.  It was restaurant week, but we opted to order off the regular menu and the specials instead.  My friend got the hot dog a la maison, one of their signature items, a play on the traditional hot dogs and chips, but made with sausage and comte cheese.  It was super tasty and kind of fun.  They have their specials written on a wall behind the bar, and I went for the ribeye because it had been ages since I'd had one, though the flank steak and duck a l'orange looked tempting as well.  The ribeye was perfectly cooked (love perfectly cooked steak) and was smothered in a sublime cheese sauce.  For dessert we got the mousse with candied hazelnuts, which was rich, smooth, and lovely.  They also have a great wine list, and this is where I give them the most props.  The server/bartender that waited on us was uber knowledgeable about all the wines on the menu.

When he is there, there is consistency in the product and service, when he is not there is consistency in the lack thereof. I called in my order and spoke to a young lady on the phone. (I won't say her name because I don't want her to get in trouble.) Nevertheless, when she answered the phone she answered it laughing hysterically and talking to someone else, so much so that she forgot the name of the restaurant as she was answering the phone. I asked her was she ok and she chuckled and apologized and said something had just happened. Cool, youth, I've been younger than I am now so no problem. I give her my order and she repeats it back in the form of a question as if she'd just forgotten it and was still frazzled. She got it almost right so cool. She says \\"Ok, have a nice day.\\" O_o Ummm. I just ordered my food for pick up, is there no anticipated pick up time?  How much for the pizza? (I didn't say that out loud, but I thought it.) \\"What's my wait time before its done?\\" I ask. \\"Oh! 10 minutes!\\" \\"Thanks, see you soon!\\" I walk in the door about 5-6 minutes later and not only is my pizza not in the oven, they don't acknowledge me for a while, while two of the employees sit there talking to each other laughing over the pizza dough they're kneading. I've been here several times so I wait another minute or so and then yell jokingly ... \\"Welcome to Maddios!!\\" And the guy turns and laughs and says \\"Oh, so sorry. Welcome to Maddios!\\" I then say, I have a call in and the girl says \\"Oh! O_o I'm sorry it's not ready yet. My dough .. Hold on, it's coming.\\" So I wait, it goes in the oven, I pay, she hands me a receipt. The wrong receipt and then comes back to swap it. 15 more minutes later. My pizza is done.

First thing we notice is there are a lot of highly reviewed restaurants in downtown Portland but we made our choice to visit The Picnic House for lunch. Just a short wait and we were seated and ready for some drinks and lunch!Food: We really liked the combination choice on the lunch menu. Allowing us to mix and match a variety of soup, salad, and sandwiches makes for tons of yummy possibilities. Wife and I both went with the triple combo, me with a tomato basil soup, bacon sandwich and chopped gorgonzola. Wife went with the soup of the day, mixed greens and reuben sandwich. For me the star on my plate was the thick cut bacon sammie followed closely by the soup. The Reubenesque sandwich was also very tasty and I loved the bread on both dishes.  Paired with a draft Pilsner really hit the spot!Service: Our server Alicia was great. Came by quickly and was very attentive. She also was able to make great menu and drink recommendations which always is big help when you dine at somewhere new. I also thought it was neat how your bill was inserted into an actual old book!Atmosphere: Large and airy space and I loved the hanging lights. Pretty cool decor and we of course loved the bear head over the back bar. Value: The triple combo was a great value. They say 1/2 sandwich/soup/salad but the servings were very generous. Two triple combos plus two adult beverages still came in under $50..great value!Overall: We really enjoyed our lunch and experience at The Picnic House.

Our waitress was very good she sold me on my main course of Lambcetta just her description had me watering at the mouth. My boyfriend went for the monkfish..

Although I enjoyed my first visit, I must admit my most recent visit was not a pleasant experience at all. My original visit was in October of last year. This restaurant is known to have bad reviews, and I'm beginning to wonder if they will be in business for much longer. Where do I begin? I made reservations for 8pm on a Friday night. I had an idea of what I wanted to order from reviewing the menu online and from my previous visit.  Unfortunately when we got there, we noticed that the menu had changed. From the looks of it, this looks like the third time they have changed their menu and in my opinion it has gone from great, to decent, to worse!This was the first disappointment. I proceeded to attempt to order a glass of chardonnay only to be advised that they only had moscato and Riesling. Both of which are very sweet. Ok, how can you be a bar and not carry at least one chardonnay, pinot grigio, or sauvignon blanc? I then asked to see a mixed drink menu which they had previous had on my prior visit only to be advised by our waitress that they didn't have one because they were in the process of changing this to. I then proceeded to ask if I could try their Riesling because I know that some Riesling's are semi dry. The waitress brought out the sample in a plastic cup. Again, not something you see at fine restaurants. Hey, even at places such as the Olive Garden. Ok, moving on. After accepting that they did not have what I had hoped to drink, my brother and I attempted to order something off of the menu (Oh by the way, they didn't originally have what he wanted to drink either). Even though the menu had changed and appeared to be more limited, I thought, well we can still make this work. Well, our waitress prior to ordering advised us that they did not have any more of the pasta disk. Ok, I was ok with that. I went to order the steak on the menu, and ten minutes later she came back to say, sorry no steak either. As you can imagine, at this point I was becoming more and more agitated, but trying not to take it out on our waitress who was a sweetheart by the way. I knew it wasn't her fault and I could tell that she was embarrassed. My next request was the lamb ribs. She then apologized again and said that they were out of that to. I then asked about the lobster tacos only to get we don't have that either. Ok, this is like the 4th or 5th strike by now. I finally settled on the blackened salmon and my brother ordered the salmon wellington (guess they only had salmon that night). She advised us that they were also out of the asparagus that normally comes with it so we would have to choose another vegetable. Fortunately, after all that, our dishes were at least good. I enjoyed my blackened salmon and my brother enjoyed his dish as well. I was hoping that at least a manager would visit our table, but there was no manager in site. The restaurant was pretty slow for a Friday night, and now I know why. I can't see how they will maintain at this level.Trust me, I will not go back!"},{"name":"Shilo Restaurant Portland Airport","address":"11707 NE Airport Way","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Dee the server was excellent, friendly and on it! \\nThe food...we had steamers ( huge bowl) and jumbo shrimp cocktail for appetizers.

This understated Vietnamese spot located just off Pioneer Square in downtown Portland is a must try. Food: Their menu is simple and they execute everything well! You have the option of picking from some meats and match them to a starch. Their roast pork is simply delicious with crispy skin and tender, flavorful meat, so I typically get a double roast pork with rice. Plates come with a small salad and sugar fish sauce dressing. Another highlight is the deep fried shrimp roll - tempura style shrimp rolled with lettuce, carrot and cucumber in a rice paper roll. The peanut sauce is a must to accompany it. They also have boba drinks, and make a perfectly flavored black milk tea - not too sweet or milky. Service: Counter-style ordering and mostly self-service. You'll get an electronic buzzer that you'll return the moment it lights up when your meal is ready. And you'll bus your own table too.Cost: $8 for a deep fried shrimp roll, $11 for a rice or noddle bowl. Totally reasonable for the quality food you get in return.

Plus, they seem to have a focus on shared plates, so that all the food doesn't come out at the same time.  This can be awkward if you're not sharing, like if you're vegetarian and the other person you're with ordered a meat dish.  Happened with me, and my wife had to sit there and watch me finish my meal before hers came out.\\nThey were incredibly nice about that though.

I was a little hesitant about the food since there wasn't a lot of traditional sounding food but once we got our food it was AMAZING.  I got the tomato soup with a side of corn bread muffins which was surprisingly filling and my husband got something that i'm kicking myself now for not remembering what it was called because it was probably one of the most delicious things i've ever eaten (i made him share :)).  I think the place puts out a different menu daily and I haven't seen the item on the menu lately but I will post an update if i find out what it was called.  The beer was excellent...i prefer stouts and porters and my husband prefers IPA's and we both had trouble narrowing down our options since everything we sampled was very good.The bad:\\nThis sounds weird and maybe it was just because of the day/time we went but the clientel and wait staff were kind of annoying.

She was really nice, and not in the fake server smiley B.S. way, she was genuinely nice to us and had a heart warming smile or maybe it was the tea :)\\nThe atmosphere was that of a typical china town restaurant which i like. Theres a crab and lobster tank in the place which is always nice. Nice large tables would be great for groups and no t.v.s thank god. \\nThe food was exactly what i expect when going out to a dim sum place and more. Dumplings were great, steamed buns were great, sugar cane popsicle shrimp balls, stuffed tofu, spring rolls, tempura seaweed rolls, chicken feet, all great. The big hits were the stuffed tofu and the chicken feet. The tofu is deep fried with stuffing and comes in a garlic black bean sauce, oh ya! The chicken feet has a sweet red chili and black bean sauce that was stellar! Chicken feet are always daunting and can be done so wrong. These wernt done wrong at all. Once i got past the first toe they were just like eating chicken wings. For those whove never tried them, you suck the toes off and then spit out the bones on the plate after you suck the meat off. An order of feet is four and i ate them all.\\nOur bill was going to be 13 bucks for two people but then my friend ordered lunch to go because he love it so much and it came to 17 something for three meals. I was totally stuffed and didnt have a heavy feeling in my stomach at all. Tipped the server 8 bucks because we enjoyed ourselves so much and there werent very many people in the place surprisingly. Ill be back for sure and i highly recommend trying the place out for a very affordable brunch, lunch, or lobster dinner.

Just be warned, you are entering the Bread Garden, prices are the same at all their locations, so there is nothing too thrifty here, but the sandwiches do hit the spot quite well, and the cookies too.

You can get 2 hour parking spots around the restaurant very easily. There are several vegetarian Tapas options. We tried their -\\n1. Hummus (comes with a couple of olives on top and is silky smooth texture wise), \\n2. cheesy spinach- has a very cremy texture \\n3. yoghurt tomato-y eggplant - seemed like the eggplant was slow cooked. The pieces were intact, juicy and tasted delicious with the yoghurt.\\n4. filo pastry rolls (5)- these could use some sort of chutney /dip and \\n5. feta cheese cubes (4 in total) wrapped with slices of red bell peppers- this dish had maple syrup drizzling on top which made the dish taste sweet and salty at the same time..delicious overall.Their lamb entre was good but very highly priced. They serve bread and a bell pepper dip at the beginning...these two are delicious! The bread is soft, warm and super fresh. They serve unlimited bread upon request. They have a small selection of wines. I plan to try their desserts next time around! Overall, this is a great, cosy restaurant.. Great for small parties of 4-6 people or a small family.

Cask & Larder is truly unique with an ever-changing menu, so expect to see brand new dishes on the menu every week. It's quickly become mine and the boyfriend's favourite place for classy food and drinks that don't cost a small fortune. Like the food, the decor in the restaurant fuses modern and rustic Southern style and is the perfect place to spend several hours sampling their unusual but wonderful menu. I'd suggest arriving as early as possible in time for Happy Hour between 4pm - 6pm, as it does get busy very fast. And who doesn't want incredibly fresh $1 oysters and extremely cheap bar snacks along with some truly creative cocktails? I don't drink alcohol myself, but the Bee's Knees cocktail was the most popular drink in our group, and the Smoked Fish Dip with corn bread was delicious - I could easily have eaten several plates of it myself. If you're visiting in a group of 2 or alone, grab a seat by the bar for the fastest service and best drink recommendations from their very knowledgeable and friendly bartenders. For dinner I'd suggest sampling as many items as possible - they're ideal for sharing tapas-style amongst a group. My favourites so far have been the deviled eggs, mac & cheese with candied collared greens and farmer's cheese and the hushpuppies with jalapeno remoulade. The dessert menu is available if you ask for it, which is absolutely worth it as the chocolate cheesecake and ice cream sandwich are heavenly - I wasn't quite prepared for how good they were. I'll mention that it's not the best place for picky eaters and probably not for children, as some of the ingredients are quite unusual, but they do taste out of this world and the chefs here are truly talented. It's clear that lots of thought goes into the menu, as I have yet to taste anything here that has been any less than amazing. They are also happy to provide for anyone with allergies or gluten intolerances. I'll also add that the bathrooms are extremely spacious and clean, with beautiful-smelling almond hand soap.Overall it's safe to say I'm obsessed! We try to visit once a month when possible and every time it's a five-star experience. A must-visit for dinner in the Winter Park area. I follow them on Instagram to keep up with their latest creations - the brunch does look incredible. Despite presenting quite an upscale menu, prices can be surprisingly affordable as long as you refrain from ordering too many drinks.

It could use more seasoning if served without it. It was a meaty filet. I subbed potato wedges for black eyed pea succotash (wth is that) without any hassle.  They were excellent - crispy and very well seasoned. My date enjoyed The shrimp and grits. The menu is southern inspired (southern KIN) but neither soul food nor true southern food IMO..we're in New England so it's ok to puree black eyed peas call it succotash and charge 7$ for it!

The Mac was creamy and hot, green beans have some meat and had a nice spicy kick. The salad had a lot of peppers and I'm not a big fan but it was fresh.

Combine that with the best view of the prettiest spot in town and you have the perfect restaurant experience. I think the secret lies in the sauces.

Mouth waters, palms to my cheeks, 'mmmm' guttural sounds, wide excited eyes.  Maybe it was because I was hungover.  Maybe it was because I planned the dinner 5 days in advance.  No excuses- I enjoyed every bite here (and the leftovers today in the office - totally had to cover my mouth from moaning so my coworkers didn't question my internet etiquette).My friend was in town for the weekend and loves food blogging. And her boyfriend is allergic to seafood, and she was dying for seafood.  The preview I gave her was that my friends referred to Muqueca as 'bangin.'We met up with another one of my friends and beat the Saturday dinner rush by a hair.  Since I live a block away, we called ~6:50 before bracing the cold June rain to check if there was a wait.  'No, but we have some 7:30 reservations, so come soon.'  We got there by 7:05 and though there were a few open tables, there were 2 parties ahead of us waiting for the hostess and manager to decide what to do with us.  He briefly offered us seating at the bar but we reminded him that we were three. He turned his back for a moment and then offered us a big table. No harm done, pal.We had not a drop of desire for alcohol (though my eyes wandered to a drink resembling a mojito or caprihana and I thought, 'next time').  But we did want fruit fuel. We got the berry blue, the tropical, and the pineapple mint smoothies, the latter of which was my favorite (guess I had a craving for virgin mojitos?). They were all refreshing and you could pick out each of the ingredients.We actually determined what to order by browsing their online menu before leaving my apt.  I was so lucky to be in the company of non-picky, cilantro-embracing, fish and spice-friendly individuals.  No offense to the rest of you, but more often than not I dine with ppl who prefer to have and not share their own dishes.  To be honest, if you are not a sharer and choose to come here, you should consider letting your guard and possibly hygiene standards down and sharing some saliva over a Moqueca pot because they are too big for just one!We split the Mariscada, Fish and Calamari Moqueca, and a side of fried plantains. The meal came with several sides that the busboy (man?) named off: plantain stew, a sweet sauce for the plantains, and yucca shavings, plus he cautioned against TOO much of the hot sauce on the table.  We each got our own rice ($3 for the extra rice since we ordered 2 dishes for 3 ppl), which was garlicky and not a grain was spared.  To be honest I was so engrossed in the flavors and the way they made me so so happy that I stopped talking to my friends and have no idea how they chose to eat the food.  I took turns between the Moqueca (huge pieces of white fish + very flavorful calamari) and the Mariscada (shrimpy small shrimp, large split shrimp with the tails on, mussels out of the shell, more calamari), sneaking in some plantains and whatever that incredible plantain sauce was, pouring yucca shavings all over the plate, mixing in plantain stew.  Every now and then I'd chomp down on an incredibly bright flavored onion or a bunch of cilantro.  A few times I reminded myself to add more hot sauce.  I think I kind of lost myself in the meal, to be honest.Anyway, at one point I looked up and my friends were experiencing similar revelations of joy.  Then kind of at the same time, we agreed that we should save room for dessert since we spotted some yummy desserts before our dinner arrived.  5 extra bites later, we begged our server to wrap up what was 2 smaller meals worth of food.What started as 'Oh, only 1 dessert, we are sooo so full' turned into 2. The dessert menu was fun - whimsical English translations that were endearing enough to make us want to try them all. We ordered tapioca and coconut and the chocolate truffle.  They came out quickly and were consumed almost as quickly.  The truffle was like a creamy chocolate mousse but stickier and more congealed, coated in chocolate sprinkles.  The tapioca and coconut was a combination of super sweet little tapioca pearls combined with mildly sweet coconut shavings as well as roasted coconut shavings.  There was a fig on top. They were both under $4.  Do not hesitate to order dessert here.All those expressions of pure joy for less than $30 a person. Plus we beat the dinner rush.  And as an added bonus, they put all the sides in the takeout containers, separated in the smaller sections of the container.  I appreciate that thoughtfulness!  Our server clearly knew we had a great time and told us to come back.Yes, yes, I will be back.  Hopefully that meal alone (plus the excited conversation to and from the restaurant to my apartment) was enough incentive for my friend to come visit again :)"},{"name":"Buckhead Bottle Bar & Bistro","address":"268 E Paces Ferry Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"2.5","text":"We stopped in on a Sunday late afternoon to check the place out, on a tip from Scoutmob, and decided to get appetizers here before heading down Piedmont for dinner.I don't often shell out five bucks for valet before I can even see a menu, so we cheated some hard-working guy out of his wage by finding a public parking space just around the corner.  And since it was Sunday, we didn't even have to feed the meter. Those potholes all over Buckhead? Yeah, it's my fault the city can't afford to fix 'em.So we shared a tomato soup and a flatbread pizza.  The pizza was about eight inches across and had a nice char on the crust, with recognizable pieces of tomato in the sauce, and good quality mozzarella in melted chunks on top.  The real win was the tomato soup, impossibly creamy (well, nothing's impossible if you put about half a cup of heavy cream in one bowl of soup -- no, I don't know the recipe, just making an uninformed guess) and delicious, and drizzled with a basil olive oil that added even more richness to the flavor.  \\"This should go on pasta!\\", said my lovely companion, and she's right ... but that won't stop me from spooning it up!  Add to that, since BBB does, a slice of cheese toast cut into two triangles, and aged sharp white cheddar (none of that American-cheez crap I remember from cheese toast at the elementary-school cafetorium), and you have a delicious lunch for five dollars.  Affordable, may I introduce my good friend Indulgent?That fifth star is oh-so-close, but I can't conscientiously award it when the only wheelchair-accessible men's room toilet has no seat.  I mentioned to the manager as we left that the Target just up the road has toilet seats for sale, so perhaps on another Sunday afternoon we'll come by and find the issue solved.One last note: There are several good ways to save money on your visit.  I grabbed a Scoutmob code (and if you've got their app on your phone, you can, too; even the crappiest used iPod touch can connect to their free wifi and score half off), but if you don't use that, there's a separate deal for you.  On our visit, at least, domestic drafts were $2 (down from $5) and the flatbread pizza was $3 (down from $7) if you refrain from using Scoutmob... or if you've already used your Scoutmob deal and you just want to return on the cheap.

I ordered the shepherds pie. Being British by birth I expected a Shepherds Pie. What I recieved is what is what the cooking network calls 'deconstructed'. The flavors though were spot on! The gravy was thick like it should be. The potatoes were a combination of some kind of sweet russet and the green beans were crisp and sweet. The meat, tender morsels. We also had the mac and cheese and the taco trio. Apparently, the taco trio had some heat to it. My son really liked the fries but felt the mac and cheese was more like noodles in hot milk.

The waitresses are very professional, knowledgeable, and respectful. The seating area gives a feeling of authenticity, and elegance. Once inside, you might forget you're in East Boston. \\n     The food here makes the restaurants in the North End look like fast food joints. I had the Baked Scrod off of their specials, and my girl had the Chicken Alfredo. Both came with salads which were actually an experience of their own partly because they looked and tasted fresh, and partly because the house dressing here is unforgettable. And bread, which was also very delicious. \\n   The way you know you've had authentic Italian is when you can eat it the next day and it tastes even better than it did when you got it. Such was the case with this food. Up until I ate here I lost hope for finding genuinely good Italian food in Boston.So why then, do I give them 4 stars instead of 5?Because certain nights, this place can get crowded. But it's not the crowds that take that last star away, it's the legnth of time one has to wait for a table under those conditions. I am one to take most things lightly and enjoy myself in any situation, but this wait was particularly nerve racking. There's this thing called economic theory that says that if demand is higher then supply, it might be time to raise prices (especially when you don't have any competition). When I do the whole cost benefit analysis between paying more for a nice dinner in a comfortable environment, and waiting outside for over an hour for a seat, I think paying more makes more sense. Anyway, aside from that one thing, the food is what really kept me waiting, and thus i think I would still go back, maybe this time with a board game and some lounge chairs."},{"name":"Cask & Larder","address":"565 W Fairbanks Ave","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4","text":"I was a little bit disenchanted by my visit at C&L. I tried making a reservation for six people and was told nothing was available until after 8pm. So we ditched eating dinner here and just came for beer. Complimentary valet parking upon arrival was a bit odd for a brewpub. Interior decor was very nice, darkly lit, trendy hipster style. Many open tables, about 6, let me know that they indeed had room for us at dinner but were denied anyway. We probably should have done the open dinner seating at the bar, but that was risky with six people. Only house beers on tap. Sampler flight was 'bartender's choice' when I visited, so it leaves out two of their beers that you must get full pours of to try. The fabled beer quality failed to deliver. Their very malty Chinook IPA was by far the best, 3.9 level. Prices were higher, $12 cocktails. Cocktails were nicely prepared and looked great. Good flavors according to my group. Wine list was fairly extensive. No one in our group was alienated by it being a brewpub. Food looked awesome, a shame we couldn't try it. Boiled peanuts at the bar were free and a nice touch. Bartenders were friendly and prompt. Overall, I would peg this place as food #1, beer secondary. But the whole vibe rubbed me the wrong way. For the premium venue, the non-premium beer didn't match up."},{"name":"Turner's Seafood - Salem","address":"43 Church St","city":"Salem","stars":"4.5","text":"Turner's is phenomenal  their servers are just great especially during the craziness that is Halloween time.

I always recommend starting out with the Pastrami Eggrolls and/or Matzo Ball Soup. The best kind of comfort food such as turkey & cranberry platters can also be found on the menu when you're missing grandma's style of cooking. Service can be kind of slow at this location, so I don't recommend sitting down if you're in a hurry. Try to also save some room for dessert as well - the brownie is a big chunk of fudge that is totally shareable with another person. Toojay's is a Florida classic I know will be around for a long time, and I always leave with a full belly.

I passed this place every day for four years on my way to high school and thought it looked like a disgusting dump on the outside, but eight years after graduating and traveling around the world, I decided to give it a try because the outside of anything is not always indicative of what's on the inside. (Okay, I realize most people learn this a hell of a lot earlier than I did, but cut me some slack.) Anyway, I keep coming back :) Most recently I made a dinner out of their appetizers, which were delicious! They also have a lot of inventive specials, but you have to be there earlier in the evening or else they run out. Great things that I have had: the chicken entree (it's a standard, but I don't remember the exact name), devils on horseback (dates stuffed with blue cheese and almonds, wrapped in bacon), the shrimp and crab cakes, the yummiest buffalo wings EVER, and a few of the specials, which vary. Waiting for a table is kind of a pain in the ass, but just be patient and you shall be rewarded. The decor is very pretty, and any place with wooden floors has my heart. I love their giant chalk board with the specials as well. If you want to talk over dinner, don't go on Tuesday. Spelling bee night is pretty raucous and it's hard to hear. Only reason I can't give five stars is for the clientele. (Might want to stop reading if you don't like rants.) This is a haven of my least favorite group of people: the PBR-swilling/quasi-hipster/intellectual/eco-enthusiast/NPR-listening outsiders who move to Somerville post-college because they think it is \\"hip\\" and \\"cool\\" and a haven of \\"awesomeness\\". They generally like dinosaurs, things that are ironic, and talking about how they don't really want to have a wedding shower, and they'd rather just have their guests donate to Oxfam and buy some sheep for a third-world country, but their family is throwing them one anyway because they're just, you know, traditional and that is so annoying. (Even though you know all along they are dying for a little slice of tradition in their life and will relish every second of their wedding shower bliss.) ANYWAY, I like dinosaurs and NPR too (I could skip the PBR, though...), and normally I can take these people on a one-on-one basis but when there's a whole mass of them I start to get agitated. If you are one of these people, you'll fit right in.

I ordered the brisket, and my boyfriend got the ribs. Our first disappointment was the lack of traditional BBQ sides--I appreciate the diversity PF's brings with the Latin American sides, but I can't picture Southern BBQ without mashed potatoes, cornbread, or mac and cheese. I ended up getting the grilled vegetables and the fried yuca--both were nice, but neither truly complemented the brisket.The disappointment continued with our main courses. My brisket was 1/3 fat, rendering that portion inedible, while the rest was dry and lacking flavor. My boyfriend's ribs needed to really be cut into to be eaten--far from the \\"fall off the bone\\" ribs that I hope for in BBQ. The sweet BBQ sauce that accompanies each dish is a bit too sweet for my taste, but even if it had been perfect, I'm afraid it wouldn't have been able to compensate for the ill-prepared meat.Pig Floyd's does have really nice outdoor seating, its location is prime, and its staff were attentive.

Since I've been taking every other Friday off, I can now get inside some of the more popular restaurants during their non-peak hours on a weekday. Yay.I'm not sure adding my review to the 550+ already posted for Tasty n Sons will make a whole helluva lot of difference, but here it goes...We were seated right away at a counter that overlooks Williams. Not my most favorite seating arrangement. I usually like to look my sweetie in the eyes when we dine together, and I prefer some booth room. I'm a big-ish fellow and I don't do well in itty-bitty spaces. There was also a gigantic communal table in the room, which would probably be an even less desirable place to sit. There did appear to be some roomier accommodations in the main dining area.Our server took our drink orders right away. I got a Tasty Maria. Good, strong drink. Plenty of tequila in there. We also ordered the chocolate donut and the bacon-wrapped date for starters. I liked the date--bacon, duh. The donut was tasty and warm--chocolate, duh.I got the open-face Monte Cristo and my wife ordered the special--a roast beef sandwich. Both plates were very good and we shared halfies. I wasn't tremendously hungry, so the small, tapas-like servings were appreciated.I can't say I'd ever consider going back to Tasty n Sons if there's a line and a long wait involved. I wasn't particularly wowed by my dining experience and the uncomfortable seating didn't thrill me. I'm too old to sit all cramped into a tiny space with my big ass squeezed up next to a stranger.The food was good. The service was excellent. They seem to know how to construct a legitimate cocktail.

We noticed most of the waiters and waitresses making their tables drinks, which might explain why we couldn't drink them because they were entirely too strong. Finally when she came back with our drinks, we ordered the steamed clams and the crab lovers feast. 20 minutes passed with no appetizer... We saw what looked like might be our order head to another table and surely enough, after Matt intervened, we found out our order had gone to the wrong table. Which means she brought the order out and then took it away from them to bring to our table. After that it seemed as though she knew she had screwed up and just stopped paying attention to us which is unfortunate, having been a waitress for many years she still would've received a tip had she just acknowledged her mistakes (we did still tip her but only a few dollars, and we actually tipped Matt a full tip) Matt payed very close attention to us after realizing how neglected we had been. At one point she even took our shell bowl away half way through our meal and never returned, and we had to flag Matt over and ask him for a new one. On the bright side the food was phenomenal! Just a heads up they don't clarify for the steamed clams that they're middle necks, which I don't mind but the other half of my party wasn't a fan of.

My wife and I have loved Holy Taco for years. The founder recently departed and we hoped that the \\"hit\\" would not be significant. Sadly, in our last two visits we have found it to be.As a recent review mentioned, the change is immediately apparent when the sad, generic, new chips are brought to the table. I had read \\"complaints\\" here in the past; \\"Why can't their chips be like everywhere else?\\" Well, I hope you're happy: Now they are. Not bad but no longer, thick, \\"hand hewn,\\" or special. And, as is mentioned in other reviews here, Holy Taco charges \\"special\\" prices, so one hopes for -- and expects -- special food to be served in kind. But it seems to be trending away from \\"special,\\" sadly.  I am afraid the \\"#7 -- taco, enchilada, rice and beans combo\\" is just around the corner. Arrrghhhh!And while the servers are the same, their attention to detail has definitely slipped. Our last two visits/orders had signifiant problems between waitstaff, kitchen and table, after maybe only one such screw up over the previous several years. And the next table over's order was a major train wreck: They seemed to have to get the entire restaurant's wait- and kitchen staff tableside to try to sort it out.We so wanted this place to continue as a \\"hidden gem\\" but it seems to be headed toward, \\"I love the margaritas there.\\" We'll give it one more try based on years of good will but I'm not hopeful."},{"name":"The Butcher Shop","address":"552 Tremont St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I am a huge Barbara Lynch fan-more than my budget can afford- and thus, I was very excited to try this place. Since it is a Barbara Lynch establishment, I was expecting a classy, refined, yet unassuming service which I did not get. It was a busy Saturday during the later brunch hours, which is no excuse for a Barbara Lynch establishment. My friend and I stood by the door waiting for staff to acknowledge our presence which did not occur until two other patrons walked in, and were greeted by the staff/hostess.  We had to interrupt her to let her know that we had not been tended to and that we had actually arrived before the other two patrons. Finally, when we were seated at the bar, it took longer than allowable to order. I had the burger, which was \\"meh.\\" I ordered it medium-rare, but it was more on the medium side-fail. The salad that accompanied it was good, but I am not the type to go to McDonald's order a Big Mac, and then order a Diet Coke. I would have appreciated some form of potato/sweet potato, somethin' other than a green salad. My friend had the charcuterie plate which came with bread, which was again \\"meh.\\" Conclusion: A let-down, but since I am so fond of Barbara Lynch, I may just go back to give it a second chance."},{"name":"Salt & Straw","address":"2035 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Great ice cream, a little expensive but worth the wait and the price, I had the fudge almond brittle and can't wait to go back and get some more"},{"name":"Panda Express","address":"166 Providence Hwy","city":"Dedham","stars":"3","text":"Yuck!

Chipotle has some fresh tasting food and you always feel good after cleaning your plate. The vinaigrette is to die for! My only issue with chipotle is its lack of toppings. Not a lot of variety. This specific location, however, deserves 5 stars. See below for why...Today was student BOGO day so this place was packed because everyone was getting 2 orders for themselves. Despite the line moving pretty fast for a chipotle line (chipotle fans understand), many customers were getting upset and had the audacity to yell and complain AT these young composed workers who managed to keep a smile on their face. They were apologetic to everyone for their wait despite the line moving extremely fast and I emphasize EXTREMELY. It's not their fault the line was wrapped around the building. If you were at the back of the line you have to expect waiting a little. Anyway, great staff and management should be proud of how their employees handled themselves and handled inexcusable aggressive customers.

I placed the overnight order on December 23, as recommended, to be sure that the delectable, dry ice packed ice creams arrived on December 24. Alas, the United Parcel Service was overwhelmed with the extreme weather and holiday overload of orders. The ice cream did not arrive on December 24. Instead, it arrived on December 26, after Christmas, in an unfortunate, somewhat soupy form.Disappointed, I called the folks at Salt & Straw to see what to do. They generously offered to reimburse me both for the cost of the ice cream and for the cost of overnight shipping. Despite the fact that the shipping mishap was not at all their fault, they agreed to compensate me because of their initial assurance that the ice cream would arrive before Christmas.So, yes, Salt & Straw rocks. Their ice cream is funky and tasty. But, their biggest strength is their people. The Salt & Straw people are generous, kind, and understanding.

All were delicious. This place is great if you're scared to try new things. The items are yummy and original but not too crazy over the top. I am tired of the brussel sprout trend and places charging up to $15 for a mediocore dish. Swifts did not disappoint. The brussels were delicious. the nuts and pickled onion on top helped balance out the plate.  The proportions were just about right for two people. This place is cool, dark, and very hipster. I feel like it properly represents what I would call an \\"Austin\\" restraurant. I try to avoid downtown at all costs because of the traffic but this place is worth going out and spending the money. Sure it is overpriced but you have to remember the location and that they charge what the market will take. It was extremely loud so not a place you would go to have an intimate conversation.

The s'mores bread pudding was definitely a bread pudding but was missing a key element of s'mores- the graham cracker. The waitress said it was in there but I couldn't taste any. It was sort of just a very sweet bread pudding. The chocolate nemesis was rich but also just okay. The portions worked nicely for the two of us, but I'm not sure how it goes for larger groups sharing the plates.

Very limited street parking around the residential area as well, which is all pay parking as well now.We a reservation for 2 at 7:00pm on a Saturday night.  The table was ready as soon as we walked in.First impressions, it had a pub/bar vibe.  Lot of tv's playing a couple different sport channels on them.  Chairs were worn out, cracking and ripping.We came here for dine out Vancouver $20 menu.Ordered:Bacon Cheese Meatballs with Spicy Tomato Sauce - 4 meatballs, good flavour and texture.West Coast Crab Cakes with Avocado Mash, Mango Salsa & Lemon Aioli - 2 small pieces, not the best I've had, lemon aioli was a good sauce.Pan Fried Portobello Mushroom Ravioli with Roasted Red Pepper Aioli, Tomatoes, Spinach & Freshly Ground Parmesan - small portion, good flavour.Sous-Vide Moroccan Lamb Chops  with House-Made Pesto Gnocchi, Grilled Seasonal Tree Fruit & Minted Demi Glaze - lamb chops were cooked well. Grilled seasonal tree fruit consisted of 3 thin apple slices.  Gnocchi would have been better if they were pan fried after boiled.  Chocolate Volcano Cake - Server let us know that they sold out of the volcano cake, because they weren't expecting it to be that popular. Regular chocolate cake as a replacement.Strawberry Trifle - made in a big mason jar.  Very good dessert.Service was lacking to say the least.  After we were seated, it took over 5 minutes before our server brought us some waters and asked if we were ready to order at the same time.  Our sever was friendly when he came around.  The food took awhile to come out.  After the appetizers, there was another long delay before the mains came out.  The server did apologize and said the kitchen was backed up.  After dessert he disappeared again when we just wanted the bill.

They are all so delicious!As far as the appetizers, we always order the Hot & Crunchy Shrimp and the Crab Cake sliders. I prefer the sliders at the downtown location better, but the shrimp is definitely \\"crunchier\\" here. Rangoons are good, but not the best I've had.

We ordered the steaks for the main dish. The mashed potatoes were way too buttery and the asparagus was overcooked. The steaks were the highlight of the meal, but definitely not worth $36. I would rather go to a nearby steakhouse at that point. Lastly, the dessert was quite lackluster - we tried the creme brulee and it was average and nothing special.

You get to order your food from two sheets that have their regular dimsum dishes for $3.15 or their specialty items like congee, noodles, dumplings etc ranging from $3.50-$8. We ordered things we normally don't get at a dimsum place like the scallion pancakes ($3.50which weren't good, they simply dipped it in oil and took them out, yuck), dumplings ($6 xiao long bao), spinach and shrimp dumplings ($3.15), and fried noodle wrap ($3.15). Our bill came to be about $18 including tax and tea charge($0.50pp). For us that was pretty expensive, we normally get the same number of dishes for half that price. There was definitely food left after that meal too though. If you order from the regular menu the price is pretty fair, but if you order more from the second page with their specialty item your bill will definitely skyrocket, which was our case.This place is definitely tiny, with only 5 tables for 4 and 2 or 3 tables for parties of 6 or more.

Tried a cheese slice for a more realistic $2.50 price. Good thin bottom crunch and cheese. Oddly cut slice though, a bit wider wedge shaped than expected, good portion. No floppiness in the slice but still foldable. Same goes for the meat lover's slice ordered. A bit salty on the meats, probably from the bacon crumbs. Suggest using sliced ham and sausage vs. cube cuts. Could still stand for some improvement but passable NY style for Orlando. Good job of redeeming yourself Cibele! (Establishment owner). Would still be good if you reconsidered having lunch hours, 11am-3pm perhaps, once you are able to make it known to the residential neighborhood and commercial businesses aware of stable hours? Your decision not to have lunch service based upon a week during the temporary Curry Ford Bike Lane study fiasco probably not the best way to measure potential lunch traffic. Pizza reminded me of the old Brooklyn Pizza on Aloma few years back. I would return on occasion in the future.

There seems to be no management, with employees walking around wondering what to do but with customers clearly not being served. The bartender and waiter sported an appearance that might best be described as urban skank. Although one might expect slow service at lunch on Cinco de Mayo, the absolute dearth of any orders leaving the kitchen pointed to some fundamental problems that can't be blamed on what should be the best day of the year for a Mexican restaurant.

Their mango lassi and mango shake are actually the same thing. I have had real mango lassis and mango milkshakes before, and it's always authentic when served at a restaurant.

I highly recommend the soups, I had the tomato one and it was very good, but I heard a lot of compliments at my table over the butternut squash soup.  Our waiter was amazing, as well as all the staff I contacted today.  Like most places in Portland, there seems to be less tables than there are people that want to sit there, but still I was very impressed that they took reservations and honored them.  It was nice not to have to worry about finding a seat, especially when you are with people that are 50+, 70+ etc., it is very reassuring to know that you have a table and so you don't have to worry about it.

As other reviewers mentioned this isn't the type of place where you pick what you want off of carts as they go by, but instead you order from a menu by making a checklist of items you'd like and handing it to a server. While this method isn't as fun, you still get to see the food before you order it due to a well-illustrated menu and in my opinion you get fresher food. When your order arrives in waves (as it often does) you can tell each dish was just made as it's always hot and tastes very fresh. The cart method doesn't always guarantee this experience.As far as food goes, most of the standard dim sum fare is great. The flavor profiles are usually simple, but quality. For example the shrimp dumplings are just minced shrimp wrapped in sticky rice paper without anything else going on, but the quality of preparation makes up for any lack of frills. Other items like (our arguably favorite) fried radish cakes stir fried with bean sprouts and green onions have quite a the combination of amazing tastes. Do not miss this dish. The shumai, stuffed rice noodles, and veggies are all tasty without being overly salty or oily. Overall we've never had a bad experience food-wise. Service is iffy at best, but hey it's an authentic place in Chinatown, so no surprises there, and when reviewing a restaurant I always weight the food much more heavily than the service so I stand by my four-star review on the merits of Windsor's food alone."},{"name":"ArtEpicure Cooking School","address":"1 Fitchburg St","city":"Somerville","stars":"5","text":"I enjoyed a private class with just my fianc√©e and I, and it was absolutely stellar.

I'm only now realizing what a mistake I've made by waiting this long to go! Good Chinese food is difficult to come by on this street, but I've mistakenly thought that the best SanSai would have to offer in Asian fare would be sushi. We were ushered in politely and told that we could sit anywhere we would like. After debating between a few different things, the two of us went for the sushi boat! We ordered one of the SanSai sushi boats (the smallest one) for $29, then tacked on some $2.50 orders of 6 piece gyoza/potstickers and a Sapporo and Widmer beer. The sushi boat came with a starter oriental salad, and then on the boat were 10 pieces of mixed nigiri sushi, the Red Bull roll and the California roll, an order of shrimp/vegetable tempura, and an order of teriyaki chicken over rice! We easily could have fed another person with all that we ordered, and in total we spent $42 for a huge lunch with an entire portion of leftovers.The salad was clean and delicious, with spring greens, a toasted sesame dressing and a few mandarin oranges. We loved the sauce that came with the gyoza, and they quickly came out piping hot from the kitchen after the salad.The fish for the sushi wasn't the most flavorful I've had in Portland, but it does come at a great value. The pieces they serve on the nigiri are huge and are priced fairly. The crab is served in a shredded form, which was a fresh take on the imitation stuff for me. My favorite part was probably the teriyaki chicken which was outstandingly tender. It had extra sauce drizzled on top but it wasn't swimming in it. It was served on a generous bed of rice that was delectably buttery and perfectly sticky.It's pretty apparent that the wait staff work together, as we were helped by multiple servers. I love this style of serving because it allows you to flag down anyone for help and helps the flow of service proceed in a much quicker manner. I found the customer service to be very friendly and direct even in the middle of the lunch rush. We had just set down our menus with a decision when one of the waitresses came up to take our order. And we had just set down our chopsticks and leaned back for the check when another server came by and asked if we needed a box for the leftovers. Advice: if you need something or something's wrong with your order, just ask. I found it very easy to get the staff's attention, but they weren't hovering over us every two minutes asking if we needed something (a plus in my book).Overall, if you want really fancy/exquisite sushi, this might not be the best place for you. If you want quick, casual, filling, comforting Japanese entrees with some sushi to go with it (not an easy find on this side of PDX), then SanSai is a fantastic option."},{"name":"Rino's Place","address":"258 Saratoga St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"WOW!!!

The Chicken Karrage was a decent sized portion, crispy, and not greasy at all! Could've used a pinch more salt or pepper though. The Chicken Teriyaki had some awesome crispiness to the outside of it, and the sauce balance was just right (not too watery or syrupy). The rice on the Chopped Scallop Roll could've had more of a vinegar taste to it, but the scallop itself tasted very fresh.We also ordered a Sushi Combo (7.95) to try. We ordered a Salmon Tempura Roll, Dynamite Roll, and a Spicy Shrimp Roll. Both the Salmon Tempura and Dynamite Rolls was nice and crispy, though we both found the Salmon to be a bit lacking. The Spicy sauce that they use is just Sriracha Mayo if you're wondering what the \\"spice\\" comes from lol. Overall, very tasty combos for a great price!

One hour 45 minutes later and starving we were called. We had asparagus with prosciutto and goat cheese drizzled with olive oil and balsamic glaze, gnocchi and chicken saltimbocca (pasta with a white wine sauce, capers, mushrooms (with a tender chicken breast covered with prosciutto and mozzarella). The asparagus were to die for. The asparagus were lightly cooked. The prosciutto was tender and not to salty and of course the goat cheese was mild and creamy. It was the perfect combinations of flavors. It was sweet meet (oh so ever light) salty then crunchy meet creamy! The gnocchi were covered in the perfect combination of sauce (gravy) and mozzarella.

Make your way downstairs and there is an Irish pub feel with chalkboards full of beer lists and hot dogs all around.  Outside on the patio there are several ping pong tables and would make for a great hangout on a day with lovely weather.It seemed like every single table had a large soft pretzel on it but I can't say that I was particularly impressed with the quality of it.  It was fine enough but not something that I would crave by any means.  The hot dogs and brats were good but again, nothing out of the ordinary.  The one thing I do appreciate is they have a vegetarian dog made with spices, beets and more but the taste just doesnt deliver.  Its like a big, hot red vine than anything else.Would I go back here?

We loved the display of the gelatis.  All together our experience with 407 Cafe was great.  The only thing I could comment on is the price.  Paninis and crepes range from about $8 - $10, which is not terribly expensive, but leaves us more likely to come here as a special treat than as a weekly brunch.

Loved it! I got the 3 piece strips and he got the 5. We shared a fry and the Mac daddy Mac and cheese. The strips were good, the breading is a little different than what I've had, but it was very flavorful. At first I thought just the three strips wasn't going to be enough, but I was satisfied with those and the sides we got. The Mac was good, but it wasn't anything too special. I'm a Mac and cheese snob so I'm harder to please. You can pick 2 sauces if you get the chicken strips, so my husband and I got 4 different ones. We tried the teriyaki, bbq, donkey sauce, and the honey hot one. All were verrryyyy delicious. I can't wait to come back and try more! My only complaint about the sauces though is that they barely give you any in those tiny cups they come served in!! I still had one chicken strip left to eat and I was out of sauce. I like to DUNK my food so that it's completely lathered in sauces. Not nearly enough comes with what they give you. Y'all need bigger cups for the sauces and they will be perfect! One last thing: we had to sit inside because it was raining outside. No problem at all, but the music inside is so stinking loud.

It was a unified southern-tasting meal and certainly big enough to share between two people. My only complaint is the lack of flavor. The shrimp crab cakes were similarly bland. The presentation of the food, however, was very appealing.As others have noted, it's a hike from Porter Square!! A mixed crowd -- families, couples, friends. The A/C was up too high and the clock on the wall was wrong. I also thought the decor here was a little wacky. Now that I've started noticing when places \\"know what they are,\\" (thanks to Andrew B. -- see my Red Lion Tavern Los Angeles review for an example) it's really obvious when they are \\"confused,\\" combining several different styles for decoration, not sticking to a theme.

Sadly, it was one of the few real letdowns of the marathon eating trip, as most of the stuff we ordered was pretty forgettable:- Sourdough Toast ($6)\\nOne of the specials, this sounded a lot better than it looked and tasted. Writing this a few weeks later, I can barely remember what was served alongside the cold, hard toast, which is telling.- Crumpets & Rabbit special ($12)\\nWe happened to be brunching here on Easter Sunday, and we fell for this rabbit special like suckers. This was nothing but a run-of-the-mill take on Eggs Benedict, with the potentially good rabbit and crumpets drenched in the bright yellow and unappetizing hollandaise sauce.- \\"Pragel & Trox\\" ($15)\\nThis one sounded pretty exciting, but wasn't tasty enough to justify the mess of trying to eat it: smoked trout, creme fraiche and a poached egg on a pretzel bagel. The bagel was not chewy in a good bagel way, but more in a stale kind of way. The whole thing was overloaded too, which made it near impossible to pick up and eat.- Peanut Butter Pancakes ($6)\\nIf something has peanut butter in it and I don't like it, then it's a major problem. The problem here though was that I could barely even detect any hint of peanut butter taste in these. They just tasted like regular old straight up pancake batter. Luckily these were just a side, so I didn't mind taking just a bite and discarding the rest.- Commander Crunch ($8)\\nThings got much better with dessert. This chocolatey dessert consisted of dark chocolate mousse, chocolate \\"soil\\", chocolate tuile, Cap'n Crunch ice cream and blueberry bubbles. The best bites consisted of that crunchy, rich soil along with the creamy ice cream.- Popcorn & A Movie ($8)\\nOne of the major reasons I wanted to come here, this was another tasty dessert. This was a small dessert laid out on a relatively gigantic plate, with kernels of caramel corn decorating everything. At the center was a housemade candy bar topped with a scoop of butter popcorn gelato. The candy bar wasn't too memorable, but that gelato was insane - it really tasted like buttery popcorn. This is a great end to the meal for popcorn lovers.I love sweets, but these weren't good enough to salvage the rest of the meal. Perhaps it's best to come here for dessert after a meal elsewhere."},{"name":"Pig Floyd's Urban Barbakoa","address":"1326 N Mills Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"This place was pretty busy when we went, but the food was so worth the wait!

I was there during the dinner buffet which I think was all you can eat for $12.95 or something in that ballpark. I thought that was a really good price for what they had. Usually restaurants like this don't have too much variety in their buffets but this place actually had a pretty good selection of stuff. Aside from the naan, rice and other starches, they had samosas, momos (Nepalese dumplings), vegetable pekoras (I think they were pekoras...), a couple of different other dishes I can't spell out right now and some Nepalese/Indian dessert. I would stay away from their saag paneer that was under seasoned and had very very few cubes of cheese. Try their pickles if you like intense flavors. They were pretty tasty. They pickled chiles, lime, and other stuff and marinated it in mustard oil which brought out the flavors even more. I ate them with the under seasoned paneer and rice and it actually made up for it.I went on a week night so it was pretty empty. There were only maybe 8 other people in the restaurant. Since the waiters weren't so busy, I kept asking them what was in the pickles and other stuff but they were really nice about explaining everything. I'm totally going back there.

It's not just smoked meats slathered in soso sauce, you can tell when you taste it that the meat itself has been well seasoned and they don't drown it in sauce to mask the bland meat; they put  it on the side so that you decide how you want it.

But nonetheless, we got excellent service and were treated so well! Our server was so charming and so helpful. Gave us lots of attention and we never felt rushed. We asked tons of questions because we just don't know our italian foods very well. And he was patient with us and didn't make us feel dumb. The food was DROOLING-LY (that is so not a word, I know...) delicious. I can't remember everything we had but one thing I remember was how good those breaded oysters were for our appetizer. Yummmmmmm. And their special was a lamb dish that was so tender and just melted in your mouth. The dessert was yummy and easy to share as well. Goodness, I wish I had a better memory.

The menu is always inventive and really affordable for the quality of the ingredients. We shared some of the deviled eggs to start off, with some MA-based ginger beers on the side to feed the hangovers. My huevos rancheros were substantial, but could've used some more seasoning, plus I didn't like the fact that the black beans were pureed. Strange. But the eggs were perfectly cooked!

Staff is very friendly and will talk to you throughout the evening if you appear engaged. Not sure that the wine pairing adds much, but $150pp for food + wine + tip at a restaurant of this caliber is a fantastic deal if you ask me. They aren't kidding about the menu being meat-heavy, so skip this one if you're not carnivorously inclined. But a secret tip--the restaurant is a bit more accommodating of special diets/allergies than they let on.

In preparation for my father-in-laws birthday we wanted to get some take out tamales for him. He has limited mobility and this is one of his favorite foods. But, we wanted to be sure we were getting tamales that he would like and could comfortably eat since he can't handle anything too spicy. So, I went to three local mexican restaurants that have tamales and picked some up along with rice and beans to do a taste test. I got tamales from Garibaldi, from La Fiesta and from Tacos El Rancho.So, on with the review. I gave four stars, one for the beans, which were good, one for the rice, which was actually the best of the three places we tried, one for great service and one for the tamales which were easily the best tamales of all three restaurants. I would give five stars but I am saving one for when we go back and try more of their food. This was my first time here but we will be back. I do wish they had at least beer and wine but that is just not there at this time.The beans were really nice, a decent texture with basic homemade pinto beans and fat flavor. The rice was good too, simple and very nicely spiced, easily the best we had of the three. The service was very friendly and they included some nice chips and salsa, salsa was not too spicy and had a nice touch of cilantro. Finally, the tamales themselves: the red sauce and cheese they were topped with was nice and plentiful. The Tamales had a nice masa outer shell and the pork was super tender, fresh and spiced perfectly.These were easily the top tamales of the bunch and I highly recommend this place if you need a tamale fix.La Fiesta, we will be back for more tamales. We also need to go back and try some of their other cuisine since it looks like, even though they are very small, they have nice ambience and a very friendly vibe."},{"name":"Moe's Southwest Grill","address":"70 Peachtree St","city":"Atlanta","stars":"2","text":"The chips where gross.

We were quickly served waters and were informed of the daily specials. I ordered the crispy chicken (subbed mashed potatoes for frites..classy guy over here) and my girlfriend ordered the duck confit. The portions are quite large, though still not reflective of the prices. I asked for some black peppercorn sauce for the fries and was unknowingly charged $3 for it. I'm okay with paying for things I want and expect to be charged for, but not for things I'm never told will cost anything. Anyways, service was adequate and the food was pretty good but I think for the price it could've been better. Chicken was tender and moist throughout but I personally think it could've benefited from a bit more seasoning/flavour. The duck oddly tasted like Chinese barbecue duck that you get at the local store. All in all I probably wouldn't return unless the girlfriend wanted to. There are many other establishments to try for steak frites, which is the only other thing I'd have liked to try on the menu, but after trying their sauce for it, I'd go to Salade de Fruits Caf√© any day."},{"name":"Ichi Teriyaki 27","address":"585 W 8th St","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Finally some good places in downtown Vancouver!!

Also, a smell seemed to flow from downstairs, but I'm guessing that's just how it is in gastown with all the old buildings. I ordered horchata to drink and it was good, I'm glad they offer it as some places don't. They also serve Mexican style hot chocolate. The salsa and guacamole were a bit odd and I'm not sure why, strange texture and appearance but tasted fine. The menu is still a bit confusing so make sure to talk to your waitress. There still is several options for each meal.

This self-order at-the-counter style restaurant boasts a menu featuring BBQ w/ an Asian/Mexican flare. The food we ordered was very fresh and tastes fine - it just lacked any real pop or punch in its flavor profile. The piri piri sauce was mild at best. The brisket was smokey but that's about it. The plantains were super sweet - like dessert sweet. The stir fry veggies were totally lackluster, consisting of mostly slices water chestnuts and soggy snap peas. The corn had potential as the hot sauce oil was quite hot, but it was on the bottom of the bowl and not easily accessed by the ear of corn. (A neighboring table got their corn off the cob, which would have been a better bet.) Overall, the food has a ton of potential but was mostly bland. \\nAs for the service, I politely asked the server at the counter what, exactly, the \\"pineapple coconut bun\\" was.

The appetizer and cocktail place across the street (Prima e Dopo)  is the same ownership so it's just as delicious to go there for apps and drinks before or even just for the night if that's all you are looking for.  By the time we had a few drinks and apps we were already $70 dollars in, and hadn't even eaten next door yet.

You will see quite a few 5-star reviews, and I must say I see why.My wife and I recently bought a house in Woodstock, which we were on the fence about as far as neighborhoods go.  Don't get me wrong--we liked the hood from the onset, but moving from Westmoreland/Sellwood neighborhood to anywhere else is hard to do.We heard about a little brunch spot literally 'round the corner from our new castle, so naturally we decided to try it out.  Called Toast, it's that neighborhood brunch spot you really wouldn't expect out on 52nd, but I'm so glad it's there!Now, I must tell you, I judge practically every breakfast joint I visit by their biscuits and gravy.  So, if you see my name pop up on a breakfast joint, and I've given it 4 stars or more, you can bet that they have killer B's & G.  Toast?  You betcha!  I was very impressed with the flavor and quality of the biscuits and gravy.  And not too salty (If I had a nickel for every salty plate of B's & G I've had in my lifetime).  And the freshness everyone raves about?  'Tis true!  Everything from the fruit, to the orange juice, to the homemade biscuits taste as if they were made by grandma.  You can't ask for more than that.\\"So, why 4 stars and not 5\\" you may be asking?  Well, it's not because of the food.  I had to take a star off (unfortunately) because of the atmosphere.  Not that it's bad.  The decorum is fantastic (pictures of toasters everywhere--nice touch).  It's just that the wait can be a bit long, and since they have limited hours, that can be a problem, especially when you have a 5 month old.  And that's the other  thing--not necessarily set up for babies.  Now, I realize that plenty of places have this same problem, but now that I'm a parent, that plays a big part in my reviews.

We were served a bordeaux blend that was just okay as as recommended substitute for a CabSav (which they only sold by the bottle). I just love the vibe of this place. Something about it feels very faint and Parisian -- I'm always nostalgic for a French experience."},{"name":"Maurizios","address":"364 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"While strolling through Hanover, we stopped for dinner here.

We ordered 5 different items, waters all around.  It took forever to get our waters and way longer for our food.  One of our party ordered a side of Mac and cheese and a Ceasar salad.  After the Mac and cheese arrived, then they told us there was no romaine lettuce (I understand the recall thing-but then that should have been said when the order was placed, not 45 min later).  Our server told us our food was taking so long because of the burgers taking a little longer (but they were cold when they arrived).  We had to ask for water refills, which never had ice and we had to ask three times for utensils and napkins.In my opinion, the prices for the wing meals is way too high.  12 wings and fries and it was almost $21. A standard cheeseburger with avocado was almost $13-and it looked like a frozen patty.  And it came cold.   The Mac and cheese looked flat and not really cheesy, at all-a side of fries and a side of Mac and cheese was almost $10 -completely unreasonable...Another frustration-NHL playoffs and they have MMA on the majority of screens.

It was a huge amount of food and I think it was enough for two meals. I will absolutely eat there again. However, the staff was not paying any attention to the dining area. There were so many dirty tables that we had to walk past 8+ tables before we got to one that was clean. When we were on our way out and I was dropping off our trays at the counter (since there was no obvious place to bus your tray) I had to tell the cashier that all of the tables had dirty dishes on them. She addressed the issue right away, but everyone else just stood there like they didn't care at all. One small table near us had multiple tables worth of trash and no one had checked on it in at least an hour.Since I've worked in food service, I'll chalk this up to shift change with no manager in the house, but I hope it's not a trend at Tinos.

And there is plenty of surface parking right across the street as well.The attention to detail here - both the interior and the food- is incredible.  I had no idea that the building inspired the name of the new place- it used to be Swift Premium Food Company 100 years ago??   That is what makes Austin so cool- the new owners could have just dry-walled over everything and make it look like some trendy place in Dallas devoid of any character,  but they preserved the history and did not sacrifice quality.They have a great wine selection, various seating options, and big tall windows on the west side that look right over Congress Ave!  The Elephant Room jazz bar is just below- great live music just a few flights of stairs away afterwards!The food portions are tiny but tasty- better suited for a date or happy hour or just an upscale snack.   I do have to say the warm brussels sprout salad is VERY similar to the great offering that is served at Salty Sow-  I'm sure chefs NEVER steal a food idea from another restaurant in town!   But it's all good, it's a great way to serve brussels sprouts and both restaurants do a fantastic job. I don't have anything negative to say about this place at all- great location, great vibe, easy parking available, excellent service, quality food, extensive drink selections, bar seating and table seating, and all located in a perfectly renovated downtown building that has that authentic Austin flavor!

Our server, Jeffrey, was a charm and very attentive! He helped us choose our meals. They have many vegetarian options, so I ordered a veggie enchilada and veggie taco. I loved it! Squash, zucchini, mushrooms, green beans cooked perfectly with lettuce, tomato, & cheese toppings. They have a great kids meal selection including build-your-own tacos. My son loved his soft taco with apples slices and my daughter had the mac n cheese with go-gurt.They have a dough ball challenge game, where they give the kids fresh tortilla dough to play with and make shapes. My husband and I played with it, too. It's surprisingly not messy at all. My husband ordered the house margarita and they use a great tequila, which he can taste and enjoyed a lot. The mesquite steak was large, but too sweet for his taste. They have chips & salsa to start. All of out meals include a sweet & moist tamalito, which we adults loved. It reminds me of cornbread, but less bready & more corny, no pun intended.The interior design is Spanish casual cozy & unique. They have multiple flat screens, solid wood tables and dramatic light fixtures. The bathrooms were clean, too.When we left, my 10 yr old son asked me, \\"Mom, are you going to review this restaurant?

I've heard the hype, seen it on TV (Diners Drive-ins and Dives), and tried my best to be open minded, but unfortunately the Tomahawk just doesn't do it for me.I'd been here a couple times many years ago, and never had an urge to return. A couple months ago, a visiting family member wanted to give it a try. None of us were impressed. At 11am, there was a 25 minute wait. Once seated, we realized how dark and cramped the restaurant is, but I guess that's what they're going for. We all ordered breakfast, which came fairly quickly - less than 10 minutes. It looked like they just slapped everything on a plate and schlepped it out the door. I'm not looking for artistic presentation or anything, but I wasn't happy having everything piled on top of one another. It was a mangled mess of a breakfast. On the bright side, if you want your eggs scrambled, guess what? They'll scramble the rest of your breakfast, too - no extra charge! ;)The eggs, which were ordered over-easy, were hard inside and had burnt-tasting brown crust all over (like they'd been fried in the same pan as bacon). These were worse than the eggs I make at home - and I'm terrible at cooking eggs! Bacon was very good, though a little on the salty side. Toast was a bit soggy, but tasted good. Hash browns were plentiful.On top of the long wait and mediocre food, it was a bit on the expensive side! I can't remember the exact figures, but it's definitely above the average breakfast price.Overall, I won't ever be back to the Tomahawk. Hell, I'd sooner go to the Tim Horton's across the street!

We were feeling particularly lazy so we called to see if they delivered.  After being asked to \\"hold on\\" and then being hung-up on... I called back to be answered by a fax machine... Okay - this did not bode well... But, being particularly lazy and hungry, we gave it one more try... YAY! A person!  and yes, there was someone to deliver that night....  Hmmm, do they not always deliver?  Did we get special treatment?We kept it simple and ordered lamb korma ($13.99) and two orders of regular naan bread ($0.99 ea)... The total, with tax and a $5.00 delivery charge (well, they deliver enough to know they want to charge for it) was $23.29!  Shwoo!  We figured for that it must be a pretty healthy portion of food, easily sharable.  (We pay less for Korma and more for Naan from Tarka and it is plenty to share)...  The gentleman took my name, phone number and address and was about to hang up when I asked - \\"Aren't you going to take my credit card payment information?\\"  Apparently he didn't know how, so a young lady got on the phone to inform me that she could do it, but the delivery charge could not be included.  I told her I would just pay cash for all of it when it arrived... How strange.....So, after our mandatory 30 minute waiting period (Couldn't understand if they said 25 minutes or 45 minutes... so I just waited to see) the food arrived... and BAM!  We knew we failed!  Our laziness was going to cause us to suffer!  There was about 1 cup of basmati rice and about 3 cups (including the LARGE pieces of lamb) Korma and 8 quarter pieces of Naan...  The Korma smelled pretty strongly of curry but had a nice heat (I ordered Hot, not \\"very hot\\").  The LARGE pieces of lamb were tender, but a bit dry.  The Naan was very \\"bleh\\" and flat, which I guess for white regular naan can be expected... But obviously Tarka has spoiled us with their flavorful and fluffy white naan...All in all, for the money, we agreed that we would not do this again.  We may go into the restaurant and try their buffet sometime, as Indian buffet's ARE generally worth the $, but we won't order for pick-up or delivery again, regardless of how particularly lazy we may feel at the time!"},{"name":"Nando's Flame Grilled Chicken","address":"204-3000 Lougheed Hwy","city":"Coquitlam","stars":"3.5","text":"on multiple occasions the chicken has been dry and not fresh.

Like everyone else who have posted this is not your typical restaurant. You have to make reservation and they have two or three set hours during the day to come in as a group, eat like a group and enjoy the experience and food. Bottomline its like if Naomi (TCM Alum) invites you to her home. Let me state out the pros which aside from the experience included some of the food. They started off with a chowder soup (4 of 5), then it was a weird clock kind of different variety of appetizers (3 of 5), Salad (3 of 5), Main course was duck confit? (4 of 5), Cheese appetizer with honey (2 1/2 of 5), dessert consisted of some kind of strawberry soup with ice cream (3 of 5)...the great thing and what is truly worth it is that the kitchen is infront of you so you can see Naomi and her staff working her magic...we did the wine and beer pairing...nothing spectacular... \\nCONS---two big issues it takes a long time for the whole experience to be over with (3 hours) for 6 courses. Also unfortunately our small table was overwhelmed by a group of 5 women in the other table who were screaming at their top of their lungs and being extremely annoying.

He'd seen it on TV.  With somewhat mediocre expectations, I said I'd meet him there.  This turned out to be one of the best dining decisions ever.We went on a Monday night (4/30/18) and got there around 6pm. Almost all the tables seat 4 or more, and I think there were only two that seat two.  Both of the two seaters were available when we arrived, all the other tables were in use.  I had heard about wait times here, and kept an eye on the door since I was seated looking in that direction.  It didn't seem like anyone was waiting around longer than 5 or ten minutes all night. We started with the fried mozzarella.  Blocks of breaded and fried cheese. We each had two and they were great.  The breading was light, the cheese oozed out when you cut into them.  They were perfectly prepared.Being pasta and seafood lovers, for dinner we both were torn between the lobster ravioli and one of the specials which was seafood cannelloni. We decided to order both and asked for some side plates so we could split them. Great choice.The lobster rav were big and stuffed full of ricotta and lobster, with big chunks of lobster inside. I thought that the taste of the ricotta was more front and center than the lobster. That said, this was by far the best lobster ravioli I've had. You know when you order it and sometimes you're wondering, \\"where is the lobster?\\"  There was none of that going on. You knew it was there.But the star was the seafood canneloini.  These were huge and stuffed from end to end with scallops, lobster, shrimp and ricotta.  And they weren't just stuffed in the middle and thin at the edges; these were stuffed all the way through, again with big chunks of seafood inside.   The flavors of the seafood were front and center, with the ricotta taking a second seat.  This was a special, but if it were a staple on the menu, I don't think I'd ever go anywhere else for dinner.The staff was also great.  Our waitress was friendly and patient with our questions, and the server who was clearing the tables was always on top of it and helpful. My bad for not remembering their names.

There was a lot of hype for Salt and Straw to live up to, but their ice cream was pretty fantastic.After trying a handful of their flavors, I settled on a double scoop of almond brittle in a waffle cone. Yum! The ice cream was not too sweet, and the chunks of brittle were delicious. The waffle cone was also tasty, and really substantial. It stayed crispy and didn't fall apart even as the ice cream began to melt.My mom came along and got vanilla with caramel sauce, which is also apparently really good. It's good to know that they do simple things like vanilla well, and not just the fancy flavors!They have a really neat check-out system, too, where you can swipe your credit card and get the receipt emailed or sent in a text message to you. Save some paper, I guess.I think the biggest endorsement for this place is that while we were there, a line of 20 or so people formed, trailing out the door, despite it being so cold that people were bundled up in coats.

If you get there early, you may be able to get one of their Crossiants, which I think are one of the best in Vancouver! Their doughnuts are very rich and delicious, they have both soft and fluffy, and dense and chewy. They don't always have it, but the blood orange square is by far my favourite! It isn't too sour, and has a very fragrant blood orange glaze over top with a creamy orangy filling. If you're into dense and chewy doughnuts, try the salted caramel old fashioned. It can get very packed in here and it's a little annoying to get a seat, especially with the many seat warmers on their laptops.

Can't say I was impressed at all with this location.  You would think with all the competition near by they would be on top of things... but guess not.  Anyway for a Tuesday evening around 6:30pm, there was no wait and my friend and I were sat in a small booth in the back by the windows...  As we were deciding on what we wanted to eat, we noticed flies kept buzzing around our table... I ended up killing one on the window but more kept coming and along the window seal my friend pointed out lots of dead little bugs... Gnats, flies... yeah so I wanted to move immediately... Should've take that as a hint to leave the restaurant completely but we were starving and wanted a quick bite before the movies and The Pub was packed.... should've tried The Cowfish place... So we move to another table... no bugs near by but they cleared the table we left and reset it like nothing happened... they didn't even clean the window seal after we'd pointed out there were dead bugs on it...  I felt bad for the people they sat at the table right after us... I could still see little flies buzzing around that window... So we decide on our food and while we wait we munch of the regular ol' bread they bring out... The wheat bread was fine, but the sourdough was odd, so we just picked at it...  It didn't take long for our food to come out and initially everything looked ok but it just went to meh in a hand basket as we started to eat.  I ordered the factory nachos, which I've ordered numerous times before and they came out luke warm with globs and Globs of cheese melted on top... I ate what I could but it turned into a soggy unappetizing mess before I could get a quarter of the way through them.  There was a pool of grease underneath the pile of soggy chips and I just gave up.  I drank my strawberry lemonade and waited for my friend to finish the chicken sandwich she wasn't really happy with.  She said the chicken was falling apart and not in a good way... It was probably reheated from earlier... she said the toppings didn't help it either...  Anyway as we were leaving the restaurant, I told her next time we come back to Perimeter Mall... I wouldn't be suggesting Cheesecake factory at all... Just a bad experience all around and their saving grace was the super nice server we had...  Only saving grace... only.  So many other options to choose from at Perimeter and after today even the foodcourt will be an option before we come back here..."},{"name":"Hat Yai","address":"1605 NE Killingsworth St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"The fried chicken is a thing of glory.

The interior of the restaurant is attractive and well-designed and the smells are intoxicating.Pei Wei is more about style than substance--but the substance isn't bad either. If you are looking for something authentic you are going to be disappointed. Pei Wei is to Asian food what Chipotle is to Mexican food: more stylish, organized, hip and fitting with the American culinary vernacular than its genuine counterparts.The food is attractively presented and it is a good portion of food but not gluttonously large. The food IS however piled to the saturation point with salt, which is a nice shortcut to make most people think it is more delicious. Oh, also I got the Spicy Korean and it wasn't in the least bit spicy. Until, of course, I added the red chili sauce which later causes an allergic reaction in my lips.

Fortunately I was able to eat there for a lunch. Unlike many of the larger dim sum restaurants in Chinatown, instead of getting the food from people who push around in carts, you actually are given a sheet of paper, and you mark down how many of each particular dish you want on the paper and give it to the waiter. The waiter then goes into the kitchen and brings out the food that you ordered. This is actually how my relatives and I ordered dim sum when we went to this dim sum restaurant (called Jade Garden in Tung Lo Wan) in Hong Kong so I have to give them praise for that. So that makes Winsor Cafe one step closer to an authentic dim sum restaurant in Hong Kong. But does that make Winsor Cafe's food on par with a Hong Kong dim sum restaurant? Not really, because I know that Boston dim sum will never be superior to Hong Kong's but it's now one of my recommendations for dim sum in Boston.  My dad and I went on a Saturday afternoon and it was busy. We had to wait quite a bit. Here are some dishes that my dad and I got. Each dish was $2.75.Ha Gau - Literally means \\"shrimp dumpling\\" in Cantonese Chinese. One dish has 4 pieces. One of the first dishes that I try to see if the dim sum is good.\\nSiu Mai - Loosely means \\"cook and sell\\". One dish has 4 pieces. I guess it was called that because it was a popular street food and the name stuck. The English name of it on the menu is \\"Pork and Shrimp Dumpling\\". Another dish that I try to see if the dim sum is good.\\nHa Cheung Fun - Cheung Fun loosely means \\"rice noodle roll\\". The English name on the menu is Steamed Shrimp Rice Noodle Roll. It is doused with soy sauce. \\nZha Leung Cheung Fun - Zha literally means \\"to fry\\". Leung means \\"two/pair\\". This consists of Yau Zha Gwai wrapped in a rice noodle roll. Yau Zha Gwai is like a fried dough. The English name is \\"Chinese Fried Dough in Rice Noodle\\". \\nCha Siu Bau - Cha means \\"fork\\". Siu literally means \\"roast\\". Bau means \\"bun\\". Steamed Roasted Pork Bun is what it's called on the menu. One dish has 3 pieces.  \\nLo Mai Gai - Loosely means \\"Glutinous rice chicken\\". This consists of a large sticky rice ball mixed with chopped up mushrooms, tiny bits of chicken, wrapped up in a moist lotus leaf. One dish has two wrapped packets. The name in English on the menu is \\"Sticky Rice in Lotus Leaf Packets.\\"The Cha Siu Bau was probably the best dim sum Cha Siu Bau I have eaten in Boston's Chinatown. The bread tasted fresh, soft, and made with the right fluffiness I wanted in a Cha Siu Bau. If only if it was meatier, then it would probably be the best Cha Siu Bau I have eaten. The dish I probably ate the most was the Zha Leung Cheung Fun. The aftertaste was a tiny bit strange, but overall I thought it was delicious and chewy, although greasy. The Lo Mai Gai was small, but eating two of them could make a hearty lunch, and at $2.75, it's a competitive price in terms of Dim Sum in Boston's Chinatown. The Ha Gau was good as well. All the other dishes were decent overall.  There were only two disappointing things during my visit. First, the restaurant did not have Wu Tau Kok, which is a Taro dumpling very popular in dim sum, so I would have to go to Hei La Moon, Chau Chow City or Emperor's Garden to get it. Second, the Siu Mai did not arrive yet, and my dad had to remind the waiter that they missed the Siu Mai and it was the last dish to arrive. Usually, Siu Mai and Ha Gau are the very first things I order in dim sum and the very first dishes to arrive. Overall, I did enjoy my food there, and they came in really quick, which outweigh the two disappointments. I really liked the Cha Siu Bau and the Zha Leung Cheung Fun. I would definitely come back again to eat some of the other various dim sum dishes at this place. It may not be the Jade Garden restaurant in Hong Kong's Tung Lo Wan (Causeway Bay) but the ordering style reminded me of it, though, making it one step closer to a real dim sum restaurant in Hong Kong."},{"name":"Tasty n Sons","address":"3808 N Williams Ave, Ste C, Hub Building","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"I have only been here once and I cannot wait to go back and eat more!

Once you order, they give you a number and you take a sit...food is brought to your table, fairly quickly I might add. The food is delectable. Prices are fair for what it is, normally I spend about $30-$37 for two people.

I couldn't remember the name before we got there (I mistakenly referred to it in a conversation as \\"Thunder MacDougal's\\"; I'm just weird like that)... I'll never forget the name now, though I wish I would.For one, the burger was a big, greasy, disgusting mess. & hideously overpriced (not in the good way). A point to ponder: how is it possible for a burger to be dripping with grease & sauces/condiments, & STILL manage to be nearly completely flavorless? This place has mastered the art of sloppy, tasteless, heart attack-inducing cuisine, though I'd think before I bragged about that fact on a menu or in a window.Back to the food. The onion rings were average at best. The ranch they came with was pretty average, too. The table was sticky. The waitress had an attitude problem & basically plopped our food in front of us, left the receipt, & never checked on us again. What, no refills!? WHY ARE YOU IN SUCH A BAD MOOD? YOU JUST OPENED!! We couldn't even get her attention if we wanted to (even though there was only one other person there eating). & to top all this off with a cherry (knowing this place, it'd probably be greasy & disgusting too)... the food actually made me sick. I rarely get sick from eating out. In fact, while I've tried other places that weren't very good, I think the last time a fast food establishment actually made me sick, my age was still a single digit.

First, let me start by saying that we had a party of four and my girlfriend and I grabbed a table because at 7:30p.m. on a Saturday, they were slammed.  The line was out the door and around the corner to order.  Two men then approached us (first a server and then the owner) to tell us we were not allowed to hold a table while our spouses waited in the line to order.  We had no idea they had this rule, and this was our friend's first time there.  However, the owner then told us all to sit down and he would actually take our order so nobody would get upset.  His service was great from beginning to end.  He took what could have been a bad experience and flipped it around.  He was funny and recommended we order the ribs.  The ribs were absolutely delicious and falling off the bone.  They have a latin flare on good old barbecue and it works.  I ordered the butter chicken tacos, like I always do and you must try them if come here.  I want to try and recreate them at home, but I'm sure they will not be as good.  They come with white rice inside the soft shell taco, cilantro, pumpkin seeds, chicken and butter chicken sauce.  They even add a jalapeno for a kick.  They're fabulous.

A water decanter sits on each table, and was refilled as we needed. The waiters were chicly dressed young men who harkened back to the 20's. We chose the three course meal, starting with a bitter green salad that was perfect.  We each chose a different entree--the grilled salmon with salsa tasted as if it were freshly caught that very morning (and likely was), and the lemon chicken was presented in a cast iron skillet on a bed of the lightest mashed potatoes I've ever eaten. The roasted chicken had a crunchy lemony outer skin with tender juicy meat inside. My daughter thought that the chocolate pudding desert was so delicious that nothing else in her future life would ever be as good. The final delight was when the check arrived in an old book, prob from the 1920's.

So I ordered the brisket meal which was 8oz of brisket versus the two oz on a hunger stopper or the 4oz on a brisket sandwich. I'm so glad I did! Their brisket was moist, well seasoned and delicious! The spicy bbq sauce was a little\\nOverpowering so I used just a touch of it mixed with the sweet sauce and it was barbeque-licious! My sides were the mexicorn and yucca fries both were good but not unusually so. The yucca fries were large steak cut fries and had a sauce which I believe was ketchup mayo and sweet relish. That was odd to me as I've only had them with a pineapple based spiced ( cinnamon/cloves) sauce. But that's just my inexperience, My hubby loved them and was happy to finish them off! The corn was good but butter, shallots, & garlic on corn on the cob is not what I expected and it's harder to eat. ...and since we took our food to go picnic style it wasn't a big hit.  I thought \\"Mexican corn\\" meant cilantro and lime forward cut corn. Again my fault for failing to read and being inexperienced in ordering from this establishment! My husband again took the task to hand and finished the job! He had his own three meat sandwich and apple fennel slaw with platanos meduros. The little bit I tasted was ok, my suggestion would be don't order the tasteless slaw Or overly sugared plantains. Do Get the brisket ask to sub out the flour tortillas for their coconut pineapple Bun and go ahead and try the yucca fries, they were  ok with the type of sauce they serve but would Be better to ask For honey & make your own sauce. As for the plantains,well perhaps  the sugar used was their attempt to stick with using fresh ingredients.

My best friend and I were somewhat lost at first and made a left turn instead of right on Cedar Hills. Eventually after looking it up online we realized we were closer than we thought. We got there about 9 PM and it was not packed at all. The service was friendly although a little slow since the cashier was multi-tasking between phone orders and the ringing people at the same time. Eventually things were speeding up and I placed my order. I decided to go for the junior bacon burger size and regular fries. It took me a while to find the peanuts since they were not displayed very well. I munched on the salted peanuts and then my order was ready. Even late at night, the place was well staffed so the food came out faster than expected. I was impressed they used fresh sliced jalapenos and surprisingly my burger was intact when I opened up the package. I asked for it to be spicy including the hot sauce and they delivered. It surely beats the Red Robin's supposedly spicy burger that is not spicy at all. The burger was pretty good simply because of the amount of toppings I could choose from. I only ordered a few such as the jalapenos, mustard, hot sauce and grilled onions. I think if they didn't offer all of those toppings, the burger would just be mediocre. The junior burger was enough for me too since the regular burger would have included 2 patties instead of 1. The fries were delicious at first. They definitely give you a generous serving that can easily feed 2 people. So being the nice guy that I am, I shared my fries. Towards the end, the flavor was gone and the consistency wasn't there with the taste for the fries. One thing that really bothered me a lot was the insane amount of advertisements posted all over the walls. It was very distracting, annoying, and \\"too loud\\" for my taste.

She forgot to give three of us our tabs and proceeded to ask me to pay for someone else's wings (they ordered more than me) because she got confused and thought that the other person at our table had my wings, so they were already paid for. She told me that she did not know what to do about it, and I told her that I would not pay for someone else's food who ordered more than I did. It all eventually got sorted out and we were given correct tickets. One of my table members was asked to pay twice for a to-go order and had to show the manager that he already paid for it (meanwhile he had been waiting a long time for the to-go order). When my significant other and I brought up all of our concerns to the manger, he told us that our waitress had only been there for two weeks and gave us an insincere apology. I understand that the waitress was new, but she should not have been left with a large party, multiple tables, at a busy time of night. Our group was hoping to make this a monthly location, but now we are going to find a different establishment."},{"name":"Southern Kin Cookhouse","address":"500 Assembly Row","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"I'm not from the south, but I'm from a hell of a lot closer to the south than Boston. Being from America's breadbasket, I tend to view myself as a messenger of sorts for those \\"simpler\\" foodstuffs that seem to be making a vibrant comeback as of late: all things southern and comforting. I use quotes around \\"simpler\\" because I hope you can understand that there's a lot more than gravy to southern food. And therein lies my beef with Southern Kin. It's a typical Boston institution that serves southern food of any type, meaning that it's contrived. Now, this is not an indictment, because I don't think they can help themselves. Boston is about as far from the American South as you can get, and it's sort of cute when this city's BBQ restaurants and southern-style spots slap on the oh-so-thick faux-southern gentility that they think comes with that territory.I'll jump off a bridge before I tell anyone that they're appropriating my culture or anyone else's, and I maintain that any restaurant can do whatever the hell they please. But I gotta say that the avalanche of y'alls and hayseed-isms was downright cloying. For pete's sake, there are little notes all over their menus that say things like \\"Whew wee!\\" and \\"Ain't nothin' more refreshin' than Ma's sweet iced tea!\\" (Seriously, they drop the g's from EVERYTHING they write!)I won't lie. I sat down, listened to the jug band that was playing (I wish I was lying), saw the aforementioned menu, and thought about abandoning ship before things got ugly. It felt like Paula Deen's ex-design team got together and came up with the whole concept. But I'm glad I put my snobbery on the back burner and stayed out, because the meal was damn good.It was brunch, so we got some cocktails, which were great. They even had a bourbon drink that had peanuts and coke in it, which is an institutional southern snack. \\"Ok,\\" I thought, \\"maybe we're on the right track here.\\"And so we were. My fiancee had these monstrous pancakes with banana compote, pecans, peanut butter, and bourbon maple syrup. That tasted like it sounds, which is to say, delicious. Also, probably a leading cause of the diabetes she'll be diagnosed with soon. I had the country fried chicken & eggs. Fried chicken, sausage gravy, eggs, home fries, and a biscuit. I figured it was a good way to test how Southern Kin cooked some of the basics. The moist chicken had great flavor and a crunchy flour breading, the gravy was peppery and rich, and the biscuit was substantial, but not too hard. It was a really good brunch, and I saw a bunch of other things on the menu I'm anxious to go back and try: she-crab soup, pimento cheese fritters, and shrimp & grits. Will I be testing Southern Kin on these staple items? Damn straight. Am I expecting them to pass with flying colors given my first experience? Absolutely.All in all, a good meal. Sure, I judged a book by its cover. Their food proved me wrong. But I stand by my claim that Southern Kin is overdoing the presentation of its southern-ness. Call me a snob or a jerk for critiquing their theme if you want, I promise I won't care about you or your stupid opinion. My review in one sentence is this: don't let the cheese factor of the faux-south deter you from enjoying a good meal at Southern Kin."},{"name":"Cafe Fresh Bagel","address":"1155 Washington St","city":"Norwood","stars":"3.5","text":"Bagels are basic, not great.

Unfortunately, it did come out a little cold because it may have been ready for a while before it was brought out to us.

Go for brunch, go for dinner, just go.  The menu is varied and creative, yet it lacks the cloying, self-satisfied whimsy that sometimes dominates the trendy restaurants in this town.  Yes, the menu has a lot of eggs on it.  But what eggs they are!  Eggs come poached, baked, fried, frittataed, and on and on.  But no one is going to ask you how you would like your egg cooked.  They decide that.  The menu is small plate with each plate generous enough for a meal.  My companion and I had the Moroccan Chicken Hash with harissa cream and over easy egg and the Monk's Carolina Cheesesteak with french fries.  Both were standout items with great depth of flavor and interesting taste combinations.  The only quibble i had with the chicken is that white meat was used, which is a bit dry and bland for my taste.  Others may prefer it this way.The dining area is family-style.  I detest the clashing of elbows with strangers but the dining room is airy with a high ceiling which compensates a bit for the horizontal crowding.  The bar is beautiful with large pieces of rough-hewn wood and a meat cleaver nailed to the top of the bar.  It was not too noisy or too quiet,, which is a remarkable accomplishment in such a cavernous wood and concrete-filled space.  The service was unobtrusive and efficient, which is my idea of great service.  I will be back-- again, again, and again.  They take reservations for large parties.  They have some basic kid-friendly items so even parents can go out and have a good time.

I especially liked how when you were close to the end of the buffet line, someone would take your drink order and then when you were done getting your food, they would hand your drink to you.

However, I'd never thought of any as a destination per se; often the beer and food weren't worth a separate trip.So I was quite impressed with my initial visit to this particular McMenamins. By now I know which beers to order (I haven't cracked the liquor lineup yet, though there are some tempting cocktails on the menu), so disappointments there are fewer and farther between even though I wouldn't put them in a lineup of Portland's finest. (The Black Rabbit Porter was surprisingly good, however.) The food here was worlds better than what I've had at other locations: the hummus plate was fresh, delicious, and piled high with salty feta and a bracing array of pickled cucumbers, onions, and green beans. Throw that on a buttery pita, and yum! The $9 Jamaican rice bowl was also fantastic; sometimes anything with brown rice is an exercise in self-denial motivated by high-minded virtue. But I wasn't missing anything here, not with a few massive chunks of chutney atop a lusciously coconutty melange of black beans, avocados, and little half-moons of roasted squash. (You can add on tofu or chicken for an extra charge, either of which I highly recommend.) One thing that deterred me from other McMenamins in the past was slightly high prices; I don't know if it's a WA/OR difference, but the prices here were a pleasant and less-expensive surprise. Plus, there's a woodstove in the middle of the tavern area, and there are few nicer things on a cool rainy night than the periodic whiff of woodsmoke and the burst of warmth emerging from the momentary open door! The tasty food, the great little happy hour menu with specials on beer, wine, and whiskey, plus the welcoming, comfortable atmosphere definitely launch this spot onto my regular rotation list."},{"name":"Ginger & Chili Restaurant","address":"4409 10th Avenue W","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"Was not super impressed with this place. Only came once for takeout. First off, the lady got my order wrong, despite me telling her the name and item number of what I wanted. I ordered the prawn in black bean sauce chow mein, instead I just got prawns in black bean sauce with onions and peppers. I noticed the price was more than expected, but I just figured they increased their prices without notice (as Chinese restaurants tend to do). Once I brought my food home, I noticed why it was over charged... The dish itself was ok, but nothing great. And there were waaayyyy too many largely cut peppers!! Seriously, like 2\\" squares of green and red peppers! I ordered some vegetarian spring rolls and I was literally squeezing the oil out!! Gross. After having the food, I realized $25 including tax and tip was way too much to pay for 1 prawn dish and 3 spring rolls!! And I felt pretty gross afterwards.

Service is NOT this place forte and stingy is the word that comes to mind. It's not about keeping you happy in regard to accommodations and service. Once I finally got a menu, some water and a watered down margarita I was once again brought a very small amount of chips. She was annoyed when I asked for more salsa so I didn't even ask for more chips. I had a card for a free meal from a guy named Jason. She took the card then came back asking me for the card. There was a bit of a scene about the \\"missing card\\" hence my anxiety and of course discomfort. I've sat here and eaten my meal including the raw peppers and onion they brought me as I requested peppers and onions not realizing I needed to specify cooked. I told her this and she looked at me like a Deer in headlights. They texted on their phones and paid very little attention to guests. Now that I've eaten here I have to be honest. The food was actually delicious. Too bad.Original post: Despise this place. I was blatantly ignored. After about 15 minutes I asked 4 chips and salsa and was told they need to make sure I'm going to order first. After ordering a drink I realized they didn't have many fish options. There was a prawn meal option that came with everything that shrimp fajitas came with beside saut√©ed pepper and onion. I was told that I couldn't as the pepper and onion to my order because they were too busy. I'm sitting here drinking the drink I ordered and the 10 stale chips and weird \\"salsa\\" they finally brought out then I'm leaving.

This is a hard place for me to review. I want to be very fair. The menu did not offer the type of food that was easy to find something we liked. I wish I had looked at it before we went. My recommendation is to do that but be open minded. Very creative cuisine. Upscale Southern cuisine.We had the oysters sampler, potted pimento cheese and creamy grits to start. Oysters  were pretty good. I would have preferred more big ones and creative sauces but it was fine. The pimento cheese was delicious! \\nThe grits was pretty good too but expensive at $12 for what you got. Really very little grits and I think two shrimp. My sister enjoyed her Cobia but it was a small offering. I had the duck which was lovely and fairly priced. My other sister had the tomato salad and didn't eat it. Definitely very marinated. She also had mac and cheese and enjoyed that. Last sister couldn't find much she liked and ordered the baby red beets. She liked it.Now time for dessert. I wish I would have had room for the Fried Dough. It sounded amazing. My sister ordered the Sweet Potato Pie in a Jar. All sisters had a bite and went nuts for it! I think it was the toasted coconut marshmallows that sent them over the edge. Oh and they were so kind and put a nice Happy Birthday note on the dessert plate. Sweet. Our service was wonderful!

She said, \\"it is going to rain all day\\" and we said it's ok it is covered and it is so light it doesn't matter.  So we got seated right beside the window of the restaurant.  We could see everyone inside.  We waited there while a table of women were just inside the window from us, letting the server know we have been sitting there for 20 minutes.  They flagged the server and then looked at us and told us they let him know.  So we got tired and went inside and the hostess said, \\"I told the server twice that you were out here, I'm sorry it's been crazy in here\\".  I said, \\"I don't care how crazy it is in here, we have been waiting and the other tables have also been telling the server we are out here\\". Then I told her never mind, we are leaving and she said, \\"that's fine\\".   This is unbelievable and ridiculous.  The server would NOT wait on us.

You have to get there by a certain time to get certain food items like brisket, ribs, pulled pork, etc. I'm not sure if they have a daily limit, but it seems that way. The food is good. It's nothing to cream about, but it is pretty decent when they have enough for you to be able to order & eat. I'm not impressed with the service. The last couple of times that I went in there, the people behind the counter (cashier, bartender, even cooks) were snacking food, talking, laughing, goofing off, and not paying attention to the customers standing at the register ready to order or me standing at the register trying to get a drink refill. I'm all for having a good time at work, but not when you have customers standing around waiting on you. Also, there's like a broom closet (?) that I always see people going in & out of across from the bar. I'm pretty sure it's a literal broom closet, because the employees just kind of cram themselves in there to bullshit. And there is a table right in front of that door, so if you sit there you will most likely have your meal interrupted by people walking in & out, squeezing past you, and that's just kind of rude. I'm not a huge fan of their brisket sandwiches because it usually comes with a thick slab of fat attached to the meat, and I personally don't want equal meat & fat, sorry. I usually get the combo meat platter with rice, black beans, & corn on the cob (comes with tortillas). I really liked this place when it first opened, but I feel like after a while it's food & service has started to decline for me.

This is one of the few places in Austin that boasts of using organic sourced clean food. Naturally, organic is going to mean not cheap.

Here's what I've tried each time I've visited, and here are my thoughts, because this is Yelp and I can talk about what I think about the food I ate. \\nVegetable soup: hearty. Not spicy. Not oily by any stretch of the imagination. Very light, somehow. Good flavor balance. \\nMadras curry bowl: potatoes, carrots, beans, beets, cooked in coconut milk and simmered with garam masala. Not to be overly critical here but, madras curry isn't garam masala. Madras curry does include coconut milk, but , we South Indian people add fenugreek and dry roasted lentils, along with a hint of tamarind, curry leaves and whole red chillies to include that tang that's so unique to the south. Also; we like our salt. The curry bowl is $9 and doesn't come with any grains- i ordered it with rice. I liked the hint of garam masala but my South Indian palate craved that tang. I did have to correct it with copious amounts of cholula. I guess this is the \\"western\\" way to do curry. The beans didn't soak up the flavor of the base like the potatoes or the carrots did, maybe rethink the addition of this vegetable? \\nThere's always a line after 12 on Sunday, since this is almost a self serve restaurant. The open kitchen is a nice way to remind people that the chefs work hard to send out their finished product, and is always interesting to look at. \\nIt's undeniably a cute little place that ironically, was filled up with a lot of the fairer sex having girls brunch, mom daughter dates, or post yoga meals."},{"name":"Cantina La Mexicana","address":"247 Washington St","city":"Somerville","stars":"3.5","text":"I've been Cantina La Mexicana for both dinner and special events - a friend hosted a birthday dinner there.

I called again and now DJ quickly passed the call to the manager (a lady whose name I couldn't get), who proceeded to talk over my complaints, then said, \\"..Sir, how about this, go f@ck yourself!\\" and hung up.Wow! It's just been a few minutes and I'm still in shock - this is a NEW LOW for me!EDIT: I received an anonymous call from DJ who said he was calling me from his cell phone and that they were not going to charge me. He offered NO APOLOGIES; instead asking \\"did you enjoy the food?\\" and saying \\"I don't think she would have said that\\". DJ also told me that the lady in question was Kim, the daughter of the owner (Debbie)."},{"name":"Cuon - Vietnamese Street Food","address":"600 SW 4th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"This place was absolutely amazing.

Was SO excited for a salad bar close to work that I could visit frequently for a quick lunch stop. Well quick, it the LAST word I would use to describe this place. I walked in, browsed the menu and was ready to order within about 3 mins of walking in. There were only 2 other ladies in front of me, who ordered right away. I waited for no joke 25 mins for my salad wrap and cup of soup. I stood there as they prepared 6 online orders (I'm assuming they were online because no one else was there besides the two other ladies in front). Meanwhile a line of about 10-15 people was piling up behind me. The online ordering is a great idea, but they need to understand the people waiting in line are just customers as well and their time is just as valuable. *if I decide to go back, it would only be by ordering online ahead of time- clearly those orders take precedence over the customers actually ordering in person. I waited patiently as they prepared my wrap- mind you its 1/2 of the food as the salads but they charge you the same amount. Clearly it was one of the girls first days as she attempted to fold my wrap about 10 times before someone else finally helped her. My soup was half full and my wrap had everything falling out. I understand the hiccups of a new business- learning how to work out the kinks, etc. BUT, there is something to be said about advertising yourself as fast service, when it takes 20+mins to get a wrap and soup. Not one apology was made for the length of time it took to receive my food and that also did not sit well with me. Own up to your mistakes and downfalls and at the same time, find ways to improve them. From the moment I walked in, they seemed disorganized and flustered. Don't let that show to your customers, find a way to organize the chaos. Needless to say, the food (which I had to eat hunched over at my desk instead of enjoying it in the shop because of the time it took to get), was good. I want to like this place and frequent it often. But until they get organized and faster service, I can't waste me time. Hope they can figure it all out!

We got to Salt and Straw.  And with all the hype, I guess I was expecting more.  The flavor combinations are creative and fun (but they are at What's the Scoop as well - my go-to favorite - see my review).  It was the mouth-feel (sometimes gritty) that turned me off.  And in some cases, I could have used more sugar in the ice creams.  I tasted several and settled on the Cinnamon Snickerdoodle - which was only okay and not something I'd order again - not sweet enough and too much cinnamon for me.  The Double Vanilla Fold was the biggest disappointment - it was vanilla, but I felt like I've had so many better vanillas out of a carton.The store itself is fun, and as a whole, it's okay - but sure seems over rated to me.  Try What's the Scoop - Salt and Straw can't hold a candle to their ice cream."},{"name":"Accanto","address":"2838 SE Belmont St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"My friend and I tried Accanto just on a whim. I'd driven by several times and it looked so warm and inviting from the outside. The inside doesn't disappoint. It's a very friendly atmosphere. We split the Albacore tartar and a delicious pasta dish, Maccheroni Alla Siracusana, with tomatoes that were dried in house, and beautifully cured olives. Everything tasted fantastic. I tend to be a pretty fast eater and had to remind myself to slow down so I could really taste each flavor. For dessert we split the chocolate cake with walnut brittle. Oh my gosh! Just when you think a meal can't get better! It was very rich - the cake was more like a slice of fudge. On top of the fantastic food, the staff was very friendly and knowledgeable. Our waitress gave us wonderful pointers on what might be fun to try. Obviously she did not steer us wrong.

All were delicious! We then moved onto dinner and the hubs and I ordered 5 (bold move, we know) more dishes: pappardelle, 6 oysters, tuna tartare, shrimp and shrooms on toast, and the petite filet. All were great minus the filet - it tasted a bit charred and just wasn't as interesting and flavorful as the other dishes. The table also got a handful of desserts to share.Overall, we had a great time. Everyone seemed to enjoy their shares! It is a loud restaurant, so you'd have to gauge your group if they'd like that atmosphere. Our server was fantastic! She was knowledgeable and continually checked on our group.

While I liked the flavors of the food, the place is just a mess in performance and the quantity of food for the price is outrageous. I should have been foreshadowed since we had sat down to review the menu and before we walked away to order, one of the owners grabbed my wife's fleece from the back of the chair and was headed off for unknown parts. I had to chase him down to get it. How did he not see us standing there? I ordered two tacos, my wife the Quesadilla with the nachos as opener. We placed the order on the chaotic line of confusion then awaited our food. When the food arrived we looked at each other in bewilderment. We had paid $30 for two mini corn tacos with minimal filling (will get to the rest of my criticism) and two Quesdaillas(?) on mini taco shells and two fountain drinks. We looked at each other and our jaws dropped at the same time. The mimi plate of nachos were totally covered with Cotija and that is all you could taste, when you could taste, as the chips were so thin they broke as you tried to pick them up. We wound up using our spoons to eat it and actually never finished it because of the massive amount of Cotija. The tacos came bare bones so we had to dress them up at the serving table. This so called serving table was about the size of a card table with people jostling for position or breathing down you neck waiting to take their turn. Poorly designed and located (it was next to the chaotic ordering line) but I do have to admit, the sauces, though thin, did have good flavor. I felt hurried as I did not want to hold up anyone in their attempts to adorn their tacos; unfortunately that wasn't the case for the person next to me who kept reaching over me to get to the items she wanted.

Being a tourist who happens to be a huge ice cream lover, I was dying to go here when I visited Portland and this was one of the top recommendations that my cousins told me about. Firstly, this place has the COOLEST and most unique flavors I've ever heard of, such as Lavender, Strawberry Honey Balsamic Vinegar, Pear Blue Cheese, and a bunch of other random concoctions. In addition to the awesome uniqueness of the flavors, the place itself is really nicely decorated and the customer service is amazing. That's what stood out to me because at a lot of ice cream places I've been to, the workers seem to really hate their job and get very irritable when you ask them to try a countless amount of flavors. However, at Salt & Straw during my experience, every single worker was extremely nice and patient, which made me feel really comfortable. Ended up getting a waffle cone double scoop of Sea Salt Caramel and Strawberry Honey Balsamic Vinegar and the quality of the ice cream was seriously amazing. Definitely liked the Sea Salt Caramel more, but the Strawberry Honey Balsamic Vinegar was a very cool experience, and tasted more vinegary to me, rather than strawberryish.

However, some kinks need to be worked out. Now, down to the nitty gritty. -The wait was about 15 mins to the cashier. There was a line outside of the door and a short line inside. It made sense because the area where you order is not that big. If they didn't have this system in place, everyone would be squished in a confined area. -We waited about another 15 mins until we received our food. They give you a buzzer and will track you down at your table which is fantastic seeing as there is basically no room inside to wait around. The only issue I noticed is that the seating is so staggered between the outside and inside, that the limited wait staff is zipping around all of these tables until they find the correct number on the buzzer. It's a good idea in theory, but having four waiters come to your table with the wrong food was a little imposing. Again, the system is not the wait staff's fault it's just the way it is until maybe the kinks are worked out.-Now the food. I had the three piece chicken tender meal (combo) with fries and a drink. I will say that my chicken tenders were not plump and juicy. They were thin, the breading slightly brittle, and not exactly what I expected. The dipping sauces (the meal comes with your choice of two) I chose were the peri peri sauce and the garlic parm sauce. The peri peri was a warm heat that stayed in the back of the throat. It had a strong red pepper taste (like Sabra red hummus). I liked it even though I'm not a spicy fan but do NOT eat this if your stomach is sensitive. The garlic parm was sharp and there was a prominent garlic flavor. I was disappointed in the tenders; decent flavor (mainly salt and pepper and probably another spice I don't know) but not plump. If I go to a chicken Guy, I want plump! The sauce and mixing these two sauces made the tenders taste pretty good. -My fianc√© ordered the chicken guy classic sandwich. Now that was T-H-I-C-K! It was reminiscent of a very famous chicken place's sandwich. The bun was buttery and slightly toasted. It came with cheddar cheese. We both agreed that a lukewarm square of a cheddar cheese did not jive well with a crispy and warm chicken breast. The condiments it came with (LTOP lettuce tomato onion pickle) were okay. I personally thought that the temperature differences in the sandwich kind of took away from the big bite. -The fries were lackluster. Reminiscent of Wendy's fries. The fried pickles were excellent--crispy and salty. The buttermilk ranch the pickles came with was creamy and definitely had a homemade taste. -OUR FAVORITE: the Cinnamon Toast Crunch milkshake!!!! Crunchy bits of Cinnamon Toast Crunch and a creamy vanilla base made it a sip from heaven. It was topped with whipped cream and crushed cinnamon toast for garnish. Delicious and DANGEROUSLY good. -Misc: packaging and branding was super cute. It's fun, colorful, and original. Other reviews show the example. Most eat with their eyes and I thought that their packaging was thoughtful on this concept. -More seating needed! We had to sit outside. Inside was ridiculously crowded. I think that the seating choices should have been more booth like; I noticed lots of families struggling to seat themselves at the small round tables. The place itself is pretty small though so it's hard to get around. -Overall, try it Guys! It's pretty good. $29 got us two decent meals with drinks and a milkshake.

We were seated right away and I was nervous about ordering since I don't know the names of the dim sum items but they have a picture menu in English to help you remember what you like to eat. Each dim sum item is $3.15, which is an average price for each dim sum dish. We ordered at least 5 things, plus 3 to go items for another friend. Our bill came up to be a little over $20 per person, which included tips. It was so expensive per person for dim sum considering we ordered to go and paid for our friend.Service was nothing special, but I wasn't expecting anything either considering we were eating in Chinatown. They weren't really attentive, but did what we asked and got our requested items right away such as water, soy sauce, another menu, etc. This is still better than most services for restaurants in Chinatown. Dim sum all tastes the same to me, GOOD. Although there are no women pushing carts around and it's made to order, the dim sum came out fairly fast & hot! We ordered the basic dim sum items, nothing out of the ordinary so everything tasted as expected. Their quantities for the rice noodles with shrimp/beef/scallions inside served with sweet soy sauce are larger than regular dim sum places. Usually you get 3 pieces at regular dim sum places but here you get 6! So if those noodles are your favorites, or your kids' favorite (kids love them) then this is your place to go! One of my new favorite dim sum items, which is the Chinese dough wrapped in rice noodle is sooo good here! They also have regular Chinese food items as well, & those soupy dumplings that they have like at Gourmet Dumpling House, which is a nice option! I would definitely love to come here again. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE the idea of eating fresh dim sum after 3PM. With this place, I don't have to worry about waking up early & rushing to make it by 3PM. As long as I wake up & go before they close at 10PM, I'm good! I want to go eat dim sum at like 8PM one day, just to say that I ate dim sum at that time haha.

And being in his kitchen, there were lots of little tips he shared throughout the evening that you could certainly never get from simply following a recipe!  We made seared tofu in ginger broth, homemade samosas, a cardamom nut curry dish and a tapioca pudding.  Once we were done with the cooking steps, Mark invited us all to get comfortable, enjoy the rest of our wine and artfully served each course, again indulging us in fascinating stories.We all had a really fun time, learned a lot (we were a mixed group from novice to experience cooks), and loved the final product!

The colorful cole slaw was amazing, crunchy and beautifully seasoned. I wanted to savor each bite to its absolute fullest, but I kept on shoving food in my mouth at an accelerated pace.And then I was sad...the food was all gone.

The spread was great with pumpernickel crisps and homemade sour cream, onion and chives with fresh salmon and trout roe. They had pickled carrots and beans as well. Nice acidity to the delicious blend of food. My bf got the sandwich with the frites on it. The sausage was savory but a bit lacking side on the protein.

After tasting the refreshing light, yet crispy calamari, I immediately turned to my boyfriend and said, \\"this is the best calamari I've ever had.\\"  To my surprise, he looked up, and said, \\"it really is, isn't it?\\"  The mushrooms were also quite good - not at all oily.  The entrees were just as fantastic - I had haddock stuffed with lobster, scallops and cous-cous, which came with asparagus and a heaping side of pasta.  My boyfriend had the chicken saltimbocca, which he thought was a little heavy, but I think that had something to do with the number of stuffed mushrooms he'd had.  I tasted it, and thought the sauce was the perfect combination of butter and marsala.  To be honest, the salads before dinner left a little to be desired, but that was a minor fault considering how good the rest of the food was.  I had the pasta for lunch the next day, and to my complete surprise, it tasted as good cold as it had hot the night before.

Upon ordering, I was asked if I wanted the sandwich heated up. The prospect of a cold Monte Cristo sandwich did not appeal so I said yes. As she made her way to the microwave, I immediately regretted this decision. What I wanted was a nice, hot, and crispy sandwich from a panini maker or press of some kind. What I got was a soggy, half hot, half cold mess. I also had an issue with the fact that there were no preserves served with the Monte Cristo.

I ordered black bean rice with oxtail and plantains.  It also came with a side dished of potato salad (kinda salty to my liking) and a small container of some sort of slaw (which was spicy).  The oxtail flavor was good and tendor, but not as fall off the bone as I like my oxtail.   Dished came to $14, hmm, I didn't know since there was no menu, so I was suprised.

When it was my turn to order a drink I was about to tell her what I wanted and the waitress immediately said no before I could even tell her my order and then gestured \\"give it here\\" with her hand cupped upside down - meaning my id. Then upon viewing my id she exclaimed \\"oh wow you are a lot older than I thought.\\" We ordered arancini, melanzana, caesar salads, and caprese to start. The arancini had a nice crisp outer layer and soft insides and I would order it again. The melanzana was served with a creamy pesto style sauce which was also really good.The caesar salad was a bit too creamy, and the caprese was extremely skimpy on the tomatoes - more salad than caprese.Another waitress came over and took our dinner order. For entrees, I had the della case with linguine which was served in a large portion and was very good. Other entrees that impressed include the lobster ravioli (larger size than expected), the saut√©ed chicken, and the rack of lamb.

The inside has has a nice warm feeling to it, and the deep red walls and local art add to the experience.  When we arrived around 6:30, the restaurant was full of people of varying ages from late 20's to well in their 60's.  The bar area looked nice, and well stocked, but we were fortunate enough to sit almost immediately.We were greeted almost immediately by our server who took our drink orders and provided rolls that were perfectly crusty on the outside and warm and soft on the inside.  Their drink menu was really robust and unique (the first time I've seen Dark n' Stormy on a drink menu ever), and their wine list was decent as well.My wife wasn't super hungry, so I was the only one to order an appetizer.  I had a bowl of the lobster bisque and it was amazing, and loaded with entire chunks of claw meat.For dinner I ordered the rib eye and my wife ordered the stuffed statler chicken breast.  My steak was perfectly cooked.  The mushroom reduction added great flavor to the meal, and I was quite pleased.  My wife never eats chicken on the bone, and was surprised when her chicken breast was not boneless and/or skinless.  She ate it anyway, and was really happy with the meal.  She had been up in the air between the chicken, the salmon and the haddock, and plans on trying the haddock the next time we go.After we had eaten dinner, Bobby Walsh Jr, the son of the father-son owner team came to our table to discuss our dinner and offer us anything else we might need.  He showed genuine concern in assuring that we enjoyed our dining experience there, and we both told him we were quite pleased.Overall our first experience at Bobby's was excellent.

In all I had that terrible kid attitude in the back seat and didn't trust my fellow YELP community. WELL I WAS COMPLETELY 110% wrong. This place is a hidden gem as I was unworthy to be graced with its presence. You won't find yuppies here mostly, middle aged people that work at the airport, but this shouldn't shy you away.You pull off the exit on Virginia into a shabby part of town, pull to the right and a couple of miles down the scenery starts to change drastically the further down. I was already impressed when I spotted Manchester Arms. It's a charming house with a small outdoor porch area that you have to love. The outdoor seating is done wonderfully with a small but quaint inside. It's about as cozy as a pub can be. We sat down, and were greeted by a tall, sandy, spiked and grey haired man. He wasn't our waiter, but always checked on us to see how we were doing at the time. I began to ask him about the place. He gave me the whole story, saying how it was founded by a man from Manchester. He breathed passion about the establishment that was contagious. He gave us the most important tip of the night that the key to the best food here were the specials. I ordered a beer as did my colleague. I love it when they bring out the beer in the brewery glasses (duvel in a duvel glass, perfect). They also pour Guinness the right way. Letting it sit for five minutes then they finish off the top, such a nice touch.I glanced over the menu, to see nothing truly special. Burgers, bangers and mash, fish and chips and so on. I did watch the entr√©es go out and they looked as perfect in quality as one could hope for. The fish and chips were flakey and the blue cheese chips looked divine. I decided to hear about the specials from our waiter. She went through the specials with my jaw falling to the floor. Smoked pork chop, salmon in a risotto with a truffle sauce, short ribs. I can't remember the exact descriptions, but they all sounded so wonderful. The specials are like a hidden second menu. I believe there were 8 deliciously prepared specials that night. I tried to get the pork chop, but they had already run out. I went back to that kid who is in the back seat of the car with his arms crossed, basically being a little b. I got my salmon risotto and take it I'm not big on salmon. It perfectly blew my mind. Buttery risotto and a salmon with a charred outside. I was again unworthy of its taste.

The caramel was intensely salty... maybe just a bit too much, but close to balanced with the sweetness.  Both flavors were really pushed to their maximum, but not in a bad way.  The mince pie was authentically British but perhaps a bit overspiced for my taste.  The ice cream itself is intensely custardy; you can tell you are eating a lot of egg yolks.  For that reason, a kids' suffices for a normal adult serving, and a single for splitting between two adults.This was the best ice cream I've had recently.  The flavors are very intense, and they walk very close to the line of being correctly balanced, because it is on that thin edge of perfect balance that flavor magic happens.  Folks might disagree about whether the balance in a given flavor is quite right--but that is only because the flavors are each so powerful that the balance must be perfect.Update: okay, now I think that a single is just plenty for an adult, no need to split.  Thoughts on other flavors:\\nFavorites: \\nSnickerdoodle: delicious, outstanding cinnamon cookie dough ice cream\\nPear blue cheese: also outstanding, blue cheese not at all overstated, would definitely get againOther:\\nBalsamic strawberry pepper: good, felt the acid was lacking in the depth and richness that could accompany a top balsamic, seemed somehow a \\"thin\\" acidity\\nOlive oil: tastes just like it sounds.  Weird.\\nAlmond ganache: good for what it is, though did not personally care for ganache ice cream so much.\\nHoney lavender: lots of lavender, not as obvious on the honey.

I've pretty much only done the buffet and not ordered from the menu. The food itself is actually pretty good and the price is very reasonably priced, but the set up can make it a little tricky because of the small buffet tables when people are swarming around. Since it's one of those businesses that's in what used to be a house, it does have it's own charm that way, but it can be kind of cramped. As small as it is, you would think that it would mean your glass would always be in the line of sight so that refills wouldn't be too far off, but that's not the case. Consistently, we've had to flag someone down to get water refills. For some odd reason, this place also always feels a little humid, regardless of season (and it's not like this is the tropics here in Beaverton...). Even still, this place would get 4 stars from me if it weren't for a really yucky experience - somehow there was this odd  clump in my rice that I accidentally ate and had to spit out because it smelled bad, like a weird sweaty feet stinky smell that I can't describe and hope I never experience again. The only reason this place even gets 3 stars is because I'd been there so very many times (though never since) when the food really actually did taste good despite all of my other minor gripes. So, 3 stars it is. You might enjoy it, and if not, at least you aren't broke.

I was able to call in advance for reservations for a party of 10 people for 6pm on a Saturday. The reservation process was flawless and Swift's Attic had confirmed the day before my reservations. Note you can also do reservations online with a smaller party size.Upon arrival, the table was just finishing getting set up as the majority of my party arrived early. We were able to sit at the table before everyone arrived which was helpful. There were no drink menus at the table but that was quickly rectified and our table started with some drinks. I also had ordered the Blistered Shishitos and Nuoc Cham Brussels Sprouts for the table so we could all share. The shishitos were hit or miss on spiciness but overall good. The Brussel sprouts were tasty and it seemed the table enjoyed them.As we moved onto our main meal, we learned as we placed our orders that we couldn't split the bill. This ended up being an issue at the end of the night figuring out who ordered what meals, splitting the tax and tip for everyone at the table. As a whole party, it was not fair to split evenly between everyone as people ordered their own meals and drinks for themselves. For my main, I ordered the Atlantic salmon which was described as Thai dashi, black sesame paste, broccolini, preserved citrus. Overall it was just okay but honestly nothing special. I can make my own salmon better.  My husband ordered the Korean BBQ Flank Steak which was described as crispy kimchi jumeok bap cake, grilled scallion, sweet galbi sauce. My husband said the flank steak was meh and tough but the kimchi jumeok bap cake was amazing. It was interesting to note that his portion was much larger and cheaper than my poor small salmon fillet. Before we ordered our meals we were told that this was a family sharing style restaurant. I found this concept strange with the way the food was presented. My salmon filet would have been awkward to share with a large party, even if we ordered the suggested two dishes per table. It would have been great for 2-4 people but not our party size.I would consider coming back but never with a large party. The issue with not being able to split up the bill should have been informed when I making the reservations. Our party was a total of 9 people (1 person had to cancel very last minute). I don't see why making it into 6 checks would have been an issue.Overall, the food was hit or miss and the drinks were good."},{"name":"The Manchester Arms","address":"1705 Virginia Ave","city":"College Park","stars":"4","text":"Great food, great service, and a good beer selection.

However what we received instead was no broccoli and the flavor of shrimp is salt and pepper. The other shrimp flavor was so intensely sweet and vinegary, but was edible. I should have read it more carefully, but c'mon, that is a pretty annoying misrepresentation and not to mention overpriced. I also ordered the ramen soup with beef, but it didn't come with any of the toppings or egg in the photo. It doesn't have the ramen broth you would expect. It does not look at all like the photo.

I politely told him I didn't like it and that it's not a big deal and that they can leave it on the table.

I strongly disliked their Jack Daniel's -centric menu they promoted. It turned me off, and ultimately turned me away. So, as you can see, when this place was suggested for a Sunday lunch, I was upset that I got outvoted. I was mentally prepared to be disappointed, even before setting foot inside. As we walked in, we were greeted right away, and had to wait a few minutes for a table to become available. I immediately had visions of their poor attempt at a \\"heathy\\" salad bar. The Ruby restaurant chain has always boasted about their wonderful salad bar. Over the past several years, I had always thought it sucked: Not the best looking lettuce, limited amounts of toppings that always seemed to be empty, and pasta salads that involved too much dressing and not enough \\"meat\\". I'm glad to inform that (at least this store) has taken great strides to improve the salad bar! 3 kinds of fresh lettuce and many more, fully stocked, toppings where all on the ice bar. One thumbs up. I also hated coming here previously, because I disliked all the \\"Jack Danials\\" BBQ-esque sauce that they put on top of, what seemed, everything. I strongly dislike BBQ, thus this was the nail in the coffin. I was over joyous when I noticed this Chaim's menu has been revamped and now only has a few offerings with the trademark sauce - thank you, chefs above!! I ordered the Grilled Chicken Cobb Salad. Fresh toppings atop a decent portion of mixed greens! Before, if I ordered a salad, I could expect it to have too much toppings, and not enough greens. Another plus up for this establishment!

Money well spent for me. Pakwan serves lunch buffet throughout the week. I am not a big fan of eating from the buffet, I decided to try the lunch buffet and it has satisfied my appetite.  They always have different items for lunch buffet. I gave them a five star because they have improved the quality of the food in a very short time. I think its been a Month since they opened. Their lunch buffet goes for $10.00 from Monday through Friday and during weekends its $11.00 with additional items.. however I was told that they will reduced the buffet price for the holidays.  Normally the food on the buffet is greasy at other restaurants. I am amazed with the quality of the buffet food at pakwan. Its very light and fresh.  I have read comments of other people who have been to this restaurant. Some of them have wrote pretty nasty comments about pakwan which almost made me think twice before I decided to eat at this place again. I have to say that my 2nd visit was very pleasant. I feel confident to recommend pakwan to my friends.

I've never had a great Indian buffet so I didn't have high expectations. The food was semi-warm, the naan was hard to chew, and the buffet didn't list the ingredients in anything so it was hard to tell if things were vegetarian or vegan or similar. It was just okay. I wouldn't pay that price again or go back. The poor waitress kept asking us if we wanted something else to drink besides water but they had no drink menu listed and hadn't offered to tell us the drinks available.

It seems like tons of people have already written stellar reviews, so I'll start by corroborating and saying that Tasty's easily lives up to the hype. My entire groups food was amazing, so much so that our entr√©e's became everyone's shared entr√©e's(I never like choosing one thing so this was awesome). We had the Alabama BBQ chicken, carbonara, fried catfish, and shrimp & grits. -I ordered the Alabama BBQ Chicken, have never had white BBQ sauce, it was one very tasty learning experience.\\n-The carbonara was incredibly rich and packed with cured pork(pancetta cubes maybe?). They top it with an egg yolk that you mix in yourself to finish the sauce, this is an important aspect to carbonara that some actual Italian places often disregard. This way is preferred as the egg becomes part of the sauce, adding a unique consistency instead of cooking in and becoming solid-ish.\\n-The fried catfish was legendary, it's miles from bar food fish and chips. It's seasoned to perfection and has a light flaky breading that's done just right, avoiding becoming a grease sponge. Probably the best catfish anywhere west of the Mississippi.\\n-The shrimp & grits were tasty as well. Tbh I'm not a fan of grits, but this dish was the perfect ambassador and has me convinced that I just didn't have good grits before. I devoured my portion of this dish as well as the cheesy grits side dish. When my girlfriend said, \\"I though you don't like grits\\", I simply smiled and kept shoveling in the deliciousness :) .\\n-Then there's the sides... Oh the sides... I could come here for lunch and make a meal of just the sides. Everything is good. Seriously. You could just point blindly and be satisfied. I actually made fun of my buddy for ordering fries at a place with better options, but when they came I was eating my words, and his fries, haha. There's also a side called the spicy watermelon salad. I was sure it was the strangest flavor combination in the world, but once you try it then it makes sense. The cheesy grits and the corn cake are to die for too. The corn cake comes in a little skillet still sizzling with butter, it didn't last long once at the table.Great service, great food, and a great atmosphere. Highly recommended.

I've now been to Elephant Hut twice, once for dinner, once for lunch. For dinner, I had Drunken Noodles and tried Chicken Satay, pork sausage fresh rolls, and some soup. For lunch I had Pad Thai and tried the lunch version of Satay (which was different from dinner) as well as green curry. I hoped to really like this place. I like the decor, the service is friendly, and I'm a huge fan of good, fresh, Thai food. A negative on the decor - the silky napkins work better as decorations than as things to use if you end up with sauce on your fingers or mouth, and the (lucite?) chopsticks are really slippery to use. Fashion before function, in a sense. The silverware works and is attractive.On the food... the Drunken Noodles were a big disappointment. They were fairly dry and not terribly flavorful. The soup was good, fresh flavors that I enjoyed, though it could have been spicier (there is hot sauce on the table in another somewhat less than functional serving tool - the lid contraption tends to fall into one's plate). Pad Thai was very sweet, which wasn't bad once I dumped a bunch of shiracha on it, I liked the tamarind aspect to it. However the terribly small serving of tofu (protein additions are all the same price, which is odd) was so overly fried for the tiny piece sizes that I couldn't eat it. The one piece I put in my mouth I ended up chewing on like a piece of over-done calamari, for about a minute. Lame. It had a lot of green onions and a bit of some other vegetable. I had requested no bean sprouts and apparently that caused a delay of close to ten minutes after the twenty minutes that the other two people in my party had waited for their food. I think a 30 minute wait for food, without comment, and without perhaps a complimentary cup of soup or something as certain other establishments offer is a bit unacceptable. When I commented on the overdone tofu it was mentioned that they had just noticed the need to cut the pieces larger and cook them less, however there was no offer to adjust our bill (two of our entrees contained the overdone tofu), and I didn't push for it. The chicken satay was pretty good. At lunch it comes with rice, today served lukewarm. I don't remember it coming with anything apart from the chicken when we ordered it at dinner, but they may have modified the menu in the time between our visits. I have liked the tastes of curries that I've had, both the green curry and the soup we had at dinner. They seem to do curries/sauces better than noodles. I'd skip the slightly odd assortment of things in the sausage spring rolls. Maybe the place is inconsistent? I think the prices are way high for what you get, apart from the freshness of the food. I would pay more for free-range chicken and humanely raised beef, etc., (not that those are on the menu) but paying four dollars for a Thai iced tea seems a bit much. Sadly, I doubt I'll make it there for a third attempt. I wish it were better, I really do.

I was hungry so I opted for the three item combo. This is when it got strange and why this review is four stars instead of five. Something I love to do when I encounter a menu on which everything looks good is request that the chef choose for me. I figure they invented and are preparing the food so they'll probably combine better than I could, ignorant of the subtle flavors of each dish. So I asked the server to have the chef choose a three-item combination for me. She then proceeded to rattle off three dishes that she thought I should have, as though I'd asked because I couldn't make a decision instead of honoring my desired gastronomic adventure with the chef. I simply asked again that the chef choose my combination. She was indignant and snapped, \\"We usually don't get that here.\\"The plate that came out included the butter lettuce salad, buffalo chicken sandwich, and squash soup, all of which were delicious individually.

If you want a decent burger for a decent price, this is your place. However, in my opinion there are some serious flaws. The burgers are pre-frozen, an egregious mistake in a place that headlines hamburgers. While the pattys are juicy, I find that the freezer severely diminishes the flavor. Plus, who wants a \\"perfect patty.\\" If I am paying 5-8 dollars for my burger, I expect that more time is put into the preparation than McDonalds. My second complaint with the burgers is that the lettuce is low quality iceberg, and the resulting chunks put into the burger do nothing to accentuate the flavor. On the positive side, Lee's offers a \\"special sauce,\\"  a mayonnaise based concoction that is good with burgers and fries alike. My complaint with the fries follows a similar tack. The fries are pre-made and frozen, eradicating any last bastion of flavor and depth. In addition, the potatoes do not have skin, which further reduces flavor. I have found the service staff at Lee's to be a mixed bag. While some cashiers are helpful, my order has twice been misheard and forgotten. Once I waited 30 minutes for chicken fingers, only to discover they had forgotten my order. Overall, with some small changes this could easily become my favorite restaurant in Newton Centre. WIth fresher and higher quality ingredients, this place could be a real hit!"},{"name":"Atasca","address":"50 Hampshire St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"One of the best places in Cambridge to take out-of-town visitors. They have a whole page of tapas-type small plates if your visitors are people you like. If you're entertaining folks with whom you would prefer not to share your food, the entrees are enormous for one. (And the vinho verde -- sort of a cross between champagne and Sprite -- will make any company more congenial!) In the summertime you can get a table out under the grape arbor and, depending on the time of year and the position of your chair, actually reach up and pick grapes. Where else can you do that in Cambridge, Massachusetts? Even in the colder months, the inside is a feast for the eyes, full of painted Portuguese pottery.Be sure to try the black-eyed pea salad, the chourico (chorizo) pate', the yummy fish fritters, and anything with bacalhau (salt cod) in it. Extra points if your bacalhau dish comes with those fabulous Portuguese fries that resemble nothing so much as thick, tender potato chips."},{"name":"Beat Brasserie","address":"13 Brattle St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"Great vibe and music last night but the staff needs to chill out.

The ingredients were extremely fresh, the wait staff was attentive and the ambiance was just right. Since we were with a large party Chef Leahy prepared a large assortment of tapas for our group. I thought the charred brussels sprouts were great - crispy and drizzled with a sweet chili sauce.  OMG, the deviled eggs were yummy.  Red peppers with goat cheese round out my top three dishes.   Dessert was amazing.  I think chocolate should be it's own food group and thus the flourless chocolate brownie was my favorite.   We also had the bread pudding. I'm not a huge fan of soggy bread but this bread pudding has just the right amount of moistness and wasn't overly sweet. It wears garnished with marshmallow.I'm definitely going back to Saltyard!Oh, just before we left Chef Leahy allowed us try some of his special sauces.

A very minor caveat or two: the meal is a full 3 hours plus.  Be prepared for a long night.  The earlier seating at 6pm is better if you are not a night owl.  Also, the chairs are small and are not exactly designed for a long night.  The seating is family style, at one of two long, common tables, so be prepared to share conversations with your neighbors.

That in itself is weird, but downright bad when it's supposed to be gluten free.  The Tom Kha soup was loaded with carrots and zuchini and it didn't taste the least bit \\"Thai.\\"   We waited quite a long time for our food, and it was WAY less than average tasting.  Maybe one can't expect good Thai in Dublin Ohio, but this wasn't worth anywhere near what we paid for dinner.  VERY disappointing, and STEER CLEAR if you're gluten free.  They don't get it!"},{"name":"Muqueca Restaurant","address":"1008 Cambridge St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Hadn't been to the new location but finally made it twice in one week. The new place has a friendly bar and a waiting area. It's much larger than the old spot but still intimate enough. Each time we have been, every table was taken. We continue to enjoy the various seafood stews, for the most part. They are full of rich, hearty flavor and very satisfying. Large portions make it easy to share. Our hearts of palm and tomato salad was sadly drab and uninspired, however, with very little flavor. A morose looking little scoop of white rice arrived five minutes before the muqueca.  Everything is been achingly slow. Our drinks sit on the end of the bar for ten minutes as our server walks right past them. Finally we had to point out that they were there. It took her another five minutes to bring them over. Our pitcher of sangria was very welcome but a bit too Hawaiian punch-like for my taste. The fruit smoothies are extremely satisfying, however. The best time to go is at lunch when you virtually have the place to yourselves. The menu is the same and the service is a lot quicker. Dinner can be a true test of your patience. We waited over an hour after ordering one night to get any food whatsoever. The other night it was forty five minutes. The people who work here are really nice and we do like the food. Hopefully, they can iron out the wrinkles and we can leave not feeling as irritated. We keep trying."},{"name":"Southern Kin Cookhouse","address":"500 Assembly Row","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"Love it!! A little pricey but the food was amazing! Very southern feel.

Once we were seated about 30 minutes later the ambiance changed a bit. The bar emptied and it turned more into a classy restaurant. The wait staff were all very friendly. I had the fish and chips which came with a huge piece of fish! Very tasty and it came with cole slaw, tartar sauce, and vinegar for the fries. The only reason I'm giving it 3 stars is because it was very loud and I found myself struggling to hear the person I was with.

The food here is the classic, earthy Mexican food that I miss, although closer to Baha than Brownsville. The salsas are rich and flavorful. The rice is fluffy and tasty.

Back patio is great and lots of people bring their dogs, so it turns into a sort of alcoholic petting zoo. Good times, good people, good drinks and food. The chicken strips were amazing the first time we had them, but the last couple they've been overcooked and too crispy. They were *perfect* when not overdone. Life changing. Admittedly I was very stoned when I ate them, but as a stoner I'm pretty sure I know a good chicken strip when I taste one, thank you very much. Design of the place is great, very welcoming, homey vibe because it's in an old house. If it's haunted, then the ghosts are way chill, because I didn't get any neg feels like someone once got trapped in a tunnel and sold to China but now they're back for some reason and watching me drink because apparently that's what you do in the afterlife.

I consulted my taste buds and they unanimously decided they should hold the tie for title spot. When you first walk in, you just know that's it going to be one of those cozy experiences: ample samples sported on silver spoons, smiling staff who take pride in what's behind these flavours, and an assortment of concoctions that I can only describe as creatively artisanal. I've also come to learn that their ice creams have an extremely high milk fat base which might be bad for the waistline, but tasty on the tongue.

Tom Yum Soup - It was good.. not great but good. Just a bit too spicy for my tastePork Potstickers - Crispy on the outside soft on the inside, not greasy, hot and delicious and perfectly golden brown.. wish I'd had more! Thai Tea - As mention before.. I LOVE their Thai Tea.. for only 1.50 you can get a big ole' thai tea with coconut milk, cream, or chocolate syrup.. and i think soy is an option too.. don't quote me on that.All in all it was a pretty good stop for lunch and the value was pretty darn good also. Didn't blow my mind out the water or anything but it was still a pretty good choice.

My boyfriend had the biscuits with the sausage gravy and he is still talking about them. Really laid back vibe even though it gets really packed.

When my office needs catering - we go with Max's. We fax over complex orders, they call us to confirm they received it, and they never mess it up. Delivery is on the dot. The garden salad with tuna salad is my go-to choice. The salad is pre-made with very leafy greens (note they have other salad offerings) thus it's very quick to grab. The tuna salad is tastes fresh and they don't overdoit with the mayo. The clam chowder and gumbo are to die for.  All these run around $8. If you're looking for something a little cheaper, the grilled cheese is delicious at about $5. For desert, their molasses cookie is the way to go. I only suggest you steer clear of the french fries and curry. Reality of the matter is that like many deli's in the area, it gets insanely busy during lunch time. So, I just go either around 11am or closer to 2pm. Not a big deal. Although a lot of lunch places downtown close around 4pm - Max's stays open til about 6pm. The only downside is that sometimes they charge me different prices for the same thing. One day one cashier will charge me $7.95, another will charge $8.50. It's bizarre and the only reason I've stopped going as often. In summary - simple.

In fact everything I have tasted from their buffalo chicken sandwich, to their po' boy shrimp, to chicken strips and fries, and huge salads have all been really good. But its not just an evening hotspot. Surprisingly, Crooked Bayou has a whole other persona come late night. This little Big Easy turns underground as a house DJ spins a mix of techno/trance for those young people against the mainstream Wall St. and Church St scenes. The inside is small but intimate, a quality most Orlando establishments lack and is decorated to look like a wooded swamp land complete with a sprawling tree.

Okay? I love it and I shouldn't.I tend to stay away from buffets. But this one is salad, so it's sort of healthy, right? No. You can fool yourself, but it's not. Oh, and buffets aren't renowned for their cleanliness. I'm sure this one is no different, but if you went to a buffet expecting it to be clean, you went to the wrong place. That's like people who go to farmer's markets who are surprised when their food has dirt in it. It was just in the ground, dummies!I also tend to stay away from chains. But this is a chain from my childhood! Souper Salad took over what used to be Lettuce Souprise You (and how could you NOT go to a restaurant with such a ridiculous pun for a name?) in Meyerland Plaza in Houston in the dawn of my youth, and I will always, always love it. My grandma explained what a prostitute is to me here (because we saw a real live one!!). I skipped Sunday School with my bestie and we always walked to Souper Salad. I had a tearful fight with my mom about where I'd go to college here. So many memories.\\n \\nAnyway, let me tell you about the corn fettucine dish. This is the main reason I go there. It's neither soup nor salad...it could pass for a pasta salad, maybe...it's extremely overcooked fettucine, with creamed corn, scallions, and more mayo than anyone would care to know about. And it is JUST DELICIOUS. I'm not saying I'm proud, but some days this is all I want.Honestly, the salad bar ain't half bad. They have just about every salad topping you could want. Perhaps not the best quality, but still. The soups can be hit or miss...sometimes they scare me off because they form skins from sitting out for a while. The cornbread is pretty good, as is the gingerbread. So are the potatoes if you want to carb-bomb. I've stayed away from the taco/pizza area, as well as the desserts, but that's just me. I have a one track mind, and it takes me STRAIGHT to the fettucine. Anyway, it's pretty cheap. They've started having waiters come around and get you drinks, so you have to tip, but I guess it's not so bad. Often, I get the buffet. It costs about $8.50 with tax and they just give you a bunch of takeout containers so you can stuff them full and have food for days. Not a bad deal at all.Shake them haterz off, Souper Salad.

The main floor is a bakery with wood floors that could have been there when Austin was founded. The restaurant is in the basement with a pseudo-industrial feel with lots of exposed wood, metals, floor rafters that actually look like 2 x 8s show that this building is infact laced with history. This restaurant has classic German fare of pretzels and sausage. There is of course more but you can only eat so much in one meal.

Having just moved back into our home in Hollywood after being out of state for 4 years, I was about to go to American Dream Pizza, our old neighborhood pizza joint.  But after reading reviews about all the attitude you have to endure with your pizza there these days, I decided to give UFO a shot instead.  Called in for take-out.  Nice guy on the phone and when I picked it up. Pizza and salad ready in 15 mins.  All good there.The Greek Salad was really great!  We love quality salads (veggies!) as much as pizza.  And the side salad size was plenty for us to share along with pizza, even though the size of the box it came in for take out didn't look like it would even feed one of us.  But plenty of fresh, quality mixed greens, delicious feta, and the other usual Greek salad ingredients were packed into the tiny box.  That was 5 star pizza joint salad for sure.But the pizza was just A-OK.  We ordered a create your own: mushroom, onion, black olive, roasted garlic and pepperoni (have to admit, I wished they had a few more options to choose from, like artichokes, red bell peppers...).  The crust looked beautiful, like it was hand tossed.  But as other yelpers have said, the toppings were sparse.  And I don't need the toppings to be piled high Pizza Hut style... but they could have easily been double what they were for my taste.. especially becuz as others have said, given the price tag of 1.50 per topping.  I \\"think\\" the sauce was great... maybe slightly spicy, which I would love... but I couldn't quite tell becuz there was also too much saltiness from (I'm guessing) the pepperoni, and it  wiped out and over powered the hints of spiciness.  Let's put it this way, I still ate 1 1/2 slices... but if it had been 4 or 5 star pizza, I probably would have eaten 2 - 2 1/2 slices."},{"name":"Turner's Seafood - Salem","address":"43 Church St","city":"Salem","stars":"4.5","text":"Beautiful birthday dinner, happened to be seated right next to the fireplace.

The initial estimate they gave us was 1 hour 15 min, so it's a good thing we decided not to leave since it was much faster than anticipated. They have stumptown drip coffee ($2) that you can drink while you wait, which definitely helped with the wait.Food we tried:CHOCOLATE POTATO DOUGHNUT ($1.50 each) : This was my favorite! Deliciously chocolately without being overly sweet. It went perfectly with the creme anglaise sauce too.  GLAZED YAMS ($4) :  I didn't really like this dish. I usually like yams a lot, but I felt the cumin-honey flavor was a little strange and would have much rather just had plain yams.MOROCCAN CHICKEN HASH ($10): It was served with harissa cream and an over say egg. I loved the flavor of everything, but after a few bites it was way to salty and I had to ask for some bread to go with it. BURMESE RED PORK STEW ($9) : This actually reminded me of a Taiwanese pork rice dish and was even served with a similarly stewed boiled egg. Flavor was pretty good but on the sweet side. Just a few bites is perfect because I think too many would be sickeningly sweet.PORK CUTLET WITH FRIED EGG & SPINACH ($10) : Loved the breading on this but like the chicken hash was definitely on the salty side. Overall it was a good restaurant but I don't think I'll be coming back.

The name alone beckons hipsters from far and wide, I'm sure.I got the lunch special (11am-4pm) which is a half sandwich, a small side, and a tea or coffee for $9. I got the roast beef sandwich, and it was basically the size of a whole sandwich. It was really good (though not anything super special, although coming from a northeastern bread snob, the bread was excellent), as was the potato salad I got on the side. My server, Mia, was really awesome; I left an unfinished beer at my table while I ran to the restroom, and when I came back, the beer was gone. I was totally okay with it, but Mia brought me a small glass of the beer I had ordered because she noticed that someone had taken it before I was finished. That's great service right there!The only reason this gets four stars instead of five is because I feel like an establishment that describes itself as a beer garden should probably have more than 33 beers on tap. They have a good variation of beers, but only a couple of each (for example, I love IPAs, but they only had I think four on tap). Also, as I mentioned, the food is good not great, but I guess that's not what most people would go to a beer garden for.

The lettuce in our salads was all hand torn with no knife cuts, a small detail to be sure, but a pleasant surprise. The atmosphere is neighborhood casual where you can wear your Red Sox hat at the table and fit in. Our pasta dishes were both oversized and very well done with fresh handmade pasta offered in 6 different shapes. (A very rare thing). Service was slow, and the only off note about eating here.It took a half hour to get bread on the table because the waitress was waiting for the kitchen to slice the bread. Why not give her a knife and let her slice it herself? The kitchen has more than enough to do. It reminded me of one of the better neighborhood Italian restaurants that spoiled me in North Jersey growing up and tuned me into a tough critic when it comes to Italian restaurants.

The restaurant is in its own small standalone building next door to the Em & Toi Vietnamese cafe. The business proudly displays the Honduran flag on its storefront.The restaurant essentially consists of one giant room with a bar, booths, and several tables. The bar seats six, there are five booths that comfortably seat four, and there's a collection of small tables that can seat about 40. The dimly lit space has a bar atmosphere with multiple TVs (great for watching futbol/soccer matches) and big speakers that can play loud music. One end of the restaurant has a music jukebox and four digital slot machines. The other end has an open room off to the side with a single pool table and additional seating.Las Palmeras serves a variety of traditional Honduran cuisine including baleadas, pastelitos, and tajadas con pollo. Similar to tacos, but uniquely Honduran, baleadas consist of soft wheat flour tortillas with various fillings. Pastelitos are similar to empanadas. They're fried pastries filled with meat, except pastelitos use corn flour instead of wheat flour for a distinctly different taste. The restaurant also serves Honduran breakfast and dinner combination plates and Hispanic foods like fajitas, steak, pork chops, fried whole fish, pechuga a la plancha (grilled chicken breast), and soups including mondongo (tripe/stomach soup). Expect to spend about $12-15 each for most dishes.Outside of beer, beverages include horchata (sweet rice drink) and juices such as pina (pineapple juice), jamaica (purple hibiscus juice), maracuya (passion fruit), and nance (a yellow fruit from Central America). Like other Hispanic restaurants, Las Palmeras has fountain machines behind the counter where these drinks are constantly being mixed.Here's a rundown of the foods I've tried:* Tajadas con Pollo - chicken and fried plantains\\n* Ejemplar Hondureno (Honduran Sampler) - taco, enchilada, baleada, pastelitos\\n* Baleadas - Honduran handmade tortillas with beans, steak, and eggs\\n* Sopa de Res - beef soup with carrots and potatoes\\n* Cena Hondurena (Traditional Honduran Dinner) - white rice, beans, cheese, egg, steak, sour cream, sweet plantains, avocadoThe Tajadas con Pollo consisted of a lightly fried chicken thigh drizzled in a special, mildy spicy, somewhat creamy sauce. The chicken was A-OK. It was served atop a shredded cabbage salad and fried plantains. The fried plantains were sort of like potato chips - crispy, but thicker. There was a side of chimol, which is Honduran/Salvadorian salsa, much like pico de gallo with chopped tomatoes, onions, and peppers.The Honduran Sampler was a bit of a letdown primarily because the food on this plate came out cold. The enchilada was piled high and there was plenty of ensalada (of cabbage, both red and green) on this plate. The pastelitos tasted alright to me. The ground beef inside each pastry was savory, but the exterior breading seemed overly greasy and perhaps maybe even overcooked. The highlight of the Sampler was the simple bean-only baleada, which had been cut into two halves. The handmade tortilla was soft and the bean filling satisfying.And while the \\"plain\\" bean baleada is good, you have the option to add other ingredients (e.g. steak, eggs, avocado) if you order a set of baleadas separately. I sampled the steak and eggs baleada and it was pretty good. The eggs were fluffy and the small slices of steak were tasty. The freshly griddled tortillas were the best part though.The Sopa de Res (beef soup) wasn't bad. It was a simple soup with bone-on chunks of beef and large slices of carrots and potatoes. A small plate of white rice was served on the side. The thin, slightly oily broth, was nice and comforting. The version I tried didn't look nearly as complete/fulfilling as the one posted to Las Palmeras' Facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/LasPalmerasAtlanta/photos/a.737545336311056.1073741832.491180100947582/788177464581176/?type=1). That one contained corn with a slice of lime and a tortilla on the side.The Traditional Honduran Dinner was mediocre. Usually dinner plates at Hispanic restaurants are packed with tons of food and meat, but the Honduran Dinner (and Breakfast) here seemed to be lacking. The only difference between the dinner and breakfast plates is you get steak on the dinner plate and chorizo sausage on the breakfast plate. The tiny slice of steak I had was very rubbery and chewy. Also, the kitchen apparently ran out of plantains/maduros. The salty Honduran cheese was interesting, though I can't say I'm a fan.The Carne Molida con Tajadas (ground beef with fried plantains) and Fajitas Mixtas (fajitas with chicken, shrimp, steak) looked great with generous portions.Service is slow, but the staff is nice.

Finally, the hot pot itself offers a variety of soup bases and ingredients. I tried the Tom yum and the watercress soup bases, both of which were excellent. The Tom yum soup base, in particular, went great with the vegetables, as the vegetables really absorbed the flavour of the soup. There is a vast variety of ingredients available, with even quail eggs and an assortment of intestines (I highly recommend the handmade beef balls). The beef at this hot pot joint also has great quality. It's soft and extremely delicious.

On my second visit I was starving and decided to try an appetizer along with my entree. Beliz mentioned the Melanzana and admittedly I told her I was very skeptical of the combo of pesto and Alfredo served on the eggplant and topped with tomato sauce, so she let me try a bit of it and it was scrumptious.

Not standard fare for this place, as far as I can tell.I made a reservation earlier in the day through OpenTable, sadly, the only time available was 5pm. Not super early for Thanksgiving dinner I suppose (and I admittedly made the reservation at the last minute), but we were hoping for something later.When we arrived, the place was perhaps a third full, mostly with elderly folks and families. By the time we left (about an hour later--more on this ahead!) the place was perhaps even emptier. Not quite sure why we couldn't make a later reservation. The food was pretty good, nothing to write home about, and the wine was reasonable (if a little overpriced). The dessert table was terribly stocked--the pumpkin pie and pumpkin cheesecake each had a piece left, and had basically been ravaged--presentation is clearly not a priority at this place. Furthermore, none of the cakes or pies were chilled, making them a warm mess when you cut into them. From the two desserts I tasted, I gather that desserts here aren't homemade. I've had better cheesecake from Costco/Sam's Club. Oh, and the decor? I don't know what everyone's raving about. It's a giant hotel dining room. Generic. The real reason this place gets one star, though, is absolutely due to the service. Items on the buffet were not labeled particularly well, and the servers assigned to the buffet were not particularly helpful or even friendly...they hung back and avoided making eye-contact when I asked a question about the unlabeled dishes. We were not offered additional wine when we'd finished ours, and when we had retrieved dessert, we were not asked if we'd like coffee or tea. The servers tended to cluster together and chat in the middle of the dining room. Just strange. (I'm a former server, don't think I have no heart for the service industry.)So here's the kicker--about two bites into dessert, 50 minutes after we'd been sat, our server came over to tell us that we had 10 minutes left to finish up. If it had been busy, or had been steadily filling up when we were leaving, I might have understood--but that just wasn't the case.After this piece of information had been delivered, we had to wait to get our check. It seems bizarre to be hustled out, but not be given the opportunity to leave quickly. (At this point, I just wanted to get the hell out of there.)So the check finally arrived, and we discovered that an auto-gratuity had been added to the check for a two-person table. If there hadn't been an auto-gratuity (and we hadn't been rushed out of there), they would have gotten a higher tip. (But given the rushing, they would have gotten a much lower tip. Perhaps the reason for the auto-gratuity.)So, to sum up, we ended up with a grand total check for $120 for two people, and exactly one hour of dining. Not a great experience. I don't plan to go back and give them a second chance."},{"name":"The Cheesecake Factory","address":"4400 Ashford-Dunwoody Rd, Ste 3005","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"The food was just okay.

You can taste them while waiting in line so that you can decide on flavors. They have many creative options and I love that they collaborate with nearby chefs and restaurants to develop new flavors.  I tried the Sea Salt Ice Cream with Caramel Ribbon which is my favorite.  I also tried the Arbequina Olive Oil which had a subtle flavor of olive oil.

I have to say, I'm a fan of this place. The atmosphere is lovely--the restaurant is nicely appointed in dark woods, candlelit tables, crisp white table settings and colorful sculptures of fish throughout. Piano music was nice, not too loud. The staff are nicely dressed and polite, and we were seated promptly for our reservation. I even got a dark-colored napkin, because I was wearing dark pants, and the server pointed out that they do this to avoid the 'napkin lint' on dark clothing. Who would have thought? Our server, Melissa, was fantastic--personable, friendly, funny, and worked her way through the menu and house specialties like a pro. Trulucks has a tremendous wine selection, and while they don't serve beer on tap (my husband was a little disappointed), they do have a decent bottled beer selection. Truluck's menu has a lot of variety, but their obvious love is seafood, crab in particular. My husband ordered the 'all you can eat' Jonah Crab Claws, which are served chilled and includes a soup, salad and all the sides you want for $45. The crab itself is beautiful and was delicious, but it was a lot more work than he was expecting, given that the claws are supposed to be pre-scored for easy access, so he didn't eat as much as he normally would have. His Lobster Bisque was terrific, very smooth and rich, as was my Crab and Corn Chowder. He also ordered the Hothouse Tomato Salad, which we both loved and I would highly recommend as a change of pace for those tired of salad greens. I had the Grilled Wahoo, and while the fish itself was beautifully grilled, the corn and roasted tomato succotash that it was served with was CRAZY spicy thanks to little well-hidden rings of hot chili peppers. I don't mind a little spicy, but I only got through a few bites before I had to leave it and just eat the fish. We had sides of parmesan mashed potatoes and crab fried rice, both of which were delicious, particularly the rice. Yummy and a must-try. Since it was my birthday, Melissa brought out a small plate with a flour less chocolate tart with raspberry sauce, strawberries and blueberries and a single candle. Very nicely done, and a very nice touch. She also brought out a boxed chocolate truffle to take home. We ordered a Mocha Mud pie for dessert, which along with a cup of their strong, fresh-brewed French Press coffee was delicious. Overall I would recommend Trulucks for a special occasion--we had very good service and our meals, on the whole, were both delicious and beautiful. The tab for the two of us--meals, two drinks each, dessert and coffee--came to about $160.00, so it's not a cheap date, but it is a nice one."},{"name":"Chipotle Mexican Grill","address":"2230 Guadalupe St, Ste 32","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"The chipotle here is actually pretty mediocre compared the the chipotles i have gone to.

That speaks nothing but good news to me, and what good news it was for me.When given the menu, it is fairly simple and far as the selection, but more than likely, you might have some questions with the items on the menu. There were a lot of things that caught my eye on the menu, but I ended up ordering the Moroccan chicken hash, the chocolate potato donut, and my mom ordered the roast beef sandwich (which was their special that they had that day). The waitress told me things are served in portions where it was meant to share and that items would come out one at a time as they become ready, and that they did. Coming from Vegas, the portion sizes that they had here were more like single serving kind of food, but I would recommend sharing just to try different foods and have different flavors in your mouth. The Moroccan chicken hash was very flavorful. It didn't specify on the menu, but it comes with olives, onions. cauliflower, chicken, and egg, potatoes, and a sauce I'm unfamiliar with. It was quite tasty and it did blend well together. The chocolate potato donut was powered with some sugar granules and comes with some a light condensed milk kind of sauce. The outside was a little crispy and the inside was soft. The roast beef sandwich was probably my favorite. The bun was soft and slightly crispy, the roast beef looked like it came from a real roast with the way the pieces were given, and it came with a creamy horseradish sauce and fried onions. Everything was delicious and worth getting! The service was amazing and our waitress was incredibly helpful. My mom's coffee never hit the bottom of her cup, the other waitresses helped and cleared our table with empty dishes, and with the water, you have your own full bottle on your table to drink as much as you want.

The best thing about our experience here was how FRESH everything tasted--the ingredients are quality.  We tried the bacon cheeseburger and the cheddar IPA.  The bacon cheeseburger one was good, and the IPA probably would be better for someone who REALLY, REALLY liked beer--the flavor was a bit overpowering for both me and my husband, personally.  We'll definitely be back to try other kinds because of how fresh everything tasted.

Their entrees are fine, but the earth bowl is the way to go.  The tuna spring roll appetizer is perfect.I've been here four times.  On the fourth time, I did not sit, and I don't think I will be back.  My friend and I arrived at about 4:45PM on a particularly cold and windy Sunday.  We had went by Starbucks to grab some coffee to help warm us up, and done a little shopping.  I had finished with my coffee, and she was almost done, but we both still had our cups. The conversation went like this: \\nMe: \\"Hi, can we get a table for two, for dinner, please?\\"\\nHer (Hostess): \\"No, Dinner doesn't start until 5:00.\\"\\nMe, after looking at watch: \\"That's OK, we'll just have a glass of wine or two at the bar while we wait.\\"\\nHer: \\"No, not with those cups.\\"\\nOK, I get it.  No outside food (even at the bar?) - I knew going in that they might not like it.  I would have completely accepted it, had we been given even just a hint of a smile.  The woman seemed to be upset that we were there; she barely looked at us, and grimaced throughout the 60-second interaction.Next time, might I suggest something like:  \\"I\\"m sorry, we have a no-outside-food policy and I can't seat you with those drinks.  If you're done, may I take them for you?\\"I would love to go back here, but management really needs to train their employees to be more polite and work on their demeanor.  Smile at customers; it's not going to kill you.  Make eye contact.  Otherwise, you come off as rude.  And while the food is great, the theme of the negative yelp reviews for this place all have the same thing in common: the staff can be rude.

I think Toro Bravo is still one of the best restaurants in town and have never had a bad meal their (or even a bad dish, now that I think about it).The host quoted us a 20 min wait.  The place was banging, even though it was 1pm on a Thursday.  The wait was more like five minutes and we were led to table, with me squeezing into the booth side.  Either the booth is a little too low or the table is a little too high, but I felt like a little kid and I am by no means short.  Whatever, I'd eat standing on one leg if the food was good enough.For drinks we had the Vampiro, a bloody made with tequila and all sorts of juices and flavors (spectacular) and a Tasty Jerk, their basic bloody with jerky and a few different pickles as the garnish.  For the price ($9) I was expecting a pint glass serving not a slender glass.  It tasted fine, the pickles were great, the jerky too salty.The premise is pretty much the same as Toro Bravo.  Small to medium size plates served family style.  There is a definite emphasis on eggs, which I love, but it made it hard to decide.  We really didn't need or want eggs as the focal point of every dish.  We ordered up two of the chocolate potato doughnuts, a small order of French toast, the Shakshuka with merguez and a baked apple.The French toast came out first.  I took one bite and made a face.  Totally burned around the edges.  It comes with so much berry compote on top I couldn't see before I bit in.  SSBB had eaten from the center, and as is his wont, made quick work of it.  He didn't mind the burned flavor as much as I did so we didn't send it back.The apple came out next. I'm guessing it wasn't a whole apple like I was expecting, it was hard to tell beneath its shroud of cheddar and chunks of bacon.  It was good, if not very substantial.Next out were the doughnuts.  Not too sweet, which I appreciate, but also only very faintly chocolatey.  Maybe I gobbled into mine too fast but it was still pretty raw in the center.  Note: They're not really doughnuts, but doughnut holes which I'm sure are infinitely easier for them to shape.  They're a bit bigger than a golf ball so you make the call if you want to drop $1.50 on one.  The real winner of the meal was the shakshuka.  A very simple, but well balanced stew with plenty of bread to mop things up.  Once you break the yolks they enrich the sauce - I'll definitely be making this one at home.Service was totally professional and friendly with zero attitude.  And much thanks to whomever turned in my phone!  It sucked to have to trek back to NoPo during rush hour but not as much as losing it completely.  Oh, and when I called to see if they had it, there is no option to speak to a live person.  You leave a message if you want a reservation.  I just crossed my fingers and hoped it was there.For $50, including tip, I don't think Tasty is going to be a regular destination for brunch.

The empanada was very familiar in the taste, that it tasted just like I'm accustomed to from up north. They do offer two variations of the empanada, one with cheese and the other without cheese.

As far as taste, the hot seasoning on the sandwich was indeed hot and fantastic, but the chicken was very dry. It was still a very good sandwich in my opinion and worth the $6. The Mac n' Cheese looked like craft Mac n' Cheese but the flavor was thankfully much better.Overall, I had high expectations with it being a Linton Hopkins restaurant and it really didn't live up to those expectations.

I had some sort of tasty pink martini thing, and the boy had a really strong Negroni (after his glass of wine with dinner, he may have been a little tipsy), and then it was time to be seated at our half-moon shaped booth (which I personally loved, it's very romantic to be able to sit close to your sweetie like that).The tasting menu had a myriad of options to choose from for each course, all from the normal menu, which was impressive considering it was a special deal. We gave our orders to the waitress and were immediately served a basket of complementary starter bread which was fresh and warm, a baguette-type you rip apart with your hands.

Service was fine, no complaints there.For the first course, I had the mussels marinere, which were very tasty and a nice sized portion for an app. You really can't go wrong with mussels steamed with wine and butter and herbs, this was a classic executed well and the broth was great to dip my bread into. One down side was that one of my mussels wasn't opened all the way, a potential danger that I fortunately avoided, being in the know... but this does makes me nervous for those that aren't familiar with the rules of seafood safety. The boy enjoyed his app of onion soup.I chose the salmon with sorrel beurre blanc as my main, and this was my favorite part of the meal. The (good-sized) salmon was on the raw side, a major plus for me and hard to find nowadays, and it was so tender and full of flavor (especially with the buerre blanc), I adored this piece of fish. It was served with flavorful green beans atop a side of mashed potatoes covered in sauteed shredded carrots and onions, all delicious things that worked really well together. It was at the end of this that I really started to get full (these are definitely not your average 'tasting' portions!). The boy got the coq au vin which was very flavorful as well and was served with some lovely egg noodles.For dessert I got the giant profiterole, which was huge and impressive, but wasn't anything special (don't get me wrong, pastry + ice cream + chocolate = always good in my book, there just wasn't anything about this that stood out necessarily... not that that would ever stop me from ordering it again, of course). The boy got the chocolate mousse, which was about a third the size of the profiterole but had more flavor and was more memorable. After this course, we were most definitely full and could barely waddle out of the restaurant.I was impressed with a lot of things here: the meal deal (thanks RueLaLa!), the portion size, the quality and flavors of the food, and the atmosphere. Normal menu prices look reasonable too (entrees $16-22), so I can definitely say I'd love to come back and try more dishes (I hear the roasted chicken is to die for!).

The setting is classy with a cozy feel and they had a great varied selection of music (we really enjoyed the 90's hip hop mix toward the end of our evening!)  Every dish was well put together with a many different flavors and textures.  The portions were quite adequate for this type of dining experience.  The wine pairings went well with each dish.  The wait staff were pleasant, friendly and seemed to be enjoying themselves throughout the evening.  I was impressed to see that Naomi Pomeroy still makes time to be there to prepare the meals herself with all that she has going on recently.  We definitely plan to go again someday.  Although this is overall an expensive meal (especially if you get wine pairings), it is a good value for what you get.  Be sure to call well in advance (3-4 weeks) for a reservation if you want to dine on a Friday/Saturday, especially if you want the 6:00p seating.  I would not recommend this place for people who are picky about fat in/on your meat or organ meat as they do incorporate many different parts of the animals and some of the most delicious cuts, such as pork belly have quite a bit of fat."},{"name":"Highland Kitchen","address":"150 Highland Ave","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"This place gets a %100 across the board atmosphere, food, and especially service \\nMe and the fam here from ny visiting her sis \\nAnd had a awesome time thanks Guys"},{"name":"Easy Tiger","address":"709 E 6th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I love the bread and vegetarian sausages at Easy Tiger!

Parking is easiest from the lot to the right in front of Dillards department store and walking across, unless you want to pay the valet but you'll still end up walking a bit so I'd advise you to forego that inconvenience.I have a feeling that most of you have had the experience of the Cheesecake Factory - the first built (and now closed and replaced by a different location) in Buckhead at one time was the highest-grossing restaurant in the US. I believe this location was the second or third built in Atlanta and it's a really fantastic location. The interior has a fantasy array of Byzantine columns, wonderful fantasy-like wall sconces and very feminine fresco-like murals on a warm tan stucco adorning the ceilings - quite nice and it will make you feel a bit like you've entered a Disney theme park restaurant, however much like said-park the experience hardly meets the promise. I've worked in this area of Dunwoody for 15 or so years off-and-on so I've had many occasion to eat at this Cheesecake Factory. It's not a bad place to meet for special occasions as they can accommodate large parties - for my most recent visit I met with many coworkers for a bittersweet occasion - a member of our team was leaving for another work opportunity.When you are seated you'll be presented with a booklet of many, many items and now I'll voice my biggest gripe. The menu is much too large - I mean it's so big that there's advertising on some of the pages - is it a menu, or a catalog? I really don't see how any restaurant can offer so many dishes and hope to do all of them well. The last thing I want to see is a binder full of pages - where do you start? What's good? What's not? Too many choices. The food here, and I've tried dozens of items, is passable - no real standouts from the many appetizer or entree sections. I honestly can't recommend any one item as something that's your missing or something you can't get elsewhere and I think this is where the restaurant's identity takes a hit. You're sitting in this fantastic setting yet with one exception, the food is pretty humdrum. We'll get to that exception shortly. I do like the basket of bread that they bring out - something about that wheat bread I really like. But then again, don't come here for the bread. When I think about the food here it reminds me a bit of TGI Fridays. Not that they are all that similar, but the food is very formulaic which is both a good and bad thing. It's good in that there's usually some semblance of food balance - starch to fat to acid ratios are good. It's bad in that the combinations are a bit tired - not much magic here. For mall food it's good and certainly better than the food court - of course you're paying more for it as well. Back to the Fridays comparison - I think the food here is better than Friday's as it's less snacky and more of a meal. Satisfying but not awesome.The exception of course are the desserts. I am not a big fan of cheesecake - it tends to sit very heavy with me, but I'll concede that the cheesecakes here are exceptional. I also like the Sunday and the ice cream in general. And maybe that's the point - I mean it is called \\"The Cheesecake Factory\\" so perhaps everything leading up to the dessert is just the build up to the big finish? But if so, why the phone-book menu?My final point is about the service. I find it very hit-or-miss. I've received both exceptional service and horrible service and it doesn't seem to matter what size the party is - sometimes the service is amazing on a group of 20 and terrible on just two. No rhyme or reason for it. I've had so many orders get screwed up here and it's really unclear if it was the server or the kitchen. I've had tables where everything showed up together except one lost plate and it took 20 minutes for it to appear with everyone either finished or sitting in front of cold plates, to wrong items showing up, to meals with food restrictive (bacon) items showing up with extra (bacon), etc. When service is good the server is usually very attentive and fixes any mistakes quickly. When service is bad you can't find the server and the attitude is really crappy. Like I said, hit-or-miss.So what's my final overall opinion? I think The Cheesecake Factory is exceptional for their desserts. The appetizer and entrees are mediocre but palatable and certainly better than mall food. The service hit-or-miss. Would I eat there again? Sure as it's close and useful for certain situations. Do I find myself wanting to go here? No. On a scale of 1-5, it's a fairly solid 3 due to the desserts.(also published to my food blog)"},{"name":"Little New Orleans Kitchen & Oyster Bar","address":"5840 W Irlo Bronson Memorial Hwy","city":"Kissimmee","stars":"3.5","text":"I recently visited their new location near old town.

I've been there a few times now and every time I find new things to love about it. The first visit started with some of the satay, the steamed pork buns, and kobe beef skewers. The first visit was on a typical fall evening in Portland- rainy and cold. What I crave on evenings like that is a great brothy soup. So I had the spicy mama ramen. The bowl was full of delicious noodles, 'bouncy pork', shrimp, and a whole lot of goodness. They serve a series of condiments on the side like pickled serrano peppers, but you won't need a lot of them, there is already some good spice in this dish. While properly slurping my noodles I saw this mound of pork arrive in the kitchen window and loudly asked what that was- the answer: deep fried pork shank. So of course, on my second trip I had to try it. A word of warning, this thing is big and rich so you might want to share. It was sooooooo good. The crispy skin gave way to a wonderfully cooked pork shank. The flavor was great and I kept licking the pork juice off of my fingers. Splash a little of sour chili dipping sauce on the meat and you might just be in heaven. Don't go to Ping looking for Pok Pok food, you won't find it.

Well I didn't like it, I loved it so she brought out two free mini shakes for us. This place is 5 stars ... Extremely friendly, fun, and delicious.

But what's best about Melton's is the people - the servers and lots of neighborhood regulars give such a nice, friendly vibe. The food is solid (love the reuben, tuna melt and grilled chicken salad), but other than cheese puffs and Irish nachos, not extraordinary, so I can't give 5 stars - but then it's also less expensive than the places on the Square.  They also have several entrees that have the option of ordering a smaller portion, which our family appreciates. If you want chef's specialties, this isn't the place, but I've never been disappointed.There's a patio for when the weather's nice.Not fancy, but it's nice enough.  It's never rowdy - people bring their children there, and I like the oldies on their playlist.In all, it's our comfort place. and our food is always served fresh and hot. I don't get what others are saying about poor service; ours has always been great. They get a lot of large parties there, so sometimes our assigned server (they go on rotation, not in sections) may be held up tending to a large party, but once the server checks our table for drinks, service almost always goes smoothly from there on.

Card swipes not working, ticket machines jamming up coins, games missing cars, skee ball machines only having 3 balls, basketballs peeling, do I need to say more?Secondly,  the place smells! I don't know if it was because of a lot of people, but the place was straight up foul. Actually, it wasn't the people it's the establishment because we had dinner there, the \\"eat and play\\" combo and it was smelling even over there!Third, our waitress was worst than a used car salesman. My girlfriend and I were meeting up with another couple and within 15 minutes, she came back to ask us if we wanted an appetizer 3 times! Once our other couple arrived, she suggested the upgrade to the eat and play 4 times! To make matters worse, one of us wanted fries instead of a salad and she forgot. Wow, a fourth? Fourthly, I ordered the D&B burger, it's a burger simple right? WRONG. That thing was dry, no flavor, and no mayo or mustard was even offered. How can you mess up a burger? No salt in the kitchen? The menu's were sticky, heck they were even wet! It's like someone went over them with a dirty rag or soaked them in a bucket of sugar water.wait, a fifth? Fifthly, we went and played pool. Okay, $12/hr versus $14/hr at D&B in Sugarloaf. Okay, 4 folks, we're in our 20's...no one comes over to offer us any drinks? I mean, seriously? I don't care if we did eat and played games, we MIGHT be thirsty, you know? Actually, we were, we had to flag down a guy who finally got us our drinks and NEVER checked on us.Overall, this is a terrible D&B to go to.

Then to find out they were out of regular tea I ordered. How do you ran out of iced tea? When came to the order... the waiter started off by saying, \\"we're out of a few things\\" and then began to list of numerous entr√©es, meats, sides and other ingredients they were out of.  This list was longer than that what was available. So after re-deciding what we \\"could\\" order we placed it. We order simply a kids burger, kids chicken tenders and a club sandwich. \\nAnother 20mins pass and the waiter returns to say that they could not make the club sandwich i ordered, what ? ridiculous! Still trying to understand why it took so long to find out? The restaurant was not busy.  As I observe the crowd I could see other tables frustrated with the service, two around us had asked where their food was. That should've been a sign to leave then. The table next to us was complaining about their childs plate they had ordered. Grilled chicken with Mac and cheese. The plate came with 2 very small grilled chicken tender. Maybe you could call it one chicken tender. The menu states kids meals come with  3 tenders. The waiter didn't seem concerned at all and reluctantly said he would order another one from the kitchen. Over priced across the board. our kids burger cost $7!  Oh and if you want cheese that will be another $1. So that's $8 for a simple kids cheese burger. Crazy!! After waiting over 30 minutes we simply walked out. I never do that but I was so Frustrated with the experience. I've only been to this place one other time when I first opened and the same thing happened. Shame on me for assuming something would be different.

On the Monday we leave, we end up stopping for a bite to eat at a restaurant on the way. This year we ended up going to the \\"Border Cafe\\". I've been here numerous times in the past, although it has been a year since I ate here. Realistically, I would give this place a 3.5 stars but Yelp does not have that as an option. The Border Cafe is an enjoyable Tex-Mex restaurant with a great atmosphere. The place is always so lively and may be loud. Maybe a little too loud, but it's alright. For an appetizer my family got the queso dip. It was a little watery today but it's kind of a hit and miss when it comes to ordering although it still packs the same punch. Just a little more messy. I ordered a kids chicken quesadilla because I'm a little boy. The quesadilla was alright, nothing special but was still filling. The service wasn't the worst. It took awhile to get the drinks but it didn't take long for the meals to be delivered to our table. The waitress was nice, we had a nice conversation at the end about the Cape and the area we're from. Normal small talk stuff.The Border Cafe still gets the long lines and the loud environment even though this place has been here for years. I give the Border a solid 3.5-4 stars.

The inside decor, while playful, looked like it belonged more on I-Drive than in Baldwin Park. The menu reminded me more of a mass chain than the lakeside steakhouse experience I expected. Maybe my expectations were too high, but the menu seemed simple, boring, and uninspired. Manny's just opened, so I think a few kinks in service and the timing of the food coming out was to be expected, but I'll be hard pressed to go back based on the menu and atmosphere.

We were mostly lured in by the promise of good cocktails, since we've been on a bit of a mixology kick.  The drinks off of their cocktail menu were indeed delicious.  My husband asked for a few cocktails that were not in the menu but any good bartender should know, and we had moderate success - unfortunately they didn't carry all of the liquors needed for a couple of them.  The food was also great, I had the goat cheese and pear salad to start - which wasn't the best I've ever had, but it was a hearty serving with nice presentation.  My husband had the beef duo, and he claimed that it was some of the best tartar he's ever had.  For main dishes we ordered the Pork Roulade and the Cod - and we were disappointed to learn that they were  unable to make the roulade that night, so we opted for the Beef Short Ribs instead. Both were amazingly tasty and fresh and we cleaned our plates.  For dessert we had the Nutella Creme Brulee, which was heavenly.  It was light and creamy and in my opinion, a large portion.  We spent $143 bucks on dinner and had 5 cocktails, 2 appetizers, 2 main courses, and dessert.  I think that's about right for a decent meal in Boston. We finished dinner just in time for the jazz band to get started, and the lounge was cozy and chic.  The band itself was really quite good and I found myself wishing for a dance floor to groove out to the deep voice of the singer.

Burgers are super juicy and don't have that burnt char-grilled taste (which I personally dislike). They taste like delicious burgers you make from scratch if you're grilling at home. I agree with another reviewer that the patties could use a tad more salt for seasoning. But you can always add salt yourself and their delicious special sauce (available in bottles on all the tables) adds plenty of flavor. Their fries are the fatter kind instead of the thin crispy ones at most burger joints. I don't love them, but I am not a fan of fries anyway but my husband prefers the fries at Five Guys (although he also likes the burgers at Lee's better).Service is very friendly.

The banchan (sidedishes) were merely some kimchi and...broccoli? Bad vibes there. Also they give you those Chinese scoop-type spoons, which are totally uncomfortable and abnormal to use with Korean food. When we asked the waiter for regular spoons she was so confused.We ordered black bean noodles (jjajangmyun). The waitress looked shocked when we said \\"jjajangmyun\\", as if she didn't expect us to know what the Korean food actually is--this should have been a warning to us. Lo and behold, do you know what they served? Literally the instant noodle version (chapaghettii), the kind that a child could cook up at home in 5 minutes. When it came out we had a moment of disbelief just staring at it, thinking \\"did they actually just serve us instant noodles?\\" But oh well.The soft tofu soup (soon dubu) was also absolutely depressing. I don't know if I can even call it soon dubu, it was literally just some watery kimchi soup with a bunch of tofu thrown in there.Bibimbap was okay, but it was ridiculous that adding meat was an extra $3 (normal bibimbap almost always comes with meat). The gochujang (red chili paste) that they served it with was weird tasting as well, and not the normal Korean kind. Overall the whole thing tasted a little off.In conclusion, it seems like the kitchen just looked at pictures of Korean food and found the simplest, cheapest methods of copying their appearance. The restaurant is clearly hoping that their customers don't really know Korean food. Don't waste your money here, you're better off going to the food court in the mall right next to this restaurant."},{"name":"Wendy's","address":"3596 Far West Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"2.5","text":"This is a review for the fact that there is a really messed up sign when you leave the drive-thru that says,\\"See you tomorrow.\\"Who do these pretentious bastards think they are, the audacity...."},{"name":"Olive Branch","address":"115 W 3rd Ave","city":"Mount Dora","stars":"4","text":"Four of us had a great time at Olive Branch, again...Food, Drinks, Service, Ambiance all great.

As good as their food is, their service surpasses that! Can you believe that?!So my two friends and I arrived for dinner around 730ish around 5-6 months ago. We were told that we'd have a table by 8:15 pm. So off to the cold we waited, as was expected. We stood around until about 815 pm, hostess comes update us about the wait apologizing that it's taking longer than expected - offers us free drinks at the bar to help with the wait. We declined and just went inside to wait since it was getting cold. At 845 pm, hostess again apologizes for the wait and says that they would be more than happy to see if their sister restaurant (B&G oysters I think) across the street has a table ready for us if we wanted to switch venue. We said whichever was available first since we were starving by this time. They said they'd get a table ready for us across the street within 10 minutes. By 840 pm, still not seated.. so we were a little confused. However, we did have someone come by every so often apologizing for the longer than expected wait. By 9:20 pm, we finally get a table! WOOHOO! (I typically hate waiting, but with the staff constantly coming to apologize.. I really couldn't be upset with them. It's simply not their fault.)So around 9:20 pm, we get ready to order our food. Within 5-10 minutes, the staff is bringing out complimentary appetizers for our long wait. We thought that was very thoughtful already; but they also poured us some free champagne for our troubles as well! After our meal was done (a delightful meal it was, food to be reviewed below), we get ready to pay. The manager comes out and tells us the meal was on them for the long wait we experienced! My friends and I have never experienced such a pleasant surprise from any restaurants before. It goes to show that this restaurant really cares about their customers. =)Now the food, we had the steak tartare and that was absolutely devine! First time I had it, and I could not stop eating it! It went perfectly with the crostini provided with the dish. The duck liver mousse and p√¢te de campagne were also very addictive. All the appetizers (along with the ones sent by the chef) were so delicious I could not stop eating. I was starting to get full and my entree hasn't even arrived yet!!For the entree, I ordered the duck with the cabbage. First time I've had duck that looked like it was rare/medium rare, yet tasted like perfection.  My friend had raving reviews about his steak and my other friend said the hot dog was okay, she was expecting more. Overall, the food was delicious. The staff went above and beyond to make sure we were taken care of. I'd definitely come back, especially for the service alone! =)"},{"name":"SanSai Japanese Grill","address":"539 NW 21st Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Sushi was tasty and reasonably priced.

The sauerkraut & potato salad were really good, though I usually am not a fan. The sausage had hardly any flavor, sadly. I had already ordered a hatch chili chicken sausage on pretzel bun before the board came out, but that sausage was actually quite flavorful. My sis got the pork with fig onion jam, which was really good. My friend got the turkey sandwich & said it was the best sandwich of her life! Ended with some lattes & pastries.

Once, when I fell out of a pear tree and broke my leg, instead of rushing me to the hospital, she ripped off a branch from the very tree, whooped my ass with it for climbing it in the first place, and then took me to the buffet. (As if \\"all you can eat\\" mashed potatoes and ice cream would magically heal my welted ass.) When my favorite uncle died, there was food for days at the funeral, she sent everyone home with to go plates and everyone was automatically too full to cry!Sadly, her idea of a pig out session was closer to sub par, mediocre garbage.  My days of being forced to dine at the buffet in an effort to erase a tragedy are over, but when I need a good old fashioned pig out session, I look to Tasty N Sons.Everything on their menu is good, that goes without saying.  The fact that you can order a little of everything to share, with the satisfaction of knowing that some lard ass who just got done picking his ass, didn't just touch the same ladle as you, is worth every single dollar!The sweet biscuits with fresh cream and berries are on my top 10 list of favorites.  The patatas bravas with delicious aioli draped in sunny side up eggs, add tons of flavor to any dish. Baked apples with queso and bacon? Bacon wrapped dates! Oh hello!

The enchiladas are perfect: the chicken is never dry and there's just enough tomatillo sauce without it ever seeming as though they're drowning in it.

Knowing that, I didn't drink the water.If you come here, I recommend the fried rice and pan fried noodles."},{"name":"Toast","address":"5222 SE 52nd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Grass-fed meat, organic produce, friendly service, outdoor sitting available for dog owners, and most importantly amazing delectable meals!!"},{"name":"Highland Kitchen","address":"150 Highland Ave","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"Holy shit.

The gnocchi came in a slightly over salted but over all really pleasant sauce. It was tender and light and a little charred and pretty much heaven. A great appetizer. The chicken had a truly impressive presentation. It was served over a bed of peppery, spicy broccoli rabe and fucking so so so good garlic mashed potatoes. There was also a lake of perfectly herby, perfectly chickeny gravy. My boyfriend had the braised pork and loved it. It was sweet and spicy. The absolute highlight of the night was dessert. Banana bread pudding was warm and banana-y and cinnamon-y and sweet and jesus christ it made me want to die. Chocolate pudding was thick and mousse-like with toasted hazelnut bits and a bittersweet finish.I love you, Highland Kitchen."},{"name":"4 Rivers Smokehouse","address":"11764 University Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Decided to come eat at 4 rivers before family went back to PA. Being that it is one of our favorites we wanted them to go out with a bang. Went on a Tuesday around 630 PM. We were able to beat the dinner rush and get right in line. Ordered the Texas destroyer ( my favorite) with sweet potato and fries. Gf ordered the pulled chicken dinner with baked beans, fries, and Mac and cheese. She later regretted it and stated that the dinner plate brings too much food for 1 person. Probably could have split the meal. Everything tasted perfect. The brisket on my sandwich was  smoked to perfection and added a little bit of their BBQ sauce. All the flavors blend together to form the perfect BBQ sand which. Gf loved the pulled chicken and all her sides . The restaurant was clean as usual. Plenty of seats and plenty of employees working the counter. Very efficient. The rush of people started to come around 715 PM. They now offer tacos for taco Tuesday which looked delicious. They also have a sweet shop which offers delicious desserts. We did not try them this time but will try next time. Always recommend this place if you are looking for a. Ice quick and delicious dinner at an affordable price.

Every time I come,  the owner/manager is very rude. Rude to the point that I THOUGHT he was racist. I figured I shouldn't just pull the race card because he had NOTHING but Hispanics as his associates/staff. The very first time I came I was on my lunch break and I was having some phone issues with Sprint so I used my lunch break to handle that call being that it takes a while. Everyone uses their lunch break to eat and also handle business calls that have to be done during business hours.  Anyways, when I ordered & was ready to checkout at the register I had a coupon for a FREE Queso for signing up for their text messaging program for marketing etc. It was emailed to me. There was a barcode on the emailed coupon and they have a scanner there so I pulled up my email. The owner/manager said \\"I won't allow my associates to serve you because you are on your cell phone.\\" I informed him it was a business call as I was on hold but I will put the phone down. Then he said, \\"You can't use this coupon because you need to print it out.\\" I asked him if it's possible he can just scan the barcode with the scanner. He says, \\"That's not how I run my restaurant nor my coupons you need to print it and you didn't hang up your phone you just put it down so we will not be serving you today.\\" I felt some type of way at this point but I just told him,  \\"OK I will get it printed and just come back when my call is over\\". I went next door and printed and came back;  I was no longer on my call. (Mind you at this point my 1 hour lunch has gone down to 30 minutes and I haven't even gotten my food yet) He said I had to get back in line.  No problem. I got back in line.  Now I wait... They give me the same dang queso I ordered before I left and came back and not only did he ask for my DL.... BUUUUTTTT NOOOOWWW he STILL SAYS \\"I cant use this coupon because your name on the coupon is spelled D-e-b-r-a-h and your DL shows D-E-B-\\"O\\"-R-A-H\\". ARE YOU F'N KIDDING ME!  I WANTED TO GET REAL SNAPPY AND CURSE HIM OUT I PROMISE YOU. (Why it was spelled wrong IDK maybe I entered it wrong) But either way,  I remembered that these kind of people want to see you prove them right. They want you to act like a fool in public and act uncivilized.  So against everything in me, I politely showed him my business card that shows not only my name but my email address. The same email address that's on my coupon. Looking straight in his face/eyes with the most polite/professional voice, tone, and verbiage I asked,  \\"This is me, my email, and my phone number that I receive your texts and emails, why will you not be able to serve it to me again?\\"  He responds, \\"Ma'am I don't have to serve you!\\" At this point I don't even want the food but it was the point that was important. So I just look at him with this confused face for like 15 seconds.  He says,  \\"Ma'am,  I'll do it this one time but next time don't come in here with your phone to your ear disrespecting my workers time!\\". WTF!!!  It took me a while before I came back but I really like Moe's and it's so close to my job.  So every time since then that I have come back he has continuously been rude. Just plain out rude. Nasty attitude. And get this.... I NEVER HAVE MY PHONE TO MY EAR ANYMORE but he is STILL RUDE. I have come to the realization (along with the 2016 election year)  that people we're not raised with the love of God nor do they care. I had so many thoughts and curse words for this owner/manager but I'm sure y'all get the picture and I didn't curse him like I truly wanted to. So sad.  But guess what? Maybe he's not happy with his life. And that is why; he has no respect for people so he probably doesn't get it shown back to him in return. The times I have returned I have just been so happy go lucky smiling and laughing and grinning that he can't stand it!   #KillThemWithKindness"},{"name":"Zaviya Grill","address":"1212 W Parmer Ln, Unit A","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"When you walk in you will be confused to what you should do.

Overall, I really enjoyed this restaurant; however, there are a few reasons for just a few stars.1.) Our service was *incredibly* slow. We were seated at 5:30pm and I am pretty sure our main dishes didn't start arriving until 8pm. That said, I was in great company and we did share some small plates and drinks, so it wasn't a deal-breaker. It also took a really long time for some folks at our table to get additional drinks while we waited for our food. 2.) Our main dishes came out as they were ready. I'd read this was the case here on Yelp, so I wasn't surprised (or super annoyed) about this... however, I still felt obliged to wait for the rest of the crew to get their dinners. Thing is, I didn't expect to wait another half and hour or so to start eating. Now, is that my fault or the restaurants? Probably my own... but still, a half hour between when the table starts getting food until everyone's meals are in front of them? That seems a bit much. I wish they'd have waited and brought them at the same time. Or a little closer together.3.) My dish was just kind of meh. I ordered the spaghetti carbonara and I wish I'd have just gotten a burger. My hubby ordered the burger w/jalapenos and it was *really* tasty (I had a bite). To be fair though, it is possible that my dish was meh because I waited so long to eat it. But, after all the hype, I expected more. All of that said, they accidentally made an extra serving of some type of pasta ragout (that we all shared) and it was AMAZING! I tried to find the name of it on their menu and it wasn't listed online. If you go there for dinner and you see something similar on their printed menu, ORDER IT. I'm not kidding. It is so delicious and the very reason I will return. I don't live near Tasty n Sons. And for the reasons above, I might not have come back. BUT, the pasta ragout was so incredible I *have to* go back! Just for my own order of it! :-)Food aside, The atmosphere was really nice. Modern, clean, and a bit industrial. I've been crushing on the dark wood thing that a lot of new restaurants/bars are doing with interior design. While the service was slow, the staff was really nice. And lest we forget, dessert... Dessert was delicious. I only had room for a taste of the chocolate chip cookies (baked to order!) with ice cream, but the cookies were incredible. I mean really, who doesn't love freshly baked homemade cookies?! I'll be back.

The spotted cat is a giant filet of catfish with tons of herbs and a spicy cajun sauce on top. Great taste served on a bed on flavorful veggies. Chicken and waffles had moist/crisp meat with an okay waffle served with a hot sauce and maple syrup. Ribs are tender and drenched in a tangy BBQ sauce - served with a moderately breaded mac n cheese, and rich cornbread. Paired the food with one of draft IPAs ($7).

It was a Monday evening around 7 pm and the restaurant was fairly quiet. I sat at the bar and was promptly given 4 different menus (wine, beer, cocktails and food.) The bartender was friendly and attentive. I started off with the leek and endive salad, it was fantastic. Had all the sweet, salty, and savory notes and foodie like me dreams for. I had a glass of Sancerre to go along with the salad and it was perfect. Next I moved onto the roasted goat shoulder ragout with gnocchi. I was told to order toast to sop up all the lovely jus that comes along with it, so I did. I ordered a glass of red a blend from Quivira winery, a personal favorite. The dish arrived and it looked and smelled divine. The taste however let me down some. It was overly salty which can happen when you slow braise a meat, but this just went a salt lick too far. The gnocchi was tough and lacked flavor except for that salt ingredient again. I didn't need the toast after all it didn't have much jus as I was expecting. Overall my meal was very good, if I am ever back in the Austin area again I will be sure to give it another go and try other items which were recommended like the pork cheeks and the pop rock edamame.PS - every Monday they have a secret burger night, they only make 12 and it is a first come first serve.

One of the cities we went through was Lockhart so I had to grab some moist brisket from Black's. I wanted to try different barbecue joints along the route, but we just did not have enough time to do so. The first thing I wanted once I got back into town was to grab some barbecue. My wife and I ended up at Dickey's Barbecue Pit which was just a few miles away from our house. We are not a big fan of chain restaurants in general, but I often receive coupons for them via email. Dickey's will often send me coupons for free plates or sandwiches.Dickey's uses an industrial gas smoker which I feel like they are cheating when they do this. No one needs to tend to a fire to regulate the heat. Every time we leave the restaurant, we smell so smoky for whatever reason. I ordered the three meat plate with moist brisket, pork ribs, and polish sausage with macaroni and cheese and fries on the side. The brisket was tender and smoky but really greasy. They did not trim the brisket very well before they smoked it, and there was a lot of fat left on it when they were slicing it. The brisket did not have a lot of flavor going on though. The ribs were decent and had a sweet, smoky glaze. They were coming off the bone and a little dry. The polish sausage was a commercial sausage and was just boring. The macaroni and cheese was good, but how can you really mess that up? They were out of their regular waffle fries which I was disappointed to find out. Waffle fries always hit the spot for me. When an employee brought me steak fries, and I was like ah crap.Dickey's is not our favorite, but it is close, fast, and cheap. I have had a pulled pork sandwich before, and it is pretty decent. I would stay away from the chicken because it is just the breast with no bones or skin. They also have free soft serve ice cream. Every time I eat barbecue, I always want ice cream later, so this works out for me.

The quail & fig and duck ham we shared as entrees. The duck was all smoky goodness on top of some notable grits and quail was addicting with the sweetness from the figs. The plates are small as compared to the 2 serving size platters of other restaurants, but entrees are plenty, especially if you start out with something to share. We left stuffed. We never needed that amount of food, just sprung for it for a special occasion.On to tonight. We wanted to try out their late night burgers and found some of the best in town! We had three in our party so decided to try one of each. The others were good- but the butter burger is where it's at! Best burger in town if you're looking for something kicked up a notch. We started with the tartare and while good, I do prefer Ravenous Pigs over this one. We also tried out the pimento cheese which was really good. That burger though. Wow.

Also, when we arrived, while the place was 90% empty, a man took us to a table in the back by a serving station and restrooms. When I asked for a better table, the waitress, knowing it was our anniversary, took us to a great balcony table. Then, the check included an already added tip of 18%. The waitress said it was per Groupon's rules. Not so per my previous experience, and I would have given 20%, despite the other minuses as she was nice.

Their Traecle (sp) cake is divine and bound to give you diabetes on the spot. As for their drinks, start with the French Martini for a nice, crisp, fruitful taste that had me feeling tipsy after a few sips (and I am not lightweight, trust me). My problems with PRC are as follows:\\n-On those busy nights, expect a long wait for your food. So long a wait that you might think they forgot about you. I recommend, if you HAVE to go on those busy nights, going with a friend. You will pass the time quicker.\\n-Service is great, but not 100%.

I ordered the Lobster Club which was DELISH but I had requested a side salad and instead received fries. Other people in our party ordered Casar salads with calamari on top and commented that salads were not filing at all.

The only 3 con's  about this place is that the line can be extremely long, which of course is not the restaurants fault. However, one particular day when the line was long, they ran out of drumsticks and I was forced to substitute that for 4 wings. When I received the wings, however, there were only three, which is unacceptable.\\n Furthermore, when I visited the restaurant days after its opening, I saw a gentleman (employee) \\n without gloves or a hair net handling the chicken.

My charcuterie board was a generous and delicious offering. The Mezzo salad was respectable. My husband enjoyed the arancini and raved about his wedge salad. So why the 3 star rating?  There we sat with better than a half bottle of wine; I was only starting on my salad when the waiter came over NOT to pour more wine into our glasses but to offer to clear and bring us our check!

The summer rolls we ordered were packed with shrimp and pork, super fresh and delicious. I had the a rice vermicelli bowl with spring rolls, pork, and shrimp. Loved that it was overflowing with carrot slices, bean spouts, and lettuce too. It seemed so fresh almost like a salad...but with lots of meat and noodles. Interesting menu concept where for each additional meat/protein you add to a dish it pretty much increases the price by about $1. So for a couple of extra bucks you can have a larger selection of different meats in your entree. The menu had lots of great choices with Ph√≥ and different vegetarian options as well. The service was fast and very attentive.

The burger, freshly made came after a surprising short wait as the place was packed at about quarter till noon. As I was alone (and I dislike eating alone in public) I took the burger to my work truck and delicately unfolded the tinfoil wrapping in a manner similar to a young mans first time disrobing a young lady. What was inside was a delight to all the senses; two patties (!), onions, mushrooms, pickles and I opted for some jalapenos as well. All the fixin's are free, so go crazy. The juicy burger was cooked just right and was more than I could get my food-hole around. Delicious ! It lasted about 5 minutes (similar to aforementioned young lady experience....) My only complaint is the bun, hence the 4 stars. That poor little bun didn't stand a chance, it fell apart pretty quickly.

However, the host then went out of his way to check on the tables and see who was close to finishing. We ended up only waiting about 20 minutes. Our waitress, Meg, was personable and knowledgable about the menu, making some great recommendations for drinks.The food itself was excellent - huge portions of delicious Southern comfort food. The shrimp and grits appetizer had a fantastic mix of textures and the freshness of the scallions(?) on top nicely balanced with the saltiness of the bacon. The lamb stew was surprisingly spicy, but very tasty and filling. The cuban reuben was the perfect marriage of a cuban and a reuben, messy but delightful to eat. The blackened catfish po'boy truly reminded us of New Orleans, with the remoulade adding a needed creamy accompaniment to the blackened catfish. The banana bread pudding is divine - caramelized bananas and bread soaked in bourbon-y syrup with a scoop of ice cream on the side. It was the perfect way to end our excellent meal.The beer and cocktail selection was extensive. The Corpse Reviver #2 was sweet with a sour kick and I could barely even taste the gin, but the drink was actually pretty strong (at least for a lightweight like me).The menu, though a little \\"spendy,\\" is fairly well-priced for the portion size and quality of food - we left full and happy. The only thing is that they don't take reservations, the wait can be pretty long, and there isn't really anything else to do around Highland Kitchen. That being said, I highly recommend stopping by, especially to get that Southern food and hospitality fix."},{"name":"Holy Taco","address":"1314 Glenwood Ave SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Dined at Holy Taco last night for the first time.  It was a quick meal because my friends and I had to get to the Variety to see Datarock and Ladytron, but it was a perfect quick meal place.  (Or I think you could have a really nice leisurely meal if you have the time.)  We ordered the guac and chips.  The chips are a little greasy and they are made from flour tortillas, not corn.  The chips are my only complaint (due to their greasy nature).  The guac was good -- not too onion-y and the avocados were fresh.I also ordered a shrimp taco (camarones).  It was great -- grilled shrimp, guacamole and that crumbly Mexican cheese (kinda like feta but not as sharp tasting -- so good on salads).  Everything was fresh and the shrimp was cooked perfectly.I tasted my friend's gazpacho and it was good -- nice tomato flavor and it had a little smokey taste.  It was also garnished with some chopped cucumbers, which I love.As for drinks, I ordered beer, but I did taste my friend's margarita which tasted fresh.  I love that you can taste a hint of the agave syrup (it's not too sweet and I think it balances out the sour).I will definitely be back and eat more and take my time so I can really get a good feel for the place.  By the way, our server was great (attentive, quick and nice).  The patio rocked too -- fans and shade which make it a bit cooler on hot nights.

First service, second food.I went with my family in February after spending the day in the city. It was a cold Tuesday night and Hanover St was dead. We looked around and decided on this restaurant after looking in and seeing an attractive decor.  There was only 1 couple in he restaurant and they were just ending their dinner.SERVICE: The waitress seemed friendly enough. My son asked if they had Pesto, she said no. He asked if they had Alfredo, she said no. We asked, can the chef make it, remember that the place is empty by now and it takes 5 minutes and 3 or 4 basic ingredients (Cheese, cream/milk, seasoning) to make an Alfredo sauce. He accepted the 'fancy' Bolognese sauce but asked if it could be put over Penne.... she replied with \\"It's Chef's choice\\"  REALLY!!!  Are you kidding me??? There is nobody in the restaurant and she already said no to Alfredo without EVER even going to ask the chef...who by the way was just standing around at the time since there was nobody in the restaurant or on the streets for that matter. I could understand if we asked about special accommodations on a Saturday night with 20 people waiting...and even then,many restaurants would have done it...even on a busy Saturday night... it's pretty easy and takes very little time to whip up a simple Alfredo... FOOD: The four dishes we ordered were fair at best. They lacked richness and flavor. Oh yea.... the Bolognese was mediocre and the extra wide Fettuccine noodle served with it overpowered the Bolognese.Had I been there alone with my wife, we would have left the minute the waitress disregarded everyone of our requests as insignificant and in a \\"I can't be bothered\\" manner.\\n.\\nI contacted the proprietor about the experience and her reply was simply, paraphrasing: Oh sorry, I've been away, thanks for letting me know.  I proceeded to remind her that her food was average at best compared to the hundreds of other restaurants in the North End and she should think about all those that have closed in the past couple of years because hers will be next if the quality of her service and food doesn't improve drastically.We are NOT picky eaters... we just wanted decent quality food for cheap or good/great quality food or reasonable prices. What we got was fair quality food for high prices.

They call your phone when your table is ready (pretty sweet way of doing it honestly) and we head over, the person I was with tried the lobster ravioli which was on the aforementioned show... Plenty of meaty lobstery goodness in every bite. I was going to get them too but decided to try something different, so got seafood cannelloni - this dish now haunts my dreams as I could possibly eat it at every meal every day. Every sea critter imaginable wrapped in delicious fresh doughy pasta with a wonderful red sauce and enough basil to cause a seizure. Absolute heaven. Did I mention the portions? This thing was TWO of these massive cannelloni where one would have been acceptable. I was taught by my mother to finish everything on my plate but there was just no friggin' way I was eating both.

My oma would have these set at the table in front our plates during the holidays and as children, and we thought we were so grown up (as an adult I am happy and thankful to report that the glasses have grown considerably in size)!I'd been walking by The Portland Wine Bar and Winery for some time. A friend and I were in the area with tickets to a movie but wanted a glass of wine prior to. So, I suggested this place.What's better than wine? Nothing you say? Well that's just not true. Dogs (duh). Why am I talking about dogs in the middle of a wine bar review? As it so happens, the greeting party was none other than a sweet furry black lab by the name of Pinot. Mark (of the upright non-furry variety) set a lovely relaxed tone and was extremely knowledgeable, furthering my education in pinot. (I'm a recent convert.)Before long, we were sipping on a 2008, taking turns showering Pinot with affection and talking about NASA (yes...the geek in me was nearly going supernova with the convergence of three of my favorite things).

It's also almost too hard not to order a taste of each of them (cast all sexual innuendos aside, please).  The Butcher Shop, with its sleek, black slate bar and blood red walls, is comforting, yet classy.  The space itself is quite small, but crowded, even on a Sunday evening.I started with a glass of the 2006 Trimbach Muscat d'Alsace, and the bartender brought over some slices of soda bread, honey, and salted butter to nosh on.  My date and I first split the antipasti della casa, which was a wonderful assortment of meats, served with a small bit of parmigiano-reggiano and pickled eggplant.  The meats were wonderful, and the pickled eggplant was surprisingly tasty.  My only complaint was that I would have like a bit more cheese.  For our next course, we shared the hand-rolled ricotta gnudi, which was by far the highlight of the evening.  Even the bartender looked longingly at it as he handed it over.  Whereas gnocchi can often be chewy and poorly prepared, the gnudi--soft pillows of ricotta tossed in a bolognese--was delicate and delightful.  This was a dish I wish we hadn't shared, but instead ordered on our own.  We ordered some more wine (this time the red wine special of the day), and  the Colorado lamb chop as our final plate.  Again, we were not disappointed.  The lamb was tender and juicy, served alongside cauliflower-scape puree and vegetable ragout.  I chuckled at the thought that I had once been a vegetarian as I sat, a bit forlorn that the meal was over, already planning to return to try the veal schnitzel and the hot dog a la Maison.  \\nThe food is reasonably priced, although the plates are small.

Their biscuits (whether served with berries or as a yummy egg sandwich) are just The Best Biscuits.

Ordering process was nice enough- two friendly guys on a food truck.  I ordered their bacon burger, with a side of fries- which comes with lettuce, tomato, American cheese and jerk mayo. Immediately after receiving my order I noticed that the bun looked really greasy. And it felt that way in my hands. Yet, somehow, even with bacon (burnt), cheese and mayo, the inside was awfully dry. I had a few bites before my appetite left me. The truffle fries were edible- seasoned nicely, though some were crispy and some were less so. My other two friends felt similarly about their meals.

All of two tablespoons of gravy came on my completely unseasoned potatoes. I said something to her, but obviously my feedback went unheeded.I called in an order several weeks later for biscuits and gravy. There was so little gravy, I wasn't sure it was really there at all. I choked down half of a dry biscuit before I got so pissed off that I actually called and complained. Aside from being completely unsatisfied (and still hungry because I couldn't eat a nasty dry biscuit that came out of a bag of premade Costco crap), $8 for one biscuit, no gravy, and an over-easy egg is probably the worst deal in town. In fact, that was a masochist's breakfast. I really wish I could give you a chance to make it up to me, but you already fooled me twice, so shame on me.

The chef even came out to ask me if it turned out rare enough!  I was originally bummed they no longer had the seasonal 21A Hell or High Watermelon Beer- but I can't hold that against them because 1) its a seasonal beer, and 2) it's an SF beer- so kudos to them for even having it in the first place-but in the end, this burger made up for everything and I will definitely be chowing (and chuggin) down here again."},{"name":"Saltyard","address":"1820 Peachtree St NW, Ste 1","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Saltyard is a gem.

Its a really trendy place that I could see in Williamsburg (actually, can we put one over there...please?) Also, its vegan so everyone can eat here  (Im not vegan if that helps.)  Why did I like this place? It was a Tuesday night and there were a decent amount of people here, but everyone was able to find a place to sit or hang out without being on top of each other. The bartender was chill and attentive. The food came out pretty fast. I had the Eastern Bowl (it was a sizable portion, I took half home). Really tasty and filling, but only order if you like peanut butter. The beer on tap was pretty good, too. I thought everything was appropriately priced. If I lived in Portland, I'd probably make it out to this bar often. OH!

This Perimeter Mall Location is the second in the Metro area (Buckhead was first).  Cheescake Factory is a phenominom in the restaurant world.  It is wildly successul.  It is easy to pick on this place.  It has over the top gaudy decor, a large diner-like menu with actual paid product advertisements for car dealers and the like, and other quirky features.  With all that said, I like this place for what it is.  The food is fresh and tasty.  The namesake chessescakes are really good, and so are the other cakes and desserts.  The portions are huge and somewhat hard to finish.  The crowds that line up and wait for hours to eat here seem a little too devoted to all this excess.  I like to eat here in off hours or sit at the bar."},{"name":"Easy Tiger","address":"709 E 6th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Overall I would rate Easy Tiger four stars but my experience here was OK at best due to the lack of service. I like that there is an outdoor area and the fact that you can bring your dog. There is enough seating for everyone and I enjoyed the ambience of the outdoor patio. My friends got sausages with pretzel buns and I had the vegetarian sausage with a pretzel bun. The vegetarian sausage was quite good. We also shared some potato salad that was SO delicious. I ordered a side portion of potato salad for myself, but the waitress must have never put it in because I never got it nor did she ever check on us again before giving us the bill to see how we were doing with our food. All in all, the food and beer is worth making a trip to Easy Tiger.BUT the service was not so great at all. On top of forgetting to put in another order of potato salad, our waitress rarely checked on us, never offered to refill our waters or other drinks, and was not that friendly from the start. To top it all off, when it came to splitting the check, we didn't receive the proper change back at all. If your portion was 15 dollars and you give a 20 dollar bill, you should receive 5 dollars back. What did we receive? ONE DOLLAR back. Essentially, it appeared as if our waitress was taking a tip for herself and never checked back on us again as we were trying to figure out what really happened here. Something like this has NEVER happened to me and I am quite shocked that someone would do this. So, some pretty awful service indeed.

It was being hyped up on Facebook by, what seemed liked, my entire Friends list. Because of the hype, I'll give it a long review. Longer than what I'd usually do.They have some seriously huge cups. What was it, a litre? Could be hats. Holy smokes, I had to drink it in parts haha. There are half sizes too, so not to worry if a litre is overwhelming. Some customers in front of me were ordering half sizes. The menu has an awesome selection. So many drinks to choose from. It's not too crazy like Pearl Fever, which I appreciate. Sometimes putting too many options up can be bewildering. It's nice how they organize the drinks by type - Taro Smoothies, Famous Smoothies, Slushies, etc. It was much easier for me to decide what to order.They have brewed teas too. They said they brew it fresh on these two machines on the other side of their drink making area. I saw someone order a milk tea off the menu and then observed their drink being made. Definitely a cool experience watching freshly brewed tea being made.  There is food as well! Not like cakes/desserts, but actual hearty food. Tater-tine seems to be the most popular. I heard that being ordered often. I think next time I'll try the El Supremo. The picture showed chilli, sour cream, and onions. I don't even recall what a diet is anymore after checking out their food menu.Bubble waffles are offered as well, but they don't have the original flavour like at Sammy's. They have Red Velvet as their base flavour. It's unique because you can have Nutella, Ice Cream, or Whip (I think) as a side. Again, what is a diet???I ordered the Loco Ferrero. I TOTALLY went loco for the Loco. It was really delicious, but very rich. I think it would be great to have as a dessert after lunch or dinner. It's not too sweet as well. Other drinks looked good - the fruit menu, green apple, taro coconut, and they even have yakult! My childhood yogurt drink haha. I might try that next. Service was pretty good. At the time there were two guys and one girl. Based on the flag and Manny Pacquiao photos, it must be a Filipino-owned establishment. That's pretty awesome. It's nice to see a bubble tea place being owned and run by a nationality other than Taiwanese and Chinese. It shows how anyone can have bubble tea. I'm not sure if they were the actual owners though. One of the guys was making the drinks, but the other one was at the register. He was extremely conversational. Made the experience fun and informative. He knew a lot about the brewed teas. He was very descriptive when we asked what the differences were. He made recommendations from the main menu regarding what drinks we should try out. He seemed very passionate about bubble tea which was cool.We decided to get one more drink for my friend's sister because we loved ours so much. This time the girl was at the register and the one speaking to us earlier was making the drinks. She was nice, but not as conversational as the other guy. My friend and I didn't feel like we got the same exciting service like we did from the other guy. She was super quiet and soft spoken and didn't really talk to us. She answered any questions we had about the drinks, but she didn't really elaborate. The other guy enthusiastically greeted us like, \\"Hi! How are you doing today? We have a great menu selection of smoothies and teas to choose from!\\" The girl just said, \\"Hi. *smiles* How are you? *smlles*\\" silence. She had a cute outfit on though - leggings and a grey shirt and hair tied up in a bun. It doesn't seem important, but it made me feel like I didn't have to dress up or anything, so that was good. I'm not sure if they have more staff, but I hope they're like the man who helped us first.The interior design is well done. They have wide, rectangular tables for playing games like Jenga and Monopoly. We saw lots of people playing games while enjoying their drinks. I've never seen a bbt place offer stuff to do before. There are tall windows so the space feels open and inviting. It was a sunny day when we visited, so the place was lit up. It was so busy when we went. The line up was long. Must be the new go-to place in Coquitlam.Pearl Fever's got competition for sure!!! I recommend everyone to check this place out. I think, since it's so close to the schools, it would be a safe place for younger kids to hang out rather than being out on the streets.

I suppose that we should be grateful for the oil that it was slathered in as it helped our group of four choke it down.If we all weren't so terribly hungry, it is likely we would have left the restaurant to find better flavour (I think McDonalds would have been more satisfying).I think the least disappointing portion of the meal was the coconut curry veggie dish but once again... too sweet and lacking any real curry flavour. Honestly, one of the most disappointing Thai food experiences I have ever had  (Thai food at the mall is far better).The laid back vibe of our friends and the comedy of just how terrible the food was, salvaged, what I would otherwise classify as a dining disaster.So.. if you classify yourself as a foodie or have an appreciation for authentic Thai flavour, I advise that you dine elsewhere (If in Yaletown, Thai Bistro is much better).(This rating is based primarily on food quality and flavour. If it were based on the eye catching Thai style staff uniforms that the staff wore and service I would have given this restaurant 4 stars)."},{"name":"Jester King Brewery","address":"13187 Fitzhugh Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Drive and drive and drive and you'll find yourself pulling down a dirt road to the Jester King Brewery. Today was the grand opening and boy oh boy was it a success. I got there way to early and stumbled upon a Beer Advocate tasting session which had about fifty or so amazing and rare brews, whoops. Pretty soon after 1:00pm the place was packed and the bands started rocking. There were classic cars, a BBQ bus, and a butt-load of people. The brewery itself is pretty small for the amount of land it's located on, the had about 6 900 gallon tanks and a rack of whiskey barrels across from them filled with the Commercial Suicide. All the Jester King beers were available and I particularly liked the Boxers Revenge. They definitely had more people than they expected and it ended up taking a loooong time to get a refill...I cut in line many times. This location will be great for future events and parties.

Nice touch that if you order a salad with your entree, that your drink is included at no charge!The best part of the meal was the bread and garlic butter...oh, swoon - that garlic butter.  Don't miss it, and ask for extra!What we most enjoyed about our meal was the hospitality of the owner (I regret that we didn't catch his name) and his charismatic 9 year-old daughter Emily, who is just a whiz kid behind that register.

I've looked through the reviews here and am surprised at the comments about service--it has always been excellent for us whenever we have gone. We went last night for our anniversary and had a marvelous meal with a great waiter--I mean really great: personable, funny, helpful, and efficient. We didn't want to order everything at once, but order one dish at a time and figure things out as we went, which is a real pain in the butt for a waiter, but he rolled with it. I wish I knew his name so I could mention him personally. If you feel you didn't have good service, try again. Everybody has an off night once in a while.Food: The calamari are pretty special, as are the pumpkin tortoloni. Last night the pears were not really ripe in that dish, but it IS late October, and they still tasted good--the gorgonzola sauce is fantastic. There do seem to be a lot of cream sauces on the menu, (it's Northern Italian) but they all have rich complex flavors that we love. Even the filet has a cream sauce, and though I'm not generally a fan of steak with a sauce, I make an exception here--it's delicious. We also have always enjoyed the salads; the Sienna Salad with crumpled Italian blue cheese, caremelized hazelnuts, and raspberries is wonderful. The pasta dishes we have tried are also good, like the gnocchi and the Ravioli ai Funghi. The zucchini spaghetti is surprisingly good, as well. You can get a half order as a first course (which I always do!).Music: Last night the music kicked in about 9:15; just in time for desert and port. They were out of canoli, which was sad for my wife, but she ordered the tirami su and loved it. I went for the chocolate volcano: warm chocolate cake filled with chocolate, topped with gelato. Chocolate craving satisfied: CHECK!. The music was top notch and there are TV monitors in the various rooms so you can watch the band without being in the bar. The cuban jazz was tight and professional. Chanti gets really wonderful musicians to play there (looking forward to Joe Pino's next visit!) and we are lucky to have this club right in the downtown.I've had some magnificent meals in Boston and New York that could trump the food at Chanti (for a lot more money!). I've also had many that should have been better given their reputation and cost.  But for a small restaurant on the North Shore, Chianti really is a great place to enjoy an evening--and it's just down the street. Highly recommended."},{"name":"Muqueca Restaurant","address":"1008 Cambridge St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"One of the bf's best high school friends was in town, so we arranged to meet her plus two other people at Muqueca for a late lunch.

It's built in the lobby of a former hotel and there is no detail spared- from the vintage letterpress plates lining the stairs to the stuffed monocle-wearing bear head to the moss art that hangs at the entrance. I felt like I stepped into a page out of Alice in Wonderland. Not only that but the beers on tap were all local Oregon beers- a treat for me being from out of town.

I had no idea what to expect but after checking it out, I will definitely be back. \\nThey serve a homemade red pepper dip with homemade bread at every table. It was DELICIOUS. The great thing was that before my boyfriend and I even finished the dip, they brought over another bowl of it. Both of our meals came with the Coban Salad which was very yummy- tomatoes, green peppers, onions, feta, olives and spices...mmmm! I was actually stuffed before our entrees even came so I would recommend taking it easy on the dip (if you can stay away!). We split the Firinda Patlican and the Yogurt Kebab. Both delicious and very different from each other. Next time I go I'll probably try a few different tapas instead of getting a main meal. The table next to us ordered quite a few and althouh they were quite small, they looked really good. The pricing was average- $14-$18 for an entree. I think the tapas were around $5-$9 per plate. They don't have alcohol which obviously isn't a must but I guess I just assume that it will be served at every restaurant! We split the rice pudding at the end which was very refreshing. \\nThe service was excellent! The kitchen closes at 10 and we walked in at about 9:35pm. I felt bad and I was expecting an attitude from the waitress but they were super friendly and didn't even seem to notice the time. Our food was brought to us in a timely manner and they definitely weren't trying to rush us out of there. At around 10:30pm most of the patrons were leaving/had left and the waitress turned off the lights.

The pretzel was crusted with rock salt.. too much salt for me; I ended up scraping it off. The beer cheese def tasted like beer, but it was cold. Not expected at all.

We ordered a few sides as well. The borracho beans were pretty beer-y, grilled sweet potatoes were yummy (a little cool though), and the roasted cauliflower and chickpea salad was great (large size). These sides were definitely shareable, esp since the pretzel was huge!I ended up taking a lot to go, which made for a nice midnight snack!"},{"name":"La Casita","address":"101 W Cordova Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"How this place even musters a three star average is beyond me. Watched a soda that was incorrectly delivered and sipped out of replopped on another table where it belonged shortly thereafter. Service was near abysmal; no chips and salsa (or whatever that was) on the table for at least twenty minutes. Food was subpar at best. Beans tasted straight out of a can.

Do yourself a favor and order the steak fajitas. The tenderness and flavor of their citrus, chilie marinated steak is so delicious. Didn't care too much for the chicken since it seemed dry to me.Portions are huge! You get enough near to make atleast 4-5 fajitas , and can always ask for extra on the toppings.Decor is really cool. Chandeliers made from beer bottles, rustic decor. Atmosphere was very welcoming and colorful on the outside."},{"name":"Pasta Da Pulcinella","address":"1123 Peachtree Walk NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"This was the best restaurant I ate at during my trip to Atlanta. Was very close to the Residence Inn in Midtown. The waiter at the restaurant was great, recommended their house speciality and it was with it. Awesome service and food. The restaurant is a renovated house that looked beautiful."},{"name":"Pasta Da Pulcinella","address":"1123 Peachtree Walk NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Uhm hello, where have you been all my life? Pasta Da Pulcinella is not a large restaurant.. when you walk in, it feels like someone simply converted a house into an eating place. There are tables in what would normally be the \\"living room\\" of the house, and it extends towards the back. That being said, it was nice and cozy inside - I didn't feel like I was dining at a restaurant, I instead felt as if I had been invited to and was dining inside someone's home. Anyways - as with many other Italian eateries, they give you bread with olive oil when sitting down. AND IT WAS THE BEST I'D EVER HAD. HOLY CRAP. Soft, warm, bread.. tasted like it was freshly baked. That dipped in the olive oil was nothing short of divine. And then food... I had the mushroom ravioli. The ravioli was incredible - mushrooms tasted FRESH, the sauce was incredibly creamy, plus they had these little garlic bits here and there which was GOOD. Also had a glass of white wine, don't remember which one it was (oops), but still deliciously fruity. Bottom line - I am really, really, picky when it comes to Italian food. I refuse to visit Maggiano's and be content. But this place was excellent. Service was top notch (the servers all wear these black fedoras, which was really cute!), the portions were not too big (quality over quantity!), and overall had a very satisfying experience. Will be back soon!"},{"name":"Saltyard","address":"1820 Peachtree St NW, Ste 1","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"The fresh vegetable dishes are insanely delectable and such a beautiful display. The oysters were the cleanest, most fresh ones I have ever had. The meat dishes were not my favorite. The crispy duck was not very crispy and it was extremely salty like the restaurants name. The short rib was just good. I ordered the chocolate nemesis and was so happy I did. The dense chocolate cake was topped with roasted marshmallows, drizzled with basil syrup, and top with sour black berries. It was a brilliant combination of flavors. I would stick with a vegetarian meal here."},{"name":"Flatiron Restaurant & Bar","address":"520 Flat Shoals Ave SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"When you walk in, you sort of think to yourself, \\"this place has no business calling itself a restaurant.\\"  It is a bar that sells food. Plain and simple.  The inside was a little smokey, so we sat ourselves at a table outside.  The wait staff was friendly but a little inattentive.  We asked about the Yelp EAV specials and were given a pretty quick \\"no, we aren't doing anything.\\"  Bummer. Oh well, it was pretty cheap anyway, so we weren't banking on specials to help foot the bill.They had a relatively large beer menu, probably about 10 beers on tap and an even larger bottled list.  The food was good for bar food.  My friend who ordered the burger said it was better than others she has had at some restaurants in Atlanta.  I think if I lived in the area, I would be likely to come back, but it's certainly not a food destination.  Considering I live north of midtown, I doubt I will return."},{"name":"Early Harvest Diner","address":"25 Broadway St","city":"Wakefield","stars":"4","text":"This is our new favorite breakfast diner.

The Monk was good enough...but a selection of more under $8 healthy portioned vegetarian food would have me (and I am sure MANY other vegetarian/vegan Portlander's) coming back for more. I would love more options outside my breakfeast faves such as Jam, Genies, and Cup and Saucer... that are a 2 block walk from home like this place. The Library Cafe is nearby, next to Mt Scott park and is just awesome.Add some free coffee for those waiting outside... and Toast will really thrive as well.

The restaurant is fairly spacious that seems to fit a lot of people, but I've heard of crazy long wait on weekends. So when you are in Portland and want to dine at Tasty n Sons, wait if you must, otherwise choose the oddest and most inconvenient time of the day to come to beat the long wait. We eat breakfast in the morning, lunch at noon, and dinner in the evening. However, here at Tasty n Sons, guess what, you can also enjoy their yummy breakfast dishes at any time of the day til closing time. Love it! Their menu offers a variety of small and large plates of family style food. Furthermore, nothing runs over $10, well, I lied, some costs $11 or $12. Sweet and savory, we did want to try everything on the menu, but our pockets and stomachs could not handle all. 1. Griddled bacon wrapped date with maple syrup & almond. Bacon and date, what a strange combination, but everyone raves about it, so we tried it. For us, though we could taste the smoky bacon and viscous texture of the date, sweetness of the maple syrup was a little overwhelming. 3 stars.2. Moroccan Chicken Hash with harissa cream & over easy egg. What a great comforting dish. It smelled delicious. It tasted delicious. The chicken was very tender. 5 stars.3. Steak & Eggs with cornmeal pancake & jalape√±o butter. The steak was flavorful and juicy but I didn't enjoy my cornmeal pancake. 4 stars.4. Pork Cutlets with fried egg & saut√©ed spinach. The pork was a little salty and dry, we won't be ordering that next time. 2.5 stars.5. Polenta & Sausage Ragu with mozzarella & fried egg. We've never had polenta before, it looked like baby food to us, but it tasted delicious. 3.5 stars.6. Auntie Paula's French Toast with  with rhubarb-berry maple syrup & whipped cream. OMG. Simply amazing! Enough said. 5 stars7. Fried Egg & Cheddar Biscuit with fried chicken (or smoked guanciale or sausage). The dish carried a dry-looking with fried egg, chicken, cheese stacking on each other.
