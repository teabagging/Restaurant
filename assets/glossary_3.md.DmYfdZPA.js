I walked away thinking I'd never really crave anything I'd ordered, but I would certainly order or eat it again. For value, as some others have noted, the quantity of protein included is a light. I'm pretty confident there was 2 or 3 oz pre-cooked weight chicken in each dish. Veggies were large-cut, making for a full box with lots of airspace. So, lots of rice and sauce. That's OK. I like rice and sauce.\\n\\nTo be frank, I'd rather pay another buck or two for a little more protein, and to have the veggies (especially the peppers) in a more stir-fry julienne size. This, in turn, translates in to me being perfectly happy dining with China Emperor again - for delivery.

However, this spring parsnip foam wasn't just ordinary foam. It had real texture and substance- almost more like a creme than a foam.

I have gone back to Cafe Luna repeatedly, not only because it's within walking distance, but because it is well worth it. I've often brought out-of-town guests and every single person has literally roLLLLLed out of there satisfied. Of all that I have tried, I would recommend:\\n\\nLemon-Berry Waffles: lemon curd and mascarpone, strawberries, blueberries, blackberries on a Brussels style waffle - complete with a balanced amount of whipped cream. This is by far my FAVORITE (!!!), and I never tire of it. This says a lot since I am someone who likes to try something different every time - yet for some reason, I cannot help but stray back to this staple. Everything about it is satisfying - light, fluffy, sweet, creamy, slight kicks of tart, no raspberries (I have an aversion to them), and leaves you full yet not overwhelmed. I cannot tout it's goodness enough. \\n\\nEverything but the Kitchen Sink: noted as a \\"Staff Favorite\\" and understandably so. Containing bacon, corned beef hash, sausage, ham, a poached egg over a Brussels style waffle. A great protein option and leaves you full for much of the day. \\n\\nSurf & Turf Eggs Benedict: eggs Benedict style on top of a fist-sized sirloin steak and a lobster tail, atop English muffins, complete with asparagus and Hollandaise sauce. The lobster was a little dry the one time I tried it which tends to make it slightly rubbery, but not enough to be distracting; it could have also been a one-time thing. This dish was especially good in that it really highlights the strengths of Cafe Luna - the eggs Benedict. I am not a fan of eggs Benedict, but the way Cafe Luna makes it - makes we really want it.\\n\\nBerry Stuffed French Toast: strawberries, blueberries, strawberry mascarpone packed between two slices of french toast. Good enough without maple syrup, stands alone very well. \\n\\nMonte Cristo sandwich: ham and Swiss cheese nestled between french toast Brioche; for dipping - jam, Dijon mustard, syrup. *Tip: this can also be ordered for take-out\\n\\nOther recs: banana pecan pancakes, pear goat cheese omelet, lobster eggs Benedict...just try it all!\\n\\n\\nOther thoughts: Coffee with free refills. I have heard that the cinnamon rolls are yum but have not tried them personally. Outdoor seating is great on a sunny day. The owner/host is friendly, helpful, attentive, and takes the time to explain to you how the food is prepared, the way the ingredients are incorporated, the chef's skills, and it is clear that the food is the focus here. Tip: it helps to come early, the wait can be long - anywhere from 15-70 minutes. In my experience, they may quote you (for example) that it'll take 40 minutes, but in reality it turn out to only be 20 minutes. It'd better to come in at 10 am as opposed to 2 pm - so it'd be easier to just come earlier, eat and go home and take a nap than come later and wait until 3 pm or so to eat.

The same blonde manager came and checked in on us and wished Amy a happy birthday as soon as the surprise was out and even recommended some kind of Spanish wine which was fabulous but you can't go wrong with the sangria. We had two paellas one seafood and one vegetable and they took a while but definitely worth it! The seafood was the favorite. The flamenco singer even gave Amy a shoutout and sang happy birthday which was a such a treat.

I got the Milk and Honey waffle to share with my partner and we both enjoyed it. It's very big, though, so keep that in mind. The topping is a goat cheese mousse--creamy, soft, and not too sweet. Then it was drizzled with honey and roasted pistachios. I, personally, found the pistachios to be too salty, but this may be because they kept falling off the waffle and so I would just eat them afterwards. I definitely wouldn't classify this as your classic street cart food though.

It was a Sunday afternoon, with a (very loud) folk band playing live and football on TV. The bar was full, so I was sat next to the band's PA at a two-top highboy. I requested that I be sat at one of the four-tops further away to preserve my hearing, but was told those were reserved for larger parties. Desperate for food, I sucked it up and sat at the highboy. My waiter came by, and I couldn't tell you his name because he never introduced himself or said anything besides, \\"do you want a beer or drink?\\" I can say he wore a grey fedora (uh oh). I wasn't ready yet, so asked for a few moments, to which he nodded and walked off. \\n\\nI am a glutton for punishment, so any time I see brisket on the menu at a BBQ joint, I order it. It's consistently the most mediocre of menu items at any BBQ joint that dares offer it, but when it's good, they usually knock it out of the park. I'm firmly of the opinion that most BBQ joints shouldn't even offer brisket, because most are incapable of preparing it. But like I said, I'm a glutton for punishment...It's my go-to method for evaluating a BBQ restaurant. If your brisket sucks, don't offer it, and if you do, expect a poor review!\\n\\nThis time was no different, except that it took 12 minutes and asking the hostess to send my waiter over for my order. I ordered the brisket plate with mac-n-cheese and redneck caviar. It arrived quickly, but I was immediately disappointed with the sight of the meal. The two (LOL, what!?) thin slices of brisket were visually dry. The \\"slice of white bread\\" was literally an 1/8th inch thin end piece of white bread. Not even a full end-piece, mind you. The redneck caviar was the most boring version I'd ever encountered, consisting of just canned black beans and corn with the occasional canned diced tomato or red onion. No spices, no salt, it was literally a bowl of cold, canned vegetables. Most redneck caviar I've had in my life has been seasoned and had a little more \\"oomph\\" and ingredient variety. The only redeeming aspect of my meal was the decent \\"3-cheese mac 'n' cheese.\\" It wasn't great, but it was good. \\n\\nBrisket was bland, dry, and the bark tasted burnt. \\n\\nNot even accounting for taste, the menu across the board was overpriced. I'm from Memphis and travel all over the US for a living. I know my BBQ. My internal BBQ red flag alert system goes off when I see $14 pulled pork sandwiches with a single side. I knew better going in, but like I said, I was desperately hungry and it was either this or Subway. I should have saved the money, grief, and time spent writing this review and gone to Subway. \\n\\nI'm giving The Smoke Ring two stars because the establishment seemed clean and well-kept, but the food and service were poor, and overpriced. Take the brisket off the menu--it's terrible, hire some QA for taste-testing and presentation, and fire anyone that wears a fedora to work. You might be able to improve to a 3-star establishment."},{"name":"Arleta Library Bakery Cafe","address":"5513 SE 72nd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I am the guy who orders his biscuits and gravy with the gravy on the side.

There is another place in town that I think has better biscuits.  Best gravy?  I don't eat all that much gravy, but this version (rosemary sausage) is one of the best gravy's I've ever had.  Don't go by me though.  I'm not a gravy connoisseur.  I'd like to be one, but I don't see it happening.  One more thing about this dish.

At first, I thought that there was not much flavour to the soup but once you add the kimchi, beansprouts, etc. it begins to have a very complex and rich, albeit spicy, flavour. Too spicy for me, unfortunately, so I could not enjoy it. But it is nice to pour the steaming broth over rice to eat on a cold winter's day.\\n\\nIt misses the five star review because flavours were so-so (non-spicy Korean food just ends up tasting bland), prices here are expensive ($25 for the pot of soup) and service is minimal (I had to ask for a tea refill).

They were sort of like Korean Fried Chicken...but Vietnamese/Thai style. The wings are very lightly battered and them tossed in a sticky sauce of fish sauce, garlic, sugar, and other ingredients. The wings were pretty salty and so the sticky rice is definitely a must.\\nThe roasted chicken came stuffed like tons of lemongrass under the skin and 2 dipping sauces that I can't quite remember. One was fish sauce based and another seemed tamarind based.

I couldn't really tell apart the different ingredients in there. It tasted pretty much like what I imagined \\"mystery\\" veggie-fruit smoothie would taste like...  The fruits were really fresh, but it was definitely impossible to pick up on the \\"healthy\\" stuff though.  I mean, what is phytoplankton supposed to taste like?! o_O\\n\\nI betrayed my heart and did not get the one with durian as one of the ingredients. I didn't know if I'd be able to drink it for three hours straight to keep me awake for the long drive back to Houston... total fail ='(  But if you are into durian, give it a try!

Interesting little restaurant that's situated in a fairly touristy spot. The setup of the restaurant was fun--outdoor seating available with additional seats inside and upstairs. Coming on a Thursday afternoon the wait was only 15 mins. \\n\\nFood wise, this place serves southeast Asian food, not just Thai food. Therefore a lot of the dishes have Vietnamese influences in them as well. The dishes were relatively small for the price you pay but after eating breakfast, 2 dishes for 2 people was enough for me. \\n-Ike's chicken wing: the popular, highly rated wings. Comes with 6 pieces for about $15-16. The flavor was good, burst of sweet,salty, slightly spicy taste. I thought it was on the saltier side and was really glad I got the catfish vermicelli dish to balance it out. \\n-catfish vermicelli: sorry this is not the legit name but that's essentially how I would describe it. If you've ever had Vietnamese bun (vermicelli with fish sauce dressing) then this is what you'll expect. Except, this dish tastes much more earthy and green with the dill, cilantro, and lemongrass additives. I think to properly enjoy this dish, squeeze on the lime, use the sauce it comes with, and mix well! There's really little catfish IMO, considering Vietnamese catfish dishes usually comes with the whole thing. You'll get about 5-6 small chunks.\\n\\nThey also serve alcohol, which i opted out of. $12 for all cocktails. \\n\\nOverall, I don't think I would return only because I've been spoiled with asian fried chicken in my life.

The Papaya Pok has a nice kick to it and the coconut rice is a nice complement. Of course, the star attraction is the famous spicy fish sauce wings. The wings are pretty big and more than enough for two people. I was a bit disappointed that I had them come spicy and unlike the papaya salad, the wings were mild. Still, the sauce itself is pretty dang amazing - a mixture of fish sauce, spices and sugar and slathered all over. The best part was really picking off the sauce bits that came off of the wings (I know...I'm a glutton). Some pickled veggies come with the wings luckily in case you don't order any veggies separately although I think the rice is really necessary here as the wings are pretty salty on their own. Also got the whiskey sour which was super solid. They have a pretty wide variety of drinks from draft beer to imported Vietnamese beer (bottled) to a lot of different cocktails. The menu itself is pretty fascinating and surprisingly detailed - giving you the inside look into the food, the inspirations and their suggestions \\n+I came at an odd time around 3:00PMish on a Friday and getting seated at the bar was pretty quick. They also have a take away section to the side. The decor itself is an interesting bar/tin feel. \\n+Service was friendly and the food came out pretty quick. Two restrooms in the back doesn't make it too much of a hassle if you need to wash your hands, especially post-wings. \\n\\n+/- Seemed a bit pricey to me here.

I've ordered delivery another two times.\\n\\nDelivery: Bad. Slow. It took exactly 50 minutes both times. I am literally 4 minutes up the road. Both deliveries had mistakes. The first delivery, they sent the wrong pizza slice. The second delivery a few months later, they left off the dessert even though the receipt they handed me showed a dessert. Both times they eventually came by with the right food, but there was no offer of refund or credit. Nor was there an apology from anyone. Keep in mind: this is two separate orders in two separate months, both messed up. I won't be ordering delivery again from Mo's.\\n\\nIn-house service: Worse. There isn't really much 'service' once you sit down. I don't expect much hand-holding from a pizza joint. However. I do expect them to get my order right, and promptly. Two of the three times I visited in-store something went wrong just trying to order. Once, the brunette woman working the counter had to go to the kitchen three times to ask questions about how to enter the order. It took 5 minutes just to place the order, after standing in line for 10 minutes. The other time, they somehow 'wiped out' my order. The staff didn't catch it. I want back to the counter after 20 minutes of getting no food. THEN they realized their mistake.\\n\\nFood: Meh. In a word I'd say, \\"inconsistent.\\" The pizza is decent and the slices are a generous size... but sometimes the crust is burned.

With one kid in school and another one off, we had to stay in town, but had time to do things we otherwise would have to do on weekends. Brunch at Slappy Cakes, for example. Since we went midmorning on a weekday, there was no wait when we went. We sat at one of the griddle tables and our nice server explained how it all worked. \\nNow, she said that one bottle would make four or five small pancakes, so I thought it would be best to order two. If I would have read the reviews before I went, I would have known that one bottle would have been enough for both of us. Before I go any further, I have to say that I stay from places were you cook your own food. Seriously, I won't even go to fondue places. I cook at home, so I find it silly to pay to go cook at a restaurant. That said, I thought my son would really, really enjoy this and so I caved. I was right. He loved making his pancakes. We have a griddle at home, but I'll make one kind of pancakes and maybe have about two options for toppings. One of the cool things about Slappy Cakes is that you can customize what goes in and on your pancakes. My son chose peanut butter batter with chocolate chips, pecans, and whipped cream. I went with buttermilk batter, green apples, granola, and lavender honey. Other than drinks (chocolate milk and coffee) that's all we ordered. \\nThere are a lot of really little kids here, which I don't understand. I mean like toddlers and babies. A large table was taken by what looked like a mommy group with their kiddies (none of which looked older than two). The babies were clearly too young to be interested or safely able to cook, yet they took up a lot of the griddles. I don't know, I just don't get it, but whatever. \\nI thought it was pricey for what it was. The bill came out to more than $30 for just my kid and me. No cocktails, no sides, and a lot of leftover wasted batter. With tip, it was closer to $40. I was doing mental math about how many pancakes I could make at home for that much. I get it, though. It's the experience and it's cute and kids like it. I'd give it three stars but my son said he gives it five stars, so I'm reluctantly compromising on four stars. \\nMy son also wanted me to mention that he likes the pancake art they have on their back wall and wants that in his room (that's not happening)."},{"name":"Cici's Pizza","address":"7767 W Irlo Bronson Memorial Hwy","city":"Kissimmee","stars":"2.5","text":"Food was fantastic, which was a few different kinds of pizza with a topping/salad bar and few desserts.

However, despite the extensive variety of food options and the caliber of these food offerings, the key qualifier here is \\"for a buffet.\\" Yes, the sushi is good... for a buffet. The snow crab legs are okay... for a buffet. The hot entrees and hibachi are decent... for a buffet. If I went to a full-service sit-down restaurant and was served most of the sushi rolls here, I would be incredibly unhappy. But that's not the point. The point is, you come here to gorge yourself on a million things that are just okay.\\n\\nThis place bills itself as a sushi and seafood buffet. It costs $30 per person to come and eat whatever the heck you want. As far as their title offering, they serve at least a dozen kinds of maki rolls, quite a bit of nigiri, and some sashimi/tartare options. The fish quality was decent. It's not what you'll find at Sushi House Hayakawa, but nothing I tasted was pungent or terrible. Rolls are on the creative fusion end of the spectrum, with lots of fried tempura bits and heavy-handed portions of sauce. If you prefer to actually taste fish in your sushi, you'll still be satisfied with the nigiri and sashimi. They don't rely on rice to stuff the rolls, which is fine because the rice is a little off - not quite as vinegared or finely textured as good sushi rice.\\n\\nAs far as seafood goes, you'll find options like shrimp tempura, ceviche salad, snow crab legs (served cold), and oysters (ditto). Everything was fine, nothing standout. The same went for the hibachi station, although we loved the scallops that they served. Skip the bare-bones dessert line (unless some unripe fresh fruit appeals to you) and go straight to the crepe station, where the thin pancakes are filled with canned fruit preserves but strangely delicious.\\n\\nOne more thing worth mentioning. While I was there, an elderly lady smiled politely as she elbowed her way to the front of the crab line and took every single crab leg on the tray despite a sign asking patrons to take a maximum of five at a time. Tons of disappointed diners behind her went crab-less until the next round was plated. She did this multiple times, to the point where strangers were bonding in line over how diabolical she was. Don't be that old lady. It's a buffet, people - take your five and come back as many times as you want. Respect your fellow buffet comrades.\\n\\nThat being said, the service is fantastic - at least the server we had on our visit. He took excellent care of us, keeping our beverages full and accommodating a few random requests for extra eel sauce and other treats.\\n\\nI wouldn't be opposed to coming back, but I think I'd rather spend $30 on a couple of great-quality sushi rolls at a place like Hayakawa."},{"name":"La Fruta Feliz","address":"3124 Manor Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Rating well deserved.

Asked if they had room and they asked if we had reservations and when we said 'no' they kind of laughed at us which really bugged me. \\nBut that was 2 years ago so I'm somewhat over that. \\nWe walked by a few Saturdays ago, was starving and it was 5:00 - they had just opened. They said they had a reservation for a table for 2 at 6:00 so if we thought we could be done by then, they could get us in. That was fair so we took it.  If I had a reservation at 6 - I'd want it be really available. \\n\\nIt was my FAVORITE!!!! I really like pappardelle pasta but it is rare to find especially with a sauce I want. They have it homemade here and you can substitute as pasta in any dish for $2... sold!!! So I got Linguine Squarciarella and subbed Pappardelle. It was the BEST pasta dish ever!!!  It wasn't your usual red tomato sauce.  In fact, to me, it wasn't very saucy or too creamy.  It lists \\"egg\\" as an ingredient but I didn't notice it and forgot it was even part of the dish but I sure tasted the cheese.  Yummy!\\nIt was quick so we just had water - not wine - and were given no attitude... usually you feel obligated to get wine when you go Italian but maybe it was because they wanted us out in a hurry. I actually couldn't eat all of it so I have leftover of it the next and I was excited!!!  I usually am not a leftover person - I mean well but then I just don't want this dish again - especially when it was as rich as this was.  But that all went out the window - I couldn't wait to be hungry to eat it again!\\n\\nThe place has a casual feel and is more like a kitchen than a fancy dining room.  There were young children there but they were definitely not abundant like at an Olive Garden :-)"},{"name":"Los Mariachis Mexican Restaurant","address":"3610 S High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"The food is ok here but the service is horrible.

You'll find the typical brunch items like pancakes, eggs, waffles, biscuits & gravy, plenty of fresh fruit etc. But they also put out some of their specialty dishes like the King Ranch Casserole, Chorizo & Eggs, Jalapeno Grits & Green Chili Mac & Cheese.

BUT the sushi is much much better at nori nori vs Sidneys.\\n\\n  So far the 3rd incarnation of this sushi buffet (after minado and badayori), and so far the best one. Even the old plates say minado on them. Anywho, whoever posted the pictures is great! i should do that more often. The food on those pictures is pretty much exactly what you get. I think lunch is $16 and dinner is like $25. They trust you to be responsible eaters, and dont have signs posted up saying, \\"don't waste, etc...\\". I dunno, i find those signs an affront to my sense of etiquite  (sp?). Then again i am a buffet snob.\\n\\n  I had a Saturday lunch. Worth the money. The udon is great. The sushi is good too. The basic buffet types nigiri stuff is there like egg, shrimp, tuna, salmon, octopus, mackerel, snapper, surf clam...actually 2nd thought thats alot. Reasonable size and well made. No paper thin fish over an orange sized ball of rice. Then again it's not your huge man sized slab of fish...i think they appropriate fish/rice ratio pieces.  Also they have like 10 types of rolls i think. They also make like 6 types of handrolls at request. \\n\\n  The cold salad items are the usual stuff. The hot items for lunch are usual stuff too, mix of terayaki, tempura, and few random chinese items. Dessert is included and they have soft serve ice cream and some cakes.  Drinks are extra, I think like $2 for a coke, unlimited refills.\\n\\nI think its a good place to go to if you gotta have a buffet and are sick of golden corral, sweet tomatoes, ryans, and all those chinese buffets.

The setas were cooked to perfection, and how a simple mushroom can be coaxed to taste like that, I do not know. I can cook a good mushroom, but they brought the seta to a whole new level. The cerviche was also spot on. To start, they bring crisp plantains with a spectacular sauce instead of the usual (and often tired) breadbasket. This reflects attention to many of the small touches that make up a positive experience.  \\n\\nWe returned to Casa B twice during the afternoon. They have a happy hour of sorts from 5-6 Monday through Friday, offering some of their tapas half-off. This fits perfect with our hectic schedule fitting in between work and home.

Ok so finally after my wife asks how much longer while pointing at all the open tables we get seated and we wait and wait and wait.  No drink order. No waitress. The tables around us are still empty.  I see the manager waking my way so I wave my hand but he seems to be staring at the ground and doesn't see me. I yell out \\"hello!\\" And walks 5 feet past me.  I catch him on the other side of the front to tell him of our situation.   We get a waitress and I ask her if this was her table and she said it was not.   So this is how a good Resturant goes bad.  And who is to blame?  The waitress?  No.  The manager.

You cannot walk more than a few steps and not find food. Everywhere you turn there is another mouthwatering sight of food. The streets are lined with food stands, food stalls, small counter restaurants, full fledged dining establishments and of course the famous night markets. The Taiwanese night market scene is a culture of it's own. Noticeably, more of these night markets are in close proximity to schools, colleges and mast city centers.  It seems like Taipei 101 Taiwan Cuisine (not the skyscraper) took a page out their homeland play book and opened up within close proximity to University of Central Florida.\\n\\nImagine a night market and street food stands rolled up under an indoor roof. The setting is quite clean and bright. This has to be the cleanest bathroom I've seen in a restaurant this size in a very long time. Glass topped tables with Taiwanese newspapers and magazines allow for browsing while waiting. There is an ordering counter with a huge kitchen. Place your order, pay and take a seat. Your food will arrive as its being cooked. Most of their items are small portions or snack sized and priced accordingly. No doubt pricing has something to do with it's college clientele more so, I think pricing has to do with Taiwan street prices. You can get really full with a few dollars walking down a Taiwanese street or snacking at a night market. There is no getting around the distinct difference between Taiwanese cuisine and other Asian cuisines. Taiwanese lightly season to allow the true flavors of food to shine. Although, there are regular American Chinese fare like General Tso and Orange Chicken on this menu also. Your less adventurous friends will not feel left out. We ate to our hearts delight. Full food review on my blog.\\n\\nTaipei 101 has certainly presented Taiwanese Cuisine well on the East side of Orlando. If you are hesitant to try something new, go for the American Chinese food and slip in a item that you would not have tried. Take it from there. This restaurant does not offer a fanciful dining experience, but an honest straight forward look into their food. I encourage you to go with a group, order many items and try them. You might be surprised to find yourself liking some of these items and end up on a plane to experience the real night markets of Taiwan."},{"name":"Mi Victoria Bakery","address":"5200 E William Cannon Dr","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I love this place!

Some reviews do need to be flagged due to incompetence. 2. You have the opportunity to walk out as soon as you see the prices.  3. Reviews and pricing are relevant to the local surrounding area. 4.

The owners/cooks really want to give you their best. The menu was well thought out. It has a perfect choice of options for everyone. The sushi was one of the best I've had. This is an ideal place for the business lunch or those meeting up with the girls for an outing. I really needed to change my first rating but was delayed due to personal illness.

This place runs several specials throughout the day and the turkey with brie caught my eye on the small blackboard located outside on the sidewalk by the door. This location is nestled in an old historical building smack dab in the middle of downtown Titusville. There is plenty of parking either on the street or in lots within walking distance. The pricing is reasonable with sandwiches available in half sizes as well. My sandwich was available with a wide assortment of side item choices including fresh fruit pasta salad or chips and a pickle. Initially I asked for fresh fruit and then after contemplating the rest of the menu and realizing that they had cobbler, (yes, yes, I know the name has cobbler in it but sometimes that doesn't mean anything) I chose chips and a pickle instead. The chips were nice and suitable served up in a decent size bag and were of the \\"wavy\\" variety. There was a sizable portion of meat and cheese on this sandwich. I found it to be quite tasty.\\n\\nAlthough this location is an historical building, it doesn't feel rundown at all and they've done a good job of upgrading the restrooms. There are some interesting photographs on the walls and knickknacks of interest as well. This location also has a decent wireless connection for guests as well. I saw a poster that explained that they had a live performer on Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights. There is a bar at this location and from what I gathered they only served beer and wine but I may be wrong and it could be a full bar.\\n\\nThe service was good and thorough, with the waitress bringing ice tea when needed and providing plenty of opportunity for me to express my concern over any issues I might have had with my meal but not to the point of hovering. I had unsweet tea with lemon and it wasn't cloudy or chalky which is a plus. It was a bit expensive at $2.50 however it is unlimited and it is served and a large glass. They offer several varieties of cobbler including peach, blueberry, blackberry, and Apple with oatmeal. I asked which one I should get as I would like them all and I was told that they rarely have the Apple and that it was worthy of trying. She also suggested that I get it with ice cream which I did. I found the presentation interesting as it seem like the small bowl contained an outer rim of apples in a heavy sugar sauce with what amounted to be an oatmeal muffin in the middle stacked with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. To be honest it wasn't very good and it felt excessively sweet to me I did attempt to mix the \\"muffin\\" in with the rest of the apples, but it still seemed a little odd to me and I also found it to be excessively sweet.\\n\\nThings to note, they do not take American Express and you pay by bringing your ticket up to the bar/counter. Overall I feel like this place would be worthy of a second visit, based on the sandwich itself and the level of service but unfortunately I'm reluctant to try the namesake dessert again if they're all prepared the same way. I'll let you know next time I'm in town."},{"name":"Moonshine Patio Bar & Grill","address":"303 Red River St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Live music and fun people - quintessentially South Austin!

The oyster sliders practically melts in your mouth and I really enjoyed the breading they used on the fried oysters.  The lobster roe pasta came out perfect and I could distinctly taste the infusion of lobster in every bite of the noodle.

There is a large patio that overlooks Piedmont Ave and the Park. It is really nice to sit outside on nice evenings. When we sat down, we did a survey of the clientele. The only way that I could describe it was frat-tastic. Loads of hair gel, untucked button up shirts, khaki shorts and boat shoes without socks seemed to be the standard clothing choice. Just looking at the clientele, I wouldn't have thought that I was in the gayborhood (Midtown). \\n\\nOur server came over pretty quickly. I can't remember his name but he was in good spirits, seemed to be enjoying his evening, and brought the drinks pretty quick. My boyfriend is a vegetarian so he ordered the black bean burger and I ordered the Nacho Totchos.

Even though I'm rating this place three stars, it's really more worth three and a half.\\n\\nAfter craving Korean bbq for a while and never really venturing out, I finally took the plunge and drove out after going through several reviews.  I was expecting a little hole-in-the-wall place, with gas-fired grills and a wall fridge of meats, so imagine my surprise when I found a decently appointed, if not plain, place.  Several bbq tables line the sides of the central seating area, while one side has three private rooms, and the other floor seating around the grills.\\n\\nWe originally sat at a grill table, but after discovering that we were only getting one grill order, we were asked to move to a standard table.  Um, sure, I suppose.  It wasn't until later that I found out that the reason behind this is because instead of gas grills, Hae Woon Dae goes with charcoal.\\n\\nI ordered the bulgogi, while my not-hungry partner ordered a small appetizer of dumplings.  My dish was cooked in the kitchen and served on a cast iron plate, much like fajitas at Mexican places.  And of course, out came the spread of side dishes that are a hallmark of Korean food.  The bulgogi was tender and well marinated, an excellent star on top of rice.  The flavor was nicely complex, though it lacked a bit of depth, wearing off shortly after it hit the tongue.\\n\\nThe side dishes were all also well done, although I feel that some of the flavors have been toned down for the benefit of Atlanta's less adventurous clientle.  I usually can't stand the heat or spice of kimchee, but in an adventurous mood (and egged on by my friend), I went ahead and took a bite.  A little spicy, but most certainly not the kimchee I remember from travels, or even trips to Korea-town in Los Angeles.  The stewed potato chunks were perhaps the highlight of the side dishes, delivering on flavor complexity and depth that the bulgogi itself lacked.\\n\\nOne of the biggest disappointments, though, was the pricing.  $16.95 for bulgogi?  $18.95 for the short ribs?  Surely all of these could be less by at least five dollars or more.  Just as some flavors seem to be toned down for the more \\"American\\" audience, Hae Woon Dae seems to be charging a premium for the \\"cool\\" factor of having food cooked in your table, as well as being Korean.  I may have to go back for their lunch specials, which, for $7, seem far more reasonable.\\n\\nHae Woon Dae will probably not enter my regular reprtoire quite yet as I seek out other Korean places.  I'd gladly trade some ambience factor for more of the Korean flavor I love.  But until I find one of those, I wouldn't be against going back, especially if a late night food craving hits (they're open til 6am!)."},{"name":"Oregon Culinary Institute","address":"1701 SW Jefferson St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"I went here to celebrate my roommate's birthday yesterday.

It did start to get pretty crowded a little after 7pm, so watch out for that if you plan on arriving a little later.\\n\\nService was prompt and unemotional, which is to be expected for this type of simple Chinese venue. The menu is overwhelmingly extensive, with soups, noodles, and rice dishes galore featuring veggies, chicken, beef, pork, seafood, and everything in-between. For those of you that prefer things like General Tso's Chicken, fear not, they have it (how dare you!). After ordering, it took about 5 minutes for our food to be delivered complete with the largest serving of (free) steamed rice that I've seen in a Chinese restaurant. Seriously, I don't know how many restaurants I've been to that only give small bowls or try to charge you for it.\\n\\nWe ordered the Chicken Lo Mein and the BBQ Pork, both of which were less than $9 and were almost enough for two people separately. The lo mein was excellent and toed the line between being too dry and too saucy almost perfectly. If you want to avoid super salty foods, then this probably isn't the best dish (or restaurant) for you to be eating. The serving size of the BBQ Pork was much larger than anticipated and sadly much of it was relegated to leftovers. The pork wasn't overly sweet, which seems to be a common problem for many Chinese BBQ dishes. It was well cooked and almost melts in your mouth. I'd highly recommend you try one of their BBQ dishes as the general consensus seems to be they are the \\"best\\" offerings at this restaurant.\\n\\nI definitely will be coming back here in the future for my Chinese food cravings.

They argued that getting a short beer pour is not the same as getting shorted at the gas station.

So glad we walked out of McMenamins and came here....\\n\\nFood is marvelous for a dive bar, nearly everything is made in house and scrumptious... We had the Crater Lake burger $12 with bacon, cheese, egg, dripping with juicy goodness as its Fulton hand made patty and a ton of their battered crispy fries. Also the BBQ chicken sandwich w/fries $12 with bacon, smoked cheddar cheese was so good. It was fresh grilled chicken breast, so juicy and the bacon had great flavor.  I struggled to eat it, but forced myself since it was that good.  High quality chicken, like their other meats.  Healthy portions, we were both stuffed and hadn't eaten all day. \\n\\nI can't say the atmosphere has improved from an aesthetic / decor point, but I love a dive bar, so found it very comfortable.  Yes, it could use some decorating if I'm being honest, as it's a bit stark, but the service from the bartender was so good, he made up for it.  Speaking of the bartender, their drink pours are generous, more so than most other places around.  They have some great micros on tap, like Boneyard RPM and Fort George vortex.  Margaritas are amazing and heavily  poured..$5 and well worth it. The female server who brought out our food was the only real disappointment, she wasn't engaging or that friendly.  We had to ask her for napkins, salt, pepper, etc....and she acted as if we were asking for the moon. However, the bartender more than made up for her semi-rudeness.

The portion was a good size for one person, and was served with a side plate of pickled mustard greens, Kiefer lime, onions, and ground chili. The chicken was excellently cooked, tender, and falling off the bone. The dish fell short on the broth because it was disappointingly bland. The perfect Khao Soi broth has the sweetness of the coconut milk balanced out by the rich, savory spices. This dish hinted at those flavors, I could taste the essence of what Khao Soi should be, and it reminded me of what I ate in Thailand, but it ultimately didn't measure up. Because the broth was so bland, it didn't adequately lend its flavor to the chicken and noodles, which made the whole dish suffer. \\n\\nPrices: Okay, so I know this place is famous, but based on the above, I wouldn't spend another $15 on the same dish again. It's unfortunate, because if the broth were more flavorful, I would say $15 is a steal, because you wouldn't find anything closer short of flying to Thailand.\\n\\nService: No issues, came for lunch on the weekend, was seated immediately with the choice of a table or the bar."},{"name":"The Meatball Stoppe","address":"7325 Lake Underhill Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Great mom and pop restaurant.

So that's what I'm going to write about in this review.\\n\\nAfter late Saturday nights (Well I mean till 2am. Oh, Cambridge/Boston, what have you done with your nightlife...) Caf√© Luna was there on Sunday to help me get through the day with an amazing brunch. Yes, that's what brunch is made for in my book, eat some delicious food to wash the hungover away and chat about the events of last night.\\n\\nI've been there about 4 times in the last 2 months and always had a great experience.\\n\\nIt's a really small restaurant with inside and outside tables, nice layout, very typical of what you would imagine a Brunch place to be. \\nIt's also very crowded because of the good reviews and nice location so if you have a big party you should probably make a reservation.\\nI often go there around 2pm, there are still some people waiting in line but if I'm on my own I just sit at the bar and talk with the staff who is young and very friendly. \\nThe owner, who is the one responsible to sit the customers, is also really friendly and polite, you will feel at ease instantaneously. \\nI really appreciated that last time he offered me a table outside even though I was by myself.\\n\\nSo about the meals: It got me addicted to this place and excited to go back. \\n\\nI'm usually the type of person who finds in a menu maybe one or two thing he really wants to eat but at Caf√© Luna I just wanted to try them all.\\nI really recommend the Eggs Benedict Lobster (my favorite), Corned Beef Hash and the Three Eggs Omelet with lobster. I usually drink fresh orange juice there, so I did not explore the drinks area of Caf√© Luna.\\nNice quantity but not too much either so you can enjoy the rest of your day without feeling like you ate too much. That's something that I need to underline because in the States sometimes the food amount is just out of control... And then I feel bad not eating everything, regretting it for days and days after (Yes I'm being dramatic right now).\\nThe food comes pretty fast after you ordered it, waiters are nice and ask frequently if you need anything, which is a good point as this place gets so busy and crowded. This way you don't have to yell for somebody to take your order.\\n\\nIf I had to be very picky, and at this stage it would just mean being bitchy, I would say that Caf√© Luna would really need two bathrooms, they currently just have one for both sexes, and a bigger space. But really, I think that the small dimensions of Caf√© Luna are part of its charm. \\n\\nOh and again, it's all about delicious food in a nice place with friendly people. \\nThat's perfect to me."},{"name":"Suzette Creperie","address":"3342 SE Belmont St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"I found Suzzette's while looking for somewhere to get dinner around 9:30pm on a Saturday.

If that makes sense. The waiting area has a rocking chair! The bar has love sofa! What's not to love here?\\n\\nThe food here is pretty unique and varied. There is really something for everyone. We ordered the tablas de dips, which are three dips, artichoke, fava bean, and goat cheese, with plantain chips. The fava bean was my favorite, wish I could order that by itself. We also got the chicken hearts in licor 4, chorizo \\"spider\\", columbian cheese fritters, yucca fries, meatballs in guava sauce, and columbian shrimp coctails. The chicken hearts were so strange, because you're eating a chicken heart which should be savory, but its actually extremely sweet due to the licor 43.

This place gets hoppin' quickly, even on a weeknight.\\n\\nMy husband and I tried this place for a birthday dinner, for which it was perfect. Our table was off in a little nook so we felt like we had privacy while still getting to take in the whole room. I had their signature cocktail, the Beltline Cooler, made with Hendricks, sweet & sour, & fresh cucumber... spectacular! We warmed up with the steak tartare and their special appetizer of the night, gigantic fried oysters. Also spectacular. We each had a steak & one of their ala carte sides, which turned out to be a perfect amount of food. You might bat an eye at the $7/side price, but each is a generous portion of heaven (we had baked sweet potatoes with gruyere & sonoma mushrooms). The cooking temperatures are dead-on to the descriptions on the menu... medium rare had a nice char on the outside with about 25% pink and 75% red on the inside. This being a birthday occasion, we HAD to try dessert. We had irish coffees to accompany Baked Alaska & Bread Pudding. Right on par with the rest of our experience. I even got a candle in my bread pudding! Rick, our server, was great and I'd ask for him again.\\n\\nSummary: everything is exquisite, & there's something for everyone. Except vegetarians."},{"name":"Moonshine Patio Bar & Grill","address":"303 Red River St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Finally came to eat here yesterday.

The free breakfast consisted of juice, coffee, choice of cereals, oatmeal, fruit, bread and pastries. There is a little beauty shop next door (the Fuzzy Peach LOL) for anyone needing a Brazilian wax pronto, and plenty of eateries nearby, including a Sprouts grocery store for the health conscious folks. There is a bike shop in walking distance, and is right by the 225 and 204 bus.  Lots of nice, normal bodies around. Some of them may have been ghosts, as this place has the furnishings and makings of a creaky old haunted house.  Bottom line is that I enjoyed my stay here, it was clean, and people were friendly and easy going.....down to the lady watching over breakfast.

Our plans to celebrate our birthday with heavenly dessert turned into a hellish experience after my twin sister (who is 6 months pregnant) bit into a truffle from the chocolate decadence platter that had obvious mold in it.  To make matters worse, after we alerted the server (Katie, who was absolutely wonderful), the manager, Will Delito, had the nerve to tell us that \\"it was okay\\" [to eat the mold].  My twin sister was very upset and extremely worried about getting sick or any possible harm to the baby.  We kept her calm, but I went to talk to him privately.  I told Will that in no way is it acceptable to eat mold nor is it safe, particularly in pregnancy. Three people at that table are in health care including my sister who was the one exposed to the mold.  When I asked for his business card,  he gave me the general card for the store.  I had to return to him and ask him again for his name and contact information.  He \\ncould not give me his supervisor's information.  I had to come back and second time to talk to him further and asked him to apologize personally to my sister.  He tried to offer us some more dessert, but I told him that we had all lost our appetite.  My only concern was that they would take care of this situation, and my sister if she became ill.

If that's what you want then just change the price and give us what we expect without having to ask for it."},{"name":"Firehouse Tavern","address":"38 S Vernon St","city":"Sunbury","stars":"4","text":"This is a great place.

My girlfriend (and also the coauthor of this review) and I wanted to catch a nice morning breakfast before a busy day, but our first choice at Starliner Diner proved to be too full, and thus, we had to settle for sloppy seconds. Abner's is in the heart of Downtown Hilliard, and is situated right next to an auto-repair shop. This is probably the reason why, as one other reviewer pointed out, the place smelled pungently of motor oil. \\n\\nUpon walking in, we were, unfortunately, only greeted by said motor oil, as there wasn't a hostess present. Eventually, a very particular older woman, who spoke with her frown and discontent, lead us to our table. From then on, we were visited by three different waitresses, which was a little confusing, but we were eventually waited on by a much friendlier, yet, just as aloof, waitress.\\n\\nNot being too impressed by the service or the decor (which was old and dreary and cheaply decorated with Halloween stuffs), the food was going to be a breaking point between one or two stars. Admittedly, the food was of decent portion, and was fairly priced, Certainly not Starliner Diner, but it was a nicer alternative to, say, McDonald's. Well, actually, McDonald's is actually nicer in that it isn't drab and dark as a hospice facility, but we digress.

I've been going to several of the locations for years, but the Buckhead location is Creme de la Cubana in my book.\\n\\nThey have my vote for some of the best chips and salsa in Atlanta.  Always fresh, always full of flavor, and always refilled.  The Margaritas are delish as well.  Warning:  they hit you hard, so be aware of the aftermath.

There are a lot more better all-u-can-eat restaurants in Richmond. Their food has really gone down in quality for late night since it first started along with their service as well! Their menu lacks to describe any limitations on food quantity as they advertise to be an \\"all-u-can-eat\\" japanese dining. It's understandable to have limitations on certain items, but at least decribe it on the menu. Also if customers want to order a certain quantity of the same item (within reason accounting for people) then the staff should comply. A suggestion from the staff about quantity is ok, but don't just cut the customers orders without giving notice. The staff here lacks training on how to accommodate customers on seating as well when clearly if a table is not big enough to fit a larger party, simply suggest a bigger table or just add extra tables without jeopardizing the availabitlity of tables to other customers (if it's busy and if the tables aren't reserved). \\n\\nOverall, I would not recommend sushi at this place any time unless this place has had some serious retraining of their staff and a complete revision on how the business is run."},{"name":"Everett Street Bistro","address":"1140 NW Everett St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"if you're going to have breakfast here. you HAVE to order the \\"Everett BLT.\\"  it was my first trying this place and i was recommended the BLT, by both my friends & the server.  it's an delicious breakfast open-faced sandwich. thick slice of toasted bread with a light lemon aioli spread, generous amounts of bacon, bruschetta and a fried egg to top it off!  i usually like to add hot sauce, but the flavors were so great on their own that i didn't want to change anything.  it's not the cheapest breakfast, but we're talking quality.

So we went with this place since the menu looked tasty. we sat down and the server came over an explained they were only open for dinner over the last 8 weeks but they were a known brunch place and to def. try and come back for brunch. All this before we even looked at the menu. Anyway, we liked the looks, loved the ambiance and deco and thought we were in for a great dinner. so: dinner 1. Lamb burger. the flavor was spot on, the lamb tasted fresh and i love lamb so that was great. drawback: bun. The burger looked lost on the huge bun they served it on. I mean, i prefer less bun and more stuff. The lettuce/tomato etc was on the side...which was fine with me since I don't put that on a lamb burger. Seriously need to work on the bun. and maybe make the burger a little more substantial. I had just come from a place in VT where the burgers were out of this world and huge so this just looked so little. anyway...French Fries were fantastic. Truffle oil. crisp, just like I like them. really tasty. Def order them if you like truffle oil flavor fries. Dinner 2: we had the salad greens with roasted butternut squash and caramelized onions. loved it. needed no dressing but the one they had was sweet. I don't like sweet so I found it too sweet for me. The salad was large and really nice and good amount of everything in it. Goat cheese was not skimpy. was worth it. would def. order that one again. Dinner3: Southern fried chicken. Ok. here is where I felt they dropped the ball. I have lived in the south for over 28 years now and they have not go it right. WAY too much breading. was burnt a little and when I eat out I don't really want to worry about bones. Would have loved a boneless breast. This was a little messy to eat because of it. If they could fix the breading and the frying and the bones it would be good. otherwise, would not order it again. ;I think they were trying too hard to almost do the chicken/waffle thing but they don't have it. so with that said, I think they are a good solid place to eat just be aware that it is not overly expensive but not cheap either. i liked they had outdoor seating but it was hot and we opted for the inside seating.

Nothing really special on the menu to set them apart, but they have all the standards you'd expect. The prices are a bit steep. $10 for a burger. But that seems to be normal now. The fry basket had potential. There were a LOT of fries in it. It says it can satisfy two people, and it definitely has enough fries to do so. I had to add a bunch of salt to make them taste better, and they were a bit soggy, but overall not too bad. They were kind of like if the fries from Five Guys had a socially awkward younger brother. The burger was good. Weirdly the bun was actually the best part, as it had a buttery taste, but that not to say the burger was bad. I just really liked the bun. Only problem was I ordered my burger medium, and the edges definitely were, but the middle was practically rare. But yeah, overall the burger was still pretty good.

Typically a busy place on any given weekend the weekday crowd tends to be more towards the dinner hour. Service is friendly and can be helpful with the various dishes or sushi you are not familiar with.\\n\\nThis is not your typical buffet sushi by any means this is higher end quality meats, the rice is cooked perfectly without being mushy or overly sticky, the nigiri and rolls are hand crafted with care, which is amazing when you consider you can walk up to a plate of some fifty pieces of salmon nigiri for the taking!\\n\\nThe buffet bar is shaped like an L with a desert section tucked in at the end. The bottom side of the L is a length of plated nigiri, maki, and other rolls with lunch containing the more common less exotic items while dinner will can feature Unagi, Mirugai, and sahshimi. Coming around the bottom along the stubby side of the L you find sauces, dips, and sahsimi (dinner). The inside track of the L finds various salads and then around the bend starts the hot bar portion of the buffet. The dishes vary from common Japanese, various fusion, and then some more traditional fare for those less adventure types.\\n\\nThe desert bar is filled with tiny cakes, flan, pastries, and gelatin. Nothing here stands out as something stellar but all of it is flavorful and hits the sweet notes without being so over powering to make one queasy on a full tummy.\\n\\nI don't toss out many 5 stars but for the price and quality alone this is a stand out sushi spot. Top that with rotating buffet items and creative side dishes to keep the return trips interesting and you have the magic formula that has kept Nori Nori's doors open and it's seats filled."},{"name":"Thuyen Vien","address":"Mills 50 1216 E Colonial Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Stopped by this place today for lunch.

Perfection!\\n\\nAlso, not to be forgotten is the authenticity of the banchan (side dishes).

My family and I got to the restaurant before the huge line hit on the friday evening, with only one lady and her family ahead of us. We waited a good amount of time before the waiter inside even took notice of us and reassured us of our place in line. In fact a third lady literally walked into the middle of the restaurant before the waiter actually acknowledged those waiting outside. One would think that a restaurant who have seen busy days so often will have a more organized waiting system. At least provide a sign saying line this way or take a number, or just come out quickly and ask us how many are in our party? Nope none of that.\\n\\nWhen we finally got seated we ordered the alfredo squid ink pasta, puttanesca squid ink pasta, and a calamari clam combo. Both squid pastas were ok, but the sauces outshone the novelty of the squid ink pasta. I found that the ink may have made the pasta too tough, more than al dente. The calamari clam combo in white sauce though was quite good, and better than the squid ink dishes in my opinion.\\n\\nHowever despite the good food, I certainly didn't enjoy the wait it took to get it. Like another reviewer pointed out, the cook waited for all the orders to be collected so he can push the food out all at once. Though this is convenient for the cook it is unfair to customers who have arrived first, and even more unfair to the slowly forming line outside who could have gotten to eat faster if the cook was not only working for his own convenience.

The place was more of a bar than it was a restaurant . The sign said seat yourself and there was no where to sit,maybe because it was a Friday night. I waited at least 10minutes for a table and initially even before walking in I was going to dine in..however after being there for the short time the music was so loud I couldn't hear myself think. When a table did become available I waited for the waitress to come over, but she was too busy flirting with a male patron. Eventually a waiter did come over and ask me what I wanted. I looked over the menu and found that the prices were way too high.The burgers range from 10-12 dollars and come with uncut fries . The one 12 dollar burger I was looking at had Canadian bacon, egg fries and cheese on it, and although it looked good I decided that 12 dollars was a bit expensive . I opted for turkey club . It was 9 dollars and came with fresh oven roasted turkey breast, bacon, lettuce, light mayo, and tomato. Also with uncut fries.

Roe. Noodles.  Without a doubt as amazing as everyone and their mothers say and then some.  Tender, fatty short ribs burst with savory flavor alongside hefty chunks of succulent lobster.  They're accompanied by grounded, earthy notes from the mushrooms and then surrounded by such delicately delicious, lightly al dente pasta.  Suffice it to say, I could easily go through three orders of this.  No joke.\\n\\nAs for appetizers, the Crispy IC Oyster Sliders are very good and really elevated by the creamy, zesty lime chile aioli.  I'd daresay though that the brioche, though very good, is a bit on the doughy side and detracts a bit from the oyster within.  The No Shell Prince Edward Island Mussels, however, brought a totally unexpected lightness along with its mildly briny flavors.  Absolutely delicious.  I'll add that the Fried Clams are some of the best I've come across yet.  Not quite sure why there are fries underneath them...but those were good too so down the hatch they went ;)\\n\\nUnfortunately, I have to agree with some of the naysayers regarding Mrs. Bennett's Seafood Casserole.  Its tomato-based sauce is too runny and has very muddled, murky flavors.  I did appreciate the gigantic scallops, fish and lobster at least.  Overall though, I wouldn't order this again.\\n\\nAnd the extensive variety of oysters.  Pricey?  Yes.  Expertly shucked, fantastic and even better than those of Neptune?

There was nothing processed or frozen about them. They were however a little greasy and oily - but that didn't take away from the amazingness. We got the sweet chili, plain and garlic Parmesan sauces - nothing too exotic. I was hoping for more of a flavor with the garlic Parmesan because it was a bit bland. The sweet chili was spot on - though I found it more spicy than I thought it would be. The plain tenders were perfect. Added a little pepper for taste which really made them great. \\n\\nThe waffle fries were just okay. They seemed a little seasoned - so if you're into that- you will like it.

What we got was a inexcusable wait for a table for 6 that we were told would be available shortly, but after 10-15 mins we were told that it wasn't available at all. (It was a MONDAY, it wasn't crowded, nor was there a wait list) The host ran to the back, we saw he was on the phone and we never saw him again. Once we got a table that was right in front of us the whole time, we had no service (not even an offer for water) until my sister got up to ask if we could get drinks from someone, anyone. Then the drinks took almost as long as the initial wait. Mothers drink wasn't very good and once we finished ours drinks. Guess what? That's right, MORE waiting, just to get our order. At the point we were finally greeted, my appetite was on the fringe and wasn't sure what I wanted if anything more than just pancakes so I declined to order right away. After everyone got their food and I felt a little more inspired to eat something more, I asked very specifically that my potatoes be crispy and what I got was mush, and undercooked and inedible. It was disgusting and we've been coming here for years, and have brought lots of different friends and family members in. We noticed a little difference (decline) over the last year and thought maybe it would be different this time. BOY! How we were wrong!! Never coming back, never giving into their smug stupid Portlandia service again. Thank you for ruining her birthday! Oh and not a single comp for anything, not a single apology for the wait and charged for coffees that some didn't order or drink either.

They excitedly described various items and lunch combinations on the menu for a good 5 minutes, walking us through the delectable array of spring roll appetizers and pho and banh mi sandwiches. There was one comment that knocked them from a 4 star to a 3 star. One of the male servers said, \\"The ribs are really delicious and hearty...a good choice for the men!\\" My female co-worker and I immediately exchanged confused glances.

We had an assortment of appetizers to share for the table including spring rolls, grape leaf rolls, and beef carpaccio (which was a bit intimidating with near raw slices of tenderloin). I tried the shrimp and chicken satay (both fully cooked). The chicken was pretty dry, but the shrimp was delicious.\\n\\nOur group ordered a smorgasbord of different plates, so it was interesting to see the parade of dishes that came to our table. The banh mi sandwiches emerged in little wax paper wrappers, and the rice dish (not sure of the name) came out with a bright green pile of bright green rice that looked St. Patty's Day appropriate. I ordered the soup and salad combo - crab and asparagus soup with a vegetable salad. The soup had a savory and hearty flavor (salty but not too salty), and the salad was surprisingly sweet (there were definitely apples in there). It was a delicious and surprising combination of flavors.\\n\\nI would say that 85% of our group was pleased with their selections.

However, this review is mostly going to take note of my most recent experience with the weekend lunch buffet, which at $9.99 is quite a bargain for the variety offered.  \\n\\nThe day we went, there was a wide range of items to select from, including appetizers, chutneys, main dishes, soup, and desserts.  Please note that there is also chai tea on the buffet, so do not make the mistake I did and order normal tea (I had not gone back to see the buffet when asked about drinks and so did not realize) unless you prefer it to the chai.  \\nAnyways, everything, including both types of tea, was very tasty, though highlights would be excellent tandoori chicken and phenomenal bread. Of the latter, the traditional naan was available of course, but even better was a soft, puffy bread, which I think was poori although much thicker and tastier than any poori I've had til now.   It reminded me of a sopapilla not yet coated in honey. Definitely give it a try if it is available.  \\nI also very much enjoyed that they had delicious samosa up for grabs, excellent in flavor and texture.  \\nReally, the only item I was not particularly fond of was \\"chicken 65,\\" and that was only for the fact it tasted rather like buffalo wing sauce, which I dislike.  If you do enjoy that taste, go for it. \\n\\nService was quite fine and friendly.  I have no complaints.

You order at the front, then sit down. The platters are a combination of vegetables, rice, and protein. The food cooks pretty fast, and they smartly put a paper guard around the platter to protect against grease splatters. Once the protein is cooked to your desired amount, you can put it on top of the veggies or rice to stop cooking it. Unfortunately, if you like to mix your veggies, rice, and protein together, there's not a really good way to do that while stopping your meat from getting cooked further. They don't typically give you extra bowls or plates to put the cooked food in afterwards, but you probably could ask for some. I'd visit at least for the novelty.\\n\\nThe dishes seem to have very simple flavoring, the kobe steak I tried was pleasantly flavored with a little pepper. They also provide honey brown sauce and garlic soy sauce for additional flavor. It tastes pretty good, but the portions aren't quite filling. Prices for most dishes are around $9 - $15, while specialty cuts cost over $30.

The migas plate here remains an extremely reasonable $6.99, while places like Mi Madre's have jacked it up to nearly $10.\\n\\nThe migas plate:  generous amount of eggs; not overwhelmed by tortillas or pico; cheese wasn't neon or inedible.  These are the pillars of good migas.  You think it would be hard to mess up a migas plate, but I've seen it done.  Fortunately this migas plate is solid.  The beans are good, and the potatoes they give you are.. weirdly deep-fried and crusty, for sure.

I decided to try Counter Culture, and I have to say, I was left hoping for more.\\n\\nI visited the place during brunch, which may be the reason why I felt shorted out of a good experience since their brunch menu is limited.  I ordered their burrito with no changes, I didn't use the aioli though (I'm just not a fan neither in the vegetarian/vegan world nor meat eating world).  At first sight, the burrito looks bomb.  It was a good, tasty, presentation but once I bit into it, it was a bit of a disappointment.\\n\\nThe burrito was not very flavorful. I couldn't distinguish the taste from the cashew cheese, potatoes, tofu, and vegan sausage being used.  Yet it all blended into this one taste that was ok, but not something one would write home about.  I think the whole burrito was too much soy product and imitation whatever.  All of this was over all... flavorless\\n\\nThe food was adequate. My mom did love her tofu rancheros though so maybe it was just the burrito? ÔøΩ?\\n\\nI would try this place again at a different time (not brunch) and go back because it will take the hunger away but I wouldn't seek it out."},{"name":"Smoke Ring","address":"309 Nelson St SW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"I found this on Yelp and tried it based on reviews.

It's worth it - I think they toast it in some kind of special oil or butter because it tasted a bit like the meat in the hash). \\n\\nThe friends got BBQ brisket, breakfast monte cristo, and corned beef hash as well. I tried each, and I have to say, Allston Diner nailed the salty-sweet combo of the breakfast monte cristo! Fluffy, chewy French toast with bacon, ham, swiss cheese, and egg inside? Sold. \\n\\nThe reason why I give it 3 stars instead of 5 is because the service wasn't the best. Our waitress was a little aloof, we had to wait a long time to get our check processed even though the place was almost empty, and their Level Up screen was down (and judging by what the waitress said, it seems like it's been down for a while). \\n\\n(*Added downside, though it doesn't influence the 3 star review - they use styrofoam containers for takeout.

Beef looked a little dry but it was relatively tender which is a good thing.

The calamari didn't look like calamari. i expected fried rings and legs but it was more like long strips of calamari. It kind of threw me off. I expected some heat since 'Pepper' was in the name but it wasn't hot at all. I'd say it was just ok. Now, the Spicy Lobster is where its at. chunks of lobster fried and then drizzled with some kind of spicy sauce that had a kick. Not sure what was in the sauce but it seemed like siracha mixed with some kind of cream sauce. \\n\\nNext I had a cup of the French Onion Soup. It was alright but had too much wine/brandy/whatever alcohol goes in french onion soup for my taste. But it was hot and had melted cheese so I polished that right off. \\n\\nEntree was the 7oz. Filet Oscar. Steak was cooked exactly like i wanted. Crab and the Bearnaise sauce were excellent and gave the steak more flavor. I think they may have forgotten salt and pepper the steak when it was cooking. I ate the whole thing so either I was really starving or it was better than I'm remembering now.\\n\\nWe shared a bunch of different sides amongst our group. We got fries and mashed potatoes, neither of which I tried because they seemed very basic.

I had a fabulous time and came away very impressed.\\n\\nFor starters, the space is gorgeous.  I'm not well-versed in either design or architecture, but I appreciate both and like to think I have a good eye.  The bar area downstairs opens onto the street and features an eclectic collection of dozens of small mirrors.  The dining area upstairs mixes rich benches and sofas with plush dining chairs.  The entire space is romantically lit and feels warm, rich, and yet somehow cozy and inviting.\\n\\nThe food was delicious.  We had a limited fixed menu for the event.  I started with a tuna tartare, moved on to a pan-roasted hake, and ended with a trio of sorbets.  The tuna tartare featured tiny bits of Barlett pear and a pine nut foam, both of which I really enjoyed and hadn't ever tasted before.  The pear really lightened up the dish and gave it a very interesting texture.  The hake, served over a bed of vegetables, including asparagus, sun-dried tomatoes, and trumpet royales, was incredibly delicious.  The hake itself was perfectly cooked-- melt-in-your-mouth tender, and I found myself craving more of the vegetables (especially the trumpet royales, a type of mushroom), too, once I'd polished off the entire dish.\\n\\nI've had better sorbet elsewhere, although one of the flavors had this interesting tea flavor to it that I found very refreshing.  Most of my friends ordered the gianduja palette, a type of hazelnut mousse cake, with salted caramel ice cream, though, and I noticed that they all licked their plates clean.  (I admit to having a little dessert envy and regretting my decision to \\"be healthy\\"-- don't make the same mistake I did and go with your gut instincts to indulge instead.)\\n\\nI don't think a decent meal here would break the bank (a five-course tasting menu is $85, and you can come in very much under that if you do three courses a la carte), but I do hail from Manhattan, and my sensibilities may be dull.

I love the way they bring big bowls of steamed rice to your table just moments after you place your order. Sure the place is noisy crowded and just about every surface in there seems just a little bit sticky, but the all the food I've tried there so far makes me kiss my thumb and index fingertip in appreciation.\\n\\nWe went in last night for dinner and I had the shrimp with lobster sauce. Tasty smooth generous portion.  I really wanted to order the creamy Walnut shrimp but my budget did not allow it for this occasion. My dining companions had the mouthwatering  bbq pork (the sweet red glaze is what really makes it special,) and a stir fried veggie combo that consisted of mushrooms,bamboo shoots and snow pea pods. We split a huge order of sauteed snow pea leaves (one of my absolute FAVORITE vegetables ever, with the Chinese broccoli following in a close second! And I haven't found them anywhere else but here at Din Ho.) We also had an order of the steamed buns which are awesome for mopping up the sauces on your plate. I also had a not too greasy egg roll -kinda generic pork and veggie filled but it was good nonetheless. I also need to give a shout out to the smoked duck which I've had in the past. I'm not really a fan of duck but theirs is worth mentioning especially since that's the first thing you see upon entering this establishment. \\n\\nI need to try more dishes there, so hopefully I can add more to this review.

They were never busy but it was hard to get her attention since she avoided any eye contact or looking at our discretion. One time we had to ask her a question about the dish we got, she just quickly mumbled about that's how it should be and walked away quickly, no eye contact, not even waiting for us to finish the conversation!!

The papaya salad was decent but not exactly refreshing. The fish sauce overpowered the taste of the vegetables in the dish.

If you're looking for a slightly pretentious date location, this could be a winner. There is a long wait without reservations; we waited ~45 minutes.  You can also sit at the bar, which seemed fun. \\n\\nThe service could be better. There was nothing outright wrong...I just never felt they were fast or friendly. In fact, it almost felt like I was asking for a favor each time I spoke up. Service alone would be a 3.\\n\\nEnough, on to the food! I don't remember which raw oysters we got but they were all amazing. You just can't go wrong! However, be forewarned - they're pricey at $3 each.  The mussels simmered in creamy white wine, garlic, and shallot sauce were super fresh and flavorful and the creamy sauce was so good that I happily mopped up it all up with the extra bread. The oyster sliders weren't that crispy but the bread provided the necessary crispiness to contrast with the softness of the oyster. The clam chowder which everyone raves about...I will rave about too. My bf and I ordered just one bowl and had the kitchen split it into two. We both felt that was enough. The soup was filled with hearty chunks of bacon and potato in it. Mmm! It made me want to curl up on my couch and wrap myself in a warm blanket. As for the entrees, skip the lobster roll. After eating at Neptune's Oyster, I was ecstatic about trying this but what a flop! It's COLD! Who makes COLD lobster in COLD plain mayo on a COLD flavorless generic bun? It tasted like something the grocery stores would make..and fridge. This went home half bitten.  PASS. The lobster roe noodles were great. The pasta tasted freshly homemade with large chunks of fresh lobster.  The carbonara was great too but unfortunately it's a rotating dish. I wasn't impressed by the ICOB doughnuts which is just your typical deep fried doughnut hole except for the awesome raspberry sauce it came with. Dipping a Dunkin Doughnut's munchkin in that sauce would probably taste much better. \\n\\nIn all, my tummy left super happy and I'd love to go back again."},{"name":"Powell's City of Books","address":"1005 W Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"Visited on June 13, 2018. \\nIf you are a book lover, this place is heavenly!

I ordered the garlic tonkotsu shoyu ramen, and my husband got the chicken rich ramen, which doesn't have any pork ingredients in it. He appreciated that, cause he doesn't eat pork.

The Chicken Caesar salad is most likely one of the best Chicken Caesar salads I've had - the lettuce is always fresh, with tasty croutons, and they are not skimpy with the chicken portions.  May I add that their Caesar dressing is perfection.  The potato salad is very different from other potato salads that I've tried in that it's not your boring, typical potato salad.  They give you decent sized potato chunks with carrot slivers mixed with other spices to completely melt in your mouth upon consumption.  It is actually, of all side items on their menu, their standout in my opinion.  Their portions are huge - they should be given the price you will pay for your lunch but I promise, IT IS WORTH IT.

My wife ordered snow pea leaves, combination fried rice, and sesame chicken.

The music was blaring so loudly that a girl in our party started to cry because her ears hurt so bad. We asked the waitress to be moved. She responded with \\"I can't hear you.\\" She finally figured out what we were asking and said the place was completely reserved. The bride was upset because aside from it being painful to sit, we also couldn't even attempt to speak with one another. I spoke to a woman at the front who said the manager would speak with the band to turn down the speaker when they took a break. They moved a speaker sideways to \\"fix the issue.\\" It wasn't any better. We asked to be moved again. The waitress kept trying to take our order instead.\\n\\nFinally the manager came over, and our bride had to throw a fit to get  us moved. Finally, we were moved much farther away, yet we STILL had to yell in order to hear one another. I haven't ever been to a concert or anything this loud...ever. It was unnerving to be that uncomfortable. \\n\\nOne of the women in our group is an orchestra teacher, and the decibel app on her phone showed that at our new table, the decibel level was nearing 100 (this was now 100 feet away from the speaker). Our original table was at a much higher level, which causes damage to the ears after only minutes. \\n\\nOur waitress apologized for not being able to successfully tour guide the menu because \\"it's very loud in here.\\" She tried, and we couldn't hear her. She told us that 2-3 tapas were appropriate per person because the tapas were \\"very small.\\" They didn't end up being that small, and we ended up with a third of our order left over, and we couldn't take it with us because we were going out afterwards. There was also no organization with the tapas: some girls received all three tapas at once while I didn't get my tapas (the only one I ordered) until nearly everyone else was done (15-20 minutes after the rest of the food came out). \\n\\nOur waitress was very nice, and the food was okay. No one in our group was super impressed with the food, but there was nothing offensive about any of the dishes other than noticing that most of the orders were quite greasy. \\n\\n\\nThe flamenco dancers and the band were excellent with the exception of having a venue that a) didn't need a speaker b) has an inappropriately placed stage and c) is not an acoustically equipped place.\\n\\nI served tables for 7 years, and one of our party members manages a fine dining restaurant.

My husband and I almost always split the whole rack of ribs, which is a huge portion (it also comes with your choice side and salad) at a very good price - and they are the best ribs I've had in a restaurant. If you think Red Bones is good, well it's not, go to Rasos. I've also had their steak tips (again, very well cooked), pizza (good, but not why we chose to go there), zucchini & eggplant terrine (also very, very good), and like I mentioned before their martinis are amazing. The last time we were there they had a fig, mozzarella, prosciutto appetizer - it was to die for! - and we learned they made their own mozzarella cheese!  Lastly, the service here is very phenomenal.

The bartender uses all sorts of cool purees and traditional methods to make cocktails.

Live it up, you'll thank me.\\n\\nThe roast pork was OK but I would not get it again.  The skin, which is supposed to be crispy, was too tough.  They gave me a bunch of burnt/meatless parts too which only added to the weight of the container and my trash can.  Boyfriend and I loved the bbq pork, though.  With the leftovers, I cut it up and make fried rice with it.  Super delicious.  The bbq pork reminds me of the bbq pork I'd get at home, in San Francisco.\\n\\nThe wait was a bit long, and the guys who cut the meat have other responsibilities in the restaurant aside from cutting the roasted items, so they aren't particularly good at it.

I'm an expat Texan. I'm also a vegetarian (yes, I know). I am regularly homesick for Southern food - especially barbeque - and unable to eat it when I can find it, as most traditional recipes include ham hock or pork. So when I saw how veggie-friendly the menu was at Smokin Betty's I actually squealed aloud. This place is being done by the same people as Gulu Gulu, another of my favorite spots in town, and it has the same comfortable, chill, all-ages vibe. The music was perfect (old country, Nina Simone). The service was thoughtful and attentive. They're in a soft opening, so they're still experimenting with the menu, and the team will tighten up with time. It's new. Go with it. \\n\\nWhat I had: the shared grilled seitan platter for two, with cornbread, collards, mac and cheese, and fried green tomatoes. The fried green tomatoes were perfect. I mean, PERFECT. The collards were amazing (without ham! How is that possible?). The cornbread was almost as good as mine (not their fault - they don't have my grandmother's iron skillet from 1945). If they added some cheese on top and ran it under the broiler for a nice crust, the mac would be almost perfect, too. \\n\\nWhat I also had: a mint julep. It came in a camp cup and was fantastic. Friends had pulled pork and pronounced it delicious, ditto the Sazerac.\\n\\nWe did leave some menu suggestions on the comment cards (black eyed peas needed salt and to be hot, at the end of the day), but overall my husband and I have decided we're moving in.\\n\\nA word on picnic tables: it's not a pretentious gesture.

The small space is lined with long picnic tables and has very little in terms of decor. I was definitely suspicious. However, the food changed all of that.  \\n\\nThere is generally one waiter working the tables and a couple cooks in the kitchen. The entire restaurant is an open plan design so you can see the chefs preparing everyone's food in the back, which is actually pretty cool. My friends and I ordered a couple appetizers, and as soon as they hit the table we were in love. The preparation of the food leaves something to be desired, but the flavor is out of this world. \\n\\nFor my entree I ordered the squid ink pasta in the aglio olio style. While aglio olio is pretty standard fare, the Daily Catch aglio olio is an entirely different beast. The pasta itself was an unusual but very welcome texture, albeit a hideous color. The flavor of the pasta alone, however, was amazing. The unique quality of the pasta and the great blend of flavors from the sauce made for an amazing meal. \\n\\nUnfortunately, this place, given its small size, does not offer reservations. The staff is friendly but nothing to rave about. If you head over a bit earlier, you'll almost certainly get a table, but the wait for this place gets very long very fast. If you are in the mood for good seafood, you need to check out the Daily Catch."},{"name":"Life Alive","address":"765 Mass Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4.5","text":"Amazing food.

However, all it takes is a wink from a dapper man in my life and well I'll try anything. That and of course useful reviews from fellow yelpers ::wink::\\n\\nSo dapper man and I brave the Thursday night crowd and head for the bar seats to get our grub on and boy was it grubbin'.

Well, that my friends was:\\n\\nKhanom Jiin Naam Ngiaw \\nNorthern Thai thin rice vermicelli topped with a brothy \\"curry\\" of pork ribs, minced beef, tomatoes, bean sprouts and pickled mustard greens, spiced with dried Thai chilies, herbs and aromatics. \\n\\nI wish I could tell you how great it was, but he literally \\"hogged\\" the entire dish sparing me just a piece of the pork rib--but that was delicious.\\n\\nWe also ordered:\\n\\nMuu Sateh\\nCarlton Farms pork loin skewers marinated in coconut milk and turmeric, grilled over charcoal and served with peanut sauce, cucumber relish and grilled bread. Yes, bread really is the normal accompaniment.\\n\\nThe relish is amazing. I could have eaten it all night.

The pork skewers were pretty good when added to the relish.\\n\\nand of course the Fish Sauce Wings (not ordered spicy, because I am a bit of a spice wuss on occasion). These, oh man.

It's got wonderful coffee, delicious food, a cozy feel, and a fun, bookish vibe.\\n\\nWhether you get it hot or iced, the standard drip coffee is phenomenal here. They usually offer a variety of beans, too, if you order it hot. Most recently, I had an iced coffee here that had just the perfect acidity to make it refreshing on a hot morning. I normally put sugar in iced coffee, but this one didn't need it at all. Likewise, in cold weather, their hot drip coffee is a fine pick-me-up, and needs no adornments.\\n\\nThe Rocking Frog is good for brunch and lunch as well as just coffee. My sandwich, the Hemingway, had ham, scrambled eggs, and maple cream cheese on it, and was served piping hot on crusty Italian bread. Delicious. The ham had just the right amount of salt and smoke to it, while the eggs were light and fluffy. The maple cream cheese was rich, but only slightly sweet, imparting a subtle maple flavor that played well with the ham. Definitely a balanced sandwich, as well as delicious. \\n\\nThe doughnuts here are incredible! Always cooked on the spot, they come out of the fryer bursting with flavor, yet not at all greasy. I'd recommend the vanilla highest of all, but they're all good.\\n\\nAnother thing I love about the Rocking Frog is its atmosphere. It's definitely literary, but not at all pretentious. The sandwiches are named for famous authors and there are numerous books to peruse, and the comfy chairs are perfect for hanging out on a cold winter's day with a book or magazine. I love the worn-in feel to the place, noticeable in its comfortable furniture, its old hardwood floors, and its many nooks. It's very easy to lose track of time and wind up spending hours just hanging out here, noshing on coffee and doughnuts and enjoying the vibe.\\n\\nWith its combination of great food, great drinks, and great atmosphere, the Rocking Frog is definitely a great place.

My favorite is our new luggage tags shaped as the most adorable fox you've ever seen. They also have these funky socks - my favorite featuring a brontosaurus that is wearing 80's red-stripe socks.

But once you get over yourself and succumb to your friend's whims, Mad Mex is truly the gem of an otherwise  obnoxiously tacky area.\\n\\nLike I said, the accouterments here are without a doubt the bright idea of some marketing exec from somewhere in Connecticut who may or may not have ever been to Mexico, but you have to give the place credit for the intricacy. They could have gone the Applebee's route by slathering the walls in a tacky mixture of local flare and generic, prepackaged memorabilia, but instead the walls are covered in painstakingly detailed murals of what could be best described as a bovine cocktail as seen through the eyes of Hunter S. Thompson. You have to see it to believe it.  The lighting is always mellow, and the music is an unobtrusive mix of piped in rock standards that are more or less an afterthought in relation to the overall Mad Mex experience. I'll take satellite radio alt-rock over a loop of Mariachi music any day.\\n\\nMad Mex is a restaurant, after all, so on to that. The first thing I tried here was a Mad Mex chicken burrito, which was underwhelming at best. It was filling and came with a side of waffle fries, but the verdict is simple: it's no Chipotle, and that's that. With that being said, almost everything else on the menu is worth trying. The Los Wingos wrap (cheeky, indeed) is a pretty simple spin on a bar food standard: boneless wings slathered in any sauce of your choosing and wrapped up with lettuce and tomato. I was dually impressed with the enchiladas, which are covered in a gooey mess of cheese and sauce that's impossible to take on in one sitting. As an added bonus, most of the items on the menu are easily convertible to vegetarian and are just as good in most cases. \\n\\nMad Mex originally set out to operate as a restaurant, but it became harder and harder to kick out the large number of students that came after-hours in search of refuge from the overcrowded bars like McFadden's and Ugly Tuna that are located within a stones throw. With such an impressive draft selection and modest prices during happy hour, it's hard to blame them. If you're looking for a great place to post up at a booth with a large group of friends and put down pitcher after pitcher of margaritas or specialty beers (with an ever-changing selection to boot), Mad Mex simply cannot be beat. \\n\\nAll in all, the food here is better described as \\"Mexifornian\\" with it's Americanized slant on Mexican classics, but they do quite well at it and deserve no fault. Although Mad Mex falters slightly with simple things like burritos and salsa, the rest of the menu is extensive and creative enough that it's not hard to let it slide. With a selected half-off menu from 2-4 Monday through Thursday, you'd be crazy to not even try the place once. So if it's decent food and, more importantly, a top notch place to relax with friends over a pint or two, Mad Mex simply cannot be beat."},{"name":"Slappy Cakes","address":"4246 SE Belmont St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Slappy Cakes isn't breakfast, it's an event.

Everything from their complimentary side of biscuits to main dish, I was very content with their quality.\\n\\nI highly recommend making a reservation a good day or two prior to your visit. I went to ICOB on a Friday night at 7pm without reservation. When I tried reserving  online, they said nothing was available until 9:30pm. Call it lucky, but my friends and I went anyway as a walk-in and we were seated immediately upon arrival. \\n\\nOysters were definitely of top notch quality. As you walk in towards the center of the restaurant, you can see all kinds of oysters arranged in stacks on mountains of ice. One thing that ICOB doesn't do (whereas Neptune Oyster does) is that theere are no specific descriptions for the oysters. I suggest that you ask a waiter/waitress whether you want them very salty/not, citrusy, nutty, etc. \\n\\nOverall, they are fresh, flavorful, and pleasantly tangy. My favorites are Island Creek and Hama Hama (both not too salty). The presentation makes it easier to figure out what kind you are trying. (they give you individual slips with your orders arranged very carefully :) My favorite thing at this entire restaurant is one of their dips for the oysters, so be sure to look out for it!  \\n\\nWhen it comes to drinks, I like having rose or white wine with seafood. I ordered a bottle of rose (CH√ÇTEAU L'EPERONNI√àRE ROS√â DE LOIRE) for the table. This place also makes other drinks that they update daily.\\n\\nI opted for a simple, less pricey entree: Fried Fish Sandwich. The fried fish just melted in my mouth. You really got nothing to lose...\\n\\nThe service was awesome. We had a waiter who even found out the name of the track they were playing (Ray Charles's I've Got A Woman, FYI) when he saw me searching for it. You'd expect place with such acclaims and recognition would give you a rather disappointing service but ICOB definitely definitely should be proud of very friendly and helpful staff.\\n\\nGreat atmosphere.

Then, when we opened our menus (which ICOB prints daily due to specials, changed and adjustments), we were delighted to find that \\"Happy Birthday Lauren!\\" was printed on our menus. Another nice touch - she immediately stashed a copy of the menu in her purse.\\n\\nWe're both red-wine fans, and our server did a great job helping us pick a bottle of red that would go well with the seafood we were planning on eating. We started with a variety of different types of oysters. The staff made sure we knew which were which, and where they were from. All wonderfully delicious and served with every condiment you can imagine, including the classic mignonette and cocktail sauce. \\n\\nMy girlfriend had the lobster roe noodes which were terrific.

My honest opinion so far is that the Galbi is better than the Bugolgi, but I don't know what the best choice there would be yet as I have only gone twice.

I thought it was a nice touch to make the potatoes sweet potatoes with soy sauce, but I still like original potatoes better. The miso soup served with the meal was good, but I would prefer if it was less salty. Still good though. The main dishes were excellent,but my only advice would be to make the Bugolgi more flavorful. Don't get me wrong it is good, but I think it needs more flavor. My only gripe with this place and the reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I am very picky about this, but I drink a lot of water when I go out and would like a refill when the drink is empty, and this did not happen the entire time I was there and left the last time I had gone.

Heck, with enough $4 house wine on the happy hour menu, you might feel warm enough to try on a couple pairs of jeans.  The happy hour menu is pretty okay.  The pork sliders with sweet potato fries for $4, an antelope burger for $6, and a big beef tenderloin blue cheese salad for $10...  Walked out of there tipsy and full for $25.

Even planned & successfully showed up near opening in order to hope to get in the first seating. \\n\\n'Cause this is some good ramen! While I did try the plain Shoyu I've decided to stick to the Garlic Tonkotsu because it's just leaps and bounds better than other ramens I've tried. Super rich broth with a kick of garlic, pork & a seasoned hardboiled egg. The pork tends to be too fatty to eat it all but the egg is marvelous. \\n\\nService is definitely a hit or miss, but never too annoying. They've been perfecting their wait system, which now includes getting a text message so you can wander around the shopping center instead of being smooshed in their small waiting area. Biggest annoyance so far has been getting appetizers AFTER ramen, which was weird.

It's my favorite and most substantial meal of the day, so I'm always looking for great lunch spots in the neighborhood.

The food was pretty good, flavor-wise.   \\n\\nThe BIG downsides were in the service and the value.   \\n\\nI started by ordering the iced green tea on tap, which I later realized was $4.25 (yikes).   I ordered light on the ice (sensitivity to cold) and it came filled to the top of the glass with ice. \\nWhen I sent it back and repeated my order (and explained why), our server was short and came back with a three-quarters full glass of tea for me.   I ordered a black bean and quinoa burger and my partner had the lentil soup and we shared.  I requested a side of avocado on the burger.  The flavor of the burger was great, although the texture and consistency was off... it wasn't actually a burger at all, more like a mushy oatmeal-like consistency.   It was impossible to cut in half to split without destroying it.    I asked for avocado on the sandwich, and I'm not exaggerating when I say that it came with a paper-thin schmear of avocado (which was an additional cost of $2).    I couldn't even taste it.     The sandwich came with an unmemorable side salad, and lettuce tomato, and pickles and cost me $16 dollars.   \\n\\nWe then waited quite a bit for the check, although the waitstaff were just standing around and it wasn't at all crowded at 2:30 on a weekday afternoon.  I can forgive a bit of a wait when the staff are hustling and it's busy.    \\n\\nI should say that the lentil soup was delicious, and was average-priced.  \\n\\nAll in all, though, save your money and go somewhere where you get what you pay for.

Absolutely fabulous!  I will say, as reported, it is a little dark and noisy but what makes this restaurant special is the way they elevate the old school concept of steak to another level.  The  nuances such as crab fritters and steak carpaccio are upscale current restaurant fare, but  the steak is still good ole fashioned properly done, well aged, tender, unadulterated streak.\\nStarted with drinks and lobster fritters.  Good start.  Went straight for the steak for two with the add on of a lobster shrimp topping.  The steak comes out sliced which I really liked and had a huge bone.  It was cooked perfectly in au jus. The plate is then tilted so that you can cut your steak and dip it in the au jus.  What a outstanding touch! Superb.  The flavor of the steak is like nothing I have ever had.  Yes I said it.  it was just that good.  Just perfection. \\nNow if that was not good enough the topping was a mixture of sweet lobster meat with shrimp and a complex sauce with cilantro with a little heat that we just could not believe how good it was.  I am not sure if this side was just a special for the night but I would come back just to eat that.  Again, this is the nuance that Kevin Rathburn provides that no other steak house in Atlanta I have found does.

I ordered the same crispy taco and there was so much grease that we kept laughing about it.  I asked 3 times for extra paper napkins to sop it up and wipe my hands.  The queso was great, and my buddy's puffy taco was similar to the previous location.

Last Saturday morning we sat at the bar on the tail end of the entire restaurant having just been sat.  I knew the food would take awhile, but it took A REALLY LONG TIME (close to 45 min in the end).  The situation was saved because not only our server, but another server, kept checking on us, filling my coffee, apologizing for the delay and generally being very pleasant even though everyone working had that look of petrified gloom that overtakes a place when everybody knows they are hopelessly \\"in the weeds\\" for the next four hours solid.  They could have been surly and ignored us.  Instead they comped our entire meal without us complaining once, and asked for honest feedback, which we gave. They really want to do better, which gives me hope for the future. \\n\\nSitting at the counter afforded us an inside view.  The grill is way too small for the volume of business, as is the area for plating and organizing orders.  Until they get a bigger grill, the food times are likely to be LONG when the place is busy.  I think they underestimated how many people wouldn't order the \\"cook it yourself\\" pancakes.   \\n\\nI had the corned beef hash, which I wouldn't order again.

The line moved somewhat slowly considering each person was only ordering one or two things, but not so slowly that I would feel compelled to leave. After ordering though, I sat and waited over 20 minutes for my wrap, which then came to me squashed into a tiny cardboard box. \\n\\nDuring that wait, I had plenty of time to really scope the place out. Behind the counter, the prep areas were packed even more tightly than my wrap. There appeared to be about 8 or 9 people packed into that small space at any given time, with waitstaff wandering in and out... one of whom had long and messy hair with no hair net. You're handling people's meals, AND running back and forth into tiny prep areas with ratty hair hanging out all around your face... I'm guessing that more than a few hairs make it into the food. \\n\\nFurthermore, near the door was a large, uncovered container with peanut butter in it, which (along with the customers waiting toward the back of the line) was frequently splashed as one of the guys making smoothies washed carrots (and then used blender jars) in the sink that couldn't have been 2 feet away. I didn't actually see them use that peanut butter in a smoothie, but I am sure they are. \\n\\nThe sandwich itself was quite tasty, but could have benefited from less cramped packaging. The broccoli and tomatoes tasted fresh and the cheese was suitably cheddary, and the wheat wrap was... well... a wheat wrap is always a wheat wrap, isn't it? \\n\\nWhile the food tasted good, the questionable sanitation in the prep areas exacerbated by the in and out of  the waiter with the wild mane- plus the ridiculous wait time- have pretty much guaranteed I won't be back.

We were so excited."},{"name":"The Nook On Piedmont Park","address":"1144 Piedmont Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"I've had three very different experiences with The Nook.  The first:  I met my family here for brunch.  Our server was indifferent and pretty slow.  I ordered the Peachtree grilled chicken sandwich with fruit.  If I remember correctly, the honey mustard on the sandwich is made in-house, and it was amazing.  My cousin ordered the Redneck totchos, which I tried.  Pretty good, but I think he was expecting better.  My uncle ordered the shrimp and grits stuffed burger and really enjoyed it!  Everyone seemed pleased with their food, just not the service.  My second encounter occurred at the Battle of the Burgers event in October.  The Nook featured a mac and cheese stuffed burger.  It was pretty good.  We chatted with the people working the booth, and our server from my first visit to The Nook was actually working.  He was much nicer this time.  They were even handing out discount coupons.  My third experience was this past Sunday for brunch with two of my girlfriends.  This was the best of the three.  I ordered the classic burger (big surprise) and a side of tater tots.  The burger was a bit overcooked, so it was dry.  There didn't seem to be anything special about it.  My friends ordered the two egg breakfast and the breakfast sandwich.  They said it was good, not great.  The service was much better this time.  For a Sunday at 11:00, we expected the place to be packed, but there were probably only about four other tables in the restaurant.  They also offer $15 bottomless Mimosas on Sundays.  I would like to return for these and warmer weather, so we can sit outside.  One complaint:  they have extremely awkwardly placed $2 valet.  It has caused confusion both of the times I've visited.  My favorite part about The Nook is the set up.  There are skylights throughout the restaurant, which make it feel fancier than it really is.  They also have strategically placed decorative pillows along the wooden benches.  You really feel like you're in a little nook, like in a grownup tree house."},{"name":"Don Asado","address":"18385 SW Alexander St","city":"Aloha","stars":"4.5","text":"Really friendly staff and great food!!

WORTH IT! The lettuce was crisp and green, the chicken was lean and moist, and the charred corn was just wonderful (I will ask for more, in the future!). \\n\\nI understand that this restaurant is still a bit new - and I look forward to seeing them live up to their potential.

I've only had 1 dessert but it was delicious and don't be scared off if your dessert contains mushroom ice cream (way better than it sounds!)...  I considered a 4 star review because this is not one of my favorite places to go due to price - if you're getting 2 drinks, an entr√©e, and splitting appetizer and dessert and tipping 20% you're looking at $60/pp at a minimum.

Actually, sometimes there are free refills, and sometimes you can bring in outside food and drink. But sometimes you can't. Which brings me to my biggest issue...\\n\\n- The management policies are very inconsistent and not well articulated. Rules seem to vary depending on who is working, and signage is poor. I am uncomfortable when I don't know how an establishment works and I don't always want to have to ask, to risk breaking the rules, or to miss out on something because I didn't know how it worked. \\n\\nA clear example of this is that I showed up today at noon to settle in for an afternoon of board games on my day off.
