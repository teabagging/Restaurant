There's so many I'm sure you can find one with flavors you enjoy.\\nThe basil fried chicken is SO GOOD!!! A little pricey at $5 for a cup of what is essentially chicken nuggets, but this isn't your average frozen chicken nuggets you'll find in your grocery store or fast food restaurant. Pick it up at the counter pipin' hot and super crisp. An excellent basil flavor with a slight peppery kick too.

On the wall they list a variety of pizza base options.  I went with the \\"Dillon James\\" and added mushrooms, salami, and spicy sausage.  Pretty darn delicious and given the thin style crust, the cook time of the pizza doesn't take long at all.

SOOO happy to have found this pop-up. I hear it's been going on now for 17 months.\\n\\nWe had a very slight wait, but I love everything about how homey this place feels. They encourage to play games, color, read a book while you wait. Also, when the wait gets long (which it does even when you're seated), they bring little snacks! I had a mini blueberry muffin which was still warm while in the waiting area. When we were seated after ordering, they brought a birthday cake thing - I don't know how to describe it except it was like a sweet hush puppy or something with a nutella dip.\\n\\nThe menu is prix-fixe so I wasn't quite sure what to expect, but it's genius: 1 beverage, 1 savory dish, and 1 sweet. All of that for $22. It makes sense because whenever I have brunch, I can't decide if I want something savory or sweet. With the portions they do here, it's perfect because you get a little bit of everything, served on a tray.\\n\\nI ordered coffee, bacon and gruyere dutch baby pancake and a carrot cake waffle. Amazing. The dutch baby pancake was airy and served with lemony-dressed greens. I might be biased because gruyere is one of my favorite cheeses and you could definitely taste it along with the bacon which is baked into this little pancake. I felt healthy for having the greens. I couldn't wait to get into the carrot cake waffle. Again, perfect portions. It's slightly more on the sweet side but a great pairing with whatever you choose for your savory dish.\\n\\nLoved the experience here. Takes a bit of time, so it's definitely something to do at your leisure. Definitely one of my most memorable meals on my latest trip to Portland."},{"name":"Lupo","address":"869 Hamilton Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4.5","text":"When you walk into Lupo, it is literally like walking into someone's house. In my opinion this kind of takes away from the ambiance of a classy restaurant. The service seemed a little disorganized as well, with more than one person asking if we had been helped yet while we were waiting to be seated and more than one person asking if we had had our drink order taken. Our server was however very nice. \\n\\nThey have an extensive wine list but other than that there isn't much selection in terms of non alcoholic drinks - only soda. \\n\\nWe ordered the black tagliatelle, the Wagyu carpaccio and the special of the day, a bone in veal chop. I typically don't like beef carpaccio but this one was excellent. It was salted just enough and the combination of the meat, arugula, cheese and artichoke went so well together. Highly recommend this dish! \\n\\nThe bone-in veal, which we ordered medium rare, was extremely tender and slightly fatty. It tasted almost like a very soft pork. This was very good, and a fair size as well. The mushrooms were also delicious. They also served some vegetables on the side but those were pretty standard. \\n\\nMy least favourite dish was the tagliatelle. The portion of pasta was pretty generous and I couldn't finish the whole thing. It was cooked al dente, but I didn't find the flavours to be anything special. The jalape√±o gave it the slightest amount of heat, but I didn't find the little pieces of it in the sauce very enjoyable to eat. The seafood was okay but didn't seem to have much flavour. I personally wouldn't recommend this dish. \\n\\nOverall, this is a good restaurant if you enjoy wine and well-cooked food, but not if you're looking for the atmosphere of a high end restaurant."},{"name":"la Barbecue","address":"2027 E Cesar Chavez St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Thebestbarbecue EVER I did my own little bbq tour and this is the best in Austin and Lockhart, Texas.\\n\\nWe ordered the beef rib, pork ribs, brisket, coleslaw and Mac n cheese. \\n\\nBeef rib was delicious!

It's still a little salty, but not as bad as Terry Black's.\\n\\nPork ribs are smaller, but the dry rub they used is so good!  Perfectly seasoned.\\n\\nThe brisket omg....THE BRISKET THOUGH!!!!! Just order it. Trust me. I'm Yelp elite. You can cut it with your fork! It actually even broke itself in had when trying to stage my plate!

They have a little of everything on their menu including fresh juice and smoothies and heavier stuff for boozy folks. I liked them so much I've been back recently and ordered Togo.

Went here a few times my Junior Year of college and absolutely loved the place. Boasted about it each time to my friends and family- so much so that I decided to take them there for my post-graduation lunch recently. Last minute my brother was able to make his flight and attend as well, so I tried to change my reservation from 4 people to 5. The restaurant was practically empty when we went, only two families eating in. I informed the hostess about my situation, and not only was she unhelpful she was highly rude and degrading. She told me the restaurant was small and couldn't accommodate last minute changes, which I do understand, but her tone and demeanor was insulting. I was wearing my graduation gown and was with my parents and siblings visiting me from 8,000 miles away- but she didn't seem to care or even try to offer a solution or an apology. I didn't want to cause a scene and she ruined half my appetite, so we left.  We ended up going to Strega down the street, a really hip Italian mafia-themed restaurant where the service was top-class and where they told me that they would absolutely add another chair to our table because they would never \\"turn away a girl on her graduation day\\".

She showed me to my table and when we asked if we could fit another seat on the table because we were FINE with sharing the extra space, she refused and said it would not be possible adding another chair there so please get your facts straight. And i'm well aware it was Mother's Day as I was with my own mother, hoping to show her a good time and a good meal.  Both of which I managed to receive down the street. \\nAgain, like I said in my earlier comment, she could have been a little more courteous and it was not the fact that we had to leave but how we ended up leaving that tainted my experience.

It was so cold that we couldn't even enjoy our food...which in itself wasn't that impressive to begin with. \\n\\nI got a simple cheeseburger with bacon tots. I was expecting tater tots but they were more like deep fried hash brown bits with bacon. The description sounds delicious but they were not very good at all.

It's not the cleanest restaurant, but what do you expect from Chinatown?\\n\\nI am extremely sensitive to certain MSG depending on how much they put it in (it makes me feel bloated and really out-of-it) and New Golden Gate definitely overpowers it.

Called National Carpet Care on 1/15/19 and was greeted by the same rude staff member from before. He did not allow me to provide my contract number (again barking at me to give him my name).

How could I when the first call lasted 1 minute? \\nWhen I did not remember the date of service but had my contract number readily available, he suggested I \\"call back when I remember\\" and immediately dismissed me and saying he was not going to listen to my complaint because it was 3 months after the service date.

But Vancouver humans, I am here to tell you: Good Earth is indeed the elusive, perfect coffee shop.\\n\\nLet's begin with the space itself: It's bright and spacious, with tons of seating in different configurations. Need a table for a meeting? It's easy to find space for four or five people, or for a larger group at the big high-top. Like an easy chair or a cosy banquette? No problem. If you like a firm desk chair, or a high chair, or even a tall bar where you can stand and work -- well, Good Earth offers all of the above.\\n\\nNow, maybe you actually care about the coffee at your coffee shop. The coffee here is EXCELLENT. I never put anything in my coffee, because I actually like coffee, so I can tell you that the Americanos here are the real deal. But if you're the kind of person who likes to crap up your beverage with flavored syrups, milk, and whipped cream, until you're drinking something that is more milkshake than coffee, well, you'll have all those options too. \\n\\nEven more remarkable, Good Earth has a truly excellent assortment of food. I'm an extreme low-carber, which makes me just about impossible to feed, but miraculously, there are some good options for me. (I love their Tuscan tuna salad, and their egg bites make a good snack, too.) For normal humans who can eat exotic carbs like quinoa or corn or even actual cookies, there's a very wide range of salads, sandwiches, soups and goodies that I just have to pretend don't exist, even though all I want in life is the delicious-looking \\"honey lemon squish\\" sandwich cookies that sit by the cash register -- I'm telling you, the day I return to carbs I will be in here eating half a dozen of those things.\\n\\nGood Earth also wins full marks for a few logistical advantages that leave most other coffee shops in the dust. There are plenty of power outlets, setup with USB as well as standard 3-prong plugs. The wifi works well and consistently. There are five free parking spots located underground, and it's very easy to find street parking too. And unlike the many many coffee shops that use disgusting keys to protect their disgusting bathrooms, Good Earth has keyless bathrooms that are actually clean!\\n\\nThe only downside to Good Earth is also its upside: Because it has giant windows on two sides of the room, it's very bright, but also very susceptible to temperature swings. I actually bought a pair of sheepskin boots this winter because my toes were getting cold on the concrete floor, but I couldn't imagine working elsewhere! And now that we're getting into summer, I've found it a bit warm on the warmest days. \\n\\nBut what really makes Good Earth so special is the very warm (but unobtrusive) husband-and-wife team who run the shop, and they're very responsive to my temperature concerns. (If it's getting warm, just ask to open the back door so there's a cross-breeze.) Both the owners and the staff are consistently friendly, helpful, and accommodating.\\n\\nNo wonder Good Earth has so many devoted regulars! I've camped out at many different coffee shops over the years, but I can't think of anyplace I've worked that has so many customers who come in day after day. I'm guessing that like me, they've realized that Good Earth truly is that most elusive of businesses: the perfect coffee shop."},{"name":"El Naranjo","address":"85 Rainey St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"If you want authentic Mexican food and you know what that taste like then this is your place!!!

We came for a graduation dinner, and we had something like... 12 people, so we ordered a ton of dishes, including clams with glass noodles, scallop and egg fried rice, soft shell crab, two orders of lobster with ginger, steamed fish, plain noodles, various different kinds of vegetable... along with red bean soup (i actually don't know the technical name for this dish) for dessert.\\n\\nalmost everything was amazing, but the best thing from this place was definitely the lobster, which was probably some of the best lobster ive had prepared in chinese style. the great thing about the preparation of this lobster was that they've cracked open the lobster in all the perfect places, so getting the meat out of the shell was a breeze, even for someone like me who typically hates having to work for the food. the clams with glass noodles were also excellent\\n\\ni want to give five stars, but i didn't wind up paying for dinner, so I really can't evaluate what this place was like on a value basis... but simply from the food, i can say that it was a solid four star.\\n\\nthe service, I will note, could use a little bit of work. we were trying quite desperately to get water for a long while, and due to the nature of our seats in the house, we got no attention for something like 20 minutes.."},{"name":"Rosa Mexicano","address":"155 Seaport Blvd","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"Stopped in after a few cultural stops in the Seaport neighborhood a bit late.  Seemed to be the only restaurant in the area that had an opening (?)  on a Thursday night for 7-8 people.  And let me tell you they had openings - place was pretty sparse of humans.\\n\\nService - a bit hit or miss.  At one point wondered if the waiter spoke English as dishes were ordered and some came to the table more than a bit different.  Spanish would have worked as many in our group speak it but he didn't seem to speak that either...Portuguese? \\n\\nAppetizers - went chips, salsa, guacamole and empanadas.  Chips good, salsa good, guac just OK, empanadas just OK.  Nothing to rave about here. \\n\\nMeal - Three different Enchiladas as a special - Meh.  Fair portion size, somewhat tasteless, lacking some sauce / greenery in presentation.  Good but most small Mom & Pop taquerias for a steep fraction of the price would blow these out of the water.\\n\\nDrinks - Now here we go.  Had a couple of the traditional Margaritas and afterwards I asked my wife if she thought they were virgin Margaritas because there was zero taste of tequila and certainly there was no buzz - even a hint of a buzz.  I think I'd like to sit at the bar and see how they're making these.  If you get one of these I'd send it back.\\n\\nAll-in-all it's the location and being able to sit outside.  Food & drink won't win any awards but the decor and location will.  By no means do the prices justify what you get.  So if you're in the 'hood it's not a terrible spot, if you want real tastes of mexican food find a Mom & Pop place that delivers a heavy pour."},{"name":"Tamo Bistro & Bar","address":"1 Seaport Ln","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"I have been to Tamo 3 times over the years and each year time my opinion remains the same. All 3 times the reason I went was by default, surrounding restaurants had a very long wait. Tamo was about 1/2 full. This was pre concert, peak time after work and we were hungry. On an up note, the place has a nice vibe and is decorated lovely, upscale bistro chic. I was looking forward to some hearty bistro food. What we got was overpriced mediocre food, very limited upscale bistro food menu options. Slow service. Mediocre overpriced cocktails. I honestly don't think it's the waitstaff fault but more a reflection on the restaurant as a whole. Note, They add in a 18% tip automatically to the bill and in my opinion it's obvious why. They should also tell their patrons this upfront OR bodily print it on the menu. (If it was noted, it was not obvious). I did not know until I was handed the bill and told by the waiter. Lesson finally learned, the next time in Seaport, I will book ahead at a better restaurant, Seaport is surrounded with options, and walk on by Tamo. I am giving this place 2 stars instead of 1 star only because the food was served piping hot, so it does appear it was cooked to order."},{"name":"Steveston Seafood House","address":"3951 Moncton Street","city":"Richmond","stars":"4","text":"It was a different kind of Christmas this year for me and my mother.

Moving along, the score was \\"83\\", the owner kept saying 86, until i corrected him, then he took another look. He resisted me holding the report my self, pulling away when i attempted to read what the violations were. Then he flipped back pages to show me ( as if proud) the previous score was 93 and the one before that 95. So i said you're going down, what you getting tired?

Inside the veggie was spinach, tomatoes, peppers, onions mushroom and your choice of  swiss, american, cheddar or feta.  I chose Cheddar.  The omelet flavor was pretty good!  Presentation was about as good as a take home plate can be, but it's all about the flavor here.  \\n\\nThe omelet came with a biscuit or toast (got a biscuit) and grits or hash browns (I got grits).  The grits were nothing special, and while the biscuit was buttered, it also wasn't anything special.\\n\\nI didn't try any of the other food, but I was told it was good.  The coffee was respectable.\\n\\nWhile the parking lot is decently sized, again, it was slammed this morning, having maybe 2 out of 20 spots or so remaining.

I had informed the wait staff that I was allergic of coconut and due to this or not many coconut free options For dessert. I opted for a brownie which I asked to be warmed. When the brownie was served to me it was partially warmed but mostly cold and stale. The brownie broke apart in pieces and I had no stability and a grainy texture. I am not sure what the cause of the texture was, perhaps it is a due the vegan ingredients I do not know. The taste was OK it was subtly sweet,But mostly bitter. Because I am not vegan or vegetarian it is not a necessity that I patronize establishment but if the service had been up to par I would have considered it to be an option among other bakeries in restaurants that I visit in the Cambridge area.

Our food arrived sooner than expected, and when we picked it up, we were told the milkshakes were in the works. About two-thirds through the meal, I walked up and asked about the shakes. The young lady was very apologetic explaining she was trying to get them made, but there had been many shake orders. When we finished our meal, the shakes had still not been made. We asked for a refund for the shakes, and the young lady was extremely apologetic and provided a refund without question.

I kind of knew from other reviews what to expect and I'm pleased to say it was very good.\\n\\nIt's very clean, charming, and inviting.\\n\\nIf you are used to American or more westernized bakeries, you'll quickly see this is different. It's not a colorful frosting and sprinkles kind of place; rather, the pastries are not overly sweet. There is a huge assortment here from sweet to savory. I veered more toward the sweet end as I'd just had a light lunch, but next time I'd like to try something more savory. Just grab a tray and tongs and choose from the various \\"cubbies\\" of pastries.\\n\\nI split a few with a friend so we could try a little of a few kinds. The A-GE cinnamon pan ($1.40) was light and soft, visually similar to a maple bar in size and style but coated in cinnamon sugar instead. It was very good but this batch tasted a bit of oil. There were some lighter-colored ones in the cubby so this may have been a more well-done batch. We weren't as happy with the custard cream pan; it was good, but without the sweetness we're more used to it seemed to lack a little something. It sort of treads that space between savory and sweet and ended up a bit bland. It was also the most expensive that we tried, at $3.25.\\n\\nThe highlight was the choco hat croissant. It's a round croissant that looks like a little mountain, or hat as per it's name. The croissant was light, soft, and crisp; there is a bit of dark, bittersweet chocolate filling, and it's topped with either powdered sugar or chocolate stripes. This was simple and delicious, and at $1.90 a nice little afternoon treat.\\n\\nAs mentioned, there are many savory choices too as well as a 'grab and go' section with a few premade sandwiches and drinks.

It actually was pretty tasty. I just had to get past the fact that the \\"chicken\\" texture felt more like I was eating a pigs ear... the actual noodle part was good.\\n\\n........ Really wanted to find a good Chinese place in the area. There's one but it's very speedy for just wanting some good Chinese take-out. This place is yuck and over priced.

When Rishi first opened it was clear it was going to be the star restaurant downtown much like Michael Jackson was the clear star of the Jackson 5. The food was awesome and so were the drinks, the atmosphere was upscale but didn't take itself too seriously, and the drinks were strong. Because we knew the owner, David, and he would always let us bring our own booze and play our own music (in return we ordered enough sushi to feed all of Tokyo for the next decade) we threw more parties in the upstairs part than Charlie Sheen did during his whole coke/hooker binge. Needless to say when my birthday rolled around there wasn't even a question of where I would be holding my birthday dinner. I had a party of around 25 people and arrived around 9:30pm.. at least half had arrived earlier and ordered multiple drinks at the bar. There was barely anyone else at the restaurant so we went ahead and got seated upstairs. About 5 minutes the new \\"manager\\" ( I use that term very loosely because a more appropriate title for him would be raging douche canoe aka RDC) walked upstairs to massively shit on the parade. The \\"manager\\" aka RDC (I really wish I remember his name because I would love to publicly call him out) asked if I was Srebrina, thinking maybe this dude would be kind enough to wish me a happy birthday and thank me for bringing in 25 hungry and thirsty people to his establishment I enthusiastically said yes. RDC proceeded to tell me that David no longer has any association with Rishi and that he started a week ago... and that we can't bring in our own liquor anymore. I get it, not a lot of places would allow for that.. so we asked if we could buy a bottle. Now if this was a Lifetime Movie of the Week this is the part where the story stops being about a nice straight A girl living a lovely life and getting ready for prom and takes a sharp U-turn to the part where she gets kidnapped by Randy the Rapist and is taken hostage in his rundown cabin and forced to make meth. RDC proceeded to tell us he would \\"have to\\" charge us by the shot for a bottle (LOLOLOL) meaning a regular bottle of vodka would run us over 3 hundo easy. I told him to blow it out his ass and that he should have informed me of the change in management a week ago when he took over. RDC at that point decided to cement his own grave by telling me he didn't even know about my party until today when his employees told him so it's not his fault that he didn't notify me. To which I responded by stating that this just shows a complete lack of mismanagement on his part and that as a manager he should honor what was promised to us and it's bad business not to.. he told me that it's not his problem.. so I turned bitch mode on and told him he's beyond disrespectful and needs to remove himself from my presence for his own well-being and not to come back up to my party again. We ended up making the best out of the situation. The food is still decent but neither I nor the 25 other people that were at my party and regularly attended that restaurant will ever be going back. So just like the unfortunate end of the talented Michael Jackson... Rishi will try to muster out a pathetic comeback only to be cut short by a tragic and sudden death and I can only hope RDC will go back to managing the local Wendy's he came from."},{"name":"El Matador","address":"4316 Chamblee Tucker Rd","city":"Tucker","stars":"3","text":"I really want to like El Matador, especially since I can technically walk there from house.

It was also somewhat icy, evidence that the tiramisu had been previously frozen, or at the very least, refrigerated for too long.

Well, I really thought the chicken sandwich from The Pickle House would be my last meal.  Literally.  I never thought I'd eat again after downing that giant.  \\n\\nBack up a bit....I was super excited to find a pickle restaurant was opening near me!  I mean I love pickles like I love men...that is to say A LOT.  And this place is from the folks behind Pogue Mahone Pickles, which I used to buy religiously when I went to the Farmer's Market.  Oh, and THEY HAVE A PICKLE BAR.  This really \\"pickled\\" my fancy.  I made a point to check them out opening weekend.\\n\\nThey don't seem to have a website yet but their FB page has a menu posted so I called in a To Go order.  After much internal debate I settled on the Pickle Fried Chicken Sandwich.  Hubby wanted the Reuben but they were sold out so I got him the Cheeseburger (with their fried pickles on it) and we got an order of their fried pickle chips as well.  Most of the entries on the menu come with a side choice and THE PICKLE BAR.  So, I was able to fill up some good sized to go containers with all those options (Dill and Garlic, Serrano Lime, Sweet n Spicy, etc).  I also bought a jar of pickles and what promises to be amazing Pickle Bloody Mary mix.\\n\\nFirst of all....BEST fried pickles I've ever had, and that says a lot coming from a fried pickle fiend and, er, being married to an amazing fry chef (sorry Boo).  The pickles were of the sweeter variety which normally I don't care for but when paired with the salty batter and the dill pickle dipping sauce, they were a flavor explosion!  Second...get a load of that fried chicken sandwich!  Two GINORMOUS tenders on a bun with their sweet n spicy pickles and bacon.  I had to eat half the tenders separately just to fit the rest of the sandwich in my mouth (no, really!).  Again, the batter on the chicken was salty!  I am a salt fiend but this may have been a bit much, except, again when pairing with the sweet pickles it was fantastic.  I also got a side of mashed potatoes and these were obviously fresh made and super creamy, also nice to offset the salty chicken.  \\n\\nI knew when I opened that sandwich box I was soon to be comatose.  My last text was \\"jjbroghslsooggehhorpt\\" and I was OUT.  I ate that at 2:30 on a Sunday and didn't get hungry again until the next day, so yeah, don't make any plans after eating this :)  But still, I was very impressed with all and am relishing (get it?

We've talked about trying it out for the last few months. Finally this weekend the Tax Deduction was out on a campout and we were looking for a place to watch the baseball game, it was the perfect time to try Hooligans.\\n\\nWe walked in the restaurant and it was loud, really loud with the newest music, lots of base and auto-tune. Now, admittedly I'm 55 years old at this writing, but I can listen to almost anything as long as it doesn't rattle my teeth. We decided to stay and see what happens.\\n\\nThe menu is pretty sports bar basic, burgers, sandwiches, appetizers and dinner. I decided to try the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich while The Wife went with the Avocado Burger. We ordered an appetizer of \\"Frings\\" fries and onion rings.\\n\\nWhile we were waiting for food I looked around, our favorite sports bar kind of place is Buffalo Wild Wings so I compared them. Hooligans has more televisions, I didn't think it possible but they do. BDubs is slightly quieter. Hooligans has more beer offerings and a bigger bar. BDubs plays music more appropriate to the age of their customer, classic rock, top 40. As I looked around the restaurant end we were all older, had kids with us, teams of 30 somethings. The bar end was younger, but for some reason it seemed quieter.\\n\\nThe Frings were really good, the fries were crispy and seasoned perfectly with sea salt and not greasy. The onion rings were crispy and not too breaded, really tasty. Our burgers came quickly after and they were very good, just tiny issues like with the Avocado burger the bun seems too small, it needed more red onion and the avocado ranch dressing was sparse. The buffalo chicken sandwich had the same small bun but the chicken breast was good sized, you have the choice of grilled or fried.\\n\\nIn the end the volume was an issue but the service was excellent, the food was better than average and there are a butt load of TVs. We will try again, it has promise and its worth trying."},{"name":"Carmelina's","address":"307 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Gianno, Andrea and staff made sure first time dining there was top notch!

There's an upstairs dining area for private parties and the downstairs area seats about 30-40 people. The decor was very classic and cute. The main gripe we had was that the food took awhile to come out, but I think that was intentional. It was one of those restaurants where they wanted you to partake in socializing with your table and the food would come out in 30 minute intervals to allow you to digest and talk. The portions were also small, but perhaps I'm just used to eating a lot.\\n\\nI had the scallop appetizer set on a bed of fennel and orange salad. The salad itself was light and had a great vinaigrette on it. The scallop was perfectly cooked: raw in the middle and gradually more cooked as you go towards the edge. The entree I chose was a rigatoni bolognese; good, but standard. My friends who ordered the lobster ravioli raved about it aside from the small portion size. For dessert I had a strawberry shortcake type dish with light pastry bread, cream and strawberries, which was okay.\\n\\nOverall, the food was delicious, but the portions were smaller than I would have liked. The decor of the restaurant is beautiful, but make sure to make reservations because it's small and fills up quickly. Dress code was business casual. A nice skirt and top would be appropriate for women and dress pants with a jacket or button up would be good for guys.

She was craving Pad Thai, and I can always find something I enjoy at any Thai restaurant. When we walked in, we were bombarded by a pungent, very unpleasant smell. It smelled like cat urine, but I'm sure they don't allow cats in their restaurant, so I don't know what it was. We were seated up front next to a display of live plants, and I kept leaning over smelling them, trying to see if that was where the disagreeable smell was coming from, but it didn't smell any stronger there than elsewhere. I wish we'd just left, but the interior was small and looked nice, so we ordered.\\n   It took a long time for our food to arrive, even though it wasn't busy. My daughter didn't even eat 1/3 of her pad Thai, stating it wasn't good. I've never had bad pad Thai, and when I tasted it, it lacked flavor, even after adding a considerable amount of salt, and the noodles weren't cooked properly. My beef salad, on the other hand, had a WONDERFUL flavor. There were so many nuances to the flavor that it really was a delight at first. Until I got to the meat. 80% of the beef was inedible. It was gristly, and so tough I absolutely could not chew it up after several minutes. This occurred bite after bite. I ended up with a small plateful of chewed up meat on my plate at the end. I ate everything else because the flavor was great. \\n   Sadly, nobody asked us how our food was, or maybe my daughter could have eaten and I could have had the beef replaced with less gristly pieces so I could eat them. We sat waiting for the bill, and when it finally arrived, I left a note on the receipt saying that nobody had ever checked to see how our food was and that they needed to improve their service and the quality of their food.

Out of the three, I enjoyed the taco the most--it was pretty big for what you pay, and it comes topped with an egg. The pork is juicy and flavorful. The shrimp ceviche was good but simple in flavor; my favorite part was the guacamole it came with, but when has anyone ever had bad guac? It comes with 3 or 4 large chips, which I would've preferred being broken up in smaller pieces. The duck fat fries were good too, although small in portion and I did not find them that particularly unique to other fries I've enjoyed. \\n\\nFor entrees, we enjoyed the beef shoulder and the candied pork belly. The beef shoulder was excellent; it was very tender and well seasoned, and came with a sauce as well as mashed potatoes and candied potatoes (which were AMAZING).

Definitely recommend the mushrooms, they taste lovely and come in a huge portion.\\nThe pork belly was cooked very well and I especially enjoyed the rub it came with. However, I am hesitant to call it candied as I was expecting it to come in a sweet glaze of some sort. Instead, it came soaking in a bowl of brown sauce with collard greens.

It's a mystery as to why they've abandoned the front of house staff. Sad to experience such poorly led wait staff when there's so much potential to be great. Also, there's no bartender anytime so the young wait staff tries their best to pour drinks but since that is a skilled position the drinks are inconsistent. With alcoholic drinks being such a profitable part of the restaurant business it's indicative of the poor management there's no dedicated bartender. Another sad observation is the poor selection of drinks for this full service bar. I've tried hard to find a positive experience here but have failed so far and won't be back except to get takeout or to remind myself how much impact bad management can have on an otherwise quality restaurant."},{"name":"Hanabi","address":"2525 W Anderson Ln, Ste 120","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I have been here more times than I can count and it's always consistently really good.

Yup, spare ribs. But, I had to give it a try and unfortunately they were not good!

Nothing to write home about, just ok. Meat was tender but lacked any real flavor. We had to douse the brisket with their house sauces. BTW the \\"hot\\" BBQ sauce was the best tasting.\\n\\nAll the great reviews about their deviled eggs left me sorely disappointed. It was egg yolk mixed with mayo and mustard with a slice of sausage on top. What's so special about that? Even adding onions and/or relish would've really helped, but it was just mayo and mustard?! So 1.5 eggs (couldn't even put 2 whole eggs) for $4?!\\n\\nPotato salad was nails! It was sour! Almost tasted spoiled and couldn't even eat it! Horrible! Just horrible. I honestly, and I mean honestly, would've chosen Reser's potato salad from the supermarket over this potato salad any day. \\n\\nThe best item that we ordered had to be the pork and beans. Now this was awesome! Beans with pulled pork and sausage. Flavor was wonderful and meat portions were great. If this review was based solely on this dish, it'd be a 4 star.

I let her pick this evening, and she decided we were going to try a new (to us) place, Brooklyn Trattoria up in Bethany Village.\\n\\n6:00 Friday night, we arrived with a reservation and were seated immediately. \\n\\nMy first thoughts on the place:  it's exactly what I'd expect a \\"hole-in-the-wall Italian trattoria\\" to look like, at least in my imagination.  It's dining, but less-than-totally-formal--it was comfortable and cozy, and that coziness extends past your elbows to your neighbors left and right.  Table crosstalk was effortless, I found myself losing my own train of thought with all the other nearby conversations. Guests with severe introversion may wish to plan accordingly.  That said, it's fun chit-chatting and meeting new friends so we didn't mind it at all.\\n\\nTo start, Wife N. ordered a Rosemary Hibiscus Gimlet for a drink. As the driver, I stuck with water.  Her drink was wonderful, moderately complex, with a hibiscus flower floating in it, right out of the infusion. \\n\\nWe started with an appetizer of Crab Cakes.  The flavor was excellent, mildly spicy with a warm \\"afterglow\\" on the palette. Crab was fresh and flavors were spot on.  They were served on a wilting bed of mixed greens with a lovely dressing.  The cakes themselves were a little thick (almost 2\\"); both she and I agreed that they could have been a little thinner and more crispy on the outside, but really that's just a nitpick; Overall, they were great.\\n\\nFor the mains, I ordered the Saged Mushroom Gnocchi, and she ordered the Saffron Seafood Linguine.\\n\\nThe Gnocchi was fantastic in every way. A variety of mushrooms accompanied three colors of gnocchi, along with pancetta and sauteed onions and enough garlic to slay a moderately buff vampire. Loved everything about it.  It didn't look all that big on the plate, but those Gnocchi can fill you up fast, and I wound up taking about half of it home in a box as I sure wasn't going to leave any to waste.\\n\\nWife's pasta dish was amazing. Definitely house-made on the pasta, and cooked to perfection, a beautiful aldente. Seafood was fresh.  The only flaw was the shrimp was slightly overcooked so a little chewy--right on that edge of overcooked (with shrimp, that \\"perfectly done\\" window is about 15 seconds and this was about 15-30 seconds past.)  Forgiving the shrimp (which were still tasty) the dish was excellently constructed and definitely one we'd order again.\\n\\nHer meal ended up in a box as well as it was too good to not take home and eat the rest the next day.\\n\\nOwner David was working the floor and stopped by to introduce himself and tell us a bit about the place. It's been here just over a year.  There are some occasional off-menu items so be sure to ask.  One of them he mentioned (for next time) was a mushroom bruschetta that sounded heavenly.  That one's seasonal, so it may or may not be available.\\n\\nService was excellent, smiling, friendly, capable but not obsessive. \\n\\nThis place is great in every way. 4.5*s, rounded to 4 (Hey, Yelp, can we please get some half-stars?).  Another great solid little Italian joint.  We'll definitely be back."},{"name":"TILT","address":"1355 NW Everett St, Ste 120","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Awful food and service. \\nThis place is a hugely overpriced fast food quality money suck."},{"name":"Itta Bena","address":"9101 International Dr, Ste 2210","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Wonderful dining experience with attentive service,\\nInviting decor, and unique spins on comfort-food style flavors.\\n\\nWe started with the charcuterie which featured a lovely assortment of cheeses and meats with crackers and a tangy mustard sauce.

Definitely recommend - just melts in your mouth. \\n\\nI was recommended the lamb chop and it turned out great.

Some examples, fried pickles used to be thinly sliced, crisp, and divine... now they are totally SOGGY french-fry cut fried pickles... Not great. The southwest omelette at Brunches brought me continually back in for a repeat of a wonderful meal, however, no longer are the homefries with herbs (thyme maybe? can't remember... but were astoundingly great at first, we truly thought they were unique), no longer is there any fruit on the side, and the chorizo which used to be divine, is barely recognizable as being present, or as being chorizo.... the flavor was just not there.

However, its wooden furnitures, black and white wall photos, and floor-to-ceiling/French windows banded together to bring out a cozy, trendy European flair. The windows are usually wide open during the summer but it is closed during the winter seasons. The downside is that we had to share a table with people because the place was so small. \\n\\nThe dishes came in clean white plates that further set off the gorgeous colors of its contents. We ordered the Risotto Caprese for appetizer, which tasted like regular risotto, but more creamy and cheesy. My friend ordered the Carbonara. I took a bite and I enjoyed the combination of the salty flavor and chewy pasta. I had the Rollati de Pasta. It was blazing hot, with spinach, prosciutto, and cheese wrapped into little rolls drenched in a pink sauce. I've never eaten prosciutto warm and baked before. It was a refreshing experience, but not my preferred way of relishing the Italian special. The pink sauce looked as well as tasted dreamy.

So pretty! If you prefer a mocktail, you need to get the Limocita - perfect balance of refreshing tart lemon and sweetness. \\n\\nFood wise, the Tagliatelle was our favourite of the night and you can tell that the sauce was made with love. Rich with flavour and the lamb is marvellously tender. Also, it is served piping hot which is how all pasta should be served. \\n\\nThe Mini Beef Sliders are juicy and the trio of BC Salmon Crab Cakes is a must order as a starter.

Als its the middle of Texas summer so that would be crazy right now. So lately I have tried their lemonades and regular cold milk tea bobas. \\n\\nMy favorite lemonade hands down is the blueberry mint. Its tart, sweet, and so freshing! It does take a few minutes to make so be patient, when its done it comes out the window by the kitchen in the back. As noted in my previous review, their milk tea is a perfect balance of tea and sweetness. They dont over sweetened their milk tea so it really brings the tea flavor out. I have had both the green tea and the black tea milk boba but since I am a boring person, I am more partial to the original black milk tea. The staff is always wonderful and lovely! My dog training is right nearby so on Wednesdays I bring my pup with me and she can hang out outside with the doggy water bowl while I run in to grab a drink. They are nice enough to bring it out to me everytime so that way I can chill outside with the dog. \\n\\nWhen I am craving something sweet, the strawberry brick toast hits the spot. It has large halved strawberries on top of a giant sweet toast with condensed milk. Two people can share this massive thing easily. As for savory, they have their basil chicken which is delicious!

They were simply phenomenal! But just to be sure I had to come back again to try. Sadly, that's why I knocked off a star. The duck fat fries the second time around were just eh. The taste just didn't measure up to the first time, and the sauce that we had dipped it in had changed. The fries are still good, don't get me wrong, just not phenomenal, which was a huge disappointment. \\n\\nBut, that one con aside, the drinks are consistently amazing, and this is one of those restaurants where you can enjoy a really nice array of craft cocktails with equally good food. I'd say all of the drinks that my friends and I tried were amazing (and we've tried quite a few lol). And the other duck-based dishes I had didn't disappoint either. The non-duck dishes were great too, but not as uniquely outstanding as the duck dishes.\\n\\nWaiters are always friendly, and are knowledgeable. They give excellent suggestions if you ask, and can give you great recommendations based on what you like.

The red was particularly helpful in transmitting warmth and passion in spite of the modern and clean design.  \\n\\nI was greeted at the counter by a clerk who was friendly and told me she was still new at her job.  We commiserated over the jitters of the first days on the job and talked over the menu.  I ordered a Moroccan Coffee Caramel Latte and an almond croissant.  I took my delicious-looking croissant to the table, and my new clerk friend followed me over with my latte.  I had to google Moroccan Coffee on my phone and found out it was coffee blended with such delicious natural flavors as ginger, cinnamon, cardamom, and two or three others.  When I tasted it full on, I realized it was one of the best lattes I'd ever had.  It had a perfect balance of the coffee, milk, spices, and sweetness.

It's easy to miss this place, so just pretend like you're going to the Days Inn, and it will literally be in their parking lot. You can't miss the 'Grand Opening!' sign that's been up there for going on 4 years. It's not much to look at from the outside, and the inside isn't any better, but I guess you do what you gotta do when converting it from an old strip club. \\n\\nI can't say we had any issues with the service here, but we were one of two tables by the time we got our food. They seemed to be fine with getting us refills. The Xiao Long Bao will take awhile to come out, so put the order in early. We did, and it still came out well after our entrees. We ended up grabbing an order of the crab rangoon, but you could probably pass on that unless you're really craving it. It's not going to blow your mind.\\n\\nAs for main entrees, I went with the Sichuan Dry Fried Beef, and the girlfriend had the Pork in Garlic Sauce. Both were deemed 'Spicy' on the menu, but the pork wasn't too bad at all. It was delicious though, and they give you a ton of it! The garlic sauce was addicting, and I had to keep myself from eating her whole meal before mine came out.\\n\\nThe lady warned me that the dry fried beef was spicy, and it does look intimidating when it comes out, covered in red chiles and Sichuan peppercorns, but it didn't light my mouth on fire. The flavor was fantastic, and it reminded me a lot of Chongqing chicken. The guy behind us must have heard me say it wasn't too bad in the heat scale, because he claimed his mouth was burning up, so I guess it all just depends on the person. I will say there were definitely pockets of heat that will numb your mouth, and that's exactly what I was looking for. The little slices of mixed throughout only upped the taste of the dish. I'd order this again in a heartbeat. \\n\\nWe were pretty full by the time the Xiao Long Bao came out, but we managed to muscle them down (They give you about 8-10, but they're pretty small). I didn't think they were that great, and my girlfriend was a bit disappointed in the lack of broth in quite a few of them.\\n\\nThis place may have a reputation for soup dumplings, but you should honestly come for the rest of the Sichuan dishes, because they're delicious!

After my first time, I learned that half orders are the way to go - they're more than willing to split your orders on separate plates which made it easier rather than me doing a juggling act switching things on a share plate with my sister.  \\n\\nI'm a caffeine addict so I always seem to require over 3 refills of coffee.  I'm pretty happy about how the servers are on top of the refills, and they had milk available since I prefer it over the warm cream that sits in the table holders all day.  However, near the end of our visit it was getting busier and there were people waiting for our table.  I could tell the server was rushing us a bit, but I still wanted a top-up of my coffee and she ended up getting some of the re-fill spilled onto my lap.  My phone was in my lap but thank God none of the coffee got onto it.  \\n\\nOverall, I can tell why this place is known for their pulled pork because the flavour is all there -- probably the best pulled pork that I've had in vancouver.  It's got a little bit of spice to it that I really like, especially when mixed with a bit of syrup -- HEAVEN IN MY MOUTH!!!  It's pretty cool for breakfast/brunch and I'll probably end up coming back to try their other specials! (Follow them on instagram, their food photos are pretty legit).

Perhaps I am so down on this spot because I ate off their lunch menu.  Speaking of lunch menus- I find their's slighty bullshit.  Okay, totally bullshit, quit calling my bluff.  All entrees have a set price listed  and then there is an additional $1 to $3 added if you want to add vegetables or meat. I was a bit verklempt over that.  The odd thing is that none of the entrees have listed what actually comes in the dish so the assumption of the average consumer (i.e. me) is that the curry that you order is just sauce, spices, and, hopefully, free rice.  WTF??  Actually, I guess some vegetables come in each curry dish, they just don't list them in order for you to pay $2 more on your $8 entree.   \\n\\nThe red curry had a great spicy-sweet taste with it's $2 of chicken inside but was no better than my fave thai spot.  Their glass noodle pad thai, with more $2 chicken because why the fuck do I want to pay $8 for some noodles, sauce, and scallions, was a bit craveworthy and was one of the better versions I have had with it's nice heat, but it was still the most expensive, smallest portion of pad thai that I have ever gotten at a thai joint and I didn't even get free tom yum soup with lunch like most thai joints offer. \\n\\n I sum this restaurant up to OVERRATED bum, bum, bumbumbum! based on food versus cost.  I would rather pay much less and get much more and have a slightly lower quality meal, and by slightly I really think it's not much of a jump b/w Spoon versus most other thai restaurants. \\n\\nP.S.

They have TVs downstairs so it'd be a good place to watch a game. And the interior is super warm and welcoming.

I started off with the 7 Rings which consisted of egg whites, gin and other tasty looking things. Wasn't a fan. It kinda tasted like a tv static without the tv. But others in my party didn't mind it. I ordered the Thank you, next, which after stirring was way better but definitely wasn't a panty dropper. People in my party enjoyed the sour beers they offered. \\n\\nFor our main course we did family style. I'd say 2 small plates per person is a good rule of thumb. The lobster crab Rangoon was that crack. Incredibly addictive. The roasted Brussel were surprisingly pleasing.

This ex-jersey boy says \\"top-notch!\\".\\n\\nExpanded version - I've been living in Austin for two decades. I recently relocated from living up north in the Jollyville and Pioneer Crossing areas to the south Congress area and I've been scoping out the restaurant offerings down here. I had a favorite sub/hoagie/sandwich shop in Round Rock called \\"Hoody's\\" which makes wonderful, tasty, real east-coast style subs and was lamenting being so far away from it now. It seemed a one-of-a-kind shop and I knew I would miss it.\\n\\nThen the other day I chanced upon Tucci's Southside Subs looking for a really good sandwich and yeah, I found one. I hadn't eaten much that day, I had just moved a lot of boxes and I was righteously hungry. I happens to be close to my new abode so I thought I'd give it a try. I am so very glad I did.\\n\\nI was greeted by the two countermen who were talkative and informative and gave me a brief history of the place and how they only use premium Boar's Head meats and they bake their own bread and it all looked and smelled great! I was taken aback by the prices, they ran higher than I was usually willing to pay (my Yelp readers already know I'm big on bang-for-the-buck) but I was really hungry and I had a hunch that this was going to be a real treat.\\n\\nAnd oh boy...was it ever! I ordered the large (14\\") Spicy Italian cold sub on wheat and they went about creating this delicious work of art wrapped in butcher paper to go. Everything about this sandwich was exemplary, the freshness of the veggies, the taste of the meats and cheese, the texture of the bread, the requisite oil & vinegar dressing with spicy Italian peppers - I was whisked back to Paramus NJ immersed in Little Italy once again.\\n\\nDid I mention that I liked the sandwich?\\n\\nI will not miss Hoody's now that I have Tucci's. There's just one thing - these super subs ain't cheap - you have to pay a premium for this kind of quality and taste and this will keep Tucci's Southside as a special treat for me rather than a mainstay sandwich shop. If you want something a cut or three above the usual suspects you got to be willing and able to pay for it...but you'll be glad you did!"},{"name":"Jasmine's Restaurant","address":"2463 Hwy 71 E","city":"Del Valle","stars":"4.5","text":"Really good place with good food!

I got the stuffed french toast topped with caramelized banana butter, strawberry sauce and vegan vanilla cream cheese. It was as yummy as it sounds and honestly you would not know that the cream cheese filling was vegan. They even give you real maple syrup without charging you extra for it. I have been back for dinner and gotten the Mac and Cheese with the creamy 3-cheese option (not a fan of most vegan cheeses).

I'm GF and they were nice enough to accommodate my needs.  The Server suggested I order the Brasato off of the Appetizer menu.  The short rib and saffron risotto were AMAZING!  The portion was huge.  It was more of a meal than an appetizer, that's for sure.  I can't wait to go back to Boston to try more of their delicious, home-cooked and fresh meals!

When we walked in, I immediately noticed the pickle bar, clean look, pies, and jars of food for sale. You order at the front and sit down. Instead, we took menus and sat down to decide what to eat. I chose the fried fish, my mom chose the chicken salad sandwich I believe and we also got fried chicken for the kids. I imagined a filet of fish and was a little scared that $12 wouldn't get me much. I went to the pickle bar to look around as we waited. So many pickles to try plus cabbage! I grabbed all that I could. The sign says all customers can have some so we took advantage of that and grabbed several and relaxed. The food came out steaming hot. To my excitement, I didn't get a filet of fish but instead two large fried steaks of fish. They were thick too. I tried the sauces on the table and they both enhanced the flavor though the fish was seasoned well. It's better if you fish the fish in the sauce rather that squirt it all over. The crust will come off. The green beans were great too. They may have needed some extra bacon grease or maybe even pepper but still good. I forgot to mention the sodas. The sodas that many Austin restaurants sell are here too. They have sugar instead of corn syrup and then they also have a cucumber watermelon juice that was so good we kept getting up for more. Most of the time I don't go after sugary treats but I had to make an except for that. I'll also have to make an exception flit try their pies.

It's in downtown and there isn't much parking. I'd probably Lyft next time I go. \\n\\nIt's definitely more of a lunch or takeout vibe than a romantic dinner. Seating was interesting. It's small inside and several tables are the ones that are connected booths on one side of the table and regular chairs on the other. Way too close together. I'd feel like I'd be sitting with strangers. We asked to sit at a different table since we wanted more of a date vibe so they graciously sat us in front of the refrigerator. It was 18¬∞ outside. It was cold. We brushed it away since we heard the food was so delicious.\\n\\nWe ordered the Columbus roll, a spicy tuna roll, and the Long Street roll. We also ordered tofu pad Thai. The sushi is the reason I gave this place any stars at all. It was absolutely delicious! I am gluten free so I didn't eat the Long Street roll, but my wife said it was great! The spicy tuna we shared was outstanding as well. Zero complaints about the sushi. The pad Thai was weird, though. Pad Thai is one of our favorite foods and we eat it all the time. This pad Thai was missing basic ingredients and was bland. It came with tofu, zucchini (weird?), and a couple of sprigs of cilantro. No peanuts or green onions. The noodles were dry. The flavor fell flat. The tofu was the best part! I loved the tofu because it resembled Chinese takeout; that greasy and crunchy deliciousness! \\n\\nI also didn't appreciate that I told them specifically I had celiac disease and the chefs plated our sushi on the same board as the tempura shrimp on my wife's Long Street roll.

Sodas cost pennies to mix and make; they're not fine beers and wines.\\n\\nThe service was also rather slow despite there only being about 12 tables and at least 4 servers.

Think change-of-pace at a hip & cool Anime diner. I'm guessing there are just over 300 places in Austin where you can get sushi now, even the Japanese wonder why we eat so much of the stuff. \\n\\nThe ramens here have a Korean slant, if you're familiar with the pork-based shoyu broths in town, prepare to be surprised.

When in doubt, go with an all-in-one bento box - you'll get a lot of Anglo/Asian comfort food for around 10-12 bucks.\\n\\nIn the tale of two Hanabies, maybe it's a simple comfort-level thing: If I know you casually, we certainly won't go wrong with anything at the new Hanabi Arboretum.

Please give me a minute to pick my tongue off the floor as I'm salivating whilst reminiscing on this most excellent meal (please feel free to reach out to comp me a meal for my stellar review). \\n\\nSo I have a few super powers that I'm not at all too humble to brag about. 1. Pretty much always guessed the villain in Scooby Doo... one of many tell-tale signs to my parents that I was quite gifted. \\n2. I'm impossible not to like...seriously I'm infectious. Not venereal disease infectious, more cat GIF infectious.\\n3. I'm like a divining rod for good food. You release me into a new environment and I'm like a ghatdamn bloodhound. You will be impressed and thank your lucky stars you heeded my divine choice.\\n\\nNeedless to say refer to #3, my wife was impressed as usual and that's not because she thinks everything I do is awesome. To the contrary, my breathing pattern annoys her; I even annoy her in her dreams. Despite this fairytale love story she will emphatically tell you to let me do the damn choosing. So to all my friends out there who may be reading this, just hand the reins over to me, you'll be happy you did.\\n\\nWe actually came for lunch and after reading all of the reviews I was a little worried about getting a table due to its cozy size. I did the Yelp reservations the day of prior to them opening and it was pretty simple. I got a confirmation text from Carmelina's that I acknowledged and the reservation was set.\\n\\nFood: My wife got the gnocchi and I went with the Sunday macaroni. Both were pretty divine. The gnocchi was super pillowy soft and melt in your mouth perfection, and the cheese was incredible! The Sunday macaroni had a ridiculous amount of meat piled into it. I mean I was seriously impressed. While all 3 were good; I have to tip my hat to the meatballs...super flavorful, and moist (ewwww... sorry to all the people who got triggered by the \\"M\\" word). Let's not forget about the whipped ricotta... wow I will always pine for this ricotta every time I eat it now... thanks a lot. \\n\\nService/Ambiance: The place is pretty small but tastefully decorated with adequate space between tables. It is pretty cool having the kitchen out in the open. A hat off to the chef, when we arrived it was pretty slow but things picked up considerably and he handled it very well.  Our waitress was accommodating giving us suggestions and also bringing us extra complimentary bread which was much appreciated. I certainly didn't experience any of the brusqueness that other people mentioned. \\n\\nBottom Line: It has my seal of approval so considering my superpowers you should probably get here as quickly as possible.

I go for the intestines which may not be everyone's cup of tea. The dry pot comes with potatoes and the protein of your choice.

Food was average, service less so, but figured it would all resolve itself. Wasn't worth reviewing such an obviously new place. \\n\\nOn to today: I ordered two medium dark roast coffees and two plain bagels, as is. I joked about my 3-year old not eating a bagel if he even looked at it and suggested he place it in a bag while blind folded. Literally as-is. \\n\\nI noticed I was being poured medium roast coffee. I asked to confirm it was dark, and was told it was a dark medium.  It was clearly labeled medium. I again asked for dark two times. Finally asking very specifically, \\"do you have a dark roast\\". The answer was still not no, but that dark roasts are bitter and I'll like this roast better anyway. I like Peet's coffee so left it at that. \\n\\nThe fellow, I now know is the owner, was gone for some time, and returned with two heated bagels. I said I wished he hadn't done that, and that I asked for them plain, as-is. He told me this was better and they wouldn't be cold. But that's what my kids like. I said my wife and I would eat them and I'd get more bagels on my way home. \\n\\nI had plenty of time to enjoy the medium roast while waiting, and it's not bold and watered down taste. If I wanted that I'd have just gone to any of 100 Dunkin Donuts around. \\n\\nOn leaving, the owner noted several items on the menu that they don't actually have, and admitted the bagels are frozen and reheated despite being advertised as fresh daily. He said they just can't carry everything. Huh?\\n\\nI strongly considered three stars, and giving an star due for proximity and parking. But I think that's just me wanting to have a great place to go. It's tough to get past the service today, especially considering it was the owner.

It was on a homemade biscuit with goat cheese and a white Swiss cheese of sorts and gyro meat and some sort of sun-dried tomato.

Nothing horrible but enough to slow the frequency of returns. \\n\\nMy most recent time, however, warranted a reduction in stars. They have had a grand re-opening recently and have a newly printed menu. The items on the menu itself seem similar although there are fewer options. Vegetarian specific options seem to be about the same (few) although now are mixed in with everything and not a separate section. They do have them marked which is nice. \\n\\nThese changes are all fine. But they have also raised prices by $8 to $10 for all entrees! They have gone from $10-$14 an entree (which was still on the high end) to $18-$22 an entree. WOW! The sizes have only slightly increased, while some have decreased. \\n\\nThe flavors are good and fancier than some Mexican but $20 a plate is a bit much to say the least. \\n\\nThe two of us split one entree, an appetizer, and one margarita and our bill was $50!

That kind of combo craving means I want a simple basic burger executed well. Not one with truffles or crazy fancy ingredients and crazy sauce on it. But a burger cooked perfectly on the flat top with the cheese melted just right. Right size, right flavor, right toppings (crisp lettuce, fresh tomato, crunchy pickles). That's what I wanted.  And I got it. I only ordered a burger and beer and it was delish! Like, one bite at a time delish. But that's that about the food, let me tell you about the experience. \\n\\nI waked in and saw a seat at the bar.....oh it feels good to be home again :p I was immediately greeted by the bartender and she was awesome! The first words out of my mouth were \\"this is my first time here, so I'm not sure what's good\\". She hopped on that train like it was her life long goal. She takes me through the food and the beer selections and gave me her recommendations and what most people order. I love that. I took her recommendation on beer and she tells me that she will pour me a sample to make sure I like it. I was alllllll about that. To add to the experience, she says \\"not to be weird but I'm going to wait right here to make sure you like the beer, if not, you can sample anything you want.\\" I was floored. \\n\\nNeedless to say, I took her recommendation. The beer was good. However, it was made better by the fact that she took the time to make sure it's what I wanted. I know a career salesman and he told me once a long time ago that a good salesperson doesn't try to sell you on something. A good salesperson tried to get you what you want. \\n\\nThe bartender was consistent in asking how my food was and if there was anything I needed. Just a great experience. \\n\\nThis is exactly how a customer facing representative should be.

If you're not careful you could miss it. Parking can be a confusing and hard to find, but once you do you will be glad you took a chance on this place. BBQ in the city is a hot or miss with me living in Atlanta. Everyone feels they have the best BBQ, but it all comes down to the way you cook your meat and the authenticity of your sauce. This one compares to the top BBQ joints in the city. I'm surprised I am just now trying it.  I definitely will be back. Here are my thoughts:\\n\\nPROS - Price - Plates run anywhere between $9-15\\n             Food Quality - The smoked wings, spar ribs, and sausage are the top meats to get. The meat is cooked perfectly. Not too well done, but enough that the juices ooze out when you bite.\\n             BBQ Sauce - Homemade and pairs well with their meats. Not overbearing or too bland.\\n             Best sides - Mac and cheese and collard greens\\n             Customer Service - Was greeted and assisted with a smile as soon as I walked in.\\n\\nCONS - Parking - Can get confusing and is small \\n             Small Space - It is tight in the restaurant\\n             Worst sides - Cole Slaw and Grilled corn\\n\\nOverall, I will definitely be back.

Based on my experience walking in the front door, it is my impression that they may have an allergy here to making money. Had a reservation for tonight. Arrived 20 min early. It is a very tight entrance with a storm door, a small antechamber and then the front door of the restaurant. The interior is small and they maximize space by cramming the greeter station right up against the front door and a table of diners up against the greeter station. When we tried to enter, the greeter was blocking the entry and then got upset with us for holding the door open. If she would have untwisted her underwear, she might have realized she was preventing us from entering. Instead, she scolded us for standing in the doorway letting in cold air from the antechamber into the dining area. She didn't have to be Einstein to realize that we could not get in because she was blocking us. So, we backed out into the anteroom. Then, she told us because we were early, we would have to leave and come back. Kind of amazing given that there were several empty tables and places at the bar to eat. So, we left, went around the corner to Genarro's, cancelled the reservation from there and had a fantastic meal with a very hospitable staff. I'm really disappointed that we did not get to eat here as everyone seems to have decent things to say about it but since we could not get past the reservation Nazi at the front, It was not to be.

So today 3/22/17 I order same as always and request no spicy sauce on it, the man acknowledges this. I get back to my office with it, try to eat it and find it has sriracha sauce on it. So I walked all the way back and said \\"excuse me, sorry to bother you, when I ordered I asked for not spicy sauce, but it got it anyways: he interrupted and argued that the sauce (sriracha sc) wasn't spicy(hell ya it is!) so I replied polity that it was very spicy to me and I my mouth was burning, that I order it weekly with a lady that's there no problem. I was hoping  to just have it remade. He handed me back my money and tried to shoo me away. I looked at him confused and said that wasn't what I wanted.

It's similar to 1000 island dressing but has a little kick. I wasn't a huge fan of the veggie patty itself but the cheddar tots and onion rings were great!

Very busy as it always is but had cleared out some by the time we were seated for dinner. We ordered the pork belly and the crispy chicken thighs, two of the entrees we enjoy on return visits and found this visit to be a huge disappointment. It took longer than it should have to get our food given the time of day and the fact that the house was not full inside or out. In addition it appears they had a new chef/cook or someone who didn't care about presentation or preparing as described on the menu. I was taken aback when the food was brought to our table. It looked as if it had fallen off the plate on the floor and put back on the plate and served to me. In addition it was missing all but the chicken thighs. Basically I was paying for two chicken thighs, period!  When I met with the manager at our table she thought it looked great and discounted that my entree was not as described on the menu. She rolled her eyes and asked if we wanted something different and it was at that point we told her we were done and that we were leaving. We were completely surprised that Salty Sow has lowered their standards to accommodate huge crowds that have shown them that substandard food and service are acceptable. It was a huge insult to me that they felt I deserved less than what was expected or that I didn't know better. Either way they risked losing a loyal patron and most likely have."},{"name":"Hooligan's Sports Bar and Grill","address":"8220 NE Vancouver Plaza Dr","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"This used to be one of our favorite places to go and over time the service has gotten decreasingly worse.

One of the drinks is completely wrong, but okay, not a big deal. We're still waiting for one more person to arrive to order food. Well that person arrives a few minutes later and we continue to wait for 35 minutes for no one to come to our table. One of us goes up to the bar to ask about another round of drinks. We wait another 10 minutes, go up again and say we  just want to leave and pay for the drink we got. The waitress that started out with us disappeared and the bartender says she was working by herself, although we saw other people in the restaurant working.  At one point while we were waiting we saw the bartender and the waitress standing by the register talking and folding boxes.We made eye contact and they still did not come to our table to see if we were ready to order now that the whole party was there.

Another fact-  if you are not Asian, your experience will not be the same as those that are.  I eventually got seated and looked at my cheap looking menu to only see your basic, Americanized dishes.  Then I noticed that the Asian customers had glossy, full colored menus with pictures of every dish.  Took me awhile to flag down the waiter, but finally got one.  This is the real Chinese food.  Apparently, my choice seemed too risky for them, because the waiter asked me several times if I was sure, and noted that I couldn't get my money back if I didn't like it.  Then, the cook came out to make sure I knew what I had ordered.  It was the pork intestines, and if you truly aren't adventurous, it may not be for you, but I was certainly not going to settle for General Tso's.  Despite the racist overtones of the staff, the food was fantastic!  I just don't understand why a great authentic Chinese restaurant doesn't cash in on that fact?

Their dog lunged at our dog and had no \\"service animal\\" attire but we were told by said bar tender it was. The patrons who had the dog were very rude to boot.

Not the best, not the worst, but so much more solid than any other Austin tea house. I don't eat tapioca, so I have zero comments about it. \\n\\nOn top of that, Tea Haus serves sea salt creme iced coffee! I haven't met a single other place that serves this drink except for one boba shop in Dallas. This drink is a specialty made popular from 85 Degrees C Bakery in Cali, and it hasn't really hit many other states, so I was surprised seeing Tea Haus serve it! It was pretty good, and they use Summermoon's wood-fired coffee beans, which I love. \\n\\nThey only offered two dishes when I visited: brick toast and basil fried chicken. I'm assuming they hope to expand because, well, only one of them is actually decent. \\n\\nThe brick toast is a large Japanese sweet bread dessert drenched with condensed milk and strawberries. I don't like strawberries, but that aside, the toast itself was really good and def a nice snack to enjoy with boba or coffee. I hope they offer other \\"flavors\\" down the line because, well, not everyone likes strawberries (me) lol. \\n\\nThe basil chicken was... not worth the money. Based on pictures, I really expected my chicken to be crispy. Instead, I got a cup of slightly soggy chicken. It was bread-y, but not crispy, and it just didn't taste right. The seasoning was alright, I guess. I honestly just couldn't get over the fact that it wasn't crispy chicken even though it looked crispy from afar. \\n\\nService was very sweet! They walked us through the menu and offered the local favorites as well as their own (although there isn't really much to choose from). They did forget to make my coffee, and I had to remind them that I hadn't received anything for well over ten minutes, but they immediately apologized and fixed the problem. \\n\\nThe only thing that really sucks about Tea Haus is that it's rather far from UT Campus, and their milk tea is way better than anything else in Austin. So that means I'm stuck with Tap's or Coco's if I'm craving milk tea even though Tea Haus's is way better.

So every morning the bread is warm and fresh never stale. The only other place that make fresh bread daily is Ba Le near  Umass - Savin Hill.  These 2 are my goto bang mi. Now the one I like the most is grill beef or pork with Soy sauce not fish sauce. They always put fish sauce with grill meat unless you ask like myself. The flavor of soy sauce is lighter and less fishy. If you like a more creamy taste then ask for extra butter. It's not really butter, but more of a mayonnaise minus the vinegar.

I've never had Korean food or Korean BBQ before so this was definitely an experience for us. We went on a Wednesday night so it was fairly empty and we were seated right away. The restaurant is deceptively small and has room for a large number of parties with long tables that could easily accommodate big groups. The menu seemed fairly simple but since we were unfamiliar with the food, we asked our server for her recommendations. We settled on one of the platters that came with chicken, pork, beef bulgogi, and pork belly and prime rib. We got the recommend sides - an egg soup that she warned us was very spicy, a seafood Korean \\"pizza\\", and what essentially came out to be lettuce wraps. The lettuce wraps came out first, with white rice, several types of kimchi, and a number of add ons. They were delicious! The soup came out next, fairly quickly and - though it looked dauntingly bright red like it should've been extremely spicy - was pretty mild but DELICIOUS. We couldn't get enough! Next came all of the meats - the chicken and pork were cooked in the back and the rest was brought out raw. Our server showed us how to use the fire pit in the middle and left us to do our cooking. Everything. Was. Incredible. The chicken and pork bulgogi was tender and juicy, the beef bulgogi just as tasty and tasted even better since we worked for it ourselves and the prime rib was amazing and flavorful. The only thing that left me unimpressed was the pork belly - it burned and had little taste no matter how quickly we tried to cook it. Overall, a fun experience where you can interact with those you are with and really enjoy dinner. The only complaint - not enough room at the table for all of the food we ordered!"},{"name":"Hooligan's Sports Bar and Grill","address":"8220 NE Vancouver Plaza Dr","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"Great Onion rings, always horrible service on the bar side, .50¬¢ good pool tables, average prices.

I can't say it was bad, it's more that in the Boulder area, I've had similar dishes that tasted way better. Overall the food lacked of flavor.  My husband really wanted to get the Shishito Peppers, remembering a restaurant in Longmont where we had them a few months ago, and they were delicious.  Well, Arugula's were fine, but a little boring. Same with the roasted cauliflower. I am not a chef, but my feeling is that if you caramelize the food for long enough, the flavors develop and mix nicely, which is not the case at Arugula.\\nThe basket of bread came free, which is always nice (and less and less commun). Unfortunately, the bread was chewy, which to me is always a red flag.  If you can't even make decent bread, don't expect much from the rest of the food.\\nPortions were quite small, even if I am aware we were sharing small plates (still I am comparing to other restaurants in the area.)\\nFor dessert, the $10 Tiramisu was fine, but not worth $10 and it looked a little sad, all deflated.

What can I say? McD imprinted on me as a young child since it was the first cheeseburger I've ever eaten in my life. \\n\\nAnyway, wanting something filling and inexpensive we trekked our way to McDonald's on a Wednesday afternoon. I picked this location because it looks fancy and huge from the outside. \\n\\nThe inside is smaller than expected, but there are tons of tables, chairs, and booths. Since this is a McDisney, the decor is fancier than usual and the prices are a bit more expensive. A double quarter pounder with cheese meal normally costs $6-7 (without tax) depending on where you are in the US. It costs $8.49 for the same meal at this location--making it about 20-30% more expensive than usual. This also applies to the coffee which is $1.99 for a large, usually it's cheaper than that. It sucks that it's more expensive, but it's still less than resort/park food. I do think that since this is a tourist area they could benefit from having free wi-fi. \\n\\nThis may just be me, but it's too cold. I came in kinda sweaty and the cool blast on my wet skin gave me goosebumps. I had to put on a sweater in order to drink my soda. \\n\\nI noticed that a lot of the 1-star reviews are from people ordering outside of \\"normal\\" business hours (9AM-5PM). I'm no stranger to late night McD eats and I always notice that most locations are understaffed during those hours. Unlike other reviews that gave low scores during normal business hours, I got my food really quickly, my order was correct, and I received friendly service from the people behind the counter. Overall, an A-ok McDs. \\n\\nTo summarize:\\n- No free wifi but that would be great for travelers\\n\\n- It's really cold inside, the contrast from the heat outside made it a little uncomfortable \\n\\n- 20-30% more expensive than average US McD prices \\n\\n- Food came fast with no problems, but this is during normal business hours, not late night where people seem to have a lot of issues"},{"name":"Oath Pizza - Fenway","address":"1348 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Oath at Fenway gets 4 stars for their pizza and 0 stars for their online ordering system and customer service.

It was eye catching since it included the Sate and the short ribs which were noted as the popular items, so it made sense so we could try the other items out included.

This little gem was amazing, with a delicate pastry coating and chili relleno filling packing an amazing whollop of flavor and creamy goodness. The side of refried beans topped with melty cheese was also decant. I thought I was eating light, but this came in two plates, with the taco and mini guacamole salad on the second plate. Also tried at the table were the tri-color chicken burrito, the taco salad, and some enchiladas. Everyone left happy, full and the entire meal for four barely dented the wallet at all.

I looked at the cocktail list & was quite impressed & wanted to try some but chose to refrain, although the cantaloupe martini sounded awesome. The Thai Peanut Chicken Salad was really good & fresh with grilled chicken, peanuts, lettuce, red cabbage, & mandarin oranges with a light yet refreshingly citrus dressing. The crab Mac 'n Cheese was gemelli pasta in a cream sauce with scallions, buttery breadcrumbs, & a huge amount of crab meat; it was probably the best I have had anywhere. The burger, although cooked medium well to appease my mother, was still tender & moist & topped with Gruyere cheese, buttery breadcrumbs, & a garlic mayonnaise.

But isn't that the point of being a \\"trailer\\"??  To take your \\"element\\" with you??

Try our banh mi slider!!\\".  Nice diversionary tactic, sir, as that shit was the bomb and sufficiently threw me off track about the fries. *** \\n\\nAs I was ordering for me and my hard workin hubby, I wanted a smorgasbord of items.  Got 3 tacos and two sliders and then asked about the new burritos (basically the same taco ingredients with rice) and was told they weren't making those that day either.  hrrmph.  Got all 5 items for $15 plus they gave me a cup of watermelon fresca (very refreshing!) and when hubby got home he just said \\"That it??\\"  Thankfully I'd bought some fresh pico from Kala and some hummus at another vendor so that rounded out a full meal.  \\n\\nDon't get me wrong....next time I'm at the market, I will find it very hard to resist another banh mi slider or 3, the best item on the menu, imo, and probably the best prepared food at the farmers market.

The decor is simple inside pleasant but the tables and beverage cups icky sticky..the utensils are brought to you in a cute little metal bucket and upon getting them out to use we discovered that the soup spoons were covered in dried up food ehh..but we asked for new.. when my guest brought it to the staffs attention they laughed.. my thghts of this place then went down hill! New to the experience I asked for a \\"spicy\\" soup recommendation and was told \\"we don't really make the soups  spicy..that's why there's chili oil..saracha and chili paste on the tables\\" I was like..huh WHAT? So we scoured the menu and proceeded to place our order.. Upon arrival..not only was our food served to us separately but it came in and out of the kitchen THREE times because apparently they kept forgetting the already standard ingredients in our dishes.. sorry but the cooks weren't new..lol . We witnessed this happening to all the other patrons as well..we figured must be a groggy Monday morning for some of us..we get it!..lol . The broths to our dishes were prepared deliciously well but the ingredients altogether were barely subpar.. THAT'S were the disappointment lays.. we wanted to like this place but realize we're still in search of awesome soup noodle..looks like green papaya or even a venture to Portland is next!!? $20 for two..guess you never know what's out there until you Stop..\\nHappy hunting people..keep YELPING!"},{"name":"Hanabi","address":"2525 W Anderson Ln, Ste 120","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Wow!

Being a huge fan of Japanese baked goods, I couldn't wait to try this place. I stopped by Oyatsupan Bakers about half an hour before they closed for the day. Some of their baked goods were already sold out (such as the popular strawberry pastry), but they were still pretty well-stocked in their other goods even at the end of the day.\\n\\nI got the matcha melon pan, regular melon pan, and curry bun to go. I was going to get the chocolate chip melon pan as well, but after trying a sample of it, I decided that it was not to my taste. The texture of the chocolate chip melon pan was similar to that of a stale cupcake in my opinion. It did not quite have the soft, springy texture of some of the higher-quality melon pan breads I have eaten. The matcha melon pan had a softer texture on the inside, which was nice. I wasn't able to taste the matcha flavor, however. It would have been nicer if the matcha flavor was much stronger.\\n\\nThe baked goods at Oyatsupan Bakers are definitely on the pricier side. Unfortunately, I do not believe that their taste warrants their price. Since this bakery is relatively close to me, I will probably stop by again to try the soft brioche loaf that caught my eye and skip on the smaller baked goods."},{"name":"The Red Wagon","address":"2128 East Hastings Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Hipster feel-good brunch place.

I understand Chipotle is not a \\"service oriented\\" restaurant, however employees like her really upset me!

You have to order at the register and then take a number to open seating where a waitress will bring your food and anything else you need. Kind of a confusing process as the waitress can also bring you drinks or condiments so new comers wouldn't know to tip after sitting down or on the card or at all thinking it's a quick service. Anyhow I asked what the gourmet burger of the month was and the cashier informed me of the name. I asked what was on it and she said I don't know......lmao okay? This lady looked miserable, didn't upsell anything or mention they had craft soda. If she did I would've ordered a cup but never mentioned it so there's that. After my group of 4 sat we waited....and waited...and waited. After 40 minutes (not exaggerating) we finally received our food. The restaurant was half way full on a Monday night nowhere near packed so not sure what was the hold up but I did see our food sitting under the heat lamp for some time. My burger was ordered medium rare and cooked exactly how I liked it. Loved the burger and ingredients, everyone else in the groups food was cold. They asked for a reheat and waited another 15 minutes to get their food. I also ordered a side of truffle fries since they looked amazing in pictures.

The entire restaurant is outdoors but we sat at the long table by the bar which was covered and under a small vent. It was literally 100 degrees outside and my co-worker and I were in business attire, so the very kind server offered to close a side door by the bar to keep the cool air in, which still left the entire front of the restaurant open for people to enter, making it very obvious that the restaurant was open for business. This made a HUGE difference and we were so grateful, but just as we were feeling cooled off and comfortable, the manager came out and was obviously irate with the server and opened up that side door again. I told her that me and my co-worker were hot, but she said the door must stay open (even though the entire front of the restaurant was open), and then left the room without offering to help the situation in any other way.

Evidently being a re-purposed industrial space there is not really AC, and there is an uninsulated metal roof. There are fans, but they really don't help. I was kind of dying wearing jeans and a polo. Diners around us whispered prayers for the sun to finally set.\\n\\nOur server was disinterested in us at best, and often vanished for long periods of time, leaving us hanging. She made no attempt to even appear pleasant, and seemed like she would have been equally happy working in a West Virginia coal mine. \\n\\nThe food was mediocre overall, and the portions were paltry, and I'm used to New York City sized meals. The crab fritter was good, although the sauce had little flavor, also you only get one. I also had the gnocchi with guinea hen ragu. There were probably no more than 5 or 6 gnocchi in the dish, and fit neatly in the small sunken basin of an over sized plate. I stared longingly at the mountain of fries and steak my dining companion ordered. The toffee cake was not bad, but also smaller than a hockey puck, and the vanilla ice cream quinelle melted into soup on the way from the kitchen to the table.\\n\\nThe server wordlessly and dispassionately took our money, producing no more than a forced smile as we passed her on our way out of that hot box.

We had originally planned to go to Gotham but after checking their menu (and reviews) it quickly came to light that Gotham is a little bit too expensive (over $100 per person easily) for a family of 5. Hy's seemed like a nice middle ground between places like the Keg and Gotham. \\n\\nHy's ticked many positive boxes. The decor is very warm and inviting with a very classic steakhouse feel. The waiting on staff are all dressed in heritage steakhouse attire, which is a nice touch. We had expected it to be a bit more fine dining but I was pleasantly surprised at how casual it was. It definitely attracts the business crowd.\\n\\nThe service at Hy's was absolutely fantastic, some of the best I've had. Not pretentious at all like you would expect from fine dining, but very personable yet highly attentive. The gentlemen who served our table was very friendly and humorous. \\n\\nThe food for the most part was also very good. We had the cheesy bread to share to begin and it was very tasty (though how good can cheesy bread really be?). Everyone seemed to enjoy their main. I tried a few different sides as we shared some items and for the most part it was all really good. I'd have to say though, I was not blown away by my steak and this is why I'm docking one star. I ordered the Steak Au Poivre, which is a pepper crusted New York strip with a peppercorn sauce. I love pepper on my steak and especially peppercorn sauce so this seemed ideal. Whilst the steak was cooked to perfection, I found the peppercorn crusting ruined it a bit. It seemed like they just covered the steak in peppercorns then put it under a grill or something, because the peppercorns were quite burnt. Imagine a fantastically cooked NY strip with burnt peppercorns on top. It seemed like something delicious ruined by something so simple. Anyway, long story short, the steak was decent but tarnished by the burned peppercorns and that ruined it a bit since I was hoping to be blown away by a $55 steak. I've had better steaks at the Keg personally, but perhaps I just ordered the wrong thing. I'm certainly no steak connoisseur. \\n\\nI also ordered the pistachio creme brulee for dessert, which was quite good and my wifes brother ordered these amazing bananas in a toffee kind of sauce with ice cream that is prepared table side in a dazzling display of fire. This is where the waiter really shone and we had quite a lot of fun watching him seemingly almost setting fire to the restaurant (though he assured us he never set anything, or anyone, on fire).\\n\\nOne minor grievance for me personally was at the beginning of the meal we were sat next to a rowdy bunch of men who were dropping F bombs like there was no tomorrow. Not what we really wanted to be next to for a birthday celebration at a fine restaurant, but it seems to attract the business crowd and a bunch of young corporate guys can act like this, I can't really blame the restaurant. Luckily they left before we even had our starters so it turned out okay, if we had been next to them the entire meal I'd have been annoyed. \\n\\nOverall I think the meal probably came to something like $75 per person, though I never paid so can't be sure."},{"name":"Golden Delight Bakery","address":"246 Lincoln Cir","city":"Columbus","stars":"4.5","text":"The fresh strawberry cake is one of my favorite classic Columbus desserts.

Speaking of salads, if you get the  side salad that comes with the meal, then be prepared to travel back to the 80s, as the side salad was pretty much 90% iceberg lettuce with a massive amount of dressing just dumped all over it (to the restaurant: Iceberg lettuce has zero nutritional value and is about as low brow as you can get. Also, dressing on the side!).\\n\\nNow if you are only interested in the meats, then the place is amazing! I ordered the ribs/lamb tips combo and it did not disappoint.

It's just terrible.  Somewhere between L.A. and Le Bare, neither of which I want associated with my food.  However, I didn't let that put me off as I've heard good things.\\n\\nLa Barbecue is another of a number of boutique hipster BBQ \\"joints\\" that deliberately abuse the customer as part of the marketing plan.  I'm Texas born and raised in an era before hipsters and when east Austin was a no-go zone.  There's nothing organic about a place like this, at least as it relates to the old-school, filthy BBQ joints that served on butcher paper because their customers couldn't (or wouldn't) afford plates and someone to wash them.  But then, some of those old places really weren't all that good in comparison, and the times change.  This and similar places are designed for the wealthy, and that will be abundantly clear when you pay your check.  Definitely not a simple place for simple folks.  I'm not impressed with style or hype, but quality speaks for itself, and the brisket here was outstanding.  Just don't think you're coming from douchy L.A. and getting an \\"authentic\\", old, rustic Austin experience like what inspired Charles Whitman to sally forth into ignominy.  This is all modern, metropolitan Austin...\\n\\nPros\\n1.  Brisket is outstanding.  9-10 on a 1-10 scale.  They start with USDA Prime brisket and massage it into a work of art.  They also do a nice job of trimming off the not so nice parts.  When your brisket is this good, you can get away with a lot in the other categories.\\n2.  Really good beer selection.\\n3.  Didn't try the ribs or pork but they are popular.\\n4.  Got in and out in about an hour by arriving at 10:30 AM on a Friday.  A vastly better experience than Franklin's for equivalent quality.\\n\\nCons\\n1.  Hipsters, and lots of 'em behind the counter, and the kind that don't seem to have much personality.\\n2.  Did I mention the stupid name?\\n3.  Line started to form about 10 AM on the Friday I was there; I arrived at 10:30.  People arriving at 11:00 were in for at least an hour trip through the line.\\n4.  No sense of urgency by staff to process customers in a timely manner.  I think this is a deliberate strategy to keep people queued up out the door because nothing attracts a crowd like a crowd, and this is what I mean by deliberately abusing the customer.  Sort of an artificial scarcity induced to drive demand.  Apparently, it works if the product quality is there, and it is.\\n5.  Despite obviously having been open for business and selling other items for quite some time by 11:00 AM, they won't sell shred one of BBQ before the anointed time.  Hipsters stand around shuffling their feet and avoiding eye contact behind the counter with tattoo encrusted, crossed arms until the clock strikes 11:00.  But as consolation, they will uncross those tattoo encrusted arms to sell you a 12 oz $8 draft beer before 11:00.\\n6.  Shells & cheese were mediocre and over $5 for a single serving.  Shells obviously weren't stirred in the pot, so despite being under-cooked, they just glued together into big, monolithic gobs of pasta before they got any cheese.  Plus, not hot.  Sides are usually not impressive at boutique BBQ places so no surprise here.  \\n\\nAll told, I think I will be back as long as the planets are in alignment to get me in and out in a reasonable time-frame.  Once we get to an hour+ wait, I'll go elsewhere.  But if I'm willing to wait an hour, it's pretty damned good.  The brisket is definitely 5-star.  The customer abuse drags it down to 4-star in my opinion, but the awesome brisket gives them a base rating that goes no lower."},{"name":"Kabayan Grill Filipino Restaurant","address":"1328 North John Young Pkwy","city":"Kissimmee","stars":"4.5","text":"Sizzling Squid is one of my favorite..

We were both looking forward to getting some good gourmet Mexican food; when we lived in Durham, NC, we enjoyed a restaurant called Dos Perros that served this type of cuisine, even hosting our wedding rehearsal dinner there.  For our meal tonight, I got the lamb chops and my wife got the mole poblano with duck breast.\\n\\nI'll start with the good.  The service was friendly.  The background music was good (Miles Davis' first great quintet).  The miniature breads, salsas, and pickled vegetables that were brought out before our entrees were cute, well presented,  and very tasty.  The asparagus and thin-sliced potatoes that came with my lamb chops were flavorful and had a great texture.  Finally, the flan that we got for dessert was really good (if surprisingly firm) and had a great tequila orange sauce.\\n\\nNow onto the less good.  The dining room was somewhat tightly packed -- my wife of average build had to squeeze to get to her seat in the corner.  In addition, the acoustics were funny -- I had an easier time hearing the conversation of the two tables adjacent to us than I did hearing my wife seated directly across from me.  Most disappointing were the entrees themselves.  While my lamb chops were cooked appropriately (nice and rare), neither they nor the orange sauce they came with had all that much flavor.  Although the duck breast in my wife's mole poblano was beautiful, it was \\"one of the toughest pieces of meat [she's] ever encountered.\\"  \\n\\nOverall, we were really disappointed.  When you dine at a restaurant like this, you hope to get a meal where you look forward to each subsequent bite, and we didn't get that.

This would have been #2 but I found that the pork made the dish a bit too salty.  4)  Chicken Marsala has chunks of grilled chicken made with zucchini and mushrooms.  While the sauce is nicely seasoned, my niece didn't think it was sweet enough or had enough marsala taste.  My complaint about this dish is that the chicken was grilled then put in the dish.  The meat was a bit dry and did not feel incorporated into the marsala sauce, which I also felt had too much butter.  \\n\\nOverall, the food was very well executed.

This place did not disappoint! The staff was very friendly and made it a good experience. I love mocha drinks and I am very picky on what I like, but I liked my iced white mocha. Their danishes and desserts are good too. I'm only in Portland for a day, but if I were to come back I would like to come back here and try some of their other drinks. I like how they have a large menu with a variety of coffee drinks. The main reason for only 4 stars is because the white mocha was a little too milky and didn't have as strong of a coffee flavor as I would've liked. It was a little bland. But I still liked my drink.

The restaurant stays true to its Peruvian roots, serving Pisco cocktails and other seafood focused dishes. It's impressive that the kitchen can have such variety despite its size. Peruvian is not something I typically have, so I was able to enjoy something new.\\n\\nThe restaurant is quite small, so a group of four is about the largest size I would recommend. For four, we had a ceviche, causa, and three entrees and it was the perfect amount of food. The kitchen is quite generous with the portions and everything was a bit larger than what I expected from this type of restaurant. Our waiter had some excellent recommendations and was patient in explaining what the dishes were since many of us had not had Peruvian in the past.\\n\\nCeviche with mixed seafood with blue cod, shrimp, squid (19): In the past when I've had ceviche from other restaurants, I've always been a bit disappointed, but this time I was thoroughly impressed. First of all, they are very generous with the amount of seafood they served. The plate was packed with seafood, which is the opposite of what I typically find. The acid in the ceviche helps tenderize the fish but not overpower it. The texture of the cod and squid were very soft, but you could still taste its natural favor. Great starter!\\n\\nCausa de avocado and tomato (14): The best way to describe this is a Peruvian potato salad. Potato is layered between avocado and tomato. The dish is creamy from both the potato and the avocado and a sauce over the top, and the tomato helps cut through some of the richness. Not my favorite, but not bad, I would have preferred some other textures maybe.\\n\\nScallops con pasta a la huancania (27): Squid ink fettuccine and huancania, topped with seared scallops. A close tie for my favorite dish of the night. The pasta sauce is really creamy without being too thick and the scallops were perfectly cooked - seared but still tender in the middle. \\n\\nTacu tacu a lo macho (27): Rice and beans with mussels, clams, shrimp & squid in panca sauce. The rice and beans combined to form something along the lines of a risotto, creamy and delicious. The shellfish was excellent as well!\\n\\nCarapulcra (25): Incan stew with potato, chicken, pork, peanuts, and Port wine. This is a hearty meat stew served with a side of wine. The stew itself was very flavorful and all of the meat was very tender, just a bit too salty for my taste otherwise it would have been great.\\n\\nWithout any drinks or desserts, we ended up paying 35 per person after tip and tax.

The pork was sliced thin with copious amounts of cilantro and those infamous dried red peppers. The peppers were chopped and softer than usual allowing them to be consumed instead of put aside.  The honey walnut shrimp was killer. Obviously it included shrimp and walnuts. It also had large chunks of cantaloupe in a white, honey sauce. I was not sure what to think. It was so good, I know  I will order it again. All the other food was good, the rangoon(s) were full of crab and cream cheese with green peppers. I am not a fan of veggie egg rolls, but these were pretty good. The pad Thai and the Orange chicken were alright. The breading on the Orange chicken was mushy but the sauce was very tasty. The pad thai was not spicy enough for me. Everyone at our table like their food.\\nGotta mention Helen's is housed in a former strip club. We were in the part where the dance pole used to be.

My 5 star rating really is a \\"As good as it gets!\\" for the market they are in.  \\n\\nI was a little unsure when I walked in of where to go.  I saw a bar to the left, a coffee menu to the right, and another menu in the center.  We split the difference and followed the lead of the group in front.  After a short look at the menu, my wife and I knew want we wanted.  We ended up ordering at the bar after the bartender invited us over there.  \\n\\nWe ordered the TILT burger and a large fry to share.  I had heard portions were large and wasn't super hungry, and boy am I glad we split it.  The TILT burger comes with 2 patties, a 3rd bun in the middle, thick smokey bacon, and all your standard toppings.  I do tend to like thicker burger patties and these were the thinner style, but this burger was still juicy and tasty.  \\n\\nNow lets talk fries.  When it comes to fry-style, beer battered speaks to me.  I love the thick coating and crunchyness.  TILT does beer battered in epic fashion.  We made the \\"mistake\\" of ordering a large fry.  Let me paint a picture for you: Think of your average apple pie.  It's in a 12-inch tin with a rounded off plumpness of apples.  Now replace apples with beer battered fries in a 12-inch tray.  That's a whole fryer-load of fries.  Even with our best efforts, we ended up taking a full to-go box full of fries home that will inevitably be a wonderful snack.\\n\\nI loved the interior at TILT with the whole industrial, steampunk theme.

Anyone who enjoys juices/smoothies has surely noticed that they are hard to come by in Boston, especially the healthy, made-to-order variety. I've been not so patiently awaiting this place to open, and finally got to try it this weekend. \\n\\nThe menu is inventive and well-rounded, with many options to try over my next few visits. I had the pleasure of talking to the owner who walked me through just about every menu item - what's in it, how it's prepared, how it tastes. Definitely got my mouth watering! I'm eager to try the Pepita Avocado Smash (avocado toast, essentially), the Smoked ELT (eggplant bacon?! must try) and the Jackfruit Banh Mi to see for myself if cooked jackfruit actually tastes like chicken. I saw the soba noodle salad and the Pesto Kale Caesar in the cooler and both looked like delicious lunch options - if only I worked nearby. \\n\\nThe main reason for my visit was a pre-workout smoothie - or \\"shake\\" as Pressed calls them. I got the Calm: almond butter, dates, maca, protein and some other ingredients I'm forgetting. It was SO GOOD! So so good. And the perfect sustenance before a vigorous workout. \\n\\nThe shake ingredients, less the liquid, are pre-measured and packaged individually to not only speed up the process, but also to ensure the quality and taste are consistent each time you order it. The only thing I didn't ask was whether you can custom order a shake if you don't like an ingredient, we'll see. The juices are good for 72 hours and are made a few times per week, as needed. It sounds like they've done their research and know how to meet the demand in an efficient manner, while staying true to their mission of \\"high quality, healthy food on the go.\\" \\n\\nAll said, I couldn't be happier about this new addition to Charles Street!

The Facebook event said there would be 5 shakes, but I think I tried 7, which was great.  I had been once before and got the Panshake, so I've tried a bunch of different ones.\\n\\nI really enjoyed all the ones I tried.  Let me see if I can remember them all:  vanilla jalapeno, cookies and cream, vanilla, corn, pumpkin, chocolate strawberry banana, and oatmeal breakfast.  The corn was still in development when I tried it.\\n\\nHere's the thing: I can make milkshakes at home, and, like sex, even a bad milkshake is pretty good.  But what separates a milkshake you make yourself versus one that you pay for is the details, and that's what Handshakes gets right.  It's that combination of ingredients and flavors that you don't think of yourself.  Or it's taking a classic and adding just that special something that makes it unique and special.\\n\\nLet's talk about that Panshake first, since it's getting the most attention.  It's really good!  I was pretty skeptical about liking it, because I just wasn't sure how you'd translate hotcakes into shake form.  But it works.  You can taste everything that you'd expect from a plate of pancakes, and it still tastes good as a dessert.  Well worth your time.  Same with the oatmeal breakfast shake.  Another review mentioned that it should be cooked oatmeal, but I think you'd lose a lot of flavor.  I actually like the little bit of rough oats that you get in it.  Again, some unique flavors that you'd never try as a shake, but work.\\n\\nI'll do quick reviews of the others before I go off on the most enjoyable one I tried.  I won't repeat it on all of them, but I really thought they were all good and would gladly have any of them again:\\nVanilla jalapeno: Quite a kick!  They use fresh jalapenos, and don't skimp.  Would also be great with chocolate\\nCookies and cream:  All the flavors you'd expect, but not as overly sweet as those can sometimes be\\nCorn:  If you want unique, try this one.  A strange mix of sweet and savory, with a strong corn taste.  They put some black pepper in, and it really added to it. \\nPumpkin:  Special for the season.  Not cloying like a lot of pumpkin flavored desserts.\\nChocolate strawberry banana:  This one was made by the request of one of the Me So Hungry guys.  It had a lot going on, but they all stand out.\\n\\nSo here was my most enjoyable experience:  The simple vanilla shake.  And this is what puts Handshakes in the 5-star column.  We all know what a vanilla shake should taste like.  It's usually a person's first shake because it's a shake at it's most fundamental.  Vanilla is a great flavor, and it's a good base for a dessert.  All other shakes are, essentially, a variation on the basic vanilla shake.  So when they gave it to me, I figured I'd know what I was getting.  But when I tried it, I was blown away.  I don't know what they put in it, but it was like I'd never had a basic vanilla shake before.  It was closer to this Platonic ideal of what a vanilla shake should be.  Everything in it popped more, and it made me reconsider the simple vanilla.\\n\\nBy all means, try the specialty shakes that you can only get at Handshakes.  But don't gloss over that simple vanilla just because you think you've been there and done that.  It's whatever little things they put in that make that you want to buy the shake rather than do your tried and true shake at home.\\n\\nWell worth your valuable time and calories!"},{"name":"Jade Sushi & New Asian","address":"2425 Edgewater Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"This restaurant has a unique and inviting interior.

We were greeted and seated as soon as we walk. The place looks cozy with many seatings. Our waitress was attentive and always checked in on us  even though as it got a little busy towards the end of our lunch with only two on the floor attending the entire restaurant. \\n\\nTheir menu is interesting. It's a fusion between Korean and Japanese. Even though they greet you in Japanese, the staff speaks Korean which made me realize this is a Korean owned Japanese restaurant. (I haven't found an authentic Japanese restaurant in this area yet that's run by Japanese). I ordered the bulgogi ramen, chicken karaage, gyoza and chicken teriyaki.\\n\\nTo be very honest the best out of all was the gyoza with the dipping sauce. Everything else was either just okay such as chicken teriyaki (with way too much vegetable and quite a different teriyaki sauce) which almost reminded me of the Korean chicken BBQ version. \\n\\nChicken karaage was just a better version of chicken nuggets (nothing comparable to the original chicken karaage where the outside is super crispy but the meat inside is juicy and flavorful). \\n\\nThe worst was actually the bulgogi ramen. The meat was way too chewy. The broth was bland (way too watered down). I never usually have to use seasoning in my ramen but this one needed some help! \\n\\nI'm pretty sure they make decent Korean food but their Japanese dishes are just not good. \\n\\nThe quest for good Japanese restaurants continues!"},{"name":"Pancake Social","address":"675 Ponce De Leon Ave NE, Ste 185","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"We knew that we might have a long wait for food when we went here on Mother's Day.

So, after waiting in line, which we expected..... suddenly a staff person appeared to tell the folks in line that \\"once you order you will have an hour to an hour and a half wait to get your food.\\" There is no waffle in the world that takes that long to prepare.

The 14% service charge for a self-service restaurant was interesting (you stand in line and place your order then go pick up your food when your buzzer goes off) and they still had tip jars. Kind of odd. Anyways, great quality, crispy fries and onion rings and amazing dessert. Definitely suggest the Marionberry Pie (google the berry!

I live in the area and had a chance to try out a couple of things last night on a whim.  \\n\\nFirst, the staff is outstandingly delightful.  Everyone was incredibly nice, and our server was very helpful and attentive.  The atmosphere is dramatically changed from the location's previous joints.  It looks much more upscale: high tables, nice leather seats, white table cloths, etc.\\n\\nIt was late, and they close at midnight.  So, we deciced to order a couple of plates to share.  The server explained the entire menu is pretty much meant to share.  I like this current trend in new establishments!\\n\\nSo, we shared the charred green onions with romanesco sauce - delicious!  So simple, but perfectly done and awesome flavor.  We also had the pastrami salmon with mustard-dill creme fraiche.  It was amazing! And the hands-down best dessert I've had in a long, long time: bananas foster beignets.  Holy cow... it's like a French toast/funnel cake - bread, stuffed with creme fraiche and bananas, deep-fried- and served with vanilla ice cream.  Out of this world!  The server told us we were the first people that night that were able to finish it. Ha!\\n\\nThe cocktails were good.  The spouse had a mezcal drink with ice that had sliced serranos frozen in it. (can't remember the name)  He said it was fantastic and ordered a second.  I had the Miss Piggy 'girly' cocktail.  It was good, but definitely flowery.  It bordered on tasting like rose water, which I wouldn't have been able to drink.  I enjoyed it enough, but I wouldn't get it again.  I ordered wine for a second drink.  They have great selections and a small, but nice selection of local beer on tap.\\n\\nGiven that this place is clearly known for pig, we failed to order something with swine!  The pork belly sounds incredible, and that's what I would suggest trying.\\n\\nThe menu is incredibly eclectic, but, like Contigo, I don't read the menu and immediately want to have everything.  I don't even know what many of the items are! With the samples we had last night, I have no doubt the rest of the food items are outstanding, but I find it a little overwhelming to choose off this menu.\\n\\nAlso, this is more a destination, which is odd for this location/area, and, while I wish them incredible success (and have no doubt they'll achieve that), I had hoped for more of a neighborhood pub.  It's a little more high-end than that.

My husband could eat here all the time but I sometimes leave here thinking, \\"why did I bother?\\"   Such was the case last night.  I ordered the pad Thai...I know, not a Chinese dish but it's on the menu.  I ordered it with shrimp and veggies..no chicken, and I asked that the chef use a light hand with the oil. Well, it was still too oily and some of the noodles were undercooked.  I ended up wishing I had selected something else. My husband got the buffet (Sundays only) and as always, was happy with the array of choices including select types of sushi.

BYOB - bring your own beer, grab a water cup from inside the restaurant and drink to your heart's content while waiting in line. Lord knows you'll need the alcohol to get through. There was enough seating for everyone inside so there was nothing to worry about on that front. Cool seafood truck outside was providing sweet potato chip samples. Felt bad for him. \\n\\nThe cons. We waited in line for almost 3 hours. We got to the restaurant at 11AM on a Sunday, and the line was out the door and snaked through their lines that they set up. Then it went to the edge of the building on the sidewalk. It didn't seem that long. Honestly, if we knew that's how long we were going to wait, then we would have waited for Franklin's. The operation is very inefficient. They have a single person cutting the meat, and the people there are pretty rude. I don't understand why they don't cut the meat faster. The faster they sell out, the faster they can get home. Makes no sense. I asked to just sample the chopped beef (not on the menu) and he said absolutely not. Before committing to buying a third of a pound of something, I just want to know what I'm getting and I feel like that's fair. I wasn't trying to sample everything on the menu. I also asked for lean brisket, and when I got it was definitely very fatty. My friends asked for the moist cuts and they looked the same. \\n\\nThat being said, the BBQ itself here is pretty garbage. I ended up getting the brisket and chopped beef. Everything is spicy. Not like a good spicy either, they just seem to have doused everything in black pepper for the hell of it. They ran out of three things (pork ribs, beef ribs and mac and cheese so those are probably the things you should actually get). The beans are trash. We were hungry still but there was no way we could eat the beans. My friend had the pickles and he did not finish that either. He said they were too vinegary for even him. \\n\\nHonestly, we went to Terry Black's the day before, and had a way better experience, and way better food.

There's a few tables outside and they're right next to Fields Park and other parks to hang out with your drink.\\n\\nThey put \\"dried honey\\" (crystallized honey - looks like sugar) on top of some drinks (like pistachio steamer, Moroccan latte). Pistachio (almond milk) latte is one of the most popular drinks. It was so yummy - super sweet to me but not any sweeter than a Starbucks. I don't regularly drink sweet things and I'm sensitive to sugar so I have to drink in doses to avoid a headache. If you get mochas or drink soda, the sugar level is fine."},{"name":"Al Wadi","address":"1249 Vfw Pkwy","city":"West Roxbury","stars":"4","text":"Went here for Mother's Day with my mother and grandmother.

I've also had the yuzu blueberry cheesecake, which is rich and creamy - really delectable - as well as the matcha molten lava cake. The lava cake is incredible - rich matcha filling spills out as you cut into the slightly crispy chocolate cake exterior. Their service is slow at night in their restaurant portion although the waiters are really nice. Pricing wise, ~$6 for a normal sized drink definitely is pricey, but it's good quality matcha. Desserts at $10-12 is somewhat fair considering other high end dessert places, although certainly on the high side. \\n\\nOverall I'd say just stick to the cafe during the day and get the classic drinks like matcha tea latte.

So we go right in.  I had been here a very long time ago and it was alright.  Good Korean food is very hard to come by in town.  Here would definitely be at the top of the list for good stuff.  They use good cuts for their Kalbi and Pork.  Since the last visit they have renovated a little bit so it got a slight facelift.  The restaurant stays pretty packed, especially on the weekends.  The food was good and the service was nice but the prices are a little steep.  The sides were a little older than I am used to.  They were still alright but not as fresh as I would prefer.  My wife is Korean and I have spend several years in Korea so I am slightly biased as to great Korean food, and I can also appreciate how hard it is to get fresh Korean ingredients.  I keep that in mind.  \\n\\nOverall, if you are looking for the best Korean in town this does the trick.

It took about an hour to get in. \\n\\nI still haven't gotten around to trying everything on the menu, but I started out with the regular chicken sandwich, which is good. It's better with mayo or sauce. I like it with the chick fil a sauce. Hubby gets a spicy one and add buffalo. My favorite is the chicken wrap. I like the buttermilk ranch better than the garlic. Next time I will try the BBQ. \\n\\nI really like that they have Diet Lemonade,but I wish they sweetened it with stevia instead of artificial sweeteners. \\n\\nThe waffle fries are very good, but a little bit bland.

Reservations were made two weeks prior to the event for a party of 8; admittedly a miscalculation on my part by one person. Nonetheless, seven out of nine people arrived at the restaurant on time but we were told that we could not be seated until our entire party was present. The balloons that were brought for the birthday girl were immediately taken with promises that they would be returned upon our departure; I suppose balloons are not allowed in the establishment. Our remaining guest finally arrived but we were seated with the assumption that there were eight people at a very small table, probably intended for 6. Our waitress for the evening, named Dionne, approached us and mentioned how the table was meant for 8 people and the extra guest would require the staff to set up another table. We could all sense a little bit of an attitude/irritation but we decided to ignore it. After about 10 minutes or so, she motioned for us to come to the new table, which was much more comfortable. Dionne briefly introduced herself and began explaining how orders were going to be taken. She inappropriately commanded everyone's attention and stated that \\"...{she} was only going to go over the menu once\\".\\nDionne proceeded to take everyone's drink and dinner order, with an attitude. Drinks were served immediately, and food was served 25 to 30 minutes later. We proceed to eat our meal and when finished, members of the waiting staff approached the table asking if they could box up any remaining leftovers. Unfortunately, my food was taken to the back to be boxed up and never returned; something that I didn't realize until the check came. Next, the cake was presented to the table, we song Happy Birthday, and Dionne returned to the table to take the cake to the kitchen to be cut. The dinner check was brought out along with a $27 \\"outside dessert fee\\" check ($25 plus tax). A friend was puzzled by the added tax and simply question Dionne on the policy. VERY defensively, Dionne replied, \\"This is a Georgia law and has nothing to do with our restaurant; it's a Georgia tax\\" and then she walked away. In shock my friend waited for Dionne to return and apologetically explained her confusion about the tax while questioning the reason for Dionne's poor attitude. Dionne replied, \\"Oh, we're really going to do this tonight at 12:00 in the morning?!? You guys have had excellent service, on top of the fact that you were late! Do you really want to take it in there???\\" At this point Dionne has gotten the attention of the entire table! We stopped at this moment and immediately requested for the manager. The manager, Adriano Ferrucci, approaches the table but unfortunately, didn't help to make the situation any better. He provided NOTHING but excuses for Dionne's horrible attitude. At this point, the entire table is upset. The waitress takes about 15 to 20 minutes to even come back to the table to gather the money and provide change to people that had cash...\\nTo sum up this horrible experience, Dionne could care less about tending to the problem of trying to retrieve my missing food and overall the birthday dinner was RUINED! We paid and left.\\nThis was my first visit to American Cut Steakhouse and my LAST! Atlanta has multiple amazing steakhouses that have provided me with amazing customer service.

Fortunately, the ordering system on the iPad was easy enough to understand and pay - kind of like a self check out at the grocery store. The food portions were hugeeeee given that i only our 6-7$ for the food. I appreciate the good mix of vegetables and meat, both of good portions. The meat was chunky and huge, but a little dry, especially cause the spicy mayo was very insufficient (note that I even asked for more too). The broccoli was a little undercooked for my liking.

Then when I went to add a tip to my order, it didn't even give me the option to. Basically, the owner is asking for a 14% service charge, not allowing tips on the card, and not paying out anything from this extra charge to his employees. Except for the cash tips that you put in a communal cup at the front. Who carries cash on them anymore? Hardly anyone. That's just wrong and cheap as hell.

The menu offers interesting takes on a wide array of nicely prepared proteins, along with attractive appetizers and dessert options. You could definitely drop by for dinner on a weeknight and spend less than 20 dollars a person for a quality plate of food, or spend over 50 bucks trying out some of the great things they have on the menu and leave stuffed to the brim.\\n\\nMy dinner was something in between those two extremes. We started out with the duck fat fries and the brussel sprouts. The duck fat fries were perfectly cooked and flavorful, served with sous vide runny-yolk eggs and a cold b√©arnaise sauce. Overall a very rich but tasty dish with a huge portion. It could have definitely benefited from some sort of spice or acid component, though. The brussel sprouts that people recommend trying are essentially deep fried individual brussel sprout leaves, and I was much less impressed with the portion for this plate. Overall a tasty dish and a unique appetizer to split, but somewhat greasy.\\n\\nFor the main course I was able to try their pork belly and a beef cheek special they had on the menu. The pork belly was wonderfully crusted with a peppery seasoning and was juicy and tender. It was served over a bed of vinegary collard greens, which provided some much-needed acid to cut through the richness of the meaty but melty pork belly. My favorite dish was definitely the beef cheeks, though, which were fork-tender and served with mustard mashed potatoes. The plates are well-put together with lots of balanced flavor. The meal was a bit on the heavy end but the food was very tasty.\\n\\nDidn't get a chance to stay for dessert but the options looked interesting enough.

The burger was very filling and the onion rings and chicken tenders were both deliciously crispy and warm. I will say that the jalape√±o slaw was nothing special and should be passed up for fries or the like, but I came here for a burger, so I didn't mind so much. We came here for happy hour (which is from 3-6PM every day I believe) and got good deals on sides, so that's how we ended up getting more than just a burger here. \\n\\nAs others have mentioned you do have to bus your own table and the music does get pretty loud.

We got to sit at the booths which seemed almost a little snug for even 2 people per side. Happy Day is a Hong Kong Style Cafe that serves HK style diner food. A unique item on the menu seems to be a pineapple bun sandwich. They offer mainly rice and noodle dishes and some dessert options as well. Beverage menu is a bit limited.  \\n\\nWe sat down and the menu was given to us right away. Server came back pouring tea without saying a word and we had asked for some iced waters as well since it was a hot day. Server seemed annoyed with the request since she had already poured the tea. We asked for 3 cups of water and she rolled her eyes and left. \\n\\nSo then we're looking at the menu, and I decided to go for a DIY Noodle combo which was $12.95 for a noodle of your choice with soup + 2 toppings + a drink. Additional toppings were $1.95 ea. I got an original fish soup with flat rice noodles, fish cakes, mushrooms, cabbage, bean curd, and sliced pumpkin with a cold Ovaltine (cold drinks are also an additional $1, but for hot it's included in the pricing). This was an absolute disappointment to me as the fish soup was absolutely bland. I'd rather go to Deer Garden wish has more flavour and options for toppings and would be worth my money. \\n\\nTo be fair, the price is completely reasonable for the portion you get for SOME items. While my noodles came in a massive bowl, my friends who ordered a baked pork chop for $12.95 had probably eaten a lot less than what I got and he was still hungry afterwards. \\n\\nNow the reason I'm giving it a one star is because the service was by far the worst I've ever experienced. I'm hesitant to speak Cantonese in restaurants like these because it's usually met with impatient responses and a rude attitude. Our server only came by to drop off food but otherwise left us alone which is fine. We had our water refilled once but that was about it. We stayed for maybe close to 2 hours or so and out of nowhere, we had noticed they placed a \\"Reserved\\" sign on our table as a signal for us to leave. \\n\\nWhen it came to the bill, I noticed it wasn't separated and for some reason. I don't carry cash with me very often so I was hoping they could take a debit card, which my friend said I should be able to since he paid with his last time. However, while we were figuring out how to pay, the server walked over again and looked down at our bill and loudly yelled in Cantonese \\"THEY'RE NOT READY YET\\" in a very annoyed tone and just walked away. So when we went up to the counter to pay, they didn't accept debit even though there was literally a sign that said cash and debit accepted? Now we were figuring out how to pay by cash and the cashier lady didn't look impressed with how we were trying to figure it out and just sat there rolling her eyes and sighing impatiently. We ended up tipping $5 afterwards and she looked pretty angry but the service wasn't really worth a tip at all. \\n\\nWould not come back here based on how terrible the servers act when they barely provide service and expect a large tip."},{"name":"Espadas de Brazil","address":"2512 Rio Grande St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I got the Picanha sandwich and it was amazing!

When we walked in, I immediately noticed the pickle bar, clean look, pies, and jars of food for sale. You order at the front and sit down. Instead, we took menus and sat down to decide what to eat. I chose the fried fish, my mom chose the chicken salad sandwich I believe and we also got fried chicken for the kids. I imagined a filet of fish and was a little scared that $12 wouldn't get me much. I went to the pickle bar to look around as we waited. So many pickles to try plus cabbage! I grabbed all that I could. The sign says all customers can have some so we took advantage of that and grabbed several and relaxed. The food came out steaming hot. To my excitement, I didn't get a filet of fish but instead two large fried steaks of fish. They were thick too. I tried the sauces on the table and they both enhanced the flavor though the fish was seasoned well. It's better if you fish the fish in the sauce rather that squirt it all over. The crust will come off. The green beans were great too. They may have needed some extra bacon grease or maybe even pepper but still good. I forgot to mention the sodas. The sodas that many Austin restaurants sell are here too. They have sugar instead of corn syrup and then they also have a cucumber watermelon juice that was so good we kept getting up for more. Most of the time I don't go after sugary treats but I had to make an except for that. I'll also have to make an exception flit try their pies.

Helen's Asian Kitchen is by far the best Chinese restaurant in Columbus that is located in a former strip club. Indeed, if I may be so bold, it's the best Chinese restaurant located in a former strip club ANYWHERE.\\n\\nThe first thing that anyone who has visited Helen's will tell you to get is their dumplings. We've never had a bad one, but if you can get only one style make sure to try the soup dumplings. Filled with delicious broth, they require a bite-and-slurp when eating. Otherwise, you're apt to get hot delicious juice all over the place. Once you try them, you'll understand why people eagerly sign up for Helen's dumpling making classes at The Commissary. \\n\\nThe dishes off the \\"Chinese menu\\" (as opposed to the \\"American\\" one) are also top notch. They have some really great Sichuan entrees. If you're craving that numbing mala sensation, definitely get the cauliflower dish or the chicken and chili peppers (note, there are two chicken and pepper entrees. One has bone-in chicken pieces. So double check to make sure you're getting the one that you want.)  We also like the pork in garlic sauce, it's a nice mild compliment to the spicier options. \\n\\nFinally, we've had great service at Helen's as well. They've always patiently walked us through the menu options and explained dishes when the names haven't been enough to give us an idea of what they'd be like.

The whole family loves the way it is served over an open flame, and although it's loaded with peppercorns and hop peppers, it doesn't overwhelm my sensitivity to spicy foods. The kiddos love the shrimp dumplings, but I could take them or leave them. What they do especially well is making stuff you've had, better than you've had it. I ordered the mala beans tonight and there was so much flavor, brought to you by subtle nuances of sesame, soy, and a bits of other unidentifiable flavors that make it unboring.

I had to fly to Austin to get good barbecue and La Barbecue made my trip worth it.  La Barbecue is one of the many trailers in Austin that cooks and sells food out of a trailer.  A very cool concept.  And, man, some of the trailers get it right.  I was in Austin for only a couple of days.  So, I didn't have time to stand in line for six hours at Franklin Barbecue (which is world famous) and I chose to stand in line for about 45 minutes at La Barbecue.  I had heard that La Barbecue was as good.  And, it was well worth the wait in line.\\n\\nI finally got up to the ordering counter about 12:30 pm and they were already out of the beef ribs which was disappointing having traveled cross country to try them.  Bummer!  I ordered the brisket, the pork spare ribs and the buttermilk bacon potato salad.  Holy smokes!  Literally.  The barbecue was phenomenal.  The brisket was moist and had just the right amount of wood smoked flavor.  Outstanding.  The pork spare ribs were porky, moist and had just the right amount of smoky flavor.  They were exceptional.  Notice the red smoke ring on the meat in my photo's.  Barbecue nirvana.  They provide bottles of sauce on the communal picnic tables.  One that is vinegary and another that is a little sweeter and tomato based.\\n\\nThey do their barbecue right here.  They barbecue the meats and smoke them to perfection not dousing them with a sauce and hiding their meaty flavors.  Here in Southern California, they douse the meat in usually bad barbecue sauce and hide the taste and/or quality of the meat (it makes you wonder why the meat is being hidden).  The meat should be the standout and the star.  And, if you want to add sauce, you can add your preferable amount of sauce.\\n\\nI also ordered the buttermilk bacon potato salad as a side which was exceptional and delicious.  Chunks of smoky bacon and creamy potato salad.\\n\\nI live in Southern California and there are several barbecue restaurants in the area.  None of which come close to the barbecue joints in Austin.  They just don't get it in So Cal.  \\n\\nBut, wow, they get it in Austin!  Holy cow!  Holy beef!

I haven't tried the real \\"cronut\\" made in New York yet, but I have tried Secret Location's cronut and it is much better than Swiss Bakery's frissant.  \\n\\nWe shared the chocolate frissant and the espresso frissant, and both were sub-par pastries.  It was simply too oily and the cream was not good.  The coffee flavoured cream  was very bitter and it tasted like it was made from cheap instant coffee.  \\n\\nAnyways, we also tried their pretzels and cream puffs and they were not good either.  I could barely bite through the pretzel and while the swan-shaped cream puff was nice to look at, it was horrible to eat.

It's a rather large location, which is useful considering it's located on I-Drive.  They have plenty of TVs scattered about the place, so if you're planning on watching a game, you can probably catch it here.\\n\\nFOOD & DRINKS (4/5): Yes.  I had a Long-legged Long Island, one of their signature drinks.  For food, a friend and I split some nachos.  While I wasn't in the mood for wings, I managed to try a wing - not too shabby. Their fish tacos (with mahi mahi) were actually pretty decent.  This isn't going to be anything special, if that's what you're looking for.  When you go to Hooters, you're paying for the environment. It's not exactly five star cuisine.\\n\\nSERVICE (5/5): Our server was fantastic!  She managed to keep our glasses full (without being too pushy), which I'm sure helped with tipping purposes.

Just in case you stop reading my review right about here...... at least you will know about the amazing HH.  Now, onto the review......... \\n\\nI have been busting at the seams to try this place.  So last night while trying to decide where to go to watch the 'Zers play (and beat GS in OT I might add!) this place popped up on my bookmarked list and it was a no brainer.  They have, I think, three TVs behind the bar, so catching the Blazer game was no problem.  There was a RIDICULOUS line of people trying to order their food. The line was backed up out the door. This made me sad.......for about 1 minute.  My boyfriend realized we could just go sit at the bar and order there.  Why were all these people not doing that?  There was plenty of seating, so that was not a problem.  Outside seating too! They were playing house/techno'ish music the whole time we were there.  I am just one opinion but...... really? For a restaurant? At 5pm? I was not a fan of the music decisions.  (Caveat: Even if you order at the bar, you will still be given a buzzer and when your food is ready you will have to go pick it up yourself.  This isn't a problem, unless you're pretty lazy).\\n\\nSo, let's talk about the food. I had the Freebird (fried chicken, bacon, Swiss, house slaw).  This chicken burger was good and I would totally eat it again..... but it did not blow my socks off.  I was really expecting it to.  It seemed a little.... bland.  I was hoping for some spice or more jalape√±o in the slaw.  Oh well.  For $9 it was a pretty good sized burger and again, it WAS good.  My expectations were just really high I guess. My boyfriend had the Carne Jefe burger.  There was a lot going on there.  He seemed to enjoy it.  He picked off all the jalape√±os, and there were a lot to pick off (maybe we should have switched burgers?).  We had both the bacon tots and the jalapeno tots.  The bacon tots were disappointing.  There was really no flavor to them at all.  But hey, it's just one item.  They weren't gross or anything, just not something to write home about. \\n\\nThey have A LOT of liquor options.  They also have a nice variety of canned beers as well as the on tap stuff. Again, reasonable prices.  I did not have any pie (we walked down to Salt & Straw instead), but I will have pie on my next visit.  It all looked pretty amazing. \\n\\nI began this review thinking I would only give them three stars because none of the food blew me away, but after writing it I realized that everything else was pretty great and 3 stars really would not do them justice."},{"name":"Zaalook","address":"12 SW 4th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"It was our first night in Portland and we got in pretty late.

Usually restaurants that are attached to hotels are small but I found that this was relatively large in comparison, antique in design and beautifully decorated, with paintings and d√©cor that was set perfectly under spot lights, also a grand piano centered in the restaurant (with a pianist playing live music all night!). \\n\\nThe 3 options I opted for from the dine out menu was: a creamy tomato soup, whipped fromage Blanc w olive oil + the crispy duck confit + the passion fruit cr√®me br√ªl√©e. French food is already my favorite and everything on this menu catered perfectly to my preference. Prior to receiving our appetizers, we received a complimentary deep fried cheese ball.. potato..? I'm not too sure what it was to be honest but it was still tasty. Before our entrees arrived, we were approached by a waiter who had a basket of bread with an assortment of different miniature loaves to choose from. I loved this, it made the restaurant seem a lot more inviting and definitely differed from the usual bread served right away on a plate to your table after ordering. No complaints about the food or plating, everything was perfect, and surprisingly filling as well. \\n\\nTheir liquor menu was quite extensive, ranging in their wines, champagnes, beers, cocktails, and mock tails. I would highly recommend their Macadamia Nut Sour ($12.50) from their featured cocktail list, it's honestly probably the best cocktail I've ever had. I also tried their Pomegranate Cosmo ($15) and didn't enjoy it as much. This almost tasted medicinal to me, however, that's just a personal preference. \\n\\nI was mostly impressed by how Bacchus managed to accommodate for my plating request on the dessert during dine out, when restaurants are busiest. My boyfriend had just gotten a promotion and they plated his dessert in the most beautiful way. \\n\\nAll in all, I had high expectations for the restaurant after seeing all the posts that tempted me to come visit in the first place but upon dining here myself, I can easily say this night surpassed all my expectations and I will definitely be recommending this restaurant and will definitely be back to dine from their actual menu!"},{"name":"Carmelina's","address":"307 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"We went to this restaurant specifically for their \\"warm bread\\" posted on everyone's yelp review.  We were supremely disappointed. Our rolls were cold and they didn't even taste good. We did ask for more(because you only get 2 and it comes with a olive oil/vinegar dipping sauce) and the second one was warm, but still didn't taste good.  In the North end you expect amazingly fresh bread and a dipping sauce of olive oil with herbs or parmesan cheese.  Bread rant over... the food. The chicken dishes, chicken marsala and piccata DON'T COME WITH PASTA! WHAT?! So we ordered another pasta dish which was good but it was $18 and really small(see picture). There are other restaurants in the North end that cost less and serve you a larger portion.

A quick check on Yelp helped seal the deal and we were looking forward to a great meal.\\n\\nArtichoke Saffron Risotto was very tasty with an excellent blend of flavors.  I love risotto so I knew I would enjoy this.  Then I had the Beef Tenderloin with broccoli puree as my main.  While the beef was cooked perfectly and tasted absolutely wonderful, I was not a fan of the broccoli puree.  Most likely a textural thing, but it just wasn't my favorite.  And the two potato pieces on the plate had zero seasoning on them, which made me sad cuz potatoes are LIFE.\\n\\nHubby's lobster fettuccine was cooked correctly, pasta-wise, but the broth lacked flavor/seasoning.  Nothing a good shot of salt wouldn't fix.\\n\\nWe did decide to go for some dessert as they have Sticky Toffee Pudding on the menu which is my husband's favorite.  This was mostly good; it was more like a cake dessert than a bread pudding and the caramel corn had some stale/chewy pieces in it.  Plus, it need a bigger punch of the caramel sauce.  However, we enjoyed it and would order it again.\\n\\nOverall, this was a hit and miss for us.  The restaurant has a lovely atmosphere and the service was phenomenal.  Presentation of the food was a bit dated and missed the mark somewhat, but this is just our experience (and a rare one at that).  We would definitely come back here to try more of the menu though.

Both have really delicious banh mi and whenever I'm in the area, I make a point of stopping at one or the other to have a sandwich and likely take one for the road to Providence.\\nWhere Chau Bakery gets the edge over Banh Mi Ba Le is the sandwich bread. Both places have fresh bread baked the same day but at Chau Bakery it is a little fatter in the middle, crisper on the outside, and fluffier in the inside. Also, most times the bread is still warm from being freshly baked, not being reheated in an oven to crisp. The way Chau Bakery makes its bread is why if I choose to take a sandwich home rather than eat it in house, 2 out of 3 times I'll choose Chau. The freshness of the bread is key to banh mi and having the bread even be just a couple hours fresher makes a big difference in taste when I do take out. \\nOther notes: the workers speak English, they're just soft spoken. The wall has the sandwich choices and right now it costs $4, a steal for the level of quality and detail that goes into making banh mi.

When we stated we were going to leave, you would at least expect him to apologize, or give a reason for this pathetic excuse for service. No, we just got an \\"okay\\". Okay?!

The waitress was very friendly and attentive. My wife wasn't sure what she wanted, and the waitress had really cool suggestions and ended up bringing her something that she really liked (it had cake flavored vodka in it). We ordered the Spinners fries, which are essentially chili cheese fries, and they were amazing. After a couple drinks each and an appetizer, our tab was pretty reasonable (just under $20 pre-tip).\\n\\nIt wasn't until after we left that things went sour. My wife watches our finances like a hawk, and when the charge from Spinners came through it was $126. I went in to the restaurant shortly after and asked if I could talk to a manager about the charge. I was pleased to see that the manager on duty was actually our waitress from that night. When I showed her the charge though, instead of saying something along the line of \\"Omg I'm so sorry I don't know that happened\\" her response was  \\"No, that's what you tipped. I remember.\\" \\n\\nSeriously?? Why would I give a $100 tip and then come in and complain about the charge? Obviously, even if that's what was on the check, if I'm in the restaurant complaining about the charge I wasn't the one who wrote it. After a little bit of arguing, she reluctantly handed me a $100 bill out of the register. There's no way to know for sure whether she slipped a 1 in front of our total or some other patron thought it would be funny. It's not like we stiffed her (~$6 on a ~$20 tab is pretty nice). It's also not like we were being loud and angering any of the neighboring tables.\\n\\nAt best, Spinners needs to do a better job handing checks and clearing tables quickly. At worst, they have some corrupt workers there who aren't afraid to steal from patrons. In either case, they need to do a better job handling complaints about such overcharges.\\n\\nI was pretty sad about this because other than that I really enjoyed my trip here. I would recommend checking it out if you're looking for a bar with good prices and good food, but make sure to put a ----- in front of the total on your check."},{"name":"Chameleon Restaurant & Bar","address":"2000 NE 40th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Had grilled salmon for dinner today Dec.18, 2019 and was happy about it.

For Texas and the insane heat, there should have been ice readily available. I never received my tall glass of ice water. I must have drank a whole bottle of that water and then some more.

In Italy they pour the glass of wine in front of you even when you order a single glass. Not here. I didn't enjoy the wine at all. The menu listed it as ruby red and this was a foggy sort of light, light, nearly rose color. I don't mind paying for a good glass of wine but don't appreciate being misled or.......\\n\\nWe had the spicy shrimp appetizer and I am not exaggerating - It was about 4 shrimp in a spicy red sauce on a bed of SOGGY angel hair pasta. What was strange was the shrimp were so tough it was difficult to cut them with a knife. I don't recommend this dish. It was awful. The complimentary bread was fine but the olive oil was thin and weak. Not hearty, fruity and green. \\n\\nNext, I had the pan grilled chicken with rosemary and garlic and artichoke. This dish was simply a thick, tough, grilled chicken breast with not a drop of sauce. Did I say dry, bland, chewy, zero sauce? I tasted no garlic or rosemary or anything else. I was super dissatisfied. It was inedible. It truly was leather. \\n\\nMy husband had the carbonara and I will say the pasta was prepared correctly. It was flavorful and gets 3 1/2 out of 5. I'm beginning to look at little Italy as more of a tourist trap. I'm not sure who's doing the cooking but it's sloppy and inexcusable. We travel and have traveled Italy extensively. We have dined from the north coast to the south coast and this does not compare. What I will say is they cooked the pasta nearly perfect for the carbonara.\\n\\nWhat was really funny? Half way through our meal the host asked if we would move to a high top table because the folks sitting at their table didn't like their table. Don't do that to a customer with a mouth full of food! \\n\\nPerhaps I had the wrong dish and should have ordered pasta? But it's not difficult to pound the chicken with a mallet, then coat it in flour. You then saut√© it in butter, garlic, rosemary, lemon and add lots of artichoke. Add a little cream if you like.

Good job!\\n\\nHowever, the Kaiser roll bun was only fair.  It was dried out - and - more generally speaking Kaiser rolls are not suitable as hamburger buns.

I highly suggest going on a day that is less busy like Mondays and Thursday morning and let me tell you why. I'm a vegetarian so I'm careful when I order food from a place that serves up a great deal of meat. I ordered a vegetarian burrito. It came with all of the veggies, sour cream, and avocado. When I was half way done with the burrito I bite into a piece of PORK BACON.

Surprisingly, the place was empty.  Not a good omen. The waitress (possibly part owner) cheerfully greeted us and sat us at a booth.  She went over all of the specials and showed us where the kids menu was for our daughter.  \\nShortly after we placed our order, the waitress noticed something we had saw on the way in.  The Reynoldsburg Police was setting up a DUI checkpoint on Livingston Rd, right in front of the restaurant.  And even worse, the Police had taken over most of the parking lot of the strip mall to do more extensive checking or something.  The waitress became livid saying that the police was driving away their customers and that the restaurant would normally be packed if it wasn't for the checkpoint.  Now, I don't know what impact it actually had on their business, that night, and I will admit, it was a bit tricky getting out because the police had coned off so much of the parking lot.  I do think the police probably should've done a few to go orders just to make up any potential impact.\\nAnyways, the waitress brings out my wife's hamburger because she didn't want it to get cold.  A few minutes later, she brought out my daughter's chicken tenders.  Then a few minutes my chicken cordon bleu melt.  The waitress says they were breaking in a new cook and that he had messed up my order so the extra delay was him remaking my food.  Despite the delay, I found my melt to be quite good.  I was expecting them to use sliced chicken, but they used grilled chicken tenders, topped with ham and swiss and then grilled on the bread.  The use of chicken tenders was quite original in my opinion and really improved the sandwich, especially with how tender it was.  My daughter enjoyed her fried tenders.  Wife said the burger was ok.  \\nWhile we were eating, we could hear the waitress complain about the cook to another woman (hostess?  Part owner?) about how the cook always makes mistakes.  The cook argued back a bit.  All of this within ear shot of the entire restaurant (granted we were the only ones in it.)  \\nI do think this place has the potential to be really good, but they need to resolve their issues with the cook (and there were already signs on the door saying they were hiring a part time cook.)  They need someone who can not only cook well, and get orders right, but also be able to get an entire table's food ready at once.

We came on a Sunday night and it wasn't overly packed, lots of tables open for walk-ins. The atmosphere was pretty cool, with a few tables inside and then covered patio space with the outdoor patio as well. \\n\\nWe ordered the truffled bacon deviled eggs - they were thick and creamy. I couldn't really taste the truffle and there were a few pieces of bacon bits mixed in but nothing out of the ordinary. They were what you would expect of the typical deviled eggs.\\n\\nThe tuna duo was a tuna ceviche served on a chip with guacamole. It was good but the chip ended up soggy after sitting on the plate and it was hard to pick up and eat. \\n\\nThe fried brussel sprouts leaves were ok, they sort of tasted like burnt kettle corn popcorn. Slightly sweet but the burnt flavors linger after you eat them. \\n\\nThe duck fat fries with the poached egg on top. I can't say this dish was anything but normal fries with an egg on top. Nothing special here either. The bearnaise sauce it came with was sweet. I'm not sure what they were trying to accomplish with the sauce but nobody at the table liked it and we requested ketchup instead to go with the fries.\\n\\nThe candied pork belly was good. You definitely can't go to a restaurant named Salty Sow and not get some swine! The pork belly was not as fatty and normal pork belly and cooked right, it was soft and decadent. It came over a bed of braised greens, which the bf enjoyed but I wasn't a fan of. \\n\\nWe also ordered the banana Foster beignets cause everyone raved about it in their reviews and the server said it was crack. Whoa! These were extra large beignets - the dish was a meal in itself. I have to say the fried grease and the sugar overwhelmed the dish so you can't taste the banana Foster flavor. The beignets were indeed very crispy and served with some cinnamon ice cream. It might've been one of the better dishes of the night.\\n\\nOverall, I was a bit disappointed with the reviews and my experience here.

I've been here a handful to times and haven't gotten the bread (yet), but I have tried a bunch of their sweet treats. \\n\\nTheir prices are great...compared to the North End - probably half to a third cheaper. \\n\\nHere's what I've tried, and check the pics I've posted to go along with this:\\n\\n- Cream cheese danish ($1) - it's good, but there could be a little more cream cheese. The danish part is soft and has a drizzle of frosting on it.\\n\\n- Assorted cookie bag ($1) - 7 cookies. The blue sprinkled egg shaped cookies ARE SO GOOD.  They are a little soft, not what I would have expected based on the type of cookie, but it is only that much better. And sprinkles only make it better. The pink cookie half covered in chocolate is SO FLAVORFUL. I didn't expect much from just looking at it but it's packed with flavor. There is also a chocolate covered cookie with a jellybean on top. \\n\\n- Chocolate croissant ($1.25) - large crescent shaped croissant filled with milk chocolate. This croissant is bigger and cheaper than Starbucks' chocolate croissant, which is fantastic...more bang for your buck. Also, the chocolate is creamier...like it's not a hard chocolate since it's been melted into the croissant. \\n\\n- Apple scone type treat ($1.25)  - I don't know the name of this, and couldn't pronounce it for you after hearing the woman say it. It looks like a calzone, but it has a fruit filling inside. The calzone shell is a pretty hearty cookie, not flaky like an apple turnover shell.\\n\\n- Canolli ($1) - haven't tried these but my friends say they are good.\\n\\nBOTTOM LINE: If you're in the area, and have a hankering for something sweet, stop by A & L.  It's a nice small bakery with great prices.  I want to try the black and white (75 cents) and their other cookie (50 cents) that's probably a little smaller than my hand."},{"name":"The Wine Bistro","address":"1750 Lane Ave","city":"Upper Arlington","stars":"4","text":"So my girlfriend and I came here for restaurant week excited to try out the menu, but ended up leaving with empty stomachs.

We were sitting there for at least 30 minutes after receiving the bottle of wine without even getting to put in our appetizer order. At this point we didn't want to have to wait for our food to come out even if the server came to take our orders.

At first when I saw we were going to be outside I was disappointed (the inside is very moody and romantic) but the patio has its own charming ambience with little lights and greenery. Our waiter appeared almost immediately to refresh us with water and get us started with any questions, then returned after a perfect amount of time to get us started with drinks and something to eat. \\n\\nWe, being in a particularly indulgent mood, fretted over whether to get any number of things from the evening's special charcuterie board to the truffled deviled eggs, but ultimately settled on the bone marrow and duck fat fries. We could not have been more pleased (or indulged!) in our selections. The bone marrow was hot and slick and surprisingly ample, two marrow bones served with two thick rounds of bread and some parsley puree on the side. I worried that the gruyere would be overwhelming to the fatty, almost diaphanous marrow but whoever selected this gruyere in particular was a genius because its nuttiness only served to amplify the richness of the marrow, not overtake it. The duck fat fries were equally decadent, though perhaps a bit more accessible for those who find themselves intimidated by bone marrow. These triple-fried pillows of divinity are so perfectly handled that they need no accompaniments, yet the soft egg and cold b√©arnaise each elevated what is normally a pedestrian snack to the upper echelons of culinary achievement. And make no mistake, the fries are no \\"small plate\\" - after sopping up the remaining marrow with the last of the duck fat fries, we could have called it a day. But what can I say, we're gluttons AND overachievers.\\n\\nSo we each got a large plate as well - he, the duck, me, the pork belly. The pork belly was crusted in a complex, fiery sheath of spices that cut through the thin but rich broth and paired wonderfully with the silky collard greens. The duck breast was cooked to rare perfection and a lean, meaty vehicle for the sweet, sticky turnips and cured olives with their briny pop. The portions on each were exact so that each bite of protein could be enjoyed with the right amount of accoutrements. Needless to say we had no room remaining for dessert, but the combination of atmosphere, service, and culinary quality will have us returning to Salty Sow on our next trip to Austin."},{"name":"Hopdoddy Burger Bar","address":"9101 International Dr, Ste 1208","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"You wonder, should I go there?

This place is basically a mom and pop place and is very authentic. Food is cooked well, not too dry, not overcooked, great food. Most customers are Filipino and it seems this place brings back most of their customers and with good reason. The owner is very friendly and welcoming. Prices are pretty good in comparison with other places that I have been and everything is well deserving of checking out. One note is that they don't offer water as a free drink as they only do bottled water for $1 a piece which I did not enjoy but otherwise great place.\\n\\nFood: 4/5 \\n--Pork Adobo was good but I feel like I would have enjoyed the chicken more. It was flavorful and included a heaping of rice which is a great compliment with the adobo. The pansit was my favorite, noodles came with veggies and little pieces of chicken and shrimp. The bangus is a traditional Filipino dish that our friend recommended to try and it was good. Worth trying, personally I needed a little bit of fish sauce with it as it was bland but overall it was cooked well. There is almost no bones in it but be careful when eating it as I was able to pick out 1 or 2 bones. We devoured the three dishes and it left us filled and satisfied. \\n\\nPrice: 4/5 \\n--Pork Adobo $7.95\\n--Bangus $13.99\\n--Pansit $8.95 \\nTotal around $36 with tax and tip, filling meal for 2.\\n\\nAtmosphere: 4/5\\n--I wouldn't say the setting of this area is anything special. It is more of a local mom and pop restaurant from the looks of it. Kind of small maybe about 8 tables max from what I remember. \\n\\nService: 5/5\\n--Service was great. The manager/owner (I think) was very kind and asked us more about where we were from and thanked us for eating at the establishment. He was very friendly and that definitely made it very welcoming."},{"name":"Mimian Asian Grill","address":"7541 Sawmill Rd","city":"Dublin","stars":"5","text":"great food, served like an asian chipotle, except your food is cooked on the spot.

Heck, with 4 1/2 stars on yelp and waiting 3 hours in line, I wanted this to top my current favorite barbeque joint, Killens in Pearland, TX. Unfortunately, my experience here was disappointing. I didn't mentally or physically prepare myself for a 3 hour wait and that is nobody's fault but mine. I was standing on an empty stomach too which didn't help the wait go any faster. By the time we were sitting at a table with our food it was 1:41pm (3 hours later). This is the longest time I've ever waited in line for food and I can most certainly say it was not worth the wait. The brisket was just \\"okay\\". I don't get how there are many positive reviews on it. I needed to be constantly drinking something in order to eat it because it was so salty. The sausage was again \\"okay\\", never been a huge sausage fan. The pork rib on the other hand was delicously tender. Thanks goodness there was pork rib available as the beef rib sold out. Can you imagine my thoughts when we were only a few people behind to get the last of the beef rib? We were pretty disappointed as the beef rib looks to be the star of the show.. We tried just one side, the potato salad which is absolutely amazing! Definitely my favorite potato salad. Though the single serving for the potato salad is tiny. I guess we needed the next size up. I am pretty sure I would never come back here again. I think I would have been more than satisfied with a smaller barbeque joint like Black's BBQ, which had been recommended to me after I had eaten here. Heck, I'm wondering if I would have been more happy with the food waiting 4-5 hours at Franklins (Prepared with chairs, drinks, portable charger, etc of course)?!

It's a pretty weird concept. They serve barbecue but they also double up as a grocery store. This is one of the pricier barbecue places in Austin. I'm not incredibly familiar with BBQ prices, but we ordered a pint of potato salad, half a pound of brisket, half a pound of pork ribs, pickles, onions, and bread for about $40. \\n\\nThe meat itself is delicious. The brisket is just the right amount of fatty and lean. There are certain parts of the meat that are incredibly salty, so I'm not really sure if that's supposed to happen or if their seasoning is just inconsistent. The butcher was nice enough to give us two pieces of brisket to sample (both of which were also incredibly salty). The pork rib is really good too. The meat slides right off the bone. For the sides...they were pretty disappointing. My friend and I both love potato salad, but we should've sampled it before we got an entire pint of it. They just made it too acidic. They added too much vinegar, so it was pretty sour. I haven't had bad potato salad at many barbecue places in Austin, so it was a pretty big letdown. \\n\\nOverall, la Barbecue probably has some of the best barbecue I've had in Austin. The meat itself is superb, but the sides should also be good enough to balance out the meal. The prices don't really justify the taste either. Also...charging for pickles? Pretty absurd. They casually ask you if you want pickles and bread at the very end of the ordering process, but THEY DON'T TELL YOU IT COSTS EXTRA. I don't know what other place in Austin that charges for pickles that literally cost them $0.05 to make, so that's just crazy to me.

However, the meat tastes as if it was microwaved (chewy, cold/hot on some spots), the fried shrimp on the plate tastes like they fried it earlier, but then microwaved it. It had the strangest chewy cold outer texture, but it was like warm on the inside. Aside from all of that, my vermicelli is undercooked and chewy. After a few bites I decide to tell the server the truth when he asks how everything is. He kindly replaces it with something else. The something else was a bowl of soup. Nothing to write home about, though. \\n\\nOverall, I didn't like it both times and won't be back.

A bar?\\"\\nMK: \\"No - Lenin- LENIN!  Leningrad!\\"\\nMe: \\"Uhhh - 'kay... sure, I'll go\\"\\n\\nWhen I found out Lemongrass was actually a Vietnamese restaurant - I finally figured out why the name simply didn't compute in my head.  You mean there's Vietnamese joints that aren't named in the native or French tongue?  Honestly - this is a disturbing trend, in what other cuisine can I dine at a place named \\"Pho Bich Nga\\"?\\n\\nHere's a few other things that sets Lemongrass apart:\\n(1) They have a much more expansive menu than your usual Viet joint - I would say it rivals neighbour Hai Phong in selection.\\n(2) Service was awesome - the server came back and offered us additional chili peppers/veggies because they remember my tablemates, MK1 and MK2, from their last visit\\n(3) They accept Interac and Visa\\n\\nThe dining room is pretty clean - the only complaint is the poor selection of fluorescent light tubes which gave everything an eerie green glow.\\n\\nThe spring rolls were better than your usual Viet joint - big, crunchy and piping hot, more akin to the famed Bao Chau rolls.  The salad roll was pretty good too - but it was probably overhyped for me as the MKs were under the influence of grass on their last visit - and I'm not talking about the 'lemon' type.\\n\\nAs my per my usual litmus test, I got the large pho dac biet for about $8 - big bowl with a big dish of accompanying fresh veggies for a good price.  The broth was rich and flavourful - I could even see little bubbles of fat and marrow floating in my bowl and I didn't detect the slightest hint of MSG - one of the better broths in Vancouver in my opinion.  And the noodles were cooked to a satisfying chewy consistency.\\n\\nSo why not a higher score?  My pho dac biet was loaded up with the usual: tendon, tripe, beef balls and beef flank - unfortunately, the beef flank came completely submerged in the hot broth.  Part of the magic of pho is to cook your own rare beef flank by dunking the pink bits in the hot broth.  Unfortunately, I felt a bit robbed of this and got overdone beef instead - which was an instant star-dropper despite the great broth.  I recommend asking for the beef flank on the side - but to me, it's as silly as having to ask for your coffee 'hot' or your burger to have a 'patty'.\\n\\nAnyways - given the excellent broth, I would try Lemongrass again - even though I was expecting St. Petersburg."},{"name":"Life of Pie Pizza","address":"3632 N Williams Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Best deal in northeast Portland!

I upgraded my drink to a mango tequila sunrise, and we got the biscuits as a side. The food was overall very good, with one of the stars being the biscuits. They had a lovely scone-like texture and were served warm with jam and their version of clotted cream. My drink was surprisingly strong and very delicious. The ribs were well-seasoned and fell off the bone. The cheesy grits in the dish were just all right, but I'm not the biggest grits fan anyway. Overall a balanced dish that was well-done and pretty tasty. The carrot cake waffle was out of this world--whoever thought of putting carrot cake batter in a waffle press was truly a genius. The vanilla crepe was interesting and fairly good; the freeze-dried strawberries were a great touch, and I really enjoyed the mix of flavors.

The dishes are all large potions. \\nWe tried lamb skewer which is the best because of the proper spicy level. The dish fried pork is kind of sour but not bad.\\nNorth China is famous for its noodle product, so we tried their dumplings. The taste is not bad. However, the dumpling skins are obviously not hand made. \\nThe server was full of passion which is fantastic.

The fish is very fresh and made to order, I had the cod, the texture was very nice and flavorful. I cannot complain about the fish itself. Coleslaw was good too, no complaints there.\\n\\nHowever, the dredge on the fish was not seasoned very well, and likewise didn't stick to the fish particularly well. It seems like it was breaded with maybe flour, then an egg wash, then dredged, but was definitely under salted and lacked a discernible flavor profile. A beer batter would have a better texture and stick better honestly.\\nThe chips/fries are frozen crinkle cut fries with a texture exactly like you'd expect, not terribly crisp and kind of low effort.\\n\\nWhat really got to me was though, they serve Kraft tartar sauce, which is dreadful and just overall a bad sign. It's really not hard to make your own tartar sauce, and would really excuse the unseasoned fish if there was a house sauce.\\n\\nWhat confuses me is that of the 3 essential aspects to a purely fish and chips dedicated establishment, fish, chips, and tartar sauce, they only make one of them in house. I'm not sure why you'd dedicate a restaurant to fish and chips, but not make your chips, or the sauce for your fish. Cutting fries and making tartar sauce are inexpensive and easy tasks\\n\\n$11 plus tip for frozen (I'm guessing Sysco) crinkle cut fries, kraft tartar sauce and 3 pieces of unseasoned fish....

The catfish was cooked to a golden brown. There were no burnt oil patches. no hard crust from deep frying to long. The hush puppies were sweet and soft. The wings were flavored all the way through.

HunnyMilk is for the serious brunch-goer, the one that likes to carve out at least two hours out of their late morning to really, truly enjoy brunch. \\n\\nSeriously, you may be here for awhile. There was maybe a 45 minute  wait on Sunday morning and another 25 minutes for food to arrive BUT they have so many things for you to do while you wait! They have an etch-a-sketch, so many books, coloring pages and what blew my mind the most was that they even had a nintendo!!! Doin' it right here at HunnyMilk! \\n\\nFor brunch, I am always always struggling to decide if I want something sweet or savory. (I usually solve this problem by forcing whomever I brunch with to pick the taste-opposite of what I order, but this only works so many times. And sometimes, they don't wanna share!?) \\nAt HunnyMilk, you do not have this problem! Their menu is prix fixe, $24/person for one savory dish, one sweet dish + a drink. Alcohol is +$7 and sides are +$4. \\n\\nMy friend & I split everything (bless her) so we tried: \\n\\nGrapefruit Juice & Guava Juice - both tasted like they were fresh-squeezed/pressed and not artificial! Guava was definitely a lil sweeter but I really liked them both.\\n5/5 both\\n\\nDutch Baby Pancake - this was my first time trying a savory dutch baby pancake. It was a supremely satisfying brunch dish, composed of a cast-iron pancake (that'd be the dutch baby) stuffed with bacon, herbs and gruyere. You almost don't even need the salad - a citrusy salad w/ apple and pine nuts. \\n5/5\\n\\nBaked Egg Surprise - probably HunnyMilk's most popular dish, and for good reason! We both really, really enjoyed this but you know I'm still not too sure what this dish even was. It was comprised of squash, zucchini, hashbrowns, mushroom, onions, and \\"truffled hollandaise\\" (and eggs, I think????). Let me tell you about their hollandaise - it f'ed us up! This dish is not huge but their truffled hollandaise is so thick and rich it was so difficult to finish this! Is truffle just so rich that it makes you instantly full?  This dish looks tiny but is incredibly filling. If you order this, try to eat it before your sweet dish! \\n5/5\\n\\nFortune Cookie Waffle - a half waffle topped with raspberry puree, fresh raspberry, and fortune cookies. I wanted a waffle. I should have re-thought that when the only waffle on their menu was a \\"fortune cookie waffle\\". I really could have done without SO MUCH of the hard, crumbly cookie on my waffle. They did include an actual fortune though, that was cool!\\n3/5\\n\\nPoppy Seed Crepe - I don't love crepes but I did really like what they topped their crepe with! Key lime curd, coconut yogurt, coconut flakes white chocolate, blueberries, and my favorite - bruleed kiwi. That was some special kiwi. This was very much so a dessert \\"meal\\".\\n4/5\\n\\nOverall HunnyMilk was a super cool brunch experience. It is on the pricier side but they are tip-free so at least there's that. Another thing to note is that they are a pop-up, meaning they utilize the space of another restaurant, La Buca, so they're open on weekends only.

So, in no particular order.\\n\\n1) Part of a server's job is being able to read a table.  While waiting for drinks our server approached us twice asking if we were ready to order dinner.  Well, when the guests (4) are engaged in conversation and haven't even lifted the menu it should be evident that they're not ready to order.\\n\\n2) Drinks: take forever.  10+ minutes for a cocktail.  I appreciate that a well made drink takes a little longer, and it was a Friday night, however the restaurant wasn't full.  Then I watched the runner attempt to deliver the drinks to the table next to us who all had full cocktails.  Learning table numbers is something you learn on day 1 at a restaurant.  \\n\\n3) Wine.  I have an extensive collection and like to bring my own wine to dinner.  I expect to pay a corkage fee around $15-20.  I was informed by server, via the bartender, that they didn't have a license to open patron's wine.  I've never heard of such a thing before in any other state.  Now, I'm new to Colorado so perhaps there is such a law that is unique to Colorado.  But I did research on beverage laws and licenses in the state and most, if not all, deal with the sale and distribution of wine, liquor and beer.  I suspect they were lying or misinformed.  However, I'm willing to withhold judgment on the this point on the off chance that there is such a provision in Colorado's liquor laws.\\n\\n4) Appetizers.  We ordered the mushrooms and \\"Big Squid\\".  While tasty, the portions were laughable, especially for the price.  I don't equate quantity with value and wasn't expecting massive portions but they were quite tiny.  \\n\\n5) GF bread.  It's delicious, but it's $4 a serving.  I think you should be informed that there's an extra charge when you order it.  And especially when you order basket #2.  It wasn't the amount, we were all offended that the server didn't give us a head's up.  We would have still ordered the first, maybe not the 2nd, but either way we would have known before the bill arrived.  \\n\\n6) The weirdest thing happened at the end of our meal.  We had paid our tab and were wrapping up our apr√®s meal conversation when the server came over, grabbed the credit card folders, and then said \\"it's ok, we'll be here for awhile.\\"  Ok, it was 9:30 and the restaurant was winding down, but then why did she feel the need to take the CC slips from us?  That's a cue to \\"get out of here.\\"  We were minutes away from departing the table anyway.

We got the lunch combo where you get to choose a main and a side! What we tried the NIKU which is their signature mazesoba dish. We also tried their MENTAIKO CREAM which tastes a little bit like alfredo. Once you're done with the noodles, they give you a free bowl of rice to mix in the rest of the sauce and toppings to eat. They have chili flakes on the side if you are a spicier person and vinegar on the side to help cut through the saltiness of the dish. I personally thought the food was great until the end, I really felt the saltiness of it. They do a great job on flavor, crispiness, and juicyness in their chicken karaage. Their oreo cheesecake was fluffy and felt like a great contrast after the saltiness of the meal.\\n\\nDefinitely a fun experience to eat, however it was a little too salty for me.

I nearly spilled a tray of food trying to get the glasses of tea onto it.  No help from the employees.  At all.\\n\\nYour iced tea is offered one way - sweetened - and no lemon or lime.  That's odd.  I understand how sweet tea goes with barbecue, but to have it ONLY that way?  And no lemon?  That's just bad service.  Speaking of service, they don't furnish you plasticware or napkins.  You have to retrieve them yourself at a little nook.  While I was in the nook, an unfortunate customer was searching fruitlessly for a takeout box that the employees had told him were in the nook.

Keep in mind that this location could possibly be a little hard to find if you're unfamiliar with Ponce City Market. It's located on the North Ave. side around the corner from Mountain High Outfitters. There's a parking garage that not many people know right next to it that isn't underground. Protip: Download ParkMobile app before you go. The app itself is actually widely used in ATL. \\n\\nA group of 7 friends and I get here right at 2pm, which is still peak brunch time on a Sunday in ATL. No line. Hmm, okay. Maybe we just got lucky. We go inside and see several groups inside dining but no line and plenty of tables. We walk up to order at the counter and the employees were avoiding eye contact with us at first. Ok... then one employee tells us it'll be 10 mins before we can order. Ok... I've worked in restaurants and I understands kitchens get backed up. No problem (although the restaurant was NOT busy). We finally get up there to order after awkwardly waiting for 20 mins instead of 10 mins and we were told that their systems were down and the cooks couldn't read the employee handwriting... Anyways... As others have mentioned, all of the -good stuff- is sold separately. The pancake plate only comes with one thin pancake and who only eats one of those? If you order the pancake stack you must order the sides as extras... My bacon was $5 and it came with three shrunken pieces :( My husband and I ended up spending nearly $50 on BRUNCH without alcohol... I feel a little ripped off considering places down the street have you walking out of there feeling stuffed for less than that.

But they have disappointed me the last several times I've ordered. This will be my last... ordered a side of chicken wing. The outside was completed burnt while the inside was still pink and under cooked. Their menu has a really nice picture of homemade brownies. I got a pre-packaged brownie with the logo, \\"dancing deer baking co.\\" The last time my coworker and I ordered their pasta, my coworker got food poisoning from them and my pasta tasted as if the salt shaker broke in the pot. This place is not what it used to be... what a shame!!"},{"name":"Veggie Galaxy","address":"450 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"What can I say about veggie galaxy that other people haven't.  My favorite restaurant hands down.  The vegan Rachel is my all time favorite sandwich.  Get it with greens instead of fries to save yourself a food baby.  The vegan omelette made with basil and spinach with breakfast potatoes is simply Devine.  And let's not forget the homemade lentil seitan sausage.  And the homemade seitan chkn and waffles.  Omg.  I have never ever had a bad meal here.  I think I've eaten up and down the menu.  This is one of the best places to eat in the US- period.  Every time I visit Boston I come here.  It's worth the trip.  Eat all the foods.  And let's not forget the Uber friendly service.  I love this place"},{"name":"Petunia's Pies & Pastries","address":"610 SW 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I love this place! Very tasty and it doesn't taste like vegan :) it's so yummy! It's so good that we went a second time the following day! If you're craving for vegan and gluten free desserts then just pop in this place ! You will surely love their shop and vibe!"},{"name":"Grand Chinatown","address":"21 Billings Rd","city":"Quincy","stars":"2.5","text":"Been to Grand Chinatown on more occasions for both dim sum and dinner than I care to count so a review is long overdue.  So for dim sum, I'd say it is fresher here than China Pearl Quincy but your tradeoffs will forever be the long wait during the weekends and the lack of variety.  \\n\\nAs a pescatarian, there are even fewer choices.  Off the top of my head, I remember har gow, shrimp rice noodle, a few bun options and the egg custard as possible choices.  Yeah, their shrimp or veggie (aka non pork or beef) varieties are almost nonexistent here.\\n\\nDinner is not a bad option if you're looking for authentic Cantonese food around these parts and not willing to travel into Boston.  Some of the usual dishes they do well are seafood bird's nest, twin lobsters with ginger and scallions, any steamed fresh fish, the salt and pepper fried dishes, sea conch, cubed pan fried flounder, surf clams or scallops with vermicelli and the pea pod stems.  Is it kinda greasy?  Um, yeah.  But is it familiar?  Um, yeah again.  It is what it is. \\n\\nOverall, it's a 3.5 raised to a 4 because it's 1 of 3 Chinese restaurants in Quincy I'd dine in that is authentic and the service actually isn't awful.  \\n\\nAm I in love with the place?  Not quite.  Love is a strong word.  Will I keep coming back because there's only this place, East Chinatown or Ming's?  Yep, probably.  And there we have it!"},{"name":"Ethiopian Restaurant","address":"1 Highland Ave, Ste B","city":"Malden","stars":"4.5","text":"Terrific dinner tonight. Had the vegetarian platter and fried whole fish. So many different flavors and textures to try. The fish was salty and light with wonderfully crunchy skin. The bread was stretchy and squishy to soak all the flavors. Even the green salad was surprising with hot peppers sliced in. Would come back in a heartbeat."},{"name":"Cedar's Restaurant","address":"7732 W Sand Lake Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Found this place searching for a dinner option near Barnes and Nobles in the Dr Phillips Orlando area.  This Lebanese restaurant was great.  It was a Saturday night and we were seated right away.  My husband and I decided to split a few appetizers and share a main entree and the portion size was perfect for us.  The baba ghanoush appetizer with their homemade pita like bread was delicious and a must try.  The mixed grill dinner was also fantastic.  It came with chicken, lamb and ground beef with rice, carrots and broccoli.  We were pleasantly surprised with a live belly dance performance while we were there.  Overall,  great Lebanese food and excellent service."},{"name":"Bomb Tacos","address":"500 Comal St","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"The tacos were awesome.

My husband had the pineapple  fried rice and it was decent. There were raisins in the rice which was throwing off the flavor a little bit. I would definitely come try other food here and come back especially on a cold day."},{"name":"Dexter's Windermere","address":"4757 The Grove Dr, Ste 100","city":"Windermere","stars":"3","text":"I ventured out to try the separate menu at this Dexter's, which offers a bougier supplemental menu to the standard Dexter's fare--and I'm glad I did.  Though more expensive, with various steaks and other options, I zeroed in on a pan-seared chicken breast (a generous portion), which came with honeyed haricots verts and was served with a mustard cream sauce.  The chicken, which was perfectly cooked--juicy and pretty tender--was served atop a bacon--yes, bacon--risotto.  The risotto was also cooked really well and the bacon flavor was savory and a nice balance to the mustard cream sauce.  The service was also really good--compliments to Brittany, who know the menu well and was very attentive.  Overall, a nice ambiance and pleasant dining experience."},{"name":"Turtle Creek Tavern","address":"5571 N Hamilton Rd","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"It's a bar. Drinks are average price.

I'd describe it more as family style than small plates so I'd recommend bringing a posse if you want to experience more than 3 dishes.\\n\\nI definitely liked the side/vegetable dishes more than the main/meat dishes: the heirloom tomatoes were delicious and the brussel sprouts were really fantastic, I think the golden raisins might even make them better than Uchikos! I said THINK.\\n\\nEveryone I know seems obsessed with the duck fat fries but I thought they were too mushy...my dining companion later told me that he ate all the crispy ones - more investigation is needed."},{"name":"Smokehouse 21","address":"413 NW 21st Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I enjoyed the food here - just be prepared to wait for it. We were the only customers there and it took about 40 minutes to get our food. The server also barked \\"can I help you?\\" across the room when we walked in and wasn't very friendly. They're lucky the food made up for it! Get the smoked corn on the cob and the cornbread - the cornbread was amazing. We would skip the beans next time. Pulled pork was good - I enjoyed their standard bbq sauce. The Mac and cheese was also worth coming back for."},{"name":"Carmelina's","address":"307 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Some of the best Italian food I've ever had.

Interesting concept, not easy to navigate at first but thankfully there was someone there to help us figure out how to seat ourselves.  The place appears to be a bar and full service restaurant, which it is, kind of.  You can choose to sit at the bar for full service or at to eat in the dining room you order at the counter and your food is brought to you.  It's nice they offer a special burger of the month so the menu is always fresh along with their standards.  They also have some interesting fries with unique toppings such as green chile queso fries and hot honey and sage fries.  The burgers were thick and juicy and cooked to a nice medium temperature.  It was delicious and worth the price of admission.
