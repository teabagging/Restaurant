Portions are huge, also not a surprise for an old fashioned red sauce kind of place.  I ordered the chicken Marsala and a salad.  The salad was crisp and fresh and the house dressing was excellent.  I loved the food.  There was so much though that I think i have enough for two more meals!

I come into a restaurant and I want to smell simmering tomato sauce, a waft of garlic, maybe lingering scents of coffee.  Not the smell of a gas station bathroom.  \\n\\nFinally through the third door and into the dining room and still the smell persisted.  I braced myself for a meal that would taste of cleaners.  I was pleasantly surprised it did not, but management:  please look into getting rid of that smell!"},{"name":"Neptune Oyster","address":"63 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"When I got to Neptune at 7:15pm, on a Monday night, the place was full, with the exception of a seat at the bar. Since I was solo, I looked around for the hostess, hoping to get that empty seat. After 15 minutes, with no clue as to who the hostess was, I asked the bartender if it would be ok to take the seat. \\n\\n\\"No, the hostess will seat you\\"\\n\\nOne of the people waiting told me that a woman who was bussing the tables was the hostess. \\n\\nAfter 10 more minutes of her studiously avoiding eye contact, I went to her, to let her know I was a single diner, and gestured towards the empty seat, and I asked if it was ok if I sat there. \\n\\n\\"No, I will put you on the list. should be about a half hour. I will call you. \\" I was then dispatched to the outside of the restaurant. Because it was only going to be a half hour, I waited outside the door on the sidewalk. \\n\\nThe seat remained empty for 50 minutes. Would have been plenty of time for me to order and eat. \\n\\nBy 8:45, I watched as multiple parties who had been signed to the list after me were seated. At 9, she finally said she would have a seat for me. \\n\\nThen she made me wait again, inside, \\nas I watched three more groups being seated. Two of those groups were 2 tops who arrived at the restaurant and got on her list over hour after I did. \\n\\nThere had been several groups of three, and she was ok with empty seats, but apparently leaving an empty seat with a single was a problem for her. Some of the twos seated before me were at the bar. \\n\\nI was finally seated at 9:30. \\n\\nSince I have worked in restaurants, I am a big over tipper. The bias against single female diners is unfortunate. I travel frequently for work, and am sadly, accustomed to the occasional shitty service as a single diner. This experience is the new benchmark for shitty service. Her behavior made me want to leave zero tip. \\n\\nYes, the food is great. The guy who waited on me at the bar was nice, knowledgeable about the oysters. I was even ok with being served French fries instead of the salad I ordered, which arrived when I was pretty much done eating the lobster roll, because he was a good dude. \\n\\nThe hostess went above and beyond to be an asshole though, and that was unnecessary. \\n\\nThat the restaurant is successful it's in spite of the hostess. \\n\\nIf Neptune had the last oysters on the planet, I would not go there solely because of her. \\n\\nI hope that one day, the tables are turned, that she's a solo female diner in a strange town and that the hostess treats her the way she treated me, and apparently numerous other diners."},{"name":"Little Bird Bistro","address":"215 SW 6th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"This was the first dinner here when we paid Portland a visit.

Food is fantastic and service is great.  \\n\\nWe started our order with wine.  Came out quick as expected.  The bread came shortly afterwards.  One thing I wish was different was the butter.  It was a little hard to spread.  If the chef/owner can take notice of this, I would heat it up or serve alternative butter so that patrons don't have to heat their knives to melt the butter down.  \\n\\nFor the appetizer, we had the cured salmon salad with cherry tomatoes.  There is a fancy name for it but I can't remember it.  I'm sure it was difficult to pronounced too.  Nether less, the dish was delicious.  Had a nice zest and it was quite light.  We could have ordered a second appetizer but didn't want to ruin the entree.  I ordered the fried trout since I've came across numerous images of it on Yelp.  She ordered the ribeye. My trout was amazing!  Came with butter lettuce to make mini tacos.  Highly recommend this dish.  The ribeye was ok.  The frites or fries, was so abundance that it took over the plate.  Ribeye was clearly not the hero.  It tasted ok.  Nothing stood out since it wasn't elevated in taste nor presentation.  It tasted exactly what one could expect.  It is a forgetful dish.  \\n\\nTo finish, they gave us complementary mini macrons which tasted lovely.

I love breakfast sandwiches. Grilled bread, eggs, meat, cheese, stuff, things, mmmmmmm.... yum. It's no wonder The Big Egg has been occupying a spot in the \\"want\\" sector of my brain for some time now. On a recent (and joyous) morning, I got to sample the bigness that is 'The Egg'.\\n\\nThis bright yellow cart sits up in the Mississippi cart pod and is open from early morning until early afternoon. They offer up both breakfast sandwiches and wraps to hungry people that get up way before I do. Being across town from me, it took a while for me to get over there, but I'm glad I did.\\n\\nTheir sandwiches are the highlight of the menu. They offer your choice of eggs, meats (sausage, ham, bacon) and cheese (cheddar, fontina) with some tasty stone ground mustard sandwiched between 2 pieces of grilled brioche bread. True to form, the eggs are big, and they're cooked to order (no poached, though). The sandwich comes out as big as you'd expect, with eggs, meat, and accoutrement piled high on thick crispy brioche. Careful ordering over-easy eggs, as they cook 'em perfect, and the yolk gets everywhere. \\n\\nThe flavor? Delicious. That buttery brioche is crispy and rich, the stone ground mustard adds a tasty zing, and balances out the salty meat and the luxurious eggs and heady fontina. All combined, they form a sandwich that takes 2 hands (and a few napkins) to tangle with, but goes down with much delight. It's not your average, crammed together and smashed breakfast sando. Each layer retains its own texture, providing for a myriad of sensations as you bite through your prize. For the price, it's a good solid amount of food. \\n\\nI definitely wish this cart were closer to my house, but the last thing I need in my life (and on my waistline) is a higher level of brioche intake, so I'll settle for just dreaming about these sandos from across town.\\n\\nOn a side note, I hear that this is one of the few carts up on Ol' Miss (along with Ruby Dragon and Dogfeathers) that keeps regular hours as advertised."},{"name":"Islington Pizza and Sub Shop","address":"315 Washington St","city":"Westwood","stars":"3.5","text":"This should be called the \\"Slop Shop\\".\\n\\nNotice how there are no pictures of the food?!\\n\\nThe food is barely edible and does fluctuate from okay to really bad.\\n\\nExpensive -- costs more than most sub shops\\n\\nAnd worst is the really rude owner.

At the door we were told it was a $7 cover charge. When we get in they say it's $10 since it's after 12 AM (5 minutes after 12 to be exact). There was no line, it didn't look crazy in there so I asked them to honor the $7 price we were originally told and they let us in for $7. Solid. We get in there and it was a nice mixed crowd. We sit down and order a round of Henny shots. Can't quite remember the price but seemed about right. \\n\\nThe DJ was playing more 70's disco sounding records as well as maybe house(??). It was a good mix but some of the people I was with were more in the mood for hip hop so we only stuck around for a lil while before going somewhere else. In the right mood, I think it would have been really fun. Apparently from what I was told, the type of music being played depends on the DJ and the night.\\n\\nBasically it's a long winded way of saying I don't know how to rate this. Maybe a 3.5?

A Trend that they started and then for some reason walked away from.  Over the years it's evolution to becoming a Karaoke bar and the moving right next to Kamei on the other side changed the recipe with just average food. No more Yoshokuya and mostly drinks and song.  It became a small group of those \\"in the know\\" who were left to dine there.  A past of the old Japanese bubble economy from the late 80's and 90's.   it's gotten old.  \\nSo now I find myself back here. After years and years of going to the original place I'm here at the third generation of what I would classify as the old Fugetsudo into the new Kamei karaoke bar.   When the restaurant closes, the bar opens and the karaoke music flows with well sung tunes of the old pros to the ear scratching screeches of a new nervous novice celebrating a birthday night with friends.  You'll find an assortment of people there.  Singers who's only spotlight is the applause from other patrons.  The libations and and frivolity of which song to pick next.  If your lucky you may be able to hear a pretty lady sing a Japanese song or a closet diva who can only sing well after a few drinks.  All the while there is me.  Munching away on my chicken wings and BBQ Squid. I don't drink but I do eat and there's coffee and tea and non alcoholic drinks that you'll enjoy.  \\nIt feels like the world in which I spent time with friends so long ago has gone.  And when I visit I just see ghosts and remnants of the past.  Like I'm a visitor in a Roppongi bar with old salary workers.  It's a throwback that almost harks to the old days of when I'd hang out daily at a karaoke bar with friends and just listen to the sounds of song, laughter and good food.  That can't be replicated, but this is as good as you'll get to the original.  Come by after ten pm and that's when it happens.

It was perfect for this cold rainy day but there was nothing spectacular about the dish. Then I had a clam and it was so incredibly fresh. All the clams were so big and sweet. It was fantastic. The more I ate, the better it tasted.

The stag on the wall reminds of an old place called Establishment in Buckhead but that's where their similarities end. The carpet was  a plaid flannel type vibe. They had a mix of booths and family style tables. They had 2 huge chandeliers (maybe 3) above. It was a really dark place but not in a bad way. They did have limited seating, and there are no reservations so plan to come early if you want to eat. They did have a heated patio where I chose to eat. It was perfect, and off to to side. \\n\\nFood: \\n-Crab Rangoon: Pretty damn delicious. I mean lump crab + cream cheese fried in all of their glory. Yup start here.\\n- Fried Artichoke:  Yeah. You heard right. Fried. They were huge too. I'm used to grilled. Maybe even hearts in a dip or another dish. Not big fried deliciousness with  a mayo aioli. It was on special, but if it's still there then swipe right!\\n- The Steak!!! : Yeah. It was great. It's served Medium rare. I ordered medium but honestly I think I would have enjoyed it medium. The steak was seasoned pretty damn perfectly and had perfect seared coat. It came with onion rings which are good. Not great. \\n- Next time: I spied someone's heirloom's carrots. yup next time. \\n\\nService:\\n- Waitress: She was awesome. Very knowledgeable of the cocktails and menus .

I was waiting for at least five minutes to be seated when I arrived, even though there was only one other couple in the restaurant. The server/host didn't even come out, the sushi chef had to seat us. After another five minutes, the server/host came out and finally gave us menus. He would disappear into the kitchen for ten to fifteen minutes at a time. When he dropped my coke off he didn't even open the can, or offer me a glass for it. It's a small thing, but at a sit-down restaurant, its kind of expected to get at least offered a glass for your drink. At the end of the meal, he came and sat at the host stand, which was next to our table, and sat there texting.\\n\\nFood - I was hoping the food would be good, because I really appreciated the sushi chef seating us and being friendly, but unfortunately it wasn't. The rolls were weirdly proportioned...there was almost a roll's worth of shrimp tempura sticking out the ends of one of the rolls. And in addition, they just didn't taste very fresh. The sake nigiri was not fresh, and I didn't even eat the second piece because I was too worried I would get sick.\\n\\nAmbiance - The bathroom door doesn't lock, which is disconcerting at best for a restaurant. The restaurant is quite small, which isn't a bad thing, but because of this I wouldn't recommend bringing a large group here even if you wanted to risk the customer service/food.\\n\\nOverall, very disappointed by this restaurant."},{"name":"ThoroughBread","address":"1709 Bluebonnet Ln","city":"Austin","stars":"5","text":"We went here for the first time to buy 2 loaves of rye bread for our Christmas Eve dinner.

I would say that it was well worth the wait! We got the neptune pearl, island creek, beach point, mookie blue, and kumamoto oysters to start. The one that stood out to me was the island creek oyster because it was sweet and creamy at first and salty at the end. Meanwhile, my boyfriend loved the kumamoto oyster the most. This one was the saltiest in our opinions. For the main courses, we got the Seared Georges Bank Scallops and the Maine Lobster Roll Sandwich, which was the hot version with butter. The scallops were perfectly seared and smoky, while the greens, corn, and bacon on the bottom were enjoyable as well. For the lobster roll, we chose the hot version with butter since we prefer it over the cold version with mayo. The bread was perfectly coated with butter and the lobster was very tender.

My waiter kindly spoke to the manager about it and he was told that new menus are coming out this weekend which will reflect the new $2 up-charge, but they've already changed it in their computer system first.  So that was it, no offer to correct the charge to $1 as the menu stated at this current point in time.

That was insane. Just their beers alone were good enough in my opinion. After that those extra great tasting beers were just showing off. The best part is that l dont believe the beer menu favored any particular type of beer. They had everything. What really made it even better is that they had food. The food was finger licking.

They weren't the best I've had, but I did like the fact that they weren't covered with breading. The butter went untouched after the first dip, as I opted for ketchup. \\n\\nThe cheese sticks were awesome. They definitely weren't bought frozen, as each piece was a different kind of cheese, and they were all shaped differently. It was fun trying each one and guessing which cheese it was! \\n\\nThe buffalo chicken dip was served with a few pieces of sliced up pita, chips, carrots, celery, and green onions (as in long pieces of the white part to dip- weird?). There seemed to be plenty of dip to use up all of the \\"dippers,\\" which was nice. The dip itself was really good- as other who have written reviews, I'd recommend it! It was really creamy and not very spicy...I couldn't stop trying to sneak a few bites from my friend! \\n\\nThis is basically a bar with upscale food and prices to go with it. I didn't have any drinks that night, but my friend said hers were really expensive. The appetizers were decently priced, but the entrees were a little high.

The restaurant is a Paddleboat but don't worry, it is permanently affixed to the mooring and there is zero movement...but it is very, very beautiful. The views are fabulous either looking at the bustle of Disney Springs or looking out over the lake. Then there's the food...fabulous!

Of particular note was the Chilled Trio, consisting of Key West shrimp, crab ceviche, ahi tuna poke, tortilla chips. Amazing!

An example of how great the service was, was when my birthday friend had one of the servers warm up her soup when it was suppose to be served chilled. The waiter happily obliged, took the soup, and came back later with a warmed up vichyssoise. \\n\\nI brought in a specially made birthday cake for my friend, which they took care of from storing to cutting.

So don't expect to be sitting comfortably. But let's be honest, you came here for the food and the food only anyway.\\n- Such such fresh sea food (See specifics).\\n\\nSPECIFICS:\\n- Oysters (Single) = So so fresh. I ordered 4 oysters (the waitress recommended as her favorite) and 1 clam. They all came out really fresh and clean, none of the sand that some people had complained about. They were all pretty hearty in size, with the lumps of meat glistening in their natural juices. I prefer to eat them without any additional sauces except for a little squirt of lemon since I like to taste most ingredients as their intended by the chief or nature and they all had that sweet-salty taste of the ocean with every bite. I need to come back just for this!\\n- Seared Georges Bank Scallops = So so so delicious. I love scallops but I never knew I could love them this much. They were seared to perfection with a little hint of a delicious brown around the circumference. They were juicy and meaty with every bite and there was a hint of lemon juice that elevates the sweetness of the scallops. The bedding of pea tendrils and corn was good. Pea tendrils tend to be quite coarse but they cooked it into a nice tenderness and the corn was sweet and matched well with the cream sauce dressed on the vegetables. My only problem was the bacon. It was delicious, as all bacon will ever be, but it was just too much. And with an ingredient that's so heavily based on a single main taste (saltiness), it should be used with caution. I ate the first half of the dish leaving all the bacon in but eventually, the salt of the bacon just overwhelmed my palet. I started to pick out the bacon and was left with a huge pile on the plate, which just goes to prove my point of how much there was on there.\\n\\nOVERVIEW:\\nIs it really hyped up? Yes.

The couple bites I stole of the short rib and accompanying truffle mac+cheese were delicious as well. We also ordered a bottle of white and pitcher of red sangria - both were decent.\\n\\nWhile we all cleared our plates quickly, I think this was partly because the food was good, but mostly because the portion sizes were modest.\\n\\nService, on the other hand, was rushed and borderline rude. Our servers barely greeted us or checked on us, and looked annoyed the two times we flagged them down to order more drinks and to get the check. After the first two entrees arrived, nearly ten minutes passed before the rest showed up. No explanations, no simple \\"your food will be coming out shortly\\" as we waited and craned our necks looking for our missing food. \\n\\nI get that it was extremely busy and the staff were working their tails off, but it doesn't take that much extra time to communicate and be a bit more personable with your guests.\\n\\nAfter our meal, our server came by with a dish of ice cream - a nice surprise.

The outside has chocolate sprinkles and a chocolate filling.  I'd almost say it's so sweet that I couldn't eat more than one at a time.  Very thick/dense and sweet.  Really delicious in moderation!\\n\\nThe Cheese breads, which are more like over-sized cheese puffs/balls, were put in the toaster oven when purchased.  They both were light and had a very rich cheese flavor, although I have to say I preferred the garlic cheese bread much more than the plain cheese bread.  Both were really good!\\n\\nThe Americano coffee comes in two types: Americano, which is just coffee black, or Americano con leche, which is coffee with milk.  The leche sets you back an extra $1.10 per small cup.  $4 for a 8 oz cup of plain coffee is a little steep for my taste buds, so I just got coffee black.  \\n\\nSadly, the weakest part of Golden Drops Cafe seemed to be the Coffee itself, because it was simply okay, being slightly watered, definitely not strong, and slightly underwhelming.\\n\\nLocated Off of Clairmont Road, just down the road from the Atlanta VA, it was pretty easy to get into and out of the lot.  Speaking of the lot, there were several spaces in the private lot.  Inside there's a few tables, a bar/stools to sit at, and I was told that next month their patio would be operational with heat (currently it was empty).\\n\\nNice little independent shop that serves very tasty savory and sweet snacks, which I immediately fell in love with.  I'm not sold on their coffee just yet, but whenever I come back, maybe next time i'll be wowed by a beverage."},{"name":"Applebee's Grill + Bar","address":"6290 W Irlo Bronson Memorial Hwy","city":"Celebration","stars":"2.5","text":"I was very disappointed with this location.

The place was not extremely packed like I have seen other locations, but 15-20 min after been sat no one had even visited our table to ask us for drinks or anything, not even to apologize for the wait. The server passed by our table at least 3-4 times but not a word was said to us. It felt like we were invisible. We got up and left. \\nApplebee's, if you want to retain your customers and get more referrals, I suggest you hire more servers to start with, and then ensure they are trained to communicate with your customers about the status of the service.

Its a far cry from the intimate, homey, set up of Le Pigeon's communal tables and tiny open kitchen, but it can no doubt generate a much larger business. \\n\\nIf you had to chose between the two while in Portland, I'd recommend Le Pigeon as a strong first choice, but this little bird is not an afterthought.  With its pressed tin ceiling, robins egg blue walls, professional service and tasty food, the Little Bird Bistro is a very sophisticated spot.\\n\\nWe were perched upstairs in the loft area, surrounded by wine bottles, antlers, flickering candles, and a collection of mounted butterflies. \\n\\nWe started with a refined and savory version of steak tartare with housemade potato chips.   Wonderful.  I had a pork four ways dish with smoked pork loin, pork belly, pork garlic sausage, and grilled weisswurst atop a housemade sauerkraut, that was a meat-lovers dream come true.   It was perfectly cooked and terrifically savory.  \\n\\nSometimes, the simplest dish can be the most complex, and our favorite dish of the night was a simple squash gratin that was baked, buttery and could not have been better.  \\n\\nMy husband has the fish of the day: a seabass.  It was a pretty fishy seabass, if I'm honest,  and the least successful dish of the night.  Even the Central Bakery bread with fresh butter and a touch of sea salt had a flare that our fish was somehow lacking.  The dessert we had should be a must-try for any banana fan  --it was fantastic, lots of texture and flavor.\\n\\nThe whole meal was memorable, rich and decadent, paired great with the wines, and even the cocktail and dessert menus were excellent.

You have to pay $1.50 extra if you want chips or salsa refills at La Casita, which is ridiculous. The salsa isn't the least bit exciting. I ordered a regular margarita and it's incredibly tiny (and almost $6). I asked for salt and got just a few flakes. La Casita is as small as it looks from the outside, which is fine, but someone in the restaurant's stomach did not agree with Mexican food and I had to smell it the whole night. Also, a drunk couple a few tables over were loud and angry at each other, and it felt like it was happening right on top of you. The rice is weird because it has only carrots and peas in it, which is really more of an Asian restaurant thing. I got cheese enchiladas and they were pretty boring.

I wish that I could say Bondir was the perfect place to celebrate and cap off the year, and from the recommendations I'd received from friends and food critics, I expected it would be. \\n\\nThe menu for our meal:\\n\\n-Whole wheat sourdough and purple corn, cranberry, and walnut. As an avid baker and proud parent of a sourdough starter, the purple corn loaf used a starter that was so sour it tasted spoiled. The whole wheat bread was nice, but I couldn't get the other taste out of my mouth for two courses. \\n\\n-Roxbury russet apple with cashews, picked cranberries, pepper cress, and a black sesame vinaigrette. This was good. The apple was poached well and the sweetness played well with the sesame dressing. \\n\\n-Georgia candy roaster pumpkin with collard greens, crab, and a tomato mayonnaise. They kindly omitted the ham from the greens on my plate to make the dish pork-free. The pumpkin was great, but the tomato mayonnaise was slightly broken and too oily, and they drizzled the bottom of the plate with more oil. I drank a whole glass of water during this course to try to keep my mouth from feeling like the grease pit at a McDonald's. \\n\\n-Akaushi beef strip loin with chicory, celeriac pur√©e, and roasted grapes. They made my dish with seared mackerel instead of beef to make it accommodate my dietary restrictions. My boyfriend's beef was cooked perfectly (I believe they sous vide and then sear), but my fish was very overcooked and over salted. I think it sat under the warmer for too long, because the plate and fish were very hot to the touch (the flaked salt on top likely absorbed more into the fish than intended as a result). The celeriac and grapes were my favorite part of the whole meal, but the chicory was far too burnt and bitter (and not balanced out by the rest of the dish), so I didn't eat more than a bite. \\n\\n- Medlar sorbet with sumac tea. This was a good palate cleanser, but the scoop size was less than a taster spoon at JP Licks. \\n\\n- Blueberry angel food cake with huckleberry compote, yuzu ice cream, and some kind of cheese. And chocolate-star anise pot de creme with husk cherry jelly, a ginger marshmallow, and cocoa nib sable. The dessert was the most disappointing dish. I'm a big sweets person, and the dessert could've made this whole meal worth it to me. I'm not sure if their pastry cook took the night off or what, but both of these were bad. The angel food cake had the texture of a banana bread loaf, and the yuzu ice cream with the herbal spices in the cake and compote was awful. It tasted like I was eating a week old bouquet. The chocolate pot was fine, but I would've preferred a cup of hot chocolate from LA Burdicks. The cookie served with it was hard and flavorless. TBH, I wish they'd just given me a real-size scoop of the sorbet. \\n\\nAfter dessert, we ordered two cappuccinos. They need to increase the grind size for their beans; the espresso was too bitter. They brought at least 7 cubes of muscovado sugar, all of which went to waste except one which made me sad, but it made me sadder that my cube never dissolved and that made the espresso even less tolerable. \\n\\nWe ordered a $46 bottle of wine (2015 Grenache-Syrah) that retails for $17. It tasted like a $17 bottle of wine and was far too full-bodied for the menu. I asked the server for guidance in picking between a few wines, and I wish she'd steered us away from this one for the menu that was served this evening. \\n\\nI hoped for and expected more from Bondir, and am honestly really sad to have been let down. We spent $250 on a meal, and I would've been happier eating $40 worth of dim sum. Unlike others, I found the portion sizes to be appropriate for a five course meal. However, I found the service to be just fine, and for a place this nice, I expected more menu knowledge and more camaraderie. The timing was a bit slow for the meal-- it felt a bit like we were in Europe (which is ok! But not when a 22% tip is expected). \\n\\nMy biggest issue with our meal at Bondir is that my stomach has been killing me from about 30 minutes after it ended. I hadn't eaten anything prior to the meal for hours and had something I eat often for lunch, so I don't know what else to attribute it to. Perhaps it was cross-contamination of beef/pork, which I explained were dietary restrictions for me (though they seemed happy to accommodate), or that something wasn't cooked right. Over-sour bread also has a tendency to upset some stomachs (and I've had my fair share of experiences with this when my starter is a bit too potent and I make a loaf, or if you cut it before it's completely cool). Either way, I'm disappointed that our meal wasn't great and that I'm nauseous at 11pm after dropping $250 on a meal that didn't taste that great the first time it was in my mouth"},{"name":"Murphy's","address":"997 Virginia Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"One of my go to brunch spots!

The lighting is modern, and unlike anything I have seen.  The counter is lined with sweets and get this, one of my west coast favs- hi-chew.  \\n\\nGrab a menu and see what they have.  Japanese style fried chicken is what they do here.  You can either get a plate, a salad, or a sandwich.

I would hope that would fill me up.  Now I would like to give you a heads up, they do not really do value, as 2/4/12/20 pc tenders are all the same rate- which is $1.50 per tender no matter the amount.\\n\\nThey also have a water station so don't waste your money on Fiji unless you really want to.  Oh yea, they also charge for extra sauce.  I will say this- the homemade ranch was solid (coming from someone who hates ranch) but the ponko t-sauce tasted like something you get from the sale section at Kroger.  I paid extra for the t-sauce and wish I got the extra ranch instead. \\n\\nI will admit, I was starving so I was glad when the food came.  I realized that each type did have a sauce coating.  Even the original.  That threw me off, as I expected the original to just be plain jane tenders, but I was wrong. I think they put t-sauce on that too.  But the ranch helped.  The actual tenders were cooked to perfection, but the spicy didn't live up to its name.  Out of the three, I would say the bbq was my favorite.\\n\\nThe people were friendly there which was a plus, and they bring their food to you, but in the current stage it gets crowded quickly inside and can become a cluster.

I'll also preface this by saying that I've never had rude service at any of the other locations, except in this drive through, but the rudeness was horrendous. I placed an order and the woman on the speaker repeated it back very quickly and I wasn't even sure what she said, so I repeated it again and she yelled at me, \\"That's what I said!\\". I then said, \\"you said it really fast so I wasn't sure what you said\\" and she then rudely and overly slowly said \\"I AM SORRY YOU COULD NOT UNDERSTAND ME, I'M SORRY I TALK TOO FAST FOR YOU\\". You know that really loud and slow way, when an ignorant person is talking to someone they think doesn't understand English well or an older person who might not hear very well. It was very sarcastic and rude. I was stunned. When I was still in the drive through line I could see in the window there were two women working the drive through with head sets on and I stared at them the whole time waiting for to get to the window, over 5 minutes. One of them was clearly agitated, probably having a bad day for other reasons and was the one who took her frustrations out on me. The other woman was trying to calm her down while they did their work. When I got to the window the other woman rung me up and the one who I'm positive was the one who was rude to me stayed away from the window. I think she just couldn't handle the job.

I can see - for accounting purposes - why they don't just jack up menu pricing and cut them 3%. but why is this mandatory when tips are not???? why can't their portion be taken out of our tip?? why isn't this announced before people sit down?? why do they spend half a page (or, a separate page) explaining what it is and how it is not the same as your regular tip?? why can't the restaurant owners - making so much on profits - pay people right to begin with???\\n\\nenough of my rant, which marks the beginning of my campaign to walk out of restaurants that impose this fee instead of doing what's right. but that's just me.\\n\\nfor the purpose of this review, let's talk about the overall experience.\\n\\nambiance: great - simplistic modern decor, open kitchen concept, neutral tone with pops of colors. tables may be a bit small, but seating is comfortable.\\n\\nservice : attentive and friendly. server folds your cloth napkin when you leave the table.\\n\\ndrinks: strong, but not particularly my kind of yummy. it's pretty to look at, though.\\n\\nfood: tasty, but not much standing out... surprisingly, the chicken liver pat√© on crostini would be one i would order again. not the crudo tasting, not the pasta, definitely not the octopus.\\n\\nwhy? \\n\\ncrudo tasting was a great choice for an app, when every description sounds so promising. 6 bitefuls of chef choice fish, enough for two to share, it's a good deal. and very pretty to look at.  but ... 1) aside from the tangerine nori sauce, others sauces and fish aren't memorable; 2) seems like we were given the \\"cheaper\\" cuts, even if subconsciously - when i glanced at our adjacent table later on, saw that they had a very different and more expensive mix; 3) the salmon was really blah, but i haven't had \\"regular salmon\\" a long time now, for many reasons but that's another discussion; 4) order of presentation breaks the most basic nigiri rule: lighter fish first, then progress to heavier ones. but instead, we were offered yellowtail and salmon right off the bat, then the lighter and whiter fish in the second round (same tasting order, came out in two rounds). maybe there's no such thing in other parts of the world, and i'm well aware that this ain't sushi, but i stand by the principle behind it - traditionally trained sushi chefs didn't just do some things for hundreds of years for fun, but bc it makes gustatory sense, and that they put a lot of thought into perfecting their profession and improving the dining experience. maybe it won't make a difference in this case, maybe there's something worth exploring.\\n\\nhomemade fresh pasta was delicious and of great quality. not something i went foodgasmic on, but it's good.\\n\\noctopus, at $16 or $17 for one tentacle (another unwelcomed trend), was the biggest disappointment.  Alton Brown - maybe another Food Network chef on Chopped - once commented that octopus is very tricky to make: you have to either cook it for very short time or for very long time. they missed the window on this. it was not inedible, but definitely heading towards Chewieland, what with that hardened outer layer there (did they try to deep fry without batter?). not much of any flavor came through on that dish, except for the fresh parsley.\\n\\nabout that kitchen fee thing....yeah, reason why i had to bump it down to 3 stars, along with the octopus. both were quite hard to stomach (for restaurants this caliber), but the fee won this round. i'm all about people getting paid to do what they do - but paying them fairly isn't my job and the 3% should come out of operations, not from diners. i'll happily pay it as part of your menu pricing, or as a voluntary/customary tip. but i'm not ok with being imposed on in this fashion.\\n\\nas such, i'll dine elsewhere next."},{"name":"Little Bird Bistro","address":"215 SW 6th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"This place restored some of our faith in Portland dining - thanks, folks.

They were so good and fresh that they were all gone before I even ealized it. I also got the lobster bake. Unfortunately, it wasn't as good as the roll and oysters.

That said, it tasted pretty good, except for the main reason I am writing this review, which relates to the portion size.\\n\\nIt looked like it was child-sized.\\n\\nThe piece inside the delivery box was 4\\"/10cm x 5.5\\"/14cm, and weighed around 329g. The 'Serving Size' mentioned in their nutritional table PDF lists it as 762.3g. This means the portion is just over 43% the size of what it should have been. They even have an 'Express Lunch' portion on the same PDF that is listed at 409.5g, so it was even smaller than that. This is a pretty large variance, and it makes me wonder if this is part of the Skip The Dishes 'formula' that they use to cover the free delivery costs? Pure speculation on my part, I suppose.\\n\\nRicky's has typically been good when we dine in, and while we don't eat from there that often, this experience sure makes me wish we just went with 'Italian Tomato', up the road.

The staff literally everyone working was so so so kind it was so amazing to see how concerned they were with your well being."},{"name":"Fresh Kitchen","address":"851 N Alafaya Trl, Ste Q-01","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"I can't believe I'm just now getting around to reviewing Fresh Kitchen when I've been eating there since I moved to Waterford Lakes in January. I eat here at least once a week or every other week. The thing is, in January, this would've been a 5-star review all day, but after being a regular for so long, I have to knock it down a bit.\\n\\nLet's start with the food. If you're on some sort of strict diet, like paleo, low-carb, whole 30, keto, gluten-free, vegetarian, etc. it's easy to find something here to fill your plate. The veggies and meats change every couple months, and it's nice to try a different combination each time. Everything is so flavorful. There's some magic way they take 6 different things that would never go together and somehow make them go together. Their sweet potato noodles, as others have mentioned, are amazing. You'd have no idea they're gluten-free, but I do wish they were served hot. More on this later.\\n\\nThe protein options are definitely the highlight. They usually have 3-4 different types of chicken, my favorites being the almond chicken (GF chicken tender) and the teriyaki chicken. I've yet to try the steak or tuna because it's already pretty pricey as it is. More on this later, too.\\n\\nThe veggies are a major hit or miss. Sometimes they're really fresh, and sometimes they seem like they've been sitting around for a while. There is very little consistency in the seasoning, and something is usually way too salty. The selection, however, is nice, especially with all the rotating items. \\n\\nBack to the food temps. If you eat-in, your meal is going to be warm. Never hot. If you take it to go, just accept that you'll be eating cold food when you get home. I'm not sure why, but they just haven't gotten around to getting the heat-holding quite right. And if you order the cold bases, like the sweet potato noodles or quinoa, they somehow suck the heat out of the other hot items.\\n\\nNow, back to the price. It's $8-10 to get a bowl with either 4 or 6 items. In the past, it was a pretty good deal because I could easily get two meals out of a six-bowl (I don't eat much, though). Lately they've gotten stingier with their portions. They also uncharge for everything: parmesan cheese, feta, tomatoes, guac, salsa, extra sauces, any meat other than chicken, just to name a few. Your $10 bowl can easily become $12-15 with a few simple additions. They go for a Chipotle-type experience, but should really include more add-ins with the price. \\n\\nThat being said, it's still a great option for health-conscious people looking for something other than a salad. I did Whole30 and was still able to order a lot of the items here thanks to most of the food being gluten-free, soy-free, dairy-free, sugar-free, etc. The combinations are endless and it's tough to get bored eating here. The service is always great - friendly, engaged team members. \\n\\nI'm going to continue coming back simply because you can't get something this healthy to-go anywhere else. I just wish they could figure out how to keep the food hotter and the portion sizes and flavors more consistent."},{"name":"Monica's Mercato","address":"130 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Food is fabulous ! I would be a loyal customer here if the quality of the service wasn't so terrible. I am usually a patient person and one who doesn't care about waiting for my food as long as it's good. The first time I came there was 2 people ahead of me and my husband. The staff were terrible, they couldn't understand me or my order and one staff was making out with his girlfriend and then came up with food from the basement... GROSS We waited about 30 minutes for two cold sandwiches.  I WILL ADMIT the sandwiches are amazing.. \\n\\nmy experiences after have been horrible the food is always A+ but the service is the worst I have ever experienced. I went in again and hoped for the best. There were a new crew working tonight but history repeated itself again! \\nThis experience was sadly my last, no matter how good the sandwiches are. This final time on 5/5 there was about 4 people ahead of us, we expected to wait a little bit. We ordered a chicken cutlet cold, with mozzarella, prosciutto, balsamic. 5 other people had already received their order that had been placed after ours. We hesitantly  asked if the sandwiches were almost ready. The guy making them hadn't even started. We patiently waited when we saw him pull the cutlets out of the microwave and they had melted provolone . Feeling extremely frustrated because yet again we waited 25 minutes, they didn't understand me or my order we told them to cancel and just left. I hate sounding like a  brat but these subs are about $15 a piece and I have to drive and take a train, then walk a mile to get here.  For that price the service should be impeccable.

The minute I woke up I drove over to Revolution Doughnuts and bought myself 4 doughnuts. Yes, 4 because I couldn't just leave with 1 or 2. I went on a gloomy Monday afternoon and was greeted by a friendly employee. There was an abundant amount of doughnuts in the window and they also had an awesome selection of drinks. The doughnuts I got were $2 each so I paid a total of $8 for 4. It was a difficult decision to make but I ended up going home with 1 vanilla bean glazed, 1 true blueberry, 1 shredded coconut, and 1 cinnamon sugar. \\n\\nSo here is my ranking of my favorite doughnuts:\\n1. Cinnamon Sugar \\n2. Vanilla Bean Glazed\\n3. Shredded Coconut\\n4. True Blueberry \\n\\nThe cinnamon sugar doughnut was my favorite because it was simple and delicious. This doughnut wasn't just your average cinnamon sugar yeast doughnut. There was a hint of other spices that elevated the flavor profile of the doughnut. True blueberry was not my favorite not because it was gross or anything but it just didn't do anything for me. The blueberry glaze did not have that blueberry flavor that I was hoping it would have. The shredded coconut was good and I liked the texture that the shredded coconut gave to the doughnut. BUT, it was just a little too sweet for me. The coconut one also was a little more fragile than the other doughnuts. One big problem that I noticed with the doughnuts I got that day was that they were still doughy in the middle of each doughnut. I'm not sure if that is how all of the yeast doughnuts are here but it kind of ruined my first experience. I would've given this place 5 stars if the doughnuts were cooked through a bit more.

We'll start with the issues.  First, they are HARD to find.  I identified them as a place to try by reading about them on Yelp.  I don't know if they really have a sign out front or not.  They are on a corner of a strip-like mall - but hidden away.  ALSO - their name is now \\"Coffee Cat Corner\\" - see receipt I'll post.\\n\\nThe meh item is pricing.  $2.50 for a large decaf and then $.75 cents for my syrup.  Grand scheme of life and coffee shops - not unreasonable I guess.\\n\\nThe odd - I was the only customer there.  Which might have been a good thing.  They have about 4 tables and not much room.  They sell various items - both fresh food (i.e. muffins), but also candy and tchotchkes.  \\n\\nTheir big things is CATS.  While I didn't see any, I certainly heard one yowling at times.  I guess you can rent a cat to hang out with while enjoying your coffee.  By the 30 minutes increment.  Having 3 fur balls at home that I'm already paying for, I didn't need more cat fur on my black coat.  What I did like and overheard is that they are also an avenue for cat adoption.  Being a cat owner who has only taken in rescue kitties, I am on board with this adoption thing - not pet store mills.  So this altruistic purpose got them the 3rd star.\\n\\nBack to my coffee.  It was really good.  I must give them credit for that.  It took a few minutes as my decaf often does - but worth the wait.  Wi fi was good.  I spent about an hour 45 minutes there working.  And only one other person came in - to drop off treats for the kitties and discuss a possible adoption.\\n\\nI don't think I'll return - and I wonder if they'd still be in business if I tried.  The location does not help them - nor the set up of the space.  A little too cramped and intimate for my taste.  But then again, I'm happy being anonymous and part of the crowd - as long the crowd is not too loud."},{"name":"Cuatro's","address":"1004 W 24th St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I've been here several times now.

Perfect amount of butter and the roll was just perfect. $32 was worth it because it was amazing. The fries it came with were perfectly crisp as well! Yum!!! \\n\\nLastly we got the lobster pasta special because it was a Monday. We then added black truffles as suggested by the waitress. We were definitely regretful of this one. The pasta alone was $38 - which was yummy and had a TON of lobster but for that price, I honestly think they could do less lobster and charge less. It was a lot of food and very heavy. Additionally, adding truffles was another $20 and we couldn't taste them at all. So that means it was a $60 pasta. Probably the most expensive meal of our entire trip and this was just lunch! Lol.

So I can't actually put the kid in the play area because I can't see him from the table you placed me at. \\nThe first time, a table opened up that was closer to the play area and I asked if we could switch tables. \\nYou were very friendly and did indeed let me swap tables. \\nI was with my friend and one kid. \\nFrom the minute we got our food, I felt like we were being pushed out and they wanted to clear our table for another party. \\nThey came over not one, not two, not three, but four times to \\"check\\" on us. The first time we maybe had our food five minutes and my friend still had a whole plate of food but half a pancake and asked if she was done and wanted her food wrapped. The second time was only 10 minutes later or 5 minutes after the last time they came over. I still have 3/4 of a plate of corned beef and hash browns and they ask if I'm all done and need a box. I am literally in mid chew and clearly still eating. The third time, 15 minutes in. They drop the check and say anytime you're ready. Oh I'm sorry. No we aren't ready. We don't scarf down a whole breakfast in 15 minutes. We aren't at mcdonalds getting an egg mcmuffin. \\nThe fourth time they came to see if the check was ready. So they wanted us to get our food, eat it, and pay the bill in less than 20 minutes. Are you that desperate for tables??????? \\n\\nDespite all of that, I went back today. \\nAgain I ask specifically for a table near the play area because it was just me and the kid this time. \\nI am put all the way in the corner. Picture attached so you can see our view. \\nNot even five minutes after we were seated, a table opened up right next to the play area. But before I could ask to switch they seat a party that of course had no kids. \\nI would have waited that extra 5 minutes or even ten minutes for a closer table. \\nI'm sorry but it really disturbs me that you don't just keep the 3 closest tables to the kid play area open for people who actually have kids with them. \\nOtherwise just get rid of the play area and put more seating because you seat families with kids to far away from it anyway. \\n\\nSo we waited for our food this morning and it finally came. I order the same thing every time. \\nOne maddie cake and hash browns with corned beef and avocado with rye toast. \\nOh boy were they extra stingy on the corned beef. Looks like they gave me the scraps from the bottom of the pan. \\nPicture also attached and you can compare to the other times that I have been there when they give me nice big hunks that take up the whole plate. \\nThe person sitting at a table across from us, had those big hunks of stringy corned beef that she was passing around the her friends. So I watched her eat that, while I got the leftovers. \\nI would have complained but the waitress never checked in on us. Only like two seconds after she dropped of the food and when she was dropping off the check. \\nJam I still love your food, but it's going to take a while before I decide to come in again. \\nEither you are overly aggressive trying to push me out the door or ignore me for my whole time I'm there. \\nI'll also forever be disturbed that you extremely shorted me on corned beef.

You get all the side fixings and lettuce and the meat comes seasoned for you. The waitress told me to cook the beef first because the pork was spicy so otherwise the beef which was a sweeter sauce would taste spicy also. I followed her instructions and honestly the flavors were awesome and the sides were great. I packed the leftovers to go and they gave me more lettuce to take with me, which I know they don't usually do but they allowed me to because I hadn't had a refill on any of the sides and obviously had a lot of meat left. \\nThe food is delicious, the place is always busy and the staff is super friendly."},{"name":"The Park on South Lamar","address":"4024 S Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I came to The Park with a friend to grab a drink after we took an Uber back from Trail of Lights.

However $10 for one mimosa to me is very pricey. The bathroom was pretty dirty and not clean at all. The atmosphere is sports bar meets upscale. I like that there are tv's everywhere playing music and sports games. I wish there were more of these in San Antonio with daily drink and brunch specials.

I've frequently seen it stretch all the way down Salem out to Cross Street, sometimes including tourists who have yet to even drop off their luggage.  And for good reason.  Neptune Oyster is certainly one of the very best seafood restaurants in the city.\\n\\nA trip to the new DMV at Haymarket to get my license renewed on a weekday in May gave me the perfect opportunity to try to hit Neptune on the early side. Upon arrival, I was quoted a 15-20 minute wait for a spot at the bar, which was absolutely fine.  Within minutes, others were being quoted 45 minutes to an hour, and I've heard of people being quoted 6 hour wait times.  Thankfully, the host understands that this would otherwise be untenable so they allow you to leave your number and will call you.  On a previous visit, I was at Wine Bottega when I got my call and came sprinting back to claim my spot. It was totally worth the exercise.\\n\\nAnyway we were seated at a bar overlooking the large storefront window on Salem, giving us a perfect view of the oysters as well as the opportunity to photobomb the tourist groups mugging for photos outside!\\n\\nWhile it can be noisy, festive, and a bit chaotic inside Neptune because of the tiny space and the tile walls/floor which seem to amplify the sound, service is consistently attentive and friendly.  They seem to know they've got a good thing going, and that you probably deserve some good will for having waited a while to get in.  \\n\\nWe started with beer and some perfectly shucked oysters, and proceeded to enjoy the Johnnycake, the special pasta of the day (was the only thing that disappointed), and finally the hot buttered lobster roll.  The johnnycake has smoked trout and sturgeon caviar and was not something I would have ordered had it not been for multiple servers insisting that I do so.  The savory trout and caviar matched perfectly with the sweetness of the johnnycake.  It's so good, and a must have every time I'm there.  I've enjoyed the hot lobster roll more than the cold lobster salad roll, although both are very good.  Perhaps it's a matter of preference, but few places in Boston seem to do it hot.\\n\\nOverall, if you're willing to wait a while or are lucky enough to go at opening or during blizzard or a Pats game (they don't seem to have a TV), Neptune Oyster always hits the spot.  It's worth a trip to the North End, and there are so many other things to walk around and see, the wait won't seem that bad once you're inside."},{"name":"Portland City Grill","address":"111 SW 5th Ave, Fl 30","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Beautiful view and great service.

I'll start by saying the ambiance was awesome. The view of the city was amazing. Our server came promptly with piping hot bread and soft, creamy butter! I hate hard butter. The bread was on point. All three of us ordered salad to start. Two Caesar salads for them and I the blue cheese iceberg wedge salad with candied bacon. They enjoyed theirs and I loved mine. The dressing was amazingly creamy and the amount blue cheese was perfect. For the main course we all ordered the fillet, one 7.5 ounce and two 10 ounce. They all came with seasonal veggies, asparagus. They ordered waffle fries, I garlic mashed potatoes. I ordered my 10 ounce steak medium. We also ordered the lobster mac and cheese to share. Steaks were cooked to perfection however, this is where it goes downhill. My 10 ounce steak looked like it was the 7.5 ounce which is not what I ordered but no biggie. It looked smaller than my buddy's. Here's the issue, there's tasted much better than mine. Mine was tough and salty. I tasted theirs and they tasted mine. We all agreed there was a discrepancy with mine. The manager did come over at the request of our server to make it right because of our original issue, the size of my steak. Side note, we did not discuss the taste variance with the manager. He  deducted $8.00 from our tab. Now, my garlic mash? Cold! Honestly tasted from a box with an occasional piece or two of real potatoes. The asparagus? Salty, cooked perfectly but a bit salty, I did like them though but not the mash. The lobster mac and cheese? Uh, \\"where's the lobstah?\\" If you blinked you'd miss it. There was literally one SMALL piece of lobster but the mac was good and creamy. Ultimately they both loved their food (they did not try their asparagus) and I was a bit mixed because of my steak and the sides. Most high end steak houses have their sides a la cart and I believe it's because special attention is given when they are prepared separately. In this case the mashed potatoes and asparagus were left out in solitary confinement. That said, I wouldn't return and most likely never would unless I wanted to see the view of the city which was awesome."},{"name":"JJ's Fresh From Scratch","address":"2950 Curry Ford Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"I thought it would be safe to eat here based on some reviews comparing it to Chipotle, but I was very wrong.

When she was about to go through the list of questions again for the torta I just said \\"the same as the taco.\\"  \\n\\nFewer questions will reduce the wait time in line.\\n\\nI consider this place a little gem with decent parking and good outside (but no inside) seating."},{"name":"Jam On Hawthorne","address":"2239 SE Hawthorne Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"the bomb.com!!!

The smoked salmon app came with several different kinds of accompaniments and was served fresh and delicious. The english pasty was stuffed with creamy chicken. Yum! But the real star of the meal was the welsh pub burger. Sure a burger seems so simple but this one with knock your socks off. It was topped with welsh rarebit sauce and fried leeks.

I was torn between the Rita's dippin' sandwich and the gator street tacos.

My friends got the shrimp √©touff√©e and the fried pork chops with red beans and rice. We each tasted each other's and everything was very very good. I personally think the √©touff√©e needed to be hotter as it tasted luke warm, but it did have good flavor. The pork chops were very good. The Rita's chicken was my favorite as I love that lemon sauce they top it with. The chicken is tossed in panko crumbs so it was nice and crispy served over rice. It was the perfect portion as I ate all of it but was stuffed. We also shared an order of the beignets and they were soooo good.

Well.. we TRIED to get drinks at the bar.  I could not get anyone's attention.  This is not because they were all actively taking orders or making drinks -- 2 of them were chatting with customers.  Totally fine.  I get it...but you should keep an eye out for someone trying to place an order.  10 minutes later I finally was able to order our drinks.\\n\\nTable service was definitely not great.  The waiter was pretty rude and argumentative (again, see Ettya's review from 3/3/14).  I understand that we're all relatively young looking, but I'm 30-years-old and don't need to be spoken to like I'm a teenager.  In the end, two of us tipped 15% -- YES that is a terrible tip, but we received pretty terrible service.  As we were gathering our things, the waiter came back and said something along the lines of \\"What, was my service really so bad to deserve this tip?\\"  Umm... yes it was.  \\n\\nAside from that, I think that Scampo serves really great food and has a pretty cool atmosphere if you're on a date or are into venues that are see-and-be-seen.

Our group being hangry and all this made all the difference. He made sure to take our drink and food orders as soon as we were ready.

WHAT GREAT SERVICE. \\n\\n| FOOD | \\n\\n- Lemon ricotta pancakes - YUM. I order anything lemon ricotta anything and this did not disappoint. Kinda pricey for only 3 silver dollar pancakes but it's a great contrast to all the savory. \\n\\n- Potatoes Bravas - Ugh, just thinking about my study abroad experience in Spain I had to get this. I love how for this version they have an egg that you crack the yolk for and then mix it together with the sauce to have a nice coating for the crispy potatoes. \\n\\n- Raddichio - I'm not a veggie fan so this was a nice surprise. The pork pieces are AMAZING and could probably eat that all in itself. The dressing is light and the cheese they use to mix in it ties everything all together.\\n\\n- Korean Fried Chicken - A fave of the group. It was spicier than I anticipated to be but it was cooked to perfection and lit a nice fire in our mouths. \\n\\n- Tasty Steak & Cheddar Eggs - MY FAVE. The steak was cooked just right and the eggs scrambled with just enough cheese that it melted in your mouth. The jalapeno cornbread that it is on top just adds a nice kick of spice but just paired oh so well with everything else.

It's a lot more lobster and I am full, and I know many of you out there will appreciate the small amount of bread-- not me because I'm a carb queen. \\n\\nBoth times I got the combo with the chips and drink, and I appreciate all of their fun local soda options. But the NEXT time I come in, I am going to get a regular size Lobster Roll with the soup combo (clam chowder or lobster corn chowder), and I think that will be the perfect amount of fullness and bread to lobster ratio for me.\\n\\nAnd then the time after that, I am looking forward to trying the Luke's Trio, which is half rolls of lobster, crab, and shrimp. And I can't forget to mention again how appreciative I am of their continued efforts and support of sustainable fishing practices.\\n\\nAnother worthy mention this time, is that the guy working the register was so friendly and clearly passionate about working here. He even went around the seating area making sure everyone was enjoying their food, which is not very common for an order at the counter type place."},{"name":"Tasty n Alder","address":"580 SW 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"If you're reading this review to decide what you want to order, put your phone down and order the Steak and Cheddar Eggs. I guarantee you will not be disappointed. I was visiting Portland and Tasty and Alder happened to be my last meal of the trip. The Steak and Cheddar Eggs was definitely the best thing I ate throughout the duration of my week-long trip and I've been to every single 'touristy' and recommended hotspots all over town. I am currently salivating at the thought of the jalapeno butter cornmeal that comes with the juicy steaks and wonderfully seasoned and cheesy eggs. We definitely waited a long time (1.5hr on Saturday morning at 11am), but it's in a fairly central location in downtown, so there's much to look at while you wait. They call you when your table is about ready, so you don't necessarily have to hang around the restaurant while you wait, which is awesome and efficient. We also tried the Korean Fried Chicken and Radicchio Salad-- both which were very yummy as well. With my Korean background, the Korean Fried Chicken definitely recalled some nostalgic and familiar tastes and they definitely hit the nail on the head with this dish. The chicken was a traditional sweet and sour flavor and the pickled veggies had a very familiar Korean side dish taste. Pretty solid dish all around. The radicchio salad was also wonderfully prepared as the sweet and juicy bacon perfectly complimented the bitter radicchio, topped off with a creamy, eggy dressing. Our server was very friendly and welcoming and very informative about their dishes. Tasty n Alder was definitely worth the wait for us and it's the first place I am going back to when I visit again!"},{"name":"Golden Drops Caf√©","address":"1788 Clairmont Rd","city":"Decatur","stars":"4.5","text":"Stopped by after an appointment at the VA.

When I travel out of Austin, I always can't wait to come back for this. Get this dish!!\\n\\nAmbience\\nThe only tiny downside to this place is that it's outdoors (the reason I didn't give it a higher rating).

The soup was excellently creamy and smooth - too bad I can't remember what flavor it was.  But it really hit the spot for an early fall experience.\\n\\nFor the mains, Jimmy had kobe beef brisket burrito, and I had the trout with mustard sauce, arugula, tomatoes.

Wonderfully prepared and a very generous portion.  I normally would have split or taken home, but fish just doesn't reheat well, and I was eating for 2...

Finally after 8-8:15, we got seats and a table.\\n\\nThe first step into the restaurant and you inhale a smell of the ocean and seafood. The restaurant is quite dark and dim. There's not a lot of space or seating in the restaurant. I think it would be wise for them to expand their space. The staff here are very friendly, knowledgeable, and helpful.\\n\\nWe started off with appetizers:\\n\\nThe Fried Ipswish Clams served with tartar sauce was for market price on the evening we went: $21.00. The fried clams were fried to perfection and juicy and full of clam deliciousness inside. I like the tartar sauce a lot because it was rich.\\n\\nI don't recall having razor clams before, but we ordered it and it was excellent and delicious. My friends ordered oysters from the raw bar which I didn't take part in since I detest the smell and looks of oyster. I ordered a shrimp cocktail instead.\\n\\nWe got two bowls of the Wellfleet Clam Chowder, one per couple. The clam chowder is a popular menu item, but honestly I thought it was just alright It's definitely very filling because there's a lot of cream and chunks of potatoes - full on cream and carbs. \\n\\nAnother popular menu item at Neptune Oyster is their Maine Lobster Roll - toasted roll, available hot with butter or cold with mayo (available without roll). We both ordered it hot, but little did we know that it wasn't the best option.\\n\\nThe lobster and roll were both submerged with so much butter that it was too overwhelming. However, the lobster was delicious and so were the fries. The butter did make my boyfriend feel slightly sick, so he wasn't able to finish his half of the lobster roll. \\n\\nWas the five hour wait worth it? I feel the five hour wait was definitely overboard and an experience I never want to experience again at any restaurant. I feel like the wait was almost kind of not worth it because the food wasn't five stars in my opinion, maybe 3.5. Would I return?

Against our better judgment we decided to keep our reservation and sat for dinner. We were seated outside where it didn't appear to be too busy however that didn't matter.  From start to finish we were sitting at the table for over two and a half hours and the majority of the time was spent waiting for drinks or food.  Once we received our food, it ranges from ok to good, nothing really stuck out. My husband and I have dined here before and had a much different experience.

I had a question about how the chef prepared some pickled pears, explaining my husband would love to try and replicate them at home, and not only did the girl behind the bar personally obtain the answer from the chef, later the chef came out and handed my husband a handwritten recipe for the pears!

Aside from the sashimi, I also had the udon.  It was one of the best bowls of udon I have had (and trust me, I have eaten my fair share of udon).  The broth was so incredibly flavorful.  While the price of our meal was high in comparison to other restaurants in the area, it was worth every penny based on the quality of the food.\\n\\nThe service was not as attentive as I would have liked (tea cup sat empty for a while before it was refilled, server was slow bringing our bill), I was willing to overlook it based on what a great meal we had.     \\n\\nFree wifi with Shaw. \\n\\nFree parking available in front and around the restaurant.  \\n\\nI would definitely come back, and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to enjoy a great sushi meal closer to home."},{"name":"Bubor Cha Cha","address":"45 Beach St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"Love this place.

I got two of the veggies burgers expecting, well, veggie burgers. What I got was two hunks of greasy fried cheese slapped on a bun. I couldn't believe it wasn't actually a veggie burger and then I couldn't imagine how anyone would actually like this \\"burger\\" - it was greasy, the cheese was too much.

At least at this location, which I frequent, I feel as though I have been swindled everytime I leave here. I get the same thing everytime I go and it seems as though the employees try a little harder everytime to see how little meat they can get away with portioning into the tacos. On my last visit I had to stop the cashier and ask them to look at one of the tacos. I am not exaggerating one bit when I say I had a couple pieces of ground beef in this taco and the others were not much better at all. Lately they haven't just been skimpy with the protein either. Often times, on special occasions, the Gringos staff will bless me with few strands of shredded cheese. I can no longer justify spending nearly $3 on what is essentially a big empty corn chip in the shape of a taco. I loved Gringos when they opened up downtown and never really had any portion issues then. Somewhere along the line they prioritize their bottom line over the customers they serve. I shouldn't be praying that the person making my tacos today is heavy handed nor should I have to worry about weather or not I will still be hungry after spending $8 at any fast taco spot. The competitor that opened up a few doors down Michigan has rather large tacos for near the same price.

I went on a Tuesday night and there was absolutely no line no wait. The location is so quaint quirky and adorable I loved it. It's a cute food truck like stand with outdoor seating. Lots of seating with picnic style tables and spacious eating area. I love the decor and lights, at night it has a really great vibe especially with the vortex bar next door it feels really lively and quintessentially austin.\\n\\nNow for the pasta, I got the regular red sauce and the carbonara with added honey. You seat yourself and they bring it to you. The wait was kinda long ish but I could imagine it be very long on a busier day so expect a wait time. I'd say we waited 15 mins.\\n\\nThe pasta itself was great. Normally I'm used to a softer noodle but this one was a bit chewier with some resistance to it. Wasn't hard or tough though. Just has a bite to it which at first I wasn't used to but then I grew fond of it. My friend wasn't a fan however as he likes his noodles softer.\\n\\nThe flavor of the red sauce was much on point. Strong tomato flavor with a good amount of cheese and seasonings. Unfortunately they ran out of meatballs by 9:00 so the pasta did feel like it was missing something.. needed some protein. \\n\\nThe carbonara was a refreshingly different from the red sauce especially with that honey. The honey gives an awesome sweet and savory taste, would recommend, really brings out a meaty rich flavor. I think there was meat in this but it was sparse but I did enjoy having something meaty to chew on between bites of pasta.\\n\\nI liked both these dishes equally and I'd say this is pretty good pasta. Me and my friend both agree it is somewhat overhyped and weren't totally blown away (maybe our expectations were already too high) but hey it was still a really good satisfying meal.

They were a textbook perfect refreshment with a fine crushed ice cone topping the glass, bringing a delightful bonus cooling factor to each sip of the muddled fresh lime and mint flavors, well fused with the rest of the subtlety sweet Havana Club rum and soda based drink. We may not have coconut palm trees and a Caribbean climate in the Pacific Northwest, but after a few rounds at this place, it may be almost as good as taking a time machine back to 1950s Havana.\\n\\nThe food looked quite interesting, but we sadly missed it due to a previously planned meal at another fine nearby venue.

Since we were literally reading off the menu it wasn't like it was something she wouldn't understand. I ordered a fish dish and they just made whatever they wanted, not what was on the menu. In the 40 plus minutes we waited for our take out the 3 couples sitting at the tables were so annoyed that 2 of them got up and left, even while there food was cooking and the other had to replace their order twice. I don't know what was going on but it was ridiculous. The food was pretty average. I guess if you don't know a lot about South American food and you live in the burbs this place is special but there are so many better places in Boston."},{"name":"J.

I have enjoyed the salmon dip appetizer, the ribs, the prime rib, the Alex salad (all of J Alexander's salads are huge and filling), and the crab cakes. The crab cakes are at market price .... look please and the price before you order it because I was surprised that our waitress stated that the 2 crab cakes that come with fries were $38!!!!!!! And it comes with fries.. Come on now... any entree that's $38 don't need to come with fries. PERIOD. For my meal, I asked to substitute the fries for the Alex salad and it was an add'l $5. I'm just providing this review as a cautionary tale to others to make sure that you ask the price or make sure your waitress informs you of the price prior to putting the order in.

So, we opted to walk around the neighborhood for a bit. Before we knew it, we were called back for our seats. \\n\\nINSIDE\\nThe reason there is such a wait is because the store itself is quite small/cramped. In a dimly lit restaurant, you are sitting fairly close to the person/table group next to you. Luckily, it wasn't boiling hot in there.\\n\\nFOOD\\nI looked at the menu. The special looked interesting, but it would cost $40ish, so I decided to forgo that. Overall, the entrees are $20-30 and the appetizers are $15-20. I found the scallop dish to be the most appetizing, so I decided to order that. \\n\\nSCALLOPS\\nHonestly, the scallops were okay...\\nI found the scallops to be less soft to bite into than others that I've tried before. It was also a bit on the saltier end. And there was a bit too much bacon bites for my taste. But, I can say that it was quite filling. \\nI wasn't a huge fan and I wouldn't recommend it.\\n\\nMaybe it's because I didn't try the oysters or the other popular options, but judging from the one dish I had, I didn't see why it was such a popular place."},{"name":"Imperial Fez","address":"2285 Peahtree Rd NE, Ste 102","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"Loved this place.

Luckily, while I was in line to order a pizza I saw one table open up and I kept my eye on it.  The manager went over and tore off one of the bathroom quality brown paper towels that sits on the table and, using it dry, gave part of the table one swipe.  I guess in his mind this counts as cleaning a table.  But, from 30 feet away, I could still see tomato sauce on the part of the table that he didn't wipe.\\n\\nMy girlfriend and I went to that same table to sit and wait for our pizza.  The server brought us our burned pizza and set it down and said \\"enjoy\\", and quickly left.  Most likely, she left quickly knowing that it was burned and was embarrassed to serve the pizza.

Modifications of menu items were met with \\"I know the answer will be no, have you thought about...\\" from the server.  Service was not good at all.  The server was largely absent and not interested in helping with the menu or checking in to see how we were enjoying our experience.  With a more that $300 bill (including wine), I expect to be treated better.  Water should never go dry.

Yes, they raised the floor. Why, I don't know. I was told by one museum worker it was because people kept falling down the stairs. Well, maybe those patrons should cut back on the wine at openings and they wouldn't have that problem. \\n\\nThe restaurant is gone, so I hope you don't get hungry. In the place of is another room so that you can be more interactive with the art, which I am all for, but what happens when you get hungry at the art museum? \\n\\nAs for the art itself, the permanent collection has always reminded me of a clearance sale at Macy's. It is on clearance for a reason. No one bought it when it was full price, so either they didn't want it, or it isn't worth it. \\n\\nThe museum has now gone on to arrange the art work in somewhat of a chronological order, and not necessary by genre, but more by themes, such as Love and War. Which might have an piece of Impressionistic and Abstract Expressionism in the same gallery. \\n\\nAs for the Gift Shop: It is small, it is crowded, it is visually unappealing, but if you can make your way through the congestion of bodies meandering around the small space and keep your eye on the prize you will find some interesting items, at reasonable prices. \\n\\nBut all in all, it was a fun day, and I really encourage you to take your child or a friend and look at the collection.

It was delicious and adorned with roasted beets, goat cheese, candied pecans and mixed in a homemade dressing. For our main meal we split the bootleg special and the rice noodle side dish. The bootleg special is a combination of lobster, mussels, clams, shrimp, crawfish, andouille sausage, corn and potatoes all boiled together in a fragrant sauce. You have the option of choosing which sauce you want the seafood to be bathed in and we went for \\"the moonshine.\\" The moonshine tastes a lot like a French onion soup broth. The seafood was cooked to perfection and was the perfect portion for three hungry people. The rice noodle dish seemed like an odd addition to the menu as it was reminiscent of a cold Vietnamese noodle dish, but its lightness complimented the heavy nature of the seafood broth.

Today as per usual I called the lady quoted me 10 mins which is their usually eta, unless they are crazy busy. It always takes me about 10-12 mins to get there from my place, perfect! I got there in about 10 mins, give or take, and there was only one person there, ordering. After she finished I informed the guy behind the window that I was here to pick up. I was waiting a bit longer than usually for it and from what I was quoted  suppose to be done. So, I asked the guy if they were just now making my order? His response was yes so, I let him it was okay and I will have to cancel it bc I have to head to work. At this point I was  fine with the order not be ready, I just had to go. In the process of giving my refund he slyly stated\\" you didn't pick up your order last time so I waited for you to arrive before making it\\" and does a little hip shake right after. Now, I'm frustrated! I was not given a heads up over the phone and not while paying for the items that it was not ready. I'm just going to throw out there out of possibly 30+ orders I was unable to pick up 1! His remake and not given a courtesy heads up is very disappointing.

We ended up in the bar (w/o reservations, wait time was 2 hrs) for Happy Hour and ordered calamari, crab cakes, Caesar salads & a sushi roll.

The phone rang and rang until someone came by, picked it up and told us to hold on a moment. Having this be our first encounter here made me nervous for the rest of our experience. Thankfully we were seated quickly and our server was there to greet us fairly quickly as well. Our food was amazing and my boyfriend said it was one of the best Chop Salads he ever had, as well as my Chicken Enchiladas being seriously yummy. Although when we were done dining and it was clear we were done (one empty plate and my plate pushed to the side waiting for take out packing), it took about 10-15 minutes for the server to even come by and see if we were done/wanted to take anything home. We were kind of getting antsy, I tried to make eye contact with other servers to maybe get some attention but they seemed wrapped up in their own tables.

Not only is it boneless (I'm too lazy to eat around bones), but incredibly juicy. I'm drooling just thinking about it.

It's not bad but it's nothing to write home about.\\n\\nAs for the sides, they are standard. They do a nice country gravy though. I would probably stick with the Mac and cheese or tater tots. Not much of a coleslaw and potato salad gal. Also mushy vegetables (i.e. The cheesy spinach) is a turn off. \\n\\nThe only appie I've had is the pollitos. Underwhelming flavour wise and small portions. You don't need any damn appies when their meat is so good though! \\n\\nOh and drinks! They do a few house beers on tap.

LEGIT FOOD. \\n\\nI was skeptical of a 5 star rating with over 300 reviews so I was prepared to not like it, plus the last two Thai places I tried were terrible, I'm talking GRAY peanut sauce with no flavor, and food served so temperature-hot that the to-go container melted into the food, leaving the food tasting like dishsoap or kid's bubbles. Mmmm, BPA. \\n\\nSo I had a doctor visit at Concentra on Airport Way, and I think Sa Bai was about 1 mile from there, so we'd been kinda schemin' on the menu all day, hoping it would live up to the hype. \\n\\nCame in and ordered the spring rolls to start. They were served (2, cut in half, so 4 halves) in a wicker basket with extra fixings. They were filled with carrot, cabbage and possibly kale? The basket had more of the same. The peanut sauce that came with them was astronomically good and probably about a 4 oz container. I was actually spooning the sauce into my maw. \\n\\nAsked about their drinks, they had a Thai Tea Lemonade, which I thought would be like a Thai Arnold Palmer. We both got those, lime juice and thai tea, served in a cute lil mason jar, with a few squeezed lime wedges. SO good. Smoky thai tea flavor and tart lime. You can taste the care in the produce selection. Our server said the cook/owner(?) is picky about produce and hand selects everything from markets and does a lot of local business, including the noodles. \\n\\nI ordered the drunken noodle with tofu as a mild because she talked me out of medium. I noticed she was pretty aggressive at talking people out of medium, saying it was like most other places \\"hot\\". I got mild and there was no spice. If medium was hot, then mild should be medium. Nope, mild was mild. Next time I'll go to medium. The tomatoes were perfectly cooked and flavorful, like from someone's garden, they didn't taste mass-produced or grocery quality. They weren't mealy or watery but rich and savory, salty and metallic. Mmmmm, tomatoes. I gobbled down the noodles, saying they were probably the best drunken noodles I've ever had. \\n\\nBoyfriend ordered the crispy spicy chicken salad. Let's be clear. It's not a salad. It's very crispy, light, spicy chicken. There are no greens, no rice, no noodles, just a pile of crispy chicken. I tried a few bites, it was well cooked, the fry didn't overpower the chicken, they were balanced. It wasn't too spicy (again, probably mild). The presentation of both dishes was nice, and the produce was top quality. \\n\\nIt took forever to get our bill, so long in fact, boyfriend went to the register where people were placing to-go orders and was asked, \\"Here or to go?\\" Ummmm well we *had* here, now we want to go? We were there so long, they forgot we existed. \\n\\nBut the food was really remarkable, and it was dinner time, they were moderately busy (5-6 tables and 2-3 to go orders in about 30-60 min) with 1-2 servers. I haven't had such a satisfying meal in months. We almost went to go check out Salty's oyster happy hour but I'm so glad we opted for DELICIOUS, perfect, awesome, pretty, local, reasonable thai food. \\n\\nWish I'd taken pics but I just snarfled everything down real quick. A note for my personal preferences, this drunken noodle was tofu/veg heavy and noodle light. Next time, I'd order extra noodles or half the tofu. I was left with a pile of tofu and broccoli, with carrot medallions and sauce but no noodles. I just really, really, really liked those noodles."},{"name":"The Thurman Cafe","address":"183 Thurman Ave","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"While the famous Therminator Burger is an impressive sandwich, the size far outweighs the taste (which was just okay).

We order three dishes that were all seafood based: the seafood tower, littleneck clams, and scallops. The seafood in the seafood tower wasn't exactly filling even though it stated that it serves four people. The portion size was no where near enough to fill even two people. The seafood was very flavorful and tasty though! I would say the other two dishes were also very small in size, but I had seen the pictures ahead of time so I knew what I was getting. The scallops had a VERY strong and slightly stinky flavor that may not be well liked by everyone-- I thought it was pretty tasty especially with the sauce they provided to tone down the seafood taste. The littleneck clams were very delicious with the broth it came in. There's a taste of wine that goes really well with the clams! Overall the prices were quite high for the portion size, but if you're there for vacation I'd say the experience itself also covers some of the bill! Our waitress was extremely sweet and helpful!

Wish I had ordered something less greasy, and with a bit more flavor. I also wanted a noodle dish, so I got the Chicken Chow Fun with gravy. It was a some standard Chow Fun. Not a whole lot going on. If I weren't dining alone, I would have ordered a couple of other dishes to try. \\n\\nNot the best service. The guy brought me water, took my order, brought my food and disappeared. Didn't check up on me after either. I eventually walked up to the counter to ask for my bill and paid. Then left.

However, I was bothered while balancing my checkbook (yup, I know it's old fashioned but this is a perfect example why it's a good idea...) to find that they charged me $3.5 More than what I authorized. I gave more than 15% tip, which I thought was good since I only saw our waitperson 1x during our meal. My writing was very clear so no chance it was a goof. When I called today and spoke to Mark Pham, assistance manager, he insisted unless I drive into Boston to clear it up they wouldn't do anything. However, when I told him what they had done was credit card fraud and would be contacting the Attorney General's office, he told me they could send a check for the $3.5. He called back to say the manager was away on vacation until next week. I told him I would be willing to wait. So I'll wait to see if they follow through. This is not the first time I've come across a restaurant fudging with the tip amount. It's up to patrons to make sure they're getting charged the correct amount.

Not good.  It was so salty I couldn't believe it.  I hadn't even dipped it in butter.  Good crab meat does not need butter.  The leg had a decent amount of meat in it and was sweet despite all the salty but for that kind of money I expected something tastier.\\nThe sides: \\ngarlic mashed potatoes that were very dense and did not taste like garlic \\nstring beans- just ok.\\n\\nA couple of side notes...\\nThe wait staff were very friendly and helpful but perhaps a bit misguided?\\nWe all had wanted side salads but the restaurant only offered \\"full\\" salads.  We were assured that the salad was large and plentiful.  It was not.  The salad looked like a side salad.  It was a good salad though.\\nSimilarly, when it was time for dessert, I ordered this crazy peanut butter mousse in a chocolate cup thing and the waiter said it was HUGE!  Again...it was not lol.

Located at the Grand Floridian Resort and perched right on the Seven Seas Lagoon with a perfect view of Cinderella's Castle and Magic Kingdom, is screams magic and beauty (cheesy as that sounds).  The inside of the building is like the inside of a huge gazebo, and has beautiful slats of wood lining the ceiling with tables all along the windows overlooking the Lagoon.  The ambiance is perfect for a romantic dinner with a loved one or for an elegant dinner out with family and/or friends.  There is a dress code and you'll almost always need reservations to get a table here, but the atmosphere and the food are well worth it! \\n\\nTry and time your reservation about 45 min-1 hour out from the fireworks show at Magic Kingdom to get the ultimate experience, as they dim all the lights and the music from the firework show is piped into the building, so you have an up-close and personal view of the best fireworks at Disney World.  If the weather is nice, you can also take your drink and go outside on their deck to see the show (or if people stand in front of your view which may happen from time to time - the deck is open to all guests unfortunately).  \\n\\nTheir menu options are varied, with plenty of seafood options and other proteins for patrons to enjoy.  I usually get a seafood dish when I come to Narcoosees, and recently ordered their Wild Caught Shrimp and Garganelli Pasta dish.  It was superb, as usual.  Before your entrees come out, they'll bring out a basket of warm, homemade sourdough bread with their butter sprinkled with Hawaiian sea salt (yum!).  \\n\\nWe also ordered a wine sampler and my mother and I split the wines before both choosing to order a glass of one of the three Cabrenet's we tried.  They have a solid wine collection, favoring wines from California (which is great for Napa lovers like me).  \\n\\nWe were celebrating my mother's birthday and they brought out a complimentary almond-crusted cheesecake with Lambert cherry sauce and a cute little white chocolate sign that has \\"Happy Birthday from Narcoossee's\\" printed.

He was severly disappointed in the quality and quantity. You seriously only get 3 scallops and they were a tad overcooked (guess we should have read Yelp before we ordered)! The mashed potatoes were gritty but hey, the vegies were good. For $24 I'd expect a little more bang for the buck. My chicken parm was average but again, skimpy on the protein.

The tap water is gross. \\n\\nWhen my omelet came on my first bite it had two pieces of celery. Yuck. It took about 10 minutes to get my servers attention. Another 8-10 for the omelet to be remade. They took back the omelet with no problem but never apologized. My server just blamed the cook stating she underlined no celery. It's just like man take responsibility and don't blame others you know?... Anyways. By the time I got my correct omelet my hubs was done eating and my toast was cold and soggy. The omelet was bland. The potatoes were frozen and reheated on a skillet - you can tell. \\n\\nOn the bright side, it seemed busy enough. And there was a local who the servers knew by name which was nice. (Insert Cheers music here... \\"Where everybody knows your name..\\"). \\n\\nOverall, I was expecting more from this highly reviewed breakfast joint. I wouldn't suggest it to many of any. Its def overrated. But at least the prices are reasonable."},{"name":"Portland City Grill","address":"111 SW 5th Ave, Fl 30","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"The crab cakes are delicious!"},{"name":"Big Fin Seafood Kitchen","address":"8046 Via Dellagio Way","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Food was amazinggg.

Our waitress came over fairly quickly with menus and to take our drink orders (tap water for both).\\n\\nWe decided to start with the Mars Salad (arugula / prosciutto / green apple / candied pecan / bleu cheese / balsamic vinaigrette) and it took us about 10 minutes to decide on what two pizzas to share. Tasty salad and enough to share. \\n\\nMy friend has gluten insensitivity and though they offer GF crust for a $2.50 upcharge, she decided to have it on regular crust so we ordered two small pizzas:\\n\\nNeytiri VEGAN on Mulitgrain dough:\\nevoo & garlic / regularly with teese mozzarella but we substituted regular mozzarella / teriyaki portobello mushroom / red onion / broccoli / pineapple\\n\\nEnder on Beer Dough\\nevvo & garlic / saucer cheese / bacon / cajun chicken / broccoli / scallion / sweet haba√±ero\\n\\nWhen the pizzas were brought over, we asked the server if there was a spatula or pizza serving utensil and he looked at us strangely so my friend said \\"I guess we just use our knives and fingers and he replied \\"yes\\".  Odd ....we've always been served pizza at a restaurant with something to lift it off the pan.  Didn't think that was such a strange request?\\n\\nI tried a slice of the Neytiri first. The crust was quite firm with ample fresh ingredients. I tasted a balsamic glaze possibly from the teriyaki mushrooms but my friend thought it needed some sort of \\"sauce\\".  She was not a fan of the crust, prefers lighter.\\n\\nThen I moved to the Ender. My first slice didn't have any chicken but lots of bacon. The beer dough was quite fluffy and tasty. My friend could taste the beer, I could not.  This was the favorite of our two pizzas.  \\n\\nWhen our tab was presented, my friend mentioned the Groupon and our waitress began the redemption process and stopped to say \\"Wait, we don't accept these on Friday's\\" and confirmed that with her manager.  My friend did not read the fine print carefully and it did state valid Mon-Thurs. only.  What a bummer!  We would have been happy to redeem the Groupon for the value paid but decided to give it to a friend who lives locally since we will never have the opportunity to visit on a Mon-Thurs.

The chicken is a little sweet and mustard-y. It's just the right balance between saucy and dry. The mac and cheese is really thick and creamy (and a little reminiscent of Velveeta.)

The only redeeming factor was the peach jam, a true gem.\\nA friend ordered the ribs and gives them a mixed review. They are dry, so if you like your ribs saucy, she'd recommend something else.

While I'm not against experimentation as a rule, when it comes down to it, I want crust, sauce, cheese, meat, veggie. I'm also on record that the Neapolitan-style pie that seems to be this city's specialty is not my favorite. Every style can be good at its best (see: Artisan Pizza, Ken's), but the overpopulation of the type wears my taste buds out. Where's the variety? And I'm not talking about a \\"new potatoes with chive\\" pizza, here.\\n\\nWithout getting into too much of a philosophical debate about what does and doesn't entail a pizza, let's get down to brass tacks: so how are the pies?\\n\\nThis place changes its menu selections based on seasonal ingredients, so a flagship CHOP Salami pizza aside, there are a rotating cast of characters here. If you're of the mind that anything that's edible can go on a pizza in some fashion, then check the menu periodically (on their comically amateurish Wordpress-hosted website) and see what piques your interest.\\n\\nIf you're more of the mindset that putting certain things and calling it a pizza is a culinary abomination (root vegetables, squash, eggplant, broccoli, cauliflower...), then good news! Life of Pie is just a 10-minute walk from here.\\n\\nAll in all, the food is pretty good. I've sampled a few of their seasonal pies that come closest to being actual pizza (most recently, the morel mushrooms with pecarino and foraged greens), and it's a functional floofy pie. Normally, I'd give a marginal thumbs up based on their ability to turn our something tasty on its face... However!\\n\\nTheir food is crazy expensive. Most of the 12\\" pies clock in at the $18 mark, which I mean, WHAT!?! $13 for a Margherita? What is going on here? Do they source their tomatoes from Mars? Are they making the cheese out of unicorn milk or something? Their pricing is out of control.\\n\\nSecond, their service is bad, bad, bad. Pizzas take forever and a day to make it to your table. I suspect this is a limitation imposed upon them by their wood-fired oven, but I've been to Oven & Shaker, Life of Pie, et al., and you don't wait HALF as long for similar style pizzas. The only time it's acceptable for pizza to be delivered in the 30-45 minute range is if it's Chicago style.\\n\\nThe Portland Pizza scene is kind of distressing. Not because of places like Lovely's and Ken's and Life of Pie and Ash. Experimentation is fine. I just don't like that the focus on pies here works is on what is perceived to be some sort of culinary cutting edge. I want somebody to come to town, create a solid, straight down the line pizza for a price that won't make you take a second mortgage out on your home."},{"name":"One Taco","address":"520 W 6th St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"The menu online is different than what they actually offer.

You should call to make an order next time.\\"  Why have online ordering turned on if you know it's a problem??  \\nThen after like 30 minutes of waiting I finally got the food and -stupid me- I didn't check the food because I assumed they would at least try to get the order correct.

None of that happened.\\n\\nWhen we *finally* got our food, it came out one dish at a time. One of our friends got his food when the rest of us had nearly finished! But let me tell you - everything we ordered was amazing. I could tell that lots of love and care had gone into every dish, and nothing disappointed. Here's a rundown of the amazing things we had:\\n* chicken wings and waffles - crispy, delicious, and drenched in maple syrup\\n* bourbon waffles - delicious\\n* omelette - it looked big and fresh, and my friend loved it\\n* red velvet pancake - shaped like a heart and deliciously sweet\\n* candied bacon, egg, and cheese croissant - my friend scarfed every bit\\n* red pepper grits - seriously good grits that are cooked to perfection!\\n\\nOnce we had our food, our server warmed up a little and actually got us refills. Then, he came by with his iPad to get our checks. It was super awkward trying to recount everything we ate for the server to charge us, and then we had to pay right then on the spot. Right before I swiped my card and added the tip, our server declared, \\"I'm the only one in here today, so I'm sorry I'm not on my A-game.\\"\\n\\nWow. Talk about a sorry-ass apology.\\n\\nIn better news, everyone else we encountered was very sweet, and it's clear the cooks know their shit when it comes to food. There was just no one to own the entire experience and help pull this all together. My advice to SuperChefs is to hire a GM. My advice for anyone thinking about giving this place a try, go! Just expect a seriously long wait, awkward to terrible service, and ridiculously good food."},{"name":"Le Coq Au Vin","address":"4800 S Orange Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Great food great people.

As far as beer selection goes this place can't be beat anywhere in Boston.  No other place even comes close.  If you are into beer, this is where you need to be drinking.  \\n\\nThe atmosphere is really cool too.  It's all wood, couches, tall ceilings, and dimly lit.  Great for an after work get together.  \\n\\nUnfortunately, the food is not that great.  It pains me to write that because I do love this bar and the food they serve at their New York location.  I went on a weekend with a group and we ordered a lot off the menu.  Some good and some bad.  First the Poutine is really good.  The Mac and cheese is not good at all. It is very milky. They really need to adjust that recipe a bit.  Our group order three of the pretzels. All three came out hard, cold and with almost no salt.  And for the price, they were pretty small.   As for the sandwiches: the grilled cheese is actually very good, I would order it again.  The roast beef sandwiches is a cold sandwich (they should make that clear on the menu)   Plus the little ramekin of au jus they give you makes it very awkward to eat.  You don't usually get au jus with a cold sandwich.  We also got the pork belly sliders and were not impressed.   \\n\\nI'm hoping that the food issues are more due to the place just opening up.

The garden salad with citrus vinaigrette gets my vote for best side salad in town (it's $7.95 and not huge, but worth it).  Wine selection & juice selection are also good.  The main problem with this place is the acoustics!  If you're easily jarred by LOUD dining rooms, then don't dare go near the place at peak hours.

When I lived in Japan, natives would take me to their favourite ramen joints - and at the end of the meal, I would always think, \\"What's the big deal?\\".  Over the years, I would always give popular ramen places a shot - but always felt it never quite hit a spot that good pho or good Chinese noodle in soup could hit.  Like Teddy KGB, [Russian accent] \\"I feel so unsatisfied\\".\\n\\nMy buddy, who is a ramen connoisseur, wanted to give the Gyoza King-backed GMen Ramen a go.  Remembering the Yelper love to this place, I tagged along.  The place is pretty small and was glad to see there was no lineup for dinner.  There is a large flatscreen TV where they looped an old kung fu/action TV series named... wait for it... \\"GMen '75\\".  The coolest part is that it features Bolo Yeung (from 'Bloodsport' and 'Enter the Dragon' fame) in his prime - flexing and kicking ass.  That's an instant extra star from me for dinner entertainment alone.\\n\\nSitting down and staring blankly at the menu, I would shocked to see \\"soupless ramen\\" on the menu.  Had no idea such a creature existed (once again, I'm a ramen clod).  I wanted to try it, but the allure of the $9 \\"Project G\\" Glico x G-Men Curry Ramen was too tempting to pass up for this collaboration hypebeast whore.  Maybe this dish could bridge my obsession with Japanese curry over to ramen.\\n\\nIt was definitely unique - and I don't mean 'unique' in a bad way.  It's been a couple of days since I ate it and I'm still trying to mentally process the mixture of fatty broth and mild-hot, savoury curry.  According to the menu, this is the third 'generation' of the curry ramen experiment (they also have a soupless curry ramen).  This is a first for me, the waitress even pushed us for feedback on the curry soup.  I was a bit too taken aback to offer any meaningful insight - my buddy felt it was a bit too salty, but was too nice to 'break her heart.'\\n\\nHowever, the density of the ramen was perfect and the toppings (green onion, earwood mushrooms, egg, fatty BBQ pork and seaweed) were good.  And probably the first time I walked out of a ramen shop thinking \\"That was a good meal\\" having hit my 'soup-noodle spot' with a good blend of fatty and savoury.  My friend still likes Kintaro better (which I wasn't impressed by) as he felt the toppings were lacking - but thinks he should give it another shot with a traditional ramen since he didn't like the curry broth.\\n\\nService is prompt and every table gets a large pitcher of water -- we also got some free chocolate Pocky.  The $9 Curry Ramen and $4.50 appetizer gyozas (which was good) includes tax already - I like seeing the bill end in round numbers.  This place is cash-only, so be ready with a Laurier or two.\\n\\nI can't say that I would pick ramen over pho or Chinese noodle in soup yet, but I will be tempted to come back to try their more traditional servings and I'm interested if they keep going with their curry ramen evolution."},{"name":"Thai Pasta Cuisine","address":"11461 SW Scholls Ferry Rd","city":"Beaverton","stars":"4","text":"Always enjoy eating here.

Our server didn't introduce herself, but by the receipt she is 43450. She took our drink order which was a martini and a beer. It took about 10 minutes to get. We finished our first drinks, and by that time it was happy hour so we ordered food. People started to roll in and fill the restaurant up. It took about 40 minutes and two more drinks each before our food got to the table.  People all around us that ordered food after us got their orders before us. The server didn't check in with us again until close to the end of our meal. If she had, she would have realized sooner that she didn't give us napkins or silverware. Once she did, she brought over napkins, but no silverware. I suppose she felt it didn't matter at that point since we were close to being finished.

So  as you can imagine this is not a food review. \\n\\nThoughts and Recommendations:\\n- Sound Table transitions from a restaurant to bar/dance space after 10PM on Friday and Saturday (as far as I know). My husband and I like coming here drinks, meeting up with friends, and having a good time. The dance floor really picks up around midnight so depending on what vibe you're going for you may want to arrive earlier or later. \\n- Slow or not enough bartenders. This has been my experience with Sound Table 9/10 times. It's nearly impossible to get to the bartender. There's been times where my husband and I just give up after waiting for 20 minutes.\\n- No parking. Which is how a lot place are in Atlanta but it's good you know in advance. Street parking is your best bet. There's a small lot next door but don't count on finding a spot (which you'd have to pay for). \\n- There's a small patio in the back if you need a smoke which is nice if that's what you do.\\n\\nOverall, this is a fun small space to hang.

On July 1, they raised the price to $17.00! We thought it was a mistake on our bill.  The poor student server explained that there was a sign at the front, but that it wasn't a mistake. The way management is trying to explain it is that they've kept prices low for years, so now they include soup (don't want it) and raised the price 113% !! With tip (which I didn't hold against the student server), it was $21 for a single salad with some bacon bits and cubed ham.  Ludicrous.  After such an egregious raise in price, servers should be instructed to warn people who order the salad bar about the change in price and allow them to make the decision whether or not to order it (a regular salad on the menu is only $11).

At both places you will wait in line for about 3-4 hours.  Ok so now you get it a little better hopefully. \\n\\nI do think good things are worth waiting for and in the case of Neptune it definitely paid off!  We arrived a little after 7:00 pm.  Here is how it works - you stand outside in a short line to talk to the lady that sticks her head out the door every now and then.  She asks you how many are in your party and then takes your phone number.  They will call you when it is about 15-10 minutes before you are going to get seated.  I love this method personally because you are required to just stand in one spot for a long period of time!  During this process we got to know the people in front of and behind us in line.  My husband and I then made our way down the street strolling for a bit.  We stopped in the pub across the way to burn some time and have some drinks.\\n\\nFinally slightly after 10pm we were called.  When we arrived it was interesting to see the people who lasted and the ones that did not.  We were all super excited to indulge in a dining experience we have been anticipating for some time. We were seated by our friends from line and some people that were at the end of their meal.  All the seating in the restaurant is super close and tight, so you can talk to the table next to you easily.\\n\\nWe ordered a round of rose wine for the two of us and then the big order.  If you come here you must try the Lobster roll - it is a must for sure!  We got it warm and it was so buttery and delicious. The lobster literally melted in my mouth!  We also go the North End Cioppino, which was a fish stew.  It was so creamy.  We also ordered the Neptune Plateau, which is was a nice sample of oysters, clams, mussels, shrimp, lobster and crab.  Everything was super fresh!  I loved the crab salad that came with it too.  We even ended up sharing some things with the table next to us - our line friends.  \\n\\nSo if you are going to come to Neptune and really do it up - then do it up! Order everything you would want.

Sitting in the car, something compelled me to go back into the restaurant and assess the situation again.  Fortunately for me, I realized that the 20-25 people standing around the food bar were waiting in line to pay with individual checks.  That meant no competition for the food.  I rushed back out to the car and waved everyone back into the restaurant.

I wish the rice wasn't literally given all saran wrapped up, but I guess it makes sense to present it that way instead of pre-mixing it in the salad. The blue crab was a nice touch--(psst: y'all are supposed to eat the whole crab shell and all), but I would have liked some more meat in it. I got like 99% shell and like 1% meat, but the portions are huge. I packaged my leftovers for lunch the next day, so that was a score.

Wait, this is an airport?\\n\\nThe first time I drove to this restaurant, I thought it was actually a golf course instead of an airport. There were a couple of golf-like carts and a lack of indication of the presence of planes around. It's a hidden gem though and definitely worth the look.\\n\\nI went for the lamb souvlaki and ordered it medium rare, knowing that it was going to end up being medium. And yes, it ended up being medium. The lamb was good though, as it managed to be pretty tender and flavorful. The lemon juice marinade does show. Getting two skewers is another positive. The large amount of rice and grilled pita bread will fill you up at the end.\\n\\nThe spankopita is definitely two meals in one. The spinach pie is one large fillo parcel with spinach/feta goodness inside. The fillo was crispy and not greasy, while the filling was abundant and savory. I could only manage to eat half for lunch, so it ended up being dinner later. It's substantial, to say the least.\\n\\nWhat diminishes this restaurant to a 4-star affair? The green bean side that came with both meals was tasteless and cooked to crap. If you're going to serve a Greek salad at a Greek restaurant, and I realize it's a side salad, but have more than just one minute olive. Lastly, while the wait staff can be friendly (they were to me at the end), sometimes being chatty can slow down service a little. \\n\\nGreat lunch place if you're working around here, but maybe expect a drop in productivity after a meal like this.

After eating a ridiculous fantasy breakfast, my BFF takes me to Arden's Garden.  I had the insane idea that I would do one of the 2 day detox things that she is honestly, always yapping about. \\n\\n This was the first time I had been to any  of the  stores, so, after I walked in, read the ingredients, looked at the juices, glanced at the turd of wheatgrass coming out of the juicer  and disdainfully examined the raw food items, I turned to my friend and said, \\"Um yeah.  Sorry.  I don't think I can do this.\\"\\n\\n  Flash forward 15 minutes to me pounding back a  'grand slam' (1 oz shooters of lemon, ginger and cranberry juice after a shot of wheatgrass) while being cheered on by the staff, my friend and a fellow customer.  Next thing I know, I'm breaking a hundred dollar bill and leaving with 12 bottles of juice.  Hello?  What the hell just happened?  That has gotta be the fastest conversion known to man.  \\n\\nI'm still a little confused myself, but it was a combination of super customer service...totally helpful, knowledgeable but not at all pushy and about 6 customer testimonies. And, the dreaded \\"Buy 10 Get 1 Free\\".  If you tell me this, I will instantly become a maniacal consumer, and frantically try to rationalize why I need 10 of whatever it is that you are selling.  This is a small part of what happened to me today in Arden's Garden. Somehow, that wall of juices that once looked repulsively slimy and disgusting became a treasure chest of jeweled treats that could restore health and vitality to my poor battered body.  I wanted to feel great and have totally clear skin and better joint health like everyone else.  I wanted to detox, get healthy, rejuvenate, regenerate,  meet the love of my life,  have three beautiful children and retire in Tahiti...all compliments of the best juice ever.  Okay, so that was a bit much, but it's not that far off from what the customers were saying. \\n\\nSo far, so good.  I love that the ingredient list is like, um, totally natural. Apple juice isn't a filler for anything.   The juices actually expire, and I don't mean months after you buy them.  No added sugar.  Lots of veggies.  Fun blends.  And surprisingly, I didn't gag.  Not one time.  They taste great.  Okay, I did get one juice that isn't exactly a party in my mouth, but when I thought about the party for my insides, my mouth pretty much got on board.  I feel like a  new person, and I thank my food loving fellow fatty for introducing me to this.  We shall see how long this state of juice induced euphoria lasts. I'm excited about the possibilities and for right now, Arden...I love you, and your garden."},{"name":"RusTeak Restaurant & Wine Bar","address":"1568 Maguire Rd","city":"Ocoee","stars":"4","text":"I love this place.

I'm not sure if they thought we were tourists so they didn't have to try hard or the place is really that bad.\\n\\nThe morning shift consisted of at least 8 waitresses, all of whom spent more time gossiping with one another than waiting on their tables. We had to wait extended periods of time to place our food and drink orders and at the end of our meal we had to play the old \\"stack the plates, pull the wallet out and continue to stare in their general direction so they understand that we need our check\\" game because there was absolutely no tableside service once our food was dropped off.

I feel like the owners and operators have absolutely no pride in the work they are doing.  \\n\\nThe Food: The ribs taste like they were grilled high and dry, rather than smoked low and slow.  The collards seem to be shredded fine and boiled on high to the point of oblivion and then served.  The so-called BBQ at Kroger is literally better than GQs in every way.  \\n\\nThe Space: The decor is tacky and cheap-looking (e.g., fake bricks, painted dingy tiles, low quality finishes).  I'm not picky on this topic, especially given The Shack is one of my favorite BBQ spots around.  What bothers me is that is looks like someone put effort in but managed to fail miserably, versus The Shack...which just is what it is, take it or leave it.  \\n\\nThe Service: I've left this restaurant a couple of times before even ordering because they weren't ready/cleaning, etc.  The staff doesn't seem engaged or even paying attention to delivering basic service.  \\n\\nTo sum up, come to GQs, the pride of Pittsburgh, if you're looking to pay the same price as the competition, but end up with a plate of steaming hot garbage."},{"name":"The Mighty Bowl","address":"108 W 8th St","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4.5","text":"I am so thrilled to have this food cart at my college campus.

My. GOD. This is DAMN good pizza.\\n\\nAccording to the Amazon delivery person, the P.Za Worthington location is operating out of Buca di Bepo's -- which makes this pizza even more amazing. More on that in a moment.\\n\\nWe've ordered two days in a row from this place. Yesterday we tried the Sausage Bianca & the Fungi alla Fontina (the two white pizzas) with a Caprese salad; today we did the Amatriciana & the Meatball Ricotta with a Panzanella salad.\\n\\nWow, wow, WOW.  \\n\\nOkay, look. I have nothing against Buca di Bepo's; its food is okay, but nothing special. It's just a place to go to get lots of food in a cheesy Italian-American family-style setting.

Light, thick, chewy crusts cut Chicago-style, with just the right amount of cheese, sauce & meat & this is freakin' pizza HEAVEN.

An incredibly spicy-hot hot-pepper that made me gag, set my entire mouth on fire, and sent me running to the kitchen for a glass of milk, then butter/bread...good GODS, P.Za, add a warning to your item description, please!!! All your description says is \\"roasted red pepper\\": those are supposed to be red bell peppers, which aren't hot at all. When I look up recipes for \\"Italian roasted red peppers\\", it's red bell peppers. I doubt I'll be the only person to make that mistake. The menu item on Amazon does not list any other type of pepper in the salad, either.\\n\\nPlease, P.Za, you owe your customers that warning. That was a very painful, unpleasant experience that marred an otherwise wonderful meal & is why I only rated 4 stars. (seriously, that effin' HURT.)\\n\\n(Edited: I need to note that the Caprese salad & the housemade dressing WERE very tasty & delicious up until that point! It's just whatever those peppers were, they looked like cherry tomatoes, and no hot peppers were noted in the description.

The parking lot had plenty of spots AND I appreciate not having to valet park my car, despite it being a pretty high end restaurant. We found a spot a few steps from the entrance at around 7:15pm on a Saturday night, which we were happily surprised and overjoyed especially when it started pouring at the end of our meal.\\n\\nSecondly, the service was pretty great. We made a reservation for 7:30pm, but arrived 15 mins early (no traffic - our lucky day!), and were seated 5 mins later. We were seated at a table near the window, which gave us a good view into their open kitchen and away from the hustle and bustle of the main area of the restaurant. Our server appeared to be new, but was very professional and attentive. She promptly double-checked on a few menu questions/requests we had and got all our food out in a reasonable time. She also checked in on us throughout, without being overly intrusive which I appreciated.\\n\\nLast but not the least - the food! Oh the food - I still think about it now several days later. We started with the lobster ravioli appetizer for my hubby and she crab soup for me - both were out of this world delicious! Next came the Caesar salad, which was the only thing that missed the mark hence the 4 star rating instead of 5. That may seem like harsh, but how does one mess up a simple Caesar salad?! It was drenched in the salad dressing, tasted like it had been sitting for a while, and only had ONE crouton in the entire bowl. But the good news is that the main courses and dessert that followed were all excellent! The hubs had the bone-in ribeye medium rare with a loaded baked potato, and said it was the best steak he's ever had. This is saying volumes because he's had a lot of steaks, one may even consider him a steak-fanatic/addict. I had the Crawfish Bayou Barataria, without the andouille sausage, and it was SO good! The linguine pasta tasted freshly made and were so light and bouncy, there was a generous amount of crawfish, and the sauce perfectly coated the dish. We both saved room for dessert so had enough food to take home and have a second meal afterwards! Now the dessert. Neither of us could resist a warm brownie with vanilla ice cream, so that was an easy choice. The icing on the top? That layer of Hershey's chocolate on top of the warm and gooey brownie! Oh. My.

Someone else mentioned that and I brushed it off but it is indeed an issue. They say that their food is meant to be shared, wasn't sure what that was supposed to mean at first but it is clearly an excuse for bringing the food out so late because none of their portions are exactly \\"shareable\\". \\n\\nWe ordered the tartare, bulgogi, and the wagyu with chimichurri. I was about to order the A1 Wagyu but the waiter saved me from a big mistake, supposedly that dish is only 2 oz of meat. 2 oz!! Who the heck would want 2oz of steak and be satisfied?\\n\\nHowever, the quality of food is undeniable. The tartare was amazing. Packed with flavor, incredibly fresh and delectable. The bulgogi was also good. Won't say it was amazing, definitely a step down from the tartare. Their meat was nicely charred and flavored but the kimchi is downright shameful, better to take that off their menu entirely. Overly sour, overly spicy, a very cheap imitation of authentic kimchi. \\n\\nHowever, then finally. After helping my girlfriend finish her dish we patiently waited, and it finally came. The savior of the night. The Wagyu. Utterly. Heavenly. Was ready to give this place 2 stars, but this dish blew me away. Maybe the most tender meat I have ever had, and the chimichurri was the perfect complement though it was an absurdly small portion.\\n\\nWill I go here for again? Perhaps.

I usually go for simplicity and just order a toasted bagel with avocado, but another variation that I love is hummus + tabouli (but only if they have parsley based tabouli!! sometimes they have dry, bulgur based  tabouli, and it's not nearly as good). \\n\\nThis Darwin's usually has some sort of vegan cookie available, and I can never resist getting one because they are so. damn. good.

The property looks like an old apartment complex but there are actually condos upstairs.  \\n\\nWe had a 9pm reservation for a birthday dinner so it was dark when we arrived. We actually passed up the spot and had to turn around because it is hard to see the opening in the dark (poor lighting, but there is a sign). Once we drove up, we saw a sign for complimentary valet parking. We were greeted and there was a woman at the door who welcomed us and advised where to turn for the elevator. We were told the restaurant was formerly a cafeteria and has been open since 1978. As we exited the elevator, I felt like I was in a beautiful cave. The lighting was dim, the colors dark but warm as we walked toward the dining area. \\n\\nBar - we found our party at the bar waiting for our table to be prepared. The bar is stocked but tiny. There were about six chairs at the bar. The female bartender was friendly and made great, strong drinks which we loved. \\n\\nThere were eight people in our party so we were seated near the patio area at a large oval table. We had two waiters, one of which had a lovely Italian accent.  He tried to help us pronounce the words on the menu correctly while narrating the menu.  The other was all about keeping us entertained. They were a perfect mix!\\n\\nWe were told they have had the same chef for over 40 years! Wow! The menu is extensive, so there is something for everyone. Meat eaters, pescatarians, vegans and vegetarians; we had all of the picky eaters in out party. Lol. But it was not an issue, the bartender was vegan so she came over to suggest options and there were a few vegetarian dishes on the menu to choose from as well as seafood, steak and chicken. \\n\\nFood - the bread was fresh, hot and soft like I like it and it was accompanied by butter, olive oil and an eggplant spread (so awesome). I ordered the Sacchetti di Formaggio (aka little sacks)! Oh my gosh! It was so full of flavor and melted in my mouth. I actually asked for a spoon as to not waste any of the sauce. It was so good I actually wanted to lick the plate! No joke! \\n\\nAdditional dishes ordered at the table were: \\nChiocciole Aglio Olio Con Spinaci (snails)\\nRisotto\\nGnocchi di Patate con Salsa\\nCappellini con Pancetta, Gambretti (prawns)\\nVegan (spicy marinara over penne pasta with vegetables)\\nSacchetti di Formaggio (little sacs)\\nCostolette Di Agnello Alla Griglia Con Pesto \\nPetto Di Pollo Ripieno Di Prosciutto \\n\\nEvery loved the dishes ordered. We were a happy table! Learned a little Italian, laughed a lot and had great cocktails and food. What more can you ask for?

Grilled octopus was tender and not overcooked, yet the char marks had a truly unpleasant burned taste, the only seasoning was salt (and too much of it), and it was served in a pool of unremarkable oil with cracked olive and a small wedge of lemon that didn't do nearly enough to balance the flavors. The pork skewer was similarly uninspired. Decently seasoned, but 2 of the 6 small pieces on the skewer were unpleasantly fatty, and the sauce on the plate, while ok, really didn't compliment the meat well, and seemed oddly random. \\n     Dessert had issues too. The panna cotta with berries was so overwhelmingly sweet that I actually sent it back- it tasted like bubble gum. The panna cotta itself was the sweetest I'd ever had, but then the berries were so heavily sugared that they provided none of the acid balance the dish so desperately needed.

But I'll round up because my experience here went really well. The service was really good, the food was good and we came at just the right time to have the best experience there. \\n\\nFirst of all, if you plan to go here, it's best to get a reservation. I believe it might be reservations only during certain hours but to save you hassle, make one. My cousins and I didn't have one but we got really lucky because there was enough bar seating to accommodate 3 people. If it's a last minute dinner plan, you can test your luck at the bar. \\n\\nMy party ordered garlic noodles, Cajun fried rice and garlic fries for starters. Appetizers came out pretty quickly. \\n\\nGarlic noodles rating 4.5: it would be a 5 but for the price, I felt the portion was a little small... BUT it's damn good!! Probably the best garlic noodles I've had thus far. My boyfriend and I looked at each other like \\"damnnn. That sh*t is good!\\" It is pricey for the size but I'd go back just to have these noodles again. \\n\\nCajun fried rice eating 3.5. This one I didn't enjoy as much as the garlic noodles and it could be that I had the garlic noodles first and they were so good that the fried rice just didn't live up to it. It comes in the same size dish as the garlic noodles so it's smaller portioned. But the flavor just wasn't there for me. It definitely has potential to be great. I mean it's fried rice with andouille sausage and crawfish so it definitely can be great. I probably won't order it again as it's seasoned now though. \\n\\nGarlic fries: 5 I love fries.. fries connoisseur if you will. These were great. They're small, thin cut, just the way I like and garlic fries are my favorite. So this was easy for me. Again same size as the others but for fries, it was a good size dish and price. \\n\\nWe then ordered the bootleg special which is a combination of lobster, crab, shrimp, crawfish, clams, mussels, andouille sausage, potatoes and corn. \\n\\nRating: 5. We got it with the bootleg sauce and it came out in this massive dish. It was 70 some odd dollars to share between the 3 of us and it was satisfying!!!!! It was enough for us all, and I was really full at the end. The flavor is really good and they give you a good amount of each food. The crawfish was a little dry after picking it out, but everything else was reallly good! I'm from California, and there's a place called The Boiling Crab there that I swear by.. There's other places similar to Boiling Crab cuisine but the flavor there is like no other. I would say bootleg special came in VERRYYYY CLOSE. The flavor is really just the right amount of Cajun and when the foods are drenched in that sauce, it sooo good. Also, my cousin said \\"the bread in the sauce is a meal itself\\" hahah. He really enjoyed it. \\n\\nANYWAY, long story short: great place to eat if you're into that Cajun, saucy seafood meal.

You're probably wondering why I gave it a 4 stars then. The reason is due to portion size and pricing. \\n\\nAtmosphere and first impression:\\n\\nPlace had a very nice cafe meets modern hipster feel. It's a little confusing whether you should wait for a host to be seated because once you open the door. there's a wall that seems a little too close to be the \\"host\\" stand. Well, it is (just in case your were wondering) it was extremely busy so it must be as amazing as everyone said.\\n\\nservice:\\n\\nFrom start to finish. It was awesome.

My waitress was friendly and even refilled our drinks without asking her. There's a person who's also clearing the table always. Everyone was friendly. However, be aware that the waiter will mention that it's family style. However, the plates are not family style. Maybe a few plates but I ordered a $13 omelette but looked more like a side. You make your decision. Also, if you're a stickler for timing, they do not bring plates at the same time. It is all dependent on the plates itself. \\n\\nFood:\\n\\nOh my goodness! The food was amazing!!! Seasoned to perfection. We ordered some sausage omelette ($13)and some cowboy plate ($18). These plates were amazing taste wise. The omelette was a little too pricey for something that looks like a side. Thankfully we decided to share because this plate was not \\"family style\\". The cowboy plate portioned well but they cook it medium rare and the meat was super chewy. However, the flavors just popped in my mouth.

The place was busy and surprisingly they were playin some of our favorite hip hop songs. The atmosphere is a little hipster but we expected that. And now, here's my 3-Tier Review:\\n\\nQuality: A\\nThe plates are tapas sized and meant to be shared. First we had the half order of French toast with caramelized pear and whip cream. Very delicious and just the right amount of sweet. Next we ordered the polenta with braised pork shoulder. It was braised in a red sauce, very delicious. \\nI ordered the opened faced fried oyster omelet with pork Lardo (very similar to pancetta) served over a biscuit. The oysters were very plump and briny but on the soft fried side. I prefer a crunchier fried oyster but that's just me. Perfectly complimented with Louisiana hot sauce, it has the right amount of creamy, salty, spicy, sweet, and savory.\\nVery high quality ingredients made this a brunch I'd do again!\\n\\nPrice: B\\nGiven the quality of ingredients, the price was expected. The portions however were a little smaller (due to the tapas sized plates) than I'm accustomed to. The average price was about $15-19 per plate which can be pricey, but shared between 2 people, 3 plates were about perfect for getting full but not I-can't-breathe full.\\n\\nService: A+\\nThe server was quick and attentive and she refilled our water jug without hesitation. She answered our questions very quickly and expertly and the brunch went on without a hitch! A great sign of a good server is one that takes care of you without you even knowing. The food came out at just the right time and we enjoyed everything about the place.\\n\\nOverall: A\\nThe quality is excellent, the service is a match, but the portions can use a little bump up to give it more bang for your buck.

Then we had the Roasted Bone Marrow and the Seared Foie Gras. WOW oh wow.  The bone marrow was super flavorful. Came with chunks of octopus which were like flavor bombs. I wish there was more of those little tidbits. It also came with toasted bread. The foie gras was buttery and melted in your mouth. Came with a small piece of zucchini bread with a fruit compote.  I could have just had the foie gras with some of their baguette bread and been perfectly fine but it was seared to perfection. I want more.\\n\\nFor main dishes we had the lamb shank and the hanger steak.  The hanger steak was off the charts good.  It came with a gravy and frites.  The fries were crispy and golden. The gravy was a bit salty but still good.  The steak was cooked perfectly, just how I asked, medium.  The steak was tender you could cut it with a fork.  My brother had the lamb shank and it was also delicious.  Also tender and able to cut with fork. He said it wasn't as good as the hanger steak but still good. Hint of mint on the lamb too, I thought it was good.\\n\\nFor dessert we had the cookies and cr√®me panna cotta. It was very good.

However, the beef is slightly chewier than I'm used to in pho because they cook it to a well-done level instead of a medium rare like other Vietnamese restaurants and as it sits in the hot broth it becomes slightly over cooked in my opinion.

Those are very reasonable questions but I was a little off put because there was no \\"hi how are you?\\" \\"What can I get started for you?\\" No starter of casual conversation just a bunch of, what I perceived as, hostility. I've worked service before so I know the struggle maybe it's a tough shift or you're having a bad day, but I know to leave that at the door when I clock in. Every single person I encountered at this job seemed genuinely miserable, hostile, and in a rush to get me and my company out the door. It's a shame because I immediately saw a bunch of sandman comics on the counter and was hoping to strike up a conversation about it, that did not occur.  It might have translated to more dollars from me and mine for what initially seemed like a respectable establishment. I have never left a $0.00 tip tonight was the first time in my life. I hope it's the last because I generally leave between 18-20 percent. I hate doing that because service workers do deserve a good tip regardless of whether it was \\"above average\\" or even just \\"standard\\" service.

The staff really only cares about their regulars which they would have a lot more repeat business if they treated everyone equally. Highly drama oriented and constantly talk badly about customers without a care of who hears, unprofessional in my opinion. Again, they do have really good food though. Pizza has made me very sick in the past but I only tried it twice (first time with an old coworker who also got sick) so I was not about to try it a third time.

Okay, it's not necessarily chic or stylish unless you are a big fan of the \\"Every Which Way But Loose\\" movie franchise (relax, no orangutans there).  Once you get past the overdone ranch theme, including the bull horns over the entryways, it is actually clean and inviting.  The staff was also fantastic to us not only in quality of service, but truly making us feel welcome.  Those ceiling tiles, however . . . \\n\\nAnyway, I had a ribeye and my wife had the \\"small\\" filet.  We also shared my side of loaded buckskins.  Now, my ribeye could have been cut a bit thicker, but the portion was still very generous and the preparation was first rate.  My wife's filet looked absolutely perfect.  From the first bite, she told me it was the best steak she has had in Florida and certainly one of her best ever.  The loaded buckskins could actually be a meal in and of themselves, very tasty and surprisingly not soggy given how they were prepared.  I could eat them at every meal.  Bottom line, these were excellent meals that were prepared as a cardiologist's nightmare.

The restaurant is very small and cramped but it is also perfectly cozy--especially when it was 3¬∞F outside!\\n\\nOur party of 5 waited about 15 minutes to be seated for an earlier dinner slot without a reservation. Not bad.\\n\\nNeptune Oyster has a midsize menu and I opted for their Monday special: Lobster Spaghettini. Our server was very knowledgeable and made suggestions for the rest of our party. When she casually asked if I wanted to top my spaghettini with black truffles, I said, \\"sure!\\"\\n\\nHoly moly! When the server brought the dish over to our table, it was piled high with a generous amount of black truffles (see photo). I imagined just a dusting of truffles so when I saw my dish all covered in black--I was astonished!\\n\\nThe lobster meat was big and succulent! And the sauce was more of a cioppino-style stew than the spaghetti -- I loved it! It stayed piping hot throughout the meal. And those black truffles were so good. I couldn't even finish the entire dish because it was a pretty big (and heavy) dish. I also had one of the ros√©s, which complemented my dish. Really good! I can't remember the name but it starts with a T.\\n\\nAnyway everyone in our party loved their dishes including the side salad.\\n\\nThe price is somewhat high but expected for seafood.

Frankly we were surprised that it was rather a small collection, smaller than even Toledo's.\\n\\nMore American artist than European, much more new pieces than older.  That's not to say they didn't have a majority of famous painter, Monet, Sargent, Hooper, Cassat, Picasso (2) and Rembrandt, but these were lesser known pieces except the Hooper - Early Morning - which is not as famous as Night Hawks, but its close.\\n\\nI guess the good news is the Museum is expanding.  The Museum is also very kid friendly and interactive.  They want you to think and describe your thoughts on the various artists.  The lower level has a number of interactive activities design for the young at heart, including creating your own version of Frank Stella's work.\\n\\nThere is free parking, and we were able to use our Membership from the DIA to enter at no charge.  We were their on a Friday morning, and besides a couple of school groups, we pretty much had the run of the place by ourselves.  This allowed us to talk to some of the docents about their collection and up coming exhibitions.  We went thru the entire museum in under 90 minutes."},{"name":"Italian Kitchen","address":"860 Burrard St","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Decent place walking distance from my hotel.

Unlike the plethora of pho noodle shops and handful of banh mi joints up and down Buford Highway, Co'm differentiates itself by specializing in authentic Vietnamese rolls/wraps and rice dishes.  The word \\"co'm\\" means rice in Vietnamese (or \\"eat\\" depending on how you use it).  Fellow neighbors Chateau de Saigon, Quan Ba 9, and Nam Phuong 2 offer similar dishes, but Co'm was the first.\\n\\nThe restaurant is located in the same strip mall as banh mi-favorite Lee's Bakery and taco stand El Senor Taco.  Co'm has a more inviting and upscale feel to it when compared to the more \\"adventurous\\" and divey Vietnamese joints along this corridor.  As such, it has a larger following and more non-Asian clientele than is typical for Asian restaurants in this area.  The space inside the restaurant itself is a little small and sometimes, there can be a short wait for a booth or table to open up.\\n\\nI've never been disappointed with a dish here.  My favorite dishes include the bo la lot (beef wrapped in betel leaves), goi salad (green papaya salad), fragrant rice dishes, and rice vermicelli noodles with pork.  \\n\\nThe betel leaves (easily confused with grape leaves) are dark in color and have a firm texture.  This gives the rolls an extra snap to them.  You can order the betel wraps with several different kinds of meat.  I personally prefer the beef.  The wraps are quite juicy and flavorful and come with a light, sweet dipping sauce.\\n\\nPapaya salad is a popular Southeast Asian dish.  The version at Co'm uses freshly sliced green papaya and green mango as its main ingredients.  It's an expectedly sweet and sour, cold dish.  Definitely worth a try if you've never had papaya salad before.\\n\\nThe fragrant rice dishes come with a poached egg on top along with the meat of your choice and various diced, pickled vegetables such as carrots.  The plates are both filling and appetizing.\\n\\nThe rice vermicelli noodle dishes are served in the following manner:  vegetables on bottom, clumps of thin, white noodles in the middle, and betel-leaf-wrapped meats on top sprinkled with bits of fried onion.  I like the pork with my noodles.  It's savory.\\n\\nPrices at Co'm are mostly comparable to its non-pho peers.  Service is generally on point and parking is not a problem."},{"name":"Magnolia Cafe South","address":"1920 S Congress Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Classic Austin spot.

That was incredibly unhygienic- I'm glad she wasn't my waitress. That just needs to be addressed. Employees must wash hands after digging in their nose!!\\n\\nI came in around 2pm on a Friday and sat at the bar. The bartender was very attentive and friendly. I ordered the catfish combo with mac&cheese and cold slaw. The slaw was pretty bland, but the Mac & cheese wasn't too bad! Super creamy.  I also had the brisket and fried catfish.\\n\\nAgain, there wasn't much seasoning on either protein, so I made use of the housemade tarter sauce and their hot & sweet bbq sauces. They made a difference, but I do wish the meats were seasoned a bit more. The brisket did have a great smokiness to it, which was yummy.\\n\\nI also ordered some steamed broccoli to go, and had some beignets. The beignets weren't bad, but I've had fluffier.

I understand it would likely be busy because of its proximity to BC Place, but you would think the establishment would also anticipate the same.\\n\\nGot here around 5:35pm which is nearly an hour and a half prior to the game. Was greeted and seated upstairs within a minute of entering. Sweet. A server got our drink order soon after, which was a pitcher of sangria. A good 7 minutes go by and a different server approached to take the food order. Odd, but okay. Food order was placed by 5:45pm, which should hopefully be enough time for the food to arrive, eat, pay, and at worst, not miss too much of the game. I also reminded him that we ordered sangria previously and he seemed like he was aware of that.\\n\\nThen, the wait began. Being seated upstairs we had a great view of the bar. We could clearly see a pitcher of sangria and two glasses sitting on the side ready to go. But all the servers were grabbing every other drink around the sangria regardless of which drink was there longest. The pitcher just sat there for, no joke, 15 minutes. The same one was finally brought to us around 6:05pm.\\n\\nThe time kept ticking by with no food or server in sight upstairs. A few tables around us and even downstairs all appeared antsy and kept looking around because all they had were their drinks, maybe an empty pizza stand waiting for its pizza, and definitely no food. What do you do when you've been waiting so long for the food. Go on Yelp. I think I will have go vouch on most of the recent reviews found on Yelp. When so many reviews all refer to the same few faults, I should have known better. \\n\\n6:45pm comes around and we make a decision to cancel our food order. It's been at least an hour since our food order was placed and we've had zero updates or apologies. It was near impossible to flag a server because they were nowhere to be found. Even if the food came out at that point, there would be no way for us to eat it (especially if it is hot), pay, and make it to the game without missing too much of it.\\n\\nI can't remember the last time I had to cancel a food order. Usually when I try to, the food will miraculously appear within moments. It was not the case on this night. Luckily we spotted a different staff member cleaning tables upstairs. We told her we want to cancel our food orders as it hasn't come for over an hour and we just want to pay for pitcher and go. It appears she understands where we're coming from but said she will have to grab our server. It seems the table beside us who also has not gotten their food saw what we were doing and does the same as well.\\n\\nOur server returns a few minutes later and gives us the bill. But the bill happens to also include the food we never received. Now our server is also busy with the second table trying to get their bill. At that very moment I see another server going up to him with two plates of food unsure of what to do with it.... it wasn't ours. The bill was eventually fixed and then he had to grab the portable POS machine. This all took 10 minutes or so. \\n\\nWe made it into the stadium at 7pm after all, as we originally intended.

Called to make a reservation, but was told I wouldn't need one for my early, middle of the week visit.\\nI arrived to find a very dark, very old style yet comfortable venue, and I was seated immediately at a nice table.  My server gave me a drink menu and the dinner menu, and turned to leave, so I quickly asked about the Dining Month option.  That seemed to fluster her a bit, but she rattled off the options (no printed sheet for Dining Month).  I made my selections, and ordered a glass of wine.\\nFirst course:  Clyde's version of Oysters Rockefeller, with four nicely prepared oysters that were properly cooked (ie, not overcooked).\\nMain course:  The prime rib itself was good.  The alleged bleu cheese potatoes were just bland, with no hint of bleu cheese at all.  The vegetables were sauteed to the tender-crisp stage, which was nice.  But the jus!  Gack!  I've never tasted jus so bad!  It had a sort of chemical, artificial flavor.  It also turns out that one has to specifically ask for horseradish, which I did; my server never offered it at any stage.\\nDessert:  Pumpkin cobbler:  What a sad way to end the meal.  Very unpleasant whipped cream.  Virtually no caramel sauce.  The \\"cobbler\\" itself had the texture of wet cake.  A cobbler is a pie with a top crust that has been baked to crispy perfect; Clyde's dessert was more like a bad version of bread pudding.\\nThroughout my meal, other diners arrived.  I heard my server addressing each one, and not once did she mention Portland Dining Month.  Maybe I'm out of line, but it seems that if a restaurant signs up to be part of Dining Month, and if they enjoy all of the external promotion from being part of the program, that they should apprise their customers of that option.\\nFinally, when the bill came, I discovered that I had been overcharged by $1 for my wine.  Not a big deal, but that meant that their beverage list was out of date.  I had to wait around for my initial charge to be cancelled, and then re-charged.

No luck there but I noticed a few tables empty in the dining area so I asked if maybe we could get seated since the next party has not shown up yet. Luckily, after a few calls to other people on the list and having empty tables just sitting there, the lady came to get us. See, good things come to all those who wait!\\n\\nTASTY HANGTOWN FRY ($14) was the best thing we ate here.

It has to be the wagyu tallow they used to fry it in or that amazing aioli dressing. This was fab.

Even simple orders (2 breakfast sandwiches) can take 10-15 minutes.\\n\\nThe food isn't terrible.  Some of it is even quite good (the rice bowl with shrimp and cilantro).  However, whether or not Disney foresaw the central design flaw in the ordering system, it doesn't seem to care to mitigate it by increasing staffing at the registers or in the kitchens, even at busy hours. For folks who are trying to pick up a quick breakfast on their way into the theme parks, having to wait 20-25 minutes for food is unacceptable.  \\n\\nFor patrons here at the Contemporary, a \\"Deluxe\\" Disney resort, you deserve better.  Unfortunately, in the absence of any other fast breakfast choices, please take this under advisement and allot the proper amount of time for these delays as you plan your day."},{"name":"Arby's","address":"11193 W Colonial Dr","city":"Ocoee","stars":"4","text":"I will drive 20 min out of the way to come here.

Their eggs are fresh, perfectly cooked, excellent grits, delicious drop biscuits, without any yucky additions (such as sugar: I'm looking at you, Flying Biscuit), real butter, real cream. Their fruit is FRESH, ripe and unadulterated. But the real draw is coffee. They roast their own green beans, which you can buy by the pound for a reasonable price. Instead of \\"sell by\\" date, they have the date they were roasted, which is a far more honest and useful indicator of freshness. Freshness makes all the difference.

And the food was excellent! We got three appetizers (chili oil wontons, ba wan buns, and the cheung fun), and we split the ichiza noodle soup. The texture of the noodles was perfect - chewy and dense - while the broth was spicy and savory. I could eat that noodle soup and the cheung fun appetizers every day for every meal. If the menu said something was spicy, it was actually spicy. Everything was served at the perfect temperature, which is a weird thing to say until you've had the terrible experience of biting into to steamed bun that was roughly the temperature of molten lava, thus destroying the roof of your mouth. At Ichiza Kitchen, the food was warm, but perfectly acceptable to pop into one's mouth the moment it got to the table. \\n\\nI can definitely see how this place could get jam packed - it's quite small - but as the website mentions, there are bars nearby that a person could walk to while waiting for a table.
