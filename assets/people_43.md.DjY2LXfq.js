We stood at door waiting for approximately 10 minutes as many staff members came in and out of hostess stand with no gestures of hi or welcome, nothing.  The hostess finally showed up to sit the couple who had drinks in front of us who were moving from bar to a table.  She looked at us but no smile no hi I'll be with you next, she just rushed along.  When she returns she made no eye contact with us and went straight to her hostess computer.  She finally looks up and says can I help you? Well Yes please table for two.   Took us through very crowded area and Sat us at a small two top in a very dark area when there were several tables open.  She didn't say thank you Or enjoy your meal, nothing but rushing back to the front.  I realize it was later at night, but a greeting and first impression says a lot about the services you'll receive.  Thought maybe we would get better service since it's in area where others were.  We say there for another 5 minutes.  We asked server was was popular and did they have specials? He said no specials just their regular menu.  I explained it was our first visit and would he recommend anything.  He rambled off several things but we couldn't hear as the noise around us got really loud plus he talked too fast as he was in a hurry.  Once we ordered we got our awesome Chicken Tacos Carbon we shared super fast.  The chicken was tender, the soft tortillas were just perfect and their salsas, rice and beans were all perfect!!!!  Then he came and retrieved out plates and I asked if we could see a dessert menu but he says oh I'm sorry the kitchen has already closed.  I said okay we will try something next time.  We waited for ten minutes for the bill and I finally had to stand up and ask him for the check.   Considering he cleared our plates and kitchen was closed I would have thought he would have dropped the check sooner.   I will say there were others who delivered the food, a drink and the staff who politely said good night and thanks for coming were on their A game.

In the six months my family has been visiting (and subsequently moved to) Vancouver, we've dined out well over 100 times at a wide, wide range of restaurants - some fancy, some hole-in-the-wall joints, offering all sorts of cuisines, from dirt cheap to obscenely pricey. Hand's down, our worst meal ever in this city was had at your restaurant. \\n\\nWhere oh where to begin?\\n\\nOur evening started out promising enough at your place. Walking up the stairs, we thought the outdoor patio was just adorable, with the canopy of strung lights. Since it was a warm evening, we knew we wanted to dine outside under these lights, and the pleasant young male host said sure, they could get us a table outside. So far, so good! We walked through the restaurant (it was approximately half empty. The interior looked pretty, though, and I made a mental note how nice the ambiance was here) and we were seated at a table outside on the lovely patio.\\n\\nAnd this is where everything went to hell.\\n\\nNobody came to our table. It was quite warm out and we were thirsty. At the very least, we were needing water. After 15 minutes passed, our youngest daughter went back inside the restaurant to flag down a server, to inform them that we were still waiting on water and menus at our table outside. Five minutes later, a server came by with these items, apologizing how \\"busy\\" the restaurant was (??? We didn't get this, as the patio and interior restaurant had a lot of vacant tables). \\n\\nSoon after, the server returned. By this time, I had read the Yelp reviews, most mentioning how slow this restaurant's service is. Also, by this time, my eldest daughter was getting really hungry. Shaky hungry. (We had been sitting outside now 20 minutes or more). Anyone else's kids get super hungry, super fast, so much they shake and/or get headaches? Anyhow, I asked our server at this time, prior to ordering anything, to please be honest with me: is it going to take 30-40 minutes for us to get our meals? I told her that our daughter was starving and had to eat soon and I beseeched her to be honest, if our food was going to be slow coming out, we'd need to go elsewhere. She gave me her word, \\"no way\\" would it take 30 minutes for us to get our meals, she'll put in a word that we need our meals ASAP and if we ordered an appetizer, she'll make sure we get it \\"right away\\". My family deliberated briefly and decided to stay, and we ordered our drinks and said we'd be ready to order our meals in a few minutes after we went over the menu.\\n\\nShe returned soon to take our orders. Hubby ordered a plain burger with fries. I ordered an avocado seafood salad to share with my kid (the server said they couldn't split it for us but they'd bring us an extra dinner plate, and she said no problem, we could get honey mustard salad dressing on the side), and my other kid said she really wanted the sushi cones (she even ordered an extra one. She doesn't eat meats). We ordered too the \\"mosaic dip\\" as an app and again the server said she'd make sure it came out soon. \\n\\nFive minutes or more later, she returned to say that the sushi cones were no longer available. My kid was really disappointed but she got the menu again and chose an alternate meal (lettuce wraps). Not sure why the server didn't know about this when our order was placed.\\n\\nAnother ten minutes passed before we even got our drinks. Now we've been sitting here outside 35-40 minutes. And we just got our drinks.\\n\\nMy eldest daughter is getting jittery. Our appetizer hasn't come out yet. About ten minutes later (might've been more), all our meals start coming out. My avocado-seafood salad didn't come with our ordered dressing on the side; instead, there was a ramekin of red salsa (wth?), and no dinner plate to split the salad, too. The server came to ask if all was okay. I told her we didn't get our appetizer and she looked like a deer in the headlights, saying that she was told it was brought out to our table but we informed the person to send it back, we didn't order it (!). I again told the server that the appetizer wasn't brought to our table. Again she said that she was told we returned it. WTH? At this point, even my young daughter grasps what occurred and tells her \\"they must have brought the dip to the wrong table\\". The server is apologetic. I told her that we still need our dinner plate to split our salad and the honey-mustard dressing. She apologizes, saying she has no idea why we got salsa, says she'll return with the plate and dressing and leaves.\\n\\n*There is more to this review but I'm running out of space. Will continue in an \\"update\\" in a day or so.

I come to Seito  Baldwin Park at least once or twice a month, never had a bad experience, and I have introduced many friends over the years to this restaurant. Tonight, I had the most disappointing service ever.\\n\\nTo begin, I recently tried a dish my dad ordered for the first time, the seared tuna salad. It was amazing -- so amazing that I literally couldn't stop thinking about it and had to come back the next day to get it for myself. I do not eat raw fish, and even though seared tuna is partially cooked -- I prefer it to be on the well cooked side. I came back to Seito the next day to order the salad, asked for the tuna to be well cooked, they made sure I understood that the tuna would be on the tough side -- I understood and placed my order. The salad was perfect. The tuna was cooked just to my liking. I was incredibly happy.\\n\\nFlash forward two weeks. My family is in town and I suggested Seito -- mainly for the incredible salad --¬†but also, it's been our go-to dinner spot for a long time. We sit down, order appetizers and drinks, and I order my salad with the seared tuna cooked well. A few minutes later the server returns to inform us that the chef will not be able to cook the tuna well. I explain that I just had the same dish two weeks ago. The server returns to the kitchen and then back to the table to again inform us that the chef refuses to cook the tuna well done. We ask to speak to a manager, explained the story again, and he returned to the kitchen to speak to the chef. A few minutes later, he comes back and explains to us that cooking the fish is not something the chef will do because it is not how the dish was intended. He also said that the salad \\"slipped through the cracks\\" when I ordered it two weeks ago. \\n\\nI am incredibly disappointed. I was not asking for an unreasonable substitution.

Savory butter and spices mixed into a delicate dish prepared and served in a metal bowl that keeps it warm. The only issue is that it's extremely small serving for the price! Like literally a handful of chicken and I'm not talking about a giant's hand, like a normal size handful of chicken\\n\\nThe combination fried rice was okay. It needs just a bit more sauce. All the meat tastes normal and the shrimp doesn't have a fishy taste!\\n\\nThe fried banana was really good but just as you expect from the popular dessert. Ice cream and hot fried banana! Always should try this!\\n\\nAll in all even if the butter chicken servings was small, this is a awesome place and their customer service and willingness to take in people after they closed is a really good plus!"},{"name":"Hot Chicken Takeover","address":"59 Spruce St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4.5","text":"I had hot drums meal and it was great.

The selection's not as gonzo as some of the other beer bars around town, and there's less of an emphasis of the trendy Belgians and overly hopped IPAs.

(NOT, May 13th when review was posted. And NOT Mothers Day, May 10th)  Now, I really hate having to write bad reviews about places. But...this one is necessary.  The only reason I am giving it one star is because of the nice outdoor seating they have here. It is always nice to sit outside for a meal, especially by the seaport in Boston. SO, first impression walking up to the place.. I see the waitresses. They are wearing Yoga/PJ/workout pants..........That immediately made me rethink the place, seems unprofessional. But, we were searching for brunch and on Sunday here, they are mostly brunch. We were hungry. We were seated after a table was cleaned off for us, outside. Now, our waitress comes over, as nice as she  was, she was wearing, yes, yoga pants.. but worse, a red ripped up tank top/belly shirt and multiple tattoos all over the place. Its not the tattoos that bother me so much, as the how unprofessional the outfit was. But, the tattoos didn't help the professionalism either. It took about 10 - 15 minutes for her to come over.. We were hungry as I mentioned, so we ordered everything at once. Which includes me ordering a coffee. Well, i did not get that coffee. My boyfriend asks our waitress about the coffee situation, she had forgot. She comes back within a couple min with it. Very small cups, it was gone, and I needed more coffee while waiting for our food. Another waitress/hostess see's that I am looking around and asks \\"oh would you like more coffee\\" and i say Yes please, thank you.. WELL...This waitress/hostess never comes back with the coffee!  About 45 to an hour had gone by since we ordered.. we did get an app and about this time it came out to us, thank god. So, we ate that. Continued to wait another hour for our actual meals to arrive, just sitting there wondering if we had been forgotten about because it was taking so long. We both ordered Huevos Rancheros, after having been here for two hours, ONE plate of food comes. I let my boyfriend have it, he was starving. He tried to wait for my meal, but it was just taking too long and his food was getting cold. So he eats, without me. After waiting more, we finally speak up and say, we ordered another plate of food and have not received it yet. This is when they tell us the kitchen was NOT \\"prepared\\" and is majorly backed up. I'm confused by this, it's a sunny Sunday morning at a restaurant in a very nice area of Boston, which im sure is usually busy. Especially catering to a sunday brunch crowd every weekend. How are they not prepared?  The tables outside were mostly full, but it was by no means crazy busy! Anyway, they go check on my food, come back with it finally and do take it off the tab. Thankfully.. Now, in regards to the food.. The appetizer we got were Buffalo Chicken Dumplings, these were tasty. The Huevos Rancheros was not your norm. It was a few tortillas warmed, some scrambled eggs in the middle, some plain rice, and some plain salsa. Nothing was flavorful at all unfortunately.  \\n\\nSO, this is my review of The Living Room. I could never force myself to try it again. Not with so many wonderful restaurants in Boston to choose from with top notch service!  Good Luck if you go here, make sure you have time!!!\\n\\nP.S.

My wings were tiny, it reminded me of when I made the mistake of getting bone in wings from Pizza Hut when I was young and dumb (shame on me for getting wings from a pizza place I guess). I expected better from a chicken place. Maybe I've been spoiled but I'm used to wings from Wings over Columbus which are huge, the flavors were spot on though and I might be willing to come again and maybe try a different part of the bird if I were to suddenly have a craving for the hot seasoning. Most disappointing was the mac and cheese. Did the recipe change from before the move to the short north? I could barely eat 1/2 of one serving much less the two I had paid extra for thinking that it was be a no brainer that I would like it based on the pictures and reviews. The texture was gritty,the pasta was overcooked and the flavor was bland. Really mac and cheese is usually like pizza for me, if it's there I'm eating it. you can't really mess it up, except Hot Chicken did, and most of it went into the trash. Looking at the pictures I really don't believe I got the same stuff that everyone has been raving about.  The highlight of the meal was definitely the banana pudding, and that's saying something cause I'm a savory girl all the way, usually I can take it or leave it with sweets. Obviously, I'm in the minority with this review but with all the glowing reviews I felt kinda cheated that my experience wasn't better. maybe my expectations were too high, maybe it was an off day I don't know, but I'm not really in any hurry to return.\\n\\n4/9- Received a response from the owner and upgraded review by a star for customer service.

First off, I'm not a fan of the name of the restaurant, as it's not immediately evident what type of place it is.  Of course, going to yelp, you can quickly see that it's an Asian Fusion of Japanese, Korean & Thai!  But the name without context evokes more of a BBQ joint, southern cooking, or something (to me at least!).  \\n\\nThis place is tiny, and rather unassuming.  They seemed much more accustomed to take-out than sit-down, but took very good care of us regardless.  Read reviews here before trying them, we started with the Curry Puffs, were were essentially potato/veggie empanadas; they were quite tasty and a nice starter.  We split an order of bulgogi & pad thai; both of these were delicious, with perfect portion sizes.  Our waitress was very friendly, as she tended to take-out orders as well.  Great value!

As I was passing through Poco recently I decided to pick up a House Special pizza after having not eaten here in nearly a year.  Got my pizza and dove in. \\n\\nSo how did this most recent pizza stack up compared to other San Remo pizzas over the years?\\n\\nThe good: \\n\\n- Toppings. Lots and lots of toppings. They definitely pile on the toppings here and their pizza's are HEAVY weight. Lots of cheese, too. So if you are in the mood to be \\"filled up\\", San Remo doesn't disappoint.  This has always been part of their signature pizza style. \\n\\n- Ingredients. They tend to use higher quality ingredients than most places. The crust has a lighter feel to it than others, despite being a thicker style crust, which is nice. \\n\\n\\nThe ok:\\n\\n- Taste. This can fluctuate... for whatever reason, I wasn't that impressed with the taste of the pizza I got this time. Maybe it was the tangy sauce just not having enough kick, but for me there just wasn't enough bite and it kind of just tasted a bit bland overall.\\n\\n\\nThe bad:\\n\\n- Price. You are paying a premium for this pizza... while not as expensive as Flying Wedge (from what I recall), it is bit pricier than other pizza places. Considering the amount of toppings provided, I suppose they consider this justified... however for me, I think that's the last time I spend $25 on a single medium  pizza.\\n\\n\\nAnyway, if you are in the mood for a pizza that piles on the toppings and cheese at a bit higher price than normal, San Remo is a good choice. Taste is subjective so you should at least try it for yourself. The pizza's are decent, thick style crust with good quality ingredients and lots of them.\\n\\nThe only thing I will say that is negative (and has been noted by other reviewers) is more to do with the style of management at the restaurant... I have noticed the past few times I've been here, the burly moustached man (who I assume is the owner) tends to yell at staff often and generally seems angry and overly stressed out. \\n\\nIn that regard, I don't like supporting a business that runs operations that way, so I probably won't be back to San Remo considering the above concerns during my most recent experience."},{"name":"Lee's Bakery","address":"4005 Buford Hwy NE, Ste C","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I stopped here after having dinner at Com.

I've tried a few ramen places in Columbus and this one is my current favorite. As a vegetarian, I loved the potato broth used in the Spicy Sesame Ramen. It was so flavorful, creamy, and really hit the spot on a cold day. The vegetarian broths used in other ramen places sometimes have a thinner flavor or are overly salty, but this was perfect. Most of the toppings were great and well-balanced. I wish there had been more tofu, but I still enjoyed every bite (or slurp, rather). The noodles - which we were told were homemade just for Menya - were delicious! I loved their texture and taste. They were different from what I've had at other ramen shops, and I like that they adjust the type of noodles for each type of ramen. The service was really quick and friendly. I'll be making the trip back to Menya ASAP!"},{"name":"Amnesia Brewing","address":"832 N Beech St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I would write a review, but Ethan D. pretty much hits the nail on the head.

I blame my wife because she really wanted to go here for pizza. The first thing I have to mention is that the service was really bad. Our waiter was totally clueless about beer selection and had no idea what was on tap. He seemed genuinely shocked that anyone would want to order a beer with their pizza and repeatedly stated that he didn't know much about what goes on \\"over there\\" while motioning to the bar. Hello, it's your job. There are like 10 taps here. Memorize them or write them down. \\n\\nSince that was at the beginning of the dining experience it left a sour taste in my mouth the rest of the night. I did eventually get my beer, and the wife got her wine (after at first getting the wrong one and having to send it back) and we ordered our food. The food came out quickly enough for deep dish pizza and tasted pretty good. Still the ever-present waiter managed to not ask us for drink refills or really check on us much at all. It wasn't a busy night either.\\n\\nWe got the check, the prices were actually reasonable considering we had 2 drinks and also took home leftovers.

We hadn't found the time for a fancy dinner, but when his birthday rolled around and I offered the options of his favorite restaurant or Ray's, I expected him to choose his favorite restaurant. He chose Ray's!\\n\\nAccording to the website, Ray's has a strict business casual dress code. Judging from some of the outfits we saw on our visit, I would say to step it up a little. There are people on both ends of the spectrum, some in nice jeans, some decked out, but we feel most comfortable somewhere in the middle. This is definitely not a jeans and sneakers sort of institution, which is just fine by me. \\n\\nI made my reservation online and requested a quiet table, noting that it was my boyfriend's birthday. We were seated at the big open window, overlooking the river. Sadly, the day was a bit dreary, but we still enjoyed the view, even once it was dark, and loved seeing a fellow kayaker pass by. We found our table to be perfect, quiet enough that we could actually hold a conversation, and semi-private, compared to some of the other tables. They sprinkled some \\"Happy birthday\\" confetti on the table and promised there would be no singing. It was a great way for them to acknowledge the special event, but in an unobtrusive way that would not leave us red-faced.\\n\\nAs far as the food, surprisingly, my boyfriend was the one to note that there aren't a whole lot of vegetarian options on the menu. I have recently started eating fish on occasion, after ten years as a strict vegetarian, so you'd think I would have noticed. I suppose my view is that this is just the reality in most higher-end restaurants. That said, I have no doubt that Ray's would've put something together at my request should we have needed to do so. \\n\\nWe had oysters to start, half east coast, half west coast. The horseradish it came with was stupendous, as was the champagne mingonette. We both preferred the salty east coast oysters. I also had a cup of the New England clam chowder. I have a hard time passing it up anytime it's on the menu and especially when fresh! It was good, but it didn't blow me away.  \\n\\nFor dinner, I hemmed and hawed, but ended up getting the Canadian Salmon Oscar. It came topped with crab meat, asparagus, and bearnaise sauce, and was over goat cheese and chive whipped potatoes. I think you should re-read that, because I'm drooling just thinking about it. Utterly fantastic, my salmon was perfectly cooked to my preference, the bearnaise was decadent, as were the mashed potatoes. I could not have asked for a better meal. \\n\\nHe had the Parmesan Crusted Scallops. I think there were 4 scallops on the plate, but over the lobster risotto, which was excellent. He said it looked small, but was wonderful and very filling. Sometimes our eyes are bigger than our bellies. \\n\\nWhen our dinner plates were cleared, the waiter brought a special plate of dessert, something that isn't even on the menu, with a single lit candle. Nice touch, Ray's! It was classy and the perfect surprise. We were both very full, but we thoroughly enjoyed the slice of chocolate cake with whipped cream and raspberry  reduction.\\n\\nI was very impressed with Ray's on the River.

I love how they add a nice touch of the swirl on top (refer to my pictures). On top of their dim sum, I really enjoy dinner here too. The food comes out at the perfect timing, the entrees are so flavorful, and the staff here is so nice. Yesterday I had crab (I forgot which kind it was) and there were huge chunks of sweet crab meat.

And really, that's what you should only be feasting on.\\n\\nI'm going to dive right into discussing the biggest draw to this restaurant: the lobster buffet. It's a well-stocked buffet offering a variety of seafood and non-seafood items to eat. There's a section that contains stuff like salad fixings, oysters and clams on the half shell, crab claws, peel & eat shrimp, and even sushi. As you move down, you'll come across an area dedicated to prepared entree items like a variety of soups, blue crab, salmon with dill sauce, chicken marsala, shrimp creole, fried clams, fried shrimp, fried fish, and fried scallops. Eventually you'll come up to the snow crab legs and a \\"make your own\\" seafood pasta area. And of course, your journey ends at the star of this show -- the lobster. And you're provided all the drawn butter that your arteries can handle. But if you still want more, ask the waiter and they'll bring you lobster bisque or filet mignon that's cooked to order.\\n\\nThe catch is that you're given one lobster by a cook each trip you make up to the buffet line; one lobster per trip. There's no asking for 5 to stack up on a plate as you sprint back to your table. It's no big deal though, because you can gorge on as many lobsters as your gut can handle. No shame in eating your heart to death with lobster. Everyone working there knows that it's everyone's mission to eat as many lobster as they can, so dig in! My father, a lobster fanatic, took down 5 of those bad boys. I managed 3, due to myself filling up on quite a bit of the \\"distractions.\\" I wish that I stuck with the lobster, but wanted to try everything so I could make an honest review of the food as a whole. What I've decided for myself is that the food in all is, well -- pretty mediocre.\\n\\nPreparation, presentation, and taste just doesn't make this food stand out from standard fare. Clearly, the lobster is the best of this extensive menu, but the price of this food is kind of hard to seem justifiable. I can even say that I've had better crab legs at Chinese buffets, man! At $37 a pop, I would have liked to have seen a bit better quality in the food. But hey, as long as you eat enough lobster, you can feel better about what you've shelled out, right? Worked on me, that's for sure.\\n\\nWith the mediocre \\"distraction food\\" alone, it would be very difficult to recommend this place, due to the large bill you'll rack up. But the lobster is the saving grace. If you really love lobster, then of course you should eat here. I recommend that you tackle the lobster first. Eat as many as you can. As you start feeling full, if you happen to see anything that remotely looks interesting, go for it. Otherwise, it's only trying to fool you!

And, I am very picky. So, my review is based on my experience growing up with them. Anyway, let's start with the bread- Po boys are supposed to be made on French bread. The sandwich I got was not on French bread. Let me add, though, that the bread was actually quite tasty and had it not been called a po boy, I would have been quite delighted by this bread, soft and chewy and yummy. \\n\\nSo, my husband and I split a  fried oyster sandwich and the catfish one. The oysters were terrible- mushy, no flavor and the breading was falling apart. Most of the fried oysters I've had in NOLA are breaded with cajun seasoning, which gives them that little kick. But these? I'm not even sure they were salted. As for the catfish, well, I normally quite dislike catfish, but this was was cooked quite well- wasn't mushy. But, again, it lacked any flavor and didn't seem to be salted. If it had just had a little salt, it would have actually been quite a good sandwich (note, I did not say po boy).\\n\\nMy last issue is about the speed of service. It's slow, like really slow. Which would be ok IF the sandwiches were phenomenal and if they all came out at the same time. I get that they make the sandwiches to order, which takes a little bit of time, but it's annoying to get one sandwich at a time. We went with 3 other people and we all got our sandwiches at different times. I've been to small po boy shops in NOLA and they can also be slow but at least all sandwiches are ready at the same time so everyone can eat together without 3 people drooling as you eat yours (as a side note, if you're ever in NOLA, go to Johnny's in the French Quarter- the wait is worth it.)\\n\\nOn the good side, the remoulade sauce was really tasty, I just wish I had gotten a little more than a tiny smear of it. For a sandwich, it was ok. In fact, if I had just gotten the catfish, I would probably say that it was good since I quite liked the bread and the catfish was cooked well. For a po boy, though, it was a fail which is really, really disappointing.

There's very limited parking from what I could tell - there might be some additional in the back alleys. Union Square is made up of several shops that lie on either side of a median with some additional shops that divide off in a large \\"V\\" shape as roads converge to form the apex.\\n\\nThis was our first day in Boston for business and we walked from the nearby Holiday Inn to Union Square - it was a bit less than a mile walk and what appeared to be safe streets - it was a bit trafficy so if you're not comfortable with cars zooming feet away an Uber call might be useful. There's also a hotel shuttle but it less than dependable (as I'll explain later). We walked up-and-down Union Square and got the lay-of-the-land, passing some interesting shops (including both an independent record store and a comic book shop) and finally settled on India Palace. It's been something of a tradition for Sid (who's Indian) and I to try to the local Indian Cuisine wherever we end up, so this became our selection for Boston.\\n\\nThe exterior of India Palace is a bit nondescript with a glass front facade in the middle of a row of buildings. The interior is a bit plain, but welcoming and very functional. There's a counter at the back for what I presume take out orders. We entered and found a couple of occupied tables and very kind owners who asked for our drink order - I selected a Flying Horse Royal and Sid ordered the Taj Mahal - these were the large liter bottles so popular as exports from India and United Brewing - just don't try to find these while visiting India as they seem to be export only. We were given some Masala, a bit of onion chutneys and a basket of very crisp peppery papadums.\\n\\nWe looked over the menu and asked questions and settled on a pair of veggie samosas, two dishes and a couple of Naans:\\n\\nVeggie Samosas - we both thought these were mediocre and could have used a bit more spice (not heat, but rather intensity).\\n\\nChicken Vindaloo - this is one of my favorite dishes and I was not disappointed in what was provided at India Palace although it was different from what I've found previously. This dish is usually quite hot (and I indicated I wanted it \\"India Hot\\") and this was hot, but not as hot as I've had. The curry was also a bit \\"chunky\\" and not quite a fluid as I've had in the past - that being said, it was still quite good with the piquant acidic flavor and heat I love.\\n\\nTikka Masala Paneer - this was Sid's choice, a rich, creamy tomato curry with firm cheese paneer and it ended up being both our favorites. This was really exceptional, one of the best examples of this dish I've ever had with extremely rich flavors and a delectable tomato base that was more like tomato bisque - fantastic!\\n\\nWe ordered a Garlic Naan - good but I think it could have used a bit more garlic (it was more stuffed than brushed-on) and something not on the menu, a \\"Bullet\\" Naan (one baked with green chilies) - the latter was very good but the chilies were a bit disappointing - they're usually much hotter). \\n\\nBasmati Rice - well cooked and not over-done as you sometimes find.\\n\\nIn all we were very satisfied with the food and service.

My husband ordered the antipasto salad and received a regular house salad with piles of cold cuts and some cheese on it. The dressing was good, the cold cuts not so good. Bread is extra, but there was no bread available with our meals so we ordered some, but it never arrived.

When I asked in Mike's if I could park in one of those open loading areas they assured me that it was a terrible idea and that I would get a $55 ticket, so my husband had to stay out in the car and missed going in to pick out the cannoli.

I eventually got my order that I got to go and took it home.  Well those of you that have had a Ruben before know they are supposed to be hot and delicious!  This was hands down the worst ruben, let me just say the worst sandwich I've ever had!  It had a slice of pumpernickel on the bottom a slice of rye on top at first if was like ok cute haha big deal. well I took a bite of it and it had spicy mustard on it?!? Ok spicy mustard and thousand island dressing do not go together and deffinently doesn't belong on a Ruben.  Even worse the bread was rock hard, and everything was ice cold!  Even worse I got some sort of cucumber salad that had tomatoes, and some strange cheese like things in it that tasted like rubber not good at all.  I went on the website and it says all this stuff about being German and gourmet, not at all I wouldn't waste my time or money here ever again.  Take my advise, don't go here it isn't good there is a reason there is never anyone here."},{"name":"Superica","address":"99 Krog St","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"We had dinner here last night.  It was incredibly crowded on a Wednesday night and we had a 45 minute wait for an indoor table.  Luckily there are plenty of places to hang out and have drinks around Krog Street Market while you wait for your table.  The food was worth the wait.  We ordered a good variety of items, and loved most of it.  Favorites included the Pozole Verde, Chicken Tortilla Soup, Chicken Fajitas (surprisingly great and a large portion), Barbacoa Tacos, Carnitas, Shrimp Tacos, and Tacos al Carbon (in that order).  I didn't love the Tamales (way too much masa to meat ratio) and I also didn't care for their mole sauce, but mole tastes a bit different everywhere and my favorite is kind I make at home which is similar in flavor to Nuevo Laredo's.  I personally loved the atmosphere and we had great service.  Unfortunately the margaritas were just so-so in flavor, and the pitchers were incredibly small and overpriced.  I'd still come back often if I didn't know the place will probably remain very crowded for a long time.

My companion, who is Italian, was not a fan of it either.  We ordered two;  one regular creme filled, the other filled with ricotta. The filling just didn't seem thick enough - kinda light without much flavor.  So for all of the Cannoli hype, we left disappointed.  \\n\\nWe did leave with two chocolate dipped biscotti that we had the next day in the hotel dipped in coffee, and that was probably some of the best biscotti we have ever had.  5 stars for that, FOR SHURE.  \\n\\nWe also had (gluttony was our middle name that day) two creme filled puffs dipped in chocolate.  FANTASTIC.  If they used that creme for the  Cannoli's, I would have been a much bigger fan.  So creamy with lots of flavor.  I would get more in a heart beat!\\n\\n$ - Seriously;  we ordered 2 cannoli's, 2 chocolate dipped cream puffs and two biscotti - all under $13.00!

It had arugula and a truffle egg- which added some great texture and flavor. However, the fried chickpeas that accompanied it were crispy, but tasteless. I preferred pairing it with the zucchini.

Then I had mixed vegetables (slices of zucchini and summer squash) with the customary bread and some dip. Additionally, I had a cup (really a bowl) of Supa de Azteca with chicken. All for $11.00. Odd, but very good and very interesting. You could make sandwiches or just eat it out of the bowls. If there were others, you could all share what you had and create your own meal. And the craziest thing was that the meat is sold by the pound ($17 for the pork shoulder), but I settled for 1/4 pound, maybe $4.50.

I can't even order a simple Americano now without getting a ton of bullshit attitude from the barista, and a crappy cup of coffee to boot. The last time I was there I ordered an Americano with 2 inches of room, not because I want that much cream, but because I don't want the espresso diluted too much. It came filled to the brim. When I clarified what I wanted, the barista just dumped out two inches and handed it back. Now I've got half-full cup of weak coffee. When I told him why I wanted it that way, I got ton of huffing and angry looks. It not my fault the cashier didn't mark the cup, and it's not the end of the world to pull some more shots of espresso. He made sure to pull the crappiest shot with no crema and only put in half the espresso while shooting me angry glares. Save your money and time and just go to one of the other two coffee shops with 1 to 2 blocks of this place. This isn't the first time I've been disappointed here; it's just going to be my last time. If you can't even do the basics, who cares what fancy sandwiches you have. \\n\\nMy original review from years ago: This is my local neighborhood coffee shop, and I love it.  The coffee, pastries, and sandwiches are all solid, and I've never been disappointed with anything I've purchased here.  The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because the drinks and food are only reliably satisfying and delicious, instead of being mind-blowing.  Living in Portland (AKA tasty beverage nirvana), a coffee shop has got to be pretty amazing to earn 5 stars.\\n\\nWhat really sells this place for me is the atmosphere and friendly neighborhood vibe.  Being the parent of a three-year old, I really appreciate places that are kid-friendly and this place is has a nice, laid back feel to it.  Towards the back there is a kids' room that packs an awful lot into a relatively small space.  The walls of the play area are covered with chalkboard material so kids can draw whatever they like.  There's a small train table, and a play kitchen area, along with a small chest filled with costumes and masks for dress-up.  Best of all, there's a full-sized window built into the wall, so the kids can have fun and still be watched without grown-ups packing into the room and taking up all the space.  My kid can play, and I can still supervise him even when I'm reading a book on the couch.  Additionally, they also routinely have musicians come in and perform kid-friendly sets.\\n\\nThere's plenty to love, even if you don't have kids.  The play area in the back does a nice job of sound-proofing and isolating the noise, so the front area is perfect for reading, studying, or using their free wifi.  The art displays are definitely better than your average coffee shop, too."},{"name":"Pip's Original Doughnuts & Chai","address":"4759 NE Fremont St, Ste C","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Had a coworker bring in your doughnuts a couple shifts ago.

This evening my son and I sat at the sushi bar. Our previous two visits we had table service. Each seating option has its own benefits. Privacy at your table, entertainment at the sushi bar. During dinner hour we have noticed that the ambient volume is fairly high, so conversation was easier when seated side-by-side at the bar. Atmosphere is upbeat and fun (more notably so at the bar and the sushi bar). Drink menu includes some creative and delicious options. I had the Love Gin (if I am recalling the name correctly) which was light and lovely, very refreshing and not too sweet, a beautiful blend of cucumber, lime and rosemary which all marry well with gin. We have found that it is well worth it to ask about the sushi specials which every time have been delicious and very creative (absolutely worth it, although a bit pricy). Their spicy seafood miso soup is delicious and again, a creative twist on the traditional. My son's favorite roll is the Scallop Crunch, I am still up in the air as to a solid favorite although I have particularly enjoyed the Rainbow Special Jalape√±o and the Spicy Tuna Tempura with Volcano. We both love their salmon ceviche, which is light, creative, and a lovely balance of flavors. It is also visually beautiful when plated. Their sashimi is very fresh tasting and delicious, although the price per piece is a bit higher than at other area sushi establishments. The servers are always pleasant, polite and accommodating and it is a relief not to be rushed through your meal. One of our guest at our last visit ordered a scallop dish and loved what she got, and another guest had the Thai Udon noodle soup which he also enjoyed. Apart from those items we have not ventured into the cooked menu much. All in all, this is now one of our favorite dinner spots and in my opinion, one of the better dining options in Concord.

We ended up getting a pistachio cannoli to split between the bf and I (we just came from dinner and didn't think we could fit a whole one each), and my brother a florentine cannoli, plus a chocolate chip one to take to a friend. While I don't know how my brother felt about his besides that it was a sugar overload, I liked the cannoli very much. I especially loved the dense ricotta filling and pistachio nuts at the ends, and the crispy shell. My bf didn't care for it as much, feeling that cannolis in general were too rich. I will admit it would have been good with a cup of tea or coffee, but I love my sweets so I loved the richness. \\n\\nIf you are looking for cannolis with variety, Mike's is the place to go!"},{"name":"Kick Butt Coffee","address":"5775 Airport Blvd, Ste 725","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"KBC=Keep Austin weird.

And when my steak arrived I was NOT disappointed.  This may have been the best steak I ever had in my ENTIRE LIFE!  It was seasoned perfectly, it was tender, it was juicy.  It was also huge and I wish so much that I could have finished every last bite!  Also the cholula butter?  Kind of amazing.  I can't wait to make it at home because once you try it it's like... duh.  Of course cholula butter should a thing!  We also split a few sides, which were huge \\"family size\\" portions.  The only one I tried was the baked mac and 3 cheeses.  Believe it or not this was my least favorite dish of the night.  I am going to say something that I previously thought should never be said.... it was a little bit too cheesy.  I don't even think I can explain what that means, but maybe when you try it you'll understand.  It was flavor overload.  I don't think my palate could handle it.\\n\\nAnd finally, dessert.  They are known for having coconut cream pie that is delicious, and I tried a bite and thought it was good.  I don't usually like coconut cream pie at all and I thought it was good so for someone who likes it you'll probably be over the moon for this.  And then.... the sour cherry fried pie.  It comes with a Dr. Pepper sauce, vanilla ice cream and brandied cherries.  If you're wondering what Dr. Pepper sauce tastes like, let me tell you - it tastes like amazing, sweet, reduced Dr. Pepper and it's perfection.  We were passing it around like hungry college students, each of us commenting one after the other how awesome this sauce was and how we wish we could have brought some home.  (We checked - they don't sell any.)  Love love love!\\n\\nBeyond that, the space is just cool.  There's good music, it's dark and kind of rustic looking, the customer service is spot on.  What a friggin gem of a restaurant!  Not to be missed."},{"name":"Roosters","address":"897 City Park Ave","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"Roosters's wings are always consistent:  decent quality, well sauced, uniform size.

I'm told that this is one of the hardest reservations to get in Disney World, so I expected it to be really good.  Correction, I expected to have the meal of my life here.  Sadly, I fell victim to the hype.  While my experience here was not bad, it was a  disappointment compared to what I had built up for myself.\\n\\nThings got off to a rocky start.  Three of us had a reservation for a late lunch.  Apparently we were the last lunch seating for the day.  Well, the third member of our party was running a little late and we could not be seated until she arrived.  Now, at any other time I would have understood, but we were the last lunch seating.  It's not like we were holding up turning over a table.  Why not seat two of us and let us order a cocktail or appetizer while we wait?  Eventually we were allowed to sit with the caveat that we would call our friend, read her the menu over the phone, and place her order for her before she arrived.  What's up with that?  This does not sound like the type of thing that should be going on in the most magical place on Earth.  Thankfully, though, after the awkward beginning, the rest of the service was great.\\n\\nThe food.  Let's start with the good.  The cheddar cheese soup really is as wonderful as everyone says it is and was the highlight of the meal.  The steaks that everyone seems to be going on and on about...I don't know.  I was underwhelmed.  I'll admit, it was tender, but it just did not look appetizing.  Not very well seasoned, no grill marks and the outside looked kind of gray in color.  Was my steak just stuck under the broiler for a couple minutes and slapped carelessly on my plate?   Not what I was expecting from what I understood to be one of the premiere steak houses in Disney.    \\n\\nSo, I'll give this place an \\"OK\\" rating.  I'm going to assume that my experience here was not the norm and (if I can get a reservation again) give it another try.

Everything went perfectly! When I arrived I started talking to the hostess Zoe and it became clear to me they'd taken notes when I made the reservation and they were on top of it! First big sigh of relief.  We were seated at a large table perfectly located in the far corner of the restaurant so it was easy to spot our target arriving. Because the party arrived before the guest our server(I wish I remembered her name because she gave us 5 star service) guided me through ordering the correct assortment and amount of appetizers so that we could settle in, enjoy the surprise and order entrees later. She took special note and care of two guests with various allergies making sure they had food that wouldn't require an epi-pen. Of course she also ordered our individual wines and margaritas. Although we had a large party our server kept up with who needed additional drinks throughout the event. We chose Santo because we'd loved everything on previous occasions and everything on this important night was so delicious!

The tableside guac was good too despite the waitress being a little awkward with it. The chicken burger fell apart as the batter surrounding the chicken didn't stick to it at all, and the cheese had condensation or something on it so I'm not sure how long it sat in a warmer before being served to us. The nachos were TERRIBLE and I can't believe they charge almost $20 for it. The mince was dry and barely warm (nowhere near hot) the cheese was melted once but by the time it got to us it had hardened, and overall it was pretty disappointing.

Perhaps it's common that they don't season the eggs for you, I don't go out for breakfast often, but I would expect the home fries to have some sort of salt and pepper. It was all bland. Once I added some salt the home fries were better, but not great. The biscuit wasn't anything special, I thought it was a little undercooked inside. The waitress was there but wasn't the friendliest.

Too much sugar and mushy shells.\\n\\nI'm not sure if the Modern Pastry Shop canollis are made to order, but the shell was crunchy.

As for me I ordered the oxtail, collard greens, and pinto beans, the ox tail also comes rice. My pinto beans could have been cooked a little longer, but other than that everything was on point.

The mix drinks aren't great and are pricey.\\n\\nStarters: great 1/2 price appetizers from 5-7 daily. Most everything is fried and therefore, yummy (calamari & south western rolls are my fav). Their hummus is good although they should provide some veggies to dip (all you get is pita triangles). The chicken taquitos tasted like dog meat and left my boyfriend sick for a couple of days....i wouldn't suggest it!\\n\\nInstead of bread, if you're eating in the dining room, you get jumbo pretzels--very good!\\n\\nMeals: I love the Mediterranean Salad- huge, variety of toppings and hummus. Mac & Cheese is good- you can add your own extras. Lobster Ravioli was decent too. Their french fries (waffle fries) are very good.\\n\\nService: i haven't had a bad experience in the bar/lounge, although I think the bartenders are pretty unfriendly. Plus when you become a regular somewhere, you'd think they'd remember you! The service in the dining room is a different story...it sucked. The waitress forgot our salads and then when we asked (after the meals were brought out) she said \\"Yup, they're coming right up\\"...ummm, news flash: salads come first. Overall, each time I've been in the dining room, the waitress has been less than attentive....\\n\\nAtmosphere: laid back...great place to just hang out if you're not looking for a crazy night out. Good lighting and seating, plus a big screen TV to watch the games. I walk by this place every day and it's usually pretty empty....unless it's Tuesday Trivia night- then it's packed. \\n\\nIt's also usually busier in the summer because they have great outdoor seating.\\n\\nSaturday brunch: i HIGHLY recommend it!

I am sad to say that I was really not impressed. \\n\\nPros- It was really crowded but the line moved fast and I have to give them credit for their table system- You get this card at the cash register and when you sit down at a table you 'check-in' by inserting the card into a little machine on your table. This way, when the server has your food he just looks at a monitor to see what table you sat at and comes right to you! Genius. \\n\\nCons- The price and the food. Both not enjoyable.. Well at least my selection. There were not a lot of menu choices so I ordered the Townsfair salad which had chicken, dates, avocado, almonds goat cheese and a champagne vinaigrette dressing. First of all, it was DRENCHED in dressing- I mean drenched- everything was slimy and covered with it- it was actually a great dressing, but so much of it almost made me sick. The dates and the goat cheese were a perfect choice but again, just so soaked in dressing it was not good. IF I were to ever go back- I would ask for dressing on the side.

Don't get me wrong, the place is fine. It has a good variety of restaurants and shops, so you can definitely spend a good amount of time here, but it's entirely too crowded, and the parking lot is terrifying.\\n\\nI'm never the one driving, thankfully. If I was, you can bet I wouldn't go near the place. Parking here is a nightmare. A long-overdue garage is currently being built, and while I'm hopeful that it will make this place much more pleasant eventually, for right now having even less parking than usual due to the construction makes the situation that much worse. On a recent trip, my friend was driving, and after 45 minutes of circling the parking lot and having several people steal spots from us, her road rage seriously started to frighten me. Happiest place on earth? Not exactly.\\n\\nThe situation vastly improves once you survive the parking lot. We tend to stick to the east side, hitting up Earl of Sandwich or Portobello for food and drinks (the former is my favorite and has better food, the latter has awesome bartenders), and afterward getting our free piece of chocolate from Ghiradelli. There are some interesting shopping choices available, including bigger stores like Tren-D, World of Disney, the Lego Store and Basin (I'm too allergic to all of the different scents to go into Basin though), and smaller kiosk-type places (there's even a little shop just for me and my fellow Lefties). The west side has the Cirque du Soleil show La Nouba, which I saw 13 years ago (yikes, I'm dating myself here, aren't I?), Disney Quest, House of Blues, Bongo's, Splitsville, AMC Theaters (WHY would you put up with this dreadful parking lot to see a movie here? While we're at it, same goes for CityWalk...), and that huge hot air balloon ride.\\n\\nThere's a lot of construction going on here right now, and I'm curious to see how it's all going to look when it's done. But in the meantime, all of the walkways have been squeezed down, so it is even more crowded than usual. It's always a much more pleasant experience to come here around 11 am... there's lots of parking, and no weaving through tourists who just decide to randomly stop in the middle of a walkway. No matter what day it is, it will be packed in the evening. Just go in with reasonable expectations (and don't drive there hungry, because you'll be \\"hangry\\" by the time you manage to park, like my road-ragey friend), and you'll have a good experience :)"},{"name":"Luke's Inside Out","address":"1109 S Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Great spot.

Modern has much fewer options of filling and toppings than Mike's, but again, they are made to order so one's creativity could muster up more variety.\\n\\n4.

I have visited the trailer 3 times as of this review, and have been pretty happy with each visit.   \\n\\nThe Shrimp -- My favorite of the sandwiches I have tried so far.  Made of a hodge podge of ingredients, somehow this Sammy manages to find an agreeable blend of spicy, sweet, and \\"blue cheese-y\\".\\n\\nThe Chicken -- The typical Asian fried chicken offering found around Austin.  The heat in this sammy will catch you off-guard.  It is a little oversauced in my opinion.\\n\\nThe Falafel -- The only disappointing sandwich experience I have had at Luke's.  The falafel and eggplant are really bland; nothing in this sammy jumped out at me.\\n\\nEach sandwich comes with an order of parmesan chips which really aren't anything more than Ruffles with a parm blend sprinkled on top.  A good accompaniment nonetheless.  As far as service goes, the hostess is very friendly and offers up good insights into the menu.  Food is typically delievered within 7-10 minutes of ordering.\\n\\nOne thing worth noting is the fly problem.  I know flies exist outside everywhere, but the flies were particularly unrelenting outside by the trailer and on the patio around dinner time.  If you can, I would advise moving to a table inside after getting your food.\\n\\nOverall, this little food trailer is definitely worth a try.

I wish the review could be five stars, but alas...\\n\\nAstor Court for Mother's Day Afternoon Tea. \\n\\nFood\\nAfternoon tea really is a lot more food than I always think it will be. \\nI would recommend eating a light breakfast and no lunch. This will definitely fill you. \\n\\nScones - these were lovely. With clotted cream and lemon curd on the table, it was a true tea experience. \\n\\n\\nFinger sandwiches - the bread on finger sandwiches often tastes stale. This bread was quite good, soft but substantial enough to hold the filling. In our party, everyone liked something different. Most people will not struggle to find something to their tastes. Each person gets five sandwiches.  They called ahead to find out about food restrictions, so they will meet food needs. \\n\\n\\nSweets - the sweets were mostly good, but lacked the sort of beauty or presentation I expected from the St. Regis. One of the items was a sugar cookie. Doesn't matter how good a sugar cookie is, it is a sugar cookie. At afternoon tea I want a little decadence. I didn't get it. \\n\\nTea- It was only with our last pot that we were given a steeping basket and loose tea. I know this because our waitress drew our attention to it. I'm not sure how the tea was being made prior to this, but it should have been made this way the whole time. This part of our experience was truly inexplicable. \\n\\nService - this part was really lacking. Our tea cups were often empty with no one in sight to refill. They only left the pot on the table for one kind of tea, so we were at the mercy of the staff. Also, our scones came our before our tea. I found this odd. It's not huge by itself, but Afternoon teas at upscale hotels typically have great service. \\n\\nParking - there is valet. The valet is supposed to be complimentary with validation. We got our tickets validated, we got to the valet stand and they said it's two dollars with validation. That's not the tip. That's the price to valet. Two dollars isn't much, but for me the amount isn't the point. Either you validate or you don't. This was just odd particularly for a hotel in the class of the St. Regis. \\n\\nIn Atlanta, we will stick to tea at the Ritz. \\n\\nTea for five with tip and parking fee - $265"},{"name":"Pip's Original Doughnuts & Chai","address":"4759 NE Fremont St, Ste C","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Great concept- order 4, 6, 8 or 12 mini donuts.

Beets were okay.  Served with some greens and sunflower seeds.\\n\\nEbi avocado salad - special mention to the avocado.  Prawns were mostly fresh.  Salad is average.\\n\\nEbi mayo - probably my favourite dish.  Nice battered prawns, with a nice kick to the spicy mayo.\\n\\nSalmon sashimi - very fresh pieces.  Another special mention.  Portion size is quite tiny though.\\n\\nDry ribs - nice and crunchy on the outside.  Again, super tiny portion though.  Served with lemon and a bowl of something.\\n\\nPotato wedges - covered with cheese, and mixed with green onions and Brussels sprouts.  It tastes exactly like what it sounds like.\\n\\nSmoked oysters - wrapped in ham and served on a pile of mayo.  Quite good, except they're the size of your thumb.  Dish comes with a mouthful of salad.\\n\\nSukiyaki - beef and mushrooms in a bowl.  Broth was a bit salty.  Beef was average.\\n\\nSurf & turf - essentially 4 shrimp dumplings (dim sum) with the prawn tails sticking out, and served with dark vinegar.\\n\\nIshiyaki (rice in a stone bowl) - go for the spicy pork one.  Maybe I'm just biased towards spicy mayonnaise.  The chipotle beef one tasted like something I could get in a food court.\\n\\nSure the atmosphere is nice here, but my biggest complaint is the lack of value.  The food is severely overpriced, for what I perceive as mediocre quality.  Even before drinks, it is easy to blow $40 a person here and still leave hungry.\\n\\nLastly, this location does not have any drink specials.  Something to keep in mind.  For this, I recommend the Kitsilano location instead."},{"name":"Lamberts Downtown Barbecue","address":"401 W 2nd St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I'm seriously suspicious of upscale BBQ joints.  Case in point:  Montgomery Inn, a slick ribs \\"institution\\" in Cincinnati, where we now live, pretty much blows and is a giant rip-off.  And I was wary of Lambert's, a restaurant described as \\"fancy\\" BBQ by a local contact to us folks in town for a conference. \\n\\nFood-wise, Lambert's is a damn sight better than Montgomery Inn, and it's also a better value.  But still:  $50 a person (tax and tip included) for a rather medium-sized serving of brisket and pickled veggies, a single cocktail, and shared portions of some veggie sides and desserts, seems a bit high.  Maybe as a native of the non-Texas South, I just don't get a BBQ culture where beef is king.  (Heresy, I reckon, but Texans have heard it before, and us Southerners have heard the flipside from Texans.)  This brisket was tender and tasty, but was it worth $19?  No.  \\n\\nDon't get me wrong.  Lambert's food, including the sides and desserts and especially that High West Old Fashioned, was quite good.  The service was solid, too.  The space is high-ceilinged and woody, and also very loud and somewhat dark and cramped, evidently meant to evoke some updated version of an old Western saloon.  Except one that looks like it cost about $5 million to assemble and decorate and that feels very safe for tourists and upper-income people.\\n\\nI'm close to 100 percent positive that if you're in town with a car--we lacked wheels--your best bet is to get out of downtown to explore Austin BBQ, even it means going to the non-famous places that don't have five-hour lines. \\n\\n3.25 stars."},{"name":"Bun Cha Ca Hoang Yen","address":"5083 Victoria Drive","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"What a refreshing change!

Despite other reviews,  it is NOT romantic.  There are many much nicer restaurants in Atlanta from every aspect.  We went last Saturday for an anniversary and were very disappointed.  The renovation has made it feel like a cold, standard hotel restaurant.  Our view was of a communications antenna,  and it seems that only Table no. 8 has any view of the city.  Our service was ridiculously slow to the point that my husband had to get up and go find a random server to find our waiter.  Even initial cocktails were very slow to arrive....then had to ask for bread when the first course hadn't arrived after 20 mins.

When we walked in the place was practically empty.  This was concerning since it was a Saturday evening, a nice day, and even has outdoor seating.  When we sat down we were greeted promptly by a relatively young waiter that took our drink orders.  We each ordered a martini; however, they were out of two types of alcohol for my drink so I had to change my order. Our orange martinis came out and they were good, if not a little too sweet.  I ended up having two of them and they did the trick.. My wife and I are not food connoisseurs so we weren't particularly brave with the Japanese menu.  We ordered the spicy tuna, spicy salmon, and avocado rolls to start and they had good flavor, were fresh, and had a kick.  We ordered spicy chicken and rice as well as tempura shrimp and udon noodles for our main course.  Our server was friendly, but it was clear he was newer as he couldn't pronounce the name of the chicken course I ordered.  Anyway, the chicken dish was excellent with a good level of spice and plenty of crisp and vibrant vegetables.  The udon dish was so-so, but the shrimp were cooked well.  Props to me for using chop sticks the entire time; they do not bring out a fork unless you ask.  Overall, the service was fine, the drinks were good and the food was fresh and well prepared.

They changed their menu a couple months back, but the food has just gotten worse. \\n\\nFirst of all, to make a reservation you have to put down a credit card, which is ridiculous considering you're sharing communal tables but whatever, we did it. Only to get the worst communal table with uncomfortable stools right in front of the entrance. Then, I ordered a glass of Pinot Grigio which came in the smallest serving of wine I've ever seen. For $12. \\n\\nLast time we came, we ordered the pork bao (pork buns), and it was delicious!!! three buns with perfectly cooked meat. This time we got two pork buns with the fattiest, most undercooked meat. It was chewy and bad. \\n\\nWe ordered the catfish special. To call it \\"special\\" is ridiculous. What we got was grits and a tiny bit of the fishiest cat fish I've ever had. I legitimately thought that what I was served was the side to my cat fish...because I couldn't even see the fish on top of the grits. \\n\\nThe garlic sake clam udon dish was just ok, very garlicky.

What has not been said about the horrible food??  The food at the Oasis is below what you could get at Taco Cabana or Taco Bell (and we're not even fans of Taco Cabana and Taco Bell). I know people give it 5 stars for the view but come on? How could you give a rating of 5 for Nature when that would be there regardless. The food is horrible, the service sucks, and the drinks are watered down. \\n\\nWe went on a Saturday and the wait was very long. First you have to find parking. The parking lot is 3 times the size it used to be but there still was nothing available. After fighting everyone else to find parking, you have to stand outside in a line like you're at a theme park for 20 - 30 minutes. Then you get a pager and are told that your wait would be about 1 hour. Since the wait was long, we went up to the bar. It was packed and it took us about 15 minutes to get a drink. We ordered the house margarita and we later found out that we were served their Perfect Margarita which is $8. For an $8 drink it was horrible, light on the alcohol and watered down. I wish I could give them the excuse that it had been sitting at the bar for a while but we ordered it at the bar. \\n\\nWe were finally seated an hour and a half later so the total wait was 2 hours, waiting 30 minutes in line, and then the hour and a half wait. The place is designed for the view so we did have a table with a great view. The view is never anyone's complaint about the Oasis. \\n\\nWhen we saw the menu we noticed that we were not served the standard house margarita for $6.25 at the bar and asked our server for 2 house margaritas. It took a good 10 minutes to get our drinks and like the first ones these were not great so we didn't think anything of it.  \\n\\nWe ordered the quesadilla and fish tacos. While placing our order we asked for chips and salsa and were snobbishly told that they are not complimentary and that they would charge us $2.95. We said, \\"You can keep your chips and so-called salsa.\\"  What good old-fashioned Mexican restaurant charges for chips and salsa???  I have never been to any Mexican or Tex-Mex restaurant, for that matter, that charges for chips and salsa. We got our food about 20 minutes later and thought it was horrible. \\n\\nThe shredded pork in the quesadilla ($9.95) was the highlight of the whole meal. It was tasty however, the tortilla was soggy, squishy, dripping, and soaked with mango salsa liquid. It was so runny that it ran between your fingers and made the bottom tortilla into dough and tasted like crap.  How can you screw up a quesadilla?! Seriously!\\n\\nThe fish tacos ($14.95) - Where was the fish!?  For the fish that you could find in your taco, it was dry, rubbery, and flavorless. The rice was an overcooked ball of mush with some type of seasoning. The black beans came straight out of the Hill Country Fare cans from HEB. \\n\\nWhen we got the bill we noticed that we were charged $8 each for the margaritas, again. We asked out waitress why we were charged for the Perfect Margarita. She told us that the regular margaritas are watered down, horrible, and they never recommend or serve them to their customers. So basically they take it upon themselves to upgrade your drinks because they know their own drinks suck. \\n\\nThis was not our first time here but it will be our last. We refuse to go back - EVER!  No matter how many new friends or family comes to visit, co-workers from out of state visit, happy hour requests, holidays, 4th of July fireworks, end of Summer parties, someone begging us to go......you get the hint, we're not returning.  \\n\\nSomeone said in a prior review, which I wish I had read before going on a whim, that the only thing you can do is go and enjoy a few drinks. I don't think its even worth it to go there for that because as I stated above, the margaritas tasted like flavored water. The only way it might be worth it is if you drink a few beers, or eat and drink before you get there or somewhere else and plan on standing around people watching. \\n\\nService sucks, food sucks, drinks suck....not much else to add to our review."},{"name":"Mike's Pastry","address":"300 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Yum .

Good heat in the batter or in the sauce, and the bread and butter zucchini were also a nice twist - not heavy pickled, but a good flavor add. The spicy honey butter was probably unnecessary, and also, oddly, was  on top of the sandwich. Like...on top of the top of the bun. So you have to scrape it off and apply it yourself to the inside of the bun, and then the outside of the bun is all greasy and buttery, and you're just gonna make more of a mess than you already were.

When we got up to order (only 1 other person in front of us) I asked how long the wait was, and the guy said 20 minutes. \\n\\nWe sat there for 50 minutes waiting for our food. The counter area filled with people, all waiting for their food, which made the restaurant look really busy, but if they had actually been turning out food with any kind of speed, there wouldn't have been more than 2 people waiting at a time. \\n\\n50 minutes is an eternity when you're surrounded by warm food smells from the kitchen, and your boyfriend wouldn't listen to you when you said \\"It's 6, and I'm hungry now, let's just go\\".

I just don't think they cared enough to give me what I ordered, considering there were 15+ people jammed into the tiny counter area all clamoring and waiting for their food, rubbing their vulture eyes all over my precious hard-won tray of mild, fit-for-an-infant spiced curry.

Or at least in Portland?\\n\\nI feel that every chef has the right to interpret this dish differently and Bruce Lee's Kitchen has a 'Pat Thai' that is a (nice - imho) departure from the deeply artificially colored heavily tamarind cousins that are slapped into shallow bowls all around Portland.\\n\\nFor less than $6.00 I filled my belly with a mellow, plentiful, pale in color, rice noodle, egg, gentle heat from Thai chili pepper, chicken thigh meat, bean sprout, green onion, albeit oily interpretation of 'Pad Thai'.\\n\\nAfter the first few bites, and as it cooled, the flavors changed and it got better and better. There was a combination of flavors; ever-so-slight sweetness, peanut oil, savory chicken, the very fresh green onions...  the dish would have been made even better if I had a lime wedge to squeeze on this bad boy.\\n\\nI am really not a purist here folks... truth is, you're hard pressed to be served an ethnic dish by someone who is actually from the country of the dish's origin. I know that some people (and often never from that country) bitch, moan, hem and haw about how something isn't authentic. I say... Go out there and make it yourself then if you don't like what's being served you sassy monkeys!\\n\\nFor me... It didn't suck.

My friend and I were super close to getting Voodoo before our hike, but I came across this place while browsing Yelp in the morning. This is probably the best audible my friend and I called during our trip last weekend. \\n\\nWe got here a little past 8am on a Sunday morning, and the line was about 7-8 people deep when we walked in. I waited at least 5 minutes until I finally placed my order. There's quite a few flavors to choose from, and I also read that they are known for their chai drinks. \\n\\nI ended up ordering 8 donuts. Sounds excessive right? Not exactly, when you realize they are freshly made mini donuts. To me, these are the kind of donuts you'll see at county fairs (I believe there's a stand at pier 39 in SF), but the flavors are what really set them off. The reason why I ordered 8 was because I wanted to sample a bunch of flavors:honey with sea salt, cinnamon sugar, maple bacon (ordered 2), dirty wu (ordered 2), nutella, and meyer lemon pear butter (ordered 1, got 2). So yea, I ended up with a 9th donut, but don't tell them! I also ordered a King and I chai to go with it. \\n\\nThe 20% Yelp offer was clutch, as my order came out a little over $7! If that's still available on your app, use it! My favorite was the maple bacon. Not because its bacon, obviously, but because of the overall savory taste. The bacon tasted like it was just cooked and chopped up into really tiny bits. Having the powered sugar on top of it was a nice touch as well. Runner up goes to the dirty wu, which was basically a cinnamon sugar and nutella combined. That combo sounds like a winner already, and I'd definitely get that again. The other flavors are solid, but the dirty wu and maple bacon stop out the most to me. The chai drinks make for a solid compliment, and I'd definitely want tot ry the other flavors if I go again.\\n\\nI still went to Voodoo later on in my trip, but right now I'm still thinking about how impressive Pip's is. If the locals tell you go to here instead, you do that. Therefore I did. \\n\\nService gets a pass because there's a bunch of donuts being made to order. With a lot of customers inside, it can take awhile, so be ready for that. The staff are really friendly here, and the quality of donuts show how much they care about making great food.

Well it's all that is Disney and that it is the Main street formerly known as 'Downtown Disney' (not sure why they wanted to change names)  But, as Disney goes, they are always evolving and creating new & imaginative ways for us to be magically entertained.  \\n\\nDisney doesn't hold back on imagination, ever! (that might be why their team of engineers are called Imagineers)  And anything Disney is a great way to escape the monotone of a regular schedule & jump into a world of childhood imagination (even if only for a couple of hours)  No matter how old you are you just have to love the life size Lego 'Pete's dragon' in the lagoon.  OK, so maybe it's not Pete's dragon, but that's what I think of when I see it as I revert back to my childhood imagination.  Or maybe you will just like the dancing water?  Entertainment & Imagination abound here!\\n\\nIt is even possible that maybe you just want to dine out - You have a multitude of options & it grows constantly.  Why DOES ice cream taste better when you are listening to music as you watch water droplets dance in colorful lighting.  It's like magic.\\n\\nI love browsing the shops & seeing all the incredibly neat items for sale.  Although you have to admit a lot of items are probably priced for tourist (yes in all honesty you could go broke here)  Sometimes it's worth it.

Once seated, the waiters/waitresses are very attentive and quick to respond to dropped forks and refilling water & coffee cups. I had trouble deciding from all the tasty sounding options, but went with the macadamia & coconut pancakes with sausage as well as french press coffee and a grimosa (grapefruit juice sparkling wine). The food & drinks came very quickly despite how busy they were. I asked for real maple syrup instead of the syrup it comes with which they were quick to comply with. (I can only eat the real stuff). The pancakes were delicious and not too sweet. The nuts & coconut gave them a great texture. I prefer the Grimosa to a Mimosa as it's much less sweet.

My sister had been a few weeks earlier and was very impressed. I was not at all impressed with anything but the view. Service was horrible, the food was horrible, and our waitress was very rude to me. I saw her roll her eyes several times.\\n\\nWe went around 5pm with a party of 13. Since they don't take reservations, we expected at wait of at least 45 minutes. To our surprise, we were called back after only 20 minutes. \\nThe waiter put 2 four top tables together and attempted to fit 13 very large chairs around them. He then got another four top and expected us to sit with our elbows overlapping. They were going to add another table but that would have had some of us partially blocking the door leading out to the balcony. Finally another waiter decided to have us move to another section, we just had to wait for them to put those tables together and clear it off. It ended up being about 40 minutes before we were seated.\\n\\nOnce we were seated, no one came by to take our drink order for quite awhile. After our drink order was delivered we sat there, ready to order, not looking a menus and waited almost 10 minutes for our waitress to come back. Our waitress did not offer drink refills to our end of the table, we had to request them. She didn't clear away any empty glasses or plates. To her credit, she did cater to the other end of the table quite nicely and with a nice attitude. Not sure why she didn't do the same for those of us at the other end. \\n\\nThe food came out fast, that's about the only good thing I can say about that. I ordered the Texas Red Fish with rice and saut√©ed vegetables. The fish was over cooked and dry, the vegetables consisted mainly of barely cooked peppers and onions, a few small pieces of broccoli, and inedible asparagus stems. The butter cilantro lime \\"sauce\\" on the side was downright nasty. Just to make sure it wasn't me, I had my sister taste the fish and the \\"sauce\\" and watched her grimace. I was able to eat some of the fish only because I was hungry. The rice wasn't bad but was quite bland. \\n\\nIn my opinion, the only thing this place has to offer is the amazing view.

Finally our server shows up and has this look on her face like \\"well, what do you want?\\" This kind of turned my friend and I off and my friend was especially upset because it was really hot outside and she felt our server should have at least brought over water right off the bat. Moving forward, Cambridge Common has an awesome and most impressive beer assortment (many on tap), so I ordered myself an Berkshire Hefeweizen which was a cold crisp and refreshing white beer with a hint of lemon, delicious!!! For our entrees I ordered the quarter pound burger with bacon, American cheese and mushrooms, \\"well\\".

The waiter was somewhat standoffish at first, and not incredibly welcoming at first, but he seemed to relax through the visit. We didn't have to wait long for anything, everything came out at the perfect time. The music was a little loud for the time of day, and it was somewhat difficult to have a quiet conversation, but that's just personal preference. \\n\\nWe ordered some drinks. She had the Ruby Red Mule, she enjoyed it enough to have two. I had the High West Old Fashioned and it was so strong, and good, I only needed one :)\\n\\nWe had the queso to start, it was very good. It was creamy, the avocado was still almost whole, which was interesting when trying to chop it up to scoop it out with a chip. The chips were wonderful. Not oily, they tasted fresh and were perfectly seasoned. \\n\\nWe each ordered the two meat plate. My friend had the brisket and the ribs. I had the brisket and the chicken. We both had waffle fries and baked macaroni and cheese as our sides (yay carbs!) We both immediately noticed that the brisket was very dry. I had a regular slice and an end slice. The end was far juicier, but mostly because it was more fatty. I used a lot of sauce to cover the dryness of the meat, though it's isn't entirely bad because their sauce is very good. She said her ribs were ok, she mentioned it was also dry. My chicken was thigh piece and again, was dry, though it had a good seasoning. There wasn't a lot of meat on it. I think I got about 5 solid bites off of it. For $17, it wasn't the masterpiece I was expecting. My favorite parts were the sides, the waffle fries had a great seasoning and were just the right combination of crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. \\n\\nNow the Mac and cheese. It was the shining star of the plate. It had the creamiest texture, the perfect amount of baked cheesy topping, and this amazing spiciness to it. I almost wished I had just had that as a meal. It is some of the best baked mac and cheese I've had. \\n\\nFor dessert she had the sour cherry fried pie. She enjoyed it and commented that the crust was much better than she expected. She had expected dry and flaky, and it was neither. I had the sopapilla cheesecake. It was truly divine. An absolute favorite and I would go back to Lambert's just for this cheesecake. It is creamy and velvety, the topping was much like a ground up churro.

I found myself just saying yes to everything. I ordered 12 donuts. I ate them all myself. I am not ashamed. I got 2 of each flavor (nutella filled, cinnamon sugar, bacon jam, apricot and jabenero, sea salt and raw honey and the dirty wu which is a combo of nutella, sea salt, honey and cinnamon) and the heart of gold chai because I saw the word toasted coconut and that's all that matters.

We've been twice on a weekday morning/early afternoon. \\n\\nPros:\\n-Toys are new and clean (so far) and the slide/climbing apparatus does really make it more interesting for the kids than other coffee shops that have a few toys in a corner.\\n\\n-LOTS of toys; plenty for all to share even during a busy time. Plus plenty of books.\\n\\n-Food is fine with plenty of choices for all. Not just muffins and bagels but paninis, a variety of kid snacks, fries and tater tots, smoothies, etc.\\n\\n-I'm not even opposed to the $3 per kid charge if it means they'll keep the toys clean and updated. So many of these places end up with a few buckets of broken and mismatched, absolutely grubby toys after a few months of operating. Plus your $3 goes towards food if you order $15 or more. This is a new policy, I think.\\n\\nCons:\\n(Why it didn't get 4 or more stars)\\n\\n-Food service is very slow, even for basic items like cheese and crackers and lots of the food is nothing you couldn't get at a grocery store. Of course, if I wanted to go to the grocery store and feed my kid I would just do that but obviously I don't and that's why I come to a play cafe.\\n\\n- The biggest con for me personally is that both times I've been there there was at least one bearded stay-at-home dad (why bearded? I dunno, they just were. All three of them.) camped out on the wi-fi and making loud phone calls while his kid ran AMOK and pestered the heck out of the other kids and parents. These guys like to sit far away from the play area and let other people teach their kids manners while they update their blogs or whatever. There needs to be a time limit or some kind of oversight of the play area because personally I think these folks are abusing the system and making an unpleasant atmosphere for others. \\n\\nI will definitely come back if desperate but will think twice about it just because of the lousy behavior of other customers."},{"name":"Linh Caf√© - French Cooking","address":"2836 W 4th Avenue","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Stopped here on the way back from a visit to the Museum of Anthropology.

You are a stone-throw away but even then, I shan't be too excited at the idea of being back. They were off to a rough start with the menu and service, etc, when I first visited a few years ago. I heard they have since revamped their menu and are eagerly trying out new things for the restaurant. Service is strange here. Can't put my finger on it - I'll come back to that. We checked out the new menu, which we were told was about to change, again. Avocado fritters caught my eye right away so we got one of those. Deep fried avocado... Literally nothing could go wrong. My friend decided on fish tacos and the signature salad. The avocado fritters were great, as expected. The signature salad was quite tasty with ample dressing - point! Unfortunately, the fish tacos were disappointing. Double tortilla-shelled kind of sad. Man, was it dry. The mango salsa helped a little, not really. An order comes with three tacos; I had one and had to take the rest to-go. I got home to find that the mango salsa had not been included in my take-out box. Fun. *Removes point given for salad dressing*  \\n\\nThe bill came and we found to our horror that fountain soda costs a whopping $4. We didn't even stay long enough for a refill. I was appalled. The food isn't cheap to begin with, so I don't think the fountain drink prices should be so harsh. I can appreciate adding discretionary refill charges to guests who order a fountain drink and sit for hours on their laptops but we had food and all; really no reason for that. They also forgot the limes for my soda water. The waiter attempted to take my entire glass of soda water with him in order to bring the limes. I gently suggested he bring the limes separately... So he did. This is where service was strange for us. Our server seemed very plucky, almost too plucky. If you demand the cost, we demand the service. There must be a reason to charge $4 for fountain drinks here. FYI, I had to dust food and crumbs off the seats in the booth myself. You would expect them to be cleaned after each sitting.\\n\\nThank goodness for good company at the table.

The portions were quite large! I think the people who ordered the crunchy french toast enjoyed their meal the most. I had never had corned beef hash before, but I thought it was delicious. There were two medium eggs on top, and I had an english muffin to dig in with. I ate about half of the hash, but I really enjoyed it (especially with ketchup added).\\n\\nThe staff was darling and I would absolutely come again."},{"name":"Mike's Pastry","address":"300 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I have never been to a place with a line as long as this.  You would think that if this place is so famous and they are so busy, that they would expand or get a bigger place to accommodate the high volume of customers.  Many people coming are likely tourists, so expecting them to wait in line for hours is crazy, but people still do it.  \\n\\nMy friends and I got very lucky.  We walked up to the shop late at night right before they closed and were able to make it inside. Once there, it was so chaotic and there was complete disorganization.  You literally had seconds to make a decision about what you wanted, otherwise the cashiers would move on without a second thought and good luck trying to get their attention once that happens.  \\n\\nI am not a fan of cannolis, so I ended up getting some cupcakes, macaroons, and other cookies to take back to my office.  They were all pretty tasty, but nothing mind-blowing.  I did try a bite of a cannoli from my friend, and wasn't impressed, but then again, I don't care for them anyway. My friends said they weren't bad, though.\\n\\nOverall, I do think that there is a lot more hype about the name itself, than the pastries being extraordinary. I, personally, do not think it is worth it to spend your precious vacation time in a VERY LONG pastry line, but if visiting this place is something you want to cross off your bucket list, then it may be worth it for you. \\nLastly, do have cash ready in hand!

The stay was a series of miscues and disappointments that while minor they added up to an extremely frustrating stay that made me thankful that I was only in the room for a grand total of about 6 hours.\\n\\nIt started when we were driving up and called the property to find out about parking rates. It took two transfers and three people to answer this question. Seriously. Why does it take three people to answer something as elementary as this? I realize switchboards only take calls but they should be able to field minor inquiries such as this one.\\n\\nWhen we actually drove up, the person manning the entrance said we couldn't valet because they were full. When I said I was a guest, he said, \\"well, I guess you guys can drive up\\". I know he was frustrated, it was brutally hot and people are coming in for Bat Fest parking as well as the Texas 4000 gala that was going on in the hotel but I didn't even get as much as a welcome to the Hyatt, a pretty basic touch for a 4-star hotel.\\n\\nThe valet area was busy because of the aforementioned events above, but it was disorganized. I had to tell two valets that I was a guest and not there for the gala, one of which told me to go check in then come back. Huh? What's the difference? The other guy was more helpful and gave me a ticket.\\n\\nThe room left a lot to be desired considering my recent stays at other 4-star properties: the bathroom looked straight out of a Holiday Inn with popcorn ceiling and a low shower head that had three temperatures: hot, hotter, scalding. The beds, I ended up having to get two doubles, were tiny! I know double beds are small but these were an inch or two wider than a twin. The frame on some of the artwork was chipped and the room had this air that it had seen better days: the paint was looking a little faded, the alarm clock/iPod dock was a little old and dusty.\\n\\nThe next morning, while I was trying to check out through the TV, I noticed that for some boneheaded reason they charged me for valet parking twice so I called downstairs and told someone of this and they were able to easily fix the situation over the phone as well as check me out at that point.\\n\\nFinally, when I went to the front desk to ask for a receipt, it was almost a hassle for the gentleman to produce the receipt, since according to him, I had already been checked out! Yes, that's true, but producing a copy of a receipt of a guest that checked out moments before shouldn't be a problem.\\n\\nLike I stated above, there was nothing wrong with the place per se but there were a series of miscues that made this Hyatt stay very unsatisfactory.

I thoroughly enjoy their healthier selections, their tendency switch up parts of the menu regularly, and the customer service they provide.\\n\\nI mostly frequent this location for lunch and/or order lunch for my office and pick it up. On one occasion a few months back we had ordered for about 10 and there was a mix up as many of the orders were customized but the staff was able to correct the issue promptly and to my satisfaction.\\n\\nSalads are increasingly popular these days but I am often disappointed by the execution and overall flavor, not so at LongHorn. One of my favorite salads is the 7 pepper sirloin salad here. It's huge and has tremendous flavor (especially the steak itself) all while managing to stay on the healthy side. Other than the salads I'm a sucker for their seasonal chicken dishes (balsamic raspberry chicken, chipotle orange chicken, etc) as well as their spinach feta chicken. When trying to eat healthy you don't want to sacrifice flavor and they do a great job of packing in the flavor without the calories.\\n\\nIn addition to the food there are many other reasons I have and will continue to come back here. The staff seems to be generally cheerful which projects onto yourself as a patron.  As a big guy I am also appreciative of the roominess of their booths. Myself and 2 other co-workers who dine out for lunch regularly are all over 6'2\\" and normally have to ask for a table as booths tend to be restricting but that is not the case here.\\n\\nThere have been a few times in the past where during a busy lunch the food has taken longer than expected to be served. Even during these occasions though the server has always kept us in the loop and apologized.\\n\\nIn spirit  of full disclosure, I was recently asked to dine here by their marketing team to try out their new menu. It was made clear that no review was expected or even requested in return. Beyond that, I have dined here almost 20 times already, always having pleasant experience, so them reaching out to me couldn't really impact my opinion to be more positive. I will however say that I was impressed that they are aware enough of their patrons to seriously value their feedback and patronage. \\n\\nDuring this particular dinner our server, Ian, was top notch. I have dined at some of   fanciest and expensive steakhouses in the South East and there is no doubt that he could easily be employed at one of them. It was my first opportunity to try the new balsamic raspberry chicken  which is easily one of the most unique (in the positive sense) chicken dishes I have had in a long time. And I eat a lot of different chicken dishes.  My date and I also enjoyed the chocolate stampede which could easily feed 4 people, it is that gigantic. It is also surprisingly inexpensive for the amount of food provided. \\n\\nIn general I tend to favor independently/family owned restaurants for their ability to stay creative and in order to support people who are in the business as a pleasure as opposed to  simply make a buck. I can say that after dining here regularly for the past year or so and getting to meet some of the management, not only is LongHorn able to keep their menu fresh and creative, the management is truly in the business for the right reasons."},{"name":"Vespaio Ristorante","address":"1610 S Congress Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"We were visiting from California when we tried this place.

The prime rib was done to perfection and tasteless except for the outer edges. \\n\\n Desserts weren't bad if you eat desserts.  The brownies were good along with the toll house cookie and the german chocolate \\"brownie\\".  The chocolate mousse was mediocre...kinda heavy.\\n\\nThat which needs improvement --  The seafood gumbo was overwhelmed with thyme.  The chicken fingers sesame were tough as nails, the shrimp bar was overcooked...   The smoked salmon seems to have been \\"drizzled\\" with oil or something that made the naturally oily fish ooze oil to the plate.

The salad next to it is just as good -- interesting lettuces and cabbage (maybe some fennel?) in a tangy mustard dressing.

Don't even think about eating here.\\n\\nFood (3/10)\\n\\n(4/10) Portabello Burger\\nServed with french fries and a side salad. The bun was soft and warm, but the portabello mushroom itself was more charred than grilled. The zucchinis and onions were mushy, and the whole burger was pretty dry. The French fries were huge and plentiful. They were seasoned nicely, and since we couldn't eat much of the burger, we kept munching on these huge pieces of fried potatoes. Seriously, look at the picture - one of the \\"french fries\\" ended up being as big as the burger! The side salad was of a decent size, but did not taste very fresh. We wouldn't recommend this burger, but maybe Mr. Bones was having an off day.\\n\\n(2/10) 2 Meat Combo Plate\\nComes with two side dishes, bread, sauce, pickles and onions. We chose the pulled pork and the turkey. We also picked the candied yams and the macaroni and cheese as our side items. This was by far, the worst piece of turkey ever. Not only did it smell strongly of burnt tires; it also tasted like rubber bands. We were truly horrified at the poor quality. The pork was only a notch better. It came on a bone and did not have much meat. The first bite seemed ok, but then it got drier and drier and some pieces included the outer skin, which were too hard to chew on. The BBQ sauce was decent. The candied yams must have come straight from a can because they were very watery, mushy, and had no flavor. The processed-tasting cheese had dried on the macaroni - as if it were sitting out for a while. We requested wheat bread and got two slices - it was fine. Overall, a very disappointing lunch.\\n\\nService (3/10)\\n\\nIt started out well - we went on a Wednesday around 12:30 during our lunch break. The restaurant was about half full. We were seated promptly by the hostess, and we started looking at the menus. After that it went downhill alarmingly fast. Nobody came by to take our order. We tried flagging down a waiter but to no avail. Finally, he came and took our drink and order. The drinks did come out. The food did not come out for another 25 minutes and nobody came to update us. We got our food, but there was no mac and cheese, nor any bread/pickles/onions. The side item came out a few minutes later but the bread failed to show up. We asked for it again, and the waiter brought it over near the end of our meal. Needless to say, we weren't check up on once, and our waters remained empty. We asked another waitress for our check, since we couldn't find our waiter. She was about to ring us up, but then found him and told him to do it. He forgot what we had ordered, got flustered, handed us our separate receipts, but couldn't find a pen. I told him it was ok because I had one on me. My friend was charged an extra $6. This took even longer to clear up. After 10 minutes, our waiter admitted his mistake, apologized and handed over $6 in cash, since the credit card had already been charged. He asked us to not tell his manager about our frustrations. We felt badly for him, but were also eager to get back to work...we had been there for 1 hour and 45 minutes. The service here can be summed up in two words: inept and slow.\\n\\nAmbiance (4/10)\\n\\nMr. Bones is located in a nice strip mall across from Dell Childrens Hospital. There are quite a few food places within walking distance. It's a casual place with a good amount of tables and chairs. The walls are kind of bare and could use some d√©cor, but they do keep the inside clean.

The setup is simple and efficient.\\n\\nOf course, what really matters is the food.  And it was amazing.  Perfectly cooked chicken: moist, crispy on the outside, bursting with flavor.  I got the hot dark, with mac and cheese and slaw.  Just the right size; I had a little of the sides left over but demolished the rest.  Hot was perfect for me.  Made me sweat a little, and go for multiple refills of sweet tea.  Sweetie had it cold and white.  We made smart-ass comments.  She loved hers.  I tasted it- seasoned, but no heat (or my taste-buds may have been overwhelmed by mine...)  \\n\\nI guess hot chicken is a Nashville tradition, but Sweetie lived there for a year and never heard of it.  Maybe it's a pretty recent tradition, like in the last 10 years?  Anyway, it's amazing.  It's everything I want fried chicken to be.  The heat is flavorful and intense; it's that addicting heat that sears your mouth, but then makes you go back for more.\\n\\nThe mac and cheese was damn good, actually coming close to Sweetie's mom's.  Cheesy, creamy, dense.  A meal in itself.  The slaw was vinegary and fresh.  You also get some bread to sop up the chicken drippings and give your mouth a rest.  The tea was just sweet enough to be called sweet tea; normally I'd want it a bit sweeter, but in this case I was using it to clear my burning palate so it was great.\\n\\nWe'll be back.

Our server appeared soon after to take our drink order and we ordered an appetizer at that time. Drinks came, but no app. We ordered our entrees at that time.

My wife had the pork ribs which were juicy and came with a tasty, silghtly sweet sauce. So far so good. I had the brisket, which was dry, somewhat chewy and sliced fairly thickly. Not very good. The best thing about my plate were the pickled vegetables, slightly spicy, which I used to moisten every bite of the brisket. There were house made sauces and mustard on the table which while good were not enough to save the brisket. Our side of cheezy grits was pretty good, and I'm generally not a grits fan so that's saying something.\\n\\nSince we missed out on the appetizer and had lots of time to kill we decided to share a dessert. We chose the bananna split (my wife needs to eat gluten free) and I ordered a burbon as well.

I'm used to traveling and staying in a hotel and because I'm a paying guest at the hotel I get certain privileges such as free parking since I am a guest or a complimentary breakfast...

Staff was really nice and accommodating. Very polite! I headed up to the room while my boyfriend parked the car... $23 a night for parking when I'm a guest is outrageous and there's nothing you can say or do about it because you have to leave your car somewhere... They should really look into the policy... Just cause other hotels do it doesn't make it right... \\nSo room info... We ended up upgrading to a river view room... On the 11th floor... Upon entering I felt like it was a pretty cramped room... It seems like it has been renovated and stuff to look more modern... It was nice can't complain but the layout of the room just was cramped I always felt like I was running into something. \\nThe staff here is very polite and accommodating...

I got fish tacos and the sauce that comes with it has a film on it like it had been sitting out for ages (with a presumably mayo based sauce this is dangerous) and the fish was gross. My boyfriends meal was also cold. I called and told the host the situation, and he told me they would remake the food, and emphasized how generous he was being by not making me pay twice. wtf? So I went back to the restaurant pretty quickly and went to pick up my food which was not even ready yet (this time so I could be SURE it would be warm). I insisted they give me a refund for my order, since it's ridiculous having to come all the way back to do this, and we are lucky we live so close and have that option. The host was very irritated but finally talked to the manager, who gave me two $10 gift cards to use next time. What a joke. That didn't even cover the entire meal, and they could have just voided the credit card transaction. \\n\\nThe other day this happened pretty much exactly again (except I did not bother asking for a refund because \\"fool me once..\\") but I will never order fish tacos from here again, nor will I actively seek out food from here anymore.

Ken Oringer restaurants have held their reign in my short list of top Boston restaurants for years, so I didn't expect any different from Little Donkey. And perhaps the dinner menu outshines the lunch one, but I wasn't impressed. My friend lamented about this place, saying how all her hipster friends loved it. And, well, hipsters complain about everything except plaid and PBR, so, naturally, I thought, \\"YAAAAS\\".\\n\\nThe interior and ambiance itself is gorgeous, as hipster chic as can be. Natural light pours in and accentuates the artist industrial loft-meets restaurant feel, with the huge windows, high beams and walls, exposed brick and concrete slabs as walls. Service is top-notch.\\n\\nBut, alas...what really matters: THE FOOD.\\n\\nMy friend had the beet tartare, which got a thumbs up. But my dish, the Farro Kimchi Fried Rice, fell pretty flat in flavor and overwhelmingly like someone went confetti-crazy with the salt. As another reviewer mentioned, the flavors of the dish ended up competing too much to be complementary. The kimchi with Thai herbs and green curry, with an egg on top. It just ended up tasting like nothing much, to be honest. The flavors weren't distinct, and strangely, you couldn't taste the kimchi flavor at all. In the end, I think the farro was the wrong choice for this dish -- the grainy texture didn't work with the already-confusing combination of flavors, and if anything, accentuated just how much this dish tasted like random flavors tossed into a blender with a gallon of salt. There must be a reason I went through two pitchers of water in one lunch sitting...\\n\\nMy instinct says I simply didn't luck out with the right choice of dish, so I'll likely give it another go, but the consistency of flavor for all dishes needs to be fine-tuned, if this is to be on par with other Oringer gems. For a dish that's a tried and true Asian comfort food, Oringer perhaps focused too much on going all high-brow and adventurous fusion, and ended up missing the bulls-eye on what makes the flavors in Kimchi Fried Rice such an incredibly delicious dish."},{"name":"Hae Rim","address":"11729 SW Beaverton-Hillsdale Hwy","city":"Beaverton","stars":"4","text":"Pretty good food.

It started off well enough. When we first walked in, the Manager guy was VERY Friendly. And so was the Hostess AT FIRST. I figured out that maybe the issue was perhaps we were being too nice in response. You know, some people feel that if you're not being a mean snitty snob that you're a nobody or whatever. Not that a hostess making $9/hour and a server depending on tips for good service should be treating anyone bad based on who they think someone is or wasn't. So anyway, after being seated in the far table next to the restroom and the patio door, my girlfriend wanted to move so I went back to Hostess. Instead of just moving us- (not taking no money out her pocket)- she wantes to argue back \\"Well, the bathroom is actually over there so...\\" I mean she actually gave us attitude and debate about moving a table! When we sat down,several times the bussers or somebody kept brushing my arm. The server walked away after bringing us water, and I was just about to order wine.

The restaurant used to be a Juan Colorado and still looks like a Mexican place.  The landscaping is decent, but the building could use a serious makeover.\\n\\nDon't let appearances stop you from trying this place, though.  The food is simply great.  I've loved Greek food since I first tried it at Johnny's Greek Restaurant (sadly closed for years) in Old Town PDX as a kid.  When Johnny's closed, I'd get my Greek on at Alexis or that place with the giant octopus (I think they've gone out of business too), and I managed to learn to make a pretty decent facsimile of Johnny's Chicken Soup Avgolemono (orzo lemon chicken). \\n\\nThen, like a gift from the gods, Antoni's moved into my neighborhood.  We tried it because we could walk to it from home, but we keep going there because the food and service are great.  Plus you can get late night food which is rare in Beaverton.\\n\\nTheir lamb gyros are not only the best in Beaverton (as they claim), but the best I've ever had.  The only complication is that they have a \\"deluxe\\" gyro that comes with feta (which is a must) but also has potatoes in it, which I don't like.  Then they have a regular gyro that does not have potatoes but also does not have feta.  We always have to order \\"Regular lamb gyros, add feta\\" to get them just right, but I always feel a little Sally (i.e. When Harry Met...) when I have to special order something.  But, to their credit, they are always cheerful about it.\\n\\nI also highly recommend the Flaming Saganaki, which is cheese set on fire.  It's quite a show, but it also tastes so good... savory with a lemony tang. The Dolmathes are fabulous too. \\n\\nMy teen daughter has had good success with the Chicken Fettuccini Alfredo and Chicken Marsala.  We've also had breakfasts there and felt they were solid as well, though they could stand to improve their Bloody Mary's.\\n\\nOther friends have tried various menu items and seemed to be quite pleased with them.  None of us has ever had a bad meal.  However, their lemon chicken soup is just not that good... watery, rice instead of orzo, and bland.  (I have a great recipe I'd be happy to share...)\\n\\nThe service is consistently friendly and prompt.  My only complaint is that the ambiance and d√©cor need serious attention.  The inside is like a cross between a rundown Disneyland facade, a Mexican restaurant, and a retirement home cafeteria.  It's relatively clean, but just not pleasing.  I always wish they would update it with a fresh coat of paint (the classic white and blue one would expect at a Greek restaurant) and entirely new flooring and furniture.  It would take this place from 4 stars to 5, and probably result in much more business than they seem to have now.\\n\\nStill, I highly recommend the food and you can also get quality take out, so please do give this place a try."},{"name":"The OASIS on Lake Travis","address":"6550 Comanche Trl","city":"Austin","stars":"2.5","text":"Went here for late lunch/early dinner on my birthday, wanting to eat somewhere with a nice view.

One Friday when I had a day off, I mentioned to my friend who works downtown that I'd been wanting to check out Mother's for ages.  She had eaten there numerous times and had declared it her favorite spot, so off we went. \\n\\nAt 7:30 AM, we found easy on-street parking and no wait for a table. It's a large space and because of the early hour, one side was closed to seating. My friend had been hoping to sit on the side that was closed, due to the neat, old-timey vibe over there. When she mentioned it to our hostess, we were told \\"no problem.\\" So, already feeling like a lady of leisure, having the day off work and eating breakfast out, I was also treated to private dining! The excellent service should not go without mention, but what really wowed me was the biscuits and gravy. I'd say the best I've ever tasted. The bacon was perfectly crisp. Add to that my own pot of French press coffee. Heaven! \\n\\nIt was a lot of food--I was full but it was too good to leave behind, so I packed up half to take home for later. Now for my confession. Heading home, I was about to cross the river, when wouldn't ya know it, the bridge went up. It was raised for what seemed like an eternity. And before long, I had opened the takeout container and began picking at the leftover biscuits and gravy. Just a little nibble. Oh, just one more. Another little bite and I'll quit.

The college-aged kid at the front desk had disappeared, and so I walked down winding halls to search for the gym.

I first ordered from here in June after seeing them on The Chronicle when they did a show on Chelsea. The first time I ordered I got the salmon rools, pork rolls/dumplings and a curry noodle dish. I was very disappointed with the lack of flavor inthe dishes. I held off writing a review because I always feel that every place deserves a second chance. Lats night I decided to give it another go. After being in traffic for an hour I swung by to get a take out menu but they did not have any. So i went home and viewed the menu online. While looking at the menu I noticed most of the dishes have the same flavor base - its either Garlic, thai basil/mint/cilantro, coconut curry and more garlic. I ended up ordering the turkey rolls, vegan rolls, pho soup, garlic wings, and the pork chop dish. \\nMy biggest disappointment was that all of the food was over cooked. Everything except the soup that is. I believe the wings cost $6.95 but I only recieved 3 wings!!!!

Both times I've eaten here I've had the pasta alfredo with added grilled chicken for a slight upcharge (the dish in total is about $16). For an appetizer the chocloate bread (about $3) is a must, but only if you like dark chocloate, because the bread is very rich. They give carmel butter spread to accompany the bread which makes it even better. The shakes are the talk of the town but if you can't handle too much sweets I would strongly suggest sharing one. \\n*Also, they have the best gluten free buns.

If you get lucky and get a fresh batch, they are quite good, however they pre-make so many, and cannoli get soggy pretty quickly if not eaten, so my recommendation is to order what you see being carried out to the counter. So, oddly enough the best time to get cannoli is when they are the busiest, if you have the time.\\n\\nAmbiance-wise, if you are seen carrying a box around prominently, you're probably a tourist because visiting Mike's is as much a part of the Boston experience as the Freedom Trail, Faneuil Hall, or catching a Sox game.\\n\\nAll in all, Mike's is good, just not as good as the omnipresent boxes would suggest."},{"name":"Mighty Subs","address":"250 Highland Ave","city":"Needham","stars":"4.5","text":"This sandwich shop has the best subs in Massachusetts bar none.

For 2 months of our lease we had no functioning stove, w/o any compensation at all, but the bigger issue is unrepaired hurricane damage. There's a stucco blowout on the side of the home. There was also water intrusion from under the slab (a common problem in our subdivision - shoddy building). Between the stucco issue & the water from under the slab, we had just about 1' of water in the living/family rooms - which resulted in my losing 3 bookshelves w/ damage to my couch, loveseat, dining room table, & loss of an oriental rug. We called the realtor during the storm to make them aware. It took days for anyone to call us back, & we felt like we got the run around even then. In talking to the insurance adjuster who finally came out a month later, they rec. the bottom of the drywall be cut & blowers brought in to dry the walls - moisture level of 60% below window level. Realtor ignored us for the longest time, then when adjuster finally came out they completely ignored his recs. No repairs have been done. They are also aware of a leak in the tub which caused water spots on the ceiling downstairs, & then a prior leak in the master bath with water spots on the ceiling downstairs. The adjuster said there are 25 cracks/holes in the stucco. When it rains for an ext period we get water in the living room, & when the wind blows you can hear it in the walls.

Was expecting these to be chock full of sausage since they're $4 a piece but a TINY dot of Chinese sausage was tucked inside - literally one marble's worth.  I find it comical these are listed under \\"Charcuterie\\" section of menu.  Price these at $2 a piece, crumble up some more Chinese sausage and throw it in, or serve these as table house rolls which would make me a repeat customer.\\n* Manti (Istanbul Meat Ravioli): $14 for around 6?  Nothing unusual but these were delicious and one of our two favorite of the six dishes.\\n* Matzo Ball Ramen: $13. Conceptually, sounds interesting, right?  Sadly, it didn't work for me.  The matzo balls were huge and under seasoned so once you broke into one of these Deathstars, you needed a lot of seasoning to give them flavor, but the broth flavor didn't jive with them. The corn was really good though.  FAIL.\\n* Cucumber Salad: $11. This was unusual and tasty.  Our other favorite dish of the six we tried.\\n* Halibut Biryani: $14.  Good size portion for two. We love Indian food and spices but the spice combos in this dish were too intense if that's possible, so we couldn't eat a lot of it.\\n* Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough: $8.  It's a big dollop of ... chocolate chip cookie dough stuck on a spoon.  Was nothing special.  I get its simplicity and novelty, but again, $8 for one spoons worth??  $4 would be more fair, or give us 3 different interesting doughs for $8.\\n\\nLunch: Sat at bar with BF.  Had 3 entrees.\\n* Spicy Chickpea Stew: $9.  Bowl size.  Split it with the boyfriend.  Pickled lime and aioli were delicious touches. \\n* Burger: $15. The burger was delicious - all components work beautifully together - however, that's all you get, one thin patty burger (there's no ordering its doneness b/c it's so thin) and ZERO sides for $15.  Looked sad and lonely on the metal tray it comes out on.  I had to order a SECOND burger for another $15 to get full - mind you, I've eaten more than half the stew and devoured the first burger.  I asked the barkeep about any sides and she reported back that for an additional $3 dollars, you can get a side of the potato chips.  REALLY??  You can't spare some chips to throw on there if even for aesthetics alone??

We had no trouble parking and you cannot beat the drive through gorgeous Cohasset center to get there.  Our waitress was friendly, attentive, informative and knew the specials and the regular menu like the back of her hand.

We started with the chef's board and could not have been happier.  Not only is the selection varied, plentiful and interesting, the house made relishes and mustard, house cured meats, along with the bread basket with an assortment of house made warm, crisp crostini and soft bread made for a very enjoyable \\"start\\".  We then decided to order our go-to app of mussels in garlic wine sauce and were blown away.  The mussels (local from Chatham accord to the waitress) were huge, tender and absolutely to DIE for - the sauce was straw worthy - we settled for more bread to sop it up...  Easily the best mussels I can recall ever having.  The only downside to all of this - is we were too full to order dinner!  We decided to end the decadent meal with something sweetly decadent and split the chocolate lava cake.  It was incredibly rich and chocolaty, without being tooth-achingly sweet - worth every last calorie.\\n\\nThe restaurant / bar definitely got busier as the evening went on and it made for a nice atmosphere that was romantic (lots of couples) but also casual and fun.

Service was great other than our dessert order getting lost. Wine list is decent. Decor is warm and relaxing. Overall ambience is perfect for this type of place. \\n\\nHouse pickles - Great bite with crunch and tanginess. \\n\\nChicken feet with house sriracha - Worth trying. Definitely an acquired taste, but well done. \\n\\nCold noodles - Bland, flat, lacking flavor and seasoning. Not sure what they're going for here...perhaps the idea of leftover takeout? Needs work.\\n\\nHouse special Pork and Shrimp Dumplings - Great flavor profile and cooked perfecly. Nice portions too. \\n\\nChar Siu Pork - Definitely one of their showstoppers and the highlight of our meal. Had to pay a pretty penny at $26, though. That's steakhouse pricing for  two steam buns and two cups of roast pork. Packed with flavor and cooked to perfection. Too pricey for the selection. \\n\\nCumin beef - Also flat and misses the mark. You get a cumin seed crunch every so often, but needs more depth of flavor. \\n\\nSesame balls - Warm and crunchy outside with warm bean paste inside. A wonderful little end to the meal. \\n\\nHopefully the menu is a work in progress, along with some of the prices. Overall, the prices are ok. Some menu items just need more work. I hope to see duck become more prominent on the menu and more steam bun options to truly make it \\"dope\\" in my eyes. \\n\\nI'll be back for sure.

We heard the waitress tell another table that the oysters were in season, and they were definitely the better than other places we've had them.  They were served on a bed of arugula and accompanied with balsamic vinaigrette and relish.  The escargot was delicious, and I enjoyed nothing more than dipping the bread in the accompanying green sauce as well.  \\n\\nOur entrees included the \\"Citrus Glazed Long Island Duck Breast with rosemary and maple roasted sweet potatoes, crisp confit leg, and cassis jus\\" ($25) and my \\"Guiness Braised Beef Short Ribs with blue cheese whipped potatoes.\\"  The short ribs were from the \\"Splits\\" section of the menu, which typically offers a lunch or dinner portion of the dish for $13 or $24.

The fried black cod and tofu/seafood soup in particular were delicious. The crab vermicelli, beef/pepper stirfry, and greens in broth were merely good (I've had better for a third of the price).\\n\\nThe staff seemed pretty young and inexperienced (ie. lots of wandering, changing plates at weird times, fumbling when setting down/clearing dishes) which isn't something that usually bothers me but definitely stuck out in a \\"fine dining\\" atmosphere. \\n\\nAnyways, it was good to try.

We were told time and again that the side dishes were 'family size', for example, and they most certainly were not. Even if this restaurant was in Europe, which it is not, these wouldn't pass for family anything. The meats were also all 6 ounce servings. This comes out to 3 ribs, for example. This isn't all surprising for a nice restaurant, but it was surprising for a bbq joint. Which leads us to the third takeaway - cost. 6 ounces of meat will set you back anywhere from $20-50. The sides were ok at $8, but family size they were not. Two people can easily get 2 sides, no matter what they tell you.\\n\\nShould you check it out if you're downtown?

We had reservations at 7:30. We didn't order until 8:05. After finally ordering, we were served some bad overly salted, overcooked calamari and not enough dipping sauce. When our main dishes came out, well, there was much to be desired. I was really hoping for a spectacular carbonara because of the name, but what I got was, well, a mess. The pasta was very thin and have a strange consistency. Scrambled eggs and white cheese sauce pasta is the best way I could describe it. Carbonara is supposed to have egg yolk, and not really any cream. I should've left when I saw that it had peas in the description. It also normally has shallots, white onions, that were basically impossible to find in the pasta, are not an equal substitute. Real carbonara doesn't have peas, or egg whites, or cream or flimsy white onions. When I decided I was done and my baby had finished his almost dry grilled chicken, we waited another 15 minutes for someone to bring us the check. Finally, I stopped someone and asked for a box and a check. He politely grabbed my meal, boxed it and assured us the check would be out. 10 minutes later, my date is holding his debit card in his hand, my clearly ready to go box is sitting on our table and everyone is ignoring us and walking right by. Finally I've had enough so I got up and went to the car. I didn't really want to sit there and continue being stressed. He finally comes out a 11 minutes later. When I asked if someone finally brought him the check, he said no, that he went to the bartender who told him he had to wait for a server, to which my boyfriend says we had no server, which prompts the bartender to go ask what table we were sitting at and then ask the waiters who was serving us and apparently babe hears them all basically say idk it wasn't my table. So the bartender comes back and says he's sorry that we had this experience. So someone brings out the check and tells my boyfriend that they took 25% off because of the service. So he pays and finally comes out to the car. \\n\\n\\nTo be honest, I really wanted to like this place, I desperately was searching for a carbonara as good as the one I had in San Diego years ago, but this place, was a definite miss.

This place is really authentic and really really rich and tasty (and not at all vegetarian, go figure)!   This heavy style of cuisine is an acquired taste for some and is a stark contrast to much of what's offered in this part of the country, but can be delightful and comforting in moderation.  Our server was very friendly and sincere and the service was quicker than I expected (everything is made fresh, so there's a bit of a wait, but I don't mind in the least bit if my food is made to order and I can drink a hard cider  or two in the meantime).  We went for an impromptu happy hour and had the place nearly to ourselves, which was surprising once I tasted their crispy and flavorful offerings.  We sampled the fried beets (yummy with a little vinegar and s&p), and the cheese, potato, and onion pasty (with chips) and the fish and chips (the happy hour version is a medley of various fish, which I think is a great display of resourcefulness).  Although the pasty was on the happy hour menu, I felt like it was a serious dinner portion, so be warned.  Bike parking would be a welcome addition and the curry sauce could have been a little thicker in texture, but the brown sauce that came with the pasty was so delish that we dipped everything in it.  Also, I had to take a nap almost immediately after eating here, everything was so filling.  This place's proximity to some great N.

I'll review the good, bad and the ugly about the dishes we ordered.\\n\\nIced Vietnamese coffee: Too sweet, and had chocolate sauce in it, which overshadowed the flavor of the coffee. Authentic Vietnamese iced coffee just has phin brewed coffee served on the rocks, with sweetened condensed milk. The coffee is bold and chocolatey itself, which does not require any add-ons. Clearly not the case here.\\n\\nPork Banh-Mi sandwich: It was decent. Nothing outstanding, but decent pork and pate with pickled carrots and onions with cilantro on a baguette. \\n\\nMajor disappointment begins with the main courses. \\n\\nPho Bo: Seriously, the worst broth ever. The broth tasted of Brillouin, not of beef bones and brisket, because it looked, and tasted pale and flavorless. I mean if a beef broth looks pale yellowish in color, you know it's gone wrong. None of the warm spices like cardamom, cinnamon, star anise were detected and a generous addition of herbs, lime and jalapenos still could not make the dish palatable. \\n\\nBeef stew: Much better than the pho, but astonishingly little beef in the stew. I could count about five or six small cubes of beef in my bowl. The stock was not bad, except that it tasted of vegetables, NOT BEEF. Again, it tasted of a standard mirepoix of carrots, celery and onions, not of beef!! I don't know what the deal is with the absence of beef in their stocks and broths.\\n\\nFinally, after some major disappointment, we decided to try some dessert just to leave on a happier note. We tried the creme brulee. Surprisingly, that was the only saving grace in the whole meal. The sugar could have used more caramelization (they are clearly using a meek butane torch...use a propane torch, really, if you want a good brulee!) but the strawberry compote on top was a nice tart addition that cut through the richness of the creme. \\n\\nOverall, there is no forgiving a bad Pho and main course in a \\"Vietnamese\\" restaurant, and I would not recommend it unless they learn how to make Pho Bo."},{"name":"Cafe Intermezzo","address":"6000 N Terminal Pkwy, Councourse B","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"Probably the best place in ATL airport for breakfast and lunch.

(If you're looking for a filling but decently low-cal meal, get the wrap with tofu instead of chicken and replace the chips and salsa on the side with the lightly steamed broccoli and peanut dipping sauce.)\\n\\n-The patio seating is beautiful and perfect while the weather is still nice. \\n\\n-The digital table check in for the servers to bring you your food is neat and works well. You order at the counter, you get a digital \\"key\\", you take it to your table or a seat at the bar, you slot it into a reader at your seat like a hotel room key, and they'll come deliver your food when it's ready. Nifty.\\n\\n-The general look of the place. I used to go the garden store that was in this location previously and the space feels totally different. Lots of beautiful dark wood and brushed metal.\\n\\nCons: \\n\\n-On the \\"serve yourself\\" drink fountains, the three water taps are poorly marked. One has a TINY and difficult to read sticker to indicate cold water, one has another equally difficult sticker that gives you room temperature water, and the third gives you carbonated sparkling/seltzer water. Guess who had three water glasses of trial and error today? I wasn't the only person I saw dump their water glass and go back to the taps for another try. They need better signage, a simpler way to fill your water glass, or both.\\n\\n-The entrance to the restaurant is a nasty bottleneck made worse by a bizzarely positioned wooden bench right as you enter that forces you to split left or right.\\n\\n-Though the food is very tasty, the prices often are not - I noticed that several dishes have been bumped up by a couple dollars compared to the prices in their Short North or Clintonville locations. The veggie burger is good, but I have a hard time agreeing that it is $13 good. Similarly, as much as I love their fresh made guacamole, paying $9 for an appetizer portion of it is a ripoff.\\n\\n-Service seemed a bit confused. We decided to order some food to go to take home to another family member, and were seated at the bar while we waited. Despite telling the bar tender that we were waiting for a carry-out order, he came by and gave each of us a place setting, then came back two more times to ask us if we wanted drinks with our meal. If it was peak hours, I could understand him getting mixed up, but it was not, and we were the only people sitting at the bar!\\n\\n-The daily specials board is mentioned on the menus and then hidden at the back of the entrance \\"nook\\" area, quite a way from the register. If you were going up as part of a line, it would be easy to miss it and then be forced to go back out of line to study the board before being able to order.\\n\\nIf you're at Easton and want to eat, Northstar is probably one of the better options, but be prepared to pay for the privilege."},{"name":"Hot Chicken Takeover","address":"59 Spruce St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4.5","text":"My wife and I have journeyed the country in search of great hot chicken.

Since Genji is two blocks away from home and it was closed on the long weekend when I tried to grab takeout, it was the easiest choice. \\n\\nThe boyfriend ordered a few rolls and said they were pretty decent, although the spicy tuna was way too spicy for his liking. I used to love spicy tuna rolls (or any spicy roll) but now I tend to stay away as I feel that the spice takes away the natural flavours of the fish, however I have tried genji's spicy tuna rolls a few times and I have to say, their spicy sauce is a lot stronger than other places. Much too overpowering. \\n\\nI ordered the temaki combo ($8.95) which consisted of dynamite, spicy tuna and spicy chopped scallop cones, but I asked for non spicy. I'm a huge fan as it's such a cheap meal and the three cones definitely fill me up. All three cones also are highly satisfying and taste pretty good. \\n\\nI typically like places that chop their scallop up more finely (that's just a personal preference) but Genji chops it way too fine and I could barely pick up the pieces with my chopstick so that's one part I didn't necessarily love. My 2 pieces of chopped scallop nigiri were really small and kind of disappointing for $2.25 each. The pieces were slightly thicker than maki rolls and the chopped scallop portion was minimal.

I hope some adjustments will be made with kind nudges and training so weekends/high volume times will go smoother in the future. Looking forward to bringing my fianc√© back to give them a second chance. :) \\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\n \\nIt took 45 mins to 1 hour for 2 Musubi. \\n\\nI don't want to hold my one bad experience at Musubi against them ,  but I brought my fiance in so he could have Musubi for the first time this Sunday (10/29) since I work nearby and have already had them plenty of times - but based on what he saw happening, he was smarter than me and opted not to order. (Though he essentially just suffered with me without any sort of snack reward, ah well!) \\n\\nThere was at least 4-5 small groups of people waiting (three groups of 3, a man waiting for a large order at the counter that I can remember) and I noticed the woman constructing the Musubis had at least 6 tickets in front of her. It took nearly 10 minutes for her co-worker to come and take our order (at least), there was no acknowledgement of us or the couple behind us waiting or the single man behind them. We all quietly waited, nonetheless. When he did come to the register, he didn't acknowledge how long the wait for my Musubi really would be (as we took my order out 45 mins+ later, he began telling folks ordering that the wait would be at least 30 minutes - I could tell the man who ordered after us, asking when his order was going to be done, was miffed by the wait).\\n\\nMusubi/Onigiri is supposed to be quick convenience food. It was really disappointing that it took SO LONG for everyone's orders to come out. The woman working was hustling relatively so, I noticed each group before us ordered about 6 Musubi each - so give or take 18-20 had to be made before I got my measly 2. \\n\\nBut the biggest problem I saw: Her co-worker wasn't making Musubi with her. She was completely alone in manning the line. I reckon he may have been new, didn't know how to make musubi yet, but it was pretty frustrating seeing a line of tickets 6-8 receipts deep and the woman constructing them sighing and moaning with each new order (goodness me, I do not blame her!) while he lackadaisically did dishes in the back or slowly wrapped up completed triangles. \\n\\nIt sucked. I was disappointed in myself for not declining him in taking my order and just getting a quick bite elsewhere because that's what I was there for, a quick bite while out running errands. Instead I waited 45-60 minutes for food that lasted 5 minutes with my ravenous self. I acknowledge that's part of my mistake yesterday. Maybe they're not this busy on Sundays typically? I'm certain in times before I've visited and seen both staff members making musubi/onigiri together so it's too bad when they were this busy, they couldn't tag team it. \\n\\nNonetheless, the exorbitant wait was admittedly really ridiculous. The amount of work one employee was stuck with was difficult to watch. Hopefully this is a one off storm of terrible, but if you walk in and see Musubi busy, one employee doing the grunt work of food prep, and you've got somewhere you need to be within the half hour - come back another time.\\n\\n(P.S. My fiance wouldn't take a bite to try my onigiri because the employee manning the register didn't necessarily put gloves on or wash his hands between the register and wrapping at the line - please don't do that :( )"},{"name":"Antonis Restaurant Diner","address":"10765 SW Canyon Rd","city":"Beaverton","stars":"3.5","text":"just stumbled upon this place yesterday.

I would suggest that you grab a menu while waiting in line because that seem to be the biggest hold up once we got inside. We ordered our food and went to find a table. Being a Sunday this was a bit more of a challenge especially since the ones that were available hadn't been bussed yet. People were actually having to sit at tables stacked with dirty dishes. Once we found a table it took a bit to get our drinks from the bar. I will say that the mimosas were very good, just a bit skimpy for the price. Once our food finally came it was average at best. Had it been warm, I'm guessing it would have been better. The burrito had little flavor and the eggs and bacon were nothing to write home about. The highlight of our meal was the fresh biscuit and blackberry preserves. Northstar got this part right for sure!!! Also, fair warning, when I ordered the side of fried potatoes there was no mention of peppers or hot spices so I was not able to eat them.

When the food came I was given a little salsa bowl with mostly honeydew and some cantaloupe and pineapples sprinkled in. When we asked a server (Drake) if there was anything bigger he said he would go get something. He tried his best to get me something bigger/better but when he asked for help from another server (Sam) he told him that there was absolutely nothing bigger and I'd just have to deal with that. So I asked for another side of fruit. Additionally, they ran out of lemonade so Sam gave us warm canned lemonade instead and when my parents complained he told them that it was free anyway and it's the same as it is from the machine.

SO, on grubHub i found this place called 3 country bistro with decent reviews and only a $2 delivery charge. not to mention it was in Woburn, the town over and only 2 miles away according to my iPhone GPS. \\"bingo,\\" i thought. holy hell was i wrong. first of all, I placed the order at 7, grubHub saying it would arrive at 7:45 (just to be safe, i'm sure). being cautious, i called up 3 country bistro to make sure they got my order and they said yes, my food would arrive in a half hour. 7:30 rolled around, and i thought to myself that i'd be patient and wait until 7:45. 7:45 rolled around, and still no food. ok, I thought, i'll give it another 10 minutes. at 8, I finally called asking where my food was. the lady on the phone said it was on the way. knowing that this place is basically next door, i knew my food would arrive shortly....however, the doorbell only rang at 8:25 with my meal. not only did this take an hour & 25 minutes to arrive, but the delivery lady proceeded to blame me! \\"you're too far away!\\" she said. well, i actually know that i'm not. maybe her GPS was wrong, but she was talking about how it took five miles for her to get to my house and they only deliver less than 4 miles away.  first of all, i'm positive the restaurant is only 2 miles away (i triple checked--modern technology) AND it obviously could deliver to my house if i found it using my address on grubHub to begin with. \\n\\nanyways, my food was quite the mixed bag. i ordered coconut-ginger soup, a 6-pc california roll, and a crazy maki roll. first of all, i was not provided with any chopsticks...that's weird for sushi delivery, no? i don't exactly have chopsticks laying around the house, so i had to eat with my hands and a fork. anyway,  the coconut soup was decent at first (i'm surprised it stayed warm) but then made my stomach hurt immediately afterwards. the california roll was the strangest thing i have seen in my life. it was NOT six pieces-- it was one piece! one giant piece rolled in thick seaweed in a kind of triangle shape and so difficult to eat because it wouldn't stick together. to leave on a positive note though, the crazy maki was pretty good. it was wrapped in seaweed as well, which i'm not a fan of (most makis i've ever ordered weren't wrapped in seaweed so i was confused), but nonetheless the ingredients inside were good. had my review been solely on the crazy maki, it would have gotten a 4.5. \\n\\nanyways, if you really want to check this place out, i'd actually go inside and not bother with delivery."},{"name":"Boston Lobster Feast","address":"8731 International Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3","text":"Big disappointment!

It's pretty good. Veggies so fresh-fresh-fresh.\\n\\nLee's Grilled pork sandwich\\nThis is what most people come to get and I think I prefer this one over their combo sandwich. But I still think the one from Quoc Huong (same location as Sweet Hut) was much more memorable.\\n\\nSpring Rolls $3.50\\n We got the kind with pork and shrimp. Eating this fresh was soooo delightful, and I was actually more impressed by this than the banh mi's! \\n\\nGrilled pork vermicelli bowl\\nIt's a cold dish so it's quite enjoyable during the warmer months. Very filling too.\\n\\nEgg rolls - not your average egg roll, very tasty\\n\\nLunch combo 1: Beef Noodle Soup (with rare steak, well-done flank, and brisket) & Half of Grilled Pork Sandwich - Banh Mi Thit Nuong\\nGreat lunch deal! Loved it! The broth was super flavorful and the meat was generously plentiful! Adding the plate of herbs, bean sprouts, and lime juice makes it even more flavorful.\\n\\nSunny Side Up Egg with Combo Sandwich - pork ham, fresh veggies, sunny side up egg, pork liver\\nThis dish came out not pre-made so we had to put the ingredients into the baguette. Don't be afraid to spread the pork liver into the sandwich; it's gonna taste great.\\n\\nLee's coffee - Vietnamese coffee with condensed milk, hot, small size\\nThis tasted very different from other coffees we've had and not even similar to the one at Le Fat. This was both bitter and sweet, and very thick in mouthfeel, but not exactly creamy either.\\n\\nThere's free parking right outside. You can order take out without having to sit down here. If you buy 5 banh mi sandwiches, the 6th one is free.\\n\\nUpdate: On another visit, we ordered somethings different from what we usually go there for since we were going there too repetitively to not give their other menu items a shot:\\n \\nFried rice with beef chunks - Com chien bo luc lac\\nand \\nPork & shrimp crepe - banh xeo\\n\\nFor the Fried rice with beef chunks, tt came with some lightly pickled julienned carrots and radish, the same kind found in banh mi, and some cucumber on a bed of fresh lettuce. Also came with a small bowl of soup, which we guessed is their pho broth. The beef was cooked to our liking - mostly tender, chewy (not in a bad way), no pieces were overcooked. The sauce was great, as expected from this dish, and we really liked it together with the fried rice. The rice was lightly flavored with just some chunks of beaten eggs stir fried in. The soup was salty but very addictive.\\n\\nFor the Pork & shrimp crepe, we weren't sure what to expect; we were just feeling adventurous. It came with fresh watercress, basil, and lettuce with a small bowl of fish sauce on the side. The outside was a slightly over-crisped crepe exterior, making it a little difficult to cut with the serrated knife they provided. The inside had a lot of bean sprouts and some shrimp; however, I didn't notice any pork?

Again, Hyatt is okay charging me an extra 15% on my bill because other \\"big\\" hotels do it?  \\n\\nAt this point I was kinda upset...  \\n\\nThink about this for a second how many people walk to Hyatt for a nights stay? They don't.  How many people are happy about finding a 15% tax/fee attached to their bill?  No one is.  So Hyatt knows they are going to effectively attach 10-15% onto each stay without telling the customer about it before hand. \\n\\nYou should be transparent with your customers and tell them what they are going to pay for before they book a room. \\n\\n$23 to park your car overnight when a person is staying at your hotel and eating in your building is ridiculous.  Hiding it until the end of the stay is Shameful.\\n\\nUpdate:  \\n\\nIt took about two months going through various employee's and supervisors, but the situation was eventually resolved.  Kind of a bummer that it took so much work to get this done, but it did get resolved.  I also think the reasonable people I spoke to, Melissa and Ryan, are going to bring about change so this fee is a little more transparent.

It was a Saturday and we had plenty of time before the Children's Theater performance.  We ordered a bone-in, a boneless, two kids meals and our sides were slaw, mac n cheese.  Slaw was bland and had no  zest or acid to it.  As if it were dressed in water.  The mac n cheese was mostly oil - very little cheese.  Not appealing to either of our M.C. loving kids, or to us.  My bone-in was tough and dry inside and almost pure oil on the outside, as if it hadn't been drained after frying, but just transferred directly to my bread.  You expect some grease, but this was sopping with oil.  Same for the boneless - dry and tough inside.  Not as oil-soaked as mine, but also not juicy or tender.

Seemed like such an appropriate place as we wanted to take her mom out this morning. As we arrived it was apparently obvious that it will be a long wait. I had my name put down and was told the wait was going to be about 45 minutes. This would give us enough time to walk around Saturday Market and come back ready for our brunch. \\n\\nUpon coming back from Saturday Market I noticed my restaurant pager never went off so I went to the front desk and asked about my name in the line and was told I was going to be next in line. We were seated almost immediately by the window on the east side of the building. Water was placed and we met our server who gave us some information on specials and what was and wasn't available. \\n\\nAfter we made our order, we talked for a little while and did some people watching. My girlfriends mom noticed that her glass from her water had a chip in it and asked the server to replace it. It was probably a good ten minutes before I was able to hail a bus person to get another glass of water and after 3 tries he was able to finally find a glass that was neither chipped or cracked. The server finally brings our drinks over which consisted of a Tom Collins and two Mango Mojitos. The Mojitos were great! It was not overpowering with major mango flavor but just a good hint that seem to accentuate the drink rather well. As for the Tom Collins my girlfriend's mom seemed to enjoy it. Personally, I'll pass. \\n\\nThe wait was pretty long but we finally received our orders. I ordered the Omelet Dujour, my girlfriend, the Salmon Hash, and my girlfriend's mom the Stuffed Frittata. \\n\\nThe Salmon Hash consists of Wild Salmon, Leeks, Potatoes, and cream served with two eggs any style and wheat toast. This in my opinion was the best dish out of the three we had. The salmon works great together with the cream and grilled potatoes. Will have to try it on my next trip.\\n\\nThe Omelet Dujour this week was basically a meat lover's omelet. I would not recommend it. It was really dry and I'm not a big fan of a thick omelet with the filling inside. The one thing that I was extremely impressed by was the fact there was not a single burn mark on the omelet itself. Definitely a good sign they use great kitchen equipment and a very meticulous chef as well. I asked the server if we could get some salsa to add on to it and explained what happened and she quickly came back with the salsa and even comped us for it without even asking for it. Extremely nice of her considering I did finish off the meal. The potatoes that came with the meal were very dry and I'm not sure how they were prepared but I wasn't a fan of them. \\n\\nThe stuffed frittata looked great but I'm not a fan of them so I kind of stayed away from it after a few offers for a bite of it. I know my girlfriend and her mom loved it so I'll just assume it was pretty good. \\n\\nOverall, its not a bad place at all. Would like to come back again soon and try something else. In my opinion for now I think you're really paying for the hype and the fact that your at a \\"it\\" kind of place. I think when you have this long wait the anticipation for this great meal raises your personal bar and you tend to let yourself down more as a result of it. I would definitely suggest taking that time you wait by heading over to Saturday market or maybe some other retail stores so forget that you had a long wait. Had I waited at the restaurant I would of definitely had been more irritated by the wait. \\n\\nHappy Eating Everyone!"},{"name":"Pip's Original Doughnuts & Chai","address":"4759 NE Fremont St, Ste C","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"You cannot go to Portland and not try Pips.

Since the food is great and it felt like the inconvenience was recognized, we kept coming back even though there was a constant frustration with timing. This time, after waiting 35 minutes past the reservation before being properly seated, we inquired why the issue with the long wait time past reservations was so prevalent. The general manager blamed people who linger at tables too long, and mentioned how this problem is an every day thing since patrons often stay past their welcome, not the fact the restaurant does not allocate enough time for people to eat during their reservations (this being an every day issue.) When we pressed as to why this overbooking has not been addressed by the restaurant, we were met again with blame placed on the patrons instead of the restaurant recognizing their lack of ability to properly manage their operations.

Always eager to put something delicious in my mouth (and hope that it will still respect me in the morning) I drove down to Memorial Drive. \\n\\nThis location is much larger inside than it appears. PLENTY of seats to rest your bottom while servers tend to the dining room dressed in black and white sporting bow ties and aprons. They greet you with the kind of enthusiastic smiles than make you smile back. The manager on duty was the first to take my order from behind the cafeteria-style line. A dapper gentleman who sported a pink tie and glistening personality. So much goodness on display I had a hard time making up my mind until he suggested the two meat lunch special with two sides.\\n\\n------------ - - - - - -\\n\\nTHE FOOD\\nI haven't been to This Is It in nearly 14 years. Back in those days there was only one location and I can't say there was anything special about the food. Today however, they rocked my world. I came for the ribs (which were terrible), but ordered catfish fillets as a second meat.\\n\\nThe CATFISH was PERFECTLY cooked and seasoned. I couldn't stop eating even though it was blazing hot and burning the ceiling of my mouth. The only downside is the long wait since this item is cooked to order. (NOTE: Don't order the WHOLE catfish. It's awful. Thankfully they replace it with another filet.)\\n\\nI chose dirty rice smothered with oxtail gravy and green beans for my sides. The combination of flavors from the sides and the catfish did a River Dance on my taste buds that was very, very satisfying. \\n\\n\\nC H I T T E R L I N G S * * * * *\\nEvery now and then I get in a mood to try something different. An urge rised up in me to have something out of my normal rotation of flavors and the chitterlings here were whispering my name. Since I was a child I have been repulsed by the thought and smell of this African American delicacy. When my mother used to make them it would STANK up the whole house. My father would cover the doorway of the kitchen with thick blankets and still that dang smell penetrated through. He hated them so much he would leave for hours until the smell was gone! LOL\\n\\nHowever, after years of turning my nose up at my mothers request to try them, I finally did in my 20's. I strangely acquired a taste for them as an adult and, until today,  my mothers 'chitlins' are the only ones I've ever eaten. Let me tell you, it's difficult to believe something so absolutely gross in nature can taste this good, but they do. \\n\\nThis marks maybe the 9th time I've ever eaten them (I have to be in the right mood). If you can get past what they are and even the slight off-putting smell, you are in for a real treat. I can't wait to bring mom here when she visits next month.\\n\\n------------ - - - - - -\\n \\nTHE VERDICT\\nI had an absolutely delicious meal that I will be thinking about for weeks to come. \\n\\nIf you are keeping score, the food ranks as follows:\\nFried Catfish Filets - 5+ out of 5\\nBBQ Pork Spare Ribs - 2/5 (and that's being generous)\\nDirty rice w/oxtail gravy - 4/5\\nGreen beans - 5/5\\nChitterlings - 5/5\\n\\nService - slow due to the catfish, but very friendly\\nParking - adequate \\nPrice - reasonable (except for the chitterlings)."},{"name":"Black Angus Steakhouse","address":"7516 W Irlo Bronson Memorial Hwy","city":"Kissimmee","stars":"3.5","text":"This place has potential I think the steaks might have made it a 4 star but we chose to pick menu choices.
