We were finally seated, but no offer of anything to compensate us for the inconvenience of having to wait for more than 20 minutes. \\nAs far as the meal was concerned,  it was a big disappointment,  especially for the price.

I make the decision to order the tamales. I order the plate with rice and black beans. When the food is brought to me I was terrified to try it. The rice was still hard with no flavor. Black beans didn't even have salt as a flavor. The tamales were all masa and a whisper of meat. I couldn't stomach this poor excuse of mexican food.

Moved to Bastrop in summer 2009, which is the closest I've lived to Austin in 4 years.  I visited Austin pretty regularly in the meantime, so was caught up with most of my Austin favorites, but somehow my very favorite, Magnolia, mostly fell through the cracks.  So when we went yesterday, my husband and I hadn't been for a year or two.  I'm happy to say that it didn't disappoint.  \\n\\nMy husband and I had been in Austin for most of the day, and were planning on eating dinner at home in Bastrop,  but at 5pm realized that we were actually kind of hungry.  The problem was that I wanted good beans and he wanted a healthy plate of vegetables.  Magnolia met both of the criteria, so we headed there.  \\n\\nWe had a short (5 minutes or so) wait for seating, no big deal.  We each ordered water to drink after deciding that people with colds don't really need to drink beer with their dinners.  He ordered the LOVE veggie plate, and I ordered the bacon-swiss burger (with avocado added) with black beans instead of one of the usual sides.  \\n\\nOur food came out pretty quickly and it was all pretty awesome.  My husband's plate had a nice variety of garlic-y veggies and some good brown rice which was the perfect texture (nicely chewy but not crunchy or watery).  He was nice enough to let me try some of his broccoli, squash, spinach, etc., and it was anything but tasteless.  My burger was good ... I'd wondered why I wasn't asked about how I wanted it cooked, but maybe that was because it was a rather thin patty (thinner than I remembered getting in past years) so was prettymuch going to be either done or not done. Still decently juicy though for a thin patty.  Toppings were good, plenty of tomatoes and pickles (I leave off the lettuce and red onion, but they looked good and fresh too) and so much avocado that I gave my husband some of it.  My beans were amazing.  Yes, they were just black beans, most likely with taco seasoning added, with a little grated cheese sprinkled on top, but they were just what I wanted and I ate every bit of them.  The waiter was happy to bring me some extra mayo and extra napkins.  \\n\\nDessert sounded good, but we'd decided to try out Sugar Mama's cupcakes while we were in the neighborhood, so we asked for our check.  It was around $18!  So glad that Magnolia is still good and still cheap!  When we left I literally felt a pervasive sense of wellbeing, comparable to the feeling I have after a good yoga class.\\n\\nMagnolia, we'll definitely be back!  Maybe you'll remain my favorite place to eat in Austin after all! \\n\\n(5th star hopefully reserved for my reunion with the Mag Mud, thank you!)"},{"name":"Pine State Biscuits","address":"2204 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"I have relatives who love Pine State's over-the-top options, tossing everything possible into a biscuit.

I've never had such great food at such reasonable prices. The Korean Fried Chicken is amazing. Alder prepares it with the perfect amount of crisp on the outside while keeping the meat very tender. The sauce is combination of sweet and savory with just enough spice to tantalize your taste buds. As a person who is always hungry, I found the portion sizes to be pretty generous.\\n\\nThe chocolate potato doughnuts are also a must order. The dough itself isn't sweet but the outside is lightly coated in a sugar.  As a person who appreciates doughnuts that aren't super sweet, I really enjoyed the dish! My only regret was not ordering more.\\n\\nFinally, the potatoes bravas are a great complement to any dish that you order. With hints of an Asia spice, these potatoes are lightly fried and served with over easy eggs. My parents and I only ordered a half order but the waitress decided to upgrade it to a full - free of charge! \\n\\nTaste N' Alder is a restaurant whose delicious dishes are matched by its spectacular service.

I just wish I knew what they were trying to be. I think they know what they want to be, but they don't know how to execute. We went on a Friday evening and as expected they were busy. They appear to have a nice adults only bar area downstairs with games and TV's, etc. upstairs they appear to be trying to be a family friendly sports pub. The only problem is they have just one huge projection screen for TV, and a small TV in the opposite corner of the bar area. In the main dining area, nothing. So if you want to watch the game with the family, head to Buffalo Wild Wings or Red Robin. At least they have TV's scattered throughout the dining area. \\n\\nService was beyond slow. We were seated and didn't see our server for a good 10 minutes. When he did come we were ready with drink and food orders, but were told by him that he prefers to take drink orders, then come back for food orders. If we weren't all so hungry, with our hungry 2 year old, that wouldn't have bothered our party so much. But he didn't come for our food order for another 10 minutes. Now I know people tend to exaggerate times, but we kept looking at the time on our phones.\\n\\nAt one point our server tried the excuse that they were way busier than they expected to be... I wanted to ask him why they expected to be slow on a Friday? Add in its the week before Christmas and most people are probably like us: I just did shopping and a Santa visit. I don't want to cook tonight.\\n\\nThe young man serving us was nice enough, but our food took an eternity. 25-30 minutes is a pretty fair estimate. When our food did arrive on of our orders was incorrect, and the food and as cold. I had their Friday/Saturday only meat loaf. Had it been hot it probably would have been good. Burgers were pretty sub par like others have mentioned here before. \\n\\nPerhaps the most aggravating part of our whole experience in was not being offered another drink at all until after we were done eating. That pretty much capped our experience. I hate to say it, but we won't be back any time soon. Poor service, bad atmosphere, and poor food quality.

That was for brunch and I was paying for my own meal.  The menu seemed strange and half the dishes were huge portions and half were too small so I remember leaving a good amount of my over-priced brunch on the plate.  And the brunch-tails didn't blow me away or anything.  \\n\\nSecond experience: business lunch, me not paying, unless you count awkward corporate lunches where you don't really know the people sitting next to you and are having a hard time making conversation as some kind of payment/penance.   \\n\\nSo, to start, I don't really like the chips; they are the thick, hard, greasy corn chips.  But when one is waiting a really long time for one's food to come and having a hard time making conversation with one's lunch mates, one will tend to eat lots of chips.  They began to grow on me the longer we waited.  Which really wasn't that long, considering we had a really large party so, kudos to the kitchen staff.   The salsa is pale yellow and while it seems like it would be related to the evil pale green salsa, it is actually more akin to regular salsa that has some pale yellow viscous ingredient cutting the spicy level down to half or less.  More salsa = more chip eating.\\n\\nI ordered the Shrimp Relleno which was served with polenta, corn, queso blanco, topped with ancho crema.  The entr√©e came with rice and beans, but I remembered from my brunch foray that they did not have Tex-Mex style Spanish rice, but some other rice that is not made with spices and tomato paste and I didn't really care for it, although, it looked nice on someone's plate, so I may need to give it another shot.  Since my dish had polenta in it (?) I figured I should sub my rice for grilled veggies.  They probably charged extra for it, but even if I was paying, it would have been worthwhile.  I got the refried black beans as my second side. \\n\\nMy plate arrived and it looked beautiful, although, a little light on the shrimp; there were four pretty shrimpy shrimps on there (maybe 40/50s?).   But I guess it was lunch portions and, although they were small, and few, they were fresh and flavorful and cooked perfectly (five stars right there).  The relleno had a greenish (spinach?) polenta cake in the bottom with a blend of corn and other diced veggies, and queso blanco mixed in and the Ancho cream on top.  The flavors were surprisingly good, balanced, and complex, with just the very mild heat from the ancho cream.\\n\\nThe grilled veggies were a mixed of zucchini and squash and bell pepper, grilled on the same spot they had probably grilled some fajitas, so they tasted really good, like steak.  Highly recommend.  I also really liked the refried black beans, because if you're going to eat beans, they might as well be fried, right?  [insert pity chuckle here]\\n\\nThe surprising stand out was the corn tortillas though.  When the waiter put them down next to my plate I thought \\"Oh, great, glad you didn't forget those.\\"  I'm a half-Mexican girl from South Texas, and my 'uela never made us corn tortillas so this is a lifelong preference for flour tortillas I'm dealing with here.  And, I am almost certain the corn tortillas at Garrido's are those half corn half/flour ones (aw, they're halfies, like me!).  They were way too soft and pliable and smooth to be regular corn tortillas, right?  Again, I need to do some more field research.  Also need to research their cr√®me brulee and bread pudding in a less socially awkward situation..."},{"name":"Lovely's Fifty Fifty","address":"4039 Mississippi Ave N, Ste 101","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"You will definitely get RICH w/o having to die tryin', up here in this Fitty-fitty.\\n\\nBetween the Italian-styled pizza pie and the home-made ice-cream, you'll be channeling Dave Chapelle way more than Fitty Centy:  \\"I'M RIIIIICH, BEEEYOOOOTCCCHHH!\\"\\n\\nThere were so many Italian ingredient possibilities on the pies here, I needed a farmer's almanac and Google translator to navigate the menu (Spigarello?

The Buttermilk Nectarine I tried completely on the strength of the innovation factor: I found it rich and sweet and vague and fluffy. Not the stuff of legendary ice cream, sorry. The nice and very sweet lady at the counter said her favorite was the cantaloupe ice cream, so I felt obliged to try that, as well. I did like like the cantaloupe, and was very glad it didn't have the overpowering sweetness.

I would normally say that it's pretty hard to mess up ceviche and salad but some of the restaurants I've been to...   \\n\\nCute place-I really liked the fact that the portions are adequate but not overly generous. Allow me to explain.  For some damn reason, I always seem to like what is offered as an appetizer rather than an entree.  Far too often, I go to one of these trendy, chic little places and they serve you a sliver of food (restaurants in Uptown Dallas, I'm looking at you).  I'm not one to have a big meal, especially in the evening when I know I'll be going out (drinking) and this place was perfect.  No froufrou little doubloon of food but thankfully no family-sized monster portions either.  I say \\"monster\\" because I was traumatized as a young child by a trip to Golden Corral (an old lady was putting steaks and creamed spinach in her purse!).  But I digress...\\n\\nAs far a cuisine goes, I'd have to say that it's more authentic than Tex-Mex.  I went with some friends,  one of whom happens to be an \\"authentic\\" Mexican, so I feel my description is fairly accurate.\\n\\nBy the way, some of the reviews I've read on here are really harsh.

The place is very small so it stays quite. The decorating is very nice. They have a front area by the a fireplace that where you can gather while you wait for your table, which is exceptionally well done.\\n\\nThe wait staff is great and is knowledgeable about the menu. When we ate there late Jason Bond, the chef, came out to talk to us. Everyone is extremely friendly and welcoming.\\n\\nThe Food:\\nThe food at Bondir is all very original and mostly very good. They offer almost everything on the menu in either a half or full portion, where a half is about an appetizer size. Both times I have gone we have order half portions of the entire menu and shared it among the table. They seem to encourage dining like this which is fine with me because I like to try lots of different things.\\n\\nThe scallops and chicken were my favorite things both times I went. All of the dishes were very original and many have odd combination of tastes.

But the ones with the meat had an excellent flavor and smokiness to them. Next the Bolitas de Yuca: Bacon garlic cassava fritters with cilantro aioli - these in my opinion were just fried mashed potato balls. I did not taste any bacon, nor garlic..

The food - Yatai serves Japanese style street food, and it is served hot, fresh and delicious.  Indeed, Yatai is refreshingly free of the ramen quality control problems (a.k.a. \\"The Qurse of Qi\\") that marred the Guadalupe East Side King experience.  Diners need no longer fret over whether they'll be receiving a sublime hot toddy of umami and salty flavors, or a lukewarm bowl of something tasting of nothing so much as cup o' noodles cooked in bongwater.  Whatever Yatai's serving that day (more on this below) is consistently yummy.\\n\\nAs I am neither Japanese nor have I travelled to Japan, my hairy-gaijin take on the authenticity and relative quality of the food should be taken with, if not a grain of salt, then at least a drop of soy sauce.  That said, the food at Yatai evokes the flavors and quality of much pricier Izakaya-style restaurants in larger cities.  I'm especially fond of the Kushiyaki - the grilled meat skewers, all of which I can unequivocally recommend.\\n\\n2.  The prices - Given the quality of the food, the prices are excellent.  Yatai offers Uchiko flavor for Chipotle coin.\\n\\nThe-Not-Quite-There-Yet:\\n\\n1.  The Space - the murals on the wall are nice, but there's still work to be done on the inside - starting with the tables, of which at least three are shaky enough to cause spillage of food or drink.  Seriously, I don't have enough pairs of teriyaki-sauce colored pants to eat here as often as I'd like and still overlook the table wobble issues.\\n\\n2.  Food availability - Call me old fashioned, but I've always thought of menus as listings of food available for sale, not the opening move in some sort of abstractly kinky game of tease and denial. (i.e., \\"You want asparagus tempura?  Well, you can't have asparagus tempura, you naughty, naughty boy!\\")  Every time I've been there, I've been told that at least one menu item isn't available that day.  While this is mitigated somewhat by the consistent excellence of whatever's on sale, at some level, one still can't help but think, \\"the menu says ramen, I'm desperately craving ramen, why don't you have any $%^ing ramen today?\\"\\n\\n3.  Drinks - Yatai's food deserves a better companion than the canned soda  available during the current \\"soft opening\\" phase.  A nice cold can of Hitachino would only enhance the dining experience.\\n\\nBottom line:\\n\\nAll in, a very promising beginning - just fix the tables, serve up the full menu, and get me a cold one.

That being said, Garbo's is one of the better options I've had down south. I love that they don't shred up the meat, they leave it in big yummy chunks. We got the one dressed with mayo and the one simply with lemon and butter. Of the two, I thought both were great but I am a purist and the simple butter sauce won me over. The bun was REALLY perfect! We didn't have to wait at all and the service was so friendly. Two rolls, a side of fries, and two waters came to $55. Wow. I understand the ingredients are expensive but holy cow.

There was more than enough for two people, even though the portion of chutney it came with was teeny. For dinner, my boyfriend had the meatloaf, which he deemed \\"amazing.\\" His dish came with a heaping pile of gorgeous, gigantic steamed broccoli crowns.

The lineup has been reached to the door. 20 of us had to stand outside to wait. Unit 8:30 pm, we finally gotta into the restaurant. Inside the restaurant, it's not very big at all, Tables and Chairs were too close to each other. Modern interior design. Inside restaurant is nice and clean.\\n\\nService\\n\\nThere are no many servers working in the restaurant. For our table, we only had one table server who began to bring the water after we all sat down. Then he took orders for our drinks. After that, he began to take food orders from us. The only person serves the whole table of 20 people. That's very multitasking. He was a hard worker and did a very great job. He was Friendly and Fast.   I think Earls really need to hire more servers working on Friday night.\\n\\nFood\\n\\nEveryone has done their ordering around 8:50 pm. Because it's Friday night and lots of people, our food came out of the kitchen late. We had few starters, such as chicken wings, Spanish bread, and calamari to share during our waiting time, which was great. After 1 hour waiting, our food finally came out of the kitchen. We all had different types of food. They look all very fancy and delicious. I have ordered AHI Tuna Poke Bowl, which made by Jasmine rice, soy marinated ahi tuna, avocado, nori, mango, macadamia nuts. The sauce was very tasty. Tuna was fresh. For this dish, macadamia nuts were unique. I am not a big nuts fan, but I love macadamia in this dish.\\n\\nPrice\\n\\nThe price of my poke bowl is around $16.75, which is not bad. It seems the cheapest dish in Earls besides those small starters.\\n\\nIn summary, food quality in Earls was awesome and tasty. The price of the food is OK. I wish to try something else at this place next time. Highly recommend people to make a reservation early."},{"name":"Luke's Lobster Back Bay","address":"75 Exeter Street","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Absolutely phantastic and authentic (for a city place - all they are missing is a real shack and beach) - from a native new englander!

Great Greek dishes (the best gyros you'll ever have, wonderful Greek salads, baklava, etc.)  My favorite thing to eat there, by far, are their pizzas.

Every other pizza PALES in comparison.  \\n\\nLove this place.  I've gone from eating there as a starry eyed teenager, to a middle aged woman going back with my husband and our 2 (almost grown) kids.

The other server very rudely lied and said that others tickets were in front of ours--they were both folding silverware when I walked up.  Then, to top it off, our server also lied about the tickets and left the check.  I had to get up and ask the woman who scoops ice cream--who was very helpful- to refill our water carafe.

Let's look at this restaurant and you can choose which it is \\n\\nWhen you first walk in it smells heavily of fish since the kitchen is right by where you wait to be seated. (perhaps next to the cooler also)   The waitress tries to detour you by saying \\"there's a twenty minute wait to sit\\" (which got quite a few people after me and my dinning companion to leave. They then tell you how nice the bar is and how you should get a drink. ($8 for a well whiskey up to $15 for a cheep wine) \\n\\nWhen we were seated (exactly 20 minutes later) we passed 3 empty tables on the way back.  The lighting was that that if your eyes hadn't adjusted you could fall. Thankfully they have gaudy signs attached to the end of the table stating \\"step down\\" in large enough letters I could read it at the end of the eisle. \\n\\nWe waited about 10 minutes before seeing a menu then were rushed to order. Stupidly I gave into the peer pressure and ordered a appetizer chicken strips and fries thinking it would be a fancy restaurant it will be done nicely.  \\nWe had finished the appetizer before she came back wanting our dinner order  (we had been there about 40 minutes total) \\nOnce dinner came she went on and on about how this item was so delicious so my companion tried it. \\n\\nFood: Chiken strips were basically any old piece of chicken thrown in a batter twisted in strange shapes (I'm sure not on purpose) I've had better from a frozen food case. \\nFries (in basket ) were a oily mess stuck together in a giant glob. \\n\\nMac n cheese: I thought it tasted a bit off. There was a lot of crunch on top I thought might be parmisian that was too close to the oven. After I got home and looked at it. It's chunks of garlic and something else.  The garlic taste was so overwhelming I couldn't eat nearly half of it.  If you reheat it even 30 seconds you will end up with a pool of grease on your plate. And the garlic is even stronger today. \\n\\nAppearance: I've never known children (6-9 age) to be brought to a place like this let alone running up and down the rows.  I believe the point of the low lighting was so you felt like you were alone with your date. The loud people apparently celebrating a birthday next to us (they tried singing happy birthday and it fizzled out as they realized no one in the restaurant wanted to hear them let alone join in )   \\n\\nSummary: for $70 you can go to a much classier place without kids running up the eisles and actual editable food. \\n\\nPs buy tums or Pepcid before you go.

Check the pics for the printed specials which may vary slightly from the list included below.\\n\\nThe Happy Hour specials are available in the inside and outside bar area. It was pretty hot and muggy on the Saturday we visited, so we opted for the AC. Bar service inside at the tables was friendly and prompt. Drinks were made well, The Margarita was good but the Cosmo is especially tasty, not too fruit juicy and yet, not too vodka heavy for those who are not straight martini drinkers. Standard bottle beer options, decent wine selection on their regular menu, \\"Meh\\" wines on the Happy Hour menu.\\n\\nDrinks in hand, our table ordered the Calamari, spicy tuna roll, potato chips and popcorn shrimp as apps. Impressive portions, all were tasty and prepped very well. The Tuna Roll had a very nice portion of Ahi tuna, but was missing the \\"spicy\\" aspect. Calamari app also had fried Jalapenos, lemon slices and artichoke hearts mixed in with the squid rings and squidlettes. Not greasy, calamari was not chewy and we enjoyed the frito misto additions. House made potato chips were a nice thickness, not greasy and came sprinkled with some bland parm which could be skipped. The Blue cheese fondue had nice flavor, but was crowd friendly and not over the top blue cheese. The popcorn shrimp were not heavily fried and a substantial size for \\"popcorn\\" shrimp. \\n\\nThe menu I had seen online, offered the raw and grilled oysters in the happy hour deal. I inquired about them and was told they were still available, so we ordered the 1/2 doz grilled oysters. Cooked well, very nice size and we would order again. However, when we got the bill, they were full price...not happy hour price. The specials tent on the table had listed just the raw oysters in the happy hour, which is why I asked about the grilled-- and shame on me for not being a bit more clear in my inquiry.(apparently) Minus 1/2 star on the rating, since everything else ordered at the table was a happy hour special and nothing further was done to ensure a happy customer. We didn't feel like making a big issue of it.\\n\\nBurgers and fish tacos were ordered, my fish tacos were great and I'd order them again. Disappointingly, none of the 3 burgers ordered were cooked to the proper temp- medium rare burgers were delivered medium to medium well. A discussion with the server (bartender) had been had prior to the ordering, and it was suggested to order Med rare...glad the table didn't go with the medium or things would have been very overdone. Even though the burgers were overdone for the group, they were good tasting and still juicy. Each diner said the burgers probably would have been \\"great\\" had they been cooked properly. (Minus 1/2 star) Fries were nothing special. Had we paid full price, those burgers would have gone back.\\n\\nAll and all, great happy hour drinks and food quality and selection for the prices. ($6 per item, aside from the, ehm, ordered grilled oysters.) Very nice that Happy Hour is offered on the weekends.

Let me start by saying I love the visual assault of the colors and the feeling of a New Orleans experience in the restaurant.  We were seated promptly (15 minute wait @ 7pm on a Saturday night is not bad).  The wife and I agree that service was actually very good.  The appetizer maws fries is OMG delicious with the debris (roast beef pieces) infusing with the cheese and gravy.  If we had stopped right there it would have been five stars and the maws fries was actually enough to fill me and the wife.  The problem is the main course.  I had their daily special, the catfish and grits.  The fish is a fried fillet over grits that should have sausage in it.  The catfish, I believe, was prepared incorrectly and the taste was off the chart fishy, just like when someone incorrectly prepares catfish.  It was fishier than trout the way it was prepared, which is not like at all the way that tastes in New Orleans (we were just there in August).  My wife thought the fish maybe had turned but I'm pretty sure it was preparation.  The grits has pretty much no (I found one tiny, barely noticeable piece of sausage (in New Orleans there would be slices running through the grits).  The wife was so glad she decided against ordering the catfish herself.  The wife had the jambalaya, crawfish pie, and gumbo combo.  I did not taste her food other than her jambalaya DID have some sausage in it, thank goodness, and she put it in my grits to make it better.  She did say thought that the food (I think the jambalaya she was referring to in particularly) tasted like it was store bought (came from a box), not homemade.  Now maybe we got the wrong entrees and we are willing to come back some time and try some other items.  I just have to think, the way this place is reviewed and the as busy as it is, that maybe we got the couple of dishes that were not so good?

Last week, I get a letter in the mail from Nonnis saying that they will put their pizza to the test by offering a meal deal with pizza, boneless wings and breadsticks and free delivery.  \\n\\nLast night, I figured we take them up on the offer. Called in and placed the order. Person on the line gave me a total and said it would be able 30 minutes.\\n\\n50 minutes later, I get my food. \\n\\nBoneless wings - I choose the buffalo sauce.  The taste was typical buffalo sauce, but the wings were oven baked versus deep fried. \\n\\nBreadsticks - pretty good. I usually don't get breadsticks because they are just pizza dough without the sauce and cheese.  I choose the cheesy garlic bread. Not very cheesy, but it's garlicky. Next time I will try the sweet cinnamon kind. If you order online, they give you an order of breadsticks for free with every large pizza!\\n\\nPizza - I have to admit that their dough, cheese and sauce were pretty good. The dough was a bit chewier that I would have liked, but the cheese was very good.  Also, the cold leftover pizza held up pretty nicely this morning for breakfast!\\n\\nBottom line, I'm a convert.  I like Nonni's Pizza more than Pisa Pizza of Malden, especially the day after."},{"name":"Narcoossee's","address":"4401 Grand","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Narcoosee's has the best food I've had at a Disney property.

I have to say Bistec filled me up pretty quickly and I don't even need an entree. It was definitely one of the best tapas I've ever tried. The steak was perfectly grilled on the outside, medium rare and tender on the inside. I hope this dish gets transferred to their permanent menu because it's really good!\\n\\nThe reason why am I not giving a 5 star: If you're an impatient person or you come really hungry, just go for the variety of tapas they have to offer. My friends who ordered paella had to wait for 45 minutes for theirs to come (it was on a crowded Friday night). Their complimentary restaurant bread was a miss too, since it was pretty cold and hard. \\n\\nOther than that, this restaurant is awesome! My friends love their paella and scallop dish. I ended my night with a dessert called Tarta de Queso - an pistachio cheesecake and it was soooo good! Totally recommend that too!"},{"name":"Pine State Biscuits","address":"2204 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Great service, biscuits are so soft and buttery, perfect crisp on the chicken and excellent hush puppies."},{"name":"Italian Kitchen","address":"860 Burrard St","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Best calamari in the world.

The ambiance, food, level of service, and experience are excellent.\\n\\nMy dear friend and I had brunch one Sunday to catch up and Italian Kitchen was our first choice. I had passed by this restaurant several times and have always been curious, so when I suggested it to her she agreed. Plus, around last summer or 2 summers ago, I saw a really hot server working on the patio of Italian Kitchen. The chances of me seeing the same server working when we came in was small, but I could dream :)\\n\\nBefore I comment on the food, let me just start by saying that I really like the layout of the kitchen. Everything is just out in the open for everyone to see, with the prep work and cooking done behind the bar. The cooks can interact with guests, which makes the experience more personal. I think a minor disadvantage to this is we ended up smelling like the food they were cooking. Not a big deal.\\n\\nMy friend and I wanted a sweet alcoholic drink but didn't know what to get, so our kind server offered to create something for us. He returned with 2 martini glasses with a bubbly pink concoction, which was fruity and delicious. Perfect for a Sunday brunch.\\n\\nWe ended up ordering the Breakfast Pizza and the Pappardelle Lamb Sausage. We ordered the Breakfast Pizza because it was such a curious item, not knowing it would be one the best decisions we've ever made in our lives. The eggs and bacon were divine, and the potatoes filled us up quite nicely. Best part? The burrata. Made the dish so creamy and added a nice texture to the dish. Love it.\\n\\nThe Pappardelle was also good, but I liked the Breakfast Pizza better. The lamb sausage was quite spicy, but not too spicy. The cabbage added an interesting layer or texture to the dish, which I think I could've gone without. But it was fine with it. I think I just preferred the Breakfast Pizza.\\n\\nI always love seeing the washrooms of a restaurant too, to see if they maintain it for the guests. What I didn't like about the washroom is the fact that only one person can use it at any given time. Probs won't be good on a busy evening. However what it lacked in size made up for it in decor. It felt like it was my private washroom as I was the only 1 in there, and the decor was classy. \\n\\nEnough washroom chat, I'm sure you probs don't care.\\n\\nOverall this was a pleasant dining experience. I would definitely come back and try the Lunch, Dinner, and Dessert menu."},{"name":"Flour Bakery + Caf√©","address":"131 Clarendon St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Always good.

They don't use the traditional powder + water + sugar combination but instead add a little pezzaz to the recipe.\\n\\nI actually asked them about it and saw it for myself. They add a touch of ice-cream and actual fruit (ie: granny apple for the green apple boba tea) which intensifies the flavors. It's surprisingly refreshing and I really wish that their large size was bigger.\\n\\nThere's a few down sides to their business though. Their prices aren't cheap and their hours aren't that great either. They are closed on Sundays which really sucks but make up for some of it by offering a selection of Vietnamese foods such as these subs known as (Bahn Mi) and a bunch of other pastries.\\n\\nSo far I've tried many flavors and also tried their rainbow jello cubes which neither I nor my girlfriend liked; we were happy to try though.\\n\\nSo if you want a nice bubble tea, this is the place to go.

So near the top of my list of things to do was find a good BBQ joint.  I was raised in Kansas City, and lived several years in Texas so I'm always a little skeptical when it comes to finding good Q in a region not known for it.  For my first visit to an unknown BBQ joint, I always order a brisket sandwich.  I can get a pretty good take on how authentic a place is by the brisket.  So I made the trek from Dorchester to Davis Square based on the reviews of this place.\\nI was there on a Saturday afternoon, so it wasn't very busy.  The waiter provided excellent service.  I ordered the Brisket Sandwich platter which comes with a side of potato salad and beans.  Cornbread & butter was brought to my table shortly after I ordered.  I didn't try it, preferring to wait until my plate was served.\\nWhen it arrived, the sandwich was open faced, topped with coleslaw, pickles and raw onions.  It looked really good.  I took one bite and let me tell you, that was good brisket.  Smokey, not dry, with just the right amount of lean-to-fat ratio.  I chose the hot BBQ sauce, which was perfect.  The potato salad and beans were served in the same bowl, which seemed odd, and the beans were black beans, not what I expected.  But the beans were excellent.  The potato salad was excellent, no bits of undercooked potato, just the right seasoning.  When I got to the cornbread, it was a perfect square of dense flavorful \\"just like mama's\\" cornbread.  So, I left happy, and really delighted that my first foray into Boston BBQ was a huge success.  Life in Boston is going to be good.

The food was good - we ordered a bunch of appetizers (the scallops, beef tartare, heirloom tomatoes) - the scallops were AMAZING, and the drinks were outstanding (best Peach Bellini I've had, better than the one at Stella).  I had the brick chicken, which was good, but not as good as Via Matta. \\n\\nNow, the food was good, so why am I only giving it 3 stars?  One of my friends and I arrived earlier than our group - we didn't have a reservation, but upon review, the restaurant was half empty.  So we ask the hostess nicely if we can get a table for 5 - she tells us she's sorry, but she won't be able to seat us until 9pm, and not until the whole party is there.  It's 7:45 at this point, and some of our group is not there, and even though there are obviously tables available, we don't press - we go to Clink for a beverage to wait for the rest of our group.  We get a call around 8 from the other members of our party - they're happily seated on the patio at Scampo.  I'm not one who usually has gender issues with hostesses (actually, I've never had them) - but our male friend spoke to the hostess and she seated the group right away, without the whole party there (which the hostess would not do for my friend and I).\\n\\nThe last issue, and I don't know if this was intentional or not, but I know these things happen at restaurants - the total bill for what ended up to be 6 of us was $300 - no gratuity added.  We gave the waiter (who was very nice) the 6 cards and asked him to split the bill.  He came back with 6 checks for $91 each.  I'd had a couple of drinks but I know that $300 divided by 6 is not $91.  We called him back over, asked if gratuity had been added, he said no, we said, \\"the total bill was $300 - how are our 6 bills $91 each?\\"  He apologized for the \\"math error\\" and re-ran our checks, assuring us that we would only be charged once for the correct amount.\\n\\nThose two things left a slightly less than good taste in my mouth - I don't tend to like places where the staff (in this case, the hostesses) are pretentious.

The biscuits were sift yet dense and just the right amount of crumble (If you're a biscuit and gravy fanatic, you know how essential this element is.) The gravy was chunky and savory and the added egg gave the gravy flavor a whole new 'breakfast' dynamic.

My friend ordered Ty's Big Breakfast ($11). When they brought our food out, I had to ask Jason, our server, if he remembered I asked for a half order cause HOLY MOLY that thing was the same size as my friend's dish, a big plate completely filled!

The good thing about this restaurant is that we can just dropped down our names and they would call us when it was our turn.\\n\\nWe ordered mussel, 5 different kinds of oysters and one clam. I had mussels in many different places, so I would say the difference in this place as opposed to other restaurants was that it made some sort of spicy creamy sauce. I don't quite like seafood in spicy sauce, since I think most of time, we want to taste the freshness of the seafood itself. I would prefer to have a light white wine sauce for the mussels instead. \\n\\nIn terms of the oysters, we got cotuit, beausoleil, summerside, kumamoto and kusshi.... I like the last three the best, since they tastes sweet... I don't have a special opinion for Cotuit, but Beausoleil is the way that tastes a little bit bitter.... I am not a fan of bitter oyster, so I will leave the opinion to others.\\n\\nThe one last dish that changed my opinion to this restaurant was the tangy lobster spaghetti with truffle. I am totally hands down to the plate. Love lobsters, one of my best seafood....The spaghetti keeps the fresh and sweet taste of lobster. They cooked spaghetti for the right length of time, making each noodle very chewy. They put many pieces of Truffle on top of the Spaghetti, giving the dish a mushroomy, earthy and meaty taste. Truffle not only increased the taste of the dish, but also the scent when I smelled it... It is such a brilliant idea to add it to the spaghetti, but it definitely raises the price of the dish...

They offer Udi's gluten-free bread as an option, and it's nice that this place doesn't charge you extra for it like so many other places.  Other gluten-free folks out there probably know how gluten-free bread tends to be much smaller than it's regular gluten-laden nemesis.  Jam wants to make sure you still get enough, so I actually ended up getting two sandwiches to make up for the bread size.  It's more than I could ever eat in a sitting, but I appreciate the thought.

The food is very fresh and it is easy to order something homemade and healthy. The only reason I can't give them a perfect review is because the service is not always that great. I would say that they nail it about 80-90% of the time but when they have dropped the ball it has been pretty bad. One time I was told the wait would be an hour and I elected to stay and wait. I was sat 2 hours later because the host kept telling me that I would be sat at any minute. Another time they read my name and the amount of people in my party wrong so I was essentially skipped in the seating. Another time I felt I was being ignored after being sat so I flagged down a waiter for help to which he replied \\"I am not your waiter.\\" When I informed the manager she did not seem to care. I keep coming back for the food and the great South Austin vibe."},{"name":"Magnolia Cafe South","address":"1920 S Congress Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I love breakfast at this place.

I see a lot of yelpers are disappointed with the service in this place, but I've never had a problem. It's typical brief but polite busy diner service and I like that the person that seats you brings your drinks before the server sees you.

The pastries are a hit and miss; but they do use TCHO chocolate for their chocolate chip cookie which is delicious (sometimes a chocolate chip cookie can be to \\"flour-like\\" but this recipe they have mastered.  The lemon ginger scone is pretty divine too.  I did not enjoy the cheddar-scallion scone (it tasted like it was brushed or baked around meat and that's a turn-off for a vegetarian).  Flour does offer coffee drinks and for what they do, the pricing is not bad (but like most places in Boston, coffee is not a specialty so I would steer away from lattes, but except something decent for the price).  I tend to just go for a straight shot of espresso, which I did today, and I think the girl knew how to pack and pour a shot.\\n\\nNot wanting to venture too far from work since most eateries are quite far, I strolled to grab a salad from here today.  I recently had their mozzarella/tomato/basil sammy a few days prior and the bread was divine; freshly baked and the sandwich was good (I mean, what's not to enjoy when you do a caprese-salad into a sammy?)  Today, I ordered the quinoa salad which is one of the few salads without meat and cheese.  I should have gone with the pre-made one in the case (but did made-to-order as I do not know how long it really had been sitting in the case).  The reason I should have gone pre-made because it was a quinoa salad that was mixed with the ingredients.  The made-to-order was the complete opposite; it was 90% spinach and a small portion of the quinoa and veggies.  I guess I should not complain about getting a good source of vitamins and my daily greens, but the it is a $9 salad, so the pricing is a bit absurd for what I received.  If sweet greens was not a sh** show during the lunch hour I would venture there for a more substantial salad you can pre-order + make which can cost up to $2 less (and you can get two types of greens) if you stay within the parameters of not adding the expensive extras.  Also, fresh squeezed OJ is $4.26.  Yep, for 16oz.  You can grab a 1/2 gallon of organic OJ from TJs or WFs for the same price.  \\n\\nAll in all, flour is a decent choice.  Don't expect salads and sandwiches to be made neatly.  They seem to just whip them up as quick as possible (which is understandable due to their high volume at peak hours) but I wouldn't mind waiting a few minutes more to have something prepared with some thought rather than items slewed together to get orders out.  And if waiting is your game, then do not mind waiting a good five minutes to get a cup of coffee and a granola bar there.  They do not take your order and give your pastries right away (a la normal coffee/bakery shops).  They take your order, your money and then make you wait for items that are teasing you as you await.  Which means, there is a likelihood of what you ordered to run out before you even get it!

Hooters move over :P.\\n\\nDefinitely fall off the bone as other yelpers mentioned.  We can all agree, the way someone fries a wing (or anything ) can make it or break it.  Some restaurants with dry wings (in this case I mean dry seasoned vs wet sauce) taste dry (in this case I mean dry and moist) throughout - all the way to the bone.  The wings were fried to a nice crisp and the chicken was still moist underneath.   I barely used the ranch sauce - this proves to me I really liked the flavor off the wing itself.  Most wing joints I ask for more ranch.\\n\\nRanch on Fire - offered an ultimate flavor blend of spice and enough ranch on one teeny wing.  The ranch flavor almost tastes infused vs just being sprinkled on top.   \\n\\nGarlic Parmesan - nice flavor.  Lot of parm.  I didn't taste too much of garlic part but I LOVE garlic and like a lot of garlic flavor. \\n\\nHoly Schnikes - oh man this is the perfect name! I only took one bite out of the six we ordered.   I like to think I have a high spice/heat tolerance.  For example, I don't remember the ranch on fire being too hot.  Whereas when I look at other reviews they say otherwise.   This one is the mother. Wet sauce and HOT!  ...and hot that lingers for a while too.\\n\\nSo like the other reviews....yes its pricey for the portion you get.  Even on Wednesday (10 for $10) it still adds up.  We started with 10 and were still hungry so ended up ordering another 10.  Tummy wise - we could have still eaten more.  But! bonus was we brought our own bottle of wine and some beers - vs paying $5 for a beer at any other joint.  So in my mind it kind of evens it out.

The ambiance of the lower floor is what really makes this place unique as it is unlike any other place that I have been to before. It is very dark and smokey, with cool art all over the walls. I give this place a 5 for creativity because they combine a Southern vibe with a little twist of their own. The menu is large enough to appeal to all BBQ lovers. Great bar area with tons of drinks to enjoy. If you can't decide on a beer, don't be discouraged. There is a large wheel of beers awaiting you're indecisiveness. Next, all you have to do is decide between a 16 oz. or 33 oz. beer.. which is a no brainer for most Bostonians.\\n\\nWe sat on the main floor of Redbones which almost feels like a cafeteria room, completely different feel from their lower level floor.

Only a few tables seated. Atmosphere is great (casual, clean, romantic). Our server (female) was very attentive. 5 stars for each of these items. Unfortunately, the rating is hurt by the food itself and the value. We had the 5-course tasting menu, which was all that was offered (but I believe that they would accommodate ala carte dining, if requested). We also had wine pairings for $75 each. Our total bill for the two of us, including about a 22% tip, was $400. Please know that I have dined in a lot of expensive restaurants that serve a tasting menu of eclectic items with wine pairings, including Alinea, Moto, French Laundry, Jean Georges, Daniel, L'espalier, etc.  I do not mind paying for an expensive meal, and rather enjoy eating some more unusual items. However, I really felt a bit cheated by this restaurant. \\n\\nThe amuse was a shot glass of ginko meade--very nice. First course was some mackerel sashimi with sea cabbage and huckleberries. The fish was rather ordinary, and I would have rather had a piece of fatty toro or another piece of inventive sushi or sashimi. The sea cabbage mixed with the huckleberries had very little flavor at all, and smelled a bit like low tide in Boston Harbor. Second course was a bowl of spaghetti squash with some walnuts and gremolata.  It was terrible.  I suppose if you're a strict vegetarian, you might find this exciting, but I would have rather had two pieces of microwaved bacon. Third course was a very nicely prepared piece of lingcod in a shiso broth. Small, but perfectly done.  Fourth course was a wedge of cabbage--probably steamed then buttered and either grilled or blowtorched on one edge.  This was good, but it's something I'd serve at my house as a slight improvement on a traditional Irish boiled dinner.  There was a sauce next to this that was akin to a tablespoon of shrimp bisque. A quenelle of cantaloupe sorbet was served as an intermezzo.  Desert was a vanilla custard with a pine granita.  Custard was great.  The pine granita could have had more flavor.\\n\\nRestaurants typically have ingredient costs that are about 30% of budget. There is no way that our meals' ingredient cost was anywhere near this mark.\\n\\nAs for the wine pairings, we were served a sparkling white, two other whites, a red, and another white.  Each serving was about half a pour.  All of these were common wines from lesser-known vintners.  I was able to price a few of the bottles on the internet and they were inexpensive ~$25 dollar bottles.  All together, the two of us consumed the equivalent of about a bottle of $25 wine for $150.\\n\\nAfter I left, I was still hungry and stopped at another restaurant for a cup of clam chowder.  I had all I could do not to hit the McDonalds on the way back to my hotel for a quick Double Cheeseburger.\\n\\nWhile I realize that Cambridge is populated with vegetarians, vegans, pescavores, and gluten-frees, and that many are more worried about their carbon footprint than getting a good meal, most people that are willing to shell out $400 for a dinner for two on a Wednesday would love to be at least offered a piece of meat, so they can avoid having to buy a second meal on the way home.\\n\\nAll in all, for me, 2 stars.  If you are a wealthy, small eater, who tends toward the vegetarian side of life, you will be very happy with this restaurant."},{"name":"PONKO Chicken","address":"2896 Chamblee Tucker Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Lunch was so tasty and portion was huge!

The bus from back bay was a short ride, and the restaurant was conveniently located right by one of the bus stops on West Broadway. \\n\\nWe made a reservation online about 10 days in advance, so we had our pickings as to what time we wanted to dine. However, when we arrived we were told our table was not ready and were handed a buzzer (A really likes these). We killed our waiting time (approximately 20 mins) by knocking back a couple of beers at the bar. The beers on tap were reasonably priced and there was a wide variety. \\n\\nOne we sat at our table, our waitress greeted us promptly. However, she did not return to take our order as quickly as our stomachs would have liked. When we finally flagged her down, we ordered the warm goat cheese and fig dip to split as an appetizer. A ordered the smoked brisket sandwich with a side salad that had parmesan cheese on the top. P ordered the fried chicken with gravy with a side of the loaded hash browns. \\n\\nFor lack of better words, this dip was bangin. It came was cubed pieces of sourdough bread to dip. A's brisket was juicy and the rye bread had the perfect crunch (the salad was average, but good option instead of just fries). P's fried chicken looked great on the plate, but lacked the flavor to go along with its looks. The hash brown were very tasty, but unexpectedly came out in brick-like form. The portions were very large, as we both ended up wrapping a portion of our meals for lunch the next day.\\n\\nA quick note on the ambience -  it is EXTREMELY dark and quite loud. So loud, in fact, that A got a migraine. So dark that after a few beers and fried chicken, P was falling asleep at the table because there was no light whatsoever to keep him awake.\\n\\nOverall, a decent dining experience and we will most likely be back.

We also had the mackerel, which really were mackerel cakes (think a fishier, saltier version of crabcakes) with a lime avocado pur√©e and the scallops with rock shrimp and corn and chili- both also totally delicious. Overall our appetizers were perfectly cooked and balanced, interesting and creative. \\n\\nFor the main, we had the country fried trout with herbs which we found intriguing as it came with fresh butter lettuce to use as wraps. The fried crust on the fish was a bit heavy on the batter/ a bit overwhelming on the fried taste, but was much better in center of fish where the fish was thicker and there was a better ratio of batter to fish. The fresh herbs were a delight as were the slight pickled veggies that came with it. \\n\\nOverall dinner was a lovely experience.

That was two weeks ago and we've just returned from our second suppertime visit tonight. We're not connoisseurs of Indian food so we have no idea how authentic the offerings are here, but we know what we like - and we like. We like!\\n\\nOn our first visit, we started with vegetable samosas and chicken samosas which were offered as a special. They were each very tasty, but it was obvious that we'd over-ordered right off the bat as we had to tackle four samosas, altogether. They were tender and a little salty, but we found the pastry a little dry. We had options, of course - a relish tray including chutney, mint sauce, and a tamarind sauce, but open containers make us squeamish so we passed. For starters tonight we tried the aloo tikki (one order), little, spiced, deep-fried potato pancakes, and that was much more manageable. The coconut soup on special captured our attention, but we didn't want to over do it as we had the first time we visited. For entrees, between the two visits, we've had chicken tikka, chicken vindaloo, and some sort of chicken/potato dosa which is an enormous crepe stuffed with seasoned chicken and potatoes and is served with a bowl of lentil soup. We've also tried a couple of the breads. \\n\\nOn our virginal visit, our palates were burnt out after only a couple of bites, so somehow, everything tasted the same to us. The dosa was also very dry. Tonight, though, we're not certain if the spice level was reduced or if we knew better what to expect, but we recognized much more subtlety in the dishes - the sauce accompanying the chicken tikka being especially tasty and comforting this time, for example. For dessert each time, we enjoyed the punjabi kulfi, which is just ice cream on a stick. But, it's very rich and sweet/salty - nearly like a creamy sort of frozen cheese.\\n\\nAs for drinks, I believe that the beer was $3, the wine (3 reds, 3 whites) was $5, and mixed drinks were $5. There was no charge for soda refills.\\n\\nAnyway, service was just terrific on each visit. The (same) waiter was attentive throughout each meal and was very patient and helpful as we perused the menu on what turned out to be a busy night at Anmol.\\n\\nIn a room that's a little tacky (giant pink roses silk-screened onto the tabletops - \\"property of Anmol Restaurant\\" embroidered onto the backs of the waiters' vests) it's worth mentioning that the booths are very comfortable and private, and it's a warm, welcoming, and relaxing space.

There's Gindara and Gyoza and that's pretty much it.  \\n\\nOn weekdays, no lunch set options. Not sure about on weekends. I got the Salmon Oishi Sushi ($14) and it was OK, but I prefer my seared box sushis to have a more smokey flavor from the searing, more kick from the jalape√±o, and more flavor from the sauce. The Spicy Tuna Don on the other hand was really dosed in spicy sauce; thank goodness for the big pieces of avocado to cut the spice. \\n\\nPros are that the presentation of their food is nicely done and venue provided comfortable seating."},{"name":"Redbones BBQ","address":"55 Chester St","city":"Somerville","stars":"3.5","text":"Amazing food!

I've tried with no avail to come here 3 other times and every time couldn't get in because the wait was 2+ hours or they had stopped seating people for the evening.\\n\\nIf you are visiting Boston, come on a weekday after the lunch rush - I came at 3 pm and didn't have a problem sitting at the bar with a party of 2. Don't come past 7 or 7:30 pm, or you may not even be able to eat there or you may be eating at 9:00 pm if you're lucky and get one of the last seatings. They open at 11:30 am and the kitchen closes at 9:30 pm on weekdays, so plan your visit here accordingly. Also beware if you have a group more than 4. 2 people is probably best because they have more bar seating than tables.\\n\\nIt is not a cheap meal, so be prepared to drop ~$50-60 per person, or hope that you can expense your meal. Seafood is not cheap, and the-best-seafood-you'll-have is even more expensive, but it's worth every penny.  My coworker and I split a few things so that we could try a larger variety of things.\\n\\nFried Clams - I had fried clams before and didn't like them, but these were amazing. Not overly battered, fresh clams, and homemade tartar sauce. The portion size is quite generous and enough for 2-4 people to share.\\n\\nNeptune Johnycake ($18) - Honey butter, smoked trout, and sturgeon caviar; This dish is not the cheapest, but it's certainly very unique and I've never seen anything like this anywhere else. It's like a cornmeal/semolina flour pancake, with lots of honey and butter, so it's both sweet and salty at the same time, made more savory by the dollop of smoked trout on top and caviar. Definitely share with someone or multiple people since you won't want to just eat all of this in one sitting.\\n\\nLobster Roll & Fries ($29) - This is the best lobster roll that I've had in my life, and may have ruined all other lobster rolls in the future for me. Yes, it's pricey at $29, but it's worth the price for the huge chunks of fresh lobster that you get, the perfectly toasted roll. The fries that come with it are crisp and seasoned, and the whole thing is just delightful. Don't miss this. You can get it cold or warm (I suggest getting it warm with butter)\\n\\nOysters - The oysters were also delicious, but would pass on these to get more of their other more dishes that you wouldn't be able to find just-anywhere.\\n\\nWorth making a special trip out of the way to come here if you come to Boston, and braving the line and wait."},{"name":"Joey D's Oak Room","address":"1015 Crown Pointe Pkwy","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"We had lunch at Joey D's today, the food was very good, the service however was another story.

On a clear day you can see pretty much everything that the Portland area has to offer.  Even if it is cloudy and overcast the view of the river and I-5 is magical and much more sublime than I can express in writing.  The one downside is that the secret about the view is out so make sure you arrive a little before happy hour starts (4:30) if you want to grab one of the swanky windowside couch spots.  There is no discount on drinks and although they have a wide variety of cocktails they are all 8 dollars and up, with the beer average around 5.50.  The HH food is good, cheap and somewhat pretentious.  The main culinary thrust of the main dining area is a Japanese fusiony sushi thing, but the HH menu covers quite a bit of ground from Burgers to strange spring rolls.  I have yet to go wrong with any of the HH food on offer, just order what your heart tells you and you will be happy.  I also recommend asking for a desert menu (also overpriced, but super dooper decadent) .\\nAll in all not the best HH in town, but certainly a great place that offers more than just booze and food.

I would not have stayed there if I thought I had to talk over loud music. Waiter was half hearted about asking manager to turn it down. after a while volume was lowered. My entree, veggie grits bowl was inedible- way to salty-and the veggie toppings had some kind of tough greens - the veggies were awful.  The huge slightly burned biscuit (biscuit was not cheap and should not be served burned at all imo) was served on a very tiny plate making it extremely awkward to slice it and put condiments on top of it. so I put the burned part on the table since I wasn't going to eat it anyway. That helped a little. The biscuit, which I had as an appetizer, fell completely apart and couldnt be contained on the tiny plate so I ended up feeling like the table had become a garbage zone with 3 empty jelly and butter containers and a burnt half of a biscuit and other biscuit debris everywhere. Service was slow. And the 2 or 3 times a server did come to the table there was no interest in gathering any of the debris that was all over my table. I was shocked at that. And then of course the main course (this was brunch) was inedible. The waiter noticed - after about half an hour - that the veggie bowl was barely touched so at that point he did inquire about whether it was good. I told him it was too salty (it was awful beyond the saltiness but I was embarrassed to have a bitch fest in front of my friend) and he offered to take it off the tab. Too little too late. Who is training these people? We tipped him well because I feel like the quality of the service is the responsibility of the management and I hate to take it out on the waiter.

As a former SoCal inhabitant, I am well aware of the dangers of mingling with such an unpredictable and dangerous species.  The cougar's aggressive behavior and predilection toward preying on men my age gave Los Angeles night life a deep and persistent sense of peril (hey, I was engaged!)\\n\\nSince I've moved to the beautiful Pacific Northwest, I've really let my guard down.  Portland has a variety of delightful fauna, most of whom are decidedly non-aggressive.

Nevertheless, I was very impressed with this Buckhead spot. It totally lived up to the recommendations I had received.\\n\\nThe location is fairly easy to find and there is plentiful parking - both of which are the exception in north Buckhead. The decor is very inviting - dark with white tile. The light fixtures are fun, if not a bit trendy. The booths are very comfortable and the din is minimal even when they're full.\\n\\nOur server was outstanding. They were johnny on the spot with anything we needed. He warned us that food might be delayed in coming out since this was a special occasion and it was the first seating. The timing couldn't have been more perfect! The appetizer came out within 10 minutes. The drinks were nearly immediate and refilled frequently. The entrees followed approximately 15 minutes after the appetizer. We contemplated dessert but were too full.\\n\\nFor an appetizer, we had the pimento cheese and pretzel bread. The cheese was fantastic! A large ball of cheddar and cream and pimento in harmony, we scraped spoonfuls onto the soft, delicious pretzel bread (best I've ever had) like manners were never invented. It also came with a nice portion of house pickles which were delectable as well.\\n\\nFor my entree, I had the breakfast sausage eggs Benedict. The eggs were well-poached and the hollandaise had the right consistency without overwhelming. The sausages were the stars of the show though. You can always tell excellent, homemade sausage. Instead of the congealed pre made stuff, this was crumbly and pure and the meat shined through the other flavors. The home fries were very good too.\\n\\nI was thrilled with my first visit and look forward to going back.

And I walked away pregnant with their food baby.\\n\\nWe have grown tired of other eateries, so Magnolia offered something new to our palate. Husband ordered the Crawfish √âtouff√©e , I had to try their Chicken BBQ Enchiladas and the Kid had his usual Grilled Cheese (those for kid's, their selection was very awesome in the eye's of this parent). We were all pleasantly satisfied with not only the food, but waitstaff as well.\\n\\nMy husband was afraid the crayfish dish would be small and come served in a bowl (which for $10, we certainly hoped not). Instead he received a dish full of yummy crawfish and didn't experience a bite where crawfish was not involved. Plentiful? You betcha. \\n\\nI'm an Enchilada queen. Every new  place I go, I tend to always order the enchiladas if they're available. For the first time in my Mexican life, I had enchiladas with flour tortillas (not corn). I was iffy, but WOW. The combination of BBQ chicken, black beans and cheese hit the spot. The rice could have used some work, but when doused in queso, it wasn't at all bad.\\n\\nThe grilled cheese was incredible. Normally, when my son eats any sandwich, he'll leave the crusts (because I'm not going to go through the trouble of cutting off crusts; Kid's spoiled but not that spoiled!). My husband and I were astonished when he actually ate the crusts!! Why? Because this grilled cheese sandwich served on yummy wheat bread was exploding with yummy Monterrey Jack cheese. I mean, it was oozing cheese and that is just how my son loves it, apparently. He couldn't leave any cheese behind, even if it meant eating the crust. \\n\\nFinally, for dessert, we ordered an apple pie a la mode. We were able to share and each have our fill from one slice of pie and a serving of ice cream. They definitely don't skimp on the dessert here. It looked like it was TOO sweet, but once we dove in, it was just perfect. Writing about it makes me want to go back and get more, and hey, I can because it's open 24/7. This could be bad for business, y'all.\\n\\nFor our first time, we were very very happy. The restaurant did have a diner feel to it, but that's a diner for you.

Our order for drinks was taken very promptly, and I got a Rio Bravo and the BF got a frozen margarita. My drink was great, but the margarita was even better! The marg mix was perfect; not too sweet or too sour, and it tasted reasonably alcoholic (sometimes I get margaritas that taste like someone forgot to put tequila in. and that's annoying).\\n\\nour appetizer was also great and it arrived very promptly.

I got an order of chicken adobados enchiladas, and the BF got chicken flautas with verde sauce. We actually ended up switching entrees because his flautas had a ton of cheese on them (not mentioned on the menu) and he is not a cheese fan, while my enchiladas had practically no cheese (and don't enchiladas always have a ton of cheese?? boo!). This brings me to a point that I would like to make about restaurant menus:\\n\\nPEOPLE, list the main ingredients that you put in the dish. How am I supposed to know that your rendition of enchiladas involves not cheese, but your flautas are extra cheesy?? This goes beyond just not liking ingredients - people with food allergies or dietary restrictions generally like to know these things as well. I'm not saying menus need to list every single ingredient, but if it is a substantial part of the dish, just list it. I don't care how \\"standard\\" it is because everyone has a different idea of what standard is. /End rant.\\n\\nConclusion: I would come back here for drinks and apps, but I could have gotten the entrees elsewhere for 1/2 the price and they would have been equally good or better."},{"name":"The Thurman Cafe","address":"183 Thurman Ave","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Another great burger.

Out of the many, many restaurants on the list, my bf and I had already gone to 3 of those restaurants and didn't think they were that great. Just when we had lost all hope, said bf did a Google search, where he found Le Coq Au Vin.\\n\\nIt is a quaint house renovated into a restaurant, so when you pass it on the road, yes, that house IS the restaurant. Thank goodness for GPS. We didn't have any reservations, but we were seated right away. The waiter was very entertaining and helpful. I don't remember his name since it was back in September, but I want him the next time I go back.\\n\\nBF stuck with the dining month menu , while I chose separate dishes, and we shared the dessert from his menu.\\n\\nHe started with the french onion soup. It was AMAZING.  I kept sneaking spoonfuls of his soup that he started inching it away from me. I had thoughts of it several days after (so much, that I decided to make some back in NY). I had the steak tartare app. which was on the small side (I know, I know, it's an appetizer, but, but.. ok I have no reason, I'm just a fatty). It was my first time eating steak tartare and if this is what it tastes like, I am going to order this every time I see it on a menu from now on. It had a perfect balance of herbs and spices with the ground meat. The tartare came with toast points, but I actually just wanted to eat the meat by itself so I could taste everything (but I didn't... until I ran out of toast).\\n\\nFor the entree, bf got the poulet coq au vin (braised chicken in red wine). It was okay, not as great as we thought it would be since the restaurant is named after this dish. The meat was a little dry and everything was slightly bland. To be fair, I'm not a big fan of dishes with a bunch of veggies, but my bf likes to be healthy sometimes, and he was a bit saddened by it.\\n\\nOn the other hand, I had the pork schnitzel hunter style on recommendation of the waiter. It came with au gratin potatoes and beets/slaw. This dish was incredible. the schnitzel was crunchy and golden brown, the mushroom and peppercorn sauce on top was good. I did notice that the sauce was a bit salty, but served with the schnitzel, I just didn't care. The potatoes were flavorful. This time, my bf kept reaching over to steal forkfuls of everything from my plate.\\n\\nFor dessert, we had the Grand Marnier souffle. The souffle was moist and super fluffy, yet light. Couldn't taste much alcohol though, but it was good.\\n\\nWe can't wait to go back to Florida and eat here again. We're just hoping that the quality of the food will stay the same. Le Coq au Vin is a restaurant I would happily recommend to anyone. I'm salivating thinking of the food here. I left very happy. I even drew a smiley face on the waiter's receipt/tip. And that means I'm happy for real. =)"},{"name":"The Thurman Cafe","address":"183 Thurman Ave","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"My favorite burger place in North America.

Our server, Tony, lacked the \\"je ne sais quoi?...personality I thought would come with an establishment where I alone spent $87 on dinner (the Bronzino was delish and rang in at $29) and two glasses of wine, & cup of hot tea in lieu of dessert.  I did have a shrimp cocktail app.  I like protein--sue me!\\n\\nSo, in trying to strike up a convo, and because I enjoy traveling, I asked \\"Tony\\" where his accent was from.  Naturally, I felt this would open up some dialogue...since we were waiting for the rest of our party to arrive.  He responded that it was a fake accent and that he uses it to \\"get beeeg teeeeps\\"...Nothing like a killer of chit-chat, Tony.  I'm not buying your fake accent, but fine!  Your vibe is stiff and non-celebratory.  Instead of enjoying playful banter with our server (as is usually the case when out with the gals), Tony kept things strictly business, although not at the top of his game (more later). \\n\\nDepending on what you order, expect the size of a nouvelle cuisine restaurant, and expect entrees to run about $25 on average (give or take).  Salads, which appear on the smaller side of things, run about $12.  I had a shrimp cocktail appetizer, which consisted of 4 jumbo prawns in cocktail sauce dolloped with horseradish ($15).  They could cut back on the amount of cocktail sauce, but the chilled shrimp (as big as my thighs) was great.  \\n\\nThe deal of the day/night was that if you sat at the bar, oysters were $1 each until 6:30. Even though our table was ready for 6 PM, we weren't able to take advantage of this.  Really, Gaslight?  If we're all having a cocktail, extend the special to the dinner tables, please. Pffffft!\\n\\nSomewhere between apps and main dishes, another server (the poor kid), dropped several glass items off his tray, which came crashing down alongside our table.  Yes, glass was everywhere.  Yes, some of us could feel it spray under our table.  No, we didn't have bleeding ankles, but it would have been nice for SOMEONE to check.  A waitress swept up the mess, and made attempts to gather it all up, but upon getting up from the table at the end of the night, we were still crunching on glass shards.  Again, given the price point of this place, I expect more attentive service and frankly, I'd like to be doted upon a bit more.  We weren't looking for anything to be comped, but send over a manager to make sure we were okay. \\n\\nBack to Tony:  My entree came with \\"cauliflower two ways\\".  I asked if there'd be breading...if there were potatoes on the plate.  If so, I didn't want the taters.  Or better yet, could I switch out the potato for a green veggie.  Tony assured me there were no potatoes.  So, imagine my surprise/annoyance when my plate arrived with these indiscriminate perfectly round white balls (they melon-ball their potatoes???).  Lo, and behold, I had potatoes sitting among my cauliflower mash and roasted florets.  Not, okay, Tony!  Carb counting is essential (for diabetics or Ketogenics) and we prefer to use ours on the nice glasses of wine being served!  \\n\\nHaving no room for dessert, I ordered a cup of tea with cream.  Several others ordered cappuccinos.   Tony returned and put a cup of something frothy in front of me.  Could this be a cup of tea with frothed cream (breve)?  I'd like THAT, but to be sure, I asked if this was the tea?  He responded with, \\"does it look like tea?\\" and took it away and gave it to its rightful owner.  Last straw for me and the reason I'm Yelping!\\n\\nWhen the bill came, one member of our party had asked to keep her meal and drinks separate.  Though waitstaff typically HATE this request, I totally understand, since some folks drink more than others, or in my case, I eat more expensive protein options and don't feel my friends should be ponying up cash on the check-splitting.  Well, Tony obviously misunderstood, and instead of keeping her tab SEPARATE, he put the entire check onto her CC.  And while we were nice about letting him know he'd obviously misunderstood, he seemed totally put out in having to fix the error.  \\n\\nI hate being an ageist, but could it be that our 50-year old mindset of a certain expectation of service at a given price point made us cranky? (given that most waitstaff appeared to be in their late 20s and early 30s)?  I think not.  I believe that high-end restaurants need to train waitstaff in the art of fine service.  My friends and I have made it to the station in life where we can afford better establishments and are willing, within reason, to pay for quality.

We went in shortly after 5pm and were the only people there.  The decor is great, very beautiful and Indian inspired.  However, that was the majority of the positives. Our waiter was somewhat of a pompous know-it-all who seemed to pride himself on being rude.  Bad form sir, there were five women who all got alcohol and expensive meals... he would've gotten a better tip if he had been a little nicer.  The menu was... interesting.  I'm not sure what French and Indian cuisine have to do with each other, but I ordered the red peppercorn tuna from the French inspired menu.  The tuna was good, kind of overcooked for my med-rare order, as was the asparagus and corn.  But the \\"tomato chutney\\" was no more than cherry tomatoes sliced in half drowning in some sort of tomato sauce/ketchup tasting paste.  Less than impressive.  The one saving grace was the eggplant salsa and naan appetizer.  The eggplant salsa was DELICIOUS.  The perfect blend of sweet and spicy.  Finally, our arrogant server brought us the dessert menu which listed approximately ten delicious sounding desserts... well too bad for us because only TWO of them were available!  So we passed on dessert and then our server informed us that the credit card machines were down and could stay that way for an hour or so.  Thankfully we all had cash, but really?

We decided to sit at the bar since we didn't know that we had to sit next to people in the tables, not that I minded sitting next to people. We decided to splurge and order oysters and the New England clam chowder for appetizers. The oysters were prepared as per ordered and it was so fresh. I was skeptical to try it since I've had a bad experience with oysters but with each oyster we ordered, you can tell it's fresh. You can taste literally where each oyster was harvested from. The clam chowder was the best one I've ever had. It was fresh clams and a good chunky size too. The broth wasn't too chunky and a little soupy but it was still perfect. I ordered the hot buttered lobster roll. They put a good amount of lobster in there and there's fries on the side. It was a perfect lobster roll. I was so full at the end of the lobster roll but I had to finish the lobster part and left behind the bread. Even the bread was buttered perfectly. A glass of beer is the perfect way to enjoy this meal. I would come back here if I was in Boston again. The service was great and everyone was so helpful."},{"name":"Neptune Oyster","address":"63 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"This place was recommended to us by a a person from the tourist bureau.

We are visiting from San Antonio for the weekend and amongst many other great Austin surprises this has been one of the best. The young couple running this are not only friendly but staying true to making authentic Thai food rather than diluted or fused Thai. The young lady is from northern Thailand and has clearly been brought up with family tradition for cooking the very best Thai food.  Her beautiful smile, pleasant, shy demeanor is also very authentic Thai. Don't let that fool you because she should be cooking authentic Thai at some of the very best Thai restaurants in the US.

I decided to pay for his food to show appreciation. I told the waitress what I wanted to do, she goes over and talks to the manager. The manager seemed irritated by my request, even to the point of rolling her eyes. The waitress came back and said I could pay his bill but I wasn't allowed to say anything to him......What? I was a little shocked. I went up front to pay for my bill and for his bill and the manager and a couple of waitresses were up there when I paid. I saw him come up behind me and I said I am going to thank him for his service. The manager looked at me and said I couldn't do it. I am not sure why she said it or whether it was any of her business who I paid for or who I talk to. At the time it was just shocking to me. As I walked out I was looking back and the policeman was paying them something. I am not sure if they took my money, which wasn't much because police men only pay 50% Or something else was going on. I kind of motioned to the waitress who came out front and told me he was paying his tip. Either way I feel something fishy was going on. Really in my gut I feel this woman (manager) was anti-police.

Once was to celebrate my engagement to my now wife, and once was taking my Japanese coworker to show him Columbus doesn't only have the chains and chicken wing places that he had been introduced to.\\n\\nI tend to order tasting menus if they have them- and my coworker and I shared a 5 course tasting, which ended up being about 1-2 bites per dish each.  It was great- we got to try a lot of different tastes, and got to see some of the creativity of the chef.  We also ordered some mussels, some calamari, maybe another tapas plate, split a $15 bottle of Spanish beer (from that famous Spanish gastro restaurant ElBulli), had a few mixed drinks.  This is how people often eat in Izakayas in Japan, (And how tapas work of course) and we pulled it off to full effect here. It was good enough that he saw Columbus in a new light for just about $35/person.  The presence of some attractive women in attractive dress probably helped convince him- No OSU sweatshirts!\\n\\nMy wife and I got fully dressed up.   We also split some tapas.  Some Spanish cheeses.  Mussels again?  I find them hard to resist.  A bottle of Cava (Spanish champagne for lack of a better description- recommended even not for special occasions).  We were celebrating, and the waiter recognized it.  We ended up splitting a lamb-shank entr√©e, and they gave us both full servings of the delectable accoutrements for just a slight upcharge.  I wanted to take the clean shank bone home and make soup out of it- the flavors were so concentrated and warm.  We were stuffed, and in love!  \\n\\nSome notes:\\n\\n-I think this is a nice flexible restaurant in that you could go for Paella and some beers, or as a fancy celebration night out.  I recommend no matter what at least getting snazzed up slightly, because the hostesses wear dresses, look nice, and you'll feel subconscious standing there if you're looking schlubby.\\n\\n-This is the best Calamari (outside of an Asian restaurant) I've had in Columbus.  \\n\\n-As someone who likes adventurous kitchens and ingredients- I can see where some people accuse the waitstaff of being snobbish-  If you know what they're talking about (or pretend to) it doesn't come off that way- it's a hard go for them to know what level to talk at.  Based on the casualness of 95% of the waiters in Columbus, I don't mind a little snobbishness myself if it's pared to food that deserves it.  \\n\\n-I quite like how it's just tucked in the neighborhood.  While it may be harder to park- there's just something about it that adds to the ambience.  There's just something wrong about a nice restaurant surrounded by a big parking lot to me.  This works for Lindey's as well.

I am also a serious chili head, and I always order my dishes at the maximum level of heat.\\n\\nI ordered the \\"Evil Jungle Noodles\\" with chicken, and told the waitress I wanted the most ridiculously maximum level of heat the chef could dish out. As I took the first bite, I noted that the level of heat was \\"zero\\", nothing, nada, zilch. The peanut sauce offered very sweet peanut flavor, but lacked the other complimentary Thai flavors like salty, tart and hot. It was really very bland. The rice noodles were obviously overcooked, as they were kind of sticky and the instant they hit my palate they turned into a pasty texture resembling a rice porridge. I signaled the waitress and asked for the chili condiment tray, hoping said embellishments might resurrect this dish a little. Instead of the standard Thai condiments (toasted ground red Thai chiles, sliced fresh green Thai chiles in fish sauce and Thai chili paste), I got a basket with a squeeze bottle of Sriracha, a squeeze bottle of what appeared to be Sambal but lacking heat, and a shaker of pizza parlor peppers. Not exactly authentic Thai.\\n\\nOne thing that sent up a red flag for me when I first looked at the menu is that even though the restaurant markets itself as a Thai restaurant, it also offers selections that are Chinese and Japanese in origin (my wife ordered \\"Yakisoba Noodles\\", not exactly Thai). I recognize that Thai cuisine has much Chinese influence, and there is certainly nothing wrong with a restaurant taking a \\"fusion\\" approach. Unfortunately, sometimes when a restaurant tries to do too many things, they don't do any one thing as well as if they maintained a specific focus. Perhaps this restaurant also targets an American palate that might be put off by bold and unfamiliar flavors that are too exotic, I don't know.\\n\\nOn a positive note, the atmosphere was fine, and the Thai music they played was more authentic than the food I had. The young lady who waited our table was pleasant and did a fine job."},{"name":"Neptune Oyster","address":"63 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Overall, while the food was decent, it was at least 90 degrees inside without functioning air conditioning.

Wonderful, but clearly exhausted, server -- we got there for a 8:30pm rez and were seated at around 9:15.  It was extremely busy, so I felt for him.\\n\\nAll three of us chose to get the restaurant week prix-fixe.  I got caesar salad, shrimp and grits, and a chocolate chip cookie sort of thing.  All were fine.  Not good, but fine.  \\n\\nI really appreciated the wine list and the fact that they knew what they were talking about.  My friends went with cocktails and were very pleased with their martinis.\\n\\nSecond time was brunch.  I enjoyed this even more.  We had an hour wait, so we went for a walk, came back, and they were ready to seat us.  I had the Eggs T. Murphy (basically benedict) and it was awesome.  My friend got a bloody mary that he loved and the Eggs Slum Mulligan which would have been jealousy-making if I hadn't been enjoying mine so much.  The even better part was that we got this bread that came with it and OH MAN.  So good.\\n\\nSo, there's a reason that the wait for brunch here is crazy.  I'd say it's worth it, really.

From sandwiches, to fresh teas, to fresh pastries, it was everything you need for your midday refuel. Including bread ends. $2 for an ENTIRE bag of bread ends. (for the pigeons, for wandersnacking...)\\n\\nThe entire ordering process was chaotic and there is room for improvement, as available cashiers take orders from every open space behind the pastry display. They also don't yell very loud, so if you're waiting to order and can't see the waving cashier, you're just holding up the line. It's tough to ask questions because of how loud it is in there, and finding your receipt at the register (not with your cashier) is a trip. Lastly, the crowd of people who wait for their names to be called was pretty dense in the middle of the lunch hour, but luckily my seasoned bestie knew how to not panic and to walk around them to a seat at one of the many tables and bar stools on the side.\\n\\nI ordered the daily special stuffed bread - the cashier that helped me had no clue what I was talking about until I gesticulated towards the board, and he seemed surprised that it was up there. That was a little awkward, but I guess with their extensive menu, the dailies aren't as popular. I also ordered a lemon-limeade, and a ginger molasses cookie. The cookie came first, as I wandered toward the end of the pastry display, then the limeade a few minutes later, and the stuffed bread came 5 minutes after that.\\n\\nEverything was utterly delicious. My stuffed bread was essentially a slice of baguette with the center removed, baked with chicken, cheese, carrots, and cabbage. It came with a side salad, and I was completely and utterly satisfied by the flavor, the texture, and the quantity. My cookie, which was shared and quickly devoured amongst friends, was a great end to a great meal.

I had just applied for an MA license (my FL one was due to expire on my birthday), so they took my old license away and gave me a useless piece of paper to hold onto while the new license was being mailed to me. Of course it didn't fit in my wallet, and I kept forgetting to transfer it between purses, and I was really sad that I couldn't prove my brand-new age. I told the waitress I didn't have ID on me, and my friends were like \\"It's her BIRTHDAY!\\" and our waitress took pity and served me because, \\"Aww, you have to get a drink on your birthday.\\" Everyone else at the table was 23-25, so I guess it was clear that we weren't conniving Tufts students or anything.

I walked in around 2 p.m. to a nearly completely empty place. The staff did not even know this promotion was going on even though they had a sign on their window. I showed the waiter on my phone and he believed me. The staff was not even aware of the menu choices they offered. I ordered what was listed as Veggie Delight Pasta served over Linguine with your choice of alfredo or marinara sauce. I ordered alfredo. The waiter came back to me and said they mix the sauces. Huh? I said please just do the alfredo and they listened. I got my entree and it was loaded with vegetables but had not one piece of pasta -- zero--nada. It was just a big plate of vegetables in alfredo sauce. It took quite a while for the waiter to check on me even though there were more staff than customers present at the time. I brought it to his attention that there was no pasta. He said he'll cook me a new one to bring home. I said thanks. He comes back and says the chef said the dish was not supposed to have pasta. It's posted here on the menu (link below) they supposedly wrote but of which they were unaware. My second course was lemon meringue pie. Both courses were decent quality -- hence why the second star. When I got the bill, it was an iPad directing me to press a button for pre-programmed tip percentages -- 18, 20, or 25. I like to be generous to a certain degree so my personal minimum is 20%, which is what I pressed, but the customer should have the option to give any amount s/he wants. The calculated percentages in fact were inflated I realized afterward. $4.40 is NOT 20% of $18 (i guess once again the prix fixe special somehow wasn't adjusted for in the tip calculator). Anyway, when all was said and done, including tax and tip, I paid over $23 for vegetables in alfredo sauce and a slice of pie with terrible service in a nearly empty but well-staffed restaurant.

The restaurant is spacious, high ceilings and intimate atmosphere.

This is definitely not your traditional Italian spaghetti and meatballs. The dishes I have tried here were all amazing! For dinner, you can select from their crudo, crostini, antipasti, pasta, and secondi menu. I tried the tuna tartare, steak tartare, spaghetti with crab, sea urchin, and chili. The tuna tartare was super fresh. The caviar on top was a nice touch. The seasoning for the tartare was mild so it didn't mask the flavors of the tuna. The steak tartare was super delicious. I was very impressed. I can write this review to just talk about the steak tartare at this restaurant. The beef was also very fresh. The bread that they serve with the beef tartare was lightly grilled. This was a nice touch. The charred flavors from the bread along with the beef tartare accentuated the beef flavor. It tasted almost like I was eating a grilled steak. It was mind blowing and I could not stop eating it! I would come back to this restaurant just for the steak tartare. The pasta dish was also super delicious. The pasta was al dente and they make their pasta in house so you know it is fresh. The sauce was delicious, it tasted more like crabs than sea urchin. It seems like they used some crab roe in the sauce to deliver such strong crab and seafood flavors. I was expecting more sea urchin because I love it but this dish was still very delicious. \\n\\nThe service is wonderful here. All the staff were polite and attentive. I would definitely recommend trying this restaurant!"},{"name":"Luke's Lobster Back Bay","address":"75 Exeter Street","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"This place is amazing...

The food and service were superb. Both times I enjoyed the fried chicken coq au vin. The chicken was perfectly cooked, crisp and amazing.  And the mashed potatoes - pure creamy heaven. The oysters were also fresh and delicious. Even something as simple as their green salad was simple but well constructed. Service was attentive and well paced. I sat upstairs but probably would prefer downstairs or at the bar since I felt a little removed from the overall dining ambiance. I dined alone so maybe that affected it.

We would have planned our day out differently if we knew if was going to be such a long wait!\\n\\nThe service was SLOW! I get that it was a busy night and our server was busy but her attitude definitely showed that she was busy and annoyed. When she was taking our order, she didn't even make any eye contact with us cause she was too busy packing up to go bags and would stop us mid order so she could run some food. \\n\\nThe restaurant is TINY (hence the long wait)! Since everything is jam packed, prepare to get bumped into by random people trying to passing by and having to watch your elbows while you eat.\\n\\nP.S. We saw people get up and leave.

It took a little while for me, and the people before me, to be seated. As I ate my lunch, I realized that seemed to be the norm.

We are not from the area so we went based on the reviews and food pictures/menu. We made reservations through Open Table which was very easy and went smoothly. We sat down at 633pm and were paying the check at about 740pm. \\n\\nThe first thing we noticed was that it's extremely loud in there. If there was music in the background, you couldn't hear it. My friends and I had to literally shout in order to hear each other, and the waitress had to lean down over our table for us to hear her. This would not be a place to go on a first date. \\n\\nSecondly, the water comes in a carafe and is room temperature, no ice. I don't usually mind my water at room temperature, however it was very humid out so a nice glass of cold water would've been refreshing. We did not ask for ice or the reasoning behind the warm water as it was so loud we probably wouldn't have heard the answer. \\n\\nThird, the food: The menu I read from the Yelp link and some of the delicious food pictures are old. There is no truffle mac & cheese (which I was sooo looking forward to), and several other items were no longer available. This was extremely disappointing. I split the goat cheese dip with one of my friends and it was incredibly delicious!!! I could eat that all day long! Creamy cheese topped with sweet fig jam and sliced almonds, served warm with crusty bread. Heaven! One friend got the kale salad which she said was good. My other friend got a steak which looked very pretty and she said it was good. I got the salmon (minus the muscles) which on the menu said came with asparagus and whipped potatoes. First thing I noticed (along with my friends steak plate) there was only about 2 teaspoons of potato smeared across the plate under the main food. The cheapest thing on the plate and that's what they skimped on?? There was tons of asparagus which was nice since most places only give you like 3 stalks, but given that I didn't get the muscles, at least throw on some extra potatoes. It was as if the potatoes were only used as a decoration or as a \\"glue\\" to hold the asparagus in place. Needless to say I asked for more which they said would be free of charge thankfully... It came in the tiniest of little bowls ever, amounting to about 2-3 table spoons full. Weird. I will say all of the food was tasty despite skimpy portions. \\n\\nThe staff were friendly and the space was huge, clean and stylish. The crowd is very young, just barely of drinking age. Jeans are acceptable but saw most of the clientele were dressed as if they were going to a club. \\n\\nIt's a very loud busy place, tasty but skimpy food, and I'd probably not go back again."},{"name":"Yuki Shabu-Chinese Gourmet","address":"16 Bow St","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"Big portion and high quality!

My overview:\\n*****\\nI. FOOD & DRINK\\nThis Grand Champion location resides inside of Krog Street Market, right next to Yalla and across from Jenny's Ice Cream. Parking can seem overwhelming on the weekends, but random lots and spots on the street are available if you try.\\n\\nII. FOOD\\nI ordered a half slab of ribs with a small side of potato salad. The ribs, despite having a beautiful smoke ring, were slightly dry and chewy. Perhaps I received an old slab, but I was surprised of how underwhelming it was. I relied on the two sauces provided: Original BBQ and North Carolina BBQ. I prefer the meat to speak for itself. \\n\\nRegarding my side - which comes in either small, regular, or large - of potato salad, I loved it! Not too much mayo, but enough to hold everything together. It also had precisely the right amount of egg for the color and to provide a subtle taste after each bite, but it didn't taste like I was eating an egg sandwich. Me like.\\n\\nIII. SERVICE\\nVery friendly and fast folks work behind the counter. I got my food in under five minutes during lunch hour. No problems.\\n\\nIV. AMBIENCE & D√âCOR\\nWell, it's a stand at Krog Street Market, but it's usually live. I also love how this stand has a background wall consisting of large slabs of wood. Ooh, can I decorate my condo like this? \\n\\nV. PRICES\\nLike most things in Krog Street, it's pricey. It's maybe a few bucks more than other BBQ establishments around town, but it's not outrageous. (They gotta pay rent, ya know.) \\n\\nVI. OVERALL\\nGrand Champion is not my favorite BBQ establishment, but they're super nice and I would totally give them another try the next time I'm at Krog Street Market. I'll, for sure, continue to support them at local food festivals and check out their other locations. Hopefully, they're better!"},{"name":"Tasty n Alder","address":"580 SW 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"This place was a disappointment.

The food is always tasty and visually appealing but this visit in particular struck me because of the quality of service I received. Our waiter Chris was extra attentive to our party. He noticed a dietary restriction at our table without us telling him and went to the trouble of finding a way to make a meal a possibility that was not on the menu. It meant everyone at the table had something delicious and in order to make it happen he had to customize a dish and coordinate with other members of the staff. In addition to this pleasant surprise he was very discreet in handling our plates. As a native-northerner I HATE it when a waiter interrupts my conversation to ask to take my plate. I expect the waitstaff to be perceptive enough to know when to take them or to ask at an opportune time.

I don't understand why people rave about their pizza.  There wasn't one thing I liked about it.  \\n\\nFirst off the crust had no flavor whatsoever. It's cooked through but the consistency and \\"flavor\\" sour dough bread, not pizza. It was also really burnt.  Usually that works on wood fire pizza but the charred black spots made it really bitter and I couldn't eat any part that wasn't covered with toppings. \\n\\nWhich leads me to the toppings. I got the mushroom pizza and it had two types of cheese on it plus crumini mushrooms if I recall.  The cheeses were so powerful that you couldn't taste anything but cheese. The consistency of the cheese is a problem as well. Instead of that nice stringy chewy goodness, it was hard and rubbery. I was so put off by all this that I gave the leftovers to a friend, and that was the first time I've ever given away pizza leftovers that I can recall. \\n\\nThe only reason I gave it two stars was because the salads (a roasted cauliflower and a green leaf  with herb dressing) were very good as was the salted caramel ice cream.  The staff was very friendly and attentive which got them another star. \\n\\nAll in all, I probably won't go back to Lovely's but if I do it'll be for ice cream and maybe salad.  I love pizza.  I could eat it every day, but I wouldn't eat their pizza again even if it was free.  If you want a really good pizza pie, do yourself a favor and go to Nostrana's or Sizzle Pie* for that matter. Their's is what pizza should taste like. \\n\\n* Just to be clear, I do not work at Nostrana's or Sizzle Pie nor did I get any discount or free\\nfood in return for suggesting their establishments.

The Bistro is noisy and we were pleased to be seated on the mezzanine floor. After the hostess gave us our menus. We waited for about 10 minutes for a member of the wait staff to appear at our table. Rather then introducing herself (more on that later), she launched into the soup special. She then proceeded to fill our glasses with water which she spilled on the first serving, never attempting to wipe it up. We ordered wine and martinis. The martinis are served in quaint LITTLE sherbet glasses. The wine close to $100 for the bottle was presented to us and once again our wait person spilled on the table whilst filling the glasses. The bread was presented for four of us with one pad of butter. When I asked for more she brought us two pads of butter. When I asked for more bread she proceeded to cut the bread at the nearby cutting board as if she were attempting to saw through the table. \\nI asked her if she had introduced herself as I could not remember. She said it was the policy of the Bistro no one was expected to introduce themselves. She then reluctantly agreed to provide her name. Ali or Alley?? We ordered our dinners, requested more bread for the table and I asked if we may have more butter. Finally, she presented us with 4 pads of butter, all the while looking at me contemptuously. \\nI asked her if she spoke French, as several at our table are French speakers. Her response, If Portland restaurants had to rely on French speaking staff there would be no one in business!\\nI had enough of her and went to the manager to complain. He was most gracious about the situation. Apologized and soon others were waiting on us.\\nThe food was OK. Certainly did not rise to the level of the many reviews I read about this restaurant. The duck bread and flank steak were tough and chewy. We decided not to complain because our celebration dinner had all ready been ruined by our rude waiter.\\n\\nIn reading a few reviews of Little Bird I see that others also complained about the rudeness of the wait staff.

We told him that we hadn't, and he seemed genuinely pleased that we were trying it out for the first time.

I've been to Anmol several times without much incident, however the last time I went to dine in their restaurant, I went with my Fiance who cannot have rice because of an allergy. We asked if they could substitute the normal side of rice that is given with a side of vegetables instead (that comes with several other meals). The waiter was very nice but he did not understand what we were asking for and then asked his manager. He came back and said that it was impossible. Since we didn't want to pay $14 for just chicken and sauce, I asked to speak with the manager personally. When I did, he refused to do this seemingly simple substitution. We didn't want to waste money and time and so we told him that it was fine, but we would have to dine elsewhere. We were the only two people in the restaurant and he welcomed us out the door. \\nTonight, we ordered takeout from Anmol (by the way they only delivery within Beverly). After waiting over an hour, a delivery person was here with our food, except Anmol had sent us four of everything that we had only ordered one of, and the price was crazy off. We informed the delivery person, and he said that Anmol does this frequently (they hire out a delivery service, it is not their own), and that they are the worst to work for. They forced him to go back to the restaurant, and we are now still waiting almost 2 hours after the initial order, for literally two dishes. \\n\\nIf you don't have any special requests or needs, chances are that you'll have an ok dining experience.

This time the food was missing a little seasoning, but I lend that to the fact that we arrived when brunch was coming to an end and everyone working that shift was just tired and ready to go home.

I visited tonight and we had reservations to sit at the bar. \\n\\nI want to comment on the service first, which was fantastic. One thing I noticed was that the premium omakase options all included bluefin tuna, which I try not to eat due to it being endangered (I'm a hippie I guess). The itamae was more than happy to accommodate my request to substitute out the bluefin tuna. He actually ended up giving me a couple of pieces of other fish in lieu of the bluefin tuna, as bluefin tuna is a pricier menu option! (I should note that if you do eat bluefin, the other people I visited with commented that it really did taste amazing). Chef Yoshiya Maruyama also did a great job of explaining each individual piece of nigiri and the differences between the fish he was serving us.\\n\\nAll of my omakase nigiri tasted great and fresh, definitely on par with some of my other favourite sushi restaurants, like Sushi Bar Maumi and Sushi by Yuji. The saba, big eyed tuna, and seabream were all fantastic. My personal favorite is the hotate, as it was garnished with a squeeze of lemon and okinawa sea salt. The wasabi levels in the individual nigiris was also perfect for me. We also tried the cold udon, which was really tasty! (We ordered two to share between four people, and they plated four separate half orders for us, which was another nice touch.)\\n\\nAnyway, this review has dragged on long enough, so in conclusion 5/5, will definitely be back.

Usually, like the hot chick with nothing intelligent upstairs, spots like these only have the views going for them, but not in a city like Portland where the standards are high and the clientele uncompromising. Even at this place, they need to step up their game in order to keep them coming back. \\n\\nNow, when I asked some Portlandians about this spot I got a little push back. The words used to describe it were ok, eh, and good enough, but sadly, no one was singing its praises. So I'm going to, because this place, while maybe mediocre by some Portlandian standards, is a damn good place to get a drink and enjoy a bite of food! \\n\\nI met some co-workers here and saddled up to the bar. I have started to make it a habit of surveying the ice situation when at a new place, and noticed they only used chips, so I ordered an Old Fashioned up. That might seem like a weird request to some, but I just don't like the ice diluting my drink. As it was, this cocktail seemed shaken, which is not proper, but it still tasted good. The early flight in had my really hungry, and I eyeballed the happy hour food menu and settled on the Kung Pao Calamari. The batter was really crunchy and stood up impressively well to the sweet, tangy, and slightly spicy sauce. The piece were large and tender, and it ate more like a meal than an appetizer. \\n\\nMy friends ordered the Ahi appetizer and the ribs, both of which were fantastic. The avocado wasabi puree with the ahi was a nice addition, but a little spicy, but these ribs were amazing! Clearly braised and then crisped,they fell right off the bone. The sauce was Asian inspired, and I'm pretty sure they put crack in it because all 4 of us could not stop talking about how we wanted more.\\n\\nThe bartenders, while they may not have known as much as other mixologists in this cocktail crazy town, were congenial and conversant, and they made the experience enjoyable.\\n\\nIf you're looking for a casual spot to gather with friends on a visit to Portland, or just find yourself wandering around and want to experience something outside of the PDX stereotype, this is a fun spot to stop into."},{"name":"Bondir Cambridge","address":"279A Broadway","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"A group of five of us went here on a Sunday night to celebrate a birthday.

Unfortunately, this didn't make up for the fact that there were no alternatives other than vegetarian if any of the fixed dishes weren't appealing.  The veggie option was also lacking though.

Our waitress was stiff with very fake politeness during the 3 times we saw her the entire meal (drinks, meal order and taking the check). We wern't too sure where else her attention was, since there wasn't really anyone else there, but she seemed more than happy to not interact with us. We did see someone who looked to be a manager a few times talking with a nearby party and clearing their table and yet it took us an extra 10 minutes to wave our waitress down once we had finished our meals.\\n\\nWe ordered the house salad (different than just a garden salad, cranberries and a heavy white balsamic dressing), the portebello ravioli (which would make you think of sauce or ravioli's with mushrooms in them, but no- 4 or so raviolis with alfredo sauce and a slice of mushroom on top) and the chicken oricchette pasta. I may have spelled that last one wrong, but it was probably the best thing we ordered out of the 3. Even with that, it had okay broccoli, dry-ish chicken, and very overdone on the sauce. Meh overall. Not to mention each of our pasta dishes were close to $20 a plate.\\n\\nOn top of everything, we looked up Phantom Gourmet's rating on the place (they advertise on the door) and within that article, they talked about how at the end of each meal, there's more or less a type of little loto where your waitress brings over a wine bottle of balls and if you draw a ball that has the same number as a number written on the bottom of your table's olive oil dispenser, then your meal is free.

Are you willing to wait a really long time to sit inside so you can order it? Are you willing to splurge a lot of money for it? If you said yes to all three questions, this place may have your answer. This place has been high on my list of restaurants to eat at in Boston and I finally found the right timing and opportunity to eat here. I took a friend to this place and here is what happened.\\n\\nWe arrived at the restaurant at around 7:45 PM on a Saturday night, hoping that there would be less people, since they do not take reservations. The server said to me that it is going to be a two hour wait. This place has broke the record for the longest time I had to wait to eat in a restaurant. My expectations for the food made a significant jump from really low, to extremely high as my friend and I thought of ways to kill time while waiting as I gave the waitress my cell phone number.\\n\\nAt around 9:55 PM we came back and a feeling of relief came when the waitress yelled out \\"AMBROSE?!\\" indicating that my friend and I got a spot to sit, even though it was at the bar. We quickly ordered the Maine Lobster Roll (both cooked with butter). Since I knew that I was not going to come back here for a long while, I also decided to order a piece of clam and a piece of oyster on the list and marked it.  \\n\\nThe clam and oyster I ordered were the Cherrystone Clam and Island Creek Oyster. They were served in a tray covered in ice and came with some sort of cocktail sauce. \\n\\nThe Cherrystone Clam was decently good. The meat in this clam was tasty due to the sauce and also had a nice juicy taste to it. \\n\\nI am not much of an oyster connoisseur, but I did not detect much of the fruity finish according to the description of the Island Creek Oyster. Although I had meatier and tastier oysters compared to eating the Island Creek Oyster, it was not disappointing at all. It was decently good, very soft and refined in terms of tastiness. I felt like a high class wealthy person as I held up the oyster and began to eat it.\\n\\nFinally, the Maine Lobster Roll. It arrived within a very short time frame, and it came with a huge pile of French Fries. As for the size of the Lobster Roll I would say that it is approximately 16 cm in length, but definitely under 30 cm using rough estimates. I took a piece of lobster from the roll and put it into my mouth. I closed my eyes and began to chew. My taste buds and palate communicated with me...\\n\\n\\"YUM YUM YUM! Buttery, tender and meaty deliciousness! MMMMM... MMMMM.... MMMMMM!!!!\\"\\n\\nYeah, my taste buds and palate experienced a feeling of jubilant rapture from the buttery flavor and the meaty tenderness of the lobster. It was probably the best cooked and most delicious lobster I have eaten. The bread was okay, tasted almost like a hot dog roll that you would get from a supermarket, but the tasty butter just made the bread five times tastier. As for the French Fries, they were pretty tasty with the right amount of softness and saltiness that made fries typically addicting to eat. They were not memorable fries, but definitely several steps above fries that you would get from Wendy's. Ketchup was also tasty as well. \\n\\nMy friend really loved the Lobster Roll here, and thought he had some of the best seafood here. However, he said that he would not have the lobster in a roll because he did not like the bread that much. As for service, it was okay, somewhat effective. I could see that my server was trying to be nice but he also seemed to be under a lot of pressure because he was handling so many people and orders. It does not appear to be easy working in one of the busiest restaurants in Boston so I was extremely nice to the people who work there.\\n\\nThe WC (means \\"Water Closet\\", another term for a lavatory) was small but decently clean. There is a quote on a giant mirror above the toilet by prominent American author Ernest Hemingway, so you can get a dosage of some Hemingway to read if that interests you while using the lavatory. \\n\\nOverall, this is one representation of Boston's food at its finest. If you are going to be in Boston for a short period of time, and you are looking for a very worthy restaurant to splurge, this is a strong candidate.

This is served with some of the best fries I've had in a while.  This was a huge surprise as they were just tossed on the side of the roll.

With 5 men, 2 lbs of brisket and 2 full rack of ribs should be enough for us. NOPE! WRONG! This place skimps out on the amount of food. Either they didn't give us the full 2 pounds of brisket, and/or 2 rack of ribs were from a baby pig. Let me just tell you, when we finish the food, we could have ordered two more rounds of the lone star. Disappointed on the amount of food. Now to the quality..\\n\\nBrisket - People that know BBQ, Brisket is where it's at. You rate BBQ places with their brisket!!! To my surprise, when we ordered the brisket, the server didn't ask us if we wanted the fatty or lean part of the brisket. I assumed we were going to be served what they had. Conclusion? Brisket was up to par in the PNW. It's hard to smoke great brisket around here, since the cold temperature we have outdoors. Fortunately, they served us the fatty portion of the brisket. The brisket was good, but wasn't the BEST I've had (Franklin's BBQ still holds the best). The fatty part of the brisket was tender, can taste the smoke and the dry rub. BBQ sauce was a good addition to the taste of the bbq, but you don't want to overdo it.\\n\\nRibs - Ribs were a disappointment. The rack of ribs were probably a pound each. You typically expect 2-3lbs of a full rack. The taste was amazing, flavored to perfection, smoked to perfection, but the amount was disgraceful. \\n\\nHot links - Not much to say, it was good. Only got to try the original, the guys jumped on the jalapenos before I did. \\n\\nMac&Cheese - Dry mac&cheese, don't expect the saucy kinds. Good \\nBaked Beans - Normal baked beans with some meat \\nPotato Salad - Homemade, was actually tasty, would come back for this \\nCloeslaw - Disappointment, don't ever get it. \\n\\nI would give them another shot since the brisket was decent.

Darwin's gives off a very hipster vibe without trying to be hipster, and the food is always freshly made and delicious. I'm reluctant to give a full five stars because the service isn't always the most organized.

There's a lot of confusion, especially when the lines are long and there are lots of people waiting. They generally call out your name when your order is ready and I definitely heard a lot of names being called repeatedly.\\n\\nI would recommend going if you're not in a rush or especially hungry, as the experience will prove to be frustrating.

I personally love the Hancock (smoked salmon, cream cheese, egg and onion, tomato).

I was tired of mostly fried bar food and weak attempts at ethnic food. The truth is however, that Boston's food scene has blossomed so much since then, that Neptune is simply not even close to the best place in town anymore. Let's break this down.\\n\\nBEVERAGES: Harpoon Munich Darks, at $8 a pour. A touch over-priced, but certainly not unseen, good start.\\n\\nOYSTERS: Between $2.50-$3.50 a piece. We made a point to avoid the local oysters you can get virtually everywhere in this city and were fairly adventurous, and loved one west coast oyster with a lingering cucumber finish. Even with the price tag, this is by far Neptune's best offering. After all, it is their namesake.\\n\\nENTREE 1: The hot buttered lobster roll. Sizeable? Yes. Worth $27 sizeable? No. I have zero problem with paying that kind of money for food, but when it is lauded as the best, it better satisfy. I've had better lobster rolls all over the city. This was a gigantic disappointment. I promise you I did not set myself up for disappointment, I always give myself a buffer when I eat food that is supposed to either really good or really bad. My mood tanked (no pun intended, my poor lobster friends) after trying it.\\n\\nENTREE 2: Scallops with duck confit. This was fairly good. The scallops were raw in the center, which we assumed they were meant to be, and ate them anyhow, which was fine. The gorgonzola sauce paired well with the duck scallop combo. \\n\\nLAST INSIGHTS: We didn't feel like dessert, and honestly felt slightly cheated by the experience. It's just not THAT good.

I had the Spicoli Scramble and my sister had the Loaded Bowl. We also each had a lemon ricotta pancake which were just OK, kinda bland. The pancakes were huge so we wish we ordered 1.

I'll wait for Toro because by some small miracle, no matter how jammed it is in there, I always seem to find a seat at the bar.  Neptune Oyster, on the other hand, I'll wait for because they had the brilliant idea to simply take your cell number and call you when your table is ready.  So you can stroll around the North End, admiring all the enormous men in tiny hats with giant cigars and lost tourists wearing \\"Cheers\\" t-shirts asking you where the Freedom Trail is. Sure beats the hell out of standing in a hot crowded sweaty hallway waiting for a table.\\n\\nThe food here is honestly the best seafood in Boston.  This is no exaggeration, and I'm not misusing the word \\"literally\\" when I say it is literally the best.  I've lived in this city for my entire life and have tried them all, repeatedly, just to be sure.  This is seafood nirvana in a tiny storefront on Salem Street, people.  The oyster shuckers are three women from a landlocked town in Colombia who were imported by the restaurant specifically for their oyster-shucking prowess.  They were recently written up in Boston Magazine as a matter of fact... wait... right here:\\n\\nhttp://www.bostonmagazine.com/restaurants/articles/raw_talent/\\n\\nThis may be the only restaurant on Earth that I do not even know if they offer dessert, because I've never been interested enough to bother finding out.

This is a monumental admission from a clinical chocoholic such as myself.  Trust me, you'll regret nothing at all about a visit to Neptune Oyster.

My understanding is that most good restaurants have a wait downtown. There were so many great-looking options, so I got some feedback from the very helpful and knowledgable bartender (sorry I forgot her name but she was cute and had a nose ring).  I went with the grilled octopus and half a grilled artichoke to start. Both were fantastic choices. The octopus came with some of the most delicious smashed olives I ever had. The grilled artichoke was paired with a perfect garlic aioli. For my main course I went with the wagyu skirt and a side of spinach. The meat was delicious, tender, and of course, cooked to perfection. The nuts in the spinach really made the side.  The mixologist made some killer margaritas.

This visit being reviewed was actually a one star.\\n\\nMy family was hosting a large out-of -town family gathering and decided on Hungry Soul Cafe, based on a review from a well-known food critic. I emailed them and was pleased with their quick and friendly response. I fully explained our needs  by email and then visited them with my husband late morning on Sunday, July 19th on a recon visit. We were pleased with the food, the menu, the service and were able to speak with both Anita and George in person about our needs. We felt comfortable with their understanding of and ability to accommodate our gluten free guests and we set up our visit, with me sending emails with details.\\n\\nAnd here's where I will begin my caution at recommending Hungry Soul Cafe for these types of need. We arrive with our party of 16 at 9:55 am  for a 10 am reservation and watched as another large party was seated in the area we had requested. The restaurant was prepared for our large party too, but we were placed right by the busy front door, instead of the two other large party areas further back in the restaurant that had a lovely view of Downtown. (After we were seated and ordered,  a third large party also arrived). Despite having communicating the gluten concerns in emails and in person, we were given a waitress who couldn't explain the gluten free items on the menu (HSC, as do many restaurants, don't print a separate GF menu, but during conversations with Anita, I was assured she had trained her staff in GF) We asked for Anita, and she came over and explained our GF choices. My GF family members were super excited to learn Anita could do GF french toast and ordered that. Ten minutes after placing the order, they were informed that she hadn't purchased GF bread after all and could they make another choice. They chose omelets, as I had done. Then we were informed that the kitchen was backed up and asked whether the food come out in stages. We all agreed. My food came out first....with two pieces of wheat toast on top. I had ordered my omelet GF. I handed the toast to my husband and informed the waitress that was fine, BUT the other GF food MUST NOT be cross-contaminated as celiac disease causes severe gastrointestinal problems and they were flying later in the afternoon. I was going to be going home to my own bathroom. ( And my family members were very embarrassed that we had to explain this to the waitress.) The food arrived at the table in dibs and drabs, with two people accepting something other than what they had ordered so they could finally eat. During all of this, Anita (we never saw George) did not visit our table. We had to ask for refills on coffee and water. Finally, at 11:45 am, with planes to catch and our only waitress beginning to bring the food out to the third large party, we asked for our bills, paid immediately and left. No one in our party was impressed with the food, the service or the view. And I was particularly disappointed, as I had put considerable effort into communication with the owners and planning the visit."},{"name":"Jake's Ice Creams & Sorbets","address":"660 Irwin St","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"the service was not friendly.

Buffet offerings include: green chili Mac and cheese, fried chicken, eggs, bacon, sausage, enchiladas, salads, dessert, biscuits and gravy, fruit, etc.  A loss of stars because service can sometimes not be great, and the buffet will run out of items and it takes time for things to get refilled, inconsisteny on taste of food, crowded."},{"name":"Joey D's Oak Room","address":"1015 Crown Pointe Pkwy","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"As I had seen the large neon restaurant sign from the road many times on my way to work, it was a family member that had mentioned actually trying this place out.

Based on recommendations, we chose Rosa Mexicana and sat on the patio overlooking the Central Park. It was a nice setting, although the bugs were a problem. I can't blame the restaurant for that, but it was annoying to constantly swat flies away from our food and drinks during our whole meal. And, there were a ton of those small brown \\"parking lot\\" birds hopping around near our table and all around the patio.\\n\\nWe got our complimentary chips and salsa, and worked on those while we read through the menu. The flavors of the green salsa were good, but the dish it was served in was problematic. It didn't have a high edge or lip for scooping the salsa onto the chip, and it kept overflowing onto the table. But, the table is that metal wicker stuff, with all the holes in it, which meant it fell to the ground and we risked getting it on our clothes. They really should consider serving it on a small dish to avoid this problem in the future.\\n\\nBecause neither of us were especially hungry, we decided to split an entree: the Tampiquena de Carne Ascada. They marinate a skirt steak in tequila and other stuff, then serve it rajas con crema, guacamole, and a small cheese enchilada covered in a red sauce. It was a really good dish, but our steak was overcooked. It came out well done instead of medium like we specified. \\n\\nWe told our server, and within a few minutes, a manager came out and talked to us. He offered to cook us another steak, but we honestly wouldn't have eaten it. We had gotten through a good portion of the dish we already had, and that was after the chips and salsa.

When we got there around 7:15 p.m. the place was full and so we thought it's a good sign! It was a fairly small but cozy and clean place. A little too small for a gathering for parties of 8-10 I thought.\\n\\nThe complimentary chips and slasa were decent (NOT GREAT!). The chips were at times little overdone! Salsa was too tomatoey for my taste.\\n\\nThe majority of the Men on the table ordered the Efrain's. The reason behind that can only be found once you read the description on the menu! It surely lived up to it's spice rating of 9.65 on a scale of 10!!! A burrito large enough to feed an average man for two meals smothered with hellishly hot sauce! It was an adventure for all of us to devour the whole plate.\\n\\nSome other items that we ordered were a steak (good), Soup (not good), chicken enchilada (too sweet for my wife!), margarita's (we have had better in texas near the border!), Sopapillas (very good!)\\n\\nService was good and prompt. Price was dirt cheap for a place like Boulder!\\n\\nIf I happen to be in the area, I might drop in again if I'm too hungry.

While they have amazing sounding food, they seem to nickel and dime you for everything.  I'm not a big fan of that camp.  At.  All.  My perception is this, you're basically getting 4 star hotel quality food outside of a hotel but with the hotel food $$$.  $9 for 2 eggs, potatoes and toast?  $2-3 extra for a protein?  GTFO.  I had an omelet and my friend and I shared their french toast.  The omelet was A-Ok.  It was literally like an omelet station omelet at a nice hotel.  One that's included in the $15 price of a buffet.  I'm a huge sucker for sweets, so naturally I was looking forward to the french toast.  Seeing the bake case upon entering the restaurant had raised my hopes.  Boy oh boy, was I let down.  It was really just OK.  The bread was thin sliced sandwich bread, they said sourdough but there was no way of really knowing.  Honestly, the highlight of my meal was my cup of coffee.

Upon returning to the Park Plaza I surveyed the neighborhood and resigned myself to eat at Legal Seafood (just some fish and white wine I kept telling myself, how can they screw that up?).  As I was walking toward the door a couple passed me and I overheard this comment:  \\"I have been tricked into going to Legal Seafood three times and each time it sucked\\"....This was a message to go forth and find dinner.  \\n\\nI started walking through the Theatre District and then passed the common without purpose when it hit me, I was heading to North End and a return to Neptune Oyster.  And I was rewarded.\\n\\nSitting at the bar with cordial service (not cloying but friendly enough) and  a good local ale I started with a grilled sardine, yes one large grilled sardine, over a slice of pancetta with wedge of iceberg lettuce and blue cheese dressing and did it work.  The main was a local bass over a perfect succotash (fresh peas, green beans, and a touch of pancetta) topped with a light vinaigrette.  Every ingredient shined and the flavors weren't buried by unnecessary saucing.\\n\\nReally enjoyed the glass of brocheto (I think that is what they called it) for dessert, a slightly sweet Italian sparkler and walked home to the hotel a happy satisfied customer.\\n\\nI can't agree more with the other reviewers, this place a gem and the third time was the charm.

Got to sit next to wife, always a plus, clam chowder was very good lots of clams and agree with Jenny, the home made oyster crackers were great.  I also agree that $3 a shrimp is very steep as was the chowder ($11).  Still the oysters were wonderful and we left full and content although I admit as someone not from the area the lobster roll (hot) left me confused.  The brioche was knockout though.\\nLunch was equally pricey, I was stunned at the $10 fruit/champagne cocktails, not the quality but the price of these drinks.    The chowder at lunch was a bit salty and while I could forgive it at a lesser price for that money the chowder has to be perfect.

Also, the bar staff were nice and made my margarita in no time. If you're coming simply for drinks and music, have at it.\\n\\nThe bad: everything else. I came at about 8:30 and it wasn't too busy yet. There were only three people in line ahead of me. After deciding on my order I got in line and waited...and waited.....and waited. I waited so long that the people in front of me had gotten their orders made and paid for them before I even reached the front. Still, no one behind the counter even made eye contact with me. Keep in mind I've now been standing there for approximately 15 minutes and no one has even attempted to speak to me, even once it was my turn to order. After ringing up the people in front of me, the guy behind the counter simply walked away, got his stuff, and went home. Look, I've worked in a restaurant myself. I understand wanting to clock off and get out of there, but not when there's a customer standing right there and no one to take your place. I waited there at the register for ANOTHER five minutes before finally a woman came over to speak to me. In this time, a man had walked up to the counter -behind me- and placed his order with no problems. So understandably, I was a little peeved. Finally she came over and asked if I need to be rung up. I said, \\"Actually I still need to order.\\" She acted as if this was absurd, but took my order nonetheless. I got a taco salad with carne asada. I paid and went to the bar to get a margarita before the food was ready (see \\"the good\\").\\n\\nAfter getting my drink (it's now been 20 minutes since I got in line), I returned to the food counter, but alas, no taco salad. That's fine, I though. So I set my drink down at my table and waited around for a few minutes before returning to the food counter. Once again, I waited to be acknowledged. Finally the same woman looked up, said \\"oh\\" and turned her attention to my taco salad still sitting on the make line. She finished it up, passed it towards me, and here's the kicker, attempted to charge me again. Ha. Look, it was made very apparent to me that the staff give ZERO shits about me as a customer, but the least you can do is remember that I already paid.\\n\\nSo, after that 25-minute train wreck of an ordering process, you'd at least expect the taco salad to be delicious right? Wrong. I am not exaggerating when I tell you that I prefer the taco salads in my college's cafeteria to the meal I ate last night. It was neither good nor bad - it was too bland to tell the difference. It lacked any and all flavor that may have made it the least bit enjoyable. And gee, it would have been nice to eat it like a normal salad, but alas, they were out of utensils. So I was forced to break off little pieces of shell and eat the entire sad thing with my hands.\\n\\nIn sum, I can't really think of a worse food experience.

I am originally from San Diego and would consider myself a serious foodie. However, I was shocked at the quality and speed at which the kitchen cranked out absolutely amazing, well balanced and overall near perfect dishes. \\n\\nThe first day we tried a selection of their bloody mary's of which they have several kinds and are ALL delicious and the mix is completely from scratch which is hard to find these days as many people sacrifice speed for taste. (p.s. order it with a skinny james, their homemade slim jim that will change your life). For starters we had their biscuits and gravy which is a dish they only have on the weekends which left us both wanting to lick the plate. We then split the bim bop with an extra side of their spicy sauce they put in the bowl (I like spicy, it was delicious without it but I put hot sauce on everything). The bowl was perfectly prepared and such a fun dish to share as it comes out in a super hot bowl and must be immediately stirred to mix the contents before eating. \\n\\nOur second day of course we got bloody mary's again! For our starter this time we tried an amazing dish I hadn't ever had before called a Radicchio salad that had an amazing avocado dressing, a 6 minute egg perfectly cooked, and bits of pork belly. We also ordered a side of something called Beef Bacon that was cooked perfectly. I love bacon and am quite picky but if I could have that for breakfast every day I most certainly would. Lastly we ordered their french board which came with a delicious side salad, a delicious soft cheese (can't remember the name of it for the life of me), mustard, olives, seared foie gras, fresh sliced baguette and a house made pate. \\n\\nDespite already being full from our other dishes, there was nothing left on any of our plates during both visits.

This is what you'd think of as a \\"back of a bar college restaurant.\\"  First off, I know it is off season being summer time and all but wow was the service under par.  For starters I had to wipe down my own table, which is no big deal if the place is slammed but there was only one other couple there eating and it was dead slow.  What exactly is the staff here doing?  Also the place was out of at least half of their menu items, which we thought was bizarre since this is a newly opened restaurant.  I started with a beer, which for some reason is separate from food transactions so then I had to wait for the bartender to come back from wherever he was to get my card to charge me on a separate register for the food.  This just seemed to be inefficient, oh and I ended up paying for the beers with cash because the two transactions weren't merged and the bar has a $10 minimum for credit cards.  Overall, the food was decent and decently priced - nothing that really blew us away.  Like other reviews said, it is recommended to get at least 3 items for one person and the steak skewers were the best of what was available to try.  After the meal we ordered some mochi ice creams, which came frozen hard.  We were trying to cut the mochis in half so everyone could try the flavors, but they only had flimsy plasticware available.  We asked the kitchen for a knife, to which a staffer said, \\"just wait for them to defrost and use your hands.\\"  Definitely a college bar food place.  Would not recommend taking a date here.

I know you are the sister restaurant of Le Pigeon so I had to also TRY you out! I came here one Friday evening for dinner with a visiting friend. We did not make reservations, but we were happy to be accommodated to sit at the bar to dine. (Next time I'll make a reservation! I promise!) We were welcomed with a warm smile from our bar tender/waiter who served us a mean drink called the \\"Antoinette\\" (a Vodka based drink we chose off of your menu). And it did not disappoint because we ordered a couple more of these thereafter. \\n\\nWe came in with an empty stomach because we knew we wanted to come here hungry, enjoy the food and have time to chat to catch up. (Which we did!) We were SO hungry (literally), our bartender forewarned us: \\"You know this will be a lot of food for just two people!\\" \\n\\nAnd our reply was: \\"I know!\\" (because in the back of our mind, it wasn't the first time that someone has said that before to us and we were okay with that!) Because we knew what we were getting ourselves into.\\n\\nAppetizer: STEAMED MUSSELS WITH GARLIC BREAD were phenomenal. The mussels were cleaned very well (no sand in site!) Better yet, the meat from the mussels were \\"ginormous\\" (and \\"that's what she said!\\"). The broth to this mixture complimented the mussels that my friend just wanted to drink it as a soup on its own. I hope that says a lot to you. \\n\\nEntrees:\\nLE PIGEON BURGER was split in half for us to devour. It was cooked medium rare to our liking and filled with the usual burger fixings. It was quite tall and to fit a burger into one bite was an obstacle, yet just eating the darn thing was amazing! This came with a side of French fries, which went well with the burger. \\n\\nPORK SHOULDER had just the right amount of salt in it!

I was also rebuffed by the crowds at 4 other promising downtown spots (no doubt more crowded than usual by others displaced by the closed places.)\\nAs a result, I was walking around the lower-Pearl/OldTown/upper-downtown area, beginning to despair of getting any dinner at all. \\nNo amount of sidewalk Yelp app usage was turning up any promising leads.  I started walking in the general direction of a low-rent place that I knew would be able to feed me, when I turned a corner and looked up to see the sign for Little Bird.  \\n\\"No effing way\\", I said to myself. I had just read about the opening of this new Gabriel Rucker venture on Eater PDX and was intrigued, but figured that it would be packed on its first week open.  They didn't have anyone waiting outside, so I decided to peek in.  The bar wasn't even half full! I snagged a bar seat as quickly as I could and chuckled to myself for a good minute over my good luck."},{"name":"Luke's Lobster Back Bay","address":"75 Exeter Street","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Arrived on Friday night and immediately tried this spot close to our hotel.

The combination of spicy meat, crunchy vegetables, and crusty bread is delicious!  They also add some balsamic vinegar to it.  Mmmmm.  The workers are great and very personable.  The shop also carries a variety of other foods in their deli case and other Italian specialties.  As you walk around the corner to the register there is homemade pasta and sauce.

Our friends put in their name on a Friday night (around 3pm) and finally got a table around 730pm.  The good thing, though, is that the hostess will call your cell phone when your table is ready -- you just need to be nearby in the North End to claim it.  On the other hand, my wife and I showed up around 11:15am on a Sunday morning (15 minutes before it opened) and were able to get a seat at the bar right at 11:30.  I would think that the first 40 people in line were able to get seats at a table or bar.  For a different perspective, a regular customer said that weekday afternoons are not crowded and don't have any wait.  But if you do have a wait, then just post up at a local bar in the North End and enjoy the wait.  The point is: don't be intimidated by a line or long wait, just be flexible with your schedule.\\n\\nThe food is really fantastic here.  They have a wide variety of oysters that are priced about $2-3 each.  While we opted for the hot lobster roll, we saw some fantastic food being served around the restaurant.  The scallops looked awesome.  And the steak tartare looked great too.\\n\\nOur lobster roll (yes, $29) was phenomenal and loaded with lobster meat in a fresh bun.  The bun is lightly grilled/toasted and catches lots of the melted butter which makes for a delicious bite -- fresh lobster meat with buttery bread.  So good.  \\n\\nOn this particular Sunday, their special of the day was two lobster tacos ($36) that were served on corn tortillas.  The regular customer who we met at the bar ordered the taco special and he loved it.\\n\\nThe waitstaff are friendly and let you enjoy your meal -- even though there are dozens of people trying to get a table. \\n\\nThere are some draft beers ($7.50) and some good wine options too.\\n\\nFigure to spend at least $50-$75 per person for food and a few drinks here.

I'd take them out dancing, tell them how they sparkle in the light, tell them all the luscious things I want to do with them...\\n\\nLike eat them excessively.  And tell them how HUGE THEY ARE (which is good, because everybody wants a piece, if you know what I mean...how could you not know what I mean?).  The chips are made fresh, the chicken is delicious and there's this yummy bbq type sauce that they put on (amongst the sour cream, and other deliciousness)\\n\\nLuckily, I never go to Local alone and thus encounter no shortage of hands playing grab a** with this cherished dish, after all I DO have to keep a moderately appropriate figure.  They're a little on the expensive side at about $18 but like I said huge, so I usually do a threeway...er...split three ways.\\n\\nAnd speaking of other people, Local is an always place to go with a rowdy bunch.  Whether you want to play \\"guess the pictures\\" in the caps of the Mickey's beers, watch a game from any of massive TVs, or chill out on the patio.  It's basically like cheers, only trendier, full of more good looking people, and well, I'm not sure anyone actually knows my name - though the wait staff is always amazing when I'm there.

They serve a warm salsa (which, sorry guys, is gross enough to begin with but coupled with the fact that it's like a mixture of spaghetti sauce and salsa it borders on disgusting...and I'm not a picky eater but mamma takes her salsa seriously).  The waitress told me some people love it, but I live in a world where some people lie in dating profiles so really, some people are ridiculous.  Say no to warm salsa. \\n\\nAll in all, Local is an awesome place to go and hang out.  Just remember if you go on a Friday or Saturday night it can get really packed with drunk 20 somethings and if that's not your scene, make sure you get a booth (you won't even notice them) but do not I REPEAT, do not sit at the tall boy tables because drunk people don't respect boundaries and you're liable to go to the washroom and come back to find you the current is flowing against you and someone is rudely lounging in your chair."},{"name":"Neptune Oyster","address":"63 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Upon conducting research on places to eat while I was in Boston, I determined this was a place I absolutely had to try.

Separately, the brussel sprouts were overpowered by the acidity of the lemon. The polenta, on the other hand, was under seasoned but this allowed for the taste of the polenta itself to show through. Eaten together the acidity in the brussel sprouts was cut by the creaminess of the polenta making for a pleasant, but underwhelming dish.\\n\\nFor the pizza we decided on the fennel sausage. Unfortunately, this was another underwhelming dish. When I got a bit of cheese, I enjoyed the cheese. The sausage was good, but nothing to write home about. The greens could use some chopping as they were difficult to but through and would come off in a mess. I don't feel this pie warranted the $18 price tag. The marinara we asked for dipping our crust in, and who wouldn't, was more like watery pur√©ed tomatoes rather than a thick, well seasoned, sauce.\\n\\nOverall, the meal was good, but not memorable.

Thankfully the manager was nice enough to seat us together but it was after a dozen requests for the hostess.  \\n\\nOne person had a severe allergy and was there before most of the group arrived. He asked the waitress what he could order, given his serious allergy.  She gave him 3 options and he immediately ordered 2 out of the 3.  He also ordered a few things to get us started.  Once we arrived and sat down, we ordered a lot of food. The waitress told us it was a lot which was very nice, so we reduced the order, but it was never reduced.  When extra items started coming out we explained that we had canceled some of the items at time of order, but they said no and kept bringing stuff.  All would have been ok but after waiting over 45 min, the person with the allergy still had not gotten one thing after they had brought at least 20 items to our table.  At that time, the waitress came up and said one of the items he ordered 45 min earlier could not be made per his pepper allergy.

That being said it was sort of over-whelming and hard to navigate around. But people like myself who LOVE food will really appreciate this place.\\nThey have a huge selection of everything. They also have a lot of refrigerated take-home meals that looked yummy. All of the meats/cheeses/seafood looked really fresh, and all of those departments were huge/had great display. The stuff in the bakery looked delicious and fresh. I don't even like sweets and I wanted one of the muffins... They looked that good.\\nI was REALLY looking forward to the cafe as it was my initial reason for coming here. Yeah, they do have a BUNCH of food and you can fill up a container with whatever you want, but the food looked like it had been sitting out for a while, and they charge $8.99/lb. Not really worth it IMO. The pizza was great though, I'll give them that.\\nAs for the prices... Some things were about the same price as Market Basket or a lot more expensive. The meat & seafood prices were crazy expensive. However, a gallon of Wegmans brand milk was on sale for $2.19, and I know that Market Basket milk never has/never will go on sale, and it is even getting more expensive. I thought that was interesting. Goldfish and Chips Ahoy were also on sale for prices cheaper than MB's sale prices... so that's good to know.\\nI will stay grocery shopping at Market Basket, just for it's simplicity, but props for Wegmans for being interesting."},{"name":"Gaslight Lynnfield","address":"1100 Market St","city":"Lynnfield","stars":"3.5","text":"Really enjoyed it.

The restaurant is much larger than the midtown location.  There are big communal tables in the bar area which are nice for playing games.  The rustic decor was warm and welcoming.  I arrived on a saturday night.  It was moderately busy.  The hostess seated us at a table by the entrance.  Since it was a very cold night, I felt the draft every time the door opened.  I requested another table.  I could see a handful that were available and there was no wait, so they were not being held for other parties.  I was informed that those tables were unavailable because the server assigned to them was not working.  I was confused by this.  Did the restaurant limit patron seating based on server availability?  Why couldn't our assigned server bring drinks one table over.  It's not like she was intruding on another server's territory when that person wasn't even working.  I understand it was not the hostess' fault, so I took her recommendation and moved to the bar.  The bartender was pleasant.  I appreciated that they used real smoked wood to flavor the old fashioneds.  The duck nachos were not what i envisioned nachos to be.  They were 3 individual round crisps with the described toppings.  I was disappointed because i was hoping to have the more traditional heaping pile of nachos.  The nachos tasted delicious though and i enjoyed the balance between the sweet and spicy flavors.  The pork egg rolls were okay.  The pretzel appetizer came with two small soft pretzels with cheese dipping sauce.  Overall, i thought the food was disappointing in regards to the portion size and price.

The person who answered the phone was the same that would be our server. She said if we came now we'd be good because there were tables available. When we got there not 10 minutes later, one of the servers said it would be a 45 minute wait. I informed him that I just called and was told we would have a table and eventually she came to our rescue. I was just a little puzzled by how the only 2 people waiting tables could have such different stories on table availability and wait time.

The Pinot Gris and Pino Grigio have without question, become my favorite white wine.\\n\\nThe server was very helpful with the menu as she so eloquently rattled off the night's special, true cod elegantly adorned with all the usual extras, including what I think was a horseradish sauce. I had the wild Alaskan Coho salmon which could have been excellent had it not been overcooked. My mate complained about the same thing with the true cod and for that reason we were both disappointed. Somehow, I don't think I should have to ask for my salmon, or any other kind of fish, to be undercooked. I would complain even more and louder if not for the 50% off ScoutMob. We ended up with a really good deal with only a marginal value.\\n\\nI guess one of the most disappointing aspects of the evening was that the server, nice as she was, did not come back to the table to check on us. Would I have complained? Probably not. Being the passive-aggressive type, I came home and did this instead. Keeping in mind when you are considering the world of professional restaurant serving, this is the greatest faux pas that anyone could ever commit.

We were told it'd take an hour and a half and we'd get a call when the table was ready. Not a problem. So we went down the street to kill time over martinis.\\n\\nAn hour passes. Okay. An hour fifteen. An hour and a half. Hmm. We're starving at this point so we walk back and check the status in person since the table shouldn't take much longer.\\n\\nThe dark-haired hostess: \\"Oh, we tried calling but nobody picked up.\\" Wait, what? We were all waiting for the phone to ring the entire time. Our call logs show nothing. We checked the number on the hostess' sheet and there was nothing wrong with what was written down. \\"I'm so sorry, we'll get you seated as soon as possible.\\" At this point, we were annoyed, a little cranky from hunger -- but these things happen so fine, we'd wait a little more. The food was worth it, right? Another 25-35 minutes of waiting. There was a table of 8 being cleared in front of us so we figured it wouldn't be much longer. \\n\\nThe table opens up. And the hostess seats another group.\\n\\n!!!\\n\\nI haven't written a Yelp review in over two years. I'm all about being understanding and waiting my turn, but seriously, how bad of a hostess do you have to be to think it's okay to seat another group. It's been a month and a half since this happened so this isn't a mindless gut reaction. But I'm still pissed thinking about it, angry enough to come out of \\"Yelptirement.\\" When you fuck up the seating for a group that's been waiting 2+ hours, \\"we'll get you seated as soon as possible\\" doesn't mean seating another group when a table opens up. They've been waiting? Yeah and we've been waiting almost 3 hours. Don't offer to call when tables are ready if you're not going to call! If you're going to prioritize people who wait at the restaurant the entire time, then say so and we'll be happy to loiter around the front door and block traffic with all the other waiters. And don't lie about calling us when you clearly forgot to do so.\\n\\nFuck everything about this hostess."},{"name":"Fish Grotto","address":"1035 SW Stark St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Over the past year, and three visits, the Fish Grotto seems to have consistently degenerated from an easy four stars down to this rating of two.  Originally it was an awesome environment with great food and outstanding service.  Since then the wait time for entrees was long, but acceptable for a romantic dinner.  On the most recent visit, however, the timing between courses was crazy, as our table was overloaded with salads and starters delivered at the same time, only to then wait an extremely long time for the over-salted and mediocre entrees. The wait staff was unresponsive to our requests, and it really bugs me when I have to ask my fellow diners if they would like anything to drink because the server has failed to.

My girlfriend and I came here on our anniversary to celebrate and were seated reasonably quickly.  They do have a wrap around deck that was nice to walk around on while we waited for our table.  The manager greeted me at one point, which was a nice touch.  We had let the restaurant know ahead of time that it was our anniversary and to our surprise, our menus had \\"Happy Anniversary\\" printed on them.  My girlfriend loved this.  We order a couple drinks and then we both order the Filet Mignon and lobster tail.  Our food took a while to come, but when it did it was fantastic.  The lobster was the best I've had outside of Maine and the steak was cooked perfectly.  The side of potatoes was meh, but the steak/lobster made up for it.  While eating, the Magic Kingdom fireworks show was happening and the restaurant played the music from the show as it went on.  You are actually able to watch the fireworks from the restaurant, which made for a really romantic, dare I say \\"magical\\" night.  The dessert was good and they even surprised us with complimentary champagne!  The night would have been perfect if it was not for our waiter.  For a place like Narcoossee's, we expected much better service.  He acted like he didn't care that much and was never around when we needed him.  If we weren't just enjoying the night we would have been extremely disappointing, but we weren't in a hurry so it didn't ruin things.  This place is really expensive, but I think our experience made up for it.  \\n\\nBeware the random neon lighted sea creatures that appear in the lake next to the restaurant.

I got a lobster roll and a lobster bisque special soup I believe it was.  \\n\\nThe lobster roll actually amazed me, it had totally intact claw meat, almost making me second guess if it could be real it looked so perfect.  Curious how they managed to get it out of the shell like that.  The lobster soup I found had generous portions of lobster and was quite good.

Knowing that the lines here are ridiculous later in the evening, we thought we'd go for dinner first and then when it was time to shake our tailfeathers, we'd already be inside.  Suckers!  Our plan worked, thankfully, and after our meal we were able to head right down for some dancing.  \\n\\nAt 7:30 pm, the restaurant was empty except for us and one other party.  Two of our revelers this evening had arrived early and were already seated.  Unbeknownst to them, I had arrived with two addtional revelers, so we needed a table for five.  We received mild attitude from the hostess when we said we'd actually be five.  Whatever, chickie poo.  There's nobody in the restaurant, so what do you care?  Kind of weird that instead of moving us to a bigger table, she brought an extra chair and placed it on the outside of the booth.  Meh!  Anyways, after sourpuss hostess, our server for the evening was very nice.  \\n\\nThe food is pretty generic bar food--wings, nachos, burgers, sandwiches, a couple salads.  If you're trying to eat remotely healthfully, look elsewhere.  Since I was saving my calories for booze, I tried to be good and got the organic turkey burger and subbed out fries for a side salad for slight upcharge.  The turkey burger was very dry, but I won't hold that against them too much.  I mean, you have no choice but to cook turkey well done, so it can be a challenge to keep it at all moist.  My friend who had less need to be health conscious (i.e., she's skinny) said her medium rare burger with extra cheese was oustanding.  \\n\\nThe cocktails are an interesting breed here.  One dining companion got a cosmopolitan and remarked, \\"Oh, so this is what cranberry juice tastes like!\\"  I tried it and yes, it was weak.  Looking for something stronger, he ordered a vodka martini which tasted like nothing but vermouth.  I stuck to red wine that evening and they pour a decent glass at a reasonable price.  The wine list isn't extravangant, but I don't think this place exactly has a sommelier on staff.\\n\\nMoving on the booty-shaking portion of the evening, I love the basement dance area.  If you plan on going down there, get there early to avoid the second line inside.  The basement reaches capacity quickly and they have additional bouncers inside controlling access to the dancefloor.  They play a good mix of current pop and songs that'll make you say, \\"Oh wow!  I rememeber this song!\\"  The crowd seems to be pretty much early 20's, but I didn't feel our group of late 20's to mid 30's people was terribly out of place.  The bar area downstairs is a bitch to navigate, but remember that if you try to go upstairs to get a drink, you'll have to wait in line to get back down.  Oh, and it gets HOT downstairs.  The AC system does little to keep the majority of the room cool, but if you stake out a spot on the dance floor near the vents, it's not too bad.  \\n\\nIn summary, ok, but nothing special food, but a good place to reclaim your youth and dance like a fool."},{"name":"The Thurman Cafe","address":"183 Thurman Ave","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"I've been living in Columbus this summer on business, and stopped by the much-talked about Thurman's for the first time this week. To be honest, I was anticipating a little bit of a letdown. The famed Thurman Burger had been featured on Man v. Food in December 2008, and was known largely for being, well, an enormous burger. So would it be equally as tasty as it is big? Would it be a little overrated? \\n\\nLuckily, it tastes pretty darn good, too, and easily one of the best burgers I've tried. The burger is incredibly juicy. The ham combined with mozzarella and American cheese is like having a sandwich squeezed in the middle of it -- a really unique flavor for a burger. And the sauteed mushrooms and onions take the cake. It's a ton of stuff jammed between two buns, but all work well together. Really just a tremendous burger.\\n\\nGranted, this burger probably isn't for everyone. It is enormous. But if you want a big and incredibly tasty burger, do stop by here if you live in or are passing through central Ohio."},{"name":"Kamei Royale Japanese Restaurant","address":"1066 W Hastings","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"After my boyfriend and I got out of school, we promptly packed up our bags and made a 10-hour road trip to Vancouver to make our week-long escape to see a concert that we have been much anticipating for months.  A native to Calgary (born and raised baby!) our little city definitely does not compare to Vancouver.  Accordingly to many people, sushi in Vancouver is amazing where I absolutely was wanting to go out for Japanese food.\\n\\nAfter a failed first attempt dining at a crappy Japanese restaurant, we both made a long hard search for a restaurant that was decently priced and within walking distance from our hotel.  Unfortunately my boyfriend who does not have much knowledge about Japanese cuisine decided to pick Kamei Royale because he didn't like my choices as they were vegan restaurants and he needs to have his beef or chicken.  I wish he hadn't picked it where I secretly blame him for his choice (jk boyfriend...elephant shoe!!!).\\nThe restaurant upon first appearances was nice and warm where you have to take an escalator ride up to enter.  We were warmly greeted by the hostess and then promptly seated in a nice comfortable booth.  And unfortunately that's about as good as the dinner got for me and him.  After ordering from a rather dysfunctional looking menu as it looked like a collage of pictures and words mish-mashed together I settled on salmon sashimi, and some rolls whereas my boyfriend got the beef yakisoba dish.\\n\\nThe food was meh...hence the 3 star rating.  The sashimi was nicely presented and had a great vibrant flavour from the lemon garnish.  The rolls were okay tasting but they fell apart the moment you touch them.  So I had to eat them with my hands...so much for trying to look pretty while eating like a caveman.  My boyfriend who got the yakisoba preferred Japanese restaurants in Calgary as they apparently have better flavour for a cheaper price. \\nWhat really turned me off was the pricing of the food.  Perhaps it was because its a downtown restaurant, but while the rolls were dead cheap, the sashimi was double the price than to what I get in Calgary.....not impressed.  I my as well have bought a big slab of fish in a marketplace and eat it raw for the same price.\\n\\nOverall not impressed with the restaurant where I would definitely not return should I ever visit Vancouver again.  Based on this review, I think I'll stick to my local favourite in in Calgary for my sushi fix where the food is slightly cheaper but 10 times yummier than this place.

On a Sunday at 12:30, it was packed, but it didn't feel too crowded or noisy. Brunch is my favorite meal of any, so I hold the bar high - but, because I love it so much, I almost always find something I like and end up really satisfied. This is the kind of place I may need to try another menu item or two before rating it any higher than decent. I had the buttermilk biscuits and gravy with an order of butternut squash soup on the side. The biscuits were pretty good, but there are so many places in the south where you can get amazing biscuits, and these didn't live up to some of the best. The squash soup was alright, but lacked spice and flavor. \\n\\nThe atmosphere was great - they had live music playing in the main room where we sat, and the guy playing acoustic guitar was very good. It didn't feel too loud or busy due to the layout and good use of space.\\n\\nUnfortunately our service was subpar. Our server forgot my friend's glass of prosecco she had ordered (which I heard her order and the server acknowledge), and when my friend followed up with our server about it, the server grunted how she never heard her order that and walked away. The prosecco came shortly after, but we were all left surprised at how rude she had been. Her attitude was like that throughout our time there, and we didn't see a single smile or a \\"thanks for coming\\" from her at all. \\n\\nOverall for my visit, I give it a 4 for atmosphere, 3 for food and a 1 or 2 for service. I might be back, but mainly because it's a perfect central location for meeting up with my best girlfriends; and the space, atmosphere and wide variety of menu selections are just barely worth giving the place another shot."},{"name":"Redbones BBQ","address":"55 Chester St","city":"Somerville","stars":"3.5","text":"Food is good, but not Bob-The-Chef's-good. \\n\\nI like the quirky atmosphere of the place, but I have a few complaints (maybe they're more like personal issues).\\n\\nIf you go there just to drink from their good beer menu they won't let you sit at the tables downstairs until either 10:30 or 11 (I forget which now); even when it's obvious that people aren't really eating anymore and the tables sit empty, the rule applies. \\n\\nSo you end up standing near the bar (not At the bar because it's too crowded) and feel like you're in the way of the barbacks moving stacks of glasses around. \\n\\nThere is an odd stair inside the bathroom that makes me nervous.\\n\\nWhen I sat upstairs for dinner I felt claustrophobic. \\n\\nI got the sausage-of-the-day, which is such a great idea, but, no lie, it tasted like weed.

Do not get me wrong, it was delicious and I do not regret going however, I would expect a little bit more in terms of flavor and ingenuity for the price I was paying.\\n\\nOne side note here at the end, it is totally unrelated to the food so don't let this alter your decisions on this place but there was one employee staffed as hostess and waitress for the entire restaurant at dinner on Friday night and I think I counted 5 or 6 people in the kitchen working.

The food here is very rich and tends to be on the sweet side - why we stopped going for a while. Last night we were on our way to Pho #1 and found it closed - since Co'm is at the next southbound intersection (behind the Chevron on the left) we decided to eat here.\\n\\nWhen you walk into Co'm you get assaulted by the delicious smell of sweet grilled meats - if you've ever had Hawaiian food you'll know the smell. The decor is upbeat with these interesting photo-paintings of Siamese female models in rather awkward compositions. Everything in the paintings is very beautiful however the compositions are horrible (if you go. notice the angles, position of limbs, etc - they're very distracting). Rather than taking away from the restaurant, the images actually add to the experience - it's hard to explain but they just seem right in that setting. The music is upbeat and the staff (made up of younger Asian males) is super attentive. They both know their food and menu; and provide exceptional service and advice on what to order.\\n\\nCo'm is a little different from the usual pho-fare you get at most Vietnamese restaurants - actually I don't believe pho is even offered (don't bother looking at the link for this listing for a menu - it's pointing to a very different restaurant in Dunwoody). The main dishes here are the Bun and the Co'm. With bun you get a jumble of noodles with fresh veggies on the bottom (they call it a \\"salad\\") and grilled marinated meats on top. You pour a fish-sauce mix over the whole thing and start wolfing it down - this is my favorite. With co'm you get a similar version of the meats only with a sweetened rice. They also offer the meats wrapped in grape leaves that have been grilled - sort of a fragrant  mini-sausage - for something different I'd go to one of these dishes. Shrimp is stuffed in a piece of sugarcane and grilled which I found very good and unusual.\\n\\nI especially like the fresh shrimp spring rolls here - the ingredients aren't what you usually find - it's much more robust both texturally and with flavor layering (think of a typical soft shrimp roll then add some crunchy texture and a few extras and you'll get the gist). These are a must have. The menu prices are perhaps slightly higher than what you would find in a pho restaurant, but I'm only talking a dollar or two and you get a small complimentary dessert at the end (this may only be at dinner?). In all a very enjoyable experience - I would recommend middle-of-the-week dining as the weekends are very busy and noisy. I'm on the verge of giving the restaurant 5 stars - I hesitate as it's not a restaurant I can go to on a weekly basis - the food is a bit too rich for me."},{"name":"The Ginger Man","address":"148 State St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Had the best first experience at The Ginger Man.

This is practically the experience at Portland City Grill. Nestled on the 30th floor of a business building in the heart of Portland, this is five star dining and there's nothing \\"grill\\" about it. \\n\\nThe ambiance, view and food within the Portland City Grill dining room is a solid five stars. The lounge before you enter the dining room is probably where the four stars would come to play. On the Saturday of our trip to Portland, we wanted to experience a very nice dinner in a beautiful setting. We were told to visit Portland City Grill for an amazing view and dinner. Upon reading the Yelp reviews though, I noticed that most of the reviews for Portland City Grill are for the happy hour, which is an entirely and I mean entirely different experience from the dining room. Night and day really. \\n\\nWe arrived on the 30th floor a little bit before our 8:45 reservation so that we could have a drink in the lounge. I love Portland for the fact that at 8:45 in June, it was still extremely light out and bright enough to see the incredible view. However, the atmosphere in the lounge was not quite what we expected. We were expecting patrons ready for a nice steak dinner but instead we walked into a rowdy happy hour crowd of people wearing hats and jerseys. Disappoint immediately hit for fear that this was going to be our \\"nice dinner experience.\\" After a quick drink in this dive-bar like atmosphere, we went to the hostess desk and got seated. The second we walked into the dining room, it was as if we had entered an entirely different restaurant. Since the lounge and dining room are two such different atmospheres, it might be nice to have a specific entrance for the dining room and one for the lounge so it's separated to a sense. \\n\\nNow to the dining experience! The view is worth eating here on its own. The dining room is full of floor to ceiling windows with gorgeous views of the river and surrounding city. Window seating is on a first come first serve basis, so unfortunately we didn't get to sit at the window, but it was still a spectacular experience and I could see the views perfectly. We started with salad and split a Cesar and Wedge. The Cesar definitely beat out the Wedge in my opinion and the salad dressing had a sweetness to it that created a twist to the typical Cesar salad. For the entree, I was debating between the crab cakes and the seafood risotto. But, I decided that crab cakes are crab cakes everywhere, so I should go for the risotto. \\n\\nI don't even know how to describe this seafood masterpiece! The risotto itself tasted like nothing I'd ever had before. It was thick, hearty and completely delicious. Now they should have warned me that they were giving me the entire sea on my plate! Literally, they gave me clams, an entire piece of salmon, three jumbo scallops and three jumbo shrimp. I ate and ate and ate but when I couldn't eat another bite, I looked at my plate and it looked like I had barely touched it! The risotto was so rich that it was hard to eat a lot of it, yet it was so incredibly delicious I had to push myself to the limit.  While I was slowly entering a food coma, the waiter brought out a dessert menu and of course we couldn't say no! So, we ended this meal of blissful culinary delight with beignets. They brought four small-medium beignets with delicious sauces to accompany. It was the perfect way to end this perfect meal in a perfect setting!\\n\\nI'm really torn between giving Portland City Grill four or five stars but since the majority of my experience was well above average, I'm going with five."},{"name":"Ichiro Sushi","address":"538A Adams St","city":"Milton","stars":"4","text":"I ordered delivery from this place.

When we walked in there was one family a head of us.  We waited and waited and someone offered us coffee, and then people came in behind us.  It was obvious from the way the regulars walked in, walked right by us as if we were not waiting and looked for tables that they usually don't have the kind of business that they did today.  They were not prepared.  There was no waiting list and after we were seated we saw some heated words exchanged when a family ran in and took a table when another family had been waiting for it for about 30 minutes.  They should have been prepared for the crowd after being featured. \\n\\nThe coffee was not horrible but it wasn't great.  I found myself using more cream than usual.  The food was OK.  Again, not wonderful.  My over medium eggs were closer to over easy (a little too runny for my taste) and my pancakes were.. CRISPY?  I don't quite know why or how they managed to crisp my pancakes, but I didn't finish them, and I am part of the clean plate club!\\n\\nThe decor of the place looks like an old Chinese resturant that was converted, but they kept the same style.

Bravo! I did not expect much upon my arrival to the hotel dining area and was pleasantly surprised as I was promptly greeted, placed in a sunny (but not hot) area of the dining area.

To this day, I still salivate over their lobster roll.  As a guy from SF, I wanted to try something unique from Boston.  After reading articles from Seriouseats and Thrillist about this place, not to mention the hoard of positive reviews here on Yelp, I decided that Neptune was going to be my choice.  \\n\\nNow, I'll freely admit that when it comes to lobster rolls, I'm not an expert.  The SF Bay Area has many great restaurants: lots of good seafood places and even a few Michelin-rated ones.  But you know what?  I will gladly pass on some of these places if it meant getting more of that lobster roll at Neptune.\\n\\nSo what is it about their lobster roll?  No idea.  Maybe it has do with the warm and soft brioche bun, topped with a sizable portion of lobster meat, not to mention all that glorious butter melting into the sandwich.  Don't know don't care - just get in my belly!  And to complement the lobster roll, we had a nice selection of fresh, raw oysters (amazing in its own right) as well as their clam chowder, which was honestly kind of an afterthought (but really, who the heck cares after you eat that lobster roll).  Beers?  Yup, they've got a great selection on tap to wash everything down.\\n\\nSo now, if you're reading all this, it sounds like maybe Neptune Oyster is perfect, right?  Well, not so fast.  They don't accept reservations so be prepared to wait.  When we went, there was a 3  1/2 hour wait (you get to leave your name and number and they'll call you when it's time for you to make your way back to the restaurant).  In addition, the place is small and super crowded.  We were situated right next to the front door and so I had the great pleasure of people bumping into me as they tried to pass by, or my favorite, stare at me while we ate.  By the way, it's simply astonishing (and kind of amusing) to see how people will try to cut each other off when the hostess tries to take names for the waiting list.  C'mon guys - chances are, you're probably not fighting for the last open table that Neptune has; rather, you're fighting for a spot that's probably going to be hours away.  But hey, people have their wants and needs.  Maybe waiting 2  1/2 hours is okay, but 2 hrs and 45 minutes is just nonsense - I don't know.  Anyways, I digress...\\n\\nIf you're willing to invest the time and energy to wait it out, then Neptune Oyster is a solid option.  I can easily understand why people might not think it's worth the wait and frankly, there's absolutely nothing wrong with thinking that.  For me though, is it worth it?  The answer is simple: hell yes."},{"name":"Jake's Ice Creams & Sorbets","address":"660 Irwin St","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Delicious ice cream!

The waitress actually said she took the picture.....I was shocked when I opened the box and it was NOTHING like the picture....the oreo cake was disgusting, NO frosting.....and the Cheescake was watery and loked like mucous....... No one would eat it...I literally threw it in the garbage after my 8 yr old braved one bite...Because cheescake is her favorite....and she spit it out and said it tasted like Spit......

I had told them that I was on my way back from moving my car and it took an additional 15 minutes.  They didn't have an issue and still reserved my seat.  Only drawback was the slow service but it seemed like there were only a couple servers.  I had ordered the lobster roll with hot butter, a clam chowder, and a johnnycake.  The lobster roll was awesome and delicious.  I loved every bite of it with fresh lobster chunks.  The fries that came with the dish was well seasoned and delicious.  \\n\\nThe clam chowder was delicious.  The chowder was creamy and had fresh clams.  The potatoes were fresh out of the pot and didn't seem very mushy.  The johnnycake was served hot with the smoked trout and caviar on top.  The flavors worked well except the smokiness of the trout was strong, but still worked.  I left this place full and the pricing was what I had expected considering the restaurant being a seafood bar style restaurant.\\n\\nI would definitely come back here if I visit Boston again.

The Chef had designed a fabulous farm to table made from scratch menu that will please all! As a long time resident of this area I'm glad a restauranteur with many years of ownership and experience has finally taken ownership of this restaurant so that this area can see the potential that this space has to offer. He has visions of expanding and remodeling to offer the best dining experience to everyone in the neighborhood. After my first visit here, I can tell you that the food and service is outstanding! I first ordered the hand battered calimari with the saut√©ed jalape√±os, absolutely fabulous with the home made chili sauce, we also enjoyed the spinach and artichoke dip with the fresh crispy pita chips, a little short on the chips we asked for a few more and our server Drea brought some more out quickly. We were stuck on the burgers as she said they were all good, so I ordered the Gentleman which had the BEST homemade onion rings on it, though I wanted lettuce and tomato, which wasn't offered on the menu, she brought that out right away. My dining partner also wanted a burger and ordered the Blue Crew, as she loves blue cheese, it came out with French Fries with the best home made ketchup I have ever had. I ordered the homemade slaw, which is in a HUGE bowl and was terrific, though I wonder how the homemade potato chips were. We finished it off by sharing a bread pudding they offered with a Henessey sauce with a few fresh sliced strawberries. It was really good: however, I think it should have had some whipped cream to add a little more sweetness! We will be back to try more of the menu, as the Drunken Scallops and Shrimp Carbonara are staring at me!

After serenading my friend, they sent us off with a plate of cookies!\\n\\nWe made a few shorter stops along Beacon Street which included Beacon Hill Chocolates, where we tasted their high quality bacon truffles and pumpkin gelato.  They gave us some freebies (decadent caramel dipped chocolate on a stick) to take home.  After walking through the public gardens, we visited Bacco Wine and Cheese.  In addition to treating us to a wine tasting, they also had an assortment of samples for us to taste, including baklava and macaroons.\\n\\nNext stop, Sabatino's on Newbury, we sampled their truffle oil and other delightful sauces.  I couldn't resist, I had to purchase their white truffle oil to try at home.  We made a food truck stop, Bon Me, where we enjoyed a super spicy deviled tea egg!  Then onto try the Hall of Fame clam chowder at Turners.  The chowder wasn't heavy at all--secret ingredient--rice flower.   At that point, we had a chance to relax, reflect a bit on the day and digest.   In addition to sharing the clam chowder recipe and a discount for a future visit, the restaurant manager gave the birthday girl a tiny box of homemade chocolates.  \\n\\nThe final stop was at the bar at Mandarin Hotel.  This stop included a dessert (regular size) and nonalcoholic drink (in addition to a birthday treat).  The desserts are a work of art by pastry chef Nelson Paz (former Top Chef Just Desserts contestant).

A little too much cheese for me (which is weird because I never say that), but still delicious.\\n\\nFor an extra $5 I upscaled the dessert to one of their signature souffles, the grand mariner souffle.

Given that the owners have a baking background it's no surprise that they've done a great job with their pastries. The chocolate croissant is very flaky and crispy on the outside and perfectly moist on the inside with a generous amount of chocolate filling. Many bakeries use the wrong kind of chocolate and not enough of it, but at commune kitchen it is clear they used a high-quality chocolate that has the right smooth consistency for inside of a croissant.\\n\\nWe we have also tried a few of the tartine's, the Porchetta and charcuterie. Very delicious complex flavors on a very nice crispy toasted piece of bread. We've also tried the vegetarian and Porchetta pizzas both of which were delicious. Very nicely made dough and quality flavorful ingredients, definitely one of the better pizzas I've had in the area. And with serious competition like Posto not far away that's saying something.\\n\\nMy only complaint is there somewhat odd hours.

I also opted for the salad-style instead of the baguette/wrap because of my incredible self-delusion that fried chicken can be healthy as long as it's sitting on a bed of lettuce.  \\nSeven Hens is more of a casual fast-food type of place, but I was very pleased with the quality and quantity for the price.

Regrettably, it turned out to be a very disappointing experience.\\n\\nAmbiance \\nThe design is to mimic a French bistro. It accomplishes that quite well with the decor. The leather chairs, the subway tile, high celings, the wine bottles aligned on the shelves, etc. However, instead of piping in some French cafe music or at least jazz, they have chosen to play pop elevator music.  3 stars.\\n\\nFood\\nWe were there with the brunch menu, and the food was unforgettable. Unfortunately, it was unforgettable in the most negative manner. The food was overly salty, processed and the quality for the price was sub par. Some examples of the poor quality work were as follows: The croque madame suppose to have a light butter layer on the toast, not be a greasy, moist mess. The sauce should have a syrupy texture and not look or feel like squeezed from a bottle. The dish is accompanied by fries but as a French theme restaurant, this is a pomme frite style, not McDonalds. (Although MickeyDs tastes better, how sad is that for a $15 sandwich?). The pork confit was another disaster. It was so salty that I probably exceeded my daily sodium recommend+ed intake by twofold; I wasn't sure whether this was made or microwaved. They have a big open kitchen so I will give them the benefit of the doubt that they used the kitchen. The alleged salsa Verde was green so that's as close as it comes to being as advertised. At least, the coffee was a decent French roast but the cafe au lait was forgettable.     1 star.\\n\\nService \\nOur server was inexperienced but at least tried, her major faux pas is not knowing the menu well and forgetting to bring sugar with the coffee serving. Pretty basic stuff but that's as much as a function of training as it's on the individual server. The front desk is friendly enough. 3.5 star\\n.\\nValue\\nIt is hard to comprehend how a $50 brunch for 2 people wouldn't include a serving of a simple baguette bread basket for brunch.

To me, west end grill is one of those restaurants that looks great, has an upscale feel.... but the food and service are lacking. The complimentary bread and butter was good- rolls were crunchy and light. french onion soup was overly seasoned with black pepper, and had such an overwhelming, almost burnt flavor. Turkey club with fries was extremely bland. Fries weren't seasoned, and not crispy at all. It was a sad pile of wasted potato. Turkey clubs are already bland, so many restaurants give it a little something- avocado, spicy mayo, SOMETHING. Not this place. Dry, cut-the-roof-of-your-mouth bread and a ton of mayo served here. The service was really lacking, too. My husband and I waited 30 minutes for the check, after having three different servers. The last waitress that brought the check didn't even apologize for taking a half hour to come by. It wasn't busy at all- 4:00 PM on a Saturday. The only other customers were at the bar.
