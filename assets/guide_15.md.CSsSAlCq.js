Our beers and waters were served promptly. We ordered the large pizza with roasted red peppers it was on our table piping hot and steamy in about 26 minutes. Great time frame for a delicious well developed crust and bubbly cheese. The ingredients were fantastic and the sauce had just enough sweet zest and zing to it. The peppers weren't hot & crispy which is the way I like them but still had a nice roasted flavor to them. I devoured about 3 slices and had my fill. The tab was fair considering we ordered Texas Domestics (not exactly complimenting or pairing the pizza but still satisfying). The staff is always attentive and considering it was a REALLY busy day with the Carnival I was impressed. The 2nd we visited we ordered two medium #1 (margherita) and #4 (Spinach, roasted red pepper, green olives, onions ) Both were divine! Absolutely amazing pizzas. Both piping hot with great tastes.

Inside the dark low-ceilinged rooms with wood-panelled booths create an intimate atmosphere and a surprisingly workable space. Low ceilings and overhead beams complete the 'olde-worlde' look.\\nThe first thing you see on entering is the large tank of lobsters just inside the door. They didn't offer the option to choose your own, but I suspect that they would have if asked. There's also a shop to the right selling memorabilia like lobster hats, T-shirts, mugs and so on.\\n\\nThey can cater for large parties on the upper floor, but if you're a family group you will definitely want to try for the John F. Kennedy booth upstairs, complete with plaque and signage proclaiming it to be the late President's favourite booth. Although we got plenty of looks while sitting in here, to my surprise nobody asked to take a picture - in fact, we had to ask our waitress to take a picture of the four of us in the booth.\\n\\nOf course, it's really all about the seafood in here as the name would suggest, although you can order turf instead of surf from the very extensive menu if that's more your thing. \\n\\nI liked the complementary cornbread when we sat down, and eschewed a starter in favour of the American Bouillabaisse, a monster bowl with all sorts of seafood in it, topped with a half lobster. The lobster had been half-opened making most of the meat easy to get to, and they provide pliers to break open the claws. I'm used to having a tiny spear-like fork to get into the tighter areas, but surprisingly they only provided a small 3-tined fork, which didn't quite work for me. There's only so much dissection I'm prepared to put up with at the dinner table, so I left out the smaller more fiddly bits.\\n\\nI really appreciated the plastic bibs they provide to prevent accidental splashes ruining your outfit. You look like a complete twat, but it's all part of the fun.\\n\\nThe service was very friendly and helpful, although it wasn't the fastest I've encountered; but to be fair they were extremely busy and I had to admire the ability of the serving staff to keep up the cheery banter and smiling faces, even when they apologised that the coffee machine was broken so they couldn't provide the espresso that I asked for.\\n\\nOK, so there may be better (and quieter) seafood places around here, but for a great tourist experience and a spectacular seafood dinner, this place is hard to beat."},{"name":"Frank","address":"407 Colorado St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"pretty good, sometimes wish the servers moved a little faster so i was not so stressed out on my lunch break.\\n\\ngets really really loud when its full! which is fine by me! just dont bring your mothers or a date....ha"},{"name":"Reale's Italian Cafe","address":"13450 N Hwy 183, Ste 230","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Go for the pizza, stay for the pasta! \\n\\nWe found this restaurant six years ago, by accident, during a torrential rainstorm.

As I walked through the kitchen carrying my 14 month old there was a very grouchy looking Alana standing and glaring at me. Even when I smiled at her kindly she didn't crack a smile. Who knows....bad night. Were all entitled to them. \\n  On to the food portion of the review. Dinner took forever to arrive. My fianc√© got the bacon wrapped scallops appetizer which were undercooked and under seasoned. I had the mixed greens salad which was very fresh and fantastic as was the watercress salad that my future sister in law had. My fianc√©'s mother had some asparagus appetizer in which the asparagus was overcooked and looked unappetizing. Main courses-the seared walleye wasabi infused jasmine rice w a side of asparagus was pretty good-though I was missing some of the flavor notes described on the menu..however the asparagus was cooked perfectly. The seafood pasta puttanesca entree was said to be 'good enough' but nothing exciting-which was ordered by 2 in our party. Idk, we were disappointed by this visit. I personally, have been to Alana's a number of times and haven't ever experienced lack luster food like last night. My expectations were high & as I was the one to suggest Alana's, I felt a little embarrassed of our experience. The drinks and wine were wonderful as always. We will go back again, maybe when it's not so busy though."},{"name":"JINYA Ramen Bar","address":"5975 Roswell Rd, Ste B-217","city":"Sandy Springs","stars":"4.5","text":"This place is SMALL. I MEAN SMALLLLLL. \\n\\ncame on Tuesday of course there's a wait. You can only fit like 20 people in there :( feel bad for the staff when the weather gets bad too because almost half their seating is outside too. They need to expand like seriously. \\n\\nwe ordered \\nJINYA bun: pork as effortlessly tender and the sauce was balanced. The bun was soft and sweet and warm! $4 \\n\\nFried chicken: it's alright , I saved some of to put in my ramen too :p I would of enjoyed it better if it was like more crispy but nice portion 5p for $6 I think \\n\\nPork rice: not too salty. Came with a half soft boiled egg. Super good. A little bit oily but I liked the pork better than the chicken rice Bowl. Nice chunks of pork.  $5 combo w/ salad and ramen \\n\\nChicken rice: why do people wanna have a chicken alternative to everything???? This bowl was good. I'm sure chicken over pork lovers would love this bowl. Also not too salty and flavorful. Comes w a half soft bowl egg. $5 combo w/ salad and ramen \\n\\n      Spring mix salad: this dressing was unexpected! It looks like a vinaigrette dressing but it was salty! First bite threw me off but it's definitely an acquired taste. I liked it \\n\\nCha Cha Ramen: I had it \\"spicy\\" for extra cost. Honestly it was too fatty!! I felt like guilty just drinking the broth because it was soo extremely oily. The menu says the noodles are thick and that was right. Very thick noodles. I wonder where they get their noodles from. Overall it was alright. Expensive $14\\n\\nTonkotsu spicy: YUMMY!!!!! Too bad this wasn't the one I ordered. My bf really liked it. The \\"hot\\" flavor is definitely a little bit kicking. The both tastes good like Shin ramen but better. $11 no egg tho :(\\n\\nService: the girl we had was nice. She did a good job the only problem I have when I get served is they have to actually check on me and the food after I receive my food to make sure everything was right and satisfactory but she didn't.

The presentation is beautiful but make sure to order plenty or you'll be left hungry. The second time around we ordered mains instead of tapas and I ordered the paella, I don't know if it's the peruvian version of paella, but it was really seafood with flavored rice, it was not the Paella flavor I was accustomed to and for the price of the meal I was left hungry that we ended up getting more food elsewhere. The rice was shaped beautifully, there just wasn't a ton of it.  The lamb was flavored well but again for the pricing and the tier of restaurant it is, I would have expected a bit more pizzaz and flavor to it.\\n\\nI'd come here again but this time I would stick to the tapas and drinks.

We had never heard of Black Creek Bistro, but their Restaurant Week menu sounded pretty good so we decided to give it a try.\\n\\nThe restaurant itself is located in a less-bustling area, a bit southeast of Downtown. I think there was a parking lot across the street, but we found a spot on the street right outside of the entrance. The restaurant is also on the smaller side, so if you plan on arriving during peak dinner hours, a reservation definitely helps. Otherwise, it's totally fine to wait in their bar room and enjoy one of their many beers and wines.\\n\\nBlack Creek Bistro advertises itself as a seasonal, farm-to-table restaurant (I believe our waiter says they get most of their produce from a farm outside of Canal Winchester). Because it was Restaurant Week, their special menu had a tropical theme to it. For my courses, I ordered the Shrimp Ceviche, Cabbage Apple and Papaya Salad, Caribbean Rubbed Chicken Quarter, and one of their seasonal desserts (which was described to us as a play on s'mores and moon pies). My boyfriend also had the Caribbean Chicken as his entree, but ordered the Teriyaki Wings, Curry Potato Salad, and the other dessert choice, which was a Bavarian Lime Custard.\\n\\nEverything was very fresh and delicious. By the time we got to the dessert course, we barely had room in our stomachs! The only complaint I have is that the chicken quarters were cooked inconsistently. While my chicken was underdone and had a bit of a rubbery texture, my boyfriend's chicken was a little bit dry and overcooked. Other than that, it was a very satisfying meal.\\n\\nIn addition to the great food, we also had a great waiter! He was super friendly and joked around with us, and really added to the already great experience we were having.

There was also fresh watermelon slices, grapes and apples. It also was served with three types of bread. The bread that had berries baked into it was amazing.

It is incredible.\\n\\nWine by the glass is 3 to 6 dollars a glass from the happy hour selection and includes French and Australian choices. Give it a try.

We arrived early before the restaurant opened so we walked down to the wine patio.  It was happy hour 5-6:30 and bottles of wine were 1/2 off!!  We ordered a bottle and the outdoor bartender asked for the name on our reservation and told us she would be the hostess for the night as well.  She said our bottle of wine could be transferred to our dinner bill inside.  We sat on the cute patio for about 20 mins drinking our wine and were swarmed with bugs since it backs up to the creek.  Didn't see any citronella candles or anything but luckily had some bug spray in the car (come prepared!).\\n\\nAround 6:30, the time or our reservation, we made our way up to the restaurant and a different woman was actually the hostess while the outdoor bartender was still at the bar (not sure why the change).  We were seated promptly at the bar.  If you are a party of 2 you will either sit at the bar or the shared table.  The hightops all seemed to be occupied by larger parties.  We don't mind sitting at the bar but know that it is cozy with your neighbors.\\n\\nWhen looking at the menu, each line is a dish, so there are 3 dishes under each heading.  We ordered two salad type dishes, 1 sea dish, all 3 land dishes, and one dessert.  The food was terrific!  The curry shrimp dish and chicken with boudain balls were favorites.  The antelope heart was a tasty surprise too!  Our least favorites dish was the lamb, as the flavors just didn't quite work for us.\\n\\nThe only downside to our night was our server.  After friendly greetings from the outdoor bar, the hostess, and another server, we seemed to be getting the cold shoulder from our server.  She rarely checked in with us and seemed to just drop our plates and leave, despite the fact that we heard other servers explaining dishes as they were dropped off.  I would understand if she was super busy, but the restaurant wasn't full and she spent a lot of time cleaning glasses behind the bar.  We also noticed other tables had their wine bottles placed on ice but we were never offered, which would have been nice since we ordered our Rose an hour prior outside.  While placing our orders, she said we could wait and place our dessert order later since we were having trouble deciding.  But she never checked back in with us about it and seemed surprised when we later asked to order dessert.  After a 2 hour meal (the pace is nice but do not plan on getting in and out quickly) we finished our dessert and sat for 10 mins waiting on our check.  Our glasses were empty and our plates were cleared....  Once again its not a large place and our server walked by us multiple times.  Then we got the check and our 1/2 price wine from the outdoor bar was full price on the check.  She made the change without a fuss but this took some additional time...

This night (a Thursday) happens in the beginning of December each year and features a choir singing Christmas Carols in the park.

Generous portions, great prices, lots of flavors.

Well, first off, I think the classification for this joint is wrong.  Frankly, it ain't no Italian restaurant...  It's really a pizza place (I mean pizza is Italian (I guess), but there's really nothing else on the menu to order as a meal).  So if you want pizza, you got a chance, but otherwise, you are in for a disappointment.  Secondly, a restaurant is fundamentally all about the food it serves and the pizza was just ok.  In this case, the Yelp classification of \\"Meh, I've experienced better\\" is perfect and thus my 2 star rating.  It's especially hard to like this place because there are so many better options like Home Slice or even Southside Flying Pizza in close proximity.  The pizza comes out burnt.  Now, don't get me wrong, I like a smokey flavor and am even one of those rare guys that orders his steaks and burgers med-well to well, but this was burned even for my taste.  Also, the pizza is missing that all too elusive key ingredient \\"love.\\"  I know, I know, hard to measure that ingredient, but in this case, the guy making your pizza is right there like 3 feet away from you.  You look at his face and the guy isn't happy to be there.  He makes your pizza in about 1 minute with a few toppings here and there, then throws your pie in the open and voila, your pizza is as good as the love that went into it:  not much.  And, you can't really blame the guy (he's just doing what he's been taught), but the final product reflects the lack of love, thought and composition that a good pizza should have.\\n\\n2 more things:  the place is small and there are not many options for drinks.  I like a small, cozy, \\"hole in the wall\\" place just as much as anyone else, but in this case, the size is also linked to # of employees and we felt a real lack of customer service.  I ordered a side of marinara, and no joke, it arrived at my table when I had 1 slice left (eating at a normal pace, of course).  I know you are impressed by my being able to down an entire pizza in 1 sitting, but seriously, that is some slow, slow service.  Now, my wife made me disclose that they did apologize and offer us a free dessert as a courtesy for the lacking service, but a free gift is hardly a replacement for a lacking experience...  As for the drinks, if you like wine, you will be ok, but even then, I ordered a rose and they were out, so who knows how many other wines they may be \\"out of\\" at any given time...

If nothing else, you have to get this. \\n\\nFor appetizers we got the Causa Mixta Nikkei and Cebiche de Pescado.

I suppose my attentiveness to community news has somewhat diminished as of late.\\n\\nAnyway..\\n\\nMy girlfriend, brother and I decided to give Yo Sushi a try. This clean, spacious restaurant was suspiciously empty on a Wednesday night. Asides from us, there was only one other small group present during our stay. The extensive menu has the usual, but also unique appetizers, sushi and hot food. \\n\\nAs appetizing as the dishes were described to be, they were anything but. The sashimi was either cut poorly or thawed too rapidly - it literally fell off our chopsticks as we picked them up. The rolls were just 'okay', but I didn't find them enjoyable because the temperature of fish and tobiko were a lot colder than most restaurants would have (and I eat a lot of sushi). In addition, the \\"Canucks Roll\\" was advertised as containing crab meat, but ours was served with the cheaper kamaboko. It would've also been nice if the melted cheese was actually melted and not clumped into a giant mass. \\n\\nSave yourself the trouble of being ripped-off and avoid ordering the butter seared scallop appetizer. It sounds delicious, but it's really just half a dozen thinly sliced scallops thrown into a mixture of saut√©ed mushrooms and onions. It's the type of dish you'd embrace with a steak, but not with sushi.\\n\\nAlthough the staff were friendly and service was efficient, the food was mediocre and heavily priced.

I don't usually put salt and pepper on a crepe but this needed some. Also the chicken was overcooked. It was tough cutting through it.

Maybe it's the primal draw of meat, or the DIY ethic that is so in vogue these days. Or perhaps people like to customize their meal exactly to their tastes, and don't want to wait a long time to have it cooked. As a recently diagnosed diabetic, I was drawn to the low-carbness of the place. So long as I skipped the noodles, of course. Truth is I didn't even miss them, with the wide array of meats and veggies I got to choose from. \\n\\nThe building housing Gobi Mongolian Grill sits off busy Mill Plain Blvd. and has been through many iterations over the years. The last time I stepped inside it was a Fuddruckers, but the interior decor is much changed from those days. It's all mood lighting and wood now, and aesthetically, is warm and inviting. \\n\\nWe arrived on a Friday evening, and ended up waiting a good 5-6 minutes for the hostess to even show up. She asked the couple in front of us whether they wanted a table or a booth, even though there were no clean booths available. Which, of course, is what they asked for. Which meant she disappeared again for a couple of minutes clearing and wiping down said booth. Why she didn't just seat them at one of the many available tables is a mystery. Suffice it to say, when she got back to us, we were more than happy to sit at a table. Service was off to an inauspicious start. \\n\\nFortunately, the food mostly made up for it. There are no surprises here; if you've been to one Mongolian BBQ joint, you've been to 'em all. There's the usual array of thinly sliced defrosting meats - chicken, beef, pork, and lamb. You've got your cod and shrimp, as well. There was a spicy marinated chicken option for contrast, a nice touch. Veggie-wise you can choose from onions, broccoli, mushrooms, carrots, bean sprouts, peppers, baby corn, etc. Noodles, if you're so inclined, of course. Then there are the usual sauces, ranging from mild to hot: soy, garlic, oyster, black pepper, ginger, sesame oil. Again, nothing out of the norm. You can follow the instructions for mixing and matching to get the right flavor balance for your palate, or just go nuts and experiment with whatever sounds good. I'm a big fan of the latter. Once you've filled your bowl(s), you bring them over to a grill. The two cooks back there looked downright surly.

This is what we tried:\\n\\nPotato chips with pimento cheese - The house made chips were served warm and crisp and the warm cheese was wonderful. I am not huge on fried foods but I would definitely order this again.\\n\\nChicken liver pate - the extremely rich pate was served with a lovely huckleberry sauce and mini brioche. It was delicious however a bit too rich.\\n\\nRed snapper crudo - one of my top two dishes! The delicate cuts of fresh red snapper was complimented with dashi, lemon and oregano. I am still daydreaming about this dish.\\n\\nCrab toast - thick rustic toast topped with plump pieces of fresh crab, avocado, fennel aioli mint and radish. This was a nice lighter dish. The crab was cooked perfectly.\\n\\nSoft egg toast - foccacia bread topped with a gooey soft boiled egg, nicely cooked asparagus and truffle vinaigrette. Super rich and decadent! \\n\\nCharred octopus - this flavorful dish was easily my favorite. It had upland cress, garlic aioli. tasty beluga lentils and avocado. I loved how the charred tender octopus had an umami to it when paired with the other ingredients.\\n\\nBraised chicken - this dish was good but didn't compare after tasting the previous well executed dishes. My friends however couldn't get enough. It is tender chicken with a light aligot sauce and braised swiss chard. \\n\\nCaramelized endive - a tad sweet but still rather incredible.\\n\\nBroccolini - the broccolini was smartly paired with a dense romesco sauce and toasted almonds.\\n\\nFrites - perfectly crisp served with a crazy good garlic aioli and mazano sauce.

The ice cream sandwich had a nice chewy cookie with festive sprinkles. \\n\\nOur waiter and the kitchen were timely. Each dish brought out as another was ending.

Also, the weird potato crepe wasn't very good.\\n\\nHowever, I WILL rave about the dessert here. I ordered the apple bread pudding, which was absolutely delicious, full of nuts, and with a dollop of vanilla ice cream. Then my friend ordered the \\"Array of Freshly Baked Cookies\\" or \\"Cookie platter\\" as he called it. 12 fresh from the oven, fall apart in your hands, freaking amazing cookies. There were 4 varieties; chocolate chip, peanut butter, oatmeal raisin, and pistachio. They were all so good. They literally fell apart as I tried to carry them 6 inches from the platter to my plate, yet the bottoms were crispy...we surmised that they must have torched the outsides to get them that perfect.\\n\\nGreat view, OK food, amazing desserts. I'd say it's an awesome place for a date...\\nOr just a fun place to hang out with some friends =)"},{"name":"The Paramount","address":"44 Charles St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"We came by at 7:30AM and there was already a lineup outside waiting for this place to open at 8, so we knew it had to be good, and we weren't disappointed.

It's all the same place. The 5 bars may all be under one roof but the drink and food selection is different in each of those bars! As is the theme and ambiance.

We hadn't seen each other since our break-up, and it had been a while. When we were together, I was head-over-heels, over-the-moon, stars-in-my-eyes in love with this guy. Even though we'd been apart for a while, I knew that there was a possibility that he would still have that effect on me. When we did meet up though, the \\"magic\\" was completely gone. We passed a pleasant afternoon together, my heart free of its erstwhile infatuated palpitations.\\n\\nWhy am I telling you this? Reviewers like myself who knew and loved the \\"old Bouldin\\" might recognize parallels between my encounter with my ex and their feelings toward the \\"new Bouldin\\". It's still attractive, sexy and wholesome - just like my ex - but the magic, the sparkle, the...je ne sais quoi just isn't there any more.\\n\\nBouldin Creek still has the best vegetarian and vegan food around. Their House Deluxe Salad topped with tofu scramble and Parmasean Peppercorn dressing will still blow you out of the water. Their Kool Summer Sammich with feta and fake bacon has me drooling just thinking about it. And their slew of drinks - my favorite being the Nutella Mocha (it's exactly what it sounds like) - is still more than enough to satisfy even the most discerning quaffers. The staff is extremely friendly and polite, and the atmosphere is quirky and pleasant. You can still bring your dog. I make sure to bring any visitors to Austin to Bouldin Creek, and I still visit several times a month.\\n\\nFor any other business, the preceding paragraph would indicate a five-star review. And damn Yelp for prohibiting half-stars, since this review is actually a 4.5-star review. I debated even writing a review for Bouldin, since I didn't want to come off as a complainer, but I know that Bouldin's owner, Leslie, reads Yelp reviews, and as a long-time Bouldin Creek aficionado, I like that I have a forum to let her know how I'm feeling.\\n\\nLeslie, I apologize because I am sure you've gotten this a lot from old patrons. I am not sure how I feel about the table service. This is the reason I've taken off half a star. I appreciate that it's available, but I don't like that its availability means less availability of non-table-service areas. Up until four o'clock, the majority of tables (all of the outside tables and all of the tables in the larger back room) are table-service only. That leaves four small two-person tables and two communal bar-tableish areas for people who don't want table service. This translates to feeling really pressured to get in and get out, either that, or feeling like a jerk for taking up a table for more than a half an hour. I wonder if some of the outside tables - and at least one large table - could be designated as non-table-service? I think a happy medium can be found so that table service still exists but so that people who don't want table service don't feel pressured to finish their food on \\"table-service time\\".\\n\\nAdditionally, I wonder about the outdoor seating. So far, it's been lovely. But with absolutely zilch in the shade department, that outdoor patio's gonna be *mighty* hot come the summer months, and I doubt that it will present a very attractive prospect for diners. I know that you and your gang are awesome at landscaping, so maybe you've got something up your collective sleeve to deal with this. Wisteria? Shade vines? A...tarp?\\n\\nIn conclusion, I am happy for Leslie and Bouldin's sake that they have expanded. This is still the place to go for kick-ass vegetarian food that is consciously sourced and produced. Bring your family, dog and friends. But just as I'll never forget or recreate my first love, a piece of my heart will never stop pining for Bouldin as it once was."},{"name":"Union Oyster House","address":"41 Union St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I was sorely disappointed on both occasions (09/11/2015 and 09/13/2015).

The crispiness of the beef is what makes this my second favorite dish. It leaves you wanting more with the mixture of the sweet sauce. The fried chicken was good but nothing amazing. You can definitely find juicier and more flavorful fried chicken in the south.\\n\\nPoor Calvin's has a very diverse menu: from seafood to different proteins.

It also came with sides: a tostone (? tostone? it was just one) which is salty mashed fried plantain, not the sweet kind... it also came with rice and a salad and the soup of the day which was a kind of beef stew, which was good but not amazing. \\nChicken empanada: pretty good. Not so sure about the flavor but I guess that's just my preference. \\nThe empanada came with a really spicy salsa! It was good but burned my mouth.\\nThe special also came with chimichurri (bright green) sauce which is not so spicy and really delicious. \\n\\nI second other reviewers who say that the portions are HUGE which is great for two meals. The prices probably reflect the size of the portions... a coworker of mine says 3.99 is a lot for an arrepa, and 6.00 seems like a lot for 4 bunyelas, but the lunch especial was 8.99 for a lot of food, so there you go. \\n\\nI think that's all. I didn't give this 5 stars, just because some of the food is kinda plain/I didn't super love (side salad, empanadas) and because they were out of arrepas and are not amazingly cheap, but I really love it a lot and HIGHLY recommend it (almost 5 stars!)"},{"name":"McMenamins Kennedy School","address":"5736 NE 33rd Ave.","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"They're a cool place, but if you are going in a group you may wanna go elsewhere.

I wanted to check it out my first night, but my coworker wanted to hit up another spot. As we walked back to the hotel from dinner the first night we spotted this place and he thought it looked pretty interesting so we made plans to come back. I'm happy we did as the server was very cute and the food was delicious!\\n\\nWe started with the Salmon hush puppies to share. They had two types of sauces - one was more sweet and sour, the other was a sriracha mayo. It was also paired with some cold smoked salmon which gave it an extra kick of flavor. The hush puppies were crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. I wished the hush puppies themselves had more flavor, but the sauces made up for it.\\n\\nI wanted something nice and warm to drink, so I ordered the Tom Yum Soup as well. The broth was delicious, but it seemed odd with the little cubed veggies. I would have preferred a more traditional preparation with sliced vegetables that would allow for more flavor absorption. \\n\\nFor the main course my coworker ordered the Thai curry Grouper and I ordered the Duck dynasty (with shrimp). The Thai curry had great flavor and the rice was cooked just right. My duck dynasty was very flavorful (cooked perfectly at medium rare) with juicy duck breast with a good layer of fat and crispy skin. The shrimp was a hair overcooked, but was large in size and also well seasoned. The mashed potatoes I had was probably the least interesting on the dish as it was too sweet and detracted from the flavors. I felt as if the rest of the dish has flavors that paired well, but the mashed potatoes were just there as a flavor outsider. If I go back again I'd probably swap it out for rice.\\n\\nWe were really full but someone convinced ourselves that dessert was a good idea. We ordered the Pandan Pound Cake. That dessert can probably feed 3-4 adults (if you're being a reasonable adult). If you're like us though, you'll finish it anyway. It is massive, it's sweet, and it's good. The pound cake is moist (obviously they used enough butter), and the outside is candied? with some kind of caramel. It's also served with butterscotch ice cream and some chocolate. YUM. \\n\\nThe place gets busy, they also have outdoor seating (which fills up first), so come early or prepare to wait! The kitchen is well run, and orders are pretty smooth.

I came here to study for finals and I love how there are a couple of individual rooms that can fit 1-2 people. These individual rooms need to be reserved and I think to reserve it, you make an account that you are a part of an organization. However if its not reserved, it's essentially first come first serve. The downside to this capital one cafe is that it closes so early and it's a little out of the way from me! I'd be here all the time if it opened later like the other capital one cafes."},{"name":"The Optimist","address":"914 Howell Mill Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"After a long wait, I finally stopped in with a work colleague for lunch. The Optimist has been on my list for some time now, and it was worth the wait, for the most part!\\n\\nFirst off, they have a really small parking lot. Like they can only fit maybe 10-15 cars in it, and have access to an overflow lot somewhere else. I didn't see where, but we waited for a bit to get our car back.\\n\\nOnce inside, the atmosphere was really cool. Classy, clean, not overpopulated, and slightly nautical without being cheesy or gaudy. We sat in a corner booth and got to look at the whole restaurant. The chef was walking around and making sure all the food was prepared properly before going to a table, and the servers were quick and efficient, without being too quick or overbearing. It seems they found a happy medium and are sticking to it. \\n\\nI ordered the gumbo to start with, and it came with some bread wrapped in parchment paper held together with twine. The gumbo was fantastic! I could come back and eat it as a full meal. A little heat, but not too much, and the consistency of the roux and other flavors were spot on. \\n\\nFor my entree, I had the red snapper over sauteed okra and bok choy. The snapper was good, and served with the skin on. I could tell it wasn't super fresh, but I have to admit I'm a little biased and rotten from spending time on the Gulf Coast. My boyfriend is from Mobile and his family always gets us the best, freshest seafood when we go down there. I knew I would take a gamble when I got snapper at The Optimist, but wanted to try it anyway. The flavors were good, and they did a good job with it. Bottom line is that it doesn't compare to how fresh the fish is when I order it in Mobile.\\n\\nMoving on, the bok choy was hard to eat. It was sauteed in oil, I think, and it was chewy and wouldn't break apart easily. The leaves were soggy and hard to tear with your teeth, so we ended up chewing on them for too long (my colleague got the same entree), and just it was not a pleasant experience. The okra was good, and I ended up eating around the bok choy just to get the okra that was cooked properly.\\n\\nFor dessert, I had the chocolate creme brulee with Oreo whipped cream, and it was heavenly! Rich chocolate flavor, and the whipped cream was even better. I don't think I've had a chocolate creme brulee before, and I think the bar was set pretty high. My colleague had the banana bundt cake with ice cream and caramel sauce (can't remember the exact description, and the menu on their website isn't the same as the restaurant, at the time of writing). I had a small bite of the cake and it tasted like my mom's homemade, from scratch banana bread fresh out of the oven. In other words, good with a touch of nostalgia. \\n\\nMy least favorite part of the experience was our server. He was too formal for our liking. We both prefer bubbly servers who take the time to get to know you, whereas this guy was all business. He was stiff, and didn't have much personality, but did everything technically right: kept our water glasses full, checked on us when our food hit the table, etc. So, I can't say he was a bad server, but it would have been nice to see more of his personality while we were there.\\n\\nI'm definitely coming back, but probably for a drink with boyfriend and to split some gumbo and dessert if we're hungry."},{"name":"Andina Restaurant","address":"1314 NW Glisan St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"If you don't try anything else at this restaurant, just promise me you will get the lamb shank and the sacsayhuaman cocktail.

Yes, they take them and have a designated area for reserved tables..... But it is not needed.

HAHA, take that hipsters, that officially makes me way cooler than you now. \\n\\nI digress... \\n\\nOur waitress meandered over and took our order while mostly looking over our heads. And that's just how she was the whole time. She stopped by when it occurred to her, always looking like there was a better table somewhere behind you. Sort of like one of those chilly chicks you meet at a party who responds to your nervous joke with a sound like part laugh, part adenoid problem, full lip curl: \\"oh....a-hhhhmmmm. That's funny.\\" \\n\\nThat visit we both went with some junkies but goodies: Hot Polish, poutine. Tossed in a boozy root beer float (okay, I was a little embarrassed to order that, but c'mon...it's ROOT BEER), the \\"it's there so you have to try it\\" bacon-y bourbon drink, and a maple bacon cupcake. Well...the drink was root beery. The bourbon bacon'ish. But the dog had no bite. I mean, can you really be a great hot dog place when you strip away all the gastro-pub'ish frills and find no real...well...meat? With just a smear of the mustard, the hot dog was just a classmate to any generic wiener. Worse, the cupcake was dry. Unforgivable! \\n\\nA second visit didn't fair nearly as well. After we were shown through a mostly empty restaurant on a Tuesday at 6 pm, all the way to the table that bumped up against the hallway to the bathrooms and exit, our waiter showing up when he got around to it. Husband had just made me laugh, so when the waiter approached I turned to him with a full wattage smile and friendly, \\"Hi!\\" I kid you not, the guy cringed and stepped backwards. Picture a vampire in one of those old horror movies after someone breaks out a blacked out window. It buuuuuuuurns! \\n\\nThis time around we went for some of the \\"special\\" dogs: mine was the gyro-ish one, husband's...eh, I can't remember (full on foreshadowing). We ordered the carafe of their boozy lemonade, and an order of the mini corn dogs to share in the spirit of in for a penny, in for 20 pounds. \\n\\nLittle while later the waiter comes back, says they're out of the lemonade. Ah well, bummer, moving on. Five minutes later, here he comes again and says they're out of the corn dogs. Really...it's like Tuesday late afternoon son, that must have been one hell of a lunch rush. \\n\\nFinally, we get some food at least. Bit of comedy moment when my first bite squirts a mass of hot juice literally into my eye and down my shirt. Well...at least I got dinner. \\n\\nAnd again, we silently ate our ways mostly through our hot dogs before we kind of gave into the disappointment. Not only was the meat on mine absolutely without flavor, but even the toppings were hollow. It tasted like it had been boiled and then left to leach away its flavor in the hot water for a few hours. Husband's suffered the same fate despite being an entirely different hot dog. Which just doesn't give me high hopes that these two visits are the exception. \\n\\nI will add one bright spot.

I had a kruller, which was good...but it wasn't warm or out of the oven, and it tasted just as delicious as one from any other shop I've ever been to.\\nIn addition, my problem with this excursion, is that it's in a somewhat sketchy downtown area, that could easily be avoided. I parked my car and was told by a local policeman to take out *everything* from the car, or the car windows would be broken into if I left a hairbrush in it.

It was one of the two restaurants that I knew I had to revisit during my trip back to Portland. And it didn't disappoint.\\n\\nMy friend Hannah and I went for lunch on Friday after thanksgiving. She had never been there before, and when we were looking at the menu and trying to decide what to get, it was easier for me to tell her which few dishes I did not care for, because the menu is full of mouth-watering deliciousness.\\n\\nOf course, the bread and the dips welcomed me back with memories of good food. And probably because a friend of mine who is a hostess there made our reservation, we were seated by the large windows, where the rare sunshine was shining through, and we were surprised with an amuse bouche, which was a shitake mushroom sitting on a delicious sauce with a pepper on top. Yummmmm...\\n\\nWe ordered three small plates and a main course to share. The small plates were Chicharrones de Pollo, Mixta Nikkei, and Palta Rellena de Cangrejo. The Chicharrones has been my favorite since my first visit to Andina. Deliciously crispy with quinoa on the outside and juicy chicken on the inside, served with a sauce that reminds me of the sweet and sour sauce for egg rolls. The Mixta was flawless, with potato puree scented with lime, tuna, crab, and a prawn on top. As for the Palta Rellena, it was my first time trying this dish and it was very, very good. How could you go wrong with avocado stuffed with crab? And it was served with a small salad on the side, which was perfectly dressed.\\n\\nThe main dish was also a new one for me. We got the Locro Serrano de Zapallo Andino. I have always liked squash soup/stew, but it never occurred to me to order this dish before, because my eyes are usually drawn to more carnivorous dishes. Hannah suggested that we order this to balance out the meal, which was already pretty heavy with meat and seafood. Our server asked if we were sharing when we ordered, and our stew came in two separate bowls. I love it when restaurants are accommodating like this. We would have been fine had we been presented with one larger bowl, but this gesture was very much appreciated. This stew was delectable. There was garlic rice in the middle, surrounded by green peas, which was then surrounded by the squash stew. The cute fried quail egg sat on top of the rice. Hannah and I both cleaned our plates. How delicious!\\n\\nAt this point we didn't really have room for dessert, but how could we say no to the dessert menu? We ordered the Flan de Queso de Cabra. I think this concludes my exploration of the dessert menu. I don't care too much for goat cheese or cheese cake, but it was very good.\\n\\nAnd we were also treated to complimentary Alfajores at the end. Those little things are so addictive...\\n\\nI went back a couple of days later to get my Sacsayhuaman. So. Good...\\n\\nI live in New Orleans with awesome food and I still miss Andina a lot.

I revel in ordering all the sides at BBQ places, and I'll happily chow down on a grilled cheese at a dive bar.

They all failed to point out that the black bean burger is actually a Morningstar veggie burger (their Spicy Black Bean veggie burger, to be precise).  I know this because I've had a LOT of veggie burgers in my day.  Look, if you want to serve me a terrible store-bought textured soy protein burger, fine.  But don't do it under the pretense of caring about food that's local and organic.  Maybe point out on the menu that the veggie burger isn't house-made and certainly isn't worth the price.  Actually, I'm having a lot of trouble thinking of a situation during which I'd volitionally eat a Morningstar burger, so an announcement on the menu would be greatly appreciated.

Drinks were excellent, service was friendly and warm, decor was fabulous, and we definitely plan on going back for more.

The bread was good and the pepper spread that came with it was nice but I think I will have dreams about the Crispy Mushroom Bites.  My sister and husband also loved them.  Then the adults had the Beets n Blue salads.  The greens had a wonderful light dressing with blue cheese, chunks of roasted beets and a nice slab of crispy bacon on top.  So far everything had exceeded our expectations and left us wanting to try all the other options for starters and weeds.  \\n\\nFor the entrees I had the Pork Loin it was came with chili verde drizzle on top that added just the right brightness to offset the richness of the pork.  The potatoes were fried with chorizo which was crispy so it worked with the creamy potatoes and the greens that were served with it had just a kick of spice that made me want more, more, more.  My sister had the Chick Pea Crepe with added chicken it was very fresh and had a flavor that made you think of springtime with the asparagus and greens and goat cheese.  Husband had the special which was lamb, I'm not a fan of lamb (raised them when I was a kid so have trouble eating them) but I did take a bite and it was good, he thought fabulous.  Daughter had the Steak with Lardons (bits of bacon that are fried crisp) green beans which were so good she was guarding her plate while trying to eat them all before the rest of us could steal more and potatoes.  \\n\\nDessert - Well of course I had to try the market crisp which was Strawberry Rhubarb, served with fresh whipped cream which was perfect.  Daughter had the cream brulee which she allowed each of us to have one tiny taste of before she polished it off.  I had the White Russian, sister had the tawny port and husband had The Clooney.

There were two large round tables with giant lazy Susans where groups can share different dishes and then there were several other smaller tables. We were in time for the lunch special which consisted of several entree options, egg fried rice and our choice of soup or vegetable egg roll all for $6.99. \\n\\nMy mom and I both chose Cashew Chicken, but I chose the egg roll and Mom chose the egg drop soup, she also ordered a pork egg roll and we added on am order of krab rangoon as an appetizer. For drinks we chose ice tea and water.\\n\\nWithin a few minutes Mom's soup was brought out full of beautiful eggy goodness. The broth was so smooth and rich. I wished I would have had a bowl as well. Then a few minutes later the krab rangoon was brought out accompanied by warmed sweet and sour sauce. They were a beautiful golden brown. I love to gently pull them a part at the corners and dip them in the sauce. Many times when I have gotten them at other places they are basically over fried and just stuffed with dried out cream cheese. These were generously filled with a good mixture of krab and cream cheese and when I took a bite it was so sweet and creamy it was like being back at home at my favorite restaurant there. \\n\\nOur egg rolls soon followed and then our entrees. From the first bite of the cashew chicken I knew I had found my new favorite place to go for Chinese food. There were plenty of cashews and veggies and an even Balance of chicken.

My first trip, the family had been to The Optimist before. Fish, fish and more fish.. That's not a bad thing mind you..  First up oysters..  Excellent..  Fresh, on the half shell, delicious..  For a main I had skate wing schnitzel.  OK, the presentation side of the fish (the pretty side) was a bit over browned and the bottom of the fish looked like it hadn't hit the frying pan but the fish itself was excellently done..  Family had scallops that looked good, Vermillion Snapper and scallops that all looked equally as nice.  Wine list is medium in length and a bit steep in price but, hey, it's an upscale Atlanta eatery so I didn't feel gouged..  Waiter staff is somewhat attentive..  Did the \\"let's pour out the entire bottle of wine on the first go around\\" trick but that's rather standard these days.  At one point our server sort of \\"disappeared\\" and while I want to believe he was just giving us room to talk and sip wine I think he was really working other tables that he could flip faster.. More customers, more orders, more tips, etc.   The restaurant itself is very tasteful but suffers from the trappings of the latest open architecture..

We came mid-afternoon to a line that went across the street so we decided to try again later. After dinner we stopped by and thankfully, the line was much shorter and only wrapped around once. 20 minutes later, we were inside and ordered their famous voodoo shaped donut and the maple bacon donut. Inside is so cute and kitschy. I wish we could've spent more time inside. They have the rotating display case of different donuts. I think it's for display purposes only and not for consumption. But they all looked good. We took our big pink box back to our hotel to try. Along the way, 3 different people asked us how the line was. I guess it is the most popular thing in Portland. After taste tests, the verdict is that while the donuts are cute both cute and unique, it wasn't the best tasting donut I've ever had. They felt a little bit NOT fresh. You would think that because they're so busy, they would be constantly churning out donuts and they would be fresh.

While the food was good, there might be a little to be said for the service.\\n\\nUpon arrival around 7pm, we were greeted with an almost empty dining room.  But the look on the face of the server, who we later found out was only a busboy, indicated that our group of 9 might be a problem.  He had to check with the manager to determine if we could be seated.  After some gracious rearranging of tables, we were seated and browsed through the menu.\\n\\nPanahar's menu is similar to Indian cuisine, owing to the country's proximity to India.  However, there are a few minor, subtle variations, that should make fans of Indian food, and even those who are just OK with it, enjoy Bangladeshi food.\\n\\nWhile the waiter/manager was nice and very gracious, thanking our friend for bringing a large group, the lack of additional wait staff made for some serious staffing issues.  It took probably 20 minutes for us, in a still-mostly-empty-restaurant, to put in our orders for mango lassi's.  Following a 10 minute wait (I don't think the kitchen was prepared), they were delivered, but we had to wait another 10 or 15 minutes to finally order.  By this time, the place was filling up, and it became clear that the personal service that is so great was also acting as a major hindrance.  One waiter, in charge of taking orders, delivering food, doing the cashiering, and everything, could not possibly spend all that time with each table and individual guest, explaining the menu and everything without jeopardizing the wait time.\\n\\nAfter another 30 minutes or so, which is understandable if the kitchen is trying to prepare 9 dishes at once, our food finally arrived.  The dishes were generous in portions, and full of fragrant spices and herbs.  Since we were all sharing, I can't possibly remember what was had, but it was all very, very good.\\n\\nAnd of course, once we were done, we had to wait, again, to pay our bill.  But the waiter was wonderful, and after totaling it up, split it evenly for each of us so we didn't have to worry about doing the calculations on our own.\\n\\nThe space of the restaurant isn't a whole lot to look at, with under-watted bulbs recessed, leading to a dark, but flat and very non-romantic, atmosphere.  But there are some booths separated from the main dining area with curtains, which could make for a more intimate setting.\\n\\nThe food is definitely fantastic, and I wouldn't mind returning, but perhaps with a smaller group, and maybe with reservations as well.  The waiter/manager provides excellent personal service and explains the intricacies of Bangladeshi cuisine, but he could probably use another waiter."},{"name":"Miller's Ale House - Kirkman Rd","address":"5573 S Kirkman Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"3","text":"Great drink specials, extensive menu.

After snapping a few pictures I entered and spoke to the host for a bit before taking my seat and waiting for my group to slowly filter in - after ten minutes all members were accounted for, water was poured, and menus were delivered.\\n\\nChatting for a short while before ordering I was impressed by the lack of pressure from the waiters as I've found this a problem at many Columbus fine-dining establishments in the past - at no point did we feel hasseled, rushed, or pressured - a definite plus.  With my colleagues opting for wine and beers (an appropriately named Delerium Tremens was particularly notable on the list) we first ordered some appetizers for the table - namely the cheese plate and fried green tomatoes.  Beginning with the cheese plate, for $14 we received three anemic portions of relatively common American cheeses, a basket of boring baguette slices, and some raisins - compared to Luce I couldn't have been more disappointed and would certainly not order this again.\\n\\nThe second appetizer, originally intended to be sharred with our vegetarian student, was the tomato dish - unfortunately my attending forgot until 10 minutes after ordering that it contained chorizo and asked if the order could be augmented to which received a flat \\"no.\\"  While I found this strange as it took another 10-15 minutes for the dish to be delivered and I do suspect the server could've been a little more accomidating, I will admit the dish was excellent and I didn't mind having more to myself.  Described as fried green tomato with chorizo, chihuahua cheese and corn vinaigrette the tomato was very well prepared with a delicate snap on the outside yet smooth and sweet inside.  Adding to the dish was a spicy yet understated chorizo that contrasted well with the mild cheese and sweet yet savory corn studded dressing.\\n\\nFollowing the appetizers my colleagues each opted for a main course and another drink while I selected a salad and a water refill.  Arriving shortly after we finished appetizers the tomato stack with lump crab, shaved vidalias, greens, chopped amish egg cheddar and cabernet buttermilk dressing was an absolute knockout of a dish - both in presentation and in taste.  Incredibly fresh heirloom tomatos that could very well have been picked immediately prior to service were stacked 4 slices high with layers of fresh and delicate crab, crisp and textural greens, and pungent yet well tempered vidalias.  Mellowing out the sharper flavors and pulling the whole dish together was the mild and aromatic egg cheddar (a cheese far superior to any on the cheese plate in flavor and texture) and the absolutely divine buttermilk dressing with mild alcoholic base notes.\\n\\nFor our mains one of my attendings opted for the 4oz tournedo of beef topped with roquefort potatoes, broccoli, and bacon vinaigrette while the vegetarian amongst us ordered the rustichella spaghetti with zucchini noodles, shaved golden zucchini and basil pesto and noted that he'd have trouble going back to eating \\"normal\\" pasta any time soon - it certainly looked and smelled excellent.  For myself and one of my attending's the order of the night was Alana's nightly risotto - this time featuring sun gold tomatos, sweet corn, goat cheese, and lump crab.  Enormous in portion and toothsome yet smooth in texture I must admit I found the risotto to be quite excellent and the creamy cheese and mild crab proved an excellent foil to the sweet and 'al dente' corn and tomatos.  Accompanying our mains was a basket of white and rye breads plus a fairly generic and boring olive oil - thankfully there was plenty of sauce to be sopped up from the risotto.\\n\\nAfter a meal prepared with such skill dessert was a no brainer - and true to the form of (seemingly) every other restaurant in Columbus the accompaniments to each dessert was a no brainer as well - Jeni's Ice Cream.  While my companions decided on the Vanilla Lavender Creme Brulee and Chocolate Zucchini Pound Cakes accompanied with Wildberry Lavender and Kona Stout, respectively I decided to go with the Peach Plum Frangipaine Tart with Honey Vanilla Bean.  Served in large portion I found the almond based tart to be quite tasty and well paired with the ice cream selection, but I rather wished the peaches and plus had been a bit sweeter given the fact that we are in the midst of stonefruit season.\\n\\nAll in all I must admit I was quite pleased with the food at Alana's in terms of quality, quantity, and skill of preparation.  Service was adequate if not overly friendly - something that clearly is table dependant as we saw our waiter as well as the chef herself visit a table of older \\"regulars\\" frequently - and the setting is quite attractive, secluded, and intimate.  As a fan of natural/organic/locavore approaches to food I'd certainly not hesitate to recommend Alana's among the ten best in Cbus."},{"name":"Two Urban Licks","address":"820 Ralph McGill Blvd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I made an 8:30 pm reservation for me and my wife at Two Urban Licks. We arrived on-time but they told us they were running behind by 10-15 minutes. We were not seated until 9:00 pm, a full 30 minutes after our reservation. Our waiter told us that many of the entree choices were out. We selected from the recommended remaining entrees. The salmon chips appetizer was excellent and represented the one good thing about the restaurant. The dinner bread came out late, after we had already been sitting for 25 minutes. The entrees, when they finally came, were extremely disappointing. The lamb shank was served in a pot with corn. The lamb was completely tasteless. To compensate, it seems the chef decided to spice the HELL out of the corn. It was extremely hot and I had to pick my way around the corn because it was inedible. Even still, I had a very bad \\"digestive experience\\" the next day. My wife's sole fish was all breading. Never in my entire life have I seen a thinner fried fish. She would have gotten better with a fastfood fish establishment. Overall, the entrees were a complete disaster and not worth $8, let alone mid-twenty dollar plates. They were worse than a country-kitchen buffet. The waiter never, not even once, asked how our food was. So much for professional courtesy. When I used the restroom and saw how dirty it was, I swore to myself I'd never come here again. Beneath the very thin veneer of hipsterism and tattooed waiters, you will find that Two Urban Licks serves food that is overpriced and mediocre at best, with lousy service.  Their true values became evident when we were leaving. The free valet parking guy, handing us our key, asked \\"do you need change or anything?\\" Blatantly fishing for a tip lacks class and is very unprofessional. I gave Two Urban Licks 2-stars because I did eat here three times before and had positive experiences. But if a restaurant serves crap just one time, they forever lose my trust.

Eat somewhere else. The building is super cool and full of Boston history. It's a charming place. Poke around the various corners, look at the pictures, and read the history. \\n\\nThe food is expensive and generally ranges from acceptable to really bad. Don't bother with the oysters. You'd think a place called \\"Union Oyster House\\" would know how to open them. They might have at some point but they don't know. They open them vertically by sticking a knife in one end and banging the knife handle on a brick. The delicious oysters juice spills out, the oyster is cut. Often a bunch of shell parts remain. They solve that by rinsing the oysters in tap water. The end result is a glob that tastes mostly of mud and chlorine, and for which they have the temerity to change $3.\\n\\nThe rest of the food is priced similarly. From $17 for fish and chips to $29 for a basic entree that's not particularly well made. E.g. lobsters are steamed, expensive, and tasteless. The place clearly makes its living based on its history because it's food is no better than a low-end chain restaurant. \\n\\nMy suggestion is to go for lunch, have a bowl of chowder, and then go to a place with good food for dinner.

Once we were seated we quickly realized it was  going to be a LOOOOONNNNGGGG dinner. It took about 45 minutes for all of us to get our first drinks. The waiters were nowhere to be found and came by every once in a while. Once we finally locked someone down to take our order, we were all finished with our first drinks. This is about an hour into the meal... We waited on someone to come by to take or next order and nobody ever did. My friend, who works in the hospitality industry, finally got up and went and found someone to take our drink order, which took another 15 minutes to fulfill. The courses came out in a really strange way too. We all ordered an app and entree, some of us sharing amongst the group. While many people got both of their dishes at the same time, some of us got nothing!! We were so confused and when it was mentioned to the waiter, he said something like Thats how I put in the orders, yours is coming out soon! So Bizarre!! Once the dishes came out everything was good, except we hadn't seen our waiter in a while and everyone's drinks were empty again. The same friend saw another table next to us talking to the manager and being so annoyed by this time, asked to speak with him too once he finished up. Not sure what the convo was but we finally got someone to bring us our last drink order. I must say it was a Friday or Saturday and they were really busy but the server's attitude throughout the whole thing was what was the worst. At the end they brought a glass of champagne to everyone and apologized for the issues.

A short walk from the complex of shops and restaurants known as Faneuil Hall, the restaurant has both an exterior and interior that fortunately have resisted change. The famous semi-circular Oyster Bar is the original. Exposed brick walls, weathered floors, low beamed ceilings, lots of dark wood, and Early American oil paintings and prints contribute to the sense of history that permeates the various dining areas. The Union Oyster House is not one of those institutions that flourishes despite a no-longer-deserved reputation or due simply to the tourist trade. The food is exceptional, as the locals who regularly flock here will tell you. This is one of my regular stops whenever I'm in Boston. The last time we were here, we started with the hot Oyster House Sampler for two, a medley of grilled oysters, baked stuffed cherrystone clams, Clams Casino, Oysters Rockefeller, and shrimp scampi. We couldn't resist adding an order of Mussels, Basque Style, steamed with garlic and white wine and served with buttery-moist garlic bread, perfect for sopping up every last drop of the broth. The famed Oyster House Clam Chowder, densely creamy and thick, is almost mandatory. Finding it difficult to choose one item from the many entrees, we selected two combo platters - the Sauteed Seafood Medley, a melange of shrimp, cherrystone clams, mussels, scrod, and calamari sauteed in a spicy marinara sauce and served over linguine, and the Broiled Seafood Platter, swordfish, salmon, scallops, scrod and grilled shrimp served with parsley new potatoes.

We were about 5th in line and so when doors opened at 5:30 we were promptly seated at a nice table by the window. Must have been the Pemberton festival weekend where all the hipsters went that allowed us a minimal wait, but I'm thankful! Funny enough, both our phones died around dinner time so we spent a bit of time looking at the menu trying to decipher all the unfamiliar ingredients, unable to stealthy check Google to see what they were.. We had to ask the server for assistance. We ordered the meatball appetizer, the nero spaghetti with clam and octopus and bison ragu tagliatelle to share. Portions are on the smaller side but you do get full. Prices are on the higher end at $22-24 per pasta dish. The pasta was all right, but not mind blowing. I was slightly disappointed with the bison ragu, it didn't taste particularly distinctive, but rather  like regular lean ground beef. At least the pasta was cooked perfectly al dente.\\n\\nThere's something ironic about paying high end prices in a location like Luigi's, although I understood that going in.

A lot of the light in the room seems to come as reflection off the giant Buddha statue at one end, which gives it a really nice atmosphere (but I have to admit that I am partial to the fat-jolly Chinese buddha as opposed to this thinner Thai Buddha).  \\n\\nOur food was all perfectly fine; the crab fried rice was tasty, but could have used more crab chunks, and the crispy pad thai was a nice change of pace, but I would probably stick to the regular pad thai next time (although I am glad I tried it, I've never seen it anywhere else).

It was a very thick crust of peppercorn on top. I found that it overpowered the steak too much, but that is my personal preference.  The bone marrow that came with it was lovely. They do not serve any crackers or bread with it, as it's really meant to be smothered on the steak. The bone marrow just over powers the steak too much to be enjoyed in that fashion. I enjoy having bone marrow on its own as it's so rich and wonderful on its own. I thoroughly enjoyed my 28 Day Prime Aged Rib Eye. It was very flavorful and cooked very well. It was served with delightful sweet peppers and fried onion strips. \\n\\nWe also shared the sauteed local mushrooms and creamed spinach.  The mushrooms were wonderful and cooked very well. The creamed spinach was bland for my liking and didn't add anything to our meal. I would recommend skipping the spinach but definitely go for the mushrooms. \\n\\nThe service was wonderful and our waitress was very great. She was very attentive and quick to make sure our drinks were never empty. \\n\\nAll in all, the seafood tower is something you should skip. The steaks were wonderful and cooked to our liking. Go for the mushroom side but skip the creamed spinach. I'll be back for another special event, but now I know to just stick with the steaks and skip the starter."},{"name":"Mary Mac's Tea Room","address":"224 Ponce De Leon Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"The food was good. However, the service was really, really, very, painfully sloooow. \\n\\nThis was our second time here, we brought family from out of town with us this time. We were sat at a table that tilted at about a 28 degree angle because of a slant in the floor, (these slants run wild throughout the restaurant so be careful. But, this is the first time I have ever sat at a slanted table anywhere I felt like I was on Punk'd). So, it made keeping your drinks on the table difficult (we had three spills, two drinks and a side dish of mashed potatoes). It didn't help that they were slow about removing plates in the way and refills. My wife and her mom ordered fried chicken and asked for their fried chicken (a house specialty), to be prepared well done. It came back not as well done as they liked. The Server was fairly busy, but she didn't do an average job checking on us. When we finally told her about the chicken she said \\"All the chicken comes out the same way\\" something she should have said when they asked for it well done and extra crisp. \\n\\nWhen three of us got our food, my wife had to wait an extra ten minutes for her food to come out although she and her mom ordered the same thing besides the side items. She was upset because when it came out, the order was incomplete, (She is 39 1/2 weeks pregnant incidentally, which is why she asked for her chicken well dinner and was very hungry). She does not eat until her food is all on the table so she can eat the things she likes together. By the time her sides and bread came the chicken was cold and not cooked the way she liked. New mama was very disappointed. \\n\\nIf the restaurant management reads this, I hope they work on training staff to check on people more often, getting things right the first time, making people feel like they want a person's business (it is the hospitality business after all), being willing to go a little out of their way to please, because these are things essential to any service related business and it creates customer loyalty. Businesses have to learn to be better than their products. Good products are important, (in this case fried chicken and such) but good service execution makes a person add value to the product and want it again. I hope they do better next time."},{"name":"Hooters","address":"425 W Riverside","city":"Austin","stars":"2","text":"Slowest service ever worst service ever wasn't greeted for 40 mins food came out cold and didn't get half the shit I ordered"},{"name":"Frank","address":"407 Colorado St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"During a recent visit to downtown Austin on hot midday I decided to stop by Frank since it had such good reviews.

Thai Spoon won, but within 5 minutes of taking a seat we already began to have second thoughts.\\n\\nTo begin with it took nearly 10 minutes for anyone come back to our table after seating us with the menus. No water, no \\"do you need a couple more minutes?\\", nothing. And it's not like the place was busy; only 1, maybe 2 other tables.\\n\\nOK, kind of a bad start, and we waited quite a long time for our Salad Rolls to be delivered. Seriously, what the hell were you doing back there, making pounding out the rice paper from scratch? Waiting for the basil and carrot harvest? They were actually delicious, and quite a good size - 2 rolls, roughly 8\\" long, sliced in half - but I' d have appreciated a bit more of the sweet chili sauce.\\n\\nMy Lady ordered the Tom Yum soup with tofu. She thought the flavor was alright, though a little salty (from my taste I agree), and by the amazing scarcity of tofu you'd think it was trading at twice the price of saffron! All in all it was a sub-par soup, but paled in comparison of suckiness to my Beef Jungle curry.\\n\\nNow, I don't often eat Thai curries (usually preferring stir fry or noodle dishes), and I've never had a \\"Jungle\\" curry before but it was described identically to the Red Curry but sans coconut milk, which I think sometimes masks the subtle flavors of Thai food. Anyway, it arrived at my table looking EXACTLY like My Lady's Tom Yum soup; so much so that I really thought it was the same broth with beef rather than tofu - after tasting it I could tell it was different, but like the soup it suffered from too much salt. The curry was so thin and watery that I've since looked at all the \\"jungle curry\\" recipes google could show me and none of those with pictures looked anything like what they served at Thai Spoon.\\n\\nI can't complain about the quantity of beef, but the meat didn't look good and tasted worse. I'd have to describe the thing, gristly, fatty meat as \\"prison grade\\" but I I know a cook at a correctional facility and I doubt she'd serve this to the juvenile offenders she serves! Seriously, EWW!\\n\\nI'd say I'm being generous by giving Thai Spoon 2*s, but as I say I'm not the BIGGEST connoisseur of Thai curries so maybe that's pretty standard for what you'd get when you order Jungle Curry. But the low quality meat, paucity of tofu in the soup, and poky service definitely have this place flirting dangerously with a 1* rating.\\n\\nMaybe the Pad Kee Mow is good, maybe they serve edible cuts of chicken, maybe they make a mean stir fry, but personally I can't see ever returning to find out because with so many great Thai options in pdx, why waste time with a place that has already proven itself to suck so thoroughly?\\n\\nHonestly, if you can't find better Thai food in Portland than Thai Spoon, then you're just not trying hard enough!"},{"name":"Frank","address":"407 Colorado St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Overpriced but very tasty.

So I dragged myself out and went down Burnet looking for some place new. That's how I found myself at Elsi's door, and to be honest it was not what I was expecting at all. The helvetica font of the sign and the contemporary design of the building it was in betrayed the traditional (by American standards) mexican interior. I was kind of worried at first not only because Mexican food and early mornings don't usually work well for me, and because I'm about done with Tex-Mex as an option for dining out. But the mention of Latin plates and papusas outside gave me an added confidence. The menu certainly had plenty of items you might see at a generic \\"mexican\\" food restaurant in Austin, but there were certainly things that made this place unique, and by unique I mean Salvadorian cuisine and not tex-mex (you will see a strong anti-tex-mex theme in any of my reviews of restaurants). I wanted to get the green bean plate which consisted of (don't quote me) green beans sliced poblano chile, a fried egg, a sweet 5.99 pricetag, and I believe rice and beans on the side, but that was on the lunch menu. Instead I got the pescado chipotle which was a lightly breaded tilapia covered in a chipotle sauce with rice and a salad on the side. Nothing special about the presentation, I did get some corn tortillas on the side as well. The tilapia was great and if the sauce hadn't soaked through the corn tortilla on my first attempt at a taco I would have done it that way and wasted the salad with as a filler. Fortunately I didn't because I noticed that the salad was actually made with fresh lettuce carrot and gasp cucumbers. I asked the waiter about it, being used as I am to crap bagged pre cut lettuce \\"salads\\" as a side at tex-mex restaurants and he said everything was made in house, although the dressings certainly aren't but we'll forgive him on that. Overall the meal was excellent and to top it off I had a big glass of canteloupe juice with some coffee and a cigarette at the end \\n(they don't let you smoke on the patio so I had to hang out in the parking lot). The canteloupe juice was a surprise and was definitely made in house as evidenced by the chunks of canteloupe floating in it. I was very pleased with this little surprise of a restaurant and look to go back and check out the papusas. Their commitment to in-house preparation is laudable and has a great end-result, so if you want something a little different but not wildly exotic, that you can bring your less adventurous friends to go to Elsi's. \\n\\nPS. I don't think they're doing so well, and there are some great discounts to reel in customers."},{"name":"It's Italian Cucina","address":"1500 South Lamar Blvd, Ste 110","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I've never left a review for a restaurant I didn't like but I'm still pretty annoyed with my experience dining at this place.

When placing our order the waitress talked me out of ordering a reasonably priced pasta into the cheese ravioli which I only found out when the check came was $25 (this sentence was mainly to express my disappointment in myself for succumbing to peer pressure). We also ordered a bottle of prosecco and a bottle of wine which they served to us in the same glasses. The waitress literally told me to finish my drink (it was goodheartedly but still) so she could pour me a drink from a different bottle in the same glass. Lastly the waitress began clearing our plates before everyone was finished. Anywhere else this wouldn't justify a 1 star review but if you are going to charge me $25 for a regular old plate of ravioli please at least treat me to the fine dining experience aka attempt to accommodate dietary needs, don't be stingy on glassware, and don't rudely clear plates before the table is finished.

You order by writing down your own order and giving it to the server. I love this because you do not have to explain what you want-unless you have a question about something on the menu. This also cuts down on time for your server because they can go ahead and put your order in ASAP!

The grits were great-rich, creamy, buttery; the scallops were soft,delicate and cooked to perfection; the tomato based sauce was delicious and melded all elements together. I also tried the very tasty BBQ chicken with very rich and creamy mac and cheese, and the fillet of sole which was simply seasoned and nicely flavored. Another diner I was with who got the scallops thought hers were served a bit too cold. Not the case with mine though. \\n\\nService was good except for a gaffe to kick off our night. I believe our server may have sent our food order in way too quickly because the entrees came out entirely too fast- right as we were eating our appetizer.

I think it was just a mistake but still it was a bit off putting. \\n\\nDrinks here are strong and there is a nice selection to please all. Prices are reasonable for a nice dinner out. The bathroom situation is stupid. There are like 5 unisex individual bathrooms, so people are just waiting and waiting. I mean c'mon just make a big mens room and womens room and save everyone the headache. As I said before the valet scene was insane..it looked like throngs of people were waiting a long time. It took a while to get a cab from the restaurant which should not be the case with a fine restaurant. Desserts we had, flourless chocolate cake and bread pudding, were par for the course. \\n\\nLive music was a nice touch. Good place.

I must preface this review by saying I'm from NYC and I love Southern food, but I may not be the best judge there is. That being said, I was a big fan.\\n\\nIt's a huge place. There are tons of tables, all sizes and it's good for groups and kids. We came with a group of 7 at 7pm on Saturday night and were seated within 20 minutes. When you get to your table, you write down your own order, including drinks. I was not a huge fan of the writing of the drinks since we were super thirsty and would have liked to order that right away before everyone had to decide on food. But it worked out okay, I guess.\\n\\nThere is so much to choose from! And the sides, oh my oh my the sides. There is even an option to just order 4 sides. I was tempted, but decided to sample from others instead of doing that. \\n\\nA large amount of cornbread, yeast rolls (dinner rolls that are super soft and yummy) and cinnamon rolls came out to start. The cinnamon rolls were show stopping good. I could have eaten just that. We also were given the pot likker for free because it was our first visit. We didn't know what it was...turns out it is turnip greens liquified into broth that you crush pieces of cornbread in and eat with a spoon. It smells horrible...tastes ok. I finished mine. My husband liked it. No one else took more than one bite. Good to try once...would never order again.\\n\\n\\nI ordered the four piece fried chicken. It's a breast, wing and legs and includes two sides. After much pondering and deliberation with my husband, I picked fried green tomatoes and cornbread stuffing. The chicken was great (not the best, not the worst) and very juicy inside and crispy outside. The stuffing was AMAZING. So so good. The fried green tomatoes were breaded really nicely, but the portion was a little small (not that it mattered with all the other food I ate).\\n\\nHubby ordered chicken and dumplings. It was fantastic, best I've ever had. He had mac and cheese (so cheesy, so delicious but a little over salty) and sweet potato souffle. The sweet potatoes were sweet and delicious, covered with a little marshmallow. \\n\\nOther things I tried: chicken pot pie (HUGE, yummy and the pie part was fabulous). Someone else had cinnamon apples and said they were awesome. \\n\\nWe had young children and picky eaters in our group and everyone was super pleased with the food and choice of restaurant.

We ordered a large (only 14in) with jalapenos and chicken on the regular crust. It was decent. When I first took a bite I was rather disappointed with the lack of flavor. Maybe they could put an olive oil and spice mixture on the outside crust to flavor it up? The toppings were good flavor wise, but the chicken was sparse. The jalapenos on the other hand were excellent. They were cut just perfectly where they were not overpowering and provided that little bit of kick. The workers were very nice and asked if I had any questions about the pizza or the toppings when I was looking at the menu. I know that seems like normal customer service but it was a nice change since Boston seems to lack customer service skills. Normally I go to Sal's, where I can get a huge 19in pizza for $12 and it looks like I'll keep going there.

Sigh."},{"name":"Greeley Avenue Bar & Grill","address":"5421 N Greeley Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"What is a \\"dive bar\\"?  The word gets thrown around quite a bit, but can you ACTUALLY define a dive?\\n\\nHead on over to Yorgo's at the corner of N Greeley and Killingsworth and you will find yourself in the quintessential dive bar.  Happy hour and drink specials abound, with different food & drink specials for each day of the week (but they seem to change whenever someone behind the bar finds the right pen for the dry-erase board) and though they only have a handful of micros on tap, they are priced right in the $3 range ($2 during the 4-6pm daily HH), with PBR correspondingly cheaper.\\n\\nBut you don't go to Yorgo's for the beer.  No my friend, the well is where it's at.  Friday's 6pm-close $2.50 wells (this one's been pretty constant for a while now).  And we're talking minimum 6 second pours, served in a fat tumbler.  Believe me, order a G&T and the you'll swear the splash of tonic is just for color.  Upgrade to top shelf for about $1 more if you must, but DO NOT drive home after 2 drinks.\\n\\nYou don't want to know about their food do you?  It's pretty much all greasy fried (rings, fries, popcorn chicken, etc), though they do have some sandwiches and burgers (if you try one you're braver than I am) and depending on who's cooking (and how much you've had to drink) range from decent to barely edible. Again, the current/most recent Friday special was 2-for-1 apps.\\n\\nInside the bar has a hideously charming funk of smoke & urinal cakes. They seem to have finally replaced the old malfunctioning jukebox (with the volume permaset to 11) with a thoroughly modern (and completely inappropriate) digital video juke, but they usually have the volume muted in favor of the tvs which always are playing hunting, military, or \\"survival man\\" type programs (exception being when there's a football game or MMA match).  There never seems to be a problem finding a seat as the place is deceptively spacious, and they've got the usual assortment of video crack, golf (some edition of Golden Tee I believe), and a couple pool tables that have probably had a fair number of beers spilled on them.\\n\\nThe bartenders are surly, but never straight up rude, and don't get offended if they serve the regulars before you...they've earned the special treatment, and you can too if you can match their commitment to excellence.\\n\\nSpeaking of regulars, Yorgo's has many.  Pick a day and time to check it out, return that same day and time the following week and you WILL see the same faces.  For many, Yorgo's is not a bar, it's a way of life.  It doesn't hurt that it's so close to Swan Island, so when it's quitting time the crowd becomes overwhelmingly, though not entirely, blue collar.\\n\\nTo truly enjoy the Yorgo's experience though, and I cannot stress this enough, you MUST take your drink out on the deck, and you must do this regardless of whether it's a sweltering 102 degrees, raining sideways, or snowing.  The deck at Yorgo's is ALWAYS open.  And, though they may teasingly mock you, they will provide you with an umbrella if you ask nicely.\\n\\nOn any given day, from the deck of Yorgo's you may see:\\n\\n-Teens with no survival instinct hop off the bus,dart into the street, and get hit by a motorcycle\\n-Little men in \\"classy\\" IROCs running a red light directly in front of a cop\\n-Shaggy-haired meth freaks chain-towing their rusty pickups up and over the sidewalk\\n-Hottie Adidas employees jogging up Greeley\\n-Morons in Subies rear-ending the car in front as they oogle said hotties\\n-Tri-met bus drivers honking at and flipping off oblivious drivers who remain stopped and texting on phones while the light turns green\\n-Sketchy looking young turks selling \\"cigarettes\\" to cars stopped at the intersection\\n-Emergency vehicles with sirens and lights glaring heading northbound on Greeley, followed by emergency vehicles with sirens and lights glaring heading southbound just seconds later\\n-An unusually high concentration of classic Impalas, or Comets, or Falcons, or the like, cruising by (give them a \\"whoop\\" and a thumbs up, they like that)\\n\\nYorgo's is definitely worth a visit and it's so cheap even if you learn that you hate the place, it's not a painful lesson."},{"name":"Grass Fed","address":"605 Centre St","city":"Jamaica Plain","stars":"3","text":"Love the hotdogs and the fact they have beer and some liquor to serve as well.

A good friend recommended this place, I came from out of town. Therefore, on a Saturday night I did not make reservations however I was seated right away while others were waiting for their tables. That was awesome! Patio seats with a great view. But that excitement died down when we had to wait about 35 minutes for our waitress to even introduce herself. She was nice and had a great personality so we were again excited. Ordered the famous Salmon Chips.. and they were delicious! Our entrees Beef Brisket and Smoked Brisket was okay. It wasn't over the top for me as compared to what others say. They definitely could've charged more and people would've paid for it due to the restaurant's atmosphere. Luckily, they did not.. because it wasn't worth it in my opinion. In all honesty, I think the food was a-okay.. I didn't get to desserts but reading the menu, I think they would've been much more worth it. Anyhow, while we ate the waitress did come by to ask how we were doing and stated she would refill my water... 25 minutes.. still no water. So 45 minutes had passed and we were becoming very impatient and increasingly unsatisfied.. we finally had to raise our hands to a different waiter to clear our table and get our check. He was nice, kind.. and as soon as he left.. he must've passed word to our waitress.. because she came over immediately. She obviously was unhappy with us and did come give us our check. We tipped her our typical 20% because even though we were unhappy, we figured it was just one of those bad nights.\\nIn conclusion.. my biggest disappointment was with the service and then the food. Maybe I had high expectations based on reviews.. but it really was a downer. In total, we lost about an hour and a half waiting... That's just horrible. People who sat after us even ate and left. My tip would probably be not to get the patio seats, even though I enjoyed where I sat.. But that could've been the reason for lack of service. I don't plan to return there.. but if there is a next time, I'm going to stick to appetizers and dessert."},{"name":"Broder Caf√©","address":"2508 SE Clinton St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"I've enjoyed this restaurant every time I've been, but when I leave the heavy food hits and lethargy sets in."},{"name":"Checkers","address":"5503-A S Semoran Blvd.","city":"Orlando","stars":"2","text":"Checkers is great!

I'd driven by the restaurant, which is right next to Wisteria on N. Highland, and was also curious to check it out.\\n\\nThey offer complimentary valet in the small private lot next to the restaurant, which they share with the other restaurants on this corner.\\n\\nThere was no wait on the Sunday evening we visited, and only a few tables were occupied. We sat ourselves and waited a few minutes for our server to drop by for our drink orders. Our drinks came pretty quickly, but then sat for about 10 minutes before our server dropped by to take our food orders, which seemed odd since the restaurant was so empty. It was more casual than I expected, with retro signs and collectibles all around as decoration. Reminded me a little of Palookaville but with a lot more restraint. \\n\\nWe started with the fried pickles, which were tasty if a little more salty than I'm accustomed to. I wish there had been a little more dip for all the pickles because the creamy dressing helped balance out the salt.\\n\\nFor mains, she ordered the meatball burger and fries, while I went for the pork and green chiles with a side salad. The salad came covered with diced cucumbers, which I hadn't been expecting - I am not a cucumber fan, but I can pull off the slice or two that normally comes on. The food runner, though, was completely awesome and took the salad back to bring me one that was without cukes. Hooray! The avocado dressing was okay, but I think I prefer my usual blue cheese. The roast pork, though, was heavenly. It came with a homemade tortilla and a fried egg on top, and I'm pretty sure I would scooped it all in my mouth at once if that were humanly possible. The pork was so tender and moist, and the seasoning was great. Almost traditional chili flavor, but the roasted green chiles kept it from being boring. It was also full of kidney beans, which was a tasty surprise. The tortilla was to die for (I could have made an entire meal of just those).\\n\\nMy godmother was equally delighted with her burger. They apparently grill the meatballs on the flattop, and the outside gets sort of crisp, while the inside stays soft. Instead of marinara like you might find on a meatball sub, they use a tomato jam. So you still get the essence of the Italian flavors but all slightly different. I didn't taste it, but I did see that it was massive and she kept making noises of joy, so I think we have to assume it was amazing. \\n\\nOverall, the food was terrific, but the service was more disappointing than not. Still, the food was so good, I think four stars is just about perfect."},{"name":"Union Oyster House","address":"41 Union St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Great place to have a beer in the oldest restaurant.

Maybe it attracts customers who have never had authentic Thai food? Or taste buds maybe... \\n\\nFOOD: Poor Calvin's prices are absurdly overpriced for the quality of food served. \\n\\n1. Pineapple Fried Rice: Soggy. Way too much curry powder. Presentation doesn't trump taste! For $22, this fried rice needs to be the best fried rice of my life!\\n\\n2. Pad Thai: Mediocre. The noodles were slightly undercooked, & the taste just did not suit my aunt or father, who both ordered it, or me, who tried it lol However, I could understand how others may enjoy it. But for $22, NO NO NO. \\n\\n3. Grouper Red Curry: For $25, this red curry comes with breaded, deep fried, overly salty, thin, & possible frozen grouper strips! Am I wrong to envision a fresh chunk (perhaps a relatively small chunk but at least a fresh one!) of high quality grouper? I know you're not importing your red curry paste from Bangkok itself! At least have our $25 be worth SOMETHING. Instead, you just throw every type of vegetable under the sun into the curry sauce & call it a day. \\n\\n4. Grilled Chilean Sea Bass: I cannot offer my opinion on this entree bc I did not try it. However, given my experience with the previous 3 entrees, I do not have high hopes. $29 for this small dish. \\n\\n5. Chicken Coconut Soup: A bit on the sweet side, but I did enjoy this soup. $6 a cup is a bit much, however. \\n\\n6. Fried Calamari: Decent, not too chewy, but not impressive. At Bonefish Grill, you pay the same price & get double the amount at double the quality :P \\n\\nDRINKS: I ordered the Jalepeno Mango mixed drink, & although strong, it was way too sweet, and the flavors did not mix well at all.

I would not recommend this drink at all, but I would recommend this restaurant hire a mixologist. \\n\\nATMOSPHERE: This restaurant could have nice atmosphere on a slow night, but on a Saturday night, it was loud, cramped, and a bit uncomfortable. We were sat at a high top smack dab in the middle of the restaurant, and we ended up having to share our table with a random dude who was waiting for a table with the rest of his party who was seated on the couch behind us. Of course we didn't mind him occupying one of our extra seats (we had 3 of them), but this is how cramped that place was. Other people had to just stand while they waited, which is fine, but the restaurant is so small the poor waiters had trouble just delivering food to the tables. It was also so loud, which can be typical for busy restaurants, but I just feel this restaurant may attract the wrong crowd as I heard many, many very loud shouts and a few curse words loudly thrown around. So perhaps not good for families. My boyfriend also witnessed a customer get smacked in the face with the welcome sign. Poor guy. \\n\\nSERVICE: Service was alright. My mother, father, grandmother, & I got our water refills, but my aunt & my boyfriend were neglected lol \\n\\nOVERALL: For the high prices of your entrees, PLEASE use higher quality ingredients. How can you serve fusion Thai when nothing about your food is even remotely close to Thai? If you want good, authentic Thai food for a fraction of the price, go to Zab-E-Lee on Old National Highway. If you want Thai Fusion, go ANYWHERE else. From browsing the photos on Yelp, I think the menu changes frequently. If prices weren't so RIDICULOUSLY HIGH, I would give this place another shot. Unfortunately, I won't be back.\\n\\nUPDATE: If I could take off the 1 star I gave this place, I would after reading the rude, grammatically devastating, & highly unprofessional message its owner sent me after reading my review:\\n\\nHi, thank you for the view and letting us know your experience... i deftly will take it and work on some issues, how ever i just want to let you know, Poor Calvin's are known for Thai Asian Fusion. I have own a traditional Authentic restaurant before and Poor Calvin is the 2 location that i have open and we never wanted to be traditional authentic Thai. My grandma has taught me how to cook traditional thai food which you can find it anywhere in atlanta....Maybe AT ZAB E-LEE ON OLD NATIONAL HIGHWAY... How ever we are base in Midtown Atlanta, If you are looking for something erosional and cheap midtown is deftly not the right place to eat... We don't use cheap ingredient as you discribe on the review. Most of my Meat other seafood or meat are all organic, all nature and even all vegetables are organic food.... onions are sweet vadailla onions and everything we are serving are special order just for our restaurant....We do not have a bartender, but we do have a professional mixologist in house that have a degree for it, That is also the reason why we are so popular in atlanta, how ever we wanted to thank you for dining at Poor Calvin's and sorry for all the bad experience you have...Again thank you for the reviews."},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"I had the famous bacon maple bar but did not actually go to Voodoo to get it, so I have been torn about whether or not I can justify a review.

I knew nothing about this restaurant, but it doesn't take much to discern that a restaurant already bustling at 5:30 PM is doing something well (although their bar, where tapas are also served, does open at 4 PM).  This beautiful Peruvian restaurant is located in the cobblestone-lined, reclaimed warehouse section of the Pearl District.  An upscale restaurant fitting of its trendy neighborhood.  There is a vibrant, warm feel to the dining areas, at turns like a wine cellar but in the main dining room, rimmed with windows on two sides, it is bright and festive.\\n\\nTo simply sample Andina's offerings was difficult.  The menus include the dizzying list of starters (entradas), functionally tapas that can be customized to one of three sizes (pequeno, mediano, or grande), an ingenious way to handle the sharing of small plates.  There is so much here that one could be forgiven for missing the entree menu, but from the reading of those, there's quite a few interesting choices as well, with liberal use of local, seasonal ingredients.\\n\\nService was gracious and professional, with a pleasing genuineness.  After ordering, we were served fresh baked bread with a trio of aj√≠es, Peruvian sauces to go with bread or anything else.  Besides the highly recognizable salsa verde (a lovely version), there's the brightly yellow aj√≠ de maracuya, passionfruit spiced with habanero, and the very interesting, nutty aj√≠ de huacatay.  Savory, creamy, and delicious sauces.\\n\\nEntradas arrived in no order.  De Pescado \\"5 Elementos\\" is their signature ceviche.  Our server suggested mixing the corn kernels and sweet potatoes into the ceviche; as I'd have otherwise sampled these as a chaser, I was happy to appreciate instead the unexpected depth their sweetness added to the dish, cutting across the richness of the fish and sour of lime.\\n\\nMarinated beef heart kebobs were savory, meaty, with a nice bite.  A neat counterpoint to grilled and wonderfully tender octopus kebobs.  Both accompanied by just enough savory sauces to accent.\\n\\nFinished with a causa, a potato puree shaped like a mini cake topped with an assortment of fresh vegetables, artfully decorated with a pre-sliced avocado that looked quite like a wig for the causa.  While less complex that the other tapas, it is surprisingly refreshing.\\n\\nIn just this small sampling of the cooking at Andina, it impresses.

The hostess stand is kind of in the middle of nowhere and there's no seating for people waiting.\\n\\nThe hostess seated us in a little patio dining area off of the main room that's more of a three-season room with flaps that can roll down to keep the heat in. And then we waited, and waited, and waited. Eventually my fiance got up, alerted one of the waiters that we needed service and one came over quickly and apologetically.\\n\\nThings were good after that, we ordered drinks and an appetizer tasting plate to begin. I believe the tasting plate came with steamed dumplings, calamari and oysters. Yum... For dinner, I ordered the crispy beef and he got the fried chicken with lobster mac and cheese. Man, they were good - but both of us threw in the towel well short of being done. I guess our eyes were bigger than our stomachs after the appetizers and drinks. But we got doggy bags to take home the leftovers and ended up reheating them the next day to great effect.\\n\\nAside from the slightly slow service, which our waitress did her best to make up for the rest of the night, Poor Calvin's was a fun, eclectic and utterly unique experience that I enjoyed for our date night."},{"name":"Communion","address":"129 Church St","city":"Decatur","stars":"3.5","text":"My wife and I came for the 4th of July BBQ celebration.

The wait staff noticed their delay and told they would comp them which was a nice touch. For appetizers we had diver scallops, a ceviche and a rellano dish all of which were great.

I definitely like the fact they have taster options, and so I ended up trying almost every thing. My friend and I wanted to hit up a brewery at some point on our trip here, and we read good things (ahem Thrillst) about this place.\\n\\nFavorites were the From the Wood, Fred, Adam, and the Doggy Claws. I was advised on Foursquare to try anything \\"From the Wood\\" and I was pretty impressed with that since it had the most flavor. Considering I down 6 tasters in matter of half an hour while some these had high ABV, I clearly enjoyed my beer and felt them creep up on me a little.\\n\\nI also liked the setup of this place. Located in some revamped warehouse where you enter through a garage door, with picnic tables outside and ample seating inside. Very lively environment where I even saw one table playing cards while drinking. The service is pretty good, and the waiters know their stuff about the beer. However, i passed on trying the food as my friend and I were still full from eating at the food trucks in downtown. Yep, still full, yet we managed to go drink after. \\n\\nAt first, I wasn't as fond of the place not having an TVs to show any games, but I think the lack of it makes for a better tasting experience there, and thus giving visitors the opportunity to really enjoy the beers, company, and the overall experience."},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Trying to figure out why the scores are lower from other reviews.

Spike's has inspired my new found love for veggie hot dogs. The German Shepard dog (mustard and sauerkraut) is a good standby to get, but they also make more interesting flavor combinations like my favorite, the Samurai (onions and teriyaki sauce) and the T-Bird (swiss cheese and honey-mustard).  Also, I like that the buns are chewy - a bit more substantial than ones you'd get out of your average white wonderbread package.\\n\\nThe poodle fries are not seasoned curlies as you would expect, just french fries that are spiral shaped.

I am not sure why Yelp would remove this review, but here it is again!\\n\\nWith family in town visiting, we were eager to try the one restaurant everyone has been encouraging us to try in Columbus.  Expectations were high, but the feedback we have received gave us every indication this restaurant would appease this group of foodies.\\n\\nThe amuse was ok.  Small bite of sticky rice with some sort of anise seasoning.  It was ok, not memorable or too enticing.  \\n\\nThe menu was very small, but with a constantly fresh and rotating menu, that is understandable.  We were intrigued by the menu items labeled simply, 'a surprise'.  The waiter told us it was always a different dish, and that it was always amazing.  Alana stopped by the table as well, and also mentioned we should always order the surprise.  \\n\\nThe process of ordering and receiving initial drinks took some time.  Comparing our speed of service to that of the table next to us, we were served significantly slower.  At one point a server in a different section came over and asked if we had been greeted by a server yet. \\n\\nWhile waiting for our cocktails to arrive, the busboy dumped an entire glass of iced water directly on my back.  These things happen, he was very apologetic.  Uncomfortable, but hey ... What are you going to do?  I think the biggest disappointment was that our server never acknowledged the fact that I got drenched, and offered no apology.  If you soak me with water, at least buy me a drink!\\n\\nWe shared a couple of appetizers for the first course, the surprise and the tomato stack.  The surprise was squash stuffed with lamb, very good.  The tomato stack was loaded with lump crab, lettuce, and mixed with a Cabernet buttermilk dressing.  We all enjoyed both items very much.  \\n\\nThree of us ordered surprise entrees, and one ordered the seafood past puttanesca.   The surprise was striped bass on plain jasmine rice, saut√©ed root vegetables and a creamy plum sauce.  The fish was spectacular.  Very fresh, cooked perfectly.  The rest of the dish was fairly uninspiring.  Fish, rice, saut√©ed veggies, drenched in a sweet sauce. It was ok, but hardly an epic surprise.  The dish certainly could have been listed as a nightly feature, and it would have been enjoyed just as well.  I like the sense of adventure, but the allure of the surprise didn't quite deliver.   \\n\\nThe pasta puttanesca was very average.  It was a small portion of pasta relative to the extreme amount of sauce, which was a decent tomato sauce.  No anchovy flavor, no capers, not the sharp bold flavors we were expecting from a beloved puttanesca.   \\n\\nAnd to cap the night, we opted for the bread basket to be brought to the table, for a $2 charge.  I don't necessarily have a problem paying a small price for the bread that every other restaurant will give me at no charge.  However, the bread should be good.  The busboy brought us a sack of bread that was so stale, I think it had been sliced hours earlier.  It was so tough, I couldn't even tear it with my hands.  No butter, oil, nothing was delivered with it.  When our server came by, he was horrified to see what the busboy had brought us.  He took away the bread, and rushed another portion right out.  He blamed the busboy, saying it was his first day.  Well, the bread that came out next was not any better.  Tough, extremely chewy, and by the time we received it we were finished with dinner.  Again we brought the disappointing bread to the attention of our server, he told us it is \\"crusty\\" bread, basically telling us that the bread was fine.   Cold stale bread is not crusty, it's just inedible.  \\n\\nTo end it all, when bringing up our concerns to our server, he simply responded with an unenthusiastic 'I'm sorry'.  He didn't seem at all concerned with our poor experience, which was the most disappointing part of the evening.

Damn you Los Angeles), and made a lot of great suggestions. With our servers help we ordered the sweet stuffed peppers, duck with cilantro infused rice, grilled octopus, cebiche, and sashimi.  The duck was probably my favorite dish. The duck came last and I was pretty stuffed but I kept eating because it tasted too delicious. The duck was succulent, tender, and pink in the center. Cooked perfectly. I usually don't eat rice (yea, what kind of Chinese am I?) but I ate up the cilantro rice. Second favorite was the sweet pepper, then octopus, sashimi, and lastly the cebiche.  Every dish had its own flare except the cebiche. I thought the cebiche was good but common.

Does that even exist in Greater Vancouver? Apparently it does. I was impressed by the amount of fancy here. Male servers in slacks and button up shirts, female server dressed in black skirt and fancy top. And above all, cloth napkins. Who would have thought you'd ever see cloth napkins at a Vietnamese restaurant? \\n\\nWith most Vietnamese restaurants, you order your pho, wait a few minutes, scarf it down, pay and be on your way. I'm glad to see that my wife and I can go on a date and actually not feel so rushed. Like a western restaurant, Broken Rice breaks down your starters, mains and desserts. To start we had Uncle Hing's Chicken Wings (tamarind sauce) and the Duck Confit Sliders, both of which were very good. I haven't seen the tamarind wings done elsewhere before and the duck sliders were unique as well. Both were very good. The chicken wings were deep fried and drizzled with their tasty tamarind sauce. I feel like they were made fresh and they hadn't been sitting around too long after they were pulled out from the fryer. The sliders came on a white, soft, Chinese style open face bun (aka bao), folded in half. The insides were a fusion between Chinese style duck with hoisin and green onion (like peking duck but not) and a Vietnamese banh mi. \\n\\nAs much as I liked the appetizers, I think the mains were just average. I had the House Vermicelli, while my wife had the BBQ Beef Short Ribs. I feel like both these dishes could have been from any other restaurant. The House Vermicelli came with a chicken and pork skewer which was nicely grilled. However, I enjoyed the spring roll that came with my meal the best. They have good spring rolls.\\n\\nService was exceptional here. The staff was friendly and attentive. They came over numerous times to make sure we were taken care of in terms of taking empty dishes away and ensuring our tea was always full. \\n\\nSometimes you really do want to have a nice meal at a Vietnamese restaurant and you can't do that at 99% of the other Vietnamese restaurants in town which often have flies buzzing around. Broken Rice allows you to do that. Even though you pay a bit of a premium, it's nice to be able to come and take your time, enjoy your company, and even have a glass of wine if you so wish."},{"name":"Home Slice Pizza","address":"1415 S Congress St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"This is an Austin classic.

I ordered the dolsot bibimbap and my father ordered the Galbi lunch combo. While the bibimbap is a bit lacking in variety of veggie toppings, they're still quite generous with portion size. Furthermore (and this is my favorite part), the stone pot is so sizzling hot that it actually cooks your rice to a nice, burnt, crisp! I haven't found a single other store here that does that! I could not get enough of my crispy rice, and may or may not have been scraping at the bottom of the bowl for the last remaining grains. I'm definitely coming back just for this bibimbap alone! The galbi itself isn't anything too crazy (solid, and you get a lot of very large pieces, but it won't wow your mind), although the lunch combo comes with so many tasty apps that you feel like you're getting your money's worth just in quantity alone. Ours had two ridiculously huge gimbap, two giant mandu, and additional servings of seaweed, bean sprouts, and pickled lettuce. Even better, each of those items was incredibly fresh and tasty.

It was a bustling Saturday evening and we didn't have reservations so we ended up having to wait an hour and a half for seating. Luckily we were able to while away the time by sitting at the attached oyster bar which consisted of oysters, of course, and small plates. It was a separate menu from the actual restaurant side, but nonetheless adequate for light fare. \\n\\nWe started off with a combination of a dozen oysters (like ordering sushi a la carte) from both east and west coast along with the peel and eat shrimp. The oysters were extremely fresh tasting and sweet, my favorite being the Sun oysters from the west coast, which are small but less briny and all sweetness. Note to self: come on Saturday between 3-4pm for the oyster special. Although there were only 6 peel and eat shrimp for $14, they were a nice size but I would not order again. It was good but such a teaser. \\n\\nWhile the food was spot on, the service on the oyster bar side was somewhat snail paced. Luckily we had some time to kill waiting for a table to open up in the restaurant side as there were long points in time before we saw our server between orders and drinks and food arriving. \\n\\nWhen a table finally opened up we were so ready to get on over to the other side. Since our appetites were already somewhat appeased by the teaser shrimp and oysters, we were anxious to get our order in and went straight to the entrees. After viewing pictures on yelp, I decided on the shrimp burger while I was waiting but I was totally disappointed to not see it on the menu. The waitress informed me that they have a new menu daily and many items are switched out. The shrimp burger was one of those revolving items. Quickly getting over my disappointment I eyed the whole branzino and was not disappointed. It was a decent sized fish and the waitress offered to filet it for me, which might be helpful for some, but I declined as \\"what Asian doesn't know how to filet a fish?\\" I got to work on the branzino and boy was it tasty. The flesh was super soft and moist and the yuzu sauce paired with it was the perfect complement to the mild tasting but naturally sweet flesh. It was grilled perfectly without any dryness. I highly recommend it. \\n\\nI can't speak for the other dishes ordered, the mahi mahi and the striped bass, but there seemed to be no complaints from the rest of the party. It was a seafood extravangaza for us and we thoroughly enjoyed it."},{"name":"Modelos Market Cafe","address":"501 Medford St, Ste A","city":"Somerville","stars":"4.5","text":"Ordered a cake for my boyfriends birthday a week before I needed It .

The venue was great and the staff were very helpful! There is a 40 person minimum, so we did end up paying for more, but that was ok with us. The day was perfect (but there is plenty of indoor space if it is not) and the captain was accommodating with our request to have the Boston skyline as the backdrop for our ceremony. \\n\\nMy husband and I do not drink, so in addition to the traditional bar and beverages, they brought in diet Dr. Pepper and diet Mt. Dew, which made us very happy. \\n\\nThe boat is small, as others pointed out, but was great for our group. I cannot imagine over 100 people on board, but I guess it happens sometimes. The benefit to the small boat, especially for a ceremony, is that you have more control over the the course and, since it has GPS, and you are the only client, you can have your ceremony on-board and end up with a GPS location as your wedding location.  On the Spirit and Odyssey, you are sharing with others and cannot do this.\\n\\nThe bathrooms are small, so don't expect to do anything more than relieving yourself there (no changing into a dress, really), but we did not have a problem with that. \\n\\nOur DJ was not my favorite person, but it was just a personal preference. I wanted control of the music and he said that guests would expect certain songs to be played. Even though I assured him that my guests were not fans of dance music and preferred oldies and alternative, he mostly played what he liked. When these songs came on, everyone just looked at each other and laughed. \\n\\nAlso, since our ceremony was brief and small, we did not rent chairs. Instead, we turned some of the deck couches for those who needed to sit, and the remainder of our guests stood for the fifteen minutes or so. This save a lot of money. \\n\\nThe food was great! We had filet mignon, something chicken (I never pay attention to chicken when filet is around), and a vegetable lasagna. What was most impressive is that all the food came out hot, at the same time, and cooked properly.

As it was 9:30 we were cool with that and just ready to get the feast started.  We decided to order everything on the menu (not kidding) and with 3 people that was just perfect for sharing.  Some dishes stood out more than others but to be honest they were all amazing and paired with some beautiful French red wine it was like a dream.\\n\\nAs we plowed through course after course I became more aware of all of the subtle flavors and details built into the dishes.  We definitely had something to say about each dish and luckily for all of us we liked different ones with each course.  While some have compared this to Barley Swine I have to say that I think Lenoir is better and more accessible to most people food wise.  \\n\\nAt the end of the meal the desserts came out and I was just about ready to pop.

Once I got the store I let the employees know I had repeatedly tried to call with no luck, and he just sort of shrugged at me. At this point I am scrambling so that I can get out lunches on time back to the office. I put in our order only to find out that they are out of all of the sides that we ordered for our candidates-which it was around 11am so it's surprising that the restaurant wasn't prepped for lunch that day. Also, had I been able to make a phone order, I would have been aware of the items that had been 86ed that day, and had my candidates make another decision. Instead I had to guess at the menu items they did have and hope it worked out for the best. Finally, I get a call to grab a smoothie last minute- and employees were too busy gossiping to give me the time of day until who I think was the manager got their attention. I was mostly likely noticeably fuming at this point. And the whole time no one said sorry!

For anyone that is stuck in the middle table, you have to be thin thin thin and feel comfortable sticking your crouch or butt in the food/table/face of the patrons next to you.  Additionally, the servers don't pull the table out all the way for anyone to get in, so it really makes it hard.  After you finally make it to the booth, you are only about 1 foot away from the diners to your left and right.

Mary Mac's Tea Room hits the spot for those craving real down home southern style cooking.  \\n\\nWe had an excellent server to guide us through our first Mary Mac dining experience. I can't remember his name, but our server was very personable. He talked with us like we were all from the same family. He made feel at home like we were sitting down for a Sunday dinner.  He instructed us on how to write out our food orders on a meal ticket. Cool!  Each person had to check their own drink, meal, sides, and dessert orders. \\n\\nTo keep it authentic we had to have the sweet tea as our drink choice. Our meal began with complimentary pot likar (collard greens juice) and a bottomless basket of yeast dinner rolls, corn muffins, and cinnamon rolls. The yeast rolls were the bomb! We ordered Fried Green Tomatoes and Mud Bugs (fried craw dads) as our appetizers. Dang they were good! The sauce with each dish was right on the money. Four of us decided on the shared meal deal that included Fried Chicken, Roast Pork with Dressing, and Meatloaf. The server replenished each dish whenever they seemed to get low - it was an all-you-can-eat treat. My sister is still raving about the meatloaf! The Fried Chicken was hot out of the fryer and oh so crispy.  For my tastes, the chicken could have used a bit more salt. We ended the meal with peach cobller topped with vanilla ice cream.

I can't speak much about the table service as I've usually just come for buffet and takeout.

There's definitely not one time I've left this place not feeling stuffed, that's for sure.\\n\\nOne thing that really puzzles me though about this place is the fact that the washrooms are only accessible up a flight of stairs (no elevator, no ramp, no lift).

I was in the mood for a place that gave me chill indie and creative vibes, but also good food... Folk Art was it! First off, getting there was rather easy, and parking could not have been better during my visit. The restaurant has complimentary valet parking- it is beside the restaurant (parking lot). The valet person will will park your car and give you a validated ticket. Parking here was a breeze for me, which is usually unheard of in Atlanta. When I arrived at the restaurant, there was a little bit of a wait; the estimated time was about 20 mins. I expected that since it was Saturday during brunch time and I was in the Inman Park area. My friend and I only ended up waiting for about 12-15 mins which was a plus, so I was pleased yet again. The restaurant had a few chairs out in the front (the area is shaded) where me and a few others waited. When I entered the restaurant, it was packed, only because this restaurant is on the smaller side. By no means was it cramped, it was just a small place, and everyone was not on top of each other; everyone had enough room to move around and enjoy their meals. The inside decor was pretty cool and our server was very nice! I order the Foul Play, Which is fried chicken and a sweet potato waffle with a peach compote. After looking at their menu, their pancakes and waffles are made of sweet potato. To my order, I added scrambled eggs, cheese corn grits, and hash browns. It was pretty tasty. I have never had a sweet potato waffle before, or actual corn kernels in my grits. The grits were delicious!!! The fried chicken breast could've used a little bit more seasonings and spice, but it did everything I needed it to do. The only thing that I wish this restaurant had were bottomless mimosas. Mimosas were on the menu, but if you pay for 2 mimosas here, you would be paying the same amount for bottomless mimosas at other places. Nonetheless I had a great experience here.

Service and attentiveness was lacking every time when I visited for both lunch and dinner. It was brought to my attention that they had a pasta promotion so we took the risk and tried again. I'm pretty sure that was my last visit and I will avoid eating there again. \\n \\nService and attentiveness - There seemed to be an unfortunate \\"nothing is my business\\" mentality between the servers. Upon arrival, waiting at the \\"please wait to be seated\\" sign, multiple servers saw me standing there but it was not until I waved at a server that someone appointed another server to have me seated. I was ready to order and notified a server and I was told that she would get my server; I waited 10 minutes and had to flag down a server and when he came up to our table, there was no helpfulness and he made me feel as if I was inconveniencing him. Our dishes were practically tossed and dropped at our table. My spoon was caught under a plate and almost went flying off the table when a dish was dropped off, the server noticed it and apologized but he was already walking away almost completely turned around. The rest of the dishes came but the server would just drop them off at the edge of the table closest to them. When we were ready for the bill, I had to ask twice again. The first server I approached for the bill came back into our area serving another table but no bill for us, and then I had to flag down another server for our bill. It shouldn't be this difficult for standard basic service at a restaurant. \\n \\nHonoring a promotion - I fully understand that there will always be a catch when ordering from the special promotional menu. There was a 2 for 1 pasta promotion; order 2 pasta dishes and pay for 1. The pasta dishes were unusually small but we understand that it was a promotion so we accepted it. At one point we considered ordering more because the pasta dishes were very small; however, the service was such a turn off that we opted out. The experience was not great but somewhat expected. It wasn't until the next day when we saw the ad again and noticed that along with the pasta, garlic bread, salad and appetizers were included.  Salad and appetizers never came. \\n \\nIf the servers don't enjoy serving, get a different job. When customers order from the special menu and can't get the same treatment as customers ordering from the regular menu, don't offer a special menu. If not all inclusions form the promotional ad is honored/served, don't advertise a promotional menu. I recognize that Kyung Bok Palace is not fine dining but standard basic service in a restaurant setting is not too much to expect. \\n\\nMaybe it was just my bad luck and hope you all a better experience."},{"name":"The Backspace","address":"507 San Jacinto St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Wonderful margarita pizza and an excellent roasted corn and cippolini onion appetizer.

And after having worked in the foodservice/bartending industry for 7 years now, that should say a lot.  :-) \\nThe only bit of constructive criticism I have...and it's not even criticism really...is that if you are in a bit of a rush, don't sit down to eat in the cafe.  The food took a minute to get to the table, but I also need to factor in the fact that it was crowded, our AMAZING server had somewhere around 7 tables (all of which she took great care!), and it's not the kind of \\"dine and go\\" atmosphere either.

Service and attentiveness was always lacking when I visited for both lunch and dinner. It was brought to my attention that they had a pasta promotion so we took the risk and tried again. I'm pretty sure that was my last visit and will avoid eating there again. \\n\\nService and attentiveness - There seemed to be a \\"nothing is my business\\" mentality between the servers. Upon arrival, waiting at the \\"please wait to be seated\\" sign, multiple servers saw me standing there but it was not until I waved that someone appointed another server to have me seated. I was ready to order and notified someone and she said she would get my server; I waited 10 minutes and had to flag down someone and when he came up to our table, there was no helpfulness and instead I truly felt that I was inconveniencing him. Our dishes were practically tossed and dropped at our table. My spoon was caught under a plate and almost went flying when a dish was dropped off, the server noticed it and apologized but he was already walking away almost completely turned around. The rest of the dishes came but the server would just drop them off at the edge of the table closest to him. When we were ready for the bill, I had to ask twice again. The first server I approached for the bill came back into our area serving another table and no bill for us, and then I had to flag down another server for our bill. It shouldn't be this difficult for standard basic service at a restaurant. \\n\\nHonoring a promotion - I fully understand that there will always be a catch when ordering from the special promotional menu. There was a 2 for 1 pasta promotion; order 2 pasta dishes and pay for 1. The pasta dishes were unusually small but we understand that it was a promotion so we accepted it. At one point we considered ordering more because the pasta dishes were very small; however, it was such a turn off that it was going to require so much effort to get the servers' attention for anything so opted out. The experience was not great but somewhat expected. It wasn't until the next day when we saw the ad again and noticed that along with the pasta, garlic bread, salad and appetizers were included.  Salad and appetizers never came. \\n\\nIf the servers don't enjoy serving, get a different job. When customers order from the special menu and can't get the same treatment as customers ordering from the regular menu, don't offer a special menu. If not all inclusions form the promotional ad is honored/served, don't advertise a promotional menu. I recognize that Kyung Bok Palace is not fine dining but standard basic service in a restaurant setting is not too much to expect. \\n\\nMaybe it was just my bad luck and hope you all a better experience."},{"name":"Bison County BBQ Bar & Grille","address":"275 Moody St","city":"Waltham","stars":"3.5","text":"First time here.

Their margherita pizza has a white base and so in order to make it half/half they have to add tomato sauce to the whole pizza. I love it this way because I looove their tomato sauce.

I love that it's flavorful as all hell without dripping in oil.\\n\\nI do have to say that ordering a fresh whole pizza versus ordering a reheated slice makes a huge difference. Both are good but the freshly baked whole pizza is above and beyond. The only place, in Austin, I like better than this is backspace but I reserve that for a fancier night.

So when I went to pick it up I told them the name it was under and no \\"hi\\" or \\"let me grab that for you\\" or even \\"you total is blank\\"- she just said \\"just so you know, we don't do steak in the middle of the day, especially on a Friday. We are really busy\\" (no they weren't and it was a later lunch anyway).  So I just said ok and gave her my card. We had ordered food that needed ketchup with it and we knew we needed extra so when she handed me the food I asked if she could put some extra in the bag to which she answered in a very snappy and extremely rude tone \\"there is already plenty in there ok thanks bye\\" all in one condescending breath. So i turned and walked out thinking \\"wow, she could not have been more rude if she tried\\". When we opened our food it was no surprise to find not enough ketchup. Now, I know this seems like a small thing, but when you have had a long work week and have just been talked down to, it is a big deal. So i walked back to Full Moon and went up to her (while she was on the phone) and told her that she had been mistaken and there wasn't enough ketchup and she handed me 4 tiny packets. Great, thanks.

Plus we both had drinks, me the Red-headed stranger and her the Ranch House lemonade.\\n\\nFirst off we did come here during the afternoon so it was a bit calmer but still doing brisk business.  And service was to be expected, waiter was attentive.\\n\\nFirst off drinks came out fairly quickly. My g/f loved the Ranch House lemonade as did I but my drink which is a play on a bloodymary was terrible. I am not sure if it was the bacon infused vodka they used or the mix but it had absolutely no taste at all. It tasted like they added vodka, water, and a can of tomato juice and mixed it all together. \\n\\nOkay, hopefully the food will make up for the drinks.\\n\\nWhen the food finally came out, it was both the appetizer and main course, not a prob., it wasn't like it was a long wait so that was acceptable to me.\\n\\nUpon looking at the food it looked great, hopefully it will taste that way also. Nope. First off the waffle cheese fries were over cooked, the cheese was basically baked into the fries and there was just a small dollop of sour cream in the middle with giant balls of greasy bacon bits. \\n\\nMe and my g/f fought the basket to give us our food and basically had fragments of waffle fries with hard cheese on them and a thin layer of sour cream.\\n\\nFine. Maybe the hot dog will redeem part of this meal.\\n\\nNope.  I've deep fried many a dog in my day and the hotdog looked like it had been left in the fryer too long. On top of this the buns they used were very tough and chewy. Not what I was expecting. Both my g/f's and mine fell apart half way thru eating it. \\n\\nOn a side note, if you are having the sonoran ask to remove the pinto beans, they will overpower the hot dog. All you will taste is the flavor and consistency of the pinto beans. My g/f did enjoy hers a bit more but agreed she was not prepared to have the dog fall apart or the chewiness of the bun.\\n\\nTypically I do return food on occasion but not this time. We were in the area and decided to drop in but were not prepared to stay for too long. Any other time I would have filled out a card about the meal but did not see anything on the table or front desk.\\n\\nAll in all, I may come back here late at night and see if the food is any better but not likely anytime soon.

What  Fabulous doughnuts!  What's the big deal about a doughnut place that offers zany flavors? I must say, I am not a big fan of 'Scooby food'.  You know, bizarre food combinations like chocolate on your pizza etc...) probably the edge that this place has is that they do your basic stuff really, really well.  The honey dipped crueller is fantastic! nice, light and eggy on the inside.  The honey bar, incredible!  substantial cakey interior and nice ample glaze.  From the basics, Voodoo ups the ante and does get creative.  The much touted maple bar with bacon, yes, it does sound weird but it is fantastatic.  The sweet maple glaze is tempered by the salty crispy bacon topped off with a yeast raised donut which has an ever slight crispness with a nice fluffy interior.  Do I sound like I a voodoo donut evangelist yet?  It is a 24 hour establishment  which is very convenient to mortals and vampires alike.  It also means that they may run out of items so have plenty of back up requests ready just in case.  The place is beyond tiny so don't expect to sit inside to enjoy your prize. Prices are reasonable and are well worth every cent.  Yes, I came here twice in less than 24 hours and ate 5 donuts which have undoubtedly taken a few years off my lifespan....so worth it!"},{"name":"Miller's Ale House - Kirkman Rd","address":"5573 S Kirkman Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"3","text":"This ale house knows how to make prime rib!

With a recommendation like that- and limited time in town- it seemed to be our best bet. \\n\\nSince it was brunch time, we started with Bloody Marys- which were outstanding- just enough spice and perfectly balanced. Our waiter was extremely helpful in guiding us through the menu, so after discussing our tastes he recommended we try the grilled octopus  (crispy potato salad, chorizo, herbs, creme fraiche) and the head on ga white shrimp a la plancha, (\\"sopping\\" toast, arbol chile, lime ), and the east coast oysters (fresh horseradish and mignonette). The octopus was very good and was an interesting play with the texture of the petite crispy chips and creamy creme fraiche. The oysters were fresh and tasted as oysters should. But wow-sweet Lord- the shrimp- That was an experience all on its own. I would honestly say that dish alone was the greatest thing I have tasted in at least 3 years. It was perfectly done and went so well with the deliciously made in-house crackers they had on the table (which btw they should sell in stores because we would eat them everyday they are so delicious!) \\n\\nOkay so all of that sounds great right? So, we decided to order more food as we were settling in. The next round began with a lobster cobb salad (dijon mustard dressing), 2 cups of seafood gumbo w/ potluck bread and rice, and another round of Bloody Marys. Okay-now I'm not sure what happened from our first set of dishes to the second- but honestly and quite surprisingly it wasn't even in the same realm as the first. The lobster cobb- even though the lobster was cooked perfectly- the butter lettuce was sopping wet from the amount of dijon- so much that no other flavors could be tasted. We actually just picked out the lobster and left both salads on the plates. The gumbo was attractively presented with individually wrapped bread servings, but the gumbo itself was lifeless and felt like the roux had been rushed therefore lacked any real depth of flavor. And finally, and most sadly- the second rounds of Bloody Marys had clearly been made by someone with less care and attention as the firsts, as they tasted bitter and overly spiced. One came with an olive and one didn't, and the lime wedges were both dried out. I know that can sound sounds overly picky- but as we discussed during the meal- the change in quality while dining, etc flavors would have been the difference between a Michelin star (or two) and nothing. We were poised for a shoo-in and left feeling slightly disappointed. Probably best they don't offer that rating system here. \\n\\nAnyway- overall it was a positive experience- simply because I was able to taste their shrimp dish. I really think my life might actually be better as a result of those flavors! The dining room, bar, and exterior seating area were beautifully designed, and the wait staff could not have been more pleasant. But the turn in taste half way through almost guaranteed we won't be dining again the next time we are in town."},{"name":"Lenoir","address":"1807 S 1st St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I'll admit that after having such a yuck experience recently at a different one of Austin's fine dining places I went to Lenoir last night with my expectations lower than normal.\\nFriends had been raving about this place for weeks and I have to tell you they were right!\\nIt's a prix fixe menu for those that don't know.  38 bucks and you get to choose 3 different dishes from 4 categories.  My girlfriend and I decided (on the advice of a friend) we would do 6 dishes from the land, sea, field and then cough up the extra 10 bucks and share a dessert off the 'dream' section.\\nWe ordered the beet salad and the artichoke dish from the field.  They were amazing!  The beets were perfectly roasted and the curry aioli it came with was yum.  The artichoke dish had a duck egg sabayon with hint of mustard and smoked mushrooms.  Next we had the black drum ceviche and the poached cobia.  The fish was perfectly cooked and the ceviche was served on homemade pappadam that  was really good!\\nWe then moved on to the land course...a roasted guinea hen and a crispy goat.  The crispy goat was excellent...salty and crispy and caramelized!  The hen was good but a very small portion.\\nWe shared a strawberry pie with homemade ice cream on top that was one of the best desserts I have ever had.\\nSo the only constructive feedback I have is the wine list is pretty pricey.  There was nothing less than 45 bucks a bottle and I really think that nowadays that's silly.  In addition, the flavor profile in every dish was kinda the same and I would like to see a different element used once in a while...more spices, more chili's etc\\nAll in all Lenoir has a huge yummy factor.

Here's what's so awesome.\\n\\n1. The service is top-notch. The servers, hosts/hostesses are all professional, thorough, and really effective. There is absolutely nothing to complain about on this front.\\n\\n2. The food is very, very good. Really, it's good. No, I mean it - it's good. This is a seafood place, and what they do with a piece of fish is remarkable. As an appetizer I had fried oysters, which were outstanding. Not overcooked, well fried, HUGE, and with a smoky mayo that was just wonderful. This appetizer comes with house pickles, which went perfectly with the meal. As a main course, I had halibut with garlic cream and celery. This was truly wonderful. The fish was cooked so perfectly, I'm still thinking about it days later. I also had dessert, against my beter judgment. I went with the beignets, which were so freaking good I ate the whole thing. Here lies the only problem - I wanted to shoot myself after. I ate way too much. But, I'd do it all over again.\\n\\n3. When you arrive, there's complimentary valet (which is oddly much further away from the entrance than it needs to be). As you walk in, the place is just beautiful. It's got a great, spacious layout, with a killer raw bar area, a huge dining room, a nice bar in the center of the fining room, good lighting and a comfortable feel.\\n\\nIt's expensive, but it's worth it.

Once an hour passed, we were being seated by the manager.  At this time, I asked, \\"how will service be once we are seated\\"?  He replied \\"our service is always the best\\".  This was a slap in the face/bold statement as he was well aware that they were running an hour behind on reservations.  Once seated, our waiter brought us two appetizers on the house (perhaps the manager came to his senses).  The food was good.  The hush puppies with pimento cheese were a top notch appetizer.

While the fare is somewhat different than the spicy chicken and potatoes I remembered having all the time in Peru, it is delicious.  The chicken is more savory than spicy and is served with a delicious spicy, garlicky green sauce that I would just assume dip my finger into and lick off a la Fun Dip.  The yuca and plantains are delicious and they have plenty of typical chicken sides like mac n cheese and cole slaw for the less adventuruous.  Oddly enough I don't recall seeing potatoes (a Peruvian staple), but it's possible I just overlooked them in my excitement of seeing of plantains and yuca.  And of course they have Inka Cola in a can which looks like Mountain Dew in color but tastes a lot like Big Red (say what?!).  It was an independent Peruvian soft drink back in the '80s but has since been acquired by Coca Cola.  Regardless, one sip and I was immediately taken back to my days of running around the Mira Flores district with my parents in my grey slacks and grey sweater worn by all private school students in Lima.  The only reason I didn't go five stars (I wanted to go 4,1/2), is I've had to wait an abnormally long time for the yuca and/or plantains to be served after the rest of the meal was served if they weren't ready in sufficient quantity at the time of my order.  I think the price point is about right, but maybe just a hair on the high side given their suburban location.  Unless they struck a bad deal on their lease, I would expect to get out of there for a few bucks less than I usually do.  Their location also concerns me because I wonder if the demand for their grub wouldn't be greater in the city where more adventurous palates tend to dwell.  I think anybody would love the place if they tried it, but I would be willing to bet 90% of today's suburbanites don't know what Inka means and may not be lured in as a result.  Don't let these mild criticisms keep you away.  I just feel that in order to provide a fair and accurate review, I have to cover all aspects--negative and positive-- about a place or I'm doing everyoen involved a disservice.

Tasty and light (calamari, seafood egg rolls, and lobster wontons). 30mins later 3 out of 4 meals arrive. Come on man, did you really bring out 3 of 4 meals? Yeah he did. To add insult to injury, Chris even tries to not make eye contact when he goes back to the kitchen and brings out 2 other meals to another table.\\n\\nNow fast fwd cause i'm running out readable space (i hate long reviews). The last meal finally comes out and all 4 have issues. Chilean Sea Bass (isn't even chilean its from some other 3rd world country according to Chris) came with half a scoop of potatoes and was floating in some type of soup like sauce. Crispy beef looked as if it was fried rice with beef and broccoli from the carry out. Seafood Melange was a medley of overcooked pasta and no seafood (so bad we sent it back and the manager came over to play find the seafood in the bowl cause he couldn't take our word for it when I said \\"Unimpressed.\\" Finally you have the Duck Dynasty which came out late with warm mashed potatoes and cold vegetable medley. \\n\\nNot sure if thats how it was supposed to come out but it definitely didn't look like the plate the person at the table next to us had.

So we called ahead to Mueller's, which is a few blocks from our house and we had never tried it.  Since we called on Tuesday, when they're closed, I had to leave a VM and the call was returned the next morning at 10:00 by a very friendly and professional young lady named Ally.\\n\\nWe ordered just a pound of brisket and picked it up around noon.  The line wasn't overwhelming, but I didn't have to wait, since they have a pickup window.  There are many long communal tables and plenty of parking space (which surely pleases the cranky folks in the Bouldin Creek 'hood surrounding).  It would be fun to eat there, since everyone seemed to be having a great time - a nice mixture of business people on their lunch hour, retirees like us, and Austin slackers.\\n\\nSo we took the brisket home, along with a side of potato salad, and it was great.  The \\"crust\\" was fantastic as was the sauce, which I normally don't eat, but my husband does.  I tried it and loved the flavor and that it wasn't thick like ketchup.

Spicy tuna was good, but a little different than I'm used to since it was full of crunchy bits. The eel was to be expected, and tasted fine. The veggies were good, but a little bit more oil and sauce than I really like. The only real downside was the fried rice and the salad. Salad was almost inedible for me. Very watery dressing and basically gross. Fried rice was tasteless and very bland. The steak was great, incredibly tender and delicious. The shrimp and chicken were very good as well.

After a few bites of my first cupcake, I needed really, really bitter coffee to balance the over sweetness. I had already purchased more cupcakes and kind of regretted it. The frosting also tasted a little old, maybe was stiff instead of creamy. I don't think these things are difficult to change, and I hope the owners will take this as constructive criticism. The cupcakes are uniquely pretty and very big in size. I haven't seen such cupcakes even in NY, so with a few changes, like less sugar, this can be a winner.

I know it's early, but they haven't quite done anything right here. Maybe the problem is that Ten Tables delivers on all fronts, but me and my girl left here EXTREMELY disappointed. I don't think we'll go back. \\n\\nSpecific points:\\n\\n1) Upon arrival, it's unclear how the whole ordering process works. There are many people behind the counter standing and doing nothing, so we figured they took orders once you got a seat. Nope, you order and pay up front, then try and find a seat. \\n\\n2) The seating is extremely limited, and the seats themselves a bit wobbly. \\n\\n3) They didn't even ask me how I wanted my burger cooked. I'm a medium-rare kind of guy, but the burger came out practically mooing (I know it's supposed to be fresh, but please). My mom would have died. She won't touch it if it doesn't taste like a charcoal briquet. At least ask how I want it cooked or make them all medium or medium-well. I think that's safest. \\n\\n4) I ordered beers for both of us, then sat down and waited. Apparently you then have to actually ASK for the beers in order to get them. (see aforementioned note of many people standing doing nothing behind the bar.)\\n\\n5) The cost is nearly prohibitive. For 8-12 bucks for a lone burger, do you really have to charge another quarter for mayo? The burger is small, although I guess I take a sliver of comfort in knowing the cow had a wonderful life before meeting its demise. And $4 extra for fries? Were the potatoes grown hydroponically with triple filtered water made from the tears of virgins?\\n\\n6) They forgot the bacon on the turkey club my girl ordered. MAJOR faux pas. \\n\\n7) For a place that's all about treating the environment well, why am I drinking water from a teeny plastic cup they stole from my dentist's office and eating with plastic forks and knives?\\n\\nAll in all, spending more than 50 bucks for two beers, a raw slider-sized burger, a turkey club (without the best part -- the bacon) and two orders of fries should come with either better food, more of it or a better experience. Otherwise drop the prices."},{"name":"The Eisenhower Bagelhouse","address":"3990 N Interstate Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"Eisenhower Bagelhouse is my favorite place to get a bagel sandwich.

It's a pasty kind of salsa (my favourite kind) and usually has some kick to it.  Presumably they make it themselves.\\n\\nThe only negative thing I have to say about Elsi's is that the atmosphere is pretty dull, and can be annoying when the projector is on, playing sports, but luckily it's usually off.

Located in Cumberland Mall, F2O offers fresh, healthy food in a more typical restaurant setting than what you will find in the food court.  I visited this location on a Sunday for lunch.  I enjoyed my food, but a few issues kept this location from getting my full seal of approval.\\n\\nMy girlfriend and I entered the restaurant and were impressed with the cleanliness of Fresh To Order.  The main dining room is open to the mall through large doors but closed off by glass on the side, so it is separated enough to feel comfortable and distinct.  The tables, chairs and walls are dark-toned wood that feels comfortable and warm.\\n\\nVisitors form a line, order their food, and are given a number.  On the day we went, the restaurant was busy and we decided to sit outside at the tables in the mall.  There wasn't enough staff working because several tables (both inside and out) were covered in dirty dishes.  There weren't enough people to bus the tables, and the whole dining room suffered.\\n\\nThis was a problem because the leftovers were attracting lots of flies.  It made those of us who were trying to eat feel unsanitary.  Simply cleaning the tables would have largely remedied the issue.  I'm not saying the staff was lazy - there just weren't enough of them.\\n\\nOur food was fresh and tasty.  However, it took an extremely long time for the food to arrive, and it was cold.  This is another symptom of a staffing problem, because our food was ready for a while before they brought it to us.  \\n\\nI would give F2O another chance, but they need to make sure they have adequate personnel to keep everything clean and running smoothly.

With 10% ABV, this is good times guaranteed. This had a nice flavor and aftertaste, with a low IBU ( roughly means low bitterness). I also tried the 'Adam', which was another 10% ABV beer with notes of chocolate and smoke. I cannot remember visiting a place which could out-match these beers in quality. Standard bar food aside, they also had a cheese tasting platter that looked interesting.\\n2) This place was super crowded even at 16:30 on a weekend! Which is both good and bad. Good as it signals the quality and popularity of the place, bad because the servers are over stretched.

This place is absolutely fantastic and if I could afford it, I would come here every week, but until that day comes, this will just have to remain as a treat that I have every once and a while. \\n\\nFirst off, our server Kyle was very friendly, knowledgable, fast, and did not miss a beat. Well done sir. The food was some of the best that I have had in Portland so far. We started out with appetizers. Striped marlin cebiche, empanadas, and palta rellena de cangrejo (or avocado stuffed with crab and topped with a prawn). The cebiche was delicious, with the freshest I have had since moving back from the big island. The empanadas were out of this world good. Crispy, flaky and not at all greasy and even though I generally don't like raisins with my meat, the filling for these was an exception. As far as the avocado stuffed with crab goes, it is something I wish I could eat every day. Someday, someday. \\n\\nFor our main course I had Arroz Con Pato, seared duck breast and duck confit with cilantro infused rice and a passion fruit sauce. The duck confit was crispy and fall off the bone tender and by far the best duck I have had, while the duck breast was cooked perfectly (rare, the way meat should be) and was very good as well. I really enjoyed the passion fruit sauce and even the rice was great. It certainly was not just any old rice. Why can't all rice be so flavorful? \\n\\nI can't remember what my girlfriend or her family had since I was so entranced by my dinner, aside from one of them having a scallop dish, and my girlfriend having a steak which she let me try, that I seriously contemplated stealing from her. We all enjoyed our meal immensely and were sadly a little too full for desert. Maybe next time. \\n\\nAndina was a great dining experience and they have an extensive menu so it could take a while to make it through the whole list. The tapas are great, as are the main dishes, but if I were to go back I would be more likely to just order the tapas because they have such a great variety to choose from, and so far have yet to have anything I did not like.

I've been in Atlanta since 1948, and My Aunt Jean was married to a man whose aunts were Margaret Mitchell's close friends. My pablum was grits, my beverages of my youth were sweet tea and Coca-Cola, and I have eaten many a tomato and mayonnaise sandwich on Merita bread. Mary Mac's is in my mind and soul, together with Mammy's Shanty, Leb's, the Magnolia Room at Rich's, Herren's, Fan and Bill's, and Trader Eng's. Only Mary Mac's is still here. Now, I am a pork chop eatin' fool, given the chance, but at MM's I always go for the fried shrimp and oysters platter, with blackeyed peas and collards. I have spent more money in places in Florida, Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana seeking the thrill of the crunch and the savor of the sweetness of fresh shrimp and oysters fried to the peak of doneness and no more. Only Mary Mac's have pulled this off for me EVERY time I tuck napkin under chin and grab a fork. There are no more accommodating staff anywhere, who always laugh when I ask to be seated in the Atlanta Room with a window seat \\"overlooking the river\\". If I'm real lucky, I get blessed with a soothing shoulder massage from a sweet grannie lady before the vittles come. Make fun of the South if you must, but Mary Mac's is a tradition that transcends regions. P.S: What is this \\"too touristy\\" business? Lunch during the week will likely find you seated next to Braves, Falcons, and Hawks players, as well as Dr. Lowery, or Guv Sonny, or Elton John, not a gang of Bermuda shorted camera snappers. There's a word for Mary Mac's- OK, three words: down home and genteel.

I had mighty high expectations upon entering this cool, industrial chic location, which reminded me a lot of hip hot spots in NYC.  We were seated indoors, but within reach of the outdoor patio.  The setup is large and offers a nice view of, well, not much.  It's sort of in a secluded lot with not much of any view save the Bocce ball court hanging to the left of the patio.  Either way, this place is great for groups, not so much for an intimate dinner-date.\\n\\nThat said, the food is pretty decent, though some dishes shine while others are left lacking some refinement.  A definite MUST is the salmon chips which were crispy and delicate, full of fresh salmon and a great, refreshing start to the meal.  It was probably my favorite bite of the night.  I went with a chicken entree, and the serving size is embarrassingly large.  It proved nearly impossible to finish.  Though the portion was large, the chicken was just a tad dry, though I didn't really mind because the flavors were enjoyable, but the bf ordered the same dish, and all he kept remarking on was the dryness of the chicken.  The only side this entree came with, was a bowl of sadly mediocre mac-n-cheese.\\n\\nPrices are slightly high, with entrees in the twenty-thirty double digits, as well, cocktails and drinks are kind of pricey too, yet nothing during that dinner truly stood out as revolutionary (except the salmon chips, of course).\\n\\n3.5 Stars."},{"name":"Elsi's Restaurant","address":"6601 Burnet Rd, Ste 300","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"The food is nothing special.

Oh sorry, didn't mean to scream, but hey this needs a shout out. Since 1826 this treasure has only had three owners. A favorite place for the Kennedy's to dine and JFK's favorite booth has been dedicated to him in his memory. \\n\\nLets talk about the food and layout. You walk into the Oyster Bar, where they are serving drinks and shucking oysters, right then and there! It is awesome to watch how quickly they can do it. The restaurant itself is divided into floors and rooms, that all have names. Decor is to marvel at! \\n\\nThe food, awe yes! Oyster stew is the very best! The clam chowder is very good! The hot oyster sampler is a great way to taste and share a variety of house favorites, which has grilled oysters, baked stuffed cherrystones, some of the best clams casino you will ever eat, as well as the oysters Rockefeller, plus shrimp scampi . \\n\\nDo have the clams casino and the oysters Rockefeller! The lazy man's lobster is unique and awesome, it has chunks of lobster baked in a casserole with sherry wine, bread crumbs and butter. They serve lobster just about anyway you can imagine. The lobster raviolis are wonderful! \\n\\nThe crusted haddock is so good! They have a nice variety of fresh fish and shellfish served many different ways. The fried Boston scrod makes a great sandwich or fish and chips. The lobster roll is pricey, but It is loaded with lobster. They make a great Newburg sauce, creamy and laced with sherry for those scallops and shrimp to swim in. \\n\\nI have been here many times and I would return again and again and again.\\n\\nThe Union Oyster House IS wheelchair accessible!"},{"name":"The Friendly Toast - Burlington","address":"75 Middlesex Tpke, Ste 1015B","city":"Burlington","stars":"4","text":"First  time at Burlington F.T.

The garlic rice went superbly with it. We also cleaned up this flavorful sauce with their house bread which had an herb/seed(quinoa??) that i could not identify. \\n\\nALL ABOVE were devoured with a glass of crisp chardonnay on our server's recommendation.  \\n\\nFor dessert we got the goat cheese cake/peruvian flan and the peruvian cookie.

More importantly, it's delicious. A lot of times with po'boys, all you taste is the coating and the bread. These shrimp were a great size, to start with, and the coating was really well seasoned. It wasn't over-coated, so I could taste the shrimp. The lettuce was also super fresh and not limp, as you sometimes see. The bread was also toasted (it was a little darker than I would like, but it's a minor quibble) so it had such a nice crunch. The fries were hot and fresh and I waited less than 10 minutes for my food at 1:30 on a Sunday.\\n\\nThis place is less than a mile from my house, and I will be a regular!"},{"name":"Andina Restaurant","address":"1314 NW Glisan St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Excellent food and even better service!\\n\\nWe started with their complimentary bread and a trio of sauces, all were yummy, and then we ordered a pitcher of delicious sangria and a bunch of tapas. Remember, tapas are small shared plates, so if you want more, order medium or large. This review is for all small plates. Here's my tapas breakdown...\\n\\nESP√ÅRRAGOS PERUANOS (grilled asparagus brushed with chimichurri)\\nThis dish was surprisingly delicious. We debated on if we should order a veggie dish or just stick to seafoods and meats, but we opted to get a little greens dish and this was perfection. Skinny asparagus, perfectly seasoned, and not overcooked!\\n\\nEMPANADAS DE CARNE (flaky pastry filled with slow-cooked beef, raisins and Botija olives)\\nThis dish was very yummy and two empanadas come out. It was perfectly crispy and flaky and the meat inside was very tender.\\n\\nANTICUCHO DE CORAZ√ìN (marinated beef heart kebobs, served with a spicy salsa de rocoto)\\nThis dish was one of my favorites for its simplicity but depth of flavor. Three meat skewers with two pieces of meat on each stick. One of my favorites of the night.\\n\\nPALTA RELLENA DE CANGREJO (avocado stuffed with crab, topped with a poached prawn)\\nThis was one of my least favorite dishes... I like the ingredients, but the avocado to crab and prawn ratio was off... so there was an overwhelming avocado taste if you tried to portion out your bites equally.\\n\\nCONCHAS A LA PARRILLA (grilled diver scallops with a tamari-brown sugar butter sauce and crispy onions)\\nMmmmm.... this dish was superb! Diver scallops weren't overly cooked and they were so succulent... the sauce was perfection.\\n\\nANTICUCHO DE PULPO (grilled octopus kebobs with chimichurri and a caper majado de papa)\\nThe octopus was good, but it was just like one leg... hard to share for a tapas dish, but very flavorful.\\n\\nOSTRAS (daily selection of west coast and east coast oysters, with chalaquita, r√°bano-mango and nikkei salsas)\\nWe ordered half a dozen of the east coast variety and the oysters were SUPER SALTY.

Worst restaurant experience ever, due to the rudest waitress and their policies. Went there with a Groupon that was good for several dishes and soft drinks. Arbitrarily, they cut out some of the items that you were supposed to get, without substituting others. Basically just shortchanging the customer.\\nFor example, they would not give the two soft drinks that were part of the deal. They did allow the food to be take out if a person paid a surcharge, which I did. The waitress, who seemed to have some authority, said that they would lose the recycling fee if they allowed me to take the cans of soft drinks out. I offered to pay the 5 cents per can recycling so that wouldn't lose that, but she said she wanted a lot more than that. She also said I could take the Coke out in a take out soup container if I paid $1 for that container, one they probably pay a few cents for. When I pointed out that the Groupon promised certain things the waitress said that the restaurant doesn't like Groupon, they lose money on it. Well, duh, then don't sign up for it. The waitress did not like my protests and actually snarled at me, \\"why don't you just leave\\". What incredibly rude customer service.

Our waiter was a bit of a space cadet, but a good natured one.  We ordered: a burger, medium, no bread for me and fish and chips for my companion.  A simple enough order, right?  Well, apparently not.  It took nearly an hour to deliver our food and my burger was cooked well done and was cold.  My companion's fish and chips was kind of awful -- breaded, for a start and like my food it was also cold.  We called the waiter over and told him and when he looked a bit skeptical, we invited him to try a fry.  \\"Oh, yeah, that's lukewarm at best\\" was his comment after tasting one of the fries.

They judge ppl by their appearance i guess, we were dressed casual and went in downtown with our 10 yr old and asked for window or view seats and in spite of many empty seats they gave us a seat with no view at all.. Was our first time there dont think will ever recommend or return .\\nThe whole attitude of the staff was very condescending and rude. We had been very honest and polite with them and told them that we were in the tower to see the skywalk which apparently is owned by same owner and they closed the skywalk without appropriate  notice for the whole day. So we went to this restaurant dressed in casual and informed the hostess honestly. We also told them we would be eating and drinking a little (since we were not driving). She took one look at us and gave us a  corner seat inspite of repeated requests  to give us a seat with a view and when asked why were told that that it was for ppl who drink cocktails. She probably just assumed that we could not afford a cocktail. My family was really upset with the whole rude attitude.\\nNote to the owner: A lot of skyscrapers are cropping up in Boston and pretty soon you will realize that you are no longer exclusive. That many would have their own skywalks and top of the hub type of places. I don't want to play the Race card (We are originally from India) but judgemental customer service and nonpolite nature definitely comes to mind and i cant wait for a new skywalk and new high rise restaurant to open so I can spend my hard earned money at a place that knows how to treat decent ,honest and polite customers.\\n\\nI have always reviewed places who need a good review even if some of their things bothered me.

We had no issue waiting, but the line moved slowly - and the inside of the restaurant is fairly narrow (especially the back half). Every time someone from the restaurant staff had to go out into the restaurant or get back to the kitchen (or a bathroom, or a different storage/cleaning room), half the line had to shift and squeeze together in order to allow them through. Not the fault of the staff, obviously, but the setup of the restaurant is just...squished. Add to that the fact that some of the tables for diners are in the back portion of the restaurant and, if you're sitting at those tables, you need to break through the line of those waiting to be served in order to go to/from your table. \\n\\nThis bring me to the other issue: the cafeteria-esque style service. It's fine, though it feels super inefficient at times. You're also prone to seeing people come into the restaurant and try to sit at an empty table - only to get corrected by one of the staff members bussing tables. People don't seem to pay attention to the line or \\"how things work\\"...so it seems to get a bit messy. A couple girls came into the restaurant and grabbed a table after my friend and I showed up (and while we were still waiting near the end of the line). They promptly got snapped at by one of the staff, then grumpily got up, walked to the back of the line, and started loudly complaining. Made the experience a bit more tiresome for the rest of us already waiting. \\n\\nFinally, the food is good, but nothing crazy-special. I had the \\"Fresh Banana & Caramel French Toast,\\" which was fine. A couple of the banana slices on my plate looked a wee bit brown, but still edible. Still...didn't leave the best impression in my mind. The bacon I ordered as a side was also way crispier than I typically like - almost starting to burn.\\n\\nAll-in-all, not the kind of place I'd probably visit again - unless it was during a down time.

While there was a good sized crowd there, it was nowhere near crazy, so I ended up having an okay time. \\n\\nThe selection here is so big it borders on overwhelming. I wanted to try every flavor, but unfortunately my stomach is small and prone to upset, so I stuck to two. I got their grape offering as well as their voodoo jelly donut, shaped like a cute little voodoo doll. The grape was very tasty; it was sweet but not overly so, and also large enough to be quite filling. I only got through half of the jelly donut. The dough was fine but the jelly was way too sweet. Also this donut bordered on too large and was difficult to eat. That being said, I was pleasantly surprised that such a tourist attraction had decent donuts, and when in Portland I intend on returning to try more of their huge selection.

What a treat we got by walking down from the Fox Theatre and picking this out of all the choices.

It was so nice out we sat outside and ordered some mimosas. It was right at noon , we didn't want to fill up too much so we started with the deviled eggs and fried goat cheese appetizers. Wow. The deviled eggs were actually flash fried with a little flour, then filled with kimchi, mango, egg, Korean beef and topped with caviar. This was a powerful burst of flavor. It all merged so well and was the best take on a deviled egg Ive ever had. \\n\\nThe fried goat cheese was cheese- wrapped in spiced mashed taters, deep fried and served over fried green tomato and topped with a mustard sauce and some berry jam. Again, just a burst of flavor, great goat cheese, crispy tomato and outer skin on the fried cheese made this perfect. We are all enjoying these so much we couldn't wait to start on lunch. \\n\\nI got the fried lobster fried rice. This is a 6 oz ( guessing)  lobster, battered and fried perfectly, over a plate of fried rice with these mini sweetie drop Peruvian peppers. The lobster was flavorful, not greasy and a good piece of it thinking it may have been more than 6 oz so guessing here. Full plate of food and well prepared and presented. \\n\\nMy daughter got the chicken and waffles to get her sweet and salty vibe. This was crispy fried chicken with an asian sauce dribbled over it, served with sweet potato waffles- dense, tasty, perfect. This as a very filling meal with plenty of good southern fried chicken and 2 triangles of a waffle that were a meal by themselves. \\n\\nMy son in law got the korean beef and kale with veggies.  A good portion of flavorful korean beef, crispy kale over zucchini, peppers, onions with a side of white rice. Excellent dish that again had all the flavors that just kept on giving and was very filling. We weren't able to eat all of our entrees, but we certainly tried. \\n\\nThis is everything most reviews say. Great asian fusion but has a southern flare, great fried chicken and creativity out the roof!!

Our server was fine, though for a pricey restaurant like TotH, I would expect my server to be a little more professional/exceptional. We shared the bacon wrapped scallops and they were delicious. The squash that accompanied the dish could have used some seasoning (salt please!) .The boy had the lamb shank and I had the cioppino. Lamb shank was great (fruit compote side was extremely sweet), but the cioppino was lacking. It came on pretty much a plate (WTF?)with minimal broth and unfortunately every piece of fish was overcooked. The cocktails, however, were strong and did not disappoint.\\n\\nSO WHY THE SHODDY RATING?? Because I would have expected a little more professionalism for a pretentious restaurant located in a tourist filled area. A waiter (Lance, I think was his name) serving a table of four asians nearby spoke loudly in a rather belittling tone when he realized that the group was looking to share entrees. The second he realized that the table might not bring him the revenue he expected, his tone turned a 180 and instead of walking to the hostess stand to have the host re-sit the table in a different section, HE TOLD THEM TO PICK UP THEIR STUFF AND WALK BACK TO THE HOSTESS STAND.

First thing one should know before coming here is that they are CASH ONLY.  There was an atm machine inside but it was broken, so I had to run across the street to the atm on the street corner, no biggie.  Next, the menu is up on a chalk board, and they have the donuts just randomly setting in a case, so it's not so easy to look at the donuts, see a name matched up to what they are and chose.  The chick who waited on me was rude and impatient.  I get she's sick of waiting on people to chose donuts, but guess what, that's her job.  Maybe if they had a better system it would be slightly easier.  \\n\\nOverall, the donuts were really good.  They definitely get points for creativity, but sometimes it's the creativity that also causes flaws.  For example, I purchased a huge box of donuts and then drove to Seattle.  This was about 11 am by the time I got the donuts in the box, and then add 3 and a half hours to get home.  By the time I got home, the \\"cereal\\" donuts had already gotten stale.\\n\\nI will say though, that the MANGO TANGO was probably the best donut I've ever put in my mouth.

We finally stopped ordering it and paying the extra $2 but thought we would give that another try last night and once again we were duped.

We do tend to order black bean nachos, a chicken burrito, and a chicken/black bean burrito along with chips and queso.  The seasoning on their chips, when there is enough seasoning, is so good!  It may be just salt and pepper, but it makes the chip.  Recently I ordered a norrito bowl, which according to their website's nutritional info it comes with pico, chives, and guac  However when you order online, none of that is listed on the norrito when you order it - so I got home and it had no pico or chives, but had the normal toppings + guac.

Not many doughnuts seemed to be available at the time but luckily more doughnuts were on their way.  As you probably know they have many unique doughnuts such as the cock-n-balls, bacon maple bars, and a doughnut that looks like a voodoo doll with a pretzel stick through it's jam filled heart.  After trying many of their creations I found love in their doughnut dipped in Cap'n Crunch.  I even had to smuggle some home on the plane.  For two days I would like to say I was a regular.

Let's start with the good:\\n\\nThe food was awesome.  We were presented with an amuse bouche - strawberries, blue cheese, candied nuts, and balsamic, on a leaf of belgian endive.  Awesome.  My fig appetizer with goat cheese and arugula was great.  Ugli tomato salad, prosciutto with melon, thai chicken, very good as well.  The only misstep was the beef tenderloin - was very overcooked, and the accompanying corn polenta was not good.\\n\\nThe wine list is very good and well chosen - we had a bottle of Sancerre from the Loire.  Kudos to Alanas for using Riedels!  Pricing is very good at state minimum.\\n\\nThe people we interacted with, from the hostesses, to the busboy, to other servers, were all fabulously friendly, with the exception of...\\n\\nOUR SERVER.  Who apparently had a stick up his ass the day we visited.  Very curt and distanced to the point of rudeness, even when we asked his for recommendations.  Our appetizer course took way long, as in tables seated 20 minutes after us were on their entrees.  We finally asked our server how the appetizer was doing, and got a reply of \\"the Ugli tomato salad takes longer\\".  WTF???  Please.  We all know you forgot to put the order in, but you can make up a better excuse than that.  At this point we've finished the entire bottle of wine and can't drink much more because we both have to drive.  The beef tenderloin comes out - medium well instead of the ordered medium-rare.  My wife sends it back, and we order one champagne cocktail to share.  At this point the waiter is clearly avoiding us - we don't see him in his section for like 25 minutes until the Food Runner (not our server) brings out the replacement filet.  Only when the server come back to check on us does he remember we have a drink coming - we're completely done with dinner and totally ready to leave when the last drink comes.\\n\\nWe tipped 15%, which is Extremely Punitive for us.  We can clearly see that Alana's has the Potential to be a 5 star, and we will definitely be back to give Alanas the chance to earn that rating.  Our 1st time there, solely because of the service, Alanas didn't exactly hit the ball out of the ballpark.  We are extremely hopeful that this experience was an aberration, since as I mentioned above, we chatted with other servers and they were all extremely friendly.

Had very high hopes but it turned out to be one of our all time worst dining experiences. We arrived about 1:45 PM and were immediately seated. First impression was great. It was croweded but not jammed and the atmosphere was fantastic on a sunny warm afternoon. \\n\\nThen things went way down hill!   1:55, 2:00, 2:05 , 2:10 no waitress. Finally our waitress walked-up and asked for our order. Because we were waiting so long we ordered both champagne and lunch at the same time. Then we wait for our drinks, 2:15 2:20 2:25, at this point I give it five more minutes 2:30 still no chamgage. At this point it's been 45 minutes since we arrived and we don't even have drinks so we decide to cut our losses and go to Bistro Niko. On the way out my husband went to track down our waitress who was sitting at the bar. He tells her we are leaving and her response was a very non-challant \\"okay.\\"  Just then a man walked-up with two glasses of champagne. We say we are very sorry but had been waiting for more than 30 minutes for our drinks and had decided to leave. He apologizes, promised to take care of us and offers to comp our meal.(really beyond what he needed to offer but appreciated. I relecutantly agree to stay.\\n\\n However, at this point things still do not really improve. It took another 30 minutes to get our food. Even better the food order was wrong and parts inedible.  I ordered a crouqe madame. When the waiter set it on the table I asked if it was a croque monsier or croque madame. He assured me it was a croque madame. I also had pomme frites which clearly did not have a second fry. They were cold, greasy and limp. In all honesty, the only inedible fries I've ever had.  My husband recieved his soup and entree at the same time. Both were pretty good but ice cold. When I was all but done with my sandwhich our waiter came out and told me I was right that they hade not given me a croque madame and offered me what may have been the most overdone egg I've ever seen. The entire white was brown. At this point all we could do was laugh. It was kind of a bad dream.\\n\\nWe dine out a lot (actually had dinner at Craft last night and it was fantastic). We rarely complain. I would love to give this two stars because the manager offered to comp our food but because the food was so horrendous I really can't. We were celebrating our 21st anniversary and decided it was our 2nd worst dining experience in 22 years.  I really had high hopes because I had heard wonderful things but would never go back or recommend (and we did feel guilty and pay for $30 of our meal)\\n\\nOne more thing..we noticed a table of women sit down next to us during our stay. They started by ordering a round of bloody mary's. We were laughing because when the waiter gave them their drinks he told them they needed to order right away because the kitchen staff was leaving in five minutes. Seriously? Why did they seat them?\\n\\nBad Management, Poor Service and Food = 1 star"},{"name":"Pho Goodness","address":"1150 Davie Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Popped by Pho Goodness upon a serious craving for Vietnamese and was pleasantly surprised to find tasty, savory soup, yummy rolls and friendly quick service.\\n\\nThe salad rolls are really not that great as others here commented. I think they make them in advance so the rice paper hardens a bit. They aren't bad, just not the greatest (I had better). The pork roll is made on the spot and it is yummy.\\n\\nPrices are very fair.

Father's Day Brunch\\nNote: Equinox web site shows RESERVATIONS down the right side of the page. We made reservations. On arrival, 10:50ish, approached the hostess to say we had such and in a frenzied hurry she quips 'we haven't taken reservations in 12 years, put your name on the list so we don't forget you' and she scurried off. \\nUhhhh, what was that??\\nName on the list as directed. Seated shortly there after. \\nOne special was described as chicken and waffle with country gravy and syrup. Two of us ordered it. When served (see time frame below) we had a full round waffle that couldn't have seen the iron in the last 15-20 mins. Soft and soggy with a pile of arugula in the center, chicken on top, est 4 TB 'gravy' a white watery sauce w/no flavor, syrup and wait for it....Franks hot wing sauce drenched all over. Others at the tables eyes were reacting to it. I'm a Portland foodie, I'll give it a go, even though I NEVER would have ordered it had I known. So I gave it a couple of bites and couldn't do it.  It was a stretch that didn't work for me and I would never have been able to eat that much hot sauce. My table mate, with same order, felt the same way. I asked that it be taken back and replaced with a new waffle sans hot sauce- I didn't need all new everything, just dump the square puddles of hot.  Same for my friend. Another at the table still hadn't gotten his meal. 10ish min later our chicken and waffles came back out. Now I have an almost burnt waffle, three leaves of arugula and chicken with a white drizzle. Chicken coating very good and crunchy but the chicken thigh wasn't cleaned and large pieces of fat soggy under coating.  The one friend still had no food.    \\n\\nIn the end, we ordered somewhere around 11:15 and didn't get food until 12:30. \\nThey comped three of those meals instantly, we didn't have to ask.- but I certainly would have asked for that. \\n\\nThe waitress: Was polite and appeared to be doing her part. We always have to remember they can't help it if the kitchen is backed up. She was very sorry for leaving off the Franks info, no snotting us off or exasperated looks when I wanted my waffle to go back. And what did her professional attitude that get her?? It got her the full tip as if we had not been comped. \\n\\nI have find this place TRYING to do some good things but juuuust missing the mark. Interesting combinations with lack of flavor and poor execution. \\nEggs Benedict, on my previous trip, poached eggs on dry blah bread. Worst I've had- no thought behind it. It's not hard to mess this up but they've managed to.\\nThe Pillow, eh soggy puff pastry, like the waffle, it seemed to have sat back there quite a while before coming out. \\nBloody Mary rave reviews- to each their own but our whole table found them to be unworthy of the raves.\\nMimosa- watery\\n\\nI really hope they don't want to go back again.

The service is very friendly and the ambiance is pretty good for a strip mall although they could lose the sound on the movies or turn it down.  The garlic naan is very good and large portions too, and the vegetable goa curry was good with nice amount of heat. The tandoori chicken and aloo gobi were both too salty and we had that same experience in our first meal. A huge negative for us is the lack of a brown rice option, as the white rice tastes like Uncle Bens.  We got take out, so we could eat it with brown rice at home, but they need to reduce the saltiness of several items.

We went there Monday night, 12/3/2012.  Very nice open, modern decor, my only complaint is that the tables are very close together and you become part of your neighbors' conversations.  My wife started with the frothy she-crab soup.  It was very subtle, not what you'd expect in Charleston.  For me the saving grace was the shrimp fritter that accompanied it for dipping into the soup.  I had the grilled octopus salad.  The octopus was absolutely covered in a paprika and other sauce so that it was difficult to actually taste the grilled octopus.  Kyma, although not my favorite restaurant does a better job  and more traditional job with this appetizer.  For our main course my wife and I split the flounder.  Absolutely perfectly cooked and delicious.  We couldn't finish it and took almost half of it home, but it was absolutely awesome.  Cooking fish is delicate and difficult business, and these guys do an absolutely great job.  The flounder like a great last hole on the golf course, is what will bring us back again to this place.  As sides we ordered the fingerling potatoes and turnip greens.  Like the octopus, the fingerling potatoes were dripping with this paprika sauce and again you really couldn't taste the potatoes underneath.  The turnip greens were fresh and clean, not overly cooked like you would expect in a southern style barbecue joint.  They were sweet and we enjoyed them.  For dessert we had the lemon tart with lavender meringue and honeycomb.  Absolutely delicious.  The lemon taste with the lavender was so interesting.  Not sure I understand the honeycomb on the side but we dipped the desert in the honey.  I would be curious to know the rationale behind the honeycomb with this dish which clearly didn't need it.  To drink we split a bottle of the Rose Cremant, sparkling wine at $55 for a bottle which sells for approximately $20 retail.  So not so bad.  Without tip, our bill came $139 for two.   I will definitely come back to this restaurant solely based on their ability to prepare fresh fish.  Last night I had dinner at Hal's with a couple that had similar observations, except that their sweet potato fries/chips were crispy on the outside and not cooked on the inside and corroborated my feeling about the octopus salad.  However like us, their yellowtail tuna was expertly prepared.  Unlike us, they went to the restaurant early on a Saturday, enjoyed the putt putt and outside ambience before having dinner and had a really great time.  I would be curious to hear other people's comments on the appetizers and side dishes.  I was thinking about trying the tiny clams in garlic broth and the smoked fish soup."},{"name":"Sonny's BBQ","address":"1500 East Hwy 50","city":"Clermont","stars":"2.5","text":"I have been coming here for years and the food was great, now it is awful. It tastes like they use liquid smoke on all of their meats to get all of their tastes instead of actually smoking it. You are guaranteed to get heart burn after this meal. The meat sometimes has very tough pieces in the brisket or pulled pork that you have really work your jaw to chew. The drive thru always forgets items, every single time I have to check my bag then run back in to get my missing item (usually coleslaw). Also the service in the restaurant is very slow, be prepared to be there forever.
