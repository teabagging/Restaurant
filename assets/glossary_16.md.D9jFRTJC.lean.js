I also got the salmon and avocado salad which was a good appy portion for two, or a nice portion for one - I'm not sure what kind of dressing on it, but it's light, good amount of avocado and mango. The only complaint is that the mango wasn't ripe ... but overall I would get the two dishes above, again.I tried the sunrise roll ... one of the better speciality rolls I've had in a long time.

I never realized how big the place actually is, since the dining room is not divided into separate dining rooms like it once was. Not only is it spacious, but the whole front of this Keke's are windows, allowing as much natural light to enter into a soft lit dining area. And paintings of food decorate the walls in place of a mural of athletes that included former Miami Dolphins quarterback Dan Marino.\\nI was greeted immediately and was given a menu by my hostess while she asked what I would like to drink.\\nI was given my coffee and ice water, and was told my waitress would be with me shortly. I had to wait a few minutes, but that was no problem since I had my morning coffee and newspaper. My server, Justine, made her way to my table and greeted me. I ordered the Two Pancake Combo, which featured two of the largest pancakes I have ever seen! The combo also had two eggs (over easy for me) and a choice of breakfast meat. I went with the sausage links. The pancakes were fantastic! And my eggs were cooked to my liking. \\nYou can choose either two pancakes or two french toast for your combo. And with everything, it comes up to $9.99. With coffee ($2.49) and tax, my total came up to $13.30.\\nJustine came up to my table throughout my visit, asking if I needed anything. It's nice to have the friendly and prompt service that she provided, so I have to give Justine a shout out. I did not have to worry about getting another refill of coffee or ice water, and even another waitress made the rounds, asking patrons if they would like more coffee. Speaking of coffee, a few flavored coffees are available as well.\\nKeke's may be a little pricey, but I was quite happy with my visit. And my breakfast! Which lasted me well into lunch time! The food was great, the restaurant is clean and quiet with smooth jazz playing in the dining area, and the staff was very welcoming and friendly.\\nI do not go out for breakfast that often. But I would come back again soon. This was definitely worth coming in for.\\nBefore  Keke's moved into this location, the space sat dormant for several years.

Friends have mentioned this place as well as YouTubers I have watched. Our friends got there first and got a reservation which was fine. However, the reservation told us to come back in 2 hours. Seeing that we aren't from Oregon and will probably not go back any time soon we decided to wait it out (while we were waiting we checked out Little Otsu and Salt and Straw and went to snack on tacos to keep our hungry stomachs at bay).When we did get to our reservation, it was basically close enough to closing time but they still seated us anyway which was nice. We question they water because we couldn't tell what it was infused with but later found out it was Pandan infused water. We all ordered and waited a while for our food to come out. They did it so everyone's food came out at the same time rather than individually handing out plates as they were finished. I believe I ordered the Kaeng Hang Leh, which was the pork belly stew type of meal. It came in a stone pot and had piece of meat and broth. Reading the description of it I was really excited because it said spices and pork belly with grains and what not but when the food came out I was pretty disappointed. If you are Vietnamese or know Viet food, my comparison would be Bo Kho. It tasted pretty much the same but I feel like my mom makes it better with a lot more to keep your stomach full. The meal came with what seemed to be a ton of broth and 4 pieces of meat. For the price I paid, I did not feel like it was worth it for broth and almost no meat. They were not big chunks of meat either. It tasted fine but in my opinion could have tasted better. Presentation was fine for me though! The waiters were super nice and helpful although the girl who took our reservation seemed a little bit annoyed when I asked her a question about one of the dishes which threw me off a bit. Other than that cooperation was all involved. We ended being the last people to leave the restaurant since every staff member started to clean the place up.If there is another location of this store I would try it but the reality of trying this in Oregon was just alright mediocre Thai food.

While the 90 minute wait outside (with no place to sit) wasn't ideal, it was worth it in the end. Hanover was bustling with people, which made for good \\"people watching\\" and conversation during the wait. The waiter was very good about communicating how much longer it would be once each party got to the front of the line (on deck as he said). On a positive note, the long wait and the big chalkboard wall menu made it easy to choose our meals before we even sat down at a table. This allowed us to order rather quickly. The fried calamari is very tasty and the fish was light and flaky. The linguine wasn't as good as I'd hoped, but everything else was beyond average. Our table was right next to the cook, so we watched him churn out meal after meal with skill and style. Even though the wait was tough on our feet, I'm glad we stuck it out.

The door opened, though, so we asked for seats at the sushi bar because we love watching food be prepared. Turns out sushi bar is too high and the prep area is not visible. The drink list was small because Soto is still sorting out some issues. We ordered maybe 10 plates. The service was spotty. Some plates would come out at a decent pace, others took what seemed like 15 minutes. Our server didn't notice our wine glasses were empty. I'm pretty sure our server forgot to place an order for one of the dishes, too, which we ended up cancelling because it was taking way too long to be served. The sashimi we ordered tasted under seasoned. Everything else was excellent. Our favorite dishes were the chilean sea bass soup, the omelette, and the uni pasta.

The food was good. We ordered the Japchae for our appetizer. It was pretty standard japchae, a bit soupy but still good. \\nFor our meal we ordered the LA Kalbi (we just had them cook it in the back) and the Nakji-Bokkeum. Both were very good. They did not skimp out on the octopus in the nakji-bokkeum. Some places tend to skimp out on seafood dishes and just add more vegetables and other fillers, this was not the case. It was a good balance. The nakji-bokkeum is considered a spicy dish but I wouldn't say it is too spicy. I like spice so this was a bit mild to me. In regards tot he LA kalbi, there isn't really much to say other than that it was tasty! Our food came with six Korean sides and rice. All of this was more than enough for two people. We ended up bringing home about half of our meal. On the menu I saw that they had patbingsu for $4.99 but I can't remember if that was just a summer promo. I definitely would go back to try it though. One thing I do want to give a shout out to is their bathroom. It was CLEAN!! I honestly get so happy when a restaurant's bathrooms are clean.

The food here can definitely warrant a fancier restaurant experience, but instead they make you feel welcome and comfortable. A-OK with me!First things first, the bread was amazing. Soft, warm, delicious. My only complaint is that they present a small dish with your olive oil and balsamic vinegar already in it. It is hard to get to the vinegar because the dish is so deep, meaning I had to get way too much oil to enjoy it. I'm sure they would have presented me a separate dish if I had asked, but I didn't.We ordered a carafe of the house red and it was wonderful. We sipped our wine as we devoured the meat and cheese antipasto. The meats were a little greasy for my liking, but the olives were the best I've ever had and the cheese with black pepper was awesome.When it came to dinner, we had the pappardelle with wild boar sauce (absolutely amazing and the meat was so tender and flavorful), the lasagna (rich and delicious, but you better love cheese!), and the shrimp pesto with mushrooms. The best part of each dish was the pasta, which was cooked so perfectly you probably won't believe you're still in the US. We didn't order anything from the dessert menu, but their after dinner coffees look divine.Overall this was a great experience that I would recommend to anyone looking for an authentic (and amazing) Italian dinner in Portland.

With their 1/2 price promotion, you get exactly what you pay for. Crab stick is a consistent filler throughout the menu. Any substitutions are small in accommodation and  priced to prevent you from ever deviating from the menu.

If you are getting a dessert and a drink, expect to pay at least $25 per person. That said, it is good. I have had a couple different martinis and a couple glasses of wine (including the ice wine tasting). I have also had a couple desserts. My only recommendation about the food would be to stay away from the sampler plates. They look fancy but just are not as good as a real dessert. The atmosphere is nice for a date or for hanging out with a few friends. However, I wouldn't come here for a NICE date night. It is not spectacular. The service was OK but not outstanding. They have take-out desserts which I think is nice and convenient. Overall, if you are in the area and craving some great dessert, come here.

My friend, my mother, and I, stopped by Local for a night cap, just to maybe dance a little and grab a beer. After getting our ID's checked at the door by what appeared to be a bouncer, accompanied by two local police officers, we headed to the second floor to get a drink. I ordered 3 waters and one bud light, and to my surprise, the bartender asked for my ID again (I am 25 years old and was with my 25-year old friend and 52-year old mother). After inspecting my MA license, the bartender shook his head no and handed me back my ID. I asked him what the problem was, because I have never had my state ID turned down...ever. In the rudest way possible, he said he was an \\"expert\\" on IDs and mine was definitely fake and he would not be serving me and I should leave. I asked if it would help if I brought one of the police officers from downstairs to come up and inspect my ID to which he replies \\"They'll side with me on whatever I say about an ID.\\" My mother then stepped in to see what the problem was and ensure the bartender and nearby manager that I was really 25 and my ID was real. The manager then told us that we all had to leave and that we were \\"harassing the bartender\\" even though we were all simply just confused by his reasoning behind thinking my ID was fake. We went downstairs and I explained the the police officer the situation and if he could look at my ID. He appeared to be close friends with the staff and said that the bartender had \\"more training with IDs\\" than him, which surprised me greatly for a police officer that is outside a bar. The bouncer then grabbed my ID to inspect it some more. Apparently there is a dent somewhere in my ID to which he inappropriately asked \\"did you try to crush a pill with this or something?\\" We left confused, upset, and completely mistreated in a place we frequent often.

First and foremost...I dont know why anyone would get something other than the Sangria...its a great deal to get a pitcher and it tasted great.  Our bartender told us a small pitcher was 3 glasses but we easily got 4+ glasses out of it so it was a much better deal than paying $6 a glass.  Our waiter was just okay.. I couldn't even hear what he was saying half of the time so that was a little annoying but he got our orders correct and was pleasant so not a horrible aspect of the visit.  The menu has tons of options with the front side all cold tapas and desserts and the back side all of the hot menu items and then it is split from chicken/beef/pork, then seafood, then vegetarian so it was pretty easy to navigate what areas of food we were looking to find.  Within each category there were probably closed to 20 or so options so everyone should be able to find something they would be interested in.  I ordered grilled lamb chops (can't remember the spanish name) and they were excellent and my husband ordered stuffed Quail which was definitely not my favorite at all but he enjoyed it.My #1 complaint is the prices.  I knew going in that they were known to be expensive and I knew the plates were Tapas size but considering I can get an entire plate full of food at other restaurants for the prices they were charging for a VERY mini plate was somewhat annoying so next time I will probably return for Sangria only or if if someone else is treating :)"},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"If you're planning on going to Pok Pok, give yourself a good hour to wait for a table.

It's unfortunate because the sweet potato fries and tomatillo dipping sauce that accompanied the sandwich were some of the best sweet potato fries and dipping sauce I've had with a sandwich. Also, regardless of the wellness of the cooked chicken, the sandwich was just too wet and sloppy and just fell apart, which is more of a pain than anything else. The server was friendly and the Ice tea was refreshing, and along those lines there's a great outdoor space to eat your meal, but I would not recommend Moonshine despite it's glowing reviews."},{"name":"Freshii","address":"870 West Cordova St","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"I. Love. Freshii. It's hard to find filling, relatively inexpensive vegan food in downtown Vancouver and Freshii is always my go-to. Their portion sizes are HUGE for the amount of money you pay, and the fact that you can get unlimited veggies in the build-your-own options is incredible. Their stamp-card system no longer expires, either, which means that after every certain number of items, you get one free!Although I know the bowls aren't always perfect, they do their best. It's no more error-free than a Subway, where they often shortchange you on veggies and meat as well. I've had that problem and, when politely confronted, the company does have a system in place where they give you a \\"sorry\\" card that gives you a discounted (or free, I don't remember) meal on your next visit.I've never had an issue with not getting enough vegetables or protein in my orders, nor have they ever made a mistake. It's more often than not the disgruntled customers that take to urbanspoon over the happy ones."},{"name":"Casa B Tapas and Cocktail & Rum Bar","address":"253 Washington St","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"Casa B does indeed seem a bit out of place in Union Square, but let's hope that this new restaurant elevates the Square's class factor instead of the Square pulling Casa B down.Yeah, yeah, I get it... That's the definition of gentrification and I'm supposed to think that's evil... But when a restaurant has incredible food, friendly staff, and a gorgeous interior, how can you argue?The decor is seriously beautiful. I'd go back three or four times to sit in all the different settings: downstairs at a table, downstairs at the bar, upstairs at a table, upstairs in the lounge area. And this place isn't big! There are just that many interesting details to look around at. Every detail is thoughtfully chosen. Upstairs is a modern, minimalist white look. Downstairs they have these cool Alice-in-Wonderlandy tall couches at the bar. Framed sepia family photographs line the staircase on your way down. At the tables downstairs, the light fixtures are glass-bulb Christmas-ornament-looking things with candles inside. There are wine bottles all over.Now, about the food. The tres leches cake is all that and more. Moist cake soaked with evaporated milk, topped with a marshmallowy meringue frosting, and drizzled with cinnamon-dusted dulce de leche caramel. This is one of those desserts that jumps into your stomach of its own accord, and before you know it you are looking at an empty plate. So, save some room for dessert. But even if you don't have any room left for dessert, get this.Five tapas for two people was actually TOO MANY. I ended up taking some home so we weren't overstuffed by the time dessert arrived. The Spanish paprika sauce covering the yucca fries was indeed \\"outrageous,\\" as Kristin N put it. The avocado \\"egg rolls\\" with prune and cilantro sauce were fun; the flavors were a bit hard to tease out, though. The wild mushroom saute with white sweet potato was very enjoyable. The salted cod fritters with cilantro aioli and \\"brandade\\" (apparently an emulsion of salt cod and olive oil) was too oily for my taste but the flavors were great. But the real standout of the evening was the serrano ham with guava jam on white corn toast - holy cow. I could go on eating this every day for the rest of my life. Maybe I will try.The wine list mainly includes selections from Spain, Chile, Argentina, as you would expect. Service was friendly and attentive; apparently they have read the reviews about the \\"small silverware\\" because two separate people mentioned to us that we could get full-size silverware if we wanted to use it. (Now I ask you, would anyone make that complaint at a Chinese restaurant? \\"How are we expected to eat with these useless wooden things? What a joke!\\" Can you picture it?)The only thing I wasn't 100% satisfied with was, I wished they brought out our tapas a bit more slowly. I like to have a couple of things on the table and finish those before moving on to try the next ones. When everything is brought out at once, things just get cold too fast. To me, tapas is supposed to be a long, slow meal spread out over a couple of hours. But then, I am a slow eater. Anyway, don't worry about going here if you're in a hurry - they won't keep you waiting all night for your food, that's for sure!"},{"name":"JW Marriott Orlando, Grande Lakes","address":"4040 Central Florida Pkwy","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Awesome!!! 1) This resort/hotel is fantastic and huge.\\n2) Service from staff: excellent.\\n3) The quality of food: amazing. \\n4) Will definitely come back."},{"name":"Kismet Cafe","address":"411 W 24th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"The three stars I am giving Kismet is an average of four-star food and two-star everything else; make sure to understand that nothing else besides the food warrants four stars.

The interior is narrow with exposed brick and local art for sale along the walls. The lighting is dim and cozy. The much larger courtyard outside is wide and has a domed arching ceiling. Again, love the bricks and eclectic d√©cor. The very friendly rooster who struts around completely unbothered by the diners is a nice touch. The night we visited the staff was totally overwhelmed. We waited for several minutes to be seated. When we were seated it was by one of the \\"blondes\\" whose hand were full bringing drinks to another table so we carried our own menus. There were plenty of open tables so I'm thinking this must have been a staffing issue. I saw something here I've never seen before; the dishwasher cleared our table while we still sat there. He scooped all the leftover food bits onto one plate with his hands. I'm glad we were done eating! (BTW... there were plenty of open tables and no one was waiting) Our server looked frazzled and our drinks and apps took a while arriving. We weren't in a hurry so it didn't matter much until we noticed diners seated after us getting their food first. We had the she-crab soup ($7.50) which wasn't creamy enough for my taste and had too much celery. We really enjoyed the tomato pie ($6.50) which warms you to your soul. The best way I can describe it is like a tomato and cheese quiche. I had the BBQ Chicken Melt ($9) which had a nice smoky flavor but the chicken was dry. I sampled the Orange Blossom Special ($8) with its turkey, orange marmalade, cream cheese and craisins was the better sandwich. My husband ate the remainder of my son's catfish fingers and said they were even better than his sandwich! Overall the restaurant has great potential; I'm just going to say they were having an off night.

Prices are quite reasonable, but not cheap, and their juices/smoothies are surprisingly expensive relative to the cost of a meal. Still delicious if you choose to try them. Free wifi is also nice, and they have plenty of cozy nooks to hang out and use it for a while. (Free runs out after 2 hours each day, I think, and you'd have to purchase more. But that's plenty of time for most purposes.)Downsides: Well, I don't think I could ever really become a regular at this place because so much of their food follows the same standard preparation with smaller variations.

Out appetizers finally came out around 9:15. A few minutes later we were told that our entrees would not be ready because 2 of the cooks had gone home already and the remaining cook was only willing to cook the flat rice. Ridiculous!  We tried to explain the slow service and the waiter said he could refund our money but the flat rice or cold dishes were our only option. We changed our orders and our food came around 9:30.

I understand that they were in a rush because a few customers all came in at the same time however this should not compromise the quality of the food.

I wanted to go to Gravy, but they had an hour plus wait list, so unfortunately we ended up here. We walked in just as a big party taking up three tables left. There was a party ahead of us, and another group walked in a couple minutes after we did. There was no podium with a wait list or anything, so we just stood there. Finally someone came over with a wait list and the people who came in last put their names on first (rude). Then they handed it to us, but we respectfully let the people who actually arrived before us add their name first. It took them 20 minutes to bus and break down the three tables the large group had eaten at. Then it took another 5 or so minutes for them to seat the first group, then maybe 5 more to seat the people right before us, then I had enough time to walk back to Gravy and check where we were on that list (still not even close) and walk back to Cup and Saucer before we finally got our table. Here's a piece of advice to an establishment that should be fully prepared to handle a large crowd for Sunday brunch: HIRE A HOST! Everyone who walked in after us looked confused about where to add their name, and if there were a host available to bus tables it would've gone a lot more quickly and smoothly. One of the servers told us to help ourselves to coffee and water as we were waiting. I thought that was only while we were waiting, but apparently this applies to those who are seated as well, as my husband and I both got up at least once to refill our own coffees and waters. There always seemed to be people gathered around the coffee station, so it wasn't like you could just walk right up and be done with it. I found this to be rather annoying, as I was trying to have breakfast and conversation with my husband but we had to get up a couple times just to refill our own drinks. Lame.I was hoping the food would at least be good so I could give this place two stars, but it was pretty mediocre. Portions were on the small side and there was nothing special whatsoever about the flavor. Plus after waiting so long, we were so starving we devoured it without really being able to enjoy. I will not be back to eat at Cup and Saucer, at least not this location. My experience at the Hawthorne location was much better. I understand that the staff was probably doing their best, but I find it completely ridiculous that a place that specializes in breakfast would be so understaffed on a Sunday morning.

They will meet all of your preconceived expectations of Americanized Chinese delivery/take-out.Getting the lemon chicken? Yep, it's fried white meat with plenty of lemons inside, and a container of sweet lemon sauce, easily as good as any other restaurant where I've enjoyed it. Getting the Happy Family? It's exactly what you expect, with a couple of decently sized shrimp, and a couple of scallops. I do find myself fond of the malaysian pancakes (an excuse to eat the curry sauce, really), and the schezuan dumplings had a really nice spice from all the chili oil. I'm not a huge lover of extremely-spicy foods, and I found dishes like the Beef w/ Spicy Garlic Sauce and the General Tso's chicken quite mild -- so don't be afraid to ask them to spice it up generously if you normally like it that way.I have never been to the restaurant -- I always use them for delivery. And with the couple of dozen of options for Chinese delivery to me, saying that I -always- order from Aloha is a pretty strong recommendation. They deliver late, they deliver reasonably quickly every time, they deliver on Christmas day. Very convenient for me.I haven't tried their more authentic foods, as Cindy W mentions, so I'm going to make an effort to start trying some of those. Maybe that will make me feel good bumping them up a star or two.Overall, I have nothing bad to say about Aloha.

Later, I saw the same kind of small horoscope pocket calendars being sold.  They were a different company's, but they were the right size and did the same thing.  This is a store that is interested in the customers' feedback, then acts on it."},{"name":"Mad Mex - Columbus","address":"South Campus Gateway, 1542 N High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"I come here at least once every year for the Gobblerito and this year, it didn't disappoint.

Both of us got hot for heat level on the papaya salad and I got Thai hot for my Tom Ka soup and my friend got hot. \\nLet Me tell you they did not disappoint. The proof was we both were sweating whilst taking gulps of water. Lol. They spiced both dishes perfectly.\\nThe Papaya salad was good. It was papaya, green beans, tomatoes, peanuts, chili peppers and lettuce. I was slightly disappointed that their was no lime. And that they didn't include any rice. \\nThe Tom Ka soup was very good. I mean delicious. It had all of the fragrant herbs and spices.  Which makes this soup so good. Mine had long cuts of lightly fried tofu, cabbage, broccoli, green beans, carrots and fresh mushrooms.  My only minor difference for my next visit I would request a little less tofu and some more veggies. Here again they didn't serve us any rice with the soup. Kind of surprised me no rice for either papaya salad nor Tom Ka soup. All of the vegetables in the soup were cooked perfectly (not over cooked) also all of the food the salad and soup were salted perfectly not at all over salty.We both enjoyed our late lunch.

I am a sucker for advertising that uses extremely beautiful women who look like pin-ups.B.) We're always on the hunt for good breakfast places to fulfill these special infrequent mid-week breakfast dates.We got into the place to find a fantastic space. Large, well lit, and the griddles in the tabletops are a stellar gimmick.This morning happened to be the 'Late Start Day' for most if not all of Portland Public Schools. We saw the formula in action as many of the tables were filled with elementary school aged kids making their own flapjacks atop these griddles.I first need to acknowledge that the staff here was superb. Friendly, accommodating, pleasant, down-to-earth and far from the snobbery steeped servers that have rubbed us the wrong way on many occasions at other establishments.Strong Stumptown coffee kept my heart pounding. My wife and I opted out of the griddle cake making orgy and into some standards.She ordered the Eggs Benedict (Slappy Benedict) with prosciutto and I went with the old fashioned breakfast (two eggs, bacon, toast and potatoes).The food was great. Good portions and done well. My eggs were a tad bit on the rare side (for scramble) but I appreciate that each chef has 'their' way of doing scrambled eggs.The one complaint that I have is the lighting. The height at which the lights hang over the table coupled with the brightness of the bulbs, causes a bright atmosphere that would melt even the most hearty hungover folk.Unfortunately, on this day the lighting nearly gave my lady a migraine. A few things come to mind though in this; the lights likely cannot go lower because of the distance that needs to be between tables and tabletop griddles and the other thought is that the lights may not be on a dimmer and thus, are not capable of being brought down a tad bit. This may be something for those light sensitive hangovers to consider (at least until one or more of their delectable cocktails has been poured down your gullet)We'll be back.

We were the second party on line and we still needed to wait about 30 minutes. Totally worth it!The four of us shared two appetizers and two entrees. For appetizers, we got the the Calamari Platter and Baked Clams. Calamari Platter is a nice taste test to the different calamari styles they make including fried calamari, calamari meatball, calamari salad, and pieces of fried fish. Baked Clams were huge and juicy! It was super fresh and the clam flavor was sweet. It was good! For entrees we got their infamous Aglio Olio, the squid ink pasta and the Mixed Seafood Combo Pasta. Aglio Olio, is squid ink linguine with minced calamari, olive oil, garlic, and anchovy. Garlic flavor is very pronounced and it is really good! Mixed Seafood Combo Pasta is linguine with calamari, scallops, mussels, clams, and shrimp. This was the perfect pasta dish for me! It was freakin' amazing!!! The sauce was so good that I had to dip bread in there to soak everything up! Linguine was perfectly cook and it was the perfect chew! Love it!

A very courteous manager who seems to just want things to be perfect with the dining experience. Free wi-fi.Not going to give it 5 stars because sometimes things arent labelled in the cabinet, like my husband (nut allergic) ordered a muffin, and to be honest it was a combination that could have nuts in it, but the flavour wasnt specified as being say cranberry walnut, the server just said cranberry. We should have asked, we usually do, but lukcily I realised there were nuts in it so all was ok. We went at the weekend and I see that htey now have a notice at the till saying full ingredients availible on request - that is really good.Brunch at the weekend, as usual was awesome!

It seems like every 1st Saturday of the month it will host a party for urban professionals. I had a great time. The DJ did his thing and people were friendly. The entire event was upstairs so I I didn't get a chance to see the first floor. The service was great and they were prepared for the party crowd by opening up an extra bar.I already love the lounge area, but I will be back in the house soon to check out the southern food a peeped on the menu.Update 7/23\\nI have been back three times to eat here and I have one thing to say, Smoked Chicken Spring Rolls. Seriously though, this has become one of my favorite appetizers that isn't spinach dip. As far as meals, everything I've had or tasted has been great. Both times I've ordered Shrimp and Grits with chicken sausage, but next time I go I plan to get the Chicken & Dumplings. It tasted phenomenal.

Maybe BECAUSE of the awesome reviews I had some sort of expectation. Sadly, this place did not live up to it. I came around 6:15 pm on a cold, winter evening and even though there were ~3 parties ahead of us, we still waited almost half an hour. I didn't mind the wait too much. (despite the cold weather). We ordered the black pasta Aglio Olio, and Monkfish Marsala. The waiter accidentally gave us fried calamari appetizers that we did not order. He was helping other customers (he was the only waiter there) so it just sat on our table until we told him we did not order it. He was pretty awesome and just said \\"just eat it\\" (no charge, yay!)  This was probably because it wasn't \\"hot off the fryer\\" for the intended customers so a new batch was made for them. So I did appreciate that they wanted their customers to have hot plate of food. The actual food was okay. The monkfish had a sort of sweetness to it that I liked, and it was definitely fresh. The black pasta was garlic-y and filling. However everything, in my opinion, tasted a little too bland for my taste. Overall, I did enjoy my dinner.

We are always excited to try a new barbecue place. The location is great, right in Castleberry Hill with a great view of downtown Atlanta. The space is great, casual without looking cheap. The servers and staff were all very nice and efficient.The food was really very good. The smoke and bark on the ribs were some of the best I have ever tasted. The sides were innovative without being silly. The fried brussels sprouts being an example. Mac and cheese was creamy and cheesy. Baked beans were very meaty and flavorful. The only thing that wasn't good was the corn bread, it was dry and a little flavor less.The problem is most of it was all WAY too spicy. I don't know why so many local barbecue chefs seem to think that the only way to make good BBQ is to make it so spicy you can't get through more than a rib. Bone Lick has the same issue. The ribs taste really good but are so spicy that you can't taste anything past the first one. Don't get me wrong, I love spicy food. I love a good wasabi but it was way too hot. And there was nothing to cool it down. The ribs were spicy, the beans were spicy the sauce was spicy, the chipotle dip for the fried pickles was spicy. Where is the balance? The only thing that wasn't so spicy was the Mac and Cheese and brussels sprouts.Why do you think Fox Brothers and Community-Q have hour long waits or a line out the door? The spice is just right. Your mouth isn't on fire after you eat a plate of ribs.So, as much as we loved the flavor of the food we won't be going back anytime soon."},{"name":"Moonshine Patio Bar & Grill","address":"303 Red River St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"For a casual change of pace, go to the patio area - it has an indoor relaxing bar are with full food service as well as the outside patio.

Both were pretty great. Food did not look super appetizing in the case, so we skipped it. They were working on hanging their outdoor sign, so it was a BIT loud and disruptive while we were there, but I imagine these are just little kinks to work out while they are getting opened. We weren't offered a chance to sign up for any rewards program other folks have mentioned, which is a bit of a bummer.

The pink velvet seashell booths, the lovely accents, beautiful wine glasses and silverware, romantic windows featuring a glimpse of Gastown on the corner of Water and Carrall Street...What brought me back was an old coupon from the DineOut Festival at another Gastown restaurant. A great deal - two entrees for the price of one, so I went with a friend. We tried the octopus carpaccio with smoked paprika aioli, piquillo pepper and fried bread. I felt the aioli complimented the octopus very well with its tangy flavour, and it was interesting to see the octopus sliced flat instead of in strips. The fried bread was a nice addition on top like croutons in a caesar salad. I personally could have gone without the piquillo pepper but it was a nice touch. A beautiful and colourful presentation!The risotto with 5 oz lobster tail was phenomenal. Very rich in lobster flavour and garnished with lemon, parmesan and peas. The lobster was cooked to a bright red shade, neatly cut and perfectly cooked. Portion size was just right but I wish I had more.My friend had the breaded cutlets of petrale sole, and we laughed when it arrived because we hadn't realized we basically ordered fish and chips. Nevertheless, it did not disappoint especially with the batter. The fries here are unusually delicious as I feel that is commonly neglected at more upscale restaurants - probably my favourite restaurant fries in town. The breaded sole was served with capers and brown butters.Above all, pleasant experience both times I went - if you make a reservation, they will also call you the day before to confirm it.

I thought our table for two was well placed amongst other patrons, I found the lighting and  decor to be quite trendy and comfortable, and the staff was extremely attentive to our needs. With a starter of dirty martinis, I found that the bread and jalapeno spread added a nice zest to the palate. We were soon after greeted with a vast selection of oysters by the dozen and a single serving of shrimp (four very generous pieces in total). The server who delivered the oysters was also very careful to re-describe each set of oysters and to also suggest pairings with the presented cocktail sauces, etc. Overall, I found this to be a great way to start the evening and would suggest it for both intimate dates as well as group gatherings.

The Sunday brunch has a wide variety of options that include many southern staples (grits, migas, jalapeno sausages) but also a number of unexpected items like smoked salmon mousse and turkey croissants.  A variety of baked treats is also available and I love their deviled eggs.  Expect to wait in line, but it's worth it.This is also a fun place for happy hour although the bar area is small.  They have some great food options such as the 'corn dog shrimp' and baked brie.  And don't even think about skipping their tasty cocktails such as the harvest moon tea and hard lemonade served up in jelly jars for $4.  Popcorn is brought to the table automatically to further whet your thirst.  For dinner, I highly recommend the Pork Chop - ever since I tried that it's hard for me to order anything else as I think it's one of the best I have ever had.  Before I stumbled onto that I had also enjoyed the flat iron steak and the sesame seared tuna on several occasions.  Lastly, I'm not much of a dessert fan myself most of the time but I did have a taste of the red velvet cake and peanut butter mousse pie ordered by my friends and they were quite delicious.

Thank you yelpers for your recommendations from the menu. We tried Ike's wings and Kai yang (roast chicken) with the sticky rice. The chicken comes with two delicious sauces - one sweet, one a bit on the hot side (say a 3 out of 5). I dipped in both sauces and got a nice mix of flavors. I don't know what superlatives to use for this place except that we will go back to POK POK every chance we get. The vibe is cool, the price is just right, the service is excellent, and most of all - the food is king.

Never been but I've watched lots of travel shows. Maybe I'll go soon. Ike's Vietnamese Fish Sauce Wings (spicy):\\nI love wings. Fatty, crispy, spicy wings. These seemed kind of pricey for 6 but if you're used to buffalo style wings this is more like 12 because it's served as a whole wing. It was worth every penny. You must try these.

It was SO salty. Do the chefs not know it's so salty? It seems like all the reviews i've read have mentioned about the wings being too salty. It's definitely too salty to enjoy in my opinion.  The flavor was ok. I do taste the fish sauce and it is mild and not overpowering, but just toooooooooooo salty. Also with the spice levels, it was not spicy at all. I do believe the \\"spicy\\" tolerance of people around here are different. The wings are so overrated in my opinion and SOOO overpriced. Six wings for $15.75.. are you serious? What makes these wings worth this much? It was so disappointed. My sister and I were not able to enjoy the food nor was able to finish it. I seriously believe the wings are placed at a higher price point because of the attention it gets.

I selected an egg scramble with squash, kale, and goat cheese and a few other veggies that was absolutely delicious.

The only strange thing that happened was that a high school aged guy jumped the railing and approached our table to ask for money for something.  He had a list and was taking whatever contributions but it was very odd because we were eating and he just came right up and starting putting stuff on our table and interrupting the meal.  I was impressed that the staff very quietly, politely and effectively told him that he needed to leave and he did without incident.  I appreciated that.  You somewhat expect these things to happen in the parking lot as you walk to your car (usually they are selling candy) but I do think it is inappropriate to allow people representing whatever cause to approach paying customers in a restaurant while they are dining and ask them for money.

Okay.Being that the place had hot sandwiches I had my duty laid before me: get the Reuben. What better litmus test for a deli is there than to sample their Reuben?Well, I should have gone with the thing on the menu that caught my eye. It wasn't the Reuben, it was a Philly Beef sandwich of some variety on some sort of Asiago bread maybe? At any rate, I was with Lisa S. and she got it and it was AMAZING. My Reuben was far from, however.It wasn't a bad sandwich. In fact, if it was sold as a Reuben-like corned beef melt, well, hell, it would have been perfectly delectable. Alas, it was labelled a Reuben and, standing less than an inch high, it made a sad one at that.Girth aside, it was definitely tasty, if- again- more melt-y than Reuben-y. The bite I had of Lisa's Philly whatever guy was the true experience, and I kind of want to go back ASAP so I can get THAT sucker, and maybe even ratchet the rating up a star.But for now, Spinelli's, I can only safely say you are A-OK. You did, however, introduce me to Voodoo chips by whatever company that was... Zapp's, according to Google... and those were damn fine.I'll be back soon. I was very impressed by the size of the menu that seemed to do a lot with a modest set of ingredients instead of being terrifyingly all-over-the-place.

I always feel satisfied after eating my meals here. (I usually order the P-7: roasted chicken served on a bed of hummus, with a side of tabouli, salad, and a large pita bread). \\n-The FRENCH FRIES...goodness....The fries are perfectly crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. And, whatever they season their fries with is just out of this world delicious. If you wanna add a large order of french fries to your regular plate -- it only costs 1.50!!!!! \\n-THE HUMMUS. Hands-down: KISMET HAS THE BEST HUMMUS. The hummus is incredibly creamy and rich -- trust me, it is like no other restaurant-made or store-bought hummus in Austin. You will be doing yourself a disservice if you do not order hummus from Kismet, during your visit. \\n-FALAFEL. SO DAMN GOOD. BEST IN AUSTIN, AS WELL. I have not been able to find falafel as delicious as the falafel served at Kismet. Other places I have visited make the pieces way too large -- consequently ,the inside of the falafel is too hard and oily :( But, the falafel at Kismet is the perfect size -- and crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. PERFECT. PERFECT. PERFECT. Mmmmm -- and it tastes even more mind-blowing with the tahini sauce.\\n-I have only eaten the ROASTED CHICKEN from Kismet -- but, it's also DAMN DELICIOUS. \\n-Not only is the food the best type of mediterranean food you can find in Austin -- the prices are also the lowest. My meals typically cost 4-5 dollars more at other restaurants -- despite the food not tasting as good and the portions not being as large as what Kismet offers. \\n-BACKLAVA = SUPER DELICIOUS TOO. \\n-THE FOOD IS FRESH. YOU CAN HAVE YOURSELF A NICE MEAL HERE AND NOT FEEL GUILTY AFTER. \\n-OWNER & STAFF ARE SUPER, SUPER FRIENDLY. \\nKISMET IS THE BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The salad was nicely done, a good balance of flavors.  The grilled prawns were okay, they could have used a lilttle more cleaning.  The sauce that was served with the prawns was delicious and they should have recommended the sticky rice with this dish.  The khao soi was good.  The flavors were correct, however there was a thick layer of oil floating on top.  Also, the chicken was not simmered long enough in the curry sauce.

Not because they weren't good, they were delicious but after three days of beasting my way through the city I could finish my last half egg. They give two large eggs, so you have four pieces.

I've visited two other BBQ joints in my lifetime, and all those experiences lead to this day where I sat down and bit into bliss. Their brisket is wonderfully moist and bursts with beefy goodness. Their original sausage is juicy, with all the right spices creating a party in your mouth. The BBQ sause (yes, s-a-u-s-e) is the glue that brings it all together in a very non-ketchup-y way. I loved the cole slaw, but it was a downer for my husband. Each to their own, right? That potato salad is something I'm craving at this very moment (six hours later). Their banana and chocolate pudding is the perfect ending to a satisfying meal. I can't believe my other BBQ experiences were CRAP compared to Rudy's.

Sometime after that, it seems there was a drastic change in the food and the service. I have not eaten there very often in the past few years, but I gave it a try again this past weekend. It was one of the worst dining experiences I have had in Portland. The sushi was falling apart, and everything---the sushi, the noodle soup, and the side dishes---was very salty. But it was the service that was offensive and insulting. We entered and became part of a large group of people waiting to be seated, even though there were many open tables in the bar (for happy hour) or for regular dining. The receptionist seemed to enjoy her important role \\"managing\\" the extremely busy crowd. People were not seated on a first-come-first-served basis. And we were seated at the back on a food bar in the regular dining area, even though we requested a seat in the bar and there were available tables in the bar. But we stayed anyway because we had already waited over 20 minutes along with several others. After we were seated at this food bar. which had all 10 seats available when we got there, another couple (which had arrived before us) was later brought to this area. Then 2 more couples joined us. With 8 of us now at his food bar, I noticed that only two of the 8 were Caucasians. There was one African American woman and the rest of us were Asians.  Maybe it was a coincidence, but as we left we saw white patrons, who had arrived after us, seated at one of the tables in the bar which was open throughout the time we stood at the front waiting for a table. I couldn't help but feel like this Japanese restaurant discriminates against Asians. I have usually found that establishments and people in Portland consciously make an effort not to engage in any behavior that might be interpreted as racist. If anything, people seem to make special allowances for me---or so it seems.

The basic formula is bowl of brown rice, plus raw veggies, plus some superfoods (flax, tamari almonds), and then everything is smothered in delicious dressing and heated.  It sounds gross but it's good, and presumably good for you.  One downside is that all the bowls pretty much taste the same (but still good!).  When under a mess of dressing, my palate doesn't really distinguish between beets and broccoli (the Rebel), on the one hand, and carrots and broccoli (the Swami) on the other.  My mind reads it as \\"healthy stuff, healthy stuff, seeds,\\" plus awesome dressing. BTW, the hot sauce is amazing!  Everything else is just a vehicle for hot sauce and dressing delivery.Smoothies are also awesome, and not your standard \\"strawberry banana\\" at every other cafe.

It was good - lots of cheese holding the pieces together. Not much in the way of greens. Good amount of beets.

As a vegetarian, I am probably not the best person to review the restaurant as a whole, but I will cover the bits that matter to most people:Atmosphere - I like it, both inside and out.  Inside is my favorite, as they have tastefully dark decor, yet proper lighting.  It feels clean, warm, and comfortable.  The bathrooms are clean and nicely done too.Service - Never had bad service.  The servers are prompt, attentive, and more than happy to make recommendations.  If they can accomodate your special requests, they are happy to do so.Food - All the veg options I've tried have been really good.  I was lukewarm to the food until my 3rd trip, at which point I guess it 'clicked'.  I often recommend this restaurant to people from out of town looking for good Asian cuisine.Bar - I think they've done a great job of putting together unique cocktails with some exotic ingredients.  Everything seems to be done with a nice flair that sets it appart.  Tastefully done, I should add.I will continue to go there several times per year.  If anything, the hardest part about being a food-lover in PDX is that there are so many great places to try (and new ones opening up all the time), that I don't think one could ever keep up.

Luckily the hostess saw my struggle and asked me what I needed so I was finally able to get the bill. Once I had the bill prepped and ready to pay, it sat on my table for a good 5-10 minutes while my waiter was just chatting up the hostess about personal life.

It's so rare to find an authentic Chinese restaurant in Austin, and it's especially hard to find one with the BBQ meat stand where they sell meat by the pound. However, I came across an incident where they took advantage of the fact that I don't speak Chinese. I was here to order xa xiu (BBQ pork) by the pound. The signs were in Chinese. I read a little, but the owners could tell I was struggling and noticed that I asked my friend for help. Luckily my friend is fluent in Chinese because she then overheard the guy ask the lady how much they should charge me because they were gonna charge me more. My friend busted out her Chinese to order for us, and the owners had this 'oh-shit' look on their faces, probably knowing we were up to their tricks. The restaurant had styrofoam to-go containers and some nicer plastic ones. My order was in the plastic and my friend's was in the styrofoam. Since we were bringing the food to a potluck, my friend asked if she could have hers boxed in the plastic containers, at which the guy responded that he'd charge her for it. She was like, \\"Really?...\\", then he changed his mind and gave them to her for free.That's why this review is mixed.

What I can comment on is the good service and the renovation of the inside - lots of shiny wood with a fresh and clean look.  Wow, talk about a makeover from its dingy predecessor.  However, they missed the boat by not expanding the loos.  When you have a packed house and everyone is getting their drink on, having only one loo per gender causes a lot of crossed legs.  Not good!"},{"name":"Maizal RMF","address":"2815 Main Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4.5","text":"I'm always a bit reluctant to review a place as New as this because sometimes it takes a while to work out all the kinks, but here it is.It was... ok...Having spent a large part of my life in SoCal I have high standards when it comes to Mexican food. The people here are sweet and accommodating and it felt like a family establishment. I'm also so glad to see more Mexican options in Vancouver. My friend and I ordered an assortment of tacos and they were good. Not amazing but pretty good.I was super excited to see that they make their al pastor the REAL way, similar to shawarma (it was started by Lebanese immigrants in Mexico) on the spinning stick. The al pastor was pretty good, but their tinga de pollo was just ok. I think my fave was the carnitas with the addition of chicharron which gave it a little porky crunch. The veggie tacos were just ok also.It was awesome to see them cranking out fresh tortillas right there before putting them on the flat top, but I think they could use a little extra cooking time because most of the tortillas fell apart as we were eating.Still, great to see a new taco shop in the hood and the people running it are super sweet. I'll definitely be back in a bit to see if they've ironed out some of the issues."},{"name":"Morton's The Steakhouse","address":"213 SW Clay St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"The waiters were great as were our martinis.

And be warned- it will keep you buzzing all day long! I am excited to go back and try something else, as I really enjoyed the cold brew. The price is a touch steep for coffee, but that is to be expected given the quality and the process to brew it, so it's nice to treat yourself every now and then."},{"name":"Jolly Roger","address":"1340 S E 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Overall it's a Divey feeling sports bar. It's dark inside and there's a few TVs. Good ranch for the dinosaur wings which were so nice especially for $1.50/ea during hh! The ranch is the kind of thicker type which is what I prefer especially for dipping wings with. The dinosaur wings are a great size and so flavorful. I had one buffalo and a Jamaican jerk. I enjoyed each equally. The skin was the best part and I'm not usually a fan of chicken skin. The Jamaican jerk is a dry rub and made the skin extra tasty b/c it was crispy, dry and packed with flavor from the seasoning.The chips & salsa that comes with the fish taco is good stuff. I really liked their\\nFish taco was a generous size but had chipotle sauce on it which is not my fav but the fish itself was perfectly cooked.Service was excellent. We sat outside b/c the weather was nice and there was no football on outside lol. Our server was so nice to us even though she had to keep walking inside/outside just to serve us since we were the only ones outside but she was cool and we took care of her in the end for being such a great sport. If this were Vegas they would have probably told us outdoor seating was closed b/c they didn't want to cater to just one table all the way outside but not in Portland!Their build a burger is quite an amazing deal. Starting off at $2.75 for a single patty, want cheese add a quarter! Want extra toppings? They're ONLY a quarter! You can build yourself quite the custom burger for like $4 and it'll be stacked with topping and delicious to boot!The drinks were averaged price, nothing to write to bargain Betty about. I had their hefe and the wife had a raspberry cider which was very refreshing and light. I really enjoyed both. They did have PBR on tap and I think it was like $2 and I always say a place with PBR on tap is always an okay joint with me."},{"name":"Baraka Cafe","address":"812 Memorial Dr","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Hmmm, I was really puzzled to read all of the negative reviews of the service here, and of the owner. I've been to the restaurant and taken others there at least half a dozen times now. I find the owner extremely nice and courteous, and we chatted with her on several occasions. Service varied, sometimes faster, sometimes slower, sometimes a bit more confused - which I attribute to language issues - it IS a family business, but we always got what we wanted.  I personally find their eggplant dip appetizer to be fabulous, and their classical couscous extremely authentic. I've tried their other vegetarian couscous too, and that was extremely good as well. I cannot comment on the tastes of other choices there. My only disappointment there was the \\"special\\" appetizer ravioli, which was very expensive, and not very tasty. I reverted back to the usual on subsequent visits. I find that with lemonade and coffee, we always end up at less than $20/pp for two courses, but then again it's the veggie choices, which are in fact cheaper."},{"name":"Island Creek Oyster Bar","address":"500 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Hands down my favorite meal in Boston!

Island Creek Oyster Bar is a definite must-eat if you're in the Boston area -- the food was really good, the wine was excellent, and the ambiance was chic and contemporary!First off, there's nothing more annoying than paying for water at a nice restaurant. But Island Creek offers sparkling or still water on a complementary basis, which is a definite A+ for starters!!!  A very yummy honey bread with a spicy cayenne butter arrived at our table as we were deciding on wines.  Our waiter was really knowledgeable about the wines on the list. We were looking for a NZ Sauvignon Blanc by the glass, but he suggested a French SV instead, which paired perfectly with the selection of oysters we orded.The waiter said that the restaurant can go through 2,500 oysters in a good night, which means that the oysters are always fresh. Ours, a selection from MA, were delish! The sauces that come on the side were mucho fun to try on each little delectable bite!!!!For mains, we tried the seafood casserole (which home-made saltines -- yummers!) which consisted of a very rich and yummy broth, with heaps of meaty seafood. It was simply divine -- the perfect wintery comfort food! We also tried two appetizers....the crab cake and the mussels in saffron sauce.  The mussels were particularly amazing -- out of their shell, and accompanied by a beautiful broth and some balls of pasta, and a really hearty, cheesy crouton that melted in your mouth.After all of this amazing food, there was no room for dessert. But don't worry, we will be back!!!!

Nothing we would be willing to stand in line for and freeze for again.\\n4) On a positive note, the flavors were different than your average SE Asian restaurant and the offerings were not run-of-the-mill.

But was very scrumptious. I liked how it came on a wooden paddle. Cute!Coffee here is light to medium, so if you're not a hardcore drinker you are good to go! I got regular coffee while my sister got the pour over. It was pretty decent. My friend got the New Orleans iced coffee which in my opinion, is one of their best drinks. It's just very good!I think they sanitize their water glasses. They were hot when you touch them! Service was great! People were nice and even cleaned tables and took plates. I like the space more than the other location. The walls are white and it felt much more open. They've got more tables too, it seemed. Love all the natural light as well!The demographic seems different here. I saw a lot of young families and folks my grandparents' age. There were still young people here though, but not as many as I see at the other location.As it approached noon, the place cleared up. It wasn't as busy and there were more open tables.

We apparently bothered him as he kept walking away when we asked any questions, like, what was the pasta special of the day? Soup special? When he came back to the table he's goes, I guess y'all have questions about the sandwiches too?, with irritation in his tone. I said, yes, I actually do. What is on the pastrami sandwich? He goes, it's a traditional pastrami sandwich, with an attitude. That was super annoying so I asked, WHAT does that include? He leaves again, comes back and throws the full menu on the table and leaves again. This guy was a nightmare, skinny balding white guy that would go down energy drink shots between leaving us at the table. We got up and left in disgust, never to return again.

He delighted in light rail, our stroll from there to the Food Cart Pod on Alder and..maybe..Park?  not sure, but he walked around the block, salivating twice before picking lamb curry and rice.  I had Hawaiian yakasoba and chicken..I love noodles and can't find them in the burbs any more so this was a real treat. However it was really raining by then so we booked it to Powells coffee shop and snuck in to eat there.  Shared a table with a lady from France who was also delighted with Powells.After our lunch we split in different directions.  My friend has a son who is an author-he was thrilled to see his sons book there in the Horror section and had me snap a picture of him with the book to email to son.  The book went into his bag as well as a book on Truman (for$9.00) and a couple of other large volumes.  We ended up spending 6 hours there and I'm sure he would have loved to spend even more time.  As someone who used to work downtown, Powells is an old hat for me, but I did decide to pick up 2 books on Lewis and Clark-a journal and a novel based on the journal.  I love Powells, especially the downtown store.  I live in Beaverton and have found the store at the mall to be less Powells-like in ambiance.  Actually I found it to be somewhat unfriendly on occasion.  But there is always downtown, and it's not that far away.Thank you Powells for helping me entertain my friend for an entire day."},{"name":"Moxie's Grill & Bar","address":"808 Bute Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"I still wish Yelp would allow 1/2 stars! This is a 4.5. \\nWhile in Vancouver for my first trip to attend a convention, some co-workers and I started looking for an interesting place to eat with a nice patio. We first stopped at Joe Forte's but the wait was over 2 hours for a patio table! So we wandered down Robson Street and spotted Moxie. From the outside it looked like a very casual burger type joint. But once you get inside, its a lot more. Beautiful interior, very modern and comfortable. \\nWe were greeted warmly and were told a patio table would be 15 min, so we went to sit in the bar and have a drink and wait. Our cocktail waitress was very nice and took orders quickly. I had one of the best Mojitos ever. Nicely done. \\nAfter about 20 min, we were called to our table. It's a smaller patio, but nice. Waitress was over in about 5 min and warmly greeted us, and took a new drink order and some apps. We had the sweet potato fries and schechwan string beans. The fries came in about 10 in. They were cooked perfectly and had 2 sauces, a chipotle aiole and a curry aiole, very nice! \\nWe ordered dinner, I had the roaster chicken with goat cheese, my part had a steak salad, sirloin Oscar, and halibut. \\nThey came in a bout 15 min, a bit slow we thought. \\nHowever all the meals were wonderful! All were cooked perfectly and seasoned perfectly. My chicken came with a rice pilaf and broccoli. The broccoli was great! Either cooked in a lemon water, or more likely had freshed squeezed lemon. \\nWe did not have desserts. \\nAll in all a very pleasant dinning experience.

I first heard about the restaurant owner/author/James Beard Award Winner Chef Andy Ricker when I watched Anthony Bourdain's The Parts Unknown. I watched them indulging in various Northern Thai delicacies (no thanks I'm not big on blood soup or sheep's brain) but I realized that Chef Ricker seemed to have an extensive understanding of cuisine from this region of the world and I was immediately intrigued. It had been on my radar to try Pok Pok for a long time and I was not disappointed in the experience. The food is meant to shared so my friend and I shared everything that we got. The first thing that I tried here was a dish of complementary roasted peanuts they put on the table. I love bar snacks like this so this is a nice touch. Their signature dish is Ike's Vietnamese Fish Sauce Wings ($15.75). These are hands-down the best wings I have ever had. EVER. They are flavorful and the meat is cooked perfectly. Get this and you will not regret it. We also got Muu Sateh ($13.75) which are charcoal-grilled pork loin skewers served with peanut sauce, a cucumber relish and grilled bread. This is a tasty and filling dish. We ordered a couple of other things but these were really my favorite and worth going into detail about. I was really glad that we came here in spite of the long wait (over 1 hour for 2 people) because the food is honestly worth it. I would definitely be back if I am in town in Portland or would try another Pok Pok location.

The Benedict tasted fresh and the cod cake was nice and crispy.  You definitely need to be in the mood for something salty though as it does live up to its description.

I was impressed that somebody would try something like this in a place like Lowell.I went late on a Saturday afternoon and the restaurant was crowded, but most people seemed to be staring at laptops and other devices, not eating. As a consequence, there was no seating upstairs, so I was forced to find a table in the basement, which was hot and clammy even though it was cool outside.Life Alive has counter service, never a good thing in my view. I cook for myself most of the time and like to be waiting on when I go out. But the line was short and my food came quickly. The restaurant had an atmosphere somewhere between a college lounge and a daycare. It wasn't the sort of place I wanted to linger anyway.I ordered the The Fool -- udon noodles with ginger sauce, shiitake mushrooms carrots, onions, tofu, greens, and sesame seeds. It was pretty good, but a little soupy and not especially flavorful.

There was no waiter and it literally took my friend 20 min to get a drink from the back bar.Once we were seated, the problems continued.  I don't know if our waiter was new or just had multiple tables besides ours.  He forgot drinks and we didn't get our food until 9:40.  That's literally more than 2 hours after our reservation time.  My salad with shrimp was good but $18 for a garden salad with FIVE shrimp?  What was good was the warm Brie appetizer.  The macaroni and cheese is always a go to.We ended up leaving around 10:45.  This was my birthday celebration and we had planned to go out and have a drink with this party.  Unfortunately, we ended up having to come home after dinner to relieve our sitter.

This is a Taiwanese street food vendor dish. We have order Oyster pancake, Salt and pepper chicken, Crispy fried rib, Gua bao, Ba wan. The oyster package is good in US that I have visited. The oyster need to be small or tiny side to make this dish. The flour that use for the package is tasty. The salt and pepper chicken is not up to the task. I believe they need to increase the five spice ingredient a bit more to make the flavor. Crispy fried rib is good since the mix of spice and the coating is balance and crispy. Sometime the coating over power the spice. I have to said this restaurant did it correctly. The gua bao is the pork belly insert into the open bun. The bun is soft and nice. Good technic of the chef to create this bun. The pork belly is braise with sweet soy source. This create the starch and meat ingredient mix. Ba Wan is the stuff meat ball and quail egg in the rice flour and steam to the right temperature to cook. This dish is base on the rice flour and source that add on later.

After the wait be ready to sit elbows to elbows with people next to you as there is only about 16 seats in the little.tiny like boutique.

There is no menu to be given when you are seated as the giant black wall will have everything you need to see chalked into place!For the appetizers, you must try the calamari! In my opinion you will not even need to order the marinara sauce to accompany it (extra 1$) since the seafood is that damn fresh. Great indicator of what's to come as the breading was a bit thicker than the norm but the squid pieces were springy, chewy and bursting with flavor~.My friends all opted for various seafood such as shrimp, clams and scallops in white sauce and linguine because they're a bunch of chickens hahaha.

The waiter came after a few minutes to give us water and menus and told us the specials. The prices didn't seem out of line in comparison with other Italian restaurants in town. Nice quiet area.  the food is another story.\\nMy husband had the soup which was okay, very starchy, I had the Bruschetta, two pieces for a serving, whereas most restaurants would give 3-4 for an order. It was okay. Not much Basil and tomatoes were definitely not hot house which are in season now. A bit underripe. Served on a bed of bitter greens which took away from the taste of tomatoes which should have tasted from Balsamic vinegar, olive oil, basil and salt. Would have rather had another slice of tomato then bitter greens which were difficult to cut and eat.\\nMy husband had the spaghetti and meatballs which were mediocre and I \\nhad the veal parmigiana. The serving was small, small bit of vegetables which were grilled but tasteless, obviously no seasonings. The breading kept falling off the meat. The pasta that was served along as a side dish was the wrong kind of pasta.  It should have been spiral shaped or something similar to grab the sauce and not let it slide off.  The sauce was not very tasty. Just to mention that I am a food specialist, have an extensive background in cooking and food, so my comments should have some weight.

There aren't many restaurants that can get your tastebuds jumping before even stepping into the establishment. This restaurant does. What's so good about this place? Oh, JUST the homemade black squid ink pasta, the white and red sauces, and the fresh seafood which includes but is not limited to mussels, clams, calamari and lobster. So, pretty much everything. So what dish should you try? The Aglio Oglio is one of the signature dishes, as well as the Lobster Fra Diavolo for 2. These are both amazing, however,  you can choose any one of the dishes on the menu or ask to customize your own seafood combo in a red or white sauce. And don't forget to ask for the black squid ink pasta.  I personally live for red sauces, particularly garlic and/or fra diavolo style sauces. The red sauce here is to die for. You know they are preparing this delicious masterpiece when the aroma of oil and garlic hit the air and your mouth starts to water. Then the sound of the red sauce being poured in makes you want to two-step to the tune of the chef's sizzling concerto.  With loads of garlic goodness you can delicately taste in each bite, this delicious \\"fra diavolo\\" style is like Drake says, \\"da best I ever had\\". When I finish my meal the only thing left for me to do is to stand up and applaud the chef because my meal deserves nothing less than a standing ovation.

The tochos are a must have to start the meal off.  The tots were cooked perfectly and weren't over dressed with the toppings I chose.   The reason I went was to try out the Southern Comfort burger (a burger stuffed with bacon, mac and cheese).  I will come back to the burger momentarily.  With the dish you also choose a side dish to go with it.  The waiter recommended the fried Andouille  sausage and gouda grit cakes and let me tell you these were an unexpected surprise.  These were so delicious I would go back and just have a plate of these.  My burger however missed the mark big time.  The burger was missing the cheddar cheese (which may seem excessive with mac and cheese but would have helped it a lot) and was topped with some flaming lays potato chips (not on the menu description) which gave it some good flavor actually.I requested the BBQ sauce on the side so I could get the flavor of the burger without it being masked in the sauce and then apply it as I wanted.  The peach southern comfort BBQ sauce was very delicious and was needed due to my burger being overcooked and missing the cheese.   Besides the grit cakes and the Totchos the best part of the experience was the waitstaff.  They were very friendly and very helpful with recommendations along the way and we always had plenty to drink without having to ask.

It's like a little shack, but super homey and has all these dim lit lights that makes you feel cozy and at home. I came around 8:45 - 9 PM and waited for table for 45 minutes. It was enough time for me to walk to a convenience store to get water, which was 10 minutes away and walk back since they do notify you via text when your table is ready. I sat right by the bar and the bartender was able to give us all of his best recommendations. He suggested Cha Ca La Vong as his favorite dish, but being Vietnamese, I've already had this plenty of times so I wanted to try something I've never had before. If you've never had this before though, I recommend this dish too. - Papaya Pok Pok salad: normally served a little spicy, but since I can't handle spicy, I asked for no spicy and the waitress informed us it wouldn't be traditional that way. I said it was fine, but when I ate it, it really wasn't the same. Mistake on my end :(- Vietnamese fish saucee wings: sooooooooooo good. The portion for two people was good enough. I've never had chicken wings like this before. The flavor was so good and I could easily eat a plate alone with some alcohol. It's definitely good as bar food or appetizer. - Khanom Jiin Naam Yaa Kati: I've never had anything like this before. I ordered this because I can't really eat spicy and it was the only non-spicy that sounded different. It's vermicelli noodles in light coconut broth with fish balls, pineapple, basil, peanuts, and much more. It's served cold so it's super refreshing and light. It's perfect for a hot day.

I'm a pancake minimalist and I'm usually perfectly content to eat them with just a dusting a sugar, but these were almost inedible without a generous helping of chocolate chips.Maybe the whole DIY approach is just so that you can't blame them when your pancakes suck..."},{"name":"Flying Falafel & Po' Boys","address":"2001 Guadalupe St, Ste A1","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Trying to find truly tasty food in the vicinity of Guadalupe between 21st and MLK can be difficult.

Unfortunately, I did not try either of these here, but I'll be back to do just that.\\nWhile the portion sizes of the dishes we got were large, it would be a stretch to call them family-size portions. I'd say two people who like (the accompanied) steamed rice could share a dish if they weren't extremely hungry.\\nI went in the afternoon on a Monday. There were five or six tables and one waitress, who did a great job. If you're gonna try going here on Christmas, you may want to get there before they open to make sure you have a spot.I ordered the Three Treasures with Chinese Vegetables. Pros: The veggies were crunchy and colorful. There was a good balance of protein and vegetables. There were actual thin slices of garlic. The sauce was light, and did not overpower other flavors in the dish. I can only assume the shrimp and squid were previously frozen, yet they maintained texture well. If the scallops had been previously frozen, it made no difference in taste or texture. Cons: There were chunks of ginger in the dish, which was not a pleasant taste to come by every few bites. But these could easily be picked out. My partner got Braised Scallops with BBQ Pork. Pros: It had a nice amount of protein. The sauce had a good flavor, but... Cons: There was a lot of sauce, and it took over the dish. Everything in the dish tasted the same."},{"name":"Steel Toad Brewpub & Dining Hall","address":"97 E 2nd Avenue","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"Pub and restaurant owners seem to always feel that their new creation will become a new mecca.

There are plenty of restaurants I've loved that were located in strip malls. One thing that I know would help me as a long-time Vivo-goer is to bring in some plants to put around the entrance area. I know it's impossible to recapture the grandeur of the former patio, but a nod to that beautiful foliage would really help to mitigate the shell shock when you first pull in and realize you're in a strip mall. (Bringing back the gifted roses for ladies would help to make it feel like home, too.) We walked in, Buena Vista Social Club was playing, the counter full of pillar candles was glowing. It was a little weird to be able to see the whole room but not bad. Now, on to the food. I got the Emma's choice, with an avocado puffy taco and spinach/mushroom enchilada with a poblano cream sauce, and they were both fantastic. I'd never tried this enchilada at the old Vivo, and now I'm not sure why. It completely blew me away, especially the sauce. I'd heard from friends that the food toward the end at the old location and recently at the new location weren't quite up to snuff in quality, but everyone at our table last night was very happy with our meals and felt like Vivo was back. We had great service all night with no complaints from my vegan friends and family.

Self-parking is $18, valet $25. Spaces were hard to find and far from the lobby which meant a hot and sweaty post-parking trek in August. \\n-WIFI. I resent ever having to pay for WIFI, especially when it performs poorly.\\n-Tubes for lazy river had to be purchased and carried up and down to hotel room.Hotel service as a Marriott Elite member was excellent (don't be impressed, this status isn't difficult to attain but is highly recommended). A separate line for Elite members cut down on check-in time and I was offered free parking (normally $18 a day) for all 3 of the cars associated with the rooms I reserved. Much to my delight, the hotel lobby featured a Starbucks.  Unfortunately, the lines each morning were the longest I've ever seen at a Starbucks and I waited 30 minutes for my coffee (much needed).  Maybe a larger or second Starbucks is needed at such a large property?  The hotel's main areas were grandiose which, frankly, I enjoy in a property.  I want to be impressed with the place I am paying to vacation at and, at this property, I was impressed at every turn!  The room was very nice, with an upscale feel that is standard at the JW Marriott hotels. The bathroom was amazing- we are hoping to remodel our master bath soon and I took photos of the room's bathroom for reference if that says anything. I especially enjoyed that the bathroom had separate bath and shower (as my previously mentioned unremodeled master bathroom at home has only a shower and I am a major bath enthusiast). For whatever reason bath/shower combos in hotels weird me out and I would never take a bath in one. I just realized I wrote an entire paragraph about a hotel bathroom... moving on...The pools- in a word- incredible.  When looking for a spot for this particular vacation I specifically searched for a lazy river (at my son's request) so we knew what to expect.  That said, the pool area exceeded our expectations. The kids LOVED the lazy river, many pools, and hot tubs.  I barely saw them while we were outside.  We also had little ones with us and they enjoyed both the lazy river (with supervision) and the zero entry pool area.  My one complaint concerns the tubes required to fully enjoy the lazy river- I didn't mind paying for them ($7 each) but I did mind having to take them up and down to the room each day.  What a pain!  Surely the hotel can come up with a better option- maybe tube rentals?The resort also offered a number of fun activities for the kids.  In fact, the first day of our arrival there were (randomly) two LIVE penguins in the lobby. Um okay, but the kids did enjoy seeing them. The Shamu character from Sea World made an appearance, and the staff also made snow cones for the kids at one point in the afternoon.  The property also features a life-sized chess board, tether-ball, sand volleyball pit, foosball and ping pong tables, and an arcade (all activities but the arcade were free)."},{"name":"Cask'n Flagon","address":"62 Brookline Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Stopped into the Flagon today for an easy drink to relax before the holiday madness.

The cinnamon twists (kolache dough with cinnamon/sugar coating) are a fun highlight, and the cinnamon rolls,  sticky buns, and random other pastries are good too.

I ordered 25 wings, half (whatever proprietary name they use for hot), half Jamaican Jerk. I asked specifically if they could make the wings unbreaded, since judging by the pictures online of the bone-in wings, they use some kind of light breading. I was told that they can do that, no worries. It's about 15-20 minutes from the location to my house. When I got home, I discovered that they breaded my entire order. I tried gamely to eat some wings, but they were soggy and disgusting. After paying $30 for 25 wings, I wasn't just going to let it slide (plus I was really craving them and was disappointed), so I called them and explained what happened. After being told by two different people that they don't use breading, they use cornstarch (still a breading, guys!) to make the wings crunchy (I wish), they offered to give me a $5 credit on my account. That wasn't really going to cut it; it probably took $5 in gas to get there and back. After some back and forth, they said they'd give me a $15 credit, which doesn't really do me any good, since I'm not in any rush to order from here again. I acquiesced to the credit, and the manager asked me if my phone number was correct, said, \\"That's taken care of.\\" and then hung up on me without so much as an apology or a have a good evening or anything.

White sauce and spicy red to boot (it's spicy but not unbearably so - could be spicier).  Really enjoy this stuff (although once I get about 80% of the way through the meal, there's a bit of oiliness that hits me - although a beer would really cut through it and help out).  There are a couple of picnic benches that you can use if you're eating there. Although I've seen people in the winter time eat in their car as well.

Pairing it with lime juice really just brought out the flavors. The torta was tasty as well. It's basically a Mexican beef sandwich. REALLY good stuff here.

Pok Pok didn't disappoint one bit. Mainstream Thai restaurants tend to mass produce Thai food, much like take-out Chinese, but Pok Pok's fare was delicious, fresh, and flavorful. The restaurant used to be the chef's old house, and my table was located on the front porch (it was enclosed and had heat lamps), so the space is a little tight, but it has a lot of character. All the servers were not only prompt and friendly, but knowledgeable about every single item on the menu. We ordered about 6 dishes with my faves being the Vietnamese fish sauce wings, the papaya Pok Pok salad, and the Kaeng Hung Leh (sweet pork belly curry). The Vietnamese fish sauce wings were probably the best chicken wings that I've ever had - the perfect balance of crispy, meaty, salty, and sweet. The papaya salad was a good size serving with a nice spicness, and the sweet pork belly curry (it has tamarind, palm suger, and ginger) was the perfect accompaniment to the coconut rice. The drinks were a hit or miss. Misses were the salted plum vodka collins (too salty) and the tamarind whiskey sour (not a good combo). Hits were the Mango Alexander (like a mango/coconut daqiri) and the Khing and I (Thai version of a Moscow Mule)."},{"name":"Kabsah","address":"9436 S Orange Blossom Trl","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"All that needs to be said is yum!

I'm not shelling out that much money to try to match up what's on the menu with what's on my plate to identify it. The hot chocolate on the other hand was delectable. The second time, my girl friend - who is a bit of a perfectionist - found flaws in the preparation and presentation of each of our desserts, which were delicious but not incredibly memorable.

The Kaaeng Hang Leh was delicious- the pork was so well cooked, and not acidic as sometimes pork can get, and just melted in my mouth. I loved the rice served in the cute little wicker basket. The Khanom Jiin Sao was out of this world. I didn't eat the fish balls... but it was so comforting. The lemongrass was balanced so well with the ginger. Sometimes one or the other of those ingredients can overwhelm a dish. Not this! My boyfriend did order the special, it was fried halibut.

Amazingly satisfying and unusual. Not what I would imagine as being called a tart by any means, but delicious just the same. We also tried the ebi mayo, warm deep-fried shrimp bathed in a savory mayo over a bed of lettuce. Both delightful and calming. The 24oz draft beers for $5 were also quite enjoyable and beneficial in washing down the aforementioned tasty bits.Since Shigezo is new I am willing to overlook the next to awful service we received (or rather, did not receive) from the staff.

And if you need to feed a crew of people, they'll help you out by providing a whole tray of sandwiches plus dill pickles in individualized bags.They also have really great to-go coffee boxes that serve about 8 cups. They're great to get for morning meetings. They make everyone happy.Before going vegetarian, I had tried several of their lunch items including the Turkey Artichoke Panini (a hot sandwich with roasted red peppers, asiago cheese, pesto, and mayo on Ciabetta), the Grecian Turkey (feta, lettuce, tomato, red onion, cucumbers, and Caesar dressing on Focaccia), The Big Mamoo (Salami, ham, provolone, lettuce, tomatoes, and hot peppers), and Mama's Meatball Sub (served hot on a sub roll with Provolone). All were good, but the Turkey Artichoke was a bit too artichoke-y for my tastes.I also tried two of the soups. The first was the lobster bisque, which I did NOT like one bit. It was orange, smooth, and strange. The second soup, the Italian Wedding, was a huge improvement. It was very tasty with lots of yummy spinach leaves.Since going veg, I have tried one of their two vegetarian sandwiches (they have one hot and one cold). I had the cold Italian Village Veggie (red peppers, green peppers, lettuce, tomato, red onion, cucumber, vegetable cream, cheese, and chipotle mayo on sundried Parmesan bread). The cucumbers gave it a nice crunch and the mayo was delicious. But the cheese covered bread was what made it worth eating. That bread was so good.They have a smattering of cookies and brownies at the cash register, but thus far, I have been able to abstain.Spinelli's has always had all-day breakfast, and they recently extended their hours and added a dinner menu. You can order lunch any time of the day; you can stop in in the morning and grab a sacked lunch before heading to work. You can order from the dinner menu beginning at 11a. The new dinner menu items include flatbreads and penne pastas. The only vegetarian pasta option is penne with marinara sauce. Though I don't like oranges, the Orangeberry Bleu is very intriguing. It's dried cranberries, Mandarin oranges, caramelized onions, and bleu cheese all on traditional tomato sauce. It sounds similar to the Surly Girl Pizza that I so adore.The prices are low. The staff is friendly. The graphics are so funny; they feature one sandwich maker every so often, and the pictures are dead ringers. I've never had to wait long, but I eat lunch late at 2p, so I miss the crowd most anywhere I go. The tables are small and only seat 2-4, so don't expect to go there with more than that in tow. Another thing I like about Spinelli's is that it's a good place to sit and read. It's well lit, usually quite, and they have all the community papers there. They also have a small patio dining area for warm days."},{"name":"Pho Basil","address":"177 Massachusetts Ave, Ste A","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Not impressed.

This past Sunday, we both wanted to order canadian bacon [eggs benedict and meat option on breakfast meal], but were told the restaurant was out of canadian bacon.   My sister chose another option for the eggs benedict but didn't really care for it.  My eggs were fine; the english muffins were flat, literally, and the country potatoes had a slightly fishy taste to them.   Halfway through our brunch, the male employee behind the bar and another male employee, seated at a table w/customers across the room [and near us], began yelling back and forth at one another.  Yes, we were seated in the bar area of the restaurant, but Zed's is not a sports bar and I found the yelling to be rather incredulous, as did my sister.

Since this place is wildly popular I would recommend try going off hours such as having an early dinner since the wait can be from 20 minutes to almost 2 hours. If you're not going alone, I would highly suggest dropping off a person at the place to put a name down on the wait list and while the other goes find parking to save time. There's only street parking around that area. I would also look at the menu ahead of time while you're waiting for your table to save time and get your food faster once you're seated. Some of the tables and seating are both inside and out, so bring a jacket just in case as well.The main dish we got were the Fish Sauce chicken wings, since that what they're know for. Looks over fried. They were a slightly salty but has a touch of sweetness from the sugar glaze that was a good balance.Neua Naam Tok was very flavorful with the fish sauce, lime and chili mixture. However we found the dish to be extremely salty and couldn't finish the dish because of that.Lastly, we got Khao Soi Kai. Favorite out the three. The noodles weren't very chewy which was great. Even though it's a one dish meal, it was the perfect amount for two people that wants to try a little of everything on the menu.The food was great especially if you want to try the non-typical Thai dishes that is abundant everywhere (pad thai, tom yum, etc.) But we felt that  majority of the dishes we got were extremely salty."},{"name":"Aloha Asian Bistro & Sushi","address":"550 Piedmont Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"Located nearby workplace so this place us easily walkable.\\nHowever the food is 2 to 3 stars out of 5\\nWhich I can tolerate during a short lunch hour!\\nHOWEVER THE FRONT STAFF TALL THIN WOMAN WITH BLACK HAIR AND THIN EYEBROWS HAS NO PERSONALITY....JUST A FLAT AFFECT!\\nThey overall are not courteous and when you say \\"Thank you \\" you are not given a welcome...or a smile or even a simple head nod!

As we didn't have a reservation, we made sure to get there early (5pm), which was a good thing, because apparently all the tables were reserved except the one we were shown to -- a 2-top squeezed into the corner between the fountain, dessert case, and meat/cheese counter. Complimentary bread & olive oil were served immediately along with a bottle of tap water. We decided to order a couple of starters (Insalata Bresaola & Mushroom Bruschetta). It took a while for these to be served (at least 20 minutes) but it was worth the wait, especially the bruschetta which consisted of 3 thick slices of browned bread cut diagonally (into 6 total pieces) and loaded with freshly chopped & roasted mushrooms. We ended up bringing 2 pieces home. I ordered the rabbit special and my boyfriend had La Burina, a pasta dish made with rigatoni, ground pork, peas & mushrooms. The flavors worked well together and the overall portion was large, but the amount of pasta dwarfed the small serving of meat & veggies. The rabbit was roasted and I got two quarters consisting of the legs & thighs. It was served in a very herby sauce (maybe a bit too much rosemary?) along with some sliced yellow squash, a couple of asparagus spears, & 3 button mushrooms. The main problem I had with this dish was the rabbit itself because it had not been deboned. Thus eating it was very labor intensive and trying to avoid the tiny bones was impossible. I definitely cannot recommend this entree.\\nMy only complaint about the service involves the girl who refilled our water and bread basket (very attentive; never had to ask for anything) and who also delivered our food (though she was not our waitress). When it was time for our starters to be served, she came by the table and said \\"your dishes are on the way out\\" and then cleared our bread plates. However our food did not show up for at least another 10 minutes. Ditto for our entrees. She came by as we were still enjoying our appetizers and told us the entrees were coming out, kind of rushing us along to finish so she could clear our plates. But our entrees weren't served for at least another 10 minutes so we sat there with an empty table when we could have been more leisurely enjoying our appetizers.\\nDespite these minor issues, I still give Piazza Italia 4 stars for its authentic Italian food and eager to please staff who seem to really love what they're doing and greet repeat customers warmly. Even the older gentleman (possibly the owner?) pitched in to help and serenaded a woman at the table next to ours with a short Italian melody.\\nNice, relaxed atmosphere, good food, attentive service and moderate prices mean we'll probably come here again when we're craving Italian."},{"name":"Shigezo Izakaya","address":"910 SW Salmon St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Yes on this place for happy hour!!!

The eggs Benedict and omelettes around the table also received good reviews. Our service was a little clunky, not for lack of concern or effort.

I took my GF to KRS tonight to check out what I believed to be an incredible steakhouse, based on what I read online. Seems the people who called it one of the \\"best steakhouses in the USA\\" have not been there this year.. When we arrived, I told my waiter this was our maiden voyage with KRS, and asked him what the \\"dry aged steak for 2\\" was.. he stated that it was porterhouse, and that it was their specialty.. I told him I was not fond of New York Strip due to its \\"fibrous\\" nature..kinda like sirloin... I like filet or ribeye, I told him, but I've had a porterhouse at Peter Luger in Brooklyn that was to die for.... He told me dry aging should take care of any muscle fiber and it was really what he recommended if I was open to suggestions... so I decided to go with the \\"dry aged steak for 2\\" instead of the ribeye tasting trio for me, and a small filet for the lady.. Bad choice.... When the steak was served, the food runner pulled a piece from the strip side in the center to ask if the temp was OK with us.. it looked red in the dimly lit atmosphere, so we said it looked fine.. I wish he would have used a flashlight, because our \\"medium rare\\" steak was medium in the middle and medium well around the edges.. The filet part was no more than 3/4 inch thick at best and more overcooked than the strip side.. it tasted like liver which is a sure sign of overcooking.. The strip was flavorful enough that along with my hunger it overrode my desire to send the steak back and wait.. I figured if the waiter asked me, I would be honest... well, he never asked how the steak was he only asked if my idea of strip had changed, which it had not I told him.. still too chewy and fibrous for me... My overall feeling was that I had been knowingly steered toward their highest profit item, rather than listening to me and giving me what my communicated taste profile would indicate. This $75 (laugh) steak was a $35 steak at best.. complete with bitter char around the edges.. this thing must have sat in direct grease flames for a while.. The scalloped sweet potatoes were awesome... The King Crab appetizer flawless.. bread basket was a fail.. I just got back from Manhattan 2 days ago and had a $55 12 oz filet from Quality Meats in Midtown that shredded Kevin Rathbun Steak.. Do not order \\"steak for 2, or steak for 3\\" is my advice... its the house hustle for profit.. I would never go back for that steak again.. I may give this place another chance one time to try another steak since everyone seems to get all excited over KRS, but I just did not get the hype this time.. Mediocre service and mediocre steak is my verdict..

This place was hands-down a fantabulous Thai experience.  Had been here once before as a +1 for the Yelp event a few months ago, and decided to come back with a few girlfriends to use my Groupon.  I am happy to report that it was as scrumptious and fun as I remembered.Soi9 is nestled in kind of a weird space off Burnside and 18th, near PGE Park.  Parking can be a bit of a pain, but not too bad if you park a little further away and walk.  The interior is modern and comfortable, the booths had pillows and the bright, fun pops of color in the decor set a nice ambiance. We started off with some fruity cocktails (all very good and tasted fresh), and some rice croquettes for appetizers.  Those were fried to golden perfection and tasted great.  Then we ordered Crab Fried Rice, Pad Thai, and Green Curry for dinner.Between three hungry girls who live to eat, three dinner entrees provided plenty of food, with a lot to take home.  They were all delicious!  Tasty, a good amount of sauce, with a nice kick-in-the-pants spice level.  The Green Curry was delicious over white rice, and had a lingering, sweet heat that was perfect.  There was no skimping on the crab in the fried rice, which was a pleasant surprise.  The pad thai is good, but honestly nothing to write home about, especially in comparison to the other two stellar dishes.

We ordered the tuna ceviche and while I thought it was fresh and was good with the strong taste of lime, I've had better ceviche homemade.

Their meat was cooked decently: the chicken could have been moister but, compared to most fast-food attempts at chicken, it was a victor. Their barbacoa was appropriately moist and juicy, too.In the flavor department, Torchy's seems to eschew spices in favor of a classically gringo-Texan layering of fat-upon-fat. Where barbacoa along the Rio Grande is seasoned to high heaven with spices, Torchy's barbacoa is salty but otherwise nondescript. Piling an avocado on top of the barbacoa was a nice, albeit unnecessary, way to amp up the richness, but it hardly made the flavor punchier.Torchy's jerk chicken taco is far more assertive and self-respecting than their barbacoa. The jerk sauce had plenty of good character and their mango chunks were extremely fresh. The addition of sour cream was gratuitous but, across their menu, Torchy's leans towards using more ingredients rather than appropriate ingredients.Their prices are kind of silly but, given that their tacos are huge and piled with stuff they don't need, the cost might be fair.If you're into real taquerias Torchy's will leave you underwhelmed but not displeased.

Don't go here & then plan on kissing people later - you will leave reeking of garlic, & it's amazing. First off, go early or right when it opens. We went at 520pm on a chilly Sunday evening & ended up waiting an hour, however there were 3 large parties in front of us, 1 waiting & 2 were in beginning part of their meal, so I think we just got unlucky because people later on in the evening were seated quickly after us! Regardless, just something to keep in mind. We finally got seated & were thoroughly impressed with the setup & its efficiency. 1 chef, 1 waitress & 1 bus/dish cleaner. Whole menu on the chalk board, drinks from plastic cups, dishes served directly in the pans they are cooked in, & cash only in a space of no more than 400 sq ft, if even. We ordered calamari, little neck clams (scampi style), aglio olio (black squid ink pasta served in garlic & olive oil), and clams/shrimp linguine. Calamari: Amazing, easily the best calamari I've ever had! I would go back just to eat plates of this. It was fried perfectly & the calamari was so fresh the texture of it was perfect. Little Neck Clams: Garlic, butter, lemon & wine make everything great. The clams were so fresh & delicious & amazing paired with this. Bread for dipping after to soak up the sauce was perfect! Aglio Olio: AMAZING. I've never had a dish like it before - the garlic & olive oil make it so rich and creamy. The squid ink pasta is chewy yet has a great bite to eat. Entree portion was big & I couldn't finish it after eating appetizers! Linguine: Really yummy as well. Seafood was super fresh & sauce was amazing. Only downside was the pasta in this dish isn't handmade like the aglio olio!The entire time we had our meal I watched the chef cook, which as a major foodie & lover of cooking was so fun to watch. The chef was amazing & the way he prepped every meal for the restaurant was so cool to watch. All in all our meal came out to $145 with tip, which is not bad for 3 people.

It definitely needed more flavor, it was a bit bland for me. I had the chicken ramen and my friend had the veggie ramen, and both of us agreed that it needed more of something. And the Yelp name and the napkins/bowls say one thing, but the sign outside says another. What is this place really called?! Definitely suggest that they get that all situated."},{"name":"Prairie Fire","address":"242 Harvard St","city":"Brookline","stars":"4","text":"This is a great new neighborhood restaurant, classy but comfortable and cozy, filled with the sweet smell of the wood-fired oven which touches most of the items on the menu- which makes it an ideal setting for a winter's dinner.They have a compact menu with familiar food (pasta, pizza, meatballs, chicken) but a touch more upscale, so it'll work well for both the picky eaters and the more foodie among us. I do wish the menu was a bit more diverse- for example, I already have my favorite local pizza places (Stoked, Otto), and there are a lot of places to get a good bowl of pasta-, but look forward to seeing how the menu evolves and changes over time. There's a lot of potential with that wood-fired oven, and I'd love to see more diversity with items like whole-roasted fish and smoked pork chops (drool...).But what they do have, they execute very well. My smoked spaghetti with (whole!) littlenecks and guanciale was excellent, and was just the right portion size. Our side of charred market greens topped with sunflower seeds hit the spot (minus the large chunk of butter? cream? that hadn't quite melted/incorporated). And the husband's chicken dish was near-perfect: two large flat pieces of juicy, flavorful meat surrounded with crispy skin, atop potatoes and crusty bread swimming in some damn fine jus. All it needed was some sort of veg included, and it would have been a perfect plate. Despite the large bar and comfortable vibe, this sadly isn't really a place to come for just a drink- the drink list seems more geared towards complimenting the food rather than the other way around, with a tiny/traditional cocktail menu, a good-sized wine selection, and a well-curated and interesting/solid beer list. Still, they have some solid choices, including a few Trilliums and a Stillwater Artisanal sour on tap (both excellent!). Good service, nice atmosphere, excellent food, nice beer and wine list- overall a great new spot for the area."},{"name":"La Cantina de San Angel","address":"Walt Disney World, 1510 North Avenue of the Stars","city":"Orlando","stars":"3","text":"The food here is utterly terrible!

They did a great job on the place.  Beautiful room, really nice decor without being pretentious or snobby.  Handmade oyster shell walls were a nice touch.  Service was great, though a bit overkill.  You have multiple people helping you which is great, but a bit overbearing.  Food was mixed.. the fried oyster appetizer was incredible!, salads were ok, and my sturgeon main course was a bit disappointing.  I really think it was just opening night kinks as the attention to detail is so strong everywhere else, that I doubt they would skimp on food prep. A great beer selection, great space, and an intriguing, though kind of difficult to read menu will get me back for another round.

If you find yourself in need of sustenance, not to worry, they've thought of that too: the main floor cafe has lots of tasty snacks and drinks to pick from. There is WIFI too but I found it a bit slow. The staff is usually very helpful and seem genuinely happy to see you. They know their product and many are good at making recommendations for related topics/writers/interests. They host a variety of events: book readings, book buying events, book groups and special engagements where prominent guests discuss important topics that effect contemporary culture.

My issue is that I feel the hype of this restaurant holds more weight than the quality of the food.  The service is a Portland standard...slow and annoyed. My biggest issue is the name of the restaurant. I f-ing love papaya salad. Their Pok Pok leaves so much to be desired. All three times I have visited this place have let me down on this front.

My friends told me the coffee was good, but her first round was  cold. But easy fix on that. The prices are a bit high for portion size.

I couldn't imagine eating anything from there due to that god awful smell.

If I never went there again, I'd be totally alright!! However, I will say the service was excellent the bartender was very sweet and actually looked like she had gotten some sleep and a shower (not like the other bartenders they had on).

The chicken Marsala was delicious on a bed of spaghetti. The sunset and views over the pier and marina were breathtaking. This is my new go to restaurant in Hull.

It is there flagship crown jewel brand and really is a very different experience than staying at any of their other hotels.  I spent the past few days here initially for business then I extended for fun.  It's connected to the Ritz Carlton which I've also stayed in previous visits for business and JW need not feel any insecurity because it almost stacks up as well as the adjoining Ritz.  You can feel the serenity hit you upon entering the truly grand lobby.  The ceilings seem like they are a hundred feet above you.  The center of the lobby has a beautiful fountain surrounded by tall columns and a minimal furniture, which only adds to the grandness of the entry way.  The marble floors are perfectly polished and there was no wait at check in.  I was greeted quickly with a big smile by a nice gal who checked me in quickly as I was running late for my first meeting.  The one thing that was kind of odd was that I asked her to just have a bellman run my suitcase upstairs to the room and she said she didn't have one there, but could leave my luggage as the desk.  This was one of the few disappointing moments of the visit.  I know if I was at the ritz and they didn't have someone they would run it up themselves.  No big deal I was already 15 minutes late, what's another 5 to run the carry on upstairs.  The room itself was beautiful and big. It was on the 25th floor with a great view of the world class hotel golf course.  The closet was relatively big. The bathroom had a seperated shower stall from the tub (which I really appreciate).  The bed was super comfy and there was room for an additional couch and chairs for lounging.  The plasma was new and overall the room seemed really clean.  Some other standouts is this is a really family friendly hotel offering diversions for both the grown ups and kids.  It has a huge pool with a lazy river (bonus).  There are lots of plasmas and a pool bar.  They also have from what I hear one of the best golf courses in Florida (I can't confim that yet, but will bring the clubs next time).  The hotel bar is huge and there is plenty of outdoor seating to smoke one of the premium cigars they offer at the bar.  The gym is for both the guests at ritz and jw and is much bigger than most hotel gyms I visit.  I started each of my evenings at the hotel bar.  It's relatively empty early on, but picks up after 7 pm.  The bartenders were great.  I especially enjoyed chatting to Ricardo and Edwin.  I stuck mostly to Guiness, but did have an occassional cocktail which were all appropriately stiff.  Overall, this is a very good hotel.  It's more of a convention hotel, so keep in mind you'll probably see lots of folks with nametags.  The only other minor issue I'd say is that I noticed they charge $25 for valet. I didn't drive, but if I did I would be annoyed by this charge.  I understand substantial valet costs in major cities, but not this place.  There is plenty of room for parking and it's a good 20 minutes from downtown Orlando."},{"name":"Olympia Pizza","address":"3205 Broadway W","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"DELICIOUS!!!!!!!!I highly recommend this place, service is quick and the atmosphere is romantic and quiet.\\nBeen there 4 times no and have ordered different things on their menu.

The garlic tonkotsu broth sat somewhere between bland and flavorful, it was a little disappointing. I opted to upgrade the pork to pork belly which was unfortunate because their belly slices are more like bacon than the more traditional thick chunks. The pork belly also did not melt in my mouth either which might just mean the broth wasn't hot enough.  I'm not an expert on ramen by any means but I know I've had better within a few miles of here. That said if I had never had good ramen before now then I'd probably think this was quite tasty. Honestly, for a lunch time craving this option isn't a horrible idea because they are big enough to pump out a high volume of dishes fairly quickly. I might come here again for lunch.I also ordered chicken karaage, which ended up being my favorite part of the meal.

Now that I experienced the place I see first hand that most people are quick to say negative things over positive ones. My friend was in town from Calgary and I wanted to show him something different, so I decided this place was the right place for his first middle eastern experience. Staff is amazing, food was awesome and we happened to come on a Friday that had salsa which was great fun... So much fun that we came back the next night for Arabic night that had a band and a belly dancer. This has become my go to place on weekends, much better than going to nightclubs. In total I now have been here five times, each time trying something different off their menu, my faves so far are the hummus, tabbouleh salad, Iraqi kibbeh, prawn appetizer, lamb makloubeh and the fried fish. In the five times I've been there I've seen half of the same customers over and over, just like me they seem to be sick of the clubs and prefer the laid back fun here. Just like vancouver is multicultural so is their staff, and I really like that as its nice that the owner is embracing their community around them vs only wanting only their own, makes my friends and I feel more welcome too as it's their way of saying that they welcome everyone! My only complaint would be that there isn't more of an extensive wine menu, but I guess this isn't a fine French restaurant. Food is reasonably priced but do bring your appetite, drinks are priced on par with other places, and anyone who complains about having to spend the minimum charge ($25)  needs a reality check, how can you complain about such a small amount vs what you're getting, after all they don't charge you cover to watch the band and belly dancer and they must make money sone how to pay for all of that. Years ago I used to go to Mona's, their minimum charge was $40, which was still reasonable since that's what you'd spend on food and drinks at just a normal restaurant... But they have since closed down, I'm guessing largely in part thanks to cheap people and partly because they just got old (I stopped going often to that place because parking became a huge issue once they redid the street prior to the Olympics and I was too lazy to walk long distances).There are three types of diners, ones who eat out frequently and are more laid back about things, the other ones who barely ever go out and when they do they act like its a big deal and they are so \\"refined\\" to be able to judge and then the other group that may go out not as often but make the best of it because who has time to be negative, they are just happy to be out.

The Pumpkin Pie Stuffed French Toast was soft and gloriously gooey, but the toast obscured the more subtle spices of the pie. The Blueberry Lemon Stuffed French Toast, on the other hand was sweeter than I'm usually comfortable with due to the use of lemon curd instead of fresh lemon, but Caf√© Luna really made it work. There's tons of different stuffings to choose from, and you have the option of getting two half-portions for the price of one. Now THAT is a holiday for the indecisive!The Omelet with goat cheese, sweet potato, and caramelized onion was a fabulous combination of ingredients that can't possibly go wrong. t I just wish all the ingredients had been distributed evenly throughout the omelet - those three things were absolutely explosive when combined.

The restaurant kindly split the entr√©e for us on separate plates, resulting in a portion that I'd call a \\"wedding entr√©e.\\" It was definitely enough for us after the tartare and oysters. Every bite was amazingly buttery and the gnocchi had a nice char. We passed on dessert because we were full at this point, but they brought us complimentary brownie bites topped with a passion fruit glaze. I'm not a chocolate person, but my husband thought they were great."},{"name":"Commonwealth Restaurant and Market","address":"11 Broad Canal Way","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"Fantastic sandwiches.

This was recommended to me by friends and people I met in the airport! My friends and I (party of 6) went for Friday dinner. We arrived around 7pm and was told 45 min wait. We didn't mind since there were a lot of shops to walk around too and Salt & Straw was a few blocks down. We ended up only waiting 15 min which was a super plus! We ate in the outside seating. The ambiance of the place is very thai country traditional feel. It was really cool cause it didn't feel like I was in America. The place has a very strong stench due to the fish sauce they put in the wings. I didn't mind it but not sure if other people are sensitive to that. Also, FYI, this is not your typical thai restaurant where they serve pad thai or pad see eww. I was surprised because I did not expect that as people only told me to try their wings. Menu has a wide variety of thai dishes from different parts of Thailand. A few of my friends had some trouble ordering to the fact that it had lots of ingredients they never heard of. I suggest to keep an open mind. Our party ended up sharing 2 plates of their infamous wings (6 pieces each plate). They were delicious. It had a lot of flavor and you can definitely taste the fish sauce in the wings. It was a bit on the saltier side which is not surprising as their main marination is fish sauce. I recommend eating it with some rice. My other friends who don't really eat thai food loved it. They wished that we had just ordered all wings and rice as the entire dinner. For my entree, I ordered the Kaeng Hang Leh (Northern Thai sweet pork belly and pork shoulder curry with ginger, palm sugar, turmeric, tamarind, Burmese curry powder and pickled garlic) with a side of rice (extra $2.50). I really liked this dish. There was probably 5 good cuts of pork that melts in your mouth. Highly suggest ordering it with rice or it won't be as good. It reminded me of something similar to what my grandparents make. Overall, I had a good experience and my friends loved the food. Definitely try this place if you are in Portland. Its an extra plus that it is located in an area where there are many places to walk around while you wait. Service was good but one issue was the guy mixed my friend's food together in a to go box.

In years past, the staff would toss the dough repeatedly to get it that thin, and nowadays they run it through a mechanical roller to get it just right. It's thin and crispy. There aren't too many high-falutin' options when it comes to toppings. They keep it real with the tried and true stuff. Ask for double-cheese, since the default is pretty light. And if you're in-the-know, which you are as of now, ask for the pizza to be Shenk'ed (prounounced \\"shanked\\") and they will bake the pizza a little bit longer, giving you a little bit of char on the bottom, really crisping up the crust and making the pepperoni a little more crispy as well.

It would be nice to put it at '3+' since overall  the food for the most part was good, and the 5 other adults I was with basically liked it and my youngest daughter did as well. One thing that strikes me really odd about this place is that overall all mixed feeling I get from there. Its  like the place does not know wither to be more of a fast food take out place or a simi formal restraunt with club atmosphere.  The outside resembles more like you want to pick up a roast beef and large fry to go at 1:00 AM, as the parking lot co-exist with the 7-11 gas station and the sign in front looks like it was made for a generic strip mall in a rural community.However inside had basically a nicer ambiance but them you had to mix in some chairs that again looked liked they came from 'Nicks Pizza' or something.  The spanakopita was really good and as a general appetizer the table really liked it.\\n \\nI had gyro and to quote another review on this \\"not the tastiest gyro meat I've had.\\nHowever, the tzatziki sauce was super thick & creamy\\" I have could have not said it better. I hear the desserts are good but none of us partook on it, according to my dinning friends who have in the past.The wait staff where pretty courteous and accommodating, no issue there at all, the waiter was pretty engaging to my daughter so kudos there.

I would DEFINITELY not recommend this for a special occasion, and given the abundance of great seafood restaurants in Boston, I don't think I'd recommend this place to anyone at all.I made a reservation for my grad dinner via phone at the end of May. I was only able to choose between 5:30 and 8:30 (book early for grad season, folks!), and knowing that my ceremony wouldn't end until 4, and I needed to pack all of my things up, I went with 8:30. Immediately after the call, I wrote down the time in my Google Calendar.We decided to valet park instead of fussing around looking for parking, and it was $20 (without tip), which I thought was completely absurd. Maybe I'm spoiled, but honestly, I'm accustomed to complementary valet parking when I go to a $$$+ restaurant. That was a minor annoyance, but things got much worse when we stepped in.I got to the front desk at 8:30 and was told my reservation had been at 5:30. What? I insisted that I had chosen 8:30, and she said she could seat us at the bar. Uh... no. So instead she asked us to wait at the hotel bar, and I told her that we really didn't want to eat or drink, so wouldn't that be a little awkward? But she said that no, it was totally fine, it was just a place for us to wait comfortably. So she had another girl take us there, and once we got to the bar, we were seated, and a server began putting down menus. We told the server we wouldn't be needing anything, and the server was essentially like, \\"Oh. This is a restaurant, and these seats are for our customers. Would you like me to escort you elsewhere?\\" So we awkwardly had to migrate AGAIN to another lobby on a different floor, and when we were finally called back to the restaurant, they tried to seat us at a high top table even though there were PLENTY of empty tables at the time. At this point, I was SO FRUSTRATED that I was not willing to budge, pointing out the empty table and the fact that it had been *their fault* for booking me at the wrong time. 10 minutes later, we were finally seated--and at a very nice table, in fact--to start our meal at 9:15.The food was pretty good: our favorites were the Island Creek oysters, the clam chowder, the lobster roe noodles, and the lobster roll. But service was slow, and our server (though really kind) actually forgot the oysters (though he did ultimately bring them out and comp us for them).At the end of the day, I think there are many seafood restaurants of comparable/better quality in the Boston area, and it's just not worth your time to eat here given their subpar customer service.

First, upon arriving for what was mean to be a celebratory meal, I realized that they had not a single bottle of Champagne in the house.  I ended up ordering a bottle of sparkling wine that was mediocre at best.  Looking further in to the wine list I was shocked by the lack of depth and choices there.  It was then I noticed that the place was pretty much bereft of wine anywhere:  The wine display and wine storage was all EMPTY.  Not a good sign...I managed to find a bottle of WA red to go along with the meal that was pretty tasty, but there were not many things to choose from.  To me, wine is as important to a good meal as the food, service and atmosphere.  This situation knocked a star off right way.  From there we moved in to the meal, or should I say the waiting.  We had been seated right away (reservation made 48 hours ahead), but then we sat there unattended for quite some time.Looking at the menu, we all immediately realized there was just one salad option - and then the waiter told us they were sold out.  No wonder - you only have one salad, EVERYONE is going to order it.  This seems amazingly amateurish and showed me that there was not a lot of concern for me, the diner.From there we ordered our mains - the food was pretty good, but not amazing, the service was painfully average - even if the server was 'nice'.  We spent $200 for four people and left feeling like we had a meal that was more of a test of endurance than a calm, enjoyable respite from the crazy life we lead.  Bummer.  Never again, although from the lack of raw materials, wine, etc. it looks to me like Fife might be struggling to survive anyway...."},{"name":"Papa Gino's Pizzeria","address":"Bunker Hill Mall, 19 Austin Street","city":"Charlestown","stars":"2.5","text":"Food is average papa gino's.

What more could you want?  As it turns out - a lot. Our server was likely new and inexperienced. His recommendations on the menu were all at the highest price of the section, and he didn't give any constructive criticism, only trying to up sell us on everything. We only received half the quantity of sake we ordered until complaining, and even then we did the math and didn't get the full 720 ml (it was clear when we asked for the whole bottle in our second order). And then they forgot some of our appetizers until prompted. When the entrees came, they screwed a few things up, and rather than fall on the sword, our waiter argued with us instead. When he spoke with the manager he was unmoved, and didn't even seem to care when we left without leaving a tip - he was too concerned with hitting on a girl sitting at the bar.

The waffles are made with cornmeal which I'm not a fan off, the bacon gravy was super thick and tasted like Pure flour, and the chicken (breast) was a bit over cooked for my likings.

Their paninis are quite possibly the best I've ever had, ever.We thought we had found a place with really good paninis in Cambridge. I'm often known to be wrong, and I hate being wrong. So in order to redeem myself, and be correct, let me just say that everything about this panini is perfect.The bread on the outside seems to be slightly toasted with some olive oil first, and then all of the sandwich fillings go on and it gets pressed. There is a method to the madness, and it all involves subtleties that when combined make an infallible panini.Let me further explain these \\"subtleties\\", they are actually really important. The focaccia bread was perfectly chewy on the inside, and perfectly crispy on the outside. There is a very small layer of crispiness on the outside, and the rest of the bread just a joy to chew.Since we got a \\"proper\\" panini, the inside was perfectly well done. Most notable, this thick amazing slice of provolone was super gooey and melted. It was a great contrast in texture compared to the crispy-chewy bread, and the tender chicken.I don't quite remember the chicken, it was fresh, cooked to perfection, and sliced thin. Not remembering the flavor profile is really not a bad thing, because I was a little bit overwhelmed by the amazing homemade pesto sauce. Perfect blend of spices to pair up with the chicken. Chicken is never really flavorful by itself anyways, so the pesto made the sandwich a little bit more special than it already was. All this, and a side of chips for $9+tax (I'm serious about the side of chips).Part 2: (Coffee stuff): They have a really friendly barista, Nate, who knows everything a coffee noob like me would like to know. They make some pretty good iced lattes. However, the one thing I'm looking forward to is their eggs benedict for brunch. Sunday is my fiancee's birthday, and I trust Teri enough to make to bring my fiancee over here for brunch.Part 3 (Sunday Brunch): My fiancee's birthday was today. I felt like I should treat her out to a special brunch. So I brought here over here. While we do have a place that we like to go to for a super cheap brunch, I wanted to make her special. Besides, we already know the the quality of everything here is superb.I've heard so much of their eggs benedict that my sight was set on one thing, and one thing only. Since I don't eat pork, and I'm not a fan of lobster, I got the corned beef hash eggs benedict. This is by far, the best corned beef hash I have ever had. The seasoning was perfect, and the texture was also extremely amazing. It wasn't 100% ground beef, but rather, shredded beef steak. Perfection. On top of the hash was a perfectly poached egg. It looked amazing, and tasted amazing. The hollandaise sauce was also an exceptional addition to the whole thing. Everything by itself could have been divine, but when they all combined together, the effect was exponential. My fiancee got a spicy chicken chorizo with scrambled egg whites as a substitute. The chorizo had this decadent texture that perfectly complemented the spicy level. She also got a ridiculous amount of homefries, I just happened to have finished the homefries a few moments ago. Usually, I get excited by homefries, because it always sounds good. However, these homefries were in another universe. I'm not even sure if this is real life and I'm on Earth. It just doesn't make sense how good the homefries are. They are a little spicy, but I appreciate that sort of flavor.Unfortunately, I had no room for dessert during this brunch since we got a side order of jalapeno cheese sauce covered homefries. I thought the sauce was pretty good, and so were the homefries, but it wasn't that much for $6. I think this is mostly just a side effect of how much I loved the homefries.One thing that needs to be said is how accomodating this place is. First, they can pretty much create anything you want, though you probably don't want to do that since their culinary expertise is straight up amazing. Second, they will even change your reservation 30 minutes before you were supposed to show up to a whole 3 hours later.All in all, if you have friends, family, or special people in town, and you want to impress them. Bring them here."},{"name":"Ceviche Tapas Bar & Restaurant","address":"125 W Church St","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Had the mahi mahi al patel which is mahi brazed in parchment paper with a saffron sauce peppers and mushrooms.

It was awesome. I am  definitely adding it to my list of regulars. Only 12.95. This trip to Ceviche was good but they are so inconsistent with food timing. Sometimes they are out in minutes. Other nights you sit around for a half hour wondering what happened.The red sangria is also a little inconsistent. It depends on whether you get a pitcher or a glass and who makes it. Sometimes they hit is a little to hard with the brandy. My go to order here is the potatas bravas, a morrillo (I believe that is how it is spelled) which is a lamb shank that falls of the bone at the slightest touch of a fork $15, and a felitito which is sliced tenderloin over a crunchy baguette slice, onions, red peppers, and blue cheese crumbles.

However, they look like they are getting things done quickly.

My friend ordered the chicken shawarma and I ordered the lamb&beef shawarma. It was nice of them to bring the food to us at our table. We both thought they tasted fine; the flavors were on point. But for the price we paid, there really was not a lot of meat in the shawarma, in fact it was pretty flat and mostly pita which is disappointing. Like another reviewer said, the lamb&beef combo did have enough gristle within it to make me a little disappointed. All this means that they can move up from here...add more meat and cut off the gristle from the lamb&beef before putting it in the pita! I will definitely be going back for my shawarma fix.

For appetizers, our table had the carpaccio, asparagus and prosciutto, and Georgia shrimp. All were outstanding. I will concede though that the remoulade sauce that was served with the shrimp was a little heavy. I would have preferred a lighter portion of the sauce. We ordered one of their house specialities for the entree, a porterhouse for 3. The beef was perfectly cooked, medium rare. They serve it on the bone and slice it french style and serve everyone at the table. If you choose you can have fresh aus-jus taken from the meet and drizzled on your plate. The sides were a nice break from the traditional \\"power sides\\" at most steakhouses. Each was well portioned and still enough to share. No matter what else you order, make sure at least one person at the table orders the mac and cheese!!! If I had to say that anything was less than perfect it would probably be the atmosphere.

My brother-in-law SWEARS by this place, claiming he eats here at least once a week, sometimes more often.  Apparently I ordered all kinds of the wrong food.  Details:Wing Stop is in Eastport Plaza off 82nd.  I get no small amount of serious nostalgic sense when I'm over here, as I spent a lot of time over on the east side in my youth (grew up in Oregon City).  For me, 82nd is kinda... \\"the more things change, the more they stay the same\\".  I can't help but feel a slight sense of dread and depression whenever I'm on 82nd.  Endless car lots intermingled with fast food and dive bars.  I'm being a bit critical here, but it's my review.  Also, I just wrote a review of 82nd Ave.It's counter service at Wing Stop, and the menu is well laid out and easy to navigate (it's on a reader board behind the counter).  It's a small joint, with the counter slightly to the right as you enter and all the tables to the left of the entrance.  There are maybe... a dozen tables?  The place was clean and organized.I ordered the 10 wing boneless combo with fries.  5 wings with their original hot sauce and 5 with BBQ sauce.  It's important to note at this point that an entire star of this review is for the beer: $2 pints.  I was fairly speechless when dude taking my order made this claim.  I said... \\"All day, every day?!\\" to which he replied \\"Yep.\\"  SCORE?!  I still can't believe it.  FWIW, \\"pint\\" at Wing Stop translates to \\"12 ounce plastic solo cup\\" but when it's Ninkasi Total Domination... who's counting, right?  A true Imperial pint it's not, but stop being picky, you jerk.Jeez I'm getting off track easily here.  Okay, so the wings were alright.  Definitely better than Buffalo Wild Wings' version of boneless.

Luckily I'd stopped at the ATM before this little jaunt, so I was prepared, but it's harsh reality if you're like me and 9 times out of 10 rely on debit cards/credit cards. I stepped up and went for the Grilled Chicken Super Burrito (no guac, everything else). No problem, except hey, roughly $8 for a burrito and root beer? Lame. Anyway, I get my hunka burrito with ONE napkin, as I come to find out as I'm opening up the paper bag. By this point my burrito is half-unwrapped and I'm way too paranoid to get up and leave both food and purse unattended, so stupidly I tried to make do with the one. Seriously, though, burrito-makers. Don't you realize how messy your product is, and that sloppy people such as myself loooooove burritos? More napkins, plz!The burrito itself was...OK. I definitely finished it, but the chicken was a little dry and unseasoned for my liking and the salsa wasn't as flavorful compared to other places (yes, even Qdoba).

A friend and I were visiting Austin and came here on the recommendation of a hotel staffer, and we were so glad we did!  Brunch starts at 10, but we didn't realize this and showed up at 9:40, which was lucky because we were able to get a seat right at 10 and got our first plate from the buffet before it got crowded.  I would definitely recommend going early, since the lines at the buffet got long and there was a crowd waiting outside by the time we left.  The food was delicious.  Easily the best brunch buffet I've had.  Everything was good southern food with a twist.  We had green chile grits, jalapeno sausage, pesto egg scramble (with basil and tomatoes, sooo good), and Texan ranch casserole.  There was enormous bowl of fresh fruit which was mixed, but each fruit maintained its own flavor (unlike a bad fruit salad would).  There was an entire table of pastries and quiche.  The bread pudding was so good we got more even after we were already stuffed.There was a great number of food options, none was bland and they were all delicious. No complaints about the staff either, though all they had to do was clear plates and bring drinks, but they did that in a timely manner.  From reading Yelp reviews of other places in Austin it seems people here don't like to pay too much for their meals, so it might be worth noting that the buffet was $16 per person.

Living in South Austin, I always want to try new spots hoping that I will fall in love. I am not sure that I am in love yet, but it was definitely not super terrible. DRINKS : I ordered the Cazadores Tall Mexican Martini. I am a fan! It was SO tall, I got quite a few drinks out of it, so that was pretty great. It wasn't too sweet, and that is a big one for me. Boyfriend ordered a house margarita on the rocks (which turned out to be on HH, so it was $2.99). His drink was too sweet though, and didn't taste awesome. I would not go out of my way to go there for HH based on that. FOOD : First, I will start with the salsa. I love that you get 3 options, but 2 of the 3 are wayyyy to spicy to consume (and with no warning other than reading other yelp reviews!) Maybe if mixed with queso? Maybe next time. I currently do not consume meat, so eating out at a mexican establishment can sometimes be tricky. Or I basically just eat cheese with more cheese on top. I did not see a ton of veggie options, so I decided to start with the most basic, cheese enchiladas. Turns out I was really hungry, because before I knew it I gobbled up my entire plate. No complaints for me. Boyfriend had the Chimichanga with ground beef. He commented that the beef was unimpressive (spices were lacking) and the burrito itself was not as crispy as it should be (since it was drenched in a gravy/queso concoction).We also had to request water refills a few times (we are very thirsty, so that is a big one for us) and were a little confused about who our server was since 2 people were checking on us. The staff was friendly though so that part was not an issue. I will say I do love how the inside is decorated, and the tables/chairs are really different and awesome!

He was definitely attentive when we caught his eye. I had wine, but my friend  tried a Mai Tai they thought tasted like a mix between a Margarita and a dark and stormy. When she brought this to the attention of the other server, he was defensive and insisted the Mai Tai was made as it is supposed to be.  The drinks were not great. There seemed to be only two servers for the downstairs area. Here's what was over the top made me super mad and I will not be . At the end of night the server says they are transitioning to a new billing system, so they are currently doing paper billing. He hands me a stacks of tickets with the short hand used for the kitchen and a table ticket that has the break down of  the drink verses food bill, no itemized bill was provided. The tickets were all kitchen short hand, so we had to grab the menu to figure out who had what and owed what. We were splitting the bill among three cards, this took time and I was highly annoyed they put it on the customer to work out all of this out splitting the bill. Given the amount of money I spent, I found this to be super disrespectful to customers."},{"name":"Shigezo Izakaya","address":"910 SW Salmon St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Went with my wife.

So we pulled up to Rudy's Country Store & Bar-B-Q and walked in to what looked like a summer camp/community supper takin place in a high-ceiling, barn-constructed like cafeteria.  Line was long (as it should be), wait wasn't (surprisingly), and service was quick and friendly.  We ordered the brisket, and w/out even double checking w/my host- I'm gonna say we ordered the \\"moist\\" and not the \\"lean\\" cuz I clearly remember entering the restaurant fat and leaving Texas fat-ter.  And since I'm a dessert aficionado, of course I took a banana pudding (topped w/nilla wafers), and a chocolate pudding (topped w/oreos).  Oh yes...I also got a side of potato salad.  To top this all off, our register girl asked if we wanted bread.  My host said yes please.  She said, how many?  As she held up a packaged loaf of bread, lookin soft like Wonder.  He was like...2.  He then whispers in my ear, \\"They give you as much bread as you want.  Free!\\"What'chu talkin' 'bout Willis?!  I gave him a perplexed look.Then as she was showin us the brisket she was about to wrap up for us, she says, like to sample some now?...and picks a beautiful fatty piece for us to sample and hands it over.  Damn this place.  I was already missin it and we didn't even pay yet.  Host w/the most added a bottle of Rudy's Bar-B-Q Sause for me to take home, because, duh- essential.We ordered everything to go, because I don't think the community supper diners would've appreciated my velociraptor-like eating style, plus I knew the brisket was going to give me that turkey tryptophan situation, and a comfy sofa or bed needed to be nearby.  Needless to say, the brisket was absolutely delicious- moist and so tender you could almost eat it w/a spoon.  The sause was a perfect pairing, but I felt the brisket was seasoned so well it didn't need much dressing at all.  The potato salad was average.  And the chocolate pudding, as simple as it was, came out on top when compared to the banana pudding, which sadly- I had high hopes for.5 stars for the quality and prep of the meat alone.  4 stars for the prompt and friendly service.  2.5 stars for the average sides.

First of all, add like $2 to everything that's on the online menu and that's how much it actually is. Pricey for my standards. I tried to get some of the Korean bbq, but the said you can only buy them. In double portions. So instead of the expected like $13 I would have to get $30 instead, so I noped out of that option. Then we were sitting there for like 15 minutes, and the person wouldn't come take our order. She instead went to talk/flirt to the people who came in after us and ignored us completely when we were ready to order and when we asked for our bill. Their bimbambap was sub par (you'd have to douse it in sauce to be any good)and the vegetarian option for it still isn't fully vegetarian.

No problem, maybe they are short staffed.... But as our meal went on there were employees standing around by the kitchen.  One girl bussed the table next to us because another told her she'd cleaned three and that isn't her job. The first set of silverware was dirty.

My favorite was the Queso De Cabra, which was baked spice goat cheese, Piquant tomato sauce, with grilled flat bread. My other favorite was the Rabo De Toro, which was braised oxtail, red wine & saffron rice. My husband's favorite was the Filetito which is filet mignon, onion,Malden cheese & arugula.

I found this place, and since I have another acquaintance named Gennaro, I thought I would check it out and grab a take out menu for my acquaintance. I was not happy when I pulled into their parking lot. It only fits about 12 cars, if that. There was a nice healthy crowd waiting inside. I usually eat later than the 5:30 that I was there. No big deal. We were seated in a timely fashion. My party had already ordered appetizers, so I ordered some Toasted Ravioli's to share. I was surprised at how large the portions are. Usually, it seems that the size of the portion is opposite that quality of the food. Big portion, lousy food. BUT, this was not that way. The portions were huge, and it was really good. I had the Chicken and Tortellini Gino and it was excellent! Everyone in my party enjoyed their meals, and the desserts were wonderful also.

If a Thai restaurant can't do a pad thai that is serviceable, then there is hardly any hope for the rest of the menu. Can't comment on the atmosphere, but I gather people like the BYOB set up. Meh!

This is ridiculous for a casual breakfast place.The food, the pancakes (self-made) were good, although i think the batter is a bit overpriced. My husband and I split 1 bottle and then each got a breakfast as well, which was good. Service was fine.Overall, it can be a fun experience, but the wait is just so long -- at least 15 minutes longer than they say it will be, which after an hour, really starts to get bad.Parking is pretty easy around here and there is a food truck park right next door where you can get smoothies, coffee, etc."},{"name":"Island Creek Oyster Bar","address":"500 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Always a favorite of mine.

The mac & cheese look like Krafts with a slice of cheese on top and whoever cooked it forgot to put in salt or any seasoning. We started sending back meats and at one point the \\"owner/chef\\" came out of the kitchen at a fast pace. Dumb me thinking oh he's coming to apologize for the bad food. Oh no the first thing he did was throw the rib plate down in my nephews place setting and said there was nothing wrong with his food and half an order or ribs could not be sent back. We tried to explain to him my nephew had not eaten some of the family wanted to taste his prior to their food arriving. It excavated into other members of the family coming to his defense. He finally agreed to replace the half order. Because the place was my idea I went over to talk to him and tell him we were celebrating a birthday, and how those ribs were not the only issue. I am a 67 year old woman that have ran my own business for over 30 years. Here I am thinking he would come back to the table to at least make so attempt at us having a pleasant experience.

Also, you should arrive with your whole party, as they could only hold a table for us for a few minutes because of the rush.We had a very nice waiter, and the food was really great. Despite how busy it was (every table full and a line out the door), the service was quick and accurate. Everyone enjoyed their meals overall, and I got a veggie and tofu pad thai that was one of the best I've had in Boston. One touch I really liked was that the waiter checked if I was vegetarian and asked if eggs were OK with me before putting in the order. I also got a bubble \\"tea\\" (\\"tea\\" in quotes because I tried the mocha cappuccino one) that was absolutely fantastic. I'd never had bubble tea before and wanted to give it a shot. It was just like a Starbucks Frappuccino with tapioca pearls in it.

Small diner atmosphere, booths, old school waitresses, every day specials, affordable prices, plethora of food options from traditional to old school, on top of outdoor seating when the weather is nice.  I was originally hesitant about visiting due to the reviews but this was my 4th visit since last summer and I have been impressed each time.  Never left disappointed.  I understand people have high expectations for a diner to meet the same criteria as a 5 star restaurant but this is a diner and thats what you get.On our last visit on friday morning, I took my daughter for \\"brunch\\".  We live 1 hour outside of Columbus but had a doctors visit in Dublin our old stomping grounds and wanted to swing by here afterwards since breakfast is served all day. The menu has a TON OF OPTIONS, if you don't see it, you can sometimes put special request in.  I saw many options for many diets as long as you have the understanding its a diner and not your personal chef but to say the least, they are flexible to work with you.Abners wasn't very busy at 11am so we were greeted in a timely fashion by both Robin and Robin.  Beverages were brought right away.  It took us longer to decide than it did for anything else.  My daughter originally went in wanting chicken wings (don't ask me Im not sure about chicken wings for brunch but thats what she wanted as she has had them here before and LOVED them lol) server checked with the cook but they had't started to smoke wings for the day yet - bummer, so she went with the cheeseburger.  I on the other hand stuck with breakfast.  I ordered the eggless wonder, biscuit with side of sausage gravy.  Both meals arrived piping hot at the same time.  My daughter commented her burger was great, we were told they have a grill top in the back so it makes a difference, I agree, it totally does.  The eggless wonder was a huge portion, lots of cheese and because Im weird with some foods, I put my sausage gravy on top of it and ate it like that.We were in and out within 30-40min.  Staff was friendly and hospitable. Prices are very reasonable.  Definitely a staple in Hilliard among the chains.  I love supporting the mom and pops diners.

I came here yesterday to catch up with my friend over some good brunch. We're both brunch fanatics and decided to give this place a try. We waited about 20 minutes or so for a table for 3. I think they only seat up to four people per table, so be aware of that! The place is really cozy and homey. Since I've been wanting to try this place for a while, I already knew what I wanted to order by looking through the menu on Yelp. I ordered an iced coffee (mind you, it's bottomless, WHAT A PLUS) and it was really strong, but delicious. They really sold me on $2 iced coffee though. You could tell it was freshly brewed and it just paired well with the liquid sugar that they serve. I ordered two dishes to share, the French toast with berries and the beef hash. I absolutely fell in love! The French toast dish came out with 6 slices (3 whole toasts in total), sprinkled with powdered sugar, and a generous amount of fresh berries on top. It was so decadent and the toast was ooey gooey. It wasn't dry at all and I didn't need to use much syrup. It just melts on your tongue while you're eating it. The berries added a nice tartness to the sweetness of the toast. The beef hash was also amazing! I've never had potato chips as home fries, but I honestly prefer this method of potatoes anyways! They were thinly cut, like a chip, and went really well with the rest of the dish. I love how the beef was more brisket like and tore apart easily. At most places, they use ground beef, but Allston Diner makes it with pulled brisket and it's just so much more different, but delicious. I also love how Allston Diner's beef isn't too salty, which tends to be the case at other breakfast spots. It also comes with four slices of toast and your choice of eggs. Service can be a bit slow since there are only so many people managing, but it's definitely worth it for the food! I can't wait to be back because I definitely want to try the Nutella Garden pancakes and more bottomless iced coffee."},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I had ordered some wings and were so flavorful, and the steak was also very good.

I had to get a bloody mary and she got the screwdriver (they had different names, but I can't remember) mine was quite spicy (and I like spicy). they also have a milder version.then she brought over the batter. I got the pumpkin and my friend ordered the buttermilk. we also ordered three toppings a piece (next time I think only 2 will be necessary, but it's not like a dollar is a huge splurge) what were my toppings? banana, bacon and a gingery compote. they were all wonderful with the pumpkin batter. the pancakes cooked up pretty quickly, but slow enough that we could pace ourselves. the squeeze bottle full of batter also made it really easy to put the appropriate amount of batter on the griddle. the syrups (there was a choice of four) could have been labeled better, but otherwise everything was great.also... we left around 10:30 (long, leisurely breakfast and they didn't rush us AT ALL! in fact our server told us to take our time) and it still wasn't mobbed.

I find it so laid back and welcoming here. There aren't many changes that I would recommend at this point. I only have two which are pretty minor. First, I'd like to see more vegetarian options on their menu. I know I make up a minority so I won't hold my breathe on that one...but it would be nice. My last suggestion would be to add more beers either on tap or in bottle. At the moment, they have a little bit of everything that will satisfy any palate. But when there's a large selection of great beer, you get a crowd more willing to come out.

They moved from Jordan to New Orleans and after Katrina they moved to Austin and THANK GOODNESS!The shawarma is delish, and seasoned and dressed fantastically, the tabouli, hummus and matabil(eggplant dip) is all amazing,as are grape leave rolls, and even while I am not the biggest fan of falafel, it was pretty darn tasty.\\n \\nTheir Thursday special is my favorite! Manseff,which is cooked lamb(personal fave and highly recommended) or chicken adorned with pine nuts over rice and stewed yogurt, which is amazing. It's a bit different from how I am used to eating it in my family, but good all the same.\\nThey have desserts too, freshly made and so tempting, Kanaffi and baklava.I have not ventured over too much into their New Orleans menu but from the spoonful I was allowed from my friend, that was some mean gumbo, and their seafood is always fresh and never frozen. The Poboy I was allowed a bite of(think it was shrimp?) was delicious as well.

I didn't have any but my mom loved them.\\nThe bread and butter had a unique twist with cayenne and honey. Tasted like honey butter but you could feel the heat in your throat. Delicious!Clam chowder: One of the best clam chowder's I've ever had. It wasn't too heavy but was still rich. It had huge chunks of clam in it. The brioche crouton was nice and chewy. If you're thinking of sharing, I recommend 2 people per bowl. We were about to order 1 bowl for the 4 of us but the waitress suggested we get 2 bowls instead of 1. They came portioned out into 4 little mini bowls. Boy, was I glad that we ordered 2 instead of one because we would have been fighting over it. Each bowl was the perfect serving!The island creek oyster were the best oysters I've had in a while. They were so fresh, creamy, and sweet! I was tempted to order another dozen just for myself. I'm VERY picky when it comes to oysters and I could find nothing off-putting about these oysters.Ribeye: Top 5 steaks of all time. The meat was so tender, there was literally, no reason to use a knife. Crab cakes: Nothing special but very decent.Roe Lobster pasta: This is a must try! Very flavorful with generous lobster and short rib chunks lightly coated in some kind of buttery sauce. The pasta is made out of roe , so just by itself, there was already intense lobster flavor. Yum!Lobster roll: It came stuffed with lobster, tossed in the perfect amount of mayo and seasoning. However, the celery was chopped too big for me and I happen to really dislike the taste of raw celery. Therefore, this dish was a miss for me. The waitress recommended replacing the kettle chips with fries. They must put crack in their fries. They are A-M-A-Z-I-N-G. Blueberry Cobbler: buttery, flaky crust + tart berry filling = deliciousHot fudge sundae: Not what I expected. It was more of a deconstructed sundae. The pecan ice cream had a strange grainy texture but great pecan taste. The chocolate lava cake was rich and not too sweet. Overall though, not the best.Overall, my favorite restaurant in Boston.

The chicken was ok - the portion was kind of small especially for $13.  The falafel was better than average, but the tabbouleh was just confusing.  It was 98% tomatoes.  I am no expert in Mediterranean food, but last time I checked tabbouleh is not supposed to look like pico de gallo.The final disappointment was the sauce they served with the falafel.  I am guessing it was meant as a tzaziki replacement.  It looked like they just took some tabbouleh and mixed some yogurt into it.

By the time the place opened, about 15 people (including a group of seven) were waiting outside. Seems normal for a popular restaurant, and I like it.I was seated promptly, and the service was great. I ordered the spicy version of Ike's Vietnamese Fish Sauce chicken wings, and then I ordered their \\"Yam Tuna\\" to go. The Yam Tuna is a \\"Thai-style tuna salad with ginger, garlic, Thai chilies, green onions, lemongrass, cherry tomatoes, and canned Oregon albacore in a spicy lime and fish sauce dressing.\\"The wings are $12 and worth every penny. There is just so much flavor in there. The fish sauce and the sugars combine for an off-the-hook experience. Adding the red chili flakes on the wings adds a hint of spice, but of course, that spice is just child's play to me.The tuna salad ($10) was good, although I don't personally think this is worth the price. I wish the tuna was fresh, as opposed to canned, for the price they list. The sauce is great. The combination of citrus and fish sauce works well here. They did not need to drown the salad in the dressing, however. Thankfully, the dressing is liquid and not creamy.For the person wanting some alcohol, Pok Pok has a full bar with an extensive list of drink options. Go nuts, my friend.Two criticisms: the water in the carafe was warm (it should always be ice water or cold water), and the aluminum cups (and water) gave an off-putting aftertaste of rice.Overall, this place still gets a thumbs up. I would come back just for the wings, but there are also some other options on the menu that intrigue me. Their \\"Kai Yaang\\" (Thai BBQ chicken) and the \\"Papaya Pok Pok\\" (spicy green papaya salad) are their other signature menu items.

The last two orders of cheese bread were on the verge of uncooked which was a huge disappointment. The worst part is they NEVER offer to fix the mistake, or say sorry.

A whipped cane sugar plus caffeine equal instant eye-opening.The gentleman that made the coffee was honest enough to explain the single serving I requested was a small cup (espresso-size) -- not a full size -- and I appreciated the heads-up.Finding Zaza is a bit of a challenge -- the sign is big enough, but the entrance isn't obvious: either you go through a different store to get to it, or you enter via the hallway marked \\"do not enter\\".   Either way, you'll find a decent cup of coffee in a terminal otherwise curiously devoid of options inside the gate area.  Not sure if that's the reason the coffee tasted so good, but it worked for me."},{"name":"Hae Paul's","address":"79 S 4th St","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"Had their Mung Bean Cake appetizer and was one of the more awesome things I've tasted.

The dish had shellfish of mussels and shrimp that were fresh sweet and tasty.  But it also had some salmon medallions that were definitely past prime.  Most off putting though was the dish was seasoned with some sort of smoked pork lardon that I was definitely not expecting in what is usually a bright spicy medley of seafood, garlic and tomato.  It seemed to weight the dishes overall flavor which could have benefited from some acid and spice to balance out the flavor.My husband's dish was a pasta with a house made sausage that he felt was satisfactory.Our waiter was very friendly and appropriately attentive.

I have no patience for people who are unwilling to try this place. I once cancelled an OKC date with someone I found very \\"promising\\" (aka hot)  because he refused to come here with me. I love Life Alive so much, any time I am within walking distances ( 5 miles or less), I come here. I've made this trek in the snow, and in the blistering heat. Yesterday I ate at Life Alive twice, once for lunch and once for dinner, the second time dragging my boyfriend. Let me be clear, there is no \\"right time\\" to go to Life Alive. It's always a mad house. You will always be surrounded by hippies who look like they'd much rather be knitting hemp. However, do make sure to ask the people that appear to be in front of you, if they are in fact in line for the register. After years in existence, there still is some confusion on where to stand to pick up togo items and where to stand for the cashier. I generally stick to the \\"warm plates\\" but the wraps are delicious, albeit a tad smaller in portion than the bowl options. The sandwich plusses are the added cheese ratio  and that the Bragg's Liquid Aminos really shine through. My favorite items on the menu are the Adventurer and the Swami. The Adventurer consists of a mix of corn, beets, broccoli, greens,tofu and tamari almonds tossed in Sesame Ginger dressing and laying on a bed of cheddar cheese smothered quinoa and brown rice. The Swami, tamari almonds, raisins, carrots, broccoli, greens and pearl onions on brown rice with sweet curry miso sauce, is also delicious! It has a very Indian restaurant flavor (lots of turmeric and cumin in the sauce). Add egg to the Swami if you want it to be a little more filling. Tips:There are TWO bathrooms, both need a code to enter. You can get the bathroom code from the cashier. Do try not to clog up the hallway, in front of the water table, hoping to jump in the bathroom after someone because you can't be be bothered to find out the password.The demi is almost the exact same size as the bowl, and it's almost 4 dollars cheaper. You can substitute the brown rice, udon noodles, or quinoa for each other, for no extra charge.They have beers on tap, but they aren't great, think Cisco brewery.They do not sell coffee due to some sort of zoning/licensing agreement that 1369 Coffee has with the city of Cambridge. They have free 2 hour wifi, code posted in front of the cash registers. The bowls are not stagnant, they can substitute ingredients, but there may be an additional charge.If dining in, you can sit anywhere.upstairs, downstairs or outside, and they will deliver the food to you."},{"name":"Velas","address":"7316 N Lombard St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"I love these people and they seriously have the best fish tacos in Portland!We went to the Krugers farm stand in St Johns for fun one Friday night and were completely taken by the friendly atmosphere, great beer (Captured by Porches), and delicious food (both Velos Taqueria and Che Cafe).

Instead of the bbq sauce and apple wood bacon balancing the salt of the pastrami, the sandwich actually still just tasted salty - perhaps the bacon actually added to it; I also felt it lacked the heat that the name and ingredients led me to think it would deliver.To balance the pastrami-based sandwich, the second sandwich was the Triple Club. I actually really enjoyed this one to my own surprise and I also must add, after eating the disappointing Pastrami Diablo, I was still quite full (believe it - Sam LaGrassa's serves up HUGE sangys, no joke) so I took the half a Triple Club on to the TRAIN.

The best veggie dolmas in town because they aren't overpowered by grape leaf, refreshing tabbouleh, fresh bread, crunchy falafel which makes a great veggie gyro (but get extra tzatziki if you order one because there is no delicious baby lamb grease to offset the dryness of the falafel). Don't take a crowd between 12-1 because there isn't room for all of you.  There are several tables outside, which is a nice change on a pretty day.  The interior is a little drab, but I just tell myself  it's because not enough people know about the place to generate the funds to remodel.

My whole meal was only 33 bucks, but it was fantastic.The service is great and the bread they give you before you order is delicious, I ordered the rare tuna as my appetizer, the steak with mashed potatoes as my entree, and chocolate flourless cake with grand marnier sauce.  The tuna was my favorite part of the meal, it was tender with sesame seeds on the outside and served with delicious seaweed salad.  The steak was also very good although it was cooked more medium rare than medium like I ordered it.  The cake was very good too, my boyfriend got the strawberry shortcake and I tried some and was jealous.Even though it was restaurant week they didn't scimp on the portions, our waiter was super nice and explained all the dishes and came out all the time to refill our water/soda.

If you're looking for refined elegance....keep walking. The Daily Catch is a closet sized restaurant ( a total of 20 seats fills the tiny space) in Boston's north end. The kitchen and dining room are literally one and the same, allowing you to watch your meal being prepared. Any money the eatery makes clearly isn't spent on the decor. A simple \\"no frills\\" ambience inhabits the place. The menu is written on a chalk board mounted on the wall. Drinks are served in small plastic cups and entrees are served in the saute pan used to cook them (a nice touch in my opinion).  What The Daily Catch lacks in visual appeal, it more than makes up in food quality. I ordered the fried calamari to start. Surprisingly, it didn't come with the traditional hot peppers on marinara dipping sauce that I'm used to with other places. Just a wedge of lemon. Not a problem because it was fried to perfection. A sprinkle of parmesean cheese while still hot and a squeeze of lemon was all that was needed. Crunchy and delicious. I then had the linguine with white clam sauce. Not the absolute best I've ever had but a very close runner-up. Great blend of garlic, butter and wine. Definately leaves you feeling satisfied. The only disappointing thing I had were the calamari meatballs which I ordered to go. Two good sized meatballs in a marinara sauce. I thought the flavor was somehow off.  Perhaps it's just that I'm not used to calamari mixed with ground beef. The place is \\"cash only\\" but prices are reasonable so a huge wad of dough in your pocket isn't neccessary. If waiting out on the sidewalk is not your cup of tea, go for lunch or an early supper to avoid the crowds.

Since then, I've never ordered from here again. I used to order from the Brookline location a lot and it was pretty good. The Somerville location was never as good and the green wings stopped me completely from ordering here. Also, another issue I've had frequently at both location is quality control. I've frequently got \\"wings\\" that were actually basically just bones stuck together and deep fried with none or barely any meat on them. Granted, that wasn't the majority of the wings, but sometimes 2-4 per large order of wings. That shouldn't happen. And green wings... well.. definitely should never happen.

After dinner on Monday (wonder if I saw Don B), Pok Pok is definitely a very unique place with great food and drinks. Pok Pok defies one's usual expectation of Thai food as it doesn't have the usual Pad Thai or Panang curry, but the food there is very accessible and items that you simply do not see anywhere else. We had Ike's wings, which was one of the tastiest versions of wings I've had anywhere with combination of sweet, sour, and spice. Brining the wings definitely helps, and there is no shame in making a mess while devouring these tasty morsels. The recipe for the spare ribs was featured in an issue of Food and Wine, and my version tasted nothing like the original, which were just so tender after being cooked over low heat in a smoker. Pok Pok is called a whiskey soda lounge and with good reason, as they have a great selection of bourbon and rye. I actually tried a pomegranate caipirinha, which was made with freshly muddled lime and pomegranate, which was fresh and sour and complimented the food very well. I'll definitely try a few more dishes on my next visit to Portland, but for now, it's back to the kitchen to try to fine-tune some of Pok Pok's dishes at home in Seattle."},{"name":"Counter Culture","address":"2337 E Cesar Chavez St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"As a vegan in an unfamiliar city, I looked on Yelp to find nearby vegan friendly restaurants when visiting Austin for the weekend.

The place had been hyped to epic proportions and was primed to disappoint.It didn't.  I'll be honest, my first visit was closer to a 3-star experience, but that was because we did it completely wrong.  I went with 2 vegetarians, while I wanted meat, so I just ordered the fish sauce wings for myself (do NOT do this!).  They were fantastic, but eating more than 3-4 of them can put even the biggest salt-lover over the top.  Once I had the chance to go with a bigger group however, it was all-around phenomenal.  The service was wonderfully friendly and attentive, especially considering the tight space and volume they were handling.  I suggest going in a group of at least 6-8 so you can sample all that Pok Pok has to offer.  The fish sauce wings, boar, and the Het Paa Naam Tok were standouts for me, but all were worth trying!\\nI also went to their 5-year anniversary held across the street at the Whiskey Soda Lounge (which doubles as Pok Pok's waiting room) this past weekend, and they've hooked me even further.

Located off College Avenue, a little bit more towards Decatur after you have passed Sun in My Belly (like no more than two blocks), it's really easy to drive by it and not notice it.  It's tiny (with 18 indoor seats and 4 outdoor seats) and shares a building with a salon ( and there is a second salon right next to it).  There are four spaces for parking behind the building and if the salon in the next building is closed, you can park there too.  However, overall parking is very limited so plan accordingly (the parking to the back is one way and no room for two cars going opposite directions to squeeze by).Dish Dive's decor is very minimal and the setting reminds me of a family run cafe off the side of an interstate.  It's so minimal, the AC is a window unit mounted to one side of the wall.  Because of its size, the staff does not exceed 4 people and they wear all sort of hats.  So needless to say, once you have placed your order, the service is rather slow and infrequent.  Just grab one of the guys as they walked by if you need something.Because the menu changes weekly and is very limited, you should really check it out on facebook before you head to it.  They are posted on facebook every Wednesday.  Otherwise, you might end up hangry.For our course, we ordered the Mac & Cheese, the Pork Belly, the Hanger Steak, the Baked Catfish, and the Seared Salmon.  The Mac & Cheese was mer.  It didn't stand out in anyway.  The pork belly was good (fatty but not runny) and goes well with the grits and the fried bread, but since so many places now offer pork belly, it didn't stand out much.  The number 1 best dish for the night was definitely the hanger steak.  it was done well (aka not overcooked), marinated with wine, and came with a savory sauce that's not layered with fat.  Event he vegetables were well grilled.\\nTied for second place is the cat fish and the salmon.  I loved the catfish because it was crispy outside and tender inside.  They were able to get the muddy taste out of the fish with fresh herbs.  Under the fish was a bed of mushrooms, asparagus, tomatoes, and onion; they were also soaked with herbs that made them very tasty.My wife loved the salmon because the skin was crispy, the flavor was good, and the texture was right (not too soft not too hard).  Now, if you don't like the cooked salmon taste, and I do not, this is not the dish for you.  I would recommend the catfish instead.Over all, we had a positive experience despite service was spotty and parking was difficult.  The food definitely made up for it.  It reminds me of Gun Show where the plates were designed to be shared, in smaller portions, and you would need to order several for the night.  And because of that, the cost was comparable to Gun Show in that it cost us $100 with 5 dishes.  So be prepared if you are used to a $50 bill for two at dinner."},{"name":"Tso Chinese Delivery","address":"3909 N Interstate 35, Ste E-5","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I'm more of a 3.75 but I am always more lenient on delivery than dining in.

I ordered \\"The Nat\\"- cheese, spinach, chicken, pesto, sun dried tomatoes, and I added marinara sauce. \\nI also ordered cheese sticks with marinara sauce Flavor is great, no doubt about it.

Even though it took me an hour and half from start to finish- the owner gave out coupons to people who were waiting for another visit and a discounted pizza. I watched her go through the line and thank people for coming, engage in conversation and greeted everyone with a smile. I won't lie, by the time I moved up in the line, I stopped paying attention.

We waited an extremely long time to get served and when we did order something (even a coke), it took upwards of 20 minutes to get it.  We ordered a couple of appetizers to start.  After eating the appetizers, our server made a comment like, \\"are you guys going to order anything else, or just appetizers and take up this table?\\" Really, guy?  I told him we would be ordering a bunch of other items which we did.  Our tab was upwards of $155.00 and totally not worth it.I will say the ONLY thing that I thoroughly enjoyed there were the wings.  I would go back for those anytime. The papaya salad wasn't very good.  The sausage was plain.  The catfish curry was lackluster.  The ribs were just \\"okay\\".  The coconut chicken soup was bland.

Our waitress was friendly and did a great job of recommending the beer battered asparagus for our appetizer.  A friend suggested that I try the Ruby Red Slippers drink.  I guess I really liked it because I ended up having three.  For our meal, I ordered the Pecan crusted catfish with sweet potatoes and my husband ordered the chicken fried steak with mashed potatoes.  Both were incredible and the portions were HUGE.  My main disappointment was that I really, really wanted the red velvet cake, but our waitress said they no longer had it even though it was still on the menu.  Bummer.  That probably should have been my sign that I didn't need a dessert after our huge meal with alcohol but I just couldn't resist.  We ordered the brownie instead and it was to die for.

The first time I went, I have ordered the Sicilian hash and I ordered an over easy egg instead of scrambled egg and they made it happen. It was super delicious! The service was great and also they had good orange juice since I am not a coffee drinker. The second visit was...meh. I brought my mom that came from Florida after me raving about the food here. My mom had coffee and it was cold. She asked for them to warm it up or bring fresh coffee and they were really snappy about it. I ordered the Sicilian hash again and asked for the over easy egg again and they said \\"No, we only serve scrambled eggs, ma'am!Theres already a scrambled egg premix and that's where all the eggs are.\\" No apologies, no nothing. So I went ahead and just ordered as it came. The beef was SALTY, that instead of enjoying my orange juice(which by the way, it felt it was spoiled this time) I had to drink it all like water, and I had more water to take the saltiness off my palate. Not enough potatoes, just 3 pieces of them. My mom had just a side of scrambled eggs, bacon and wheat toast and she said it was alright. When we went to pay and I stood up, right by the door that goes through the patio, there it was: a tower of fresh eggs, not the premix, just eggs that they could've easily grabbed from there to make me at least one over easy egg, which it wouldn't had taken no more than two minutes to make, but of course they had to lie to me about not making it since all the eggs are premixed.

While I enjoyed them all, my favorites were the East Beach Blonde from RI and the Hama Hama from WA.The menu is nearly all raw bar, shell fish and seafood with main courses ranging in price from $21-$32; note the menu changes regularly and pricing fluctuates. Cheaper options are available including a Fish & Chips I saw served which looked delicious for $15.The staff was very helpful through out our meal and aside from bringing us the wrong bottle of wine service was flawless.  I ordered the Point Judith Fluke with porcini and morel mushroom risotto and English peas for $25.  The fish was perfectly prepared and the risotto so creamy it had me scraping the plate to eat every last morsel.I'd highly recommend trying this restaurant and raw bar, but would suggest visiting the first half of the week when it is less crowded.

With its red, black and Asian accents, wine display and mellow background music, this classy sushi restaurant features specialty rolls, roll combos and a Japanese menu, located on Lonsdale and 13th. Although a little pricier than your typical sushi spot, the quality is also a little better. It's a great setting for a dinner date (quite romantic) or to experience some fusion rolls with some girlfriends, tapa-style. The staff are smiley, very welcoming and hospitable! I'd have to say this was one of the first times that I've embraced trying fusion sushi rolls (ie. 'white people' rolls with cream cheese) and it was fun. I came with my two guy friends for dinner tonight. We shared: - Philadelphia roll: salmon, cream cheese, avocado, smoked salmon ($8.25)\\n- Sweet roll: cream cheese, avocado, prawn tempura, tuna, avocado ($10) - A unique tempura wrapped roll. The guys loved both of these! They were very good, but I\`m not a huge fan of cream cheese in my rolls.\\n- Roll Combo A: California, spicy tuna and salmon roll ($11) - Good, spicy tuna was very good  \\n- Hawaiian roll: mango, avocado, cucumber, avocado salad. Surprisingly, very tasty, refreshing, delicious - Highly recommend! ($10.50)\\n- Coconut ice cream ($6) - Coconut ice cream with coconut shavings and a delicious mango on the inside, served in a cupcake wrapper - so yummy! Recommend! If you come in thinking of these specialty rolls as tapas and not sushi, then the rolls are delicious, reasonably-priced and worth experiencing. You just have to get that \\"this isn't real roll sushi\\" mindset out of ya -  hah, well at least I had too. A great addition to the mix on the North Shore!What's more:\\n- Take-out option\\n- Open for lunch\\n- Specialty rolls: $8-12 for 8 pieces\\n- Offers Japanese menu with udon, yakisoba, and teriyaki bowls, nigiri, rolls, lunch boxes"},{"name":"Kevin Rathbun Steak","address":"154 Krog St","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Definitely an indulgence! Hubs and I came went in last night for a dinner date and were completely wowed by everything. Aaron was a great server and we will definitely be asking for him whenever we go back! Started off with the thick cut bacon & received complimentary lobster fritters. Both were so good! We shared the porterhouse for 2, which comes presliced, and the presentation of it was pretty fantastic. We also had the mushroom & onions and mashed potatoes to accompany it, and were also brought the corn (also complimentary) So glad that they brought us the corn, because it was definitely my favorite side of the 3. We had the matcha cheesecake, peach crisper (?), and tiramisu baked alaska for dessert. Lets just say my sweet tooth was definitely satisfied. Loved every single one. Hubs at the whole tiramisu, and I was able to take the crisper and cheesecake home. All in all, definitely worth every penny coming here.

But my fear is always that a franchise can't keep a terrific thing going.  I was wrong.  DEAD wrong!Ceviche in Orlando is very different as far as atmosphere- a large store front facing Church Street with unique lighting, cold dining room (I had on a leather jacket but my boyfriend- the human heater- was comfortable for once) with a butcher type set up in the middle with a dark attached bar where you first enter.  Entirely different from the renovated house in SoHo but still cool.  I really enjoyed the openess although it was still dimly lit.The food?  Amazing.  We had two orders of the espinacas.  We LOVE that spinach and it's SOOOO simple but I can't figure out how to make it.  We also had the red snapper with peppers and onions (truly amazing), asapagus (beautiful presentation and delicious), patatas bravas (I loved it, my boyfriend wasn't that impressed but enjoyed it anyway).  The meal was so amazing, I can't stop raving about it.  I also had the sparkling sangria which is always delicious.  I am totally sold on Ceviche, no matter the location.  The service, as usual, was ok.  Friendly but not familiar, you know?  Just a wee bit stand offish and \\"too cool for school\\" but the food is so amazing, I couldn't care less about the slight snobbery.

First, it is an all you can eat salad bar buffet. It's not gourmet, but it is fresh. They have multiple types of greens for a base and loads of fresh veggie toppings from butternut squash to Beans to peppers, corn, etc etc. they have a few kinds of cheese and several house made dressings. They even have fat free house made ranch, Italian, and honey mustard. All of which are delicious. They also have unlimited soups, baked potatoes, pasta, and bread. All were equally delicious but the main show is clearly the salad bar. Each person clocks in at just under $10, so it's an awesome deal compared to the other tourist places.

In reality, I walked out full, satisfied and excited to come back.  I got the Green Goddess bowl with tamari almonds on top.  $1.50 for a handful of almonds made the cheap-wad in me seriously consider bringing almonds for my next visit, but other than that, it was totally worth it.  Avocado,  broccoli, greens, and tofu over brown rice are pretty much all my favorite healthy things, but with that  Ginger Nama Shoyu Sauce over all of it?  YUM!

Getting seated was a cinch, with the restaurant being slightly more than half-full around 2 PM. It has a very airy atmosphere, and the service was excellent - the food was brought out quickly, and our water glasses were always full. You are given 3(!) drinks menus - one for wine, one for beer/wine by the glass, and one for cocktails and other drinks. That said, the beer selection was quite disappointing - being in a big beer town, there were very few local brews, and too many ciders (IMO). The cocktail menu was alright - I had Wild Card, which tasted great, but it also is absolutely filled up with ice, making the actual amount of liquid quite small.As for the food itself, the oysters were pretty decent, but I wasn't as impressed as I was with the ones we had at B&G the previous afternoon. The meaty ones in particular didn't have as much flavor, and I noticed that many of the oysters had small chunks of ice in them - suggesting that the ice on the tray was perhaps plated a bit aggressively. I also had one of the fried oyster sliders as a starter, but that too wasn't that impressive (outside of the size of the oyster). The batter is plain, and while the sliced radishes add a little flavor, it's not enough. My favorite part of the meal was probably the non-seafood I had - the burger at brunch; the patty was cooked perfectly, and the real winner was the maple-glazed bacon that sits atop the burger. That slight bit of sweetness, in each bite of the relatively hardy, tough bacon, was a real treat with each bite. My wife's lobster bisque soup was also nice - not overly creamy but infused with a really strong lobster flavor.Perhaps expectations were set a bit too high, but in all, I came out of here full but a tad disappointed. I'd like to come back for dinner so I could try the famous pasta or some of their fishes, but at least based on the brunch experience, I felt like I had better previous oyster experiences."},{"name":"Powell's City of Books","address":"1005 W Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"Powell's books is a must for book lovers!

It's still a little pricey but probably best pie nearby now\\n--------------------------------------------------\\nI've had Your Pie at perimeter locations and this is on par. You can expect a decent pie but nothing that will blow you away and it's not too cheap. I wish they offered large pizzas here that you could share instead of just the individual pizzas that really aren't enough to share and it just seems very cookie cutter. We tried the classic ischia pie, which is a white pizza and substituted the tomatoes for artichoke hearts. We also got the Nat- which was a little more interesting with the basil pesto, mozzarella and feta, and chicken and sun dried tomatoes toppings. Pies cooked pretty quickly and crust is ok but could be a little more crispy. Side salads (Greek and Caprese) were ok but premade and not that fresh. The build your own customized pizza is a nice idea, but the ingredients don't seem or taste particularly fresh. Maybe it's just harder to make pizzas like a sub-sandwich and focusing on fewer but more interesting pizzas would help here.

It's definitely one of the best breakfast places we've been to, and easily our favorite for pancakes. Street parking wasn't bad at all, which we weren't expecting since it was around 11:30am on a Sunday. If so, the street is long enough to where you'll eventually find a spot. When we got the the restaurant, we were told it would be about an hour wait, which we had anticipated because it was prime time brunch hour. However, we ended up waiting over 1.5 hrs due to some sort of mix up (another party with the same name had left and they scratched us off the wait list instead of the party that left). My boyfriend finally went up to ask them, and they had realized their mistake. After that we only waited about 5 minutes before being seated.Aside from the wait experience, the food was BOMB. We started off ordering buttermilk and peanut butter flavored batter, with strawberries, chocolate chips, bananas, crispy bacon, and pecans. We also ordered eggs and bacon to go with our pancakes. One of the things I love about this place is how interactive the dining experience was. My boyfriend and I really enjoyed making our customized pancakes and got it down pretty quick. The pancakes were SO good that we ended up ordering another peanut butter flavored batter with chocolate chips and bananas. Our server was very friendly and helpful, but the attentiveness wasn't all there (due to the restaurant being so darn busy). There were a couple of times where we had to rigorously wave our hands to get her attention.Overall, I'd give Slappycakes a 4/5 stars, mainly for the food. Everything tasted amazing, but we were pretty upset about having to wait so long because the hostess crossed us off the wait list. We got there at 11:30am, and didn't leave until around 2:30/45pm after all of the waiting before and during our meal. Needless to say, we walked out of there completely stuffed and with happy tummies. If you're looking for a fun and yummy breakfast place, Slappycakes is a great option.

As you'd expect, there's greeting cards, magazines and Powell's swag. You might not leave this room.But what makes Powell's special is that there are 10 more rooms as big as this one, organized by color. I spent most of my time in the purple room which has  a large supply of business and psych books. Don't worry if you don't know where to go -- there are self-service kiosks and physical maps.If browsing wears you out, there's even an on-site coffee shop.

While I normally do not write much about the decor, I found MF Sushi to be very earthy, simple, and right up my alley of how I would want to eat my decadent and delicious sushi.They have a lunch menu and a dinner menu, but I chose lunch because it was a smaller menu, and I wanted natural lighting for photos.  I also knew what I was going to order which was essentially sushi and nigiri, and this made the lunch menu perfect for me.  I ordered and inhaled the following:-tako sunomono: octopus vinagrette salad\\n-sushi sashimi set A: five pieces of nigiri sushi and 6 pieces of sashimi, two fish types - chef's choice.\\n-uni nigiri: the waitress told me that the uni was flown in from Japan that day and so it had to be ordered.\\n-chu-toro nigiri: medium grade fatty-tuna, also flown in from Japan and orderedMiso soup and a side salad with ginger dressing was served as well, complimentary from the house. ---------Tako Sunomono\\nPROS\\n-great flavor and balance of the mirin and the rice vinegar\\n-tako (octopus) was not overcooked, tender and not rubbery\\n-served with equal or slightly less amount of thin sliced cucumbers and a little bit of wakame, giving a nice variety of texture.CONS\\n-the amount of sunomono for what you are paying for is bitter tasting.  They better have wrestled the octopus with bare hands for this dish.---------Sushi Sashimi Set A\\nPROS\\n-melt in your mouth fish: this is top-grade sushi.  To get fish this soft that falls apart in your mouth as you chew is hard to find.  Most of the time, you have to really give the fish a good chew.  This place has it down.\\n-sushi rice was cooked to perfection: not overly sticky, not undercooked\\n-good amount of wasabi underneath each piece of nigiri: I can't stand the \\"generous\\" portions of wasabi that certain places use because it overwhelms the flavor of the fish and throws off the balance between fish and sushi rice.\\n-balanced portion of fish to rice ratioCONS\\n-NONE---------Uni (sea urchin): I'm comparing this to the uni from Sushi Yasuda which was so creamy and fresh that it literally dissolved in my mouth.  While this did NOT dissolve in my mouth, it did do a very slow melt with some chewing required (also because there is sushi rice involved).   Thank you Japan for letting us fly it in!PROS\\n-the most melt-in-your-mouth you can find in ATL (to date for me)\\n-no fermented fish flavor: most important part to me\\n-great portion of uni, definitely not stingy with the seafood today!\\n-probably the second best uni nigiri that I've had in the USA, but I've yet to order it out west so this will be put to the test in April when I go out to the Bay!CONS\\n- super expensive for two pieces of nigiri...if it's hard for you to throw down that much anyway. Think mid-to-high-teens.--------Chu-toro nigiri: This was again, also flown in from Japan, and I ordered it only because they did not have O-Toro, the fattiest grade of tuna possible.  (I'm probably going to die from mercury poisoning if anything but hopefully it won't be painful and there will be a cure or at least a way to purge it safely from my body).PROS\\n- melt-in-your-mouth fresh: I did not get this at Sushi Yasuda, but I did get O-Toro there, therefore I cannot compare because the levels of fattiness really distinguish these two cuts of fish from each other.\\n- sushi rice perfection, again.\\n- good balance of rice to fish\\n- also minimal wasabi paste, thank goodness!CONS\\n-be prepared to throw down your credit card blindly at the end of the meal and just cry when you get your monthly statement.  For a sushi lover though, it's totally worth it. It's fatty tuna!--------This place was so good it's made my top restaurants list to celebrate my birthday dinner which is ridiculously hard to do.

While the portions are decently sized for the price (~15 dollars), there are too few options. The menu consists of 10 or so choices, and many of them are based around some sort of protein - mostly in a sandwich form. This place serves the fattiest Banh Mi sandwich I ever had, which is fine if you don't mind indulging yourself in hundreds of calories of saturated fat. It was tasty, but definitely appeals to some palettes more than others. I had Crazy Carl on a few occasions as well; the sandwich was alright - it is a layered combination of mozzarella, sauteed portobello mushrooms and some greens. It seemed to lack seasoning.The sandwich was dripping in oil, which, again, some people like, but I am not a big fan of. The fries: some tend to rave about these, especially if they get a side of \\"duck fat\\" sauce. Fries are generally alright. They are huge wedges. A bit under-salted, but better than McDs (as they should be for the price).Servers: generally awesome, friendly people. A+ here.

The oyster sliders are also fantastic, deep fried oysters served on a lightly toasted brioche bun.  The prices are reasonable and the service is great.  We have been able to walk in several times, and reservations are pretty easy as well.  You won't have to wait two hours, like at Neptune.  I also love the decor, i.e. the wall on the far end of the restaurant is made entirely of oyster shells!  This is a great place for a Friday night, and they have a decent bar area.

Not a fan of a la carte rice (just include a bowl for everyone already!), but the dishes were unique, creative, and wildly flavorful.My normal spice preference is mild to medium, I'm more of a flavor vs. heat guy, but my travelling companion loves it hot.  The food here is definitely hot; they even provide iced mustard greens to help you cool the burn!  The boar collar, papaya salad, and pork sateh were all amazing with fresh ingredients carefully crafted into miniature masterpieces.  I'm not sure it was intentional, but the dishes are not served very hot, temperature-wise that is, and I like meat dishes to be hotter.The dining space is cramped and led to some interesting conversation with our neighbors about the carafe of water on the table... it turns out not to be dishwater, but instead has been infused with some leaves giving a nutty, coconut rice flavor.  Unfortunately, it was the busser who answered that for us, as well as other food questions.  I found our server to be too distracted to help us with the menu or guide us on our culinary journey.  \\"What's your favorite?\\" is not intended to solicit an answer of \\"everything.\\"  Help me understand the flavor profiles, the chef's nuances (that were probably shared with you), the dining experience (what are these greens for?)... too much of that responsibility seemed to fall on those I was not tipping.All in all, I'll be back.

I can see myself setting at the bar with my wife for a great after work treat.The Clam Chowder (which we had one order split between us) was a Boston Top Five out of the gate.  The Chowder was creamy, with the freshest clams and wonderfully balanced with pork.The Fried Clams were super fresh and brought me back to a Summer Day at the Clam Box in Ipswich.  They were super fresh and tender.  Wonderful!  They did come with some fries underneath that were not the very crispy and a little soggy but the Clams were the Star!The Lobster Roll was the only bump in the road.  The lobster was fresh and tasty.  Not too much dressing and nicely seasoned.  The Lobster Roll came on a large Rosemary roll which was a lot of bread for the dish.  When I think of Lobster Roll I think of my Summers in Maine with Lobster pouring out of a buttered Hot Dog Roll.  A smaller simpler roll would have been more to my liking.  Coming with the Lobster Roll was Homemade Potato Chips.  They were cold, soggy and I would not be surprised if they were reheated from earlier in the day.   Cape Cod Chips would have been much better.  The chips seemed a lot of work to do for being so disappointing.All around an \\"A-\\" for food, only the fries, chips and Rosemary Roll held it back from a true \\"A\\".

The crowd was an interesting mix; lots of people from all of the hotels downtown.  I think there was even a bachelorette party getting started (the right way too - with a carafe of mimosa and some bloody marys).Unfortunately, the food was not really all that spectacular.  There were not a ton of options for vegetarians.  And, although I was a huge fan of the pesto egg thing, the migas were subpar in comparison to Magnolia, Kerby, or a slew of other brunch spots.  It also wasn't the cheapest meal either ($16 brunch buffet + $3.50 bloody marys).

I called on Friday morning and got a table for 10 at 6:15 that same evening. The person who took my reservation warned me that they already had an 8:15 reservation which I really appreciated. It helped us stay mindful of time and kept us from ordering lots more and feeling too gluttonous when we left. While many of the dishes are Thai, there are other SE Asian dishes and influences on the menu as well so if you're looking for standard Thai fare, this isn't the place. But it is a place you should try because it's great food. I notice that the reviews here indicate this is not a good spot for kids and I disagree. We had our 2 with us (ages 4 and 5) and they loved it and were well taken care of. They are adventurous eaters and tried many of the less-spicy dishes (and even a few of the spicy ones) but it may not be wise to bring finicky eaters here. Our kids also have allergies and the staff were great about pointing out what to avoid. We all loved the drinking vinegars and tried a nice selection. Favorites were the pineapple, tamarind and strawberry. It kind of reminds me of kombucha, but slightly less tangy. I also had the evening drink special, a mango alexander. It was heavy on the coconut milk but still an interesting mix of flavors. On tap for the evening was Daily Bread Common Ale, which was enjoyed by those who had it. The dishes we shared included a tilapia special (which my husband  finished every scrap of, including the eyeballs and tail); the wings of course - we got one mild order for the kids and a spicy version for the rest of us. Did not disappoint - delish! Also enjoyed the Khao Soi Kai -- a nice, mild but flavorful soup; the Muu Paa Kham Waan (boar collar) was very good but very spicy; the papaya salad was well liked and the pork belly was raved about as the favorite of the evening. The only thing that wasn't finished was the baby back ribs. They were a bit tough and not as tasty as the other options on the table. We also tried a few of the desserts: the coffee/donut combo which wasn't great but a fine, sweet treat; the whiskeysoda float was interesting, really liked the bourbon ice cream; and finally the ice cream sandwich. If you've ever traveled in The Philippines you've probably seen ice cream sandwiches like this (Filipinos call it dirty ice cream). They fold a piece of bread in half and put scoops of ice cream in the middle. I'm not a fan but my daughter was and it made my Filipino husband nostalgic for home. The staff was patient and attentive and answered our questions enthusiastically. A great experience, all around. On the way out we noticed that they have a take-out window.

I hate having to order this anywhere else as it's never quite as good."},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"In a short time, Pok Pok became one of the country's most recognized and decorated restaurants, its (non-Thai) chef readily known by name.  And deservedly, as Andy Ricker's passion for Thai food translates to a menu that pays homage to this vibrant cuisine.  Happily for me, his first venture out of Portland is to my hometown Brooklyn, but I begin my Pok Pok experience in Portland.After a preview courtesy of Whiskey Soda Lounge, we arrived the next evening for dinner.  Pok Pok operates out of a Ricker's former house on a residential block, with ramshackle extensions growing all over, strung with colorful lights, meant to evoke a casual street food scene in Thailand.  The interior is quite a bit sleeker, but remains simple, vaguely diner-like.  Water at the table are flavored with Pandanus leaf, served in tin cups.Pok Pok serves lunch from 11 AM - 2:30 PM, late lunch 2:30 PM - 5 PM, then dinner 5 PM - 10 PM.  The menus are not totally distinct, with much crossover, worth a look to decide when to make the trip.  Wait times here are legendary, but as with most restaurants, it probably depends on day of week and arrival time.  Late lunch was very quiet, and at 5 PM, we were the only people in the low-slung downstairs dining room.  Another indoor dining room upstairs, plus covered outdoor seating.  When we departed, it was mayhem outside.At first glance, the menu looks intimidating.  Dishes go by their romanized Thai names, probably incomprehensible to most people.  Add a long description under each and it looks more like a page out of a newspaper than a menu.  But get back to the description to find a comprehensive list of ingredients.  Don't miss the comments at the end; some useful and interesting stuff.  The dedication to Thai food is clear from the menu alone, made manifest by the attempt to educate the diner and bring them into the fold.Dishes are for sharing, and worthwhile to choose from different sections of the menu (e.g., grill, curries, noodle dishes, salads).  The famed chicken wings come deep-fried and smothered in a sugar/fish sauce mix, made spicy by request.  Do they live up to their considerable hype?  Loved the salty-sweet-heat flavor and crunchy exterior but have had better, juicier wings.  Verdict: definitely worth trying.Another specialty, and a classic Thai dish, is green papaya salad, available with ground salted black crab mixed in.  This one was a heat wave, and Pok Pok doesn't hold back much.  The papaya was limp, but all else popped with flavor elements.  One of the best papaya salads I've enjoyed in the US.The laap pet issan was a gorgeous mess of fried duck, liver, and skin, flavored with lemongrass, plentiful herbs and shallots, toasted rice powder, lime juice, fish sauce, with a steady heat.  Interesting, lots going on, but loved it less than I hoped to, the flavors and textures didn't quite come together.Finished with khao soi, a Northern Thai curry noodle soup that my dining partners parsed in detail, contrasting with Thailand versions.  Lacking the point of comparison, I enjoyed the springy flat noodles and subtle curry flavor of the broth, but found the broth too oily to drink much of.  The pile of crispy noodles on top seemed like overkill, but possibly I didn't know what to do with them (soak them in the broth?).There's plenty of beverage options to accompany the lively food.  Extensive whiskey list, Asian-leaning beers, a handful of wines, various teas and coffees, plus cocktails liberally using housemade drinking vinegars.  The vinegars are offered in lots of flavors and can be ordered mixed with soda water for serving.  I tried celery, subtle and just slightly tart and sweet.  Naam krachiap (iced hibiscus) was also easy on sweet, mildly floral.Having yet to visit Thailand, I can count only a handful of Thai restaurants in the US with execution and flavors that thrilled me.  Pok Pok is one of them.  At its best, the food we sampled displayed the complex intensity that attracts me to Thai food.  I did not try enough for a better opinion, but there's no question I'd return to Pok Pok again.  Of course, the Brooklyn version is a lot closer, but that review is for another day."},{"name":"La Hacienda Restaurant","address":"8204 Crystal Clear Ln","city":"Orlando","stars":"2.5","text":"We've been at this restaurant a few times in the past but in their previous location which I think was right across the street from where they are now. We have always been very pleased with the food and the service.My favorite thing on their menu is an appetizer called aborrajado. It is so freaking delicious and consists of a \\"ball\\" made of sweet ripe plantains and it is stuffed with queso blanco colombiano. This queso seems to be kind of a crumbly cheese that doesn't melt all the way so it mantains some texture that tastes wonderfully with the soft and crunchy sweet plantain.The plate that we usually order (to be shared between 2 people at the least) is a monster called the bandeja paisa or paisa tray. This is pretty much a tray of food mainly composed of a huge piece of grilled thin steak or carne asada accompanied by white rice, red beans, fried egg, pork rind, (**takes a breath**), chorizo, sweet plantains, corn arepa and avocado. Yes, ALL of that. My BF really likes it but I just think it's ok. But to be fair that is on me because I'm not a big fan of rice and beans which is a big part of this dish. Yes, I'm hispanic and I don't love rice and beans. So, I like the meats but the arepa not so much.For drinks get one of their natural juices.

People were pushy and we being polite Asians just stood there for a few without giving them our name to put on the list.  That bought us another 15 minutes or so longer wait but hey I'm on vacation so it's all good.  After almost an hour wait, we were seated by the very overwhelmed hostess and giving menus to look at.  From what I have heard, they have just moved to this location from a smaller location and still adjusting to it.  Anyways, the main signature dish here is Eggs Benedict with any topping you want.  I had the simple Ham and Cheese and my niece ordered it with arugula and my brother in law ordered it with mushrooms.  They all come with your choice of sides like steak fries, salad or something else.  Of course I wanted the fries.  The Eggs Benedict was AMAZING! Totally worth the hour wait.

Unfortunately today was a huge miss.I schedule recurring team lunches and Steel Toad is in the regular rotation because of its close proximity to our office. I make resos (via Open Table) and getting a table is never an issue as it's usually pretty empty at noon.The food is fine, the drinks are fine, and the portions and prices are fine. Food is neither outstanding nor terrible, and it's consistent. The issue is always the service. Sometimes I've been blown away by awesome staff; I've had hostesses and servers proactively ask me if we're on a work lunch so they can make sure we get served and our bills in time to get back to work. Tap & Barrel also does this, but much more consistently.However, today's server was incredibly apathetic. I had to ask her to take our lunch order (as we had ordered appies and drinks initially), and at 12:30pm mentioned that we would need to be out by 1:30pm so we could get back to work. Despite everyone arriving by noon, one person had to ask for his meal to go because he needed to be out by 1pm; getting his bill took a while, and then it was another wait to get the machine to pay. I then had to ask for bills for the rest of the table at 1:15 and they didn't get to the table for over ten minutes. (In the server's defense, she did say there are two new managers who are still ramping up and that slowed the process down.)Friday at noon means there will be a large contingent of local professionals who have carved out time for a longer lunch but by no means have all day to wait around for refills, food, or bills. The dining room was fairly empty and servers seemed to have plenty of time to stand around at the bar chatting or watching TV, so the lackluster service was not a result of busyness. I don't anticipate keeping Steel Toad in our regular rotation of spots for lunches or drinks."},{"name":"Powell's City of Books","address":"1005 W Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"I want to go back....

When I first started going to Clementine's the thing that urked me the mopst was the music.  The baristas were always kind (especially Polly), the food (especially the pumkin muffin and grilled cheese panini) was always pretty good, but the music was simply obnoxious.  It wasn't until I visited the Green Muse down in South Austin that I recongnized why they play the type of music and at the volume that they do.

I have been to this Five Guys in Kyle about 8 times since they opened. I have spoken highly of them and told others positive things. With this said, I am not pleased and am planning on taking my business elsewhere next time. The positive is that the employees are always polite and the burgers are tasty. But the cons are pretty aggravating. Twice now I have ordered a large fry. Each time I'm warned that this could feed 3+ persons. I order it anyway. At other locations this would get you a large cup of fries with just about as many again just loosely in the bag. Not at this location. Tonight I even asked an employee....as I opened the bag....\\"is this a large\\"? He replied yes sir and I left. This was the equivalent of two fries at most fast food restaurants. This is approaching $6 for fries. Add this to the fact that their burgers are not cheap. Get a Cheeseburger and your spending about $7. They are pretty filling....but there is another place....a local place in Buda that starts with a \\"D\\"....where you get way more bang for your buck. One final addition to this rant. Most of the time Five Guys overcook their fries....to a dark brown...rendering the potato flavor to the proverbial back seat. I can forgive the overcooking as being preference...as many people rave about them...but I don't see anything special personally...and find it especially aggravating to be shorted after settling for a taste I already feel is not as great as the hype.

Started out good with drinks and oysters.  Salads were fresh, tasty and BIG.  Then the disappointment..... took over 25 minutes for my steak and my wife's lamb shank to arrive post salad. Noticed other tables who sat after us getting food.   Had ordered a beer to go with my steak...painfully sipping it to make it last.  Finally got attention of waitress...\\"Oh you meals will be  out in a minute\\".  10 minutes later the main course arrives and it's solid but not great.  No apology for the wait.  When she reappears I ask \\"is it normal for a party to wait over 25 minutes for their main course\\"?  She replies, \\"oh we have a small kitchen and a big party arrived so we got backed up\\".   Huh??? Why do you have so many seats if your kitchen and staff can't keep up?  Would have been more forgiving if they were proactive and came to us letting us know and offering an additional drink or whatever.  They did take apps off the bill so made an effort but ONLY after I raised the issue.  That bumped them from a 2 to a 3.  Would I go back....probably not.

It included mushrooms, artichoke heart, asparagus, broccoli, olives, beans, and arugula.  It's very light seasoned with salt and vinegar, and the combination was just amazingly delicious.  As for the two entrees, they were both incredible.  As Italian food tends to be heavier, both pappardelle was perfect in balance of flavors.  Pappardelle funghi e salisiccia is pretty much with a creamy tomato sauce, delicious sausage ish meat balls, and mushrroms.  The sauce, the meat, and the pasta were all so delicious.  It goes the same for the seafood pappardelle, which basically had all different types of seafood.  Its flavors were so balanced, neither too heavy or light, and the salty sweet were all just perfect.On top of that, the service was also amazing.

It pains me to give two stars (if the wings weren't alright it would be one star), since I like the wings here and have had them several times before. I was actually happy to hear they were a chain because I liked their wings when I was living in NY. Anyways, a freezing cold night and a Bruins game meant I was going nowhere. DELIVERY! My mistake. Previous experiences with WOS showed me that they are consistently late on deliveries, even with a 45 minute wait time. I ordered one combo Hangar I- 15 BBQ wings, fries, soda ($13.99). An hour and 15 minutes later I called and was told they had arrived and nobody was home. Weird, cause we had 4 people here, a phone, and a doorbell. They said they had called but I had no missed calls. But OK, mistakes happen, nobodies fault. They apologized and said they would send me fresh ones. Awesome. An hour goes by. Nada. Nothing. Zilch. I had to call again to make sure they hadn't forgotten. They seemed disoriented and surprised I still hadn't gotten my order. It came 5 minutes later. I mistakenly thought they would maybe try to be a little quicker after the first error. They said \\"sorry\\" and... well, that was it. Maybe it's me, but when I tell you \\"I'll probably never order from you again\\" I hope you would try to do something to change my mind. Nope.Overall, the wings were fine and I expected them to be cold after all that time, but they weren't. The fries are sub-standard but I don't order WOS for the fries. If you don't mind shoddy service and slow delivery, it's not bad, until you find something better.

I loved the intimate dining and ambience of this authentic Italian restaurant (there was even a sweet Italian waitress, who was very sweet and remembered us from our previous visit). I felt like I was back in Europe. I would recommend making reservations, even on week nights this place fills every table and there isn't a place to wait, I suppose in the spring and summer you could wait outside, but I have only been in the winter each time we got lucky with the next available table but waited in our car for 20 minutes one time and somewhere between 30-40 minutes the other. We knew each time that we should have had reservations but we're hoping for the best and we were willing to wait. Defiantly smart to call though, the second time we left them our number and they called us when our table was ready, but we were fortunate to get a parking spot right in front so we saw as well.  \\nI want to add, I have cancer and my mobility  is pretty horrible at the moment and they recognized that and ask if the chair was going to be okay, if there was something they could do and then helped me with the door when I was struggling. Also, my stomach has been very sensitive and eating out can be a challenge, I need to watch what I eat carefully and fresh high quality ingredients are a must, Ristorante Roma m delivered just that.So service was excellent, and the food, divine! \\nThe complementary bread was very fresh with balsamic vinaigrette, then I ordered a side house salad to start it was simple and perfect just what I was craving, it had mixed greens with arugula and fennel cherry tomatoes and a nice balsamic vinaigrette dressing.\\nAs a main dish I ordered tucine ai Frrutti di Mare\\nFresh fettucine, it came with fresh clams, mussels, shrimp, calamari, tomato, garlic and parsley.\\nThe seafood was cooked to perfection. \\nFor dessert I had the chocolate tartufo which had been a favorite childhood dessert that I hadn't seen on a menu for years and trilled to find it again! \\nBringing up my sensitive stomach again, seafood is usually something I have had to avoid but I was craving this type of meal, the ingredients were very fresh and absolutely not \\"fishy\\" at all. My mother accompanied me each time, she started with a different salad that we have since mimicked. I couldn't find the salad on their website but it was a different kind of salad, with no mixed greens but there was arugula, fennel and I think the main ingredient was an orange, and the dressing was very good, we saw it on someone else's table first, looked so good we had to try it! She ordered the gnocchi, perfect pillows  in a parmigiano, Gorgonzola, Mozzarella and Pecorino cream sauce. The second time going I ordered the same thing and then I was with two others, we tried the minestrone soup, Fettucine Bolognese, and\\nFunghi e Salciccia which is Fresh Pappardelle with mushrooms and sausage in a creamy tomato sauce. Also, on the menu the pasta I ordered (the fettucine with the shrimp, clams...) was actually originally written that it came with a different pasta but I asked if I could change it to fettucine, the first time I ordered it I had it change to the pappardelle pasta. So when they can, they are accommodating.

Each drink ordered has a refined taste from the first sip, to the last. My only concern is that it's about $10 per drink.Atmosphere: Very hustle-bustle. One thing I immediately noticed, is that everything is raised up. Seats are taller, tables are taller, the bar is taller, even the wait staff and the customers are taller! It looks really small from the outside, but when you walk in, it loops around to the back.Staff: Very friendly staff. Everyone from the hostess, to your server, to your bartender will talk to you. They're really dedicated to service (which is why I had to give them an extra star for effort).Final Thoughts: I have not found a better oyster bar, and might have to come back soon.

With so many options I never saw the need to get any. But, if you have a picky eater in your party who doesn't like sushi then maybe the hibachi would be nice for them. Then, next to the hibachi is the holy grail: SUSHI. Please queue and be polite, don't go in the middle of the line and grab at sushi at random. They have basic maki rolls and then the fancy ones with colorful fish and garnishes and sauces. There is also some nigiri. Then there is a small isolated offering of sashimi, followed by a giant glob of wasabi and arrangement of ginger for you to grab as needed. There is a row of different salads, from ordinary garden salad to exotic seafood salads. Then, there is the hot food bar which has tempura, roasted fish and meat, and standard Asian buffet offerings such as dumplings and noodles and rice. There is also a dessert bar but the sweets aren't so great. They, too, are standard buffet offerings and are sometimes a touch dessicated.

It's an authentic small family run business, and I must say their food feels very homey. I must warn you that if you are the princess type and attention needed, this is definitely not the right place for you, as this is a place that is run by a small family, meaning that there is only one server even on their busiest. I'm guessing that the same middle age lady that has served us for the longest is the owner/waitress, she is always very busy running around taking orders, delivering the food and cleaning up tables, and usually she won't come to refill your water, you must request it from her.... being as busy as she is, she mostly doesn't have a big smile to spare, but if you ever stop her and compliment her for their delicious food, she would definitely blush and show  a shy smile. I have to write this cos I have seen other bad reviews to complain about her being rude and service being slow. I just wanna clarify that she is not rude at all, she is just super busy. Service is a bit slow cos the whole restaurant is run by probably 3 people as I have seen most of the times I've been there, it's so unfair that they get bad reviews when they are just trying to survive.\\nTheir food is very heartwarming, I usually love to go there on chilly winter days, one of my favorite dishes would be the seafood pancake, it's pretty crispy and has the right amount of frozen seafood.\\nI also like ordering their individual sized pot soup, their broth is really tasty and it also comes with one bowl of rice and 4 veggies side dishes that are refillable on request. On my opinion their house made kimchi are even tastier than the ones I have tried in Korea, we also love the sweet potatoes side they provide, I swear I can eat a whole pot of rice just with those yummy sides, that is how delicious they are. Their beef short ribs are also on our list of must have, they are well marinated and juicy, that makes me drool every time I think about them. \\nI definitely recommend this place, it offers good food at a good price."},{"name":"Brothers Kouzina","address":"25 Newbury St","city":"Peabody","stars":"4","text":"Was there for dinner last Sunday with my family, food was amazing!

In Amerika ist sie schon lange ein beliebter Trend. Mobiles Essensangebot, dort wo ein food-truck h√§lt. In Portland ist dieser Trend bereits einen Schritt weiter.Aus verschiedensten Gr√ºnden hat sich in Portland eine station√§re food-truck Szene gebildet. Am Rande von gro√üen Parkpl√§tzen haben sich food-trucks dauerhaft niedergelassen. Sie sind au√üerordentlich beliebt, zu Lunchzeiten bilden sich lange Schlangen vor vielen St√§nden und die G√§ste warten gelassen auf ihre Bestellungen.Wir haben einen Guide bestellt, Brad B., der uns √ºber einen food-truck Markt f√ºhrt und uns Einblicke in und hinter die Szene gew√§hrt. Au√üerdem lernen wir viel √ºber die Entwicklung dieser M√§rkte. Einige haben bereits Kult-Status erreicht und haben neben ihren kleinen \\"Niederlassungen\\" nebenbei oder zus√§tzlich noch ein richtiges Restaurant. Die food-trucks werden von den zust√§ndigen Beh√∂rden regelm√§√üig gepr√ºft - h√§ufiger √ºbrigens als Restaurants - und man kann unbesorgt alles essen, die Hygienebedingungen sind vorbildlich.Ein gro√üer Vorteil ist die Preisgestaltung. Schaut euch einfach meine Fotos √ºber die Preisschilder vom Small Pharaoh an. So √§hnlich ist es bei allen. Die Bandbreite reicht von Deutschem Bier und Bratwurst √ºber mexikanische K√ºche, persische, Burger, Latino, japanisch, chinesisch etc. Hier findet jeder seinen Geschmack.Die Portionen sind gro√ü und Preis-/Leistung hervorragend. Hinzu kommt, dass die ausgewiesenen Preise Endpreise sind. In Oregon gibt es keine Mehrwertsteuer auf Waren und Dienstleistungen.

Always first-class service, stock, and everything else. I even worked for them for a while (the Beaverton suburb of books, not the iconic Portland City of Books) and that was a wonderful experience, too. Powell's is not just a great tourist destination or cool place to hang out; it's a great place to browse books and buy them. Online and off, I should add. Without wanting to complicate matters, I often prefer to read a book in digital format (I travel a lot), and Powell's has all the books for digital download. No need to shop at a store named after a river in South America. You can get them all from Powell's.I should have added that Powell's carries used books, and often at deep discounts. I read books for their contents. If someone has spilled a little coffee onto the text block or left the cover out in the sun so that it has faded, I really don't care. The author wrote the book on a typewriter or on pieces of paper in longhand or on a computer screen. To the author, the book appeared as text without benefit of book designer or cover artist. Like the author, I want to see the content of the book in the raw, not after embellishment. So, a badly used copy is fine for me. Hence, I cannot say enough good about Powell's. Powell's will give you the best in customer service and reader's advisory with the added benefit of immediate possession of the book in new condition or in whichever used condition you want.I should add that I have shopped at bookstores around the world and online, and many of the greatest have gone down, but Powell's continues to thrive.

I used the broth as a flavor enhancer for my rice. \\nMaybe because my expectations weren't so high the food ended up surprising me. Who knows, but I definitely enjoyed the food this time.

Something about their cook hadn't shown up or something, but no call from them.  It was really their fault.  When I go in to try the comp'd meal after a game they didn't follow up on their offer and made me pay.  Not only that but my noodles were not all the way cooked.

Just amazing...."},{"name":"Hae Woon Dae","address":"5805 Buford Hwy NE","city":"Doraville","stars":"3.5","text":"This used to be my favorite Korean BBQ place. I've been here a lot throughout the years for special occasions. I've introduced my friends to it  and they loved it. We've recently gone back and felt disappointed. It wasn't the same anymore. This is the first time I felt I got the non-Korean treatment. You know, the discrimination of Korean restaurants to non-Korean speaking customers--when the Korean servers bring less side dishes, not give you good service, don't give the \\"extra\\" goodies you usually get, and so on.Of course, whether there really is a such a thing as the non-Korean treatment can be disputed. I have seen it happen a few times many years ago, but I think they would wise up over the years. Anyway the complaints: usually when we come here, a 1:1 ratio of meats to people was enough (1 person orders 1 order of Korean bbq). We get our fair share and we leave satisfied. Not this time around.We did our usual 1:1 ratio and everyone was left hungry. Even the skinny little girl with the stomach size of  a pea to the biggest bottomless pit eaters. Why was that? Well, they were obviously skimping out on our meat.  What's the result? Same high price for less the meat. Also, they had like 2-3 servers for the whole restaurant. More specifically, they had 1 main server and 2-3 bus-boy/girl type servers. That 1 main server had to run around and prepare the meats for everyone. Which means the service suffered. Our waters didn't get refilled, our side dishes and lettuce weren't replenished at a good rate, and our overall experience disappears.The service sucked so bad that we didn't get our rice until our third batch of bbq was done. That's not acceptable since traditional Korean BBQ needs rice. Also, our daenjang stew came until all our food was gone. That stew should traditionally come during the meal, not afterwards. And I had to remind the waitress 3 times to get it for us. But she seemed hesitant to get it until the very end. Also we're suppose to get the bones and connective tissue at the end. She didn't even offer that to us either.The conclusion? THE SERVICE HERE SUCKS WRINKLY DONKEY BALLS. Usually, I would've given this place 4-5 stars. The food still tasted pretty good. But with my last experience, I have to give it 1-2 stars. But with my long history of positive experiences with this place, I'll just give it 3. I might go back later (much later) to give it another chance. But if they don't shape up, I won't hesitate to re-review it and give it 1 star.But now it's time to find a new Korean BBQ place."},{"name":"Dish Dive","address":"2233 College Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"The service was poor and is the only thing that really threw my experience off.

I like the convenience of picking them up quickly at the Lenox Mall kiosk. I have tried Laduree and other bakery brand macarons in Paris and Manhattan. I have tried other macaron offerings in Atlanta as well (Alon's, Cacao, Mozart's, etc.). I like the Macaron Queen's macarons quite a lot because of their flavor variety and affordability. The prices are actually quite fair; Laduree and other high quality macarons sell for $2.5-$3.5 per piece. I love the prices at the Macaron Queen so much, and that's what keeps me coming back (I wouldn't devour 15 macarons in a day if they were $3 per piece.. well, hopefully not..).Your cheapest option is actually the smallest count bag: $3.75 for a 3-count bag ($1.25 per piece). The per-piece price goes UP as you choose larger bags, which I find ironic... (it goes up to $1.5-$1.8 per piece). They claim that the macarons are a little bit bigger in the boxes and larger bags, but I find the size differences negligible, at least for my own enjoyment. Supposedly from their website, this pricing scheme is based on weights, but I think it should be based on counts, as each macaron with a unique flavor is what constitutes the macaron experience (a little bigger bite doesn't add too much to the happiness, but another one with a new flavor adds a lot of value to the consumer).I am aware that FDA regulation prohibits handing out individual macarons at the kiosks, but just like many other reviewers here, I wish I could get only the flavors I like. In every bag, there are always a few flavors that I don't like. For example, in a 8-count bag, the best I can do is a bag with 4-5 flavors that I want. The rest 3-4 flavors are unwanted and I wish I could get more of what I like for the same price.To solve this problem, I suggest they create 1-count pre-packaged bags for all of daily flavor offerings. They could be priced at $1.25 per piece / choose 10 for $12. If the extra packaging cost makes this less profitable, they could look for a cheaper packaging material, or even $1.5 per piece / choose 10 for $14 would do just fine I think.Another way would be creating 2-count bags for the same flavor. This will allow me to happily choose only the flavors that I like. And doubling up on the flavors I like is not a bad idea! The same strategy works for 3-count bags (and I have seen and loved their 3-count bags of just Lavender and 3-count bags of just Rose), but I think 3 macarons of one flavor is too much, and having these bags for all flavors would take up too much room in the fridge.The pre-packaged bags with assorted flavors was a great idea to begin and get the word out. But now that there are many repeat customers, they will have to create new flavors and allow the choice of flavors on the spot if they want to retain the loyal customers. If they don't, and offer the same old flavors in the same old pre-chosen way, some customers will inevitably go away.I hope that as they expand their business and hopefully add more fridges, they will be able to come up with a way for us to pick the flavors. And keep coming back. And keep coming back! :)The flavors I have tasted are:Lavender\\nRose\\nCreme Brulee\\nCaramel\\nCaramel Chocolate\\nSalted Caramel\\nNutella (new!)\\nBaklava (new!)\\nChocolate Chip\\nHazelnut\\nCappuccino\\nAlmond\\nPistachio\\nCoconut\\nCoconut Chocolate\\nBlueberry (cream cheese filling + blueberries)\\nRed Velvet (cream cheese filling)\\nRaspberry Lemon\\nChocolate Raspberry\\nWhite Chocolate Raspberry\\nWhite Chocolate Mango\\nStrawberry Shortcake\\nItalian Strawberry\\nPassion Fruit\\nKey Lime\\nLemon\\nVanilla\\nChocolateAnd I think I have seen Orange and Orange Chocolate from a while ago... but not recently, and my memory may not always be correct."},{"name":"The Daily Catch","address":"323 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Well worth the LONG wait on Good Friday night.

She totally \\"gets it\\".  The kitchen was having an off night, so to speak.  A group of diners sent back their food as they said there was mold on the bread (sandwiches).  The kitchen seemed not to be concerned as to how this happened, but that they didn't want something else.  I am from Mississippi so I am familiar with this cuisine and ordered the Etouffe with the Bayou Bread as presented on the menu.  They tried to give me grilled white loaf bread as they didn't want to have to \\"waste\\" the Baguette for Po'boys on my etouffe...after letting me know I would be charged for an additional side after requesting extra bread as I was getting it to go.  Finally they decided they could bother with cutting a few pieces of Winn Dixie bread and grilling it...and charging $1 per slice for extra..even after the aggravation.  The etouffe was too salty, but had nice seafood and consistency and was a decent portion.  Why the nickel and diming over bread is really aggravating.  I spent $25.00 for dinner to go.  I felt bad for the server so I sucked it up.  In retrospect, I wish I had left it all on the table and just tipped her out but it is a neighborhood place and I would like to go back, hopefully with a better experience."},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I seldom sit down to eat here.

I also like the crunchy marinated carrot/ radish veggies that come along side the wings. Order a side of rice to make it a meal.

The main course we got Halibut, $36, it was not the best. For example, they put lentils under the fish--thats two proteins (fish on top of lentil)--big no no. Fish goes with some vegetable or carbohydrate like garlic mashed potatoes not lentils. So they need to rethink it this. Also, the while the fish was fresh, it was not marinaded in anyway. It was just put on the grill and cooked and put on a plate. They really need to rethink how they serve. They have the right ingredients but they have to put more thought into serving. Fish HAS to come with some type of carb (mashed potatoes) or vegetables (like steamed asparagus), not lentils. Check out Blue Point Grille in Princeton NJ which is the best fish serving restaurant I have come across (and I love fish/seafood). 3.5 stars for Island Creek Oyster Bar."},{"name":"Subway","address":"12518 Research Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"2","text":"I love subway.

Dining at Mitchell's Steakhouse in downtown Columbus was a great idea.    Two friends in CBUS from Nashville treated me to dinner at Mitchell's.  My view of two lovely ladies was terrific and the meal made my life superb.  The ladies had petite filets while I dined on salmon.  One petite filet (ordered medium rare) was seen moving on the plate - truly, it could have been sent back but my friend opted to eat around the center.  Too bad.  The other filet and my salmon filet were top-shelf.  Add to the \\"meats & seafood\\" two sides; one of creamed & gooey spinach; one of jalepeno scalloped potatoes - wonderful.  The potatoes were down-right spicey; I loved 'em but some might find them over-the-top hot.   Our post-dinner selections were Bailey's & coffe along with a creme brulet and some apple bread pudding.  Juicy, sweet, hot, steamy.... whoops.  We held our acts together even though two glasses of wine and the later consumed Bailey's had us reeling a bit.  Mitchell's is very appealing to the eye.  We ate in the bar-area which was terrific.  The dining room had sections that allow for privacy, intimacy and openess.... all in one.  I was a lucky guy having two gal-pals to my left and right which made the Mitchell's experience great.  And my palate thanked me, too.  Delicious.

If you don't want to wait, come before they serve alcohol!Like some of the other reviews on here, the service was slow. I sat there for a few minutes before being greeted, but he may have waited for my fiance to park the car before stopping by. Although the service was slow, our server, Edward, was great! Super friendly and chipper, and made sure we were taken care of. I think he's very well liked around the Nook because I saw him talking to several people between rounds. Nice to know we got a good server!We started with coffee and OJ. I wanted decaf coffee for some placebo effect buzz, but they don't serve decaf... Strike one! So, I went with OJ instead. Thankfully, it was fresh squeezed and only tasted like fresh squeezed oranges. Very, very good and refreshing! However, it took an unusually long time to get our drinks.I ordered the Two Egg Breakfast with Delia's chicken sausage. The only downside was some of the sides were cold, and others were warm. Like they made some things, put them on the plate, and made others. My eggs were warm, but my hash (hash browns with potatoes, not corned beef hash) was cold. Not a deal-breaker, but something to address with the kitchen.Fiance ordered the fried chicken and biscuits and gravy. His chicken was really good, but his gravy was cold. He got another one sent out from the kitchen (that took awhile to get out here) that was piping hot that made a difference.And, part of the reason why we came in here is because the owner, Katherine, left us a gift certificate based on our last review. Thankfully, the manager on staff was able to find it and credited our bill! If I'm in the area, I'll be back! Food and service were good, despite being a little slower than I anticipated.

The food was delicious but the servers were lazy and uninformed. I'd been looking forward to Suzette Creperie's NYE four-course dinner all week, kicking off the evening with great friends and food was a great intention.  The meal started out warmly, waters  and cocktails ordered followed Crab Beignets, which were well seasoned but on the doughy side.  The Radicchio Salad combined sweet pomegranate seeds with a creamy dressing, light and flavorful.  The service to our table was noticeably lacking (strange as the establishment only had one or two other tables seated), there were empty water glasses and missing utensils but the great company I was in filled the place of the meager attention from staff and I made no complaint.  I am still unclear as to whether we were assigned a server.  The main course, Duck a l'orange, arrived after a time and was savory and succulent.  MUnfortunately, when asked questions about the dish, the person serving had no answers, and only knew what they were serving us after looking at the menu. This was laughable to me as all nine of our party ordered the same set Special NYE meal.  I heard one of the servers complaining about how she didn't want to be there- the scowl on her face reaffirmed her words.  I ordered a cup of coffee and soon the Chocolate Hazelnut tart arrived.  This dessert was delicious, rich and decadent with its cognac cream.  At the end of our meal, we hailed for our check to be brought and it came on one ticket.  Our table asked for the check to be split up, a common request, I'm sure.  This simple task (we all had the same meal and only a few drinks would need to be sorted out) seemed too daunting for the server and she gave up decidedly after she slammed the remaining check amount on the table and stormed out.  The scene was confusing and amusing at the same time.  The checks came with three gratuity options, with the 20% already checked, a bit presumptuous.  We were all glad to exit Suzettes, but not willing to let the terrible service ruin a great New Years Eve.  A couple of my friends wrote reviews as to the poor service they received on NYE as well.  Some of them were charged the wrong amount for gratuity, even though they made it clear as to the amount they wanted to tip.  The manager/owner responded to the review by ludicrously accusing our group instead of acknowledging and addressing issues with staff and service.  I hope the manager will read this review and think about how better train and inform servers so that others that visit Suzette Creperie can have a better experience than I did."},{"name":"The Daily Catch","address":"323 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"$$ is NOT correct.

When we (threesome - senior couple, and daughter) walked in for the first time, for lunch the other day, we were impressed.  We arrived at the restaurant just before it opened at 11:30am, and were their first customers of the day.  We did notice at that time, that the larger tables had 'reserved' signs on them, and by the time we left, the restaurant was busy, with only a few of the smaller tables left vacant.  The staff were very friendly, and our server very helpful.  I explained that we were newcomers - to both the restaurant and Thai fare -- I had brought a list of potential dishes to order (gathered from their website), and with her assistance, worked through the list and ordered.  Thanks to some pre-dining research, and her help, the ordering went smooth & easy -- we wished to sample a variety of offerings, and that's exactly what we did.  Plus, with this being our first try and tastes, we decided to go with 'mild' hot & spicy (note:  after eating, we know that would be definitely be taken 'up' a touch (or two) with a subsequent visit).What we ordered and shared:  --  appetizer:  paw paw tod (crispy spring rolls) --  yum (salad):  som tam (papaya) --  tom (soup):  tom yum (hot & sour, w/chicken) --  gaeng (curry):  gaeng kiew wan (green, w/beef) --  pad (stir fry):  pad thai (w/prawn) --  rice:  coconut rice --  tea:  jasmine.Our thoughts on the dining experience:  several lovely presentations of food, with each carrying such a wide-array of wonderful flavours.  These were our first tastes of Thai fare, so I really cannot say much about the actual preparations (with no other experiences to compare such), but I think we did good in ordering, so that we could and did 'sample' a good number of dishes and their individual flavours.  If I had to pick what was enjoyed the most, it would be the spring rolls, hot & sour soup, and the pad thai.  We liked the curry, but having it along 'with' the other dishes, I think spoiled the impact of it's own particular flavours a touch.  The rice was fine, though we sure didn't need it (but it was brought home, and tasty for dinner!!).  The tea though, was quite awful -- small tea bags & cups of semi-hot water - good grief!!  with this quality of food, and prices being charged, some 'real', loose, jasmine tea leaves in a pot, would have been in order and much more appropriate!Thai food, and the Thai New West restaurant were on our 'to-try' list.
