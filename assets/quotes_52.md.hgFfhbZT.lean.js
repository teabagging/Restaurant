I don't flippantly make negative comments, however, I'm ok with saying this restaurant \\"kinda sucks\\" because it has \\"kinda sucked\\" for many years and I'm pretty sure the establishment is complacent with where they are at. \\n\\nI like a few of their sushi rolls but some of their dishes such as the chicken wings didn't taste all that good.  In fact, they were a lot worse than wings I microwaved from Costco.   I wish the food was better because this restaurant has the ambience of a fun place to go with friends.  Most dishes tasted \\"good enough\\" but I think all dishes should taste good.  I've eaten here about six times over the years and it's not the worst, nor the best Japanese food, especially for the price. \\n\\nRestaurant staff:  A combination of lack of common sense and the possible language barrier meant that seating arrangements and orders took longer to execute.\\n\\n\\nKaraoke:   There is a minimum food order for the karaoke room.

My hubby had the grilled trout with asparagus, crab, grainy mustard buerre blanc and I had to stop myself from finishing his meal ...Shawn, our waiter, clearly himself a foodie, gave outstanding food and wine choice suggestions, and helped us plan our succeeding restaurant forays as well as the highlight visit to the hilltop Domaine Serine winery.  I realize I deviate but what I hope to impart is that food is not the only reason I loved this place. The service was memorable. There is no sales tax in Oregon so the bill was a pleasant surpise.

What's more impressive is their beer selection with a variety of several types of cheap beers for the already drunk college student just looking to keep his buzz going and wallet full, and more sophisticated beers for those who prefer their beer with flavor. Though it's a veritable schmorgasbord of bar food and beer the prices may not always agree with a college budget. \\n\\nThe ambience varies depending on the day and time of night you find yourself stumbling into this place but for those who enjoy something new and a good brewed beer this would not be a bad place to stop off. As a student who lives on campus it's for the sake of ease, The Barrelhouse is close and the beer is pretty good for the price. Usually if you ask about their specials on tap it comes out to be about $5 per pint, which for a decent beer isn't bad.\\n\\nAll in all, a decent addition to the Tech Square family but if you're willing to walk a few blocks up there are a flurry of bars that, in my opinion, are better and more reasonably priced."},{"name":"Bondir Cambridge","address":"279A Broadway","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"real food. creative food. delicious food. non-pretentious. wonderful presentation. fine dining without the snobbery. charming atmosphere. lovely, kind, engaging staff. go here. worth it."},{"name":"Tasty n Alder","address":"580 SW 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Great atmosphere.

MANY times I have seen 4-5 staff members just standing there with no customers, yet tossing my two cookies in a bag takes 10 minutes to get (any one of them standing around could have done this in 5 seconds). I understand the concept of functionalizing responsibilities, but if there are no customers in line other than those waiting for their food, the staff members doing nothing should help with getting the orders to waiting customers quickly.

The guy behind the bar could not look less enthusiastic and interested if he tried. He looked truly miserable. My friend and I ordered drinks (huge fan of the pomegranate cider- must try) and then ordered single slices, which are pretty big... About 2 slices of normal pizza, for $5. While that sounds like a great deal, when I thought about it it's really not from where I live near NYC. \\nAnyway, I go to pay my $10.25 bill and give the waiter $15 expecting to get some change and some dollar bills back to tip with. He gives my friend her credit receipt to sign, and then walks away for a while. I eventually ask for my change and he looked at me for a second like he was surprised I was asking for change and then slowly makes his way towards the register to get me a $5 bill. And then I had to ask him for singles so I could tip... It was a horribly awkward encounter because it was OBVIOUS to me and my friend that he basically gave himself a 50% tip. But for the service and friendliness (or lack thereof) he was not getting 50% on any day. Anyway, pizza was pretty good. I'm a big critic of pizza, being from NY , and I think it was a little burnt, and hard to fold such a large piece because of how burnt it was.

One of my friends favorites was on no longer on the menu and she mentioned it to Chef Jacob Hough who came out to chat with us and told us that he would make it for us on our next visit if we let him know a day or two in advance.  Everyone from the valet, to the bartender, to our waitress, to Jacob were very personable and helped make the night special.\\n\\nOf course there was the food; we chose to go with an assortment of tapas and many were so good they deserved a second order.  Favorites were the Costillas (braised short ribs in a blue cheese mushroom sauce), Croquetas (fried ham and cheese croquets), and Calamares Fritos (calamari) supported by a selection of Spanish Olives and Peppers, Humus and delicious bread and cheese.  \\n\\nIt was the perfect setting to get together with friends, share a great meal and was the setting for a memorable evening.

For the record, one can get in through an alley sidewalk over to the Fred Meyer's parking lot (it's more obvious from the FM side).  One then walks through the brewing hall into the downstairs \\"pub\\", which reminds me of a motley pizza parlor with booths, long tables and some arcade games, which is only three-quarters finished.  There is also a full service bar with some stools at the counter; this area is fairly small, but looks professional enough.  The overall vibe is laid-back and unpretentious.\\n\\nThere is also a stage for live entertainment; when I was there on a Sunday afternoon, there was a folky band doing a faithful and pleasant enough rendition of Ventura Highway.  I'll take faux America music over arcade game noises any day.\\n\\nThe bartender was very friendly and accommodating; answered all my questions and got me going right away.  The place generally has about 11 of their beers on tap on any given day, and has a printed menu there of, along with food specials, which is helpful.  The selection of beers is quite diverse.\\n\\nAs a few others have said, the food seems slightly on the high side, cost wise.   There are, however, happy hour plates of food for less, and apparently Tightwad Tuesday is essentially happy hour all day long.  However, only their three mainline beers are at the $3.50 HH price; the others range from $4.50 to $5.50 per pint/teardrop/glass (depending on type).\\n\\nI had a glass ($5.50) of the Cascade Kriek Cherry Ale.  It wasn't bad, but certainly not as good as the Kriek Lambic from Belgium, and actually seemed a little watered down and muddy in flavor.  I also asked for and was given a little tasting glas off the McShagger Scottish Strong Ale; this was mighty tasty and full-bodied.  Don't know if they have sampling trays/flights, but it does seem like you can get a taste of a couple before committing to a pint or teardrop glass.\\n\\nThe research staff will, no doubt, get back to the place soon to do a more comprehensive review.

They have a new location opening in Gahanna relatively soon so I would say be on the look out for that. One thing I would say to keep in mind though is that if you go any other day than Sunday then I would try to figure out parking ahead of time and the wait was about 30 minutes because the place is so small, but very popular. While you're waiting there's no place to sit so be prepared to stand for about 25-30 minutes depending on your wait time. Overall, it was definitely worth the wait and I truly enjoyed my experience.

I've nerver had \\"authentic\\" Southern bbq before, but I imagine that Redbones is the closest you can get to it in ol' New England.  The ribs and brisket are all dry rubbed and slow smoked at the restaruant with a choice of 4 sauces served on the side so you get the taste of the meat without the sauce covering it up.  Even if you're not a bbq fan, you should go here just for the amazing selection of 20 quality draft beers.  No Bud or Miller Lite on tap here! just quality domestic microbrews and flavorful imports. The taps are changed constantly so the beer you got one day may not be there the next day.  The only two beers that are always on tap are Guinness and PBR.  Not the cheapest place but the prices are average for bbq and drafts around Boston.  That said, the all-you-can-eat lunch served until 4 is $9 on weekdays and $10 on weekends.  One of the best lunch deals in the Boston area.\\n\\nThe upstairs bar serves food and has two televisons constantly showing sports.  Great place to grab a bite from the reduced price late-night menu and watch a game.  Downstairs, \\"Underbones\\", is much more \\"hip\\" and caters to the college crowd.  Whimsical, colorful, artwork by Charba covers the walls and a jukebox provides the background noise, if you can hear it over all the chatter; it can be a crowded late-night spot on the weekends.\\n\\nI've been going to 'bones for the past 7 years and there has been a slight but noticeable change.  As the tv and newspaper reviews keep praising this place, the lines get longer and longer.  There's a wait for a table every night now as opposed to just the weekends a few years ago.  With this increased popularity Redbones has made a good effort to expand their menu.  They now have veggie burgers and vegetable kebobs every night and nightly comfort food specials like roast turkey dinners and salmon steaks."},{"name":"Neptune Oyster","address":"63 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"One of the perks of working a night shift is that you get to try the places you love without the usual long wait. With a beer or two on tap, followed by nap. \\n\\nI like Neptune oysters for their consistently great oysters and friendly and attentive service despite being always busy in a small space. \\nThat being said, the last time I went to Neptune was over a year ago, always deterred by the thought of waiting in a long line. \\n\\nLuckily we were seated at a bar within 10-15 minutes of checking in around 1pm on a cloudy Tuesday of May. The average wait this time of the day seems to vary widely - we sat at the outer edge of the bar (great seats with the view of the street without getting too crowded with people coming in) and saw locals and tourists coming in in groups of 2-4, with estimated wait quoted as anywhere between 15-60 minutes. A tip from Neptune staffs - the best time to come is between 3-5 pm, almost never a wait, which I guess isn't a surprise. \\n\\nEnough about difficulties getting the seats at Neptune, and moving onto the food. \\n\\nWe started with oysters. They have standard New England oysters from ME and RI (and PEI), and a few selection from the west coast. We went with two ME, one RI, and two West Coast oysters and every single one of them was perfectly fresh and delicious. \\n\\nOur hot starter was the Johnny cake - if you haven't had it yet I recommend trying it. It's like a honey buttered pancake with smoked sturgeon and caviar spread on top.  An excellent balance of sweet and salty note in a comforting buttery heaven. \\n\\nI was perfectly happy at this point, and while our meal took a significant downhill from here but I still left happy and full. \\n\\nAfter eyeing the PEI mussels, as it's very hard for me not to order mussels in a reputable seafood restaurant, we opted for the Tuesday special, sea urchin ditalini. I love good sea urchin and I would try almost anything with sea urchin. It was described to us as elbow pastas smothered in sea urchin butter with sweet pees which is prepared similar to carbonara sauce. Disappointingly it was a very unremarkable and watery dish. Had I not been sitting in the Neptune oyster bar and happy on oysters and Sam Adams honey IPA, I might have thought this is an acceptable pasta dish for a dinky college or hospital cafeteria. I might be too harsh here, but I could not taste any sea urchin in the dish, overpowered by bacon swimming in watery carbonara-like sauce. \\n\\nThe last item of the lunch was hot buttered lobster roll. I always feel obligated to try signature lobster rolls in the most popular places in NYC, boston, and other cities I visit, but I admit it's hard for me to feel blown away even with a perfectly fine lobster roll. Here at Neptune they do hot (with butter) and cold (with mayo) versions, and my boyfriend suggested trying the hot lobster roll instead of the usual mayo based cold one. It was okay, a hot buttery bun full of plump lobster meat, but again I wasn't super impressed and next time I'm here I'll order other items on the menu before ordering a lobster roll. But that may be just me not being a fan of lobster rolls in general. \\n\\nThe service was very friendly, attentive and prompt, which makes it a perfect weekday lunch spot."},{"name":"Cattle Ranch","address":"2700 S Sanford Ave","city":"Sanford","stars":"4","text":"Great food and atmosphere. Definitely a great idea to come here tonight."},{"name":"Redbones BBQ","address":"55 Chester St","city":"Somerville","stars":"3.5","text":"Redbones is great for BBQ meats and the beer list is fantastic.  And SUPER SECRET TIP (well, maybe not so secret), the \\"Somerville Cheesesteak\\" on the late night menu after 10:30 is the best value meal in all of New England - for $8 you get two enormous slabs of brisket on a sub roll and smothered in cheese.  Mmmmm.  But their regular dinner BBQ is all a bit expensive, and I find that their other sides and things are sub par, which is really a huge bummer since they should enhance the whole meal.  Plus the place gets awfully crowded and hot in the summer.\\n\\nTo be a little more detailed, I've had all of their various ribs, pulled pork, chicken wings, and brisket, and they are all phenomenal.  There are 3 different BBQ sauces that you can then dip your meat in, sweet (Texas style molasses based), or hot/mild (Carolina-style vinegar based, one with extra cayenne),  At around $17-$20 for a BBQ \\"dinner plate\\" (which includes beans, slaw, and corn bread) it can get expensive in a hurry, but you do get a lot of food.  And their sandwiches are decently priced at around $10 each though.\\n\\nAs for the sides, I would not recommend anything with cornmeal in it.  They are unnecessarily stingy with the cornbread and it's always dry anyway, as are the hush puppies and corn fritters.  All of them are so thick and dry you need 2 beers to get through an order.  The mac n cheese is also entirely bland and doesn't differentiate much from a box of Kraft.  The fried pickles and okra are decent.\\n\\nSince I live in Davis, I have made and will continue to make Redbones a weekly tradition.  Is it the best BBQ in the world?  No.  Is it very good BBQ?  Yes."},{"name":"Bondir Cambridge","address":"279A Broadway","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"The locally-sourced food is terrific and the staff very friendly and knowledgable, but dishes emerged from the kitchen very slowly and erratically, so that half our table was served and the other half left to wait.

I am not a vegetarian but I ordered Baingan Bhartha (eggplant dish) that was served with rice and a red, sweet, tomatoe-like sauce (did not catch the name.. will definetly ask the next time I am there). I ordered the Baingan mild and it had a bit of heat to it. I truly ENJOYED my meal. The flavor was so authentic. The red sauce had a sweetness to it that complimented the spice of the Baingan Bhartha perfectly. It honestly was my favorite part of the meal. There was enough Baingan for me to bring home and I made two meals out of it. \\n\\nMy husband had the Chicken Tikka (Tandoori). The chicken was marinate in yogurt and spices prior to being baked.

Meanwhile, three other groups of people came in, sat down, ordered and received their food before us; yet the waiter somehow found the time to stop by all of their tables several times in between.

Well, I pay retail at the downtown farmers market every weekend, and I can verify that one can obtain a bag or basket containing about 30-35 brussels sprouts for $3. A wedge of superb quality blue cheese sufficient to garnish portions as served by Patrizi's can be found for $5. That brings the cost at retail prices (wholesale even cheaper) to $8 for four portions, and even once one adds in labor and taxes, it is easy to see that the margins are absolutely ridiculous given the tiny size of the dish. It seems silly to go through the math, because even a quick look at the plate is sufficient to make the point. As they say, a picture speaks a thousand words, so have a look at the photo and then judge for yourself whether Patrizi's is competitive with other high-quality, local-ingredients-focused food trucks around town.\\n\\nPatrizi's, if you're reading this: please do not rest on your laurels.

Been several times in the few months I've lived in the area and I've never known them to serve one with any of the common kolache fails (overbaked, dry or \\"biscuity\\" dough,  and dry or flavorless sausage). Only suggestion for improvement would be to start making the sausage in-house.

So I couldn't decide which plate to get so the waiter asked what do I want and I said I'd love to just have some shrimp and some brocolini, and he said ok, done. Just like that. So I had just that. The blackened shrimp with brocollini. And it was out of this world. The blackened shrimp wasn't black or charred or anything but it had a wonderful blackened flavor and was moist and juicy. The brocollini was saut√©ed just right but it had a little too much salt in the flower part of it.

The Grand Floridian Resort is really nice, upscale and you do feel like you're in the Hampton's.  It was a good thing we actually dressed up for this dinner but the actual restaurant itself wasn't as nice as California Grill or Jiko's.  Since the restaurant is located at the back of the resort on the water, it has panoramic views of the Seven Seas Lagoons which was really beautiful at night; you can see lights from the surrounding resorts and Magical Kingdom.  What was also really nice is that there's a deck surrounding the restaurant, so before the fireworks start head out and grab a spot.  The music that goes with the fireworks is also played out on the deck which is great and makes the experience much more magical (California Grill didn't).\\n\\nWe started off with Cripsy Crab Cakes and Ceviche.  Crab Cakes themselves were yummy but the accompanying slaw was not, it was a bit overpowering and didn't pair well with the cakes.  The ceviche was really good and I finished every last bit of it.  The tilapia and vegetables were favorable but not too tart/acidic but my avocado wasn't ripe, the plantain chips were yummy too :)  \\n\\nFor entrees we stuck with seafood since it was the restaurant's speciality, we got the Maine Lobster and Surf & Turf.  BF said the Maine Lobster was delicious and the best he had, it was fresh and had a great favor.  It was really nice that the lobster came all cracked and cut already so there was no fuss while we were in our 'fancy' clothes, lol.  However, his potato gratin side wasn't good at all, we couldn't put on finger on it but it was not delicious!  My Surf & Turf was really filling with a lobster tail and TWO medallions of filet.  The lobster tail was fresh and enjoyable but if compared to the Maine Lobster it wasn't as favorable and a bit chewy.  The filets were smaller than other filets I had at other WDWRs, but there were still cooked well.  But for some reason I really liked my potato gratin side, not sure if it was the presentation or the browned edges that made it taster, hah :)\\n\\nDesserts were also yummy, we got the Creme Brulee Duo and Almond-Crusted Cheesecake.  The Creme Brulee Duo came in key lime and coconut, the coconut was really good, not too intense and went really well with the texture.  But the key lime wasn't as enjoyable, somethings about a tart flavor and creaminess doesn't pair well with my tongue.  The duo was a really good deal since you got two regular size creme brulees for a price of one ;)  I will always like cheesecake so of corse it was delicious!  The almonds were a good substitute for an gram cracker crust and the fresh whipped cream was delicious but I didn't enjoy the cherry sauce that came with it, good thing it was placed on the side :)\\n\\nOverall the dinner was good and a bit disappointing.  The service was ok, our server was quite slow, forgetful and wasn't as nice as the others we had at WDW.  When I booked the reservation I marked that it was for an anniversary and requested for a window seat.  So upon arrival our menus had 'Happy Anniversary' on them which was really cute but I didn't get an window seat I requested for. However, when compared to California Grill and Jiko's it clearly ranks third.  I just felt like there wasn't anything new or different to the palette.

I was on a diet so I am carefully watching what I eat. Also we have kids so we can only spend so much time in a restaurant. They brought our kids food out first which was great. However it took an hour after that before our food came out. When it did come out, it was the wrong dish. Instead of grilled it was fried and other difference that make a big deal to some one dieting.

You go into her house, and everything is the same.  It has the same smell, same look, same friendly, welcoming vibe.  When I walk into NO, I feel at home.  Maybe it's because it's so familiar to me having gone there for so many years.  Maybe it's because there is a ton of family history oozing out from Neptune's--my grandfather used to take my mom here when she was a kid, and my mom did the same for me.  Regardless, I love how I feel when I come to Neptune's, not only because the food is delicious, but also because it is so comforting.\\n\\nJust like I do when I visit home, I want to eat the same thing upon each visit.  That means classic clam chowder with oyster crackers piled in, causing the chowder to ooze out over the top of the cup.  Sharing a plate of fried oysters with my dad, extra tartar sauce and lemon.  Scarfing down a lobster roll--toasted bun, cold with mayo.

Here I am finally writing this review. I've been familiar with Redbones ever since my first year in Boston (5 years ago) when I had the unfortunate experience of meeting one of the owners, who I found rather detestable. As a Cambridge resident now, I've met far too many people who share that opinion to think that I was too quick to judge. \\n\\nHOWEVER this review isn't about that. It's about more recent events. \\n\\nI've had major service mishaps occur two out of the past 4 times I've been to Redbones, all within the last 2 months. \\n\\nThe service is ENTIRELY hit or miss. I've had great service, terrible service, rude service, mediocre service, incompetent service - you name it. I was completely pissed the last time I brought a group of friends here and we tried to order whisky after dinner. We wanted Redemption Rye. They were out. We wanted the next rye on the menu. All out. Turns out they had no ryes. So we moved on to Bourbon. Basically, we requested SEVEN different ones before deciding to bag that idea, because apparently they don't keep any of that stocked. Well here's a clue, guys, take it off the menu. The server didn't know what was available and what wasn't, so everytime we asked for a different whisky it took 5-10 more minutes before he came back to tell us it was a no-go. Uh uh, Redbones. Not impressed. Then it's time to go, so I asked our server for my dinner (I had ordered dinner To-Go about 2 hours earlier, and told him to bring it out when we were leaving) only to find out that it had never been rung in, never been made, and the kitchen was closed. So it's coming up on 1am and I have no dinner to bring home with me, not cool.                                      \\n\\nSo. If your liquor storage room is empty, and your servers have a propensity to screw things up, you'd have to be a patient, hardworking and talented manager to try and field all the customer whining. Now, I've done my time working in restaurants, mind you, so I'm not a picky customer who gets angry easily, quite the opposite. However I was definitely upset and I asked for a manager. She came over, heard what happened, and magically made ribs appear. I was so relieved. I know that customers can suck and there are a lot of managers who won't bend over backwards to make sure everyone leaves happy, but this manager does. I have to say that Sam (I think she's the bar manager? Not entirely sure) handles issues graciously and seriously, taking care of business and putting smiles back on people's faces. It can be a tough job, and I just wanted to put it out there that she has resolved 2 separate issues for me, and has made all the difference.\\n\\nThe basics:\\nThe food is decent. Well, it's tasty, but it's completely over-hyped, and I think of Redbones as a fuel-up spot rather than a dining experience. Get in, get out, hope that I'll find an interesting beer. \\n\\nThe beer: while Redbones has a large collection of rotating drafts, I'm not sure there's any rhyme or reason to what beers they choose, or to the timing. There are typically beers on tap out of season (ie. Imperial stout in July), or not a good enough selection (ie. half of the taps will have IPA's on them) and sometimes it's just pure chaos. Sure they lean towards local breweries, and I can usually find something I want, but I somehow always find myself wishing there was more thought put into their draft list. \\n\\n3 stars breakdown:\\n5 stars for Sam, no stars for being out of every whisky on your menu. 3 stars for the service, 3 for the food, etc."},{"name":"Neptune Oyster","address":"63 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"My 4th time visiting Boston and I was determined to try the famous Neptune Oyster.

The fried chicken is ridiculously moist and tender and well seasoned and crispy. Put it all together with cheese and a fried egg and you'll never go home again. The sandwich is nearly too tall to fit your mouth around, so prepare to get a little dirty. This is a place to eat with friends, not someone you're afraid to drool a little in front of. The house made andouille corndogs are shockingly savory and perfect when doused with honey and whole grain mustard. The shrimp and grits are some of the best I've ever had.

I love it!  Their pizza is greek style, so don't expect it to be comparable to Mellow Mushroom, Papa Johns, or other American-Italian pizza joints.  The crust is slightly yeasty and has a mild tangy taste that seems to  be infused with air bubbles.  It is much lighter than most crust and I would consider it to be \\"thin\\" crust but not crackery.  Clearly the dough is house-made fresh daily and has tasted exactly the same since I first went there as a kid.  Consistency is a favorable and admirable strongpoint of this friendly, family-run restaurant.\\n\\nThe best part is they have KALAMATA olves and FETA cheese.  Tangy, salty, YUMMY.  I've been eating their pizza, always with just Kalamata and Feta, for about 30+ years which is most of my life.  It is wonderful, thin pizza done in the Greek style, so if you're looking for thick, doughy crust...go elsewhere.  If you're looking for New York style...go elsewhere. It is a little bit hard to explain how their pizza is different from your typical American-Italian pizza, but I can't imagine that anyone would dislike it.  You just have to know it will be a different look, texture, taste and topping selections when compared to what most people are used to eating.\\n\\nTheir lasagna is GREAT and is a really huge portion...more than most could eat at once, especially with the salad it comes with.  The wine list leaves much to be desired, however.  The red Greek wine I ordered was AWFUL, and they don't have many selections.  But that doesn't really matter much t me anyway...just don't expect fabulous alcohol selections.\\n\\nBy the way, their pizza is AWESOME streight from the fridge the next day!!!"},{"name":"Taqueria Star","address":"343 S Congress Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Taqueria Star has ruined all other Tacos Al Pastor for me... in the BEST possible way.

Wait... awesome might be a bit of a misguidance.  They were friendly, warm, welcoming, and enthusiastic about the service and product they were providing.  Not like the top front inflated waitresses at certain restaurants that sit in the booth and touch your arm trying to making you think they are exited about over sugared mass produced food.  These people really were excited about the food that was coming out.  \\n\\nAs an example of what I mean, because I am failing horribly at trying to described how much the staff loved the food they were serving, I will give you a story about an incident that occurred during our visit.\\n\\nThe person that accompanied me on this visit looked on the internets to peek at the menu on our way to the restaurant.  She's a mega-foodie and a bit of a nerd, so pre-planning her dinner order is not out of character.   Oh, side note, at the Scratch, the menu changes, often.  In a good way.  \\n\\nShe saw that there was Risotto.  She instantly became even more excited.  We got there, found a couple open slots at the bar.  Had a seat.  I took a few minutes to look over the menu, while she impatiently bounced in her seat waiting to order her meal.  The waitress/bartendress came over and we gave her our food and beer picks.  The waitress gushed at how incredible the Risotto was.  I told you, these people are genuinely excited about the food.  There was a couple to our left that had ordered the Risotto, and it came out and looked incredible.  \\n\\nThen the waitress returned with sad news.  That dish she just delivered was the last one.  They ran out of ingredients.  (Again, this is late night dining, and this was a top selling dish).  My date was heartbroken.  The waitress was also emotional about not e being able to deliver the clear winner of dish of the day (possibly year... maybe even decade).  The waitress went back to the kitchen and demanded to know from the chef/cooks, what would be an acceptable replacement.\\n\\nDisheartened but not broken, my companion dug into her mac and cheese, and the epic taste sensations helped to lift her spirits back to the glory of being a foodie nerd eating late night food that was worthy of the praise of the chef I mentioned at the beginning of this tome.  \\n\\nIn summary, it's just damn good food that is prepared and served by people that love damn good food."},{"name":"Pizza Mia","address":"915 N Anchor Way","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Had the BBQ chicken pizza was pretty awesome, should note it is brick oven made, service was good, would eat here again."},{"name":"Cheese Bar","address":"6031 SE Belmont","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Cheese...\\nA lot of cheese...\\n\\nThis place lives up to its' name, Cheese Bar.

Two tables were sat on either side of us about 5 minutes later. Within 20 minutes both tables were both served their meals while we sat with empty chips and salsa still on our table. When my tea glass was about 1/4 from being empty, our second and final waitress brought ice to add to my tea glass rather than tea itself. At that point I was asked, what did you order again? Really? A server brought us our food and after having to wait for almost 40 minutes to get our food, we began to dig in. The person who ordered migas asked for additional tortillas and after 10 minutes passed with no waitress or server in sight with his tortillas, he ate his cold migas. We finished our meals with good food in our belly, empty tea glasses and disappointment on our minds.\\n\\nI'll go back with hopes that the service is better, because the food was fantastic."},{"name":"Portland City Grill","address":"111 SW 5th Ave, Fl 30","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Great food, great view, great service.

Ate a pastry, had a cappuccino, and a few drinks.  Now came back and told another 45 minutes.  Fine - waited in the park and people watched.  Came back and ended up waiting 3 hours and 20 minutes total for a seat.  It felt like a miracle - like winning the frickin lottery.  Now we were seated and ready to order.  Had a couple of nice glasses of white wine.  Now the main courses....\\nThe branzino and the lobster roll were great and well priced for what they are.  You can read in detail about the lobster roll in other reviews.  My mom got the roasted 2 lb lobster at market price.  At an amazing $55 this dish sucked.  Actually, at any price point it was terrible.  How do you destroy a perfectly good 2 lb lobster?  You put it in the oven till it looses all juiceness and until it's tough and rubbery - too tough for the knife you are trying to cut it with.  Really disappointing since we were expecting an expertly cooked piece of lobster.  It's not hard.  \\n\\nService was meh.  The waitresses are obviously over extended.  Forgot my glass of wine until I repeatedly asked about it.  They're kind of snappy when you ask how long more you have to wait for obvious reasons (how many times a day do they get asked this each day?).  \\n\\nAnyways, not likely to repeat and do not recommend with the plentiful other restaurants in the North End.  If you do go, send a single person at 3:30 or 4:00 pm and then go and hang out somewhere else for the 2+ hours you wait for a table.\\n\\nLobster roll raises it to 3 stars.  Otherwise it would have gotten 2 stars in my book.  Still not worth the wait.

A downside was that he ordered it medium rare, and it was definitely more on the rare side.

The girl behind the counter took my order with great impatience, and then everyone just went back to doing what they were doing before.  After standing there for 15 minutes I asked how much longer I would be there and the clerk spoke to me in a very rude tone, saying \\"You ordered a hot sandwich, it takes time.\\"   (Which is fine 5-10 minutes, but I had not seen anyone making my sandwich, just filling the catering orders.)  At this point I said, clearly that they were all having a bad day, and could she just give me my money back so I could leave and have time to find lunch somewhere else.  Then the clerk told me my sandwich was ready, when it clearly was not ready.  A couple minutes later another staff member walked over with the sandwich and wrapped it and said they didn't have any pickles, and was that OK?  I said, \\"no\\" I just want my money back so I can leave, please.  At this point the other staff in the back said they had not made up any pasta salad yet so I would have to wait for that too.  I then said again that I would just like my money back since I was in a rush.  She was extremely rude and told me, \\"I suggest that next time you don't order a hot sandwich.\\"  She handed me my sandwich, pickle and pasta salad (which they pulled out of an old container from the back) AND my money.  I gave my money back and left.  Until the staff in this store learns that they need to respect their customers and not treat them like they are non-existent, I will not be returning.

The taste really isn't as good as nearby Blue Ribbon, not to say how it stacks up against real BBQ places a bit farther south of New England, but somehow it's still addictive. Lunch is rather disappointing - the menu has only 10 or so items, and the \\"combo platter,\\" which is an assortment of ribs and chicken, seems to be the leftovers from the night before. No wonder it was only $8.99 for a huge plate at lunch (don't expect those cheap prices for dinner, however). In the basement is \\"Underbones,\\" a fun place for friends and Davis Square locals to eat BBQ pub grub and drink from Red Bones' healthy (and rotating) selection of 24 brews.

The service is hit or miss - I've walked out of Red Bones more than a few times complaining to friends that I'll never go back due to the service, yet the draw of the food, the generous portions, the easy location, and the uniqueness of the venue in the middle of New England makes me return once every few weeks."},{"name":"Wendy's","address":"16220 Se 82Nd Drive","city":"Clackamas","stars":"3","text":"My wife and I visited on Wednesday August 18th at lunch time, 12:15pm.

I'm so sorry I went and subjected my family to such a poor experience. First, I'll say that my family has breakfast meet-ups all of the time and with all of the places we've been, we've never experienced such terrible service AND food. \\n\\nOverall ambiance: It's okay. The inside is colorful and they try to make it happy with the whole creole/NOLA theme. The drawback is the loiterers and panhandlers in the strip mall where they're located. I'll note that we experienced the sit-down side of the restaurant since we had a large group, but they do have a carry-out side which is separate customer access. \\n\\nService: With a few of us having arrived at about 9 AM, things started out okay. The waitress was friendly and warm. We ordered the requisite coffees, drinks, etc. and waited for others to arrive. When our group started to get larger, that is where the problems began. It was painfully obvious that they are used to having no more than a couple of folks in this restaurant at a time; however, that is ZERO excuse for poorly trained wait staff and terribly executed services. You're a restaurant. You can't expect that it's always going to be slow. You never know when you're going to have a group. Get it together. The waitress, while her attitude stayed consistently great (definitely a plus and the ONLY reason I tipped at all), did horribly. She never came to check on us or refill drinks/coffees unless called over to the tables. A different, shorter and older lady started out taking food orders. She took one table's order then promptly disappeared. Then, the young girl came back, taking orders. She obviously, had not been trained on how to keep orders together by table. By the time we all finished ordering, it is now around 10:15 AM. Crazy. After waiting about an hour for our food, few people were satisfied. The waitress brought out food sporadically. She had no idea which tables which plates of food belonged to and kept calling out orders and confusing things. Ridiculous. To add insult to injury, when we were finished, we had to go to a counter to pay instead of getting table service for our checks. The older lady got really rude toward the end which was comical, since she should have been glad we didn't walk out. By the time this nightmare ended it was NOON. Yes. We were there for 3 DARN HOURS.\\n\\nFood: The beignets were just okay. They were small pieces and way over-powdered, but still tasted pretty good. That's where it stopped. So, I'll say we ordered coffee and were asked what kind of creamer we wanted. One of the people at my table asked if it was non-dairy and the waitress didn't know. She then brings out entire containers-full of powdered, fake, non-dairy creamer in Kroger containers. No ... don't do that crap. Off-putting. Water was gross--no filter and straight from a tap. Grits were inconsistent. One person said they were good, a few others turned their noses up at a plop of mess. I sent my entire plate back. The pancakes were flat and greasy. It is not difficult to make a pancake--most 8 year-olds can do this, no problem. My eggs had a green tint to them because they were not scrambled but sitting in a pan to just cook and were probably not fresh. They claim they have turkey sausage, but one person said she literally spit it out since it tasted like hamburger. No way that was turkey. Gross. \\n\\nIn conclusion, I definitely try my hardest to support local joints, including women and minority owned places, but I will never be able to support this mess."},{"name":"Blue Star Kitchen + Bar","address":"4800 Burnet Rd, Ste C-300","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Why would you jeopardize your tip and repeat customers by being deceptive?

Thought mushroom might be the dominant flavor but it was actually a blend of several different flavors -- salted greens, slightly sweet ricotta (or is it the roasted onion that's sweet), parmesan with a bite. Either way, a great combination that took a couple of bites to absorb all the flavor.\\n\\nThere are two or three tables outside and a number of tables indoors, mainly for smaller groups of 2 to 4 people.

I got their chicken bacon ranch sandwich with some water which btw tasted like it ran through the orange juice line, that or they gave me a used cup cause it was sticky which was odd given it was water. So i tried their mixed drink which was like pop soda do to the missing alcohol, and then i get over charged by like 35 bucks.

I grew up on it and know and crave good seafood.\\n\\nI must say that this restaurant served probably the best seafood I've ever had in my life.  \\n\\nMy husband got there last night (on a wet October Wednesday night) at 8 pm.  It was an hour wait, so they took down our phone number and we walked over to Mike's to actually have a little dessert first.\\n\\nRight at about 9 pm when we were gonna get seated, a guy walked in and said he had a group of 3.  The host/server told him that they were full for the night.  Poor guy! He walked away looking so sad.\\n\\nAt the bar, we saw a couple who ordered the grilled lobster, which looked amazing.  It was probably a 10 - 12 inch pan (like a round pizza pan) of grilled lobster in its shell, veggies, and clams.  It looked amazing.  But when we sat down and asked about ordering the $50 treat, they said they were out for the night. :(\\n\\nSo I asked our server what other goodies she recommended.  She said the cioppino is really good - lots of seafood and rice that was spicy like New Orleans cookin'.  So my husband jumped on that, since we love spicy food.\\n\\nAnd boy was it amazing!  There were about 3 types of fish on our plate (about 2 inch pieces), 2 big fresh plump shrimp, 2 plump clams, lobster pieces, and rice soaking in really good broth that was actually spicy!  We were in heaven.  I even asked for spoons so that we could drink the broth/sauce with our food.  I was amazed at how plump and juicy both the shrimp and clams were (the shrimp was firm and crunchy, which is a sign of freshness!).  The fish were good too. \\n\\nI've had lobster rolls up and down the coast of Maine and even at the famous Red's Eats (supposedly the best lobster roll in Maine).  I liked the roll at Red's, but found that my lobster would've been SO much better had it been hot instead of cold to dip into my warm butter.  The lobster was really good, but cold.  It was a bit disappointing.\\n\\nSo last night, I ordered a hot lobster roll.  It was amazing!  The bun was toasted and buttered on the inside and outside.  I had to eat it with a knife and fork, since it was so buttery.  The lobster was sweet, hot, and evenly buttered.  They were cut up into small pieces that were evenly buttered, though not dripping.  It was so perfect, and the pieces of lobster tasted amazing, even without the bread!\\n\\nAnd I forgot to mention that we ordered a few oysters off the check list they gave us before our meal.  The descriptions of the taste of the oysters were right on!  One of the ones I got was the one that was sweet, creamy, and had the honeydew melon aftertaste.  It was by far the best oyster I've ever had!  Very plump, sweet, juicy, and creamy.  They were extremely fresh and tasted clean.\\n\\nJust a hint, try your oysters with just a squirt of lemon juice instead of putting all that other stuff they give you on it.  I'm bit of a purist about some foods, and I like to taste the food and not cover it in sauces.  A squirt of lemon juice was just enough to let me taste the oyster and all its flavors.  If you're getting great quality oysters, skip the sauces and use just lemon juice to really taste the flavors (which is what you're paying for anyway).  \\n\\nOur whole meal was about $100 with tax and tip.  But my husband remarked on our way out that it was worth every penny.  When I go back again, I wanna try the lobster grill.  If not, the cioppino would be at the top of my list since it was SO good!"},{"name":"Manuel's","address":"310 Congress Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Awesome food, drinks and service.

Super loud, raucous and generally fun atmosphere, even though you may feel like you're eating elbow-to-elbow with your neighbor.  I came here on a Saturday night with 3 others and we had to wait 40 minutes for a table.  The place was packed to the gills, with people spilling out onto the sidewalk. Since it was the first visit for most of us, we took about 30 minutes just to decide on what we wanted to eat (given the vast menu of meats and side dishes), so the wait was tolerable (we had drinks in hand too).  Overall, I think the food is a pretty good deal for the tastiness and amount they give you.  Great to go with groups since there's lots of booze, and there's bound to be something for everyone on the menu so you can share platters.  I like the fact that they let you try all the sauces and you can mix and match different combos.  It's definitely not the best BBQ I've ever had, but it's pretty decent for Boston.

It had been quite a number of years since I had darkened their door as the last time I went I had found it trendy, overpriced and rather unremarkable. But, given their staying power, I went for brunch hoping things had changed. Alas, not so much.\\n\\nWe started with a cocktail each. I had a Bloody Mary. It seems to be an article of faith among restaurateurs in Atlanta that if the most or only identifiable ingredient in your mix is Worcestershire Sauce, then you have succeeded. How about some celery salt or black pepper or horseradish or lemon juice or Clamato juice or some Old Bay Seasoning or something beside Worcestershire? Both my companion and I are light weights when it comes to alcohol. We never have more than two drinks each, if we drink at all. That said, I am going to assume that Murphy's uses a one ounce pour as really couldn't tell if there was vodka or not in the drink. Contrast that with the brunch cocktails served across the street at La Tivola where one drink each had us both feeling right happy. My companion's Peach Bellini likewise didn't phase him in the least.\\n\\nOne last thing about the Bloody Mix. They bill their mix as \\"house-made.\\" First of all, i despise that term as it sounds ignorant. \\"Homemade\\" is fine. \\"Murphy's own\\" Bloody Mary Mix would be fine. \\"Specially Prepared\\" would be fine. You get my drift, right? But here in Atlanta, the current ignorant craze is \\"house made.\\" And why would you want to claim mediocrity as your own?\\n\\nBreakfast bread is served fairly immediately, almost as an amuse bouche. You get one biscuit and two small corn muffins. The butter and jelly presentation was nicely done. I will give them that. But what if I had wanted my own biscuit? Biscuits are not a high food cost item, let's be real. But it was not to be so we split the lone biscuit. And the corn muffins were small enough to inhale and mostly forgettable. \\n\\nWhen you have finished with your breakfast breads, they quickly remove the bread basket, your butter plate and then put your used knife with any remaining butter and jelly still clinging to it back on the table top. Let's be clear, shall we? It is never OK to lay used flatware back on the table. Ever. It is ignorant and lazy and unacceptable. That many a restaurant does it does not justify it. If you have any sense at all, leave the damned butter plate on the table so the dirty knife will have someplace acceptable to rest but laying it back on the table says all the wrong things to me as a diner and having spent years working in hospitality, no one will ever change my mind on this, feel me?\\n\\nMy companion ordered the \\"Classic Burger\\" which was OK. Not particularly big nor particularly remarkable but he was happy as he ordered it medium and it was served cooked the way he wanted - medium. But there are a number of places in town where you'll do much better as far as burgers go. But served with home fries, the entry was nicely presented and he was happy enough.\\n\\nI asked our server about the Chilaquiles. Her immediate reply was that it was her favorite. My question now would be, \\"Why?\\" The official description is - \\"chicken & tortillas, over-medium eggs, tomatillo sauce, avocado, sour cream.\\" There were two - 2 - small crouton-sized pieces of chicken buried in the tomatillo sauce. There were no tortillas, period, although cannot imagine why one would need them. There were a couple of green sauce designs on the left side of the bowl. On the right there was a small amount of a really tasty red tomato salsa. And at One o'clock there was an inordinate amount of a rather liquid sour cream.  There were also two of the smallest pieces of avocado I have ever seen gracing the top of the dish along with one egg over easy so the description that says \\"eggs\\" is a misnomer. Egg singular. They should stop buying their avocados from Sysco and get them from Trader Joe's. That way at least a slice of avocado might be worth serving. Mostly there was tomatillo sauce which two hours later is still sitting like lead on my stomach. Needless to say, I would not recommend this dish.\\n\\nThe Key Lime Pie was equally heavy and not terribly limey but they serve a huge slice of it. \\n\\nIn fairness to Murphy's, some of the other dishes we saw come out of the kitchen looked very good. Perhaps we just ordered the wrong things. But after spending $70 (including tip) on brunch and leaving unhappy, I am not in any rush to go back and spend that kind of money to see if I was wrong, much less venture something as daring as dinner.\\n\\nThey are making money hand-over-fist as the place was busy. And maybe I just ordered the wrong thing. But I will never understand why it is so difficult in Atlanta to find a really great, much less exceptional, dining experience. But if IHOP can turn out a chicken fajita omelette made with, as they call it, shell eggs, and make it a worthwhile meal, sure as hell some of the upscale restaurateurs can too."},{"name":"Kkoki Korean BBQ","address":"10325 SW Canyon Rd","city":"Beaverton","stars":"4","text":"Finally my 3 months long anticipation has been rewarded.

The food was excellent, especially the calamari appetizer. The waitress made a fantastic wine suggestion. The view was second-to-none. \\n\\nNow, riding the high of the Portland City Grill dinner we decided to try their happy hour, big mistake. I had heard it gets busy so we arrived about 20 minutes early and we're first in line for the elevators downstairs. Once they opened the elevators everyone became very desperate to get on all at once. My husband held the door for an elderly couple and as a result we were a little later arriving to the bar than the other elevators. When the doors opened I was taken aback, people were running to their tables. We were lucky enough to get the last table next to a window, which was my whole reason for coming. Before we even had a chance to order we were approached by a girl sitting with a group at a table a little further inside the bar area. She asked if her and her friends could have our table when we were done with it. Again, I was surprised but we promised it to them after telling them we planned on taking our time. Well, over the course of the rest of the evening we were approached 3 more times for our table! And after we turned down each of those requests the girl from the first table would come back over to make sure we were still going to give it to them.

Perhaps that's the nature of the boil and I'm just not into it, but would it really be that hard to even just take the heads off if not fully de-shell?  The bigger problem is that it meant the shrimp actually didn't take on the flavor of the sauce at all because I ended up discarding so much of it on the shells, and then had to actively dip the shrimp in sauce to get any flavor.\\n-The catfish po' boy - again, the fry batter really had no seasoning.  It's a big sandwich for sure, but it just wasn't all that flavorful.  We've made better fried catfish at home, actually.\\n\\nThe bread they served with the boil dishes was delicious.

There was one other person in this HUGE restaurant, and the first thing I noticed was the overwhelming smell of cigarette smoke, which was funny because there are No Smoking signs everywhere. Perhaps they forgot to tell the staff?\\n\\nWe contemplated leaving, but decided to stick it out.  They have a full bar, so my husband ordered a cocktail and I ordered a glass of Chardonnay. There are no names of wine, just type. Merlot, Chardonnay, etc. It wasn't awful.\\n\\nWe ordered our steaks, both petite strip steaks, both with salads and buckskins. Now that I type that, I realize that's never happened. We never order the same thing! Weird!\\n\\nOur salads came first, very cold, very crisp salad, and served with brown bread.  The salads were on the smallish side, but very fresh and tasty.  The bread was served with butter.  The ends of the bread were a little stale, but the rest seemed nice.\\n\\nThen our food came.  When our server set our plates down, she asked if we wanted any steak sauce or ketchup.  I usually eat my steaks with A-1, so I asked for that, as well as ketchup for the buckskins.  By the time she came back with the A-1 sauce (which was about 60 seconds) I told her I didn't need it.  The steak was THAT good.   Perfectly cooked.  Perfectly seasoned.  Perfectly perfect.\\n\\nThe buckskins were fried and crispy and delightful.  The apple sauce was ice cold and delicious.  I ate everything on my plate, which I never do.  It was SO good.\\n\\nFor dessert, our server told us they had homemade peach cobbler with ice cream.  Oh boy.  My husbands favorite.  He had to have it.  I will say this.....their peach cobbler is second only to my own.  Very, very good.\\n\\nI WISH WISH WISH restaurants like this would update their restaurant and give it a face lift once in awhile to bring in new customers.

The oysters are expensive but if you're willing to splurge they are amongst the best prepared in the city of Boston. Menu items that are favorites are the Warm Lobster Roll (incredible) with poached butter and my personal favorite is the Burger... For an oyster place this burger seems to come out of nowhere but it gives ever burger in this fair city a run for its money. The meat is well flavored and cooked to perfection, the fried oysters and tartar sauce toppings are unique but the flavors meld as if they've been together forever.

The garlic fries are pretty tasty but I remember them being a tad soggy once. \\n\\nI came here again while out shopping around Bridgeport and was a little less impressed from how I remembered it. The house salad for $7 was nothing I couldn't have made at home for a third of the price. The calamari was ok. A bit chewey. The Chipotle aioli was a nice touch. The Fish Tacos were pretty good.\\n\\nThe service is hit or miss as well. I've had a couple instances where I had wonderful service and a couple times where it was super slow.

The \\"highest\\" level (closest to the entrance) is taken up almost complete by a giant bar.  The washrooms are also on this level. Not sure about the ladies' side, but the men's room is so tight that you can't even turn around.  The 2nd level has a giant TV (with some problems with picture quality), and the 3rd  (lowest) level has another bar, with a giant projection screen.\\n\\nToday (Friday) the beer specials were 1516, and Farmhand Ale.  The ale wasn't bad, and was slightly bitter. Not at the same level as an IPA though.\\n\\nFor food, I had the steak and fries.  The steak is one solid piece. Beautiful.  They let us substitute fries for the yam variety.  On top of the steak was a flat round slice of something.  I thought it was cheese, but it was actually dill butter.  Yikes.  The fries were covered with garlic and green onions.  Super tasty.\\n\\nI also had a spicy chicken quesadilla.  Yup, this one is spicy.  I really liked how they didn't go too crazy on the tomatoes, as that normally turns the outer tortilla into mush.

This building has got to be at least 100 years old.  The way it is set up reminds me of an old fashioned patchwork quilt.  Homey and comfortable.   We started with the antipasto, which was really good.  Not a celery stick or carrot in sight.   This plate was full of meats, cheese, olives and marinated veggies.  My husband had the calzone and I had a seafood spinach saute.  He really like the calzone and took most of it home, since he filled up on the sourdough and antipasto before his meal. The seafood spinach saute was good; the seafood and veggies were prepared in olive oil and garlic and then served on a bed of fresh spinach.  It was beautiful to look at with the different colors and textures, however, it lacked a few cloves of garlic for me.  I will certainly ask for extra garlic next time.  It was fairly busy on Saturday night and we still got our food in a reasonable amount of time.  The wine list is small and not impressive, but there was a few acceptable choices to complement most meals. Finally, we shared a slice of chocolate cheesecake for dessert and it was sinfully good.  We will go back for sure, since it was a nice evening with no kids and no cell phones.

It's been in the Atlanta area for many years, previously located in Virginia-Highland, and part of the \\"101 Concepts\\" network of restaurants which include Cibo e Beve, Smoke Ring, and Meehan's. When it comes to New American farmstead cuisine in Sandy Springs, Food 101 is one of the only options.\\n\\nThe restaurant has a picturesque, contemporary, and open space.  Indoor and outdoor seating is available. When the weather is nice, the bar doors open to create a relaxing open-air bar/patio.  It's a refined restaurant with a casual atmosphere.  There are TVs at the bar, including a large projection screen. The main dining room has these cool elevated curved booths with exposed bulb light fixtures. There's a room in the back which can handle large private parties of up to about 40 people.\\n\\nFood 101 serves seasonal, local fare. I've been for dinner where prices for appetizers and small plates range from approximately $5-15 each and entrees range from $15-30 each. I've tried:\\n\\n\\"Small Plates\\"\\nPickled Beets - feta cheese, rocket greens, fig balsamic\\nButternut Squash - fall apple, goat cheese, spiced pecans, cider gastrique\\nBeef Carpaccio - red onion marmalade, horseradish aioli, French bread\\nCrispy Chicken Skins - spiced honey & white barbecue sauce\\nAhi Tuna Tostadas - corn tortilla, avocado, radish, cilantro sour cream\\nRoasted Bone Marrow - sea salt, seasonal preserves, sourdough bread\\nPimento Cheese - lil' pickles, pretzel bread\\nPickled Mussels (special appetizer)\\n\\n\\"For The Table\\"\\nLa Belle Farms Duck Rillettes - seasonal preserve, lil' pickles, French baguette\\nPEI Mussels - roasted tomato, fennel, capers, sourdough bread\\nCreole Turnovers - crawfish, Andouille sausage, peppers, onion, tomato, remoulade\\nArtisan Cheese Board - chef's selection of local artisan cheeses with accompaniments\\nOysters Rockefeller - spinach, Applewood-smoked bacon, breadcrumb, Parmesan cream\\nRoasted Pear Tart - goat cheese, caramelized onion, rosemary\\nChicken-fried Georgia Quail - Belgian waffle, collard greens, cane syrup, hot sauce\\nButcher Block - duck rillettes, beef jerky, Andouille sausage, Virginia speck, spicy mustard, chow chow.\\n\\n\\"Salad\\"\\nTuscan Kale salad - persimmon, Marcona almonds, feta cheese, speck ham, sherry vinaigrette\\n\\n\\"Main Plates\\"\\nLa Belle Farms Duck Breast - Anson Mills farro, acorn squash, Tuscan kale, pomegranate jus\\nGeorges Bank Scallops - warm lentil salad, chorizo, dried apple, local cider reduction\\n\\n\\"Dessert\\"\\nBourbon Pecan Pie - vanilla ice cream, cane syrup\\nGeorgia Fried Apple Pies - cinnamon sugar\\nSliced Pumpkin Bread Pudding - vanilla ice cream, apple toffee caramel\\n\\nOf the Small Plates, my favorites are the Crispy Chicken Skins and the Beef Carpaccio. The chicken skins are like pork rinds, but better. They're lighter, more delicate, and more flavorful. I like them fine without the accompanying sauces. The carpaccio is thinly sliced and savory.  Generous portion of horseradish aioli.\\n\\nThe Pickled Beets and Butternut Squash plates are OK. The vegetables are fresh, but the dishes seem too \\"plain.\\" The Ahi Tuna Tostadas are nicely presented, meaty, and tasty. The Pimento Cheese is satisfying. It's got a relatively coarse texture.\\n\\nIf ordering Bone Marrow, I recommend one order for every 2-3 people. The marrow is rich, fatty, gelatinous, and at times tendony.  It's best spread on a little piece of toast. The preserves add extra flavor. The Pickled Mussels are interesting. They're served in a lemon broth with crackers and a sort of cocktail sauce on the side. It's good stuff if you like mussels.\\n\\nOf the \\"For The Table\\" plates, my favorite is the Chicken-fried Georgia Quail, better known as chicken and waffles. The quail has been deboned, fried, and tastes like delicious fried chicken. Sweet syrup and a nice Southern touch with the collards.\\n\\nThe Duck Rillettes are alright. It's like pate. These rillettes seem a bit too salty.  The PEI (Prince Edward Island) Mussels are alright too. They are small, but it might just have been the batch I had.\\n\\nThe Oysters Rockefeller are good. Nicely breaded and succulent. The Pear Tart resembles a pizza. I'm not a huge fan of this dish. The meat and cheese boards are par for the course. The appetizing speck is my favorite of the meats. The jerky, too tough. Of the cheeses, I do like the creamy goat cheese and the velvety brie.  Excellent Marcona almonds are added as a bonus with the cheese.\\n\\nThe Kale Salad is fresh and crisp.  The Duck Breast and Scallops are so-so. The duck breast is sliced into several lean, hearty pieces. The meat is kind of tough.  It's a filling dish.  The batch of scallops I had seemed overcooked.  Rubbery and chewy.  Good size though.\\n\\nThe desserts are decent. Without a doubt, my favorite is the Pecan Pie.  The Apple Pies resemble empanadas, similar to the Creole Turnovers. The Bread Pudding is fine. The pumpkin flavor really stands out.\\n\\nOutstanding service.

I'm a big salad (and salad dressing) fan and what I would always do was get the salad with their House dressing (phenomenal) and also get some of their Creamy Italian.  I have never tasted a better combination!  I still yearn for it to this day and sadly, I now live out of state and rarely get a chance to visit.  For those of you who don't mix dressings, get either or.  I have never found anyone who has Creamy Italian that tastes like theirs and I think I've tried practically every brand I could find.\\n\\nTheir lasagnas are really good.

The celery root salad was your typical remoulade but loaded with lots of crab meat. The portion was large and it could have been eaten as a main course. The duck was done just right, rare with crisp skin, served with confit bread pudding which was a very nice addition. Most restaurants slice the duck breast before plating but here they served it as one piece.  The burger was perfectly cooked and very large, about 1/2 pound.  While the fries looked beautiful they definitely could have been crisper. For desert we tried the lemon cake, champagne gel√©e, orange streusel, juniper ice cream. This was also excellent.

Luckily, me and my mom arrived during \\"brunch hour\\" post 11am. We waited about 15 min for a table which wasn't too bad. Jam is quite large, with seating on two different sides of the building including some tables outside. Our waiter was a red headed/red bearded fellow that was very nice (I appreciate great wait staff, it makes the dining experience that much better). Here is my review.\\n\\nThe Good\\n\\n1. Tons of options for breakfast. You can make virtually any combo of breakfast scramble you could think of for a pretty reasonable price. \\n2. They have choices for meat eaters, vegetarians, and vegans.\\n3. They have a lot of tables. \\n4. Great location, easy to find. \\n5. The breakfast scrambles are delicious! My food came out hot, well plated, and tasty.\\n6. Excellent wait staff\\n7. They serve breakfast till 3pm, sometimes you just want some eggs for lunch.\\n\\nThe Bad\\n\\n1. It's LOUD. Since this restaurant has the capacity to serve a lot of people, it is loud. So if you want to have a conversation, get a table outside or adjust to 'shout mode' They could alleviate some of the loudness by turning off the background music. If there are a lot of people in the restaurant, there is no need for loud booming music. It's strange they would feel they needed to play loud music in an already loud atmosphere.\\n\\n2. Hash browns, bland\\n\\n3. The Jam they provide in the squeeze bottles on their tables has an odd gloppy texture and in need of some lemon zest in the recipe to give it more flavor. Sometimes berries alone need a little flavor assistance. It also needs to be thinned out a little, too thick.\\n\\nOther than my few criticisms, my experience there was quite good and I will be back, most likely during a non busy time so I can hear my own thoughts and will ask for a side of maple syrup instead of using the jam, unless they fix the recipe."},{"name":"Kekes Breakfast Cafe","address":"1005 Spring Villas Point","city":"Winter Springs","stars":"3.5","text":"This is a solid breakfast/brunch option.

They rave about the food and the drinks for weeks until I finally make a reservation to go. I peruse the menu ahead of time and realize there are no good vegetarian/vegan options. Hmmm. I call and ask about said options and am assured that the chef has a few vegetarian and vegan menu items he can make upon request. Boom! I'm in!\\n\\nA friend and I arrive and are seated promptly, but wait awhile for service. No stress, we're oohing and ahing over the drink menu. It was a good spread and the drinks we got that evening were strong and really made well (the whole two stars on this review belong to the drink menu). Waitress finally comes and asks us what we want. I ask her about the vegetarian/vegan options the chef can make. Blank stare. Then I explain that I called...and yadda yadda. Oh yes....those vegan options. Yeah, they're called sides. You can order a side of bland brussel sprouts or cabbage or a salad with nothing on it. The Pumpkin ravioli? Made with chicken stock. The veggie soups? Made with chicken stock. Umm...ok. We'll take the bland sides? At this point the waitress seemed annoyed. I felt genuinely bad, we weren't trying to be a pain, which is why I called ahead and tried to figure out our options. She basically ignored us for the rest of the evening and happily flited about the meat-eating tables. \\n\\nSo, let's just say that $150 dollars buys a good amount of drinks, a few random vegetable sides and no return business."},{"name":"Don Pedro","address":"5900 NE 4th Plain Blvd","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Came late at night service was fast.

(i.e., way too much freakin' food - $60 worth for two people, i don't know what came over me, but that got us 3 apps, 2 mains, 2 naans, & 1 lassi. enough to feed six people). anyway, delivery took forty minutes - the man i spoke to on the phone made me aware of the wait and our food arrived hot and fresh so i didn't mind. the delivery guy was friendly and professional. the only problem was when i realized they had sent me veggie tikka masala instead of chicken. they must have misheard me over the phone somehow. i called them and they sent out the correct order no questions asked right away & it arrived quickly, and even let us keep the veggie one. great service.\\n\\nthe food was good. the naan is AMAZING as others have noted. it is also huge - we always get two from other places so i ordered two from here and we only ate half of one. J got the chicken chili made hot. he likes food that makes him cry and this delivered. my chicken tikka masala made medium was good (flavorful & very tasty) but i don't think this is the dish for me, and next time i'll stick to the vindaloos - i like my indian food to pack more of a punch. i also got vegetable samosas which were good, and J got a sweet lassi which was awesome, but small.

The service - not so much. \\n\\nI visited tonight for dinner and ordered two taco dinners and a side of fries to dine-in with fianc√©. The restaurant was not very busy (maybe around 5 tables with a couple people at the bar). The timestamp for when I ordered the meals showed 7:40pm on my receipt. I received my tacos in a timely manner and started eating in anticipation that my fianc√© would receive his food shortly as well. I finished my meal and his food still was not out. We asked three employees about the remainder of our meal and waited for another 15 minutes before his tacos came out. \\n\\nOur fries, however, still did not make it to the table. We patiently waited, but the fries were still nowhere to be found after both of us had finished our meals. The time was now 8:20pm and it had been 40 minutes since we ordered. French fries should never take 40 minutes to fry. I walked up to the counter and asked about my fries and the owner apologized (which none of this is the owner's fault), and finally the fries arrived to our table...after we had finished eating. Nonetheless, we got our fries - but they were cold. At this point I'm wondering, \\"what the heck could possibly be going on between the kitchen and the front-of-the-house crew where they can't make our food on time and they can't serve hot food? Were the fries just sitting on the counter and everyone just neglected to serve them to our table?\\" \\n\\nI will reiterate that the food and atmosphere are phenomenal, and I've been a fan of Ponko Chicken since they were located on HWY 78 in the early 2000s.

Every time I ordered one, it was perfect, and stacked with more meat than other other sandwich place in boston.  Fast forward to when this place really blew up, both pre and post the building expansion, the making of the italians subs has unbelievably declined.  There are so many new faces in there, which is a great sign because the place is killing it, but I get a different sub every time I walk in the door.  Some of these guys rush through it, and put more lettuce on the sub than meat, more often than not there is barely a layer of meat on there anymore.  Every now an then I'll get a sub that reminds me of the old days, and my faith is restored, then next time i got in it's barely any meat again.  I even started keeping a close eye as its being made, and when the meat is noticeably light, I ask for a little more, only to get charged extra $$ for extra meat, which is absurd.  The last time I went in I ordered a large italian, and it seemed to get made faster than I've ever seen,  I thought something seemed off, and by the time i got home and unwrapped it, it was lettuce, tomato, a thin covering of mortadella and cheese.  How do you not put salami/prosciutto  on an Italian? For $11, no one wants a mortadella and cheese sub.  Even though at Pauli's down the street the cold cuts are pre-sliced, they at least give you a consistent stack of meat on there, and are happy to listen to how you want your sub made (i.e., light on the lettuce, extra hots, etc...without taking it personal).\\n\\nThis place has great food, and I love the owners, but somewhere along the line the consistency of how things are made has slipped big time.  If I\\"m paying $11 for a large italian, I sure as hell better not get a sandwich stacked with meat one time, and a sandwich with a paper thin layer of meat the next time.\\n\\nGet everyone behind the counter back on the same page on how to properly make a sub, write out instructions, re-train, do whatever you need to do so that I get the same great sub every time i walk in and then this place can starting claiming that they deliver the best sub in the city."},{"name":"Tasty n Alder","address":"580 SW 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Fabulous food, great service, great time with friends.

Neo-cronut pastry hybrids have made their way to international markets, but you can find its savory edition here in the United States at Revolution Doughnuts. The Savory Crunchy Mister's mysterious title holds the least of its appeal; just one look at this \\"doughnut\\" stirs the strongest test of curiosity. The Savory Crunchy Mister is an American translation of a French classic, le croque-monsieur sandwich. The name, which is a literal translation of the verb croquer which means \\"to crunch,\\" and monsieur, meaning \\"mister,\\" describes Revolution's slightly toasted yeast-raised round filled with black forest ham and topped with b√©chamel and gruy√®re cheeses. The croque-monsieur made its first appearance in French caf√©s and bistros in the early 1900s as a snack-like meal, so it's quite fitting that the American adaptation works as both a teaser to a meal and a treat following a meal. I found the Savory Crunchy Mister texture not as light as a croissant's; it was denser, actually. What's more, it didn't taste like a biscuit, nor was it sweet like a doughnut, yet, there was a hint of sweetness to the bread, which may be credited to the fusion of flavors from the doughnut flour to the filling."},{"name":"Lincoln Tavern and Restaurant","address":"425 W Broadway","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"The brunch test kitchen was so unique and delicious!

Over the last few years I've noticed both the service and food quality go down, but I always gave it the benefit of the doubt. I truly want to love it! But recently the tables were officially turned....errr bare. \\n\\nA group of 7 of us waited for 30 minutes to sit, which is ok. We then were sat and ordered drinks only to find out after we ordered drinks that one of our beers kegs had kicked. OK since they have tons of solid beers on tap. (strike one). Next we all ordered our dinners (Ribs, chicken, brisket etc.) 15 minutes after ordering our food the waitress comes back and informs us they RAN OUT of RIBS, BRISKET, and CHICKEN! wait...I thought you were a bbq joint? What BBQ joint doesn't have ribs?! Ok, we are now peeved, but it's not the waitresses fault, we all (6 of 7 people) change our orders and patiently wait for our meal. (strike two). \\n\\nAnd if running out of 50% of the menu wasn't enough, about 15 minutes after we changed our orders, the waitress informs us that they had RAN OUT of all of our new orders! ARE YOU KIDDING?! 75% of the menu was now completely unavailable. (Strike THREE) All that they did to compensate was offer us a free appetizer at this point.... So we changed our order again and waited another 45 minutes for our food. \\n\\nWhen we finally got our meal, an hour and a half after we sat down, they did somehow find a rack of ribs and gave us that \\"for free\\" in addition to all of our dinner orders, but it was nothing since we were already full from our normal orders and drinks. \\n\\nNot once did a manager come over to our table and explain what happened, nor try to comp us anything besides a free $4.99 appetizer for 7 people. We didn't freak out and complain in the restaurant since that's just not out style to cause a scene, but the service was beyond poor. \\n\\nFor a place that has taken great menu items off the menu in the last 6 months (memphis ribs) as well as raised their prices 15% across the board it was an utterly disappointing experience for a place I truly want to love. It's too bad, but I think Redbones has just lost a solid group of longtime customers."},{"name":"Roadworthy","address":"125 Washington St","city":"Dedham","stars":"5","text":"I had the Ragtop sandwich... definitely good and filling.

This time, I waited the full three hours and boy was it worth it. \\n\\nThey had a dozen different types of oysters on the menu so I tried one of each. This included the Wellfleet, Island Creek, Katama Bay, Ripitide, East Beach Blonde, Onset, Pemaquid, Winter Point, Beausoleil, Tamagouche, Kumamoto, and Kusshi. Of these my top 4 favorite were the Wellfleet, Island Creek, Winter Point, and Kusshi. I highly recommend trying these if not all.\\n\\nAfter the oysters I had the PEI mussels which were served with toasted cashews, red curry, cilantro, lime, scallions and garlic...yummy! The mussels were good but not as amazing as the oysters. I have definitely had better mussels in Boston. The broth was tasty but the mussels did not really take the flavor of the broth. \\n\\nI also tried the clam chowder which was delicious. The consistency was a bit thinner than you would imagine which made the chowder taste light but the pieces of clams balanced the thinness out. \\n\\nAfter trying every single oyster on the menu, I was actually pretty full. I am mad that I did not have the opportunity to try the lobster roll but all the more reason to come back. I really wish they took reservations.

Two pieces of perfectly fried chicken, topped with juicy greasy bacon, smothered with melty gooey cheese and overflowing sausage gravy, and sandwiched between two thick buttery biscuits.  If you want to go big instead of going home, order the Reggie Deluxe which comes with the abovementioned items PLUS a fried egg on top.  If you doubt your ability to fit the sandwich in your mouth for your first chomp, DON'T DO IT.  You will just risk the whole dang sandwich with the ingredients falling haphazardly apart over your plate.  Instead of ruining such a pristine Pine State Reggie experience, I just cut the sandwich in half.  \\n\\nSurprisingly, their handmade biscuits are not the best I've had in Portland, but they are still really good!  They are enhanced when accompanied with the exceptionally tasty mushroom gravy.  Their mushroom gravy scores higher marks than their sausage gravy.\\n\\nAlso, don't underestimate their other breakfast items.  Their blueberry cornmeal pancakes are pretty darn delectable.  They taste way lighter than your normal gutbomb pancakes, which is a good thing.  I was really impressed with their grits -- full of flavor and just the right consistency.

Murphy's by itself is a 4 but Tuesdays are special and the excellent well-priced wine shop gives this Va-Hi focal point the 5th star. \\n\\nFirst off, the menu is solid with a good price range. The salad with lobster is amazing and we order it every time we go. The brisket is also fantastic, a very tasty and homey type meal. I recently toned it down a bit and got the burger...excellent! They also have a dessert and coffee shop but I always go for the cheese course for dessert. \\n\\nThe real star of Murphy's is the wine shop and their Tuesday night tastings. Tastings are $20 a person, sounds a little pricey but when you do the math for the amount poured for you during the tastings your realize it is a fabulous deal. Troy, who only occasionally pours, is the best I've met there. All of their wine staff is very knowledgeable and I usually cannot leave there without buying a bottle or two, either from the tasting itself or from shop. As far as prices, Murphy's has great prices on their wine. I have been to many of the California wineries and Murphy's is actually offering most of their wines for cheaper than the wineries can. There is no markup at Murphy's but actually a discount. (And you don't have to pay with cash to get the discount...but I do love my Green's on Ponce). The only sad part about Murphy's which did not affect the 5 stars is their menu wine list by the glass is not the best. More unique than most places in Atlanta but what are you going to do, you can't pour a glass from all your best bottles. I'm just hoping they keep mixing it up but when I go to Murphy's for dinner, I'm doing the wine tasting. By the way, $5 is taking any entree of  greater than $11 if you pay for the wine tasting (the $11 burger does not make the cut, I wish they would just restaurant up and charge $11.01 for it so the discount could apply). \\n\\nFinally, Murphy's is a jewel for brunch. This is how I first found Murphy's but have since become more partial to dinner. Great place for 2 or big groups.

We were here for lunch and booked a tatami room which is great if you have a toddler. I recall back in the day that Kamei used to be a lot more authentic Japanese. I will preface this in that I prefer the simple refined tastes of traditional flavors and less the Asian fusion fad with the creation of diverse maki rolls. \\n\\nSo, the food?\\n\\nTuna taco - imaginative with a contrast of flavors and textures. The downside was that instead of a soft taco like shell, the crispy hard shell fell apart on first bite. A real mess. \\n\\nSalmon sashimi party - 24 pieces of fresh pacific sockeye. Wish they had wild salmon, this had the look and texture of farmed salmon. \\n\\nSushi and tempura boat - ok me bad for not looking closely at the photo in the lunch menu closely. But there was NO sushi in this boat. It was all sushi maki. It was not called maki boat. It was called sushi boat. Tempura was oily with too thick a coating for my tastes. Also, green pepper tempura? Just don't do it unless you can prevent it from turning into a soggy mess. \\n\\nMatsu sushi combo - decent combination of sushi. Ikura and ebi were not as fresh as I would expect from a Vancouver sushi place. \\n\\nUni sushi - ordered a few pieces of this delicacy of sea urchin roe. They were big and plump pieces, but flavor wise not as sweet and fresh as I would expect. \\n\\nSalmon combo - I really appreciated that the teriyaki sauce was in the side and not drenching the salmon."},{"name":"Golden Eagle","address":"904 Memorial Dr SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Sometimes everything comes together.

The menu is actually pretty innovative with stuff like pizza sandwiches and pizza salads and plenty of cool toppings.  Mmmm honey roasted garlic....  I'm also impressed with is their flexibility.  They're totally cool with you ordering \\"this pizza, but this topping instead of that topping and on thick crust instead\\" type thing.  Speaking of the crust...  you can choose from a thick crust and a thin crispy crust.  I don't do crispy pizza, so I've never had that one, but I really like the thicker crust.  I think the thing that makes the pizza is the sauce.  Be warned, there is a lot of it and the pizza is pretty messy, but the sauce is nice and sweet with plenty of herbs.  Also, the servers are always pleasant and attentive, but in a laid back kind of way.  \\n     All in all, a great place to come for a chill dinner.

None of us had been before, but had heard about it for years. Before we left, I read several of the reviews here, so in many cases I was not surprised. Yet, considering the restaurant's reputation -  and the cost of dining there - I left mostly disappointed. \\n\\nThe experience begins by taking your shoes off to be escorted to your table. (If you decide to try Imperial Fez, I highly encourage you to wear socks - or bring them with you. On the short walk to our table, my feet picked up all sorts of food bits - which was rather unnerving). Each seating area has a combination of small booths, short chairs and floor pillows. The interior was full of overlayed rugs, fabrics, and pillows. Everything felt a little dirty, a little dusty, and a little worn out. \\n\\nThe meals are a five course dinner. You are served four of the courses without option - in our case it was lentil soup & bread, \\"salad\\", a chicken puff pastry, and a hot tea and spiced pastry dessert. You choose the main dish from a menu. Complete meal prices range from $25-75, depending on the main dish you select. Drinks are expensive - for instance, Heineken is $9.50,  Bud Light $8, and mixed drinks $9-10. \\n\\nThe food was OK. The wait staff was \\"fine.\\" The concept of eating w/ my fingers wasn't a problem, you go there expecting that. The food was just OK - which is largely where my disappointment lies. For our $150 check (tip was built in at 20% due to the size of our group), I expected better. \\n\\nThe belly dancing was decent, but a bit of a let down. For some reason, I thought that we'd see a constant show of belly dancing, but instead we saw only three short dances - about 2 or 3 minutes in length each. There were also the handful of young men in the audience who thought they were in a strip club - gesturing for her to do things; creepy.\\n\\nIn the end, I have no regrets because it was really about getting together with friends - and we had a great time together laughing and poking at our food with our fingers.\\n\\nThe million dollar questions: \\n\\n1) Would I go back?

My wife and I showed up and put our name on the list at 4:45 and got the call at about 5:40. I had some oysters, a shrimp (they are sold individually), the yellowfin tuna, the hamachi ceviche, and the Neptune Burger. It's a lot, I know, but I got the impression that the raw fish wasn't going to do the trick. I was wrong. \\n\\nThe oysters were good and the descriptions were right on the mark. The shrimp was nothing special, and the price was high, so... The tuna was amazing. It's a tuna tartare and the seasoning is beautiful. The hamachi also had great flavor and was a larger portion than I expected. Between the fish and the stuff on top, you get a really good mix of flavors. The Neptune Burger was amazing. Easily one of the best burgers I've ever had. The flavor was so rich and you got a great amount of flavor from the beef itself. I was blown away from the first bite. I should have stopped halfway through, but it was so good I couldn't stop. \\n\\nThe reason they lost a star is because of the clam chowder that my wife had. They warn that it's brother than most New England clam chowders, and the thickness of the soup supported that, but the problem was a lack of flavor. It was just bland. They don't put salt and pepper out, so there's no way to remedy the problem. Based on this, I cannot recommend the clam chowder. \\n\\nOther than that, the waitstaff was friendly, the bartender gave a good beer recommendation, and the food arrived in a timely manner, so all else was in order.

Incredibly tender, beautiful color, and they just fall off the bone. Their brisket is meaty but dry, and their pulled pork is good (nothing special). Their fried oysters are nice and light, but not worth the price tag. Sides are enjoyable, especially the mac and cheese.\\n\\nLastly, they have an insane beer selection.

They also serve alcohol (beer). I'm the type that would prefer Dominos or Papa Johns over the fancy/gourmet style pizzas. But All Star Pizza has your simple cheese or pepperoni slices as well as some other specialty combination pizzas. I had the pepperoni and the crust was thin and crispy and was very good. I like the tomato sauce a bit on the sweeter side rather than too tangy. I'd definitely make an effort to stop by again for a slice. In order of nearby pizza places I'd probably choose Blaze, All Star, and then maybe Upper Crust. All Star has better pizza than Blaze but Blaze has Dr. Pepper and sometimes i just need an ice cold Dr. Pepper with my pizza."},{"name":"The Ramenman","address":"841 Bidwell Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"The ramen is so good!

The kitchen staff seemed pretty close knit and the service was friendly enough. The Chicken and clam bowl is made with a high quality white wine from what I could see in the kitchen. It makes for a refreshing change from the typical ramen flavours.\\n\\nThe only negative thing I can note is the seating inside.

I went for the first time tonight and sat in the back by the expo window. I had one issue tonight and I feel it is worth mentioning. It really upset me, but I'm not going to rate this restaurant poorly because of one extremely rude person. \\n\\nI honestly didn't see the sign by our table that instructed male patrons to go around the restaurant to go to the restroom. Had I seen the sign, I would've happily followed instructions. It was an honest mistake. The expo area is right by the restroom and kind of in an awkward spot- and after I was very rudely instructed by a server to \\"go around next time\\" I realized that I had made a mistake by cutting through the area. I can't remember exactly what she said, but it was NOT AT ALL kind. So, I responded by saying that she could have spoken to me in a more polite manner.\\n\\nShe proceeded to antagonize me the rest of the night. She went by our table carrying a ton of food on a tray directly over my head, shouting something with an intentionally nasty tone. After that, she also came back by my table, purposefully on my side of the table and shouted at me to \\"push in my chair\\" because me being that far in the aisle was a \\"fire hazard.\\" My friends all agreed that she was purposefully targeting me and being unprofessional and rude. I have never experienced anything like this at a restaurant. \\n\\nAfter this last incident, we engaged in shouting at each other across the restaurant. I was not happy at the way she was acting and definitely let her know it. I was informed by our server, who was incredibly attentive and very nice, that \\"she is always like that\\" and that \\"she's always looking for an argument\\" with guests. She told me this all when the rude server went out to smoke to cool off from the situation.\\n \\nI apologized to our server because I was shouting at the other server, and looking back, I should've just ignored her. Nonetheless, I really hope that someone from this establishment reaches out to me so I can discuss this further. I don't want anything. As I said, our server was great and I am not about to give a poor score based on one terrible aspect, but I would like to talk to an owner/manager if anyone would like to reach out.

The restaurant quickly became busy on a Tuesday night which I was surprised by, clearly they are doing something right!

Then come out with the oil and balsamic (after we had finished the small slices of bread). Just put a bread basket on the table with four-five slices of bread. I feel this would save time for staff and people will be more satisfied picking their own piece of bread vs having one selected for them with tongs, it's just an awkward look. Anywho aside from this weird bread situation, our three appetizers came out quickly: the burrata, Caprese and Bison carpaccio. All were quite large portions which was fantastic (price is right) and quite delicious. I enjoyed every bite. Then came my main course, the bucatini carbonara. I've gotta say it was just okay, my sister makes a killer carbonara which I'd take over this any day. They need more sharp cheese, like an Asiago mixed with the egg yolk as well as chilli flakes to give it a kick! I loved the other pasta dishes which were the truffle cream spaghetti and meatballs (big portion), the spicy chicken/eggplant spaghettini and the bore pasta Paccheri bolognese.

We had high hopes. It's  in a nice area of town and the decor was pretty. I don't know if it was just an off day or what, but our experience was not good. We ordered the hummus and baba ganoush appetizer. The pita bread was hot and the hummus was good. The baba ganoush started off as a decent bite but the tail end flavor was off putting - it had a sort of bad beer flavor. The manager ended up taking that off our order, so kudos for that. \\n\\nWe also had the fish and chips appetizer and the fish smelled a little too fishy for my taste. It obviously wasn't 'bad', but the fishy odor was there and it was off putting. My daughter and I had their Strawberry Salad and we enjoyed that. They forgot to add onions to mine, but I was at a point where I just wanted to finish and go. My kids got burgers and they were not impressed. They also left off the bacon on one of the burger. Again, it was rectified but the errors kept piling up. \\n\\nMy husband had a so-so trout salad with shrimp. I originally had ordered the Crispy Chicken but the chicken tasted funky, and not funky as in bad flavor - funky as in sketchy. Again, they took it back and offered me a different dish.

The first time we went in August 2010 we thought the food was decent.  Nothing special, but not too bad.  I got the vegetarian plate, which, while it tasted ok, it was simply a random assortment of vegetarian items.  There was no cohesion or theme to the dish.  We went again last week, only because we had a coupon from Scoutmob.  I got the white bean soup and a dinner portion of their Caesar salad.  The soup was terrible.  Imagine opening a can of white beans, pureeing half of it, and heating it all together on the stove.  That's pretty much what it tasted like.  I could have saved myself $6 and bought a can of beans from Publix.  The salad was worse - there is no excuse for a Caesar salad with brown lettuce and mostly the crunchy white parts of the stalk.  I have eaten a better salad at Panera Bread.  My husband got their burger, which was also a mistake.  For a city with such a love affair of burgers, this was unacceptable.

When I first got there, the waitress said someone had to give a CC for a tab.

However, the majority of my friends got their drinks at the bar, because they didn't have cash!

My friend got the boneless wings.  How strange!  Ever get those 'turkey tips' ?  Basically an 1.5\\" inch 'chunk' of meat that was dry and over-cooked, well, that was the boneless 'wing'.  I didn't even know that you could get kind of meat cut from a chicken!  The fried calamari was OK and the highlight of the meal.  You could easily run up a $100+ tab w/o thinking about it which is a real shame although local choices are pretty limited.  The Uno across 128 is equally dreadful in terms of quality.\\n\\nNot a repeat."},{"name":"Osteria Nino","address":"19 3rd Ave","city":"Burlington","stars":"3.5","text":"Went for lunch on a Saturday and sat at the bar.

In fact, it's become such a natural part of my dining life that it didn't even occur to me to step back and review till now!\\n\\nThe menu of food is a combo of home runs and misses. The best idea, I think, when dining at any place is to order food native to the style of the spot. Don't order attempts at Thai bowls at a pub. Don't order a burger at a Chinese restaurant. \\n\\nThe \\"Drive burger\\" aka The Charlatan's veggie burger is awesome, definitely one of the best in vancity and around $13ish...cheap. It's loaded with roasted red peppers, goats cheese, and guacamole and served with yam fries. \\n\\nThe bacon wrapped meatloaf is astonishingly and nostalgically good. Comes with garlic mash which is salty and garlicky and fluffy and awesome, and cooked veg which is thankfully cooked appropriately instead of the 50's style massacre that most people inflict on side veg. I order this on those marathon-of-rain-missing-home-cooked-meals type nights when I can go in alone and join my fellow expats to commiserate and warm our chilly bones. \\n\\nThe chicken tenders are the best chicken tenders in Vancouver, possibly the best I've had ever. Actual chicken tenders (not just slices of chicken), panko breaded and fried to crunchy, moist perfection. Comes with thin, crispy fries and home-made honey mustard. I actually think all of their sauces are homemade. \\n\\nBeer list is solid. The Charlatan isn't trying to be St. Augustine's or Bier Craft. They don't have 3,573 beers on tap but what they do have is solid and pairs well with the menu. The beer flight is cheap and no beer is off limits, which is nice. Drinks are stiff and well-made. They have cheap and good Caesars...\\n\\n...which brings me to brunch. The Charlatan is the only good brunch on the drive. I could spend hours lounging beneath my strategically planned sun glasses and hat while allowing Charlie to heal my hangovers. I wish they did daily brunch, actually. It's nothing super mind-blowing but again it's solid, relatively fast to arrive, and paired with a selection of \\"hair of the dog\\" type brunch booze. I think they even have a one-price brunch that includes a Caesar. \\n\\nThe best thing about this place is the service. I have a close friend who works there and have become friends with a few of the other servers simply because they're awesome. It's nice to find servers that you want to stick around and chat with (which they'll do in a lovely and genuine manner) but that are totally professional, prompt, and accommodating. I have NEVER had anything less than a good experience here, and a lot of credit is due to the service. \\n\\nThe room (and patio) are a perfect intersection of comfort and relaxed elegance. A major step up from the paint-everything-black-semi-industrial \\n-approach that's infecting every pub in the city (thank you, Donelly Group), the Charlie is all warm polished wood and soft light wrapping it's simple layout. Enough tv's to watch whatever you're into but placed in a strategic and un-intrusive way, so you'll see couples on dates and groups of friends watching hockey peacefully cohabitating for the night. Descending over three conjoining levels, the rooms are small and intimate, prompting good conversation fueled by service from two bars. The patio is sunny, breezy, and studded with lush trees which insulate from road sound and provide a welcome oasis in which to drink or dine. \\n\\nThe Charlatan is open pretty late most nights, hosts all the big hockey games, is reasonably easy to park by and has a bike post outside for neurotic bike owners like myself to monitor their prized possessions.  \\n\\nI can't say enough good things about The Charlatan, but I'm sure you're bored now so I'm stopping. \\n\\nGo here!\\n\\nOk seriously.

Lots of parking so easy to get in and out of. The only thing we found odd, and it was really a conversation piece, there is a painting on the wall near our booth. It looks like a solitary trailer with a broken down car outside. We had a great time discussing just WHY a high end steakhouse would have such a painting on the wall.

I was really looking forward to this. We leave MK to go back to Wildrness Lodge to change into something nicer. It takes a little longer to get back than anticipated, but we rush and change and get out of our room by 7PM. Our reservation was for 7:50. What happened after that is kind of a blur! We took the boat to MK to catch the monorail or boat to Narcoossees. I asked a CM at MK what was the quickest way and he tells me the boat. So, I see no boat appraoching and think it will be quicker to take the monorail...WRONG!! I did not know that the boat would leave you right by Narcoossees. We take the monorail which travels around to the other resorts before getting us to the GF. We are already late at this point. I did not know that Narcoossees was not in the main building of the GF and we are walking all over looking for it. We asked for directions at the desk, and in our confused, hungry state, I guesss we did not pay close enough attention because we still couldnt find it! We asked again and they pulled out another map, which we then told them were useless to us and our inferior map reading skills and to just point and give us things to look for! We tell the woman at the desk we are already 40 minutes late for our ADR. She said she would call them and let them know we would be there shortly. We FINALLY find it and all is right with the world again after we get seatled promptly and catch our breath. \\n\\nWe had a window table and saw the castle all lit up in icicle lights. Our server was very peppy and attentive. We were seated right next to a door to the dock which apparently they dont want you to go out of to view Wishes, so she told us where we would have to go around to go see it. However, the very nice young man that they had stationed there guarding the door who was chatting with us, told us he would let us use that door :-)\\n\\nThey broad out the bread with butter topped with red Hawaiin sea salt. OMG...I did not know bread and butter could taste this good! That sea salt had magical properties I tell you! This was my favorite bread and butter of the trip. The butter was delicious!! I believe the bread was sourdough. I had to really control myself to not get stuffed on the bread. I found the Hawaiian Red Sea Salt in DTD later in the week and picked up a few packages. Wish I asked if it was a brand of butter I could buy. Did I mention it was delicious?\\n\\nAppetizers:\\n\\nCreamy Florida Blue Crab Chowder \\nPeekytoe Crab, Roasted Sweet Zellwood Corn, Yukon Gold Potatoes, and Smoked Chili Oil \\n\\nMy son ordered this and loved it.

It was delicious and again, my favorite of the trip. A nice assortment of cheeses.

Our server asked if we wanted them to hold on before sending out our entrees to which I replied yes. DH glared at me  As promised, we were let out of the door right next to our table. My son and I walked all the way out and away several feet and watched the lovely show. DH hung closer to the door in case they brought the food out while we were outside. He looked like he was stalking prey! \\n\\nMain Course:\\n\\nButter-poached Maine Lobster Tail with Black Angus New York Strip \\nHe loved it and ate every bite. He said his steak was cooked perfectly and so was the lobster. I think I saw a tear escape his eye\\n\\nRoasted Herb-marinated All-Natural Ashley Farms Chicken Breast \\nCreamy Cheddar-Peppadew White Polenta, Petite Autumn Vegetables, \\n\\nChicken Cracklins, and Sherry-Chicken Jus \\nThis is what my son ordered. He was in love with his meal, and again, good reporting made me taste it. Holy cow, I wanted a vat of this polenta! I went back to steal several more forkfuls. Payback for stealing my bread toasts! I didnt think you could get so much flavor in polenta. The chicken was delicious also, but oh my, that polenta!\\n\\nButter-poached Maine Lobster Tail with Filet Mignon \\n\\nThe steak was like butter. No, wait, the lobster was like butter. The butter was like...oh, umm...nevermind. Seriously, the steak was delicious. Cooked perfectly and very tender. The lobster was fantastic! Again, perfectly cooked and so tender, buttery, and delicious. The potatoes were good, not the best ever, but the rest of the meal made up for it.\\n\\nAmazing meal.

We get there and put our name and number down at 6:45 for a table for 4 and are told it will be a 2-2.5 hour wait. Not a big deal, there are tons of Pokestops in the area and none of us had been to Boston before, so we figure we'll just explore the area. We get drinks at a bar nearby and wander through Quincy market and hatch a few eggs before we get the call at close to 9:30. When they give you a range, assume you're going to be waiting the max amount of time. \\n\\nMy group ordered 7 oysters, clam chowder, lobster rolls, scallops and a ribye. Do not get the ribeye. It was ordered medium rare, but came out medium well (i.e., dry). We only ordered it because one of us is allergic to shellfish.\\n\\nNow to the good stuff.\\n- The clam chowder was more like a soup. Not very creamy or thick at all, but the flavors were great once you get past that. Good ratio of clams to potatoes to soup. Wait a minute before you dig in to avoid burning your tongue like I did. \\n- All of the oysters we picked were good, but the standout for us was the one with the mineral finish. \\n- The lobster rolls were HUGE for the price. I'm from LA so I'm used to paying $20 for a lobster roll that's 2 bites big. I got it hot with butter and you really have to eat from the bottom because that's where the butter is and the butter makes it so much better.\\n- The fries that came with everything were great as well.

Mopac Expressway","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I've eaten off Garbo's truck a couple times now, so I'm fairly confident that I'm qualified to review it now.  I've actually been to the truck three times now.  So why the difference in the number of times that I've eaten there versus been there?  I'll explain.\\n\\nThe first two times were last year.  I love me some seafood.  And I really dig lahbstah rolls.  In fact, since I lived in San Diego for so many years, I frequented a little joint that had lobster shipped in from Maine just to make their lobster rolls.  And they were half the price that Garbo's charges.  And they were delicious.  Loved that place.  I know what you're going to say... San Diego is by the ocean.  Right.  But they shipped the lobsters in from Maine.  Maine to San Diego vs Maine to Austin.  I suck at math, but I'm pretty sure it's farther.  But I digress.  Anyway, I had a lobster roll off the truck here and it was good.  Nothing to write home about.  Some time later, I got a bowl of clam chowder off the truck.  I was less than impressed.  It was watery.  Chowder should *not* be watery.  I mean, I've been to places where they make watery chowder and they think that's fine.  In my personal opinion, it shouldn't be.  It should be thick and chowdery.  Chowdery = chunky and thick and sticks to your ribs.  The flavor was ok though.  So I ate my very overpriced bowl of clam chowder-water.\\n\\nFast forward to today.  I ordered the crab cake sliders.  The guy says they're out of sides.  No chips and no potato salad that was supposed to come with it.  I said fine, I'll just take the sliders.  I need to watch my carbs anyway and don't need the fillers.  He say's it will be $10.something.  Since it was $9.99 with the sides, I asked \\"Is it the same price even without the sides?\\"  He said \\"Yeah, but let me call my manager and see if I can adjust the prices since we're out of sides.\\"  He calls his manager and they chat for a while.  He gets off the phone and reports that his manager said he can take off the tax or something to adjust the price, but only for the lobster rolls.  Then he asked if I still wanted the sliders.\\n\\nWhat?  For real?  You're going to charge me over $10 for some little crab cake slider things and not even some potato salad to go with it?  \\n\\nNo thank you sir.  I don't mind paying my hard earned money when the food is worth the price being charged.  However...  if you're not willing to adjust your prices when you run out of something that is supposed to come with the food that you were serving, that's absolutely ridiculous.  \\n\\n\\"Sorry, we ran out of the food that we were serving, but we'll give you less food than the other guy got for the same price.\\"\\n\\nClassy."},{"name":"Portland City Grill","address":"111 SW 5th Ave, Fl 30","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"The calamari was awesome!\\nGreat atmosphere and views are beautiful !

Saw a pic of waffle on Yelp - so added that to breakfast. Glad I did as it was, far and away, the best waffle I have ever had. Adie was always smiling and attentive.

So believe me when I say that Anmol is a top shelf Indian restaurant in a nice suburban setting.\\n\\nWhen you walk inside, the ambience is just perfect -- not too bright, not too dim and the architecture makes you feel as if you're in a little restaurant in India.  I am usually forgiving of bland furniture but their tables have a gorgeous top and their seats are nice and comfortable.  Most people don't realize that a beautiful setting aids in digestion and increases the pleasure of the overall experience.\\n\\nWe ordered \\n\\n1.  Chicken Tikka Masala (sorry, I almost always do!);\\n2.  Nan;\\n3.  Raita;\\n4.  Jasmine Rice;\\n5.  Mango Lassi (fermented yogurt drink); and\\n6.  Vegetable Samosas\\n\\nThe chicken tikka masala was the best I'd ever had... I've had it really good before, too, but someone here really knows what they're doing!  The chunks of chicken were so tender and the sauce so well balanced that I experience that culinary orgasm that is, otherwise, so rare and considered as fictitious as the Loch Ness monster.\\n\\nIt is real.  The CTM is perfect.\\n\\nThe Raita was also well balanced, nice and cool and great for dipping and it was a more generous portion than I'm used to receiving anywhere else.\\n\\nThe Nan was good ol Nan... nothing stood out but nothing was supposed to, either.  It's generally meant for dipping or scooping and was great in that regard.\\n\\nVegetable Samosas were delicate and crispy.  The filling was tasty and the shell was of a texture slightly differen than I've ever had elsewhere.  If I hadn't eaten so much Indian food, I might never have noticed but it's worth nothing so that newcomers to Indian food can pay close attention to it for it will surely be every-so-slightly different elsewhere.  It was interesting, to say the least... gently crisp but then melting into gently pasty.\\n\\nThe Mango Lassi was as sweet as ever.  Like most places, Anmol doesn't escape the phenomenon of displacing the Lassi with a big chunk of ice.  I know they want it cold because it's best cold but less ice would do the trick just fine so request less ice if you want more Lassi.\\n\\nSurprise... I had a dessert I didn't list above!\\n\\nKheer - this was a sweet rice pudding with almond slivers and raisins and all I can say is M-m-m-m-m-mmmm... it was a super welcome pleasure-center ending to a super incredible awesome meal.\\n\\nEverything about this place is, in my current experience, absolutely excellent... including the professional, well-dressed waiters.  If you like Indian food, you absolutely must try Anmol AT LEAST THRICE! ;)\\n\\nThank you, Anmol!"},{"name":"Javier's Taco Shop","address":"121 N Lombard","city":"Portland","stars":"3","text":"Mostly a late late night place to go to.

It was totally spontaneous; we went to MarketStreet to eat at Wagamama but discovered that they had closed their doors.\\n\\nGaslight was not at all busy at this hour on the holiday weekend.  We were seated promptly on the shaded part of the patio, and service was prompt, courteous and friendly all through the meal.\\n\\nWe started with a French rose wine, which was very good.  The flavor was very light and smooth, so it was even better once our dinner arrived.\\n\\nWe shared a plate of Vichy carrot salad.  The quality of ingredients impressed us, from endive, to three kinds of lightly cooked carrots, to herbs in the dressing.  The flavor was intense but balanced.  The salad was actually a bit large for one person, given that the purple carrots were fairly fibrous and the vinaigrette is bold flavored.\\n\\nI had the swordfish with peppercorn sauce.  It was one of the best swordfish entrees I've ever had.  The fish was lightly crusted on the outside and still juicy inside.  It was a bit heavily salted, but I tend to like a lot of salt.  The brandied peppercorn sauce was outstanding.  The heat of the peppercorns was subtle but lingered pleasantly.\\n\\nMy companion ordered side dishes instead of an entree.  Her dinner included duck rillettes, accompanied by cornichons, pickled ramps, and more endives.  She also ordered frites with truffle aioli and roasted cauliflower.  Everything was fabulous.  The cauliflower in particular was perfectly cooked through and seasoned, with just a light crust from roasting.\\n\\nWe finished with the profiteroles sundae, which was much smaller than the picture that Jeffrey L. took in January.  There were three little scoops of ice cream, each one its own sandwich with the pastry, plus some marinated cherries and lovely chocolate sauce.  The flavors were balanced and everything on the plate complimented the rest.  A perfect ending.\\n\\nI would gladly go back for any special occasion.

Served on quality bread with a generous amount of plump, tender oysters, the Po' Boy was the day's winner.  In fact, it was so good we wished we'd ordered a whole one and skipped the potato salad.\\n\\nThe Shrimp Etouffee had potential but fell short due to an undercooked roux.\\n\\nFor round two we opted for a Muffuletta, the Seafood Gumbo and a side of Red Beans and Rice.  Like the Po' Boy, the Muffuletta was a quality sandwich.  We found half a sandwich was enough for 2; the giant roll was filled with a substantial amount of choice meat and cheese.  The requisite olive salad was incredibly flavorful; we would have loved a little more.\\n\\nThe Seafood Gumbo was disappointing from a value standpoint.  While more flavorful than the Etouffee, we failed to find any of the advertised oysters and found only 3 small shrimp.  For $9.75 a bowl we expected more substance.\\n\\nWe ended with the Red Beans and Rice.  Try as we might we're unable to find something positive to say about this dish.

You are paying for the location. Our server was very sweet and accommodating, but her knowledge of the menu led several members of the party into decisions they were not happy with (i.e., she described a drink as having a \\"small amount\\" of the flavor that in actuality had a significant amount of that flavor). The food was mediocre and bland, with a few particularly offensive menu items:\\n1. The Brussel sprouts either tasted like feet or socks, we couldn't decide. They were very warm, very soggy, and it was as if the kitchen knew the sprouts themselves were disappointing, since they attempted to cover them - really cover them- with bacon and cheese. Regular - nay- uncooked Brussel sprouts would have tasted better. \\n2. The succotash was microwaved corn and lima beans tossed in a tiny amount of butter. They still managed to get cold before it got to the table.\\n3. The crabcake BLT tasted too fishy, too salty, and had no flavors beyond those two. The tomato was mealy and blanched and the French fries served with it were limp, soggy, and lukewarm. Tepid, one might say. \\n4. The lobster corn dogs were disappointing. Also it was definitely shrimp in there, not lobster. \\n5. The garlic vegetarian pasta had no garlic flavor to speak of. It mostly tasted like buttered noodles with some vegetables thrown on top of it. \\n6. Also, food was auctioned.

This brisket was tough, and did not fall apart as I was expecting it to. It was like a tough Christmas ham that was over cooked && some what burned on the outside. The fries were very soggy and greasy, while the Mac and Cheese was good but cold have used some seasoning for flavor instead of just using cheese and nothing else. Also, after ordering this as a take out meal, they did not provide any napkins or utensils....I guess they didn't think I needed those?

As far as entrees go, I don't really remember what everyone else got (sorry, I'm terrible, I know) but I know what I enjoyed :) Risotto Of Maine Crab, Basil & Preserved Lemon. It was delicious, just as risotto should be. Also, if you get a good waitor and you ask about a dish he really gets excited when he talks about the flavors.  I just wanted him to hang out with us all night. The dessert presentation was beautiful, and tasted just as lovely.

Been twice and gotten to go twice(hot Texas summer blegh). They say to eat it fresh but honestly even if you wait 30 minutes or take them to work as leftovers the next day it will still taste REALLY REALLY good.\\n\\n- Bread and Beef Fat: I personally wasn't a fan of this but my girlfriend loved it so I'll just assume I can't appreciate it. The bread was soft and flavorful but I couldn't really distinguish what flavor the beef fat was adding that well. Texture wise it seemed like a flavorless, grittier butter\\n- Carbonera: Best dish. I don't even like bacon that much but my first bite was pure heaven. I've never had noodles this good nor flavors that mixed so well together. The noodles have the perfect consistency and the mixture of pancetta, coddled egg yolks, was really flavorful but it's the noodles that really make this place.\\n- Pomodoro: 2nd favorite dish. More of a red sauce and much creamier than the Carbonera. The sauce gives these noodles a deeper taste. I wouldn't have minded a bit more spice but the sauce itself is pretty flavorful. I also added a meatball just to try it but i wasn't a fan. I will probably add a coddled egg to this next time.\\n- Cacio: Good but not great. Noodles were good as always but I thought the toppings were a bit too cheesy and dry. There's nothing to balance out the harder texture coming from the cheese so overall i thought it took away from the noodles. Perhaps adding a coddled egg would help(i mean you can add this to everything and it will help)\\n- Great Leopold: Not a huge fan of pesto so this one was similarly lackluster to me. Girlfriend wanted to try this but she also wasn't terribly impressed.\\n\\nI believe the noodles are all the same so it just comes down to what you want on your noodles. I highly recommend the carbonera if you want sauceless noodles and the Pomodoro if you like your noodles saucey."},{"name":"Pho Pasteur","address":"682 Washington St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"We were here Feb 3, 2017 - While I think the condiments on the table could be cleaner (bottles look worn) - you CANNOT beat their soup or noodle dishes.

I liked the original BBQ sauce over the sweet Carolina but both were great. Now, the Mac and Cheese... They did NOT skimp. This is legit mac and cheese. Melty, gooey, oozing amazing cheese goodness. It rounded out the meal to a perfect 5 stars from this girl who loves her food.\\n\\nTo top it off, as we were eating (aka scarfing down this goodness) the manager made his rounds and checked out how we were doing.

Also the table was in their upstairs space but there was no elevator and they were unable to make accommodations (i.e. finding a table downstairs) so I had to struggle up the stairs with my cane.  After all this, service was rushed and perfunctory -- I suppose they assumed that we were so late eating that we were in a hurry, and asked us immediately about entree orders before even asking if anyone wanted a cocktail or appetizer.

When I ate it, I didn't taste cornbread...just the butter that I slathered on top of it. \\n\\nFor dinner, I ordered the Rib Rib plate, which featured two different types of ribs. I'll give them credit for letting you figure out your own combo meals, but the ribs were mediocre at best. They were served with 4 small, thimble sized cups of sauce. This was not good because there wasn't enough sauce at all.. especially since the ribs don't already have sauce on them. I'm used to BBQ places being very generous with the sauce, which is essential for ribs!\\n\\nLastly, the minuscule tastes of sauce that I received weren't that great as far as BBQ sauces go. The sweet sauce wasn't sweet, while the other unidentifiable sauces were either too vinegary or sour tasting.\\n\\nDefinitely check out Blue Ribbon BBQ in Arlington instead for excellent BBQ (and tasty sauce!)"},{"name":"Muselet Restaurant and Wine Bar","address":"3730 SW Bond Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Wow!!

Once famous for their french fry menu, I can now say that the tots were averagely average and the shoe strings were lame.  My dad's coney island special was a regular hot dog where they took a spoon full of almost coney sauce and lightly spread it across the bun ($6.95).  My mom's medium rare ribeye was well done.

I had just moved here in September and was working on a weekend when a co worker had not been here but mentioned she knew of a Puerto Rican restaurant that was close to where she lives.  Being Puerto Rican and not having access to momma's cooking as easily now, I looked up the address and took off for a lunch break.  Upon arriving, I got the feel of sitting in a cafe in San Juan with the music playing and all around good vibe.  The server, Santiago, approached me and was extremely friendly and welcoming.  He asked if it was my first time in and mentioned a few of the specials they had for the day.  I looked over the menu and decided to try a few items that I was familiar with since if they were done correctly, I would know the food is authentic.  I started with the sorullos and ordered some tostones with carne frita as my main course.  From the first bite of sorullos, I was brought back to my aunt's kitchen and they were excellent.  Crunchy, and delicious!  The tostones were up next and they did not disappoint.  Finally, the carne frita... It was just like my mother makes back in California.  It was seasoned well and full of flavor, with just enough pork fat to add a lil something to the end.  I got talked into ordering dessert and even though I was already feeling full, how can you say no right?  The tres leeches cake was incredible and something I would definitely order again.  I've been here multiple times with new friends each time.  We came with a group of 10 and everything we ordered was amazing and I have been told by my friends that they have already gone back for more.

We came in around 6:30pm and there were only two other tables seated at the time. Our party of 6 ordered a combo each for the shabu with kimchi broth and house pork broth. The raw meat finally came out after 45 minutes at which point nearly all of the broth was gone (either from being boiled off or us drinking broth while having nothing else to eat). Each person's plate of meat came out staggered around 10 minutes, and the last person's plate had not come out after an hour and a half. Everyone had finished their meal by then. At this point we had informed the waiting staff multiple times that the food for our friend had not come out, so I went up to the front desk to ask what was going on. The waitress told me she thought that we had ordered the Surf and Turf and that that was why it was taking so long. The food finally came out, and after we had asked for the check, they had overcharged us by $12 and left the order as Surf and Turf on the receipt which was $1 more expensive. I went back to the front to show them the mistakes on the receipt to which she responded that the Surf and Turf was only $1 and to just pay the extra money. In response to the $12 overcharged she said that she would take that off if we paid in cash.\\nThe meat itself was pretty good, but no amount of quality would make up for the experience that we had.\\nThis was definitely not a 4.5 star restaurant and sincerely hope that others are not fooled by the yelp reviews in the future. \\n\\nAlso of note, as I was in the front trying to sort this out another customer had ordered food delivery at 5pm and did not receive his food for over 2 hours, prompting him to come into the store himself to find his food."},{"name":"Com Vietnamese Grill Restaurant","address":"4005 Buford Hwy NE, Ste E","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"C√≥m: excellent, authentic Vietnamese food.

We made reservations on a Tuesday night, and were pleasantly surprised to see the restaurant was about half - full around 7:30 when we arrived ( that's pretty good for a Tuesday night in Burlington!) We were met quickly by our friendly waitress and we ordered soft drinks, the toasted ravioli and a salad to share. Unfortunately, the ravioli came out pretty overcooked and the salad came out about 15 min afterwards (also our waitress came back over to ask \\"you guys ordered a salad too right?). The croutons on the caesar salad were great, but unfortunately, the salad was dry and had hardly any dressing on it. No one ever came over to ask how it was, so we couldn't ask for more dressing. Someone ( I think the manager) then came over to let me know that although I had ordered the linguine and clams about 20 min prior, the restaurant was now out of clams. He was rather thoughtful about the situation and let me know I could pick a different protein to substitute. Caught off guard, I quickly said mussels would be fine, but in retrospect, I wish he had suggested I just get a different meal entirely if they were out of clams. Our meals finally arrived (by the way no one had cleared any of our dirty appetizer plates off the table) my partner got the calamari and mussels fra diavolo, and enjoyed it, although thought it could have been spicier/ had more of a kick. A funny part of the meal came, when he asked for parmesan cheese for the dish and our waitress came back with a bowl of cheese in her hand and a spoon, and just plopped a spoonful on his dish. I've NEVER seen parm cheese served that way.  My dish came out prepared as the linguine dish I ordered except with mussels on top instead of clams. Unfortunately, this was just not a dish that made sense, the mussels were awful and I couldn't even eat more than a bite. My waitress never came back to ask me how the meal was and it wasn't until the same manager walked by, saw my dish was untouched and was thoughtful enough to ask if everything was ok - he was very understanding and took it off the bill - which was much appreciated. Overall, the portions of dishes were large and the menu was reasonably priced and had a solid variety of Italian dishes and options to choose from. At the end of the night, we decided to try a dessert and grab a coffee so we picked the apple crisp - which I would not reccomend. It was very sparse in apples and about 3/4 overcooked brown sugar. The coffee was good - but overpriced ($4 for a regular cup of coffee?) Overall, the decor is nice - and the parking is easy. I think there is a lot of potential but they still have some kinks to work out.

I've actually had a better Jason's experience in Tuscaloosa, Alabama so agreed to try this one requested by a lunch date.   \\n\\nOn a Thursday about 1 PM the restaurant was about half full inside and out.  We were greeted by a register order clerk about 15 feet away that could be a carnival barker as we read the menu board who wanted to immediately take our order--classic fast food etiquette.  She was also uninformed when we had basic bread and menu ingredient inquires in which she had to shout down the make line to ask someone who apparently spoke little at all decipherable WORDS.  \\n\\nThe Men's restroom was tiled floor to 4 feet, on the dark side, a little tired looking with minimal freshness and could use a wipe down.  Service looked as if it had not been tended to since previous closing night.  (See my Tips: Restrooms in Lists). \\n\\nWalking through dining area, noticed half dozen or more tables whose patrons had left unfinished portions of sandwiches, soups and salads.  Busing was staffed, fairly prompt but not expedited.  We had to wipe crumbs from our seats. \\n\\nDrink station was clean and well stocked.  Appreciated the fresh brewed tea choices of unsweetened or cane sugar sweetened black and unsweetened black currant flavored.  Nice touch was to see not just fresh cut lemon wedges but also limes.  The salad bar seemed to be clean, fresh and fairly well stocked.  \\n\\nPapa Joes sandwich half and half with cup of chosen Tomato Basil soup served with ripple potato chips $7.29.  Sandwich had roasted turkey breast, asiago, tomato, fresh basil pesto and mayo on toasted herb focaccia.   First bite tasted like someone dropped the salt shaker in it.  It progressively got better for my colleague who decided not to return it.  Tip: you pay for it, speak up and take it back!  \\n\\nBut, here's the reason I wrote the review--the Vegetarian Tomato Basil Soup.  Canned chunky spaghetti sauce with milk and cheese sprinkled on it.  Seriously?  How do you say (nicely), \\"Don't blow smoke up me and expect me to believe it?\\" This time my partner was so disgusted, she marched up to the line and asked for another type of soup that was \\"not canned\\".  They were pleasant enough to give her a Vegetable flavor with tomato and vegetable broth based with classic frozen mixed veges, cabbage, celery, kidney beans and a healthy dose of dried basil.  Much better, but don't read more into it.  \\n\\nChalk Board \\"Very Special\\" was Vera Cruz sandwich of roasted green chiles, saut√©ed onions, chipotle aioli, tomato, and Munster on Telera bread (basically a Mexican \\"French style\\" rectangle) with chicken or pork which I opted for the later.  Pretty tasty served with the classic ripple potato chips for $7.29.  \\n\\nThe $1.99 black currant tea was good.  My friends $2.19 Jason's Cream soda was not--a 12 oz bottle of golden, slightly sweet watery liquid that if it had any vanilla in it the maker held the extract bottle next to it and sneezed.  That's kind of like making a very dry Martini.  \\n\\nFor $20.17 with tax, side options should be included.  The potato chips make you feel like you are being served at either a poor old cheap grandmother's house or the school lunchroom.  However the \\"free ice cream\\" was pretty decent.
