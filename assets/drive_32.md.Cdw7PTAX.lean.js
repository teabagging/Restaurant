But others must have gotten the memo, because the lot was full and I ended up valeting. \\n\\nOur server was Corey, and he was top notch all the way through.  I advised him of the Dine Around card and inquired if we had to order dinner or if we could do small plates.  He required, I could do whatever I liked and that's exactly the way I want my server to reply to me.\\n\\nWe had the Skordalia spread with pita bread.  I told the daughter, this taste like cold mashed potatoes, and asked Corey what it was and he replied Yukon Gold potatoes with garlic, and olive oil.  Well blended, and while cold is not the exactly word for what it was, it wasn't piping hot and I guess that the way its suppose to be.\\n\\nI'm telling you again  COREY was GREAT.  Patient and answered any questions we had.  Made suggestions, stop by enough to make sure we had whatever we needed or wanted and all around good disposition.  He could run a workshop for some of the servers we have here in Atlanta. \\n\\nNext up was the Steamed Mussels, I wish i would have known before we devoured the entire bowl that the was a river of white wine and feta cheese underneath the mussels, but Corey helped us to remedy that by bringing out another plate of pita and we soaked and sopped most of the juice up. \\n\\nThe Horiatiki (tomato salad) was $12, and while I don't know if its worth $12, for a salad of tomato, red onions, and cucumbers and a wedge of feta, it was today.  Maybe its because I love tomatoes and cucumbers together, but it was sooo good, and I could have eaten more of that had the daughter and I not cleared the plate it arrive on.  Just the right amount of vinaigrette and superb flavors, fresh, and chucks of vegetables.  Perfect\\n\\nBy now the daughter is just as pleased as I am.  Mind you, also, that I'm also having what Corey has self-proclaimed as the best Cucumber martini in the city (The Philosopher @ $11 each).  I had two.  While its too early in summer for me to agree with him, what he brought out each time was a frothy cucumber masterpiece. \\n\\nNext up were the Greek Meatballs, which Corey advised were a 50/50 mixture of lamb and beef.  Put to shame any meatball I've had in the past, so the daughter and I decided that next time we are asked to bring meatballs to any function, we are calling Kyma to see if they will cater them for us. \\n\\nFinally we were brought out the Chicken Souvlaki, grilled chicken and vidalia onions skewers  I'm from the south, so any meal that includes vidalia onions gets a high ranking on my list.  These were no exception.  They were accompanied by a dollop of the Tzatziki spread, which made me glad we didn't order it instead of the Skordalia.  The Skordalia was much better. \\n\\nDessert, some kind of banana  pie with chocolate and a banana sorbet.  I not a big fan of bananas, and warm bananas on such a hot day wasn't my thing, but the daughter enjoyed it and ate every drop of it. \\n\\nOverall, after the $25 dine around card was deducted our tab was $66 and some change.  Not bad when you consider that $30 of that was my two martinis and the daughters one mimosa.  \\n\\nWould I pay upwards of $100 (with out the dine around card) for small plates and 3 drinks in the future, probably not, but for a first timer, it was worth it, and gave me and the daughter a new patio to sit on for our weekly mother daughter Sunday chats\\n\\nThe one drawback, and I don't even know if I should mention it because it probably goes along with any patio sitting, but it seemed like we spent a lot of time fanning away flies and mosquito.  There needs to be some bug zappers or mosquito strips hung to make the patio a more enjoyable spot, but it didn't take away from the service or the food one bit."},{"name":"Gourdough's Public House","address":"2700 S Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"We were visiting relatives in Austin and they told us they were going to take us to a place for lunch that made sandwiches out of donuts.

Thankfully we had a reservation coz while we were there, this establishment was indeed packed to the brim aka VERY BUSY.  Maybe for one its a Weekend, or maybe its Restaurant Week.

The MAJOR disappointment dish personally from me, was the Paella Mariscos.  From the conversations I had with our server, she mentioned the Chef likes Artichoke in his Paella.  Those artichokes were OVER-POWERING, and hence made this dish less stellar I was hoping for.  Our server also mentioned since the Chef is FROM SPAIN, this is how he cooks it etc..  Why??  Why??? Do you have to put Artichokes in the Paella??  This is the 1st time, I ever had Paella OVERPOWERED with Artichokes, making this dish UNDER-WHELMING!  *MAJOR SIGH INDEED*  *BIG MEGA BUMMER*\\n\\nThen when I reached home, search the MENU online, it seems ALL THE PAELLA at this establishment contain or have ARTICHOKES!!\\n\\nOh well...  my search for the SEAFOOD Paella which DOES NOT CONTAIN Artichokes shall carry on.. \\n\\nAfter our Dinner, we also opt for having some desserts such as :\\n\\n*  Chocolate Tart ($7.50)\\n*  Chocolate Churros ($7.50)\\n*  Some kind of \\"French\\" Toast ($7.50)\\n\\nMy friends enjoyed their Dinner here.

I told her I tried to call but no one answered. She snapped back at me, \\"we're busy.\\" I suggested maybe we could pull up another chair. She said \\"fine but it's going to be very crowded\\".

But as soon as I saw the buffet, my opinion completely changed. Sometimes you can just look at food and know that it's fresh and well-prepared. That was the case here. \\n\\nSome of the items were like Korean food. If you like Korean bulgogi (marinated strips of beef) and chap-jae (glass noodle salad), then you're going to like this place a lot. Their tofu dish and chicken curry were also great.

He asked if I wanted any scissors to cut the noodles, but I declined. Apparently, it's one continuous noodle!\\n\\nI first tried the broth, and it was nice and strong (the star anise gives it the bite). I then added some black vinegar because it always goes well with beef noodle soup (trust me, i'm taiwanese, they invented this dish). The meat was well flavored. Initially I thought they didn't put too much meat in it, but I found it all at the bottom of the bowl, because there were so much noodles!\\n\\nThe noodles had a wonderful snap to them as you bit into it, with a nice chewy texture.

That one word captures our four-hour dining experience with the six-course tasting menu and wine pairings at Bauhaus Restaurant last weekend.\\n\\nAnd as with any great magic show, my wife and I were left wondering afterwards: How did they do that?!? \\n\\nWe actually arrived without any real expectations ... perhaps even a little dubious of eating 'German' food again having grown up with many of the staple dishes found on the menu. \\n\\nBut the closest we came to any 'traditional' foods was the amazing bread - baked just up the street - which took us back to our Gro√üm√ºtters' kitchens and childhoods steeped in roulade, wiener schnitzel, sauerbraten and sp√§tzle. For a moment, I wished I could have expressed my appreciation in my long-forgotten mother tongue ... beyond a simple \\"Danke.\\" But the bread was the only real ode to the restaurant's German roots that we ate that night.\\n\\nFrom there, the evening was an intimate journey into the food courses and wine pairings. Each dish was fully introduced, along with the rationale for its paired alcoholic accompaniment.\\n\\nGM Daniel Klintworth explained that Bauhaus used to play it safer with stereotypical pairings that would 'work' but decided to stretch their customers' palates by introducing them to wines they would not likely ever purchase, or often be able to buy in our BC liquor stores. (He even graciously toured me through their wine cellar to note some of the unique bottles in their collection). \\n\\nIn my humble opinion, it's a winning strategy ... not aiming for perfection but delivering a unique 'marriage' of food and wine that can't be duplicated anywhere else. As a result, we enjoyed a trip around the world with bottles from Uruguay, Hungary, Spain, Canada, Germany, and Italy. (While there was one swing and a miss ... all the other pairings were  spectacular home runs). \\n\\nBesides the amazing dishes, service was impeccable. Even owner Uwe Boll was attentive but never intrusive. For some diners, he received a simple nod to his inquiries about their dining experience that evening; for others, like us, he was happy to engage in deeper conversation (and share some amazing grappa - thank you).\\n\\nEvery dining experience comes with its inherent 'risks' and rewards. I sometimes hesitate to write reviews because I can't guarantee the same experience for any future diners. I'm not even sure we'll ever recapture that same magic in subsequent visits ... but for at least one evening at the Bauhaus, it was truly \\"magisch!\\""},{"name":"PDX Sliders","address":"3111 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"This place has the best sliders in Portland, the fries are great service was fast went on a Wednesday at lunch time place was full but we were in and out in 45 minutes if you like sliders this is the place to go."},{"name":"Buffet Palace","address":"4608 West Gate Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Is this great chinese food?

I endured!\\nIt took only a moment for the host to introduce us to the way of the restaurant and to tell us he would also be our server. It was not to happen. By the time they figured out who our server was going to be, at least 15 minutes went by. We ordered our drinks and 10 minutes later he came back for our orders. 10 minutes later I asked if we could have some bread. It came immediately. I guess everything is homemade. The bread and butter were fine and fresh.\\nThe meals arrived. My (slightly overcooked) halibut sat on a bed of what looked like a bag of Rice a Roni, boiled. A generous pile of almost cooked fresh green beans were on the plate. There were a couple of pieces of yellow and red pepper in the beans. There was an odd prune-like topping for the halibut. I kept getting strange combinations of flavors as I was eating my dinner. An almond here, a prune there, some weird spice. Nothing made sense. It was all very unevenly mixed.\\nMy husband enjoyed his medium rare tenderloin. However, at one point when my husband had two bites left, the host stuck his face over my husband's steak to see if it was cooked properly. It was very odd. \\nOur waiter had checked on us. \\nOne of my biggest pet peeves is crooked fork tines. Especially when I'm paying $35 for an entree.  I had to ask for a new fork. I'm sure after having to ask earlier if anyone else had mentioned that is was freezing, and for the bread,  our waiter might have not been thrilled with me.\\nWe had a Groupon and the rules were quite specific. You had to order at least an entree a piece, you couldn't eat in the bar, happy hour, blah blah blah. But I did not see that they would add on the tip. It was almost 20% and the amount was what we were planning on leaving, but really! If you don't want to honor a Groupon, don't sign up for the thing.\\nAnd the final straw was the not so great lounge singer, pianist, and drummer.

When we arrived, the place was fully packed and after a long wait we were finally seated on the second floor. Its hard wood floors, red brick walls, natural lighting, and light bulbs that streamed from the ceilings defined the rustic d√©cor. There was a stack of waffles placed by the window to keep those waiting from walking away. The vibe was hipsterish and bustling downstairs comparing to the Zen-like ambiance we experienced on the second floor. \\n\\nMy Paella ($13) was comprised of one fried egg sunny side up, curried orzo, spicy chorizo, zucchini, red pepper, roasted corn, grano padano, watercress, avocado, and tomato salad. It was beautifully plated with the egg was perfectly runny surrounded by striking colors and fresh ingredients. Even though the other ingredients were there to counteract the saltiness of the chorizo, I wished there was more curried orzo or maybe even rice in this dish so the chorizo would not have hijacked the entire dish. A touch a saffron would have done the job too since it is usually included as a baseline ingredient.\\n\\nFor dessert, the Waffle ($3.15) came with our choice of Milk Chocolate Lavender Sauce ($1). The sauce was passable, but the waffle was chewy and difficult to cut. The waffles at Syrup easily trump the ones here.\\n\\nService was attentive and friendly. Overall, I was impressed with the freshness of the ingredients, the plating, and a touch of innovation in the cuisine. However, the chorizo could be less salty and the Waffle should've been made by the order. Despite all the raving reviews, I was surprisingly unimpressed by the experience. 2.5 stars for the visit.

I visited the restaurant on a Wednesday evening, and although the place was busy, there was no wait for a table for a party of three.Upon walking into the entrance you are greeted by a showcase of their uncooked sausages, as well as a huge display of their ready to eat desserts. There was a cool german ambiance about the place including a couple of old fogeys playing German tunes while we were there. Looking over the menu, I decided to go all out and order their Autobahn buffet. I was very pleased with that decision as the buffet had at least 6 different types of sausage, as well as meatloaf,potatoes,beans,mac & cheese,saurkraut,stew, & bread. Everything I tried, I absolutely loved. Two of my favorite items were the garlic knockwurst & the green beans with bacon. I devoured two large dishes in record time & decided to call it quits so I could have some dessert. Now dessert is not included with the buffet, but for an extra $2.50, you can have any dessert selection from the showcase. I'd recommend trying the giant cream puff if you've never had it before, but I tried a piece of chocolate pie instead this time & was not dissapointed. I't was so good I bought a second piece to bring home to my wife. I did not drink any alcohol this night, but it did look like a fun place to drink some good german beer on tap.

When I say \\"learned,\\" I mean that I have been coming here on Wednesday nights off and on (i.e. at least one of every three) for the better part of two years and I certainly enjoyed the excuse of making your place a mid-week social hub, being charged the Wed-night special rate every time!  Until tonight.... Without warning or notice, that Wednesday rate converted to the something other than the special Wednesday night price. That price now became almost double the now former Wednesday night rate. The change apparently was one week ago.... The reason expressed was minimum wage increases. Well, fair enough, but those minimum wage increases actually have yet to take legal effect in the sense that such is a \\"good\\" justification for the changes. I am sad that this 1) happened at all, and 2) lacked any notice to the loyal customer base. To be fair, the delightful server noticed my group's dismay and graciously, seriously sans our prompt, got the manager to comp us to the point it was what we believed the special to be. However, despite my being a middle class wage earner of this city who could afford regular priced drinks, Burnside brewing has lost me as a customer (not only by the ditching of the deal, but also in the manner in which it was done - secretively). To those they hope will eventually move into my place with the growth of Portland as a whole, cheers. C'est la vie B-Side, your staff was nice enough tonight (and I really do appreciate the server advocating for us! She was way cool!), but clearly your priorities don't align with your once loyal customer base. I hope your future serves you well! I must admit, I assume it will.

Anyway, I decided one night to give Thyago's another shot. BIG MISTAKE. I ordered something simple....something any sub shop on the eastern seaboard could easily make. I ordered a small Italian sub, no oil, no hots. Simple, right? Not for them. I dragged myself out to pick it up because I didn't feel like waiting 45 minutes for a sub. Got the sandwich home only to discover than my Italian sub had nothing on it but meat and cheese. WHAT? No lettuce, no tomato, no pickle, no onion...nothing. So naturally I called back to get another sub and the girl that answered told me that I should have specified that I wanted those things on my Italian sub because they don't put that stuff on unless you specifically ask for it. WHAT???  Now, I've ordered many, many Italian subs in the past and they have ALWAYS come with theses toppings....am I crazy? So finally I get the replacement, get it home....by this time I'm STARVING, only to open it up, take a bite and realize that the bread is stale, there are STILL no pickles, and overall the sub leaves MUCH to be desired. Now I'm NOT a picky person, I'm really not. Just fresh bread, the toppings that r supposed to be there, and someone on the phone that knows what they're talking about. That's all I ask.

Almost every seat was taken. The waitress was very knowledgeable and friendly, the only bizarre thing she did was take our food order and then walk away before asking if we wanted to order drinks too. Fortunately, every table has a large carafe of water, that is frequently replenished. You will need it. Much of the food is horrendously oversalted, even considering that it is Asian.  I actually had to order a plain steamed rice just to cut all the salt, water alone was not enough. \\n\\nOur waitress steered us toward the crispy Arctic char rolls and we were very glad that she did. They were delicious, and the only thing we had that I thought showed a judicious use of salt. The lacquered barbecued pork was a piece of lean pork tenderloin, drenched in a supersalty red sauce and with no apparent crispiness that I could discern, atop some sort of rice cake that was so salty that even my husband, who is much less fussy about seasoning, couldn't eat it. We didn't forget our veggies, balancing our meal with some very fresh, simply cooked bok choy that would have been perfect if not for the dreaded salt shaker and some forgettable potstickers filled with mushrooms and greens (and lots of salt). We also tried an order of three overstuffed short rib tacos, another waitress recommendation, and would have loved them were they not heavily salted too.\\n\\nWe were stuffed for sixty bucks for the two of us, although if we had been drinking the bill could have easily topped a hundred. This is a fun place, great ambiance, inventive menu, freshly made food, and if they would only hide the salt shakers from the chefs, I could easily award four, perhaps even five, stars.

Went with my S.O. last week and as usual the food was good and the server was a d**k. \\n\\nFOOD: We had the tarte alsacienne and the escargots to start. Both dishes were good without being extraordinary. The snails were a tad on the salty & chewy side. The bread was delicious and included with the meal, which seems to be a rare treat around town these days. The mains were very good - confit de canard with pleasantly crispy skin and beef tenderloin that was remarkably soft and flavourful. Side dishes were also tasty. The food and wine prices are significantly below what you'd pay for comparable fare elsewhere.\\n\\nSERVICE: I admit the service was efficient overall but the server was so surly it was laughable. It was crystal clear that he'd rather be anywhere else than there and treated us as if it our presence were extremely irritating. No smiles or friendliness here. He even checked his watch while I was ordering my starter. Wow.\\n\\nAMBIANCE: Pretty cramped and very noisy. We were stuck in the centre row of tables for two. People kept walking past us on either side and we felt like we were in the way most of the time - avoid these if you go. We moved to a side booth when one was free and that was much better. \\n\\nPREVIOUS TWO VISITS: \\nLast year: nothing stands out in my mind so the food & service were good.\\nPrevious year: Had a near-shouting match with the server. Ordered Steak frites with a side of herb butter. The server really wanted me to have echalote (shallot) sauce but I stuck to my butter. The meat was so tough I could barely cut it. I told the server and we had the following discussion in FRENCH: He replied, \\"Well that's why you should've had the echalote sauce!\\"\\n\\"What!?\\"\\n\\"Yes, the meat is onglet, and you must have it with echalote sauce!\\"\\nNow I get it. I've been served onglet a l'echalote, which is a far cry from steak frites as it was listed on the menu. I've eaten in France literally hundreds of times so I know that onglet a l'echalote and steak frites are completely different. Steak is steak and onglet is hanger steak - not what I wanted and not what I ordered. AS IF echalote sauce would have made the hanger steak edible anyway!! Even for hanger steak, this piece was particularly tough. I told the waiter I just wanted steak frites, not onglet. He acted like I was in the wrong and didn't take it off the bill or offer to replace it. Don't worry about this happening to you - they've changed the menu since and now clearly list the different cuts.\\n\\nVERDICT: Despite the fact that some of the waiters are real little beyotches, I still give it 4 stars because the food is very good and the prices (for wine too) are GREAT. Yep, I'll go back & get snarled at for that, plus it's a short walk from home. Make sure you reserve if you go, especially for a Friday or Saturday - they're booked solid well in advance.

The garnish on mine was a pork rind and that salty bite at the end of a sweet and bitter drink was perfect. The table ahead of us was enjoying their evening and it ended up passing into our reservation time. The manager, Stefan I believe was his name, came over and apologized. We ended up talking for a while about the restaurant since I used to work in the food industry and he was a delightful person to chat with. \\n\\nDinner was amazing. We had the tasting menu with drink pairing while sitting at the chef's counter. If you're the type of foodie that cares just as much about how your food is MADE as much as how it TASTES... SIT THERE! We were able to chat with the grill cook through the night because he was working right in front of us. All of the staff was amazing and I feel awful for not remembering our waitresses name but she was exceptional as well. Really, I can't say enough about the level of service we received from everyone we interacted with. \\n\\nBack to the food: Each course was unique and unexpected. The squid slaw was probably the best squid dish I've had and the avocado cream at the bottom is divine. The chicken skin deviled egg was a beautiful little salty/umami bite to cleanse the fattiness of the avocado cream. Next up was the black-eyed pea fritter. I will be honest... I don't like black-eyed peas, but I loved this. The mushroom custard sounded very interesting and it was. I am a huge fan of a classic creamed mushroom soup and it had similar flavors. The shrimp and lobster hand pie was, I believe, my fiance's favorite of the night. A nice buttery flaky crust with shrimp and lobster inside... yum. The next course was fish in a pork fat dashi and it was a nice, light bit in the middle of the meal. Following this was a sausage stuffed quail leg that I would happily eat any day of the week, twice on the same day. The final savory course was a dry aged ribeye with charred broccoli. In my heart of hearts, I'm a steak man and any time meat has been dry aged to increase the flavor, I'm all over that. The two dessert courses were stunning. The first was a thyme pavlova with a citrus sauce (if I remember right). It was light, crumbly, and just slightly sweet. This is great for me as I'm not usually a \\"sweets\\" type of person. Last, but certainly not least, was the chocolate pecan bar with sweet potato puree and toasted marshmallow. It was like someone took a chocolate pie, pecan pie, and sweet potato pie and said, \\"Let's make a single dessert out of these. Whoever said that is a genius.\\n\\nThis was our first time coming to Barley Swine but it will NOT be the last. Between the excellent service of our waitress, the attention and conversation of Stefan, and the unforgettable food offered by Chef Bryce and his team, both my fiance and I remarked that this will become a restaurant we will come back to time and time again.\\n\\nThank you so much to the staff of Barley Swine for an amazing evening out!\\n\\nBen R."},{"name":"Panera Bread","address":"11563 NE Glenn Widing Dr","city":"Portland","stars":"2.5","text":"I'd love to give panera a much better rating but there's no way I can continue to remain silent!

I'm not a creditable source for authenticity, as I'm a white person from Georgia, so be forewarned.\\n\\nThe first time I went I ordered the beef fried rice, and my partner ordered General Tso's chicken. I thought the portion was rather small for the price. However, after finishing my fried rice I realized it was entirely too much and I felt sick the rest of the day. Silly me. The General Tso's was delicious. The chicken was large chunks of white meat perfectly breaded and fried. The sauce was scrumptious.\\n\\nI found the booths a little small for my size -- supah fat -- so beware of that if it's something you need to consider. They do have half booth/tables in the back, which fit very comfortably, and had no problem moving us when requested.\\n\\nThe second time I ordered the General Tso's and the partner had Szechuan Chicken. Both dishes were delicious. Again the chicken was well cooked and white meat. Everything was hot and fresh. I got the dinner meal which came with a spring roll and BBQ pork. I found the BBQ pork rather bland. The spring roll was perfectly cooked and crispy, though not greasy. I got the fried rice, which I did not feel complimented my food so I recommend sticking with the steamed rice. Mr. B also ordered a beer from China and was not disappointed.\\n\\nWe ended up both bringing home leftovers, and thus got 2 meals out of our order. I even shared some with my inlaws who were visiting.\\n\\nThe third time we ordered delivery. The food came quickly and was still hot. I got the beef and mushroom. The beef was tender and had a great, subtle flavor. That's something I noted about the fried rice the first time too. The sliced beef is excellent. The quality and taste is the best I've had in Portland/Beaverton area. I can't remember it being so good since I left GA years ago.\\n\\nI got 2.5 portions out of this. I ate the 0.5 in the morning with some rice for breakfast.\\n\\nThe final order, the day of this review actually, we also ordered delivery. I got the Mongolian Beef and Mr. B ordered Kung Pao chicken. My Mongolian Beef was great. The amount of spice was right, the beef was beautiful. Same compliments as above. I have had 2 meals from it thus far, and have enough for a third tomorrow. Unfortunately the partner didn't particular care for his Kung Pao chicken. Something about how it smells really turned him off. We think it might be the celery. I didn't much care for the look of it either, so I didn't try it. We'll probably have our roommates try it tomorrow to see what they think.\\n\\nOverall, I think this restaurant is very good. It's always clean. The service has been quick and friendly. They are kind enough to put up with our questions. I did agree, at first, that the price for the portion size wasn't right. However, I've changed my mind on that front. The only contention I have is spring rolls are $3.50 for 2. That seems a bit much. Four people will spend $7 extra dollars to have a spring roll.

When I get to come to The Coop, I get just as excited as when I get to go to Disney. This place definitely feels like it's brother, 4 Rivers, in that it's a cafeteria style joint where you get your food in the lineup and sit down where is available. The dining room is about the most eclectic thing you'll ever see; you'd be hard pressed to find two chair or tables that look alike. They are all different, and it's wonderful. Some other nice touches include the map on the wall that let's you put a little sticker dot where you're from. People from Maine to Pakistan have come to enjoy The Coop.\\n\\nSo they have their standard menu, which is full of delectable sounding options, and then they have their weekly specials for breakfast, main meals, and dessert. Next week's special is peach glazed chicken, by the way, so expect another check-in from me soon. Once you pass the dessert showcase and remember that you'd rather have the bread pudding, you get to place your order, watch them pile it up on your tray, and have a seat. \\n\\nSo on this trip, I got the Chicken N' Waffles (with Maple Bourbon drizzle). I forked up the $5 to add two fixins & a biscuit (I subbed cornbread for the biscuit). My two fixins of choice were Fresh Fried Okra and Creamed Corn. I gotta tell you, The Coop has some of the best chicken and waffles in all of Orlando. The breading on the tenders is light and flaky and adds that nice crunch you want. The waffles is obviously freshly made in a waffle maker. Firm and chewy and so good. I recommend this dish first and foremost. The okra was good. It was crisp and not oily or anything. The creamed corn is redonkulous. It's not too sweet. It blurs the line, just like the chicken and waffles themselves. \\n\\nMy girlfriend, on the other hand, got the New Orleans Po-Boy (shrimp) with a fixin of the Bread Pudding. It was ok. It was a good sandwich, but it wasn't like, mind blowing. The shrimp was cooked well, but the sandwich just wasn't bursting with flavor like you want. The bread pudding was the best thing. It was the perfect moisture level and the perfect sweetness level. The people on the line will ask you if you want extra drizzle. Always say yes. Oh, and I forget to mention the cornbread. It was ok. I was expecting the same quality as from 4 Rivers, but that is not what I got. It was ok.\\n\\nOverall, I love this place. I feel bad that I've had nothing but the chicken and waffles when coming here, but I fully plan on making my way through this menu one item at a time."},{"name":"Gourdough's Public House","address":"2700 S Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I really liked the ambiance at this place.

I paid this bistro another visit yesterday afternoon for lunch and my experience was not as excellent at the first time around. \\n\\nThe place was not busy at all, but it was late for lunch--around 2pm. There were several ladies and a gentleman seated at the bar, a gentleman at the booth who kept walking in and out of the bistro while talking on the phone (he eventually left, but not before siting at his table yelling into his phone for several minutes), and there also seemed to be a few employees who were off but stopping by for a bite to eat, and two gentlemen who looked like they had just finished their lunch and were getting ready to leave. \\n\\nI sat down and the server behind the counter promptly met me at my table to take my drink order. I hadn't had much time to look at the menu so asked if I could have a couple of minutes to decide on a coffee. About 10 minutes later, much to my frustration, she returned to take my order. She apologize for the delay--apparently they were having technical issues with their computer while she was trying to cash out another customer so it took a minute to get everything up and running. She was sweet about it, so I overlooked it. I asked her several questions about the menu and she was very informed and then placed my order.\\n\\nThe coffee was quickly delivered. And, just a few minutes later, my food was delivered. I had the blueberry pancakes this time. They were slightly undercooked, but still delicious and chock full of blueberries. They also came with blueberries on top (not a compote, but fresh blueberries which is a plus). I ordered the Bohemian coffee--definitiely having that one again. However, it was about 20  minutes before I saw her again. During that time, another young lady and a gentelmen walked in (separately) and I think she was the only one working. \\n\\nOr at least I thought. The people sitting at the bar had kept looking at me; especially after I was done with my meal and was waiting on the server to return so I could ask for the check. At some point, another young lady walked in and joined the one who had previously arrived. They ordered, and then several of the \\"customers\\" at the bar delivered their food and gave them silverware. \\n\\nWHAT THA?!\\n\\nThis whole time they (about 5 of them) had noticed me waiting to order, waiting for a refill, and waiting for my bill and hadn't even bothered to walk over and ask if I needed anything while this single server tried to maintain 3 tabless on her own while having technical issues. This really pissed me off. \\n\\nThe server was kind enough to comp my coffee because of the long wait times, which I greatly appreciated. However, because of the lack of customer service from the other employees who seemed to be more interested in flirting with each other the pancakes that were slightly undercooked, La Mongerie gets only 3 stars this time around. \\n\\nI will still be going back; there are a few other things on the menu I'd like to try and the place itself is just charming. But I left yesterday feeling a bit disillusioned. \\n\\nMaybe La Mongerie's appeal is only in its first impression."},{"name":"Hopdoddy Burger Bar","address":"1400 S Congress Ave, Ste A190","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I LOVE this place but it has gotten so popular that the lines are more than daunting... they are HORRIBLE!!

My friend suggested Sea Level after seeing a great review on Phantom Gourmet. The restaurant definitely lived up to our expectations. First off, it was in a lovely setting at Pickering Wharf. Next, it made us happy that they accommodated our large-ish group reservation, so we could see the PEM exhibit at a leisurely pace without worrying about our dinner plans. Once at the restaurant, staff was very welcoming. The interior was aesthetically pleasing with large windows showing off the waterway view. We started with a round of drinks, and speaking for myself, I had a great pour on my Makers on the rocks. On to the food, which was the best part of the visit! A few in our group sampled oysters and little necks from the raw bar. They were a hit with those of us who had them. I had a half-dozen oysters and they were delish! Plump and sweet and perfect! Some at our table had the fried cauliflower and O-strings apps. I sampled both and they were tasty, especially the o-strings dipped in the chipotle-ranch sauce that accompanied them. For entrees, I and three others split two pizzas: a margherita and the white clam. Both were outstanding and each was very flavorful. The white clam had an abundance of fresh shucked quahog clams and the garlic and cheese provided exceptional flavor. The balsamic glaze on the Margherita pizza put it over the top! My brother-in-law had the perch tacos from the specials menu, and while he mentioned they were messy to eat, he noted how tasty they were, too. One sister had and raved about the beet salad. We finished with a couple of 'splittable' desserts: a key lime pie, that was more like a key lime pudding (it was awesome!) and two orders of bite-sized donuts. The donuts were drizzled with chocolate sauce can dusted with confection sugar. They were accompanied by a sweet dipping sauce and all combined they were perfection in the form of a bite-sized dessert! As we were finishing up and getting ready to head home around 6:00 pm, the place was filling up with a good crowd, which I took as testament to Sea Level's excellence.

Unfortunately, appearances can be deceiving. \\n\\nI will admit I had the best French onion soup of my entire life here. It was so good. Absolutely amazing. But that appetizer was the climax which is quite sad. \\n\\nOur mussels were tasty and plump but the broth it was cooked in lacking in flavor or a punch. It didn't really accentuate the mussels. \\n\\nMy steak was pretty meh. My partner's steak was equally meh. There were actually salt granules in her salad which were an unexpected, unwanted surprise. \\n\\nI will also admit we discussed how strange it felt being in a restaurant with 100% male staff. It stood out and felt quite odd. I can't recall any other restaurant that's had all male or all female staff. \\n\\nThe food was extremely salty. I had so much water I felt bloated. We came home and had more water. I've never had such a salty meal in as long as I can remember. \\n\\nAside from my A++++++ french onion soup, there was nothing that would bring me back here. In my opinion there's already two other amazing French restaurants in town that can blow this place out of the water.

Most importantly, the ambiance is way off.  I think of sushi being a peaceful experience, if somewhat exotic at times.   Fuji was loud and strange on a Friday night, full of south shore dudes who may or may not have gone to my high school... with large flat screen TVs showing the Red Sox game.

My husband ordered an acid-cooked NY strip steak entree, which our clueless waitress had no idea was on the menu, and kept trying to confirm as the filet mignon entree, which was much more expensive.  After showing her the menu to confirm that the dish existed, we thought things were fine.  Then another waitress came over to tell my husband that they were out of that, but that there was filet mignon...then walked away without giving him a menu.  When we flagged down our waitress again, my man grabbed a menu and ordered some pork dish...and we thought that was the end of it...until our freaking waitress came back AGAIN to ask my husband if he wanted the filet mignon!?!?!?  Maddening.\\n\\nLong story short, the waitstaff was inattentive and clueless and our sushi and entrees ended up coming out so far apart from each other that all of us were done eating when my husband's food finally came out (which by the way was nasty and gristly, and cooked completely to death).  Also, did I mention that the menu here offers such yucky offerings as sushi hand rolls containing ingredients like mozzarella cheese, bacon, and hamburger...ack!   Cheese and sushi don't mix...at least not in my mouth.\\n\\nTo be fair tho, I should mention that the tetaki tuna was delicious (the only star i'm awarding goes to that), and my lemongrass chicken wasn't too bad...a bit bland but edible."},{"name":"Fuji 1546 Restaurant and Bar","address":"1546 Hancock St","city":"Quincy","stars":"3.5","text":"I love sushi so unless it's off-tasting, I usually like it.

Quick-style. \\n          It was my birthday and I am one of those people who enjoys adventurous eating, so where else could we go but the new and highly anticipated Barley Swine? When we got there at 7:45 we were told it would be an hour and a half wait. Okay. What's a good dinner without a little suspense?

We were seated with another group of three who turned out to be LOTS of fun. The host/matchmaker, Jason, has a good eye for pairing people who would seem to get along. This is KEY, as brushing elbows with a stranger as you nibble the meat off a pig tail should not be and awkward experience. I say nibble, but really the pig tail comes with a small crispy piece from the end of the tail and one or two huge chunks off the lower spine area so you end up with a HUGE piece of crispy, melt in your mouth pork fat and sweet tail meat. A fun, filling, 1/2 familiar, 1/2 exotic type dish. Probably the best dish of the night, although EVERYTHING was excellent. We asked for extra olives (which is what they serve instead of bread when you first sit down) because the two fellas that I was with, both vehement olive haters, ate most of them. That says it all right there, I think. \\n   Let me take a moment here to praise our servers of the night, Clara and Roxanne. Attentive but not intrusive, funny and knowledgeable, they guided us through a very enjoyable evening with skill and perfect pace. Hooray for great servers!! \\n    This is a place that takes the familiar flavors that we love, like bacon,  tender beef, sweet corn, butter and beer and turns them around so we can see another side of them.

We wanted shots of tequila so we asked our waitress what they had and her response was, \\"You name it, we have it.\\" And she started rattling off what they had, but didn't say what I was looking for so she said they had a list she could bring over for me. She sent over the bartender who repeated the same list and it certainly wasn't the extensive list I was expecting. Ordered shots of Patron, which ended up being $10 a shot!!!! Placed our meal order. The appetizer came out sizzling hot and literally 3 minutes later our meals came out....cold. I had ordered a steak and cheese with no peppers and it was oozing with peppers. I let it sit there and just ate the appetizer. A man came around asking how our meals were and I told him I had asked for no peppers and he was very apologetic, very nice, and went and got me a new sandwich and fries and brought it right back out. It wasn't a bad sandwich, but there was a strange marinade on it. A few minutes later, the waitress came back and said the owner wanted to buy us a round of drinks. I wanted another tequila shot, since I wasn't drinking beer, so we asked for another round of shots. They must have brought us the house tequila because it was disgusting! Don't offer to buy a round of shots if it's not what I have already been drinking!

This place is MORE than worth checking out! Their food is good and their drinks are strong. Two of my favorite qualities in a restaurant! But you have to know, when your drinks are done right the place is gonna be a bit louder than your typical boring dine-in (sorry not sorry!!). Me and my girlfriend come here about once a month to get our fix. The purple margaritas(aka heavy hitters) are strong, so beware, these bad boys have everclear which you can't even taste because they're so deliciously made! We call it truth serum because by the end of our outing we're telling each other things that we typically wouldn't(this can be good and bad lol). Now we each just have one and share a lime/coconut mix after(also quite delicious!) which leaves us feeling just right. We also typically share either the shrimp quesadillas or the sampler appetizer, both of which we've never been disappointed with. The queso compuesto is also quite good! And finally, the main reason I was convinced to write this in the first place... the service we have received the past 3 times has been absolutely PHENOMENAL!! If you want a top notch server, I recommend that you ask for Ryan Sutton by name. He's been astounding at his capabilities of not only remembering us, but also remembering what we order, what we drink, and even the small details about ourselves that we happen to bring up in our conversations. As a previous manager of a restaurant, that is a quality I would have quite literally begged for in an employee!  He makes sure we're well taken care of when we dine in, and now we check to see if he's working before we're even seated. Tonight we also had the pleasure of meeting the GM of the restaurant(Roxanne) who was also very awesome. She sat with us in our booth and talked with us like we'd all known each other for yearsl! Not a common quality in a manager, and one I wish I saw more of these days!!

The risotto dish was served in a crust made of baked cheese which was also on the salty side. The salad was quite good. Dessert was a custard in a pie crust with fresh cut pear and cherries with sugar sprinkled on top. The overall experience was good but not over-the-top good that the price tag promised. Portions were okay-sized, not overly generous.

The restaurant itself is \\"pincho\\", but it's intimate and well-decorated.  We had the table next to the window (looking out onto Woburn square) and our waiter (Hernando) was helpful, informative, answered our questions, and made great suggestions.  We arrived at 6 PM (with reservations) as the second party in the place, but after awhile, the restaurant was full.  I would say that they could have used one more waiter to speed things along, but our server was fully attentive when he needed to be.  \\n\\nI settled on a medium-bodied rioja wine, while my other friends ordered the rose' (and one settled on the cabernet).  Tapas can be difficult when you're with a group who doesn't eat \\"strange foods\\", but I did enjoy the quail legs and thought we'd ordered the sweetbreads, but they never arrived (I wanted to try them!).  But with all the giggling, I think Hernando didn't realize we were serious about ordering them!  I'll be back on my own to eat the things that no one would try (like the monkfish). \\n\\nAs a group, we were given \\"house pinchos\\", which were cubes of an omelet with zucchini and onion (yum). We enjoyed a creamy, mellow Manchego cheese, accompanied by the house chorizo sausage and oil-cured olives.  The cheese was out of this world, as was the sausage.  The restaurant provides endless bread for sopping up the garlic oils or sauces that accompany many dishes.  Next up, the empanadas!  The kobe beef was delicious, as was the spinach and blue cheese combo.  I would highly recommend eating a thousand of these!  Crispy without being oily and pure comfort!  We also shared the fried calamari, which was a bit different than what you get in an Italian place.  The octopus rings were a bit larger, but delicious.  The breading was a bit plain, and may need salt, but the garlic aioli served for dipping was just what the dish needed!  We also enjoyed the shrimp in garlic oil, which was dusted with real, smoked Spanish paprika.  Additionally, we ordered a wedge of the traditional Spanish omelet, made with potatoes and onion.  One of my favorites was the fried artichoke hearts!\\n\\nNeedless to say, I could have eaten my way thru the menu, but my friends have bird-like appetites, so I went along with the sharing of two desserts:  the flan and the almond custard (apologies for not having it's real Spanish name down).  The flan had a great texture, and we all really loved the syrup it was covered with; I really enjoyed the uniqueness of the almond custard.  It was softer in texture and it seemed it hid a ground almond paste of some kind as you dug down thru the center of the dish. A faint cinnamon flavor was evident and it wasn't overly sweet, but it was a great palate cleanser after all our garlicky fish tapas.  \\n\\nI look forward to going back to eat my way across the rest of the menu!"},{"name":"Phoebe's Diner","address":"533 W Oltorf St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"The staff was really friendly and the food was great.

I came in on a Sunday and was prepared to wait but was disappointed to find out that the wait was going to be 90 minutes. Apparently, Sunday is their busiest day. I did come in at 11:00am which was probably their peak hour. The wait attendant was very kind and told me that I could leave and walk around the area (there's tons to do and see in the near vicinity) and come back in 80 minutes. I decided to take her advice and take a stroll. I came back in about 90 minutes and she told me she called my name earlier but that she'd still put me in the next available spot. They were kind enough not to bump me to the back of the list.\\n\\nAfter being seated, I decided to order a paella with some sausages and bacon. The dish came out fairly prompt ( considering how packed the restaurant was ). The paella was incredibly delicious. I could find no fault in any of it.\\nI also ordered a waffle with a white chocolate lavendar sauce. The waffle was great. Not too sweet, and had a nice texture to it. To be honest though, you can find waffles of similar quality elsewhere, so I wouldn't come here just for the waffles. The sauce however was divine.\\n\\nAll in all, the food was perfect. I never had a brunch more pleasing to the palette. The flavours were distinct and never overpowering. Nothing was either too sweet or too salty. It was just incredible. The ingredients were also of the highest standards. Eggs were some kind of free range organic type that had yolk that was darker than standard eggs. The sausage was delicious as well.\\n\\nService was very friendly and attentive. They were really well prepared for the rush and dealt with all the customers in an efficient and kind manner. The waiter who attended to us was very friendly and helpful when it came to describing the menu.\\n\\nI was so impressed that I've been back here a couple more times.

Gimelli pasta & chicken was reportedly excellent. \\nWarm, kitschy decor. Bartender made great wine recommendations.  Manager was visible and effective.

I've tried a bunch of places and saw this place on the way to work and we decided to try it.  I think the drama with the name is kind of comical.  Weren't these technically the kids that were doing the cooking at the original place?  Anyway, I don't give a shit, I'm not from here and have no nostalgic love of your Southerly BBQ Mecca.  I will worship your false god if he's going to bless me with delicious meats minus a 45 minute pilgrimage to Lockheart.  (Yeah, I know I spelled it wrong on purpose.) \\n\\nWhen you walk in  you'll see it is similar to Rudy's and they serve you meats by weight... Actually, I don't care how they serve it, that's unnecessary information.\\n\\nYour first decision will be which sides you are not going to eat the most.  You're choices are... something like, maybe bread, and something with corn in it, they probably have mac & cheese,  and a bunch of other stuff that I'm not going to eat anyway.  Seriously, this meat takes like a day to cook, I don't want them wasting time on sides I'm not going to eat.  Also, to date, I've never once been at a BBQ place and been like, \\"OH MY GOD!  I have to come back here for these... beans.\\"  Said, No One Ever.\\n\\nThen you walk up some nice person at the counter who'll whip out their meat and present it to you.  And it is a beautiful thing.  But seriously...  The turkey was the best I've ever had.  It was so juicy and smokey.  I actually tried someone else's because I wouldn't normally order it, but this has changed my opinion and I would get some next time.  The pork ribs were falling off the bone and I liked the seasoning on them.  I also got the brisket which was some of the best I've had.  When the dude was slicing it, it was super thick and I was thinking that was unusual because it sometimes is more tough that way.  Nope.  You totally could just pull it apart with ease.  Melt in your mouth and bark-alicious.  Yum.  I couldn't help but get a beef rib too.  I asked for two initially and they laughed at me and I see why.  They were monsters and the peppery bark was magical.\\n\\nThe BBQ sauces were also decent.  They have 3, but honestly it was more like two.  One was mustard-based and tangy similar to Salt Lick and another was similar to Rudy's sissy sauce.    The 3rd one was supposed to be spicy, but I didn't think it was either here or there.

However, Fritz just hasn't been filling the void like it should, and I was definitely in the mood for a new experience, and as beautiful as I thought I looked that day, I decided to ask myself out on a very romantic lunch date. Of course, I said yes.\\n\\nTo me, a critical aspect in what makes a restaurant good is how well they handle lone diners. It's not such an uncommon thing; food is still delicious and life is still beautiful even if there isn't anyone else around, and if you wait for accompaniment in order to try new things, you're going to miss out on a lot. That being said, I enjoy solo meals and the establishments that accommodate me. Coast, unfortunately, didn't exactly hit the ground running.\\n\\nI waited patiently at the front for the host to seat another couple. He came back to me and looked at me expectantly, I smiled and said, \\"For one,\\" and followed when he picked up a menu. I felt a little stupid when I ended up following him to the table with the couple he had just sat, which was a mistake on his part, not mine. Don't move on to your second customer until you are finished seating the first, it just causes confusion. He seemed slightly miffed when I declined sitting at the bar and requested my own table, but obliged.\\n\\nI didn't actually step foot inside the restaurant, but the patio area is quite nice. Large heat lamps hanging from the ceiling, three stand-up heaters, and two fireplaces keep it toasty and cozy; Coast is wintertime-friendly and November patio dining isn't uncomfortable in the slightest. White tablecloths (I used to do restaurant laundry, how do they keep that white so clean??), wine glasses on the table, very la-dee-da.\\n\\nMy server, while she didn't do anything in particular to really irk me, I found strange and slightly unfriendly. Something I found to be very out of place here was the lack of dress code. I worked in fine dining for two and a half years, and it was always a rule that the waitstaff wore all black clothing. Not brown, not navy, it had to be black. Not only did it identify us, but it looked much more polished and professional. It was confusing for me to see one waiter in a white shirt, one in black, one with a navy shirt and suspenders, the receptionist in a pink dress and black and white striped blazer. If this was a different sort of place, I wouldn't have even thought of it, but being the type of restaurant Coast is, I think a more uniform dress code is in order.\\n\\nMy poutine came out nice and hot. Delicious crisp fries, bacon and dungeness crab, cheese, and with a nice fried egg on top. It was very rich, and a good portion. This would be lovely to share, but definitely filling enough to double as an entree! All the components worked well together, and I finished it right to the bottom. \\n\\nFor me, the food is the most important factor, and all other things are secondary. In that sense, and although I don't think it was worth the sixteen dollar price tag, I was satisfied. While I definitely wouldn't go so far as to say I had an unpleasant dining experience, I think the front of house staff leaves something to be desired. All in all, I'm glad I decided to try it, but the likelihood of Coast seeing me back is not good."},{"name":"Whiskey's Food & Spirits","address":"885 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"2.5","text":"First time coming and had a blast with my girls. 25 cent wings with beer and BINGO?!

A couple options on the rice. 3 different choices of meat. A couple of bean based dishes. A vegetarian bar with boiled eggs, salad, tomatoes, cucumbers, etc. they also have a hot tomato dish.\\n\\nI tried all of the meats, both rice, the hot tomatoe dish, and the bread they brought to the table. Not bad, not bad at all. Darn right good. I really LOVED the steak(?) and the other meat. The chicken was not my favorite. I loaded up on the other meat but only got the chicken once. Their hot tomato dish was pretty good too. The saffron rice was delicious. But man...the meat. So good.\\n\\nThe dessert wasn't all that. Underwhelming. Grapes were good tho. Nice, fat, and juicy. Ok end to an otherwise good meal.\\n\\nWhat bothered me, however, was that I don't feel like the price reflected what I got. As of March 10, 2018, the weekend buffet was $21 and change after(or before) tax. Steep.\\n\\nAll in all, If you can spare the dimes, give it a try.

Our intended destination was unexpectedly closed for renovations, so we headed to Clay Pit.

We ended up waiting for OVER an hour, and we didn't receive our food until almost 8:00. One other note: we had several toddlers in our group, one of whom had special needs, and emphasis was placed on the need for as quick a seating as possible. Nearly three hours later, they were able to eat.\\n\\nOur evening also had the benefit of a rude bartender (her name was Ashley or Amber), a lack of planning that led to us being seated at two different tables (absolutely avoidable), and our waitress making mistakes in the billing and complaining about having to split the bill.\\n\\nWith all the hassles of this evening, one would expect the manager -- who was well aware of the length of our wait and the difficulty with the bartender -- to offer some compensation, an appetizer at least.

I'm still extremely thirsty from the saltiness of the dishes tonight. I've downed several bottles of water already and my mouth is still dry as heck!\\n\\n$8 Dan Dan noodles: I had high expectations since almost everybody praised this dish, but it tasted nothing more than leftover plain noodles and Skippy peanut butter mixed together. I couldn't really taste the noodle as the peanut butter taste was overwhelming. It was also very sour. Meh.\\n\\n$14 Tea-Smoked Pork Spare Ribs: There must've been 10,000mg of sodium worth of salt dumped on the 4 pieces of ribs, that's how bad it was. I almost couldn't taste the pork. I liked the texture and tenderness of the meat, but there was way too much sodium. If I wasn't so hungry, I probably would've stopped eating it after my first bite.\\n\\n$9 Braised pork belly buns: Two buns filled with small-portioned very fatty pork belly meat that was over-killed with too much hoisin sauce. There was way more fat than meat to the pork belly. The bao was very soft and fluffy, the almost non-existent, non-fatty meat didn't taste bad either, but again, it was over-sauced.\\n\\n$13 Asian braised soft tacos: Three multi-layered soft tacos filled with salsa, radish, and beef. Luckily, this dish was not overly salted and tasted OK, but it was nothing to rave about either. There was a very distinct taste to the beef, it tasted somewhat gamey. The taco tasted plain. Meh.\\n\\nI had a Mai Tai and it was very strong which is always a plus as there was a lot of rum, but I didn't really taste much fruit. It could've been more balanced, but I've tasted a lot worst.\\n\\nOverall, the food was simply bad and it was overpriced considering how small the portions are. It's a joke that they actually call it 'family-style', it's more like tapas to me. It was either too salty, over-sauced, or too complex (in a bad way). Chinatown is a short walk away and the food there tastes a lot better and cheaper. It's non-authentic Asian food vs authentic Asian food, but you'll get more for your dollar and your taste buds will thank you for it.\\n\\nOne star for the friendly host and the attentive waitress that provided good service and another star for the cute details like the newspaper and jasmine tea container to hold the different variety of silverware and chopsticks.

Total cost: $120.00.  I'll start by saying, our waiter was great, but he was the only pleasant thing about eating here.  We have eaten here several time before and the food portions are much, much smaller than we remember.  More importantly, the dining area is in such disrepair that it is gross.  They keep the lights very dim, so you can barely see your food.  I assume they do this to keep you from seeing just how dirty and poorly maintained the dining area has become.  I spent my dinner staring at the moldy ceiling tiles above their wine cellar (which sits in the middle of the restaurant) through a little window in the wall by our table.  This was gross and very unappetizing, but right in my line of sight so I couldn't help but see them.  The wooden divider next to our booth was stained and the varnish had worn off of it from years and years of the candle sitting there.  I took some pictures of both of these things and if I can figure out how I will post them on here.  I have also posted them to Foodspotting.  I am seriously afraid of what the kitchen must look like in this place.  I can't imagine this place passed a health inspection with mold on the ceiling tiles from what must be prolonged water damage.  Maybe Seminole County Health Department doesn't bother to look very close or doesn't bother to look outside of the kitchen.\\n\\nIt was very unappetizing to eat here thinking about how bad they let the place get.  For the price I recommend going to one of the great restaurants over in Winter Park like Ravenous Pig, Luma, Prato, or any of a dozen other great restaurants in Central Florida.

The menu (which is written on a huge blackboard that covers one wall of the restaurant) is extensive, with a long list of pizza, pasta, wraps, salads, sandwiches, and appetizers.  My niece had a sausage pizza and I had a caprese sandwich.  The pizza was very good -- nice crust, tangy sauce, and lots of sausage for eight bucks.  The caprese sandwich was outstanding -- the balsamic dressing was just right and the fresh-baked baguette was delicious.\\n\\nSeating is limited, but a table opened up shortly after we ordered at the counter.  Lots of people seem to take out and the tables turn over pretty quickly since the restaurant is mostly self service (i.e., you order at the counter, take your drinks and plates with you, and they bring your food to your table when ready).\\n\\nBottom line:  This is a fun place with large quantities of good quality food at low prices.  It's a great in-between family restaurant:  More of a restaurant experience than you'd get at a pizza joint, but more informal and lot faster than a full-service restaurant.

It didn't feel like a big, open restaurant like upstairs did. It was romantic with candles all around.\\n\\nNow on to the food! I ordered the Mirch Masala curry with lamb and since I love everything super SPICY, I got the desi hot! I normally love things to burn my face and restaurants usually don't live up to that. My dish was surprisingly very spicy! We also ordered garlic and basil naan which was very soft and came out warm. Their cocktails were very strong and also refreshing.

Sadly, I think this place is going down because from a long time customer's stand point of view, the quality of the food and the service is reaching below par. Read for so many bad reviews that they had recently. I believe in all the bad customer's review because of the fact that I was treated very poorly as well. The owner, Vince, doesn't do any good either because his defense is always going to protect his unprofessional army working at Cumin. If you come in to the restaurant, you will see the same nasty lady and nasty man working there again. To make long story short, we went for a buffet and it's not even closed yet and I requested one of the staff to have chicken legs tandoori made (because dark meat is the only thing I would eat) half hour before the restaurant close and he never made it for me; therefore, I went and asked the front lady manager and her response was \\"we are closing and we are not gonna make anymore. You have to eat whatever in the buffet bar.  Otherwise, you would have to order from the menu.\\" Wait a minute, did she say: \\"YOU HAVE TO EAT WHATEVER IN THE BUFFET BAR!\\". At that point, I lost my appetite completely. My wife and I didn't end up eating enough things due to the disappointing treatments.

The service is usually on point as well.  My only real gripe with this place is the price of the food. The last time I went, the market price for the lobster was about $35 for 1 1/2 pounds, and you have to pay an extra $14 (or was it $12?) for the lobster bake. This is a lot more than the lobster bake at Legal Seafoods. The food was just as good as Legal's...but Summer Shack was way too expensive. Next time I have a hankering for lobster, I will probably end up at Legal's just for this reason.

Your Parmer/35 location is in our new 'hood.\\n\\nYour burgers aren't the cheapest.  But several of them are pretty darn good.  My fave has always been the drippingly good teriyaki/pineapple slice one.  The fish and chips are always crispy.  There's also reasonably good salads.  Tonight's waitress Mandy was fast, attentive, and unobtrusive.  Kudos for letting the large party next to ours bring in their own birthday cake (I never understand places that don't allow that).\\n\\nSince you now carry a gluten-free (Udi's brand?) bun, for what I hate to admit is a very reasonable upcharge, many items on the menu are now available to my lovely wife when she doesn't want a \\"burger\\" just wrapped in lettuce.  At $6.99 (plus $.50 for my wife's GF bun), the \\"Red's Tavern Double Burger with unlimited steak fries\\" is a really tasty and pretty cheap (and plenty big) burger option.\\n\\nSo, an easy 4* review, no?\\n\\nTo paraphrase a movie, I hear you use the phrase \\"Unlimited Steak Fries\\" all the time in your commercials.  I do not think it means what you think it means.\\n\\nWe've developed an unhealthy (but yummy) habit of asking for fries before the entrees arrive, to nibble on while we're waiting.  Kinda like \\"unlimited  breadsticks\\" at the Italian-chain-that-shall-not-be-named.  And then we learned to ask for melted cheese on top (oh, and ranch to dip them in).   Sometimes you don't charge for the cheese, sometimes it's a buck.  We were even told by the waitress this time \\"yeah, it's like 80 cents to do that\\", Imagine our surprise when we see an order of \\"chili cheese fries\\" (uh, where was the chili?) on our bill for $7.99.  Figuring it was just a simple mistake, we gave our waitress a chance to make it right.  After a bit of discussion with the manager, she comes back charging us instead $2.99 for an extra order of fries + $1.49 for the melted cheese.\\n\\n\\"Oh, we realize you both ordered entrees that come with unlimited fries, but, since you wanted some BEFORE your entrees arrived, I had to charge you extra.

I've been there once, and maybe only once (not because I didn't like it), so what can I possibly add? \\n\\nI never went to Barley when they were doing all that awful, I mean, offal stuff; I never went before the menu became prix fixe because Odd Duck will be opening soon and that's where you'll order individual entrees now, so I can only speak to the current Barley menu/experience. \\n\\n$60 for a prix fixe menu of 12 courses which turns dinner into a 2 hour experience. And, much to our surprise and delight, if you're a vegetarian, they will accommodate with modified or different dishes. You still pay the fixed amount, but you don't get any of the pricey meat. Do lots of places do this when they have to substitute meat for veggies or fake meat? Sure. Does it suck to pay the same amount as someone eating oysters, waygu brisket, etc? A little, yeah. But if you do go, you'll get veggie food like you've not had at most places in this city, so it might still be worth it, just for the experience.\\n\\nI was terrified to eat here because I have an immensely boring palate, don't love meat, and am scared of anything that isn't chicken, beef, or pork (and only the \\"normal\\" parts of the first two, only the bacon/sausage parts of the last). While our menu included no sweetbreads, intestines, gizzards, feet, or heads, Barley did push my limits a bit. I ate oysters, some white fish, some beans that were near lamb... Okay, I know that's not so impressive, but it's a pretty big deal for me. \\n\\nMost of what we had truly was unique and delicious. They use eggs in ways I couldn't imagine (imagine frothy, fluffy,  creamy, or caramelized sauces), herbs I've never heard of, and they can beer batter and fry the shit out of a sweet potato. What a delicious dish that was. And the waygu brisket is the one course I could have made a whole entr√©e out of. I wimped out of the lamb, but did eat the beans and greens it was served with, and they were delicious, enveloped in the lamb-y sauce (I'm told the lamb was very well done, more like ham, which I could taste in the sauce). I \\"chickened\\" out of quail completely and must admit, I don't regret it. Teeny chickens freak me out! More for my dinner partners who were actually appreciative. \\n\\nThe desserts? Forget about it. This is where Barley shone for me, because I love dessert. Deconstructed pumpkin pie with all the fixins and a peanut butter mousse with smoked apple sorbet center of which I could have eaten a bucket. I pretty much did not allow my bowl-sharer to have more than a bite of that one, and I don't even feel that bad. \\n\\nThen, because the people there are so nice, and because one of our dining partners *cough*Errol*cough* is a rockstar there, we got three free scoops of sorbet and these things on spoons made of... blueberry and rooibos tea? Gushers, Billy called them, and they did in fact gush in your mouth when you bit into them. What an insanely refreshing way to end a fabulous meal experience.\\n\\nAnd my fear that Barley would be too pretentious, frou-frou, or eye roll inducingly food snobbish was completely unfounded. The staff is warm, friendly, and helpful. They're almost all in jeans and tees, as are most of the patrons. They talk about the food in a tone filled not with haughty superiority or condescension but with pride and excitement. They all seem truly stoked about the gorgeous, inventive dishes they are serving you, as if they each had a hand in preparing it.

A quaint exterior in a shopping center usually pushes me away but the pictures on yelp had me intrigued and we had time to kill so we came in with low expectations.\\n\\nThe decor is funky. And it works.  It makes you feel like you're at a friends new apartment in NYC and they had some money and time to find and make some creative art pieces that are functional and visually appealing. \\n\\nSo then we think oh this place is run by an interior designer type so food and drink probably took a back seat because we are ordering from an iPad with pictures. (All tell tale signs it'll blow) ... but it didn't!! I actually enjoyed the ease of use and I bought more because traditional items that I didn't know what they were had a picture and looked amazing!

Matcha shots, some amazing iced coffee thing, avocado waffle, Nutella waffle. All killer!\\n\\nI'll get back to the food and drink in a second. There are signs everywhere saying no laptops. So we scoffed and laughed and joked that a coffee shop wouldn't be ballsy enough... and I pointed out a person to my date that had a laptop and that it must be a joke but not 10 seconds later did someone stop by and politely inform the new gal that it wasn't a thing they allowed and she put up her laptop and had to relax and socialize. Brilliant! I'm sure it pushes some away but they want a social fun environment without the stigma of laptops filling the room and seats. Perfect.\\n\\nOk matcha shots. A must every time. The iced coffee drank a must.  Waffles aren't always my thing but that's all they have to snack here don't expect to fill up on eggs. The avocado toast needs one more item.

As a pescatarian, I'm pretty much confined to two noodle choices--seafood pho (soupy) or shrimp vermicelli (dry). I was in the mood for something soupy and full of seafood, so I went with a small seafood pho. I saw that their menu also had \\"rice noodle soup with seafood\\" as an option, but pho is pho...so I went with that choice. I wonder how different the two are.\\n\\nThe pho came out under 10 minutes, and the three of our bowls came together. I definitely could have eaten the large size of pho, but I'm a noodle lover like no other. I was disappointed that the seafood quantity was like 5% compared to the rest of the bowl. The noodles were cooked to chewy greatness, but the pho broth itself was just average. I've had some fantastic pho where I found myself slurping spoonfuls of love and satisfaction into my tummy, but pho van fell short.\\n\\nService is to the point and fast, your typical no ambiance and zero background music (cracks me up) pho spot. We had the older woman taking our orders, and she starts with the \\"separate or together\\" to get the bill stuff out of the way. I love that--reminds me of home.

Literally it is in the parking lot.\\n\\nIt's previous life as a Pho place was so much better! Now it's just OK with a so so broth and nothing amazing, I am in terrible angst because finding a good Pho place on the North Shore is next to impossible.\\n\\nWhat can I say about Pho Japolo, don't go unless having a massive Pho craving and any Pho will do. There are your standard 50 types of Pho combinations of fatty brisket, tripe, beef balls, rare beef, etc. Also your standard grilled lemon grass chicken, pork, salad rolls,        spring rolls, etc. All standard and OK. I think the grilled meats may be better than their Pho, though they are a Pho place. Something new, I noticed they were advertising Vietnamese sub sandwiches... interesting, have not tried so cannot comment. \\n\\nPho is all about the broth and their broth is bland. Good broth you finish, this starts to taste boring and stale halfway through. Rice noodles taste like whatever you put them in, ditto for raw meat. \\n\\nThis is an odd little place, as aforementioned, the chalet feel, with a Chinese Buddha as you enter, one empty fish tank (on, but empty) and another fish tank with 2 goldfish and a sign that says \\"do not poke the fish with sharp sticks or bang on the glass\\" I quickly put away my sharp stick.\\n\\nThere are 2 TV screens in the dining area irritatingly either playing soaps or sports, so if a fan of neither sit on the outskirts. This is also a not very well vented place so you do come out smelling like beef broth (based on my previous reviews you may think I have a thing for stinking like broth... but it was just fluke that I happened to stink like beef broth AND pork broth in one week).\\n\\nYou do get a good mass of bean sprouts, basil, soy, fish sauce and a collection of chili oil and hot sauce to season your broth with. I think next time I go it may be for the lemongrass chicken, hard to go wrong with lemon grass chicken. Note to the white folk, it is dark meat grilled lemon grass chicken, don't be coming looking for breast meat, head to Brandy's instead.\\n\\nI am sure I will go again when having a massive rice noodle craving and no time to cross the bridge.

The chicken was the tiniest bit dry for me, though.

I tried a bit and agreed, though it was still pretty good.  Also tried a couple of french fries.

I got the big fajitas platter with steak and shrimp. $20. Well, I had to wait. A while. About 10 to 15 minutes after they said it would be ready they finally brought me the bag. I got home and found there were no tortillas. It's kind of important to have something to eat the fajitas out of. So I called, and whatever managers I got, a man, told me he would put my name on a list and when I came back the price of what was screwed up that day would be taken off my bill. I don't work there. I don't know how these things work. So I took his word for it.\\n\\nAbout a month later my wife, and inlaws went there for dinner. \\"Hey I have a discount we can use!\\" was the deciding factor.\\n\\nWe ate. Food was fine. Check came, and I informed our server as to what happened the last time. A manager came over to us and informed us I could be lying so they weren't willing to honor my claim. WTF? She said anyone could come in making the same claim I was to get free food. But THIS time, she'd make an exception and give me $10 off the meal. So, having $20 worth of food ruined is exactly worth $10 to them and they will accuse you of lying in front of your inlaws and wife. That is such shit customer service I have no clue how this woman was allowed to manage the place. Apparently my complaint was nowhere on record for them to find. So that's now two managers not worth their weight in salt.\\n\\nSo I was all set to never go back, except that \\"you're a liar\\" meal was for my wife's birthday. And wouldn't you know it, she got a chili's gift card.\\n\\nSo, a few days ago we went with the inlaws again. It was against everyone's better judgement, but my wife loves the margarita chicken and due to medical reasons there are not a lot of places she can go to eat. Well, on this trip I ordered the chicken fingers. No way that could get fucked up. Spoiler alert, it did.\\n\\nThe plate came and almost immediately upon placing it down the server was gone and my wife found a hair. Now, of the people at my table my wife has purple hair, my mother in law has copper red hair, my father in law has short gray hair, and I have really long, flowing brunette hair. The hair on my plate was all of 6 inches long, brittle like it had been dyed 20 or thirty times, and blond. I mention this, because everyone at the table got the distinct feeling that as they were remaking my food they were eyeballing me as if it was my hair. I'm not sure what sense that would make. The chicken came out as everyone else was finishing their meals. So all it got me was the same exact food I ordered 20 minutes later than everyone else. \\n\\nIt really sucks being the only one eating. So, the manager came out to apologize. I guess that was nice. This one was certainly nicer than the one calling me a liar, or the one who lied to me about how fucked up orders are handled. She offered us a free desert, that the waitress already offered us, and we told them to hold off on it because the food I asked for was literally just placed in front of me all within 5 minutes of the two offers made. Nobody wanted desert. But, whatever. After interrupting me in the middle of my food the third time my mother in law was like \\"fuck it, bring me a brownie.\\" If the options are harass us until you think we are satisfied, or let me eat in peace when you've already created an awkward situation for me to eat in, fuck off! Seriously. I'd rather be left alone than offered a goddamn peace brownie three times before my second chicken finger is gone.\\n\\nThe waitress asked if she could clear plates before desert. We were more than happy to have that done as 9 cups piled up on our table. Apparently she was being literal. Because the cups went nowhere. Three times this woman came back and forth empty handed while nobody had room because it looked like a really tiny game of beer pong was being held at our booth. Finally mom in law asked her to take away the cups and she left with 4. Fine. The desert was brought, about three bites were taken, and we promptly got the fuck out of there as soon as we could.\\n\\nThe entire back corner of the place was filled with employees who apparently had nothing better to do than sit down and bullshit with each other. I'm not sure why it took so long to get Chicken Fingers 2, The Fryening out, but I suspect it had something to do with this. The waitress seemed new. So I hope she get's her wits about her soon as a server probably shouldn't talk shit about the food they are serving. Oh, you don't like Chili's because they put cilantro on everything? I agree but shouldn't you be chatting up the food instead of saying cilantro tastes like soap and spicy cornbread is probably terrible?\\n\\nI really hope I don't go back here, but there aren't a lot of options for us. The only bonus is every time I go here there is a completely different manager. So I suppose I can hold out hope that someday I will go there and they will have a good one."},{"name":"Orinoco","address":"22 Harvard St","city":"Brookline","stars":"4","text":"The food is so delicious, I couldn't careless if they don't take reservations here.

But after a few more visits, I have some additional insight.  Please keep in mind that this place can get VERY busy...especially on Fridays.  A friend and I went for a celebratory lunch.  The place was so packed we had to sit at the bar. NEVER sit at the bar.  Our service was LOUSY and it took forever to get our food.  Since we were \\"out of the way\\"  the wait staff just pretty much ignored us...even our own waiter most of the time.  When we received our food, my dish came with shiro.  I hate shiro.  When I told the waiter that it wasn't what I wanted and could I just have salad instead he said no problem.  Ok it does not take that long to make salad.  I ate slow so that I would be able to eat the salad along with my food, but the salad didn't arrive until after I had already completed my meal.  It was a large salad at least, but it had so much dressing on it that I didn't even want to eat it.  Perhaps this waiter was just terrible, because I have never had such bad service at Desta.  We were there for about 2 hours.  \\n\\n*I recommend that if you go to Desta for lunch and see that it is super busy, just walk over the Ledet.  The food there is also good and it is never too crowded.\\n\\nTo share another recent experience, my family and I had a hard time using a restaurant.com gift  certificate here.  The certificate states that you can not apply alcoholic beverages to the amount needed.  Totally fine with that.  But the waitress proceeded to tell me that no beverages at all could be counted (including soda) so we didn't meet the needed amount.  I read to her what certificate said word-for-word trying to get her to understand.   She kept calling me \\"sweetie\\" and saying that she understood.  Obviously, she didn't.

I mean, it's not bad food, but it's just not that special....if anything a place like this makes me want to make MY OWN tacos and such, it makes me want to learn how to make carne asada, as what they do is pretty run of the mill, but with a special twist here and there (thus making them, yes of course, better than say, Taco Cabana).\\n\\nI really like the Pollo Asado. And while I will never be able to make Barbacoa quickly and easily in my own home, I enjoy their variety. But that's the thing --- the only thing separating me from making one at home is the Barbacoa --- the tortillas, the white rice, the veggies, their icky brown salsa that I don't care for --- maybe I'm a food snob but I can get such standard fair quickly and easily at HEB or whip it up myself. See what I mean? What keeps people coming back time and time again is the low prices (which I do adore) and the novelty of being able to order, say, \\"Yucatan style pork\\" at 2PM from a hipster girl and get it served within minutes. But my point: people are primarily paying for the quick'n'flashy marinated meats and such (some of which aren't consistently solid). And the idea of El Chilito being awesome. Nothing else is that special. Their beer and fresh Mexican sodas --- whatever. This place has a really nice thing going, but for me, it's good but just not special. I can make breakfast tacos at home. I can make tacos at home. Specially marinated meat served in minutes alone isn't enough to get me to ever walk a block to this place more than once a month (twice if I'm ever drunk and starving).\\n\\nAnd I hate how they always give you corn tortillas automatically!!!

No more Googling about weird words, and you get to learn some Ethiopian! The place is quite small and comfy, only fits 50 people to my estimate. No wonder there's a line sometimes even in a workday night.\\n\\nThis is my first time for Ethiopian food, so I played it safe by ordering Tibs with ribeyes and injera, which is a customized entree.

I got the beef hand-pulled noodles with thick spaghetti, garlic pickled cucumber, and spicy shredded potato. \\n\\nThe beef noodles were great. The broth was tasty and I added all the chili oil they gave me to the soup. It will give your soup a nice, oily sheen, so if you don't like that, don't add so much.

The beef was cooked well and was also very tasty due to soaking in the broth. I would definitely order this again. \\n\\nThe garlic pickled cucumber was amazing. I love cucumbers and garlic and I l-o-v-e the two mixed together and Xian does a great job. I would eat this every day, if I could. The spicy shredded potato was the only thing I didn't particularly like. The potato lacked flavor and, even though I poured some of my broth into the bowl... they were still sort of bland. I could definitely taste the spice on the outside of the potato, but the potato didn't absorb any of the flavors.

My sister ordered the catch of the day which was salmon and served to her raw but i enjoyed my prawn pasta. We both ordered a cocktail and unfortunately I dont remember the name but they were awful. We only had sips of our drinks and when the waitress came to pick up our plates she asked my sister if she wanted a box to go and my sister said no (she didnt mention why). The waitress did kindly come back and said she showed the chef the salmon and because it was raw they would remove it from the bill which was very nice and surprising. However when we were walking out one of the waitresses stopped us and said \\"ladies what do you think you are doing\\" As if she thought we were dining and dashing. Im not sure if it was because we barely touched our food and drinks or because of our age either way her tone was a bit insulting. Truthfully we were leaving so quickly because we were so unhappy we wanted to just be gone to go out somewhere else which we did.

I eat out a lot, like almost every kind of food, don't usually have textural issues of any kind and honestly, I can't remember a time when I couldn't wait for the experience to be over. I should have known by the reaction of the waiter at the bar when I said I would try all of the small bites during the happy hour.  His response was \\"are you sure you want to do that?\\"  He could barely look me in the eye. So, I  chose to start with the 2nd and 3rd items on the menu-battered kale and ricotta cauliflower dumplings which I summarize as....batter and dough, awfull!  The floury, uncooked dumplings were sitting on this foamy, tasteless, slimy white sauce that is nasty. Of note, I've experienced this sauce before and felt the same way.  That time they used it under short ribs which absolutely ruined the taste and texture in my opinion.  Back to this experience, because I was so unsatiated, I chose the brussel sprouts and pork loin off the regular menu.  The brussel sprouts were cooked perfectly and nicely seasoned but the pork loin was thinner than proscuitto with a quarter inch of meat and inch of uncooked slimy pork fat.  At 9$ I could have cooked those delicious brussel sprouts myself at home for pennies without the uncooked pork fat! Finally, I decided surely they can't ruin a dessert. Ah but I was wrong.  On the bottom of the bowl was chopped almonds and plasticky, waxy carrob chips with a scoop of coffee gelato topped off with a small pitcher of espresso. The result was a soupy, watery mess with plastic waxy chips at the bottom of the bowl.  It reminded me of the waxy lips and coke shaped bottles we use to by at the candy store. I will say my two glasses of grenacha were delicious.  With regard to the wait staff, the waiters delivering the food were great however, the waiters at the bar taking orders were not so great. One was less than pleasant and I felt I had to go out of my way to engage her even a little and the other waiter, in addition to not being able to look me in the eye ( at least he was honest...sort of) essentially flat out ignored me until it was time to pay the bill.  In summary, nice atmosphere, good wine, tastey brussel sprouts and that's it.  After 4 tries of which one was a great experience and three were poor to awful I have to say I'm out. Good luck.

The exterior of the chicken was very lightly coated, and once the sauce was applied, the chicken immediately got soggy. \\n\\n2.) There were large chunks of green pepper in with the chicken, as well as large chunks of onions. My assumption is, they were sauteed in the General sauce, then dumped over the chicken. The flavor of the green pepper and the onion COMPLETELY changes the flavor profile of the dish. It is no longer General Tso's chicken, but some bastardized second cousin to General Tso -- maybe General Qin, or something. \\n\\n3.) The sauce was not good. This piggy-backs off of my previous comment, but in addition to the overly green-peppery and onion flavor was the complete lack (as in, non-existent) spiciness that is a staple in General Tso. Also, the sauce was completely unbalanced between salty, sweet, savory, spicy, and umami. It was all umami, salty, and savory. No sweetness or spiciness at all.\\n\\nThe egg roll: It was overcooked. The rule of thumb when frying things is 'golden-brown'. This was 'very dark brown'. Additionally, the interior had a lot of black pepper in it. It wasn't like any egg roll I have had before, and I thought it was just OK.\\n\\nFood: 2 / 5\\n\\nService: Not good. I showed-up and placed my order at 7:40PM on the dot (I checked the receipt). I did not receive my food until 8:11PM, after being told 15 minutes. If I quoted somebody 15 minutes, and made them wait for an additional 15, I would have offered that person a glass of water, a Sprite, tea, a discount, anything to acknowledge that you did not deliver on your promise. Lastly, the guy who served me and took my order did not seem like he wanted to be there. Have some pride in your company and attempt to make people feel welcome.\\n\\nService: 1 / 5\\n\\nAtmosphere: Like some other reviewers, I found the restaurant to be a little bit dirty. I also felt it to be a little bit dingy. I was not fond of the overall 'feel' to the restaurant, and I did not necessarily feel welcome. I would never return.\\n\\nAtmosphere: 1 / 5\\n\\nPrice: This place gets the most significant demerit that I can give for a particular category -- a zero. For 10.95, I got unacceptable General Tso's chicken and white rice. Not fried rice and no egg roll. I had to purchase the egg roll separately. So for $13-ish dollars, I got one of the worst 'General Tso Chicken' dishes I have ever eaten, and had to pay extra to get things that should just come with the meal. I have never had to add an egg roll or fried rice to my take-out order -- it just came with it. If everything had tasted sooooo good that it warranted the price, then that is one thing -- but that was definitely not the case.\\n\\nPrice: 0 / 5\\n\\nFinal Thoughts: Maybe what I ate at China Cooks is the standard for food in the area? I hope not, because that would be sad for such a large number of people in Atlanta! It is also possible that this restaurant just has a bad General Tso chicken? I don't know, and I try to be as objective as possible. Either way, I cannot recommend this place to anyone."},{"name":"Napoli Italian Pizzeria","address":"3928 S Semoran Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"Good for delivery, if you're into 90 minute wait times and absolutely no apology from restaurant or delivery person."},{"name":"FLIP burger boutique","address":"1587 Howell Mill Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"We were shopping in the area and decided to grab aN Ole BURGER.

The girl behind the counter told it'd been around since 2007, but I guess I just never noticed it for the little time that I lived in the area. I'd say that's definitely for the better because had I known it was in walking distance, I probably would have been gorging on baked goods weekly.\\n\\nThe shop itself is pretty tiny, and the selection isn't huge, but everything looked delicious. I ended up grabbing a snickerdoodle cookie, a lemon cupcake, and one of their new treats which was a walnut chocolate chip cookie sandwich with a cream in the middle. They also offered one with chocolate cream surrounded by cherry chocolate chip cookies. I'd say the pricing was fairly reasonable if not a little expensive, but I've come to accept that with bakeries around here.\\n\\nOf the three desserts we grabbed, my favorite was definitely the cookie sandwich. I could eat that thing all day. The cream wasn't overly sweet, and the cookies were delicious. I also really liked the lemon cupcake, however, it is super lemony, but that's fine with me. The snickerdoodle was just okay. My girlfriend thought it was a bit too hard (almost stale-ish), and I'd somewhat agree, but the flavor was still pretty good.\\n\\nThis is definitely a great bakery, and they had a lot more items I wanted to try like a peanut butter and chocolate cake which I had only noticed after I had finished paying (Thank God).

My friend was in the mood for comfort food and ordered the lobster mac n cheese.  You'd need a magnifying glass to find the lobster -- it was basically a cheesy sauce with lots of garlic and disintegrating macaroni (not cheap either).  The best part of lunch was dessert -- we shared a mixed berry shortcake.  The berries (including blueberries, raspberries) were fresh, the shortcake was crisp on the outside and tasty and the kitchen granted out request for softserve instead of whipped cream -- almost good enough to wash away the bad taste of the entrees!  Not surprisingly, the place was about 10% full -- the word is out re lunch.

My two favorite features are (1) Location and (2) topping-to-base ratio.\\n\\nFirst, location. I live just a few blocks from here, so obvy it's convenient for me (and I don't have to mess with parking). Even if you don't live in the area, though, you can benefit from the proximity to Schiller Park. Stop in for your picnicking needs. \\n\\nSecond, topping-to-base ratio: whatever your order (salad, sandwich), the amount of innards/toppings you get is perfect. Not too much bread, not too much filling. Not too much lettuce, not too much topping. Know what I mean? Few places can get this magicalness right.\\n\\nI think of Brown Bag for more than just whatever's on the chalkboard menu. There's a rotating selection of really thoughtful and flavorful bulk sides in the glass case. Flatbreads, quiches, chicken salad, pasta salad, etc. It'd be perfect to pick up on your way to a dinner party or potluck in the park.\\n\\nThe only downside to Brown Bag is that the staff can easily get overwhelmed. I've been in at peak times, and the cashier situation is just not streamlined to handle a lot of people. Ordering can be awkward and time-consuming. Also, I wish they had more soup selections. Oh, and the long tables in the dining room are not a great use of space.

It comes with 4 big prawns and a side of kale and quinoa.  I love both kale and quinoa, but it is a little bitter so if you aren't into that I would ask them to replace with something else.  We also ordered the Lavaraki ($30) which is the Greek Sea Bass.  This is a very delicate white fish and incredibly good.  It does come with the head and tail on the plate, though it has been fileted.  We ended our dinner with the Pistachio ice cream and baklava, this was easily the best baklava I have ever had so I definitely recommend it!  All of our food was good and something I would order again.\\n\\nThe service was pretty miserable though and I must comment on that.  Our waitress had a 20 person table next to ours and couldn't care less about our table of 2.  This bothers me so much!!  I understand she is making a lot more money at that table, but then please just give our table to someone else who cares!  I'll be back anyway, but I'll make sure we have our waiter's attention!"},{"name":"bartaco","address":"969 Marietta St NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I've been to bartaco many times, some for dinner and many for their amazing cocktails.

Perfect occasion.\\n\\nI showed up around 4.30pm and I was pretty choked at the lack of selection. There was no chocolate torte and very little else that really stood out to me. But since I had to wait a good 10min before being acknowledged (there were 2 people ordering coffee and 3 people tending to them...maybe it was the backpack) I eventually made my choice of lemon tart (AMAZING!), chocolate succe (meh) and tiramisu (no). \\n\\nAs you can tell, lemon tart was amazing. Best by far in my book. The succe was really just there. It was fine. But the tiramisu was not worth the cash. The cream to cake ratio was WAY off and left me yearning for more soaked cakey goodness. \\n\\nWhat kinda bothered me the most though was when I asked why there were so few treats to opt from (and only 3 macaroons...all of the fluorescent variety) I was told \\"that's just how it is\\".

Granted, Smokehouse 21 lacks the full bar and the ambiance, but Smokehouse 21 BBQ completely dominates.   At Smokehouse, they would NEVER serve the BBQ pre-sauced!   The BBQ at Southland was over-sauced, cold, dry, bland and with a predominate flavor of salt.   Totally unsatisfying.   The ribs are smoked very heavily with what I believe was mesquite smoke - so the ribs tasted like a peaty scotch.   Anyhow, I'd go back for the ambiance and the bourbon selection, but I would not order the BBQ again.   Dry, cold brisket.  Over smoked ribs.  Dry, cold pulled pork.  Over salted.  Over sauced.   Cornbread was more like dry, overcooked cornbread cake.   Smokehouse 21 cornbread is absolutely heavenly and cooked to perfection (seriously amazing).

We arrived on this late Saturday afternoon with the establishment about a quarter full. Our first hint that the restaurant was not up to its usual cleanliness is when we entered the restaurant and the floor was as slick as ice with what felt like a coating of grease on its surface. This was not only the case in one isolated spot but a problem through out the restaurant. As we were entering, an escorted group of special needs adults were exiting the restaurant. Apparently we sat at a booth adjacent to where these individuals had eaten and understandably the floor in the area was strewn with food, crumbs, and napkins. We had to hear a young female employee complain to her co-worker in a profanity laced tirade her dissatisfaction with cleaning up the mess that was left behind by these individuals. \\nAlso at a table toward the front of the restaurant was a group of young adult males that were loud and boisterous and used frequent profanity.  They appeared to know some staff as evidenced by their interactions with certain employees. At no time were they told to quiet down.

Room is lovely and we were happy to finally try this place.\\nWhat went wrong?\\n\\n1) I ordered the salmon but wanted to substitute one potato dish for another. The waiter took the order with no issues only to come back and say the kitchen refused to do this. Um - what? We are talking mashed potatoes right? Not exactly a strain since it is on their menu but that's the way they do it so I changed my entire order.\\n\\n2) My frisee salad arrived - looked perfect - fat sliced lardons, runny egg - my favorite salad. Unfortunately to my taste (it's all personal I know) the dressing was literally white vinegar. \\n\\nI broke up the egg, tried two bites, confirmed it was inedible and pushed the entire thing to the edge of the bar with my cutlery piled on top - isn't that the international symbol for \\"this is terrible? At no point while my friend ate her salad (which did look great) did our server ever do a quality check or inquire why I had left a huge uneaten dish on the bar. He was directly in front of us and passed back and forth at least 4 times. Poor.\\n\\nOnce my friend had finished he came by to collect the plates and asked if I had liked the salad. I was polite but said no actually it was way too sour for me. His reply? \\"Yes - I had it once and it was very vinegar\\". No apology, no offer to bring something else, he just left with the plates. We all got a laugh actually since that attitude is fairly common in some of our favorite spots in Paris so we joked that the place is authentic right down to the arrogance and kept on having a great night.\\n\\nTo their credit the mains were delicious - the sausage with fig and (hooray) mashed potatoes was lovely and we all had the desserts which were served simply but were very tasty.\\n\\n3) We were happily full when the bill arrived. My vinegar monster salad was still there and I laughed and told the server that I did not want to pay for this as I had a) complained and b) not eaten it. He muttered and walked away.\\n\\nA minute later the manager came up and inquired about the fact that I would \\"not pay for the salad\\". I said no it was the principle because I had complained and returned it virtually uneaten. His response is almost too insane. He gestured to the waiter who was now also hovering and said \\"he says you ate half\\".\\n\\nNow correct me here but is this man accusing me of eating just enough of this salad to get a refund? Is that a new scam going around? We had all had full meals with drinks and dessert. It's a $10 salad - you're joking right? He was not kidding and after a surreal back and forth where they accused me of \\"eating the egg\\" and I called out the waiter and asked him if he had in fact even paid attention to the fact that I had complained and left the whole thing uneaten I was fed up and insisted they charge me because the whole issue was insane and now my friends and I were uncomfortable and shocked.\\n\\nThe evening had gone from light and enjoyable to an interrogation about half an egg. It was dreadful and rude. I was completely flustered and surprised and being in the business it was so insulting to see people being treated like this.\\n\\nThen the manager (if you're reading this you desperately need to find a new job that involves no dealings with actual people sir), returns, announces that he has (reluctantly) removed the offending salad from the bill and proceeds to hand me a glass of dessert wine (seriously?) while lecturing me that \\"next time I should really let them re-make the salad for me etc etc\\".\\n\\nI could only stare. If I had moved that glass of wine would have gone in his face. Perhaps if the server had ever bothered to check in on us or offered a new salad I would have accepted.\\n\\nAs for a next time, there is about as much chance of that happening as there is of me topping my next frisee salad to straight vinegar.\\n\\nWe will never be back and I'm sure that is just how both the restaurant and I want it.\\n\\nThe worst."},{"name":"Maria's Taqueria","address":"226 Tremont St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"By far my favorite burrito place in Massachusetts.

The server confirmed that we can combine the points therefore we figured to take the advantage of classic ramen as being a royal customer. However, the service who's acting as a manager refused to honoured the system and started with raised voice going back and forth with my girlfriend. The promo honours free gyoza after 5th order and free ramen after 10th order. The free ramen was claimed but not gyoza. It appears to us that it is weird why we can still get free gyoza based on the 5 stamps after received free ramen but we cannot use that 5 stamps and combine with other stamps towards free ramen? \\n\\nIt clearly was a miscommunication and the manager could simply explain the rules nicely or just honour the promotion due to the promise was given from another staff.

The evening hadn't started off really well, since our plans to go somewhere in downtown Chamblee ended up not working out and I was peeved by the wasted time.\\n\\nLuckily, The Cowfish saved the evening. We arrived to a pretty busy restaurant but we informed of the first come, first served policy at the bar. Considering that we'd spent a lot of time driving to Chamblee, only to get stuck in traffic and finding out the restaurant we'd wanted to dine at was full to the brim, we quickly scanned the bar and grabbed two seats at the end (near the door). Perfect--we evaded the 45-minute wait that people who wanted a table would have to endure.\\n\\nOur bartender quickly came over and service was fun throughout our experience. It wasn't super fast, but I'm giving slack here, since the bar had lots of patrons, just as the rest of the restaurant did.\\n\\nAnyway, AT got a porter beer (I don't remember which one) and I just asked for a glass of water with lemon. We took some time to study the menu and were quite tempted by a number of items but I knew what I wanted from the moment I suggested the place to AT, the All-American Bacon Double Cheeseburgooshi. You see, I don't eat seafood, so the more traditional sushi had no appeal for me. The Honey, Brie Mine burger called out to AT and he ordered it with a side of bacon coleslaw. He couldn't help but order two pieces of mackarel nigiri. AT's nigiri came out pretty quickly and he immediately dived in and gushed about how great the quality was. He commented that while purists may complain about the ample portion of fish, he highly enjoyed the taste and serving size. Our entr√©es came out within 10 minutes of the nigiri's appearance. I dug in and wow!! The burger roll was fantastic and I quickly picked up a piece to share with AT. He loved it as well. The fries were perfectly crispy. AT bit into his burger and raved about his perfectly cooked medium rare burger with brie cheese, blackberries, thyme-infused honey, and sake-infused Asian pear. His small criticism was that the pear had too strong a taste of sake. He enjoyed the crisp coleslaw with bacon pieces.\\n\\nWhile the restaurant was busy, we were pleasantly surprised that we could talk at normal tones to each other. We didn't delay much once we finished our meal and our bartender quickly took care of getting us our check and processing payment.\\n\\nI recently returned for an Elite event and it confirmed my idea of coming back with AT.

This one was pretty good, but I had a hard time eating the flank steak because the pieces were too big and the meat wasn't tender enough to tear apart with your teeth. The mushrooms were marinated in a soy marinade that was really delicious. There are no veggies in this sandwich, so it's pretty hearty and filling\\n-Parish chicken sandwich (11.95)- It was ok to try, but I wouldn't go for it again.

The lighting was dim and the tables were some kind of formica. My friend said he'd only been there twice and had not liked what he had ordered so he was particular about ordering his rice bowl dish. I ordered hot and sour soup and the kale-persimmon salad, thinking I might experience a korean salad dressing I could try at home. \\n\\nThe soup was okay and quite sour. The cubes of tofu were good in it but the rest of it wasn't special. The kale salad came in a bowl, the kale cooked and cold in the dish with razor thin slices of persimmon (about 4-5 I would guess.) It was also vinegary and I ate only a few bites. I decided to spring for the coconut cream pie because I had hardly eaten anything. It came as a small round pastry with some coconut cream with whipped cream on top. \\n\\nMaybe I didn't order the right thing--although it shouldn't be due to what you order--but it might not be a bad idea for Joanne Chang to visit her restaurants more often to see how well-kept up they are inside (messy and dingy looking); the help (our waitress was slightly sullen and defensive although we tipped her well; and the quality of the food. \\n\\nHonestly, the fried shrimp chips (thick, white and shrimpy-tasting) were the best thing I tasted at this highly-touted restaurant.

Everything else about their admittedly small space seems well thought out but, at barely 9 AM on a Saturday, the bathroom needed tending to and it was apparent the fine staff also use the same restroom as there was flour all over the rug in front of the sink. Yes, they were busy with a well deserved line out the door, but they also needed to take a moment to clean the bathroom up a bit. They also have a junky looking curtain hiding the hot water heater and some cleaning supplies in the bathroom and I fail to believe they can't come up with a better solution than that. \\n\\nStill, the quality of their product cannot be questioned.

Lots of shiny white plastic and curved lines for windows and doors, etc.  The inside is the more common blend of nordic furniture, industrial unfinished background elements and high tech electronics.  Behind the bar flat screens are silently showing off Palladia in HD for no apparent reason.  It's disturbingly hip, to me -- especially for a burger place.\\n\\nBut, about the food.  It's a burger place, so the first way to evaluate it is  the fries.  These are very good, but just short of great.  They are helped a lot by the sauces -- a smoke-infused mayo and a house made ketchup with a range of different uncommon flavor additions.  Richard's desire to experiment being limited to the sauces, not the medium seems like a really good balance for him.  I'm much less bothered by a failed experiment if it's a condiment, and thus, entirely severable.  I also got the tempura asparagus.  It was just what you would expect from the name, cooked very well.  The other area of great whimsy and Blaise personality seems to be the LiNitro shakes.  We got the more mundane peach and creamsicle flavors for our shakes, but there are more \\"interesting\\" choices like the waitress-recommended Krispy Kreme where they blend vanilla shake and (one would assume stale) doughnuts, nutella and charred marshmallow, and foie gras (which was tempting, but too costly for a first visit)\\n\\nFor the burgers, actually, despite not even considering the non-beef half of the menu, nothing I had was really a burger.  I got the rBQ, which was pulled pork and BBQ sauce formed into a patty and seared together with common BBQ accompaniments (inc. house-made pickles.)  It was really quite good.  Then I pressed my luck and got the burger of the day - a \\"cuban\\" which I didn't really enjoy, but that might be because I have a lot of standards about cubans the way people who grew up in areas with a distinct cultural heritage food item do.  My friend got the southern burger (A pan fried burger patty with pimento cheese, and what looked like a green tomato pur√©e.), and that looked good.  The menu is still a little disjointed (most burgers are ~7 bucks, except for the kobe/waygu which is 17/35) but the place seems to be doing a big business (and even drawing midtowners across the broken bridge nightmare for lunch.  Weekends seem to packed to handle, but for a lateish visit mid-week it seemed like a good level (especially if you were willing to sit at the chef's bar and watch them make the food  which we were.)\\n\\nIn all, I'd say this is Blaise's most solid place so far.

The food is set up cafeteria style and they write your order on the paper on your tray. I thought it was is a bit odd that the desserts are displayed first at the counter.

It was a bit too crunch and oily. So, not great. I ended up dismantling the sandwich and eating the good parts. Also the hot fried tomatoes cooked the lettuce which was just gross. \\n\\nThe rest of the family enjoyed their chicken. The tenders are roughly half a chicken breast in size, so two is a pretty good portion. We had plenty of left-overs to take home. My husband complained that the food could have been a bit warmer.\\n\\nAnd a side-note about sides. My daughter and I both ordered hush puppies as sides. She received six and my meal came with three.

Parking is a bit hard because there are little to no lights in the parking lot so rely on your GPS! \\nThe restaurant is small and just about every inch of usable space is taken up. We found out later that the restaurant is actually 2 story, but we were seated and squished into a small corner. At every table there is a bottle of hand sanitizer, which is recommended since Ethopian food is usually eaten with your hands. The menu is extensive, and there are descriptions but I had to keep flipping the menu over to find out what each sauce was. It would have been easier to navigate the menu if the common spices/sauces were listed in alphabetical order. \\n\\nWe decided on the meat and veggie plate, with the meat consisting of lamb, fish and chicken with an order of the lentil sambusa, I thought these would be more like the triangle shaped ones, but they look like eggrolls and were so tasty. They definitely set my palate on the right path!\\n\\nThe vegetable and meat platter was served on one huge rectangle plate. It literally took up the entire table and was more than enough food for 2 people. I think 3-4 people could eat this. The lamb was cooked so well and was yet tender without any gaminess. Along with the meal, you are given a plate of rolled up spongey bread called injera. Tear off pieces and use that to grab some sauce and meat, but be careful because they will fill you up quickly. \\nif you are new to Ethopian food, I would recommend doing a platter opposed to ordering a plate since you will get more variety and figure out what you like, even though some caught my eye. \\n\\nThe atmosphere was pretty good in that it was pretty dim and noisy, but you could still have your own private conversation. \\nWe had plenty of left overs, and I managed to bring them back to SO who chowed down it.

It's bitter, and rather disconnected from the rest of the big puff (which is not very easy to eat). Even when I lick it together with the banana cream (the good part)... The coffee whip just doesn't blend in. Doesn't complement the taste very much. I'm sure if it was sweetened it would be freaking good.\\n\\nChocolate marquise: The chocolate mousse is very dense and too sweet for my liking. Especially when the caramel at the bottom is sweet enough. The crust was hard and the caramel was so sticky (not that it's a bad thing), I couldn't fork through it. Even with a knife I had to hold it down and use more force than I'd like. Why am I struggling to eat something I should be enjoying? Anyway, if the heavy mousse layer was halved, I'd be more likely to eat it again. The hazelnut caramel portion is very good I must say.

Quite a bit, actually, and I grew up eating some of the foods that are traditional for people that grew up in German settled areas of the U.S.\\n\\nThat being said, my love for beer and -wurst is offset for my hatred of cabbage, specifically, sauerkraut.  In the past, I have been outside Schmidt's Sausage Haus with the intention of eating there, only to change my mind and get some chocolates from their chocolate store around the corner, and go away in defeat.  The smell of the sauerkraut is just too strong sometimes.\\n\\nHowever, I was recently in the area and decided to give it a go for lunch.  Fortunately, the smell wasn't as overpowering as I had remembered, and since they had a buffet, I didn't have to worry about any sauerkraut accidentally touching my plate.  I had several different sausages, which were all delicious.  I also liked the stew they had, as well as the potato salad and the bread.  Overall, it was a great, hearty meal.\\n\\nTheir beer selection is ok, and has some standard German things.  I know hefewiezen is Belgian, but they had the Paulaner variety of it so I had that.  Deduct a point though, for putting a lemon wedge on top rather than an orange wedge.\\n\\nWith the buffet comes a discount on dessert.  We got apple strudel a la mode and a cream puff.  Both were great.\\n\\nThe service here was great, and the workers are honest.  As in, if you leave an expensive smart phone on the table by accident and drive away, they'll give it back to you when you go back.  The decor looks kind of like what people in the 1970's must have thought German restaurants would look like.  Having never been to Germany, it may be accurate, I don't know.\\n\\nAnother interesting thing is that they have a small deli counter where you can get desserts and sausages to go.  They also appear to sell some of those items online as well, although I'll wait a while before I try that out until temperatures are not in the 100s where I live.\\n\\nI can't say that Schmidt's is the most authentic German restaurant in the country, or the highest quality.  I really have no idea, because I've never gone into one.  The food was really good, although carb-laden and a heavy meal.  It's a great place to eat on occasions when you want tasty, hearty food and don't care about calories, fat, or carbs.

I'm not sure if it was the weight loss or if fame got the best of him, but I was pretty disappointed with Flip.  The menu looks great - Chorizo, BBQ, Seafood, Lamb, Chickpea - you have plenty of options.  The toppings are creative as well.  Dining with a group of food lovers, we decided to try and get the best bang for our buck.  We ordered 3 different burgers and split them.  My personal selection was the Southern Burger - chicken fried beef patty with pimento cheese.  Yeah, that's what I was thinking - that sounds good.  The first problem is that the burgers are pretty small and not only are the burgers small, but the burger patties are small as well.  It is almost as if they were trying to highlight the toppings over the meat itself.  So with my burger, it was essentially an overcooked small chicken fried steak topped with pimento cheese (the pimento cheese was tasty I must admit).  The other burgers I tried was the Barnyard and the Chorizo.  I'll start with the Barnyard and this goes back to my original point - if you are going to put pork belly, fried egg and green tomato ketchup on a burger, than you better have a substantial patty!  Also, their \\"farm lettuce\\" was more like shredded iceberg.  My favorite of the bunch was the Chorizo.  The Chorizo patty was the for sure star of the burger and the egg and hashbrowns complimented it well.  A very \\"breakfast like\\" burger - that I would order again.\\n\\nFor sides, we opted for the fried pickles and fries.  The fried pickles seemed far too thick and greasy.  The fries were good and the smoked mayo was delicious.\\n\\nFinally in the evening of decadence, N2 milkshakes!  Ok, I know I have been a bit of a downer in this review, but I really enjoyed the shakes.  I went with the Krispy Kreme - we can't even get the doughnuts out in Houston!  I really enjoyed this shake - tasted exactly like a glazed KK in milk shake form.\\n\\n In summary, I was not that impressed with Richard Blais' Flip.

Everything is made to order, they use natural, fresh, and non-hormone infested ingredients.

It wasn't seasoned as well like the sauces. It was missing that ump! The Terlingua burger was the same ways. The fries were just alright. I do wish that added more queso and more meet on that food. It wasn't amazing but it wasn't bad. Something in there food is missing an extra ump and I can't put my fingers on it. \\n\\nOur drinks were delicious and they have a good selection on beer but I do have to agree with the others...it is a bit overprice.

He wasn't rude or unpleasant, he just wasn't anything. He had no real emotion to him at all. He didn't show that he didn't want to be there, but he also didn't show he wanted to be there. He clearly didn't care about his job. \\n   I forget what beer I got, they didn't have any reds or ambers so I picked whatever wasn't an ipa. Its kind of weak that your brewery doesn't have a decent beer selection. Whatever I got(the waiter reccomended it,) was actually pretty good. It was the only part of my Burnside Brewery experience that I actually enjoyed.\\n  To go along with my beer I got the burger, since there was no real food selection and the burger is always a good stand by. I asked for medium we'll and what I got was a pink mess that couldn't even be considered rare. It was uncooked plan and simple.

My first bite of just pasta with arugula pesto was overwhelmed by fish & pesto flavors. For the remainder of the meal I added a piece of tiger prawn, chanterelle mushroom, peppers, & sauce & it was better. If these ingredients weren't in the pasta the dish would've been wasted. Would I order this pasta again? No. Why? Two words. Steak Diane.\\nThe Ma√Ætre 'D also prepared the sauce for the steak table side with another story. I don't even remember the story because just the looks & smells of this entree were too good to listen or think about anything else. The steak medallions were bathed in delicious cream sauce & mushrooms.

Coast has apparently moved to a new location since it was last reviewed on Yelp - and despite it's new location it appears to have no growing pains whatsoever (althought the owner was actively running around the establishment supervising operations).   \\n\\nUpon our arrival, we were explicit that we were looking for the best BC had to offer, and our server put us in touch with Mik the manager who was familiar with BC wines.  Much to my surprise, the manager took us on a sommelier tour of the BC wine region and paired our entire meal with tastings of wine - all of which were thoughtful and complimented our BC oysters and main courses.  As a wine snob myself, I can't reiterate enough at the knowledge the staff had - I was wowwed.  \\n\\nOn our manifest consisted of a set of fresh BC oysters (Fanny Bay, Chefs Creek, and Effington) - all of which were fresh and flavorful.  Main entrees consisted of local/sustainable halibut and sablefish, the latter being the better of the two.  The simple grill preparation with asparagus and lobster potatoes let the fish shine in its simplicity and depth of flavor.  We finished our palette with the banana coconut cake with fortified rieslings - absolutely delicious.\\n\\nOverall - we left incredibly satisfied, but if I was to pinpoint the on thing that highlighted the evening, it would be the service.

They do what you want, well, exceptionally.\\n\\nMagnetically lured by a Yelp tap special of Oatmeal Pale, excellent btw & recomendo, I was on a mission.\\n\\nCincinnati chili.\\n\\nCincinnati chili is down home grub. It's cheap and democratic in its home town in Ohio. It's the most unusual of chilis, flavored with cinnamon. \\n\\nGreek, maybe Macedonian, immigrants came to Cincinnati and created the dish eons ago. In Cincinnati, Camp Washington Chili, Skyline Chili and others have satisfied customers from every walk of life, in diner-like parlors, for breakfast to after bar closing noshing, at bargain prices.\\n\\nCincinnati chili is made of probably the cheapest ground meat, reduced to meat fibers, and is heavy on cumin and cinnamon, cloves and allspice, even chocolate. It's served in bowls: \\"one way\\" to \\"five way\\", depending on what you add, like red beans, raw chopped onions, spaghetti, and cheddar. But another choice is the chili-dog on a bun.\\n\\nBurnside throws down a serious chili-dog, though they have their own creative take on Cincinnati chili. \\n\\nNow we are not talking nutritional correctness, when we are talking a hot dog on a white bun with chili and cheese! But with all respect to the FLOTUS, taste awesomeness in moderation is a good substitute for nutritional correctness. Just sayin'.\\n\\nThe dish starts with a nice take on the bun. It's not a common bun, but it's toasty, and reminds of a common bun, while not being a fine Italian or French-style bread. The sausage is meaty, juicy and very ham-like, with a substantial casing. Very tasty. The chili is different than Cincinnati chili and different than most you have tasted. It's a smoky red chili, a little tomato-y, vinegar-y, with some mustard, good quality meat, and a touch of cinnamon. The grated cheddar cheese is sharp, not extra sharp, or medium-mild, as is the custom with Cincinnati chili. Solid changeup. Cincinnati-inspired. The dish is accompanied by a dill spear and some artisan pickle. Good for Burnside taking inspiration from a micro-regional specialty!\\n\\nI also had the cohiba. You must have this dish! Let's just say that if a former president had been eating these, rather than pork rinds, he would not have been distracted in the least by a former intern from Lewis and Clark. Not in the least.\\n\\nThe cohiba is a duck confit springroll, with a collard over wrap, served with a sweet-salt and molecular gastronomy-inspired duck fat ground hazelnut dipping powder that might as well be crack. So Burnside Brewing could have saved the country, even the world, if they had been in DC, in the 90's, serving el presidente, and not in LoBu, serving you and me, today. It's that good.\\n\\nBurnside Brewing is an example of a Portland hybrid business that does food and brewing at the highest level of quality, and creativity; extreme tastiness, anyone and everyone can feel comfy here, solid spot for Portland visitors, excellent service and great presentation.

You have fewer flavors to choose from, which you would think means the flavors are truly outstanding, but they honestly either clashed more than complemented each other (e.g., raspberry rosemary); cheated one in favor of another (i.e., blueberry bourbon); or took one flavor too far (e.g., peanut butter and [spicy] jelly), so I wouldn't recommend this place, if you're looking for simply good-tasting donuts.

The staff was super friendly. They have outdoor dining on warm nights. \\n\\nWe ordered the Dumplings, deep fried, a must try. They were scrumptious and had just the right amount of crunch. I tried the Christmas Roll and Philly Roll both were delicious. The Wonton Soup was good but had more of a miso broth than stock broth. Even though I didn't try the Sesame Chicken or Lo Mein, others in my party got those items and both looked absolutely delectable. \\n\\nI am excited to go back and try their other dishes. Their drink options sounded yummy as well, and will be trying those in the near future. On the downside, they do not offer a kids menu. We ended up ordering the Shrimp Lo Mein and splitting the bowl for the children."},{"name":"Hopdoddy Burger Bar","address":"1400 S Congress Ave, Ste A190","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"This was our first time at a Hopdoddys, so this review will be a primer for the noobies like us.  We didn't know what to expect, and going straight towards the kitchen at the back of this particular location to find a counter right in front of the kitchen to order our food was interesting in a good, that was fun and different, sort of way. They have a sign right in front where you walk in and look for a hostess or the preverbal seat yourself sign. You will not find a hostess or a seat yourself sign. Just a sign that says line up and head to the kitchen, place your order at the counter, and find your tagged table. Just go stand in line towards the kitchen because there will be people to guide you.  \\n\\nWhile standing in line, a nice lady just walked up and asked us if we had any questions about the menu, that could have been because we looked confused or it could have been because that's what they do. Then, while still in line, another lady, or maybe the same, walked up shortly after and asked how many were in our party and wrote down a series of seating numbers they would need later after ordering. Once we got to the kitchen counter with a cash register, it was time to order.  While ordering, we were able to validate parking for this particular location, and add money to a tip jar that had a clever sign suggesting the need to tip. I'm not sure who gets the tip, but whatever. Once we were done ordering, it was time to sit down. We walked to the front of the restraunt and found an empty table with a correlating number we were previously given in line.  \\n\\nAfter a few minutes, a gentlemen walked up and said he would be taking care of us tonight, and he brought us whatever sauces, all of which were fun and very good, that we wanted, and made sure we always had water. Two of the kids wanted more food and rather than wait in line again, the gentlemen took our additional order which worked nice because it was my chance to tip him with my credit card.  Now to the food review. \\n\\nShakes were just all right and expensive.  Could use both more caramel and Oreos with the actual ice cream, but the kids loved the big straw.  Odd ordering system makes for difficult tipping unless you know ahead of time and have cash on hand to split tips.  \\n\\nThey have a kids grilled cheese on the DL (two slices of cheese on a backwards bun).  No other kid options, so we deconstructed a classic $7! burger to bun, meat, cheese, bun for our kids.  It was 8 oz, but still.  Also ordered the kale salad. Could have been bigger for $9.25, but filled me up enough and was a good combo of ingredients with kale, pickled red onions, feta, sunflower seeds and watermelon. Very light and fresh finished with a pomegranate vinaigrette.  We also ordered the Parmesan truffle aioli fries (basically the same as the regular fries with extra Parmesan and a truffle aioli sauce).  The sauce was fab, and the fries were fresh.  \\n\\nWe enjoyed the unique spicy honey mustard, chipotle ketchup, sassy sauce, truffle aioli, etc. We also ordered the primetime which was a yummy mix of ingredients and plenty big to share with our salad.  We got in with a little wait because by the time we left, around 6:30-7pm, the line was out the door and around the corner.  A bit pricey overall. Worth a try once in awhile though."},{"name":"La Merce Restaurant & Market","address":"155 E Morse Blvd","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4","text":"After reading the favorable restaurant review in the Orlando Sentinel, we wanted to check it out.

The bun to my burger was so soggy it was unable to support the burger and my meal began falling apart before I was even able to take a bite. I ended up throwing out the soggy bun and the sauce covered pile of lettuce it contained.

The interior is great and the wait staff is good too, but the food is just okay. \\n\\nI've been to Fuji many times, and my favorite appetizers are the Beef Tataki ($8.50) and the Hokkai Yaki ($7.00). i actually like the appetizers more than the sushi or entrees.\\n\\nin terms of sushi, I've tried the salmon, tuna, unagi, yellowtail, and several of the tempura makis. Nothing really stands out, but the yellowtail that I tried once didn't taste fresh and had a suspicious texture. But the prices are very reasonable, so play around to see which kind works for you. \\n\\nThe teriyaki entrees are nothing special, but there's nothing really wrong with them either. However, I did try my friend's seafood stir-fried udon, and it was almost inedible. The seafood tasted frozen and had a very fishy taste, while the dish itself was very bland. I think bland is a good word to describe the entrees at Fuji. \\n\\nDuring my last experience, we got complimentary ice cream from the owner, so we tried the fried green tea and fried red bean ice cream. I love the novelty of fried ice cream and I love green tea ice cream, so I decided to mix the two. Turns out, they were never meant to be. The greasy and heavy goodness of the batter just shattered the delicate and refreshing green tea taste. Next time, I'm just going with the regular vanilla fried ice cream or just green tea ice cream. \\n\\nThere's affordable parking (maybe $1 or $2 an hour) in the lot behind the restaurant; the lot is free on weekends. A meal for two can range anywhere from $25-$50, depending on what you get."},{"name":"The Melting Pot","address":"1200 Commerce Park Dr","city":"Longwood","stars":"4","text":"I always enjoy Melting Pot. I know some people scoff because you're paying a good deal of money to (basically) cook your own food, but I always say that you're truly paying for the experience and ambiance. I always enjoy coming here with my boyfriend and spending a couple of hours having a long romantic dinner. Half the time you're in one of those corner booths anyway, so you can cuddle. Hold hands over the search-and-rescue spoon. Whatever floats your boat. The menu changes twice a year (I believe it's October and March), featuring a new cheese, salad, main course, and dessert that is only served during that time period. There are some staples, and when you order the Big Night Out you can always mix up the staples with the new stuff, or not even order much of the new stuff. It's up to you. The only thing you're stuck with on the Big Night Out is whatever main course meats and fish they are serving. Check the menu online before you go to see what's up!\\n\\nWe have some favorites whenever we go to any Melting Pot:\\n\\n1. Fiesta cheese fondue= This is more of a Mexican cheese, although it's a cheddar and Emmentaler swiss blend. They start with a beer base and add the cheese, along with chopped jalepenos (you can choose mild, medium, or spicy and they will put the appropriate amount in) and tomatoes. It's served with the usual cubes of three breads, a chopped green apple, and veggies, but the Fiesta cheese also comes with tortilla chips (the circular ones) for added fun! \\n\\n2. I LOVE LOVE LOVE the California salad. Mixed greens with chopped tomatoes, gorgonzola cheese, walnuts, and raspberry vinaigrette. It's delicious. Just phenomenal. My boyfriend always orders the Caesar, but I am faithful to my California salad. I've tried other special featured salads here, but none compare!\\n\\n3. Our favorite chocolate fondues are the Original, and S'mores. We generally alternate between the two. \\n\\nTips from experienced Melting Pot Diners:\\n\\n1. Feel free to ask for extra dippers at dessert or during the cheese fondue course. Also feel free to substitute for the main entree. For example, if you and your guest don't enjoy pork, you can ask for extra chicken or shrimp instead. We do this all the time and it works out well!\\n\\n2. Ask for graham crackers to dip with during dessert! \\n\\n3. Sign up for Club Fondue online and you'll receive great coupons on your birthday and anniversary for a free dessert with Big Night Out purchase! Saves you $16, and I believe when you sign up they send you a coupon as well. :)\\n\\n4. Feel free to come in and just have cheese and salad, or cheese and chocolate! Not fabulous for your diet, I know, but you get some of the experience and you spend less money."},{"name":"Schmidt's Sausage Haus","address":"240 E Kossuth St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Where do I start!\\nHighly recommend this place for German Food.\\nStarted with pretzel bites served with beer cheese.

I showed up for dinner on a Monday, and the place was surprisingly full - apparently quite a few residents of Cambridge are more sure of the cuisine than I was.  For my experience, though, there were enough drawbacks to have me leave without feeling quite so enthusiastic, and by no means a convert.\\n\\nWe found the service to be very matter-of-fact: can-i-take-your-order, here-is-the-food-you-ordered,  yes-i-know-you-want-my-opinion-but-i'm-only-going-to-tell-you-that-everything-on-the-menu-is-good kind of service.  Friendly enough, but not exactly helpful.\\n\\nThe food was a mixed bag - again, my expectations were very unclear - and reminded me of all sorts of other cuisines without being distinctive in itself (with one exception which I will detail later):\\n\\n- Our salad of tomatoes, red onions, cucumber, and I think green apples was delicious - sort of like a kicked-up fattoush.  \\n- Our appetizer sampler was, um, fried.  Big chunks of starch, battered and fried.  Seriously, one of the dishes was a big ball of mashed potatoes that someone battered and deep fried.  \\n- My meat entree - shredded beef with a spicy sauce - was solid.  I'm still trying to figure out if there was anything unique to it, but I was pretty satisfied.\\n- Dessert was simple and effective - mangoes and yogurt.  Nice.\\n\\nAt the end of the meal, I decided to try to the one immediately unique thing on the menu - the Poecha, or special Tibetan tea.  I was expecting maybe something like a Chai, sweet with a little spice.  What I got was a bland cup of tea with a thick layer of melted butter on the top.  Now I'm a guy who loves his butter, and in good quantities, but in tea, especially bland tea, it rendered it undrinkable.  You've been warned.\\n\\nI enjoyed my meal at Rangzen, if only for the opportunity it afforded me to try a new regional cuisine.  It sounds like the Lunch Buffet is the way to go - our dinner was not exactly cheap - so I'll be coming back to try that at some point.  That said, don't get your expectations too high, and beware the Poecha."},{"name":"Veracruz All Natural","address":"2505 Webberville Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"These tacos were change your life kind of tacos.

The area in which the restaurant was located didn't seem to match the hype (i.e. Richard Blais, top chef, best burger, etc.)  Approaching the restaurant however, my viewpoint changed. Very trendy and the d√©cor was on point. (see: picture frames around flat screen TV's at the bar) The flipped booths and tables on the floor and ceiling was an added touch. The hostess was friendly and tried hard to update us on our status of when we will be sitting next. Oh I guess I should mention they don't take reservations... first time I went was with 12 people, waited three hours. Needless to say, we found the bar and I we passed the time with our friends Jack, Jose, and their dog..  Blue moon... I digress. \\n\\nWe got seated and read over the menu, which had an array of different style of burgers... this is where the \\"gourmet\\" part of the equation comes into play. Scrolling through I noticed the many different styles of burgers; I realized then that this place was far from my typical two buns and a patty norm. Having spent some time in Texas, a state known for many things, including their chili, I immediately ordered it as my appetizer.  Best chili I ever had.. Done next question!\\n\\nFollowing the chili, I ordered the butchers cut burger. No joke, hella good! Perfectly cooked and seasoned. Yes it was a little smaller than I was expecting.. Hence \\"boutique\\", but the chili and the fries made up for it. \\n\\nLong story short.. Great food, great atmosphere, and reasonably priced."},{"name":"Terry Black's Barbecue","address":"1003 Barton Springs Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Hands down the best brisket I have ever had.

There is gourmet raw/vegan restaurants and there are places like Tassili's. This place is full of love and soul and the people who run this place are great. I could not help but talk to one of the fellas here who said he comes here because he cannot prepare his own food (he's probably in his mid-70's or 80's).

Even though they were clearly super busy Owen was super helpful, had great recommendations, and was upbeat and personable!\\n\\nThe FOOD!!! Oh my goodness... mind-blowing-good.

The option to order small or large portions makes it possible to try a wide variety of things, and the menu idea is excellent because it takes out any possible mis-communication as you are essentially taking your own order. The food is priced very well. The man with the glasses, who I believe was the owner, is very kind, explanatory, and accommodating to any questions you might have. Between two people, we shared: ken's bread with fruity olive oil, radishes with butter, braised greens, sauteed mushrooms , a potato pancake with leek paste, halibut with a green mustard sauce, and a lamb chop in pickled leek sauce, all in the small portion. This was the perfect amount of food for the two of us and the bill was shockingly reasonable including our drinks.

Su is for Suzhou, a culturally rich city west of Shanghai.  In addition its beautiful gardens, Suzhou's cuisine - aka known as Jiangsu cuisine - is one of the key ones in China.  Hang is for Hangzhou, the site of G20 Summit held in 2016. Hangzhou was one of China's ancient capitals, and the city itself dates as far back as the Qin Dynasty.  It is therefore also known for its long history, including some of the best dishes ever invented.  It is also popular for its Long Jing tea. \\n\\nMy culinary experience here tonight is pretty well in line with the rest of the reviews here.  Service was great - speedy enough, and attentive but not bothering.  Food was also great.  Like many others, you can't help but compare with other Shanghainese establishments, especially the more renowned ones in Richmond. \\n\\nOverall, we all quite enjoyed the food.  We found it quite palatable, with sauces not too heavy.  Translation:  we can taste the food, be it meat, fish, or vegetables. They have paced the dishes well too, with the rice coming last (so that we don't fill ourselves up before all the side dishes arrive).  \\n\\nWe tried the \\"sour vegetable fish\\", white meat fish in soup with preserved vegetables.  It was very good and appetizing, although the biased me will always prefer the ones I had in China's Yunnan province. \\n\\nIf I must, the difference is probably the price for value received.  The prices are indeed up there, as reported by other reviewers here.  Note, for example, that XLB is about the same as other main ones, but it only has six pieces, whereas \\"the other place\\" has eight. \\n\\nWe do, however, appreciate the fact that it's not too busy, and we didn't have to wait for our reserved table like \\"the other place\\".

Boy oh boy...it was one of the best donuts I've had in my life.\\n\\nCame here on Mother's Day around 10 am. There were still lots of donut options available!\\n\\nAfter talking with the cashier, we settled on two* donuts:\\n1) Raspberry rosemary buttermilk ($3.75) // \\n+1 My second favorite donut from Blue Star- too good!! \\n+1 The texture was perfect, even Allen liked it! (He's an OG type of guy)\\n+1 The flavors were amazing- you can really taste both flavors from the glaze!\\n\\n2) Passionfruit cocoa nib ($3.25) // \\n+1 WOAH! So fresh, the glaze didn't even get to settle before we took a bite.\\n+1 Love the passionfruit and the punch of cayenne! Makes it a bit spicy.\\n\\n3) *Blueberry bourbon basil ($3.50) //\\n+1 Not sure if I tasted all 3 flavors, but I love how deep the blueberry flavor is! Doesn't taste artificial at all.\\n\\n*+100 Cashier was so nice he threw in an extra one for us to try! He overheard us saying we wanted to take photos, so he threw in a classic donut for us to try. **TEARS OF JOY** Unfortunately my photos didn't turn out so well BUT IT TASTED GREAT.\\n\\nAllen and I came here twice- one more time on our last day right before we called our Lyft to the airport. SO WORTH IT.\\n\\nPricey, but you'll love it! Allen and I fell in love with their cake/buttermilk donuts more so than their original fluff donuts (the texture was not risen enough), but definitely get one of each to try!"},{"name":"FLIP burger boutique","address":"1587 Howell Mill Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"****3.5*******\\n\\nI had the burger with American cheese and it was good, but not amazing. My friends and I shared the zucchini fries and the french fries. Again, they were good, but nothing I couldn't find anywhere else. I still think Vortex is best burger place in Atlanta! \\n\\nI did, however, love the decoration in this place. It's so cute!\\n\\nThe Krispy Kreme milkshake was also good, so if you go make sure you try a milkshake!"},{"name":"Blue Star Donuts","address":"1155 SW Morrison St, Ste 102","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"What I consumed: The maple bacon doughnut and the pb&j doughnut with a cup of coffee.\\n\\nFood Quality: The doughnuts are good. Not the best I've ever had but definitely better than average.\\n\\nEnvironment: Its a doughnut shop with an industrial feel.\\n\\nService: The service is ok. What is it with Portland and only 1 checkout line?\\n\\nOverall: I would definitely come back. The doughnuts are good but quirky and the quality is good. The line moves slowly and they sell out of doughnuts quickly. Also, they only have regular and decaf and its self serve! I really wanted a hot mocha."},{"name":"The Megabite","address":"10411 NE Fourth Plain Blvd","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Walk in and up to the counter, order your food and pick a place to sit.

I had been dying to try this place for weeks after hearing rave reviews from co-workers and let me tell you I was not disappointed. Firstly, 7:30PM is apparently a great time to come because the line took ten minutes and our food was at our lovely outdoor table before we finished pouring our waters! My friend got the Ahi Tuna and I got the El Diablo. Both burgers were served on perfect, delicious buns and the combination of the sauces and toppings made for incredible flavors that live up to the hype. The fries were excellent, too, along with the wide selection of self-serve condiments. We also tried the Salty Caramel shake which was DIVINE. All this for only $30; totally, totally worth it. There are so many amazing looking burgers and shakes on the menu, I will DEFINITELY be returning on a regular basis, especially since I live across the street. \\n\\nFor my money, burger joints don't get better than this. Well done, Hopdoddy."},{"name":"Ginger Indian Cuisine","address":"9100 Blundell Road, Suite 490","city":"Richmond","stars":"3.5","text":"last sunday's dinner with family and friends proved to be a phenomenal one. \\n\\na friend told me about this new indian restaurant in my hood and we decided to give it a shot. \\n\\nturns out, one of the best indian places that i have been. the place had good ambiance and vibe, not to mention excellent food. it can easily rival tasty in delta and give them a run for their money. \\n\\nfor price, food quality and service! truly 5 stars!\\n\\nwe ordered lamb kebabs( served on a sizzling plate) , classic butter chicken, lamb tikka masala, chicken tandoori, paneer , basmati rice, and of course garlic naan! \\n\\nlamb kebabs were awesome! perfectly seasoned and charred served hot on a sizzling plate. no weird smell, instead very aromatic with cilantro and other spices as well as juicy and tender.  the butter chicken was superb! one of the best ive ever tasted! big chunks of chicken simmered in authentic and think chicken butter chicken sauce. sauce was heavy but not too much. the combination of spices was just right. lamb massala was likewise superior. lamb was fork tender and sauce was aromatic and bursting with flavour. the paneer was good too. provided a good balance to the thick sauces from the other dish. the paneer ( cheese ) tasted fresh and the spinach was creamy and smooth, giving the dish a perfect balance. and the chicken tandoori was served on a sizzling plate too. huge chunks of chicken, so juicy and moist, it was an entree by itself. and laslty, the garlic naan was without a doubt, the best dish of the night! \\n\\nit was simply pure heaven with every bite. the bread reminded me of the pizza crust in naples italy. thin, crispy and a bit chewy, basted with real garlic butter. total delight and satisfaction. i used it to soaked up the sauces and meat, as well as the rice . freshly made as ordered! simply amazing! \\n\\nservice was also excellent. the staff were friendly and efficient, functioning like a perfect brigade. not a single thing was overlooked. they took orders, made recommendations, and made sure the water bottle was also stocked with cold refreshing water. all of this was done with smiles all around, it made us feel all so welcomed! \\n\\nhighly recommended! possibly the best indian restaurant in richmond! you will leave 100% satisfied and happy! prices are very reasonable. they've got lunch and dinner combos for one which will blow you away. \\n\\nim already planning on visiting again! this place will become one of my go to's for sure! i will come back again and again! \\n\\nhappy eating!"},{"name":"Terry Black's Barbecue","address":"1003 Barton Springs Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Yum.

The pizza was excellent. The service was horrible. They don't offer fruit (I asked for a lemon for my ice water) my response was they do not have fruit. I ordered my son a chocolate milk, they don't have that either. I asked for BUTTER to go with my bread, they told me they do not have any butter. Who sells wine but doesn't carry fruit in a resturaunt? How do resturaunts operate without any butter in the house. Beats me. They need more friendly servers.
