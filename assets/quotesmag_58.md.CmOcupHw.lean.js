I felt like I had gone home to spend time with my Greek Yaya and Pappous, whose first language is Greek.  There is nothing fancy about Santorini caf√©, it is the basic Greek comfort foods: moussaka, pasticcio, saganaki (flaming fried cheese), and gyros.  My only wish is that they served the Gyros here like they do in non tourist Athens, with the   (french fries) on the inside.  The frappes are amazing, and they even serve up some good Greek wine by the glass.  You go to the counter to order, take a number back to your table, and wait for your yummy food to be delivered.  The (arni) lamb plate, is simply the shaved lamb they use in the Gyros, so is a bit on the oily/salty side, definitely tastes better in the Gyro.  They have a lovely patio outside that is pet friendly, and a spacious homey interior.  The Saganaki was one of the best that I have had in the US, just missing a squeeze of lemon juice.  I definitely want to come back to try the staples - moussaka and pasticcio.  The lemon rice chicken soup was good, just a bit on the cold side (but maybe it is served Austin style for the hot days).

Proceed with caution. My girlfriend (caucasian) and I (minority) went here for the first time for dinner. Just happened to yelp some taverns in the neighborhood and thought to check it out. Well let me tell you, it was a NIGHT FROM HELL!!! Where do I begin. So we arrived around 7:45ish where we were never greated appropriately by the waitress! There were two older women who were waitressing and seemed to be uninterested in catering to us. Instead,  one of them just gave us a dirty look from afar thru a bar mirror which is in the waiting area who ended up being our actual waitress. \\n\\nWhen we got sat, she never introduced herself and went right into asking  \\"are you ladies ready to order\\"? Service was decent,  although not for nothing I'm use to going to places where the waitress or waiter checks in atleast once to see how things are going at the table after the food arrives. Well I assure you, we were never asked and as many times she passed the table it seemed she would've rather we just eat, pay and skedaddle. So after our meal, she then took our plates without ever asking us if we wanted dessert or anything else. Then proceeded to ask if we were ready for the bill. I was applauded. At that point, I just wanted to pay and get the hell up out of there and forget the whole night. Being a waitress myself, I was in total disgust given  the type of service we received in addition to how they conduct business.  \\n\\nSo the bill arrives, and for 2 meals, 3 glasses of wine and 2 soda waters later. Our bill totalled to $82. Yes, you heard me. Not to mention we were being charged for \\"seltzer water\\" aka Soda water $2.90 each w/free refills. I've eaten in many restaurants in the past from five stars to 2 stars where Pellingrino or Pierre bottled water would typically come with a cost, rightfully so.. As to my surprise, most places DO NOT CONSIDER it a fountain drink.esp when there is no \\"syrup\\" mix such as one would use for sodas. When I asked to speak to a manager,  she came back with a gentleman who had on flip flops, jogging pants and a polo flipped collar shirt. I thought she was kidding.  I even asked him if he was in fact the manager because of his appearance. Sadly, he was! \\n\\nI explained to him it was our first visit there had heard great reviews about the food and thought to come check it out. However,  I was disappointed to discover \\"soda water\\" wasn't free. So I asked if it would it be possible to have it  taken off our bill because we weren't aware there was a charge and we barley drunk them due to our wines. Well let me tell you, not only did he seem annoyed at my request he hands down not only refused but continued to say well \\"it's on the menu\\".  In fact what the menu states is all \\"fountain drinks came with free refills\\" but soda water was not indicated as one.  He continued on saying \\"sorry but the water is a fountain drink, so what do you want me to do\\"! I was shocked that he was not only reluctant to take off a total of $5.90 on a $82 bill but he seemed upset that I had the audacity to ask for it to be taken off our bill. Then once I responded to what happened to \\"making sure to take care of the customer and making sure it's a pleasant experience policy \\" his response was \\"so now you want me to comp the whole bill\\"! \\n\\nI assured him  I was more than capable of paying my bill and did not want to make a scene.  Although,  I did not appreciate how he was handling the matter nor did I appreciate his tone of voice. The next words that came out of his mouth I swear to  you, was \\"I expected you to be the one to say something about your bill\\"! If that wasn't pure racism or discrimination, I don't know what would have warranted such comment. At that point, my girlfriend saw my face and insisted on picking up the tab due to pure embarrassment.  I was so angry, I told him I would NEVER COME BACK THERE and be sure to let everyone know what type of establishment they were running.

We were seated in 5 minutes and the waitress was quick to assist us.  We ordered the Guac and chips to start and they were delicious. It was one of the best guacamoles I've ever had and the chips were fresh and warm. They have a nice special where you can get 3 tacos and 2 sides for $16.  This combo did not disappoint although it was quite filling I had to take most home. I recommend the pork belly tacos- the meat melts in your mouth.

On one side of the restaurant where the bar is, there are only high-top tables and on the other side are all low-top.

However, I was with a party of 11 people on a Friday night where the reservation was made the night before - so I understand that we may not have gotten the best seating option.\\n\\nThe food I got to try was the quail, the paella barlata, and ceviche. My favorite was definitely the ceviche! I was very satisfied with the mixture of shrimp, octopus and scallops in a nicely made citrus/tomato based sauce. Ceviche as a starter is always a great option and I would recommend getting this if you go to Barlata. The quail came with a fresh garlic sauce and the quail actually came out a bit dry. I ordered the smaller size of paella barlata which consisted of saffron rice, shrimp, clams, and chicken chorizo, some vegetables. The seafood taste was prominent which some people may find enjoyable - for me personally, I thought it was okay. \\n\\nI shared these three dishes with one other person and I was still a bit hungry.

Their XLB were nothing short of DTF, and their shrimp and pork dumplings, fish dumplings, and mushroom dumplings were all excellent.

We got sat and started searching the menu. A lot of their menu items are fairly regular but their description is complicated, making you second guess exactly what it is. We got chips and salsa and it turns out it was nacho style with this extremely spicy salsa. I love spice but this stuff was overwhelming and absolutely overpowered your taste buds. I had to drink a ton of water and wish we could have controlled the spice by dipping chips into salsa instead of not being able to avoid it.\\n\\nFor our mains we got the goat tacos, zucchini quesadilla, and the mushroom something? I say it like that because I absolutely could not figure out how it was a mushroom. It looked like a big fried cauliflower with calamari like branches with a slight taste of mushroom.

My friend liked his goat tacos as it was styled like barbacoa and the tortillas were amazing.\\n\\nAt the end of the day, these \\"tapas\\" are super expensive and to get a good sized meal you have to spend a bit much, by Austin standards.

(you know what i mean if you see the image of all teh elements separated on the plate and you kinda pick and stack things)\\n\\n-my favorite is the pork belly. first off, this dish LOOKS super sexy. a confident spread of pistachio butter across the bottom, topped with caramalized fatty pork belly and served with a cherry reduction sauce. GOD ON A PLATE.\\n\\n-porterhouse pork chop was impressive. it comes on a block of wood with a tomato, watermelon salad. refreshing and surprisingly delicious with the heavy meat. the porkchop was super juicy!\\n\\n-it's true. the truffle fries that came with the sirloin was to die for and really addicting. even better, though was the sirloin. probably the most flavorful sirloin i've ever had. usually i like it keep it simple, with butter and some salt but this had a rub that really permeated the meat. \\n\\n-they ran out of the what we really wanted to try for dessert. so we had the upsidedown pineapple chocolate cake with rasberry sorbet, which was really good too, but honestly, i've had better dessert. this didn't knock my socks off but it satisfied my need for something sweet in the end.\\n\\n-but wait! they redeemed themselves with the complimentary peanut butter truffles.

We had a wide assortment and they were all good, nothing stood out as great however. I split a duck quesadilla and same thing, good, but just not satisfying.  I would say my best taco was the pork carnitas. \\n\\nWe also tried a couple of rice bowls. Those include some veggie strips and a protein topping of your choice.

It was actually very delicious, I could have eaten two! (I ordered the cheeseburger only).  On the delivery menu, I didn't see any options for French fries so I ordered what was called \\"funnel fries\\".  They weren't French fries, but they were delicious!  They lived up to their name, sweet goodness covered in sugar with chocolate dipping sauce.

Reservations on weekends are encouraged.   The place was quite busy for the dinner hour on a Saturday evening which also translated into pretty noisy inside.     Plenty of private parking available.   Ambience is still classy, clean and contemporary.   Service was prompt, but cannot say anybody ever really introduced themselves.   Halfway between dinner our server changed ... no mention of being handed off to somebody else.  A hostess did stop by our table at one point and had a little friendly chat.   My water glass set empty for a good portion of my dinner.  Nobody stopped by to ask if I wanted a refill on my glass of wine or to even offer dessert.  \\n\\nI ordered the \\"55\\" salad which is one of my favorites.   Tonight it was disappointing.  Same great \\"55\\" salad dressing, but the salad topped the dressing rather than having salad on the salad.  The lettuce and greens have been around a while in the kitchen as it was beginning to turn brown.   So, it was not the freshest salad I have had.  \\n\\nFor my entree, I choose the 14 ounce prime rib on the night's specialty menu.   It came with a baked potato and steamed vegetables (i.e. broccoli, cauliflower & sliced zucchini).  The baked potato was about the size of a baseball.    Steamed vegetables had no seasoning, but pretty good.    As for the prime rib, there was a fair amount of fat to it and a bit tough to cut.  In other words, I have had much better prime rib.

You might want to visit at slightly earlier or later times (than lunch or typical dinner) to avoid any difficulties in parking.\\n\\nIf you haven't tired Colombian food yet you're definitely missing out. As with other Latino cuisines, Colombian has some familiar elements and other components that you'll find unusual - it's this latter that makes the cuisine unique and enticing. Along with the typical beef, chicken and pork, you'll also see fish (and in particular whole fried talapia) on the menu. My favorite Colombian dish, and it's the one platter I always order when going to a Colombian restaurant as a bit of a litmus test, is the Bandeja Paisa. \\n\\nThey offer both the big platter and a \\"Mini\\" version for those who think it's too much food, and year at La Casona the big platter is indeed big. If you order this and you're still hungry at the end then you might consider seeing your doctor - it's massive! It includes grilled steak (a bit like pounded carne asada), pork skin (chicharron), fried egg, sweet plantains (maduros), avocado, an arepa (Columbian style so it's more like a corn cake) all piled on rice and beans. The large platter also comes with a big hunk of sausage (like chorizo) and a bit larger portions. This was all delicious and I'd recommend at least the mini to anyone who wants to try Colombian for the first time.\\n\\nOn this occasion we ordered the Bandeja Paisa, a Mini Bandeja Paisa, A flattened arepa with chicken and avocado and mango smoothies (this last is very similar to a mango lassi). All were quite delicious.\\n\\nI've also on occasion had the empanadas (they're thicker skinned than other Latino style I've had), the Sweet corn soup, the whole fried fish, and the shrimp soup (fantastic!).\\n\\nIn all you'll leave quite stuffed and satisfied. There's a subtlety to the spices that provide a richness without heat (they do provide some heat if that's your thing as hot sauce) that makes Colombian food different. They also like to use some smokey flavors in their cooking that I like quite a bit. Try this if you haven't - you'll like it!\\n\\n(also posted to my food blog)"},{"name":"Wendy's","address":"8585 Lyra Drive","city":"Columbus","stars":"2","text":"The 1st time I ate at this Wendy's was in 1996 when I first moved to Columbus and for those of you who are either new to the area or who aren't familiar with what Polaris Parkway looked like in 1996 -- here's some background.

Fast forward five years and I had to ask where this place was as we decided, we too, wanted to try the best fish we might ever have. \\n\\nWe found parking out front on the sidewalk, at a meter, yes, I said sidewalk you silly American. We were like WTF is this, are we sure? Sure we're sure everyone else is up on the sidewalk and gee we got lucky we are actually getting to park our free upgraded rental Mercedes right in front of Canada's oldest Adult Toy stores. You betcha. \\n\\nSo, we now understand we may be in the Adult entertainment zone, yay us. We go to the bar and snag the last two seats at the end in the back. This place is the typical narrow, overly dark, super SUPER load bars. OMG, I suddenly felt like I was 400 million years old. These whippersnappers were making me think of the commercial where the lady asks, \\"does that have to be so loud?\\" For the love of God people why does drinking make you deaf and have to yell? \\n\\nWe are getting the stare down from the 20 somethings, like you 40 somethings might be up past your bedtime at 8pm. I am starting to agree. Then I spot it, right behind my husband at the one of two booths I was coveting, was a man looking to be pushing 80 and two women pushing 60 but dressed like 20 somethings. That is fine, no worries, I am watching them pull out their cheaters to read the menu and their cell phones for light. \\n\\nThe menu online is not updated to reflect their current menu, we made the mistake of looking online so we would be prepared, but they quit making several items, so don't do it and get excited about something, the way my husband did. He was not going the fish route. \\n\\nOur waitress was on it, mostly. There was a crowd of 20 somethings packed into the very last booth and the ones that didn't fit were practically sitting on my husbands lap, it was insane. I am not sure even at 20, pre heavy metal concerts, I could have heard my friends in that bar. It was so loud. Did i Mention loud? \\n\\nI had zero hopes this was the RIGHT place my son sent me too, now I am furiously texting my son back in the States asking, \\"are you sure?\\" He says, \\"sure I am sure\\" and sent me a picture of him in the booth I desperately wanted from that old dude because I was pretty sure the high back of it would sure drown out the 20 something drunk drone. Sure i am sure it would have. \\n\\nI still questioned the photographic evidence, we held the phone up to make sure. In five years some things had changed but not enough to discredit said son. Then my husband points out at the time of his marriage he too was a 20 something probably loud, as well.  How could this place produce anything but pub food smashed down by the volume of their patrons? \\n\\nWell, they manage and it was shockingly good. i know that sounds insulting, but really I am glad after 30 years of marriage I can carry on a conversation with my husband through a series of head nods, eye rolls, gentle leg nudges and slight head tilts with eyebrow raises placed strategically  and we don't have to hear each other to convey the message of, oh crap we are now the 40 somethings in a herd of 20 somethings,  that I am not sure we can even say our \\"those silly millennials\\" jokes. These are really young people. Which we notice they keep eyeing us down, I start giving them the nod to them, like yep it could be YOUR parents here, so be thankful they stayed home in bed. \\n\\nAnyway, the fish was good but very thin, my son said that isn't the fish of five years ago. I wouldn't order it again, but it was good. The slaw was decent, my husband didn't like the bite I gave him. He had some kind of a irish meat dish that consisted of beef chunks and gravy, basically beef stew. He liked it well enough. Our wings were really good. We were drinking soda water with lime, which if that's all we were doing, I would understand the slower return of the waitress. I know she was busy, but refills would have been great. \\n\\nThis isn't typical bar food, it shows up on nice heavy white plates, and it is presented well, not a plastic basket with checkered paper here. \\n\\nIt is worth a stop in for sure and especially, if you are all about the pub crawl.

This is very much a college hangout and feels like a campus eatery with its bright yellow and black-painted walls (Tech's colors are technically white and gold) and giant GT with Buzz (mascot) school logo emblazoned across the center of the wall.\\n\\nMost of Wingnuts' customers are Tech students and residents of Westside apartment complexes nearby.  I'm not sure what was here before, but the restaurant has an odd, bizarre layout.  It's unusually spacious and there are several different, unused \\"sections\\" inside, which leads me to believe it was at some point, a fleshed-out restaurant or bar.  There's a lot of empty, dead space now.  Sparse decor consists of sports banners and movie posters.\\n\\nCall-in and online orders are popular.  Lots of folks drop by and pick up orders already waiting for them.  Wingnuts also delivers.  There's a $10 minimum for delivery orders with a $1.50 delivery fee.  Their web site says estimated delivery time is 90 minutes, which seems a little long to me.\\n\\nThe food is OK at best, service is good, but the restaurant is often dirty.  It's like the owners and staff don't care.  I do like the dining area.  It's casual and roomy with lots of tables and booths.  There's free Wi-Fi, lots of magazines, and two TVs, usually playing sports.  However, the tables and seats aren't cleaned regularly.  The dining area often times resembles a messy school dining hall.  I can only surmise the staff has grown tired of cleaning up after college kids, but really, that's no excuse.\\n\\nWingnuts is good if you're ordering a bunch of wings and soda for a party.  They offer boneless and regular wings.  They charge by the pound for boneless wings, starting at $5.95 for a 1/2 pound.  Regular wings start at $7.95 for 10 pieces and $64.95 for 100 pieces.  These are reasonable prices.  Various combos are available where you can combine and order different quantities of wings, fries, and drinks.\\n\\nThe wings aren't bad.  They should suffice for most people looking for a quick wing fix.  There are about 30 different flavors to try.  The restaurant says the wings are fresh and never frozen, cooked-to-order, so that's nice.  The quality isn't great (and one shouldn't expect it to be).  I like the dry wings here better than the wet (sauce) wings.  The garlic lemon pepper is a good, tasty flavor.  Some of the wet wing flavors, such as the honey teriyaki, taste funky.\\n\\nIn addition to wings, Wingnuts also serves sandwiches and wraps (e.g. Philly cheesesteaks, gyros), burgers, and salads.  Most of these are only $5-8 each.\\n\\nI had the chicken ranch salad ($6.95) once and it was pretty bare bones: iceberg lettuce, sliced tomato, shredded cheddar cheese, chunks of boneless fried chicken, and ranch dressing.  No other veggies.  At least the portion size was generous.  There was plenty of chicken.  I could tell the veggies were starting to wilt and get soggy, but they weren't completely old yet.\\n\\nWhether you're dining in or taking out, all food and drink are served in disposable Styrofoam containers.  Fountain drinks, condiments, plasticware, and napkins are self-serve.  The bottle of ketchup floating around the dining area doesn't look clean and the basket of ketchup packets are sticky.\\n\\nOrders are processed in a speedy manner.\\n\\nWingnuts has plenty of free parking.  The parking lot is located next to the building.  If facing Wingnuts, the lot is on the right.  Spots should be clearly labeled.\\n\\nOverall, I give Wingnuts 2.5 stars rounded down to 2 because it's not the cleanest place."},{"name":"Nook","address":"781 Denman Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Wonderfully friendly staff who are attentive and just nice.

His steak took a second trip back to the kitchen and finally came out right (except for the part he had already cut into).

While some dishes stood above others, I have to say the mains were absolutely amazing, especially the ribeye! I would be all over the Tuna Crudo if revisit anytime soon might I add.

The bar tenders are fantastic, provide prompt service even when the bar is slammed, and they are very courteous and knowledgeable about their beer & food. \\n\\n2. Order some of everything. I have dined in their traditional dinning room and ordered dinner before, BUT I very much rather enjoy their pub food and appetizer options. The pub burger is always perfect, the pretzels with cheese fondue are super tasty, and a newer menu item of lamb spare ribs were to die for! Tip: save some leftover cheese fondue from the pretzels to dip the truffle fries into, and thank me later.\\n\\n3. Sample some of their beers. You can order a 1/2 glass which is 8 oz for half the price of a pint. That is a fantastic way to taste some beautifully crafted beers and pair them with various menu options. \\n\\nAll in all I still love the Ravenous Pig whether for special occasions or for a secret night of guilty pleasures.

The food was just ok, but we left so disheartened that we will never go back again.\\n\\nWe arrived shortly after 8pm and the restaurant was not very busy. There were several empty tables. My boyfriend and I had just gotten off a very long shift and we both had not yet eaten for the day. All we wanted was to sit down, relax and have a bite. We got our drinks and put our orders in. 20 minutes later our drinks were empty and no one came to refill them.\\nAnother 10 minutes pass...and another and another.\\n\\nNot one, not two, but THREE entire families came, sat down, ordered, ate, paid their bills and left and still one came to check on us.

To start off our first DOV story, DC and I went to Chewies in Kitsilano last night. Neither of us had ever been here before and their ($30) menu looked appealing this year so we gave it a shot. We both loved it! Each dish was wonderfully executed. Read on to find out more. \\n\\nThe oysters aren't exactly part of the dine out menu per se, but you can get 3 of them as an add-on for $9. Since Chewies is known for their oysters, we thought we'd get one order to share. They called it \\"Shucker's Choice\\" Oysters because they just serve the freshest of whatever they have.\\n\\nEach oyster we got was different. I think we got one kusshi, one kumamoto, and one from the East Coast (can't remember the name). They were served with fresh lemon, grated horseradish, and a variety of their special homemade sauces. I tried two of the oysters and they were awesome! Extremely fresh and perfect with their sauces (which are wonderful too, btw). My favourites were the cocktail and the spicy sauce which gave a nice kick at the back.\\n\\nFor my appetizer, I got the Cajun Seafood Chowder. It was great! Creamy but not too heavy and there was a good amount of filling -- some halibut, prawns, potatoes, and corn. It even came with a nicely toasted piece of bread. Perfect for cleaning up the plate!\\n\\nDC opted for the Pork Belly Crackin' for her appy. It was served in a cute mini frying basket. There were 5 pieces which is actually quite a lot considering how unhealthy this is! It was good though. It was freshly cooked, the meat was soft, and it wasn't too fatty. The skin was crispy too but I did have some pieces where the skin stuck to my teeth -- maybe could've been fried just a tad longer. It was accompanied with some vinegar which was great but we'd prefer it to be more acidic to help cut the fat more. Otherwise, a solid dish. I'm not a huge fan of pork belly but this was actually quite good.\\n\\nMoving on to entrees...\\n\\nI ordered the Southern Fried Chicken and when I cut into it, I could see that the inside was glistening -- perfectly cooked! Tender and moist. Delicious. The batter was thin and crispy with a nice honey flavour. The mashed potatoes underneath were good too but very filling and buttery; I wasn't able to finish all of it. The green beans were the perfect veggie to go along with this dish.\\n\\nAnother entree option was the Cajun Jambalaya, which is what DC got. It was filled with toppings! Lots of chicken, sausage, ham, and even prawns. It was a bit too peppery and spicy for me but it definitely had that cajun flavour. Again, large portion but DC was actually able to finish everything!\\n\\nBy this time, we were both extremely stuffed. I was nearing my stomach's limit so thankfully the desserts weren't too heavy! I went for the Cayenne Chocolate Torte. I actually didn't notice the cayenne part when I ordered this so I was surprised when I was getting some heat as I was eating it. The flavour got stronger as I  progressed so I thought it was some sort of pepper and sure enough, it was! I've never had a chocolate cake like that so it was a unique experience. The cake itself wasn't very sweet which was a good thing, actually. They used dark chocolate so the spicy and bitter flavours (and sweet from the raspberry sauce) worked well together.\\n\\nLastly, DC got the Bourbon Pecan Pie. I tasted it and it was good too. I could really taste the bourbon in the caramel sauce that they used which was awesome. Again, the pie wasn't overly sweet. Everything was just right! \\n\\nSo that pretty much concludes my review of Chewies at DOV. The service was friendly (all male!) and the restaurant had a nice, cozy vibe to it. It's definitely a place you should check out if you're thinking of Dine Out or even if you just want some delicious, hearty, comforting soul food. Or fresh oysters! You'll definitely get that here. I heard they also serve up a good brunch.

They were super fresh and delicious that we had to get more. My boyfriend wanted to try the Premium oysters ($2.25 each) so we ordered 2 of that and 3 of the regular oysters. The server confirmed with us that we wanted 5 in total and asked us how many we ordered before. We replied 6. He asked \\"so 11 in total?\\" We said \\"yes, 6 earlier and 5 this time.\\" When the next round came, we received 11 BC oysters and 2 Premium oysters. We didn't want to cause any troubles now that they prepared this for us so we just ate it. Also, I was a tad bit intimidated by the server and he wasn't the friendliest server I had met. Fastforwarding to when we received the bill from a different person, it said we ordered 6 beach oysters and didn't have the second order at all. I had to correct him.\\n\\nNonetheless, I gave 4/5 because along with the oysters, their other dishes were delicious. The fried brussels sprouts was the best I had ever had - so crispy and flavourful. Cochon de lait just melted (literally!) in my mouth.

Nook had been on my list of places to try for over a year. I REALLY wish it lived up to the hype but it failed on every single aspect.\\n\\nWhen I entered the restaurant at around 630pm it was completely full, usually thats a good sign so I was happy to wait, some tables eventually left and I stood there for 15-20 minutes waiting for the staff to clear off the tables so I could sit down. An hour after arriving I was finally able to sit down and give the menu a look. A waitress came over to take my drink order, I asked for a ginger-beer, she told me that they didn't have ginger-beer so I said okay thats alright I'll order a ginger-ale instead she then told me \\"we only have coke\\" so I just stuck with the water. For food I started out with the Meatballs in Tomato Sauce and the Housemade Sausage Pizza. This is where it took a turn for the worse. Ten or fifteen minutes went by and two folks were sat down right next to me, they ordered a pasta and a pizza to share. Fifteen more minutes went by and a waitress brought out my neighbours pizza and pasta and they started eating. I tried flagging my waitress to ask her if she possibly forgot my order but she was nowhere to be found. I absolutely hate throwing a hard working person under the bus because maybe she was having an off night but she really ruined my meal, I think she had an Australian accent but I'm not 100% sure. Anyways I think the OTHER waitress working the floor asked MY WAITRESS where MY food was, forty-five minutes later my waitress brought my meatballs out. The meatballs were great, lots of sauce, hot, loaded with flavour, maybe a little over priced at 15$ for three meatballs but they were really good. For some reason my pizza took OVER an hour to arrive at my table. The table sitting next to me finished eating both their pizza and pasta before I even got my pizza, that CAN'T HAPPEN, I ordered before they were even in the restaurant. I honestly think my waitress just completely forgot my order, I wish she would have just came over and told me that, communication would have been key in this situation. The pizza was alright, nothing spectacular but I did enjoy it. I knew I was going to be reviewing Nook on Yelp so I figured I'd give the kitchen and waitstaff one last chance to redeem themselves so I ordered the Campanella Sausage with rapini and fennel seeds, it sounded very good. Was it good you might ask? ABSOLUTELY not. The sauce was the most bland thing I have ever tasted and the pasta itself was NOT cooked Al Dente and it was LITERALLY ICE COLD. This was the first time in my entire life where I had to send food back. When I wanted to send my pasts back my waitress was NOWHERE to be found YET AGAIN. The other waitress working handled the situation pretty well however because she came over and asked me if I wanted it remade or if I wanted something else but by this point I didn't want anything else. My mind had been made up about the Nook. It failed on every aspect and I was truly let down.\\n\\nIf you read my other reviews then you'll know I'm usually pretty positive and I ALWAYS give restaurants the benefit of the doubt but I just couldn't let this one slide\\n\\nMaybe one day I'll give Nook another shot but as of right now I DO NOT recommend giving this place a try."},{"name":"Lebanese Kitchen","address":"18631 SW Tualatin Valley Hwy","city":"Aloha","stars":"4.5","text":"Had the chicken sheesh tawook and the falafel.

So what made Steamers stick out from the rest. Well, it was because it was different from a typical mall food court restaurant. Usually food courts have one restaurant for each type of cuisine (ex. Mexican, burgers, Chinese, sandwiches, etc.). Steamers seemed to be a surprising option to be found in Portland. You would think that there would be restaurants this in larger town like Seattle, unfortunately this is a no. I would love to personally see Steamers or a restaurant like this up here in the Seattle area.\\n\\nThe menu is simple consisting of four main options. Spring rolls, pad thai, dumplings and bao (bun). The first two items are likely to be found in a Thai restaurant while the later two are found in Chinese restaurant and prevalent in a dim sum restaurant. The pad thai is pedestrian and you would be better off going to an authentic Thai restaurant. But the dumplings and bao make Steamers a good place to go. \\n\\nThere are four dumplings option including ginger pork, Szechuan chicken, chicken mushroom and spinach glass noodle.There are also four bun options including hoisin pork, curry vegetable, sweet azuki and coconut custard.\\n\\nDumplings are priced based on the number of dumplings you order ($4 for 4, $5 for 8, $5.69 for 12) and can add one bun for $.59 additional or two for $.99 more. A la carte price for the bun so it makes sense to order it with the dumplings if you want one.\\n\\nThe dumplings itself are a nice change of pace from the dumplings I am used to eating at Chinese restaurants especially the spicy Szechuan chicken. I would also suggest the chicken mushroom. I have had two of the buns, the hoisin pork which as good as any Chinese dim sum place I have visited and the curry vegetable which was pretty good also.\\n\\nFor the food provided, Steamers offers great value and good quality in a food court atmosphere where this may not be expected.

Drinks were separate.   Brunch was omelets, waffles, eggs Benedict with bacon and sausage.  Lunch included prime rib, fried and baked chicken,  smoked WHOLE salmon (head and all on display!) And some sides to compliment.  The dessert station was the size of a long card table with a chocolate fountain. A few pies and cakes to choose from.  To note, the server staff was great. \\n\\nOverall I was not impressed but left satisfied.

Now let me tell you a little bit about myself.  I am a very experienced diner, I have eaten at hotdogs stands and some of the most prestigious restaurants in the world.  \\n\\nIf you want to win the restaurant wars, service is where it is.  One of the finest servers that I have encountered in a long time, is Kelly this location.  She was on point every single moment and every single time.  One of the first things I noticed upon entering this restaurant was how clean it was.  I noticed that there was carpeting on the floor, great for sound dampening, (which I highly approve of)but not good when you spill food on it.  No foul smell when I entered this restaurant my hats off to the management and the cleaning crew.  Another item that I approved of was The sound dampening materials used.  Although the restaurant was very busy this Saturday evening, and noise level was average.  Again my congratulations to the design and management team for installing sound dampening material in their dining area. \\n\\nNow...on to the food.  My wife and I both enjoy having  wine by the glass.  No my wife and I are not wine snobs, so we just ordered the least expensive glass on the menu, it was cheerfully brought to our table.  They had a three-course special going on that evening.  We both took advantage of it. \\n\\nWe both had a Fleming's Salad.  See my photo.  We ate every bite of it.  My entree was a Petite Filet Mignon and Seared Pork Belly, fig Demi glac√© and grilled asparagus.  It was absolutely delightful.  My dessert was a Chocolate Berry Trifle served with Champagne sauce.  Everything was wonderful.\\n\\nOne thing I noticed...no salt and pepper shakers on the table.  The food speaks for itself.  No additional flavoring is needed.\\n\\nOne very exceptional service note.  At all times all the servers knew what we were getting. Too many times I dined out and here comes a server with plates of food asking who gets what.  This server knew what my wife was getting, she was served first. And then the server knew what I was getting.  These people are paying attention to the smallest of details.  It does make a difference.\\n\\nWonderful food, wonderful service, overall a fabulous experience."},{"name":"Chewies Steam & Oyster Bar - Kits","address":"2201 W 1st Avenue","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"This review is for happy hour only.

It was also served with a side salad which was filled with greens and veggies!\\n\\nSteak Tips- I went with Tater Tots and the mac and cheese for my sides. Whenever Tater Tots are on the menu I have to order them! There were crispy and salty just like you want. The mac and cheese was cheesy with a ritz cracker crust, next time I'd go with one of the flavored full size options! The steak was just ok, cooked a little under the medium rare I asked for and since I wasnt at a steak house I wasn't expecting top quality anyway. \\n\\nSpicy Chicken Pasta- This really is spicy!!

I don't know where this mud is from and who knows how long this batch of mud was waiting to be served to an unsuspecting customer.\\n\\nBut what really made me concerned was the lack of professionalism and care the owner showed toward me. When I ask about how something like this could happen, the owner simply shrugged and responded that they \\"can not account for the QUALITY of their food because they are quite busy and that this type of event had happened FREQUENTLY in the past\\". Their only offer of apology was to change out my hot pot for a new one. They did not feel it was their fault that I ate a contaminated soup but I was simply unlucky. The restaurant also did not seem to indicate they will be more vigilant of the food they will serve future customers. They also made me pay full price for my dinner. \\n\\nI am concerned that someone operating a restaurant is completely fine with serving their customer with food that has not been carefully checked and prepared.

But there was nothing very convenient about the store other than its location and the fact that they sold cigarettes. All the merchandise was laid out on the floor or sat confusedly on shelves, and most of the goods labored under a newspaper-thick layer of dust. There was no discernible order. You'd find tea in the same aisle as you would stacks of nudie mags. There were fridges to house some beer and soda, but I don't think the motors ever ran properly, which made them warm, glass display cases for beverages. In a way, this was fitting for a market that inspired curious repulsion more than any other feeling.\\n\\nThe guy who worked the register had the deep-rooted dark circles under his eyes of a person who never saw the light of day. He likely never slept because he never left the store, and the store was full of stale, incessant cigarette smoke to prove his devotion to his post. He was never flat-out rude, but he conducted every transaction as if he was hastily smoothing over some kind of illicit dealing. Based on the disarray of the market, we could only guess what kind of illegal goodies had to be stored in the back. Cocaine? Ten-feet-long pythons? Underage Cambodian ballerinas? We never found out before we moved. \\n\\nI've brought up this portrait of a shady bodega to illustrate how my current neighborhood convenient store, the J & T Market and Deli, is nothing like it. There's not much to the J & T on its own - it's literally that corner market where you occasionally stop for ciggies before hitting the bar or a six pack before meeting at your friend's or potato chips before heading home to your couch of shame. You won't find the ingredients for a wild mushroom risotto here. But the store looks reasonably clean, the beer is incredibly cold, and if the store proprietor keeps a nest of vipers in the backroom, it's probably more of a hobby than an important side business. The guy I normally see on the job here was even so nice as to suggest other markets in the area when he didn't carry the particular kind of cigarette brand I was hunting.

I always got a worthwhile dinner when I asked as described.\\n    This last time I had a women put tiny amount of pork, about a good teaspoon, in the burrito that wouldn't feed a cat. I asked for extra and agreed to pay the extra $2.50 amount, she puts another little tiny amount more, such that the total amount of pork was a now still a small fraction of what I had always gotten. I told her it still wasn't enough , not near what I'd always gotten,  and she offers to put another tiny amount for, get this, yet another $2.50 which I wasn't going to agree to.  I considered just walking out and telling her to keep the Burrito, but had waited in line enough and was hungry enough to just pay for the Burrito with its one \\"extra\\" pork amount, at additional $2.50, and go. When I got home I had to make more meat of my own.\\n   This young women was an absolute CxxT and a disgrace to the Chipotle chain and was most likely trying to save the pork so she could have more left over to take home at closing, for her own garbage family members or kids she doesn't deserve.

What a mistake this turned out to be.\\n\\nOur server was Charles, who was easily the most confrontational and defensive server I have EVER come across, period. This started when my brother and I got our \\"Big Ass 20oz Draft\\" beers. 20oz = 591ml/568ml (imperial)\\n\\nImmediately we were suspicious that we were being short poured. When we questioned Charles, he defensively claims that it is 20oz and that he'd bet us on that. Usually a quick defensive stance raises my suspicion of a guilty party.\\n\\nHe starts to BS by saying it's the shape of the glass.. Not buying it. He comes back with an empty glass an a bottle of Heineken (330ml). We pour it in (see my photo). It is obvious at this point that there is NO WAY that the remaining 260ml/230ml will fit in this glass. Rather than proving us wrong by pouring another bottle in, Charles brings us a shot glass and gives more BS about how drinks are poured. \\n\\nAfter trying every excuse in the book, Charles finally says \\"I take glasses that are labelled 20oz\\" and basically I'm just the server, talk to the owner. Don't blame him. It is very clear at this point that he knows they've been caught and tries to paint us as the bad guys by saying we are attacking him. Again, dead give away of guilt. Knowing the guilt, he comps the beers, but again in a very hostile attitude. Almost to the point where you could tell he just wanted to kick us out.\\n\\nAfter thousands of restaurant visits, this absolutely tops the list as the WORST service experience I've ever had, not to mention this happened in front of my dear mom. \\n\\nAbsolutely disgraceful treatment of patrons.

I'm a sucker for hole-in-wall hidden gem type of places. My boyfriend and I had had dinner elsewhere and were looking for somewhere to get ice cream for dessert. We had very few options at midnight.\\n\\nUpon entering, we sat ourselves and grabbed a menu, as the sign instructed. Some 5-10 minutes later, a waiter who was absent when we came in, as well as when a few others came in, came out and said loudly, \\"Alright, who's next?\\" A little unconventional as maybe I'm just used to someone keeping track of who arrived first, but we weren't in a rush. When we glanced up at him, he said that we looked ready and helped us first. We weren't sure if anybody who had already been seated when we are arrived had been waiting for service longer. He took our order, and helped everyone else quickly and efficiently.\\n\\nUnfortunately, when I ordered my scoop of vanilla ice cream with some raspberries on top of it, I specifically added the sentence, \\"I would have made it a sundae but I can't have any whipped cream.\\" I'm partially lactose intolerant, and whipped cream that is one of the few things that always upsets my stomach. About five minutes later, the waiter came out with my boyfriend's Rasputin sundae and my vanilla sundae. Nope, not ice cream by the scoop as their menu offers on the bottom (which I pointed to while ordering) where it humorously calls it \\"boring.\\" But a whole sundae....with whipped cream on top. I had to have my boyfriend eat the whipped cream from mine first before I could eat my ice cream. I also didn't want that much ice cream (which is why I ordered a pot of tea and ONE scoop if ice cream), so I had to leave some of it behind. I wouldn't have minded it too much but there is a price difference for the scoop of ice cream that I wanted and the large sundae with whipped cream and an extra scoop that I got (about $3, I believe). He seemed busy so I decided not to bother him.\\n\\nSadly, the pot of black currant tea that I ordered wasn't at all what I expected. The Russian in me was super excited to see this option, as I grew up drinking black currant tea. It was in the black tea options, which is usually what it is--a strong, robust black tea with black currant flavor. This one poured almost clear, causing me to pour my cup of hot water back in and allow it to steep more, thinking maybe it was so weak because the leaves had no chance to brew yet. I checked on it periodically, but it did not darken in color. I decided to wait until after I finished my ice cream, hoping it would be ready by then. It still poured almost clear, with just a hint of a tint to it. It tasted faintly of black currant, but was definitely not the robust tea that black currant is. I believe maybe enough leaves for one small teacup was put into an entire pot--diluting it greatly. I drank it anyway, paid, tipped, and left.\\n\\nYou know, I was glad to have found a place that had ice cream at midnight, and I did enjoy the ambience and the ridiculous restroom (and the doors upstairs telling you \\"not here,\\" \\"nor here,\\" and \\"not here either,\\") but that's pretty much it.

I figured a restaurant specializing in dumplings would have to have some idea of how to make them. Unfortunately, it would seem that I was wrong.\\n\\nI started with the miso soup, which tasted like it was not made with dashi as a base but with water instead. It contained tough dried mushrooms that had not been properly reconstituted. Not very good.\\n\\nMy girlfriend and I tried three types of dumplings: pork & kimchee, soupy pork buns, and the vegan dumplings. The skins were all very thick and doughy. The pork and kimchee dumplings each contained ground pork and a small piece of kimchee. Once the kimchee morsel had been eaten, you were left with flavorless pork and thick skin.\\n\\n As many reviewers have mentioned, the soupy pork buns are not xiaolongbao at all, but rather thick-skinned little pork buns that are seasoned in a manner similar to xlb. Calling them \\"soupy\\" is very misleading. The flavor of the pork wasn't bad, though.\\n\\nFinally, the vegetable dumplings were ok but lacking in flavor, as was par for the course. There was a dipping sauce provided, but the sauce shouldn't be the only source of flavor.\\n\\nI may go back one more time in a few months to see if the quality has improved, since it's pretty affordable, but I won't get my hopes up this time."},{"name":"Zeytin Turkish Cuisine","address":"4439 Edgewater Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"5","text":"Always delicious food served with TLC.

Not only did they have a delicious rosemary mushroom white gravy, they also had vegetarian breakfast sausage For drinks I got a Bloody Mary with their spicy vodka. Just the right amount of spice and their mix was so delicious. Then, of course, I moved on to mimosa which was huge. They serve it in a pint glass. They also have a plethora of other crazy cocktails. One of them (I didn't get but I was sitting at the bar so I got to see) the bartender literally lit on fire to make a carmelized sugar rim. It was really entertaining.

Ah, another food trend.  Our fries were overcooked to the point of barely being edible.  I was honestly surprised they would even serve them with the ends practically burnt. I didn't taste or see any truffle oil, but perhaps it all burnt off.  I was also surprised by the absence of grilled cheese's best friend - the pickle.  How are you going to open a GRILLED CHEESE concept and not give me a pickle spear on the side?  Unacceptable.  Between that and the overcooked fries, I was certainly happy it was a cheap meal.  I will probably give it another chance, but this will not be a place I frequent."},{"name":"Yuzu","address":"4130 SW 117th Ave, Ste H","city":"Beaverton","stars":"4","text":"i went to the place it is awful service .

It doesn't really have veggies to start with, so it's a little pricey to pay for extra veggies, just to get a few aside from bean sprouts. The sauce was lacklustre, it was nothing special. I wished I had ordered a different one.\\n\\nNext time for take out I spent a while deciding, but had heard the Garlic black bean sauce was good, so I tried that.  Although I was surprised and a little impressed to have actual black beans in it, the sauce was again lacklustre.  There wasn't much flavour to it.  I ordered it mild because I don't enjoy spicy food.  At home, I added some peanut butter because it was bland, and 2 I was starving and with a few veggies and rice noodles it wasn't enough to fill me up. \\n\\nMy husband ordered the Singapore noodles hot at 7 and it was way too spicy for him.  He should have known better, but he threw half of it out he was getting hiccups it was so hot and could barely eat it! lol.

HOWEVER, when we first arrived, the hostesses (all three of them) seemed unhappy to be there and barely looked up. When we were led to our table, the place looked dirty -- used cloth napkins/ rags on the floor; 3-4 cups on a server station that the servers were drinking from; dirty glasses stacked up on the divider between booths; paper from straws and empty sugar packets on the floor. It looked as if they had hosted a 5-year-old's birthday party and hadn't cleaned up yet. Then, we were seated near a server station where a HUGE guy with a blue-tooth earpiece kept SLAMMING fistfuls of flatware in bins. He turned and saw me with my eyes wide and mouth open, and just gave me a scowl before going off to set a table. We might go back there for takeout, but I would not want to sit in the place again.

Portions were average-sized (not necessarily a bad thing) and the dishes here were pretty straightforward, but it was just what we were looking for (reliable, tasty pub fare) on this particular evening.\\n\\nThe blackened chicken sandwich was extremely flavorful, with just the right amount of spice - I would absolutely order it again. The side salad could have used a little more flair (it was literally *just* mixed greens - it would have been nice if they had thrown in a couple shredded carrots or a few cukes or something...), but the blueberry vinaigrette dressing that I chose to go with it gave it a bit of a unique twist. I'm a sucker for fruity salad dressings - yummmmm.\\n\\nThe beer flight that I got was definitely the highlight of the meal though - I went with the Brewmaster's Choice, which was a collection of four beers called out on the specials menu. It was the perfect mix for what I was looking for (no porters or stouts in today's Brewmaster's Choice selection - yay!), and nice that the selection for this particular flight rotates from visit to visit. I would have kind of liked to see a build-your-own-flight option on the menu, but this curated collection left me satisfied for this time. My fave was the 'No Pulp,' a sour ale that was light and mildly tart - but everything I tried was actually quite good.\\n\\nOh, and there was truly delicious aroma inside this place that put me in a cheery mood as soon as we entered. Couple that with solid service, and we were overall impressed with our experience here. \\n\\nThey also have a super-cool mural of Boston-affiliated celebrities/politicians that made for a fun pre-dinner game of 'guess all the people in the painting.'

In the main dining room that is. Notes and everything I've ordered at the bar has been good. The crap dip is amazing but I wish they served it with bread instead of super salty tortilla chips. Anyway. Went here a few weeks ago for a friend's birthday dinner. I ordered the potato soup and it came out cold and salty. I also ordered the scallops and grits. I don't eat pork and asked if they could leave off the chorizo butter. The dish came out cold and the blue cheese was literally just chunks in the grits not folded in at all for that creamy texture.  I asked for a side of plain butter and that came out nice and melted But hot melted butter on cold grits....Huge miss. It was also missing the green tomato garnish.\\n\\nThe Ugly: Customer service. The host made a comment insinuating that we were too loud. We were the only ones in the dining room. Plus we just weren't. We weren't. It was weird. At the bar when it was time to cash out they had to enter our cards by hand which took some time. We were moved to the dining room. At the end of my meal, the waitress couldn't get my card to work. I told her that she would have to likely enter it by hand, as the bar had done. She looked frusterated and annoyed (I was too at this point) and instead of complying said oh do you have another one. I said no and she walked off with my card for at least 5 minutes.   She ended up typing  it in but the tablet/square chip thingee still wasn't working. She looked close to tears at this point and apparently they don't have an old school register anywhere in the building.

Even the ham and chicken croquettes which I would think would be hard to mess up at a Spanish Tapas Restaurant were awful.  The chicken was congealed and barely recognizable...it seemed like some cheap appetizer you get from the frozen section at the grocery store....yuck!

I liked the decor inside, including the fire producing table in the back. It seems like there is ample seating and standing room. I was a little nervous once the fire-dancers started swinging their fire around with the curtains on the stage and all... was envisioning some horrific fire incident happening. And I kept praying that the acrobats wouldn't hit their heads on the overhead stuff when they were climbing all over each other. The DJ was pretty decent and kept the music going. I didn't order any drinks so I can't speak about the price or quality but the waitress did stop by a couple times to check on us.

The person who took my order told me that it would take 45 minutes for my food to arrive at my house. I did not complain, since long wait times are expected on that day. One hour went by, and no sign of the food. An hour and fifteen minutes passed, and I decided to call to see if something was wrong. The same lady who took my order told me that my food was leaving the store as we spoke. She didn't apologize for the wait or anything. Instead, she gave me attitude for not taking into consideration what day of the year it was. I don't like to blame businesses for one employee's lack of professionalism, so I let it go. \\n\\nMy food arrived one hour and 45 minutes after I had placed my order (An hour later than promised). Mind you... this pizza place is less than 10 miles away from my house. To top it all off, the delivery guy decided to place the 2 liter bottle of coke and the box of wings on top of the pizza box. So, in addition to the pizza being cold, the cheese got stuck to the top pf the pizza box. The delivery guy had already left, so I immediately called Mr. Pizza to tell them what happened. I got to speak once again to the customer service representative of the year! She told me that she would gladly replace my pizza if I drove to the store and took the bad pizza back. Seriously? If I wanted to pick up my pizza, I would have done that in the first place, and I would have avoided the almost 2 hour delivery time, so I told her NO. After I complained, she offered to have another pizza delivered to me in 45 minutes. My husband and I did not want to eat pizza so late, so we told her to refund the pizza price, and we would just eat the wings. She said that she was not authorized to do refunds, but she said that she would make a note on our account, and we would have to call back the next morning to have the manager do the refund. I took pictures of the pizza for evidence, and we proceeded to eat the wings and garlic knots. The garlic knots were cold, and they were bathing in a pool of grease, so we couldn't eat those. The wings were kind of burnt and cold, and there was barely any sauce on them. We didn't enjoy it, but we were able to eat it. \\n\\nThe next day, my husband called to speak to the manager. The manager said he had heard nothing about the issue, but after he asked around, it was confirmed that there was a problem. He asked if we returned the pizza, and my husband said no, because the whole point of getting it delivered was for us not to have to leave the house. Therefore, the manager/owner said that he would not give us a refund because there was no guarantee that we didn't eat the pizza and were just trying to get some money back. Wow! Who speaks to a customer that way?!? Mr. Pizza does. Pissed off, I grabbed the phone from my husband, and I told him that I would have gladly given back the pizza, if the same idiot who delivered it had come back to pick it up, but it was not my job to fix someone else's mistake. After getting him to stop seeing us as opportunists, he offered to put a credit on my account. He said that whenever I felt like getting my replacement pizza, it would be free. I didn't understand how that would work exactly, but my husband just said to agree. We don't eat pizza often, but yesterday, we were in the mood for it. We drove to the place with the pictures of the pizza, our receipt, and all the notes I took while speaking to the idiots, and surprise... there was no credit on my account. The manager was not in, so the lady behind the counter called him, and you know what that poor display of a business owner said? He said that there was nothing he could do because there was no guarantee that we had not already used the credit he gave us in the past. What?!? Really?!? What a scam! I should have called my credit card company the day after this whole thing happened to have them get me my money back. I will never trust another person who offers me credit on my account, unless I get it in writing. He offered a 20% discount to try and keep our business, but we refused to spend another dime at a place that does not value their customers.\\n\\nBad business practices may get you ahead for now, but when KARMA comes knocking on your door, be prepared for what's to come. When you take advantage of a customer, you will be accountable for your actions at some point in time. We were not upset about the cold food or the burnt food.

But I guess I'm not dharmic enough to enjoy the food. The service was not even mediocre. In a review by luisa she said therewas a Thai flavour to the food. I guess the Thai flavor she had came from the Thai craft souvenir shop right next to dharma kitchen. The food is so bland that I can make it in 3 minutes in a microwave provided with a bowl and water. I guess the chef's job eligibility is to be clean and tidy that's it. No creativity and definitely no spices. I guess there is a little pich of salt though but I won't gurantee that. Infact I ordered what the menu said Bengal spicy burger. Nothing Bengali about it and I've already talked about the spicy part. The other dishes that my friends got were equally bad - buddhas bowl and tofu bowl. Basically rice with steamed bokchoy with tofu and yes Salt!  I don't know why but the place wasn't empty. But all I saw were white canadian customers. Maybe they are buddhists and survive on this kinda food. Coz the Chinese and Indian buddhists I've encountered so far have a different set of taste buds. Maybe having a Free Tibet bowl in the menu was a tactic to keep the Chinese customers away. LOL anyways please go there if all u like is fresh steamed vegetables. Those who don't try east is east a few blocks away which is awesome as we went there right after we left dharma kitchen.

Shrimp, avocado and Thai chili sauce went well all together with a touch of wasabi mayo. 89 martini is very refreshing. \\n\\nService: when we got there, there was only one guy working.

Then we ordered a round of drinks, and instead of bringing us three house margaritas, one top shelf margarita, and a tequila with lime juice, we got five house margaritas (and if I'm remembering correctly we had to go to the bar to see why those were taking so long, too). We asked if they were correct, server said yes, server was wrong, as we discovered they all were house margaritas. Our appetizer came out with the meal, but that was okay because two of our meals had to be sent back because they were incorrect, and it gave the two members of our party something to snack on while their meals were re-done. Our overwhelming response to the food itself was \\"meh\\" and we waited to get another order of drinks, but the server came back with the bill instead. We took it as a sign to leave instead of stay and waste more money.\\n\\nThe one upside was the manager or supervisor on duty was pretty hilarious.

They are the biggest biscuits I have ever seen in my life, and they taste just about as good. The outside is crispy and the inside is warm and moist.  It's even better when you slather the accompanying honey butter, which is light, fluffy and has just a hint of sweetness, over the biscuit. Although the menu says they come 4 to a bucket, depending on your party size you can ask for fewer. The biscuits are so gigantic that two people can probably share just one, plus you should save room for the main course.\\n\\nI love the brisket sandwiches here. The meat is juicy and well-seasoned. Although it's a little greasy, I'm not sure you can expect anything else of barbeque. The trays are a good value, since for around $20 you can get your choice of meat and two sides. There are lots of tasty sides to choose from too, including the mac n' cheese and collard greens. Similar to the biscuits, the entr√©e portions are big, so you can split with another person.

Their course, house seasoning was flavorful, but again, When paying north of $50 per steak I expect a perfect, high temperature sear. The crust wasn't as developed as I would have liked which was slightly disappointing but it was by all means an excellent steak. \\n\\nSo why only 4-stars? This was a tough call. The service and food at Old Hickory are both excellent. But with world-class establishments such as Bull & Bear and the main dining room at the Ritz Carlton Hotel a short drive away the competition is fierce. \\n\\nIn my opinion this restaurant certainly worth the splurge if at the lovely, Gaylord Palms Hotel and would make an excellent choice for a romantic dinner for two."},{"name":"Gari Japanese Fusion Brookline","address":"187 Harvard St","city":"Brookline","stars":"3.5","text":"The service can be hit or miss, but the food is sooo worth it.

This place ROCKS! \\n\\nAfter some thought I got the Jalapeno Cheeseburger with fries, and of course I had to get the onion rings since they bragged that they're made fresh daily.  The counter staff were very patient as it took me a while to decide, and I also had some high-maintenance requests.  They have 2 types of jalapenos (pickled and fresh) - - can I do both?  Sure!  For onions you have the option for diced, sliced, or grilled - - I'll take the grilled!  They cook their meat to medium well - - can I get medium?  Sure!  Cool beans!  I love it how flexible they are to customer requests!\\n\\nThe burger was fantastic, so full of flavor and cooked to perfection!!  The fries were really good, and the onion rings were great as well.  Although I think Hut's rings are a slight notch better (since they're larger and have a pepper coating), I think Dan's come in a close 2nd.  \\n\\nThe ranch and honey mustard dipping sauce they gave me for my onion rings were awesome.  I can't explain why, but their ranch tastes really good - - almost like it's homemade.

Upon first walking into this somewhat narrow eatery, you begin to wonder which delectable creation you want to consume, a heavenly grilled cheese, or a juicy mouth-watering burger. The orders are placed and paid for at the counter, and then you are given a tablemarker and sent about your way to find an open table and wait for your food. Although the wait time seemed a bit long, my friend ordered his burger well done (mine was medium well), which may have been what caused the slightly longer than average wait time. Along with both burgers, I also ordered a side of fries, because to me, having any sort of beef without some kind of a potato-based side has always seemed wrong.\\n\\nWhen the burgers finally came out, mine, The Classic, was aptly named. There is no fuss with this burger aside from the generous slice of tomato, use of leaf lettuce, and the golden, buttery, toasted bun. It's your typical classic burger that you might grill for yourself at home. Ketchup is provided on each table, but you have to ask for Mayo and Mustard, which was brought to me in packets. The menu says that the burger comes with Toasted's sauce, but typing this now, there must have been so little on there, because I forgot what it tasted like. Let's just say I've had more \\"flavorful\\" burgers at fast food joints.\\n\\nHowever, I'm glad they know how to properly cook a burger to where it actually comes out medium well. Most places I've been to either get it too close to well or medium, but the amount of pink was spot on. Also the fries, although somewhat lacking in flavor, were a fresher, crispier version of Steak N' Shake's fries, or a thinner version of Five Guys, depending on how you want to look at it. One thing I would add would be more choices of seasoning, because as it stands now, unless you have a taste for truffle oil and rosemary, you're out of options.\\n\\nThe prices are another thing I appreciate, and it earns Toasted a value-added fourth star. This is one of the cheapest places to get a craft burger that I've found anywhere in Orlando. Even if I had chosen another burger, it would have only cost me at most, $7 (or $1.25 more than I had spent on their basic burger), and loaded out with bacon and a fried egg, you can't spend more than $9 on one. Try finding that anywhere else. If you split the fries and sub the soda for water, you have a very good reason to not go anywhere else close by. I look forward to returning and trying something a bit more flavorful next time."},{"name":"Tasca Restaurant","address":"1612 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Brighton","stars":"4","text":"This is one of my all time favorite places in Boston.  The food is great, though the menu can be a bit overwhelming.  Sometimes the service has a bit to be desired but for the most part isn't bad.

I was a little disappointed when they wouldn't take reservations after 6pm for my birthday dinner party of 9 but I couldn't find many restaurants that were willing to accommodate us.  I've always left satisfied and smiling no more than $30 poorer than when I went in, usually no more than $25 (especially when I get their email coupons) even with 3 tapas, drinks, and desert.  \\n\\nBeyond all of the things one normally looks for in a restaurant the management is great and socially conscious.  They host fundraisers and when my former roommate was sick with a blood disease they not only hosted a fundraiser for her but also donated a gift certificate for her silent auction (all of the old ladies were disappointed to find out that it was a \\"Tapas\\" bar and not a \\"Topless\\" bar after they placed their bids)."},{"name":"Cactus Club Cafe","address":"1085 Canada Place","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Was on vacation last week in Vancouver and was super duper excited to try the cactus club!

When someone finally came up to the counter they looked at me as if I was ab to be placing an order five minutes before they were going to close. no one was eating there as normal and no employees appeared busy doing anything (also normal) so i assumed they'd know why i was there but as soon as i said i was here for a pick up, I could tell by the look on the employees face that my pizza was not ready to be picked up. and for second time picking ip an order, i was told i was probably at the wrong location or that i had ordered from a different pizza restaurant all together.I gave my name and then play looked at the computer screen fidgeted nervously for a second and said \\"oh uh k wait um yeah just um give us liiiiiike 5 no no sev seven minutes\\" It was frustrating hearing this because I didn't want to call the employee out on forgetting the order, I know what that's like it happens but I also didn't want some shit pizza thrown together in a hurry just so no one gets in trouble.\\nI stepped outside to wait for the pizza despite it being hot out. But it's so incredibly awkward in there because there are no guests and the employees seemingly cast doubt on my ability to properly be in their restaurant. \\nabout 4-5 minutes a very nice employee brought out pizza and handed it to me, said \\"thank you\\" and started to walk inside. Are yelled back to them, \\"hey wait I didn't pay!\\" even tho i had assumed that the pizza was giving meet to me for free because of the trouble. but in case it wasn't, i didn't want anyone to get fired over the till being short.\\nThe employee said to me \\"oh yeah that's right\\" and I followed them back inside where they said \\"that I'll be $15\\" The employee got behind the register as I was handing them the cash and kind of just looked at me oddly so I gave her two dollar tip because I wasn't sure what I was doing wrong and thought oh it must be that i didn't tip and you should always tip so i did. \\nWhen I got home I realized I only have three dollars in my wallet. And I thought oh my gosh, when I have ordered from here in the past I've never paid more than $13. So I looked up the price of my pepperoni pizza online and it is 13$. \\nI feel like they stole from me, honestly. The only reason I'm writing this review anyway. Pizza is pizza but this place fucking sucks and seemingly tips themselves? Probably to make up for the atrocious tips they usually receive because who would give money to someone who is making them feel unwelcome?\\n\\nAnd just to add, every other time I've eaten here I have a similarly ridiculous story that goes along with it. Even my roommate took his gov't co workers here for lunch and ended up apologizing to them for it. no for the food but for the service. \\nI know people are always like, why do you keep going back if the service is so bad? Well it's pizza, the first time I dinned in, the second & third time i picked up. it's not even worth it despite the location and the taste. \\n\\nso i've been here three months and within that time myself my roommate and his entire work team and sworn this place off. no wonder no one is ever in there."},{"name":"Elton's Roast Beef and Pizza","address":"478 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Arlington","stars":"3","text":"Finally, what Arlington needed; a place of their own to get a kickass beef sandwich.

My husband got the steamed mussels and said they were OK.\\n\\nFor our entrees, my husband ordered the CBC burger, and I ordered the pumpkin ravioli.  According to my husband, the burger was great but not spectacular.  He appreciated that they cooked it very rare.  My pumpkin ravioli was good . . . but so overpriced that I have to give it a thumbs down.  For $16, I got a total of 8 ravioli.  And not the big ones either; these were a good 2\\" by 2\\".  The knowledge that each tiny ravioli cost $2 really detracted from the meal.  From a culinary standpoint however, they were delicious - well cooked, with a wonderful sauce.\\n\\nI'd gotten a small appetizer thinking that a $16 plate of ravioli was going to be a bit larger, so I was still hungry after finishing my entree.  As a result, we ordered the nachos to finish off the meal.  They were nothing spectacular.  The chips were piled high, and the toppings (vegetarian chili, cheese, etc.) were good though meager.  There were too many bare chips for me to recommend this dish.\\n\\nFinally, the beer - I can't remember exactly what we got, and it's no longer on the menu, but again - mediocre.\\n\\nAll in all, I'd say that CBC is overpriced and nothing to write home about.  We won't be returning."},{"name":"Yuzu","address":"4130 SW 117th Ave, Ste H","city":"Beaverton","stars":"4","text":"The first time my fiance and I tried to go here it was around 6 on a weeknight, and while the dining area was full, there weren't other people waiting for a table, but we were still told no.

She wanted to get that massage she had coming from Valentine's Day this morning and go to Taste of Winter Park this afternoon. \\n\\nWe sat at the counter as opposed to our usual booth and noticed two new faces. Well these faces happened to be two of the three owners but we had no idea since they have been low key. Some of the regulars were upset over the change in ownership so I can't blame them for being low key about that. \\n\\nI deviated from my usual skillet and had coffee, a western omelet, hash browns and rye toast. My wife just wanted a one egg omelet with bacon, cheese, onion, tomato and jalapenos with a side of grits. We socialized with the owners while our food was being prepared and they were very pleasant people. I can't for the life of me understand why them being the new owners would be a reason to stop coming.\\n\\nThey were very candid about the problems with the previous ownership and what they had to do to get things back up to par. I appreciated their honesty because I already knew about the long list of issues they were contending with from the previous ownership. I was glad to hear that they tackled the ones I personally would have prioritized first and are addressing the cosmetic issues as they can. It was refreshing to see the passion in their faces when they talked about this place and what they plan to do in the future to make it an even more positive dining experience. There is no doubt in my mind at how committed they are to keeping Chubby's around for the next 25 years and beyond!\\n\\nOur food arrived and I took a photo for all to see. I have to give my server a slap on the wrist for making me wait on my toast but it's all good. She had it out by the time I was on my second bite of that omelet. I can't tell you what my wife's omelet was like because her jalapenos and I no longer agree. I can say she ate every bite of it. I can say that MY omelet was delicious. I prefer my hash browns a bit crisper but in all fairness, I forgot to specify that to my server so I can't blame them for that one. I took a bite of her grits and they were cooked right and NOT instant. Nothing bugs me more than a diner serving instant grits. \\n\\nThe Chubby's love is back and the food was what I have come to expect.

Their servers, while pleasant, often range from slow to completely inept. You grab a table and maybe the server takes your order, maybe not.

The first time was an amazing experience with a packed house of people who were there for the music.  The second time was a few days ago to hear Laura Camarra.  She was wonderful, a real musical talent, but the noise of people talking LOUDLY throughout her performance was really disappointing.  I understand that the place serves drinks and that talking is allowed, but you'd think that folks would have some respect for the musicians and keep their  conversations on the quiet side.  But the louder she sang, the louder the conversations became.  And she had asked for consideration at the start of her set.  It was so bad that I wondered why management of the space didn't ask for people to tamp down their volume.  After all, we bought tickets to hear the performance. Why go if all you want to do is shout over the musicians?

And the times I have been there, i've come out alive so thats a plus. \\n\\nThe hot wings are perfectly spicy and crispy AND they have homemade curly fries- see? Totally worth making the trek. Their homemade bleu cheese is a standout as well. \\n\\nApparently Mondays are AYCE- but I can't ever eat more than like 8 wings so that would be pointless for me... but if thats what you're into, check it out.

So creamy and tasty and with the perfect amount of vegetables.  It had tiny broccolis in it, which just made my day.  The bread they bring you pre-meal is very good and they prepare you a typical Italian olive oil plate with sunken basil leaves.  I added my pinch of salt and I was on my way to carb-heaven. \\n\\n The salad I had was average (balsamic) but my friend had bleu cheese and said it was good.  I saved the best part for last: the desserts.  That little modest case they have under the registers holds a treasure chest that now you can hold the key to!  Inside are some of the best desserts known to man.  We went on a tasting frenzy and had the peanut butter chocolate cake (with peanut butter fudge icing on the top and a reece's peanut butter cup to top it off).  This was in my top 5 of cakes all time.  We also tried the carrot cake and a peanut butter truffle (they sold out of this but we came back, thats how popular it is).  Simply orgasmic.  \\n\\nVisually, the other cakes looked stunning and a tear formed as I realized I only had one stomach.  I would love to try the rest of these desserts and also the other main courses.  I saw someone's chicken parmesan and it looked incredibly special.

This is my fault: if you call, they'll tell you whether it's a bialy day, and if you order them in advance, they'll obviously hold them aside for you.

Breakfasts are extraordinarily filling, and well worth the affordable price: coffee, huge omelet, toast, and homefries for $6.50 with tax; $1.50 less without coffee, mind you, but who gets a real diner breakfast without coffee?  The homefries were extra homey, where the chef took every vegetable from his home fridge and mixed it in.  Spuds, spinach, green peppers, red peppers, maybe some onions, a few carrots, mushrooms, and a few unidentified chunks made them a full serving of flavors.\\n\\nThe atmosphere at Brookline is itself a mix of everything.  Walls and tables don't match from one side to the other, but you quickly realize that nobody in the place cares--the charm is in having a comfortable meal with friends.  Sunday morning had a quiet energy with every booth conversing about something else.\\n\\nBottom line: the quantity of food for the price is impossible to beat in this city, and I would go back again.\\n\\nBike parking is available around the corner in front of the Middle East; not much available along the narrow side street in front of the restaurant itself."},{"name":"Kobe Japanese Steakhouse - Orlando","address":"5605 S Kirkman Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Food was pretty good (I had the hibachi steak and shrimp), but the service was severely lacking.

The sesame chicken was a little disappointing ONLY because I was expecting white-meat (breat meat), but it was all dark meat.  I'm going to ask for white meat next time and see how that goes...

However, the main dish was a disappointment. When the dish was served, the lamb was piping hot while the rice was lukewarm. Also the dish was served with a little small lettuce (a salad?) and some raw chopped onion. The lamb tasted good but it was not my expectation in taste of Middle Eastern (Lebanese) favor. I believe the lamb have been seating in the serving tray for a while. As for the rice, it was plain and I can barely taste the Saffron spice on top of the rice.

Don't go to this place if you are hungry, food is expensive and portions are ridiculous small.\\nMy husband and I had a terrible experience in this place. We got a 25 gift certificate from restaurant.com so we decided to give this place a try. Big Mistake! It is not worth it.\\n To be fair, parking was not too bad; we found a place to park on the street couple blocks away. It was December 30th, so we were expecting much worse. In addition, I got to give credit to the place that the ambience is cute and nice. \\nHowever we are extremely disappointed with the food and service. First of all, the waiter started saying the specials and in the middle of it the manager called him and he left us and never came back to finish it. I never got the drink or the menu that I asked for this guy. Honestly I have my doubts if he really speaks English or if he was understanding us. My husband ordered a regular glass of water with ice, what is free in most of the places. They brought him a huge bottle of sparking water that costs $7. I ordered coke and yayy they got that right. Finally another waitress started serving us and she was just fine. We didn't order any appetizers, the brought us bread with oil and herbs, it was good. The only decent thing I ate all night in that place. I ordered gnocchi and my husband raviolis. Apparently it was hard for them to know if they had raviolis or not. They kept changing their minds 3 times about the availability of the dish (dish that was on the menu). \\nFor those who don't know, gnocchi supposed to be thick, soft potatoes dumplings. Whatever I had there was disgusting. It was really hard, thin and grease with some sort of oil on it. I couldn't eat that, if you come from an Italian family where your grandmother makes gnocchi every Sunday, you would know my pain. My husband's raviolis were okay, but he was extremely disappointed with the portion size. It was just 5 raviolis for $22. FIVE, in a huge and deep plate, 5 raviolis. Come on!! He is a big guy, I am sure he can handle more than 5 little raviolis. A four years old kid totally could have finished that plate. \\nHence, by the end of the entrees we were both starving. So we ordered the desert. They don't have a desert menu but by the waitress description of the desert, it sounded pretty good and promising. I don't remember the name of the dessert but she said it was a chocolate cream not light as a chocolate mousse but not as heavy as a pudding. Well, that was a pudding. It was the most flavorless pudding ever, with a very hard and old cookie on top of that. \\nWe ended up with a $63 bill. Don't get me wrong, I don't care paying a lot for a good dinner... But that was not a dinner. We had nothing to eat, we didn't drink nothing, and it costs us $63 dollars plus tip. It was a mediocre expensive dinner.

I've ordered twice online. The first time the app listed a wait time of 3 hours. The online instructions were very clear to call the store to have them cancel if needed. Even after being transferred to a manager, I was still told I needed to cancel app orders online. Within about 5 minutes of listening to her fumble around her store she told me \\"don't worry, I'll take care of it for you,\\" like she was going out of her way for me. The second time, upon arriving to pick my burrito up, I see two employees talking to each other at the register, one eating and another going on a break. I tell the register employees my name and that I'm picking up an online order. They proceed to look hopelessly like they aren't even aware what online ordering is and when they figure it out, proceed to make 2 burritos before mine. When I asked if they thought it was appropriate to serve another customer before the one who put an order in an hour ago, I was told \\"we just opened so we couldn't have made your food until now.\\" When I asked if maybe they could have made it before two other burritos which hadn't been ordered in advance so I could avoid the line, they repeated \\"we just opened so no.\\" When I also asked if maybe they could have used some of the time they spent making the two employee burritos to make the one I ordered I think they started to understand how much they sucked at yet another burrito. \\n\\nThis is the closest Chipotle to my work and I do enjoy the food but I have a bad experience there literally every time I go. Usually it's just slow and lazy service from the 50% of staff who is ever working at a time but the extreme lack of care, cleanliness, ability to manage routine procedures that makes me really understand how Chipotle Norovirus and other food outbreaks occur in Boston so prevalently."},{"name":"Little Sheep Mongolian Hot Pot","address":"2400 Seton Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I've heard tons of people talk about Little Sheep since its opening but never got around to coming here till someone suggested it today.

Putting venom aside, I went to try this new upstart restaurant with an open mind. I am now even more upset that Nancy's is no longer there.\\n\\nThe new owners/staff have generally recycled the equipment from Nancy's; but the difference is: this place is aimed at the slightly more formal dinner crowd. Meaning larger family sized tables, and tablecloths.\\n\\nNot in the mood for formal food, but instead for the standard congee-noodle-rice meu, I tested this restaurant with my personal quality test: wonton noodle soup ($4.50.)\\n\\nThe slop they put in front of my looked foul. The soup was grey, and tasted like msg and old soy sauce and boiled meat. The noodles were some sort of thin, chewy egg noodle. And the wontons were over boiled (meaning mushy and falling apart) and looked like it came out of a freezer.\\n\\nI also ordered a plate of black pepper & honey garlic wings (~$6.00.) This came out ok, but honestly chicken wings are hard to screw up. (I know since everyone asks me for my chicken wings recipe and I'm too proud/ashamed to tell them its whatever I can lay my hands on in my kitchen condiment rack.)\\n\\nHaving said this, it does appear to be aimed towards the family dinner crowd (instead of the late night fast food crowd.)

Unfortunately, BBQ is not one of them. Out of the few BBQ offerings the city has to offer, Sweet Cheeks takes the top spot in my book. \\n\\nThe main reason is because their sides are really good.

The collard greens hit the magical balance of acid, salt, smoke and spice and are always cooked to the perfect consistency. The mac and cheese, creamy, cheesy, and topped off with the right amount of crunch for texture, is another standout. Others include the coleslaw, pickles, and potato salad, which I don't even typically like. They also used to offer a Mexican Caesar salad that my boyfriend would dream about at night. Unfortunately for him, that's since been taken off the menu. \\n\\nTheir meats on the other hand... much less rave-worthy, but still ok. The brisket is pretty good, and definitely better than neighboring competitors I've tried. The pulled pork and ribs are also tasty options that I would order again. The fried chicken was probably the one big letdown, especially given its hefty price tag. \\n\\nAnd I'd say that price is overall my biggest complaint.

When I buy coffee instead of making it at home, it's about having an experience, and the quality of the coffee is only part of that.)\\n\\nThe food is handmade from natural ingredients and it shows. Yesterday, my prosciutto parmesan scone was heavenly -- fluffy and light, with some crispness to the dough thanks to the cheese. The combo of salty cheese and peppery prosciutto was out of this world. I also tried a vegan cranberry walnut muffin and I didn't miss the eggs. In fact, I liked this better than normal muffins. It was a dark color (from whole grain flour or natural sweetener such as brown rice syrup? not sure) and liberally sprinkled with cranberries and walnuts -- they don't skimp. The sandwiches and homemade soups are always good too. At least for a somewhat high price, the quality is predictably good -- which isn't true everyplace you go.\\n\\nOn the downside, this place gets SO flippin' busy. People monopolize the booths for HOURS while reading, studying, or working on a laptop, their long-empty coffee cups defiantly displayed on the table to broadcast the message, \\"Yes, I DID buy something!\\" On the other hand, it is nice that the staff don't police and harass people to leave.

We ate here one time before several yrs ago and it wasn't memorable in a good or bad way. We started off by getting seating in the very from in a cramped 2 top right next to the ONLY other diners (another 2 top) The table was very wobbly and the whole place just felt kind of dusty and a little grimey. Waitress came after we waited about 5 min (she was sitting by the bar doing nothing) and we presented our coupon and made sure in advance if it was ok to use the coupon as well as order from the special discounted stimulus menu. She was not sure so she waiting about 8 minutes til her manager arrived to double check. Manager gave the OK so we proceeded. We ordered the Cava and our meals. \\nI had a tuna tartar salad on arugula. I will admit it was quite good- surprisingly so. Not the best tartar ever but what was I expecting- in fact I dont' know what I was thinking ordering that in the first place since I had a bad feeling from the beginning. My honey had a vegetable tartlet. It didn't look too impressive. It looked like it was cooked sometime last week and re-heated. \\nFor a main course I had fillet of beef over a salad. The beef was some cut unknown to man. It was somehow an oblong shape and cut on the bias. Strange she asked how i'd like it cooked (medium rare please!) but it came fully medium and was COLD. The salad (it was greens, thats all) had a pretty nice dressing. My honey had bow tie pasta with something it it... mushrooms? Peas? It was a higly unmemorable dish and according to her it was nothing special. Could use some better seasoning etc. Dessert for me was flan and I was very impressed. It was delicious. I am no flan aficionado but I really liked it- highlight of the meal. Honey had 'duo of truffles' otherwise known as we melted chocolate, poorly formed it into a ball and then put it on a plate. Tasted fine but nothing special- no great texture or anything like you'd expect in a truffle.\\nSo the bill came and we were charged for the Cava. I had predicted this from the start seeing as how our waitress was a space cadet and the joint clearly needs some fine tuning. So the manager came over and said It was only free for a party of 6 but she gave us the 10 bucks off anyways. Admittedly we did not read the find print BUT it was ok'd personally by the manager so we felt we shouldn't pay for it. She put up a little bit of a fight but by then the place was packed so she clearly didn't want to make a scene- the only smart move of the night on her part.\\nSo it was a 3 course meal for 2 including a bottle of cava all for 23 bucks.

The rolls were decent but not pressed very tightly so some of the fish was falling out. \\n\\nNot quite sure why bartenders double as waiters here because the kitchen is separate from the bar and they are already preoccupied enough with preparing drinks to manage both.\\n\\nWhat I do like about Sinju is the location and decor inside. The design is modern Japanese style. The bathrooms are pretty cool, basically a mirror box. You can't really avoid watching yourself take a wee. The mirror studded pyramids above the sushi bar and floor-to-wall bamboo wood is cool too."},{"name":"Rocket Breakfast","address":"5235 NE Sandy Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"Not having visited the Rose City Food Park in a year, I walked around to see if any new food carts popped up.

All sandwich trays are also served with pickles & onions, and your choice of \\"scoop\\" (side). \\n \\nThe Prime Beef Brisket was fatty, soft, juicy, and minimally seasoned. You can dip those in one of their 3 sauces on the side of the table, I especially enjoyed their homemade BBQ sauce!

You see, I had a conversation not too long ago with a native Californian who had no idea that \\"jimmies\\" were just another word for chocolate sprinkles.\\n\\n*** 6/2013 visit ***\\n\\nShortly after 6pm one Saturday, I had absolutely no trouble finding a parking spot on Corinth Street.  In fact there were 3 different open spots on either side.\\n\\nInside the small ice cream shop the counter was to the left, with six small round tables along the wall to the right with some seating.  Additionally, a single standing round table was located just by the door with a pair of stools.\\n\\nAs I had made my way into the store, I noticed the Veggie Pesto Crepe $5.95 on the blackboard outside.  Sounded yummy.  Unfortunately their crepe menu needs some updating as the apple crepe is off the menu, so I instead went with the Elvis Crepe (creamy peanut butter, freshly sliced banana, & Nutella) $5.95 and added a scoop of vanilla ice cream for a buck, thus surpassing my $10 voucher by $3 and change.\\n\\nThe elder lady worked on my crepes, folding them with bare hands - since I had made no personal observations to the alternative, I'm going with the assumption that she had done so with clean hands.  The younger lady continued to take orders and to handle the ice cream.\\n\\nSpeaking of which, the ice cream bins were evidently Richardson's ice cream, however, they were not individually marked.  The flavors were, however, listed on the board up on the wall.\\n\\nCrepes were served simply with no additional sides.  I took mine to go, so the scoop of ice cream was served in a covered cup in a separate bag.  The crepes were tender yet bouncy.  The filling sufficient.  The veggies were cooked just right and of good sized chunks.  They were both good.\\n\\nBe flexible when you come here - as they might not have what you want ie. the apples I inquired about, the chicken another party was interested in - and perhaps you'll leave satisfied.\\n\\nIn response to Antonio F.'s observations, I din't notice any odd smell this time, and the place wasn't especially dirty.  But the day of my visit wasn't particularly hot either inside or out.\\n\\n*** 8/2013 visit ***\\n\\nUtterly bummed that crepes have been taken off the menu as of about a month ago - unfortunately, they weren't popular enough.  Too bad, because I liked them well enough and they were among the more interesting options.  Their online menu has yet to be updated accordingly.\\n\\nNo crepes, so I went with a lobster roll $11.99 real Maine lobster, served on a grilled roll, freshly prepared, lightly seasoned mayo with lettuce, served with chips or cole slaw (on menu, but on the wall it said chips AND cole slaw), the grilled veggie panini $6.95 fresh garden vegetables, blend of melted Swiss & cheddar cheese on a ciabatta roll served with cole slaw or chips, and a side of potato salad $2.50.\\n\\nIn addition to Richardson's ice cream, they sling Richie's Classic Italian Slush.  I also spied mention of a Kids Meal Deal $5.99 for a sandwich, drink and kiddie ice cream combo - not bad!\\n\\n15 minutes, and I was out with my order.\\n\\nThe lobster roll was long and thin and well toasted with perhaps a hot dog sized portion of dressed lobster meat enclosed in the roll.  Not a destination item, but if you're here and you feel like lobster, not a bad choice for the price.\\n\\nThe veggie panini was actually pretty tasty, with a good mix of vegetables tucked between the chewy ciabatta.\\n\\nBoth the cole slaw and potato salad were rather small in portion with the cole slaw served in something you might expect to find tartar sauce, and the potato salad presented in one of their kiddie ice cream styrofoam cups which hold perhaps 4 or 5 oz.  Cole slaw was more of the vinegary creamy sort - too much mayo according to one DC.  The potato salad was pretty basic.  Neither were a close contender to my faves - KFC for cole slaw and Sam LaGrassa's in terms of potato salad - but both were okay."},{"name":"Cambridge Brewing Company","address":"1 Kendall Sq, Bldg 100","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"If you come here, understand that you are coming for the outdoor seating and the nachos.

It's limited, so you may have to circle around and park in the bigger shopper center adjacent to it. Tiny little area for ordering, and a slightly bigger patio outside. It's a good place to chill, assuming you don't come on a super hot or cold day. \\n\\nFood wise, I've had a few tacos and one burrito. The tacos are small ish, but 2-3 will fill you up. The carne asada was great. The pastor and carnitas were just OK. It all tastes fresh, just the flavoring and cooking of the meat is what's going to determine whether it's good or not. They all tend to pack some heat though, so be prepared. Very fair price for barely $2 a piece. The burritos are much bigger, and they can probably will you up with one. Unfortunately for me, I made the mistake of getting carnitas instead of steak (I forgot which one I enjoyed last time). The carnitas were very tough meat, super dry. I actually couldn't eat all of my burrito because of that reason. Their chips are pretty good too, thicker than what you'd expect, but crunchy and flavorful enough on their own.\\n\\nThey have an assortment of canned Coke drinks, but I opted for the Horchata (Wikipedia tells me it's a traditional drink made with ground almonds, barely,  rice, and various seeds). It had a thin, creamy texture. Smooth, barely sweet. It's a nice contrast if you want something different. \\n\\nAll in all, not a bad place. Just pick around with their tacos to see which one works for you."},{"name":"Food Shui","address":"1700 W Parmer Ln, Ste 610","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"I love the food; it's great for the price and they are quick.

I have been to Haiku many times since it opened, and they have all been okay. It was never my go-to sushi spot, but if I wanted sushi in the Short North or to enjoy a beautiful patio when the weather was nice, I would dine at Haiku. But after last night, I doubt I will return.\\n\\nMy boyfriend and I had reservations at 8:30, and we were seated immediately upon arrival on the patio, as I had requested. It was about 10 minutes before our server came to take our drink order, which I didn't care for, so the evening was already off to a rocky start. \\n\\nWe finally got our drinks another 10 minutes after we ordered them, so that made it 20 minutes with no drinks. It doesn't matter how busy you are, that is unacceptable. We ordered our food then, and began to drink our saki. The cold house saki was decent, but the hot house saki was better, even in the heat. \\n\\nSo we finished our saki, and for another 10 minutes we had no drinks. During this time, it is not just that our server didn't check on us, but I didn't even see her on the patio. Eventually, she came out to give the table next to us their drinks, and I was able to flag her down to order another round as she was on her way back indoors. At this point, it had been a half hour since we had ordered our sushi, so we decided to ask about it because we were supposed to meet friends at 10:00 in the Arena District. \\n\\nOur server came back out to attend to another table, and when we flagged her down to inquire about our dinner, she gave us a laundry list of generic excuses in the manner of a more attentive, better server at an actually good restaurant reciting the daily specials: \\"It's a Saturday night; we have a full house; it feels like Gallery Hop; I put your order in, so it will come out in due time\\"; etc. She did not, however, have a specific time, and she did not even offer to check. At this point it was 9:45, and we told her we just wanted our check because we had to meet friends in 15 minutes. She apologized and left. \\n\\nMaybe 5 minutes later, as we were contemplating what to because now we had only 10 minutes, a man who did not identify himself, but who I suspected was some sort of manager, apologized and asked us if we wanted this plate of sushi that he was holding. I appreciated the gesture, but I wasn't thrilled by the idea of quickly eating a random plate of sushi. It was also very clear that this was absolutely not our order because the beef dish that my boyfriend, who is allergic to shellfish, ordered is not being offered to us along with the sushi. We thanked the man but reiterated that we had to meet friends at 10:00, so we would rather just have our check. He apologized again, and, to his credit, said that he would discuss the situation with the staff involved. I think this is a very good move because based on other Yelp reviews, this sort of experience seems to be pretty common. I don't believe that makes it acceptable, though. \\n\\nThen our server came back out with what we thought was our check. Half right! Hilariously, it was also our second round of drinks! It was nice that they came out, and we drank them, but it was now 10:00, 15 minutes after we had initially asked for our check. I'm not sure why we were still served and charged for drinks that we had ordered 20 minutes ago, especially considering that we told our server what time we were supposed to be somewhere else. Every other time I've been in a situation similar to this, the server has made an effort to help us get where we need to be on time. I'm not sure if this is obliviousness or blatant disregard on the part of Haiku, but I don't really think it matters. The result is still the same. \\n\\nClosing thoughts:\\n1. Obviously, lovely patio, but not worth the headaches that one must endure to experience it. It's hard to enjoy a patio without a drink.\\n2. Our waters were never refilled, so this might not be a good place for nondrinkers, either.\\n3. Haiku is not the busiest restaurant in the city. How are other busier restaurants able to maintain a high level of customer service and Haiku is not?\\n4. If you tell your tables that the reason for their long wait is due to a crowd, then maybe you should actually look busy instead of disappearing for long periods of time. \\n\\n\\nHaiku no longer really attempts to be great. It is a well-known restaurant in a desirable part of the city with a beautiful patio. Is that enough for you? It is not enough for me."},{"name":"JuiceLand","address":"7329 Burnet Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"The best!\\nThese gals offer really good choices/selection with minimal heavily processed foods.

Usually if you want to sit outside on the patios, they only take walk -ins. So I put my name down, and note, that you have to be around the calling area, because they don't offer texts when the table is ready. I think the hosts overestimate the time to the point where it deters people from putting their name down sometimes, although I get there has to be a fine balance. So she said 1 hr 15 minutes, nevertheless I put it down and in 20 minutes I got a table, what a surprise. So for brunch we had a bloody mary, the kind where you tick all the items you want, $12 is the base of a basic blood mary with add ons. My friend had a buffalo chicken sandwich which I have to say was very dry and unappetizing. While I had a clam chowder to start. When the waiter brought the clam chowder, the bowl was dirty with brown stains on it, and I definitely know for sure that it wasn't part of an \\"add on\\" so I told the waiter. And the waiter offered me napkins, which I was more hoping to have her say that she was going to replace it with a new bowl of soup. Nevertheless, she came back, without ever acknowledging the issue as if nothing had happened, part of good customer service even when there's something wrong is to immediately spot out the error and rectify it, which I felt was underhanded and underplayed.  Again, I should have known better, as its in a tourist area during rush hour, there's only so much you can expect for the price you pay, huh?

Still good vibe (\\"3\\").  Glassware is kitschy southern mason-jar, which annoyed my dining companion (me, not so much). \\n\\nService = \\"2\\"  I think the restaurant needs to focus on it's training although the server for the table next to ours seemed a bit better.  Our server asked me what I wanted in my \\"gin and tonic\\" (I head specified the brand of gin, she meant like \\"what else\\" ... umm, ice?) and it came with a lemon.  She explained the concept of \\"dry\\" BBQ and pointed to the sauces on the table, but failed to identify the different sauces.  We realized that we didn't know anything about the sauces once we had food and desperately needed to apply some (see below). Unfortunately,  at that point our waitress was nowhere to be found in order for us to ask.  Later, I saw another server explain the sauces to her table, so this may just be a training issue.  They have a bunch of interesting gins and other alcohols from smaller distilleries so I found this impressive. \\n\\nFood = \\"2.5\\"   Things did not get off to a promising start when when the server had to go check and see if \\"they were still out of ribs\\" ... they were.  Given that ribs are a mainstay of BBQ places I would recommend not running out if you are a BBQ place!!  We ended up trying the chicken (good), brisket (terribly dry and tough), tasted too much like smoke and too little like a delicious meat).  Pork belly - was also terribly  dried out (which is hard considering natural fatty-ness of the cut).  As others have noted it was very fatty, but I do not consider this a negative as I expect this out of a pork belly.  The sauces were fine, but unremarkable.  All the sides we had were good, but it is hard to go wrong when you involve melted cheese.   As others have noted you get 2 random pieces of white bread (un-buttered, plain, room-temp).  Our pieces, like those at the tables around us went untouched.  I would ditch the bread and just give some complementary biscuits/butter, cornbread,  or Texas toast. \\n\\n As a Northerner who has spend a long time transplanted in the south I am very familiar with the concept of \\"wet\\" and \\"dry\\" preparations of BBQ and unlike of my Southern counterparts don't feel strongly about either preparation as long as the outcome is delicious.  Unfortunately 2 of our 3 meat choices bordered on dessicated which should not be how any BBQ is served.   When we walked in, it looked like the chef might have had the night off but later we saw Chef Faison greeting some tables, thus things can't be written off as a sous-chef night. \\n\\nPortions of side-items are normal/generous.  Meat portions seemed small individually, but when you combine two together equal your average fine-dining restaurant portion.  Whenever I eat BBQ (usually in Memphis and usually in a place bordering on a dive)  it always costs more than I expect (because I think I mentally subtract dollars when I enter a dive). I also think that BBQ just costs more than people think.   I think the prices at Sweet Cheeks would be reasonable if  the food quality and service improve. It is a beautiful new restaurant in the Fenway area so I am willing to throw down a little change  for the ambiance of a real restaurant. \\n\\nI would be open to going again, but probably only if joining friends.

The driver get here at about 30 min after placing my order( so far so good) until I open the box. Just the mere sight of the pizza screamed amateur or even lazy! Assuming that isn't their normal standards. The pizza itself was not in any definition a pizza. It lacked sauce and cheese.

I took 2 fingers and could separate the top of the crust and bottom and revealed 2 paper like consistency of cooked dough and pepperoni. No cheese or sauce keep in mind. When i bit into it, all I could taste was sweet flavored dough that was rough and dry in texture.  I'm glad it came with a side of sauce because It would have been completely unpalatable.

The courses are well-proportioned and I am not generally a light eater.\\n\\nIf you prefer meat-and-two-veg, this will require you to expand your comfort zone a bit. It's not full-on MG as one might find at Castagna, but there is a bit of experimentalism beyond what you'd find at most mainstream PDX restaurant. Dishes like an apple soup with a touch of maple syrup and raisins; wagyu culotte steak with carrots and turnips dusted with cocoa powder; and razor clams tartare (not totally raw, don't freak). At $50 for the tasting menu, it's bizarrely inexpensive for what you're eating.\\n\\nRaci√≥n reminds me of Manresa circa 2005, before the Michelin stars. Eat there before they get discovered and the reservations get impossible."},{"name":"Grays","address":"301 W 6th St","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Lovely view of the park, the crab cake very heavenly,  the bloody mary was bloody good.

That being said, Bagel Palace Deli and Bakery simply pales in comparison to the real thing.\\n\\nFood: Bagel Palace specializes in New York style sandwiches, bagels, and baked goods. The bagels were well-executed and flavorful; slightly crisp on the outside, but soft on the inside. Unfortunately, the rest of their food offerings left much to be desired. The blintzes were bland and improperly prepared. Moreover, the sandwiches were flavorless, lacking fresh ingredients, and meager in portion; a New York style sandwich should be bursting with flavor and so large that you can barely hold it with two hands. On our way out, we also picked up some cookies and a brownie, all of which were excruciatingly underwhelming; again, poorly executed and flavorless. \\n\\nService: Contrary to previous reviews, I actually found our waitress to be quite pleasant. However, she did state that she just started working there, so perhaps she wasn't jaded yet. \\n\\nAtmosphere: This place has the charisma of a flesh eating disease. The floors and tables are filthy and the ambience is that of a 24 hour highway truck stop.\\n\\nCost: Inexpensive; you could easily feed two people here for less than $20. However, what you aren't paying for in price is clearly reflected in the lackluster food and ambience. \\n\\nOther: If you're in the mood for a a bagel or NY style sandwich, I'd recommend walking across the plaza to Goldberg's .

It's served in a blue speckled tin cup stuffed with creamy mac and cheese and topped with crumbled crackers or breadcrumbs (i wasn't really paying too much attention before digging in). Beware!

When I arrived on Sunday morning at 8:00am, there were people sitting at 2 tables and a line of 6 people at the counter.  My intent was to dine in and enjoy the meal before hitting the road.\\n\\nI must have missed the sign when you first walk in about waiting to be seated.  The server was nowhere to be seen (for at least 10 minutes) and it appeared that at that time of the morning, you ordered from the counter based on the line there.\\n\\nI ordered poppyseed bagel with Novo, cream cheese, tomato, and capers and coffee and sat down at one of the small tables waiting on my breakfast to be brought to the table.  Little did I know that orders placed at the counter were for take-out only.  The server finally appeared and in a rude voice asked if I was ready to order.  When I told her I already had at the counter, I was told in a very stern tone that the counter was for take-out only and that I couldn't eat at the table.\\n\\nI politely asked if I could eat at the table this one time since I was a first timer and didn't know the policies.  After asking a second time and explaining that I was driving back home to NC, I got a begrudging yes.  Honestly, if they didn't already have my money, I would have told her I was taking my business today and in the future to Goldberg's.  No suggestion to change my order to the equivalent dine-in selection or to show a little empathy for an honest mistake.  Instead, my bagel still in its styrofoam container was slapped down on the table without any comment.  I couldn't enjoy it because of the rudeness displayed by the server.\\n\\nThe bagel was very good.  I'd give it at least 4, if not 5 stars.  But the service deserves 0 stars.  I don't see how they stay in business by treating customers like they do.  And it's a shame, because they have a great product that you can't find in many places in the Southeast.

The dipping sauce it came with was, according to my friend, \\"Nondescript\\", but I tasted it and realized that it was merely soy sauce with a few sesame seeds in it. She said her chicken teriyaki bowl was just ok. So, all in all, the meal itself was just average.\\n\\nHowever, their service is what I have a problem with. I just didn't understand how it worked. It's not truly a self-service restaurant because there was a guy walking around clearing the tables... honestly, he was a bit annoying because he came up to our table each time we finished a dish and asked if he could take it. Furthermore, although after our order, we were given the shrimp tempura roll and th smoothie on the spot, we had to have the appetizers, CA roll and the rice bowl delivered to our table. They brought the rice bowl and CA roll right away but our appetizers weren't brought out yet. So, when we told this guy who was also clearing tables that we ordered appetizers, he went to check on it. He came back 10 minutes later and asked us what it is that we ordered. Then, after another 10 minutes, we got our appetizers. Not very organized. And, lastly, we didn't know if we were supposed to tip this guy or not. We ended up leaving him something but... it was just bizarre. The restaurant wasn't that busy... why not just have the guy take orders and bring out the food in a conventional manner to stop confusing everyone?"},{"name":"Josie's Pizza & Wings","address":"1225 S Hiawassee Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Josie's is my go to place for a relaxing night out.

The heavy winter weather slowed down the crowd. \\"Table for two please\\". \\"No! Not a booth\\". Pay attention at all points of customer contact. Many patrons had their coats on at their table. Pay attention, it's cold out, and I had to ask you to compensate by turning on the over the door space heaters. \\"One is broken, but I will lock the side doors so only the revolving is used\\",mgr. The decor was clean, eye catching, and not cluttered.  We were promptly greeted by our server, who suggested drinks, and appetizers. There were no specials, only highlighted, feature items. To keep what was in front of us hot, we ordered in sequence. The dinner salad was nice, but small to share. The house Italian dressing was unexceptionable. The plates to share theses items came from the sever station near the door. Side plates were ice cold. Great for the salad, but not the hot items. The baked lasagna was next. (Note... The menu states it is ravioli) the plump cheese ravioli unbalanced the taste for lasagna. Too much ricotta. The meat marinara was very good. Not Diablo enough for me, but most will find it fresh, and zesty with flavor. Of course, unless we were both going to hover over the same baking pan, I was elected to add my portion to the cold plate. My Valentines gift to you sweetheart. Next came the Tavern Cut Brewhouse Classic pizza. We substituted peppers for mushroom, and added extra sauce based on other comments without complaint. The pizza was GREAT! Many around us had the deep dish. The crust was thin and crispy. The pepperoni was so thin that if it was exposed, it crackled like a chip. The sausage was well seasoned, not a breakfast blend. Of course the cheese was stringy(real), with no imitation snap back. My suggestion would be to ask for extra sauce hot on the side. Their recipe is designed to keep the crust crispy throughout. Then came the Salty Carmel Pizookie. There is nothing more indulgent I can say about this, that has not been said before. I would encourage you to remove the chocolate treat except for the chocolate Pizookie. The manager visited our table, and we shared our visit. I did go back inside to tell our manager Bentley that he should consider shoveling the walk, or at least putting down salt.

For the entree, I ordered the grilled whole trout which came with a metal bowl which included instructions on how to de-bone a fish. I grew up eating an entire fish with the head. So I didn't feel I needed the instructions. But it was really useful to have and I was amused by the illustrations demonstrating how to de-bone. The fish was grilled with a lemon herb blend. It also included a side of butter but I didn't feel the need to add that as the fish was nice and moist and very tasty. My husband ordered the salmon which included fresh watercress and potatoes. I had a bite and it was really good! \\n\\nUnfortunately we did not get dessert but they looked tasty from their descriptions.

The seasonal vegetable turned out to be oven roasted broccoli, which was light, crispy, and tasty (I normally don't like broccoli but I really loved this). The smashed potatoes had bacon, sour cream, and scallions, so basically like baked potatoes except smashed - I really loved this too but I think the serving size was a bit too large for us. Finally, we finished off with a dessert each - I had a peach cobbler and she had a strawberry shortcake, both of which were tasty and served as a great end to our meal.\\n\\nWe really enjoyed the ambiance of the private dining area too.

This restaurant has always been our go-to place if we couldn't figure out where to go.  Fast forward a name change, price changes and management changes to today.  My fiance and I decided once again to go to 1+1 because we couldn't pick where to go.  \\n\\nService: I had the 3 choices meal (first page on their menus) with my choices being 2 chicken steaks and 1 rib eye steak on spaghetti.  The manager (or what I suppose is the manager since he's wearing differenrt coloured clothing) takes our order then leaves to enter it in. The food and drinks come rather quickly as in the past but my order came as a 2 choice meal, with one chicken steak and 1 rib eye steak instead.  I immediately tell the waiter that my order is wrong and the manager comes back.  His exact words to me were \\"If you'd like to order a second chicken steak, it will be an extra dollar\\".  He then brought over a menu and pointed out that if I wanted to \\"double up\\" on any of these items, I will have to pay an extra dollar.  I scanned through the menu quickly and ask where this \\"additional dollar\\" clause is located - he had the audacity to tell me that the extra dollar policy on doubling up has always existed and is mentioned no where on their menu.  $1 extra is by means not a big deal in any case; I was more offended by the fact that his tone was so rude and clipped about these supposed \\"facts\\".  Well, and also trying to sell a returning customer his bullshit excuse on why this clause was not mentioned anywhere in their store, amiright?  That ended my experience with this restaurant.  I will not come back after the bullshit they tried to pull last night.

I am always trying to fill my belly with mounds of carbs and fat. Heaven, I tell you) and my friend munched on his chicharrones extremely slowly. \\n\\nHere comes the clincher. We, being relative newcomers to any kind of Latin American food, had no idea what the flour tortilla served with our food was food. So he asked. \\"What is this for? Do I dip it in something?\\"\\n\\nNow, I'm no Spanish speaker myself, but I did take a few years of it in high school, enough to understand the confusion on our waitress's face and her expressive arm gestures: \\"Con....con la comida!\\" With the food?

The As Gouda as it gets was amazing. The blend of flavor a from the cheese, chicken, peppers, and garlic spinach all goes so well together. Very impressed. \\n\\nSo close to 5 stars...

Lobster bisque had great flavor, but was luke warm and only had 3 pieces of lobster. Goat cheese criostini was super underwhelming and blah. Charcuterie plate was great as was the wild berry bread pudding and Irish coffee. The entertainment started at 8 and from the get go I was blown away by Olivia's voice and the house band.

What made the beer taste even better were the complimentary oatcakes that were served along side butter and some pickled veggies.

Just enough raisins and almonds, not too many to tick me off. I would definitely get this again. \\n\\nThe sandwich also came with a side of \\"chips\\" (translation: very well seasoned potato wedges), and was served with a bottle of house made ketchup!

The caesar salad was also great, with white anchovies, a zesty dressing, and buttery, homemade croutons.\\n\\nI wasn't as thrilled with the kobe beef sandwich.  It was essentially a roast beef sandwich, but there was a great deal more fat on the meat than I like.

It's nearly impossible to find a place that has good service, not much of a wait (if any), and delicious food. Since the A is a home for budding foodies, I've felt like we've had to make one if not more of those sacrifices. \\n\\nCandi's was a Scout mob deal and it also came HIGHLY recommended. It's hidden in the Market where Jake's Ice Cream is, and there is no huge sign outside--which is probably best so as to keep it a hidden spot!  You walk in and there are random seating arrangements everywhere, two counters with cash registers and either a kitchen behind one or an ice cream glass freezer and cafe behind the other. But we were sat (right away!) in what may have been rollover seating from the dining area and in the cafe. Cute old tables and couches are surrounded by bookshelves bursting at the seams. It was very relaxed and easy....my kind of place.  Bonus since no matter where you go for breakfast/brunch there will be a wait. Our waiter was also very friendly and helpful. \\n\\nThere was big talk of their Stuffed Biscuits, but the menu said to allow about 25 minutes for that prep and we were ravenous. Only to find out when we were leaving, the cashier said they don't actually take that long and we better order them next time....no problemo! I got the Not So Southern Eggs Benedict, which is the original with the sauce and egg but added tomato and pesto and ham on their huge and fluffy biscuit. I'm not a big biscuit person, but Candi's lived up to the hype. My man got the veggie omelet with a side of grits and it was all superb. \\n\\nI'm a HUGE fan of this spot and can't wait to go back for those stuffed biscuits everyone raves about.

The asparagus and cucumber salad rolls were not as interesting in taste as you would expect. I could not tell that there even was asparagus in the rolls.

We found several places and walked into Urban Flats(which our hotel had recommended) and specifically asked what time the restaurant closed at, since it was 6 p.m. and we wanted to go back to the hotel, shower and come back for dinner later. The host told us they closed at 10 p.m. so we left for the hotel. \\n\\nWe arrived back at the restaurant at about 9 p.m., and the same exact guy who had spoken with us, told us they were closed. We couldn't believe it and when we told him \\" You are the one who told us that you are open till 10\\", he said \\" Oh yes, we are open\\". \\n\\nFrom that point on, it was a disaster. The server walked over and told us they only served flat breads starting at 9 p.m. and they were out of most wines in the wine list. The cooks messed up our order and had to bring us two separate orders of the flat breads. \\n\\nNeedless to say, I am never visiting an Urban Flats restaurant again.\\nI felt sorry for the waitress so I left 10% but really shouldn't have left any tip for the service we received."},{"name":"Do At The View","address":"955 W Marietta St NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"I really wish the night hadn't ended so badly, otherwise I would have given do four stars.\\n\\nThis place is not that easy to find.  If you know your way around King Plow, you might be fine.  But if you aren't familiar with the area and it's dark, you might miss it (which I did).  So I had to turn around and go back.\\n\\nOnce there, the valets were very nice and I found the service to be good from the moment I entered.  I enjoyed the decor - it feels more like a lounge than a pizza joint.  The white sofas were comfy to me and I also enjoyed the iPad ordering.  I also loved the fact that we could choose (or at least vote on) the music we wanted to hear.  \\n\\nI had bruschetta, which was yummy.  It was more of a \\"pizza-like\\" bruschetta with melted cheese than \\"nice Italian restaurant\\" bruschetta.  I had the Maestro pizza, which featured garlic cream sauce and shrimp.  Loved it.  I could've eaten another one.  The pizza was not huge, but honestly, do I really need it to be bigger?  Nope.  For a drink, I had the strawberry lemonade and that was disappointing.  Very watered down tasting.\\n\\nAll that said, let me know tell you why I may not ever return to do at The View (at least not with MY car).  The valet processes at the end of my visit were awful.  I don't think they've figured out how to sync the check out process with the valet process.  We were told when to indicate that we needed our cars via the iPad.  You put in the valet ticket number and your car would be waiting for you.  Seems like a good idea right?  It wasn't.\\n\\nBut we did the valet thingie right before we paid and it took a loooong time to pay.  And I really thought we requested our cars too early, but the system seems to take you through that process when you check out and it didn't seem like we had a choice.\\n\\nIt took a long time to pay because we had to figure out how we would split our checks four ways.  So for example, if you have a party of seven people, you can't split the check seven ways, but you can split it four - so you will have to figure out how you want to divide it, add it up, etc. and THEN once you do that, you have to wait for the server to come back.  Basically, if you go with a group, bring your calculators and expect to do a lot of work.\\n\\nSeriously.  If I'm paying to eat outside of my house, I'm not really trying to work.  If I'm going to work, I'll do that at home and make my own food.\\n\\nThey REALLY need to improve the check out process.  So it took us a long time to get the bill squared away.\\n\\nAnd when we went back outside, our cars were waiting for us.  And cars were waiting for others too.  And people were in cars trying to valet.  It was a parking lot nightmare right in front of the door.  Packed.  Think gridlock and cars everywhere.  AND, many of the cars that were waiting for people were completely unmanned, with the key in the ignition and the door unlocked.  So nearly all of my large party was able to get in their cars and drive away with no one checking the valet stub.\\n\\nSo essentially, the valets retrieved our cars and left them, unprotected, in front of the building.  ANYONE could have driven off with those cars.\\n\\nMy friend's car was at the \\"beginning\\" of the line of cars.  So her car was outside of the gate near the sidewalk - anyone on the street could have gotten in and driven away.  The valets were running around like crazy trying to keep up with the flow of traffic coming in and those leaving.  They were so busy, they didn't even notice me get into my car and drive away.  No one ever asked me for my valet stub to verify that it was my car.  \\n\\nBottom-line - do really needs to fix the pay, check out, and valet processes.  I would not feel safe valeting my car here.

If she's too lazy to make the fish or if they're not getting that machine fixed, they should really just call it, \\"Generic, Overly-Priced-For-What-It-Is Burritos\\".

But when experiencing a restaurant for the first time, and having such an atrocious combination of service, food, and service (I say it twice, as it was THAT bad), I have to put my foot down.  A friend took me out for dinner for my birthday, and I had always wanted to try Ms. B's.  It looked promising.  It was a Saturday and the place was bustling.  There was a three piece jazz ensemble playing, which was great by the way, and the atmosphere seemed good.  We didn't have reservations, but were seated fairly promptly by the door.  I ordered one of the \\"specialty drinks,\\" which I remember was fairly good, albeit a little on the sweet side.  We ordered appetizers which were just alright, and upon ordering a second drink, I had a special request, which was sweet tea and Tito's vodka, a Texas twist on an old Buffalo favorite (where I grew up, generally speaking).  This is where things started going sideways.  My drink was a simple enough request.  Let's just say that I never got it.  Ever.  The whole two plus hours I was there.  And I had the wait staff check on it at least three times.  I don't understand what the problem was, and it was never quite explained to me.  I think I ended up settling for a glass of wine.  My companion and I had ordered the Cajun seafood platter for two, which we waited, no exaggeration, over an hour for, and to our dismay, it consisted entirely of soggy, rubbery fried seafood.  And it had sat under heat lamps for at least 40 minutes.  There is NO EXCUSE for this.  I have worked in every aspect of the restaurant industry, from dishwasher to chef to caterer to bus person, and there is no excuse at all.  Yes it was busy.  The waitress apologized for the meal not being ready when my companion clearly saw it sitting under heat lamps for another 40 minutes after this point.  I may give this establishment one more chance, but based on my experience, there is really no reason to.  You can never take back a first impression.

There's a large bar along the right side of the space, a few rows of booths in the middle of the space, then tables and some more booths on the left side of the space. It's a very cool environment - they've got the whole exposed ceiling thing going on, as well as nice hardwood floors and brick walls (I suppose giving the \\"brewhouse\\" feeling?) The light is a bit low, but there are lots of windows. There are HDTVs here and there firmly dedicated to ESPN and live sports broadcasts. Overall it's a nice environment, but not some place you would dress up to go to. \\n\\nThe Service: Every time I've been to BJ's I've been seated pretty quickly, even during the dinner rush. My servers have been hit or miss, but MOSTLY \\"hit.\\" No real complaints here (save one server who seemed to be in a bad mood and in a rush to get away from our table). \\n\\nThe Food: The menu is HUGE. I've had a meat loaf dish and some burgers. People I've been with have had all sorts of sandwiches, salads, soups, pizza and potatoes. (Note: the potatoes are one of BJ's unique specialties - they are HUGE baked potatoes stuffed with things such as chicken, chili and veggies). This is a great place to bring a group because of the large menu - there's someone for everyone, and everyone I've been here with has been very pleased with their meal. It's good, quality food. \\n\\nThe Drinks: this is where BJ's really shines in my mind. They've got seven BJ's beers on tap, as well as others that rotate in and out seasonally. The beers always on tap are: BJ's Brewhouse Blonde (malty and very light), Harvest Hefeweizen (typical wheat - spicy/fruity), Piranha Pale Ale (very HOPPY), BJ's Jeremiah Red (typical Irish red - smooth taste with great malty/fruity taste), BJ's P.M. Porter (dark, chocolatety ale in the Guinness vein), Tatonka Stout (imperial stout - dark as midnight), Nutty Brewnette (brown, nutty ale). I've had them all either in sampler form (either four 6 oz. glasses or six 4 oz. glasses) or as full pints. My favorites are the Jeremiah Red and the Piranha Pale Ale - which are both delicious - but I've enjoyed them all. \\n\\nThe Price:\\nMiddle of the road. BJ's is more expensive then the Applebees, Ruby Tuesdays and T.G.I. Friday's of the world, but it's also a much nicer place. I can't remember the exact prices of many of the dishes, but I'd estimate an average of $11-20 for a meal for one and a drink or two. \\n\\nThe Bottom Line:\\nEverything about BJ's is solid. The building is nice, the staff is good, the food is varied, high quality and well-prepared, the beer is AWESOME ... in short, what's there to complain about? I knocked off one star because I favor non-chain restaurants.

This time, however, was exceptionally bad. Came here on Christmas day not expecting much because lets be honest, who wants to work on Christmas and who wants to be the guy eating there, making them have to work on Christmas. Anyway, came with a family of 6 for dinner and upon calling ahead, was informed that the full menu would be served. When we arrived we were informed that it was only an enchilada buffet tonight. No big deal, take what you can get. From the start our server was VERY slow getting to the table to even take a drink order. Again, not that big of a deal. We proceed to hit up the buffet, which was destroyed. 1 or 2 enchiladas left here and there so we took what we could get and continued on. Once we finished what little we had, we waited for the line to be restocked. After 15-20 minutes we realized we were probably out of luck. Mind you, the waiter still has not returned to the table to refill any of the waters or at least to get us liquored up so we wouldn't know the difference. I really could care less about slow service and am pretty easy to please as I have worked all positions in the service industry, but when its a serve yourself buffet and all you have to do is take care of drinks, you need to be far more attentive to what little you have to do. Overall a very poor experience. I will say that we still tipped the waiter over 20% because its Christmas and thats just what you do. Who knows, maybe the guy got divorced that day. This experience will not stop me from giving El Arroyo another chance but management needs to do some serious quality control to prevent things like this from happening again. El Arroyo, we will meet again another day. Best of luck."},{"name":"Beth's Burger Bar","address":"5145 S Orange Ave","city":"Edgewood","stars":"4","text":"Wonderful burger joint in town.

The waitress offered to substitute a 6 oz filet (not on menu).  I said 6 oz is a long way from 16 oz and she said she would give me two.  Wife decided to get a dinner Caesar salad/with grilled chicken.  Which was ok.  The two filet or whatever they were were horrible stringy 'some kind of meat'.  Now to top it off I was charged for two filets one at $19.00 and one at $16.00 (now the substitution I was offered is $35.00).  We had one soft drink and one tea , had no refills and was charged for 2 soft drinks and 2 teas. We thought, oh well,  just a bad night.  WRONG!! We tried it again 3 nights later and it was worse.

I loooove the food. The Little Piston is probably the best sandwich...ever. No exaggeration here! They have great tea and coffees as well. The pastries are usually quite good...some of them are a bit iffy, but I usually like them. The staff is also wonderful and completely accommodating!\\n\\nAs for the vibe, I personally like it. I know that many people feel it is pretentious, but I find it cozy and interesting. Most of the other diners are just as kind/unkind as any other diners at any other cafe! Makes for good people watching as well.\\n\\nMy one issue is the seating. I really, really don't appreciate seeing one person sitting in a booth on their laptop for hours and hours on end, just sipping away at a coffee. It is rude to take away a spot where couples, friends, and large families would like to sit and actually EAT FOOD, instead placing them in tiny cramped tables. Worse, I've had to stand up and actually wait for a long time (30 minutes at the most), food and drink in hand and friends in tow, just to get a table while every booth is taken up by people with laptops and no food.\\n\\nThe staff should really put a limit on how much time people can spend in a booth, and maybe they should go a step further and make booths only available to parties of 2 or more...who have ordered food!

It's mostly a cross-section of Boston, with its share of tourists, business people entertaining clients, upscale suburban couples in the city for an evening, families out for special occasions, maybe some Beacon Hill \\"types\\"--not the real thing, just \\"types\\"--and young adults who've mistaken Stephanie's for the Armani Cafe.  One summer afternoon last year, I saw the son of the guy who runs my local convenience store lunching on the patio, along with his girlfriend and--I assume--her parents.  He was dressed all in his young casual best (open-collared blue dress shirt and off-white chino cargo pants) and obviously trying to give a good impression.  I decided not to embarrass him and I'm still proud of my discretion.\\n\\nI like the menu, which some describe \\"as comfort food grown-up.\\"  The lobster casserole, mac and cheese, and chicken pot pie are excellent.  The spinach and artichoke appetizer is the best and the deserts are yummy although dinner at Stephanie's is often sans dessert for me.  I prefer to spend an hour wandering Newbury street digesting and then go to Finale for dessert.  I know . . . it's disgustingly--shamefully--yuppie but my dates think it's \\"classy.\\"  I really should start dating women my own age.\\n\\nStephanie's dining and bar areas are spacious and comfortable.  If you show up on a Thursday, Friday, or Saturday night, you'll probably need reservations although several times, my friends and I just hung out at the bar until the hostess found room for us.  Oh yes, there are \\"beautiful young people\\" but when they give us the \\"who let *them* in\\" look, we just mock them mercilessly.  We probably make more money than they get from their parents and in our age of t-shirts, jeans, sneakers, and outlet malls, the days when you could tell socio-economic class from clothing are long gone.\\n\\nI don't understand the perception that the staff is stuck-up or the idea that you need an LV bag (although I confess that I don't know what an \\"LV bag\\" is) to be treated decently.  I think those comments say more about the insecurity of certain yelpers than they do about Stephanie's.  In all the time I've gone to Stephanie's, I remember attitude and bad service twice (once on New Year's Eve) and a mediocre meal only once.  Everyone's entitled to an off night.  Stephanie's on Newbury is a solid restaurant, it's not part of an upscale chain (take *that* Morton's and Palm), and it has a mostly-great menu. Yes, it's on the foofy side but it's not super-trendy.  It's pricey but not in a mortgage-your-children's-future kind of way.  \\n\\nAnd speaking of children, Stephanie's does not provide crayons, coloring books, or kids' menus.  That's not to say I don't see families with children but parents who take their children to Stephanie's raise children who know how to behave themselves in public.  That's the best!\\n\\nStephanie's has been around for years and to me, at least, it hasn't gone stale.  If I have any complaints, it's about the size of the portions.  I've said this before and I'll say it with my dying breath: No one needs so much food!  Why can't restaurants serve meals people can finish?  I don't like wasting food but unless I'm going directly home, which is rare, I'm not going to schlep leftovers around, either.  Small is Beautiful, people!  Less is More!  Argh . . .

My bf & I were meeting four friends for dinner reservations at 8. We arrived first and sat at the bar to wait. Before we had a chance to order a drink, the bartender pushes a pink cocktail toward us and says \\"I made a mistake on this one, does anyone want it?\\" I happily accepted. I've heard their cocktails are great and thought trying it was preferable to his dumping it. I never guessed he'd charge me for it! When our table was ready, I asked to close out and was shocked to see his \\"mistake\\" on the receipt. I pushed the half-finished drink back and said I didn't want his mistake that bad and to remove it from my bill. \\n\\nOur party sat down at a pretty, sizable hardwood table. I was ready to forget the bartender's poor form, and settled into the task of ordering. First of all, the menu is really limited. I turned it over to see if there was more--nothing; and it's essentially just appetizers and rolls. So don't go if you're hungry. You'll get something tiny and precious. Delicious, but tiny and precious.\\n\\nSecondly, you'll wait a really long time for your tiny precious food: we ordered around 8:15 and didn't see the first plate of food until ten. TEN. By 10:30 two of our party had still not received any of their order. And it wasn't remotely busy.\\n\\nThe third problem, related to the wait, was the staging. The food came out so piecemeal that at any given time only one of our party of six was eating, with those who hadn't yet received their food staring hungrily on. I don't care if there's a warning on the menu, this is ridiculous. And surprising in such a competitive food scene. Granted, Micah Camden is just competing with himself on this street. \\n\\nFinally, they forgot the roll I ordered. Not much to say there. Just stupid.\\n\\nOne positive note is how apologetic our server was.

The hits include, but are not limited to, the following:\\n\\nFrench fries - consistently crispy, which I find rare for a delivery place\\nCalzones - huge portions and hearty fillings.  The small is large enough to split between two people for lunch, no problem.\\nSalads - fresh, crisp lettuce and a decent amount of peppers, tomatoes, onions and jalapeos.  There's also a good amount of topping if you get something other than the garden salad.  The only downside is that the pita bread is flat and tasteless.\\nHamburgers - cooked medium unless you specify otherwise, the burgers are tasty and come on a big, fluffy bun.  They also use shredded lettuce and diced pickles on the burgers, which makes me very happy.\\nChicken wings - nice and crisp, they've got a nice seasoning to them.\\nChicken fingers - these things are massive!  They're nice and juicy though, all white meat, and the breading is always nice and crisp.  They also have a good selection of dipping sauces.\\nThe infamous Captain AK's Plate - this is probably only infamous at my house, but it's basically $17 worth of fried seafood, fries, and cole  slaw.  The seafood includes clam strips and whole clams, scallops, shrimp and fish.  \\n\\nThe not so great:\\n\\nThe pizza - the crust is thick and chewy, although the toppings, as with the calzones, are plentiful.\\nThe pulled rib sandwiches - over-sauced, and has wayyy too many bits of hard fat in there.\\nThe cold subs - they just can't seem to get the toppings right, ever.  So frustrating.  Also, the bread on the cold subs tend to be hard, although if you get a toasted one, it's okay.\\n\\nAll in all, a decent place, with what seems to be rising prices.

I loved the food, the vibe, and the chef playing his playlist of Italian Hits. When I took my family there they all lived it, Mom loves the 50s-60s era music and the piping hot food. I wish they hadn't changed. I have ordered take out about 4 times since and dined in once. The number for dining in would have been 3 if   The first few weeks they opened the large place weren't so chaotic for them. 2 hour wait both times. Mind you it was not packed in there, the kitchen couldn't keep up with the grand opening crowd. \\n\\nTo get back on track, I loved this place. Now the chef that used to play his music is no longer there. Since he has left, the food has been noticeably worse. Which I hate because of how I used to rave about this place. The chef in the small restaurant had an eye for detail. For instance, when I used to order chicken parm out, it would be nice crisp chicken cutlets, tenderized thin, but getting two huge pieces. Pasta was cooked perfectly to chew. Even the cheese was crisped a bit to get those delicious browned bits of cheese on top. \\n\\nThis last order out today, the phone was left off the hook for an hour so I drove by. And to cut it short I ordered there, didnt wait long, but got a thick half of a chicken breast, over breaded, with sliced mozzarella on top that they threw on At the end. The sauce changed so much too. I loved the sauce before. Now ehhh. \\nPlease!!! Make up with the older Chef. And that would make many of the customers who frequent your restaurant very happy. He knew how to cook! Id hate to see more of these reviews multiply.

I also ordered a Bloody Mary. They have a little checklist so you can have it done however you please! Lots of options for the garnish, though adding too many of the options can make it really expensive, since many cost $1-4 each. It starts out at $12, though, so if you're happy with the basics, it's not too ridiculous of a price for a drink. I ordered mine with the Stephanie's famous mix, old bay seasoning on the rim, house vodka, and bacon (+$1), celery, a dill pickle spear, and olives for the garnish. It was quite good! I was happy with my choice. \\n\\nHowever, I was a little underwhelmed by my dish. For $21, I would have expected more. It tasted like it had been sitting under a warming lamp for a long time. The ham was kind of rubbery and the cheese on the biscuits and potatoes congealed pretty quickly. The biscuits were also quite stale. I normally would've sent the dish back, but I didn't feel like making a big deal about it. \\n\\nWe also got monkey bread for the table to start and that tasted a little stale to me too. I would've expected it to be more dense and fluffy, but it was too crumbly for my taste. \\n\\nMy family enjoyed their food, at least. The second best plate was my mom's lobster Benedict. But for $30, it better be a knock-out. I had a taste of it and it was just alright. The lobster was flavorless and the mustard hollandaise was too overpowering. I was expecting more. \\n\\nThe service was decent but nothing out of this world. Overall, I thought the food here was pretty subpar for the price (which is expensive).

I know Winflo can't control this but at least provide some bug spray...Lots of other places in Austin do.  I asked our server for some and she said \\"it was against health code\\".

Soups, plates, and authentic Central American-style enchiladas (which resemble Mexican tostadas more than Mexican enchiladas). I went for the seafood stew and boy did I pick wisely. I was warned that it would be a 20 min wait because it's made to order, but it was totally worth it. Perfectly balanced seafood broth, loads of seafood including tender caracol, squid, clams, mussels, octopus, fish, and half a lobster for that Boston twist. It's been a while since I've had caracol (sea conch) and it hit the spot. It's not easy to make it so tender, but it was perfect here. \\n\\nSome nice rice on the side (or better yet added into the soup) and some thick Salvadorian tortillas (also better added into the soup) rounded up a perfect meal. \\n\\nStrongly recommended. Deviate from the burritos (which might be good too!) and you will be handsomely rewarded with some authentic and great tasting Central American comfort food."},{"name":"Shabu & Mein","address":"148 1st St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Great flavors.

GF ordered combo Beef Teriyaki, Tempora, Gyoza.\\nMy chicken arrived with a pile of greasy shredded cabbage, that I supposed was supposed to be stir fried. Inedible. The chicken was breast meat, charred to the point that all I could taste was carbon (although there was a fair amount of moisture left). On it's own I wouldn't eat it, but in addition it was drowning in what tasted like carmel colored corn syup, but it was supposed to be teriyaki sauce. Inedible. The rice was well cooked, however.\\nThe GF shared bites of her plate. The tempora was very heavily battered, and the various bites were essentially flavorless. Not too greasy, just bland and unappealing. She gave me one of the shrimp, which was fat and impressive until I peeled off the batter to expose a chop stick diameter shrimp. The rest was just bland an unappealing.  Her teriyaki beef was as excessively charred as my chicken, and also swimming in that sickeningly sweet syrup they called teriyaki sauce. The gyoza were ok, if a bit mass-produced in texture and flavor.\\nAfter a few repusive bites, I pushed my plate aside. The waitress (not our actual server) that picked up my plate asked me if I wanted a box, to which I replied \\"HELL No!\\". She picked up the plate, without comment or concern with the fact that I'd hardly touched the food. No expression of concern, no apology, no offer to take the dreck off the ticket.

Got back to the office with my to-go cesar salad and the dressing was a disgusting congealed lump of grease.

It is like a do-it at your house (or apartment) burger, but they let you stack on whatever you want for not extra cost!  The bad is that the burger tends to get pretty greasy and soggy...but then again sometimes you are in the mood for this!\\n\\nThe Fries:  Cajun or lightly salted the come.  The Cajun are awesomely good...not too much salt on these, as I had to add some to get that savory feeling, but they are really actually pretty crisp and tasty.

Some other reviewers have compared it to Bo Bo Garden on Buford Hwy., even saying Bo Bo's dish was better.  However, in my opinion, Canton Cook II's squid beats Bo Bo Garden by a long shot.

The staff are knowledgeable about the menu and preparations in a very laid back way.  The space is somewhat confusing to me - not sure if the exposed beams are to give a rustic feel, but the neon sign glaring in the dining room blows that theory away.
