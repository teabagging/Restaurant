That's all. LOL.After a grueling 5mile hike, my friend and I came here for some ramen and hand rolls. The Tokyo Ramen that we ordered (not happy hour price) was large enough to be split into two was pretty tasty. The broth was pretty good but a little oily. The noodles weren't a fave (I've had better noodles) nor were the few pieces of meat we were given. Our faves were definitely the handrolls, especially the spicy tuna. The avo-salmon and avo-tuna were good combos but the spicy tuna was very flavorful and not stingy on sashimi pieces. I also ordered a grilled salmon belly that was pretty great! Overall service and ambience was really nice. The staff worked to try to get us seated right away and the bar was a good place to sit because there's a projector above and you can watch TV.

They have old authentic Mexican music playing in the background to add to the ambiance and a selection of lemonades ready to be poured on the counter. The menu is riddled with spelling errors and bad grammar but it adds to the authenticity and charm in my opinion. You have to buy chips and salsa (they don't come free like in some places) but the chips are home made so $2 for them is a good deal. The lunch specials are about $10 and come on huge plates, I could only eat half my food. I'm a weenie when it comes to spicy food- so my mouth was on fire. My husband didn't taste anything spicy on his food so if you're tolerant to hot spices you'll be fine. Grab an authentic glass bottle coke to top off the meal. This place was nice, we'll be back.

Yep, it's the sauce that's the hook.  And it may also be the brown rice/quinoa base.  Or the large/small dish option.

Usually I try to find a new (to me) place that's nearby where I can sit down, have dinner, and read a book on my Kindle for a bit.Today was one of those days.I was browsing Yelp for new places to try and Taste of Yucatan came up. Reading the reviews and looking at some of the pics, I was certainly intrigued. I checked the map and it was a little further out than I typically go adventuring for one of these nights (I live like a mile down the road from UCF), but the simple menu with a decent array of meats to try was just calling out to me.Like other people have mentioned in other reviews, the restaurant is normally pretty open inside. When I walked in, there was one couple that must have gotten there shortly before I did, and by the time I was leaving, a couple of ladies came in. This place needs more customers, and they deserve it!Since I'd seen their menu online, I was already pretty set on what I wanted to order. Started with a regular taco al pastor (with pineapple), salbute pibil (Mayan taco + Mayan pork), and a panucho barbacoa (panucho is just the fried tortilla of the salbute with a layer of mashed black beans on it).You take a seat and your order is ready in typically 5'ish minutes, where you just walk up to the counter and pick it up.At the counter is a sauce bar with a few different things. They have your usual things that you'd expect to find in a taqueria such as pico, cilantro, crema, lime wedges, onions, habanero sauce, and red and green sauces. Additionally, they had pickled onions which had an extra bit of flavor by having sour orange added to their pickling juice, tamarind and mango habanero sauces, and a chipotle crema.I'm the kind of guy that doesn't like to do too much on a taco. I think they should be simple foods with only a couple of additional things added. Each taco I added a bit of onions (pickled onions for the Mayan combo), cilantro, and then mixed up the sauces on the tacos. One had the regular red sauce, one the chipotle crema, and the other the plain crema.The al pastor taco with pineapple was simple enough. Not anything to write home about, but it was good. Next up I tried the barbacoa. Once again, the meat was flavorful, it wasn't dry, and the tortilla had a little bit of a crispness from being fried, but not to the point of being brittle and falling apart when you begin to eat.Lastly, I bit into the Mayan taco. I swear to you the angels must have been singing from heaven when I took that first bite. The Mayan pork was flavorful and juicy. I had read on the menu that the pork is also marinated in sour orange (which I will never say no to), and once again the Mayan tortilla had a nice little crispness that made it such a joy to eat. I've seen other comments that mentions that there is a lot of grease dripping from this taco, and, while it is drippy, I really don't believe it is grease. Greasiness will last on your fingers and even after you wipe away, there's that residue that lingers that doesn't allow you to feel clean. This does not do that.I sat at the table reading a bit more, savoring that final taco, and then decided that I enjoyed it so much I needed to go back and order another one. Hell, I could have ordered 10 more of them. I ordered another Mayan taco and then also ordered a carnitas taco (we're now at 5 tacos, people!).My wife isn't a fan of spice, so my palette for spicy food has dwindled considerably in 12 years that we've been together. The guy working at the cashier said that if I didn't want something overly spicy, the habanero would be a pretty good choice. I added habanero to my carnitas, but kept the Mayan one pretty similar...just swapping out the crema for the red sauce again.Thankfully I did not overdo it with the habanero on the carnitas as it certainly hit the right amount of spice I needed. Habanero had a nice flavor, a small heat that built up just enough for me, and it didn't overstay its welcome.Once more, I saved my Mayan Miracle for last with no regrets. I walked out of Taste of Yucatan a happy man (who also finished his book!), and looking forward to my next visit there.Please go there! Enjoy their food, and keep this place alive!

The place is very eye catching with a wall of oyster shells in cages.  The worn in wood all over walls gave a cozy feeling to this modern twist on a seafood shack.  We dined on every local oyster (Island Creek, Rocky Nook, Drunken Meadow, Wild Marion, Chatham, Moon Shoal, Moon Stone and Belon) and some local little neck clams to start.  They also served us some house made bread with I think honey butter.  Both the butter and bread were really good.  Then came the razor clams with tasso ham parsley and garlic.  These were roasted to perfection.  And we also each got an oyster slider on a home made brioche roll with a hint of lime chile a√Øoli.  If you get anything on the menu oyster related and are or aren't into raw oysters, this should be a definite must have.  For our main courses we shared the Lobster Roe Pasta and the Crab Pasta.  The lobster roe pasta had braised short rib, grilled lobster, brown beech mushrooms, and Pecorino cheese.  The crab pasta had Pecorino and shaved truffles with lots of crab.  The crab pasta was a little lighter than expected, but the lobster roe pasta dish was off the charts spectacular. A note to the service.  It was amazing.

I'm guessing it's because the weather was really crappy (nasty rain). I had looked at the menu online before going, so I knew what I wanted. I ordered the chicken parm sandwich (which was a solid $14!) and it was ready just a few minutes later.The sandwich was to go and I walked the 3 minutes back to my office. First impression - MESSY AS HELL! There was cheese and sauce everywhere, so I was trying very hard not to get it everywhere. Luckily, my office mate was out of town, so I could chow down on the sloppy sandwich in peace. The taste... delicious! It was hot, saucy and cheesy. AND HUGE! I had to fight an epic battle with my stomach to finish it (I ate all the chicken and mossst of the bread, so I call that a win). The breaded chicken was literally falling out of the sandwich because there was so much of it. Again, very saucy, but it didn't make the sandwich soggy. The cheese was plentiful and quite tasty. To be honest, I'm not sure that I'm going to be able to eat dinner later!I also bought a cookie, which was a whopping $3.78 or something like that. Very expensive for your average oatmeal raisin from a sandwich shop.

Note, that only applies to a hummus gyro which is the cheapest actual meal on the menu.  Most plates will cost you closer to $10 or more (possibly quite a bit more).  However, overall, the food is pretty good and I do plan to drop in again at some point to give it another go.As the name explains, the food served here is mostly Greek in its origins.  However, there's no pastitsio or moussaka here.  Instead, the menu is very heavy on seafood, notably calamari which can be ordered as an appetizer or a full meal. Of course, there are also an array of gyros, filling and fluffy, served with chips, and likely a huge favorite with the college kids.  The overall clientele, though, is very mixed.  The night I went, I saw people from all walks of life and all stages.Old movie posters make up the main decorations on the otherwise neutral walls.  The bar, taking up the back of the space, is dark and comfortable.   Service is just fine - there were a lot of servers on duty the night I went, and I didn't have to wait long at all for food (though I did stand at the front of the restaurant by the 'wait to be seated' sign before someone said to sit where I wanted...)Of course, the most important aspect of a review concerns the food...The night I went, I decided to be a bit \\"bad\\" and try a couple things on the menu.  Thus, I started out with avegolemono (chicken lemon rice soup).  An old favorite of mine, I was a bit put off by the first rather metallic-flavored bites.  However, after a few more spoonfuls the flavor grew on me.  Creamier if a bit less tart than some versions I've had, it was a nice way to start off the meal.The gyro was the star of the show - a massive wrap made out of super soft and fluffy pita bread and filled with tasty pieces of meat, fresh veggies, and sauce.  Like most gyros, it suffered the problem that comes with the style of cooking and addition of cold veggies to hot meat - that is to say that parts of the sandwich, especially the tips of the meat, were lukewarm even after letting it sit a few moments in its tinfoil coat.  However, the bread in particular was impressive and very filling.  The chips it came with were alright too - nice crunch and flavor.To round off my gluttony, I did order one of the desserts as well, opting for a galaktobouriko - phyllo pastry soaked in what I think is honey and maybe orange-blossom water.  It has hot vanilla custard inside and is topped with cinnamon (and I think more honey).  Though this sounds absolutely amazing, the end result was...well... okay.  There wasn't much flavor overall - it tasted strangely ...muted...  the custard inside was only noticeable in a couple bites, too.  Most of the time, my fork only brought up sticky phyllo dough. My suggestion would likely be to stick to the baklava.  I've never had bad baklava anywhere :)Overall, I will probably come back, especially if Opa continues to put out coupons.

Most of the staff - Italian.  TV over the bar - playing cheesy Italian TV that bordered on the ridiculous at times.  Accordion player too?  That's amore!We were not disappointed.  I had the pizzaiola, adding the homemade pappardelle pasta.  I am a thick cut noodle expert, and I must say that the pappardelle here was perfect - slightly dense, perfect amount of chewiness, not heavy or overcooked.  The beef in the pizzaiola was thin cut and perfectly cooked, coated in a super-garlicky spicy and slightly sweet marinara sauce.  My wife had Gino's favorite - kinda carbonara esque linguine with prosciutto, stirred egg and parm.  Also delicious!My only gripe (and its a really minor one) is that the friggin balsamic they bring out for dipping bread is at the bottom of a 1 inch layer of olive oil.

Located in a strip hopping center, at the corner of Highlands Ridge and the East-West Connector, alongside Subway, Waffle House, and a Thai Restaurant (I think named Curry Curry).Years later I now work for a company located very close to this location. Johnny's is not the closest pizza joint near my office. Nor does it have the best pizza of all the pizza joints near my office. But this place is solid. Very good / solid generously portioned pizza. Good beer selection. Good service with cute waitresses. Inviting interior layout with small but cozy, clean, and new(ish) looking bar area. I ordered the slice of pizza that had Italian sausage, peperoni, Canadian bacon onion, mushroom, onion and green pepper. Can't remember the name (either Johnny's Special or Italian Special). Generous slice sizing and generous topping. It was pretty good; comparable to a Fellini's Special slice. Also got a salad with (single serving package of) blue cheese dressing. and a single serving package of crackers. Very average salad if not outright underwhelming. Also got a coke to wash it all down; perfectly carbonated with right amount of ice in a large plastic glass. The bill came out to about ten bucks and change. But I was satisfied with my order.Since this is the second closest pizza place near my office I will likely be back often. I am a fan.

I went with a group of four and we all go different ramen soups. I tried each one and loved them all. Personally I ordered the Miso Ramen which ended up being my favorite of the four so that was lucky. The broth was rich and bursting with flavor while the noodles were perfectly cooked and firm, not flimsy like \\"top ramen\\" noodles. It came with a nice sized slice of seared pork that was excellent and the server asked if I wanted to add an egg to my soup, which of course, I did. Great recommendation. Also, one of our party ordered the chicken wing appetizer, (seems like a random choice for a ramen place I know) and they were some of the best chicken wings I have ever had.

The 8 oz bottles of batter are $6.50 each and the toppings range from $1-$3. They offer vegan and gluten free batters. We got 2 buttermilk bottles, blueberries, chocolate chips, hazelnuts, and whipped cream. We also ordered some items from their brunch menu. The forest mushroom scramble($10) was delicious. The biscuits and gravy($4) portion was smaller than anticipated, but tasty. We also ordered a side of Bacon($3). My girls thought this place was absolutely magical. They had so much fun making and dressing their own pancakes. We found that the smaller, thinner  pancakes cooked better. We made letters, flowers and bears without problems but big round pancakes loaded with toppings tended to stick and they took forever to cook. Our server, Stephanie S., was fantastic! She did a great job of explaining everything to us and she was very attentive. The pancakes were good, but they were just pancakes. You go for the experience here and it's a great one. A must if you have kiddos! As we left around 11:15 we overheard the host tell a family it would be a 1 1/2 hour wait, so get there early if you go. I've heard that 8:00 and 2:00 are the best times to go on the weekends. I only give 4 stars because of the wait time, but they handled it really well. If we went again we would probably stick to just pancakes and experiment with a bunch of different toppings. Our total for this trip was $47 before tip. This included what is listed above and 4 beverages. I would definitely recommend."},{"name":"Moonshine Patio Bar & Grill","address":"303 Red River St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Brunch!Well, where do i start!  The morning wait was crazy, it was like a 40 minute wait (outside patio on the less boring side).  We were seated outside, taken to a table that was for two, but the problem is that it was 3 of us, and they simply pulled up a chair at a small table; NOT!  We immediately requested another table, and were sat in less than 5 minutes at a table for 4; much better!The ambiance was really nice, no complaints there.  Our waiter was on point, and i have not one complaint about him.  He immediately came over, introduced himself, took our drinks orders, and was prompt with refills, etc.  He gave us our plates, and told us to go at, etc.  The food was pretty good, well, what i had was pretty good.  There could've been better food, but i played it safe, and only really focused on the ham, french toast, biscuits, potatoes, and onion spread.  I don't know, maybe they deserve four stars, but for that wait, i just can't.  I think the price $15 was respectable.  I would definitely revisit this spot, and hope to report back with a higher rating."},{"name":"Maizal RMF","address":"2815 Main Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4.5","text":"Since discovering this place a few weeks ago, I have been here 3 times with my taco-aficionado bf/friends and Maizal has always served. If you think Tacofino is good...you need to come here and have your mind blown. They make their own corn tortillas in front of you and toast them on the griddle. They have no grittiness and become the perfect backbones for the various taco fillings. So far, we have only tried the majority of the tacos, the Horchata drink, and the churro. For the tacos, we rank our top three as Carnitas, Pescado (fish), and Pastor. If you come here, you HAVE to try at least the first two tacos. - The Carnitas taco...our all time favourite. The pork is so juicy and tender, sitting beneath a glorious helping of guac, topped with pork rinds. Omg rinds. For the Meat&Bread lovers out there, you know what I'm talking about. \\n- The Pescado taco...in our humblest opinion is the best fish taco we've had so far in Van. The fish is perfectly seasoned and the complete opposite of an oily battered filling that most folks may grimace at. The craving for this taco is strong. \\n- Lastly, the Pastor taco...the pork is juicy, the bits of pineapple add a nice sweet acidity, and overall a tasty taco.- The Horchata drink here is spiced just right (as in no overwhelming cinnamon) and is quite a refreshing accompaniment to the tacos. I like that you can really taste the rice and nuts that were blended into the drink. \\n- The churro was nice to have but it wasn't as soft inside as I would have preferred. It's a tasty dessert to have...if you have the room (i doubt it after all the tacos).This place is a must-try. A casual place you can walk into on a Friday night."},{"name":"Din Ho Chinese BBQ","address":"8557 Research Blvd, Ste 116","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Recently my boyfriend and I took a trip to Austin due to a serious craving for some authentic Chinese food. My favorite is always the roast duck which I have had life changing experiences with in restaurants in Chinatown NY, Oakland CA, and of course in Houston TX. I ordered the BBQ pork (another of my favorites) with the roast duck. I was seriously disappointed when I heard the universal sound of buttons being pushed on a microwave, followed by the obvious opening and closing of a microwave door. Sure enough not even 2 seconds later, oh boy here comes my order...Fortunately the duck was still delicious. However, the microwave did unspeakable things to the usually delectable crispy pork skin. The skin was unrecognizable both to my eyes and to my taste buds, I could hardly even eat it, and it's one of my absolute favorite foods! Will be trying first Chinese BBQ next time."},{"name":"Commonwealth Restaurant and Market","address":"11 Broad Canal Way","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"Gross.  That's the only word I can think that appropriately describes this place.  It actually reminds me of the John Carpenter's movie \\"They Live\\", whereby an alien race has taken over the planet to harvest humans and appears as regular folk unless you wear special glasses.  Only something is always off - in an attempt to appear perfectly average, they give themselves away because no one is perfectly average.  Either that or this place is a front.  Maybe for an MIT lab doing experiments on fattening up americans, like Wall-E.  Every item on the brunch menu consists of too much food, EXTREMELY high fat meat, cooked in lard, oversalted and served on enough carbs to feed a pack of steer for a week.  No vegetables. No resemblance of a chef.  No reflection of a palate.  Everything about this place is off.  It consists of essentially a coffee/sandwich shop with self-seating and random overpriced items for sale, and separate dining room (with wait-staff), with outside dining.  The place looks beautiful.  It just looks like if someone made a reasonable menu, it would be amazing.  But when we went for brunch, it was deserted.The waiter seemed cold, abrupt, never checked on us, and frankly, we thought he may be a robot.We got the $8 cinnamon bun, which is obscene.  No other word for it.  It tasted decent, but not exceptional.  Instead, its main appeal was size.  It is the size of a dinner plate, a full loaf of bread topped with sugar.  We got the $14 18 wheeler, which seemed described as bacon, pastrami, 3 eggs, english muffin and home fries.    The waiter described it as way too much food (which it wasn't).  They forgot the english muffin.  The 3 scrambled eggs could best be described as 1 fried egg so oversalted it was inedible.  The pastrami was all fat so we didn't eat it.  The bacon was a slab of pork belly, with the meat removed so it was strictly a large thick slab of unappetizing fat sitting on everything else.  The home fries were crunchy, having been fried in duck fat.  But after eating half a loaf of bread, er cinnamon bun, wasn't really in the mood for more carbs.Partner had a croque monsieur variation - which consisted of a slab of oversalted ham and cheese on dry grilled foccacia topped with an oversalted sunny side up egg.  He said it was so dry that good thing they included the egg because otherwise it was inedible.  He left it half finished along with the home fries.  Even still, we both felt nauseous getting up from the table.  They only have a handful of selections for breakfast, so we can't be blamed for choosing poorly.  The other choices were biscuit with fried chicken slathered in sausage gravy, or a sausage with gravy on a biscuit, etc, etc.  Essentially every dish is $14 and consists of fatty meat, gravy, salt, duck fat fries, heavy bread, and extra fat.After brunch, we checked out their storefront.  A jar of teddy's peanut butter, $3 at stop and shop, $3.50 at whole foods, was $6.  Everything else seemed double the price of similar whole foods items, but its not clear they were even meant to be purchased as opposed to serving for atmosphere/museum pieces.This place just seems off.  It's just wrong.  Which goes back to my original point.  It's a front for something - an experiment, alien control of humans, who knows.

I was so excited to come here and order up a capu and some exquisite dessert. Instead I got a waitress who was overwhelmed and slow, and food that was inaccurately described on the menu. I'll paint the picture: it was a Sunday night, the place was half full (or half empty, however you prefer to look at it), our waitress seemed pleasant and pretty attentive..... All this was soon to change (except the Sunday night part). Taking our sweet time browsing through the menu, we were pleasantly surprised to see that they served savory dishes. We started off by ordering a spinach and artichoke dip, which turned out to be more of an arti-joke! The generously sized dip arrived with 6 tiny toasted baguette slices. I know the economy is bad but come on. The dip, although very flavorful, did NOT BY ANY MEANS taste like it had spinach and artichoke... I swear it tasted exactly like warm babaganoush (Middle eastern eggplant dip similar to hummus). The consistency was a tad too runny for my preference. But I still ate it up with a spoon once the bite-sized pieces of bread were gone. We then ordered a cappuccino and a Jasmin tea. My friend's tea arrived first, and 20 minutes later my cappuccino (which I had to send back because it was cold). Both the tea and capu tasted great. We ordered a 3-piece sampler dessert from the \\"For Sharing\\" menu (which to me implies larger sizes). What arrived were three bite sized confections(as you've probably guessed, I am not a fan of the bite-sized phenomena). We could have made the dessert disappear  in 2.5 seconds, but my friend and I - being the ladies that we are - took teenie tiny bites and made the experience last. The cheesecake bite was Da Bomb! The creme brulee bite was yummy, and the apple/cranberry tart bite was ok. After finishing our dessert and hot beverages, it took about 30 minutes to get our waitress' attention to request the check in the now very crowded restaurant. Then another 20 minutes for her to pick up the check - which at this point we notice that the folks at table next to us who arrived after us, had come and gone. WTF? Finally the change came back from what we paid, and we were out of there at 11pm. This experience lasted 3 hours. Okay, 2 hours, but still too long. I had higher hopes for this establishment. But I do plan to try it again, maybe a different location and not on a Sunday night.

In short, I won't be back, even for a special occasion or when friends are in town. Maybe the kitchen has having an off night, or it's lost a step or two but the only positive about the dinner, which included wine, two appetizers, steaks, 3 sides and 2 desserts, was the desserts...and the steaks were OK. First of all, I should know better than to order seafood at a steak house but I'd read fantastic reviews about the crab cakes and there are a lot  of attractive seafood selections on the menu. So, we ordered a crab cake and fried oysters to start the evening. Unfortunately, both were underwhelming and not really worth eating. The crab cake was just a big mush of crab served barely warm with a white sauce that added nothing to the flavor -- and boy did it need flavor. I'm used to firm and slightly crisp crab cakes...but that was not what I had last night. More like a can of crab meat dumped on a warm plate. The oysters were just as underwhelming. After my first oyster, which still had the muscle attached, I couldn't eat any more. Bland...soggy...a total miss. OK...the steaks were decent. I ordered a fillet and my partner a rib-eye. My steak was cooked and seasoned perfectly. My partner's steak was cooked perfectly but was WAY over salted...WAY...WAY over salted. The other problem we had was the place is so dark it was almost impossible to carve lean pieces of meat from the ribeye...you just couldn't see well enough to tell the lean from the fat. We ordered three sides -- mashed potatoes and creamed corn, which we've had before and loved, along with some tomato, zucchini, squash mess the waiter recommended. Again -- just not what I remembered loving before. The potatoes were OK...creamed and full of butter. The creamed corn had a nice spicy kick but was too pasty and thick this time around and the tomato, zucchini, squash mess -- well....it was just that, a tasteless mess. The waiter did ask how everything was -- and I answered honestly, \\"just ok\\". He followed-up with asking what he could do to make it better than ok but there isn't much you can do at this point. We ordered dessert and had coffee. The desserts were the highlight of the evening. All in all, a very expensive yet disappointing dinner.

There are prepared salads as well as other fresh ingredients to build your salad from scratch. There's always a good variety of soups to choose from, from creamy tomato to chicken noodle to even chili.

The solution is the Chipotle Pastrami, which is one of my favorite sandwiches period. This is exactly what I have made for myself in the past and every element works perfectly together.

I had no idea so took a min to look over the menu. I ended up getting a strawberry lemonade smoothie. It was about 7-8 for a 32 oz which is decent considering the fresh ingredients they use and when comparing to the more fancy places like Zest Juice Co. I was very satisfied as the smoothie was delicious and smooth, no clumps or chunks at all. I'm not sure how long this location has been here but I hope it stays so I'll have a place to grab one quickly before class during school"},{"name":"Maple Street Biscuit Company - Oviedo","address":"978 City Plaza Way","city":"Oviedo","stars":"4.5","text":"I was craving/needing biscuits and gravy one morning after a night of too many tequilas. Well, I'm glad I opted for a bit of a drive to go check this place out because it was just what the doctor ordered. So many options here, with and without a biscuit, or friend chicken. But, I figured if I'm in for a penny, I'm in for a pound. And I went all out and ordered what must've weighed two pounds. I got the The Five & Dime.  Biscuit topped with fried chicken, gravy, a fried egg, cheese, and last but not least bacon. I asked for the chicken on the side because I wanted to experience it on its own. This dish was amazingly good and not surprisingly hearty. I didn't have to eat the rest of the day.  The gravy was clearly homemade and had some spice to it, which I so appreciated because it tasted like my dad's. The cheese didn't add much, but oh well. I ate every morsel even sitting at a table of strangers. The wait is the only thing that was a bit much, but I forgave after sinking my fork into that biscuit."},{"name":"Clay Oven Indian Cuisine","address":"7696 W Irlo Bronson Memorial Hwy","city":"Kissimmee","stars":"3.5","text":"The mixed appetizer was dry.

Swordfish tasted rubbery and was drenched in tomato sauce. Calamari was burnt (likely due to the oil not being changed out--long overdo). Wait was incredibly long (which I don't mind, if the food is worth it).One of the things we noticed was the unsanitary condition the restaurant was in. If you check out the floors---it's questionable when it was last washed. The vents were covered with dust and caked with oil. On top of it, the cook was touching raw chicken and then mixing it with pasta as he was prepping the dish. Holy cow, salmonella poisoning! He wasn't even wearing gloves. Luckily it wasn't our meal he was prepping but still. The only highlight was the black pasta.

Quick, friendly service, and a good selection. They've been open for about a month or two, so I'm sure that they've been working on the kinks to grow a fan base. However, I would agree that the costs are rather steep in comparison to most revolving sushi places. And I could understand that for most people they'd like to see a menu, but you can order specific rolls or ask for recommendations (duh). I do like the fact that the orange sauce is self serve, I hate*hate asking the chefs at other places for it. AND they have the better ginger (pink) than most places.The owner owns his own seafood store (or something) thus the tuna was fresh and delicious. I don't mind the costs, but I can see myself partaking in their happy hour special on Monday & Tuesday (3:30p - 6:00p) where every plate is $1.75 while the red plates stay $1.25.Give the place a shot, it's worth trying especially if you're in the area as the next round-about sushi is on 23rd or near Lloyd Center."},{"name":"The Vancouver Fish Company","address":"1517 Anderson St","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Saw this place while turning into to Granville Island Marketplace and thought what a nice place with outdoor patio seating on the waterfront with the sun shining.

So long lobster bisque. See you later wedge salad. And forget about the Sole Oscar. Basically, anything fresh (read perishable) has been omitted and/or replaced.Staff seems to have changed, which is nothing new, but the dining room staff last week were diner level servers, and not in keeping with $20+ entrees. Forks were dirty. Service was slow, despite being one of only three tables in the dining room.Today I tried the bar again, but the teriyaki beef bites literally tasted like dog food, and they've changed up the recipe for gorgonzola potatoes... Everything was underwhelming.It is still a nice place to have an okay meal in a usually dead dining room. The cigar bar upstairs is still unique enough to bring me back.

Just beware of that chili pepper warning on the menu because the spice is real here. I get my dishes mild and it's still pretty spicy (but in a good way). To start, our group got the fried calamari which was lightly battered and fried to order. It came with a sweet chili sauce and I especially liked the pickled jalape√±os that came on the side. We decided to get the kao soi as well and I wish I had discovered it sooner because this has become my newest favorite dish. The Thai curry noodle comes with egg noodles hidden within the rich broth and is topped with crispy breaded chicken and fried noodles. The flavors and textures blended so well and was not too spicy.

If it IS out of print, it's probably in the used section. I love going to bookstores and walking out with a book that I had no intention of buying, but with such a huge selection random awesome book discovery is a bit daunting. It's probably better to go to Powell's when you know exactly what you want, because I spent nearly an hour in the photography section and walked out empty handed because I had no idea which I wanted.In any case, it's a great bookstore; the staff isn't the most friendly, but when you have so many books, who cares???Couple of pain-points; the prices on the new books aren't the best; maybe since they're not BN or Borders, they can't have rolling 40% deals on titles, but I would have expected a place like this to have pricing as one of their strong points.

I did order a Bloody Mary this time with Tito's vodka (it costs a few more bucks than their regular $3.50 special), and the cocktail was very good.  Only missing a celery stick.  It was spicy enough and tasted very fresh--the waiter said they make the ingredients fresh in-house.  Otherwise, you can get a well Bloody Mary or mimosa for $3.50.

We were promptly seated in a very open, bright, orange, inviting dining room where each table had its own grill.  Our server, Miriam, was very nice and efficient and asked us if we had ever been there before.  Having not, we hoped for all the lowdown.  We got our basic instructions and each ordered the same, 8oz bottles of buttermilk batter and mix-ins of blueberries and bacon, and maple syrup.  He got a side of bacon (yes, I pointed out he'd already gotten bacon for the pancakes and he gives me a look like 'what's your point?') and I a side of breakfast potatoes. Before we came I yelped the place and one person mentioned how the pancake artwork made them smile.  Way ditto when I looked at the back wall!  That's my kinda art: yummy.  I always visit the bathrooms.... not only cuz I drink a lot of water, but you learn much about an establishment from the bathroom.  Nice and clean and fresh smelling.  The boys working at slappycakes were even hot. Atmosphere, check.  While I was gone my partner overheard our server talking to a neighboring table and pointing out there was syrup at the table.  We were only slightly annoyed with this for not having it pointed out to us and also for the fact the we totally didn't notice it.  We may not have ordered syrup had we noticed.  On the other hand I live with a Vermont-er, real maple is usually inevitable. I found the process of making pancakes there much messier than I anticipated.  I was very patient and waited but no matter when I tried to flip, it got very stuck. Each time I tried I ended up with a kinda wet massacred cake.  Boo.  Dunno if it wasn't hot enough (someone did come by and turn it up at one point) or what but that was disappointing.  What cooked well was very tasty.  The blueberries were fresh and sweet, the bacon nice meaty chunks.  I MUST say the potatoes were most excellent, perfect even.  Nice and soft on the inside and crisp perfection on the out.  Average bacon slices.  He tells me the drip coffee tasted 'funny.'  Worth the $31 in the end? I think we'd have done better to share one order of pancakes and get individual sides for ourselves cuz we had a measurable amount of batter left.

I wasn't looking for much other than a quick and solid meal, and yet what I found instead was a place that has Ah-mazing, will-be-thinking-about-for-days level food.    Seriously, my brisket pita was too die for. Everything in it was so unbelievably flavorful: The brisket is juicy and tender. The pita is homemade and it shows, because it was incredibly warm and soft. The \\"special sauce?\\" I don't know what's in it, but there's some sort of magic in that sauce because I couldn't stop eating it. The hummus was creamy, and the Baba was delightfully smoky.   Don't even get me started on the toppings. The carrots, cauliflower, pickles, sweet beets, and pickled cabbage are so damn good that I could've ate a pita just filled with these four things and wouldn't have missed the meat. If you're vegetarian or vegan, you'll have no trouble finding something to eat here.

My friend was seated with a glass of wine first and I joined her. Since we were heading to a show after dinner we had time to enjoy a relaxed dinner, but couldn't chill for hours.The server took a while to make it to our table (after I was seated) to inquire about drinks for me, so when she did come by we quickly placed my wine order and our tapas orders to speed things up. My friend ordered rice, roasted veggies and fillet Mignon.  I ordered Garlic shrimp, goat cheese and potato torta, out of everything the rice came first...which was odd, as it was clearly a side dish. The veggies were delivered next, along with my shrimp and goat cheese. It took awhile for my friends fillet to come out and 60 minutes of a wait to get the Potato Torta. The server removed the torta charge from the bill appropriately, without a complaint or a peep from us.  Service and kitchen seemed a bit discombobulated throughout the meal. During our wait for food, we turned away 2 tapas orders that were being delivered to our table, instead of the ordering table. My friend ordered the Creme Brulee for dessert, which was served in a chocolate bowl.  I thought it looked nice and was a generous portion for the price.

I also went into expecting the best bbq ever, so that didn't help.Between four people, we got 1/2 pound of extra moist brisket, 1/4 pound lean brisket, a whole jalapeno sausage link, a medium-sized (pint?) baked beans, medium cole slaw, and medium potato salad. As everyone's already mentioned, the best part was the brisket! Everyone at the table didn't like the jalapeno sausage. The sides were a toss-up - my favorite was the potato salad, and the cole slaw was pretty great for someone who normally isn't a fan of cole-slaw. However, the beans were way too peppery (and I like pepper!). One turn off was the guy who took our order. I don't know what it was, but he seemed fake-friendly and after placing our order said, \\"that's it?!\\" and insisted on me ordering more..it was a little uncomfortable and I think I spotted some almost-eye-rolling. Yes, I'm a Texan and yes I love meat, but for an 11am lunch, a pound and half of meat, 3-4 pounds of sides, and half a loaf of bread would do just fine for 4 people.

This place is bound to covert those anti-waffle Joes and Janes. I noticed there were fewer items on the regular menu than my first visit last summer, yet I recognized a few mainstays like the Maple Bacon, Milk and Honey, and Chunky Monkey.My eyes darted to the Caramel Apple Waffle ($6). It has apples in it, so that should automatically make it a pretty healthy option, right? OK fine, it's sauteed spiced apples, but that's still awesome. Let's see...peanuts and peanut butter are nice for unsaturated fats and protein! Gotta fill this stomach somehow!Oh, the whole caramel sauce deal and the pastry cream portion of the description? Um...well, yes, that could rock me to sleep, but it's all good! We want flavor! Sweet baby Jesus flavor!And a sweet baby Jesus of a presentation. Will I go to hell if I eat this? I can go to one of those confession booths later, if need be.And for eating the waffle, God nuked thy gluttonous panda with severe food coma.It might be the most decadent dish I've had in a while. The abundance of peanut butter and Spanish peanuts attacked my stomach with multiple textures, attempting to score a premature surrender. The apples were this warm, heavenly gift countering the heavy peanut aspects. I wanted to get on my knees and start praising the Lord. The waffle had a firm, crisp outside and a soft interior. My belly wanted to wave the white flag near the end, but my eyes and heart refused. In layman's terms? It's a meal of a waffle and it's holy delicious.Next time, I might consider a less filling waffle. The peanut butter and Spanish peanuts became an anchor as the minutes rolled by. I might have won the battle against the Caramel Apple Waffle, but completely lost the war. I was immobile and listless back home, forgoing any dinner. On the bright side, Charlene saved me money! Thanks!You will also see frequent specials at this cart. Charlene's even done specials with Southern influences, such as a waffle with sausage gravy and a waffle topped with pulled pork.

They have a wide range of brews that they rotate every day (I think it's a light roast, dark roast, a flavor, and then maybe decaf?) and almost all are delicious (specifically: the Holiday roast, House blend, Ethiopia Moka Harrar and the Sumatra). I've also had some lattes and cafe au laits, and those are good too, but I haven't had any in a while. They sell their coffee bagged too, which you can get as beans or ground, and if you buy a bag you get a small coffee for free.

However, once you walk inside to this cozy little restaurant and decide what to order (the menu has Thai, Vietnamese, Chinese, and Japanese dishes), you'll realize that you've made the right choice. Because we had never gone here before, we tried a sample of dishes, starting off with the Calamari and Sweet & Sour Soup. The calamari was good and the soup was to-die-for (and this is coming from a person who usually doesn't eat soup period). Boyfriend loves spicy food and ordered the Wild Boar Basil (which had a spicy level of 2) and I had the Pineapple Chicken (spicy level 0). While he thought that the boar could have been spicier, he said that it was \\"delicious\\" nonetheless. I also was very pleased by the light and yummy flavor of the chicken dish. Even though we took the last seat in the house (literally), service was still fast and friendly (our waitress even brought out 2 spoons for the soup). A quirk that I liked was that they automatically served the dishes with silverware and offered chopsticks to those who wanted them. Also, for a 34 dollar meal, we were both able to leave full and completely satisfied.

First time I came I was told I would have to sit at the bar, again understandable, don't want one person tying up a table that could have 2-3-4 people. There were no seat at the bar inside or at patio so when I went back to the hostess stand they said tough luck and try and come back again tomorrow. Second time, I was told I would have to sit at the bar but it would be good luck finding a spot because they were usually taken up by ~actual~ customers waiting for tables. Third time I was told they don't seat single parties period and to try and find some place else to eat. Listen dude I understand, I get it, single people don't make you as much money as groups so you don't like to seat them.

I loved it as a neighborhood joint, and I miss it to death.The Nook seems to have taken what cries out to be a neighborhood location and tried to turn it into a generic chain-ish kind of place, starting with the pretentious logo, plasticky menu, and overdone bland, er, blonde plywood interior.The fixation with tots, tarted up as totchos, is frankly appalling. Yuck. A joke of an idea enlarged to take up 25% of the menu. Double yuck.The patio continues to be great, and is improved by its mild makeover. The staff is friendly - really friendly - and the other night I had a luscious lemony roast chicken that was out of control delicious, leading me to feel that the Nook has a bit of an identity crisis. Are you trying to be the schlocky tater-totcho chain of the future, or a neighborhood joint where I can pop over after work with friends or alone and have a delicious-enough meal of reasonably conceived and priced food, a pint or two, and get some good dare I say it P of W mellow going on?

Stingy, non-pancake options are salty yet bland, and c'mon, the pancake batter is fine but for each side you order (really the point of pancakes, if you're going to cook them yourself) you get half a banana, a few berries, a tiny cup of each other element. Plus you're doing all the work yourself! This should be really cheap. But it ain't. And it's not like the batter is so good that you get something like the specialty pancakes at Zells or Sanborns.

Review it accordingly! I will not compare this sushi to proper sit-down-real-sushi.  The point of conveyer belt sushi is to get shit done, and quickly, at a reasonable quality.  In my opinion, this place does exactly that, very well.  I'm just going to go ahead and say that so far, this is my favourite conveyer belt sushi in town.Personally, I love their (imitation) crab-salad rolls.  I'm a big crab salad fan, though.  if you don't like imitation crab, don't eat here.  Unless you like udon noodles.  The udon here is actually quite good.  I come here for their lunch and sometimes their happy hour - and their happy hour deal on food is good too, I find: the deal is all plates are $1.75 or less, meaning that all those plates that are normally $3.00/each are cheaper.   Only catch is you have to buy a drink. Any drink, alcoholic or not, will do.I think this place beats other sushi go-rounds because there is some small bit of table service and it's almost always timely and friendly.  I have spent a very long time sitting around ready to pay at other sushi go-rounds, which isn't convenient and doesn't fit well with the sushi-go-round model of speed.The other reason I really like eating at this kind of place with a group is because of the ability to pick and choose.  Someone who is less hungry can just grab a seaweed salad.  Someone who is starving can grab a bunch of California and tempura rolls.And you know what?  The avocado here is always fresh.  No brown yucky old avocado here.My favourite roll is the tempura shrimp roll.Although, I do have one minor qualm - please avoid the shit out of that weird spicy orange mayo sauce.  I'm not sure why but it has the consistency of barf and if you put it on your food you will be sad I promise.

I had a falafel pita chock full of lettuce, peppers, cucumbers, feta, and Greek dressing. Hubs had a chicken Caesar wrap that was tossed in Caesar dressing and then put in the pita.  The falafel and the chicken for both wraps were cooked on the grill which made warm pitas (the best kind!!)Our total bill was $14 and change.

I would not have fit the demographics otherwise - I am neither a retiree nor an adult with young children.

Yes, the hotel is one large sprawl of tower and conference center (what Orlando hotel isn't?), but with this particular hotel it felt like a bit of care actually went into designing, planning and running the hotel.  The service at the reception desk was top-notch, the food was actually decent, the room was clean and spacious with an awesome view (I came to appreciate how priceless nice view is in my next hotel visit in Cleveland - see my other review), and needless to say the stay was more than pleasant.

The noodle salad was a really nice sour counterpoint to the others with its various veggies.  The sauce for the catfish noodles, a spicy pineapple, was awesome on tasting, but even after we added the entire little bowl, the flavor disappeared and the dish was a disappointment, especially since it's priced just a bit above the others.  We ended up adding the leftover catfish's noodles to the glass noodle salad, which ended up being pretty good.Overall, the complexity of the flavors was great and it was a very fun meal, but on the balance it was a bit too sweet and the catfish dish was bland compared to the rest.  We didn't encounter any of the service issues others have seemed to--our server was very helpful and informative, and the secondary guy (server? busboy?) also took his time to give us his opinions on the dishes we wanted to order, which was very helpful.

It's a huge dish and it can easily stuff two people. The sauce is what makes it so special! Z said that the chef put tons of garlic and wine in two separate pans and then combine them in our dish... It was pretty garlicky even after the meal. Z loved the pasta with the heavenly sauce. I also tried their famous squid ink past cooked in two ways: aglio olio and alfredo. I have to say I am not too crazy about the pasta because it is too hard to chew... but both Aglio oliio and alfredo tasted good. It really can't compare to the squid ink past in Basta Pasta in NY, which can totally blacken your teeth can lips. Too bad they stop producing it. Also tried the calamari meatball the first time. It was good, especially the sauce (notice the trend about sauce?),  but I didn't order it the second time around. Noticed the couple who sat next to us shared a pasta entree served in a pan.

The cucumber app was definitely not authentic and tasted oddly like the cucumber you would find in a California roll. Lastly the lettuce tasted like it was boiled and plated without even the slightest bit of seasoning. It reminded me so much of the soggy iceberg lettuce you would find in a school lunch hamburger. It didn't even come with the tofu! Not to mention that the portions were tiny for the expensive price. After this disappointment we ordered white rice which we felt assured that they couldn't mess up. Maybe I'm just being particular but the rice was soggy and over cooked, something that you would not expect at an upscale Chinese restaurant. Then again, there were a lot of expectations that were not met today. We definitely would have left hungry if we didn't remember our trusty lunch leftovers and ate it there.

You MUST come here if you're in Portland and like Thai food. It doesn't get more authentic than this. The only non-authentic dish is the Vietnamese fish sauce wings (duh), but they are delish. I recently found a new love and prefer the Gai Yang (grilled chicken) over the fish sauce wings. It has a lemongrass tang to it and goes well with the Som Tum (papaya salad). The fish sauce wings can be a tad too salty, eat with sticky rice. We took an out of town Thai friend there yesterday and also ordered the Nua Nam Tok (spicy beef) which instantly became his favorite dish, and Yum Woonsen (glass noodle salad) which was very tasty. I brought the leftovers home and added boiled shrimp to the Yum Woonsen. The Kuay Tiew Rua (beef boat noodle) we thought was too oily. We like the Khao Soi better.

This has been bookmarked on my list since we decided that we were going to move to Austin. Hubby and I came her for dinner on our one year anniversary! This place look so cool and the menu was just looked awesome. Something right up our alley. When we got there we were informed that there was about a 20-30 minute wait. No big deal. We made our way to the bar for some beverages. I had a Hard Lemonade and my husband got one of the Austin Beerworks beers. My beverage was so refreshing. It was a great beverage before dinner. We hung out in the bar area that was like a little house. I don't think we waited the full time. Our buzzer went off and we were quickly seated in the front room right by a window. The room was loud! It was peak dinner time and there were 2 large groups housed in that room. Our server was really friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. She made great suggestions and answered questions that we had. Complimentary Spicy Popcorn was brought the table while we waited for our food. I LOVE popcorn so I was pretty excited about this. Don't mind if I do. It's great munchy while you're drinking beer and waiting. We started off with the Corndog Shrimps with a honey mustard, blueberry swirl. Our server said they sounded kind of weird but it's the best appetizer. She was so right! They were skewered shrimp with corndog batter. It was so light and crispy it was perfect. Oh and let's not forget about that honey mustard with blueberry jam. Perfection! I could eat like 5 orders of those by itself. For dinner I got the Chicken Fried Steak with chipotle cream gravy. This thing was so giant!! I had been craving CFS for a while but was waiting and holding back on getting it. I wanted to make sure I got it at the right place. The wait was over and I made a great choice! The chipotle gravy was a great twist on this great Southern classic dish. It added a great kick to it. for my sides I got Mashed Potatoes and Veggies. The Mashed taters were to die for. So smooth and creamy! I love them that way. Even though I don't have the patience to do them that way myself. Hubby got the Southern Fried Chicken and Waffles with maple syrup, whipped butter and chipotle cream gravy. Man this was another delicious indulgence. Chicken was perfect. Crispy on the outside. Moist, juicy and flavorful on the inside. The waffles so good too. They seemed to disappear under the chicken but I think it's becuase it was a light and fluffy waffle. Oh so good together!

It was our first time trying Korean BBQ and I am now a fan! The restaurant itself is really small and they weren't busy at all when we arrived.  There was one other table and it made us kind of nervous. They had korean music playing and korean t.v. shows on, which i thought was cool. The service was very good, if not a little too attentive.  Other than the fact that they had to stand there while everything cooked, they kind of hovered.  It made us a little self conscious.  I would still rather that then have them totally ignore us, though, so what can ya do? The food was pricey, but very good. We tried the spicy port bbq and the flank.  It was all delicious.  We weren't sure what all the banchan was, but we tried everything and it was awesome. All in all, I enjoyed it very much and would return.  The place was clean but we didn't use the restroom while we were there. I'm sure that they were fine, though.

After driving by the sign out front several times, my husband and I finally decided to try it out. For our first experience, we dined in. The place is cozy, comfortable and clean. The service was a tad on the slow side and we were left alone for quite some time, but the food was so phenomenal that we quickly let it go (we left rather quickly as well because we are not used to these types of spices and a medium level was even a bit more than my stomach could handle). Since then, we've taken out several times over the past few months. Always deliciously addicting and ready in a jiffy. Our go-to dishes are medium veggie biryani and mild chicken tikka masala- both have incredibly well-rounded flavors. We also tried the Aloo Gobi today and it definitely didn't disappoint. Consistency is key, and they nail it every time.A few things to note (because I always want the real deal with reviews). We have taken out on all different days, but usually during the dinner service so I don't know about lunch. I have a sensitive stomach but my husband doesn't and after our first experience, we were both hurting. Try lower heat levels first if you're not used to this style of cooking. The stomach aches have definitely gotten better with more exposure to the spices, so it's totally worth it and not anything for which I would fault the chefs. The staff is great and that's the reason I'm finally writing a review. I called today when they were closed between services and at 5:01 they called me back even though I didn't leave a message. When I showed up, the server rang me up and I asked her for extra lemon. She walked away and another gentleman quickly came over to grab my order. She stopped me twice after that- once inside to make sure I got the lemons, and then once outside because she thought my order looked small and wanted to double check it. Sure enough, I was missing some additional rice. That is fantastic service. Everyone makes mistakes so I would never freak out, but we've all been there...you drive all the way home, get yourself settled (sometimes even throw on your PJs), get everything out, and realize you're missing a simple but pivotal part of your meal...OMG, seriously?

Al dente squid ink pasta drenched in olive oil, chunks of garlic and ground squid. Definitely not something you can get anywhere and is something you should order when you're here. Their portions are pretty big so if you don't eat that much, order the appetizer portion or share it with someone. Pasta also comes in the pan it was cooked in which I thought was pretty cool. - Clams and Linguini in white sauce: my favorite dish of the meal.

Today we tried again and called in an order for breakfast tacos, had the employee repeat the order, went to pick it up but when we got home we discovered the order was completely wrong... AGAIN.  When we called to report the issue they seemed very confused as if a taco order with potato/bean/cheese was unheard of. The manager, Israel Sevilla, refused to refund our money even though we had to drive back to the restaurant to pick up the correct order.  He claimed that Vikki Gonzalez, the employee that took the order repeated the order we placed therefore there was nothing he would do to improve our experience.  Apparently, Vikki Gonzalez can hear the order you place, repeat it to you but write something completely different to the kitchen.  At Casa Arandinas the employee is RIGHT and the customer is WRONG.

Huge PortionsI introduced four guys to this place and challenged them to finish an order of pasta.  Only one of them managed to finish his entree.  As a normal-sized female, I'd say that each entree could easily be THREE healthy portions.

Mainly because I really feel the need to tell people about my experience at pok pok.  If you have even a rudimentary understanding of what constitutes good south-east Asian cuisine, or just good Asian cuisine in general, then DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT, go to Pok Pok. 1) Not authentic Northern Thai - Their \\"authentic\\" thai menu includes a mis-match of other Asian styles, (namely Vietnamese, Cambodian, and Chinese) but each component, including the main Thai portion, is done VERY poorly. Some items are just simply Vietnamese or Chinese dishes with a fancy description and marked-up price.They should more aptly call it \\"Asian fusion\\", not that it would improve how their food tastes though.2) Signature wings - this item was unique but was way too salty. I couldn't even finish it. Overall, sub par for a signature dish.3) Rice - it really says something about an Asian themed restaurant if you can't even get the rice right. The sticky rice was not good and it wasn't even fully cooked. I ate it, but only because I needed something to buffer the ultra-salty wings.4) It was like the menu was created by someone with no culinary training, who saw an episode of \\"Anthony Bourdain in Thailand\\" then went to the \\"Asian\\" section of their local Walmart Supercenter and threw a bunch of ingredients together and called it \\"Authentic Northern Thai\\". Seriously, I'm not even exaggerating. 5) Price/wait time - price and wait time would not even be an issue if the food was actually decent. I'm willing to wait and pay for good food but considering how bad it was, waiting that long and paying that price made my experience that much worse.6) This place is the PF Chang's of Thai food. Actually, that's way too generous; PF Chang's does a way better job of bastardizing Asian cuisine than this place. Portland is known for their quality dining and discerning palate, so it's astonishing and disappointing to see this place ranked so high among the masses."},{"name":"WAVE Asian Bistro & Sushi","address":"301 N Baker St, Ste 106","city":"Mount Dora","stars":"4.5","text":"We came here on our trip to Mount Dora.

The service was ok at best. As an Asian restaurant, I hope they know what family style means. Unfortunately, they would put our dishes in the middle of the table without additional plates or bowls like the mission noodle soup. Awkward at best. Sushi pizza was delicious with a crunchy fried nori/rice crust and savory sashimi pieces on top covered in spicy mayo. It really hit all my taste buds for sushi. The sushi tower was good too, but not something I would order again (you're just eating rice with avocado and salmon pieces, it's more presentation than flavor). The caterpillar was okay, tasted more like cucumber than anything else. The green monster was good, it had a tempura fried shrimp in the middle topped with eel. The double spicy salmon was also good, with an extra helping of spicy salmon on top of the sushi. The mission noodle soup SUCKED. The broth was too salty and had zero depth. There were bok choy, onions, and zucchini for vegetables with the soup, which is a weird combination for a restaurants eponymously named soup. I would've liked more bok choy over the mushy zucchini wedges and tasteless onions. The scorpion bowls were $18. I thought the price was steep because I know places that sell them for $11.

I've eaten better beef tacos from a taco truck, and for just a third the price. And the high quality (3) tacos at Bellagreen in Houston are exceptional!

With so many books they do a great job at dividing and displaying all that Powell's has to offer.  Under lesser management, I could see this place devolving into a wholesale clearinghouse costco of books vibe.  But you can tell that thoughtful care goes into every row and every display endcap.  There is nothing wasted on that end.There's a coffee shop in Powell's too, but I've never made it that far.  There's just so much to browse without even thinking about coffee.  I'm into screenplays and Powell's has a selection unlike anything I've ever seen.  Yes, there are current scripts that have recently been brought to life on the big screen.

I've been reading about this place for a while and we *had* to go here when a friend's wedding brought us to PDX.The food was amazingly fresh, flavors pronounced and complex, and tons of nuance. When the menu says spicy, it means it. It really really means it. The Papaya Pok Pok with black crab was damned near inedibly hot, but I somehow kept going back for more, the discomfort developing into this kind of perverse Klingon pain ritual until I finally admitted defeat and moved on to lighter fare.The muu sateh is about the most recognizable thing on the menu, being pork satay, but it was the best I've had. The lump of pork fat at the end was a great touch and the bread served with it was unexpected yet perfect. The Chiang Mai sausage was surprising, I was expecting something similar to Lap Cheong or other asian sausage, but this was spicy and fresh and about the size of a bratwurst. You could distinctly taste every ingredient that went into making it.The cocktail list isn't a throwaway either. Every drink on the menu is worth getting and is expertly prepared. There's some twists on classic drinks, but it's not change for change's sake. The Asian ingredients added to cocktails actually work, and pair perfectly with the food. For those who don't drink the drinking vinegars are also awesome and worth getting even if you do drink.The ambiance in the outdoor seating area is perfect, you feel like you're actually outdoors at a Thai food stand. The service is really efficient but casual. They're there when you need them and they aren't when you don't. They also offer suggestions about the menu but don't go overboard with it, automatically addressing the usual concerns people have. (If I were a picky eater I'd really appreciate the warning that the black crab in the pok pok is fermented and small and served with the shell).Altogether, a great restaurant, deserving of all the praise bestowed upon it."},{"name":"Starbucks","address":"210 Boylston St, Ste 13","city":"Chestnut Hill","stars":"2","text":"A guy named Steve is the only person in this Starbucks that knows how to make a cappuccino.

I found my book super quick! I like the signs on the shelves that point out the staff picks and popular books, plus directions to other sections of the store that have books on similar topics. It's like Amazon, but with more physical activity, social interaction, and instant book-in-hand gratification. They also have a good selection of Portland and general Oregon postcards 5/$1, which is good for Postcrossing.Finally, I don't often get to describe people as jovial, but the cashier who rang me up today was so jovial! He seemed to really be enjoying his job and it made me smile on this rainy day."},{"name":"Pinky's Famous Pizza","address":"165 Main St","city":"Medford","stars":"3.5","text":"Pinky's is some kind of wonderful.

Come on - it's the first time my Thai family comes to PDX. They have to see if it lives up to the test. Turns out, they're opening one in Vegas too so I guess they didn't have to go so far. But we made it to the OG restaurant to see if it lives up to all the hype.And well it certainly did. And so did the price! Almost $200.00 for 5 people yikes! But we eat a lot. That's what families do. We ordered 2 wing sets which were much bigger than I thought they would be. The flavor is what makes this place great. They keep it authentic. No spice level changes. Just straight up good food. It was a nice fish sauce flavor on crispy tender wings. We were hooked. The Chang beer was flowing and this was the best introduction to our vacation in the PNW. We also ordered the skirt steak salad. (This was a bit dry. They didn't have a lot of fat on it) The papaya salad had a good balance of flavor. We got some Thai sausage that was amazingly cooked. And plenty of sticky rice (aka sleepy rice for me). My brother of course had to get some pork belly too - his favorite. Overall Pok Pok was impressive but it's great for a one offer, special occasion type of me. It's hard when the prices are high for something you wish you can make at home. But they've got some secret flavors in the sauce that'll make you wish you can come back sooner rather than later."},{"name":"Burdock","address":"2702 Main Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Pretty happy with my adventure out to Main St tonight.  I read about Burdock & Co in Scout Magazine and had it on my list and so happy about it!  The atmosphere was great!  I loved the use of wood and lines in the space.  In a good way I felt like I was in a tunnel.  If you have ever been to Grand Central Station in Ny and been to the Oyster Bar this is somewhat of the feeling I got. I sat at the kitchen bar and watched the action as it unfolded.  Andrea and her team are so smooth and graceful.  Not to mention all so good looking!  At first I didn't know what to think of the menu and then I saw the fried chicken...yummers!  They take boneless thighs and lightly Panko them and deep fry them.  But when they arrive to your table you never would guess they were fried.  I felt like they were baked because there was no grease remaining on the chicken. They were so light and moist. The little treat on this dish was the fried chicken skin. It is fried separately from the chicken and placed on top as a homage to the chicken and as a treat to my taste buds.  Along side this moist little thigh were house made pickled vegetables that were to die for.  I started this endeavor with a poached egg sitting on a potato puree along side some cress and \\"granola\\" crumbled on top.  It was such a unique combination to me and just the perfect amount of flavor and food.  This was the perfect egg and chicken dish for the evening. I walked away enjoying to great dishes and an $11 glass of Chote Du Rhone for about $42 (including tip).   Considering I spend half that amount on a beer and a bad sandwich at lunch today I think I got a great deal.

I haven't tried Torchy's before, but these were pretty good - though not what I expected - not Tex Mex or anything close to Mex.  Good value - you definitely get what you paid for - tacos that have to be eaten with a fork.  Last thing - it was crowded, and it is packed pretty tight.  I think they need to lose a few tables.

The restaurant was not hard to find, it's on a main street (Church St) in Orlando and has a huge municipal parking lot right up the street. The place was closed down for the wedding cocktail hour. We cocktailed in the main restaurant room where there were many different awesome craft beers, good tapas appetizers and a stage with entertainment. The wedding moved upstairs to this beautiful cozy intimate room with a sprawling balcony for those who needed to take a breath of fresh air throughout the night. The food was offered buffet style, which isn't for everybody, but for my husband and some more of his family members being able to double fist your plates or go up for more servings was right up their alley. It was a small wedding by some standards with maybe 100 people (I could be wrong there), but it was a beautiful event.

We really enjoyed our waiters recommended oyster  options, ranging from very salty and tiny to a bit sweeter and also some fresh clams, which were really sweet and juicy.Or meal started becoming consistent sadly, after the oysters.  We ordered one bowl of the clam chowder and one bowl of the lobster bisque to start.  The lobster bisque was rich and velvety but I wish it had a little bit more lobster in it as it tasted mostly like a buttery, lobster broth.  The clam chowder was really difficult to eat unfortunately as the clams were super tough and chewy and the flavor of onions was way over powering.  I would not ever get this againWe split the warm lobster roll given that we were in Boston and it's gotten such great reviews. I would say it was OK it was a good sized portion but the lobster was fine not overly flavorful and at that point price I was hoping it would be one of the best lobster rolls I've ever eaten.I'd like to think that if we came back we have a better experience but since we don't live in the area I'd be hesitant to come back here, when there so many other great options in Boston"},{"name":"Island Creek Oyster Bar","address":"500 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"To people who aren't from around here: Island Creek is an oyster fishery in Duxbury, MA.

The interior is one lofty space with seating for 150+ people. The ambience is my favorite thing about this place. The live music and 50-foot ceilings project a lively, fun atmosphere to spend some time and grab a few drinks.Since we were in a brewery, I had to try the beer. Their selection is limited to maybe 8 or so. I'm a tad biased and spoiled with the wide selection available at similar establishments in the neighborhood. I got the American Blonde which I much enjoyed. Since it was a Thursday night, I stuck to one as I needed to be coherent the next morning.After perusing the menu, I settled on the beef shin ragu. The beef morsels were juicy but a tad salty. I wasn't a huge fan if the dish itself - it reminded me of pot roast meat over a bed of pasta. Odd but not in a bad way - just not my thing. I managed to sample my friend's shepherd's pie which was interesting. It was the first time I've had a shepherd's pie made with curry. I appreciate the risks they take to make it original but this one didn't work for me. It was presented on a skillet with the meat on the bottom and 5 ice cream scoops of mashed potatoes ontop. Both the shepherd's pie and my beef ragu were quite small portion-wise. As a self-proclaimed hungry man, it was more like a large appetizer.Overall, I enjoyed the ambience here more than the food.

The only downside to this place is that they are really popular, so there can be a wait, and parking can often be a problem. However if you do have to wait, there is a good sized waiting area next to the bar so you don't feel awkward standing around. They also have chairs just outside the front door that is in a covered area. But once you are seated, the atmosphere, food, and service is incredible. It is an old fashioned country house that has a modern look to it with decor on the wall and studio ceiling lights. It is cozy and yet open. You can sit inside or outside, and the outside is covered and heated during the winter so you are comfortable. On a couple of occasions when I ate outside, a couple of birds got under the tent area, but they didn't bother us. As far as the food, I like to think of it as home cooked food with a touch of gourmet. I hear their ice cream is homemade too, but you must ask for it as it is not listed on their menu. I have never had a problem with the wait staff. Besides being friendly, they are very personal and fast with service. If you have a group, they know who ordered what without asking, and pick up your trash on the table such as sugar packets and straw coverings. They are also suggestive and helpful with the menu.

So the rating of 3/5 stars for the food is based on my preference for meat, my big appetite for food (or their small portion size?), and their pricing. I got the Romantic, which is a grilled wrap primarily with cheddar cheese, broccoli, and avocado. The wrap itself tasted good, but as a meat eater I felt that it could have been better if they had thrown in some grilled chicken in the wrap. I was imagining how much better the wrap could have tasted with some meat in it (I knew I was eating at a vegan/vegetarian restaurant but couldn't help thinking how great it would have tasted with meat in it). Besides the obvious lack of meat in my wrap, I gave it a 3 out of 5 stars because I thought the price was a bit expensive for a small wrap. The wrap costs ~$10, but I still felt hungry afterwards. I thought it would have been more reasonable to charge between $5-$7 for the size of the wrap (or maybe I was just hungry???). Overall, if I ever feel like being vegan/vegetarian for a day (a meal) I will probably come back since they specialize in vegan/vegetarian foods.

My favorite menu item is surprisingly the burger even though there are so many other great things. The burger is seasoned deliciously with fresh herbs, and comes with a lemon aioli, avocado and delicious nueske bacon. I don't know what nueske bacon is but it is amazing. Today might have been an off-day for them, because I ordered the corned beef hash which had hardly any corned beef in it, and my friend asked for her burger to be cooked medium and it was very well done.

It was amazing, beautifully decorated -- but should I expect anything less than Eastern Standard's sister restaurant or from the Hotel Commonwealth? Probably not.ICOB is wonderful inside and although I'm not a huge seafood or oyster fan, I know a thing or two about both (having worked in more than my fair share of seafood and upscale dining places) and they had a wonderful and impressive selection, but this particular evening (during the 5th blizzard Boston's seen in 2011) I started off with the special soup du jour: butternut squash with mini crab cake croutons.My soup was pretty good, definitely a creative touch with the croutons. Other members of my party enjoyed the lobster bisque, clam chowder, a season salad, fried oyster slides and some breaded, cooked clams. I heard lots of yummy noises from one member of my party about his oyster sliders, but the others weren't blown away by their soups/salad.I had a really nice pinot noir to accompany my meal. One of my friends had the specialty cocktail of the evening, \\"Blizzard no. 5,\\" which he thoroughly enjoyed, although it was too much all spice for me.I had the fish & chips for my entree. I figured this was more than a safe bet seeing as even cheap pubs in Boston can batter and fry a fresh piece of haddock/cod and have me happy and satisfied, but this particular fish tasted more like tempura fried fish, the batter was almost soggy and too bread-y. An establishment of this caliber should use less breading, and a nice, fresh fish... Show it off! Don't cover it up. The fish itself wasn't amazing, I'd rather have F&C at Legal's for a lot cheaper to be honest. The fries were all right, but I got a side of broccoli, which the waiter was nice enough to split for us, which I enjoyed.Other members of my group got the cheeseburger (two thumbs up), the salmon (a-okay), scallops (very large and tasty) and the lobster roe noodles (my friend was very happy with these) and a side of curried cauliflower which no one really enjoyed. The manager did however bring over some of their giant biscuits on the house since it was our first time... they were excellent.We polished off our meals with a few desserts: cookies and milk (great assortment), a toffee, coffee and chocolate pudding (lackluster), and a lemon meringue which was the fan favorite. Also a good thing to note: they don't mess around with their coffee - served in big mugs, which we really, really liked. I can't stand when you finish off a great meal and your coffee comes in a mug the size of a condiment container.Overall, I'd like to try this place again (okay, and maybe again). I was definitely happy and enjoyed the experience, but I have my qualms with the food. Also, the menus were insanely hard to navigate. (I think I settled with Fish & Chips because I was so tired of reading, folding and unfolding, etc.) very cute ideas and good \\"fishing\\" themes carried throughout the restaurant, even over into the menus, but even the beverage list was annoying. Wines by the glass (red and white) were separated by random beers and cocktails, and even when we located them it was hard to figure out what kind of wines each were...This place has much potential. I'll be back and I'm sure they'll have made some improvements... an accessible bathroom would be a good start (we had to travel through the hotel, which was a mess when my friend got a random bloody nose...

That says a lot about the food and service.  It did lose a star recently, and I'll explain why later.  But first, the good stuff:This night, we were originally a party of 6, which I changed to 4 once I got to the restaurant.  After we sat down and got our drinks, I asked if we could add room for one more, and they were very quick to accommodate.  The staff is very helpful and very friendly.Our server was AWESOME!  Funny, energetic, and on top of his game.  Knew everything on the menu, had very good suggestions.Onto the food!Appetizers: We started off with the Steamed Mussels Marini√®re au Pastis and Lamb Tartare.  The mussels are by far some of the best prepared mussels I've ever had.  The broth is delicious, and you'll want extra bread to enjoy it all!  The Lamb tartare is also delicious with that quail egg on top.Entrees: Pan Roasted Hake - was done perfectly! They do seafood really well here.  Highly recommend this dish.We've also had the Roasted Statler Chicken and Prime Sirloin Steak au Poivre and both have been done really well. Dessert:  The Hazelnut Chocolate Mousse & Caramel Almond Tart are both really good!---------------------------------------------------Here is where that star was lost:My wife threw me a surprise birthday dinner here, since she knew how much I enjoyed this restaurant.  We had a private room on the 2nd floor, which worked out great for the surprise, because it's tucked away in the corner.  There were about 28 of us and the room was a good size to accommodate us.  My wife had set up a Prix Fixe menu with the general manager, and had specifically said that she did not want to pre-select any wines, and would rather each guest order their preferred cocktail or wine.  This is where things went wrong.  A red & white wine (about $60 bottles each) were chosen by the restaurant, and served to the guests before we got there and throughout the night.  Not only that, but it seemed as if they were trying to finish as many bottles as possible, because before someone was halfway through a glass, the server would just top it off without asking if the person would like more.  $60 per bottle * X bottles pretty much doubled the bill.  I highly recommend the restaurant for a small dinner with your significant other, or some friends... as for having an event here, I have my reservations."},{"name":"Caf√© Luna","address":"612 Main St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Best Chai Latte I have ever had and I've had MANY.

I do like that they can make coffee strong without it tasting burned, something Starbucks and its many clones has never figured out.I try to avoid the cookies and pastries, but the times I've given in they've definitely been good.

I can't say enough how pleased I was with this hotel, everything from the valet (which is only $6 more then regular parking, a bargain if your only staying a night or two.) Parking attendants where friendly and very helpful, check in was a breeze. The lobby is gorgeous, marble floors and water fountain,  high ceilings with exposed wooden beams. The lounge is further in with a beautiful bar, lots of cozy seats and a sushi counter. Our room was on the 18th floor which overlooked part of the parking lot and golf course, it was a beautiful view. The room was impressive, very, very clean and not a speck of dust. We have two queen beds, the mattresses were comfy, lots of pillows on each bed. There was also a desk with a nice leather chair along with a lounge chair by the window. The large flat screen TV was set on top of a large dresser that also held the safe and refrigerator. The best part of this room was the bathroom, it was HUGE!! Took up about half the room but so worth it, all marble and granite with a glass door stand up shower on one end of bathroom and on the other end a separate bath tub, the vanity was long, lots of space for two people to get ready. Tons of details, make up mirror, bath robes, 2 complimentary water bottles and a kcup machine in the closet (I think they ran out of counter space.) this hotel also has a Starbucks in the lobby along with a fed/ex store and two other gift shops selling clothes and other goodies. The pool was amazing, beautiful tropical landscaping, lazy river pool, jacuzzi, fire pits and its adjacent to a large golf course. We will definitely be coming back next time we go to Orlando.

One of them ordered a smoked salmon benedict but Angela put in a corned beef hash instead and ended up telling us it was not available so she ordered something else. We only realized she put in the wrong order when we saw the receipt. Ten minutes later her dish came out but the other two dishes were no where to be seen. A random waiter named nick walked by and we asked him to check up on our dishes.  He came back letting us know that the kitchen lost our slip but they're working on it right away. He apologized and brought us the ketchup that Angela neglected to bring despite us asking her a while ago..my lobster benedict cane out with my pancakes as a side. Angela walked around again looked at us and walked away..without apologizing for the mix up or asking if everything was ok. Haven't heard from her the rest of the meal. Nick ended up taking over and provided spectacular service despite it being over crowded and 90 degrees. He was very attentive and personable.. even more so than many waiters at high end restaurants.  I was pleasantly impressed.. I would probably have given the total  experience 3 stars if it hadn't been for Nick. As for the food The lobster was fresh but all claw.. The egg was perfectly poached but the English muffin was too thick and tough to cut. And the home fries were flavored well but cut too large for my liking. The pancake tasted of the grill as if it was placed on right after a piece of steak. Overall the food would have been a 3 the service for Angela is 1 because she basically ignored us even though she was our server. And Nicks service was a 5.

I love Italian food and have read many other good reviews about this eatery so why not. After this experience however, I can easily say I would not return. My thoughts on my experience:1. Awkward greeting area, as in there is no set area to check in with a host. I just stood there trying to make eye contact as several employees walked right by me. Finally an older man acknowledged me and helped but very uncomfortable. 2. Ability to make a reservation was nice.3. Service was good overall but not fantastic. Could use just a touch of warmth to improve. 4. The menu looked good. Nice variety of pastas from spaghetti and meatballs to shrimp pesto. We started with bruschetta which seriously lacked seasoning and flavor. I had to add salt and pepper and extra balsamic to make it enjoyable. Likely my least favorite aspect was the bread. Terrible bread. Basic sandwich sliced bread. I'm used to amazing peasant bread at Italian restaurants that's crunchy on the outside and fluffy and airy on the inside. Just a bad excuse for bread. I ordered the wild boar ragu and parpadelle and it too was very bland. The dish tasted like Chef Boyarde from a can. It was a runny, thin tomato sauce that honestly reminded me of Chef Boyarde. The noodles were also very undercooked. To the point where I wanted to ask fora new dish. I would not recommend. We split the tiramisu which was tasty. 5. Another disappointing event was that my guest's entr√©e arrived at least 5 minutes prior to mine. Then it made it uncomfortable because most people want to wait to eat but then you're obligated to tell them to eat while it's hot. The kitchen or staff screwed something up. As stated above, I will not return here as there are better Italian restaurants within walking distance, not to mention all of them throughout the city."},{"name":"Powell's City of Books","address":"1005 W Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"This place was great!

All in all, I'd say it's okay. I'd give it 2.5 if I could.Food first: The coffee was just fine. Two of us ordered quiche with salad, and even though the quiche was already prepared, sitting in the case, it took a good 20 minutes for a slice to be heated and put on a plate with a salad. It all tasted good, but I was bummed that my slice of veggie quiche was half the size of my friends' sausage quiche. The place itself just struck me as odd. The set up of the tables is really crowded and cramped on one side while leaving other parts of the shop kinda sparse and weird to get around. My least favorite feature was the huge spoon attached to the bathroom key. Also, there was a bathroom key. There was a line for the bathroom and everyone insisted on passing the spoon from person to person, which I found both annoying and gross.

It's pricy but I would gladly pay to go again! I came here with a large group of 7 family members. I called like 15 minutes before to check seating availability, and although they don't give wait times over the phone, they put me down on the wait list. I was super lucky to get a call very soon after! First of all, the ambience is stunning! It's a very trendy place - there's a whole wall made out of shucked, bleached clam shells that you just have to see to believe. Our server was great, patiently explaining menu options to my whole fam and offering suggestions. The food, however, was unquestionably the real star. We ordered a variety of oysters from their raw bar to start off, and I'm no oyster expert, but each one was smooth, flavorful, and delicious. The shucking is awesome, as I didn't feel a single grain of sand in my mouth. For the entree, I had the seafood bouillabaisse, which is a seafood stew. It was chock-full of seafood, and for being the healthiest option on the menu, it was still really delicious. My only complaint is that the salmon in it was a bit over cooked. If I were to choose again, however, I would have gotten my dad's lobster roe noodles. The noodles are orange because I think they incorporate the lobster row in it, and they're crazy yummy. The dish also comes with slices of beef that are so tender and juicy that you'll shed a tear in appreciation. The dessert here deserves a special shoutout too because despite this being a seafood place, it was my favorite part of the meal. The strawberry red velvet cake was superb - I would have never thought to put these two flavors together, but the fresh, tangy strawberry cream really complements the rich, subtlety bitter red velvet cake. The banoffee pie is also incredible, with an addictively tasty and crunchy crust layered with caramel and covered in the most delicious banana pudding/fluff thing.

Each experience was just about the same. Service:\\nThe waitress was awful, slow, and bitchy. The bartender was disinterested moody. Drinks:\\nThe best part about their drinks is the ice. They have an old school ice maker that slowly freezes huge blocks of totally clear (gas free) ice. Nearly every drink there comes with an impressive cube of crystal clear ice. On the first two visits there when they first opened the drink menu must have had nearly 60 cocktails. I was part of a large group and was able to try about 10 of the drinks, and it was clear that 60 cocktails was far outside of the talent range of the bartender/curator of the bar. Each drink was just off. None of them really shined, even something as cornerstone as a manhattan or negroni were unbalanced. On my most recent visit I noticed the menu was tightened up and in general the drinks were better.... but they weren't great.Overall, I would highly recommend almost any other cocktail bar in Austin.

We went for the namesake Papaya Pok Pok and of course-- the chicken wings. Papaya Pok Pok was spicy.

The sticky rice was recommended to pick up food with and eat with your hand and we went for it. It was dry, though. It didn't take away from the rest. It was delicious.. I wish I could have handled more.. I wished the couple next to us would have helped us out and shared our food and vice versa just to get more tasting in.. But, it never happened. It was just the two of us. Another highlight here were the Drinking Vinegars. Drinking Vinegars are said to have beneficial health properties.. Pok Pok uses it in cocktails or you could have it as a soda. If you don't partake in one and stick with water, what a surprise! The water they serve isn't plain tap water but infused water with Pandanus leaf.. It took a few sips until I realized it's not just regular water. It tasted like rice water.

It's worth mentioning that overall the vegetables were all very fresh as well. The second time we had a burrito al pastor and an enchilada platter. Both were delicious.

Our choices are few and far between. On the Westmoreland side of the neighobrhood, you have the utterly mediocre and criminally overpriced Pizzicato. There's Opa, the \\"greek\\" pizzeria which is your pretty run-of-the-mill local joint. Nothing bad about it, but you go there because there's nothing better near by. Muddy Rudder is more of a drink-and-atmosphere type place, but I would never go there because I was craving pizza.So when I saw Ash Woodfired in our swell little food cart pod on 13th, I was reasonably excited. There's a lot of potential here. But, in Portland, potential and $2.50 gets you a ticket to ride Trimet. Now, for starters, this is a vegetarian pizza joint. I don't have anything against a meatless pie in principle. But to stake your pizza business on the stuff is risky. You start putting things on pizza that really, REALLY don't belong (delicata? potato? I'm sorry, there's just no room in my pizza worldview for gourds and starchy root vegetables on my pies.).It is certain that this cart would benefit from expanding its toppings to include meat. Not that you should avoid interesting selection of veggie pies for the meat averse, but there's just no way you're going to get me (or a large population of the pizza-eating public) back to your place by offering up a cauliflower and olive tapenade pizza. Nail a delicious pepperoni? Do something interesting with some Olympic Provisions or Chop salamis?  I'll be there every week to try your rotating selection of new pies.Another issue with this place is the pizzas are very small. I didn't measure the diameter, but they're significantly smaller than I anticipated, especially for a $10 pizza. Whether or not you're into their unusual flavor combinations, I'm having a hard time seeing the value in this place.

Unless you're NBA height, you can't really see over the counter and see.3. The food isn't bad, actually, but the filling isn't distributed evenly throughout the burrito.

In addition they have some soups on offer which they prepare in the back.  I tried out my staple of lamb skewers.  They were reasonably priced at $1.25 per skewer, and were very tender.  They had just the right fat to meat ratio, and were generously sprinkled with cumin and chili powder.  A delicious snack!

Of course, I went with the 9oz (when in Rome...)For lunch, we started off with the edamame dumplings which were delightful. Five dumplings came in a light broth with edamame peas. It was very refreshing and a perfect dish for summer. I asked our waitress if she would recommend their TLT vegan sandwich or the grilled chicken sandwich and she said, why don't you go with the TLT sandwich and get a small portion of the salad on the side? I love when things work out just right! (When you order a sandwich you get a side, which is amazing). The LTL sandwich was absolutely incredible. The multigrain bread was delicious and perfectly toasted, the vegan 'bacon' was tasty, and the vegan mayo sauce it came with was incredible. The salad was fairly large for a side salad and came with a ton of chopped up manchego cheese in a delicious vinaigrette dressing. Our waitress was adorable, knowledgeable and very accommodating. She knew the menu exceptionally well, was very friendly, and upbeat and checked up on us a few times.

The creamed spinach was basically butter flavored spackle dotted with minute flakes of spinach. The steak tartar, with the obligatory raw egg, came with hints of plastic. The only redeeming dish was the eggplant fries, which were molten and soft in the middle, with a crispy light crust, and dusted with powdered sugar -- sort of like a vegetable french toast.

The location seems a bit weird to me, but perhaps devotees of this place and the burgeoning East Siders will keep the place filled. In case you missed it the first time I reviewed, CC serves vegan, some raw, all? nearly all? gluten free, and dishes specifically designed for the 'Engine 2 Diet' - if you google it you will see it, too, is plant-based.This time, since it was their official grand opening, I decided to spring for their \\"Pesto Rawvioli\\" - consisting of jicama folded over, topped with vegan pesto sauce and stuffed with cashew cheese, for $13. (Per the menu this is gluten free, soy free, vegan, and 95% raw).  Amazingly good, even considering all the things that it wasn't!  Since it was a 'plate', it came with two sides. I had the 'garlicky greens' and jalape√±o cornbread. The greens did not seem very garlicky and were just ok, but the cornbread was pretty good for gf, vegan cornbread. : ) Also, mild - which is fine by me. For dessert (and I was pretty full from the cornbread), I again had their super ,gluten free mocha 'cheezecake' - which is cold and cashew based with a nut date crust.  Also a really nice portion. I think maybe I shoulda just had dessert for dinner.I automatically detracted a star because their a/c was nonexistent, and fans were minimal.  I think I did notice some vents in the ceiling, but I'm pretty sure they weren't working. Could just be because the place is brand new it's not running yet. Or maybe they're just trying to save every dang bit of energy monies they can.  But unless you are a food trailer, in this town, I am sorry, CC - I will not return to sweat inside your place of business if I have a choice to eat elsewhere.  I might take it to go, though.... Also noted: zero ice in the water. If yer vegan and you know it, CC deserves to be on your list.

I went on a Friday and showed up around 11am. There was a short wait but you can't expect anything less in Portland. The above average places are popular and there's always excess demand. The wait could be anywhere from 10 minutes to 2 hours; pick your battles or just go somewhere else that's less tasty and subsequently less popular. Or go for the gold and prepare to wait!On that note, we had a 20-30 minute wait for a table. There were a number of families with kids there but none that were obnoxious, loud, or generally off putting. In fact, the families there seemed like regulars - one of the kids went straight for a hidden toy basket right below the welcome counter. Not gonna lie - I was impressed.While we waited for a table, I noticed that the entire back row of the restaurant was empty. I'm assuming they were a bit understaffed and couldn't clear the tables any faster but that's just bad business. I have no problem waiting if the place is full but I can't STAND waiting when there are at least 4 empty tables piled high with dirty dishes for more than 10 minutes. Maybe Slappy Cakes should assume the \\"bus your own table\\" model to help with turnover. It wouldn't be that unusual in Portland. As for the food, the pancake batter is really excellent. We took the waitresses suggestion and made smaller pancakes, dousing them with chocolate chips and shaved almonds. We then poured a little more batter on top to really seal em in there. When we pulled them off the griddle, they were fluffy, delicious and perfect. Definitely some of the best pancakes I've ever had (though that may be due to the fact that I got to choose how MUCH of a topping I wanted instead of receiving a mass of chocolate with a little bit of pancake). We also ordered eggs, sausage, and some biscuits with sausage gravy. The savory stuff was tasty enough but nothing to write home about. One thing that was a bit gross - the gravy had the most gigantic hunk of sausage meat hidden under its gravy goodness. It was a pale pink color...you know, like an undercooked piece of pork? After seeing that hunk, we pushed it aside and continued with everything but the biscuit. Am I glad I went? Yes. \\nWas it satisfying? Yes\\nDid it rock my world? No. \\nWould I recommend it?

We had a general idea what we wanted and she made suggestions which we accepted and we thoroughly enjoyed everything. Food: As mentioned, we thoroughly enjoyed everything. I got the meatball sampler with veggie, chicken parm and traditional meatballs. They were awesome. My wife go the Mac and cheese meatballs, which is not what it sounds like. They were very much Italian inspired and were brilliantly cooked. They are made with beef mixed with a very tiny rice like pasta and cheese melted in the middle. Just typing this makes me want to go back for more!! We have only been once, but I would safely assume the rest of the menu is equally as fantastic. For dessert (we were too full but had to try), the Cannoli was made fresh and was excellent. The portions are perfect. I was full and my wife took home some leftovers. Ambiance: Nothing special. It is kind of like a take out chinese with more tables. You do get seated and served. However, food comes out on disposable plates. Personally, I don't think ambiance defines the quality of a restaurant, this was okay with me.

Generous with the variety of ways one can relax as is made clear by the various styles of seating (elevated chairs and face-to-face vantage point booth and wraparound sofa booth). Generous with the wide variety of sweet treats in the display case (from pound cake, to cookies, to doughnuts. If you can't find something wicked to nosh on here you likely don't have a sweet tooth). Generous in the stylishness of the place (wood paneling with a splash of retro tile work.). This bakery had me thinking Swensen's both because it too ushered in this bygone era spirit of feeling like you've stepped into a time warp and because I recall a lot of wood interior there as well. Add some rainbow color ice cream store light fixtures and you'd have a discount version of it. I also got to thinking about childhood visits to the Marriott Hotel in Houston. Specifically I thought their in-house restaurant had this same decor. \\nAnyway, this is a restaurant review, not a freelance Southern Living article so let me run down the gist of my breakfast. I chose the Anaheim Scrambler. This dish contains bacon, green onion, tomato, avocado, and cheddar cheese. I did have to wait a little bit for the food to head my way but, since I was so blissed out by the breezy surroundings I didn't mind too much. One act of deception that merits dropping a star is the fact that the Web site says the scrambler comes with oven-roasted breakfast potatoes and harvest toast. What is in fact the truth is that you can select either the potatoes or a fresh fruit medley, the latter being my decision. Mighty want to consider full breakfast disclosure there. Would be helpful for any diners, myself included, who are trying not to be steered towards greasy variations of home fries as a side order. That's not acceptable if a healthier alternative such as a fruit is available. The other star I kicked to the curb was subtracted due to the fact that the portions are puny. I'm not asking to leave a restaurant feeling bloated. I just want to feel suitably fed. The eggs were fine. Not remarkable, but competently prepared. All of the flavors jabbed my taste buds without overpowering them. The harvest toast was acceptable. Lightly crunchy. Not an unfriendly experience. Just not one of those \\"The face of casual dining has been forever changed\\" sorts of experiences. The fresh fruit came to the table as a radiant mix of strawberries, cantaloupe, pineapple, grapes, and casaba melon. Agreeable. No more no less need be said.\\nThe nicest surprise was the pumpkin pound cake slice. At first I couldn't detect any of that comforting taste but after a few bites it came surging forth. It's moist, evenly flaky, and soft to the palate. \\nOverall I question the value of a $10.90 tab added up solely for a combo of items that wasn't ample enough to merit the cost, but at least Corner Bakery's leisure-themed heart's in the right place. I guess it's best summed up as a better place to meet than eat. At least I sense you're better served simply ordering a pastry or beverage rather than getting your hopes up too high for a large meal.

The location is poorly staffed for lunch hours, and seems like it's only open for people that do not have a job to return to. Often time there's only two people waiting tables, and by the speed of the food, I would guess there's around the same number of people in the kitchen.

He instead brought three of each oyster. I should have made it more clear, but good thing the oysters were delicious! The freshest/tastiest for my family. We also ordered lobster bisque (light and delicious) and clam chowder (a bit chunky). And lobster roll (not the best w a side of chips, cole slaw was good though) and bass (a bit overcooked). Paid about $180 for three people, we're still hungry.

It looked nice though so after poking around the shops(' windows) we headed back to AFB. Even though it was 2pm on a Sunday there was a nice amount of people, but quiet enough that we got a nice cushy booth.The restaurant is beautiful. Open, airy, lots of natural light from aaaall the windows. Has that hipster mixed with trendy vibe. Our waitress was... gruff? Maybe seemed a bit uncomfortable? While I don't like my servers to be TOO schmoozy/car-salesman-ish I do like basic courtesies like \\"how are you? what would you like to drink?\\" or \\"we're only a month old let me tell you about us.\\" But that's just me.To start, we ordered a kennebeck potato waffle. (a kennebeck is a type of potato- who knew). What's confusing though is that there is also a kennebeck potato waffle Benedict. We thought we ordered the side (just the waffle, $5) but were given the benendict (waffle with eggs, ham, cream sauce, and arugula) and were surprised when we were charged $12 for it.  Ah miscommunications. The benedict was totally delicious though, and would totally get it as an entree (the way it's intended) sometime. I've never had a potato waffle and that was special. I ordered the duck ham and cheese sandwich with blackberry mostarda (basically a jam, in this case) and a side of homemade salt and vinegar chips. Holy moly was that delicious. The duck ham was nice and thick and the cheese gooey. It all melded together so nicely with the blackberry mostarda. I purposely took home half of the sandwich with me so I can enjoy it again tomorrow. The salt and vinegar chips were perfectly crispy and had just enough bite.My husband had the Brasstown Beef burger. Brasstown is always a great beef option, and made for a really tasty burger. Nice bread, and the caramelized onions are a good topping. I'm curious to see if this burger will be on any \\"best of\\" lists- I think it's worthy! Great fries too, but the chips are more special so get those.While the service was lackluster, everything else was nearly perfect. It's NOT cheap, but you will get your money's worth. I'm looking forward to trying them out for dinner and cocktails sometime. I also want to belly up to the bar.

I decided to try The Smoke Ring due to its close proximity to the Georgia Dome (short walking distance, no problem even in heels). It is in a slightly sketchy area. I would not recommend walking there alone or at night. In my short walk there I past a condemned bridge with holes in it and witnessed a man drop his pants and pee in front of me. The interior of the establishment itself however, is very nice. It's very classic with a lot of hard wood. Unfortunately, the hard wood causes a large amount of ambient noises. It's very difficult to hear anyone who isn't in a seat directly next to you, making it hard to hear if your sitting with a large party. We had reservations, which after running five minutes late, they threatened to give up despite the establishment having absolutely no waiting patrons. However, in the hostess' defense, due to extreme under staffing, she was helping the wait staff take orders in addition to managing reservations. Although we told our waiter that we were in a rush, after bringing us our drink orders, he did not return to the table for 30 minutes and eventually another waiter helped us. We ordered, he promised he'd have the food out within 5-10 minutes (it's pre-cooked) and we did not see our food for a whole hour. During that hour, he never came back to the table, even though everyone at the table had empty glasses. However, when we did receive our food, it was absolutely wonderful with a nice smokey flavor. I ordered the pulled pork, my friends ordered the ribs and the brisket and we were all impressed with the food. The full rack of ribs and the brisket can each feed two people while the pulled pork is only enough for one. That being said we asked for the check the moment our waiter sat down our orders and we did not see the check for another 30 minutes. He then never came back to collect our payment so we went to the bartender to pay our bills. The whole ordeal almost caused us to be late for our event at the Georgia Dome, despite arriving at The Smoke Ring almost three hours in advance. All around, the food was phenomenal. I thought the prices were fair, my boyfriend and I eat for under thirty dollars, including tip. However, they are monstrously understaffed and as a result, bear the title of having the worst service I have ever experienced. I would only recommend The Smoke Ring if you're in the area, don't mind not being able to hear your friends easily, and aren't in a rush."},{"name":"Sam LaGrassa's","address":"44 Province St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"I live a couple of blocks away from SL and have been here several times.

Anyway for my main meal I had prime rib hash and eggs with paper thin toast that tasted more like a cold cracker served plain, no butter. My prime rib hash was missing the prime rib. The eggs were perfectly done and hollinadse sauce quite nice.

The server said they didn't have any SALT & PEPPER! It's fine if you're waiting for your next shipment to arrive, but maybe one of the staff could have ran across the street to buy some from the Super Valu to tie themselves over, instead of just chatting away with each other. She (the customer) was just as shocked, expressing out loud, 'you don't have any salt & pepper?!?'. 'Nope' was the answer, and the staff went back to their chatting among themselves.

There's a very high chance that you would have to wait in line out in the cold to be seated. Inside the restaurant, you can probably seat 7-8 parties depending on the size of the party. We were lucky enough to only have to wait for 10 minutes before we got seated. We decided to order the Squid Ink Pasta, Shrimp Scampi, Calamari Platter, and Clams w/ Linguine. We were planning to go for the Lobster Fra Diavolo but looked at the price tag and decided not to. They recently increased the price to $78 so to me it was not worth it. I rather try other things than not. Squid Ink Pasta tasted okay. There's a lot of sauce with it but I thought it was kind of bland. The pasta tasted very doughy. The Calamari Platter comes with a pretty decent portion and tasted pretty good. The Clams W/ Linguine is the best dish I had here. Flavor is there and the clams were made right. We finished this plate fairly quickly because it tasted so good. Last but not least the Shrimp Scampi. The shrimp had a lot of flavor to it and tasted amazing. They also serve their dish in the pan that they cook in to retain as much of the flavor as possible. Give this place a try but be prepared to wait in the cold.

Although the mango was very sweet and fresh, it was not enough to sweeten the rest of the dish for me, which was lacking in sugar.

First looks and tastes.  The food definitely looks different.  The old Chicken Teriyaki was almost like a kabab with multiple chicken balls, the new one is one sold piece that looks like it was placed too close to a blow torch (very burnt).  They taste alright, but definitely a down grade from before and a little more dry.  They also leave a slight gritty taste in your mouth.   The Beef is overly wet and drippy, equally chard like the chicken and I didn't know teriyaki could be that many shades of grey and brown in one thin stick.  They too are a major downgrade and leave an unpleasant aftertaste.  I actually tried each of these during the ride home and needed to stop to grab a drink.Everything else I tried was just average.

I quickly realized I could never retrace my steps. I was lost, deep inside Powell's warm literary embrace.Powell Books is romantic. With the chilly Portland weather, a bookstore escape in the middle of the city is my kind of perfect afternoon. Is Powell the best place to buy books? Perhaps not - their second-hand texts are pricier than your average used bookstore. But don't fuss about a dollar or two... let yourself get lost in the whimsy of words. Explore the never-ending, ceiling-high bookcases and find your One.But if literary romance isn't what you're looking for, a plain old quickie book-buy works too. Though massive, Powell is unbelievably well-organized and well-staffed. You can be in-and-out rather quickly if you're on a mission.Powell Books is a special place and comes in at a very close second to my other favorite Powell book palace, the Powell Library at UCLA.

I staked my claim on the last free table, also greenish, and, trying not to knock over a plant stand as I approached the counter, asked for a large coffee. The woman told me Cafe Ivy offers only small and medium, which led me to contemplate whether there could be such a size as \\"medium\\" in the absence of a \\"large.\\" I asked for the medium and also for one of the pre-wrapped cookies. I arranged myself at my table and tuned out the world. I opened my magazine.  I sipped my coffee. I tried to eat my cooky but it was so hard I could neither bite into it nor break it. The best I could do was dunk the cooky in my coffee and hope no one noticed my attempt to turn a stale cooky into biscotti. I stayed for about an hour but once the coffee was gone, I was not motivated to get another coffee or stay longer. The counterperson smiled and wished me good day as I left. I wasn't impressed with Cafe Ivy.  I found the basement claustrophobic and the attempt at a garden decor a bit off-putting.

I get in the restaurant and the hostess asks is everybody from your party here, I say my son and wife will be here shortly, I get sat and its roughly 10 minutes until my son and wife show up. But during those 10 minutes the hostess kept giving me dirty looks and was literally looking at the time as if she was timing when the rest of my party was arriving.

I want to tell the world....but Yelp will do! ;)  Fellow Elite Yelper Mia P. suggested this restaurant for a group dinner after we found out our first choice was closed on Wednesdays. She made a reservation for our party of 8 but you can easily walk in . It wasn't too busy.The restaurant is pretty spacious- one side has the tables with the bbq grill if you feel like grilling your own meats or you can opt for a regular table and order from a menu. Behind the front hostess stand was a t-shirt pinned on the wall with a big picture of Psy (of Gangham Style fame). I wonder if he is like Korea's Justin Bieber.  The menu was simple and had a  nice selection of appetizers, soups, stir fried dishes, mixed rice dishes (bibimbap), Korean BBQ, and Korean Chinese food to name a few. I love that they had the Korean name of the dish (in written Korean ) but a description in English along with a picture. Made it so much easier to order.    My husband and I ordered a smorgasborg of food but we were famished. The seafood pancake was a huge serving and really one of the best I've had. It had huge, pieces of seafood in the batter and you could really taste the green peppers. The spicy chili sauce that it came with was GOLD. I poured on top of my slices and slathered on. Yummy spicy goodness. That sauce, alone, was a hit among everyone at the table!   My husband ordered the egg drop soup but ,from his reaction, it seemed to be bland with no flavor.   Now the entrees we ordered are worth talking about. I ordered the chicken bulgogi and my husband ordered the regular beef bulgogi. Mine was a huge sizzling plate of huge pieces of marinated chicken. It came with a little bowl of sticky white rice and lots of yummy side dishes for garnishes. The side dishes were easily replenished by our server since they went fast. The obvious hit was the kimchi. I swear I could eat it as is. And apparently it's made in house which is even more impressive!  I also enjoyed the pickled radishes. Crunchy and spicy and strangely addictive.  They were all so great to eat alongside my chicken which was also spicy!!!  I easily had tons of leftovers but I think because I had pigged out on the seafood pancake.  I did notice that most of the diners in the restaurant were of Asian descent so I think it's safe to say that this is as authentic as you can get.   Our service was pretty prompt and spot on. The only things that I noticed were that as my husband and I were waiting for the rest of the party to arrive we were not offered anything to drink...not until everyone arrived. Also, there was no explanation of what each of the side dishes were. They just plopped them down like we knew what they would be. While these are not dealbreakers, I will know to ask next time as I am sure they would be happy to explain. Overall, great experience. It's not the cheapest of meals but you certainly get what you pay for. Gratuity was automatically added because of our big party which is more than fair.  This restaurant is a little out of the way but my husband and I already mentioned to each other that we want to go back.  Maybe next time we'll bring along some friends and take advantage of the adjoining karaoke bar that is part of the restaurant? Anyone wanna plan a UYE? :)"},{"name":"Infierno Bonito","address":"3954 N Williams Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"With all due respect to Quesa Brosa, the neighborhood finally has a TOTALLY LEGIT burrito cart.

The bruschetta is a little untraditional. Served in a pizza box, it is the size of a small pie, covered in cheese and tomatoes. While it was more like cheesy bread that resembled bruschetta, it was still amazing. I was skeptical of the Chicken Gennaro because I generally do not like a strong pesto taste, but the sauce is a nice blend of pesto AND marinara, which was suprisingly delightful.

I've sampled a few different dinner entrees, and standouts include the rainbow trout, which made me understand why people enjoy eating fish, and the buffalo meatloaf, which looks like dog food, but give it a chance! Their potato chips are amazing, and their complimentary snack of popcorn is genius! Also filling, so watch out. Their mac and cheese is fabulous, as is the polenta. So far, I've never made it to dessert  because I have to go lay down immediately after stuffing myself with entrees. And they kindly provide you with to-go boxes, because you could never actually finish a whole plate at the table unless you iz crazy. Ask me how many times I've forgotten my leftovers because I'm too full and buzzed.I feel like brunch almost necessitates a different review, but let's just say it's not the same experience as dining here for lunch or dinner. It's buffet, for one thing, and it's always, always packed. You really need to get there about 1 1/2 hours before you're actually hungry, but the bar happily serves up drinks while you wait (may I recommend a bloody mary?). The food is handicapped, somewhat, by buffet syndrome (lukewarm chafing dishes, inconsiderate patrons who don't pay attention to serving utensil etiquette, and some stinkers...lookin' at YOU, salad and cinnamon rolls), but then, there are some really great buffet items that are worthwhile. $16 for this brunch is a pretty good deal, and the drinks are also not terribly pricey, so if you're feeling gluttonish, this is pretty fantastic. The wait is just ridiculous though, so I wouldn't call this a go-to brunch spot unless you can get here right when it opens. Which, in the case of most people who link brunch, is doubtful."},{"name":"Weather Up","address":"1808 E Cesar Chavez St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"craft drinks.rare, high grade spirits.eclectic, classical venue.pricey."},{"name":"Basta Pasta Trattoria","address":"319 Western Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Carbs = happiness.

My first pricey dinner in Boston since I left in 1999 and has Kenmore Square changed.  A colleague recommended this oyster place, it was close to the other one...We tried to set up a reservation on opentable.com at 6:30pm for 7pm and they were booked until 10pm.  So we called and said to come on in.  It was a nice 10 min. stroll from our hotel but it took us 10 mins to get ready since we didn't expect them to welcome us. We get in and the bar is full, the lobby is full, my heart drops as they tell us that it would be 45 mins before we get a table.  So we sauntered to a niche in the lobby and very quickly a waiter offers us a drink menu to bid our time.  A  very attentive staff, nice first impression.  We go over their very descriptive bar menu and as we order, the waiter offers us an appetizer menu, nice again.  Before we can even get our drinks, the host said our table was ready, only 15 mins of waiting!  WOW!  My drink, a classic cocktail Sidecar, delish, so yummy while my husband settled on a We're escorted to a nice back table against the banquette seats and the tables are nicely spaced, no squeezing in between parties.  We soak in the view of the other happy patrons.  The back wall is full of oyster shells, nice decor.  A waiter comes to us and offer to get us drinks at which we informed him our drinks were coming from the bar.  The manager then comes to us and says, \\" menus but no waters, let me get that\\" .  She quickly returns and starts helping us with the oyster options.  My husband decides he's going for a half dozen, but half a dozen of what.  She quickly describes the difference between east coast and west coast oysters and helps my husband select 5.  I'm not an oyster eater so I'm eyeing the ceviche, they suggested the fluke crudo and I didn't regret.  Reminded me of sashimi but with citrus, so refreshing.  The oyster tray comes back with not 5 BUT 6 oysters, they let us try a Kumamoto!  The wonderful wheat sourdough was served along side cayenne butter.  Carb heaven.For our entree, I ordered the salmon and sides of brown butter cauliflower and honey biscuit, couldn't pick just one.  My husband picked the burger, medium.  As we relaxed and enjoyed our meal we noticed the staff preparing the tables and noticed the staff stabilizing the table with widgets, so attentive, before the party arrived.

I usually judge a ramen restaurant by the way they cook their eggs, so Kukai's definitely passed.  I tend to like thinner noodles for my ramen, so that's where a star was taken away.I recommend ordering the Chicken Karaage Salad over the plain chicken karaage.  The salad comes with 6 pieces of chicken and salad for $8 while plain chicken karaage is $6 for 5 pieces.

I wanted to sit up at the table, to lean forward and gaze into my partner's eyes and enjoy witty conversation, and let me tell you, it was quite a struggle! If management ever actually sat in those chairs, they would replace them immediately with something sturdier, something that lets you sit a bit higher at the table, something that lets you sit forward and be engaged in the experience.

Spittle flew from their mouth - small bits of potato glimmering in the afternoon sun, suspended midair.  As the beast was stunned, I ran as fast as I could until my breath wouldn't keep. Not today, social sports leagues.--------------------------------------------------------------------------LOL ANYWAY that was fun. Here's the actual review. This place is just your normal brunch spot except it's typically filled with people who just spent an hour taking softball way too seriously, or are about to.  There is a lot of booze under this roof. They sell pretty large fishbowl drinks for like $35 if you want to get drunk and diabetic at the same time. You can also add in a redbull to your fishbowl in case you want to have dead eyes before 2PM. They have a giant Moscow Mule with like 500ml of vodka in it - fun for the whole family! I haven't been foolish enough to try any of those, but hey, props to the Nook for not playing around. Probably thinks of itself as the last frontier - a classier alternative to just getting a baguette and a mason jar full of liquor and just getting drunk in the park. You know, that's fine. It owns up to it and the bar menu is extensive and averagely priced.The food is pretty typical brunch food. You got eggs, you got crazy eggs, and then you have frozen tater tots with crap on top called TotchosÔøΩ? I'm giving this place a 3/5 for the sheer gall of putting a trademark symbol on the portmanteau of nacho and tater tot. Redneck tatchos sound like something I want to sell subprime loans to.

Driving up to the hotel is a beautiful experience; the grounds are meticulously manicured with beautiful greenery all around.When you enter the lobby, you are taken aback by the beauty of it and the architectural details.  It is magnificent.  There's a stairwell near the elevators that is really amazing!  All the employees are SO nice and welcoming and pleasant; they all smile and greet you warmly.  Check-in was a very nice experience.  The self-parking lot is kind of far from the hotel, so a very nice kid gave us a ride with our luggage in a little cart - he was so nice and helpful.  (The self-parking situation is atrocious but I'll address that last.)  There is also valet parking (my advice - USE IT!).My room was normal-sized and nothing special; it wasn't any bigger than a regular hotel.  What made it stand out was the very comfortable beds and linens.  I think those sheets were ironed!!  It was so luxurious to get into that bed at night.  There was no frig in the room, but there was a little coffee pot.  There's a nice closet and plenty of storage space.  Pretty-much a standard hotel room with a lot of nice, natural light.  The A/C worked good - you want that in Orlando in the summer.The bathroom was far superior to any other hotel I have seen.  It was huge with a tub and separate glass-enclosed shower.  The sink was in between the two, and had beautiful marble countertops, and nice cubby holes to store your stuff.  There were plenty of big, fluffy, clean towels and high-end shampoos and soaps.The pool was AMAZING.   It was SO big that you can't even photograph it.  There is a shallow pool for kids, some little riverways to float on inter-tubes, waterfalls, a hot tub with a waterfall, and, no matter how many people were there, it would never fill up because it is so huge.  There are a million lounge chairs, and there's plenty of shaded areas, as well as sunny areas.  The pool is really a masterpiece.  Look at my photos; all the photos are of a different area of the pool.  And, the pool overlooks a lake.  Beautiful, really.  The landscaping around the pool is just gorgeous!There are restaurants (and a Starbucks) and shops inside the hotel.  There is fine dining, as well as other places to eat.  All are expensive.  The hotel is on a main road, so any way you drive about 10 minutes away from the hotel you will find shops, restaurants, etc.  It is closer to Universal Studios than it is to Disney World; but, neither is really far.  It's very close to Sea World and International Drive where all the Orlando tourist night life is.  It is only minutes away from 528, which takes you to I-4 or to the Florida Turnpike, and the airport.  It's only about a 15 minute drive to the big Florida Mall.  I am giving this hotel a top rating of 5 stars; it actually deserves more.  But, it wasn't without its issues, which I am going to address now.The hotel is EXPENSIVE.  Very expensive.  I would never choose to spend this kind of money on a hotel room.  That being said, I could get VERY used to the luxury; I would just never be the one paying for it.  My friend got a decent rate for a conference she was attending, so that was good; I was happy to freeload.There is a charge of $9.95 a day for the wi-fi.  But, in the lobby you can get wi-fi free (I opted for that; I wasn't paying for wi-fi!)  Pay for wi-fi - really?!Now, the parking.  The parking situation is a nightmare.  If you can afford to stay at this hotel, you can afford the valet parking - because the self-parking is where the hotel is totally lacking.  First, the self-parking lot is FAR from the hotel entrance.  Second, it's 18-bucks a day to park (seriously, with the price of the hotel, self-parking can't be free?).  Third, I went out for a few hours and when I returned, the lot was FULL.  There's an overflow lot, which I had to park in, and it's even a FARTHER hike to the hotel lobby.  Oh, and I'm not done complaining about the parking.  Your room key SUPPOSEDLY opens the gate to get you in and out.  The 3 days I was there, it NEVER worked.  And, not just for me, people were lined up every day trying to get out or in.  One day, they left the gate in the up position, so that was good.  On the day I left, I had to scream into a squawk-box to get them to open the gate.  The kid who rides around in the cart was VERY helpful, but he has a lot of chores and wasn't always there.  When I came back on the second day and there were no parking spots, he showed me where one was.  But, there was only so much he could do.

On a recent trip to Argentina as I ate my way across Buenos Aires I thought to myself what is this town lacking?  The answer is not much...but I missed my unique Portland blend of flavors.  Pok Pok is a perfect example of excellent flavors that you'd normally have to be on a street corner in Asia to find-yet here it is in Portland.  My advice to anyone who isn't already a regular (that number of people I'm sure by now is small): be adventurous!  Please try those items on the menu that are unfamiliar and you will be pleasantly surprised at the wonderful flavors you discover.  My first experience at Pok Pok was with a group of about 26 people-we were able to sample almost the entire menu.  Nothing disappointed.

Dal: Lentil , Tadka is a garnish and/or cooking technique used in the cuisines of India,  in which whole spices (and sometimes also other ingredients such as minced ginger root or sugar) are fried briefly in oil or ghee to liberate essential oils from cells and thus enhance their flavors, before being poured, together with the oil, into a dish. This is a popular food at road side Dhabas in India.Since most Indian truck drivers are of Punjabi descent, and Punjabi food and music is quite popular throughout India, the word dhaba has come to represent any restaurant that serves Punjabi food, especially the heavily-spiced and fried Punjabi fare preferred by many truck drivers.My Dal Tadka was a just perfect , thick and spicy as I would have expected in a Dhaba with 2 Tandoori Rotis and free Onion/Lemon Salad.

I finally did that on a Sunday lunch time. It was fairly quiet with just 2 tables being occupied. It was a sunny day and so the place was warm like an oven.

Some customers did sit outside in the end.I had the flat white and the Parker breakfast which was only available during brunch. The flat white was ok, still not really it but not too bad. I should have ordered an iced drink which other people were doing due to the weather.The breakfast was surprisingly good. It was so fresh (food was made to order) that I could believe it if someone told me it was literally farm to table. The vegetable omelette was nice except for it being too salty. I would prefer it to be no-salt so we could season it ourselves or for it to be just lightly salted. The bacon was crispy without it being oily. The sourdough toast was perfectly buttered and toasted, and served with a small dish of jam. That could be more generous. The salad was the winner. I generally dislike salad as I prefer my vegetables to be cooked. This salad was just baby spinach leaves and tomatoes with a light dressing.

Why? Well, for a few reasons. First, the reviews were great. Second, they were all organic. And third, the food sounded incredibly natural and wonderful. This proved to be a very good decision.Life Alive is a vegetarian cafe with an emphasis on \\"feeding the vitality of the world.\\" They strive to provide healthy fantastic food for people on the go, while honoring and protecting the environment.  Their website had a hippy vibe, which was the same vibe I got from the cafe. This is a good thing.When I arrived around 11:30 a.m. on a Wednesday, there was already a pretty long line. I took a look at the menu and was overwhelmed with the choices.  The concept was quite simple -- fresh smoothies, juices, salads, and bowls.  By the time I got up to the front, I was still torn and relied on their advice to help me choose. Then I sat down at bar-like table in front of the windows to watch the passers-by.The cafe itself has an island feel with its bright colors and plants scattered throughout. Its huge windows allow the sunlight to shine in and brighten the cafe. I loved the vibe. I ordered a Life Alive juice, which is apple, beet, carrot, celery, kale, and wheatgrass. Delish!For my entree, I ordered The Green Goddess and I absolutely loved it. It is a bowl filled with broccoli, greens, tofu, and sprouted legumes over brown rice. It had a flaxy nama sauce on top with fresh avocado. The sauce was light and absolutely perfect. I also loved the hard red and green sprouted lentils. There is nothing I'd change about this dish.This is the type of place I feel like I could eat at every day. The food is fresh, organic, and healthy.

I've never been to thailand, but like most people who are dining here--I've eaten a fair amount of Thai food, both good and mediocre. I've even eaten at thai restaurants that have used store-bought red and green curry paste....(why?) My god- I used to work with (at a restaurant) a Jamaican gentleman who would cook with, literally, a \\"bucket o' jerk seasoning.\\" There's a lot of crap and laziness out there.\\n    But Pok Pok (I believe--i've never been in the kitchen or anything) actually seems to take the time to make everything from scratch- and a lot of labor must be involved in all of that zesting, squeezing, chopping, grinding and pounding. This is a place where food is thoughtfully created and carefully crafted. This is rare, and why dining here is such a privilege. Why am I writing yet another review of this place? I'm just a tourist in PDX, driving up here for some relief from the culinary monotony of corvallis. But here's my take:\\n      First off: don't bring someone here unless they love spicy food. Maybe the kitchen is able to tone down some spices, but I'm thinking that any individual with a sensitive palate would be stuck eating sticky rice all night. \\n  Secondly: the service here could use some work--on my last visit, the couple next to us were snobbishly given instruction by the waiter: \\"Here is how you dine at Pok Pok...you HAVE TO order the sticky rice with the wings. THAT his how the dish is intended to be eaten.\\"etc. Even the food runner was giving  them pointers in the manner of a condescending 3rd grade teacher on how to eat their meal. But maybe they did need a bit of \\"how-to\\" \\"eat at a restaurant\\" guidance, since 10 minutes or so after sitting down they began discussing the separation of the fecal waste of dairy cows....? Really? While I'm chowing down on a wing?\\n  Thirdly: you will be waiting for a table!!! Like, 30-90 minutes or so.  The food, however, is well worth the wait. The wings of course are fantastic. The boar collar might be my favorite--it's got an beautifully complex array of seasonings that combine a kind of umami richness with lovely herbs, refreshing citrus and of course chili hotness.

The dish was delicious, but the skewer of shrimp came with the shells on which was a surprise and a bit of a mess to have to shell them herself.  (We were used to this from living in SE Asia, but not the usual method in the USA.).  My Pho Tai (beef noodle soup with rare slices of beef) was tremendous and good to the last drop.

This is a fair-trade, small business success story. It's a coffee house with room to relax; great for people to sit down and talk. They have great background music that changes with the moods of the staff, who are great, knowledgeable, and certainly willing to offer suggestions if you can't figure out what you want. I don't recommend getting in line without an idea, however, or you're likely to vex the others waiting patiently. Their Guatemala Antigua and Breakfast Blend offerings are at the top of my list. Their muffin-tops and scones are great in the morning, and their panini sandwiches are also something to write about.

Finale's is everything you probably expect in a dessert chain- a variety of standard desserts (molten chocolate cake, apple pie a la mode, creme brulee, etc.), a somewhat romantic/night-time atmosphere, and a selection of overly rich drinks prepared with milk, cream, and Kahlua. What irritates me about this place is that it is significantly overpriced, and the desserts are pretty standard. Additionally, this location (Coolidge Corner) and the others in Boston are very much lacking in charm, which you would hope for in a local chain. So, you're probably wondering why I even return to a place that is overpriced and lacking in personality...well, I had a gift card, so I figured I'd give it another chance. Wrong again! The waitress didn't realize that I wanted to use the card for my bill and simply ran it as a \\"points\\" card- i.e., so I could gain free desserts for future visits...Future?? I have decided that it is not worth it to return, even with a gift card. The service was also severely lacking, and we felt like we were being ignored for most of our visit. I get more attention from my dog, and therefore feel that it is probably more worth my time and money to prepare molten chocolate cake at home in the future- which surprisingly is not that difficult and worth the hassle of finding my ramekins and cleaning them out, especially if it means that I will not have to endure another trip to a lack-luster dessert chain."},{"name":"Smoke Ring","address":"309 Nelson St SW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"The food was impeccable.

All were cooked to a clearly high standard not unlike the nearby Thai Little Home and other great fancy restaurants in downtown Portland. Texture is abundant, and you don't have to worry if a slow or busy day will affect the preparation, because it definitely doesn't. It's virtually up to you how spicy you want your food, but even their lowest offering of a 1/4 teaspoon may be enough to ask water refills.During the quiet hours of the afternoon, the wait for a meal is usually around 10 minutes at the most, but on a busy day it can be just a little longer at 15 minutes, without any quality lost.

Initially it smelled good and seemed promising . Although I noticed their pizza pie is out of the ordinary. I didn't have the chance to inquire about the place or even look at the menu since the two employees who weren't even terribly busy refused to acknowledge me even though it was empty at that hour. One was extremely unhappy loading up the dry pizza pie, I noticed some strange meat on the pizza , maybe vegan meat or expired meat. And the other unhappy employee was looking busy in an effort  not to assist. I greeted them and they refused to greet me in return. It's extremely disappointing to encounter such awful customer service when the guest should feel welcomed. A business is able to continue staying in busy when guests pay .

I love bookstores, though, and I loved Powell's so much that I visited it three times on my first ever trip to Portland last week (5 days). The first visit was just to round out my arrival night, needing something to kill time near-ish my lodgings, that didn't cost an arm and a leg - or anything. I wasn't too into looking as much as I wanted to be, but it left enough of a mark on me that I returned the next day before I left for a drive to the Columbia River Gorge. Why? Well, I figured they'd have a nice journal, maybe a scarf, things that I could use on my drive. And, they did; I got just those items and a couple more, at great prices.My last trip was on my last night, Wednesday. I found myself engrossed in a book I'd never have even considered searching for, right off the bat: Vintage Hairstyling. Why not? But, in order to cover more territory, I pulled myself away and checked out a few more sections. I wound up picking up four more books that I had to stuff in my carry-on duffel bag. Worth it.The organization is sort of fun, if you're the type of person who likes wander around and be surprised. The used and new book concept was so cool. Perfect, even. I felt I was smiling the entire time I was there. If I lived in Portland, I think I'd be poor just for all the books I'd buy.

There was confusion so we had not made reservations originally. But the day we had planned to go we somehow found out that they do take reservations and made one. We ended up changing our plans for the day just so we can have brunch here. Before I talk about the food, I must acknowledge the owner and the staff. Such kind and wonderful people. The owner apologized multiple times for the delay despite our reservation. Upon apologizing he also realized that we heard so much about the honey biscuits and thanked us for mentioning and kept them aside for us because they were running out. Through out our experience he kept on coming to us and making sure we were enjoying. And the three plates were on the house, courtesy of the owner. Now to the food. We had heard a lot about the biscuits and they were definitely beyond my expectations. So buttery and flakey with the right amount of sweetness.  I ordered the black bean and chicken chorizo hash plate. I debated about getting it omelet style but figured I should do something new. This was alright. It was missing something that I can't think of right now but it was good to try the combination. The owner brought us out his jalape√±o cheese sauce which went really well with the home fries. I think that's why I ended up enjoying my dish more. Because I always need to have a sweet dish when I go out for brunch, I ordered waffles. Usually, I go for French toast but because the owner told us about their cooking process. First doing it in the waffle maker and then grilling it on the stove so it would be crispy on the outside and soft on the inside I was sold. I got the chocolate stuffed waffle with bananas and pecans. OMG. It was absolutely amazing. The taste, the texture, and the flavors were great. I'm getting hungry just by thinking about it. 2.18.17  I absolutely recommend going to cafe Luna! I know whenever I visit Boston again, I will definitely come back to cafe Luna. \\nBack at cafe Luna.

The gamjatang was really good! It's a lot more flavorful than other ones I've tried before, and they give a ton of potatoes and meat. A lot of the beef was more bone than broth, which was nice for the soup but really hard to eat. It's served on one of those portable gas stoves, so it stays warm the whole time you eat it. It's a really good price for two people to split, but you could honestly split between three people without anyone leaving hungry.

Twenty minutes roll by without so much as a hello from a server, so one of my friends stops one of the passing by staff to notify we haven't been served yet. He tells us our server will be with us shortly but a few more minutes roll by and we decide to switch to the other side of the restaurant in hopes of better service. We get a nice waitress on the other side who is fairly prompt so we were much happier. The food tasted different this time around however, so maybe there is a new chef? Gambas Bravas was unexpectedly salty and the hot mushrooms just weren't the same flavorful punch as in the past. The cold dishes can much later after our hot ones, for some reason...we had to ask about them after finishing the other dishes.

My boyfriend and I visited Portland between Christmas and New Year and decided to pay Pok Pok a visit one lunch time due to all the great Yelp reviews. Upon arrival there was a wait of about 30-45 minutes which we were happy to accept as it was a significant improvement on the night before when our estimated wait had been at least an hour and more like 1.5 hours (we decided to go elsewhere). When we were seated we ordered the following:\\n- mango cocktail (yummy but small for the price)\\n- apple cocktail (big, pretty good, but not as tasty as the mango cocktail)\\n- vegetarian papaya salad\\n- signature chicken wings\\n- vegetarian khao soi soupThe flavour of the food was reasonable.My boyfriend said the wings were tasty, but definitely hyped up. As for my khao soi soup, it was nice, but frankly I've had much cheaper curry soups of a much higher standard in plenty of other places. I found the amount of soup broth wasn't very generous and the crispy egg noodles on top, whilst delicious and authentic, made the dish awkward to eat (it would be good if they were cut a bit smaller so that they actually fit in the bowl and so that you could get your spoon in under them to get to the soup!). I also would have liked some more veggies in the soup, but understand that it may not be traditional for this particular type of curry soup.The papaya salad was great, and had a real kick to it, but again, it was served awkwardly with a big hunk of cabbage and I wasn't really sure how to eat that, so I just left it on the side, which felt like a waste.Service was okay, but I felt frustrated with the order that our food was brought out. When we ordered our food, it was clear that the salad was to share and that my boyfriend was having the wings and I was having the khao soi, but regardless of this the wings were brought out first, and laid out on the table as though it was a shared plate (2 hand cloths, plate in the middle of the table etc.). Further, it was annoying that the shared plate we did order, the salad, came out last and that my soup arrived after my boyfriend had finished his wings (about 15-20 minutes after they were put on the table) - meaning I didn't feel like we enjoyed the meal together at all. Instead it was just like watching each other eat. I felt like for the price of the meal, our waitress should have been more attentive and observed that I wasn't touching the wings and so maybe would appreciate one of the other two dishes being brought out quickly so that we could eat together and not feel like an audience for one-another.Overall left feeling very disappointed.

Although the restaurant was packed, my boyfriend and I were still able to hear each other and were treated like we were the only diners in the restaurant. I had made reservations 2 weeks in advance and still only had the option of choosing between 5pm and 10pm...so book early! The walk-ins were told the wait was 2 hours.I. BREAD\\nThe bread deserves its own section. It's rich, succulent, and comes with this BOMB housemade butter with honey and cayenne. Fabulous.II. OYSTERS\\nWe, of course, started off with some raw oysters. Our waitress was incredibly knowledgeable and helped us choose our oysters based on our preferences. The selection changes every day, but I suggest the Island Creek oyster and the Misty Point. The Island Creek is good for someone that doesn't like ultra briny oyster. My boyfriend loved it, but I preferred the Misty Point -- which was super rich and almost tasted like chicken broth (which is how our waitress accurately described it!). Also a good choice for brine-a-phobes, which is what I am.III. APPETIZERS\\nFor appetizers, we got the mussels with white wine cream, garlic, shallots, parsley, which is a mountain of mussels nestled in a creamy risotto-like dish and toasted bread. We slopped it up like deliriously hungry monsters. At $10, it was definitely worth it. We also had the oyster sliders, which are tiny sliders of perfection. A perfectly fried oyster nestled in spicy aioli on a buttered toasted bun. It's a little expensive at $4 a piece (they're tiny!), but the two bites it took to eat it were absolute heaven. We also got the much-hyped biscuits, which was the only disappointing part of our meal. it was doused in honey, and was supremely dense -- completely different from what I was expecting, and the overly sweet biscuit didn't fit into our meal.IV. ENTREE\\nFor the entree, we got the lobster roe noodles and the seafood casserole.  The noodles were delightful - the pasta is housemade and infused with lobster flavor itself. On top of the noodles rests an enormous lobster tail and braised ribs. YUM. My seafood casserole was like a delicious treasure hunt - I got scallops, shrimps, crab, lobster tail, and squid. Once I finished those off, however, the rest of the casserole was just tiny diced carrots and an overly salty broth. I would probably try something else next time I come back.Service was great -- the waiters, busboys, and even the floor managers were hounding the floor making sure everybody's eating experience was great. Our food took a while to come, but it was quickly solved when we checked in with our waitress!"},{"name":"Nori Nori","address":"6690 Roswell Rd, Ste 2110","city":"Sandy Springs","stars":"3.5","text":"This is my favorite buffet in Georgia.

They have a wide variety of sushi to pick from and they're all top quality sushi for the price. They have a noddle bar that serves udon amongst other hot soupy dishes. They also have a crepe area where you can ask the person working to make you a crepe. You get to pick different toppings you want on it with whip cream as well.

Not a great first impression to have oil laden bread with no vinegar since these were obviously pre-prepared long in advance so separation had taken place. Also the olive oil tasted very heavy and thick, not like an extra virgin oil.We move on to food and I had the ravioli with lobster sauce which you could see the droplets of oil separation in the cream sauce. Tasty but nothing to write home about.We also had the spaghetti and meatballs which was a smaller size portion of slightly bland meatballs and very little sauce on the pasta.Again great service but the food and presentation I am definitely not a fan of.

Anyway, the most memorable dish for me was the HORSERADISH CRUSTED SALMON with Lemon Dill Sauce. The flavor was outstanding. Obviously the dill goes well with fish but for me, the taste of the Horseradish crust perfectly complemented the salmon flavor that I knew so well and expected. It was not your ho-hum salmon dish. If I am ever in Austin area again, I would definitely go back to Moonshine... BTW... I think I might have 3rd  hard lemonade near end of the meal.."},{"name":"Habibi Lebanese Semoran","address":"6651 S Semoran Blvd, Ste 108","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"Although this place is delicious the service is horrible.

They keep it simple here; diners have the option of steak, turkey, or vegetarian burger with lettuce, tomato, mayo, and horsey sauce complimentary. Then add cheese (cheddar or swiss), bacon, and a couple other toppings on a pay-per-topping basis. Indicate whether you want that with their fresh fries or not (you probably want at least one order for the table). Proceed to anticipate the deliciousness to come while sipping on a cherry coke, vanilla root beer, or malt, then nosh on the best burger around. Did I mention the fries? They cut them to order, and fry them while your burger cooks. Guaranteed fresh.If that's not enough to get you to experience this place, the decor is sure to do it. 1930s styled fixtures abound. Everything is chrome with big rounded edges. Even the PA speakers they pipe the music through have a definite retro look. It's a fantastic place, so check it out."},{"name":"Basta Pasta Trattoria","address":"319 Western Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"I make lots of and am obsessed with pasta so I wouldn't call myself a casual pasta eater, just to preface.  Ordered takeout here on a lazy Sunday night, which I never do with pasta but was feeling brave. Brave because it's obvious that takeout pasta = carry-over cooking = mushy pasta, ew.  Held out hope anyway that peeps who do pasta would know to undercook to account for that...but not the case. Got the puttanesca with linguine and meatballs pomodoro with the homemade wheat radiatore. Both pastas were far past al dente despite picking them up promptly and opening them right away. The wheat radiatore was especially soft (probably exacerbated by it being fresh pasta), could eat it without chewing.  The meatballs were just edible, slightly burned on the bottom and not much flavor. The puttanesca was boldly flavored on the plus side, I appreciated that. However I will say it was a bit overly chunky, you could easily make out all the components in the sauce,  including chunks of anchovy and sliced onions. I prefer the anchovies melted into the sauce, I ended up picking them out because while I like their flavor it was over powering when you got a whole chunk. The onions just seemed out of the place. On another plus side presentation was nice. If I were to order again I would maybe try just ordering a sauce with no pasta and cooking my own at home."},{"name":"Lucy's On The Fly","address":"2043 South Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"I've been challenged to try one new restaurant a week in 2017.  I decided to start 2 weeks early and found myself at Lucy's On The Fly in search of Chicken Spaghetti.  All my hipster friends have been telling me I love Threadgills and Hoover's Cooking, so I need to try Lucy's.  I'll file this under my \\"I came, I saw, I tried\\" novelty, tourist-trap restaurants.  Similar to The Monument Cafe in Georgetown.  Everyone seems to be talking about it, but it never makes it to your weekly revolving restaurant list. 5 stars for the enticing menu options.  Everything sounded good. The Fried Green tomatoes. Mexican Coke Sweet Potatoes. Fried Deviled Eggs.  I pictured myself eating at Lucy's weekly.  Hipsters? Check. Country farm vibes. Check. They don't serve Chicken Spaghetti at this location. Ended up settling on 1 Fried Chicken Thigh, the Fried Deviled Eggs, a side of Mexican Coke Sweet Potatoes and Creole Okra. The chicken thigh was just ok.  I guess I'm low maintenance and boring, but I'd rather have a perfectly seasoned Original KFC thigh! Lucy's Fried Chicken is kind of like when your mom tries her hand at frying her own chicken for the first time. You love her, but there's no seasoning to the batter and it came out lukewarm.  The Mexican Coke Sweet Potatoes were forgettable.  Super-stringy and you can't taste the coke. They need a little more pizzazz, maybe some whipped cream?  I couldn't finish them. The Creole Okra was pretty good, albeit a little soupy, but no real complaints there.  The Fried Deviled Eggs were the best option I tried, love the seasoning used in the batter and it pairs nicely with the sauce. I'll be back to another location to try the Fried Green Tomatoes and Chicken Spaghetti, but I'm not in any hurry. A decent effort, but it didn't make it to my revolving restaurant list.

You are then seated and sometimes are offered complementary kimchi to munch on while you are perusing the menu. The kimchi is when you start to realize that Toichi Ichiban is different than other Japanese style restaurants in Boston; everything is done in a very thoughtful way to show off some of the best Japanese food in the area. The owner and chefs put forth the very best and fresh ingredients into even the sides that come with the meal: the soy sauce is home-made and delicious; the house salad is not your typical greens+orange-ish dressing you - instead, it is a mixture of different types of cabbage made in a home-made yuzu-soy sauce with seasame; and the complementary tea is an awesome home-made rice based tea.The sushi is among the best in the area; the fish is fresh and expertly prepared by a sushi chef who is passionate about his craft. We highly recommend the Omikase for two; you get 12 pieces of sushi plus a roll (which is usually a spicy tuny/spicy salmon roll). The actual pieces of fish are very generous, the fish is fresh, you often will get a piece or two of \\"specialty\\" sushi (such as \\"unago\\" - eel with a slice of mango on top, \\"yuzu salmon\\" - salmon marinated in yuzu, topped with a \\"yum\\" sauce and lightly charred, \\"tasty/organic salmon\\" - fatty salmon belly with \\"yum\\" sauce, etc.). Many reviews comment about this restaurant being overpriced; these reviews are based on the old prices at the restaurant and the new prices are actually cheaper than similar quality sushi restaurants.

The service, especially if you go into the store is so hit or miss. Today I went in and waited THIRTY MINUTES for fries and a milkshake. And when it was ready, the girl at the counter called out the wrong name, and went \\"Oh wait she's not here, never mind\\" and went back to her phone. I waited a bit and then went up to the counter; it took 5 minutes for anyone to even acknowledge that I was there and it was to tell me \\"Oh it's not ready yet.\\" So I ask about my order, it was ready, the order she had called out minutes before WAS mine and was given to me.

All the small things like spring rolls and viet. .coffee are so cheap, I never feel guilty adding those things onto my meal.\\n10.

All are pretty underwhelming.Was especially disappointed by the fish tacos. The chipotle aioli sauce was very mayonnaise-y with hints of spice, and the fish was overcooked.The enchiladas were very average and served with beans and rice that could have come out of a Chilis or a 3 Margaritas.However, the ahi tuna tacos were EXCELLENT.

Like so many other dining experiences it's a tale of two restaurants in one.  What do I mean?  The front of the house and back of the house are nowhere near the same the level of execution.At no time in my many visits was this more evident than last Saturday.  We stopped in for lunch and I knew pretty quick it was going to be an \\"experience\\".  We waited too long to be greeted and when the owner was walking us to our table she took the time to answer her cell phone.  When the owner does that it doesn't bode well for the rest of the staff.  We were sat in the outdoor patio area.  It's a really nice space open on both ends and framed by the brick walls of the 100 year buildings on either side.  We then waited, I used my watch at this point, almost 10 minutes to be greeted.  The server then had to take another 5 minutes for her to find menus.  Almost another 10 to get our drink order.  So we've invested almost 30 minutes to them at this point but still don't have anything in front of us.  This is not the first time this has happened by the way.  We perused the menus and made our selections and wondered how long we would continue to wait.  Mind you, the two servers were moving around a great deal but really accomplishing nothing at this point.  A for effort in motion...D for results.  Oddly our food came out quicker than our first round of drinks.  I had the Shrimp Burger.  I've been looking at for years but finally took the plunge.  Not bad at all.  Kind of a cross between a hush puppy and a crab cake.  They should make it thinner and change the bun.  It's too doughy to chew through at 1.5 inches thick and the bun was fresh but couldn't hold up to the mass of the burger or the tartar sauce.  My better half ordered the BLT Sea...a BLT with mahi mahi.  Again it was pretty good but needed more BLT and better bread.  Our companions tried the BBQ nachos which were good but had as much pork as chips.  Can't complain about the value but it was out of ration for nachos.  I almost forgot the mac n cheese.  This side dish is one of central Florida's best!  No one else comes close on the mac n cheese front...they make a simple layered cheese and fresh pasta \\"lasagna\\".  Almost makes it worth while.Part two...the front of the house.  Service here has always been slow but this was a new record.  It took 45 minutes from door to food at 1:30 on a Saturday!  There were 8 tables taken and all but one had already eaten.  I then proceeded to watch our server argue with a customer not once but TWICE!  She actually stopped to argue with her again as she was leaving!  I overheard both altercations and the woman wasn't abusive.  Never, never, never argue with a customer in front of others unless they're hurling expletives at you!  And then walk away and let management handle it!  Oh wait...never mind.  I've watched the owner dawdle around since they opened and she has no business managing.  She could double her business if she hired a real GM and got the hell out of there.  The kitchen does good enough work for people to return knowing the service is usually appalling.  They need Gordan Ramsay to stop by and raise hell with the FOH and leave the chef alone!

Unfortunately, the quality of service at this place has been going downhill lately, and while I generally try not to be too judgmental, what I witnessed a few days ago really got to me. Our party of four all got dirty silverware.  All four of us also got cups with a thick layer of tea stains.  While tea stains don't really make the cups dirty, they are not very pleasant to drink from.  I have never been to any other place that serves cups with brown residue on the inside.  As if this wasn't enough, one of us got a glass of water with lipstick all over it!  It was apparent that the glass wasn't even attempted to be washed.  Unbelievable!  As we were talking about the astonishingly low quality of service that day, we spotted a gentleman who had just sat down at an adjacent table pick up his fork and thoroughly wipe it with his napkin.   That makes it at least five people that day who got dirty silverware.I find it completely unacceptable that Finale started saving on dish washing.  It's too bad they have been degrading so much.

I was never a big fan of reading, but I used to love exploring bookstores when I was kid, back in the days before Amazon took over the book sale industry. It's fun to just skim through a shelf and flip through the pages of a book that catches your eye. Regardless of what your interests are or how much time you spend with books, there will be something here that grabs your attention.They buy old copies of books and then put them up alongside their new books. So unlike other bookstores like B&N, where all the copies are new, you will find good condition used copies right next to the new ones so that you can compare prices easily. The entire store, with all their rooms and multiple levels, is also color coded to help you find where you want to go more easily.Buying new books from Amazon is cheaper than buying from this place, however. If you're lucky you can find a used copy here in good condition for a great price and know what you're getting rather than take a chance on a used copy online.

SERVICE:\\nFrom the valet to the server, everyone was niceFOOD & DRINK:\\nHere's where the fall short... the food isn't that good. It's just not. I went from brunch today and was underwhelmed... I was choosing between here and Bantam Pub, but chose here for the drinks. The drinks though... were awesome. $2 mimosas that will get you perfectly lit for a nice walk in the park. I'd come here to pre-game or post game from another brunch. This place is perfect for that.Remember they don't start serving alcohol until 12:30, Georgia law, so this goes for all restaurants. \\nSUMMARY:\\nI wish this place had better food... simple as that.

Also, good coffee and food and reliable internet.  That equals at least a 4 every time.Soap Box (segment one):\\nI've noticed a lot of complaints about the service here.  If you are insecure enough to need positive reinforcement in the form of superficial enthusiasm and fake smiles from people who serve coffee and sandwiches, then maybe this isn't your place.  And there is a big difference between good service and \\"happy\\" service.  Good service is getting what you ordered, getting your drink/food in a timely manner, and getting correct change.  I think Thunderbird provides this nearly every time, and I've never thought anyone was actually rude or pissy.  \\"Happy\\" service is someone who smiles a lot and makes eye contact.  However, this says nothing about the actual quality of the work.  Some of the nicest servers I've come across spent most of their time enthusiastically apologizing for the crappy service.  I would have preferred scowls and competent service.Soap Box (segment two):\\nFinally, the Austin hipster bashing has become as predictable and annoying to me as hipster style and attitude has become for everyone who complains about it.  I have no tattoos, would never wear skinny jeans (to be fair I couldn't pull them off anyways), and do not keep up with the underground music scene.

However, on our recent visit to Austin, we obviously had to give Counter Culture a try and I'm glad I did. We started with the cheese plate, which had both cheddar and a hatch chili cheese: both were excellent, although I preferred the cheddar and really didn't taste a tremendous difference between these and milk-based cheeses, although the texture was more like a cheese ball. We then got artichoke dip, which for me was just ok, but I'm not a fan of artichoke dip; my husband, who is, loved it. For mains, we shared the raw shiitake burger, the raw butternut squash taco, a special bbq seitan sammy, and mac and cheese. The burger and taco were amazing and I loved the collard wrap, which was light and sweetish. The bbq sammy was good but a bit heavy for me (in fairness to the sammy, I was getting pretty full); I think I might have liked it more if it had less seitan and more slaw, or if it was a slider, but the sauce was dynamite. The mac and cheese also was great with a lovely bread crumb topping but I only had a few bites because I was saving room for dessert and I'm sure glad I did. I had the Aztec cheesecake special and it was spectacular! We also shared some chocolate banana pudding that was excellent, and the donuts, which while quite tasty reminded me more of truffles than donuts. The space itself is cute and service was friendly.

I stopped by around 7:45 AM on a Friday and there were no grab and go available i could eat except bacon or sausage or beans. (i am a vegetarian). The beans aren't cooked vegetarian so didn't try them. I chose a migas taco partially because I like spicy food and it was marked as such. Took about 5 minutes to make and once i opened the taco at work, it was clear there were no jalape√±os in the taco. It was not spicy what so ever. Quite disappointed.

Nook has an affectionate location and atmosphere. The restaurant has one of the greatest ambiances for a neighborhood restaurant and bar. The food is good, not great but they do take time to make special menu items. The tachos are fun, as I like they have the option of two different sizes. One size good for a side the other option is if you would like to share with others. The mood here is flexible, great place for a casual date or a place to go with your friends for a couple of brews. They have a great selection of mixed drinks and a decently wide variety of menu items. I adore the bacon infused bourbon drink. The location is one of the best being right across from Piedmont park. Can't say they could have done a better job of the architecture and decor in the bar. Parking here can get tricky, because it is limited but they do a great job making up for it through their valet system. The service has been consistently good and their restroom is the best one in Atlanta. Don't ever really comment about restrooms, but darn they have a nice private restroom. Beautiful sink, cool hand dryer, private, and always very clean. My time to go here is on a casual afternoon with some friends for drinks and some light dining. As a bar this place deserves 5 stars, the food deserves 4 stars. Again nothing incredibly special about the food, but it is consistently above par. Overall its always a pleasurable dining experience.

Their focus on farm to fork, fresh ingredients that are healthy but also tasty is a great concept. Our group felt the food was very flavorful, were decent portion sizes and you went home feeling full on food that you can feel good about. It is not fattening , they add flavor with spices and ingredients but not lots of high calorie food which is nice.I would say their prices are a bit high, which was the drawback to the restaurant. They do not have happy hour so you are always paying full price. Their drink list, although really good, is on the higher end of what I would pay for drinks and they are standard pours at best. My wine was $13 a glass which is pricey.We tried the grilled avocado, which had a wonderful sauce under it (on the smaller side, I'd say about 1/2 an avocado), bruchetta which was amazing, super fresh and delicious, the  chicken sausage pizza which has thin crust and great flavor, the Thai bowl + shrimp which was nice and spicy and the best thing we got, the seabass which needed a bit more sauce to flavor it up - but cooked perfectly, melt in your mouth, the ancient grains bowl which left you feeling like you made a healthy choice but was packed with flavor - the pesto in the bowl was great, would have liked a bit more of it to spread around the bowl.I highly recommend this place, everything i have had is cooked well and tastes great. Although a bit pricey, it is worth it to feel like you are eating good food that someone has put thought and energy into. Great outdoor patio as well (the train goes by on occasion which can be loud but you find after the first train you just kinda ignore it).

Place was packed. We were told an hour to 90 min wait. They had run out of buzzers to give us, but explained where the bars were (one inside and a patio one).  We found the patio one which is actually a building of its own. So stage is set. Now onto the review:\\n Despite the BUSY atmosphere, the two bartenders on the patio were awesome!  They managed the chaos well. We got great attention and recommendations. We decided to just eat at the bar since it seems comfy. Moonshine: Prickly Pear - blech not for this girl's palette. Catdaddy - amazing. Somewhat sweet, but not too much. They also have a fairly good selection of scotch (highlands) - oban, macallan, glenmorangie. Food: for appetizer - we went with the bacon dip and have no regrets!  It was delicious. Caramelized onions in the dip that had a bit of kick to it. We loved it, but the kick isn't mentioned in the menu so if you have an aversion to anything remotely spicy, I'd say go with something else.  It was mild but definitely there. Entrees: had the backyard chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries. AMAZING!  I'd suggest adding a little bacon if you go for bacon. \\nAlso had green chile macaroni. Really tasty, but be forewarned, it's a large portion. Great for splitting. If I had to critique anything about this dish, I would say that I'd like it better if the chiles were cooked all the way through. They had a little too much crunch for me, but overall the dish was great. Service: our servers were the hyper-attentive and working-their-@$$es-off bartenders Shelby and Blake.  In short, they were awesome.  They tag-teamed the space well and gave great recommendations on both food and drink. (It was not recommended that I get that prickly pear moonshine based on my taste, but I wanted to try it anyway so no blame there - but Shelby even fixed it for me by turning it into a blind mule after I said I hated it (the blind mule: not bad))!  Great experience. It was a tad loud, but that is to be expected on NYE.

The Island Creek oysters were quite good, though I enjoyed the salty tang of the Flying Point more. The Wellfleet oysters were large and meaty. The lobster roe noodles were good, but not amazing. We enjoyed each individual component of the dish (the peas were so fresh!), but thought the strong flavor of the beef overwhelmed the delicate sweetness of the lobster. The striped bass dish highlighted the freshness of the fish, but was a touch bland, and the cut of the fish surprisingly included a large portion of the undesirable grey fat part. For dessert, we ordered the strawberry shortcake doughnut. The doughnut itself was tough and chewy to the point that we wished we had a knife.My favorite dish turned out to be the buttermilk biscuit. Seriously, the best biscuit I've ever had. It was humongous and I could literally peel apart each buttery layer. The honey-butter glaze was to die for.  Our waiter was knowledgeable about the menu, attentive, and friendly, recommending oysters that perfectly suited our preferences and offering his opinion on the wine menu. Unfortunately, the wine he recommended had aged past its prime (a white wine from 2008) and we didn't have the heart to tell him so. I'd probably just stick to the cocktails and beers here (we wish we had).Overall, we had a good dining experience. The wait service was stellar. The lobster roe noodles were a novelty worth experiencing once, an the buttermilk biscuits were incredible.

Service: food is not super fast, but the waiters are really nice and helpful at making recommendations. The store did get busy and it was sometimes hard to flag them down, but this is understandable Toilet: super clean, they provide lime and mouth wash for you. I find this a nice perk especially after all the garlic you've eaten hahaFood: AMAZING (10/10) we ordered a combo bag of 2 types of meat - fresh claw fish and king crab legs in Louisiana sauce mild. The sauce was amazing, it has the perfect amount of spice and saltiness. It still has a bit of spice in it even though it is mild. It has plenty of garlic and compliments the meat just fine. 1 lb of king crab leg comes with around 5 legs, though. But it's so worth it and I would order it again. The meat is super fresh.Ordered 1/2 a dozen of oysters - it is very very fresh. And it was only for $13 which is not too bad. Ide recommend you guys try it if you are a big fan of oysters The fried cake was also amazing, I've never tried it before - the dough was so soft in the inside and crispy on the outside- I suggest you pair it with ice cream. I know, so fat, but so worth it.\\nWe ordered 3 sides- corn (inside the bag, makes it extra tasty), cole slaw, and noodles. I would recommend that the noodles should be separated from the sauce because the noodle itself tastes really good already. It has the right amount of salt and garlic, and I love garlic. I believe there's a bit of cheese in it but I might be wrong Coleslaw was also good, a bit sweet but the portion is a bit small for its size.Overall, great restaurant, clean and fresh food.

Everyone comes here for the wings (which were delish btw), but you have to open your mind and try some of the other stuff too!For our visit, we arrived on a Sunday around 6:45 PM. Our table was ready by 7:20 PM, which I didn't think was too bad. Love the texting when table's ready all of these Portland restaurants have btw, SF needs this!!For dinner, we ordered:1. Ike's Vietnamese Fish Sauce Wings - $15.50\\nI'm not going to talk about this too much since every other review talks about it. My opinion was that this was too flavorful. The tangy-ness sort of killed the roof of my mouth...it was weird and I can't quite put my finger on what it is exactly. 1. Muu Paa Kham Waan (boar collar meat) - $15.50\\nThis dish comes spicy, sauce over the boar meat, but I'm a wimp when it comes to spiciness so we had it on the side (offered by our server who was super nice!). The meat was tender and it comes with iced mustard greens to neutralize your palette after the spicy sauce. I thought it was a gimmick, but it really worked!! This was my favorite dish.2. Yam Makheua Yao (charcoal grilled eggplant) - $14.50\\nThis also comes spicy so we requested to have the Thai chilies on the side. This dish is really flavorful, but not to the point where it's overpowering. The eggplants are cooked just right and really soak in all the flavors of the dish.3. Hoi Thawt (crispy broken crepe) - $13.50\\nThis was a tasty snack, but I could skip next time. I felt like there was too much egg and not enough mussels in the dish. As described on the menu, this is definitely a night market food.Overall, a yummy meal and I would definite revisit next time I'm in Portland!"},{"name":"Weather Up","address":"1808 E Cesar Chavez St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Shockingly bad service.

I found my favorite brick and mortar bookstore! Only downside is that its in Portland and I'm all the way down in Orange County, so I can only visit when I'm visiting family up in the Portland area.  But they do have a website!!!! This place is called Powell's \\"City of Books\\" - and it really does live up to its name! The store occupies an entire city block and is several floors of sheer awesomeness (there's a few other locations in the area as well). Powell's is literally a book lover's dream! I can see myself spending days just perusing the massive collection of printed material. They literally have every genre you can think of available.One of the pluses that really stands out about Powells is that they have no qualms about offering both NEW and USED copies of a title on the same shelf. Most bookstores will only offer NEW prints - and sell them at face value. Powells offers the NEW prints - sometimes at a discount AND on the same shelf, USED prints of the title if available - at a much deeper discount. Sometimes you can even get a discounted USED based on the quality or how worn it is. This shows that Powell's is truly interested in offering you options and the best value for your money. Not enough can be said about the massive selection. In addition to two new titles I've never heard of, I found 3 rare out of print books that I used to read often when I was younger - and snatched those up (3rd one I passed on cuz the used quality was just too worn). For four books with a total retail value of about $50, I was able to snag for about $17.50 (OR has no sales tax) - all were USED - but were still in great readable condition. Honestly, I didn't think I'd still be buying physical prints now that I have a Kindle - but there are still a lot of titles out there that aren't in Kindle format. Anyway, I spent a few hours here since my time was limited and barely felt like I made a dent in checking out all that Powells has to offer. The rooms are each \\"color-coded\\" and they offer a map that sorta shows you where to find genres in general - however, the numerous helpful employees roaming around are also a great resource.

We arrived a little before 8 pm on Friday evening. There was a party of 11 of us, which I understand (having been a waiter in the past), that parties take a little longer than a normal 2 or 4 top table. They seat us, & our waitress comes over. The raw oyster bar is done for the evening. Ok, not a huge deal. The specials menu that we were given with our regular menu, also done for the evening; the waitress stated she didn't even know why they were given to us. Most of the draft handles for beer were covered with plastic cups, so I assumed they were out of those. I asked the waitress which Funky Buddha (not covered by a cup) was on draft, to which she replied \\"we're out of that\\". So I reworded it, \\"what is the beer 2nd from the left?\\" Oh, that is a pineapple beer (which is a Funky Buddha draft). Thankfully I could drink one round of that beer, but they ran out after that. My second round I asked what craft beers are on draft. The waitress replied \\"Bud, Bud Light, Miller Light, ummm\\"...really?! Those aren't craft beers. So I proceeded to ask what Kona Brewing Co beers they had, since they had signs all over the restaurant advertising the stuff. Oh, we don't have any more, she replied. So I stuck with water the rest of the meal.As far as food goes, it took over an hour to get our food. We all got our food except 2 of us. They both ordered fish & chips. The first fish & chips came out, but then the second didn't. We finally said something to the waitress about the order, & I guess they had to make the entire dish, which took forever. Most of us were finishing up our food by the time the second fish & chips came out. When we finally got our bill, we asked the waitress if anything could be done about the fish & chips that didn't come out until really late. She checked, & said she could give us a $10 coupon for next time. Well that didn't help any, because there won't be a next time, & we are from out of town anyway. She said she could get us 1 drink, but we were all ready to leave. That was all she could do according to her. Terrible experience. The only good thing I will say is that the food was halfway decent, & the comedy show was ok too, but other than that, find another restaurant to go to, this one just isn't worth it, both for the money & the amount of time you'll spend."},{"name":"Kevin Rathbun Steak","address":"154 Krog St","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"This place is crazy good.

The nice thing about walking into Island Creek is that it has a different feel from many Boston restaurants-- it's trendy and upscale and feels more like a NYC restaurant than a Boston one.  The service is friendly and prompt-- we came in at 9 pm and thought we'd have to wait an hour for a table, but it ended up being only 15 minutes.  We decided to get drinks while waiting for a table, but the area was cramped and uncomfortable, so do plan in advance if you want to eat here.In terms of the food, I liked mostly everything we had.  We started off with three different types of oysters: west coast Kumamato, east coast Spring Creek and Island Creek.  The oysters are fine-- not extraordinary about them, but just fine.  The small Kumamoto's are usually my favorite but they are priced high for what they are, so next time I'd opt for the larger, meatier oysters.  We also tried the famous clam chowder, which was not my favorite. It's supposed to be the best clam chowder in Boston, but the there is too much bacon and the flavor is overwhelming.  My main dish was the lobster gnocchi special, which is good-- not out of this world, but good.  We finished with the lime grapefruit sorbet, which was pretty sour but I enjoyed it!  We tried a few side dishes as well: the crimini mushrooms, spicy broccoli, and baked beans.  I'd opt for a great appetizer instead of multiple sides--they were okay, but the broccoli wasn't spicy enough, and the mushrooms and baked beans were average.  We probably would have been better off trying something more interesting, such as the crispy oyster sliders (will be on my list for next time.Overall, I'm definitely a fan of Island Creek Oyster Bar.

They also do catering so that's a nice option.  And you can't beat the price. For the amount of food it really is a bargain. Especially for meat dishes- you'd pay much more in an actual restaurant.

But for $120 per person, I would like more than fine, please. I would like my foie to come with the things the menu says it's coming with (actually, the fact that this seems to be a trend among reviews is less than fine -- it's really not OK at all). If necessary, I would like to be served a smaller portion and have it cooked perfectly. I would like my dining partner's beef carpaccio to be more than two thin slices of meat on a plate with cracked pepper and what is effectively a bread crumb. I would like my duck breast to come to the table warmer than room temp. And when I send it back and it returns to me just slightly warmer than room temp, I want to be checked back in with before I'm halfway finished. And I would like things generally to not be under-salted. I would like to be presented with a wine list that is less impressive in its size and more so in its contents; if you weren't aware of Bistro du Midi's corporate origins before, the bottle selection gives it away pretty quickly. To put it simply, Bistro du Midi seems like it's still hung up on the old guard of the restaurant scene, when Ripert and Bourdain weren't in everyone's living rooms, Americans didn't know Provence from Progresso and your ability to appreciate a fine dining experience was based on how big the bill was at the end of the meal. It appears as though the MARC restaurant group that owns Bistro du Midi has missed out on the local/artisan/affordable culinary renaissance that's been happening across America over the past 10 years and is still relying on a model that preys upon ignorance and an immature palate. I realize this all may seem a bit vitriolic, but I choose to drop that kind of cash on a meal maybe once every two months. When I do, I don't expect my mind to be blown, but I do expect proper execution and accurate menu descriptions. This time, I don't think it's an exaggeration to say that I feel like I've been robbed.

My partner's chicken ramen was also saltier than it used to be, which is a darned shame. I know they offer a less sodium option, but honestly, ramen should not be anywhere near the salt bombs we were served a couple weeks ago.

Also you get a free churro just for checkin in on yelp, but you need to spend at least $10, which can be easy if you buy 3 tacos.A friend order a torta sub and he chose one of the chicken flavours for filling.He also order a couple tacos. I ordered every meat flavoured taco pastor, carnitas, barbacoa, tinga, chicken mole, pescado, and their special feature which was steak with bell peppers. To drink i ordered a horchata I get them all the time. If you have never had one it is like a churro flavoured drink.I liked all the tacos they tasted great. I love the pescado, barbacoa, carnitas and pastor the best. The horchata tastes yummy. I need to come again and try a couple of their other drinks. My friend loved the torta sub and was pretty filling. The free churro was thin but it was free so do not expect a big portion.Taste good not hard or too soft.

Taipei101 is a great name as had no real idea what type dishes would be on the menu but there is a long list of items some familiar others not so which is what we went for! We arrived well before 12/Noon which turned out to be a blessing as didn't take long to get our order in & be seated. As we waited for our food the crowd grew very quickly & most have to believe are from the Chinese Island of Taiwan as they knew exactly what they wanted when they ordered which says a lot for the authenticity of the food.

My friends and I had a 7pm date so I got there at 6:45 to try to get on the list early.  No list when I got there, and although my party was not all there the waitress sat me at the last indoor table...sweet.Fish sauce wings were finger licking good..literally, I almost licked my friends fingers when I noticed they still had wing goodness stuck to them.  I ordered the salted plum tom collins to drink and although skeptical, the flavors all mixed together to form a wonderful taste sensation in my mouth.The main dish was chicken curry noodle soup and the chicken was so tender it was falling off the bone.  It was mild and a mix of peanut and coconut and was just sublime.Our server was attentive and had suggestions for a couple of us that had never eaten there before.  He never led us wrong and checked in to make sure everything was to our liking.  My drinks were kept full and we never had to wait long for anything even though the whole inside was passed.

It actually has an external door of its own, but that door is always locked, so you need to enter the restaurant through the market.  The restaurant name is prominently displayed on the outside of the building, but in hangeul only, so unless you read Korean, you might not know the restaurant name until you see it on the menu in Roman characters.I've eaten here many times, mostly on weekends, and tried close to the entire menu.  I have really enjoyed almost every single dish I've had.  In particular, I think Manna has the best bibimbap in Austin.  Another favorite is their nakchi bokum, a dish of stir fried octopus and vegetables in red pepper sauce.  My wife loves their sundubu jjige.  The quality of the entrees is excellent.  The only dishes I've found to be less than perfect are the galbi and the galbi soup - sometimes the beef is tough.You order at the counter, cash only, and take a number.  The restaurant has a very limited selection of help-yourself banchan, basically four kinds of kimchi: cabbage, radish, turnip, and cucumber.  On occasion, when the restaurant is not so busy, the owner has come around and offered us little bowls of mung bean noodles or free barley water, but only so often.  The restaurant has a very limited selection of drinks (cans of soda, water, tea, barley water), and no alcohol.  The decor is, well, very, very cheap.  It almost seems like a restaurateur must be willfully neglectful to come up with such a badly decorated dining room.This might not be the best choice for a first date or someplace to impress a client, but the food is excellent and a very good value for the price.

Parking was easy, but we were pretty early beating out the lunch crowd too. It is a bit confusing as to what building is where and how to get to them as this shares a stairwell with Fellini's and you actually have to walk AROUND the patio in order to get to the entrance. Confused? yep, I was too!There are signs that they only accepted cash and the cashier was nice enough to point it out to us again when we entered. The place is really, really narrow. Kinda reminded me of a fat man squeeze, but with smells of spiced meats grilling. We requested to sit out on the patio and service was prompt. We both ordered the cuban steak sandwich. It came with pretty good black beans (and I don't really even like beans but I ate these!) as well as fluffy yellow rice.The bread was a nice, sturdy piece. It gave the appropriate crunch when you bite into it. I hate it when people skimp on the bread, it's your foundation for your sandwich!! The only bad thing was that the kitchen assembled my sandwich so that all of the meat was on one side only. I actually prefer my steaks to be cut a bit leaner and smaller since there were huge chunks in mine that made it kinda hard to eat. But the flavor was right on point!"},{"name":"Life Alive","address":"765 Mass Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4.5","text":"This place was on my list of pre-approved places to try out while in town - the only thing stopping me was the price. I ended up going because a friend of mine's mom liked it and it got me curious. My friend is Asian; Asian moms don't usually like American places. I found myself there on a Saturday at around 5:30 pm. The place was packed. They take your order towards the back; the people waiting near the door are there to pick up drinks. Their smoothie and juice menu looked quite delicious (the prices are also up there but seems on par with another smoothie/juice place I stopped by so maybe it's the norm here). They take care of you one at a time which was great because I don't eat anything in the allium family and I needed to ask my questions and my voice doesn't carry well. The cool thing is that they can pretty much customize their choices to fit your needs and I could just sub out the sauce/dressing for either the sesame ginger or nutrition-lemon flax, both of which were safe. I ended up choosing the Rebel bowl because it had hijiki and seaweed is good for iodine with the sesame ginger (you also get to choose either Tofu, l√©gumes, or both). Then I decided to ignore the price tag and get a juice to go with it - the Elevate, upon the lady's recommendation. You then get a number and you find your seat either on that floor or the basement (yes it matters; the card or number they give you correlates to where you plan on sitting). It took me a while to find a seat on the ground floor; good thing I was only a party of one, but I ended up getting a spot right by where the employees congregate. It was a small table and though there is nice padded seating by the wall, I didn't want to squeeze in (pregnant here and finally beginning to show). Plus I made a heavy purchase at the thrift store down the street that was in my purse and I didn't want to hit my neighbor with it. I sat on the outside. I might have been in the way. Oops. My food came first, then my drink. I loved the bowl it came in. The juice came in a taller mason jar type container. The Rebel was great and though I was expecting it to be cool, it was actually warm - the dressing was mixed well into it. Technically, I make similar dishes at home occasionally but it's a nice change to be served food. I also don't dress my brown rice/quinoa. I am curious about their flax/lemon dressing though. It did explain a bit about why my friend's mom liked it; it's grains with vegetable sides on top, similar to most Asian meals. And it's healthy. The juice was good too - not too strong or \\"vegetable-y\\". The strawberries that were blended in helping make it a light dessert of sorts. My complaint with these juices was that a good 1/5 of the cup was foam. I tried to drink it, but I gave up when it became faintly flavored air bubbles and I didn't want to have gas issues later. The bowl is a good size but with the healthy, light food, I could have finished it if I didn't get some ice cream shortly before dinner. I decided to take the remainder home and sat there wondering how to get a to-go box.The employees weren't too friendly when they weren't tending to you, or maybe it was between shifts and they were distracted? Either way, the many people who passed by or took brief breaks between working didn't smile at all when eye contact was made and even that was rare. I also think it didn't help that their attitude changed completely when they were interacting with each other (fairly close knit there, which is awesome). Even when my food was brought to me, it was all business and barely a smile. Just: here's your food. Are you waiting for anything else? Here's your juice.I studied the guy sitting next to me. He got up when he was done. There is a section next to us with trash/recycling/compost receptacles and bins for dirty dishes and he put up his own dishes. Oh. It's self serve! I spotted what looked like condiments, mini to-go boxes, napkins, and plastic sporks as well! That explains it. I packed up my leftovers, put up my dishes and cup, grabbed a spork, and left. Also: there are two restrooms but you'll need a code to get in. I have some mixed feelings about Life Alive. The girl at the cash register was great! Everyone else? Not so much. There's no hi when you come in or bye when you leave. Food was good and I feel good for eating it - same with the juice. The atmosphere was nice though crowded and a bit noisy, which makes sense. Prices could definitely be lower. I paid $20 for my meal. I do like how they are promoting healthy food and minimal waste though and apparently that comes at a cost. The employees drink from glass cups when they need water, which I found nice. I struggled between 3 and 4 stars. It wasn't all that bad but would have been nice if things were explained to someone new. I bumped it up to 4. I would probably go back to try a smoothie if I find myself nearby again but we'll see if I'll be dining in."},{"name":"Moonshine Patio Bar & Grill","address":"303 Red River St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Great place and vibe.

We had a young girl who was not Korean and she was excellent with us so we made plans to come back and try even more dishes. Second time back and back with family..\\nDinner for Four:We tried the snail salad. I forget the actually name but it was a cold salad dish with snails in it. It was sweet and slightly acidic. Perhaps a bit too much onion and a bit too garlicy. I would have small portions with rice. Still, it is a pretty tasty dish except the orangy color may throw you off a bit when it is set on the table. Not pretty, but pretty okay taste wise.My boyfriendf's sister ordered for us and we tried this rice bowl with an egg in it. I hate when I forget names of the dishes, but this one was really good. Really, really good. Darn. I don't remember the name. Look for a hot spicy rice bowl with an egg in it. It was very flavorful and filling. I also tried the soft tofu or seafood chigae or tagae. Unfortunately, it was not as good as the kimchi tagae. I couldn't tell what the seafood pieces were and that is quite scary. It was also salty. I know from now on to order the kimchi tagae and avoid this dish. My boyfriend ordered also for us a spicy pork belly dish. This was a cold dish.  It was too much fat, pork belly fat to be exact, on a plate.  I think part of it being a cold dish made the fat less desirable. And the red sauce also made it less appealing since we already had a super orange snail dish before this one. We did not touch this dish much.  Back again...with friends this time\\nDinner of Five: Service was horrible from this elder Korean lady, which was not unusual coming from her, but for me, I always had the impression that the food would make up for the bad service so I was looking forward to the new dishes I have not yet tried. We had Korean BBQ. It tasted like I remembered it to be. Good. We had the beef bulgogi, pork bulgogi, and beef tongue. I hadn't had Korean BBQ from this place for over two years now and I have no complaints. However, after the meal, we were still hungry so we orderd some sushi. I do not recommend having sushi from this place. We had the salmon nigiri, the eel and avocado roll, the spicy tuna maki, and the salmon maki. It's hard to describe subpar sushi. The rice was not seasoned and the fish was not fresh.  It's going to be a while until I come back again.

Every year for our birthdays, we do an Atlanta steakhouse.  It's always Chops, Mortons, N.Y. Prime, or Bones.  Bones and Chops have turned into an old man's steak house that's boring with the over 60 crowd. Morton's in inconsistent due to it's \\"chain\\" status. I won't say anything bad about N.Y. Prime as I love it too.  Though, it never hurts to have an alternative steakhouse in another part of town.  I was immediately impressed by the interior of the place.  I like how they keep it dark and traditional while still modern with floor to ceiling windows and the decor. I'm also a big fan of their bourbon selection and the cigar bar, bringing back the \\"old school\\" feel.  As far as the food, while being pricey, is terrific. We had the porterhouse for 3 for $96. OUCH I know, but quite a sight to witness.  As somewhat of a self-proclaimed steak junkie, I can't say I've ever seen anything like this.  The waiter came out and carved the filet and porterhouse.  The sides of grits, HUGE onion rings, mashed potatoes, sweet potatoes etc. are pretty traditional. It will break the bank, but it is a truly world class steakhouse that perfectly blends old school with the new school"},{"name":"Your Pie","address":"275 Memorial Dr SE, Ste B1","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I like the concept of only having one size, one price (well, for most toppings), any way you want it. Food: It's pizza. I wouldn't go as far as saying it's delicious, but it wasn't bad. Nothing about the taste (sauce/crust which are the biggest things in my opinion) really stood out. I do like that they have several fresh ingredients available for toppings. Your Pie also has gelato and brownies! :) Atmosphere: It's a cross between a swanky pizza bar and a subway. There's one counter/bar and you go through the line and choose your toppings while someone builds your pizza for you. Once you've selected your toppings  they put it in the brick oven. It only takes a few minutes to come out. This Your Pie is located in The George, which is still very new. Fresh, airy, well lit... and there's free parking and plenty of seating.

The bulgogi is always a must, both the beef and pork are excellent. I love their Chinese inspired Korean dishes as well. Their sweet and sour chicken is a nice change from what I'm used to.

No hints of acidity, just the full flavor of a very fresh brew. The chai is also decent, although it could use a little more spice (read: kick.) The cookies are delicious, and cheap for the size (think small dinner plate.) I sampled the oatmeal raisin, but they had a few other selections as well, including a rich peanut cookie, or so I'm told. Peanuts make me die. Neither crisp nor gooey, they are the perfect consistency to break apart and share without creating a pile of crumbs. The cream cheese brownies are also little bites of guilt and delicious.The real bonus here is the availability of seating. There are couches for conversation, high tops for a quick lunch, or regular tables for getting some work accomplished. There are larger areas for groups, and single chairs if you want to be alone with your iPod. If you're out for a stroll in the common, it's worth the short walk.

I definitely won the attention that around. They gave you a whole lobster and quite a few of mussels and clams. The quality of the seafood is quite high, definitely fresh seafood. The sauce is very hearty, with lots of garlic and a little spicy. I prefer lighter sauce, so this sauce is a little heavy for me. The portion of this dish is huge as well.

My friend who lived in Thailand  for years ate here and told me it was amazingly like what he eats at his favorite places in Thailand.Now if a big sloppy generic plate of Phad Thai, thin Tom Yum (zzzzzz...), typical Thai fare is your thing, then you may not like Pok Pok.   I don't think Pok Pok ever aimed for that particular market..  So what's to resent?   \\"Doggone it, It's just not cheap and generic enough.\\"  Yeah, the wait is long, they are popular.  How dare they?  The prices are in the higher end, therefore we are all snobs and suckers.

Go early, get a seat, eat with friends and share the plates, it's not that  hard to get out of there without the glassy gaze of sticker shock.    Or just stay home, eat your instant ramen and fume.

Not really surprised when we went during prime dinner time it would be a 45-60 min wait. The restaurant was part indoor and outdoor seating in what looked like two houses turned restaurant. I prayed we wouldn't sit outdoors since it was freezing even with the heaters (and I'm not a stranger to cold since I come from SF). The decorations were cute, with lights strung outside and going for that thai/viet theme. So those chicken wings were the whole reason why most reviewers go to this place and it wasn't spectacular to my friends and I. It's not any San Tung chicken (SF local) but if you order spicy it has a kick to it that just messed it up for us. The fish sauce was obviously used but I would cut down on the fish sauce. \\nThe Glass noodles were yummy though and my favorite dish in the whole night!! It was flavored just right but the downside is that with the size of the clay pot you would expect to be getting more noodles. I would get it again but would have to order 2 to have enough for 3 people. \\nThe last thing we and was steak salad which I have to say is decent but on the sour side. I get that most thai larb salads are like that but Ive also been to places that can balance the sour salad dressing just right to not make it overwhelming. Which is where the steaky rice was recommended for this dish and was what helped with the dressing. The steak was cooked and seasoned just right at a medium rare and as a meat lover was my favorite part of this dish."},{"name":"Mitchell's Steakhouse","address":"45 N 3rd St","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"A review of 10 Rotten Oysters. Food Poisoning, do not eat their seafood even the appetizers. We were celebrating a birthday milestone for my sons 21st. The five of us ate the Oysters Rockefeller and two of us got violently ill for two days. We were also going to the Buckeyes Spring football game, however, those plans were dashed when my wife and daughter could not leave the hotel room. We contacted the manager and he told me that they keep the Oysters for 10 days...well Mr. GM, this was the eleventh day! If you end up going there, just make sure the manager isn't calculating your check! The manager also said there was nothing he could do and referred us to their corporate HQ in Dallas, Landrys. He couldn't even credit us the lousy $20 bucks for the Rotten Oysters. If Landrys empowered their restaurant managers maybe they wouldn't need a \\"Risk Manager\\"...hmmm. Anyway, I contacted the HQ and spoke to the risk manager, she asked me if we went to he hospital and \\"got a doctors note\\". Really? I wasn't filing a personal injury lawsuit, I just wanted a credit for the food two members in my party deposited in the hotel toilet. Suffice too say, since I didn't have a \\"Doctors note\\" they didn't do anything or even call me back. I got some form letter that said sorry we can't do anything. I even sent a nice email to Tilman Fertitta who is the CEO of Landry's....I know what you are thinking, what a waste of time. W'ell the only reason I did that was that he bragged online about how he  checks his email daily and responds to all the emails...well Mr. Fertitta you missed this one! And now you lost a great customer! I could have been saved with an apology and maybe $100 credit. Btw, the dinner was over $500.

I've traveled extensively eating in new and unique places for the last 6yrs, and this is by far top 5 in terms great food, and #2 when it come to great Thai food.  Sorry, LA has got nothing on this.

First time, so it took a look around the plaza to find it (nested amongst other restaurants and shops). There's a broad sidewalk in front that wraps around, with wooden benches to sit on. Since I was a couple minutes early, I was able to get on the Nail Salon's wifi a couple doors down, while waiting outside on the benches. Enter into Com Grill and you're met with upscale, nice lighting, and professional service. Hostess stand took my reservation and we had to wait until more than half the party showed up to be seated. Waiting area off to the right of the door, nice couches, a bit hidden away from the seating area, so it's relaxing.  After being seated, our waiter mentioned their Sangria and white Sangria, giving us samples of the white, which was \\"topped with champagne\\" and had bits of apple in it. It was pretty good, but they didn't have it available in pitchers (only glasses), so we opted for some white wine instead. Thanks to Yelpers, I got the mango/papaya salad, which is listed as Com Goi Salad. Vietnamese goi salad is actually a bunch of veggies chopped up into thin strips and mixed together with a vineger-y sauce. This one was sweet and strips of apple and other fruits - I didn't see any papaya or mango, but tasted them so maybe it was a sauce. Salad tasted really good drowned in the fish sauce it comes with. Or else it'll taste lacking and bland to the palate. Entree was the Flat Rice Vermicelli, which was thin white noodles steamed together and served with grilled pork on top with roasted peanuts. Served with spicy fish sauce, yummm. Add rice paper and lettuce for an additional $2. Dip the rice paper in a bowl of hot water, so it softens, put it on your plate, add lettuce, add some noodles, add the meat, add some cucumber. Roll it up, spring roll style. Dip it in the fish sauce and eat up! Super yummy, recommended as a home meal with plenty of people.Friday night filled up with people pretty fast, but emptied out after 9pm. Live salsa music with a small band in the corner created a great atmosphere for chatting. They dim the lights to different levels throughout the evening, progressively lower as it gets later, I think. I love the mirror on one side of the wall - it makes the place feel bigger and gives off great lighting. Great place, prices are pricey for what you get, which accounts for the missing star, but dishes taste good and presentation gets 9/10 stars. Oh yeah, awesome service.

These were big chunks of fried potatos, crusty with, I dunno, something good.And free donuts!  The menu makes it look like they only come with bennies, but not so.

The menu was, well, interesting.  Certainly Americanized for a Mexican restaurant.The positives end about there.I ordered the Zanita's Signature burrito and queso cheese dip. The cheese had the consistency of thick nacho cheese, but with an exorbitant amount of spice. And the chips were mediocre at best. The burrito was a true disappointment. The burrito came out with cheese on top that had obviously been microwaved. This destroyed the texture of the tortilla and everything inside! When I confronted the manager about this, he simply put the blame on the owner and chefs and didn't seem at all worried about my opinion. He also made us aware that they did not even have an oven in the restaurant!!!! My friend ordered some tacos that came with rice and beans. Both of which were completely destroyed by the massive about of lime juice, not to mention the rice was overcooked which left it with a mushy texture. My girlfriend ordered the veggie nachos, which were simply chips, nacho cheese, onions, tomatoes, and an overload of jalapenos.I predict a grim future for this restaurant, unless they can tap into the market of old Del Taco customers.

We will not be back. I'm appalled with the manager, Craig, and his attitude. A group of friends went to celebrate St. Patrick's Day. Most local establishments are celebrating today as it is Saturday, instead of Tuesday on a weeknight. On the table, there was a St. Patrick's Day Celebration advertisement (which did not include a date or time, only referenced a celebration) on the table with Guiness, Guiness Blonde (which is not listed on their regular menu)  and Irish Car Bombs. We ordered off this special menu multiple times and pointed to it while ordering. We assumed since the Guiness blonde was not available on  from the regular menu that it must be the day of the special. After receiving our bills, we learned this was not the case. We asked to chat with a manager to see if there was anything we could do. At that time we were scolded by the manager saying we should not assume what day the celebration took place. He talked down to us the entire conversation and was unwilling to agree to understand where we were coming from. He was abrasive and even used the phrase \\"I'm not trying to be a dick.\\" Unprofessional. At the end of the day, he did take honor the misleading advertising. However, with how incredibly rude he was, we all have left with a bad taste in our mouth.**UPDATE***\\nI felt I should update my review as ethical business owners should be recognized.

I also took issue with the fact that says she mean really what is sushi and give me the impression that it would be more than just one piece.I had to ask the waitress a few times for clarification because it seemed quite unclear in the way it was laid out. We each ordered one drink. Even given the fact that we were the only people in the restaurant, the waiter still managed to mix up our drinks. This amazed me. Despite the issues ordering, I did find that the sushi was quite good quality and tasty. I had the Victoria roll which I would recommend. It is around $6 but comes with salmon and avocado topped with tempura. Never seen it before but I'd recommend it. My last issue was with the receipt. Even though this was a restaurant, the receipt was clearly from a dry cleaning business. On the back of the receipt it detailed garment damage liability just like you would see at a dry cleaner. I have no idea why this was the case, but I can only hope that this is not a dry cleaner's second attempt at running a business. I've never seen it before even at the smallest of small restaurants. Parking is pretty easy and the location is convenient. I actually do like the restaurant on the surface (location, cleanliness, selection, quality).

The owner/founder lady was incredibly rude and made my recent visit very uncomfortable.  She forced us out of our two player table and harassed us to leave after finishing a single game.  I don't think I'll be coming back again because of this experience.  On my recent visit I went to play with a friend (2 people).  We arrived around 5:00, which is pretty early.  Since we're both board game novices, we asked the owner/founder (a lady who I had never met before) what two player games she would recommend.  She seemed overall very impatient and frustrated and more concerned about making sure we swiped out cards at the iPad for the $10 cover charge.  Previously, I had gone in larger groups where the barista would show us what games were available and briefly explain them before having us swipe, in case we didn't seem interested.  She recommended Splendor, which turned out to be a great choice.  We got to sat down at the two seat chess table by the window, which is by far the best spot in the cafe.  Our first game ended up being just about two hours long and finished around 7:00.  The owner sat at a table right next to ours on her Macbook pro, and kept giving us mean glares and looking over our shoulders every 10-15 minutes, like we were going to steal pieces of the game or something.  This unnerved me quite a bit, as I didn't know what I did to upset her.  After we finished, the owner immediately hawked over to us, took the game away from us, and then asked if we were going to stay and play another game.  We were not immediately sure yet, as we wanted to take a bathroom break and see what other games were available.  What really upset me was that she then got very rude when we said we were staying to play another game and instructed us to move to a much smaller table in the back with two tiny stools, so that her friend could take our table by himself.  When I tried to get a larger table (really any other spot), she protested saying those tables were for larger groups.  This did not seem right, as there were several two player games going on at the larger tables.  At this point we decided to leave, since it was clear the owner did not really want us to stick around any longer.  The only pros of this place are the ambience / environment and the large selection of board games.  The ambience is really the best part of this venue and the only reason I'd ever consider going again.  Otherwise, the owner is incredibly unfriendly and the cover charge of $10 is not justifiable.  If the cover charge included a free drink/meal, I think it would be OK.  Realistically, we've ended up playing some of the same board games each time, and so in some visits you pay more in cover charges than it would cost to buy the game outright.  Try out a few board games on your first visit then buy these and play them for free at any cafe."},{"name":"Decca","address":"Charlestown Navy Yard, Bldg 10","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Stopped for lunch.

I was really excited about coming back here (been here once before, very nice fresh seafood in a beautiful dining space), particularly for the special occasion of my graduation from fellowship with my parents and boyfriend flying in from out of town. We had made a reservation that coincided with red sox game day, and my parents are terrified of the Boston parking situation, so I assured them that Island Creek had a valet service so they wouldn't have to think about it. Come the day of our reservation, we get there and were told, \\"the hotel next door reserved all of the valet spots, so we don't have it tonight\\". No indication on their website, no w.arning that we would have to spend half an hour struggling to find a spot. One maitre d' was apologetic, the other was stone faced and rather rude about the whole situation. If you are in customer service, please serve the customers. If your website says you offer valet service and you do not, that is your fault. Unfortunately the saltiness of this interaction tainted the rest of the night. Our server also seemed distracted, and it was a near impossible task to make eye contact with him - I literally had to wave and shout at him to take our orders. Food is a 5 star experience for sure - fresh oysters, loved my lobster roe noodles, which is highly raved about on Yelp with good reason.

There wasn't really anywhere to sit/stand while waiting without being in anybody's way- the restaurant is very small. However, service and food were amazing! The servers were so quick despite every table being full. Included with our meals was a large loaf of bread and seasoned butter (delicious!), and our choice of soup or salad. I'm a picky eater, so I got a plain salad while my significant other got the white bean soup. After realizing how tasty his soup was, I instantly regretted not getting it as well. The waitress was happy to bring me a bowl, even though I had already eaten most of my salad. She also brought me refills of my drink before I even had to ask, which was great!Now this is where I made a mistake- the bread and soup were so yummy and filling that I was only able to eat about 3 bites of my dinner when it came  But the amount I was able to eat without stuffing myself was great. Fresh, homemade fettuccine was hearty, with a great texture and buttery taste. Homemade pasta really can't be beat! Cream sauce was yummy as well. I got the Chicken Moretti (breaded chicken & fettuccine) and it was perfectly seasoned, slightly crisp, and juicy. My SO got the breaded veal with pasta in red sauce. I tried it, but wasn't a huge fan. I definitely prefer the chicken over veal, and white sauce over red. He was very happy with his dish though!The portion sizes were also VERY generous, unlike some Italian restaurants in this price range. Absolutely worth every penny.Overall, we received prompt, friendly service and excellent food.

Really, really good. They clearly train their people *very* well. Yes, it's expensive, but when you're staying at this level of hotel the prices are to be expected--so I'm not going to gripe about the $18 vodka on the rocks--it's just how it is and you're going to have to accept that. (See also: Parking, wi-fi, room service, etc.)I appreciate a hotel where: \\n--The staff listens for your needs. We had a situation where someone--offhandedly--mentioned a request that hadn't been fulfilled yet. A passing-by staff person made a point to check on it and address it even though it: A. Wasn't in his area of duty B. Would have been just as easy and even acceptable to pretend like he hadn't heard it. \\n--Problems are addressed without hassle. There was an issue with my check-in and check-out dates in a filled-to-capacity time block. It was no problem. I didn't have to worry about it and I didn't feel like they were subtly accusing me of making a mistake or anything. \\n--Rooms are clean and the showers are pressurized and hot (hush, when you travel a lot you get to appreciate an instantly-hot and appropriately-pressurized shower).\\n--Everyone goes above and beyond. Seriously friendly staff. I mean, really. There was no problem that couldn't be addressed. There was no request that wasn't met with a smile and an eager offer of assistance. The doorman remembered who I was and welcomed me back after an excursion.

It is like a real life version of Cheers for people with small children. I am not going to lie and say the service is always like that of an upscale restaurant. If you expect that caliber you should probably have rethought having kids or hire an nanny to match your D&G diaperbag. Any mistakes with orders is completely overshadowed by the fact that this is a place where you and your children will _NEVER_ have to worry about getting glared at for the kids acting like kids. Also the staff will just take it in stride when your sleep deprived brain makes it difficult to tell them what you would like from the menu. Speaking of their knowing their sleep deprived clientele, the iced teas are HUGE and bottomless.$5 for unlimited play in an attended play area?  Any parent can appreciate that value. Watch their website and get on their Facebook group or email list. It is not uncommon for them to run a half price or free play specials. With 2 restrooms there is seldom a wait. Full changing tables are in both. Not those wall mounted tips of the hat but full changing tables. I love that they went for a nice warm decor in the restrooms and didn't settle for white tiled industrial.My small issue with them is the lack of electrical plugs available for customer use. I don't see how they could get around this. I certainly don't want them to raise their prices so I can plug in my laptop. Be aware this is the case if you do bring your electronics.

Sometimes when I walk into Powell's, I feel like I need skinny jeans, black glasses and an ironic haircut in order to fit in.   There are lots of um \\"hip?\\" people at Powell's, but there are also lots of just normal people too.  I think the coffee shop part of the store is kind of pretentious, but usually I'm not there for the coffee.It's really fun to get lost in Powell's.  When you get deep into the store it gets super quiet.  The bookcases are GIANT and SUPER tall!

This restaurant has his ups and downs but because it had more cons than pros I am giving it a 3.Pros: friendly and fast serviceCons: bread came out cold, does not offer any ice so my water was lukewarm, has no soda fountain (which btw the waitress did not inform us about) so all sodas were in a small (approximately) 6 oz glass bottle that cost $2.50 with no refills and no air conditioning when the restaurant is cramped and all seats are directly next to the hot stove, CASH ONLY!I personally did not like the black pasta but at least now I can say I've tried it. My friends liked it though so its more of a preference thing. I also got the combo (clams and calamari) red pasta which was good but I think Antico Forno's pasta thats down the street is much better.

I had always been curious about the place since in writing their menu made my mouth water every time I walked past their quaint location in the Pearl. My first impression was made when we were seated. The cushioned chairs, while beautiful, were covered in grime. I almost wanted a napkin to sit on. I ordered the Wild Mushroom Scramble with Leeks and Ch√®vre. It sounded amazing and I was really looking forward to it. What actually came out did not live up to the description. The eggs were watery, when scrambled the texture of the mushrooms turned to rubber. I could hardly taste the leeks. The ch√®vre, while adding a necessary punch of flavor just sort of ran into the eggs contributing to their runny texture. When I doused my plate with hot sauce it tasted pretty good, but it was nothing spectacular. If I had paid the full menu price I would have been more disappointed. For $9.50 the portions were small. I did not leave full, and usually I never finish what's on my plate!On a positive note, the server was excellent and the toast was fantastic.

This second time I ordered Khao Soi with chicken which is a coconut base curry noodle soup. The soup was rich and all the sides that accompanied it (pickled vegetables, shallots, and chili paste) really enhanced the dish. We also tried the famous chicken wings and while I will admit that it's an expensive dish, I'm glad that we tried them! They really are great and have a unique flavor.

Its food is also chic without being pretentious.  One on-line review calls its food \\"playful\\", which is certainly true, but I think Moonshine's food deserves a little more credit.  I also sensed great dedication and seriousness.  Certainly, IMO, it's not easy to re-manufacture the familiarity and ease of Southern cooking in new and enjoyable ways, yet still keep it easily recognizable.Moonshine is in a big old house on the N.E. corner of Red River and 3rd.  The interior is cozy and comfortable, foreshadowing the food.  We got there at something-to-ten Sunday morning and the line is already to the corner and beginning to wrap around it.  The door opened soon thereafter.  The place easily seats everybody with room to spare.  However, by 10:30 or so, the wait was already up to twenty minutes.  By the time we left, around eleven or so (I eat slow), the wait looked to be about half an hour.I loved the small touches such as the whipped herbed cream cheese for the (toasted) mini bagel halves.  The accompanying smoked salmon is touched with dill and each piece lovingly rolled into little bundles.  I'm a sucker for little touches like that;  they make all the difference.Is Moonshine \\"authentic\\" Southern cooking?  I don't know what \\"authentic\\" Southern cooking should taste like.  It's probably like barbecue or chili:  everybody has their own idea of what \\"authentic\\" barbecue or chili should taste like.  In any case, I don't really care what \\"authentic\\" *anything* tastes like.  I only care if it tastes good.Pluses:\\n95% of the dishes were good to very good.\\nI like the \\"Ball\\" Mason jars used as drinking glasses.Minuses:Parking:  there is valet parking for $4.00, else it's street parking (AFAIK), which gets quite scarce within two blocks of Moonshine.Omelets (brunch):  I didn't care much for the ham & brie omelet and the steak & blue cheese omelet.  They're on the dry side.  The ham and steak don't make for good omelet fillings, IMO, as they toughen up too much with cooking.  Also, the omelets could have used a bit more moisture, perhaps a touch of cream or milk, and a bit less doneness.Update:  a second visit with a friend from out of town also impressed.  We had the much talked about beer battered asparagus appetizer:  definitely worthwhile.  I had the \\"Japapeno Hanger Steak\\", also very good.  My wife had the Broiled Rainbow Trout and our friend had the Crunchy Coated Snapper.  All were well done and tasty."},{"name":"Powell's City of Books","address":"1005 W Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"Loved visiting here.

While the place is classy, and a bit pricey (especially the wine), it is definitely not snooty. It has a great Boston personality, the wait staff was friendly and welcoming, and we were seated right away.To the highlight of the meal ... the oysters. Not sure if it is the aphrodisiac making me say it, but these will always keep me coming back for more! We split a 1/2 dozen oysters fresh from three different MA locations, and they were extremely flavorful. I cannot pretend to have any idea on how to judge seafood, but we loved them!Next up ... the Lobster Rolls! One of the better lobster rolls I have ever had (but let's be honest, I really prefer more butter on everything). That said, it was light, airy, used big chunks of lobster meat, and came with a great rosemary bun. I recommend it, but I might try something new on my next trip.Finally ... the wine (how did I not start with this!). I hate rose - and the waitress recommended one and promised I would like it. I was of course immediate cynical and apprehensive. I was wrong, I admit it. The rose was fantastic, went incredibly well with the seafood, and a bottle later, we were merrily enjoying ICOB. In the end, I definitely recommend it for a nice night out as a couple or for a double date.

Being a recently graduated Berklee student, I come there so much (during the peak of a semester, maybe four times a week) that every employee there at least recognizes me and knows my usual order (a large Pho Thai with an avocado fruit shake - no extras) and some of them know my name and a bit more about me. It would be at odds with my behavior to give less than 4/5 for a place I habitually come to so often. When I have to make business stops back into the Berklee area, I don't think about where I'm getting lunch/dinner. I love pho, and I like their pho. I take people out to eat here regularly.It's worth your money. Everything on the menu that has been brought to me or a dinner partner has looked and tasted very good.Now the nitpickiness.This is not a criticism of Pho Basil, just a story about my personal expectations as they were leveled against Pho Basil.I am from the Seattle area, and I think both Seattle and Boston - from an objective comparison to other cities - have an enormous amount of Vietnamese places. This has only increased as we seem to now be seeing the same kind of boom in pho joints that mainstream America saw in teriyaki places over the previous half-decade before that. However, the places I grew used to in Seattle are uniformly cheap-o and dirty. With a few exceptions, my compass has been, the sketchier-looking the place, the huger a \\"large\\" size bowl of pho is, the cheaper it costs (sometimes like $3.25 for a bowl that is like the size of a salad-tossing bowl!) and the better it is, from broth to noodle to meat cuts.This rubric has failed me in Boston because it's totally inapplicable. Outside of Chinatown (of course), It seems every Vietnamese place here is dim, with fancy decor and uniformed employees. When this place first opened, I was quite excited that there was a place that served pho closer to me than Pho and I. So I first came when they had their initial business boom from opening and I was bummed out that it was \\"Boston expensive\\" for food that was \\"good but not great.\\"But you will see this pattern across all of my reviews of New England businesses. Things are more expensive here and... \\"less good.\\" Pho Basil's opening was one of my first times sort of noticing this pattern.But don't let the last three paragraphs of nonsense weigh down your choice to go here or not; pretend they didn't exist.

The fried chicken was crispy and the batter had great flavor. The bacon was extra crispy. And the gravy was had a pop of spiciness that helped with the fat heaviness of the dish. They also roast their own coffee. I got the maple vanilla latte which was incredibly sweet but tasty. The espresso flavor still came through though and I want to try their regular latte next time to get more of the coffee taste.

Their souvlaki is the best I have had, and most importantly, it's consistent! I have been going here for at least 9 years and their souvlaki is always tender, flavourful, and satisfying. Their chicken is hands down the best I've ever had. To be quite frank, I hate chicken. Out of all the meats, I find it hands down the worst. Specifically, in most \\"Western cuisine,\\" unless it's deep-fried, I find chicken rather bland, dry, and poorly textured. Olympia's chicken souvlaki is none of these things. Through some work of magic they have created a poultry dish that I actually CRAVE. Their other dishes are also very good. I love their pizza, their baked pasta dishes are tasty, filling, and reasonably priced, and their spanakopita is perfectly crispy around the edges. To top it off their service is always great and it's always pretty fast to get takeout if you don't want to sit in the restuarant. I've never had to wait more than 15 minutes, and it's usually 10.

BUT it wasn't as impressive as I thought it would be. This place is definitely overhyped.Luckily we didn't wait too long to get seated. We came around 4-5pm and were seated right when we got there, so if you're not tryna wait come off hours. The servers were really nice and attentive, I'd give them a 5/5. The atmosphere man I felt like I legit was in Asia cause I was seated outside with my boyfriend. Cute little water pitchers and brightly patterned and colored plastic table covers like in Asia haha! I kinda felt like I was eating back in Hong Kong during vacation, cause during my whole meal me and my guy were swatting flies away from our food the whole meal. Otherwise it was cute, I just was annoyed I was tryna enjoy my food but worried about defending it from flies. Foodwise, they recommend eating family style (and I'm Asian so I already do lol), so we ordered 3 dishes. However the portion sizes were small, at least for me, and the food was alright. We got the following:- Ike's Vietnamese Fish Sauce Wings: 1/5 hella salty and one of their famous dishes but if you've ever been to San Tung in SF the wings are waaay better. I couldn't even finish this dish. I'd skip this!- Kai Yaang: 3/5 I meeaan it's half a roasted chicken that you dip in sauces... nothing special. I guess the sauces were pretty good. We ordered the sticky rice that they recommend with it and what else can I say?!! Rice and chicken was basic lol.- Muu paa kham waan: 5/5 it was a small portion, but it was the best dish I had there. It was slightly spicy and paired well with the chilled greens they served with it. If you wanted to go to the place and try something, get this!!Price was a little expensive for what you get but since I don't think I'm ever going back to Oregon it was a one and done thing.

We printed out from their app the exact specific ingredients for each burger - I even wrote on them to make sure it was crystal clear. But nope - still screwed up.

When I finally managed to find the bacon on the bottom on top of a brown smudge that I assume was an attempt at putting on bbq sauce - still not sure on that one - there were a couple of anemic little slivers of bacon.  Not nice whole strips of bacon like they show on their website and menus. No. Teeny little scraps that you can't even taste.  Never did taste the bbq sauce.

The cold cole slaw counters the semi spicy chipotle taste. Mmmm! The pastrami is dried cured beef seasoned and then lightly smoked. Each sandwich comes with crunchy pickles that are not too salty. The sandwiches are huge and I had to take half of it home.Overall, the pastrami DID make my taste buds go crazy and I was very happy with it.

My husband and I went on a Tuesday afternoon around 1pm for lunch. We got really lucky and found street parking (2 hours limit) just steps from the restaurant. Across the street is the famous Mike's Pastry. We went with two of their most well known entrees. First we ordered the lobster fra diavolo for two. This has 1 1/4 pound lobster that is halved, mussels, little neck clams, and baby squids in it. It is cooked with linguine pasta with a spicy tomato sauce. We asked for spicy and it was not spicy at all. I ended up adding addition red chili flakes from the table. Everything but the mussels tasted fresh. They must have gotten a few bad ones in the batch. We also ordered a full sized entree of black pasta aglio olio which is a squid ink pasta with ground squid and a garlic olive oil sauce. We asked for extra bread to dip into the sauce because it was that good. The noodle was cooked al dente and I actually liked this more than the lobster. The restaurant is very small with about six tables. It is not ideal for groups larger than 4-5. The larger the group, the longer the wait. If you travel as a pair, be prepared to share a table with other customers. There is very little elbow room. The waiter was absolutely friendly. I can't wait to go back and try more of their dishes.

Consistently their tea served table side is very very watered down.  No, it's not from the ice melting.  It's almost like water.  However, the last time we placed a large order to go all the tea in the containers was very dark.  What's the difference?  Tea served table side is in a dark container so it's not possible to see the density unless you look at what is going through the straw.  However, when you order jugs of tea to go they are served in a light container so tea density is easy to determine.  Conspiracy theory?  Maybe, but there is certainly a pattern.

I sat at the sushi bar and in a lot of sushi places the chefs are really nice and try to interact with the customer, but at this place they did not even smile and ignored me, which is fine as long as they make the sushi tasty. However, I sat there for over 5 mins waiting for anyone to approach me until finally the sever came to greet me and she was disgruntled and I guess she was having a bad day,anyway she tried to be really nice towards the end but pretty much ignored me throughout my meal. The sushi was good, it was not great or bad. I had a sushi combo with a variety of tuna, salmon, shrimp, yellow tail and eel. It also came with California rolls.

LOVELY. A lot less confusion. Also to my imagination last time, I think I said 35 people can sit here? Who am I kidding?? It is  realistically probably at 15 because 7 tables that are kind of situated awkwardly. I really don't suggest you to bring your whole crew here unless if its like an off time non lunch hours. This time we still got the porky bell over rice, mince pork over rice, spare ribs lunch box and chitterlings (nice word for pig intestines). The porkbelly over rice comes with mince pork now! I am positive it didn't before - according to my own picture. If you want extra rice the $2 mince pork rice is there for ya. For my taste buds, its still not seasoned enough. Chitterlings. OH Chitterlings. You must try it. Just close your eyes and swallow. Its super tender and has no fowl taste. It is served with hot sauce on the side and a type of sweet sauce all over with ginger and cilantro. TRUST ME! AND of course we over order and decide to add a lunch box - Spare Rib lunch. The ribs were falling off the bone and tender but by it self it wasn't marinated/seasoned enough. If ate with the sauce, its better. The box also came with green beans, lomein and rice with mince pork over those items. FYI - If you're not a fan of pork - they do put the mince pork on a lot of stuff. Still a cheap lunch place to stop by for a bite. Service is friendly!\\n \\n(One more thing if the owner is ever reading this - please consider the environment!! All of the Styrofoam is HORRIBLE!

So guess what I ordered ONLY one dish, so I could quickly eat and leave! Whatever happened to good service these days.We ordered the shrimp linguine with red sauce and in all honesty it was alright, the shrimp was good but it would have tasted the same anywhere in Boston cause of the quantity, freshness, and prevalent seafood in this city and sauce that was premade already. Only slight difference is that it came out in a pan instead of a plate. Overall not very remarkable in taste.This place was super dinky with a few small tables.

You think it's the Nutmeg State, but it's really Home of the Diner. The place is chock-a-block with them -- Greek diners, Italian diners, Irish diners, retro diners -- we got 'em all, and some of them have been there so long they've become landmarks. My people know diners. Allston Diner is not a diner.Really that's the only reason for two stars. They would have gotten three, with encouragement to try for four with some needed improvements, had they called themselves Allston Cafe. Before you get all riled up over my opinion of the name, let me explain. In 2011 or so when a banner went up on the side of the building where Grain and Salt had been, all in turquoise and comic book font, advertising the coming of the Allston Diner, we were so happy. Allston didn't have a proper diner! We used to have something close on Harvard Ave, but it burned down, and the Breakfast Club is fantastic but a further walk. So imagine our excitement to be getting a local diner. It was a bit odd that the banner proclaimed it voted \\"the best diner\\" in Allston, given that it hadn't yet even opened for business, but we didn't tug too hard on that thread. Eventually it opened, I want to say a year or so later, in 2012.You know what a diner is for? A diner is where you and the cast go for midnight pancakes after the show. A diner is where you meet your friends for burgers & fries & milkshakes. You can get a patty melt at 6am or an omelette at 6pm. The coffee is strong, hot and always flowing. There's pie & ice cream sundaes. There's doggie bags.You know when you're not a diner? When you're open for 7 hours a day, 8am to 3pm.When you have posted a strict rule limiting customers to groups of four or less. When you run out of coffee and people need to wait for a new pot.When you don't have the stuff on hand to make the most classic of diner fare, a Reuben.When you don't do burgers. And when we asked about it we were told \\"too many people were ordering them and they got tired of making them.\\"When you just don't feel like packing food to go.No pie. No ice cream.No milkshakes.Sorry guys, protest all you want, but given all of that, this is no diner. The hours? Who is this place for?  I'm looking at all these reviews and wonder why people have so much free time during the day. Are there really enough unemployed vegans for Allston Diner to make rent? 8am is much too late for the construction guys who breakfast at 5am to be on the job by 7am. Too late even for office workers who're already on the road if not at work already. And closing by 3pm in a town like this, that really comes alive at night, is so weird. For a diner......if it were called the Allston Cafe, I might be saying this is an odd but charming little place that looks like it was decorated from the books and toys found in someone's childhood bedroom, that serves breakfast and lunch only, and has a decent menu with a few standouts. The biscuit, the Autumn Salad and the Grilled Portobello Caprese Wrap are great. The eclectic menu includes some southern fare (brisket, chicken & waffles), loads of omelette options, and plenty of vegan choices such as seitan, vegan flapjacks and tofu scrambles. That's all true. So go, if your schedule happens to line up with their brief day, and if you do not set your expectations for a real diner."},{"name":"Life Alive","address":"765 Mass Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4.5","text":"I am normally a huge carnivore, so I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed this place.

I've tried probably half the menu already, and although it may be difficult to choose because everything seems so similar (they're all just a huge mix of vegetables), I've never been disappointed.

It is my hope that they fire and train a whole new staff and reevaluate their overpriced lunch menu.First of all, it's clear the place is staffed for the sake of having people there to take your order. These people are essentially robots that perform the task of hearing your order, inputting it into a machine, and exchanging your money. Beyond those functions, they are worthless. This is particularly true as on our recent visit my friend asked \\"What's in the chili\\"... to which the snippy little man behind the counter responded \\"uh...chili\\". Okay guy in the dirty Spinelli's t-shirt, I understand that you're not the \\"chef\\" most of the time and that your probably not used to explaining what's in the food served at the restaurant you probably hate working at but good god she could have a food allergy or something and your rhetorical, idiotic response did nothing but draw out the time we had to be inside your shitty establishment. Upon further prompting, the little man agreed that whatever is usually in chili is \\"probably in our chili\\".What a dumbass.The only pro of this place worth noting is the speed at which they get your food to you. It's fast, but now you'll see why.All the food looks so prepackaged it's actually disturbing. The pickles even come individually wrapped as if taken from the shelf of a grocery store and placed directly in your bag... a colossal waste of money and resources. The sandwiches are so so so bland. The chicken salad looks like chicken and mayonnaise mixed together so well that it turned into a homogeneous ball of white glop that tastes like eating cotton. My friend ordered the hummus sandwich and was shocked to find that hummus made up about 1/6 of the size of the bread. Pathetic.2 of my friends ordered soup. 2 of my friends hated the soup. Enough said.This place seriously should not exist...

The pickled veggies on the side helped cleanse your pallet from the saltiness, and I had to add other veggies to get all that saltiness taste out of my mouth. Now if that wasn't already bad, my wings seemed undercooked. The inner parts near the bone (and it's not even that deep into the meat, as these are wings...) were still red. Not pink, but red. Peeling that layer off and seeing the bone, you could tell it was undercooked with the blood stuck onto the bone. Saving you some graphic details of bathroom adventures, let's just say the next day wasn't a good day for my stomach. I wouldn't come back for the wings, nor would I recommend the wings to anyone. I guess if you still decide to go... here is a tipTIP: order to go! save yourself the long wait and just get it to go.

Fragrant, piquant, smooth and satisfying are the words that come to mind with a mouthful of phanaeng curry. Sauces have the perfect consistency, neither too watery or too thick. I'd not get the fried banana again since it wasn't a refreshing finish.We have a new go-to dinner destination when visiting Vancouver. Reservations are recommended because they are really busy on the weekend!"},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"All hype... Did not live up to expectations. Crappy service, the hype has gone to their heads and the manager - as well as our server - seem to think their food is invincible. No humility what so ever and obviously arrogant.We made it a point to visit pok pok since we saw them on YouTube/food network/ Yelp. I am a huge foodie... I love Thai food and eat all over the place. That being said, this food was not impressive at all but according to our server and manager we don't know what we're talking about since the manager said \\"he knows his product and where it came from.\\" How do you even become a manager when you talk like that to a customer who is politely letting you know your food is below par? The emphasis should always be on the customer and you should accept responsibility when things don't turn out perfect, how about you listen to what we are saying and don't act like your food is perfect 100% of the time because the best restaurants in the world still mess up. The difference is they have the humility to admit it and listen to the customer. Sorry for the rant... But here is what happened...We ordered the wings, the beef kha-soi (coconut curry broth with crispy wontons, egg noodles, and beef) , and the Kai yang (roasted chicken/papaya salad and sticky white rice + tamarind sauce and sweet n sour sauce).It all started off not to bad. Our server was friendly and the wings came out right away. The wings were pretty salty and honestly not too bad. They did not blow my mind but they weren't bad either 4/5 stars.As our dinner progressed our server barely checked on us and when she did, it was pretty obvious she didn't care and was just going through the motions. She even walked away in the middle of me asking her a question and didn't even bother to turn around when I was in the middle of my sentence - despite her knowing I was still talking to her- just rude. The service got worst and worst. The roasted chicken (Kai yang) was decent, the sauces were delicious and the papaya salad had a nice vibrant taste to it. It was spicy. However, the sticky rice came in a plastic bag and apparently as soon as you take it out of the plastic bag - according to the manager - it becomes a stale, crunch, rock hard clump of bland rice. GROSS. And it is absolutely deplorable for anyone to say \\"that's how it comes, you should've kept it in the plastic bag\\" NO ONE TOLD US THIS... Our server threw the food down and ran away without sharing an ounce of information about the gross, stale, clumpy, and hard rice. Apparently we had to eat it in the plastic bag according to the manager. When I told the server that the rice was crunchy and stale she interrupts and says \\"that's how it comes, that's how we do it here\\" without even letting me finish my sentence. Same thing with the tatooed manager. Just absolutely no care given to the customer and arrogance through the roof. I RESPECT CHEFS WHO DEFEND THEIR FOOD LIKE JASON FROM THE PLAY GROUND however, you have to also see our perspective and if there is a mess up you CAN NOT BE ARROGANT. The kha soi was boring compared to the play ground in Santa Ana that we had a year Ago and they don't even specialize in Thai food. What a shame... Shit service / mediocre food. Not worth 51 dollars for 3 meals."},{"name":"Korea House Restaurant","address":"1155 W State Rd 434","city":"Longwood","stars":"4.5","text":"Typical Korean restaurant decor. Service is great and quick. You can bbq at the table (but there's no overhead vent so unclear how the smoke gets out) \\nWe came with our family friends who live in the area. \\nStarted with the seafood pancake (great chewy pancake loaded with a ton of scallion and seafood) and jap chae (wish the noodles were a tad more al dente and less oily) \\nThe bibambap is loaded. We got the veg version given all the meat we ordered to accompany the dish. \\nMy favorite was the galbi but the pork, chicken, and bulogogi were a hit for everyone else. Portion size would be one dish per two people if you weren't getting anything else. \\nMy aunt also got this seafood tofu soup. I loved the broth but tbh can't remember more than that Given I live in a Korean less city now this Was such a delicious meal that hit the spot!"},{"name":"MOD Pizza","address":"204 SW Yamhill St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Excellent create your own pizza!!

First off none of the drinks have prices on them. If you ask for vodka without saying house they will charge you for the most expensive vodka. The drink prices are always different when I go there. Paying $34 dollars for 2 double vodka and pineapple and with being an ex bartender I saw they only put 1 shot in each glass (but worst off it comes in a sirofoam cup! What a joke!! The bouncer told us we had to leave repeatedly while the bartender was making us a drink on last call! WTF!! The tips are included in the price of drinks so make sure you don't tip twice!

Thanks to the previous yelp reviews who recommended getting the groupon which saved me a lot of money :)Ordered the large with spicy tuna and shoyu tuna and enjoyed the unlimited toppings. Also, they let you try out the different poke they had which is great. They also have the sauces on the side so you    can add as little or as much as you wanted. Where I'm from, you don't get to taste, put on your own sauces and have unlimited toppings so this was a great experience!"},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Pok Pok was very highly recommended to my son so we had dinner there last night.

The noodle texture was great, the soup was ok... Had better in LA. Definitely going with the low sodium next time. The pork meat was not the charshu ive had at other ramen houses. It wasnt the soft. Chicken karage was salty but good. The agadashi tofu texture was great. The only real complaint I have are the people at the door. The lady manager or hostess was not welcoming at all.  I understand it is busy and have not been open long but a smile would be nice. And we tried to to-go food but she didnt want to \\"bombard\\" the kitchen so we couldnt order food to-go. Which seemed weird since theyre new... Dont you want to make more business? There wasnt even a wait at the door and honestly the soup for the ramen is already made you just have to cook the noodles.
