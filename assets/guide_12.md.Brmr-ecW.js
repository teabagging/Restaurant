We got there 20-25 minutes before opening on a Sunday and we were a good 50 people back from the door. That 50 turned to way more as there were numerous line-holders for larger groups, so one person turned into seven. \\n\\nThe place immediately filled upon opening, both indoor and outdoor. We got one of the last tables indoors, by the kitchen. That actually turned out well so I could watch what was going on in the kitchen, Everyone works super hard at this restaurant, and try their best to be fast and efficient. Therefore, I don't agree with other reviews that complain about the service. When you have 100+ orders coming all at once, it is going to take some time to get the food out. The kitchen is not that big.\\n\\nAnyway, the food:\\n\\nThe chicken and waffle is enormous, more food than one person can or should eat. We were thinking of splitting an order and getting another waffle on the side, but our waitress suggested one waffle each with however much chicken we wanted. So we each got one waffle and one chicken. The meal lived up to the hype, it was delicious. The chicken is tender and juicy, and the waffle with syrup is excellent. The combination of all the flavors is devine. I would definitely get it again. \\n\\nFor reasons I cannot explain, we also opted to split one biscuit and gravy, despite the massive portion sizes. My only defense is that we seem to be in the mode of comparing the best biscuits and gravy. This one was among the best. The gravy was easily in the top three, and probably the top two. The gravy was very flavorful with big chunks of sausage and just the right amount of pepper. The biscuit was good, a big dense, but not bad at all.\\n\\nIf you can survive the parking the line this is an excellent place for breakfast or brunch on the weekend."},{"name":"Black Fire Brazilian Steakhouse","address":"8594 Palm Pkwy","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"Worse service, food terrible, for the price I was expecting a good service.\\nI don't recommend this place, even to my worse enemy."},{"name":"SuperPlay","address":"9300 SW Beaverton-Hillsdale Hwy","city":"Beaverton","stars":"3.5","text":"We went to SuperPlay last night for dinner with a large group of families.

And of course, we decided to let the children play a game of laser tag after dinner.  Multiple parents went to the counter but were denied a group discount.  This made it very awkward for me because some families pulled their kids out of line to minimize the expense for me.  Also, a small group of our children patiently waited at the prize counter to trade in their tickets for about 20 minutes.  A female associate working at the food counter adjacent to it was aware that they were waiting.  She was busy cleaning up or what not, she was not serving other customers.  The children even rang the bells periodically, and she repeatedly made an eye contact with them annoyingly.  This delayed our departure but we told them to wait patiently because the whole establishment seemed to be understaffed although it was not packed by any means.  And then an unbelievable thing happened.  This female associate abruptly turned off the lights and shut down the prize counter.  No explanation, no apology, no comment.  We would have totally understood if we were explained it was a closing time, she was bombarded with tasks and could not leave the food counter, she could not find another associate to help, or whatever the situation may have been.

You get a review like the one from Amy L. To say something looked disgusting and then that it was \\"tasty\\" is just ignorant. \\n\\nI am writing an update to my previous review because I felt it was needed. My girlfriend and I dined here twice in a few days. Our second experience was even better than the first. Once again, the service was impeccable and spot on. \\n\\nTo start, we ordered the ceviche, and a couple of mixed drinks. The ceviche will take about 20 minutes to be prepared properly, so don't rush it and definitely plan ahead. This was anticipated because there is a disclaimer on the menu, communication is the key to any successful relationship. Jalapenos made it clear that this would take a bit, but it was well worth the wait. I love ceviche and the Jalapenos version was no exception. You can choose between scallops, shrimp, or fish. We opted for the shrimp. The citrus from the lime juice, along with the fresh ingredients consisting of pico de gallo and hand made salsa, and the temperature of the dish made it create a wave of flavor that I can only describe as refreshing, phenomenal, and down right delicious. We were impressed to learn that all the seafood they use come straight from Gloucester as well. Nothing is frozen or from a restaurant distributor. \\n\\nImpressive. \\n\\nTo switch it up, I went with the beef quesadillas. They are served with a side of sour cream, homemade guacamole, and black beans. The portion size was great, big enough that I took a couple of pieces home. The type of meat that was used was, again, that slow cooked, mouth watering beef. One thing that I did notice was that they were a little bland. I can chalk this up to their attempt to cater to the majority of their customers rather than the few that are adventurous. This is not a problem at all, just be sure to have them add whatever ingredients that you want to kick it up a notch. I went with the habenero sauce on the side again, I just can't get enough of that stuff.\\n\\nI got my biggest surprise when I order a Negra Modelo  and it was served in a pint glass without the bottle. When I inquired about this, I was informed that they actually have it on tap. This is not something that you see at a lot of places, and definitely made me appreciate how hard Jalapenos has worked to provide the best overall experience with authentic Mexican cuisine. Like I had just mentioned, the service was fantastic. Poncho answered our questions, and again, we were successfully guided through the menu with some great suggestions. \\n\\nWhen it comes down to it, this place has all the ingredients of a great establishment. Their food is authentic and made with the finest ingredients. Their drinks are made from in-house recipes (such as the sangria being made from scratch) and well priced.

Only a block or so away from Belmont's culinary behemoth, Pine State Biscuits, and yet a world away. No lines, no parking hassles, just easy peasy.\\n\\nGrace recognized me from my prior visit (by name and order) and was very sweet with my kids. She joked with my husband, \\"I gave her The Heel!\\" and brewed him a fresh pot of coffee. For brunch I ordered the Fritatta Verdun. Whole eggs with delicata squash, fennel, brussel sprouts, Italian kale and topped with herb pesto and crispy potato hay. Two slices of toast and jam rounded out a lovely meal. Mr. K ordered the Piadina (tomato, egg and mozzarella on grilled pizza dough) and we shared the creamy polenta. The kids ordered Italian donuts and spaghetti meatballs.\\n\\nAt first, I didn't know what to think of their standard side, crispy potato hay. It is thin shavings of potatoes that are almost like fries ready to take flight. They are a bit ungainly and awkward to eat on their own. However, when sitting on top of a dish like the frittata, it was divine. I would absolutely order The Heel, the fritatta and the polenta again. My son was begging for more Italian donuts and I can't blame him.\\n\\nI was less impressed by the Piadina. Mainly because there were so many other interesting options on the menu and it is rather bland by comparison. I'm also going to break with the trend of other reviews and say that their version of cannoli isn't my favorite. I didn't personally care for the candied orange component of the dessert. \\n\\nThe dining area is more like a coffee shop than a restaurant with simple tables and an open kitchen. One section of the space just has counters and stools, so please go in knowing this is a very casual place. The style is saved for the ceiling, so don't forget to look up. Large windows and doors also have the promise of making this a great sidewalk cafe when our weather finally turns warm.\\n\\nThe only downside to dining here is that since this is a small operation, it can take awhile to get your food. But it was definitely worth the wait. The Eastside has a nice selection of Italian food options at various price ranges. The Misto Cafe is the warm center."},{"name":"SOHO","address":"691 Main St","city":"Walpole","stars":"4.5","text":"Among trying other sushi restaurants around Norfolk area, this one is on top. We ordered the tako sushi, sushi deluxe and an eel maki.\\n\\nOne of my test for any sushi establishment is trying their tako (octopus). If it taste slimy, chewy or hard to swallow, the care or practice is lacking. Soho howeverÔºåprepared the tako to be tender enough to appreciate its unique taste. Scorching the top, serving it with warm rice, and small wrapping of seaweed made the experience pleasurable.\\n\\nAside from the tako sushi, the sashimi cuts did not taste frozen, more like fresh yet slightly cold. Definetly a good soughtout taste. The cuts are a little thicker and is fair cost for the portion provided.\\n\\nIn my opinion, I was not too crazy about the eel maki, but it was acceptable and good.\\n\\nService was generally nice and friendly.

Unfortunately on that front, South City was underwhelming. So much so that the day after as we were on our way to airport, A commented again \\"Man, that chicken was so underwhelming\\" even though we had already talked about it the night before after dinner. Oh Yelp, it's so rare you fail me but when you do, it really hurts. \\n\\nThe ambiance of South City is nice; dim and romantic but trendy enough that you can come for drinks with a friend or a group to have dinner. \\n\\nWe decided to get three appetizers and the fried chicken entree to share. First up was the smoked trout on crostini; this was delicious. I really liked the sweet caramelized onions on top, it went well with the saltiness of the trout. I wouldn't get it again though as it is on crostini (a very good crostini), but you get these awesome corn bread with butter after you order so that's enough carbs for me. If you don't have a carb limitation though, I recommend the dish.  Next we got the rabbit pot pie. Really nice crust, though unbreakable with a fork. We took it off and cut it with a knife. Huge chunks of rabbit, so much so that I was almost wishing for more veggies. However, it had really good flavor and was a good comfort dish (especially cuz the restaurant was so cold!) Last, we had the baked oysters. Eh... Skip. \\n\\nThen the fried chicken. It was juicy and crunchy. And the sides of collard greens and mashed potatoes was good. Not sure what it is about it that made it underwhelming. Maybe it was our expectation of southern fried chicken. The dish itself was good and well presented... It just tasted like something we can get back home in New York. Actually, all of the dishes that we had was good, but all tasted like something we can order in New York. A blames me for picking somewhere 'fancy' to get southern food. I blame Yelp.

I had heard several anecdotes of relatively short Wednesday waits, so I was hopeful.\\n\\nArriving at 11:20am, the end of the line was somewhere near the end of the building overhang. Shortly after that, a couple of employees came around explaining things and giving an estimated wait time of 2 hours. Spoiler alert: they were pretty spot on. We reached the ordering counter at 1:10pm. Impressive.\\n\\nGoing back to the line experience for a bit, it went by surprisingly quick. You naturally end up talking to your fellow customers, finding out where they've traveled from, and just enjoying the experience. I specifically purchased a couple of super packable chairs from REI in case we ever visit Franklin BBQ (or return to Russian River Brewing for Pliny the Younger season). It turned out that we wouldn't need them for Franklin because (1) they have a good supply of their own chairs for you to use and (2) the line moves every so often, so most customers weren't even bothering to use them.\\n\\nAt some point while waiting, they even came out and gave us free brisket sandwiches. To be honest, they were a little disappointing and made me question our waiting in line. Another thing they do while you wait is get an idea of what you want to order. That way they can inform customers if any meats might be running out. Lucky for us, they had everything available. Honestly, my main concern was that legendary brisket, so anything else was a bonus.\\n\\nWe ordered two pounds of the brisket. I would have been fine with all fatty, but since it was our first time, the guy recommended that we at least try some of the lean. We also ordered minimal amounts (about a quarter pound each) of their other available meats--turkey breast, sausage, pulled pork, and pork ribs.\\n\\nOK time for the main point of this rambling. Was it worth it? Hell to the yeah! That brisket is just on another level. Nice smokiness without being overpowering. Perfectly tender and juicy. Both the fatty and the lean were fantastic. Reviews of their other meats seem to be all over the place, but I thought they were pretty good. In order, I was surprised that I liked the turkey the most, followed by the rib, sausage, and pulled pork.\\n\\nFor sides, the potato salad had a pickled kind of flavor that we both enjoyed. The slaw was nice and light, with a little bit of zest to it. We had so much meat on the table (just the two of us), we needed those sides. You can also grab little trays of pickles and onions by the condiments that help break up the meatfest. Having said that though, any time I thought I was getting tired of eating meat, I would grab another bite of brisket and I would instantaneously be back in bliss.\\n\\nSo long story short, the brisket was absolutely worth the almost two-hour wait. For sure, it was way better than the saucy shredded brisket sandwiches they handed out in line. The idea of waiting like this is certainly not for everyone. For me, Franklin BBQ has been on the imaginary bucket list for years and I just enjoyed the overall experience.\\n\\nP.S. We also both loved the banana bourbon pie.

Would like to see these Pakistani restaurants take a risk and go with some really authentic specials once in a while.\\n\\nTaste (4/5): We ordered two dishes, the mixed grill and a selection of naans. Their naans were probably the best we've had in the US; crispy and rich. The qeema naan (mince filled naan)was very soft, providing a nice contrast with the other ones. Another great bonus with these naans is that they heat up pretty well in the toaster the next day.\\n\\nIn all the dishes, the spicyness rating is spot on. When you ask for mild, you get mild. This has been an issue for us at some of the more authentic South Asian food spots. As for taste, the chicken achari was great. The nehari was also tasty but it wasn't really an authentic nehari. If you know and like authentic nehari, it's best to stay away. The mixed grill was also up to expectations.\\n \\nAmbience (3/5): This is where the restaurant, like most others I feel, kind of struggles.

As a side note all three of us have eaten plenty of Asian/fusion/fine dining.\\n\\nClams were oversalted without any richness or complexity of flavor to the broth (mostly just bland and salty - consensus of all three palates) and came in a small bowl with an equal sized bowl of rice, which was odd considering this wasn't advertised on the menu - it just stated \\"clams in broth\\".

Unlike the other restaurants that we've been to for dine out, the dishes seemed to be freshly cooked since they weren't served immediately after our appetizers. I ordered the Smoked Ham Hock Orecchiette with shemiji mushrooms, brussels sprouts, cr√®me fraiche, and pangratatto which are olive oil toasted bread crumbs. There was also an option to add a pan seared diver scallop for an extra $4 so we did that as well. Man, this dish was so good. The orecchiette pasta was cooked to a perfect al dente and the smoked ham hock toppings were delicious to go along with it. The brussels sprouts were amazing as well. with lots of flavour. I loved the crispy bits of pangratatto since it gave the dish some crunch. All of the components worked great together to make up one really great dish. The scallops were good too -- they elevated the dish a bit more but they weren't necessary.\\n\\nAs for DC, she opted for the Asian-inspired Olive Oil Poached Ling Cod with wild rice, puffed rice, cauliflower puree, coconut curry, and pickled fennel. The puffed rice was actually crusted on top of the cod and the wild rice acted as a bed. The curry was light and sweet -- not spicy at all. The fish was soft and good but nothing spectacular, according to DC. She didn't like the pickled fennel but I did. It tasted kind of like pickled ginger but without the spiciness of ginger.\\n\\nFor our last course of the night, I had the Chocolate & Orange Tres Leches Cake which is literally a cake made using 3 milks: whole, evaporated, and condensed. It was a very decadent dessert. The chocolate had a nice, rich flavour so it wasn't too sweet and the orange flavour was subtle but there. I thought it tasted like Terry's Chocolate Orange to me but obviously more refined :P . The cake was like a sponge, soaking up the milk.\\n\\nDC tried the other dessert, which was a Salted Caramel & Apple Cheesecake. I wouldn't really call this a cheesecake. It was served in a little jar and took on a liquid form of it. I guess it's supposed to be a deconstructed cheesecake. It was served warm, with apple crisps and apple crumble bits on top. This had a nice acidity and I was glad it wasn't too cheesy. The bottom actually reminded me of yogurt. It had the same consistency and tartness. Pretty heavy dessert but it's good when eaten with all the components.\\n\\nOnce again, we left feeling very satisfied with our meal here at The Oakwood, myself more so since I had a better first and second course. The desserts were pretty even -- both were not bad. IMO, the stars of the night would have to be the buttermilk fried chicken and the smoked ham hock orecchiette. Only real bummer was the overly salty calamari. The ambience is warm and cozy, yet modern. I love the wood finishings and the dim lighting is perfect for a casual date night! Only thing is it's a bit tight, especially if you're in a table for 2. Anyways, I highly recommend checking this place out if there are any seats left for dine out. For $29 and a great menu, you can't go wrong!\\n\\nFood - 8.5/10 (would've given it a 9 had it not been for the salty calamari)\\nService - 9/10\\nAmbience - 9/10\\nValue - 8/10"},{"name":"E Ramen +","address":"1110 W Peachtree St NW, Ste 300","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"I thought the signature ramen was just okay.

The only disappointment was not being able to order a mimosa until 12:30 in the afternoon, which I guess is the local ordinance.  Everything else was fantastic.  It was literally freezing cold outside, but the inside of the restaurant was warm and cozy.  The host informed us that only patio tables were available - but that wasn't a problem because the patio was just as toasty as the main dining room.\\n\\nWe started off with the fried green tomatoes appetizer.  I'd enjoyed this Southern delicacy many times in the past, but I'd never had them South City style: stuffed with goat cheese, fried in a light panko-like batter and rising out of a shallow pool of warm tomato basil sauce.  Outstanding, and the kitchen even split it into two plates to make it easier for us to share.\\n\\nAfter that, I went for the cheddar biscuits with sausage and gravy.  The biscuits stole the show - perfectly browned and crumbly, but not too dry or chewy.  The gravy and sausage made a great supporting cast.  I savored every last bite, knowing I'd need to spend an extra 30 minutes on the treadmill that evening.  My brother ordered the South City Breakfast and also loved it.  He allowed me to sample a bite of the thick, smoky bacon and the delicious savory grits.  \\n\\nThe service wasn't the most attentive, with our server often disappearing for long stretches, but we certainly didn't feel rushed out of our table, even though the place was packed.

If you've ever had black puddings, imagine soondae as that, but a bit more mild and... noodlier, I guess. They offer soondae here both by itself, and as soondae guk (soup), which is what I got. The soondae guk comes in a rich, thin broth with a wide assortment of vegetables, beef heart, and some other kind of offal which was tasty, but I can't remember off the top of my head (tripe, maybe?). It. Was. AWESOME. Everything comes together like a semi truck of umami being driven into your tongue.\\n\\nAlso, your order comes with 8 dishes of banchan (side dishes)! Eight!

Major Problem with no one staying on floor including Host es. Everyone hides in back need to fix ASAP. it was an over hr long processes during a slow lunch. When we sat down after a min we where greeted & offered a drink from some one that wasn't our server & had told us she was busy & just wanted to get our drinks order. it only took a few min for the drinks to arrive & the server. Server was well knowledgeable with any questions we asked for. What we didn't know it takes 30 min to have your food. during that time it took me 15 to get a refill from any one. ( need to show team work from every one ). I even notice a table by us had to wait 20 min on their side salad and then another 15 for there burgers! I could tell they where on their lunch break. Any one that is on a lunch break will not be able to eat here. At no time I saw more that 10 tables being occupied. At the same time 1 busser 1 runner 2-3 servers & 1 bartender. after we ate which took us about 10-15 min. we had to wait & find a server for another 10-15 min because there was no one on the floor again. Not even the bar tender this time. When we did get our bill it was wrong & had to find her again 10 min later we get our server back & she changes it back. Thank goodness we had cash if not it we still might be there. I think there was a MGR but never introduced himself as one. My wife had a BIG piece of salt in her hamburger & almost crack her tooth not know it could be in a burger. Some one came that looked like a busser came out & showed us it was their seasoning that used. My wife never ate another bite after he came out. scared to eat more.

Upon arrival we noted that most of the current patrons were seated outside. Upon check in, we were advised that the only available seating was outside or at the bar due to the fact that there were several booked parties.  We opted to dine outside on the patio. The temperature outside was easily 95 degrees. As a result of the patio having several fans going, the temperature of the patio was bearable.\\n\\nIn regards to the service, it was mediocre. I will say that they made a good effort to ensure that someone was attentive to our needs. Within the first five minutes of being at the restaurant, at least 3 people provided us with service. It appears that there may have been a shift change which caused us to have multiple waitresses. The one who provided us with assistance the most came by the table a few times to ensure that we did not need anything. However, there was noting that stood out about the service. \\n\\nAccording to our waitstaff, the fried chicken, shrimp and grits and about 3 other entrees are notorious at this establishment. We opted to start our course with the chicken livers. The presentation was nice. Additionally, the taste was stellar. The combination of caramelized onions, creamed corn, garlic and brioche with the chicken livers created an unforgettable flavor. Please note that this is also suppose to come with ham, however - I do not eat red meat so that was removed for my order. The wait staff also presented the table with a basket of homemade biscuits and cornbread. I tried one of each, neither was memorable. They did appear to taste homemade. For entrees I  tried the shrimp and grits minus the ham ($21.00) and my companion had the fried chicken ($19.00). I will first start with the shrimp and grits. You receive  a decent amount of shrimp ( between. 8-9 large sized). The sauce is  tomato based and the meal also included peppers. It was ok, I can say that I have had better. The fried chicken dish is pretty massive. If you opt to order it, it's a good idea to come with an empty stomach in order to finish it. I only tried the chicken from the fish and it too was just ok. The flavor of the entrees  did not provide any distinguishing taste. \\n\\nOverall, this was a satisfactory experience. There was nothing wrong, but also nothing stand out. I will come back just to have more chicken livers, but regarding entrees -I think I would opt to go elsewhere!"},{"name":"Yebo Beach Haus","address":"56 E Andrews Dr Nw","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Three words: Peri Peri Sauce. \\n\\nAnother two words: s'mores brule√©. \\n\\nTonight the beau and I had a absolutely heavenly dinner at Yebo - Surprisingly they are still Yebo Ski Haus for the next two weeks (4/2 they open with the summer menu) \\n\\nTonight we had the following served tapas style- all served by a supremely skilled wait staff who made the entire experience painless and enjoyable. \\n\\nPommes Frites - I probably would have skipped because there was simply so much food.

The hollandaise was great (probably thanks to browned butter), the medium-poached eggs were perfect, the thin-shaved slices of boar were a nice touch, and the croissant as a carb base is an excellent choice. The duck fat potato wedges were good, though honestly they were excessive, and I could have done without them. What really sealed the deal, for me, were the semi-dried tomatoes, which added a wonderfully sweet and savoury tang to the whole thing. It's still \\"just\\" an eggs benny, but it's a damn good one.\\n\\nPlus, you can get free fresh fruit on the side!\\n\\nSo as far as brunch food goes, I'm pretty impressed. Where I'm a bit less impressed is the speed of service (I'm pretty sure it took at least 25 minutes for our food to arrive), the quite high price ($20 for an eggs benny, even a good one, feels excessive - like I said earlier, cut the potatoes and drop the price and you'd have a perfect offering), and of course the ridiculous waits.\\n\\nBut unlike other overly hyped brunch places, OEB at least has the decency to use an online waitlist system, so you don't actually have to stand in line for an absurd amount of time to get in. I'll give them huge props for that. No restaurant should just have people physically waiting in line for their food. And it's also a very large location, so they've got room for all their customers.\\n\\nSo as far as popular brunch places go, OEB is a place I definitely want to return to. It won't unseat my favourite places to eat in the city, since massive portions of brunch food just doesn't appeal to me the way other dining experiences do, but this is certainly a place I'd recommend to others looking for a fun brunch experience."},{"name":"Fat Matt's Rib Shack","address":"1811 Piedmont Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"In no way does being from North Carolina qualify me to be a BBQ critic, however, I grew up near Lexington.

Really blown away by the brisket, unfortunately, I grew up eating really bad (bbq) brisket, so I was never a fan but man does this place make me a believer. Second best on the menu was the pulled pork, juicy, tender and had great flavor. It was perfect with the white (wonder) bread to make a little sandwich.

I'm never going back for sure! Taking time after today's wasted lunch time, and money, to write a review, to spare people a horrible time. If you still go, its your choice, but you'll atleast be fore warned.\\n\\nI walked in and said, \\"Happy New Year\\" to the waiter who has served us before. He laughed a bit, warmly. I know, I said, it is end January but it is the first time I am here this year! He then didn't come back. The guy at the front cash register came. I believe I have seen him there before.\\n\\nI asked if they have Schezuan chicken for lunch? He said yes. I said its not on the menu but do you have it? He said, rather annoyed, \\"yes, yes, yes\\". OK. \\n\\nSoon, the hot and sour soup arrived. It was cold. I said nothing. Then he leaves a serving of Kung Pao chicken before me and walks away. I got his attention and said, \\"Sir, I requested Schezuan chicken\\". He proceeds to tell me that's what Schezuan chicken is, and walks away, as if, eat it! I waited a while. He saw from afar that I hadn't touched my plate. I was so hungry and looking forward to lunch and this was turning into an odd experience! He then walks over and reiterates that it IS Schezuan chicken. He asks me what I think Schezuan chicken is, if not that. I said it has its own spicy sauce and celery and carrots julienned. This I explained is Kung Pao chicken. He says, \\"Schezuan chicken and Kung Pao chicken are both the same thing\\". I said they are not. I don't like the sauce and I'm allergic to peanuts. I know the difference. He argues, shouts, and demands what I want. I said I specifically asked if you have it. Could you please bring me chicken with some vegetables and something spicy in it. At that point I had given up and just wanted something decent to eat and be done with. He came back minutes later with white chicken (which I left aside), broccoli and carrots in a white sauce, and a ton of red chillies. The lo mein had a terrible cheap oil flavor, which has never been there before. While he came to me, he also stepped on my boot twice, so I requested him to please not step on me. He shouts back, then keep your foot under the table! Ofcourse I had. He stood so close to the table that his boot was landing on mine. Wow.\\n\\nOver lunch I looked at my friend and said I feel a bit sad, this place that has been a regular spot is no more. I'm never ever coming back. \\n\\nNo one to take the payment so I went to the front desk to pay. The same guy charges my card. He then looks and demands, \\"Tip??\\". I said, \\"I'm leaving none. It's my prerogative\\". \\"GET OUT\\", he yelled at the top of his voice. Followed by, \\"GET OUT, GET OUT, NEVER COME BACK\\". I stood there calmly and as he continued to shout \\"GET OUT\\", his voice drowning mine, I said, \\"Do you know that I come here quite regularly? I decided that I would never come back\\". He went on to use his finger to waive it as you would a stray dog in some film, and screamed \\"GET OUT, GET OUT, GET OUT\\". An old Chinese couple stared as me as the foreigner there and also looked frightened and perplexed to see a well dressed girl being told to get out of a restaurant at lunch hour, as did a young Chinese student eating lunch by herself. \\n\\nI'd rather give those $3-4 to a homeless person or someone who needs it or is respectful or has gratitude. I was sorry I had to give any of my hard earned dollars even for a sub standard lunch with an awful experience. As he continued to shout \\"GET OUT\\", I said, I will post a review on every site I can to let people know not to visit.\\n\\nI'm not malicious in the least. It is not my intent to hurt their business. I do think that business is earned however. I would hate for someone else to have the shoddy experience we did today. I'll just say, had I read this review, I would have spared myself the visit. The food is at best sub standard, the customer service is absent, and the insult today was sufficient for the place to be shut down. Filthy! I usually eat, more often, at HSIN HSIN cafe in Boston. I called there before going here but they were closed for construction, so I went here! At Hsin Hsin, the Schezuan chicken is delicious and very different from Kung Pao, as is the case everywhere. \\n\\nYou don't serve the wrong dish and shout at the customer that it is the right one. You don't step on the customers shoes and not apologize but instead scream at them! You don't shout at a long time patron to \\"GET OUT\\" about 15 times, wag a finger at her and tell her to never return. You don't discriminate if you see a non-Chinese person and you don't think you can insult a person just because they are a woman. I'm taking my business elsewhere and I hope BU students and young professionals in the area consider eating elsewhere to save themselves from eating sub standard foods and experiencing such off the charts experience when they take time out, pay, and go for a happy meal. \\n\\n#boycott"},{"name":"Lily's Sandwich","address":"10901 N Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"today i had the itching for a vietnamese sandwich.  not just any banh mi, THE BANH MI.  \\n\\ni'm also impatient, so i tried both sandwich places in that chinatown strip mall.  yes, i ate two sandwiches back to back.\\n\\nlily's unfortunately was the worse of the two, mainly because the sandwich was cold.  i mean i'm used to these places at least heating up the bread to make it cripsy on the outside, but nope they didn't.  also the meat was cold.  the rest of it was fine; i mean you can't really messup pickled veggies and cilantro.\\n\\nthe meat was a miss.  the place i go to in houston (givral's) the meat is chargrilled, with that smokey flavor, grill marks and is slightly greasy.  this was dry and looked like scraps of pork that didn't have even a hint of chargrilled goodness to it. \\n\\nnote on the buttered bread - i think thats really homemade mayo.  the place i go to in houston makes there own and its def a weird yellow looking concoction that jiggles but its essential to making the sandwich good.  i could be wrong though bc i didn't watch him make it.\\n\\nthey have a plethora of other vietnamese fare like sticky rise, spring rolls etc.  they do have pho now."},{"name":"The Butcherie","address":"428 Harvard St","city":"Brookline","stars":"4","text":"The place to go to if you want an obscure Jewish item.

We had a pretty big group and knowing how popular this place is, I didn't want to take a chance of not having a reservation. Good thing I did because just 5 minutes after we sat down at our reserved patio tables, the place was packed.  This place reminds me of House of Blues with its wooden wild west theme and an outdoor staging area for concerts downstairs.

It's a gem of a place! And they're expanding their current location to accommodate more customers which is great because their current location right now is definitely not large enough. \\n\\nTheir ambiance is nice. Gives the customer a little reminder of Vietnam  with all their little cultural props. The ambiance is quite bright and lively. But not overwhelming. \\n\\nTheir service is usually pretty good. They are quite attentive to their customers needs. Which is nice. You don't have to flag them down and wave your hands crazily like in some other restaurants. Waiters and waitresses are generally respectful and nice. There have been moments however when you ask for a side of chilli peppers, and for whatever reason, they seem to forget about it pretty quickly. Might be due to certain waiters and waitresses, but it's happened far too often, for me. \\n\\nTheir food is excellent though! Especially their ph√≥. And unlike many other ph√≥ restaurants they do have bone marrow in their soup. And it is absolutely delicious. I absolutely love their ph√≥ with the bone marrow. Everyone needs to at least try it before they criticize it. It's unique since no other ph√≥ restaurant that I've been to has offered their ph√≥ in that way.

Lines. Ramen and lines. Is it worth it? Only if you're in search of a tasty salt lick. Salty as in, their broth is so hella salty it's ridiculous.\\n\\nAMBIANCE\\nTatsuya has a great vibe. It has lanterns and Japanese-inspired fixtures hanging against the walls. Cozy, with rustic bowls for the noodles. Even at 9:00 PM, the place still had a line; fortunately, the surplus of people did not take away from the atmosphere.\\n\\nFOOD\\nNumber one and number two. Tonkatsu and tonkatsu sho-yu. Let's break this down, kids. (Although if I ever get a chance to eat here again I'd want to try their tsukemen before passing final judgment.)\\nSoup: The broth on the shoyu was actually quite tasty at first sip. It set Tatsuya apart from fellow competitor Michi, but not for long. Past the fifth spoonful, the saltiness just got overwhelmingly cloying. Peppercorns worked well to give an extra body but honestly I could barely finish the noodles because the broth just got so unbearable.\\n\\nNoodles: Thin and white and not egg noodles. I won't question authenticity because their menu did mention that they follow a certain region's type of ramen noodle, but at the same time I feel like there should have been better mouthfeel.\\n\\nToppings: Chashu was thick and smoky. Better than Michi's, definitely. Their ajitama egg was also delicious: the yolk was half-flowy and custardy. I also liked the addition of bamboo shoots!\\n\\nSERVICE\\nUpon asking for hot water (both to drink because it was hella cold outside, I didn't want iced water, and possibly to dilute the broth), our server immediately responded with something along the lines of \\"Oh, our water only gets as hot as lukewarm from the tap.\\" \\n\\nWhich, you know, would have been sufficient explanation. But he immediately followed up with a \\"Why, what's the matter? Is there something wrong with the broth?\\" Which suggests that perhaps more than one customer in the past might have had similar motives as I. Hm. HMMMM. Oh well. I was in a good enough mood to not make a fuss, but also a bit irked at the defensive rebuke.\\n\\nTl;Dr I'm gonna jump on team Michi boat because the broth here, albeit initially tasty, gets way too overpowering, way too fast. Nice ambiance though! Anywho, don't be dissuaded -- you should try this place and determine for yourself who wins between Michi and Tatsu-ya."},{"name":"Sonic Drive-In","address":"630 Washngton St","city":"Stoughton","stars":"2","text":"I was excited to have a Sonic in the south shore as the only other one I know of is in the north shore.

If it were just my wife and I it would've been fine, but sitting at a table with a 7 and 3 year old for that long tried our patience.

I thought it ended up being quite pricey for what it was. It's nice that it came with two bowls of rice for a group of 3-4 to split though.\\nFried chicken (spicy and honey mustard) - Honey mustard was just on the side, we got regular fried chicken you had to dunk into the sauce. The spicy was lacking flavor and the skin wasn't very nice and thick. \\nBulgogi rice bowl - My friend got extra beef for $7 but only then did it look like a normal portion for the price. The beef was good though, good texture and flavor. \\n\\nI'll be back to try out more, it's a great addition to the Fenway/Kenmore area since there aren't many restaurants around.

Stellar job! and the food and drinks were even more delicious this time around since we tried something different."},{"name":"Fox Bros. Bar-B-Q","address":"1238 Dekalb Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"They deserve 5 stars and more! From the atmosphere to the food, the service and menu selections-they've thought of everything. I didn't even Yelp Fox Bros. and went on the faith of spoken word a la Josh and Chuck from Stuff You Should Know. The two of them have lived in GA longer than I and their endorsement holds a lot of clout. \\nWe were lucky enough to only have to wait 5 minutes and in that time, I got an eyeful of the kitsch on the walls, observe the staff and spy the entrees already on the tables. There isn't much of a waiting area and people are constantly buzzing around trying so be patient and vigilant-it's worth it. \\nCan I just say first of all, the service is incredible! Yes, you come here for the food and the food definitely speaks for itself but I haven't had a more perfect dining experience in recent memory. Our server greeted us, got our drink orders, gave us a rundown of specials and popular items and came back in less than a minute. She was warm, enthusiastic, her timely can't be beaten and she seemed like she really loved what she did. There is a regular BBQ, spicy, and white sauce. I really enjoy the spicy sauce as I'm more of a vinegar BBQ sauce fan so they won me over with that. \\nWe ordered the chicken fried ribs as an appetizer and (2) 2 item combos. It comes with 2 generous sides and a sliced white bread under the protein items. I'm a sucker for chicken fried anything so I zeroed in on those key words right away like the fatty that I am. \\nSo all the food is seems is run by food runners/bussers/managers? while the servers focus on their tables, refills, and keeping the customers happy. And if the ribs were any indication of what was to come, my expectation were exceeded after that first bite. Ribs were tender, falling off the bone good! I didn't bother using my teeth while inspecting the meat and drizzling spicy bbq on every other bite. \\nI ordered fatty brisket, pulled pork with potato salad and mac 'n' cheese. The fatty brisket was the best I've ever had. It's better than the many briskets I've had throughout Texas, Kansas, Missouri, South Carolina and Tennessee. It's juicy, smoked just right, generously portioned and tender. And that pulled pork has no business being so soft-it's as if it was injected with fat during the cooking process. I hung my head to give thanks not only for the meal but to thank the pig for giving it's life for such a worthy meal. Yes I was being melodramatic but I hadn't felt so grateful to be on the receiving end of a meal for that long.  \\nAnd it's just not about the meat here-I did spy a portobello mushroom burger, a veggie plate, plenty of hearty vegetarian sides (the potato salad was slap your mama good) and a Dr. Pepper cake! \\nI wish I had more time to enjoy the meal but there was a timely issue and a concert to catch so we didn't order dessert. When our server came by with boxes, compostable containers and lid, she mentioned the charity the restaurant was raising money for (Hogs for the Cause). It helps subsidize living expenses for families who have a child receiving care for brain cancer. I thought it was going to CHOA so I gladly donated because that's a cause that I keep close to my heart as well. This place hit it out the way all around and ended the meal on an amazing note. \\nI'd recommend this place to everyone visiting Atlanta. It's well worth the stars, positive reviews, and hype. For a place as well known and busy, they could have cut corners and let the tables be a little greasy, the sauces half full, dust all over all the kitsch but everything within sight was pristine.

The taste was so bland, then I realized they had forgotten the candied walnuts, which was rectified. That did improve the taste, I realized later they had forgotten the Gorgonzola crumbles as well. I think they put the Gorgonzola dressing that's from another salad on instead of the Pear Vinagrette. Also, the pears were not ripe and the beets did not seem pan roasted. This is a common occurrence in many restaurants. The menu and the reality are not the same.  My daughters experience with the Ahi on her sandwich was not good either. The Ahi was stringy.

With almost 100 different brands to choose from, there's something for everyone and every budget. I'll resist the urge to try and correct the numerous misconceptions about Tequila that exist, but suspect that's where a little sticker-shock can come from when people go stumbling in looking for a $5.00 shot of Cuervo.\\n\\nThat said, if you're like most and simply looking for a fun and friendly introduction to tequila, try the $22.00 tequila flight. You'll get three 3/4 oz shots served on a paddle with a nice little glass of Sangrita. I can't think of how many people have approached me when I'm enjoying a flight and asked, \\"Hey, what is that?\\" I've yet to have anyone who ordered on my suggestion give me anything less than an enthusiastic 'thumbs-up' after trying one. You'll get a Blanco, a Repasado and a nice Anejo. Your bartender will also be more than happy to educate you on what you're sampling. Tequila has a rich and storied history so while you're escaping the heat of the day, you can actually learn a little something in the process.\\n\\nSo, do yourself a favor, grab yourself a flight and ask the knowledgeable staff about what you're drinking and enjoy some Mexican food.

The fried chicken was juicy and a huge win with our group. My father in law reports it was the best he's ever had. The pork chop (I avoid pork after watching Okja) was tender and juicy and paired really well with the broccollini that had a vinegar and smoky base.

I will not bore you with each order so I will give you tlwhar I order and what my wife ordered. Me, celery root soup  and scallops. Wife salad and beef fillet.  My soup was bland and there were four small top medium scallops each surrounded with a pinch of brussel sprouts,additional vegetable and a puree in the middle of plate - uninspired. Wife meal was the best by far and deserved a great rating. Service was very uneven, I had flat water which was refilled with sparkling water. One of our party had their cocktail removed before finishing and I had to explain how to make a perfect gin martini.

My guess with Stubbs is we have the location and people are coming for the music venue so we don't have to try as hard. The place was busy which should be a good sign but service was okay, our server seemed as if she had other things she'd rather be doing. Ordered the three meat plate and which is my go to get a prospective of a new BBQ joint. For starters we ordered fried green tomatoes, I'm pretty sure there isn't a frozen version of fried green tomatoes but my guess they'd have been better. \\nAs for main course ribs, brisket and sausage I ate the sausage, likely sourced elsewhere and hard to ruin.

I was really hoping to try their happy hour menu because it featured items there that aren't available on their standard menu.  Sadly, happy hour menu was unavailable the day we chose to dine.  Fair enough.  I really scoured the standard menu up & down.  It was mostly ala carte for a high price.  We have expensive restaurants in Vancouver, Canada like this but I'm not a fan.  I didn't want to pay more for cheap vegetables. \\n\\nWe did begin placing an order.... long story short, I had a misunderstanding with my boyfriend and revoked my order.  I needed time to reconsider so he just ordered his appetizer.  I got confused about something so I asked the server for more time.  I'm not sure if he was just old and deaf or really condescending, but he kept acting bewildered that I would do such a thing, as if I was harming his wallet.  Yeah-hmmm.\\n\\nHe gave me another 10 minutes to see if I was ready and by then my nerves were shot.  My boyfriend chimed in on my behalf and the server may as well have puked up his scoffing on my lap.  He rolled his eyes and stormed off.  Rather speedy for this elderly man whose demeanour, at first, was quite gentle and soft.\\n\\nSnobbery - at its finest!  I certainly felt embarassed and undervalued as a customer.  Apparently, I was not welcome at this restaurant unless I was willing to throw money at our server.  Want money thrown at you??  Go work at a geriatrics facility with stripper poles.  My boyfriend ate his appetizer and cancelled the remainder of his order.  We paid our bill, he still gave a good, undeserving tip [which surprised our server], and we left the restaurant. \\n\\nMy boyfriend mentioned, after we left, that even he got a few bad stares while we were inside.  As travellers, and with me coming down with a nasty head cold, we dressed casual.  Not ugly or offensive; just jeans/leggings and t-shirt casual.  We totally experienced a Pretty Woman moment.  I may not have been having a good night, personally, but your behaviour was unwarranted and appalling.

I had an Ocean Blue goblet because I love it (tried it first at VA SF).  All the drinks came out and were presented in their great way.  Everyone had salads and sandwiches for lunch, and we finished off with ordering a bunch of different desserts to try.  We ordered Red Velvet Cake, the Fried Oreo Cookies with Vanilla ice cream, the Rainbow Doughnut ice cream sandwich and the chocolate blackout sundae.  Each one was better than the next.

Definitely make a reservation - it's very easy with OpenTable or a call, and when you walk in and see the small mob of people in the elevator bay trying to get a seat, it'll definitely be worth it.\\n\\nThe restaurant is a little bit hard to find, but if you follow the signs and refer to the maps in the mall it's not that bad. It is in the Prudential tower, so you have to walk through the Prudential center mall to get there. \\n\\nI firstly want to echo other reviewers in saying that the hostess staff is quite rude. The first time I tried to call to make a reservation, the hostess hung up on me. The waitstaff was great, however - extremely attentive and very knowledgeable about the menu. \\n\\nThey have a great wine and cocktails list, but a lot of the wine can be hit or miss. Their mixed drinks are quite good, but absolutely on the pricey side ($13+ each). \\n\\nThe food is pretty so-so, especially for the price you pay. The foie gras was extremely buttery, to the point where it really just tasted like a lump of pure fat - there wasn't much additional complexity to it. The entrees tend to be unoffensive - the fra diavolo was really just spaghetti with tomato sauce, and some clams and shrimp thrown in. The steak was fine, and so is the chicken.\\n\\nHonestly, my impression of Top of the Hub is that there's a huge focus on the fact that it's a ritzy, fancy restaurant. They focus so much on the extensive wine menu, the flashy cocktails, and the impeccable waitstaff that it seems like they just forget about the food. The drinks are extremely strong, but every article of food I've had at Top of the Hub has simply been alright - not great, and absolutely not worth the prices that they charge.\\n\\nThe view is very nice, but there are definitely certain sides that have more interesting sights. My favorite is definitely the portion of the tower that faces the Hancock tower.\\n\\nOverall, I think Top of the Hub is absolutely a place that you should check out. Advice though - instead of shelling out for the full meal, or waiting forever to get into the bar/lounge (they don't take reservations for the bar), instead make a later reservation for the dining area, split a desert or an appetizer and some drinks. You get the same experience and view, minus the lackluster food and having to get sneered at by the hostess staff as you wait for hours to get let into the bar."},{"name":"Dang's Thai Kitchen","address":"670 N State St","city":"Lake Oswego","stars":"4","text":"My favorite dish at this restaurant is Tom Yum Noodle Soup, which is this perfect blend of sour and spicy mixed with seafood and meat and delicious noodles.

We were sad to see a \\"sold out\\" sign on their front door but noticed there were people still in line. We still went in and stepped in line.

So if you really want to beat the lines and are okay with only trying the brisket and some sides it's worth it. \\n\\nOnce we got to the serve counter. The server asked us how many people were in our party, we said three and he made us a plate of the following: \\n\\n- sausage, chopped brisket, coleslaw, potato salad, onions, pickles, and sliced bread \\n- 2 beers \\n\\nOur bill came out to only $26.

I have heard the place has a long wait time in the weekends and this is a nice touch for those who are daring to wait it out. \\n\\nPickled jars decorate the place and it seems to be a integral part of their menu. \\n\\nThe venue has indoor and an outdoor covered heated patio. We decided to sit inside while it was a little loud, we had no problem conversing and enjoyed our breakfast.\\n\\nOur sever Noah was very nice, polite and provided us with recommendations that needed up being on point. He kept checking on us to make sure our coffee mug was filled. Overall the service from the door in until we left was really good. \\n\\nWe ordered a bloody marry which came decorated with the rim, a lemon slice and an olive and with okra. I have had better ones in the past and would not necessarily order it again.\\n\\nThe main Dish!!!! The CHICKEN & WAFFLES!!! this plate was amazing! If you come here this is the must have plate out of all things in their Bfast menu. I went with one piece of chicken and felt it was more than enough and per Noah's recommendation. The waffle has this cinnamon touch that made it perfect bite after bite. The crispy ness of the chicken was crunchy and the seasoning like no other. Getting a perfectly cooked piece of breast is not easy and they nailed it. It all came with a side of syrup that balanced the waffle and the fried chicken and was the perfect touch. \\n\\nI highly recommend this place!!!

It tasted actually pretty good. It's good that y'all allow samples too.\\n\\nI want to take some time to bash on 2 other aspects though.\\n\\n1. The ice cream melts WAY too fast. Like unbelievably fast. I consider myself a rather fast eater but within 15 seconds, the ice cream started rapidly melting. PERHAPS it was because the cookie was warmed up? It felt slightly warm but I didn't think it'd make enough of an impact to rapidly melt the ice cream. This would usually be fine because you would typically eat ice cream outside on a sunny day, when the ice cream would melt anyway... however...\\n\\n2. The tissue packaging is incredibly absurd if the ice cream is going to melt out of the cookie sandwich. The pouch of the tissue collected the melted ice cream as I did my best to try to take a bite, only to have the cookie collapse on itself since the ice cream was too soft to get bitten out. I honestly don't know how anyone eats this with the tissue.\\n\\nUpon scrolling down I realized that people got it in a cup?

So many have written about the brisket, the sauce and of course, the lines. What can I add? I'll tell you why Ben would have loved Franklin's Barbecue. \\n\\nAs a young adult, Franklin lived as a vegetarian, surviving on a diet of biscuits and raisins. Of course he did.  He coined the motto, \\"An Apple A Day Keeps The Doctor Away\\". His vegetarianism stemmed from a need to save money (meat was expensive), but evolved into a principled philosophy of eating. \\n\\nHe abandoned vegetarianism while sailing on a ship from Boston to New York. The crew was cooking cod, and the smell of it made Franklin very hungry. He began to question his dedication to vegetarianism. He later wrote about the experience:\\n\\n\\"I balanced some time between principal and inclination, until I recollected that when the fish were opened, I saw smaller fish being taken out of their stomachs. Then, I thought, 'If you eat one another, I don't see why we may not eat you.' So I dined upon cod very heartily and have since continued to eat as other people, returning only now and then occasionally to a vegetable diet.\\"\\n\\nAll this Franklin stuff is good background for Franklin's BBQ. Vegetarians, beware at Franklin's! Everyone else, come early and endure the lines so that you can make your family and friends crazy with envy. Here's my assessment. \\n\\nThe brisket is very well done. In my opinion, it's better, moister, and crustier than Memphis BBQ . I prefer the brisket without much sauce and Franklin's is perfect for eating simply but well."},{"name":"Little Woodrow's Southpark Meadows Bar & Grill","address":"9500 S I H 35, Ste 100","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I would give more stars based solely on the ability to watch plenty of sports at LW...

We popped in on a Wednesday night and it wasn't busy.  I made a reservation just in case and we were seated right away.  The upscale dining has classics from standard to over the top burgers, chicken sandwiches, and milkshakes.  There is also goblet creations that look amazing, but I didn't even think about trying one since it's 36 bucks for one of those things...lol!\\n\\nSo calories don't count here, ok?  If you are on a diet or limiting yourself to food, do not go there!  You will splurge and eat like there is no tomorrow or at least that's what I did ;)  We had a check-in offer of fried mac and cheese balls that were great.  I got the donut burger and it was guilty amazing.  The beef was sandwiched between a glazed doughnut topped with a grilled cheese sandwich and two strips of bacon sprinkled with powdered sugar.  The fries are included for additional cholesterol and I have no regrets devouring the meal.  You only live once.\\n\\nThere were a few birthday celebrations going on while we were there.  I get that it's the approximately place to get another year on, but they turn the music way too loud when the staff comes out to sing the birthday song to the customer.  It should have been less louder to where we didn't have to scream at each other while they have that going on.  Thankfully, the staff turns it down after they sing it and it's enjoyable again.\\n\\nOf course, let's not leave without a dessert.  The insane milkshakes take about 15 minutes to make, so it's wise to look over that part of the menu while you're eating since it'll come out after you've digested a little.  The giggles snickers milkshake is ridiculously awesome!  It was cookies and cream ice cream blended with peanuts and topped with a caramel waffle, Snickers, whipped cream, and sprinkles.  If that isn't enough, it was served in a chocolate covered mug with rainbow sprinkles and Snickers pieces.  Hell to the yeah!\\n\\nOur waitress was friendly and sweet and the service was reasonable.  The only thing that might have been needed to provide wipes on table since it would have come in handy with wiping off our hands during our meal.  The cloth napkins don't help too much with sticky sugar on them :/  There's also a candy shop you can get more candy from.  Don't worry, the kids won't let you miss it.

I trekked out for over an hour from Boston to follow the chef and owner, Jason, to see what he was doing next. And for good reason: Jason's pedigree basically makes him NE sushi royalty. Jason learned his craft under the tutelage of the Fish Market masters, who are themselves Oishii alums. \\n\\nAnd, man, despite that terrible drive, the trip was worth it. The sushi was fresh and creative. The avocado ball alone would be worth its price as a structural marvel but its mix of textures and flavors made several members of my party close their eyes in delight.

I used to love this place and I was a regular several years ago, coming in almost once a week. I stopped coming in because they ended up getting a new manager and the portions went way down, but the prices stayed the same, or went up, and a bunch of the experienced servers left.  I heard they got a new owner or something and figured they had enough time to straighten things out, but it was still chaos.  I walked in and saw no less than 8 workers up front running around almost literally in circles like they couldn't quite figure out what to do.  I get seated and I'm told some story of how they got slammed and only had one server from 4 to 5 and blah blah blah.  It was almost 730, so I'm not sure what 3 hours before had to do with anything.  It wasn't even really busy, maybe 60% full. An older server that dressed like she stole her 17 year old daughters clothes comes over apologizing for who knows what, then asks if I'd like an appetizer. I told her I had a birthday coupon for 5 free wings.  She acted like she had never seen the coupon before.  I order and she says \\"now I think there's a limit on how many wings...\\" I said yeah, it says 5 free wings. I told her 5 boneless garlic, mild, extra wet, with ranch and celery.  She writes down everything, and I mean everything, which isn't bad I guess, but normally when you've been serving a while you learn to just memorize orders. She makes a comment about how I seem to know what I'm doing and I'm thinking in my head \\"I'll bet you don't\\". I also order some other stuff and she makes a comment about how I'm up selling for her.  No lady,  I'm just hungry and 5 wings ain't gonna cut it. The food comes out and the wings are cold.  The burger was pretty boring with no sauce on it or seasoning. For a $10+ burger, it better be pretty tasty,  but honestly Rallys tastes better. I get done eating and she comes back asking if I'm the one that had \\"some coupon thing\\". Early onset of Alzheimer's?  I told her yes and show it to her a second time.  I showed her the validation code and she asked if I could read it to her because her eyes are bad. She comes back with the check and I lay down a $100 and cover it over with the receipt so as to not advertise to the smelly, shady looking dude at the table next to me how much money I'm carrying.  She comes back and proceeds to loudly count back my change bill for bill... \\"$20. $40. $60. $80...\\" I'm thinking well, now she has the smelly, shady dudes attention. I ask for a refill on my drink and she kinda snaps at me and says \\"I was going to ask if you wanted one\\". Really?  That would have been a first for a server to ask if I want a refill after I get my change back and I'm ready to leave. I guess I'll check back in a year when I get my next free 5 wings for my birthday.

No big deal. \\n\\nWe ordered the chicken enchilada platter, a beef burrito, and a hard shell taco. \\n\\nWhen we went to sit down, I noticed something on the floor.

However, this place was only average at best and if I had the option of coming back or not.. I'd choose no. \\n\\nThe inside is quite small. One bathroom. 3 tables downstairs.

The girl who worked that day jut apologized to us and said the kitchen was being difficult with the orders, and I'm totally understanding of that, but it sucks when you're hungry and you see people who ordered AFTER you get their food first. \\n\\nOnce the food did arrive it looked pretty delicious. Unfortunately, I think for me the looks didn't match the taste. The food was cold. Even the fries which was sad because I wanted crispy fries and didn't get that.

And, yes, this is my first Yelp review. I made an account because of how sick I am. I am writing this from my bathroom floor, sitting on my shower mat. I really wanted to like this place. There are not many places to watch sports in this area of town, and I truly liked the atmosphere. I will not be back, though, and that is for damn sure. I should have taken a hint when my buddy told the waiter (in all sincerity, he legit meant it) \\"wow, these glasses are the cleanest I've seen at a bar in a long time\\" and his response was: \\"really!? that's surprising!\\" We all wrote it off as a joke, the guy was very nice, we laughed it off. The next round of drinks...my buddy notices numerous things floating in his glass. Spoke too soon. I look in it, it looks like pepper, until I notice some of the flecks have wings. I have worked in bars and restaurants before, I knew what this was, and I'm sure you can take a guess as well...fruit flies. We tell the waiter, he says \\"ah I have word vomit, knew I spoke too soon.\\" (key word: vomit). I hate throwing the guy under the bus because he truly was nice as hell and very attentive, but dadgum man. I know he is going to know which table this was as well, but it is what it is. We had a late lunch (more like early dinner), went straight to a college football shindig and did not have anything there, so I know, for a fact, me getting sick like this was not from anything else. I have not thrown up in over three years (yes, that is complete honesty), yet here I am. The only reason this place is even getting 1 star is: 1) I can't go lower. 2) I do still like the atmosphere 3) the servers were extremely nice, even with their questionable responses to cleanliness. I do want to recognize the gentleman with the gray shirt, I believe it said \\"Pig Roast\\" or something like that. That dude was right on the spot as soon as you were done with your plate/drink, and was extremely nice. Move that man up to server and/or bartender, he was awesome. I would like to think that my experience was a \\"blip\\" or whatever you may want to call it. But I will not be going back, and will not be able to recommend it to anyone as well.

If you're after the food portion of the review, scroll down. \\n\\nWe were eating at Pho Van one day and saw the line starting to form at 4:30 PM so using what we learned before, we showed up around 4:45 and got into line where VERY quickly, a long line started forming behind us on a Friday afternoon. \\n\\nI had read previous reviews talking about their seating style. The staff strive to make your experience the most efficient but the most comforting...not so much. It's really no fault of their own. These people got the goods in town and they're running with their continuous word of mouth among their growing bevy of fans and warm blooded hot noodle hoarders. Nothing else could explain how a line starts forming for the place well before it even opens! \\n\\nBeing in the front, we were immediately seated once the doors opened at precisely 5:06 PM but hey, who's keeping tabs? We waited in line behind some amateurs who didn't know or understand (or care?) what was going on and just seemed lost as to the whole process. You immediately walk in and a waiter asks how many are in your party. They then give you strict instructions to sit where they tell you to in order to maximize efficiency (you should eat your soup HOT) and provide the most availability for tables among patrons.Don't try to get around the system, they will go to you and move your things out of the way if you try to sit elsewhere. You then proceed in line to order drinks and then food. Water system is a bummer but whatever, they need to work kinks out. You get a cocktail glass of water and if you're a camel like me...this is frustrating, especially for later. \\n\\nYou put the order in then get seated. Within about 10 minutes or less, a hot bowl of steaming soup will come wafting to your place setting. It's community style so get comfortable having someone directly to your left and right if you're on the center tables. Your appetizers and mains arrive as soon as they're done and not necessarily in that order. I respect this and actually encourage it as your food is freshest when it is fresh off the line.  \\n\\nNow, for the food. It's good. Legitimately so and for not having had ramen before, I was pleasantly surprised. Beware, it is very, very, VERY salty. Almost prohibitively so. Everything we had was doused in copious amounts of salt, be it soy or some other form of sodium. The Sweet and Sour Yodas were a nice counterpoint against the rich and intensely porcine broth of the ramen. You have to REALLY like pork to eat here. I have eaten practically all parts of a pig...All. I love it ALL. \\n\\nThat being said, I almost got nauseous from the scent and smothering taste of the pork. It just permeates everything in the bowl and I LOVE pork, love it. Fatty, greasy, fried, crisp-ified...I love it ALL. This was bordering on TOO much. And I sat next to another Asian couple and the girl next to me said the same thing. TOO salty. Asian food, be it Japanese, Thai, Vietnamese, Chinese (the real stuff) playfully toes the lines of being sweet, salty, umami, sour, and bitter. It's a tenant of good Asian food that balance is achieved. \\n\\nThe sliders, which came highly recommended from Yelpers, were lackluster. It's pretty much a fried sauce-ified pulled porky patty that's pan fried and topped with a cole slaw of sorts. The cole slaw, meant to be refreshing, crispy, and a touch creamy did NOTHING to balance the ridiculously salty meat \\"patty\\" of the slider. I couldn't finish my half. Keep in mind, this sucker is maybe...2-3 inches long and split in half? And I like salt. A lot. And the water thing? I finished my cup of water within seconds of starting my ramen. And never got a refill. Bummer. \\n\\nThe review and its 3 stars are for the food experience ONLY. I think they've got a good thing going here and people know it. I'm reluctant to go back without a gallon jug of water (which is what I drank after I left the place) and oodles of time on my hand. I would still recommend it as ramen and communal dining is enjoyable enough on its own.  For that experience alone, I say bravo Ramen Tatsu-Ya. Bravo.\\n\\nHowever, I would warrant those with salt sensitivities, whether for health reasons or for personal palates, to be forewarned. And come with a gallon jug of water.\\n\\n***Edit\\n\\nWithin 2 weeks of my first visit, I found myself back at Ramen Tatsu-ya at the request of some friends who were excited to try it. \\n\\nI was worried about the salt concern so I went ahead and brought my 1L Nalgene bottle just to prepare myself. That's right folks, just like in college! \\n\\nAnyway, I tried the Tsukemen this time and...hands down, this TOTALLY should have been my first experience. This variety has you dip your noodles into the broth, which was less pork-ified this time around and much more mellow. The noodles are a bit chewier due to their thicker quality. It was so good. 5 stars!"},{"name":"Tropicana Cuban Restaurant","address":"9616 N Lamar Blvd, Ste 141","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I'm so incredibly impressed by this restaurant!

About 15 minutes later, she brought out some mussels again, and said she made fresh one for us. But it was the same issue. Ice cold mussels with a disgusting smell. \\n\\nThey were nice that they did not charge us for the mussels, but I will not be back again. Because their kitchen staff obviously didn't have the decency to cook the food to the proper temperature, it was frustrating that they didn't even microwave the food to make it hot.

We decided to give this place a try for lunch on a Sunday afternoon around 1, and despite the restaurant being busy, fortunately, we got a table right away. The dining room is big, and well decorated, with table cloths and comfortable chairs. The carts came by often, and there was plenty to choose from. However, we did not see the fried shrimp balls, nor the sesame balls we love to get. We tried asking about both things, but due to the language barrier, it was impossible to get our question across.. Instead, we happily tried a few new items, like these fried football shaped pork things, which we have no idea what they are called, but tasted great anyway! We also stuck with some of our faves, including the shrimp and mushroom shumai, the barbecue pork buns, and the shrimp dumplings. Each and every bite was terrific, and the portions were surprisingly large. For example, with regard to the shumai, the four on the plate, looked to be at least50% bigger than anything else we ever ordered. The quality and price are unbeatable, and I really appreciated the complementary hot tea that quickly arrived at our table before the dim sum did.  Oh, and they even brought us some sort of hot pepper sauce to accompany the foods. It was pleasantly spicy, and definitely enhanced the flavors! If we had to mention a negative about eating here, our one and only complaint would probably be their dim sum not always being hot. Some of the dishes were plain old cold or at room temperature, like those fried pork things, despite the cart person saying they had just been made. Also, we both wish this place had the fried shrimp and the sesame balls that I already talked about, unless, they usually do have them, but ran out that day.. If you're looking for cart service, with a huge assortment to pick from, and nice atmosphere to enjoy while dining, you've found it here!!!"},{"name":"South City Kitchen Midtown","address":"1144 Crescent Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Still 5 star.

This is easily in my top three Chinese restaurants in Boston, and the only one located in my neck of the woods instead of Chinatown (the other two are Gourmet Dumpling House and Taiwan Cafe).  Since 2004, I've consistently been getting great, authentic, home-style food, and even colleagues from China say this is one of their favorite, authentic restaurants.  I occasionally diverge from my usual order, and I'm 50/50 pleasantly surprised by my new orders.  I will admit that you'd have to know what to order in order to get delicious rather than Americanized food.  It's so delicious that I've never really thought much about service, though that said, in all these years, I've never really had a bad service experience.  Also, it's always filled with Chinese patrons, which is a good sign.\\n\\nMy favorites:\\nTwin lobster, ginger scallion (back page of the menu, great deal)\\nWhole tilapia or bass (back page of the menu, bone-in)\\nHouse imperial chicken (I wouldn't divulge this favorite unless I were moving, because it's my all-time favorite, and it's often sold out)\\nPoached chicken with salt (this tides me over when the house imperial chicken is sold out)\\nString beans Sichuan style with minced pork\\nEggplant with garlic sauce\\nSpinach with crab meat (not consistently everyone' s favorite, but I like it)\\nPea shoots (they're honest about whether they're fresh and tender that day, and if so, YUM)\\nMinced beef soup (it's an understated name, but has egg, scallion, cilantro, etc.)\\n\\nDislikes:\\nThe BU undergraduates always get these $7 rice plates, which I ordered once and see all too often - these are disgusting.  This is what I assume people mean when they say the food is \\"greasy,\\" because non of the authentic dishes are.  In general, anything with an all-too-recognizable American name that doesn't even exist in Chinese cooking (e.g., \\"orange chicken\\" or \\"boneless ribs\\") is not very good.

We were sat without water until someone came around to take our order and realized we didn't have water. No one ever came to refill our glasses after that initial glass of water.

This was completely new to me so quite honestly, I'm not sure what it's supposed to taste like, but I loved it. It reminded me of jambalaya and gumbo, both of which I loved. The bread that came with it? I could do without.

It's a challenge that has inherent risks that new choices might not stand up to the wonderful familiar choices, but someone has to do it and I'm in.  \\n\\nThe other part about this challenge is that with only two fellow adventurers with me, it's either going to take a lot of trips or I will need to order more food than we can possibly eat.  I went with option two since leftovers are usually welcome trophies to bring home.\\n\\nHere's what we had this time:\\n1 -Gai Hor Bai Toey deep fried marinated tender chicken wrapped in padumus leaves with special sesame sauce.  \\n2 -Som Tum  green papaya salad\\n3 -Chicken larb on lettuce (special request vs. default cabbage)\\n4 -Lemongrass chicken\\n5 -Pineapple fried rice with veggies instead of meat or tofu\\n\\n1 - very tasty, the sauce was a great addition.  There were 5 servings here, one was one huge piece of chicken that was tough to manage with only a fork, the others were a collection of small pieces.  The 2 meat eaters (my wife and me) both agreed they were very good.  Sadly, the one we brought home as a left over didn't fare well on reheating.\\n\\n2 -For our veggie daughter.  Very tasty - they create noodle looking strips of green papaya and add additional ingredients to make the salad.  We both felt that the spice level reflected native Thai spiciness - medium was spot on for both of us, hotter than that and we would have been in trouble\\n\\n3 - My second attempt was much more successful than the first.  I also ordered medium as I remembered how medium-hot was way over the top the first time here.  Asking for lettuce instead of cabbage was a huge win.  The serving was huge and it was easy to make lettuce \\"cups\\" of the spiced, seasoned ground chicken and share them.  If you look at this as an appetizer, it would easily feed 5-6 people.  As an entree, I took over half of it home.  I took some rice and packed this in on top to soak up the great sauce and it was amazing as a leftover.\\n\\n4 - Our second time with this.  It's good, it comes with a lot of broccoli.  My wife and I thought the peanut sauce might have been a little thick.  I will order the lemon chicken next time - it's a lot lighter and also does better if you take any home.\\n\\n5 - Wonderful!  We asked to substitute veggies for the protein choices and we were very pleased with the result.  Lots of veggie goodness in the fried rice with pineapple, something that we will repeat again soon.\\n\\nService continues to be top notch - the food came quickly and our water glasses were never empty.  It's a comfortable place to eat and a very pleasant experience.  This continues to be the place I want to take out of town visitors.  Unlike some places, I think this place really gets the spice level right.  If you ask for medium heat on a spicey dish, you will feel the heat.  Go hotter if you like, just be forewarned."},{"name":"Fat Matt's Rib Shack","address":"1811 Piedmont Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Stopped by today for a quick lunch and got there around 11:28.

The restaurant is flanked by restaurants Thai Lanna and Wing Ranch.\\n\\nMoon is a small, family owned and operated Indian restaurant and very much a hole in the wall.  The atmosphere is quiet and casual.  The inside consists mostly of booth seating.  At one end of the restaurant, there's a TV playing Indian programming.  Outside, there's additional seating on a covered patio.  Decor-wise, there's not much to speak of other than some traditional Indian artwork hanging on the walls.  You can tell from the furniture and overall condition of the restaurant that it's got some years on it.\\n\\nThe restaurant sells a good selection of Indian foods including samosas, pakora (fritters), soups, salads, tandoor-cooked meats (clay oven), biryani rice dishes, breads, and a variety of chicken, lamb, goat, seafood, and vegetable entrees.  At dinnertime, expect to spend about $10-15 per entree.  I visited for lunch where the weekday-only specials are a good value: between $7 to 9 for most entrees, which include soup, appetizer, vegetable curry, naan, and dessert.\\n\\nThe over 20 lunch specials include bhindi masala (okra), palak paneer (spinach and paneer cheese), tandoori chicken, chicken tikka masala, chicken korma, lamb vindaloo, and assorted biryani rice dishes.  My tablemates and I ordered the chicken curry, lamb curry, and lamb vindaloo.  Vindaloo is a type of curry that tastes sweet and sour.  It was hard to tell the three dishes apart as they looked virtually identical.\\n\\nThe owner served us.  He explained the lunch appetizer varies depending on what's available in the kitchen that day.  He offered to cook us any appetizer on the menu, but we opted for the day's default which turned out to be vegetable pakora.  These are mixed vegetable fritters.  We started out with these and soup, a mashed pea and lentil soup.\\n\\nThe soup had a small slice of lemon to provide a little tangy flavor.  The soup was light, clear, and refreshing.  It had small bits of lentil and chopped cilantro.  The pakora was accompanied by three sauces: an onion chutney, tamarind sauce, and mint sauce.  All went nicely with the pakora.  The pakora was also fine by itself.  The pakora were fried fresh and to this day, remain some of the crispiest and most savory Indian fritters I've tried.  They weren't overly greasy either.  Very tasty.\\n\\nFor the curries, I recommend medium spicy (they offer mild, medium, hot, and very hot) for most palates.  Mild offers basically no spice at all.  The lamb curry was okay.  The curry sauce was fragrant and flavorful and paired well with the soft, white, long-grain biryani rice.  The lamb meat was above-average tough and gamey, which led me to believe it was either frozen or overcooked (or both).  The vegetable curry had peas, carrots, onion, cauliflower, green beans, and green bell pepper.  Not bad.\\n\\nThe naan came directly baked from the oven.  The batch we received was particularly crispy, which I ended up liking very much.  I wouldn't mind if other Indian restaurants baked their normally-soft naan in this manner.\\n\\nService was excellent.  The owner was friendly, polite, and accommodating.  His daughters served the food.\\n\\nOverall, Moon is a nice little Indian restaurant.  I give it 3.5 stars rounded up to 4."},{"name":"Tasty Burger","address":"1301 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Has mice!! Told worker and she said yea we know! So gross.

I know this will sound a little weird because this place has great bbq and I have tried lots of their items but what keeps me coming back is their smoked bbq wings. These little guys are delicious! A lot of places when they smoke wings they don't do it right and they are usually rubbery in taste. Not here perfectly smoked and cooked every time.  You can get them dry or kick it up with their hot bbq sauce which is my favorite. My other favorite here because it's just simple is their coleslaw...it's just cabbage and a simple dressing that is delicious. \\n\\nI also wanted to mention that every time I have come here maybe by luck but I have had great service.

And if you're rocking a midday jaunt, look beyond the bento to the maki lunches, particularly that seared special ($15).\\n\\nFuji's recent explosive expansion has established a slick style of its own, and it's plainly evident in the WoC. Dare to compare? Take a peek at the original location eight blocks up Hancock Street. Newer sites embrace that nightclub sexiness, and polished service to boot. The plating is just as beautiful.\\n\\nOf course, it's the food that ultimately matters, and in this department, Fuji keeps it clean. Sashimi grade salmon gets a poke treatment with sharp red onion, sweet bell pepper and a dollop of roe on top. It's light, herbal and fairly delicate, a complementary topper to the crunchy, saltyj wontons used as a vessel to MouthTown. Population: your teeth. (Data provided by Mayor Tongue, 2017.)\\n\\nWith its location, reasonable lunch price points, and quick and poignant service, these tables turn quickly - it's a great spot for a business meeting or a quick nibble with friends.

The tuna melt was on point with a cheesy tuna filling with red peppers and corn on a crisp ciabatta bun.\\n\\nI dropped by for another visit in April and was surprised at how busy it was (as it was fairly quiet during my first drop-in). This time around, I ordered the Basil Pesto Turkey ($7.55) along with a 12oz Hot Chocolate ($4.15) and a Chocolate Chip Banana Bread ($2.80). I was a bit disappointed that my hot chocolate came in a paper cup instead of a mug but I was pleasantly pleased with the banana bread (love the way they made it into a banana shape). There were thin banana slices that were caramelized on the outside which had a nice light crunch to the exterior while the inside was soft and moist. It actually worked well dipping into my hot chocolate.\\n\\nWhile there was nothing wrong with the turkey melt, I personally think the tuna melt was better. The sandwich had a couple of layers of turkey breast slices, tomato, and cheese on the basil pesto draped grilled ciabatta bun.\\n\\nUndeterred, I returned for another visit and ordered the Basil Pesto Chicken ($7.55) which is essentially the same as the turkey version but with chicken instead and then paired it with a 12oz London Fog ($4.45) and a chocolate chip cookie for dunking.\\n\\nOverall, it's a nice little cafe shop for a quick bite."},{"name":"Fox Bros.

And when the waitress brought the tray of chilli sauce. 2 were missing. She apologize and said they have no more and that the other ones are being used by other diners. So instead of the tomatoe chilli sauce that is always what I like with my fresh rolls  I had dried chilli powder or some kind of liquid red sauce. I opted for the dried chilli powder and  with the peanut sauce it wasn't bad.  The Papaya salad was delicious  I just wish their was more of it. Very skimpy. Also I asked for Thai hot but it was more like a medium. Thanks Tom Kha was not what I was hoping for. It was more sour, and it didn't have that nice rich coconut milk broth that I've come to really like. The portion size is huge. Definitely enough to share. If that's all you order it will suffice to fill you up.  Again I requested Thai hot on the Tom Kha and it was mild. My companion liked his jumbo pawn with garlic and pepper.

Things started off poorly with parking, but I'm getting ahead of myself.\\n\\nTo be fair, I was out to K&D very close to when it first opened with a couple of foodie friends.  I would say that the experience was good, but not great.  That was a winter menu so after enough time I figured it was worth another go.  \\n\\nThe space is the old Nava space, which is very nice space near the One/Two Buckhead Plaza Office Buildings (time once was that I did business lunches once a week at Chops, but now lunches are moved elsewhere) and K&D lives in that same business lunch space coupled with in-town hip vibe.  The problem is, for as \\"money\\" as this place tries to be, the establishment is really just a poseur.  You used to walk up and drop your car at valet, no worries.  \\n\\nNow, King and Duke has turned so cheap but now they charge you to valet park!   It's all of $2, which isn't a big deal, but the valets make you pay BEFORE you go to the restaurant.  Why? Chops doesn't charge you and they're in the same area. Seasons 52 does charge you. Is King and Duke want to be more like seasons 52 or like chops?  I will tell you it's priced more like Chops, so the hurdle is there too.\\n\\nHonestly, I have lived in Philly, Chicago, Dallas, DC and Atlanta. I spend a lot of time on the road, I don't care about $2 to park; I usually tip $7-10 to valets, but making me pay up front?  That's just crass.  \\n\\nTo make things worse, the valets told me that they couldn't break a $50, so I had to \\"self-park\\" which they said was complimentary up to 2 hours with K&D validation.  I self parked which was something like 10 floors up and then hiked 10 minutes to K&D (hyperbole) and talked to the hostess, who was first really sweet, until I asked for the validation.  Curtly she just responded, \\"we don't validate self-parking\\".  \\n\\nSo then we sat down, had a look at the menu and saw that most of the menu was still set up with what the French would call Venison season dishes, meaning they were great heavy dishes like rabbit and steaks with earthy sauces.  The wine list is poor, unimaginative and over-priced.  I think they need more time actually tasting in the areas they sell wines from.  This was a lesson in wines too young from too big of houses.\\n\\nAfter waiting five minutes at the table and not meeting any waitstaff, we decided to cut our losses and run.  Sadly, we said good-bye to the hostess, who recognized us.  I half expected she would inquire what was wrong and ask to have us talk with a manager.  That didn't happen.  She just said good-bye.\\n\\nThis place is a classic plastic restaurant.  It's not well-managed and the service was poor, both in execution and in policy.  I would suggest that there are many better restaurants in Atlanta (and in every other major city of the US) with far less attitude.  I look forward to seeing what replaces King and Duke.\\n\\n\\ney don't take care of self parking.  I usually give valet 10 bucks but in this case it's just stupid.  They actually want you to pay two dollars when you park, before you come out. That's just idiotic.

I went on a Friday night with a friend.  It was pretty crowded, which I'd expect for a Friday night.  I like that they have live music. The hostess was nice and said there was only about a 20 min wait but we could sit at the bar while we waited.  We opted to do that, but then I think she forgot us and we ended up just eating at the bar.  We started with the queso fundido.  It was probably our favorite thing that we ordered.  It was really flavorful.  As to our meals, perhaps we came on an off night, or had different expectations of the menu.  A few items weren't available, and that left tacos, burgers, quesadillas as options on the menu.  They had some off the menu specials including an octopus dish and a sea food risotto.   My friend ended up trying the smoked chicken enchiladas, and I tried the seafood risotto. The seafood risotto looked really good, aesthetically.  It was a pretty big portion of clams, shrimp, and I think maybe scallops in rice with a tomato/lemony red sauce.  I give them credit for creativity, but it didn't seem like risotto to me.  It was more like a soupy paella.  The red sauce it was drenched in was decent, but overall my mind wasn't blown.  The side of freshly baked bread to soak up the sauce was a nice touch.  The bread had a nice crunchy crust and soft, fluffy middle.  My friend said his enchilada meal was also decent, but nothing ground-breaking.  It did look good though, so they do make a nice presentation.   We also had the sangria, and it was just standard to me.  I'm curious if they actually make it or it's just some bottled brand.   Other than that, the prices are kind of high.  My risotto special ended up being $30. I don't mind splurging on good food, but I kind of wished perhaps I tried the piri piri chicken instead.  Also, the service was kind of slow.  Our server was nice, but it took a while to get anything.  We ordered our appetizer pretty quickly, but it still probably took at least 40 minutes for that to arrive.  Also took a while for drink refills.  We're pretty low-maintenance, so we didn't care or say anything, but we still noticed the inattentiveness.  Overall, we didn't hate it, we didn't love it.  We found it acceptable.

I've eaten at RA before a few years ago and the food was great but the restaurant has definitely gone downhill since. We ordered tempura  Calamari and it was flavorless. The breading was gross and the sauce it came with tasted like water. The edamame was great though. Then we ordered the filet mignon sushi roll and it came out warm, the roll wasn't cooked, so it wasn't supposed to be warm. It wasn't fresh. Then we order the Chicken yakisoba and the chicken was the texture of beef jerky!!! I'm not exaggerating at all. The worst $60 we have ever spent on food.

For the sides, we got slaw and potato salad -- plus some bourbon banana pies. The brisket was as good as we had heard, but the ribs were the real star for me. They were so juicy and tender.

I am a 4th generation college park native and have lived here all my life. This is by far the worst pizza I have ever had in my life. I've seen pizza places come and go throughout the years and this has been the worst. Went with my girlfriend and we ordered a large pizza for ourselves. When they brought it out it was not fully cooked all the way with the most sauce I have ever seen on a pizza. Just picture a pizza with some cheese on it but drenched in sauce that covered most of the cheese. You take one bite and it's 80% sauce it felt like I was drinking pizza sauce with every bite. I took 2 bites and me and my girlfriend were so shocked someone would even consider presenting a pizza like this to a customer. It looked like a 5 year old threw together a bunch of cheese and sauce and just threw it in the oven. The cheese wasn't even melted all the way! The worst part about it was when we sent it back the manager was a complete a**hole about it. He questioned us and acted like he didn't owe us another pizza. This was one of the worst pizza experiences I've ever had and I consider myself a foodie. I'm writing this review because I love college park from the bottom of my heart and I want people to be cautious when going here. This place is awful and the manager is a complete dick.

Service was top notch, our waiter made sure the coffee was constantly flowing and checking to see if we needed anything throughout our dining experience. For pancakes, you can order less than the three on the menu. The kitchen accidentally gave me all three and I ordered two. The waiter noticed immediately and made sure we weren't charged for the full price. The fried chicken was one of the best I've ever tasted, the seasoning was in every single bite and mixed with the gravy  = heaven in a bite. Paired with cheese grits and it made for a pretty heavy meal but every bite was worth it. The lemon curd and blueberry pancakes were so good. My favorite part was having the blueberries inside the pancake itself. I love that it was not overly sweet.

I opted for a Southside, which was a lemon-mint gin drink.  It was made with a drier gin (Beefeater) and I enjoyed it immensely.  In addition to the cocktails, there was a decent draft/bottle beer list as well as a handful of wines available by the glass.  \\n\\nThe food menu seems focused on starters and plates to share as opposed to entrees.  Nothing in the entree list really resonated with me the night I visited, so the group (and thanks to reading Yelp reviews in advance) opted to go for a couple of drinks and a snack or two before venturing somewhere else for mains.  Our server highlighted a few options that were his favorites, though until we looked at the menu we thought that they were specials for the night.  Some highlights of what we chose were the fry sampler (a combination of white and sweet potato fries with ketchup and a truffle mayo) and the flatbread.

Jinya is a blessing for ATL and I'm grateful for them. Their ramen broth is flavorful and the ramen serving size that comes with each bowl is perfect to me, not too much and not too little. However, I do have my complaints about this well loved ramen house:\\n\\n1) Two slices of pork in each bowl of ramen is quite the joke when the pieces we got recently were 3/4 fat all around. My fianc√© who usually eats fatty pork without blinking actually got rid of the pork fat and only ate the miniscule amount of meat that was found on mine and his pork slices. Never had this problem previously so was kinda surprised when it happened. \\n\\n2) One thing that bothers me for the longest time since my fianc√© started coming here before I even moved to ATL... Upcharge for basic toppings (think green onion, fried onion, nori etc.)? What a scrooge! Sure they are running a business and they should be making a profit but truly, these items aren't even expensive to begin with and they could have been given out for free. I'm pretty sure not everyone asks for more basic toppings so it's not like Jinya would be hemorrhaging money. \\n\\n3) Funny how our server and the manager would come ask us if everything was fine but none of them were attentive enough to see if our water glasses needed to be refilled. It's as though they were operating on an auto-pilot mode, just ask the standard question because it's customer service etiquette but simply don't mean the customer service! The only time we were finally asked if we needed a refill was immediately after my fianc√© asked for the check. Go figure.\\n\\n4) Server who dealt with the split checks at the table next to us mixed up the cards. This was just a 2-person table (probably co-workers lunching together).

We asked to sit at the bar to watch Sunday Night Football. We ordered a couple bottles of soju and a pitcher of beer. Drinks here are standard -- I mean its just bottled soju and Bud Light -- really can't go wrong. \\n\\nWe ordered a seafood pancake and a dukbokki with cheese. The food here is pretty good. They mistakenly gave our seafood pancake to the wrong table, but gave us a bottle of soju on the house while we waited for them to make another one. Props to them for this one especially because we were just about to order another round. \\n\\nHowever, the reason I am giving three stars is because of the service at the bar. We chose Sojuba because of their five monitors in the back to watch a huge football game. Me and my friends had a lot riding on this game for Fantasy Football purposes. I understand if there was another big sporting event on, but the TVs were on Bob's Burgers and Poker. \\n\\nI asked our waitress if we could change one of the monitors to the football game and she said she didn't know how to change the channel. Then I asked another waiter, and he said didn't know how to use the TV, but he would try, and we watched him walk back and forth at the TV and then proceeded to just walked away... He didn't even come back to the table to let us know that he couldn't figure it out. \\n\\nI ended up walking up to the bar and asking him a second time, which is when he told me that only the manager knew how to change the channel. He added that the manager would be in much later in the night, but refused when I asked if he could call the manager for help now. I find it hard to believe that at a restaurant/bar that there was no one working that knew how to use the iPad to change a channel for us. I think every bartender should know how to work the TVs at their bar. \\n\\nEventually, the owner did come in and was super nice about changing the channel for us. Again, I don't think it was a super ridiculous request for them to change one of the five monitors to the football game.

Immediately I was happy about my choice when my entrees were presented in front of me.  The biscuit had gravy that just covered the sandwich; it makes my mouth water just thinking about it.

Our waiter brought us some kind of butter that made the waffle taste like a sweet potato pie!  We didn't even the gravy.  My love got the shrimp and grits.  That did not disappoint either.

The food was really hit or miss, some was good (4 stars), some just OK. Nothing extremely special. Crab rangoon dip was a good starter, very light and a good balance of crab and cheese. Burgers were really tasty and came out hot, but fries on the side were cold and flavorless and there really weren't many for a $15 burger. Unfortunately, one member of my party got a medium well burger and it came out rarer than my medium rare of the same burger. Server took it away and promised to bring a replacement - which never arrived, even after everyone else finished eating (30 min). The server took it off the bill but never gave an apology. Overall, service was inattentive, impersonal, and lackluster. Server refilled drinks only once the full time we were there, over an hour and a half. the mango ginger margarita was just OK, the  cheeseburgushi was definitely more gimmicky than a great meal, and the bento had good sushi, but the other elements were just filler and didn't add to the meal.

The first two times were for dinner and we sat at the bar.  Service was great, and the food was, too.  They have some very interesting takes on comfort food.  The tea sandwiches were more than we expected, and delicious.  The kale salad was also well made.  We've also had the pork chop, the meatloaf (mmmm) and the fried chicken.  All were excellent.\\n\\nThe reason it was a mixed bag was our decidedly off-point experience at lunch on a Saturday.  Maybe that's when they bring in the B team, but it was a flop from start to end.  Our waiter kicked it off by showing up well after we were seated.  He took our orders and didn't mention that the roasted chicken would take quite a bit of time.  Part of our drink order arrived, and we had to remind him about the remainder.  Then when the food did arrive, the chicken was literally raw inside.  The outside had a nice char to it but the center was completely raw--clearly someone made a big mistake in the kitchen, so we waited, and waited, and when the waiter finally showed up again we asked him to take it back and bring another cocktail while we selected something else.  I don't know how long he was gone, but he never did come back on his own and it appears he didn't order the drink either--we had to go to the bar and ask for him to make another appearance so we could get the check and go.  Had it not been for the raw chicken, i would have chalked it up to just an epic fail on the waiter's part.  Having sat at the bar several times I believe they're very good.  But raw chicken is not good--period.

I could eat this every day. \\n\\nSaliva chicken is a chicken that has been cooked, I believe boiled in a stock. And then cooled and slice with the bone in. The chicken is then submerged in a bowl of chili oil and topped with sesame seed and scallion. The result is tasty. Cold chicken is tender with good flavor by itself. Delightfully chewy skin. Pepper oil lends some complexity. However, I felt the oil was a bit much, kind of overkill. I know that is the style, but the oil has a stale quality to it, which I didn't like. I would have liked a change of pace here. Or a deeper/fresher pepper flavor. \\n\\nMapo Tofu is soft and can be challenging to pick up with chopsticks. Again, lots of chili oil and chili flakes. A spicy dish best had with rice, which helps to absorb excess oil and can act as a delivery system for the tofu.\\n\\nShuizhu Fish is fish fillets loaded with Sichuan peppercorns, peppers flakes, chili oil. In addition to the oil, is a starchy broth. Fish are also coated in starch, which assists the oily broth to stick. The fish has a mildly fishy flavor. Everything is coming from the broth. Bits of cucumber are on the bottom, fish them out for some textural nuance. Cucumber actually helps to cut through the oily, I wish there was more of them. Or maybe something to provide some balance.

The biscuit was perfect. I loved the pimento cheese and the sausage was extremely flavorful and juicy. It all went together so nicely. \\n\\nTHE TOTS. They were just as amazing as I knew they would be, if not better. I didn't even need the ketchup because the taste of the tots was too good to cover up. I \\"accidentally\\" ordered two orders. ;)\\n\\nThere was quite a line when we pulled up, but the line moved quickly and we found a spot to sit outside on the back patio.

The hype is real. The Yelp reviews might as well be a massive debate on the value of the food vs the wait in line. \\n\\nThe underlying question is really this: \\"Is there a better brisket somewhere else?\\"\\n\\nFor me? This is the best brisket I've ever had. Whether it's worth the wait in line is a completely independent question altogether. And fortunately, there's a solution to the dilemma, and that's the current preorder system they have online. Sure it'll be an order you'd have to make weeks in advance. Sure there's deposit you'll have to put down. But if you're a planner like myself, planning for a food experience shouldn't be too difficult to do.\\n\\nOn to the food eats.\\nTop on the list is the brisket. Fatty brisket. I've had friends say it's \\"melt in your mouth\\" level. Let's be realistic guys. If meat really dissolved in your mouth, I wouldn't really trust it. The brisket in this case breaks apart in your mouth really easily. Definitely a tender, tender meat.\\nNext are the ribs. I'm not even a rib guy. This is fall off the bone (with a little shaking) level. And great seasoning too! \\nOn the same tier is, weirdly enough, the underdog Turkey. To have turkey meat that's tender and juicy like a brisket, I was definitely surprised that meat could turn out like that.\\nSausage was good. Not amazing, but it can hold it's own. Light, no need for sauces, no complaints, no high praises either.\\nPulled pork was probably the lowest on my list. Maybe because I was so impressed with the other meats, that subconsciously made me a tad underwhelmed with the pulled pork. But I'd probably never order this again.\\n\\nTry it.

Then you've come to the right place. The Butcherie.\\n\\nWe headed here today after stopping at a Judaica store across the street and weren't disappointed. This place has every type of Passover food imaginable...but you pay the price. The Butcherie has a monopoly on everything kosher, and if I had the clams (oops. Not allowed to eat clams. I mean moolah.), I'd open a grocery store that could compete directly with this kosher-only establishment. No one seems to mind shelling out (oops. No shell fish allowed.) for the goods. In fact, I spent about $30 on four items. Couldn't believe it. And I skipped the $15.99/lb kosher brisket this trip. That would have tacked on another $64 or so. Yikes.\\n\\nThe meat, frozen food, and prepared food departments are well-stocked, and the wine offerings are extensive. Israeli import items and ethnic foods abound. Whereas Stop and Shop in Lexington (where I usually get my Kosher foods during the Jewish holidays) has one whole aisle dedicated to Passover items (I make the trip to Lexington because my local supermarkets generally have only one box of matzoh, macaroons, and jelly candies, and I obviously need more than that to sustain us for eight days), The Butcherie is ALL Passover during the eight-day holiday. I'm from the Bronx, and this type of store is pretty typical in the five boroughs, but it always surprises me that Brookline has something similar. \\n\\nDuring non-holiday times, this supermarket has delicious deli meats and breads and other wonderful items...all kosher, all the time. \\n\\nHint: Don't go on a Friday morning cuz it's packed, and of course, it's closed on Saturday. Also, parking can be difficult; there's a lot in the back of the store, but it's hard to find spots there, too. Today we lucked out.

I prefer bigger pieces of chocolate with a nice bite.\\n\\nThe white chocolate macadamia cookie was a similar situation. I'm not sure I got any pieces of macadamia, so it tasted more like a white chocolate cookie, which is a cookie that needs balance and nuance. The one note sweetness of the white chocolate becomes dull after a few bites.\\n\\n As an ice cream sandwich the cookies and ice cream probably work together much better. But tossing some of the cookie on top of the ice cream, or trying to mash in some cookie with the ice cream did not yield a sum greater than its parts. Rather, the ice cream was overpowered by the cookie. Furthermore, the cookie is already so soft and chewy, it doesn't add a very tantalizing texture to contrast the ice cream.\\n\\nAgain, if I had consumed the ice cream and cookies in the intended ice cream sandwich format, the results may have been better.\\n\\nHowever, the ice cream by itself is satisfactory in terms of taste and texture.

They're going for the city-trendy look (as opposed to industrial-trendy or modern-trendy I guess) and there was a black, white, silver and red color palette that screamed kind of 2003 to me. They have 2 floors, a main bar and an upstairs dining area that can be reserved for private parties.

There's a stage, big 'U' shaped bar and lots of tables.\\n\\nBf and I found the last 2 open spots at the bar and bellied up.

That's what everyone seems to be complaining about. And, to be fair, everyone is right. Near the water, right next to Quincey Market, if you don't make money off of tourists, where are you going to make your money?\\n\\n$20 for a lobster roll that's half of the size of a normal lobster roll and a few pieces of fruit, that's not really affordable...even Quincey Market is cheaper than that and that's one huge tourist trap.\\n\\nBut what *is* worth it is their lobster deal.\\n\\nWe went here today for lunch and sat out in the patio due to their advertisement of 1 lobster for $14 and 2 lobsters for $27. We see this every time we walk by and this time we finally went in.  The lobsters are exactly what you would expect: fresh 1lb lobsters steamed. How can you go wrong? It also comes with fries (meh) and coleslaw (good).\\n\\nWhat is kinda dumb though is that if you want to get the 2 lobster deal and share it, they will charge you an extra $6. That makes NO sense since you get get the single ones for half the price and get coleslaw and fries for two....*raises eyebrow*\\n\\nTheir clam chowder is not bad. 3.99 for a cup and 7.99 for a bowl. The clams are big and juicy and they add bacon in the chowder. Some might like the flavour and some might find the bacon flavour undermines all other flavours in the chowder. I think it's okay once in a while, but i definitely would prefer chowder that has more seafood essence. \\n\\nIt was a busy Saturday afternoon, but we didnt have to wait to get a seat outside and did some nice people watching (more like watched by people because everyone is staring at our lobsters while walking by). \\n\\nAgain, the only thing worth it here is their lobster deal, everything else is just overpriced."},{"name":"Don Dario's","address":"8801 S I H 35","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"We LOVE this hidden gem!

For the most part we have had pleasurable experiences, good food and decent service. Until recently we have experience less than satisfactory service from the staff and more importantly the owner whom is NOT FRIENDLY. The last straw was this last Sunday night we took our 9 mo old baby and 3yr old daughter with us to meet my friend and her fianc√© for dinner. The service we received was NOT up to par, the waitress was slow, we didn't have napkins, water, appropriate silver ware or sauces at our table and we had to continually ask for what we needed. The waitress was not familiar with the menu and we probably saw her a total of 3 times throughout our entire meal. When it came time to receive our check I noticed that they had added 18% gratuity.. For a party of essentially 4? We had a baby and a small child that did not even eat.. This didn't sit right with me. Now don't get me wrong I have no problem tipping for decent service but to have gratuity added to our Small party after having bad service is NOT OK. I took my ticket to the register, where the owner happened to be and I politely asked if it is normal to add gratuity to a party of four? She said we have a party of 6, I was puzzled. I asked, \\"A 9 month old baby counts?!\\" The kids didn't even eat.. She argued with me saying that they took a seat and that people are bad tippers and that is how her employees make money. I said I don't have a problem tipping for good service, but to expect it and implement it is not ok. She was NOT happy and NOT friendly. She took it off but said she would not do it again. I paid my $42 bill with NO tip. I'm sorry but after that no way am I leaving a tip. We packed up and left I was polite the entire time, as we left I said good bye and thank you.. The owner ignored me and would not even look at me. Today I checked my bank statement and they ran a $5 tip on my card anyway.. THIS IS NOT OK. I will never be going back and I will tell everyone I know the same thing. We were regular paying customers and this is how they treat people??!

Some of my favorite menu items: Halva Rose, Morning Bun, Flourless Brownie, Nut Boxes (especially pistachio), Fattoush Salad, Breakfast Sandwich, and beet and short rib grilled cheese!"},{"name":"Zabu Chicken","address":"1635 Robson Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"Surprisingly good K-chicken for Vancouver.\\n\\nWhile not the best (experienced in NYC), this poulet is pretty damn tasty.\\n\\nSomewhat still drunk, when handed the menu, all I saw was chicken so saved time by asking the server what were the #1 and #2 picks.

We took an Uber.  I was so grateful for Uber that day because god was threatening to piss on my surprise.  It made me reflect on how far we've come as a civilization. \\n\\nDo you think the Pilgrims ever envisioned Uber?  It took them twenty minutes just to yoke the horses to the carts.  Often, the horse was the only family member left because all the relatives died during the voyage from England.\\n\\nWe are lucky.\\n\\nWhich is what I kept reminding myself as I stepped into a puddle right outside A&H.  Normally, I'd have been cursing and making references to the Kashmir conflict.  But it was my girlfriend's birthday and I was determined to provide a much-needed romantic touch to the evening.\\n\\nWe were seated and essentially given a seminar on the menu by our 1% body fat waiter, a self-professed vegetarian who tolerated my menacing glare and awful jokes for longer than he should have.\\n\\nWe ordered the strip steak, the charred broccoli, the eggplant with peanuts in it, and the bluefish.  How was it?  Do you want me to be honest?  You asked for it.\\n\\nI came.\\n\\nMy hyper-macho dad would disown me if he read this but I have never enjoyed broccoli that much.  When they said charred, they meant charred.  It tasted like it had just come off a Neanderthal man's stack of coals.  The char and light seasoning had me hip-checking the birthday girl just to get more.  \\n\\nMiss K!!\\n\\nI forgot about Miss K.\\n\\nI looked over.  She'd helped herself to some of my steak, medium rare, which was delicious and creamy.  You know a piece of red meat is good when its texture is quasi-creamy in the middle.  The strips of eggplant, split down the middle with peanuts in them, perfectly complemented the raw, meaty flavor of the strip steak.\\n\\nBut the star of the show?  The bluefish.\\n\\nThis was a cuboid piece of fish that was grill-charred on the outside and so creamy on the inside, I thought I would need a spoon to scoop it up.  It was hands down the most motherfucking great piece of fish I have ever tasted in my life.  My Mom was my idol for grilled/fried fish but I'm dumping that little Indian midget now that I've tasted A&H's bluefish.\\n\\nAll this was enough for two people.  The servings weren't too large but they weren't tapas small either, especially the strip steak.  That's probably the one dish that's enough for one person.  Keep that in mind when you go here.  A fantastic touch, by the way, is the pickled green beans that they serve you right before the food comes out.  It is way better than bread, in my opinion, because the tangy flavors stimulate the appetite instead of, as our server put it, \\"weigh you down.\\"\\n\\nBrilliant.  My hat is off.\\n\\nSpeaking of the service, you are basically guaranteed informative, attentive service.  You're paying a pretty penny so make the most of it.  Ask them a lot of questions, aggressively get their attention, or do whatever else you need to do to get your money's worth.  They are there to help.\\n\\nFinally, after we had polished off our food, our server quietly slithered up to our table with an apple cake and compote, a candle sticking out of the cake, and wished Miss K a happy birthday.\\n\\nMiss K, completely unaware of this, looked at me and called me an utter sneak.  Then she punched my lights out.  Kidding, of course.  She dug into the cake and the two of us finished it off along with most of the compote.\\n\\nMost days in our relationship, I can be myself.  And I'm a crass, comical piece of shit.  I make her laugh but it's usually not with romantic subject matter.  So, for the sake of her birthday, I had been on my best behavior all day.  But that was only temporary.  I was coming loose at the seams.  I can't not be myself for too long.\\n\\nAfter dessert, we settled into a serene, digestive stupor wherein we both sat quietly, occasionally looking at each other but mostly looking around at our surroundings.  Right before we left, Miss K caught me staring intently at the glass roof above our heads (we were in the booth area right behind the hostess's stand).\\n\\n\\"What are you looking at?\\" she asked innocently, possibly expecting a philosophical answer.\\n\\n\\"I was just wondering what a pair of naked butt cheeks would look like pressed up against that glass.\\"\\n\\nI flew out of my seat to dodge the fist coming my way and used the momentum to launch myself into the street.  Hand-in-hand, belt buckles ready to burst, we walked out of Alden & Harlow, satisfied, in love, and breaking wind like a couple of Dutch windmills."},{"name":"Union Oyster House","address":"41 Union St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I hoped it's more fresh.

I got the ribs, Mac & cheese, and baked beans. The ribs were perfect exactly how they came out (I didn't care for the BBQ sauce that much).

Don't come here on a Friday night if you can't handle noise. The whole place is packed and all the table are super close to each other. Also plan on waiting at least 30 min around dinner time if not an hour. There is definitely a buzz about this place because as soon as you pull up all you see is people lined up out the door. \\n\\nI was super excited to try out this place when I visited Portland because it had so many good reviews. Not to mention I love Southern/Creole style food. Spice is my life! The portions are huge and we knew that going in but we still ordered 3 entr√©e's because we live in Washington and knew we wouldn't be back anytime soon to try it again. We ordered the Carolina Pulled Pork, House Smoked Beef Brisket, and Screen Door Plate (Chicken and Sausage Gumbo, Mac & Cheese, and 3-crispy fried chicken drumsticks. My wife also tried their special of the day Salad. \\n\\nThe Carolina Pulled Pork has a little kick to it. Enough that my daughter wasn't a fan. I thought it was okay but their BBQ sauce wasn't good at all. At least they didn't drench the pork in it otherwise I would have been really disappointed. The Brisket was good. It had a nice bark on but very little smoke to it. You can even see in the picture I took that the smoke ring isn't very visible. It came with baked beans which you could tell they make in house. They were good and smoky in their flavor not sweet like canned baked beans. The drumsticks were probably my favorite. The had a thick bread crumb coating on them and were seasoned really well. It was classic fried chicken with a golden crisp on the outside and really moist juicy chicken on the inside. Honestly go for a fried chicken dish if you go, they do it right. The mac n cheese was also good but not the best I've had in Portland. For really good mac n cheese go to Podnah's Pit. My biggest disappointment was in the Gumbo. It was terrible. I don't think any of us took more than one bite. It had no southern style flair to it. I wouldn't be surprised if it came straight out of a can in the back. It was super bland and has so little meat in it I thought it should have been labeled as a rice soup. Do not get it! I didn't taste my wife's salad because there was so much food but the reason she asked for one was because of her disappointment in the overall food. \\n\\nI think in order to give this place a fair shake we should come back for breakfast which looks like their specialty from other reviewers and photo's. They do a good fried chicken and we really only had a small sample of it but I was impressed by it."},{"name":"Andina Restaurant","address":"1314 NW Glisan St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Wow. I did a lot of research before this last trip to Portland. I was looking for: romance, decadence, and a restaurant that had a mix of foods I'd seen and experienced before, as well as a few new ones. I'm so glad I decided on Andina because it delivered on all accounts.\\n\\nOur reservation was for 8:00PM on Sunday 4/7/13. We arrived about 15 minutes early, and decided to sit in the bar and order a drink while we waited for our table. A little after 8:00 we moved to our table in the main dining area, which was nice. The table was more secluded, not as cramped, and the music from the bar section was a little more toned down. The atmosphere was funky, fun, sexy, and romantic, and all of the staff were kind, accommodating, and helpful. Incidentally, we were sat in a little alcove with two tables with another visiting couple, and we had a blast with them too.\\n\\nAs for the food and drink, I had the \\"Sexy Woman\\" cocktail, which I enjoyed immensely. I was worried it would be too sweet, but it wasn't, and the habanero vodka worked so well. I later had a Pisco Sour which was delightfully citrus-y, but I liked the first cocktail more. We had four tapas, and along with the complimentary bread with salsa, and dessert, we left satisfied:\\n\\nSteak tartare (small). My Fiancee ate this one, as I don't eat beef. He liked it very much.\\n\\nYucca Croquettes (small). I love these. Yucca doesn't have much flavor on its own, but the texture was wonderful, and the cotija cheese mixed with the yellow pepper sauce was so enjoyable.\\n\\nSeared Diver Scallops (medium). They were very well cooked. The sear may have been a little too much for some, but I loved it. \\n\\nAvocado stuffed with crab (small). This was probably the most familiar of the dishes we had. The avocado was perfect (I think it goes without saying a good avocado is heavenly, but a bad avocado is a disaster!), and the crab stuffing portion was very generous.\\n\\nDessert: We had the dessert special which was a little out there. It involved pink peppercorn mousse, dried strawberry and pistachio brittle, and beer sorbet... yeah... beer sorbet. That was the selling point, and to be honest, it was also the star of the dessert. I wish the mousse had been more... peppery. It wasn't at all. It was quite good, but not what I was expecting.\\n\\nOur waiter was so sweet. He repeated everything we needed him to, and had great suggestions. I never felt like he was trying to up sell us. He was just honest. We want an excuse to go back and try other things. I can't wait.

We are a family of 5 (1 son stayed home) and we have ALWAYS been able to order an addition meal and pack it up at the table as Border Cafe is dine in only. The Harvard Sq. Manager refused to allow the order! Yes, we debated for 10 minutes the value of customer service and expectations, but the reasoning was that they use a bio-degradable container and food would not be as good. I get it, but that is my decision, not theirs. Crazy in these social media days. I cancelled my meal and had my sons meal sit in front of me while the rest of the family ate. I packed it up as leftovers and went on my way. Needless to say, I am disappointed and discouraged by the Managers decision to allow me to sit there without eating. The waitstaff did everything she could by bringing extra chips and soda. She seemed really embarrassed by the ordeal.

This is the only place in Boston you can get delicious Israeli food.\\n\\nHit the deli counter for cold cuts and pick up your lox here.  Great prepared foods like stuffed cabbage in the fridge here too.  I *love* the Israeli Mexican turkey.  Yup, you read that right.  It has this amazing seasoning.\\n\\nIsrael is called the land of milk and honey for a reason -- best dairy products you will ever eat.  The cottage cheese is amazing and the yogurts and various cheeses are also good.  Shoko is the yummiest chocolate milk ever, and it comes in these plastic baggies that you poke a hole in and drink out of.  But what you want to get is a MILKY.  It's pudding with whipped cream on top and it will make you cream your pants.  \\n\\nWhen I was vegetarian and vegan, this place was a lifesaver.  It's a little known fact that Israel has the 2nd highest proportion of faith based vegetarians in the world (with India obviously bneing #1).  Also, because of the meat/dairy restrictions in Judaism, religious Israelis often eat vegetarian meat substitutes at meals so they can also eat dairy.  So, point is, a lot of really interesting vegetarian things.  I used to get these \\"vegetarian scallops\\" a lot.  They were nothing like scallops, but I loved 'em.  Also, fake meat patties galore, weird veggie canned weiners, and more.\\n\\nDuh, this is where you should go for hummus.  If you eat Cedar's or some shit and you live in Brookline, I probably can't be your friend.  The Sabra is great and the brand in the rectangular containers is also delicious.\\n\\nGreat bread.  Babka, a Russian bread filled with chocolate, is awesome.  This is also the go to place for pitas.  But a ton and freeze them and then pop them in the toaster when you need them.  Dip in that hummus and consume.\\n\\nNow, head to the freezer section.  Get yourself some bourekas -- phillo pastry filled with cheese or spinach.  Get some cigars, which are dough filled with potato or meat.  Then get MALAWACH.  This stuff is sooo bad for you but so good.  It's this greasy, greasy, flaky, greasy bread that is awesome with some hummus.  It will change your life, and so will the heart attack it gives you.  Grab some blintzes too -- the Israeli ones, not the ones you can buy in Stop and Shop.\\n\\nHit the chocolate aisle too and get some Pesek Zman bars and some mekupelet.  Then, go to the chip aisle.  You want Bamba -- these peanut butter puffy corn things.  Then get some Bissli -- another snack available in lots of flavors.  You want BBQ and falafel flavor.  If you want to be fancy like I was as a kid, impale a piece of bamba with a piece of bissli.  \\n\\nDon't expect the Russian ladies at the registers to be nice to you, that isn't how it works.\\n\\nDon't try to come on a Fri night or Saturday unless you want to look longingly through the windows at the delicious goodness you can't buy."},{"name":"Se7en Bites","address":"617 N Primrose Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"ACCIDENTALLY PARKED in their lot not realizing it was their lot since there was no sign.

I ordered the Se7en Benedict for breakfast, which consists of a buttermilk garlic biscuit, over medium egg, crispy green tomato, applewood smoked bacon, topped with peppercorn hollandaise.  I really enjoyed the flavor of the dish, especially the bacon, which was cooked perfectly, as well as the fried green tomato, and the peppercorn hollandaise.  However, I was a little disappointed in the biscuit, as I thought it was a little dry and also would have preferred it to be served cut in half with another egg.  I'm not sure I would order this dish again and would try something different next time.\\n\\nI came here to order a special someone the chicken pot pie so she could have it for lunch.  Apparently it's only sold on Thursdays and Fridays starting at 11:00 a.m., and she could never get here on those days before it was sold out.  I got here about 2 hours too early, so I decided to study and eat breakfast while I waited.  The staff was extremely helpful and friendly.  They took the chicken pot pie order when I originally got there and promptly at 11:00 a.m. I was handed a to-go box of a freshly made pie.  The place wasn't very crowded either for the hours I was here during a weekday, so it was a decent place to get some studying done.\\n\\nThey have a bakery section which consists of cookies, cakes, moon pies, brownies, you name it!  Everything looked amazing and was difficult not to order more than one thing.  I opted for the vanilla bean, bourbon, bacon moon pie.  It was really delicious!

And a pretty successful one at that.\\n\\nWe came here straight from the airport at around 11am on a Saturday, ravenously hungry. Got our names in, and were seated just before 12pm. Considering we came at the peak time, not terrible, but since we were so hungry, not ideal either, haha. There are a couple benches inside for people to wait for their table, and the actual inside is laid out sort of like a diner, albeit in a more rustic theme. \\n\\nWe ordered the chicken and waffles, as well as the beef hash.The mountain of fried chicken (3 full boneless breast pieces) is enough to feed 2 people for sure, and the sweet potato waffle was pretty light and delicious as well. The fried chicken itself is crispy, heavy on the black pepper, and not too greasy, although the batter did skew a bit salty. Nonetheless, if you pour enough maple syrup on it, there's a bit more sweet and savory balance to the dish, so I guess that's what they were going for. The beef hash was pretty tasty too, and had probably the closest thing to vegetables we could find on the menu. Ha. Good thing we were on vacation, right?\\n\\nI guess the only knock was that the service was not particularly attentive or friendly, but I guess they got the job done, it was super busy, and it wasn't enough to ruin our experience. Yet, we ended up waiting about 30 minutes for our chicken, which wouldn't have been a problem, if we hadn't seen about 3 other tables who had been seated after us get their food before us. They had ordered the same items as well. Our waitress just shrugged. Meh. Anyways, prices are pretty dang reasonable here, as the mountain of fried chicken was only about $15, and the rest of the menu is comparable, with about the same portions.\\n\\nOverall, I recommend coming here for sure, but you gotta figure out the off-peak times, like weekday mornings or a super late weekend brunch.

I gotta say I'm absolutely floored by how awful the customer service at this location is. It's a bummer because I like the pizza Hot Lips makes, but after today I'll be taking my business elsewhere. Real quick, let me recap my last three visits to this location:\\n\\n3rd to last visit: Was waiting on an order around 9:20pm when a guy and his son come in. He orders a few slices and pays and says he'll be sitting out at the tables outside. She says she'll call his name when his order is up. The place is dead, nobody else except for us. The pizza is ready, she puts it out on the counter, then ever-so-quietly speaks his name. So quiet that I thought she was joking. She then looks back over her shoulder, makes direct eye contact with the guy (who obviously didn't hear her whisper his name), then looks away. She knew he didn't hear her, she knew he was waiting for his pizza, but she just stood there looking straight forward like some robot. It was the most awkward and lame thing ever. I eventually went over and told the guy his pizza was ready. \\n\\n2nd to last visit: I order a slice of pepperoni. The woman who took my order took the slice and put it in the oven to heat it up. The second she closed the oven she walked to the back and maybe 2 seconds later another woman comes from the back, opens the oven and takes my slice out. I kindly let her know the pizza had been in the oven maybe not even 10 seconds and probably needs more time. This woman then proceeds to give me the glare of death, then sarcastically say \\"well I guess you know my job better than I do\\" before slamming the oven door shut and walking off.\\n\\nMy last visit: I order a slice. The total comes to $4.25, so I pay with my credit card. I then drop 2 one dollar bills in the tip jar. Unfortunately I left my tip in the split second when she was turned around and didn't see. As I'm flipping through my phone waiting for my order, I hear the woman who took my order and another employee kinda mumbling under their breath, then I hear her say \\"and of course he didn't leave a tip\\", so I look up and they're both looking at me, then the guy employee lets out this sarcastic laugh. She then takes my slice out, puts it in the to-go box and literally flings it across the counter and turns her back on me, saying nothing.\\n\\nMind you, I tipped 50% for this 'service'. I normally don't tip for counter service, but I was in a good mood and wanting to share positive vibes. All it got me was the ire of employees, all because I didn't announce to the store that I tipped them. Honestly, what an embarrassing position to put a customer in.\\n\\nHot Lips management: want to know how to lose a customer for life? Read the above. I've seen enough uncomfortable situations at this location to know these problems are systemic and management has certainly got to be aware of these issues at this location.

I finally got to try Franklin's brisket fresh and not cold and unimpressively in the form of a slider that I had once at an event last year.

How cool is he and how lucky do I feel?!\\n\\nIs the brisket as good as it gets? The answer to that is a big ol' YES! Are some bites hard to distinguish between other Texas brisket? Yes to that too actually, but then there are those magical bites which are like no other brisket you've ever tasted. As good as those bites are by themselves, to me, they become other worldly with that espresso bbq sauce. Can I sign up to get that s*$# shipped to me weekly?? I mean these are the kind of bites that cause uncontrollable cursing and immense feelings of gratitude for your dealer and the food gods.\\n\\nI can now say that the awards and recognition Aaron and co are receiving are well deserved.

I can not justify a 5 star rating anymore. Their food is still great, their sashimi is still high quality, but they are getting very sloppy and inconsistent. When we visit Orlando (4-5 times a year 10-14 days at a time) we usually come here every other day. On this current trip (this was our fourth visit on this trip) we have been disappointed. \\n\\nThe biggest problem is consistency; I understand that its in a tourist area but that should not change the way things are made on a daily basis. We had the Firecracker roll a few nights ago because I was a little chilly and I wanted the temperature contrast of the Tempura Shrimp with the fresh fish. My shrimp was precooked and cold. I did not say anything until the end as we were in a hurry to catch a movie. The general manager was great, apologized and offered to take it off our bill which we refused and just asked for the food to be to their standards.\\n\\nWe went back again a few days later and ordered the Firecracker as an appetizer to see how it would come out; once again it was made with cold shrimp. Our server took care of it and got us a new one made and it was as it should been the first time, delicious. We then ordered the Boss Roll and it was sloppy. The promptly remade it and it came out as expected, beautiful and delicious. I could go on about how good the food is like the Togarashi Shrimp but it never tastes the same twice. Or the fact that the last four meals their was no wasabi on the Nigiri. I know that's a little thing but the little things matter.\\n\\nEven with all this, I would highly suggest you give Cowfish a try. We will be back a couple times this week and I hope that I will be able to at least raise it to a 4 star, preferably the 5 star that it should be.\\n\\nI look forward to visiting every time I come to Orlando, usually our first stop.

I didn't get to try the carne asada, chicken madeira, or chicken enchilada, but my sister, her husband, and my nephew all devoured it and did say it tasted good. I tried a piece of my husband's piri piri chicken which at first I was scared was going to be very dry by the way it looked but it was the complete opposite. Very moist and bursting with flavor. I was super sad they forgot to add the piri piri medium and hot sauces in the bag, but it did have a little bit of sauce on the chicken which managed to go a long way. My octopus was grilled perfectly and was covered in chimichurri sauce. It came with two large tentacles which was enough to leave me with leftovers and still tasted great the next day and even cold!

Excellent recommendations and won the top 50 bbq in Texas. So we decided to wait. And wait we did. We got there around 1020, before opening on a Wednesday and there was already lines into the parking lot. We anticipated this and decided to stay. There were a bunch of people with chairs and beers tailgating the opening. I wish we would have. Around 1045 a lady came around asking what we anticipated on getting so they can judge just about when they would run out of certain meats. I thought this was efficient. The whole process is smoothly run and they set expectations on wait times. There are chairs and water that you can borrow from franklin. Our whole wait time was just short of three hours before we got to the counter. \\n\\nThe food- I got the tipsy Texan and she got a brisket sandwich. We split a pecan pie and the potato salad. The brisket, IMO, was super salty. It was just okay. The potato salad was mustardy, which I liked and she didn't. The pecan pie was absolutely the best thing I had and we both wished we got individual ones. \\n\\nOnce inside there's stuff for sale. I really liked the espresso bbq sauce, so I bought that blur I didn't know if I was going to like it before I bought it cause I wasn't sure if I could try it and then just go to a quick line to buy. It was only four dollars; so I grabbed one for me and one for a friend. I ended up enjoying it so it was a good gamble. \\n\\nWould I go back if I come back to Austin?

I had like 75% of my group there all standing in the middle of the lobby.  Once 80% arrived and we were seated, it took 25 minutes for our server to come take our drink order, THEN another 25 minutes to get the drinks.  So an hour has already passed and we just got our drinks, mind you we only have 2 hours to do everything.  I had pre-selected menu items as part of my package that should have been ready, but they were not and took forever to come out.  My whole group was starving! It was just one server for my group of 12 and he had like 5 other tables!  It's so loud in there you can't have a conversation without shouting at the top of your lungs and it's a wonder the staff gets orders accurately(or maybe they don't...).  It took soo long for him to bring out each dish and make his way around the table, that one end was finished eating before the other! Then, we used the same dirty plates for each dish.  We had chicken tenders, onion rings, chicken caesar salad, fettuccine alfredo and fries.  We had to shout for salt and pepper. When the fries came out he brought ketchup in a big bowl with NO SPOON!! We had to SHOUT to our server if we wanted to catch him.  Once we did, it took him forever to bring the spoon and everyone was done eating their fries.  Our server brought our ice cream dessert without plates so the ice cream is melting while we wait for plates and utensils because we were not going to eat dessert off of a plate with ketchup and caesar salad.  So now we have a table full of dirty dishes, trying to pass out melting ice cream on the hot plates that just came out of the washer.  Now it's soup.

Im apologizing profusely to parents because Im holding their child hostage beyond 5p, just so I can attempt to get my money's worth and the kids have the full experience.  I voiced my concerns to manager on duty and he was accommodating and apologetic.  He stated they were severely understaffed, which I understand happens but doesn't make me feel better.

There are some complaints about them having only one pho available, but this is actually more authentic.  In Vietnam, most shops only offer one pho.  \\n\\nThe presentation and ambience was spectacular.  There is a trend with places like Anh and Chi, Maenam, and other places to elevate southeast asian cuisine to modern expectations for decor and presentation.  Service was polite and friendly.  They're trying quite hard to please, although  there are some small hiccups while they figure out this business.\\n\\nI had the trio of mini banh mi as well.  Simply delicious.  Freshly baked bread in house with thin, crispy exterior shell, soft, fluffy dough inside.  House made cold cut meats and meatballs.  Generous portions of pickled carrots and radish with cilantro.  Crowd pleaser.  As others mentioned, the jambon is quite good.  The mini crepes look beautiful and unique, but they didn't have much flavor unless you take a big bite of the basil leaves with each crepe.  \\n\\nThey have daily specials.  We had the mini spring rolls (delicious!).  Like little rolled up crackers with baby shrimp inside.  Unfortunately, they ran out of the other daily special.

What sets this apart though is the open doors to Newbury St. As other reviewers have said, there is great people watching here, but it has the luxury of making you feel like you're outside when you're not actually outside.

I was super skeptical of the hype but it is absolutely worth the wait!\\n\\nFor out-of-towners like us (from Los Angeles) wanting to experience Franklin's for the first time, here was our game plan:\\n\\nWoke up at 6:30am got there at 7:02am and were already 6th in line. That means being perched on the concrete walkway right into their front door. The lady who was first said she was in line at 6:47am. There was just the two of us so one of us became the runner to go get food and coffee from Juan in a Million and coffee.\\n\\nAt around 7:40am, Chair Guy ATX showed up and set up shop. He sold about 10 chairs in 30 minutes and kept replenishing his stock. We bought two for $5/each and he accepts most major credit cards.\\n\\nFrom 8am-10am we basically sat on Chair Guy's chairs and brought an iPad to watch movies. At around 9:30am two gals from Franklin BBQ came by and asked us how much meat we planned to order. They just want an estimate of meat and if you tell them its your first time they'll gauge how much is a good amount of meat for your party to eat there and take some leftovers too. Don't bother making your order with them because they don't need to know until you actually get up to the register. \\n\\nAt this point the line stretched all the way down past their parking lot so I'd estimate anywhere from 50-75 people in line already. That is without counting people rushing into line at around 10:30am to find their buddies that did them a solid and waited in line for them.\\n\\nReturned our chairs at 10:45am and at 11am sharp the man opens the pearly gates and yells \\"alright, lets do this!\\" \\n\\nAs you get to the counter the designated meat cutter will cut you some samples of their famed brisket asking if you want more fatty or lean cuts. There was a hipster in front of us who had his fair share of samples then craned back to swipe another few bites while licking his fingers in satisfaction, fedora unfazed by his gesticulations. He was a veteran of this Franklin BBQ game so first timers be on your toes! Don't let the vets grab your free bites! \\n\\nEnded up being about $58 for 2lbs of fatty brisket, 1lb of ribs, a banana bourbon pie. \\n\\nThe fatty brisket is Texas gold, passes the pull test (doesn't fall of its own weight but the slightest tug will make it break), and it is absolutely melt in your mouth perfection. No sauce is needed at all but thats the sign of BBQ excellence. \\n\\nThe ribs are just as good. Fall of the bone delicious with a bit of tang. These were the best ribs and brisket I had in Austin. \\n\\nMost surprisingly, the banana bourbon pie was phenomenal. Moist and a noticeable but not overpowering bourbon taste. It's like a banana creme pie but the crust is crisp, sweet, and delicious. One of the top pies I've ever had!\\n\\nFor preparation for this most glorious experience I recommend watching Anthony Bourdain's Austin episode and watching Aaron Franklin's youtube channel \\"BBQwithFranklin\\" to appreciate the amount of time and attention he puts into making the best brisket/BBQ in Austin and maybe in all of Texas.\\n\\nBottom line: everyone please go here. They are the best when it comes to BBQ. I'm glad I experienced it once and I can't wait to come back for more!\\n\\nTips: sleep well the night before, bring reading material, bring a chair, bring an electronic device.

Even after I would say \\"thank you\\" she still refused to acknowledge me in any way.  I had the sinking uncomfortable feeling that this is because I am Asian and she doesn't like my kind.  She didn't come out and call me a \\"chink\\" but eating here brought back the same feelings I had from battling severe racial bullying while growing up in this part of the country.  \\n\\nI got a cheeseburger.

Our foods were just average, and not worth the prices. The boys got the chicken, which also came with waffles, which wasn't listed on the menu. I got a pasta dish and Alice got a pizza. While all of our meals were delicious, it just wasn't as savory, or intimate a setting as we had remembered. Also, the music was a loud, tecnho/dubstep.. and while our reservations were for 8:30, it felt like we were in a night club. We were so surprised or taken back by this that we asked the waitress about the music, and she seemed to think it was normal for their restaurant. \\n\\nWe have always had good food, and good times while at Sonsie, it just lost some of its charm, intimacy, and classy feeling about the ambiance.

Their location is perfect and they have a fun selection of hard drinks and desserts. \\n\\nMy first hard hitting clue came when the hostess informed me that if we wanted to be seated outside we would have to wait 30 to 45 minutes for a table to be cleaned off....she added that if we wanted immediate seating we could dine inside of the restaurant. It was a beautiful evening so my husband told her that we will wait for an outside table. Soon afterwards one of the three employees that the hostess was engaged in a gossipy conversation with went to clean off a table. We were seated within five minutes. \\n\\nKarington was our server and she was outstanding. Her sunny disposition and professionalism was a drastic contrast from the hostess. \\n\\nWe ordered coffee with a Mudslide Ice Cream Sandwich ($10.00) and a Giggles Snickers Milkshake. ($15.00) The coffee was cold, thick and very old tasting. Karington admitted that it was old and was kind enough to brew a fresh pot. \\n\\nThe Ice Cream Sandwich had a pleasing presentation. We enjoyed the center of coffee ice cream but the cookies were hard as stone and this made them unpleasant. \\n\\nThe milkshake was all around disgusting. It was served with a limp Waffle on the top and stale sprinkles glued down with something that is brown like chocolate but taste like an old refrigerator smells. The menu photo showcased snicker bar slices that appeared to be placed on hot chocolate so that when the chocolate cools the candy bar pieces and a small amount of sprinkles will stay put. If you look at the picture of what came out of the kitchen you will see what looks like hand mashed balls of Snickers randomly pressed up against a tough crust of sprinkles. You could actually see finger indentations on the balls of snickers. This made them appear unclean and something a two year old will hand you when they are done eating.

La Cava del Tequila is located inside the pyramid in the Mexico pavilion.  On a typical day, you'll find a large line going out the door for their quick orders at the bar, but you'll find that if you put your name on the list for a table inside the Cave, the wait is usually not that bad.  Here, you can find an assortment of hand-crafted margaritas instead of ordering a pre-mixed marg outside.  Some of my favorites are the Blood Orange Margarita, the Passion Fruit Margarita, and surprisingly the Avocado Margarita (a little on the sweet side but still delicious and doesn't taste like avocados at all). Keep in mind these margaritas are on the pricey side, ranging between $13-15 each, but they're so tasty! \\n\\nThey also have a nice little surprise that comes with any shot of tequila ordered....you get your tequila, salt, and lime of course, but they also serve a little shot of \\"Sangrita\\" which is a bloody-mary like shot which serves as a chaser for your tequila and is a refreshing change up to the traditional tequila shot.  \\n\\nAlthough they don't really serve food in the Cave, they do offer chips with salsa, queso, and guacamole.

Honestly, I didn't enjoy my meal. I ordered the Italian with pressed bread and even now, I'm not sure if the server brought out the right sandwich. What I ate was unlike any Italian I've ever had. It was far too mayonnaise-y, even though I asked for very light mayo. The taste wasn't bad, but for such high ratings and the \\"Best Brunch Spots\\" designation, I expected far more. Bit of a letdown.\\n\\nMOOD: 3 stars. This is a pretty hipster joint, which is fine if it's part of the package. It looks like a large house was turned into a makeshift restaurant. Again, all good, no qualms with that whatsoever. But what I didn't like was the minuscule amount of parking. If a home is turned into a restaurant, the owner must allot some space for adequate parking. There's a sign that says \\"additional parking at the lake\\" but it wasn't sufficient, as I couldn't find the lake at first glance so I circled the restaurant several times until someone left. That was a little frustrating.\\n\\nSTAFF: 4 stars. The cashier/server seemed pretty nice. I'd describe my experience as \\"neutral,\\" which is better than \\"bad\\" I suppose.\\n\\nVERDICT: 3 stars. I'd definitely eat here again, but only to see what all the fuss is about.

We went in at 4:30pm on a weekday - we were the ONLY people in the joint and I thought great, lots of attention for us!  Our waitress, Erica greeted us quickly and took our drink order, she offered us a free appetizer since it was our first time in and I thought SCORE, nice treat because even though I never mentioned it to her, it was my birthday and this was the place I picked to go to celebrate.   She dropped off our drinks about 5 minutes later immediately saying \\"I'll be back\\" before I could tell her our choices and disappeared... I sat there starving for at least 15 minutes before she even came back to get our order.  By this time another couple had come in and somehow already received an appetizer while we still sat ignored in an empty restaurant.   Finally she took our order, no complimentary appetizer was brought, not even mentioned again actually.  We then sat another 20+ minutes starving without out so much as a drink refill.  Ignored by waitress and various staff lounging around the dining room chatting with each other and what seemed to be waiting around for the dinner shift to begin, I guess no one was in the back to make our rolls?   Our rolls finally came Almost FORTY FIVE (45) minutes after we arrived to an EMPTY place.   The waitress dropped them off and left.  So yah, guess her whole 1 table with a so called welcome in appetizer was too much to remember for her to take care of.   I'd been eyeballing several other rolls on the menu at first and had also picked out the 'banana split' dessert to finish off my birthday meal - but by the time we got our measly two items, which sadly were mediocre at best and did not seem fresh, I just wanted to leave.  After another long wait to get her attention and bring our check (she was chatting with a new table of guys that came in about how she's from Pennsylvania and blah blah blah), I found we'd been over charged for the one and only cocktail I'd ordered at the beginning for full price rather than the happy hour rate.   sigh, I give up.   I won't be back - and I'd already told a bunch of friends to go here based on my great experience in California.  I'm definitely going to rescind that recommendation to them all stat.

Oh Yelp, it's so rare you fail me but when you do, it really hurts. \\n\\nThe ambiance of South City is nice; dim and romantic but trendy enough that you can come for drinks with a friend or a group to have dinner. \\n\\nWe decided to get three appetizers and the fried chicken entree to share. First up was the smoked trout on crostini; this was delicious. I really liked the sweet caramelized onions on top, it went well with the saltiness of the trout. I wouldn't get it again though as it is on crostini (a very good crostini), but you get these awesome corn bread with butter after you order so that's enough carbs for me. If you don't have a carb limitation though, I recommend the dish.  Next we got the rabbit pot pie. Really nice crust, though unbreakable with a fork. We took it off and cut it with a knife. Huge chunks of rabbit, so much so that I was almost wishing for more veggies. However, it had really good flavor and was a good comfort dish (especially cuz the restaurant was so cold!) Last, we had the baked oysters. Eh... Skip. \\n\\nThen the fried chicken. It was juicy and crunchy. And the sides of collard greens and mashed potatoes was good. Not sure what it is about it that made it underwhelming. Maybe it was our expectation of southern fried chicken. The dish itself was good and well presented... It just tasted like something we can get back home in New York. Actually, all of the dishes that we had was good, but all tasted like something we can order in New York.

The restaurant is small and always seems crammed with people.  Seating is first-come, first-served.  Each of the times I've eaten here, there's always been a line out the door.  Ordering is done off a simple, large print wall menu.  They have ribs in different sizes as well as chicken (1/4 or 1/2 a \\"bird\\" as they call it) and a variety of sides including their signature \\"rum\\" baked beans, cole slaw, potato salad, Brunswick stew, etc.  Sides are ordered a la carte.  You can also get a \\"rib sandwich,\\" which is basically a 1/4 slab of ribs in between two slices of white bread.\\n\\nI think the ribs at Fat Matt's are pretty good.  They are very close to \\"fall off the bone\\" good, although some rib purists think ribs that fall off the bone are *not* cooked properly.  Who knows?  All I know is they taste good.  The meat is very tender, flavorful, and I don't ever need to put any sauce on them.  It could stand to be a little less fatty and greasy.  The sides are decent overall.  Try the rum baked beans if you haven't had them before for a different flavor.  Those beans have more of a kick to them.  The collards are okay as well.\\n\\nDespite Fat Matt's small interior, they do have a stage where bands set up and play live music.  You can dine-in or take-out.  Take-out is a very popular option.

A terrible rating on yelp, crowded with people, touristy location, on the waterfront- it just seemed like another overpriced tourist trap.

We weren't quite finished with our food but the waitress kept coming over to hurry us out. She came by as soon as someone finishes their plate or pauses from eating.  It was as if she was keeping watch over our plates. My 7 year old was the last to finish but she was taking her time. Her plate was still half full but she stopped eating for a couple of minutes.

The restaurant's Midtown location has been around for about 20 years now. There's another location in Vinings and their newest location opened in Buckhead in 2016. This is an ideal place to bring a date or out-of-town guests for a meal. The restaurant serves traditional Southern comfort food in a more modern and elegant setting.\\n\\nSouth City Kitchen Midtown is located along Crescent Ave, a strip known for its bars, nightclubs, lounges, and restaurants. Unfortunately, there is no valet and virtually no free parking for the restaurant. Metered street parking, free on Sunday, is very limited. Your best bets for parking are in surface lots in front of and behind the restaurant. Rates vary for these automated pay-in-advance lots, but expect to spend about $8 to park.\\n\\nLike its next-door neighbor Flip Flops, South City Kitchen is nestled inside an old two-story home. It's clean, cozy, and minimally decorated with an open kitchen and white tablecloths. If you sit at the counter, you face directly into the kitchen which is pretty neat. There's an enclosed patio and all sorts of nooks and crannies where you can be seated. They've tried to pack as many tables in here as comfortably possible. This is one of those restaurants where you could be sitting within earshot's distance of an adjacent table. When this place gets packed, which it often is, it's loud.\\n\\nSouth City Kitchen serves lunch, dinner, and weekend brunch. I've been for their weekend brunch which is served Saturday and Sunday from 10am to 3pm. One great thing about South City Kitchen is you can make brunch reservations. A lot of the popular brunch places in Atlanta don't offer this and you end up having to put your name on a wait list. South City Kitchen is on OpenTable, so book your reservation through that service and earn free dining points.\\n\\nThe menus feature items like Smoked Pork Belly, Chicken Livers, She-Crab Soup, Buttermilk Fried Chicken, Georgia Trout, Tennessee Catfish, Jumbo Lump Crab Cake, Smoked Pork Chop, various sandwiches (e.g. BBQ Pulled Pork, Pimento Cheese), and Farmstead Vegetables (e.g. kale, green beans, fingerling potatoes). Desserts include items such as Pineapple Upside Down Cake, Banana Pudding, Pecan Pie, and Apple Cobbler. At dinner, most appetizers, soup, and salads run roughly $10-15 each, entrees $20-35 each, and sides $6-12. At lunch and brunch, most plates are in the $10-20 range with sides about $5. Desserts run just under $10 per.\\n\\nThey do a nice job with the presentation here. Their Fried Green Tomatoes almost look like a work of art. They're certainly among the fanciest fried green tomatoes I've had. Three slices come to an order and are cooked with goat cheese. The base is a pepper coulis, which is a somewhat thick and flavorful sauce. The tomatoes are ripe and have an appetizing crispy coating topped with shredded basil. This is a surprisingly filling app.\\n\\nI find South City Kitchen's Pimento Cheese to be unique and different because of its exceptionally coarse and chunky texture. An order of just the pimento cheese by itself comes with housemade pickle slices, benne seed corn crackers (benne seed is the same thing as sesame seed), and raw celery sticks. The pickles are delicious and I like the subtly flavored, delicate crackers. This pimento cheese seems a bit thicker, richer, and creamier than most other pimento cheeses I've tried. Not bad.\\n\\nIf you like Eggs Benedict, give the Smoked Brisket Benedict a try. Smoked beef brisket is used in lieu of the typical ham or bacon. The chunks of meat sit on split, buttered, and toasted English muffins with poached eggs and a Creole mustard hollandaise with pickled jalapeno slices on top. The smooth, buttery, and mildly tangy hollandaise sauce is what makes this dish for me.\\n\\nBy default, the Eggs Benedict comes with Red Mule grits. Red Mule grits can be ordered separately as a side during brunch and also comes in other dishes like the Shrimp & Grits. Red Mule grits are from Mills Farm in Athens, Georgia and are made from organic corn. The grits have a finer whipped-like consistency to them.\\n\\nThe Chicken & Waffle is tasty. Like numerous other Atlanta restaurants, South City Kitchen gets their chicken from Springer Mountain Farms in northeast Georgia. The chicken is buttermilk fried, served bone-in, good quality, and scrumptious. I like that it's not too greasy. The waffle is quartered, thick, soft, crunchy, and delightful with the accompanying maple syrup. I think this is one of the better chicken and waffles in the city.\\n\\nService is fantastic from the hosts/hostesses to the servers to the food runners. They are all uniformed, attentive, and polite. Orders come out in a reasonable amount of time even during peak periods.

I was still hungry (even though an hour previous to the call to go to soul fire I had devoured an entire bag of Trader Joe's Pasta Italiano), but that's neither here nor there.  Anywhoo, I put my sneaks on, grabbed my keys and wallet and headed into my chariot (my 01 Kia).  I had no problem finding a parking space in the bustling metropolis of harvard ave. I got a lone star beer, some collards (very good) and some red bliss mashed potatoes (not bad considering using red bliss to make mashed potatoes is a slight abomination and sacrelig to my Irish heritage).  The waitrees/bartender/busgirl/counterperson was cheerful.  The place was dead.  The grub was hot, the dining companions happy to be eating BBQ.  I'll be back.  And, I didn't smell leaving the joint either.  That's a bonus for once!!  Oh and the domestic beers are cheap, the imported beers are a bit more (5 bux).  I would never get wine at a BBQ place but they have a bottle of sauvignon blanc for 20 bux, 6 for a glass and some cab sav and probably merlot, but I wasn't going to drink wine.  I like me a beer with the BBQ.  Check this place out.  They had great music on too!!"},{"name":"Blue Dahlia Bistro","address":"3663 Bee Caves Rd, Ste 4A","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"This place has a very limited menu at lunch.

They don't even do a special-sauce... and granted... there ARE better, more 'gourmet' burgers out there, to be scarfed; some bleeding rare, some adorned in blue-cheese crumbles, and resting monolithically on a bed of arugula.... but how much are you willing to pay for a slice of your twentieth-century childhood? \\n\\nThis is a question that has legitimatized my return here, again and again... as the premium on that old, nostalgic, 1950's-1992 aesthetic, still beckons those who remember. Yes they grill their buns. Yes they use deli-slices of American-cheese. Yes they stack it all with consideration. Yes they include pickles (even tho I generally hate them). Beyond the burger, they have totally decent hand-cut french-fries... fried in peanut-oil... fresh as harvest-day! Definitely up there in the ULTIMATE french-fry-fast-food Lexicon. Are there better classic-themed burgers out there? Sure there are. But you'll have to find them, and that my friends... is not always easy."},{"name":"Sonic Drive-In","address":"630 Washngton St","city":"Stoughton","stars":"2","text":"This location has some of the worst service ever.

Screen Door is no exception. Is it worth a visit? Maybe, with conditions. Like most of Portland's tourist-frequented spots, it's pretty good, but not worth the wait. \\n\\nHere's the lowdown:  \\n- Service, adequate. The coffee refills were plentiful. Despite there being at least a dozen service staff milling around, our server was MIA (the coffee refill person took our food order) and if we'd had questions I'm not sure who would have been there to answer them. This was on a not-so-busy Wednesday morning.\\n- Decor, boring. Nothing bad, nothing special. The walls have paint and the tables come with chairs. Everything you need, but a forgettable interior.\\n- Food, good, but needs improvement. Granted, I'm basing this on one trip, but given the food and overall experience I have no plans to return. I can say I've been and it was fine, but nothing all that interesting or noteworthy. The food is good, but there's nothing here that justifies waiting more than a few minutes for a table. I had the chicken and waffles, which comes in one, two, or three piece sizes. Not knowing the chicken portions are enormous, I ordered the two piece. The sweet potato waffle was good and the first few bites of chicken were, too. However, the fried chicken batter is *loaded* with black pepper and after about three bites, black pepper is the only discernible flavor. Disappointing. The chicken was moist, but not juicy. It wasn't terrible, but this chicken doesn't deserve all the praise it has received. \\n\\nIn short, if there's no line it's a fine place to eat, but tempered expectations are necessary. If I lived nearby I might swing by on mid-week mornings for breakfast, but it's not worth a special trip. If you're looking for good (and appropriately-peppered) fried chicken, check out the place at SE 80th/Stark."},{"name":"Blue Dahlia Bistro","address":"3663 Bee Caves Rd, Ste 4A","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Great place for Sunday brunch.

The menu looked a little finicky, the choice and variety of proteins (the kind of plates I usually gravitate towards for my mains) was kind of abysmal, and I'm skeptical of the wave of New American tapas-style eateries, which often enough are a bit of a ploy to spread less food, preciously prepared (oftentimes more focused on artistry than flavor), over fewer plates to the tune of many more dollars.\\n\\nAlden & Harlow totally changed my world with the dinner I had there. The standouts were the vegetable dishes, and the format of a succession of smaller plates (which, by the way, I absolutely love in Spanish and Korean/S.E. Asian contexts) proved essential in creating a perfect kind of theater of flavor, which was completely devoid of the kind of boredom typically induced around the fifteenth consecutive bite from the same plate of food.\\n\\nThe charred broccoli with squash hummus was miraculous, the kale salad with pistachio dressing has me trying to replicate it (the dressing) with my Vitamix, to various success, and the corn cakes with shishito was like a joke perfectly pulled off. An unforgettable meal and all the more so because it played so exquisitely against my habits and taste.\\n\\nThe only downside was a slightly underwhelming soft shell crab dish, and a couple of fairly ordinary tasting desserts (had I know they'd be mediocre, I would have gladly eaten the charred broccoli dish a second time). Also, though the mezcal cocktail was superb, the drinks all suffered a little in the same way. So, a little advice to the staff, although I doubt they pay mind to yelp (see-the executive chef's yelp 'scandal'): when you shake your cocktails, use larger pieces of ice, that way you'll stave off dilution while still aerating them properly, yielding a more composed-tasting cocktail."},{"name":"Franklin Barbecue","address":"900 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I want to start by saying two things: 1.

We arrived just before 5:00am and the people ahead of us said they got their about 4 minutes before we did so it seems like 4:45-4:50 might be the magic time to get there if you want to be first in line. Now, on to the food... every single thing I ate was the best I'd had of it's kind to this point. I am not usually a fan of just straight slabs of brisket because they tend to be kind of dry, but not here at Franklin. My brother and I shared a pound of the fatty brisket and let me tell you it was super juicy, smoky, and full of all the right flavors. The pork ribs were incredible!!! Cooked and seasoned to perfection. And finally, the Tipsy Texan Sandwich is probably the best bang for your buck. It's only $8 and I'm pretty sure they put close to a 1/2 pound of brisket on there, half a sausage link, slaw, pickles, and onions. The espresso bbq sauce they put on the chopped brisket is killer as well. Everything about Franklin Barbeque was beyond the hype!!

We arrived a little past 11AM on Sunday aka prime brunch time so guess we were kind of asking for it, but our wait ended up being close to two hours. Was almost tempted to go elsewhere but was too curious about the hype surrounding this place.\\n\\nThe menu has a lot of Southern-influence and most of the dishes are super comforting but heavy but incredibly delicious. Started with the Bloody Mary's which I thought were just okay but bf really enjoyed. They are super strong FYI. Chicken and Waffles is a MUST. The chicken is extremely well seasoned and so tender and the waffles are made from a sweet potato batter that is slightly nutty and sweet and SO GOOD, especially drenched in the maple sauce. The special Vegetable Hash that was on the menu that day was really good as well. It comprised of crispy potatoes, squash, grilled onions (and some other ingredients I'm forgetting?) and some kind of pecan puree that was like a nuttier pesto and an amazing accompaniment to the veggies. It came with two eggs any style so of course chose poached. The eggs were not poached perfectly. Bf also really enjoyed his short rib has that came with eggs and tortillas--basically made his own little breakfast tacos with them. \\n\\nEverything was delicious and super comforting, maybe too comforting because we all felt way too over-stuffed and like we needed to nap afterwards.

Definitely come here for brunch. After a night out on Dirty Sixth and sleeping in for a good amount of time, our group needed some brunch to bring life back into us -- and there is no better place that I've been to in Austin recently that can do that. \\n\\nOf course, we started with drinks (I mean there's no other way to start a Sunday right? Also, I live in California where cocktails are significantly more than eight dollars. IT WAS FIVE DOLLARS FOR A MIMOSA! I couldn't hold myself back.) I actually started off with the sangria and the others ordered the bloody mary. The sangria was good -- a little weak on the alcohol but I thoroughly enjoyed it. The bloody mary was probably the better choice in regards to drinks. It was spicy and had the right balance of tomato juice... and the best part was the bacon, pepper, and olive garnish. Mimosas were great as well. \\n\\nNow for the food. Below is the order of preference of dishes we ordered:\\n\\n1. Beef Tongue Banh Mi -- usually I stray away from banh mi because I know what the authentic ones taste like and why would I settle for anything less? Well.. it's not settling if you go for the beef tongue. It's served with an au jus, kimchi aioli (my personal favorite), and curry ketchup. The tongue was cooked so well, the bread retained a crunchy and chewy texture without getting too soggy, and the balance of the veggies and jalapenos versus beef tongue were perfect. Also, the fries in this dish. Some of the best damn fries that I have ever had (dipping them in the aioli was just the cherry on top of their greatness).  If you come here, get an order of fries.. just do it.\\n\\n2. Green Eggs & Ham -- Fantastic. The slab of ham was thick, the bread held together, and the egg was cooked perfectly.\\n\\n3. Pork Belly Confit Tacos -- Standard taco but extremely delicious. \\n\\n4. Shrimp & Grits (with the sixty-eight degree egg) -- I was in the South, so I figured getting something along the grits line was a necessity. It was pretty standard. I wasn't impressed with any of the flavors. The shrimp was cooked to a good texture which brought my overall rating of the dish up.\\n\\n5. Biscuits and Seven-Pepper Gravy -- I have to admit, I was extremely disappointed. When it comes to dishes like this, I look for a level of comfort that wasn't there for me. The biscuits were pretty small which probably contributed to my disappointment. There was no Southern Soul in it. I've had biscuits and gravy like this at home.\\n\\nThe staff was extremely attentive and the vibe of the place is awesome. As soon as sat down, we all noticed that the playlist of the place was awesome. Straight out of ACL or Outside Lands. Even better, mid-way through our meal, the band had set up and had started playing. Great vibes all around, cool metal (haha metal at Mettle) sculptures, and great food/drinks.

Single. Thing. Was AMAZING! The wings literally fell off the bone and were perfectly fried! The avocado was my absolute favorite! We added crab to it but I don't think you even need to do that for it to be amazing. The flavors were outstanding and perfect for a hot day sitting outside! \\n\\nThe burger was excellent and they even cut it and put it on two different plates for us when we said we were sharing it! The corn salad was the perfect side dish to tie it all together.\\n\\nThe drinks were also incredible! When I mentioned I had never had a negroni before, our waiter (whose name I can't remember but he was tall, blonde and hilarious) suggested the beginners negroni which was perfect!

The hush puppies were fried to perfection and the combination of the bacon and syrup is to die for. The sticky buns were sweet and was delicious. If I had to choose just one appetizer, I would go for the hush puppies. \\n\\nFor entree, I stuck with the chicken and waffles. When I waited, I saw the stack of chicken on one waffle.

The store itself was very cute and charming, but once we reached the register, there was a lack of warmth altogether. The girl at register at least was kind enough to answer my questions like \\"if it's my first time in here, what do you suggest I get\\" by explaining what coffee they used and what milk alternatives there are. But that's about as good as it gets. My partner and I both ordered bagel sandwiches, I ordered a latte and they ordered a drip. They got the size wrong for my partner's drink but we brushed it off. We had to ask again for a \\"for here\\" cup, but again, not a big deal for us. My partner mentioned \\"I feel like we are bugging them\\" but I told him to not worry, it's their job (and as a barista myself, I know there are worst things to be asked for). It was when we received the first bagel and found a hair stuck to the melted cheese that officially marked this experience as a negative one. My partner was too uncomfortable to go back up as they had already asked for a mug and a milk alternative for their coffee so I went up and showed them the bagel with a hair. No apology. No eye contact. The second employee almost seemed angry that I came back over in the first place. I don't normally post reviews, or get butthurt about my experiences, but the people really turned an exciting new experience into a bad one. Coffee was not that great (although I've had worse), bagels were bland and boring when they don't have hair in them. There was no welcoming or warm energy whatsoever which is baffling, because it seems that's the type of energy the store wants to project. Manager needs to figure out what kind of people they want running the show. Had one of those baristas ended up being the manager, they really need to get it through their head that people go to coffee shops not JUST for coffee half of the time, but for the experience and the connection. As a fellow barista, I am embarrassed for them. As a customer, I think it's one and done for me. I understand opening a new store is rough, but I hope they work out what they need to work out.

You absolutely must try the twinkies, yakatori, and the bar nuts. If you want the best food of your life seriously go to this place. The only thing to note is this food is very esoteric. The menu is very small and so are the portions. Definitely check out the menu before going because its taste is limited to a very select group of people. \\nDrinks were fantastic and married well, but very strong. You will not be getting a girly cocktail here. \\n\\nSERVICE:\\nA+. My waitress was friendly and prompt and was extremely knowledgable about the menu and restaurant. No complaints whatsoever. \\n\\nAMBIANCE:\\nThe \\"restaurant\\" is more of a lounge. There really is very little comfortable eating room and the darkness and decor definitely scream lounge. I think there might have only been about 5 realistic dining tables in the whole place. The decor is very cool though and so is the vibe, but I probably would not come back for a full dinner.\\n\\nPRICE:\\nThe price of both drinks and food is extremely high, and the portions are very very VERY small. Because of this, I would consider coming for drinks and a bite of food. I understand the crowd they are trying to attract, but $200 for dinner and two drinks is a little out of my price range."},{"name":"Stelios Restaurant","address":"293 Boston Rd","city":"Billerica","stars":"2.5","text":"Thought I would give this place another try, since, I hadn't been there in many months...

Bit the bullet and ordered one of the daily specials, American Chop Suey and greek lemon rice soup. Well, let me tell ya, the soup was basically watered down and had very little rice, and yes, the taste of bottled lemon juice, not real lemon..

Another friend got a 7 platter with eggs, sausage, grits, and a biscuit.\\n\\nThe first thing we all noticed is the food was room temperature. I'm not too much of a stickler about food temperature, but as we started to eat, the grits quickly became very cold and started to congeal. The grits were cooked very well and had a nice texture barring the temperature issue.\\n\\nThe sausage gravy didn't standout from the grits, I couldn't actually taste it very much, so there's not much to say there. The grits were a bit bland, but I like the cheddar chive flavor combination. I didn't like their handling of the biscuit - it was like someone properly baked a biscuit, removed the insides and crumbled them, folded in butter, reshaped the insides, and replaced the crunchy top and bottom. It was very heavy and gave me a gummy mouth feel.\\n\\nThe oven baked egg had a mostly hard-boiled yolk texture, and I don't think the dried out yolk meshed with the other ingredients. The ham baked around the egg had no distinct flavor. I did really enjoy the flavor of the pimiento cheese, they didn't slack on the pimientos.\\n\\nIn terms of the 3 little pigs dish overall, I feel like it's a platter of a bunch of flavors that don't really fit together. It reminded me of something a drunk friend would serve you at 1am.\\n\\nWe also got chipotle cheddar scones and a strawberry passion fruit muffin to bring home. I was hoping the bakery would fill in where the kitchen fell short, but I was unimpressed with the scone. Again, it was an issue of blandness. My friend who is a sucker for sweets threw half of her muffin away.\\n\\nOn the plus side... My friend thought the bacon in her 3 little pigs was some of the best bacon she'd ever had. My friend who got the 7 platter really enjoyed the house made sausage. Also, they give you a TON of food, you could easily split a dish between two people. \\n\\nThe staff was also very kind and attentive. They have a group handling the floor that swing by and ask how you're doing when they're passing. I also like the inside of the building, and the large community tables.\\n\\nI will be back eventually because I live super close and I want to give this place another chance, but it's going to be a while, as I found everything I tried here very lackluster."},{"name":"Great Wall Chinese Restaurant","address":"2538 Bouldercrest Rd SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Great service, good food and a nice amount!

The servers were so nice and went out of their way to help everyone.  There isn't much bad to say - it's a little small on the inside, that's about it.  Because the food was half off last night, I sampled a little of everything. The pimiento cheese with lavosh appetizer was really good but didn't come with much lavosh (lavosh is in between flatbread and a cracker).  The calamari was really good but nothing special, although the dipping sauce was great.  We also tried the bacon wrapped shrimp appetizer and it was great.  Servings were small on the shrimp (4, I think) but plenty of calamari. \\n\\nFor dinner I had the Gerber roast chicken. It was very juicy and absolutely perfect. I wouldn't have changed a thing about it.  It came with a sample of the mac and cheese (AMAZING!) and crisp green beans.  I wouldn't change a thing about my dinner.\\n\\nFor dessert I split the banana pudding and chocolate cake with my sister.  Chocolate cake was really really good...the chocolate ganache/filling was very buttery and delicious. It came with a small jug of milk that absolutely washed it down.  I took half of it home but ended up finishing it before bed.  The banana pudding is, I'm sure, going to be one of the most popular desserts. I wasn't a big fan of the presentation...it's served in a mason jar with a flambayed banana spear sticking out and Nilla wafers on top.  It was somewhat hard to get to and I wanted to dig in! Taste was great but I only managed a few bites before my sister took it away from me so she could have it. \\n\\nThey also have a good but small local beer selection.  I tried a Summer Splash, which was purported to be watershed gin with cucumber. It was way too sweet to me so I gave it away.  If you like sweet drinks, you'll like this. My sister had the Greensleeves and it wasn't quite as sweet but still pretty sweet. \\n\\nAfter dinner we moved to the outdoor bar where we sipped red wine and watched the absolutely amazing lights, music and water show.

Others around us did the same, with one group even bringing a portable tv. At 11:01AM, the doors opened, and we were quickly one of the first customers to order and sit down. My friend ad I ordered all the meats including their sausage without any sides (we wanted to save enough room to fit in all the meat we could). We ordered 1/4 lb. of each: turkey, brisket, pulled pork and ribs. We also split a sausage link. The brisket was by far the best thing on the menu, although the ribs and pork were only slightly less orgasmic.\\n\\nThe BBQ they serve here is no-frills, straight up BBQ. No special rubs, no special sauces. That's what I love about this place. I tried Salt Lick BBQ about 2 years ago, and I know there are a lot of people who like Franklin BBQ over Salt Lick. However, I feel like Salt Lick uses their own special rub, so their BBQ is flavored differently. The BBQ was darn good too, I remember.

You can go a la carte or stick to an entree combo. I usually order the chicken schwarma with hummus, pita, and dolmas. The hummus, unlike some hummus, is not bland or lackluster but boasts a robust savory flavor. Plus, the hummus and pita servings are abundant.\\n\\nThe restaurant and menu are nothing over the top and really focus on the basics, which can definitely be appreciated for the price and pace of the service and food.

It encompasses absolutely everything you'd want in a barbecue joint. A dedicated pit master, a storied and much talked about fabled history, and a lovely following by word of mouth for the legions of bbq-holics that exist in the fine state of Texas. \\n\\nSeriously, bring your A game. My friends and I put on our thinking caps and made our trip to Franklin's happen pretty much at the last minute. I'd heard of this place for years and had been wanting to go but it just never happened. Here's what you do. The early bird needs to come at 7 AM in order to get in the line. That person is then relieved by another party member a few hours later and so forth until 11 rolls around. My friend and her husband were visiting so we made an affair of it using their camping chairs from their camping trip and equipped ourselves with coffee, bug spray, and donuts. We settled in for the long haul.\\n\\nIt's a wonderful social experience, being there and meeting all the others waiting in line. I enjoyed it. It wasn't a waste of my Sunday morning. They do a preliminary counts to get an idea of when they're due to run out so they can warn people. They have cold beverages with people walking around for tips prior to opening. They do their best to accommodate on a wonderful product. Can't deny the thoughtfulness there. \\n\\nNow...the bbq. Is. Amazing. Hands down, best I've ever had. Seriously, it's like cocaine and I'm itching for another hit, it's THAT good. When you finally do mosey your way up to the counter, the legend him self, Franklin, is cutting up that barbecue for you. He gives you the most deliciously flavored, perfectly cooked, COMPLETELY EARNED piece of brisket and you're convinced you've met the love of your life. You have no idea how you existed before the day you walked into his door. With your boyfriend by your side (who admittedly is my own personal version of awesome). He never rushed us and there's something to be said in his approach. He's quiet, unassuming, and very disarming in the way he talks to you. Sometimes the best food is made by the humblest people and there's something to admire about that. It's a rarity these days. \\n\\nBeing gluttonous and preparing for the Franklin apocalypse, I ordered 3 lbs each of the brisket, ribs, and pulled pork. I got a 1/2 lb of sausage, a bourbon banana pie (amazing), drinks, and sides and it totaled...150.00 bucks. For 2 people. Yes, I have rationed the remains in my freezer. I have even gifted some to people. No, they are not for sale. \\n\\nWe ate for about 15 minutes after the eventual meat sweats kicked in. I lasted about 10. Its great, delicious, and rich. But only 6 tables indoor mean you need to hurry and get out for other people to enjoy their prosperous bounty too. Food guilt can be an unfortunate side effect of eating the best bbq on Earth. It's only fair we share the space so they can experience their own personal version of meat heaven too. \\n\\nHighly recommend! Come with a plan. You can order to-go in advance for items that total will equal more than 5 lbs. Highly recommend but they do sell-out a month in advance. Check their calendar. This way you will not have to wait in line! \\n\\n Plan smart and the rewards will be bountiful!"},{"name":"Fuji At WoC","address":"1420 Hancock St","city":"Quincy","stars":"4.5","text":"Wonderful experience, we sat at the sushi bar and greeted by the owner.

With the salad, although I found the ingredients quite healthy, it just lacked quality. It would not be an item I would order again..\\n\\nOur mains consisted of the steak frites and tilapia. The steak portion was smaller than I anticipated. I was not pleased that the steak along with the sauce was laid on top of the fries. It made them pretty soggy! Also, the sauce did not compliment the dish very well. I just found it salty and not enjoyable. The tilapia was prepared with a crab sauce which had did not include substitutions. (FYI for all those seafood intolerants out there!) Even if you ask, they will not allow you to request sauce on the side, which apparently is the main component of the dish.\\n\\nEven though I was less impressed with my dinner, I still wanted to give the desert option a chance.

But, after reading the reviews, and seeing the long wait that we were in for, we went to South City Kitchen instead.  South City Kitchen is a nice modern restaurant in Midtown Atlanta.  Reservations were made for 8PM, but, we showed up early hoping to get a table early.  The restaurant was crowded when we arrived at 7PM.  We almost had to wait the extra hour, until they offered us a table in the patio.  My wife normally hates sitting outside because of her phobia to flies and other insects, but, she was hungry and decided that we needed to take the outside table.  \\n\\nOur server was a really friendly guy.  He described the specials of the day to us.  He was very enthusiastic about the restaurants specialties, and the specials of the day.  We ended up ordering an appetizer of their smoked pork belly.  My wife got the fried chicken.  I ordered the Shrimp with Grits.  My daughter ordered the child's fish and chips.  While we were waiting, he brought out some biscuits and cornbread.  The biscuits and cornbread were very good.  \\n\\nMinutes later, the Smoked Pork Belly appetizer came out.  The smoke pork belly is a chunk of pork belly with perfectly crispy skin with some collard green kimchi.  The pork belly was perfectly cooked.  The skin was nice and crispy.  The meat had a great flavor to it.  The collard green kimchi was surprisingly good.  It has a nice kimchi flavor to it.  I liked collard green kimchi more than the regularly prepared collard greens.  Minutes after finishing the appetizer, the main dishes came out.  \\n\\nThe fried chicken that my wife ordered came with a couple of pieces of fried chicken on a bed of mash potatoes and collard greens.  The chicken was very good.  It was nicely seasoned and moist.  My wife must've liked the mashed potatoes as she finished the whole thing.  \\n\\nThe shrimp and grits were a perfect combination.  The savory shrimp and the shrimp gravy made this a great dish.  It was quite unfortunate that I waited until the last day of our vacation to try this southern specialty.  \\n\\nThe child liked her fish and chips.  They used catfish filets for their fish.  My daughter says it is good, so it must be good.  \\n\\nDessert was my daughter's Vanilla Ice Cream.  The ice cream was great after dinner.  It was the final touch to a great meal.  \\n\\nSouth City Kitchen is a very nice place.  Plan B worked out just fine.  They have great food.  The service is good too.

Avoid at all costs. \\n\\nI went here with my boyfriend on a Saturday morning. There was a line out of the door, but it moved fairly quickly. There were two female employees working, and when it was our turn, my boyfriend ordered a sesame bagel with sliced nova lox, with no lettuce. I didn't order anything as I already ate. Also, I want to note that the woman never asked if I wanted anything. Five minutes after the woman took the original order, she asked us to repeat the cream cheese and toppings again. Weird that she'd forget so quickly.. but ok. \\n\\nThis next part is when things go horribly wrong. The counter was above my eye level, but the toaster was propped slightly higher, and I saw both employees grab the toasted bagels WITH THEIR BARE HANDS. Not ok. Mind you, both were wearing one food service glove on their left hand. But nope, they grabbed the bagels with their right hand. It was particularly gross because one girl had these long purple fake nails. I also saw her grab one of those plastic condiment containers (presumably for cream cheese?) and her bare fingers and nails went into the container. Like full on touching it. And who knows what bacteria is under those nails? I'm pretty sure what they were doing constituted as a violation of health / food service safety standards. \\n\\nMy boyfriend wasn't too bothered, but the real kicker is when the girl rang us up, she charged us for two nova lox bagels. We were both puzzled, and told her we had only ordered one. The girl brazenly responds, \\"I thought you ordered 2.\\" We insisted that we ordered one, and the girl retorts, \\"Why didn't you say something when you saw me making your order?\\" I was pretty ticked off at this point, because first of all, there was no way we could've 1) seen over the bar, 2) seen over the counter refrigerator cover and 3) known that she was making two bagels for us. Anyways, the woman refused to admit her mistake and we were forced to pay for two Nova Lox bagels.. and I don't eat Nova Lox so the second sandwich was basically a waste. \\n\\nThat being said. My NY bagel-snob boyfriend enjoyed the bagel, and said it was tasty. But that does not redeem Life's a Bagel in my eyes. HARD PASS since they clearly don't hire competent employees who know how to handle food properly or have any ounce of customer service skills.

Only downer I would say is really the long wait to place your order and get it (the lines always are chaotic.)"},{"name":"The Hideaway Bar","address":"516 Virginia Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"We were staying in a hotel off of Ivanhoe and were looking for a place to grab dinner on Sunday night.  A search showed that that The Hideaway was nearby and had an overall rating of 4 stars... And it had \\"Bar\\" in the title, which got extra points!  That said, while I love a good dive bar, this place was more cluttered and tacky vs. divey.\\n\\nWhen we pulled into the parking lot, the first thing I noticed were the porta-potties across from the patio area.  I jokingly said this must be a classy place, as they had porta-potties for the patrons.. It turns out that wasn't a joke!  As others have mentioned, the parking lot behind this bar is small; There were only about 8 patrons here when we arrived and we still got about the last open space. We had a look at the menu and it was pretty solid for a dive bar..Mostly burgers, wings, sandwiches and deep fried appetizers and sides, but a decent variety of all those things. \\n\\nI looked around and noticed that under the pool table they were storing lots of stuff in plain view of patrons, including large bundles of napkins, paper towels and boxes of other supplies.  When I turned around to check out the video games and pinball, I noticed they had boxes of snack chips stacked on one of the video games between the console and the screen. I've seen in photos as old as 2010 that it's always been cluttered like this with storage under the pool table and video games. When I was looking for the restroom, I was told that the portable toilets at the entrance to the parking lot were the only option.  The dispensers of hand sanitizer in the potties were empty, and there were beer bottles thrown into the toilets.\\n\\nThe bright side was the friendliness of the staff and the fact that this place has lots of screens for watching sports and other programming. Note that they do allow smoking here, and your clothes will reek of it once you've left, even with few patrons in the place.  This seems to be a bar for true and dedicated drunks, as their happy hour specials through the week start at 7 a.m. and their Saturday happy hour runs from 7 - 10 a.m.  We were told by one staff member that this is primarily for the nurses and employees of the nearby medical center who want to drink after they're finished the overnight shift, and that sometimes there is a small line waiting to get in when they first open in the mornings.\\n\\nI got the 10 wings for $7; ranch and blue cheese are extra as was celery, but I can live with that as the wings were pretty decent sized, though the mild wings I got were dry with no real sauce on them. I also got an order of fries which were good. They had a decent amount of beers on tap and in bottles as well as a full bar.  In total, with the wings, fries and 3 draft beers, my total bill came to just under $25 before gratuity.  Note that The Hideaway accepts cash only, though there is an ATM on site."},{"name":"Dunkin'","address":"715 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I've been coming here since 2009.

Guess what?  We would have stayed and had a third, maybe fourth round, which would have hiked up the bill, which would have hiked up his tip.  But he didn't give us that option.  Maybe we wanted dessert?  Nope.  Not an option either.  I've actually had this particular server twice now and had the same experience with him both times.  Too bad.  But...

I found Poor Calvin's to be lacking in terms of execution and overly expensive for what you get. Which is not to say that all those rave reviews are off base - experiences and tastes differ.\\n\\nAmbiance - old-fashioned semi-elegance, which I normally like in small doses and they do it right here. We were seated in a two-top off to the side. However, while being kind of cozy, the seats at that table are straight-backed and without cushioning, which became uncomfortable before too long and excruciating in the end. There were plenty of tables with regular chairs that were empty when we arrived and remained so for the duration.\\n\\nNoise level was fine at the beginning. They were playing nice tunes at a volume that still allowed conversation. But then the music was turned up to the point we were having to lean over and talk loudly, so we asked to have it turned down. This required a somewhat awkward visit from the manager.\\n\\nDrinks: I wanted the Poor Calvin's Fusion I saw on the website menu, but it wasn't on the restaurant menu. No problem, I ordered another drink, the name of which I've forgotten (it's not on the website menu). Made with whiskey, 'likor' and muddled fruit. Really good. Wife ordered the 'PHO' cocktail (also not on website menu), an 'earthy' drink. Both drinks hit the spot with us respectively - but not from the other's perspective. Perhaps my point is that maybe they should keep their website menu updated. This isn't a Chinese delivery joint.\\n\\nWhen we ordered a second round, we were told it would be a while. The restaurant was not yet even halfway filled, it was early in the evening and the bar can't keep up. The drinks came out about twenty minutes later. Also, apparently that second PHO was the last one available. The people next to us ordered it but were told it was sold out. 7:15 on a Friday and they sell out of a signature drink?\\n\\nMussels - half didn't open. I was offered more 'to take home' but that doesn't really work, does it? The mussels should have been taken off the bill, although I didn't press for that. What kitchen lets a dish of mussels go out the door with literally half unopened? I don't mean a lot of them. Half. While it was dark in the dining area (too dark to take unlighted photos), presumably the kitchen has working lights. That just speaks to very poor quality control. I was quite disappointed. Mind you, the mussels that did open were very good; tasty broth. The toasted bread that accompanied the mussels is interesting - it works and this from someone who swears by hard-crust sourdough for mussel broth dipping.\\n\\nBasil rolls - excellent, great presentation. Others have commented that they tend to be dry. We did not find them so. A spicy dipping sauce would have been good, though. \\n\\nCrab cakes - one cake with one onion ring. Both good, not great. Over-priced for just one crab cake, although I suppose good crab is expensive.\\n\\nLobster mac & cheese, a restaurant favorite based on reviews. Wife thought it good, remarking that it wasn't too 'lobstery'. I'm allergic but tasted it anyway. I thought it just was OK mac & cheese. Not as good as you'd get at many BBQ joints (without the lobster, of course). \\n\\nRed Snapper in curry - this dish was pretty tasty and actually does have a slight kick. Lots of fish, so it's filling. Maybe could use a green vegetable ingredient. \\n\\nThe Chilean sea bass was enticing on the menu, but we are wary about ordering that particular fish due to the prevalence of objectionable fishing practices. The restaurant could not assure us the bass was sourced from providers that use sustainable methods, something I think they should be able to do given the notoriety of Chilean sea bass industry. All restaurants of this caliber should be able to speak to where they sourced their fish and meat. Poor Calvin's is certainly not alone in this failure. \\n\\nWe were very intrigued by the dessert offerings, but by this time, the hard seats had done a number on my back so we had to decline. The red velvet cake was calling to us.\\n\\nServer - great job; very knowledgeable and helpful. No issues at all with his service. \\n\\nBottom line was that we spent about twice what we would at, for example, a good gastropub but did not enjoy the food as much, were offered a more limited drink menu that the restaurant itself couldn't support in a timely manner and were considerably less comfortable at the table.

Blue Dahlia has been one of my best-kept secrets for a long time, but I guess it's time to let the cat out of the bag.  So here goes...\\n\\nI love absolutely everything about Blue Dahlia -- especially the fact that it's just a few blocks away from my apartment. It's the perfect spot for breakfast, lunch, or dinner, and I think each meal is best enjoyed in a different one of the three sections of the restaurant. So that's how I'm organizing this review.\\n\\nBREAKFAST / BRUNCH - Nothing beats sitting on Blue Dahlia's back patio early in the morning. The beautiful bamboo and foliage, the birds singing, the friendly cats that lie around begging to be petted.  It's perfect.  Especially on cooler mornings.  You can't go wrong with anything on their breakfast menu.  The frittatas are my go-to, but the Belgian waffles, chocolate croissants, and granola parfaits are all excellent as well.  Or, just order the assorted breads & spreads, which is an inexpensive way to serve two people, and never disappoints.  And did I mention that one of the spreads is Nutella?  Yeah, you heard me.  \\n\\nRegardless of what you get to eat, I definitely recommend that you order is one of their superb chai tea lattes.  I haven't found a better one in town.\\n\\nGuys, listen up!  This is the perfect place to take your girlfriend on a lazy Sunday morning.  Just trust me on this.  You'll thank me later.\\n\\nLUNCH - I prefer to enjoy lunch on their front patio.  Whether it's a beautiful sunny day, or a light drizzle, the table umbrellas make it an enjoyable place to sit and chat with a friend, read a book, or work on your laptop.  Plus, you can bring your dog along to enjoy lunch with you.  As for the food... lunchtime at Blue Dahlia is all about their open-faced sandwiches (tartines).  I'm particularly partial to the roasted turkey w/ cranberry chutney, the prosciutto w/ mozzarella, and the smoked salmon w/ cream cheese.  All of them come with fresh seasonal fruit on the side as well.\\n\\nDINNER - Blue Dahlia is a great place to take a date for dinner.  Sit inside the restaurant and enjoy some excellent French dining and a glass of wine.  You can't go wrong.  The ratatouille here is the best I've ever tasted, and the wait staff has never failed to recommend an excellent wine pairing.\\n\\n\\nSo there you have it.  All my best secrets.

My boyfriend got some boar pasta that was decent but he got 3 pieces of bone in it... Big pieces.  Good thing he has strong teeth.  I got the capellini.  The sauce was thin and watery, not creamy at all like a carbonara should be.  The noodles had an undercooked ramen consistency.

After 2 hours or so of waiting (1.5 hours on the waitlist to be seated, and another 30+ min to get our first bite in), this place is worth the wait for yummy brunch food. Came here during Memorial Day weekend, and man, it was super packed on a Saturday morning. I guess on crowded mornings, average wait time is usually around an hour or so. Make sure to allow ample time if you decide to dine at this place. All names are put on a waiting list and when it's your turn, your name will be called out.\\n\\nWhen the big wait is over, it was time to nom on some brunch goodies. For the majority of my group, we ordered: chicken & waffles, cheesy grits (side), banana french toast, po boy sandwich, oyster benedict, and biscuit and gravy. \\n\\nFood portion: HUGE. These dishes are enough to split with one or two other people easily if you're not a huge eater.\\n\\nFood quality: Chicken & waffles = YUM. The chicken was well seasoned enough that you didn't need much sauce to put on it. As for the waffle, it was light and crispy. The banana french toas was a very sweet dish but executed well with the fresh bananas and yummy toast. Definitely a nice contrast against the chicken & waffles. As for the cheesy grits, these were alright but quickly forgotten due to it average taste. Biscuit & gravy = yummy and filling. Can't go wrong with this option. Didn't get much of a chance to try out my friend's dishes for the benedict and po boy but both looked equally appetizing and big. \\n\\nPrice = pretty cheap for the large amount of food and yummy flavors. \\n\\nService: Service was so so.

They are not covered in some overpowering sauce that makes a mess of your fingers and they are crispier than any other sauced wing you've ever had. My 3 friends agreed that they were some of the best Wings they've ever had in their life but they would have liked something to dip them in. I didn't mind not having a dip.

I vowed never to go back. I was asked to go to lunch with a group of 10 so I decided to give Seasons & Regions another try.  As we were seated, the server informed us, in a terribly condescending way, that there will be an 18% gratuity added as a new policy. As a former food server for 15 years, I understand, but when it's presented the way it was presented, I felt trapped. I mentioned to a fellow diner at our table that I didn't like being forced to give a tip because of a policy, the server abruptly said \\" And I like to pay my power bill\\" I was appalled. At that point, I decided I wasn't going to eat there. Because I was invited, I ordered Iced Tea.  The server continued to be condescending to our entire group by my observation as a former food server. Such things like refills and giving the correct meal to the correct customer seemed to be a challenge for this server. Everyone ate their meals and we visited.  Everyone finished their meals and as we waited for our bills to be delivered, I realized I had been there for over an hour and needed to get going. Since our bills weren't delivered, I excused myself from the group, asked a staff person standing at what looked like a cash register by the exit how much ice tea was, he said 2.50. I gave him that amount and left. As I was leaving a man came out and said\\" excuse me\\" and showed me a bill, again which I never received at the table, I said I gave the money to that guy at the door, he said \\"what guy\\" I said \\"the employee at the door, and I gave him the 2.50\\" the man said, \\"there's' an 18% gratuity owed\\" I gave him 50 more cents and left.  I will NEVER go back to this place and I WILL tell EVERYONE I know about my experience.  If a place of business, especially a restaurant, allows their staff to treat paying customers in a condescending way, then EXPECTS a \\"tip\\" (defined as To Insure Prompt service) it won't be long before karma gets the best of them.  For the record, I always tip more than 18% to any service person including my Barber because I know the service industry doesnt pay a whole lot, I spent 20 years in it.

And a giant cicada flew into my friend's hair, eek.\\n\\nI've gotten the rib sandwich and the pulled pork sandwich. Prices are reasonable. The rib sandwich ($6.75) wasn't particularly memorable and seemed a little tough. The chopped pork sandwich ($4.50) was sorta mushy due to being chopped extremely fine, and the pork flavor was lost amidst the slightly peppery BBQ sauce.\\n\\nRegarding sides, the rum baked beans ($1.60) aren't bad, offering a dominant ketchup taste, with rum secondary. The collard greens ($2.50) were all right; I prefer a stronger vinegar taste personally.

Bisq tries too hard.  Bisq tries so hard that it feels like they go out of their way to make the experience bad.  I would not recommend eating here for the following reasons:\\n\\n1. Trying too hard.  Their ability to cook food is excellent -- the chefs pull it off perfectly.  The failure is in the recipes themselves and in the quality of the ingredients.  First, strange combinations that Just. Don't. Work; aiming for a unique experience and failing.  Example: beautifully cooked ribs, covered in deep fried rice (ie, rice krispies). Disgusting.  Second, poor quality meat.  Bisq sells small plates.  If my lamb chop yields less than 25% edible meat, we have a problem.  We had a problem.\\n\\n2. Trying too hard.  Apparently, they are one of the top 100 wine restaurants in America, according to a magazine with the word wine in its name.  For a top wine restaurant, they sure have a narrow view of the wine world.  If it's not within 100 miles of France, it's not on the menu.  Bisq sells boring wine.  Also, if I prostrate myself by ordering a glass and not a bottle, do me the courtesy of pouring me the full glass.\\n\\n3. Trying too hard.  Bisq deploys decor and presentation to desperately persuade you of their excellence.  Ah, an illustration of a pig sectioned into parts!  They must know their meat!  And it's written in FRENCH!  Tr√®s original!  The for-sale \\"art\\" on the walls is a nice touch.  I'll gladly pay $300 for a print of your holiday snaps in southeast asia.

Seriously, the dessert was total shit, the risotto was ok at best (I had a few bites and proceeded to pack it in hopes dessert would be better worth my appetite and I indifferently left the risotto at a store by accident after) I thought this trendy place would be at least respectable, I used to work at Ciao Bella and the owner there admitted he rode on location and had location in his favor, but most of his menu was at least decent (please reopen soon Ciao Bella, I miss your dijon mussels!)\\n\\nCappuccino was nice, service was rather good, but I can't believe you disappointing it was. Also, I asked the waitress about the Spaghetti Carbonara and she straight up told me it wasn't so good. Problem with the risotto is the chicken stock was watery, it hadn't been made properly. The salad menu was boring and generic because I came in looking to have a fresh light lunch, instead opting for bleh risotto not worth the calories whatsover.\\n\\nI think this place is best for cocktails and espresso/cappuccino, I hope the other desserts suck less than the Tart with caramel and bananas thing I had (ie touched 3 bites of) It was no better than a processed grocery store freezer dessert that anyone with discerning taste would prefer not to waste their calorie budget (even if UNLIMITED!) on. \\n\\nI will give the service staff credit, the girls gave me a prime seat even though I was alone, since it was downtime between lunch and dinner.

I'm a BBQ snob. Yep. This was on my bucket list. I never thought I would ever eat at the smoked meat temple of BBQ here in Austin. Can someone pinch me.....am I dreaming?\\n\\nEvery food blogger, BBQ fanatic and disciple of smoked meat will mostly say that this place is in top 2 of the world. It is my top 1 ever. \\n\\nWhat is it about a non descriptive old one story building (looks like the old trailer they added wood patio to) in what seems like an old neighborhood  with no other fanfare around it. Not on estaurant row. No parking lot. Just a smoke house and a small 8 table cramped sitting area. The service area is butcher block top and the small island for fountain drinks. A great selection of local brew behind butcher block. Saw some great whiskeys and other stacked near by. And then the sign. Old frumpy worn velvet rows with those plastic letters you push in place to create a word. Small, simple words of meat with a price. You are now overwhelmed by the slicing and chopping of fall apart meat flying onto plates. I became dizzy, high on meat fumes. \\n\\nThe line in front of you consists of dazed almost drunk with meat patrons laughing hysterically as they anticipate their turn to point and drool at what they want. Everyone is laughing, some crying and all delirious. The servers perform a meat ballet, dunking and piling flavor packed smoked meat into a bowl of drippings and then drizzling it all over the other meats on your plate. My turn. My plate is handed to me and the server says \\"about 2 lbs of the best there, enjoy!\\"  I bet it was closer to 3 lbs. because everyone around me was pointing at it in awe and disbelief.  They were not measuring since we bought all u can eat for the private party.  The room (or trailer) starts spinning. I have not had a drop of alcohol yet tonite. \\n\\nSomehow you carefully balance your plate and make your way to an open chair. I'm trembling with anticipation and oblivious to everything going on around me as I sit there in wonder. I look up and notice that others are doing the same. I don't know anyone at my table. But we are instant friends at the gate of bbq heaven with great joy singing HALLELUJAH!  \\n\\nI finally pick up a piece of meat and aim for my mouth. Then I am transported to a place I could never ever imagine. I'm laughing, crying, chewing, smelling, devouring and feel as if I am floating on a puff of smoker pillows. Someone pokes me and asks if I am ok. I think I look at them and through my daze and I barely shake my head yes smiling and stuffing my face hole with more and more. \\n\\nRatings below are based on 5/5 being the best. My star gauge is now forever broken due to taste overload and I have lost all sense of what reality is.  I had to add extra stars because not doing so would be criminal, wrong and just plain insane\\n\\n15/5 brisket. Juiciest, most succulent perfect slices covered by dark crusty bark. Pink ring of joy circling the meat as to help you target the best bite ever\\n\\n12/5 turkey with a pink ring so moist and juicy that it melts before you can get it to your mouth. I'm in awe. \\n\\n13/5 rib. Juicy, Smokey perfectly tender that if I had dentures I would have removed them and gummed them to death for maximum enjoyment. \\n\\n12/5 pulled pork. Perfect stings of juicy moist greatness. \\n\\n5/5 potato salad\\n\\n5/5 smoked beans\\n\\n10/5 pecan pie\\n\\n12/5 banana cream pie \\n\\n5/5 ambience. This is still a perfect score. I should add 3-4 more stars but trying to keep it real and somehow trying to keep everything in balance. I get that they don't want a big dining room. I understand the drab color and worn mismatched furniture. It keeps everything in controlled chaos otherwise you would not get the warm homey feeling that you just ended up in nirvana. Focus needs to be on the meat. Not on the time, lack of decorating nonsense or lack of any art. It's about the MEAT!!\\n\\n10/5 Service is fast efficient and incredibly polite. We rented the whole restaurant for dinner. They are not open for dinner. The energy and passion...Aaaamazzzing. \\n\\nI can't move. My plate of meat was mostly gone. My body is tingly. Two of the CEOs help me up from my seat and take me out into the cold air to see if I can catch my breath. Actually they wanted to move me out of the way so they could sit down and experience  the overwhelming joy I just did. \\n\\nOne of the hosts hands me a can of local beer for me and pats my head saying \\" don't worry, you will be ok, it's normal\\" then gives me a large Texas smile and goes to the next 5 people sitting on the wood deck saying the same thing to them. I now hear cheering, laughing and people singing the praises of just a normal looking , non celeb, slim dark haired guy with glasses and his throne of bbq meat. What a night.

We were definitely seated in under 20 which was a pleasant surprise!\\n\\nWe were seated downstairs and the downstairs host took care of us and took us to our seat. We were greeted with freshly made chips in a big bowl with a side of yummy salsa. Our server was so sweet, wish I remembered her name. We were so anxious to eat we already knew our order the moment she asked us for drinks. I got a frozen strawberry margarita with sugar rim, my friend got the same but on the rocks with a salt rim.\\n\\nFor entrees, I got the shrimp and crawfish quesadilla and my friend got the shrimp and crawfish enchilada with queso sauce and we both added guac for only 95 CENTS. Chipotle should take notes, price wise haha. Everything came pretty quickly and we ravenously enjoyed our food. Honestly, that was the best margarita I've had to date, no joke. They were so generous in the seafood portioning and guess what? The whole quesadilla was $9... DIDN'T EVEN BREAK DOUBLE DIGIT.\\n\\nI'm so passionate every time I talk about this place. Also our waitress was sweet enough to split our order on separate checks so that was nice. Oh also, they card here hardcore. She took our IDs and scanned them so be wary all you fake ID holders.\\n\\n10/10 would recommend. Love this place to pieces.

I am not expecting the same experience as I understand American adaptations can be excellent as well. This was a miss for me. The flavor was light and sweet but not savory.

He'll ask me what I'm thinking of doing, how many people, etc., head to the meat case or walk-in and then to his butchering station in the back of the market. While he's carving, we chat about his business, his ballroom dancing, his girlfriend (now his wife), my job and family. After going there for several years, he knows what cuts I like but he'll often suggest something new. \\n\\nHis beef is only USDA Prime and you pay for it but you can't get this grade at the supermarket chains. His lamb, pork & chicken are also awesome quality and mostly comparable to supermarket pricing. He doesn't carry every cut - no ribs or pot roasts, for example. For holidays, he'll carry special items like prime rib roast for Christmas & New Year's and whole lambs for Greek Easter (and folks travel from some distances to buy these). I've even tried goat when a special order customer didn't pick up. Tony makes his own hot & sweet Italian sausages, and Greek sausage by request, but be warned his hots sell out fast every summer weekend. He also grinds his own hamburger, and will grind mixes for meatballs (beef with pork) and such. Some of the area businesses like Geoffrey's Cafe and Sophia's Grotto also buy meat & sausages from Tony. \\n\\nTony also carries good quality Italian pastas & tomato products, Italian coldcuts & cheeses. \\n\\nAll in all, because of Tony's Market, I don't buy meat at supermarkets any longer.

When the restaurant was opened at 5:30 and everyone seated, the place was probably 80% full.  \\n\\nThe food was great.

Nothing too special about the cornbread, it kind of felt like something was missing when it arrived at the table.  Now that I've thought about it, the thing that I thought was missing was honey-whipped butter, or just honey.

My 2 daughters enjoyed 2 different shrimp dishes, my son ate and enjoyed his whole bacon whiskey burger and my husband said the barbeque brisket tacos were tasty and filling. My dinner, shrimp and parmesan sirloin, on the other hand, was disappointing. I ordered my steak medium rare with garlic mashed potatoes and broccoli.  The steak was  just shy of well and there was a fist print in my mashed potatoes. The waiter, Sean was nice enough to wait for me to cut into it. When disappointed, he quickly took it back. He then brought a new steak that was nearly raw and cold. The manager was brought to our table and instead of being kind, he rudely asked what I ordered and how do I really want it cooked. He seemed very condescending. When Sean the waiter came back after refiring the raw steak, it was again overdone to medium with barely any pink. At this point, as my whole family was done, I just gave up and asked to have it put in a togo box. If it were not for Sean the waiter, I probably would have just cried, as this was supposed to be a family night to celebrate my new job. My plate was taken from our bill, but there was no apology from the rude manager. I doubt that I will return to this Applebees.

Everything worked so well together, and I couldnt imagine having this without the onion goodness on top.  The only small complaint is that $14 is quite pricey for a pretty small (6\\"-7\\") dish.  Its a good side to share with people, but definitely not as an entree salad.  Unfortunately, they don't serve it as an add-on side salad.  \\n\\nI'll admit, when I first saw pictures of the burger on the website, I thought it looked small (or rather, not massive).  but when it arrived, my eyes nearly fell out.  It was a pretty loaded burger, with cheese, bacon, alfalfa sprouts, deep fried potato straws, a tangy sauce, along with homemade pickles, which were soooo good.  The patty was juicy and delicious, and everything was tied together so well.  I thought the best part of the burger was the bun - it was a good ratio, held together well and didn't fall apart, and it was actually slightly chewy, which I really enjoyed!

I'm from Hawaii and lived in LA, so I've been eating all types of ramen my entire life. I've come here a couple times now over the past few years, and have really tried to like it, but I have a few complaints:\\n\\n1) Too salty/greasy. I have tried a couple different items on the menu, and my main problem with them is that they are either too salty (esp the veggie ramen), too greasy, or both. I don't get much umami flavor. Usually, when I eat ramen, I have to stop myself from sticking a straw into the leftover broth and drinking it all...with these, I find myself leaving most of the soup in the bowl.\\n\\n2) No substitutions without charging. I do not eat much meat, mainly because I don't like the texture. Every other ramen place I've been to has no issue with me replacing meat (chicken, pork, beef) with ajitama (half boiled, seasoned egg), since meat is usually the more expensive option. I understand not letting me substitute for something more expensive, but at Tatsu-Ya, they would not let me \\"trade down\\" for an egg, saying that I could ask for no meat, but they would have to charge me to add an egg, even if it was a substitution. It's a small thing, but it makes a difference when I wasn't sold on this spot in the first place.\\n\\n3) Service left something to be desired. Some of the staff are very friendly, others are clearly trying to get you in and out as quickly as possible.

After sitting on a plane from NYC for 7 hours (a layover in Denver, but same plane so I couldn't get off), I was starving. I knew, \\"tonight was the night\\". I had no doubt that I was in for an experience of barbecue bliss like I'd never had before. \\n\\nI arrived at your restaurant at 8pm(ish). Parking was easy to find. I walked through the front door. No line. Odd because online pictures suggested, there was always a line out the door. \\n\\n\\"I must be really lucky\\" I thought. \\"I arrived early and the other festival folks must not have prioritized their barbecue as smartly as I\\". Oh, the hubris. \\n\\nI marched giddily to the counter. I felt like Charlie in Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory. I was greeted by a pleasant man with a full beard. \\"What can I get you?\\" he asked warmly.\\n\\n\\"My man, I have traveled all the way from NYC and my first stop was here. I hear this is the greatest barbecue in the world.\\"\\n\\nThe man grinned knowingly, confidently, \\"Oh, it is!\\"\\n\\nSomething about his confidence assured me: I had made the right decision to come to this place. \\n\\n\\"What can I get yah?\\" the bearded man behind the counter asked me.\\n\\n\\"Well, I dunno...\\" Somehow I was unprepared for this question. \\"I mean, I think I want everything, I'm not sure what to choose\\"\\n\\nThe man behind the counter laughed jovially. \\"Oh, sir, not to worry. I have just the thing. How about I make you a plate with everything?\\".\\n\\nI was instantly bonded to this man. \\"Sure, that sounds great!\\" I said with the same intonation as a child thanking Santa Claus after Santa Claus just agreed to give him ALL the presents\\n\\nI slid over to the cash register.

He had finished creating my meat plate and handed it to me.\\n\\n\\"Okay, how much?\\" I asked.\\n\\n\\"Oh, it's free. The party has paid for everything\\".\\n\\n\\"The party? Oh...\\" and it was at this crucial moment I made a fatal error. I could have lied. I could have taken the plate and eaten my fill. Nobody would have noticed. I could have come up for seconds if I wanted to. But I just had too much damn respect for the bearded mam behind the counter. We were barbecue brothers and I just had to come clean.  \\"Well, I'm not with the party and I'll gladly pay for this plate of delicious barbecue\\". \\n\\nThe man pulled the plate literally out of my hand. \\"Oh, I'm sorry, this is a private party, there's no food for anyone else\\". \\n\\nIt's hard for me to express the sense of betrayal I felt in that moment. I thought that guy and I, we had an understanding. I love barbecue. I love Franklin's. I loved HIM. He's my SANTA, damnit! At the very least, I thought he'd allow me to PAY for my meal.

Today is Tuesday, and I showed up to wait in line at 8 this morning. There were already about 25  people ahead of me. I was told by the friendly man next to me that, had I arrived at the same time on a Saturday, the line would've already extended to the street. That didn't happen until about 9:30 this morning. If you're brave enough to visit on a Saturday, show up at 5:30 for the best spots in line. \\n \\nLike other reviews have mentioned, I recommend you accept the fact that you must wait for hours to get this delectable food. Bring a chair, an umbrella (especially if you're stuck sitting in the parking lot), water (beer and other tailgating supplies if you're with friends), and a book. Everyone's excited to be there, and no one cuts the line, so despite the early hour, you'll enjoy hanging out with happy people. Plus, the smell starts seeping through the place after a while, and that'll keep you motivated to stay in line. \\n\\nAnd if you forgot your line-waiting necessities, fear not. Around 9:30, staff members walk around to sell sodas, water, and beer. They also come around and ask what types and quantities of meat you want, which helps the kitchen determine when to cut off the line (they keep the place open until selling out of food, which happens every day). So come with your order in mind; the menu's available online. \\n\\nDoors opened at 11:01, and the line moved immediately inside. I was lucky enough to get into the air conditioning by about 11:10, but the line was still so long that I waited an additional 50 minutes before ordering. They slice the meat and ladle out sides right in front of you while making cheery small talk. That's another thing that sets this place apart from others: the staff is exceptional in its customer service. \\n\\nThe food is, as expected, phenomenal. All the meat is tender and doesn't require barbecue sauce, although it's equally yummy. Everyone raves about the brisket, and of course, it's fantastic, but I particularly enjoyed the ribs.

Very posh atmosphere, but not pretentious and not overdone.  The waitstaff was very pleasant.  Didn't have a reservation, but I was all by my lonesome and the place was big enough that it did not matter.  Lots of people in there though enjoying themselves.\\n\\nHaving had some southern barbecue the night before, well, next on my wish list for further southern cuisine included collard greens and fried chicken.  Wouldn't you know they had but they had buttermilk fried chicken with collard greens!  Actually I did know ahead of time since I saw their website.  But, hey, still scored a two-fer on my southern cuisine list.  Cool!\\n\\nThe waiter brought me a piece of cornbread and a biscuit.  Both were really good.  I wish I had had more of it, but no worries.  The chicken, a breast piece and a wing, was fried to perfection.  I was a little worried about being in such a fancy place and picking up fried chicken, but it was easy to cut it away from the bone.  I managed to eat it with a knife and fork, which I would normally find too pretentious, but I am sure I scared a few locals during my trip to Moe's who had to endure seeing me go all rabid-dog on some rib bones and wanted to at least pretend for one night that I wasn't raised by wolves.  That's my long-winded way of saying I acted like a human being and genteel and ate with a knife and fork.  \\n\\nAnyway, the chicken was delicious.  Crispy, but not heavy.  They weren't all that big, however.  They were sensibly sized.  The collard greens were also cooked to perfection.  The mashed potatoes were great too, but got eclipsed by every other element on the plate.  I could have used a tad bit more of both the collards and the mashed potatoes, but I am not really faulting them for that.  I also got a side of mac and cheese and that was REALLY good.

The staff are wonderful to deal with: very knowledgeable about the menu items, patient, and attentive.\\n\\nTheir rotating drink menu consists of 3 or 4 seasonal drink specials. I prefer drinks like the Indio Lime Cosmo (one of this month's (Oct. 2019) seasonal drinks) or the Blueberry Lime Drop (last month). Despite it not being my usual type of HH drink, I must say that I also enjoyed the Maple Old Fashioned for this current month. \\n\\nThe seafood is fresh and for the most part delicious. I did find the sauce on the Albacore Demiglaze a bit too sweet and would have preferred the tuna blackened. And the Seafood Platter was excellent, but I thought there was a bit too much white real estate on my plate. The best choice is the Hot Seafood Salad, which is absolutely spectacular in my humble opinion. The combination of fresh, hot seafood and cool salad is perfect. One caveat: be careful what salad dressing you pick for it. We always change ours to the ginger and have it on the side.

The biscuits were fluffy & perfect. \\n\\nIf it weren't for the emphasis on sharing and the fact that anytime waitstaff or another customer walked passed us someone got bumped, this place would have been better in my book but they kind of miss the mark between the space, sharing concept and the space & execution to facilitate sharing- leaving sort of a cluttered, messy experience to the customer. Totally come here but manage your expectations accordingly.

They also had live music which was rare for Orlando but really great. The atmosphere made me feel like we were on a vacation except I knew Kelly's ice cream was right across the street. :) We ordered carnitas with the truffle mashed potatoes. OMG! If you only order one thing, get the potatoes. We were supposed to share them but I pretty much ate the entire thing by myself. The carnitas were just ok and the rice and beans weren't exciting.

I knew as soon as I saw the 40 person line at 4:58PM for their 5PM grand opening that Ramen Tatsu-Ya had something good to offer. How good? Like... Japanese good. Additionally, you are really taken care of. Servers are running like chickens with their heads cut off. Chickens that can promptly deliver water and anything else you request. Except free ramen.\\n\\nOn this, the ramen is actually extremely cheap. I was expecting to pay $18 (i.e. the last time I had \\"fancy\\" and \\"authentic\\" ramen was in the Big Apple), but I just ordered 2 different bowls here to make up for such a low price--the basic is $8.50. Additionally, you order at a counter, so you aren't tipping a full 20%... or should you?\\n\\nI gotta imagine they really raked in the dough here. The accompaniments can really add up, but you can surely satisfy yourself by adding on 4 oz. of additional noodles for $2. You pay at the forefront, leave some broth, and yell out \\"I need more noodles!\\", but in a more elegant Japanese dialect. The extra item I would recommend? The katsu slider. Honestly, it tastes exactly like a fried meatloaf with juice injected into it would.\\n\\nThe ramen. I can't even speak. The tonkatsu was rich and super porky; it did leave a little \\"oomph\\" to be desired; I think it just needed a LITTLE more meat flavor. I don't know how I would recommend an adjustment, but whatever.... it was still amazing. This fact was PROBABLY overshadowed by the whale of an experience I had with the MI-SO-HOT. Funny? Yeah, whatever. It was outrageous. They spice up a miso-style ramen broth. And it gets your sinuses and happy juices flowing. Interpret that as you will.\\n\\nI don't know what Yelp restaurants you have in mind next, but if isn't Ramen Tatsu-Ya, you are not American. Well... I guess true \\"'Mercans\\" wouldn't be waiting ~2 hours from a dish that hails from the famous island of the Far East, but this would satisfy even the most skeptical eater.

The sandwich innards conisted of seared tuna (but coated in cajun seasoning?), lettuce, bacon, tomato salsa, jalapenos and spicy mayo sauce. Upon the first couple bites, I was thinking surprisingly yummy! But then as I kept eating it, the taste just got weirder and weirder. The seasoning on the tuna was overpowering, the rice patties were falling apart, and the bacon just did not go with seared tuna.

Places like Black's and Kreutz and smitty's have taken notice. Though probably more established regionally the fan fair nationally and online has been 10 fold those historical giants. \\n\\nThey sell out every day and don't always do everything, so your lucky if you get the coveted beef ribs. Most every day they do the pulled pork and/or pork ribs, but me being from CA, we don't get many beef ribs and the one's we do get aren't near the quality here. So when you get a good BBQ pitmaster with good ribs you inevitably get your mind blown. I'm an amateur bbq'r myself and admire the skills it takes to watch and brisket, one the longest smoking cuts out there. \\n\\nThe stories are true, they will sell out of everything, it's not that they don't make enough for people, the line would be to El Paso if some people had their way. It's a matter of quality control, love, timing, etc. If your near the end, you get whatever you can, but the brisket is what they are known for. You may ask and reactions seem sensationalized. No it's that effing good. Imaging if every bite was like the perfect burn ends you've ever had, but not so sweet. Juicy, tender, perfectly cooked, smoke ring, it's competition bbq dang near plated that way too. The lines will boggle you, must come prior to 10am to ensure your food.\\n\\nFrom my experience Texas bbq doesn't use sauce, but they sell them here, all house blends, good flavor, but I don't think they need much. The sides are high quality and compliment well, desserts like the pie's are unique. I've never had bourbon in my pie before, but then again I'm from California. It's hot in Texas and as you get closer they offer a little shade and some misters. Buy the water and cold drinks in line and bring a snack to keep your stomach ready for the feast ahead. I brought lawn chairs which was a great idea. T-Mobile and their nonexistent 4G sucks so don't' even open your phone or it well be dead from the heat and receipt before you get food. \\n\\nIt was so good I wasted damn near a whole day while visiting because I wanted to eat here again. Service is friendly, but they understand they put people through quite a bit due to their popularity and they could probably expand, but it's better than when they had a trailer apparently. Prices are reasonable, probably due to the low overhead costs. D√©cor, who cares about the d√©cor when their BBQ is this good.

(3.5/5)\\n3) South City Breakfast - was my wife's meal and included grits, bacon & eggs. She rated the taste as slightly above average. (3.25/5)\\n4) Chef's Steak Special - included sweet potato hash, which our friends enjoyed. I had a small sample, but I was not overly impressed with the flavor of the steak or the potatoes. (3.25/5)\\n\\nMY PLATES\\n5) SheCrab soup - Excellent and a must have if you are dining here. (5/5)  \\n6) Crab Cake Hash - was beautiful in presentation and almost too pretty to eat. The fingerling potatoes were tender, the eggs were perfectly scrambled and the crab cakes were ALL lump crab meat and no detectable bread filling. My only complaint with this dish is there was some sort of bitterness to the juices that settled at the bottom of the plate and was not appealing to my palate. Would have been near perfect without that vinegar bitterness. (3.75/5)\\n7) Shrimp and grits - were good, but compared to Local Republic in Lawrenceville, they would not be worth the drive into the city. I thought this dish could have used a little more salt and garlic, but they did a good job on the grits. (3.5/5)\\n\\n\\nTHE VERDICT ---------- - - - - - - - - - -\\nAtmosphere alone makes South City Kitchen worthy of a visit. It's absolutely perfect for a romantic dinner or a small intimate gathering of friends. However, most of the food I sampled today missed the mark and didn't taste as great as it looked. Several dishes were a kiss of seasoning away from being wonderful, yet just enough to not allow me to be wow'd by the flavors. I do look forward to coming back to try the dinner menu, which seems to get rave reviews. But for now, BRUNCH only rates 3.5 out of 5 in flavor with high marks for service and d√©cor. I would not consider this a \\"must have\\" destination for breakfast, but a solid choice if you happen to be in the area.\\n\\n\\nFINAL NOTES\\nI hope this review does not discourage anyone from giving SCK a try. I debated over the rating being a 3 or 4, however, since I wouldn't exactly consider myself a fan yet, 3 seemed most appropriate. Hopefully dinner here will change my mind."},{"name":"Pirates Dinner Adventure","address":"6400 Carrier Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"This week is their  20 year anniversary & last week groupon had tickets on sale for $20 bucks with 20% off ..

The delivery time was reasonable, the delivery guy was super friendly and the pizza came at a decent temperature. The taste left us flat and rather disappointed. The ham was lunch meat slices that they use on sandwiches and didn't work on the pizza at all. The pineapple is advertised in the description as fresh but it didn't seem fresh to me.

I have yet to try something I didn't like. \\n\\nFor appetizers, go with the CHILI CHEESE FRIES - an absolute must at $5.55 - made with skin-on french fries, a smoky, tangy BBQ chili, and liquid cheese. Other treats include the Fried Mac & Cheese (twisted, demented, and oh so delicious) and the Southern Fried Wings. If you're in a small group (under 4), try one of the following as your main - you won't regret it: [a] BBQ Reuben, [b] Pulled Pork Sandwich, [c] Fried Catfish Platter, [d] Spareribs. [e] Soulfire Platter (with 3 meats because you're sick like that). If you're with a larger party (both in number and in weight), I suggest the FEEDS FOUR SOULS combo.

The kebab meat itself wasn't as tender as I've come across at other kebab places (aka: Wally's! in Emeryville, CA), though the flavor was nice and savory. The med. salad was very fresh, but they give you soooo little -- consisted of crunchy cucumbers, tomatoes, and garnished with feta. The yogurt sauce was very pleasantly creamy, and the puffed bread was awesome -- kinda like a really thick pita. \\n\\nI'm sure I would have enjoyed it much more in sandwich form -- it looked way more appealing and big. \\n\\nSausage Plate, $8ish\\n- The flavors of the garlic sausage and saukerat were so savory and amazing!!! I really was tempted to clear my friends dish...but uh...yea...the portions were small and well...manners. LOL. Anyway, the potatoes were nice and comforting, but not as tasty. \\n\\nWhat I do really like is that they give you a great variety of sauces you can enjoy with your sausage! (See pics).\\n\\nLentil German Sausage Soup, $3.50ish\\n- Ahhhhhh!!! Probably the best lentil soup I've ever had!  It was so cold out, and this dish definitely warmed us up instantly! The sausage bits were so tender and added to the intensely comforting flavor of the soup. Again...wanted to finish my friend's soup..but..*slap wrists*! Control yourself!\\n\\nMy only complaint about the food is the presentation and portion size. It was a little too cafeteria like for me -- each item was served in separate compartments on a plate (see pix). Kinda made me feel like I was eating child-size portions...\\n\\n:::SERVICE:::\\nVery polite and checked up on us frequently. I asked for more of the med. salad (since there was so little to start with), and the waiter gave me some more without charge =). \\n\\n:::AMBIANCE:::\\nSmall, modern-esque, cafe-like. \\n\\nBathroom is very clean, modern, and smells good. *thumbs up*\\n\\nAll in all, if I am ever in Portland again and at this restaurant, I'd like to (..listen to my brother's suggestion..) try the Doner Kebab Sandwich and Lentil Sausage Soup again.

It was suppose to be a surprise but Marriott kind of screwed that up by emailing me. When I inquired to why a room was booked she spilled the beans.  I became a gitty school girl.  Told her we would need to leave like 5:00 to get in line to hopefully eat by lunch she did a double check and said What???!! She looked into it herself and due to some complications with pet sitter we couldn't leave until 7:00am. We zip down to Austin and get in line right around 10:00am. And met by a very nice employee who is standing at the end of the line explaining what the deal is. You will get to eat about 3:00-3:30pm   We asked what she thought they'd have left and she said brisket and sausage probably. Everything else most likely would be gone. I said ok and while wife held our spot I returned to the car to get lawn chairs and cooler. (Tip bring cooler full of beer or other drinks. It is like a tailgating environment). \\nThe doors open at 11:00 and that initial opening allows the line to move about 50-60 yards. And really fools you into this won't be that long. But then it comes to a stall.  You really start to become temporary friends with the people around you. And it is fun to watch people walk up and find out how long the wait is get disgusted and leave. They issued a family that was a few families back a sheet of paper that said last man standing on one side and last woman standing on the other. This was to mark the last family to be guaranteed food. Any one after them is waiting at risk. As families got disgusted with waiting that folder ended up at the family right behind us. Aaron hired possibly the best staff on the planet, they are super friendly and they make rounds coming to visit with the people in line. At one point they brought the back of line a sample of the chopped beef, and multiple occasions they offer drinks for sale. Fast forward 6hrs. We are able to get inside and try a sample of the brisket, and I truly had a religious experience, the brisket was rendered perfectly and the guy cutting it up asked what I'd like and had to hold up a finger to signify please wait as I completed my visions of cherubs flying around.  Sure enough by time we got up there beef ribs gone, pork ribs gone, turkey gone, sausage and brisket all that as left (except for chopped beef) so ordered a link of sausage 1lb of lean brisket and 1lb of juicy brisket.  Wife like lean I like juicy. Feeding 4 people with this and had about half left. I'm thinking their scales are off and they give generous lbs. but I could be wrong. We also ordered a side of their beans. Very good as well has brisket in them. Back to the brisket. They use simple seasonings of just salt and pepper but the type of brisket they use is hormone free and I tell you it makes a difference. Also instead of wrapping in foil he wraps in butcher paper when cooking and it changes how it cooks somehow I think.  Perfect amount of oak smokiness and the bark that is created on the outside of the brisket is a perfect blend of char, salt, and pepper. The brisket has the perfect texture and resistance it almost falls apart with a fork but not quite. Just enough resistance to hold it together so you can get in your mouth. Once there you may experience a foodgasm.  Yes it is that good. I had to wait a week to write this review and I can tell you I'm almost crying that I don't have more.  \\nOn the table they have 3 sauces. 2 vinegar sauces one is very very thin, one is thicker. Both are good, but I recommend passing on them. The other sauce is an expresso sauce and it is slap your mamma good. A little spice but not too much and the expresso flavor melds with the perfect beefy flavor from the brisket and it is to die for. Keep in mind the brisket is so good a sauce isn't needed this is truly just an accessory but a good one.  I think you can pick up jars of it at HEB grocery stores.   I didn't get to meet Aaron but afterwards they did give me a tour of the smoke house part and showed me their smokers. very impressive and very hot room :).

The SPICY SALMON CARPACCIO and the 69 ROLL (basically a California roll with unagi and wild salmon on top) were decent tasting.\\n\\nThe MISO RAMEN had an odd tasting soup base that I would advise against.

Not even just one free. I am a multi-cup drinker, so that's a big let down. I also am not in love with the amounts of fresh cracked peppercorn on most things.

I went with friends on a Saturday night for dinner and we had excellent drinks, excellent food, excellent service, excellent live music and all in an excellent atmosphere.\\n\\nFor food we ordered:\\n\\nFries (with miso aioli and ketchup) - The fries started getting a little less crispy towards the bottom, but the miso aioli was the bomb, period.\\n\\nSteak Tartare (with traditional garnish and crostini) - The best steak tartare I've had in Austin. It was tender and there weren't any bites that were chewy or get stuck in your teeth. Flavors were all complimentary too.\\n\\nShrimp Gratin (with coconut milk and baguette) - Awesome little bites bursting with flavor. This was a real favorite of the table.\\n\\nParisienne Gnocchi (with grilled carrots, goat cheese and black sesame) - From making and eating a fair amount of gnocchi over the years, I find that it's easy to mess up and it's all about the texture. I've never had better textured gnocchi than theirs here and that includes some amazing Gnocchi I've had in Italy. What I like about the Gnocchi here is that it's almost crispy on the outside which I've not experienced with Gnocchi before. The inside is creamy and when you combine it all with the other flavors it's just fantastic.\\n\\nDuck Leg Confit (with mascarpone, mustard, caramel and lime)- I almost always order duck when I see it on a menu. While it was a tad dry, the unique flavor combinations were on point.\\n\\nScallop Crudo (with watermelon, tomato water, and chili vinaigrette) - This was the only dish we did not like and did not finish (though the watermelon part was refreshing). When our server asked if we did not like it and all we said was yes, not a word more and she took it off our bill without hesitation. It's stuff like that which is appreciated, thoughtful and smart. It makes me want to go back and give them more business tonight.\\n\\nDessert:\\n\\nWatermelon Sherbet Mochi (with strawberry consomme, white chocolate, and hibiscus chicharron) - This was unique and while not exceptional, worth a try for something different.\\n\\nBrown Butter-Thyme Ice Cream Cone (with beet paper) - This was our favorite. You wouldn't think thyme and ice cream word work together, but it does here.\\n\\nDrinks:\\n\\nVieux Carre (Templeton rye, Pierre Ferrand Cognac, Carpano antica, benedictine, Peychaud's bitters, and angostura bitters) - This one was my favorite.\\n\\nSmoke on the Sea (Papa's Pilar Blonde, Monkey Shoulder Scotch, maraschino, grapefruit, and lime) - This one was good too, but for my palate, I prefer the Vieux Carre.\\n\\nMy friends all really liked their drinks as well.\\n\\nAtmosphere and Service:\\n\\nThe acoustics weren't great so it was a bit noisy with the live music, but it was a great time and the live band finishing their performance with the Cantina song from Star Wars was the perfect touch. The staff including our server, Kelsey, and everyone else who helped out during our visit were all very nice, very helpful and exceptional at what they do. The glass, metal and woodwork artistry/decor are all great too.\\n\\nI can't wait to go back again, I still need to try their burger, explore other items on the menu as well as get repeats of some of the dishes mentioned above. They have brunch on the weekend I'd like to try as well.

I waited in line with a friend for about 4 hours. We got in line at 9:30 am on a Wednesday (get in line earlier if you want to eat before 1:30 and tend to get hangry) and finally got food at around 1:30 pm. The weather was nice, so it wasn't a problem waiting outside. When the weather gets warmer, there are fans running with a nice mist which feels great and hopefully distracts from the fact that you're burning under the Texas sun. \\n\\nThe staff are really great- when you first get in line, they ask for your order and let you know ahead of time what they're expecting to still have when it's your turn to order. They do give conservative estimates, which is a good thing. When I was ordering, the ribs were supposedly sold out, but there were still plenty to spare when it was finally my turn to choose what I wanted to eat! Also, there are chairs and umbrellas provided by Franklins while you're waiting, so you don't have to sit on the concrete or grass. The bathroom is open starting at around 8 am and they do give out water so you keep hydrated. \\n\\nNow, onto the food. My advice: get an assortment of meats. There is somebody who cuts the meat and weighs it all out in front of you. Everything is delicious and you've waited a long time, so might as well try everything! I ordered the brisket, ribs, sausage, and had a bit of my friend's pulled pork. Apparently the turkey is also pretty delicious. The ribs were fall-off-the bone, the brisket was fatty and the best I'd ever had. Skip the bbq sauces they have at the table. You won't be needing them at all- the flavor is all in the meat, holy smokes. If you have leftovers, you can wrap them up in brown paper (provided by the cash register) and take them for home. And in the case that you still have room for dessert, Franklins has mini pies by cake and spoon. My friend ordered the lemon tart and I had the pecan pie. Between the bbq and the pie, I'd have to say that Frankins was one of the best meals I'd ever had.

You would think 4 shrimp may not be enough, but the grits to shrimp ratio was just right. I had another shrimp leftover after my grits were gone. Not mad at that!\\n- Fried chicken and waffles: I loved the chicken seasoning - it tasted like french fry seasoning if that makes sense and I mean that in the best way possible. I liked that the sweet potato waffles had cinnamon/pumpkin notes. \\n- Praline bacon: Just the right amount of sweetness. My shrimp and grits came with a biscuit, so my fianc√© and I made mini praline bacon/scrambled egg biscuit sandwiches. Reminiscent of day after Thanksgiving ham sandwiches. So good. \\n- Blueberry lemon curd buttermilk pancakes: Loved everything up until I tried these pancakes. They looked fluffy af but were dry and dense. Would skip these. \\n\\nI came on a Friday morning and waited about half an hour. It was so busy (as expected) but our server made every effort to make sure we were taken care of.
