Theirs is lighter, not as much fish, and the lemon marscapone and and spring greens give it a brighter, cleaner taste.

However the toast they use is brioche and didnt hold up to the mushroom gravy as it became mush towards the end. I think I'd like this dish more if they used a sturdier bread like ciabatta. \\n\\nChocolate nemesis- if you love chocolate get this, prob one of my favorite chocolate desserts I've had in a while.

So the q' better be memorable, and it better be representin' Cackalacky right proper! Of course there's so much regional variation in Carolina BBQ, that's almost a meaningless and intrinsically self-contradictory  statement ...\\n\\n\\nI found \\"Little Bit's\\" Chicken and Pork to both be super moist and tender and--indeed--- both  lived up to their  billing and had a pleasing bouquet of \\"just a little\\" bit o' smoke. Sometimes less is more, and all. The thing is, I found both meats to be surprisingly bland and lacking. Maybe this is deliberate, in as much as they are not trying to bury the meat's true flavor/quality in an overpowering sauce. \\"Little Bit\\" offers 3 different types of sauce,tru to the regional variations--- Vinegar (East-Carolina style), Red (Western), and Mustard (Dirty dirty Souf). I went w/the hottest one (West) and found it to be weak tea, unfortunately. For what you pay ($9 for the platter ) it's a good value, and they don't skimp on the meats or sides.\\n\\nSpeaking of sides, I went w/the black-eyed peas and was on the receiving end of a veritable mountain of them  loamy lil' legumes, yesirre.  Their brunswick stew was highly reminiscent of some of the better non-vegetyarian succotash I've had---their stew is a big bad bold medley of corn, butterbeans, taters, and smoked chicken. \\n\\n\\n\\nFinally, I paid extra for an extra side, as I just had to try their diced sweet potatos -- tender, moist, w/o the usual marshmallow horrow show.

When we ordered the crab fried rice, he warned us that it was made to order and may take a bit longer, but it did not take very long at all. Everything was delicious, although I did get a bit of shell when I took a bite of the crab fried rice. But with all the crab we ate, we were bound to get shell at some point. \\n\\nRyan packed all our leftovers (the crab fried rice could have probably fed four people) and even went out to the parking lot to find us when my husband accidentally left his credit card at the table.

Again, the ganache pieces in the ice cream tasted like salt balls and washed out any good chocolate flavor. \\n\\nOverall, the service here is always very good and the people who work here are happy to dish you out samples.

The Nordstrom restaurants vary in their approach: the one in San Francisco, in example, at their Market Street location is a full-service affair with a rather grand view of the city looking south from its sun-filled windows high above. The Florida Mall location however is more of a cafeteria/bistro situation where you order and pay up front but a waiter brings your food to you. This is fine, if a little confusing at first: for one, if you're paying with a credit card you pay before you even see your waiter much less have any experience with them that would determine what amount you'd care to leave for their tip. So, your only real choice is to leave a cash tip . . . even when paying with a credit card. So it is a bit awkward in all: I see no reason why since there is waiter service the waiter cannot also take the order but this is how it's done here. The setting is very nice: they've made the best use of the space and with the second-floor location, while there is not an impressive view as in San Francisco, the dining room is still sun-filled when the weather is good and the interior architecture makes the space feel larger than it really is and grander than even an upscale department store would suggest or seem to merit.\\n\\nThe fare offered is mainly salads and sandwiches but also a few dishes such as shrimp and grits. Both my friend and I had sandwiches, with mine being a citrus turkey and his some sort of grilled chicken sandwich. These were quite good although the fries included were lackluster and they were served with an aioli that was . . . purple. Yes, purple. Very purple and while it didn't taste bad, it looked quite odd. Orange aioli is enough of a curious affair, but a violet one is a bit much. It looked like they were trying to be innovative but it just stood out more than it ought to do so. In any case, the sandwiches themselves were very good, and that's what counts most, I suppose. We didn't try the desserts but I've heard only good things about them. \\n\\nIn all, this is possibly the best place in or around the Florida Mall to dine. Certainly, if you're shopping, it's a smart place to get lunch or dinner. You'll get a good meal in a very attractive setting at a fair price and not have to leave the mall nor even invest as much time as another sit-down restaurant might demand."},{"name":"Eat Me Speak Me","address":"340 Church St","city":"Decatur","stars":"4.5","text":"I recommend EMSM for fresh, playful dishes in a casual environment.\\n\\nJarrett is a visionary among Atlanta chefs. His food is a genre all its own, and I wish more restaurants would take his example and run with it. An incredible value, the Omakase (usually everything on the menu) is only $40. My one visit (at the old Gato location) is still one of the best meals I've had in the city. The staff has a way of working with fresh, seasonal vegetables and showcasing any ingredients they choose, even if I had never heard of or enjoyed them before. \\n\\nThe service was also very good. I emailed Jarrett to jump the waitlist a few days in advance, and my name was called right at 7PM. Everything came out relatively quickly, and I was happy with the waitstaff. \\n\\nThe menu was varied, and everything was available a la carte (about 9 items).

To date, we have had to either go all the way up to Anderson Ln to Star of India for decent Indian cuisine, or to Tarka, which really is just feaux Indian, and doesn't completely satisfy the craving. I was mildly intrigued that this new place had opened - happy to try a new place, but perhaps not quite convinced at the fact that it is hidden away behind other buildings.  You would really have to give specific directions to get to it. \\n\\nSo my wife, kids, and I decided to venture out for an evening meal, and give Pakwan a try.  We are all very glad we did!  We started with lamb samosas - they were perfect. Served with two chutneys, which were both delicious.  Not only that, but since the restaurant is fairly new still, they gave us complementary vegetable samosas as well, and they were also wonderful.  Just the right blend of spices, and the pastry was perfect. \\n\\nThe waitress brought each of us small glasses of lime-water to cleanse the palate between dishes.  This was a nice touch, and was tasty to boot. \\n\\nFor our meal we had the Murg Tikka Masala, the Kadai Lamb, and an order of Murg Biryani. Now, for my wife, chicken tikka masala is particularly difficult to satisfy - very few restaurants prepare it to the perfection that she seeks. Pakwan fulfilled this dish perfectly, in our opinion. The tomato and yogurt blend was just right, in fact we agreed it was the best we've had in Austin. The Kadai lamb was tender, spicy, and perfect. And the biryani was delicious!  The naan was fresh and hot, and perfect as well.    \\n\\nBut the final touch to this meal was the Kheer (rice pudding). None of us was really still hungry after all of the food, but our youngest loves kheer, so we ordered two small dishes to share among the four of us. It. Was. Incredible. My wife was the first to notice that it had COCONUT flakes in it!  Full or not, we downed it like it was our last meal. Plus I should note, I am not typically a big fan of kheer, but this stuff was absolute perfection. \\n\\nWe are excited that Pakwan has opened in our neighborhood!

The fired take on chicken cordon bleu was outstanding. Actually, any chicken appetizer is a winner. I mean really? How can one mess up chicken and cheese? I however did not enjoy the typical french food, such as the pate. It was like moldy mousse in my mouth.  Not my cup of tea, but the boy seemed to enjoy it. The drinks are strong, some a little too strong to even drink. Now, you may think, how is that possible? But I'm a cheap date and enjoy more than 1 drink. Thanks. The staff was friendly.

Was very impressed with my first tastes of this new local Barbakoa. They certainly have figured out how to make an entrance with great taste combinations and certainly a new approach to BBQ.\\n\\nThe true opportunities will hopefully find themselves worked out after opening weekend. Their BIGGEST fail...and should have had the most focus from the owner/management team is the poor efficiency of the order/pay line. The set up is exactly like Pei Wei - a cash out and ordering template we've seen before. Sadly, because the public is not familiar with the taste combinations or the menu...questions arise.\\n\\nWhile they have focused on having staff answer preliminary questions...the 'servers/bussers/hosts' haven't found a perfect balance of worrying about the right things at the right time...and when unable to determine their priorities, will result in just returning to a resting period.\\n\\nThe hold up is the drink fulfillment and seating process...something that you would' think would hurt the flow but it does. A great way to combat this is to have the order ready to be rung in by the time you get to the register. I watched an endless stream of customers suffer this system...some of which still had not been seen in the time I had to await my order, wash my hands, drink a beer, eat my dinner - and order desert.\\n\\nAgain...the saving grace here is the food. So amazing. The only miss was the Pig Pickn' Parfait and it's blend of vanilla cake, pineapple and mandarin oranges. None of these elements infused together and was shockingly boring with no citrus or vanilla notes to help close out the night.\\n\\nAmple parking, ample outdoor space...poor queuing for the ordering. I would encourage them to 'stage' their 'rugged, all exposed' pantry look too. While that's very hip to do - there is a lot more illusion than reality in that type of decorating. For example...the cookware and plates that envelope a Pei Wei counter are never used...all for 'show kitchen' illusion. The same needs to be staged for this very exposed kitchen environment.\\n\\nNothing about this review...other than the ordering efficiency should distract them from being very successful in Mills50.

The pinots were all sound and proved to be very good after they opened in the glass but the value just wasn't there. I then saw the markup on the wines by the bottle was huge: $45, $65, and $95.

By pre-prepping all of their flavorful homemade sauces and pasta, they can fire up your order in a pan in just a few minutes. The biggest problem you'll have is deciding what sauce you want. Be sure to get something flavorful though as by their natures, some of the cream sauces are a little bland, and if you don't know what to get, ask, the staff is totally willing to provide guidance based on what you tell them  you're tastes are. \\n\\nThe tiramisu they have is also heavenly, so you should always pick up a piece with your meal.

The waitress (who was texting near the food serving area) that we approached about seeing about a refund looked at us like we couldn't be more annoying. She got the manager. Upon explaining our disappointment with our meals and asking kindly for a refund, she retorted with a snarky remark about how the steak is fully cooked and something about the way it's vacuum sealed. \\"The customer is always right\\" didn't apply here apparently. We were certainly very cordial and pleasant enough just simply and quietly requesting a refund for the sandwiches. She gave it to us fairly quickly but the interaction was extremely negative.\\n\\nI have worked in food service for chains before and I know it's not the most fun job.

The server was rushing me to order because I was the only one at the table who didn't know what to order so she attempted to help me out quickly and ended up recommending a pasta with bacon in it without letting me know that it has bacon in it. I do not eat pork and I violate my religion! When I asked the server if it had pork it in she did not know, which shows that they do not know about the food they are selling, not do they care if the customer will enjoy the meal. When I told her I couldn't eat pork she grabbed the plate the plate from me and said \\"what do I do? Do I move it away from you?\\" In a sarcastic tone as if there was something funny about this situation. I refused to pay for the meal and was told that I ate all of it and that can't be done. I'm sure that even people who do not like their meals at other restaurants the waiters and managers are pleased to satisfy them without even a question and offer them another meal. The manager at this Cheesecake Factory took this situation very lightly as if it was unimportant to me or him! He was very careless about my religion and not very sympathetic! This is was truly pissed me off, I know people make mistakes and when they are not able to own up to those mistakes and act careless as these people who would ever want to come back here? As I was waiting for my friends I overheard other workers who had no part in this situation speaking about me, laughing and mocking me to their coworkers. After hearing this, I asked the guy who was speaking of the situation for his name which he would not disclose, and neither would the manager! He just stood there as if he was not a manager and as if there was nothing wrong with that .This situation was not everyone's business and I will be going to corporate about this, if not any further!"},{"name":"Burger 21 - Mall of Millenia","address":"4192 Conroy Rd, Ste 109","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"We were very excited to try this place & so wanted to enjoy it. Maybe our expectations were too high?\\n\\nThe staff was young & very inexperienced in the ways of customer service & knowledge of their products. The quality of product does not match the prices. The burger itself had very little flavor; however, the bacon & brioche bun were very good. The french fries are the basest product available frozen from a distributor (for the price you could reasonably expect fresh cut fries). The menu states that the Cheese & Ale fries are topped with bacon & chives. This is misleading as you are actually served a basket of fries & a side of Ale Sauce with a few bacon bits & a couple of chopped green onions mixed in the sauce. The Ale Sauce was grainy & had a pasty mouth-feel.\\n\\nMy dining partner asked for chili to be added to his burger & was told that he would have to order a cup of chili from the menu. Turkey based (healthier) but with no flavor, spice or zing. It had very large chunks of celery, was certainly not worth the price, & added no value or flavor to the burger. We also tried it on a portion of fries & poured Ale Sauce over it & were amazed at the lack of flavor & blandness of the products (so much for Chili Cheese Fries).\\n\\nThe sauce bar is fun & interesting. If you want any flavor from this dining experience you will need the use of sauces, salt &/or pepper.

This was my first time there so I didn't know what to expect. I like the industrial tone of PCM which well suits the building its in. So Ponce City Market basically a food court but instead of your usual fast food restaurants they support local business. Hops happens to be one of the local businesses. It serves fried chicken , a chicken biscuit, a chicken sandwich, and sides.\\n\\nWe ordered a whole bird, which consists of various pieces of fried chicken and four rolls, and a Mac and cheese to share amongst my 2 siblings. I've never had fried chicken besides from a chain and the best I've had before then would be from Cracker Barrel (which is still pretty delicious). We also got two lemonades. That's twenty six dollars which is pretty expensive but when I scouted out the other places, it seems like there's a premium to pay for eating anywhere in PCM.\\n\\nWe got it in a bag but the fried chicken is put into one of those buckets you'd find at a KFC or Popeyes. When I looked in the chicken I noticed that the skin was pretty dark and thick. We sat down and got everything set up before we started devouring the chicken.\\n\\nThe chicken was a little lighter on the seasoning and it was also a little less crispy then I expected. Don't get as confused as under seasoned or soggy but just that these two elements could improve a little better. The actual chicken though was really delicious. It came out piping hot, very tender and juicy. It was the best fried chicken I had but there wasn't too much competition. I was expecting some sort of biscuit but rolls were just rolls. Like the ones you get with your school lunch except better. But really, I didn't really care for these they were very bland and putting it with chicken only helps a little bit. The Mac and cheese was pretty good though it was pretty small so we should have gotten maybe a few more sides. The lemonades were just ok, better than the ones you get from minute maid but not something you get charged 3 dollars for.\\n\\nFor some reason we went to PCM again recently and i was really surprised how empty it was. I knew that on weekends and holidays there's a large crowd but the drop of people was bigger than I thought. I tried a bunch of other food at other restaurants but I went here to try there $4 chicken biscuit. There was no line, compared to last time when it was a 20 minute wait just to order.\\n\\nThe biscuit looked good. It came out scalding hot and the biscuit was nice and fluffy. There was one problem though. In a biscuit I know you are supposed to have lean chicken but this was tough. It was really hard to bite through without crumbling the biscuit ( which did happen). My expectations were high from last time but I was pretty disappointed seeing as that they served delicious fried chicken.\\n\\nIn the end it was a pretty enjoyable experience and I would come again just maybe not for the biscuit."},{"name":"McKay's Breakfast and Lunch","address":"144 Franklin St","city":"Quincy","stars":"4","text":"Stopped I here while in the area and saw good reviews on Yelp.

One should never leave a restaurant feeling they were ripped off, but last night at least the four of us left with that impression.  The server was pleasant, but was remiss in not explaining that the scallop special was really an appetizer portion and the chef should never have passed it off as a dinner special.  The gnocchi was pan seared first and had a skimpy amount of ragu sauce.  I don't usually write reviews, but Accanto has been a solid neighborhood place to eat in the past and it will be a shame if last night is an example of a change in management's decision to cut portions to increase profits.

However, where it differs is:\\n\\n- less selection of veggies compared to old location\\n- no pineapple chunks, kimchi or sesame seeds to sprinkle on your cooked bowl\\n- rice portion is ridiculously small\\n- slower service compared to old location\\n- using too much water on the grill diluted all the sauce flavors and you are left with a bland tasting bowl.\\n\\nThe sauces are varied and seem to have the same selection, if not a little more, but other than that it was not as good value as the old location for a meal as the portion size was smaller overall. I was sure to put on lots of spicy sauces but after the chef slathered the grill in buckets of water, the bowl came out tasting extremely bland and forgettable (this was never the case at old location).\\n\\nThe staff in general seemed disinterested in making dining at the restaurant a pleasant experience; if anything, they were only there to seat you at the table and give you your bill/take payment... no friendly smiles or chit chat, nothing of the sort.\\n\\nAlso, the chef took his sweet time doing things in the kitchen while there was a queue of people waiting with their bowls to be cooked, while rest of restaurant staff made little to no attempt to get him to hurry up. As paying customers, we were all waiting around like patients in a doctor's office, waiting for the chef to come out to fire up the grill and cook our bowls. It was very frustrating as he was going on his own schedule instead of treating paying customers as a priority, and people were getting impatient waiting for him to come out of the back and cook the food. My suggestion to management is, when there are people waiting to eat, pls have chef treat them as a priority.\\n\\nThe all you can eat special may be worth it since you can eat as much as possible in 1.5 hours but as a standalone bowl for just over $9.00, I wasn't impressed... especially as I know what the old Davie St. location offered and tasted like.  \\n\\nI'll have to try the other locations around town to see how they compare, but for now will not go back."},{"name":"SanSai Japanese Grill","address":"539 NW 21st Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Service was terrible.

I've managed to find it alone by driving in circles and swearing at myself in the mirror a few times. That being said if you are smart enough to just cab it from Downtown you can be there in 10 minutes.\\n\\nSecond, the place looked for years like it probably had for years before that - which I kind of liked it made it feel really old school. Now, very recently in fact it has gotten a little more North End. My favorite part here is that to go the hopper you have to pass through the kitchen and you can see the whole family slaving away in there - pretty cool (and a tight squeeze).\\n\\nThird, the food - it has not disappointed me to date though the price has gone up significantly in the last year or so. Rino's antipasto is a staple, huge serving good for 3 or more people. The pasta is fresh, the seafood almost always awesome and Rino insists on always having a fresh line up of authentic ever changing Italian specialties on the menu - this is what you should really try out. I'm a little jilted on the prices b/c the place was always such a bargain but I am sure their rent is through the roof these days so it is almost forgiven and it is still not as pricey as the North End.\\n\\nFourth, the wine - they have a nice rounded Italian wine list that is rarely overpriced. I can usually find a few favorites, which for me is a little tough because almost everything on a wine list gives me heart burn so I am really, really particular.\\n\\nOverall, a spot worthy of being a eating haunt BUT a few inconsistencies in pricing and menu availability over the years have left me slightly jaded.

I really did. Let me explain - I was there with a big group (40+). Because we had so many people, the menu was pre-selected for us. The tables were sat 4 to a table, and over the course of two hours each table of four split 15 small plates. After reading all the reviews and looking at the menu, I was pumped about eating here.\\n\\nLong story short - only a handful of the items were delicious (the pork cheek, the cornbread fritters, and the kimchi cakes). Those three things were to die for. I HATE raisins but the corn fritters with the rum raisin butter were so damn good I could have eaten my weight in them. \\n\\nOtherwise, the other 12 plates were simply \\"eh\\" or disgusting. Particularly, the fried cauliflower was awful - so disgusting. The flavor profile was wrong; so off putting. So many things were grossly under seasoned (the shrimp dish and the asparagus and mushrooms). Then, so many things seemed overthought. The goat and fig ragu dish was okay - the goat itself was great, but the combo of fig and sun dried tomato as a ragu simply failed as a flavor profile. Same with the panicotta dessert - the combo of curry, powdered peanut butter and panicotta was awful. \\n\\nI'm not from Austin, but when I'm back I'd certainly never eat here again."},{"name":"Highland Kitchen","address":"150 Highland Ave","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"What can I say?

You can hang with the locals at cafeteria style tables, drink at the bar, sit at some pub tables, branch off to the pool table area, play some pinball in what feels like someone's basement or even take in a concert (they have a decent stage/dance floor!).

Their two chalk board feature menus of breads, cheeses, and mains change and rotate daily so your experience is sure to never be the same. I definitely recommend any of the bread slices topped with p√¢t√© or meat spreads.\\n\\nWe were told the grilled octopus (with fingerling potatoes, chermoula, fennel, and arugula salad) was a must try and its flavourful combination did not disappoint as a mishmash of diverse flavours.\\n\\nI greatly enjoyed the composition and combination of tastes in the cassoulet duck confit (with house made Toulouse sausage, crispy pork belly, and braised beans) full of contrasting meat tastes as a hearty, filling main served as a slow-cooked casserole.\\n\\nThe staple of steak frites (with hanger steak with peppercorn sauce and caf√© de Paris butter) was a superbly cooked highlight, done just right. As for seafood, the ling cod (with chowder, mussels, clams, and brandade croquette) was a delightful sm√∂rg√•sbord of flavours. The beef cheek bourguignon was well prepared, but not as intriguing or mighty in taste as the other plats principaux.

The salt was not fully removed - rookie mistake of not soaking the saltfish long enough to remove the salt; I would not expect this at a Jamaican restaurant.  Saltfish is called so because it is preserved in salt, not because it is salty.  This meal was so salty, I was drinking water for hours after.  I could not say anything about the quality of any of the other ingredients or the Ackee because it was overpowered by salt.

Keep up the great work! \\n\\nWhen you enter as a new patron, you sign a one time waiver agreeing to abide by the cat etiquette etc. Walk Ins are welcomed, but to avoid waiting, they recommend making a reservation, as the room allows a limited amount of guests at a time. It costs $10 per hour for adults to play with the cats. The owner kindly offered a cute \\"Purrk\\" reward card as an incentive to visit 8 times to get the 9th one free. If you check the website, they sometimes offer nice deals and events going on such as happy hours, cat yoga, or 2 for 1s. \\n\\nFood and beverage items are available for purchase at the front entrance.

They also display a side section for shopping, featuring cute souvenirs such as cat themed mugs, apparel, and even cat wine (Catbernet, Pino Meow) from Shark Tank!

There are some cool looking cat trees for the cats to bounce around, and a plethora of toys to use to interact with the felines. The cats wear color coded tags on their collars indicating their personalities as to how to interact with them. Some are super friendly and you can pick them up and cuddle with them. Some others may be new arrivals and are still warming up to their new environment, so it'd be better to just pet them or use kitty toys to play with them.\\n\\nWhen you visit, don't forget to check out the wall of fame. Your heart will swell with joy when you see the profile pictures of all the cats that have found their forever homes so far! So touching and inspiring! If you are looking to adopt a kitty cat, coming here is a great way to become acquainted with your future fur-baby! \\n\\nAs a side note, the benefits of adopting mature cats are they will be much more chill, less maintenance, and won't swat at everything like a hyper curious kitten would."},{"name":"Phil's Icehouse","address":"13265 US Hwy 183 N","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Family friendly environment with knowledgeable and helpful staff. \\nAte here with friends and we all enjoyed the thick, sweet buns.

During the summer, outdoor seating is available (even though the shoppes of Derby do block the sun out).  I love their steamers, and I enjoy their fish tacos (with the sauce on the side).

The restaurant is very cute and has an intimate vibe to it, perfect for small gatherings or casual dates. \\n\\nCalamari was cooked to perfection. the breading was light, the rings tender, BUT it lacked seasoning. The caper sauce that accompanied was a bit thick and made it nearly impossible to dip, you basically had to spread it on each ring. C for flavor, A for execution. \\n\\nTortelle de Melle had a wonderful flavor, very robust yet light; perfect for early fall. The raviolis were not quite al dente, but i could tell that if the doneness was there, it would have been a perfectly crafted dish. So A+ for flavor, B- for execution. \\n\\nChicken Cannelloni were perfect. I only shared a bite of the dish, but the bite I took was one to remember. The dish comes with three chicken and spinach filed crepes. Crepes were tender and topped with an incredible cream sauce and a marinara? both sauce full of body and flavor.

Therefore, it shouldn't be a surprise that some of the other plates you can order here include things such as marinated manchego cheese, duck liver terrine, pig tails, and Sea Island red pea cocido (Spanish stew).  Opened in 2008 in East Atlanta Village, Holy Taco has that modern, farm-friendly feel, but still has a casual and relaxing atmosphere for taco-grabbing.\\n\\nMost, if not all, of the ingredients are locally sourced.  My favorite items to order are the guacamole and the beef tongue and chicken hearts tacos.  The guac is fresh, chunky, and well-rounded.  I love it.  Holy Taco's chips are big and thick.  Several people are not fans of them and I can see why.  It's almost like they're double-layered tortillas.  Greasy and heavy - if you pound them away, it can catch up to you.  The guac is worth it, though.\\n\\nThe roasted beef tongue taco comes with tomato cucumber salsa and cilantro.  It's a juicy and savory taco, and every bite is delicious.  The cilantro on top isn't the standard cilantro you're used to.  Instead, Holy Taco uses cilantro sprouts (a lighter, more fluffy version).  The pieces of tongue are quite hearty.\\n\\nThe chicken hearts taco is unique.  The chicken hearts are fried and there are a handful in each taco, along with pickled shallots and diced arbol chilis (Mexican chili peppers).  The hearts don't have too much flavor and are a little bit chewy.  If anything, their flavor and consistency most resembles liver.  To make up for it, the tacos are loaded with sour and spice from the shallots and chilis, respectively.  If you add hot sauce, this taco can really bring the heat.\\n\\nThe young goat taco is also pretty good (and popular).  I'd steer away from the slow-cooked grass-fed beef brisket taco.  The meat is too chewy for my tastes and overall, it seems like a plain and boring taco.\\n\\nAll of the tacos come on a single layer of either corn or flour tortilla (your choice).  They're beautifully presented, but can be messy to eat.  Be prepared for a lot of juices to come spilling out onto your plate when you take your first bite.\\n\\nIn addition to the foods already listed, you can also get tortas and bocatas (Mexican sandwiches), quesadillas, and desserts such as churros (Mexican doughnuts).\\n\\nHoly Taco has an enormous outdoor patio facing Glenwood.  The restaurant has an open and contemporary design.  There's a bar inside along with some cool artwork on the walls.\\n\\nThe staff are all quite friendly and service is usually efficient.  Parking is plentiful in their free lot in the back.\\n\\nIf you happen to be at Holy Taco between 5-7pm, tapas are 2-for-1.  Also, if you're interested in trying One Eared Stag, see if your Holy Taco receipt is good for 20% off your total bill at One Eared Stag (a great deal)."},{"name":"Istanbul'lu","address":"237 Holland St","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"Very fresh and tasty.

I thought this place was okay, factoring the time we waited, taste, price, and service.  There was plenty of parking up in front.  On the weekend, the place we parked was for free.  Unfortunately though, when we got to the restaurant, the waitress told us that the wait time was 45 min to an hour.  We decided to drive down the street to get some Mean Poutine first as an appetizer and then come back.  We came back after an hour and then the waitress told us that it would be another 30 minutes.  We probably waited a total of 1.5 to 2 hours.  I think that is a ridiculous wait time.  There were people who had finished and were sitting there.  I'm not suggesting that the restaurant staff be rude and kick them out but there are more efficient ways to encourage your guests to leave.  They could have given the customers the check or asked if there was anything else they wanted to order.  I think they could have done a better job in moving things along, especially since you have a line of people waiting to eat.\\n\\nSince they didn't have any tables to seat four, we decided to opt for the two person table and bring two chairs in.  The restaurant is already cramped in itself.  It felt even more uncomfortable to be crammed in that little booth.  I think this took away from the pleasurable eating experience that we could have had, along with the 1.5-2 hr. wait time.  \\n\\nThe waitress was pretty nice.  She made her recommendations and patently waited to take our orders.\\n\\nWe got the oysters, steak tar tar, steak and fries, and pasta with chantrelle (sp) mushrooms.  The oysters were okay but some tasted more sea-foody than others.  I think it is because of the way they cooked it.  Some were more cooked than others.  I didn't try to steak tar tar so I can't comment.  The steak and fries were the highlight of our food experience.  I don't know what they did but the steak was moist and flavorful.  Each bite was filled with full savory flavors.  I was blown away by how good the steak was.  The pasta with chantrelle mushrooms were okay.

Actually had them bring more bread as i couldn't stop the sop!\\nMy dining partner ordered the filet mignon with crab,  mac and cheese, and the sweet potato spoon bread. My nibbles of each of those items were tremendous.\\nThe one item I ordered that was okay was the red beans and rice. I can't say it was horrible, but really nothing special probably because the incredible flavor palette of the rest of the meal. I just mentioned this in passing to my server who not only deducted the item from our bill, but treated us to a complimentary panna cotta which a delightfully velvety end to our meal.\\nRoom is loud, and can be cramped when hipsters shove their infant seats in amongst the bar seating, but not the restaurants fault.\\nYou could be thriftier, but eating well with a couple hand crafted cocktails will run you $50pp"},{"name":"Easy Tiger","address":"709 E 6th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Awesome patio to hangout on when the weather is nice.

It's something they emphasize which is important to establish early on since not everyone is used to dining in this way. The hard thing for us was picking out only a few things to try!

Excellent preparation, generous portion, and a great sauce that included spicy peppers, rather than the customary marinara or cocktail sauce.  For entrees, my wife ordered veal with eggplant; I chose calamari marinara.  Both were very good.  No disappointments.  Some things to note, though.  My entree was a pasta dish; my wife's entree included a side of pasta.  My pasta was homemade; my wife's was not.  Also, the red sauce is good but its more a tomato sauce than a marinara, which is my preference.  Neither is better; its all about one's \\"gravy\\" preference.

I must say I definitely favor the T&A location both for their menu offerings and price points on multiple menu items. One example I can give us the Radicchio Salad. It's one dollar more expensive for a small at T&S, but is lacking the lardons and egg found on the T&A version.

I can see this in some of the other reviews, but to each their own.\\n\\nI come here nearly every weekend. Always find myself satisfied. This place specializes in Texas-style barbecue, so if you're expecting stuff simmering in a sweet sauce, this isn't going to live up to your expectations. Naturally, the focus is going to be on brisket.\\n\\nI always go between the Texas Destroyer (brisket smothered in provolone, onion rings, and jalapenos), Longhorn (brisket and smoked sausage w/ provolone, onion rings, and relish), Messy Pig (pulled pork between two layers of slaw), and the Smokehouse Sliders (you pick 3 meats). All of them are always good. I'm also really surprised every time by how good the pulled chicken is on the sliders!\\n\\nFrom the sides, I have to give a special mention to the bread pudding. They have a \\"crispy cream\\" on Mon/Wed/Fri and a bananas foster on Tues/Thurs/Sat. Always one of my favorites - you're getting a dessert as a regular side! The \\"crispy cream\\" is a bit sweeter, and the bananas foster is more savory, but the caramelized part on the bottom is always great!\\n\\nThe only negative I have to give is that some of the sides are not as good as others. I feel the green beans need just a little kick in them, the mac and cheese is a bit underwhelming, and the potato salad is also a little bland. The fries are crinkle cut, so nothing special there. Most of the other sides, though, are really great.\\n\\nThe staff here is always friendly and give great consistent service.

I like that I can walk there from my apartment in 10 minutes, 15 in heels.  I like that the space is dim and warm and cozy.  I like that they are generous with the bread and butter.  I like that the staff are quick to refill the water glasses, and that no one seemed to have a problem with me drinking a beer and a caipirinha at the same time.  I like that they let us substitute chili cheese fries for the regular ones that came with the Cuban Reuben, and then didn't even charge us for them (I'm sure that was an oversight, but still).  I like that the menu is eclectic without being schizophrenic, and cheap.  And I love the jukebox.  \\n\\nI didn't love the multiple crying children, or the guy who hovered next to our table with his butt inappropriately close to our food, but that's not the restaurant's fault.

The food showed up almost immediately.  The vibe of the place is extremely positive and genuine.  It's loud, but you don't have to yell for your date to hear you.  And do not fear breaking out of your comfort zone and trying one of their specialty drinks.  No regrets there. \\nBasically, you can't go wrong eating here.  Dine with friends or family.  Perfect for that special date.  I walked away thinking that even their web site didn't do them enough justice.

I did call them however, to see if I could get on the 6pm waiting list and was happy to get a call back on Friday letting me know that would work and that we would be sitting at the Chef's Table (which means on stools at the big butcher block where they plate all the food - a bird's eye view of the work in progress).  The other seating options are communal tables, one large table that holds about 14 people and a smaller one that seats 8. We were excited about the Chef's Table. Sadly, they had a miscommunication between their Friday and Saturday staff and when we arrived on Saturday night someone else had been seated at the Chef's Table and, well, oops! Not a great start. But it turned into a good thing when we sat down at the smaller communal table and wound up with 6 fun and fabulous strangers who helped make the meal memorable.\\n\\nI'm an \\"up for anything\\" eater and I thoroughly enjoyed the variety and flavors of the 6 course dinner. The soup (curried carrot veloute) arrived still steaming hot (so rare), the charcuterie plate was fun and exciting, everyone at the table had a good time sampling all the different flavor bites. My lamb was perfect and also arrived hot and juicy. Ahhh...the salad...such a simple course and so wonderful. The cheese plate and the dessert (ginger cake with a brulee banana and banana ice-cream) were both delicious. I did the wine flight that goes with the meal and was so glad of that decision.\\n\\nGood food, good wine, genial company. There's not much more I need for a wonderful dining experience (maybe a more comfortable chair?). I would give 4 1/2 stars, but since I can't I'm rounding up to 5.\\n\\nI will add this however; I think your enjoyment of Beast (or lack thereof) may have a lot to do with the company you are in.

For our plates we ordered the apple and arugula salad, brussel sprouts, smoked trout, Lockhart quail, and beef cheeks. The trout and beef cheeks were standouts, but the others rather unremarkable. The beef was super tender yet not too fatty, and the combination of mustard, fig, and beef spread on buttered toast was pretty amazing. Unfortunately, we were too full by the time this dish came out to clean the plate.  If you've kept count, two of us split 5 plates and 1 \\"bar snack.\\"  Four plates would've been plenty for us. \\n\\nThe ambiance was pretty cool - dark, exposed brick, industrial, and I liked the Outkast they were playing.

Everyone (I did not imbibe) kept talking about the drink special.

Having grown up in Kansas City, I suppose I'm a bit particular about brisket. Here, it is sliced thicker than in KC, as I believe is done in Texas establishments. My slices were from a thin piece of the brisket, which meant they were well smoked and redolent of oak. They were generously coated with the rub, which had turned into a wonderful, salty bark. Honestly, while I wrapped some pieces in the tortillas and lightly dipped them in the sauce, I ate most of it without sauce. It was just too good to cover up!\\n\\nThat said, the sauce also is excellent. I had the hot sauce, which has a nice spiciness and a good tang to it.

He's a regular, and came over and sat with me while his order was prepared.  My server let him know when it was ready, but did not rush him as we were chatting.\\n\\nWhen my ravioli came out, I just had to take a picture.  The serving was huge!  I also found pieces of lobster meat in the sauce.  I can believe a whole lobster was used in this portion!  The ravioli melts in your mouth.  It is rich, but the flavors meld so well, it was like tasting part of heaven.  The pasta is homemade, the cheese and lobster filling is not heavy at all, and the sauce ties it all up nicely.  The bread served with the meal would be excellent to clean up any remaining sauce.  I took some of it back to my hotel for that purpose.\\n\\nMy takeout order was brought out just when I was satisfied with my meal.  My server dished up my leftovers.  I did not feel rushed at all with the bill.  By this time, the dinner rush was starting.  I was impressed how every single person who came through the door was treated by all of the staff.

I had never heard of it but went along despite my hesitation after seeing the prices and some of the reviews here. \\n\\nI arrived first and was immediately surprised by the size of the room. It's huge, and has a pretty chill vibe with lots of interesting light fixtures, and d√©cor. When I approached the hostess station however, I was barely greeted and found the hostess to be as far from warm and welcoming as one could be in a position as hers. I mean, the hostess is the first person a customer interacts with when they enter a restaurant. It sets the tone for your dining experience so I don't think it's asking a lot to be greeted by a smile and a friendly, welcoming attitude. When my friend arrived, we were seated immediately. (Our reservation was for Sunday at 5p when they open for dinner). After checking out the menu again, I opted to go the less expensive route and ordered an appetizer. I was just too hesitant to take a chance on spending my money on what I believed to be an overpriced dinner. (I mean, $20+ for a bowl of quinoa with veggies? A \\"big dinner\\" salad for $24+?) So I ordered the pulled lamb nachos. Not a typical dinner but definitely a cost-effective and safe one. Now maybe it's because my friend ordered the duck (not likely), but we ended up waiting 45+ minutes for our meal to be served. This, at a little after 5pm, on a Sunday, with only about 20 other customers (all seated in the bar area) in a restaurant that has a capacity of 360. I can only imagine how long the wait for food is when they're actually in peak dinner hours and the tables are all full. The waitress we had was friendly (but perhaps a little too familiar addressing my friend and I as \\"sweetie\\"), but was missing in action for most of the time we waited for our food. \\n\\nWhen our food finally arrived I had to laugh because the food runner made a point to warn me that the plate was hot (he used towels to carry it over), but when I touch-tested my plate it was lukewarm at best, as were my nachos (melted cheese had already started to harden, and the sprigs of cilantro used for garnish were pathetically limp and wilted. Couldn't you at least thrown a fresh sprig on there?). Since I didn't feel like waiting another 45 minutes for them to be reheated, I opted to just eat them as is. Overall, they were a pretty good value at $12 as there was a good amount of pulled lamb and cheese, but why they chose to dump the apple salsa *on top* of the nachos vs off to the side is beyond me as they made the cheese and some of the chips soggy. (It was also less of a salsa and more of a cole-slaw type salad. There was some type of shredded lettuce or cabbage or fennel or something that made up most of the \\"salsa\\" along with the diced apples. There was also too much oregano in it for my taste, but I digress...). In addition, the chips themselves (especially the bottom layer) were greasy, greasy, greasy. Like small-pool-of-oil-forming-in-the-center-of-every-chip greasy. I can't speak to my friends' meal (seared duck breast, red velvet cake) but she seemed to enjoy it. (The red velvet cake looked good and was a large slice, but $8 for a slice of cake?) \\n\\nSo needless to say, it's unlikely I'll be going back. There are just too many other great restaurants in Cambridge where I'm guaranteed a great meal at a good value and where I don't have to wait 45 minutes for lukewarm nachos.

Let me start by saying that parking is convenient and free. The build out inside the restaurant is beautiful. High ceilings, exposed beams, industrial furniture, bright open kitchen. That's all great. The food, not so much. I really wanted to like this place! Their menu on paper is mouth watering, progressive and full of intrigue. Our experience was none of those things.  \\nOysters- over priced, small, dried up and flavorless (that is not so much the restaurants fault, oysters differ in size and flavor depending on where they are from) but 3 out of 6 of my oysters had sand in them. The mignonette was over powering and the cocktail sauce was too sweet and had very little horseradish.  \\nThe bruschetta with red pepper, prosciutto and aioli- an over priced, charred piece of toast with peppers that tasted as if they came out of a jar and were slathered in mayo. Hardly noticed the prosciutto because it was cooked until crispy and sprinkled on top. Strange. \\nLamb with white bean pur√©e- had potential but was way over seasoned and served at room temperature. \\nThe salmon \\"poke\\" tacos- I feel indifferent about this dish.\\nThe duck confit- excellent! Cooked to perfection and served on a bed of tasty sweet potato and turnip home fries. \\nThe shrooms on toast- an unexpected star. Creamy brandy sauce, sausage and thyme create an upscale version of S.O.S. \\nMy husband's cocktail the \\"WTF\\" had entirely too much bitters added to it. \\nThe service was good, although it was early and the restaurant was empty, so I can't say what it would be like during peak hours.  \\nAnd if my review seems harsh or as if I am price sensitive I apologize, I am neither. I was mislead to this restaurant by reviews and self proclaimed \\"foodies\\", and after spending over $100 on dinner for two I expect to leave feeling at least, satisfied.."},{"name":"Tasty n Sons","address":"3808 N Williams Ave, Ste C, Hub Building","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Delicious brunch!

First of all I should state that I think all restaurants tend to oversalt but this was over the top.

Honestly, I wasn't expecting them to take anything off the bill but it would have been nice if they had offered something like the desert free of charge or maybe the appetizer but NOTHING!!! On top of that the waiter was checking in way too much. He was very nice and I realize that he was just being friendly but it was a bit over the top. Someone did come over to apologize about the food but, once again, never offered to take anything off the bill or offer even a cup of coffee free of charge. She did say that in the future I should let them know if I don't like something and they will replace it but at that point it was very crowded and I didn't want to wait another 20 minutes after having already waited to get my scallops properly cooked. \\n\\nI don't like to give this place a bad review because it has a great feel and normally the food is good but I was really put off by their lack of professionalism on this occasion.

I'm aware of how their kitchen works and that items are meant to be enjoyed as presented on the menu. I get it. However, RP has always been considerate of any dietary constraints when I've dined there over the years. \\n\\nThat all said, I dined at Cask & Lader for Brunch with a friend and knew going in that my options were very limited as a non meat eater. (I eat eggs, dairy, fish, seafood) So I'm happy to order sides and work around that issue, it's my eating preference not theirs. I asked if I could order an egg on the side, so I could enjoy a protein instead of carbing it out with the bakery board, pancakes or just removing the meat and having boring eggs and toast, which I could have anywhere. Sadly, no, I could not. I was told that their kitchen preps based on entrees and sides, no modifications. I could, however, order the eggs and toast entree and remove the meat....which, I'll point out still messed up the entree prep count as it left extra meat. Maybe having a few extra eggs around during Brunch service, could be workable in the future? Or adding a Fried green tomato egg Benedict, or a crab Benedict or crab and eggs. Or some kind of cool eggs without meat?  A gal can hope. \\n\\nSimilar problem was encountered when my friend wanted their amazing biscuits, which she eventually did get, but was delivered no butter, or jam or honey...OK.  All of the food we ordered was amazing, the stuffed pumpkin blossoms were light and delicious, great side but not at all filling. The Bloody Mary's are hands down, the best Bloody Mary's in Central FL right now. The mix is a great balance of savory flavor, spices and pepper. Though there is house made pepper vodka in the drink, it's not the primary flavor of the drink. I usually like my Bloody Mary's hot and spicy, but the Cask & Lader seasoning was so nice I was happily enjoying my savory beverage without my usual kick. They do come with a skewer with veg, cheese and a sausage, which was easily left off for this non meat eater. Glad I asked. Cappucino's were perfect and all of the entrees around us looked fabulous and were enjoyed by diners. Service was spot on, though uncomfortable at times since we were (apparently) a problem table. \\n\\nSo, why 4 stars and not lower, you may be wondering? I'm conditioned to a point. It's like going to steak house and being disappointing that you aren't getting a great veg plate. I knew what I was in for and that the dinner menu had more complete meal options for me. Each item we tasted was delicious, service was good and the ambiance was nice. Lovely space and a great place to enjoy a meal or tasty beverage. I was going to hold off writing a review until I had dined here at dinner, but after thinking on it, I decided to go ahead and write this brunch up...in hopes that maybe an egg (creative or not) will be available for me in the near future."},{"name":"Cantina La Mexicana","address":"247 Washington St","city":"Somerville","stars":"3.5","text":"I had a fantastic experience at Cantina La Mexicana.

Yes, a $10 drink can break a bank, especially when it's so good you want another, but it's worth service with a smile.

Like many yelpers, I bought the Rue La La deal ($20 for a three course tasting menu for two) to try this restaurant out. After my experience, I have to say that $20 was pretty much what the three course dinner for two was worth (if that). \\n\\nLet's start with the good stuff though. The place is actually very cool. I loved the set-up of the restaurant and the bar and appreciated the minimalist trendy/French bistro decor. I think it'd be a great spot to come for a drink at the bar before going out to a play or something. Likewise, the service was wonderful. From the time we walked in, the staff were so polite and pleasant. They never made us feel inferior for using the cheap-o Rue La La deal. Our waiter, James, was incredibly sweet and accommodating and even took it upon himself to bring me a different beverage when the first one I ordered was too nasty to drink (I didn't say anything or send it back myself, he took the initiative to find out why I wasn't drinking the \\"Raspberry Rouge\\" and to bring me something different). The atmosphere of the restaurant was very comfortable and enjoyable. \\n\\nThe bad stuff, unfortunately, was the food. It wasn't inedible, but it was completely lacking skill, flavor, texture... you get the idea. The only flavors present throughout the appetizer/entree courses were \\"Butter\\" and \\"Salt\\". It was very similar to dining at the 99 (my dinner companion equated it with TGI Fridays, but I've actually had better experiences at TGIF...). We had the mussels and onion soup to start (BUTTER and SALT, respectively) and the veal and salmon for entrees (FRIED and ZEROFLAVOR, respectively). Even the green beans/carrots on the plate were overcooked mush, drenched in salt and butter. The sorbet and chocolate mousse for dessert were actually decent, although I think the glass was warm when they put the mousse into it because although the top of the mousse had that cool, firmer texture, the bottom was warm slop. The sizes of the dishes were definitely fair for the price and should be enough to fill anyone up. \\n\\nOh, and I should follow up on that \\"Raspberry Rouge\\" drink - it tasted overwhelmingly of fake, cough-syrup, sweetness and alcohol. The concept was great (raspberry, basil, etc.) and I have had similar drinks elsewhere that I loved, but this was just nasty. \\n\\nOverall, we regretted wasting calories on this totally lackluster meal.

The multi-course offerings were creative, well prepared, and artfully presented.  We enjoyed everything we tried, and we liked hearing the individual courses described by the wait staff before each course.  If food is the only thing that matters to you (by that I mean you don't care about ambiance, plate presentation, professional service and getting a decent bang for your buck), then I would recommend Beast in a heartbeat.  That being said...\\n\\nMy feeling is that if you're dropping $400 or more for dinner and tip (depending on which of the incredibly overpriced bottles of wine you order), then it's reasonable to expect a \\"fine dining experience.\\"  At least for us, that means nice plateware and cutlery, reidel wine glasses, polite, knowledgeable, nicely attired wait staff, and an intimate setting.  In that regard, Beast falls short across the board.  Instead, you're served dinner at a communal table, from a one size fits all menu (everyone gets the same courses).  Plates, cutlery and glasses are serviceable, but that's the most I can say about them.  Hey, I'm a big fan of the funky presentation you get at a lot of the better Portland restaurants, but not at these prices.  Speaking of prices, let's talk about the wine list. Like the plates, silverware and table setting, it's serviceable.  Expect mostly wines from the NW and California, with a few selections from Europe as well.  It's a decent wine list, but it's not as if you're going to choose from multiple vintages of Lafite, Domaine Romani Conti or Harlan on the menu (in fact, try none).  And given that there's no onsite wine sommelier either, can someone please explain the 3 and half, to 4 times over standard retail mark-up for the wine prices here?  If this was Manhattan or DC, then I'd shrug and figure this just goes with the territory... but not at a small, rustic caf√© restaurant in NE Portland.\\n\\nAs for the service... like everything else, it was serviceable.  Our casually dressed server was pleasant and polite.  Table service otherwise consisted of dropping off everyone's plate in front of them as quickly as possible, so that everyone was served their food prior to the course description narration.  Again, it was fine, but not what we were expecting, given the prices here.   \\n\\nIn the end, we had a nice time here, but I left feeling dissatisfied by the experience.

We finally managed to snag a few seats at the bar and decided just to order there (by this time my date was starving).  \\n\\nOnce seated and eating, we each had about a foot of room in which to operate - on my left was a group of people who all had to put their drinks on the bar and reach for them every 2 minutes.

While I waited, I munched on a couple of free lemon poppy seed scones. Light and delicate, flavors nicely balanced.\\n\\nThe rosti is basically shredded hash browns, shaped using a cylindrical ring mold. Cooked to perfection here. The golden brown, crispy outside contrasted nicely with the soft inside.\\n\\nThe benedict? Yup, score another one for Toast! Beautifully poached eggs...can we cue the porn music for the runny yolk, please? The lightly toasted English muffin produced the crunchy sensation that would send people to their own happy place. Yes, nitrate-free ham is really good ham. The lemon in the hollandaise came at me right away, an excellent meal overall.\\n\\nDid I use hot sauce? Does Wile E. Coyote attempt to catch the Roadrunner?

The gorgonzola on the salads is a fine thing indeed.  Try the bruschetta, with sweet roasted beets, wonderful goat cheese and the delicious surprise of mint.  This is a bruschetta to eat with a fork and knife, not a dainty finger food.  The flat bread is unusual, soft and moist and a bit salty, not crispy like I would have expected, and is a nice change from the usual yeast loaf.  If you can handle the richness, I also recommend the goat cheese ravioli in brown butter (Ravioli di Caprino con Burro di Oliva).  The atmosphere here is casual and Austin hip, waiters in jeans and plenty of tattoos all around, but I have found it to be friendly and not pretentious.  The prices are higher than many restaurants with this type of atmosphere, but when you eat the food you realize the quality is in the ingredients.

The sausage plate was ok.  \\n\\nStill...despite the spitting air conditioning unit and the crappy gin and tonic...I was still mentally in a good place: but time was running out.

Those seeking wines demonstrating malolactic fermentation need not apply.  Those seeking red wines that are full-bodied, dark, soft and round...stay away.\\n\\nBUT!! Then came the main courses. I ordered the duck breast because the chatter on the internet said they prepared a lot of duck.  What was delivered was a nicely presented and plated portion of duck leg and thigh with a few slices of duck breast...a sauce and some roasted onions. The problem was the duck.  While they had thoroughly rendered out all the duck fat (+10 points) they had not crisped the skin or raised the protein's temp above room temp before serving it to me (-50 points).  Cold, limp/rubbery skin duck...not good. \\n\\nMy Dad had the roasted chicken. It was a gorgeous plate to look at...but the chicken was dry and tasteless.

Honestly, it wasn't our first choice - but it turned out to be a Bob Ross kind of 'happy little accident', because we discovered some really great Indian food. \\n\\nFull disclosure: I'm not really a big fan of Indian food. People talk about the spices (and sometimes complain that it's *too* spicy), and I've seen recipes for stuff that requires 20+ separate individual spices and I feel like I really *should* like Indian food. But it's never as good as it seems like it should be.\\n\\nUntil the other night when we walked into Mirchi. The place was empty, but a woman came out and promptly seated us, got us settled in with menus. Let me just cut to the chase: the food was *really, really good*. I had Butter Chicken, my daughter had Goat Curry (I believe it was called \\"Qorma\\" on the menu), my wife had a beef Kabob of some variety. This was accompanied by warm, fresh naan - an order of plain and an order of garlic. \\n\\nWhen we dine as a family, we're not shy about sharing, especially if something is new and good. I had some of everything, and loved every bit of it. I've never had Indian food like this before: it was very spicy and for want of a better word, \\"hearty\\", in a way that I've never previously experienced with Indian food. Honestly, my wife and daughter felt it was a bit *too* spicy - but I loved it a lot. Serving sizes were also 'hearty', and we brought a lot home (where it didn't last long). \\n\\nOf special note: the garlic naan was really excellent. \\n\\nI'm itching to come back to try their buffet.\\n\\nI'd like to give them 4.5 stars: loved the food, the service was decent - it is arguably unfair of me to ding them because we were the only customers in a large, empty restaurant. But frankly, sometimes that can be off-putting.\\n\\nI *really* *really* loved the food here, and I'm going back again soon. Alas ... it pains me to say this, but the location of the restaurant is less than good. It's easy to get there: IH35 to Parmer Ln, go West on Parmer and it's an easy right turn into the parking lot. I'm not into all of that mystical feng shui stuff, but - this place is not far from where I live, and it's apparently been there since last year, and I'd never noticed it until the day before yesterday.

I came here for my birthday on Tuesday with a reservation for 7 at 7pm. We ended up having an extra person come along, and our waitress Fiona quickly had two extra chairs moved to our table so that 8 dudes could sit comfortably in one of the booths in the middle of the restaurant. Four of us to a bench would have been cozy, but the extra chairs at both ends of the table really gave us plenty of room.\\n\\nI arrived a bit later than the most of the group, but it seemed that my group had already told the staff that we were there to celebrate my birthday. 7pm on a rainy Tuesday, the restaurant wasn't particularly busy, but it was good being able to sit down and get quality service right away. Fiona quickly took our drink orders, even though there were a still a few stragglers running behind. As soon as they arrive, she helped them get situated, took their drink order and was off. Soon enough all of our cocktails come out, and to my surprise a large pitcher of their raspberry mint bourbon with house lemonade comes out, courtesy of Southern Kin. Good thing too because it was a delicious concoction, especially in comparison to my bourbon cocktail. The Old Freed ended up being a bit too strong for dinner in my opinion.   \\n\\nThinking we were titans, but in actuality just men, we ordered several appetizers, a bucket of chicken to share with the additional half rack, and entrees for each of us. Fiona did give us some awesome suggestions on what to order though. We were almost defeated with the amount of food ordered. \\n\\nOur appetizers were the Red Neck Nachos and the Hog N'Hooch Biscuits, in addition to the complimentary biscuits that come with dinner. The biscuits are the first to come out, and come with a berry jam and a honey infused spreadable butter. Hot right out of the oven, the biscuits were flakey and steaming. The Red Neck Nachos were also pretty interesting. Unlike regular nachos, Southern Kin elevates the game by replacing the chips with freshly fried pork rinds (pork skin). Airy, light and crunchy, they would have made for a light snack if not for the additional cheese grit dip that came with it. Its a great appetizer to share. However, the real star of the appetizers in my opinion, were the Hog N'Hooch biscuits. A smaller biscuit than the ones served earlier, its split in half, and topped with big portions of cider bourbon glazed pork belly, fried tomato slices and a relish. I felt like it was a well balanced dish. Meaty, but not overly salty or fatty, it had a touch of sweetness from the tomato and some spice from the  chili relish. Its a dish that isn't very sharable among 8 though.\\n\\nThen all the entrees come out at once, our bucket of chicken leading the charge. The fried chicken is good, with crispy skin that is not overly salted, or drenched in oil. They really know how to fry chicken to give it a light crispy crust that you can just tear through with your teeth. However, it was definitely a bit under seasoned, and could have used more salt and spice. I've been spoiled by Korean fried chicken though. The ribs are also fall off the bone succulent, though I think they could have benefited from more sauce or seasoning. They weren't bland by any stretch, but I tend to prefer my food with more of a kick. \\n\\nAdditionally, we order 2 more half rack of the Kansas City Ribs with a side of Mac and Cheese, 2 smother pork chops, 1 shrimp and grits, and a Mississippi Spotted Cat, which came highly recommended to me by Fiona. The smothered pork chops came with a fried egg on top and were pretty good. The ribs seem to be the same that come with the chicken, and the mac and cheese was pretty cheesy and tasty. I only had a bit of this though, choosing to dive into my own entree. The fried fish was well seasoned and crispy and flaky. All things you want in a fried fish dish. It came on a bed of a succotash that was composed of corn and beans. It was a good pairing, although there was more 'tash than fish.\\n\\nWhile eating the chicken though, my friend bit into what he thought was a button. He flagged down Fiona, who told management immediately. They let us know that the button was actually a device they used to let them know the chicken was done. However, for the \\"inconvenience\\" they gave us another half bucket of fried chicken on the house. We didn't really mind though as we were having a great time drinking, sharing great food and swapping stories. Before we knew it, the relatively empty restaurant had filled up.\\n\\nI've been to Southern Kin a time or two in the past, and I've always enjoyed the food. This past visit though really knocked it out of the park though for me.

I've had them and liked them.  But I say when it comes to fried chicken, grease is fine by me.  Fat Matt's fried chicken is very greasy and flavorful like Popeye's, and I love them for it.  It's definitely as good a fried chicken as you can find in a casual place.  I still like Star Provision's slightly more, however.  \\n\\nThough the delicious fried oysters are no longer on the menu, their fried catfish is perfectly good.  It almost feels like it's pan fried, and the texture inside the crust is just buttery, almost melting.  A delicious exercise in minimalist execution.  \\n\\nI am not a fan of their side dishes, most ranging from underwhelming to unappetizing.  When it comes to the atmosphere, for some reason you can feel the aging and tiredness of this place much much more than the rib shack next door.

The restaurant is super cramped. They tried to maximize space where they could, which makes for uncomfortable seating. We were at the long, narrow bar in front of the garage door they roll up during nice weather. It seemed we could knock something off the edge at any moment. Once the table behind us filled up it felt claustrophobic. Our waitress was meh. She greeted us, took our order, brought the food... she did her job and that was about it. The food portions are small and \\"to be shared\\" which somehow translates into Tasty charging you double their worth. Figure that one out. A single cup of black coffee cost THREE F!NG DOLLARS.  If I had thought a $3, only half-filled, never refilled cup of coffee was in the realm of possibility, I wouldn't have ordered it. Shame on me for not checking. A single donut hole sized donut, $2.00. Completely unremarkable Texas toast (gross. It was not billed as Texas toast but that's what it was.), with a literal Tbl. of jam, $5 (!!!!!). The Shakshuka with sausage, $14 and English Breakfast, $10.00. The Shakahuka and EB were truly delicious, but SO overpriced for the portions. Skip the donut and toast. If you are fortunate enough to have deep pockets, then you will love this place. It seems purposefully designed to be liked by the wealthy. I would go back if someone else was paying. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone I liked without prefacing the fact that it's so expensive. I should make clear that when the total experience feels special, valuable and satisfying, I have no problem paying more.

For that price, we could be at Eastern Standard which I rate as a top 3 brunch spot in the Boston area on a Saturday, except there the steak is better and is $9 cheaper.  The eggs are $6 cheaper.

If you are open till 2:15, you are open till 2:15. I know the four of you want to go home. But this is the hospitality business... don't rush folks out the door. Get some staff willing to be and stay energetic until after the last guest leaves. They pay your bills! Why are you so annoyed?\\n2. The florecent lights. I know, I know they are cheap. They look cheap too. And you can see how absolutely filthy everything is. Get some lower lighting in the front area. Which reminds me... when is the last time someone really cleaned the grease trap? Get someone out to do it. Take out the carpet if you can. It will be worth the investment and allow you to compete with your neighboring bars.\\n3. Serve food. Willingly. Have a nighttime menu with something besides cold sandwiches. Better yet! Stay open after 2:15 to serve the crowds exiting the bars. No one else does; corner the market. And I know the guy in the flanel shirts is probably a sweet pea but why does he stand there and stare at customers all night? Home come he can have pizza right in front of me and I can't?

This place is large and despite the long lines I was seated and served promptly.  I ordered their fresh orange juice, the polenta and sausage ragu, and Erin's sweet biscuits!  The portions are small so it's perfect for a small group to order a lot of different dishes and try a little of everything. The sweet biscuits came with three mini biscuits topped with a raspberry reduction cooked with fresh raspberries over the top and whip cream.  Oh man was it delicious!  It will definitely satisfy your sweet tooth! The polenta with sausage ragu is worth more than 5 stars!  It was down right outstanding!  The polenta was smooth, the sauce rich and bold in flavor topped with mozzarella cheese and a fried egg.  The portion of this dish is somewhat big.  This is one you might want to share if you're looking to nibble on a lot of different things.  Overall the food experience was everything I hoped it would be and it was! This place is a sister restaurant to Toro Bravo which is more known for their Spanish style tapas!  Tasty n Sons is best known for their breakfast and brunch while Toro Bravo is known for their dinners. Just a word of advice, keep your group small like under 4.  Make reservations if possible and get here about 20 minutes early as this is a very popular place amongst the locals.  If you need to wait 30 minutes, don't be discouraged because the food is definitely worth the wait!

The hostess had some attitude and was not the least bit customer service oriented.  It left us with a very bad taste in our mouth after enjoying our experience in the bar.  We will give it another try because we enjoyed the bar and the food, but they have a long way to go if this is their idea of customer service from a five star restaurant.\\n\\nMy kids live in NY and Portland, OR and are foodies.  This place would be a great choice for us to take them over the holidays, but I am concerned that they have a little maturing to do before they are ready to step into NY or OR shoes as far as food and service are concerned."},{"name":"Burger 21 - Mall of Millenia","address":"4192 Conroy Rd, Ste 109","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"Stopped here on a Thursday night where they had a special of 2 sliders with a side of fries for 5 bucks.  I decided to give the black and bleu a try with sweet potato fries.  Also, the gingerbread cookie milkshake caught my attention as I was ordering so decided to try it as well.  What I liked about the place is the condiment station with different sauces like Thai ketchup, chipotle mayo, Apple cider, and so on.  The Sweet potato fries with toasted marshmallow sauce was really good together.  My black and bleu slider was just ok, a bit too salty.  The gingerbread milkshake, to my disappointment, didn't wow me and was way too sweet.  However, I ordered the strawberry shortcake milkshake at the end of my meal and that tasted much better.

Their flavors seem to change on a daily basis and are, simply, mind boggling. Their choice of ingredients is literally fearless - recent ice creams I both sampled and wolfed down included ribbons of vietnamese fish sauce infusing caramel, strawberries in balsamic vinegar, and a sorbet featuring hops.  No, I'm not kidding.  Amazing, astounding ice creams and sorbets. The only one I have visited is in the Alberta district of Portland - and is well worth the trip, either from other parts of Portland or other parts of Oregon (I live down near the bottom of the state, close to Ashland) - or anywhere else.

My wife and I frequent this Tijuana Flats and always enjoy our visit.\\n\\nOne thing that I've always been a bit uncomfortable with is with places where you pre-tip.  They have a tip jar at the counter, and if you pay by card, it has a tip line on the receipt.  This isn't a full service restaurant as you do have to queue up and place your order. However, the staff's great service makes tipping worthwhile.  I am visited by staff frequently checking if I need refills and they even clean up the table.  Service is always great and the staff are always friendly.\\n\\nThe food is good too, with our favorite being the Chimichanga with blackened chicken. I keep telling myself that I need to step outside of my comfort zone and order something new, but can never seem to do so.  I have tried their Flautas, tacos and burritos before and they're very good as well, I just like the chimichanga the best for some reason.\\n\\nIf you like hot sauces like we do, then they have a good selection at their hot sauce bar. They also have many bottles that you can buy as well with a wide range of flavors and hotness.  Some of the hotter sauces that you can purchase require a waiver to be signed. \\n\\nMusic is played at a good volume where it adds to the atmosphere, but you can also easily here the people around you.

The meat was cooked well and had a good flavor...when it finally arrived. We waited a good 30 - 40 minutes and by the time we got our steaks, mine was cold. The other two steaks were fine but they were bigger, so I suspect mine was just sitting around waiting for theirs to cook. Sounds like bad coordination.  Given the ridiculously long wait, I decided to accept my steak as-is, since I was pretty hungry by then. \\n\\nOverall not bad. They don't take reservations for parties less than 6 so come on the early side to avoid a long wait."},{"name":"Easy Tiger","address":"709 E 6th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Excellent beer selection and wonderful recommendations from the friendly staff about which one to select.

My wife had a pear salad which was not as plentiful as the sandwich, but extremely good.

The candle lit tables and red walls make the space feel very warm, and ultimately a nice place to enjoy your dinner.\\n\\nTo start, my boyfriend and I shared a salad that was being offered as a special.  It consisted of arugula, spinach, grape tomatoes, and fresh bocconcini.  It was dressed very nicely in a light vinaigrette that was perfect - I have a big pet peeve with salads being over dressed.\\n\\nFor entrees we ordered a baked gnocchi dish, as well as a penne pasta with sliced mushrooms, diced tomatoes, and grilled chicken in a tomato cream sauce.  The preparation on the gnocchi dish was a little simple for my liking, but it was still very tasty.  The penne pasta was excellent, served piping hot and al dente.  \\n\\nWe didn't have dessert as there are numerous gelato options in the area, but the menu had several offerings all made on premises.

There's a back patio and some tables out front, as well as indoor shuffleboard (which is reason enough to go here). My fiends and I may or may not have potentially disturbed everyone with our cheering, but in our defense, we wandered over here one night after a lively evening at the Willow Tree.\\n\\nI've encountered friendly, patient staff and patrons, so no complaints from me on that front.

I didn't even notice I got the wrong order until now, but I'm not mad. I love fries! I didn't know what to expect from the fried steak because I've never had it before.

Their food is reasonably priced standard burger joint fare and totally edible.  Last night I had the Buffalo Burger.  It was flavourful, the chipotle sauce packed punch.  Buffalo is a lean meat so it can tend to be dry but even though the patty wasn't super thick it was fine.  My hubby had a regular burger which he scarfed down without any complaints.  He was very excited about the fact that the fries looked handmade.  I tried one and it was tasty and not too greasy.  Two burgers and four pints came to $35.

I wanted to start this review off by pointing out that, like many, I have eaten at some very good restaurants and some not so good/downright terrible restaurants. This is the first time I have actually been moved to sit down and type a review.\\n\\nDECOR: While the restaurant is long and narrow, at no time did we feel cramped (and we were at a tiny table, up on a little landing, in a corner.) The atmosphere was pleasant and very social.  One review from May 2014 described the place as having an \\"old rich person\\" vibe. I am not sure if the decor has changed in that time, but IMO the decor was beautiful; the combination of exposed brick, black wrought iron and tasteful furnishings/decorations gave it a very warm and elegant feel that was not stuffy or even close to over the top.\\n\\nSERVICE: I was quite surprised to see several reviews mentioning poor or even bad service.  I personally feel customers, in general, are too demanding and expect the world to revolve around them. Yes, we are paying for an experience and deserve excellent, attentive service, but some of the reviews make me feel people are way to hypercritical.\\n\\nI can honestly say our service was excellent. Immediately upon coming in the door we were greeted cheerfully by the hostess and another gentleman I assumed was the manager or owner. It was around 6:45 pm when we arrived and the restaurant was quite full, but our request for a table without a reservation was not met with the same dismissing looks I have received from other area restaurants. Instead, after only a brief moment, we were shown to a table. Within minutes of being seated, in the very full upstairs section, we were greeted by our waiter.  As I previously mentioned, we arrived at around 6:45 and had tickets for an 8 o'clock show (poor planning on my part). I informed our waiter of the time crunch I had left us in and he said he would do everything he could to get us out on time.  Fast forward to the end of the meal...that is exactly what he did! We arrived at the theater approx 2 minutes before the curtain went up and still felt as if we had had a relaxed dinner because of the very efficient, professional service we received!\\n\\nFOOD:  Unlike several other reviews, I cannot comment on the full selection of items available as I did not spend too much time reading the menu (it is available online if you wish to look it over). Also, several comments have been made about the prices, and after looking over the menu briefly I can understand why. What I have not seen mentioned here yet (I didn't read all the reviews) is that 49 Social offers a theater three-course Prix-Fixe menu. I originally believed this to be an offer exclusive to BroadwayInBoston subscribers, but since it is listed on their website it must be available to everyone. For $44 you receive choice of soup or salad, one of four entrees, and choice of two desserts. A glass of either red or white wine is also included in the price. I chose a salad and my niece had the soup of the day, both were delicious. Current entree options include: Oven Roasted Half Chicken, Roasted Salmon, Grilled Hanger Steak and a Vegetarian Pasta; we had the chicken and the steak. My niece was happily surprised to find that the chicken was mostly de-boned, making it much easier to consume and more suitable for finer dining. The only negative thing I can say about our experience was that my steak was seriously under cooked. I ordered it medium, but it was much closer to rare, medium rare on the ends. I have to admit that, due to our time constraints, I did not even attempt to have the error fixed, and to be honest, I didn't even care about how it was cooked. I do NOT like rare meat, but my steak was one of the most tender, flavorful cuts I have had in a long time. There was nothing left on my plate when I was done. For dessert we both had the Nutella Creme Brule. I personally wish it had more Nutella mixed in, but now I'm just splitting hairs...it was delicious.\\n\\nAlthough I believe the word is overused, I would still have to say our meal and whole experience was AMAZING! I'm not sure if I'll have my niece with me again, but I will definitely be back."},{"name":"Muqueca Restaurant","address":"1008 Cambridge St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Sorry to buck the trend, but I had one of the WORST restaurant experiences in years at this place. For starters, the service was terrible.  The waitress FORGOT our order entirely.  We waited for our food for 25 minutes before reminding the waitress that we were in the restaurant.  Thinking that I didn't speak Portuguese (which I *DO*), she admitted to another waitress that she had forgotten to place our order and then, in English, told us that the food was on its way.\\n\\nThe food, when it finally arrived, was a real disappointment.  First, I received the wrong order.  However, by the time it arrived, I was simply too hungry and chagrined to send it back.  The muqueca itself was as BLAND a concoction as any I have tasted. It's muqueca for GRINGOS - gringos who don't eat garlic, dend√™, or onions, apparently. Despite our hunger, we did not finish our food and ended up going to S&S Deli afterwards.\\n\\nThis is definitely NOT a restaurant I would recommend.

He would not let me pay for dinner because he didn't want me to waste my money on something he didn't like. (He paid of course.)\\n\\nThe restaurant is lovely and the staff are all very attentive, professional, and kind. Excellent service. The fresh sourdough bread was terrific. The first dish was wonderful: a ceviche scallop. It was bright and crisp and the sauce on the plate complimented the fish well. We were eager for our next dish. The meal went downhill from there. Each additional course was too rich, \\"brown\\" tasting, and overdone. The squid ink pasta chitarra had a decent taste but was dense and oily. The tomato jam with it was nice. The monkfish was clean tasting but dry and a little over saut√©ed. The bourride that accompanied it was too rich and bland at the same time (no contrast in this dish--think soft scalloped potatoes without the cheese). The grilled tuna had a lot of connective tissue on my husband's dish (was ok on mine) but had little flavor. The spaetzel with it was oily. We declined dessert but the waiter was really trying and brought some sorbet. The flavors were nice, especially the roasted apple, but at this point I would've preferred some steamed broccoli. \\n\\nI chose Mooncusser because my husband was returning from Germany and would appreciate a light meal of fish. We had the tasting menu because we couldn't decide which dish to get. They all sounded great. The meal ended up being very heavy due to the abundance of oil/butter in each dish and lack of fresh vegetable or bright contrast. \\n\\nAgain, this is a beautiful restaurant with lovely, attentive staff.

We waited an hour for a table when we were told it would be 20 minutes.  Ok that happens but when you have 2 children that's a big deal. We told them we didn't want to wait more than 30 minutes as we could have (really should have) walked next door and gone to Maggianos. Anyway we didn't. It took almost an hour from sit down to being served dinner.  Unacceptable. We eat at cheesecake in Pembroke Pines florida and it just as busy as this one and always receive great service and food served in a timely manner. \\nLike I mentioned. Food tasted very good - I had a salmon dish. My wife had fish tacos and she didn't like hers. Family ordered a pasta dish - food, another fish dish - good.

I am not hard to please I love food and I can eat anything. Places with great customer service can make me come again even with the food not being out of this world. I had to rewrite my post due to the experience that led after I wrote it the fist time. I will give an honest review because it's only fair. I use apps like Yelp to find places to eat in areas that I am not familiar with and read others reviews to make a decision. The place is nice the decor goes well and looks like a nice hip place. Their was a line to place your order and that gets me excited because it lets me know this place must be good. The girl at the register very friendly and approachable. After paying for our food my company and I find a table outside. My food came out almost immediately. The waiter then ask if we are still waiting for food and tell her yes. It was quite awkward sitting in front of my company while she is waiting for food and my food is in front me. Time passes and everyone that has sat after us is getting their food. Another waiter which makes eye contact with us because at this point we are just staring at the staff to see if we are noticed. The waiter then asks if we are waiting for food. After replying yes he quickly turns away without saying let me check on that and continues with his thing. After close to 15 minutes a different waiter comes with my friends food. I had to grab her attention before she quickly left to tell her that was not what my friend ordered. She then ask what was wrong takes the plate and again we continue to wait. I am trying to eat my food slowly since she still doesn't have her food and the purpose of going to a restaurant with company is too eat with them. The waiter comes back with a new plate and rushes off, which we noticed that again it was wrong. After this point now I am upset. I work in the service industry and I can say this definitely was not the greatest customer service they can offer. I flagged the owner, which found out he was later, to let him know that this was the second time we received the wrong food. No apologies, takes the plate walks inside and comes back out with the Same plate to bring to another table. This being the same plate my friend touched to check if her food was correct was now sitting on someone else's table. The owner comes back with the correct food, but by this time my friend and I are quite over this place. I stop eating my food because it's cold already waiting for my friend to get her food. My friend eats some of her food. While she is picking at her food i start writing a review. Seems like the owner or someone told the owner I was writing a review that when one of the waiters came to our table to take the plates, the owner comes to our table and ask us if the food was that horrible and to let him know honestly how the food tasted to be given one star. This made me feel uncomfortable since I felt I was put on the spot in front of everyone. The owner asked to give the food another try at home. He left to pack us food to take but we decided to leave. We did not want free food, we would have appreciated more an apology. The experience made everything sour and uncomfortable. The owner kept asking for an honest review on the food and here it goes: presentation was ok, taste was ok. I had the pulled pork and brisket and I feel 4rivers has more flavor. The sweet BBQ sauce was ok. The fried yucca was good, but anything fried can't go bad. The Mexican corn I can not review since I did not even eat it. I am a big foodie and I never take the time to review any place I go. But after our experience I decided to write a review and edit my first one to add more and be more detailed. I never felt so humiliated by a worker yet alone an owner of a restaurant while eating out. To the owner, is about the approach, delivery, and demeanor that makes it or breaks it.

The place looks classy and smells ahmaaazing when you walk in, so I thought it was a good sign.\\nIt kind of went downhill from there.\\nListen to your yelpers, on here. The food is pretty decent, yes. But the length of time to get your food, combined with the weird service and the confusion with the drink menu kind of overwhelmed it. My date and I started with vegetable samosas as we were both hungry, and perused the drink list. The waiter had to come back no less than three times because they only had ONE type of wine that was on their list. In his defense, it was a great Chardonnay and he knocked the price down to 5 a glass, but come on now folks. The wine list is a full page long. You're telling me you don't have any red? And only one type of white available? What is that? \\nSamosas were good, but kind of doughy. The dinner itself was pretty delicious, although the naan is kind of dry. \\nMy main comments are with what is going on with this restaurant, not the food.\\nFood takes forever.\\nService is... weird. I kind of loved our waiter cause he was goofy and clearly was in DGAF mode. He knocked some of our prices down due to the inconvenience factor, and cracked jokes with us most of the night. However, you could hear him and another waitress bickering from our table. There appears to be no management running the place whatsoever. All in all, Pakwan is just kind of weird.\\n\\nIf you want fabulous Indian food with great service, I really recommend Bombay Bistro.

Today, we found ourselves close to the restaurant and thought we'd swing by with our 2 small children to finally try a much anticipated meal. We arrived at 3:30pm and were told to wait outside until the kitchen had the capacity to serve us. They were in the middle of preparing a meal for a charity auction. I understand this, as the restaurant is very small and the line building up outside was getting longer by the minute. However, 45 minutes later, and no answer to when we would be allowed inside, I asked the staff if I could sit inside at one of the many empty tables with my 2 WEEK OLD daughter. The temperature was dropping outside and the wind was picking up. I suggested that my husband and 18 month daughter stay outside and again asked if myself and my infant could come inside-they told me it would be a fire hazard and a safety risk. I do not believe I was asking for anything unreasonable and since the restaurant was empty I thought they could accommodate this request.

Sweet and tender they were consumed immediately. The potato salad was good, but unexpected in that it wasn't a traditional mayor/ mustard type variety but rather tiny, whole potatoes in a light vinaigrette. Very good, and agreeably one of the best things we had. The Nashville hot chicken was also a favorite. A generous portion of chicken, sitting in white bbq sauce-- A lighter sauce than that of the brisket, but equally good. It comes with broccoli mac& cheese and cornbread. While good, the mac and cheese was little bland. The cornbread was not even worth giving attention too--it was both dry and bland. More of a filler than anything. The Hotdog was only okay. While again, the portion size was generous, there wasn't much memorable about it. I only took a few bites before becoming bored with the flavor. \\n\\nThe one item I'd pass on were the brussel spouts, which were basically cooked and then drenched in a thick, molasses arbol chile sauce.

It was good, not amazing. The portion was just right, pricing was good but the burger lacked a \\"wow\\" factor. It had jalapenos, pepperjack and a light smear of guac. Personal preference is that if I order a burger with toppings, I want to taste them. I'm not sure if there wasn't enough guac or the burger was too greasy but it didn't taste very different than a standard ol' burger. Also, I ordered it medium and it was probably closer to well with no pink inside which to me, is the wrong way to eat a hamburger.\\n\\nFries were thin, crispy and fairly standard also. They do have a dipping sauce station with some regular offerings like ranch and (\\"thai\\") ketchup as well as specialty sauces like cajun and a very, very good marshmallow. \\n\\nAll in all, good for a quick bite at lunch time (go early...big line when we left around 12:30!) in the Millennia area but not something I would go out of my way to visit.

Flavor wise, the panini was not enjoyable in the least and the salad was medium alright. Absolutely not worth the money. I was so sad. This place is right by my house and I'll never go back or send people there. My 2 housemates had similar experiences as well. If you want some yummy fresh food try POA just north of this place or Tasty and Sons just south(best Cobb salad this side of Portland) and truly I'd recommend making your own salad at New Seasons. Even if you spend the same amount of money at any of these places, you'll get better quality and much larger portions.

The new owners have taken steps to make BBB a comfortable place to hang out, rather than just the high-energy, high-pressure clurb it has been in years past. I came here with a friend for happy hour, where I was treated like a princess by the hostess, bartender and owner, who stopped at every table at least once to make sure people were enjoying themselves. The happy hour special drinks--$5 cosmos and lemon drop martinis--are strong and tasty. We didn't go there for food, though I did try the crab cheese fritters and basil sea salt fries, which weren't memorable. The owner told me she just added Sunday brunch, with $15 unlimited mimosas, so that might be a good opportunity for me to check out the food.\\n\\nOne major downside to this place is that parking is expensive and hard to come by. I parked on the street, thinking it might save me money, but because I ended up staying an extra hour catching up with my friend, I kept having to go out and feed the meter, which really added up. The Hi-Fi Buys parking lot across the street is the most obvious place to park, though paying $5 to leave your car in a burglar's heaven seems a bit steep.\\n\\nThe music was good girly pop, which added a fun, sexy vibe to the evening, and on the TV screens, they were showing Lady Gaga and Shakira's concert DVDs.

He was right; I have been a server myself, and he did have too many tables for one person to handle on his own, probably a lot for even two people. This seems to be a reoccurring theme at all of their restaurants; McMenamin's management should look at staffing their restaurants more appropriately.\\n\\nThe franchise, chain, mini-corporation, whatever it is, is a great idea, and I love that they are Portland's own.

This plate is dinner-sized; if you are a light lunch eater, you will have leftovers. Delicious leftovers.

The staff are super friendly and answer whatever questions you may have. \\n\\nPerhaps most importantly, though, is the mission and M.O. of this place - it's a nonprofit that focuses on providing work experience and training to previously incarcerated people and helping kids learn about nutrition and cooking from scratch.

The place was virtually empty at peak lunch time with maybe 2 or 3 other customers. One would think that the place will have more people, being close to a bunch of businesses in the area.\\n\\nSocial Vinings, as the name suggests, is a social gathering place of sorts. At least that's what it looks like when you first enter. You walk into a big bar area, but they do have some sit down formal dining areas off to the right and the back. The place does live up to it's desires of being a new \\"hangout\\" in Vinings by having ~6,500 sq ft of room to mingle.\\n\\nI've heard some good things about Chef Paul so I was excited to try his new venture, but the food was mediocre at best. I tried the Spicy Sweet Potato Fries with Bacon and Jalapeno Cheese as my side and the Grilled Salmon Reuben with a side of Slaw for my main dish. The fries were what you expect from regular, thin cut, sweet potato fries but it was not spicy at all, as the name suggested. The cheese didn't really add much to the flavor either, so that was disappointing. It's definitely something I've never tried before, but the novelty quickly faded after a couple bites. The Reuben was mediocre. It tasted exactly like a Reuben would, but the salmon they used was way too fishy. Admittedly, it sounds ironic that salmon should not taste fishy, but this was overboard. I did really like the marble rye bread they used, which was toasted to near perfection. The slaw was interesting to say the least. At first I thought it was thin apple slices in slaw, but then I thought it could be daikon radish, and then I went back to thinking it was apple slices. I'm not really keen on confusing flavors so that was not a winner in my book.\\n\\nMy coworker had the Cappellini Pasta and he was not impressed at all. I'm sure they served lunch portions, but the serving could almost fit on one of his hands. Needless to say, he was not full at all and had to find some food when we got back to the office. Even with such a small portion, he only ate half of it so that tells you how much he liked his dish.\\n\\nThe service was friendly and relatively prompt. I say relatively since we encountered a 2:1 ratio of servers to customers, but they took some time when checking back on our table. I'm sure they're still working out their kinks so hopefully it gets better from here.\\n\\nOverall, it was an OK experience. I was neither amazed nor disappointed.

The Alfredo sauce was also incredible. \\n\\nGetting a bottle of wine there is also totally reasonable in comparison to other restaurants- bottles start at $21 I believe.\\n\\nI see others on here complaining about the wait- we went and put our names on the list for the dinner sitting (and it was a Friday) and she said they'd call 40 minutes later around 4:30 and that we would then have 10 minutes to come back.

So, my friend and I came in here at exactly 10pm on a Friday night. We had about 45 minutes   before we needed to catch the train, so I was pretty confident that a beer each and a small app would fit in that time frame.  It wasn't overly busy, usual couples, and groups of friends, but not too loud. We realized we weren't going to be able to sit at the bar, so we were sat at a high top table and were given menus by the hostess. Both my friend and I decided on the Jacks Abby Lager, and a small dish of bisquets with butter. A girl came to our table and gave my friend a glass of water, not me. She stated that she would be back with mine.  I asked if she was going to be our waitress because we know what we want and she politely said she isn't and would let the girl know to come to our table. About a minute later our waitress comes, takes our order on a tablet and says she'll be back with our beers. A waiter comes with my water. About 5 minutes later our waitress comes back to our table and let's us know that the beers are taking longer than expected  because \\" they are too foamy\\" and bartenders are \\"having an issue with the tap\\". She didn't really seem too confident that this was the real reason our beers were taking longer than expected, but, OK I'll give it a couple minutes. My friend and I noticed that alot (6 or 7) of the waiters and waitresses were standing by the bar area for long periods of time, and generally seemed agitated that the 2 bartenders were slacking or messing up drink orders for their tables. So now, it's about 10:15 and we still have no beers. By 10:20 the bisquets came out and they were delicious, but still no beers. So I see our waitress walk by, I flag her down and ask what the problem is and why we still don't have beers after all this time?? So she tells me that the guys at the bar \\"put the order in wrong originally\\" and \\"only poured one beer instead of 2\\". What does that even mean? If that's the truth, why wasn't the beer that was poured brought to my table with an explanation of the messed up order? This isn't rocket science, or making an elaborate cocktail, its 2 beers!! This isn't adding up, so I tell her to just cancel the order. I don't want the beers anymore, we have to leave shortly and can't wait any longer. First, she said something about it taking longer because of the foam and tap issue, then she tells me that the order was messed up. Which is it? Pick a lie and commit!!  So, this is why I am writing this review, because after I cancelled the order, 2 minutes later another waitress walks to our table and tries to hand me one beer. I told her I cancelled the order, and she walked away with a very confused look.......then, ANOTHER WAITRESS WALKS TO OUR TABLE WITH TWO BEERS!!!! I told her I cancelled the order and that was that. I never got loud or obnoxious or snoby, just kept calm and cancelled the order. 3 times. After I cancelled the order the first time with our original waitress, my friend grabbed the manager guy and explained how we had been in there for at least a half hour and the issue with the beers pretty much disqualified them from getting any money for the delicious bisquets. He agreed, said we were all set and then OFFERED US A DRINK!!!! We declined lol. After our conversation with the manager we get 3 beers brought to our table promptly, that we didn't have time to drink. What is wrong with this place? Train your staff, train your bartenders, or get people that can handle more volume than just those seated at the bar. Have some communication between each other, so a table of 2,  that places the easiest order in the world, isnt leaving your restaurant with no reason to ever come back. I will add, that all of the waitresses that approched my table were nice and the original waitress apologized as we got up to go. As I stated things never got loud or mean or anything, but I could tell even they knew how unorganized the restaurant is and unfortunately, I won't be back to see if things ever change."},{"name":"Los Comales Mexican Restaurant","address":"2136 E 7th St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Average, at best.

There's no way this is a one star brewery. Four or five stars, here's my honest review:\\n\\nIt is crazy to me how many people try to dismiss this beer as bad. Then again, pop country is making a ton of money, and plenty of people think Dickey's BBQ is good. I can understand if you don't particularly like Jester King's beer, but you have to at least be able to see the merit it deserves. It's quality beer, no questions asked. I say that as a person who can drink a Coors Light or a Stone IPA and enjoy either depending on the day. I'm not a snob, by any means, but I do appreciate quality. If Jester King isn't your style and you prefer not to drink it, that's fine, but if you think Jester King is bad, you're simply wrong.\\n\\nI think this is a great brewery to have a beer at and relax. It has to be the most beautiful brewery setting in the Austin area, and definitely worth the trip if you're a beer lover. If you just want to go to any old brewery, it might not be worth the trip for you. The only real complaint I had was in going on the tour. They talk pretty snobbishly about their beer, and I'm not really into that. I guess I just don't get why they get so much buzz. That being said, I'm not a professional beer taster, nor do I know what goes into brewing a quality beer. I like it, yes, but I'm not willing to buy it at the grocery store for the price I can get a quality IPA or even a Belgian (not style) beer.\\n\\nTo sum things up: if you only drink Bud Light, you will HATE this place. Also, if you only drink Bud Light, you're a quitter. You should branch out. At least give Blue Moon a shot. It's not great, but at least it has some flavor. If you like beer and have semi-adventurous taste buds, I think this is a good spot.

Since I was alone, I ordered a two slices and a glass of red wine.  The wine was forgettable, but the pizza was astonishing.  \\n\\nHot, crusty, thin, chewy, with a taste of yeast and charred in all the right places, this pizza dough was astonishingly good.  The tomato sauce was fresh, with a slight spicy sweetness that was very appealing.  The cheese was of excellent quality and on the way to my table the waiter pulled off several basil leaves from the plants to scatter on top of my slices. Red pepper flakes had put me in pizza nirvana.  I lived in New York for nearly 40 years, and I seldom ate pizza as good as this.  The crust may be the best I've ever eaten.  Was this a fluke?  Did I stumble across an uncelebrated and secret place that nobody knew about?  \\n\\nThe following week, I invited two friends to join me.  I wanted to sample a whole pie, just to be sure.  We ordered the Pizza Margherita.    \\nIt arrived, hot and fragrant, and with the first bite, I knew I had managed to find a great pizza.  John's pizza maker was a genius.  Whoever created the formula for the crust (alas, a closely guarded secret), the sauce, decided on the oven temperature, all contributed to the pizza chef's final achievement.  My friends were equally enthusiastic.  A few weeks later, I was lone in the garden when two guys walked in, and we picked up a conversation.  I just knew he was from back east, and as it turned out, he is from New Jersey, another area of the country that takes its pizza very seriously.  He had been coming to the Gladstone since he moved into the neighborhood and agreed with me that it was outstanding.  His invited me to join them and some time later, his fiance arrived.  It was a very pleasant evening   because the pizza is so good!\\n\\nI've since been back to Gladstone Coffee for their very special pizza many times, always bringing friends, and family and everyone has the same reaction.  My last visit was on a Friday when they were overwhelmed by a large crowd from Yelp, who had come to assess the pizza.  I met Don, who is Portland's Yelp contact and who has written a fine review here.  We talked about the pizza and he and his friends seemed equally enthusiastic.  \\n\\nIt's important that a neighborhood place like this attract as loyal a following as possible.  The Reed neighborhood is changing, with lots of young couples moving into the area, and the restaurant choices, at least within a 20-block radius of my home, are extremely limited.  A kid growing up in this neighborhood is likely to be passionate about pizza all their lives.  Gladstone is such a place."},{"name":"Highland Kitchen","address":"150 Highland Ave","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"This place is a staple in my neighborhood, and with good reason.

The kimchi rice, tofu, and soybeans were enough to fill me up and the small portion of fries was actually quite big! They give you sour cream and a type of tangy sweet sauce with your burrito.

Part of that is knowing how to order. here are a few tips if you're at all like me. Most of the omelette a come with the cooled egg wrapped around whatever filling you request like a blanket. I don't want that. I want it all mixed together, the egg acting as a delicious glue for my ingredients and they are more than happy to make it that way if you ask!\\nAnother tip: I always ask for well-done French fries instead of home fries even when ordering breakfast because they are thick cut and delicious! If you are a home fry fan like my boyfriend try asking them to throw them in the deep fryer! It's delicious and let's face it, diner food is not about counting calories. \\nOtherwise, when I'm here my coffee cup rarely goes past half empty as they are quick to top it off even on busy weekends. \\nWhen you approach the building on such a weekend you may panic when you see several groups waiting outside and several more packed inside the doors waiting for tables. BREATHE! It really does move quickly and it's worth the wait.\\nThis is also a great place to take a meal alone. Sit at the counter and enjoy the locals and the staff chatting during slow times.

The waiter leaned in and said \\"where's the one for racism?\\" Really?

I know some people try to compare Five Guys to In-N-Out on the West coast, but I think it's a totally different type of burger.  Five Guys burgers are greasy and delicious, and In-N-Out burgers are super simple, not as greasy, but still super yummy. \\n\\nRecently, one of my co-workers suggested a group of four of us go to this Five Guys by Lindbergh station for lunch on a Thursday.  Parking is a pain here because, as far as I could tell, it's street parking only.  I am absolutely horrible at parallel parking, so I wouldn't bother to go anywhere that requires street parking unless someone else is driving.  Fortunately, this was the case as one of my co-workers was kind enough to drive us.  We fed the defective parking meter several quarters and crossed our fingers that it wouldn't be a problem.\\n\\nI ordered my usual - a Little Bacon Cheeseburger with lettuce, tomatoes, grilled mushrooms, ketchup, BBQ sauce, and a bit of mayo.  One of my co-workers got an order of large regular fries, knowing that it would be more than enough to share with three others.  Since my co-workers didn't want the Cajun seasoning, I asked for some in a little container.\\n\\nWe didn't have to wait very long for our burgers.  However, as soon as I opened my burger, I noticed that there were grilled onions in it and no grilled mushrooms.  The cashier got my order wrong, and I confirmed this on my receipt.  I do have to admit that I didn't bother to check my receipt (assuming that they'd get the order right), but realize that I should have.  \\n\\nWhen I took my burger to the counter to let them know that I had asked for grilled mushrooms instead of onions, the woman who had taken my order told one of her co-workers (in Spanish) that I was wrong and I had told her I wanted grilled onions.  Obviously, I don't like onions and knew that I didn't say that.  Fortunately, the cook in the back was friendly and quickly (took less than a minute!) made me a new burger with grilled mushrooms.\\n\\nAs usual, my burger turned out to be juicy and delicious.  The large fries my co-worker bought included a ridiculous amount of fries.  The paper bag they put the large cup in was more than halfway full!  I guess that's just the way they like to serve their fries.  My three male co-workers and I could NOT finish one order of large fries.  But boy, were they good, especially with the Cajun seasoning sprinkled on top and dipped in a side of their BBQ sauce.  =)\\n\\nOverall, this Five Guys gets 3.5 stars for their delicious burger and fries and fairly clean dining area.  I normally give Five Guys burgers at least 4 stars, but I hate the parking situation and didn't appreciate the cashier accusing me of lying about what I had asked for in my burger.  I may return if my co-workers want to come back, but I wouldn't come back by myself.\\n\\n[Review 294 of 366]"},{"name":"Tasty n Sons","address":"3808 N Williams Ave, Ste C, Hub Building","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"I finally had breakfast at TnS and the food was really excellent.

It's the type of restaurant that's in an upscale shopping mall or an airport, not in a neighborhood. If you lived in beaverton, mayyybe this would fit in. \\n\\nFirst off, the ordering process is a bit strange. You can order a custom salad, which they make in the same way Subway does. You stand at the counter and tell them what you'd like, item-by-item, and then you pay at the counter once it's made. Okay, seems normal enough. \\n\\nBut you can also order one of the suggested \\"preselected\\" options, which would work fine if you got to sit down, but they make it the same way as above. So you end up standing at the counter waiting for 5-7 minutes while they silently make your salad based on a recipe, which feels awkward. It seems like if you order from the preset menu, you should be able to pay upfront, sit down, and have them bring it to your table. \\n\\nI wish this place would either go totally to custom orders (like Subway), or offer table service with no custom options. Instead, it's a hybrid model that only kinda works. They need to pick one or the other. \\n\\nThe salads are decent, but the portions are a both too large and overpriced. At other restaurants, I don't mind larger portions because I can just take any leftovers home and eat them later. Unfortunately, this doesn't work for chopped salad because the lettuce wilts pretty quickly. Here, I'll end up spending $13 on a large salad, only to throw 1/4 of it away, which is a waste of money. If they offered small salads at $6 each, it would be perfect. The taste/quality of the salads is decent but nothing stellar. \\n\\nThis place isn't bad, but they certainly have some kinks to work out. Given the price and atmosphere, this restaurant is a pass for me -- I'd rather spend a little less and get food cart food, or spend a little more on a nicer restaurant. This place is fine but not satisfying.

This place is a complete disaster.  \\n\\nWent to the Butcher Shop with a group of 8, which the restaurant said they could \\"definitely accommodate.\\"  That was a lie.  The restaurant is tiny.  It is ill-equipped to handle a party of greater than 2 people.  They had to join two 2-person tables and tried to seat 8 people at those tables.  News for you Butcher Shop - that doesn't work!  \\n\\nWe showed up on time for our reservation and then proceeded to stand around the butcher table like idiots for 20 minutes.  We ordered appetizers during while were waiting as it appeared that that's what you do there while you wait -- eat while standing next to a butcher table --- but of course nothing was brought out.\\n\\nWe were finally seated.  The restaurant is TINY.  But it's not intimate or personal.  Instead, it is lacking in character, ambiance or uniqueness.  The only thing the small size accomplished is making it extremely uncomfortable for the patrons.  We could barely sit around our  table, not to mention fit our plates on it.  I literally couldn't relax for a moment as in fear of a glass of wine or a steak of the person sitting next to me falling into my lap.  \\n\\nThe food... The appetizers were pretty good.  The plate of cold cuts and the steak tartare were by far the best items we tried.  You would think that at a placed called The Butcher Shop it would be all about the steak. You would be wrong.   It was the WORST steak I've had in Boston, and perhaps anywhere.  Tough, chewy, over-salted and tasteless at the same time.  Just terrible.  Could only force down half of it and everyone else at the table had similar feedback.  By the time I was done with half of my steak, my side of potatoes came out.  That was after I mentioned it THREE separate times to the wait staff.  This brings me to the service..\\n\\nTerrible.  We had two waiters one guy who brought out water and bottles of wine, but apparently wasn't able to take an order.

Who would've thought pea w/ blue cheese would be a good ice cream flavor? Or apple butter with lavender shortbread? Only Salt & Straw! Very unique flavors and homemade waffle cones. What more can you ask for? They have a list of of regular flavors and another list of seasonal flavors to keeps me coming for more. That's probably why there's always a line before I am able to drool all over the ice cream. The line is actually not that bad, that is, if you considered 30 min is a short wait time. I had good company, so it went by pretty fast. My favorites: almond brittle, sea salt caramel, and coffee and bourbon. Lesson learned: two scoops of ice cream is way too much for my little stomach to handle. Instead, try: one scoop with two different flavors on a waffle cone. It works!\\n\\n[-] After having Salt and Straw, I feel like I need to work out for the next month or so, okay, that's a bit exaggerated... but seriously, their ice cream are a bit too rich.

The first time I ordered I was surprised that I wasn't at all impressed...maybe an off day? So I gave it a second..and third...and fourth try. I'm not sure what the hype is about? I've had better, but I've also had worse. Pretty much middle of the road bagel and spread, and my co-workers agree. (Side note: I may be a bit bagel biased after the insanely amazing bagels at the \\"other\\" bagel place in Norwood). I generally get sesame with veggie spread with lettuce and tomato, and each time the tomatoes have been soggy, which can really put a damper on things. The one time I decided to eat inside the establishment I had to leave due to several fruit flies hovering over me and swopping down (I'm not sure if that can be prevented or not, though it's quite annoying). The other negative is the service. The counter experience has never been friendly, and on one occasion the woman yelled at the customer before me after she complained she was given a plain bagel when she ordered a sesame. The employee argued with her and insisted she *had* ordered a plain bagel (when she hadn't- I clearly heard her say sesame). How hard is it to say a quick \\"sorry\\" and fix it? It seems pretty counterproductive and a waste of time to fight over it. After I witnessed that I have not come here since.  I hate that this review seems so negative (that's really not like me) and I'm trying to think of something positive to say...I have heard great things about the egg/meat sandwiches, though I haven't tried them so maybe check them out?

It was during the evening, two hours before closing, and the place was pretty busy because everyone is back for the school year. When we got there, the workers informed us that they were out of black beans, steak, and guacamole. What didn't make sense to me was that the staff had decided to start their closing duties a whole two hours early and decided not to continue remaking/stocking their food items once it reached a particular time. The place was busy and people in front of me left because they were out of so much. It doesn't seem like a wise business strategy to practically push away paying customers because you wanted to get out early. I have worked in service for awhile now and that's not how you treat customers. I looked online and it still gave me the option to order all of the items they claimed they were out of. So I sincerely wonder if they were just saying that for the sake of not having to clean the kitchen later. Also, when telling the two people behind the counter what I wanted I felt so rushed because they were rushing me. So much so that when I asked the lady for salsa on the side, she had already smothered my whole bowl with salsa before I even finished my sentence. By this point the line had diminished and I was one of two other people ordering food. There was no need to push us out the door.

They were extremely large but also very fishy (tasted spoiled) and chewy seeming over cooked.  Also tried to the shrimp muqueca which featured several of those large excellent shrimp and a lighter sauce where the spice was more prominent.  All of these stew dishes come with a plate of rice that you can eat with your dish.  You can also spoon your stew over the rice which I recommend.  We also had an order of yucca but this was also chewy and hard.  My favorite orders of yucca are crisp on the outside and softer on the inside.  This was hard throughout.

I still get the same organic whole wheat penne w/ chicken added and gorgonzola artichoke sauce. I should really try something new but it's just SO good - why mess with a good thing? I have noticed that their portion sizes are inconsistent, which sometimes sucks and sometimes is awesome. I am also obsessed with their baby green salad - it's about as ideal as a salad gets. The side portion is very generous for a side at $3 and is great if you're building your lunch from different vendors. The entree portion at $6 is spot on for the amount of food for the price. The baby green consists of greens (duh), blueberries, raspberries, golden raisins (I hate raisins but these little guys remind me of dried cranberries, if they were yellow), pine nuts, red onion, gorgonzola, and their crack-like balsamic dressing. It's nowhere near any traditional balsamic dressing you've had. I've been double charged here on my debit card before - so watch out.

Getting a simple beer for a guest shouldn't be a 10-15 minute process and it was with him.  Unfortunately we couldn't leave until my friend got his card back (it was mandatory that customers use their card for a tab if downstairs, unless they opted to pay cash and would have to go upstairs)..

Good craft beer selection (although somewhat limited, its a good enough list to choose from).

If you and a friend wanted to grab a burger here, its an easy $30.  That's kinda crazy when you think about it.  And that's one of the cheaper options!  Still, the place is neat, my kind of atmosphere (chill when I was there), and extremely close to where we live, so it gets an extra star for being a place near Dripping Springs that isn't catering to the older or conservative crowd like most places out this way.

Here's what I found: \\n\\nAmbience & Location - Top notch! Tastefully decorated, modern and has a nice atmosphere  for dining. \\n\\nServing portions - Pretty decent but pricey for what you get. A friend of mine who dined there twice shared that on both occasions, when she ordered Pho for her children, they noticed they got less noodles than the adults did and were still charged regular prices. When asked about it, the waitress sheepishly confirmed that she thought the children would eat less and apologized. That's not ok! So be aware. \\n\\nPho - A good Pho is all about the broth. While the broth is served piping hot which I like, it was not brothy and rich in flavor. I had a chance to give my feedback to the owner who is a really nice guy. He said he had to 'tone it down' to cater more to the American taste because this is Happy Valley. I was sad to hear that. Moving on... \\n\\nH Tiu M√¨ (Egg Noodles in Pork broth) - The broth was tasty but filled with MSG. I went into a food coma when I returned home and was out 4 hours straight! Beware too that while the menu states Egg Noodles and minced pork is in this dish, when it was served, I was given rice noodles and no minced pork. I called the waiter over and after checking with the kitchen staff, he came back and told me the egg noodles were underneath the rice noodles. What?! That was not mentioned on the menu and totally unexpected. He couldn't give me an answer about the minced pork and another staff came over to explain what's listed on the menu is from another restaurant the owner owns. While minced pork is served at that restaurant, they don't at Pho Zen. She apologized and said they are still waiting on new menus to be printed. Umm... guys, you've been opened for almost 7 weeks now... time to get your act together with an accurate menu, don't you think?\\n\\nSalad rolls - Small & skinny. Nothing like what you find at Fubonn. The sauce taste more like coconut than peanut. I wouldn't even call it a peanut sauce. Don't waste your money.\\n\\nGrilled Lemongrass Chicken on rice - Chicken was dry, couldn't quite taste the lemongrass and could use more of a grilled flavor.\\n\\nB√∫n b√≤ Hu - It's ok. Like the Pho, I wish it was more brothy and rich. \\n\\nChicken Pad Thai - The winner on the menu! You can taste the goodness in your first bite. \\n\\nChicken Curry Rice - Good, not amazing. \\n\\nBeef Salad - a friend ordered that and said it was good. \\n\\nOverall, this place is pricier than the average pho restaurant. My favorite is still Pho Hung when it comes to food quality and getting the bang for your buck. While I'm glad we finally have another asian restaurant in this area, I just wish they would do some tweaking in the kitchen! I support local businesses and want them to succeed.

But something is missing to make it worth the cost. To start- the bagel crisps that I loved so much in Brookline were not just crispy but stale in Natick. And the little container of dip was so little that it was gone after two dips! However if you crave a great tongue sandwich you CAN GET IT HERE.  It was warm and delicious and made me forget about the stale bagel crisps. My sons did like the pastrami and brisket sandwiches which is now making me think to add an extra star! But like I said - it is expensive and if you want to save a little money, don't order a soda for $2.50 !  What a waste!  Will I go back again??

The jerk flavour was good but it's a bit pricey for wings according to my friend who's more familiar with wings night etc than I am.\\n\\n-Steak + Coconut Prawns (3/5): Mediocre steak and mediocre prawns. This steak comes pre-cut for you with some ponzu sauce. For those who like an Asian flavour to their steak.\\n\\n-8 oz Black Angus Sirloin (3.5/5): This was better than the above but not as good as the ones at the Keg or Cactus but then again price point is lower here.\\n\\nBrunch items:\\n\\n-Chorizo + Mushroom Hash (3/5): The poached eggs for the highlight of this dish. I found the hash to be a bit too dry and overall this dish was very flat. The avocados were starting to brown. This kind of threw me off a bit.\\n\\n- Country Breakfast (3.5/5): Country breakfast looked better than mine and included 2 eggs any style (got scrambled), bacon, sausage, cajun tomato, baked beans, crispy fried potatoes and toast. I sampled the sausage and it was delicious. \\n\\nDrinks:\\n\\n-The Green Juice (3.5/5): Lots of healthy ingredients as per description (not mention on their online menu). It's a bit sweet compared to the ones you get at the juicery.\\n\\n-The Remedy (4/5): A bit scared to get this as I hate turmeric and ginger but this drink had enough of both that it was not overpowering. I had a slight congestion and was hoping this would help. I sorta did I guess. I like this one over the ones you get at the juicery 'cause they added carbonated water or something of the like to make this drink fizzy.\\n\\nService: Both times the service provided by the servers were great but the food took very long to come out. They weren't even that busy when we went for brunch. We were one of the few that went early so not sure why the kitchen is so slow.\\n\\nOverall, the food didn't seem to impress and not sure if it's just this location but I think I've had enough of Earls and would rather splurge a bit more and go to Cactus."},{"name":"Buffalo Wild Wings","address":"9810 NE Cascades Pkwy","city":"Portland","stars":"2.5","text":"Just didn't like this place...

However, I was pretty sad when I left the restaurant. Here's why.\\n\\nNot only were we treated poorly for using their \\"deal\\", they wanted to hurry us out without even having dessert! The portions were way smaller than their usual offerings. I tried their \\"infamous Mariscada\\" dish which was more like a heavy cilantro soup with only two shrimps floating around in the whole thing! The plate looked NOTHING like what others had photographed on here. I felt so cheated. A delicious cioppino at Neptune's ($25) carried way more quality seafood than what I got from Muqueca -- 3rd-rate seafood served out of a frozen bag. So, their Mariscada had two shrimps, a handful of mushy mussels, and less than a spoonful of tiny salad shrimp. No fish.\\n\\nMy husband tried the Shrimp Bobo. The sauce was GREAT; however the contents were not. \\n\\nIf the restaurant's true intention with these discounts is to attract new customers, they are actually forcing the opposite. Now that they've already collected your cash, they feel no reason to please you. The tip is already added in the bill! That's the sad truth. I understand seafood very well, and consider myself an expert on fresh fish because I grew up on the Mediterranean. Both dishes we ordered were not worth more than $5 each. I love fish stews, but what Muqueca poses as stews are actually watered-down cilantro soups piled high with onions and tomatoes as fillers -- with hardly any seafood in them (plus its the frozen kind from China). \\n\\nIf you must go here because you've already purchased their deal on Travelzoo, get the shrimp house salad.

We all did the buffet and Rodizio (AYCE meat brought to the table on the skewers) and we were all impressed. The buffet was fresher and more interesting than most Brazillian buffets we've had before.   Everyone found something to love at the buffet., so much so that some kept going back even though that meant less room for the Rodizio. \\n\\nEverything at the buffet was fresh.  We got there on the early side (6:30) so I can't say what you'd find at 9PM.   It's usually a good idea, especially on a week night, to hit a buffet early unless you know they have a huge turnover.\\n\\nThe meat varied in quality,  though some of it was great. First cuts from the skewers tended to be over salted. My wife loved all the chicken that came to the table.\\n\\nService was great.  Everyone aimed to please and the waiter had nice touch and a good sense of humor.

There is ample parking as this location is pretty much at the mall. As usual for Cheesecake Factory the restaurant is massive with a massive menu. My bf always gets the fettuccini Alfredo with a meat and broccoli. He must like it since it's the 4th time he ordered it. I like the fettuccine noodles they use, the sauce is pretty good too. They do tend to skimp on the meat and broccoli though. I had the skinny chopped salad which was pretty tasteless and had some brown romaine hearts in it. Portions are super large here so I suggest ordering off the lunch menu if you can. Prices are reasonable because of the portion sizes. Wait staff has been pretty consistent with pretty good service. Food comes out hot and promptly. Taste wise the food is average at best. Happy hour prices are great on food (get the burger!) and ok on drinks.  Oddly enough I've never had the cheesecake. It's probably because I'm always so full after my entree. All around a solid place to eat but it won't wow you. Enjoy!"},{"name":"The Picnic House","address":"723 SW Salmon St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Disappointed by prices and lack of options on menu.

I absolutley loved the decor and ambiance, its quite lively, so if you want a quiet meal probably don't choose here. The menu options were quite vast, and of course everything sounded amazing (so I definitely have to go again). I started with the meatballs - to die for! My only complaint was that there were 3 and I could have downed 10 because they were just that tasty. For my main, I had that chicken breast stuffed with ricotta and spinach. In my opinion, any meat stuffed with cheese is a winner, but this was off the hook. The chicken was done to perfection and the sides were roasted vegetables cooked in a juicy buttery something yum. Dessert - I chose the Creme Brulee...always a winner and I think out of all the desserts that was the best. We left feeling full but not stuffed which was nice. The service was impeccable.

It's good enough.  I prefer it to most other quick slice eateries out in Brighton.  I have never had the steak and cheese or a sub of any sort from this place.  Just a basic mushroom pie.  Who cares?  Everything tastes pretty good when you're bonged up watching Sesame Street re-runs on Youtube.  Just make sure it's before 9pm or you might not get a delivery.\\n\\nIt's mad oily.

The servers were consistently cleaning and setting up tables so there was a wait of less than 2 minutes so that's a plus. \\n\\nBeware: the portions are quite small and there's a limited menu on Sundays so if you'd like more options don't go for brunch.
