I could put those things away like there was no tomorrow.  The Charlie's Special breakfast tacos, also an A+.  And then.\\n\\nI had a few visits where the cochinita tacos just weren't good.  They were dry, or cold, and the tortillas seemed stale (I was highly surprised by this).

One of my dining companions found a twisty-tie in her fish taco.  The employees were nonplussed--ok, it's just a twisty-tie--but their offer of a free taco on my friend's next visit rang hollow when it was premised solely on the memory of the one employee who made the offer.  \\n\\nDespite these qualms, I eventually found my way back to El Chilito, hoping its decline in quality had been arrested, and dare I say, reversed.  I switched from the cochinita tacos to the tinga de pollo burrito.

We came especially for the tasting menu with wine pairing, as my daughter and son in law had dined at this establishment in September, and felt it rated a second visit to share with me. We were seated promptly and had every expectation that our experience would be a good one. It was not. For some reason, rather than having an actual regular server, we had a mix of random wait staff, including the wine director, who would randomly pass us to other staff and disappear. Out of six courses, two were good, the remainder... disappointing. The beef course was pitiful and tough, the halibut mediocre and the elk tartare tasteless. We were accidentally served elderflower cordial/liqueur instead of sparkling water and then the wine director denigrated the staff for the mistake. Very disappointing! At one point when I questioned him about the choice of wine with the halibut course, he stated that the kitchen staff must have changed the recipe for the dish and that was why the pairing wasn't working. Our overall feeling was that the primary staff had the night off, leaving everyone else to take up the slack as best they could. On the plus side, the cocktails were lovely and most of the wines were well matched.

Although it was super busy, we only waited 5-10min to get seated. We ordered the Thai Chilli Chicken appetizer, Kobe beef burger, Malaysian Seafood Curry with rice, Kids Chicken Tenders, and Mango Pie. My 7 year old and I enjoyed the Thai Chilli Chicken. It wasn't too spicy. The texture was ok. It was kind of hard in some areas so I suspect they double fried the chicken and then covered it in the sauce. My husband said his Kobe Beef burger was also ok. He said he had eaten better ones. It was a nice large portion though, because he could only eat half of it. I tried the patty, and to me it didn't taste that much different from a regular hamburger beef patty. I was looking forward to the Malaysian Seafood Curry after reading some promising reviews. I love curry and have eaten it at many different places. This one was especially underseasoned. I felt like it needed salt. The curry flavor was also very light and mild, and I didn't really taste it until I got to the very bottom of my bowl. I think the amount of rice that was served with it was also way too much, and again, very underseasoned. The best part of our meal was the Mango Pie. That was really delicious! Service was good and the ambiance was very unique. The hostess said that it was an actual home in India that was taken apart and put back together there. I was suprised how few bathroom stalls there were, given the fact that the size of the restaurant and amount of people that it held was quite large.

This isn't the response you want to here when you enter a restaurant with four hungry kids.  Now I get it, sometimes there will be a wait even with a reservation, but you need to try to accommodate your customers properly with alternative options considering that may be an extensive wait.  They didn't give a time frame and just disappeared from the front of the hosting station.  I asked to speak to a manager once the girl returned to the hosting station.  She left to do so.  The manager never came, but coincidentally we were seated shortly after.  Everyone was kind, never an issue.  There were a couple of slips from the waiter, again very nice, but he forgot my husbands drink, then forgot 1 additional wine glass when there where 4 adults.  My husband ordered the squid ink linguini, but regular linguini came out because they ran out.  So, it's those type of slip ups that may give an establishment 3 stars on here, but I thought the view and my lobster made up for it.  Again, the waiter was VERY kind and was super busy so I get it.  One suggestion would be to put out some sort of bread while people are waiting for their meals.  I always think of this as a nice touch when you are eating at a nice restaurant.  We started with the chowder fries which was cheesy, tasty deliciousness.  We then got the Octopus salad which was tender and went well with the homemade feta and crusty bread, just wish there was one more piece of octopus on the plate.  My lobster had good crab to breadcrumb ratio in the stuffing and the lobster was cooked perfectly.  My husband had the seafood pasta dish and thought it was very good, good seasoning, great flavor.  The kids got the cheese pizza and the lobster roll, both were enjoyed.  Overall, I think you should try this restaurant for its central location, great views and good food.

I got the lobster pasta, which while it did say there were chili flakes on it on the menu, it was almost not edible because it was so spicy. I can handle a bit of spice, but my husband and I ended up switching plates as I could barely eat the pasta. I wished the server warned me that it was very spicy. \\n\\nWhen we asked to see a dessert menu, again we were given the menu and no explanation as to what the server might recommend. We passed on dessert and ended up getting after dinner drinks and dessert elsewhere instead. We requested our check and put our dine around card in. When we got the check back without the next card in it, we had to flag down the server who then told us someone else would bring it. \\n\\nOverall, we were really just disappointed in the service. To spend over $100 (after a gift card discount) on lackluster food and service, I most likely will be switching out my dine around card to a different restaurant next year. \\n\\nThe two stars I am giving is due to the great bus-boy service (my water glass was never empty and they were very kind), good valet, and overall a nice atmosphere at the restaurant itself."},{"name":"Monica's Trattoria","address":"67 Prince St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Oh boy.  I think this is going to be a long one.\\n\\nThere were ups; there were downs.  I don't really even know where to begin.\\n\\nSo we usually go to the North End for special occasions, because we're cheesy like that.  We used to go to Cantina Italiana all the time, but in recent visits, we've noticed a few changes that kind of annoyed us, so we decided to branch out.  Most of the times we branch out, we discover that maybe we shouldn't have.  It was sort of that way this time too.\\n\\nYelp steered me in the direction of Trattoria di Monica, so I made reservations several days in advance of our visit.  When we got there, a few minutes early, we were astounded by just how small the place really is.  It's no joke.  Our reservation was for two, but there weren't really any tables for two.  There was a table for four, so they just separated the tables maaaybe one inch so that they weren't touching, thereby decreasing the size of the pathway for the patrons and waitresses.  So to my left was some dude, closer to me than my dining compadre.  And to my right was a 6-inch passageway, then more tables.  Had I been claustrophobic, I would have barfed.  Any time anyone needed to get by, they had to get all up on our table.  And any time the wait staff needed to talk to the people beside us, they had to talk over us.  Awk-ward.  \\n\\nThings got a heck of a lot more awkward when I spilled my water all over the place.  Whoops.\\n\\nI started out with a glass of wine, and the mister had a Sam Winter lager.  Both were good (though the wine was a bit pricey).  We ordered the stuffed artichoke appetizer special to start, and I got the gnocchi in the plum tomato sauce for my entree.  The mister ordered the pesto/bechamel lasagna.  \\n\\nWe were given some bread while we waited, and that was pretty good.  I liked the breadsticks.\\n\\nThe artichoke came, and I enjoyed that (the mister wasn't as impressed).\\n\\nMy gnocchi were actually delicious, and I am a gnocchi snob of epic proportions.  I have a gnocchi-making Italian grandma, so obviously my standards are high.  I am usually disappointed with restaurant gnocchi, but this dish did not disappoint.  It amazed.  Really, really good stuff.  The portion was rather small though - I could have eaten another whole plate. \\n\\nThe lasagna was mediocre, which was too bad considering its hefty price tag.\\n\\nService was not particularly good.  A couple of the runners were friendly, but our waitress was not friendly at all and often seemed annoyed.  Then she overcharged us for one of our dishes, which wasn't cool either.  \\n\\nWe figured we'd hit up someplace else for cappuccino and dessert, which we did, and that was a fine decision.\\n\\nSo yes, the food is good, but between the lackluster service and the super, super stressful cramped quarters, I don't think we'll be returning.

When my friend and I were struggling to figure out a place to eat that was simple but not one of our regular spots, I had the realization one of these restaurants was still around. Thus began our trek to dine at a Milestones. \\n\\nI gotta say it feels a bit unorthodoxed to get seated at the restaurant. Enter a door and walk up a couple flights of stairs was a bit weird. Doubly so that the stairs were black and the lighting was dimmed. Was worried I might not make it to the top but alas I succeeded. Otherwise seating and arrangements were fine. Cozy and comfy seating throughout the restaurant made it a good experience.\\n\\nWasn't entirely a fan of the level of service. We noticed that our waiter would disappear for periods of time. Took us a fair amount of time from when we sat down to actually putting our orders in. We also waited quite a bit to get the bill at the end of the night. It seemed they had more time to serve everyone else but not us. I suppose they might have been shorthanded but if it's a regular occurrence, Milestones could definitely be helped by having one or two more hands on deck.\\n\\nFor my meal I went with the California Burger and substituted my fries for yam fries. Gotta say I was pretty happy with my food and my modest expectations were exceeded. Loved having the avocado in the burger as it helped cool everything down and added another element to the burger. Burger itself was really tasty and I could have ordered another one since I was enjoying it so much. Yam fries were great but there was way too much spiciness in the aioli that it came with. It was a lot more overwhelming than I'm used to and made it difficult to have.\\n\\nOverall, I had an enjoyable experience at Milestones. The food was definitely great and makes me want to go back.

Don't get me wrong - great food, great staff, and great views would suggest an extra 1/2 star if possible - but alas, it's not possible on Yelp!\\nThat  negative star is due to a couple of things.\\nThe parking: While we generally don't have a problem finding a spot and they have graciously hired a complimentary valet, the parking lot needs serious attention. If your car is slightly lower than average, you will probably scrape the bottom.\\nThe dripping A/C: While installing central A/C was a HUGE improvement over the swamp fans originally used, if you happen to be sitting in either of 2 chairs at the corner of the bar, you will get dripped on. Only a slight issue...but every time I'm in there I think, \\"Surely some creative person could come up with a modification to divert that drip.\\" Might be my weekend project. :)\\nThe women's bathroom: I can't speak to the men's abode, but the ladies entering this stall will have to consider the angle at which you sit down. The toilet is so close to the wall it's a bit awkward.\\nThe external doors to the patios: We live in Florida and therefore it can be HOT! I do understand that but if I want to sit in the heat, I'll sit outside. They installed the A/C for a reason I assume...so why not install those thingys (technical term) that automatically close the doors to the outside. Apparently, most people were raised in a barn and don't close the door after going through it. Or the servers' hands are full and they just can't. Surely that's a pretty cheap fix, no?\\nAnd last but not least, and certainly not the only bar I have this complaint about: Why are purse hooks placed under a bar? So individuals can hang purses/bags there. I know I don't feel comfortable hanging my purse in front of another patron so why is it that there are only purse hooks every 2 or 3 seats? So frustrating to have to put your purse on the bar.\\nAgain, overall I truly enjoy The Waterfront and go there frequently.

Call ahead and place your order, and come pick it up in 30 min. Pizza only for takeout, and the pizzas themselves are \\"medium\\" sized - about the same size as a dominoes medium. Probably enough for 3 people to split, or 2 if you're really hungry. Maybe you could eat one yourself if you really wanted to. Don't go in the front door for takeout - there's a back door directly into the kitchen for a separate takeout line.\\n\\nThe crust is very very crunchy and was a bit of a love it or hate it factor. Definitely a lot of crust got left over when I first ordered it for a party, since after the pizza cooled the crust became rock hard and brittle. I personally felt like there was way too much crust left bare on the pizza - would have loved to see some of the topping spread out further to the edge. The bottom of the pizza is flavored with what tasted like garlic butter - it was a bit strong but a welcome addition to the flavorings, and also a bit of a surprise.\\n\\nThe middle of the pie is absolutely piled with toppings. This is a messy messy pizza, absolutely dripping with sauce and cheese. We got a pepperoni and the meat slices were absolute heaped on. However, I realized what contributed to the messiness is that Santarpios appears to be in the camp of toppings under the cheese, which means everything ends up sliding around everywhere because there isn't much adhesion. Philosophical debates about pie tears families apart, so I won't touch upon the details of my own opinion, but just know that it can get messy and the toppings can slide or fall off because of how the pie is constructed."},{"name":"Santarpio's Pizza","address":"111 Chelsea St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"When placing our order the waiter asked my black friend if he wanted Grape Soda with his meal.

The highlighted donut used across numerous entrees isn't sweet, so it made an excellent, yeasty base or bread for the entrees and sandwiches.  (It didn't look like the donut was used in the salads, but I wonder if it might be decent croutons?)  More than a gimmick, the doughnut and other food items on the plate balance and elevate the flavors.  The entrees are creative (even without counting the doughnut), and many come with wonderfully flavorful sauces.  The menu also has several creative cocktails, although the ones I tasted were too sweet for my preferences.\\n\\nThe restaurant has indoor and outdoor dining areas.  (The indoor area can get a bit cramped especially during busy periods on bad weather days.  In particular, there's not a lot of indoor space for people to wait for their table, so walkways get tight.)  Seating is as booths and regular tables, comfortable high tables near the bar -- seating on spinning stools -- and picnic tables outside.  Wood, country decor is prevalent.  There are several TVs inside, around the bar and broader dining areas.  The staff is warm and friendly.

I also wish they'd add some new offerings to their menu and branch out a bit, but I've come to accept that it's just not that type of place.

Your time here is punctuated by the THWAP of the dough hitting the counter. It's super impressive. And those noodles are gooooood. Chewy and fresh and awesome. \\n\\nI'd bookmarked Xian after reading so many good reviews about the noodles. Anything with fresh carby goodness is on my auto-bookmark list. It was a little chilly and we needed some comfort food and Xian was near Home Depot. I walked in the back, really confused. I just kind of lingered there for a while before figuring out that I was not in the right place. It's tricky. \\n\\nWe sat down, found out it was all night HH on Sunday and got a little order happy. Lobster dumplings, Tuna Amazing roll, some sashimi and I got the Dan Dan noodles. Gimme the spice! True to the info in some other reviews, the sushi was only okay. That Tuna Amazing wasn't very amazing at all and the lobster dumplings seemed like they'd been frozen before. Also, they were served on guacamole. Whhhhhat?\\n\\nMy Dan Dan noodle soup on the other hand was out of this world. Savory, slippery, a little sweet with cilantro, chile and sesame flavors. The meat itself was only okay but the flavor of the rest was complex and delicious. I'd go back for that in a heartbeat. (The sushi... not so much.)\\n\\nThe hitch with our experience there was the time it takes to get your food. Don't get me wrong -- I know they're making those suckers fresh. I do think they should warn you that it might be 30+ minutes so that you're prepared to sip your wine more slowly. Also, the tables around us seemed to get their food pretty quickly but ours had a long delay and then came all in a rush.

It was incorrectly sealed and placed in the bag by them, not me. By the time I caught it, all of it was gone. The lack of this sauce, when I ate it, might explain why I didn't think it was AMAZING.

It's a small restaurant, so if you have a big group, make sure you reserve in advance. \\n\\nAs for appetizer, I tried most of them, but I want to highlight the most common or ordered one, which is sambusa. I usually get the minced beef one, and it is crispy on the inside and juicy in the inside. Share this because it is filling. \\n\\nI usually get the Ribeye or Filet Tibs with various combination of slides. This dish so flavorful, and the meat is tender. It's never dry, and the restaurant gives you an ample amount of meat. Go with injera, for authenticity purposes, or rice, or whichever other item you prefer. Any of the vegetable sides are great too. I feel like Ethiopian vegetable dishes or sides are great no matter what. So, get excited.\\n\\nIf you are there with two people, and you are paying for someone because you are on a date or because you want to be nice, try the original meatlover. The dish contains three types of beef and cuts, but make sure you ask to have this cooked all the way. Some people do get squimish at cooler meat temperatures. Overall, you get to taste different style of flavor and cooking. Injera is given, and the dish comes with two vegetable sides.

Our reservation was originally for 6:45, but since we were available earlier, we called and bumped it up with no issue. Parking could potentially be problematic in the area, given that it's on King Street and right next to a popular cocktail bar, Bottle Shop. Fortunately I lucked out and got a good spot on the street. We were greeted warmly upon entering, and our servers Cat and Trent (the latter was finishing up training) were very genial and knowledgeable about the menu. As others have mentioned, the menu options are fairly limited, though all look quite tasty. We ordered a couple of cocktails to start -- she a Bushel Blush, and me a Tiki Tock -- and we decided to split a couple of large entrees and skip appetizers. In a toss up between the the buttermilk fried chicken, the crispy pork shank , and the ribeye steak, we opted for the latter two. The chef kindly split both orders on to two plates each, which was a nice touch.\\n\\nI must admit that my cocktail was disappointing. With a name like Tiki Tock, and ingredients like rum, coconut milk, and pineapple juice, I assumed it would be sweet and tropical. Alas, it wasn't very sweet at all, and was, quite frankly, unexpectedly bland. My girlfriend liked hers a little better. Our entrees were similarly a mixed bag. We both agreed that the ribeye was excellent, but I thought the pork shank was surprisingly tough...definitely not tender, and certainly not crispy. My girlfriend liked it a bit more than I did (though didn't love it), and I can't help but wonder if she got a better piece of meat than I did -- it *looked* better, at least. \\n\\nDessert was a must, and the options were an Oreo cheesecake, a salted caramel creme brulee, and a peach cobbler. I opted for the creme brulee, and truly enjoyed it, but my girlfriend wasn't at all happy with her cobbler, and wound up not finishing it. All told, the bill was a little over $100, which is fine for the level of restaurant it is, but the overall dining experience was a bit disappointing. Again, there were things to like about Alqueria -- service, some of the food etc. -- but there was enough that was unappealing to make us think twice about returning. It deserves to be considered a four-star restaurant by Yelp standards, but given the burgeoning food scene in Columbus, it's not quite strong enough at its price point to be a can't-miss go-to, in my opinion."},{"name":"Wild Chix & Waffles","address":"7714 Burnet Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"It was my first time trying chicken and waffles and theirs exceeded my expectation.

My last three visits have been bad, worse and worse yet in that order. The restaurant is filthy, the service and attention is really bad and it is beyond help. The staff is too busy talking and being cool with Facebook than doing their jobs. It is a 10 minute wait from sitting at your table until the server arrives with menus. It is another 10 minutes until he returns again to ask about drinks and food orders. Drinks come 15 minutes later and food comes 20 minutes after that. 50% of the dishes have stone cold food but you have to eat it because you are starving and would eat anything at that point. When the server returns 30 minutes later, he can't understand why you ate the food if it was cold. He doesn't understand that you can't talk to a server who is not in the dining area so his manager comes over and tells you how great she is at solving problems so she offers a free dessert. When the bill comes 1( minutes after that, there is a $7.99 charge for the free dessert and a $1.99 charge fir the table top zoos that I never used. Can I ask the server to remove these? Of course not - he and the manager disappeared again. My family waited in the car for 15 minutes while I waited for the no show server. I thought about walking out without paying but two wrongs don't make a right so I paid the bill in full and added 15% tip with cash. The lesson is that I will never, ever eat at any Chili's and I will relay my story to friends and family for many years after the whole chain had gone bankrupt due to totally inept management.

The caramelized onions were very sweet and went well with the oysters. The side potatoes that came with the oyster has was also very good and seasoned to perfection.

There's just one thing that is odd to me and want to share. I had the badass breakfast, substituted toast for a biscuit. I was told no problem. When my order arrived I received half a biscuit. Confused, I asked myself, did the chef forget the top half of my biscuit. The waitress seemed confused as well and when asking a colleague for help, she was told that's how a substitute toast comes. Hearing this, I just ignored, and wanted to eat. The breakfast was great, and the coffee excellent. Cleaned my plate. Happy right. Then comes the other half of biscuit (Top). Ok, I was like, might as well eat it. Guess the chef figured, what do I do with half biscuit. All good. Well then the bill comes, and it's not about the money, but it's about my experience (customer). I got charged $1 for substituting toast for half a biscuit, then got charged another $2 for the other half biscuit, and I didn't request it and it came after I was done with my meal. Left a Sour taste in my mouth. All and all this place has potential, but for God sake, substitute a toast with a complete Biscuit  Please. 3 stars for half a biscuit (bottom half), 4 stars for a full biscuit."},{"name":"Blue Star Donuts","address":"1155 SW Morrison St, Ste 102","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Got the sugar n' spice: the texture was perfection - light, airy, and soft.

A bit pricey, but everyone seemed to say it was worth it. \\n\\nI finally got my tacos and sampled some of their salsas. They're nothing to rave about, I certainly don't think they're balanced well, but the green sauce was the best. I tried a bite of the taco without salsa, and then confused, took a bite with salsa. The meat was so bland! Literally no flavor. I opened up the taco and took a closer look at the meat. It was certainly moist and tender and an appreciable color, but I'm ultimately putting the thing in my mouth for the incredible taste! The second taco was the same, leaving me really perplexed. To make matters worse, I actually found a bone in my first taco. A legit bone, about the size of two pieces of meat. That was pretty gross. \\n\\nI got corn tortillas and they were alright.

That being said the whole duck was chopped up, so I had to be cautious not to eat any bones. I'm not sure if this is how it is traditionally served, but it was quite the task to separate all of the meat. Next time I will probably just get the chow mein with duck meat instead so it's done for me. \\n\\nI was a little disappointed with the pan fried dumplings. The dough was thick, it didn't have a lot of filling, the filling didn't have a ton of flavor, and it wasn't served with a side of vinegar dipping sauce but rather a sweet sauce, almost like a Thai chili. Probably won't order it again. \\n\\nAll in all, the food was good and they served big portions. Flavor was decent but didn't wow me.

This was the first time I've had a French omelette, and oh my god I want to figure out how to make this. The egg was super light and delicate (to be fair, I don't get omelettes often). The outside was cooked smoothly and the inside was creamy and still not quite done. The bacon was light in flavor and wasn't very overpowering, and the goat cheese had an incredibly strong flavor which gave the omelette the punch it needed and a stark contrast to the lighter flavors of the egg and bacon. The texture was just so soft! For reference, I usually eat omelettes with a fork and knife, but I ended up only really needing a spoon for this one.\\n\\nThe sides of potatoes and a biscuit was a pleasant surprise too! The potatoes, to be honest, looked pretty unassuming, but they were quite nice. The inside was cooked to be soft while the outside had some crisp to it. If they make their ketchup in-house, props to them, because I really enjoyed it with the potatoes. The biscuit was fluffy and buttery, just like a good biscuit should be. And their jam was spectacular! I was hooked on the biscuit and jam combo, and was tempted to get another.\\n\\nMy brunch hit all the right notes for me.

The wrap is absolutely delicious. The next time I went back I got the Mandingo... to share of course because it's huge and it had a few extra things added to it that are not in the punany and again I did not add the tomatoes and it was once again a heavenly experience.

Tonight I couldn't even get a seat at the bar because two children were sitting there with a family member? There were plenty of tables available, but me..the adult had to sit at a table to drink my beer. To make matters worse they were showing a kids show on TV for them at the bar. After ordering two beers two slices, and a side salad, the bill came to a whopping $39!! I had to go ask for an itemized receipt. Then the young lady came to the table and scrutinized the bill after being told that the total was completely wrong. She took it to the back, but never came back. No apology...staff here needs training in proper customer service. The best part of the meal tonight was the side salad.

We came in the evening, so they were almost sold out of all the cakes. Determined to try Thierry's though, we still picked a few up. Unfortunately, both my friend and I felt really disappointed in their offerings. Granted, we did not try every single item they offer, but based on what we did try, we probably won't be back.\\n\\nChocolate Trio Cake (slice) - For something that is made out of three types of chocolate, it didn't really taste like chocolate at all. This cake is also made with some sort of alcohol, which wasn't indicated in its description. On their website there's an alcohol symbol though, so maybe I just missed it in the store. For someone who is extremely sensitive and dislikes the taste of alcohol, this cake was not good. Overall though, it lacked the flavours we were expecting, as it just tasted sweet with a kick of alcohol. Costco's tuxedo cake is MUCH better, and way cheaper too. (1.5/5)\\n\\nPistachio Opera Cake (slice) - Not sure of the exact name, but it was something along the lines of that. Eating the cake was like eating sugar. It was THAT sweet. From the cake to the icing to the nuts on top, it tasted as if sugar was 90% of the ingredients. Although the presentation was gorgeous and definitely Instagram worthy, it's not great for eating. (0/5)\\n\\nVanilla Raspberry Eclair - Again, not too sure of the name. This was the best item that we got. The cream was fresh, light, and slight sweet. This paired really well with the tart raspberry jam and fluffy eclair shell. The almond brittle on top tasted like it was burnt, so we would have preferred just a plain eclair shell topping. Compared to the other two items though, we demolished this eclair and this was the only item we finished. This eclair is the reason for an overall 2 stars, instead of 0 or 1.

I ordered the Lo Mein combo, which comes with shrimp and chicken as well as some bean sprouts and some other vegetables. I only ordered dessert the first time, which was cheesecake. It was actually really good!

We also received hot rolls prior to our meal and while they were fresh, they were lacking in flavor, almost like they were missing the pinch of salt. The butter they served with it was frozen and the rolls unfortunately could not melt it. She only had frozen butter, so no butter for our rolls.

I would go back there again just for that dish, it was that good!! I also really liked the bulgogi dduk-bokki, it's not the traditional sweet spicy dduk-bokki dish instead it was rice cakes with beef marinated in sweet soy.

Roomie and I slept late and of course we never have food in the house, so logically enough we needed some lunch to get the day going.

Luckily she put us in a spot by the entrance to where we could people watch from inside. The condiments bar was interesting to say the least, I had never had chipolte ketchup. I tried it but stuck with boring ol' classic ketchip instead. The soda choices were intriguing, however I was not familiar with the main root flavors so I unknowningly just wanted water. They had the water in a tiny, funny, fancy, slow pouring water spout with all this mumbo jump about how its pure and what not. And handed me a cup the size of a shot. Okay, not promoting the healthy choice that happens to be water...got it. \\n\\nMy greek burger was pretty good. I love all the ingredients in it so I thought I'd be in love. But, it tasted like beef to me and not lamb.

Three days later and we were still talking about our experience. The bacon here is \\"epic\\"!!! It must be at least 1/4 thick, no Joke! The hash brown casserole that comes with your meal was something someone's grandma created and it should never be overlooked. A special combination of potatoes, cheese, possibly onions and a whole lot of deliciousness makes it a welcomed addition to any meal. I can't begin to cover everything we had, but no one complained about anything. Only praises. \\n\\nThis is definitely a second visit restaurant. I too have nothing but praises for this place with the exception that the parking lot can be a bit challenging.

There were three servers within sight just standing there or moving around an empty table or two, but none of them came to give us waters or take our drink or food orders.

We decided to go a bit further out of town to see what we could come across.  Out in burbs, we found this place and were pretty pleasantly surprised even though the ambience is a bit odd in that it's attached to an Asian grocery store.  First off, this was our first experience using the Yelp waitlist app - very cool!  We'll be looking for this for new places going forward.  \\n\\nBut - onto the real part: the food.  Of the three that we've tried so far including Marukin and Kayo's Ramen Bar, we've liked the ramen at this place the best.  We got the only vegan/vegetarian options: Miso Ramen and a side of the garlic edamame.  The noodles were nice and chewy and the broth was tasty while not being overly salty (the danger with too much miso at times).  Props to them for their properly done Tare-marinated boiled eggs - both other places that we had ramen at were just regular ol' soft-boiled eggs.  \\n\\nThey don't have any vegetarian gyoza (dumplings) - Kayo's had a really nice option, though.  The garlic edamame were very tasty and offered me the opportunity to say only for the second time in my life that \\"there might be a bit too much garlic\\" (the other was a pizza in Portland many years ago before we moved here, ironically).  I'd still order them again, though, as I'm a garlic nut.\\n\\nAll in all - a good experience even though we had a grand total of one option for vegan ramen (to be fair, the other places didn't have many either and - to be even more fair - ramen is a beef-based broth dish typically).  Would I travel way out there again?  Probably not - I'm confident there's better ramen in Portland somewhere.\\n\\nSo far, my personal order of favoriteness is:\\nRamen Ryoma\\nKayo's\\nMarukin"},{"name":"Medina Cafe","address":"780 Richards Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"The wait was long if you were in a group, but I went solo and was seated in about ten minutes.

Not only does it rival some fast food fried chicken places in price, it exceeds them in flavor and quality. \\n\\nI came with three other friends and we all decided to pair off and share half a chicken per pair, fried green tomatoes, and fried chicken tenders. The platters come with two sides (baked beans and coleslaw), which you can switch out for any of their sides for $0.50. We decided to switch out four of them so we could try the rest of the sides. \\n\\nThe fried chicken is excellent! It comes out piping hot. The fried coating is thin and very crispy. The meat is well-seasoned and incredibly juicy. The chicken breast was even oozing juice. The sides are decent but the fried okra was definitely the best. To end the meal, you have to get the Big Wayne, which consists of the pecan pie and chocolate chess pie stacked together. Even if you have no room, get it to go and heat it up later. You'll thank me! \\n\\nOverall, Gus's is serving up some fantastic fried chicken (and pie) at a steal.

Ok I figure this place is new, just getting it together and it will get better as they settle in! I went today for the second time and it took 10 minutes of waiting around the register to be able to even place an order, so when he finally looked up (he was busy getting drinks for folks) I interrupted the attendant and asked if I could order and come back in 25 min to pick the 3 popovers up.... 40 later i come back and he says the 2 originals are in the bag but the peachy keen is out of stock so I need to select another. The apple was out also so I ended up ordering the chocolate.  He said ok 3 or 4 minutes. It was about 8 min,no genuine apology from the store, and we walked out and home only to open the bag and find 1 original not the 2 I paid for. So now I've spent 20.00 for 3, lost over an hour of my morning and am now missing one.. called 3 times to ask for a refund no answer,  so I walked all the way back. The guy at the front didnt acknowledge me waiting so had to interrupt again... he was pretty rude and complained about how busy they were as a reason for the issues. Said he would get the popover, but I said I wanted a refund. He started to try to play with the register and then reached into his pocket and gave me 5.00 from his wallet. Bizarre.... wont apologize for the wait or for not having what we ordered or for missing one item in the bag....speaks in an incredibly patronizing tone when he refunds me the 5 bucks while finally saying sorry but then gives me his own cash? At any rate one star because the food was edible but according to my boyfriend who is a popover connoisseur... they were not great. Dry and not tasty.

Also, the fortune cookies didn't come in the plastic wrappers and tasted home made, so I suspect they may have been. Overall very positive experience and don't understand why this place doesn't have better reviews!"},{"name":"Phoebe's Diner","address":"533 W Oltorf St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"It's a solid 3.5, standard diner food done well but nothing unique. Went here on Sunday for brunch and like the other reviews point out, there is a wait. Thankfully, it was storming when we went and there were just 2 of us so our wait got cut down pretty short because they had empty seats at the bar. It's pretty small and tight area so if you have a big group make reservations (no idea about the reservation policy) or come in early, also there is no space to really wait. \\n\\nThe good: I got the migas and my friend got the crab benedict. Both of the food came out fast and they were delicious. I loved the chipotle-ish cream sauce on my migas but to be honest, my migas were scrambled eggs than migas. My freind enjoyed her benedict and we both loved the POTATOES. They were crispy but also fluffy and we scarfed them down. Normally I don't do brunch without mimosa but I had to skip it here  because I had a busy day and wanted to be coherent. But their mimosa carafe's are a great deal. Sitting at the bar, I got to see them prepare their carafes and it's a whole bottle of sprakling something in each carafe. All their juices are store bought and it looked likes in each carafe they had a \\"naked\\" size of juice mixed in so a good ratio of prosecco to juice.\\n\\nThe bad: You can't call a dish MIGAS unless it has tortially strips in it or something crunchy. The description does warn no tortilla strips but they say they have a masa cake so I was expecting that to find that in the eggs. The masa cake are 2 hushpuppy-esque cripsy balls on the side rather than in the dish. Also, while tasty, the texture of the masa balls (kinds like mushy grits on the inside) did not make up for the lack of tortilla strips) I don't know why they have it as migas, maybe to appeal to the love of migas in austin? but this is not migas. It's a delicious plate of scrambled eggs and that was my only peeve.\\n\\nOverall, it's a nice place to eat but nothing minblowing. Imo, don't think it's worth waiting more than 10-15 minutes because the food here is standard but a little healthier diner food done well"},{"name":"Ziggy's","address":"510 E Broad St","city":"Pataskala","stars":"3.5","text":"I finally broke down and decided to make the trek here.

They're okay if I need a quick fix but definitely not on the calibre of Laduree. Some people have mentioned Laduree macarons are too small, but that is the purpose of it. Macarons are light, delicate, petite desserts meant to be served with teatime, not large, obtrusive cookies. With that being said, the flavors of the Thierry macarons are okay  (Jasmine had the best flavor), but was too big and high to be considered delicate.  The shell lacked the combination of crisp but melt in your mouth softness and the ganache was slightly too whipped and airy. \\n\\nIf Laduree macarons is the a French princess, Thierry is her slightly overweight and clumsy cousin.

Our waitre asked if we wanted our check before our food even came out and she was very surprised that our food hadn't come out, but she didn't do anything about it.

The Surrey location however was quite a disappointment for food quality, service and maintenance upkeep.  We ordered a beef pot, curry cream and Japanese miso.  Both the beef pot and the curry cream seemed lacking ingredients and the soup was watered down.  3 quarters of the pots were cabbage.  The Japanese miso seemed to be off as well.  As I discussed the inconsistency in taste with DH, we noticed there was no crab in the pot which was an essential ingredient to give the soup a sweet seafood flavor.  We then asked the server if they've forgotten to put in the crab, she snapped back that it's a seasonal ingredient.  I'm pretty sure they don't use fresh crab to make the pot.  I don't understand how frozen crab can be out of season.  Instead of crab, it was again replaced with a chunk of cabbage.  If anything was consistent, it was their consistency in the abundance of cabbage and lack of everything else including flavor.  3 out of the 4 sauces on the table were also near empty.

You top off that arepa with their house made pink sauce and garlic sauce and it's heaven in your mouth!  I've also enjoyed their patacon.  Usually I split it with someone since it's very filling.  It comes with fried tostones, your choice of meat, coleslaw and cheese.  They serve you two of them in one plate and the cutest thing is the venezuelan flag they put on them.

I came here for swine time (their version of happy hour) and was pleasantly surprised to find that their swine time menu foods were fantastic. Such a great deal for what you get, and these guys really know how to make vegetables taste good. Take your kids here if you want to get them to eat veggies. ;)\\n\\nMy favorite dish was the $6 summer squash salad (I think that's the name?). It was such an explosion of different textures and flavors that went really well together. The goat cheese in this dish was really clean tasting. You get a little bit of savory, sweet, and crunchy.\\n\\nThe $4 okra dish was also fantastic. I never knew okra could taste like that. Prepared two ways (fried, and grilled), it had a wonderful crunchy texture and smokey flavor. The shiitake dumplings, which they're known for, is also very good. It's like a mushroom soup dumpling, as the soup just bursts in your mouth when you bite it. For $12 for 4 dumplings, I don't know that I'd order it again, but definitely worth trying at least once. \\n\\nThe only thing I didn't super care for was the $9 short ribs, as it was a little chewy, but the flavors were still good. The mango rum creme brulee is so creative and reminds me of mango sticky rice (there is a layer of rice on the bottom of the creme brulee!). The mango sorbet was also great, sour, and a nice contrast to the creaminess of the creme brulee. \\n\\nFor $50 (including tax+tip), it's definitely not a meal that I can have every day. To me, the vegetables dishes were the most outstanding and definitely affordable. The different elements in each dish made sense and worked well together. Service was brilliant from start to finish, everyone was friendly, helpful, and my water glass was never left empty.

As a native of NYC who spent many years in Boston, I've been blessed to experience some of the best Italian fare. \\n\\nI've heard great things about Bella Italia by my local friends. Suffice to say, I was skeptical as I have not had decent Italian in Florida in 15 years of living here and I asked myself what do my friends know, they're not even Italian, just wannabe Paisans. I was, however, craving Italian, so decided to give this place a try. First the rustic Italian bread came out. OMG! It was dense, crispy and wonderfully chewy on the outside and the inside was super fluffy and moist. How could this be I thought to myself - they don't have NY water - do they? So I quickly drank my glass of water and, surprisingly, it tasted like NY water.\\n\\nMy skepticism was subsiding and I ordered the Sicilian Arancini as my first appetizer. They were perfectly cheesy, crispy, delicious balls from Heaven. Thought I was in the streets of Sicily for a moment. \\n\\nI next ordered the fried Calamari and they were incredibly tender and fresh and the marinara sauce was super legit. I ordered the Frutti di Mare as my entree and replaced spaghetti with linguini and changed the sauce to Fra Diavolo. The linguini was cooked to perfection, the shrimp were fresh and large, the calamari, mussels and clams were clean and tasty and the sauce had the perfect blend of tomatoes, sugar, acidity and heat.\\n\\nI finished off my dinner with a homemade Cheesecake and I was instantly transported back home to NY. My wife had the veggie pie and loved it. My friends ordered the fettuccini carbonara and chicken piccata and shared some with me and both dishes were delish. The owner Dorina is super sweet and came over a few times throughout the night to check on us.  \\n\\nI will definitely be a regular, loyal customer.

Between the burgers, the Ahi Tuna burger was definitely more refreshing and had many components to it that complemented each other's flavor. Probably the favorite out of the two burgers we got.

We are at 3.5 - since I rounded up last time, I will round down this time. \\n\\nThe trick is to get there before the lunch rush, not during SxSW week, park in the garage behind them, as they will validate and substitute the Bison patty (extra $2) in place of the beef on any burger. It was more flavorful. I split the Magic Shroom burger, and I must say that adding toppings pimps up the taste. Not sure I would have combined mayo and pesto (so I asked for it on the side). The pesto made a good dipping sauce for one of my friends fries. \\n\\nThe fries were less salty and must have been good, because there were none left on the ones I split, so I moved to the person across the table and started snagging hers. \\n\\nThe staff was much more attentive and cheerfully accommodated our party of 10 on 2 tables across from each other, even though we were not all there (I think early arrival was key here). \\n\\nThe trick is also to dine in the company of some fabulous and fun folks. \\n\\nIt is still pricey for what you get, after tip, my upgraded bison Magic Shroom burger and fries were $16. I split the food, so my half was $8. While I may go back in a group, not sure I would suggest for a group.

If you are looking for a fancy modern pizzeria, this is not the place for you.

The most modern thing in the kitchen are the cans of soda, the cash register is exactly that, and orders are written down on a sheet of paper. Pictures of famous athletes, especially famous boxers adorned the walls of the dining area. If you have been there before you know exactly what I am talking about, but if you haven't it's something you have to see to understand. The staff were polite and helped me out with understanding their limited menu and the nature of the place itself after I told them it was my first visit.

They have an all you can eat sausage buffet called the autobahn. That enough is worth 5 stars. But this fairly priced buffet isn't only about the sausage, it's also about the sides. Basic buffet strategy tells you to start with the meat, rather than the higher margin carb rich sides. Toss that logic to the wind, and macht schnell to the buffet and sample everything. It's wunderbar!\\n\\nThe servers here won't give you the stink eye because you went with the buffet like they do at some places (SS+B at the Olive Garden, yes that means you). Expect your drink refills to be swift and frequent, and your dirty plates to be cleared as you waddle back to the buffet to continue the sausage celebration. \\n\\nDesserts aren't included in the buffet price, but dust off your wallet and pull out your Deutschmarks, because the cream pies are worth every penny and calorie.

I couldn't decide what to get so I was completely slowing our table down, but finally I decided with the omelette of the day - smoked salmon with dill cream cheese and potatoes, with a side of rosemary foccasia. Others got the egg with black cod, and les coquette - eggs with bacon and sausages over baked beans.\\nEverything was super delicious, full of flavour and not overly dry. My vanilla latte was perfect, microfoam and all.\\n\\nThe only downpoint to the whole day was the wait for the food - around 45 minutes. even the coffee took about 10... but thank goodness for good conversation over NHL trade frenzy... or else i might have lost my mind because I was starving. My omelette was also last served as it was still \\"3 minutes away from being ready\\" when the other two dishes were placed at our table.\\n\\nI'll still keep coming back :)"},{"name":"Ramen Danbo","address":"1333 Robson Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4.5","text":"This place was so good, the broth so fat and rich with flavor as was the meat that was in the ramen that I finished the entire ramen in less than 10 minutes and had to watch my boyfriend finish his while still drooling."},{"name":"Boston Market","address":"1010 Morrissey Boulevard","city":"Dorchester","stars":"2","text":"The cashier/store manager was friendly and pleasant.

My boyfriend and I we're so excited to have a Mexican restaurant so close! It took us about a month, but finally one Thursday afternoon (3-10-16) we went to lunch all 5 of us for the first time. We ordered the sampler for starters and I did enjoy most of the options on this plate. For an entree I ordered the Pollo Asado, most of the rest of the table got a variation of a quesadilla. My dish was very bland. And the rice tasted almost store bought. The chicken was very plain. I don't know if maybe it was an off day. Or maybe I didn't pick the right first meal but I found myself underwhelmed by the overall experience. \\n\\nPro: It is pretty decorated inside and I can see how it could make for a fun dinner night. \\n\\nI will definitely give them another shot however, I refuse to give up on a place so close!

You have a place to go and munch on something.  Thierry has great vibes and looks really pretty on the inside (along with their display cases) but their customer service and the flavour is just not there.  For a French patisserie inspired location, they have macarons that shouldn't be served to anyone who is a macaron connoisseur like myself. They are dense, have lots of bubbles, crack easily and the cream on the inside isn't delicate; they're very clunky macarons which are more similar to the macaroon cousin.\\n\\nTheir desserts look quite pretty but once again the flavour is lacking. They are either too dry, too wet, too sweet or not sweet enough.  However, if you're not as picky with sweets as I am then perhaps Thierry is the place for you because like I said before, they are open late and have a great vibe.

It is simple, but the cream cheese icing is bomb. The Black out is SO dense, so if you want a chocolate explosion, go for that one. The Nutty Valentine reminds me of a nutella strawberry crepe and the flying pig is a meal with bacon and maple syrup icing. \\n\\nThe only thing I didn't like about this place was that they serve the coffee in mason jars, like, I get that it's style and it's cute, but when you serve hot coffee to the brim in a mason jar, it makes it really hard to drink.

Either you're all plainly wrong or I'm losing my mind and since I'm not prepared to concede the latter then I have some bad news. This place should not be on any list other than perhaps a barely decent neighborhood bistro. The food is ok; fresh bread comes to the table (not warm) with cold butter. The starter salad was ok but felt out of balance. The richness of the brie covered toast was not adequately set against the freshness of the salad. The most disappointing dish of the night was the steak frites. They served 'french fries' and not the delightfully thin cut fries that you would get in a bistro in Montreal or Paris. I could get these fries anywhere. The steak was tough and as such was precut to help slide it down and the peppercorn sauce was so sparse and inoffensive I had to lower my head to the plate to make sure it was even there. Additionally, the fries were served with some homemade concoction of mayo and dijon, which also was totally out of balance and actually rather lacking in flavor. \\n\\nService is brisk and a little snooty (assuring me incorrectly their brand of bubbly water is better than the one I ordered - it wasn't). \\n\\nThe room was busy and full of energy, and everyone else seemed completely unaware that they were partaking in both a sub par bistro and dining experience. I used to think that Vancouver foodies wouldn't let anything other than a fabulous place make it but Les Faux Bourgeois proves that to be untrue because it's simply not a great place and you deserve better."},{"name":"Baretto","address":"10710 Research Blvd, Ste 314","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Small, cozy neighborhood spot.

This is the reason I do not write reviews.  No one wants my four star reviews.  To get five stars out of me is no easy task.  \\n\\nFast forward to last Tuesday Evening...  My neighbor / best friend, surprised my wife and I saying he and his Fiance were going to get married on Saturday (just 3 days later) and wanted us to be witnesses to this.  I asked if it was going to be just going \\"to the courthouse\\" and how that would work on a Saturday.  They informed us that they were going to do it at home in a very small ceremony.  I immediately needed details, what time, what would the food be, what would they let me do to help (I am obsessive about details)...  I asked about what their plan was for the cake?  Was told they had no idea!  So Wednesday morning bright and earlier I was on the phone with JaCiva's ordering a 9\\" wedding cake for the estimated 16-18 people who would be coming.  VERY accommodating and were able to squeeze a cake in for Saturday morning pickup.  Fast forward to Thursday when I was informed that the head count was actually 16 Adults and 10 kids!!!  I call JaCiva's and they were able to add a dozen cupcakes with icing to match the wedding cake that were ready to be picked up when the cake was ready!\\n\\nI can not say enough wonderful things about this establishment!  For a bakery to make a good cake goes without saying.  For a bakery to stay in business as long as they have, it goes without saying that their able to make pastries correctly.  But to just go SO FAR ABOVE AND BEYOND!!!  EVERY SINGLE TIME my family needs a cake in the future I will be ordering and driving over from Vancouver to pick one up from them!"},{"name":"Baretto","address":"10710 Research Blvd, Ste 314","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I met some friends here around five to grab a quick drink and exchange some good books. Well, one drink turned into appetizers and good conversation. \\n\\nThis place is a hidden gem. Apparently it used to be the Brick oven pizza's party room. My friend who lives down the street described to me what the place used to look like compared to now and it's night and day. They installed brick on the walls, added tables and a nice bar. \\n\\nWe had a combo charcuterie board: meat and cheese. It was delightful. It had some yummy little tiny peppers. We saw lots of good food coming out of the kitchen. You can order from the pizza place next door as well. \\n\\nI live in south austin and would definitely be a regular here if it were closer. I will certainly be back for another book exchange with friends, more great food and another five dollar happy hour drink. \\n\\nHappy hour was until 7 btw!"},{"name":"The Painted Pin","address":"737 Miami Cir NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"*DETAILED REVIEW* Worth the read!\\n\\nLet's start off by saying the Painted Pin is a great place. The reason I'm giving a 3 star review is based on a combination of service, parking, and amenities...so let's begin!\\n\\nOverall, the Painted Pin is a nice location for date nights, hanging out with friends, or a more \\"adult\\" atmosphere for bowling. They have nice lanes, with very comfy cigar sofas, as well as other play areas free of charge. So if it's so nice, why the 3 stars? Well, let's get into that now...\\n\\n1. Parking\\nIf this is the first time you've gone to The Painted Pin, then you would not be aware that there parking is Valet parking tip option that's actually in front of their establishment. When my husband and I arrived, GPS pinned us at the Paid parking area, which also has a man with a flag waiving everyone to him. We had no idea he WAS NOT apart of Painted Pin. We actually lucked out and found street parking right in front of the building...free of charge! \\n\\n2. Lanes\\nIf you do not have a party of 6+ or more...get ready to be pared with another party and share a small area/table at your lane. You also have to share the balls. I was irritated bc the other party kept taking the ball I was using all night. I had to wait for them to bowl to steal back the ball I was using. Also, the table to share was so small. Food plates were on top of each other. We almost accidentally ate from someone else's plate. Hated it! \\n\\n3. Customer Service & Check In\\nMy husband checked us all in. We walked around while we waited for the others to come, and saw 3 empty lanes. We got there before the big rush, so nobody was bowling on these lanes. We requested one of them, and the tall brown haired girl was extremely short with my husband. She was a real ... and told my husband NO...NO...NO. No explanation WHY we couldn't chose those lanes...just a dry and nasty NO! She put us on the lane we DIDNT want that was congested and right by the front door. Ok, whatever. \\n\\n4. Ok here's the finale!\\nWe got our checks and they didn't split the tickets. We got them to split the ticket down the middle. They did that. My husband did not leave a tip on the paper, we left cash, and a tip with the bartender (the service was also sooooooooo slow to get a drink) so we get our notice from our bank, and they added a $30 tip to our bill. Are you serious?!? That's stealing!!!! We asked our friend what their charges was, and his was right. They helped themselves to our money! We are still disputing this with our bank as I'm writing this. \\n\\nAll in all...it's a nice place. The food is decent, the drinks are not worth the money. They are weak and watered down. I probably won't come back, unless I'm invited for an occasion. Otherwise, this was my first, and last time visiting. I'm sure your experience may be way different than ours...but first impressions are lasting impressions for me!"},{"name":"Chipotle Mexican Grill","address":"9600 S Interstate 35, Ste S350","city":"Austin","stars":"2.5","text":"This is one of the worst Chipolte Grills.

It seemed as if it was just heated up. \\nBoyfriend liked his corned beef breakfast dish a lot, but we had to go to the outside tables before we got our food because my eyes starting reacting poorly to the cooking oil in the air.

The Fusiili we had with the meals was excellent as well. Service was above expectations and they really do take care of your every need.

I either heard wrong or was expertly trolled, one of the two possibly both. Their fried chicken was an affront to my southern sensibilities. It tasted like someone took a chicken roast recipe and poorly applied it to a friend chicken recipe. It was disappointing, not very good, and  was not reflective of what real southern fried chicken should taste like- at all. Their mac and cheese tastes identical to the frozen stuff you get at Publix. No exaggeration either- I brought some of the Coop's mac home and busted out a frozen mac I had in the freezer. Served both to my friends and nobody could discern the difference between the two. You can't call yourself a southern kitchen if you can't even produce a decent mac and cheese. However, I will say the bread pudding was pretty good, so one star for that. Given how this place was voted \\"best southern food\\" and its affiliation with 4 Rivers, I expected something authentic, quality, and good (for fast casual) but sadly, my expectations did not meet reality as I only received a sad example of what southern food should never attempt to be. Maybe I went on an off day. Maybe whoever is responsible for prep/cooking the food was sick that day. Who knows? All I know is this place is insanely over hyped.

Why is it so hard to find a good pretzel in this town? I think it's because lye is pretty unattainable these days (THANKS METH LABS) and apparently that's what makes a good pretzel.\\nSo, if you like pretzels, don't order one here. It's not a pretzel. It's bread. In a pretzel shape. AND to make matters worse, mine was incredibly under-cooked, I'm talking raw dough in the middle. My friend's pretzel was cooked through, but we were both bummed that we just got bread and cheese. Hmpf.\\n\\nAlso a culprit in my mediocre experience:\\n\\nWe decided to sit outside because it was a nice day, there were three open tables and they were all dirty. So we ended up bussing our own table. Eh. \\n\\nDuck confit nachos: great idea in theory, totally lacking in execution. They were kind of cold. Lacking a lot of duck. Could have been waaaay better. Especially for $12. \\n\\nSince you have to go inside to order (I knew this before coming here, so whatever) my darling boyfriend let me order on his behalf. I got him the quiche of the day, however I left the menu outside. In my opinion, quiche is quite heavy and tastes the best with salad. Which is what I thought it came with. The bartender asks me \\"Do you want it with hash?\\" and I reply \\"what are my other options?\\" and he goes \\"You want it with hash.\\" But the thing is, I DIDN'T WANT IT WITH HASH. However, since I didn't have the menu, I didn't really know what to do and kind of panicked and the bartender disappeared.... sigh. So, my boyfriend was disappointed with his meal. And the hash. Ugh. \\n\\nWe also tried the grilled ham and cheese, and the hot dog, and those were both considerably good. Pretty much the only thing that saved this place from one star in my book.\\n\\nWhile I don't mind going inside to order, I do mind having dirty plates and glasses sitting on my table for an extended period of time. We had an obscene amount of flies that wouldn't leave us alone due to this. Not very fun. \\n\\nAnd then there's the tip situation. What do I tip? You brought me the food, yes. You bussed my table after we got the check? No one really waited on us? But then I hate tipping low?

Upon arrival, I immediately noticed that some changes had been made here. They removed 90% of the fun, eclectic seating that made this place so special (in my opinion). The decor was changed, all of the books and games were no longer there. What once was a seat yourself kind of establishment was replaced by a hostess. This doesn't bother me much, but it does add to the feeling of drastic change here. Waited about 10 min for an order of fries to-go, with maybe 3 or 4 tables being occupied on a slow day. Keep this in mind and call ahead to order take-out, especially if you plan on getting a full meal. Service was still friendly, food was still delicious, but the overall aesthetic that had me gushing about this place was totally stripped from the establishment. Besides all of that, do bear in mind that this place is pretty pricey... which used to be fine with me, because of the ambiance. But $11 for an order of fries in just a regular old restaurant is a little steep in my opinion. Coffee was more expensive than starbucks... Overall, as an occasional treat, this place may still make my list. However, due to the drastic changes, I can say that this won't be a go-to brunch spot I frequent or recommend.

We still ate everything. \\nWe ordered the scallion pancake, pork dumplings, wild boar dan dan noodles, fried rice with shrimp and pork topped with crispy shallots, coconut cream pie, and crispy crunchy sundae. The appetizers were so good, one person in my group said it was their fav thing on the table. \\nThe dan dan noodles were perfection, a little spicy but you can still taste all the flavors, my fav dish. The fried rice was ok, kind of had to grow on you. We asked for the egg to be incorporated into the dish instead of on top, but found the sauce on top to overwhelm the dish. There's also a spice I couldn't put my finger on that gave it a funky after taste. The beef and broccoli could have been magical, but the short ribs were tough. The ribs were super tasty but the toughness was hard to get past; the Chinese broccoli was amazing and almost made up for the tough meat. This last entree was the reason for the missing 5th star.

One word that will change your life... if you try it here :D \\nOh my goodness this was probably the best barbecue we've ever had. I'm not being dramatic either when I say that. We travel a lot and if barbecue is on the menu, we try it.\\n\\nThis is a family owned business that make a ton of pit-smoked meats. The selection of meats and sides is INCREDIBLE. I came here with my husband on a Sunday and the wait was only about 40 minutes. We originally wanted to try Franklin's because of how much it has been recommended but we did not have time to wait in line for the estimated 4 hours that people say they've waited. \\n\\nTo be honest, I can't imagine how much better the barbecue could have been. Terry Black's had us drooling the entire time we were in line and we somehow managed to spend $85 for lunch, for the two of us. WHAT!? Okay, okay but let me tell you everything we got and why it was worth it:\\n\\n-One pound sliced brisket \\n-Beef rib\\n- 1/3 pound of the turkey to try\\n-Smoked sausage\\n-Pint of potato salad\\n-5 oz Mac n cheese\\n-5 oz beans\\n-Mini pecan pie to top it all off (duh) \\n(We also got a few waters/cokes)\\n\\nMy favorite thing we had was the beef rib. I would normally never order that but it was highly recommended so we tried it. It literally MELTED off the bone and I could hardly keep it on my fork. It had the most smokiness to it and it was the most moist. The flavor was in space somewhere because it was out of this world!! The brisket was my next favorite, then the sausage, then the turkey. All of the meats were packed with a smokey flavor but again, the beef rib was by far the best. \\n\\nMy favorite side was the potato salad. It was seasoned so well and they topped it off with paprika which was a great compliment. The mac n' cheese was creamy but not the best I've had. Same goes for the beans. We were surprised that the beans didn't deliver the flavor we were expecting and probably wouldn't get them again. I will note on a side note, that the ENDLESS pickles in their little condiment bar was amazing. Maybe it's because I'm obsessed with pickles but they were such crisp and crunchy dill pickles that seemed like they were freshly sliced.\\n\\nDid we have leftovers? Yes, lots.

We used to go to the Brookline Village location, but have been coming to the South End more often since we moved out of the city. The menus are pretty much the same, and the only real difference (other than geography and ease of parking) is that the South End location seems a bit more spacious inside.\\n\\nPerhaps the best thing I can say about Barcelona is that after 10-15 trips, I've only had one tapa that I wouldn't re-order, and that's more that it wasn't my cup of tea rather than any issue with taste or presentation. For a first-timer, I recommend the albondigas, the truffle bikini, the hanger steak and the patatas bravas. These are my stand-bys, and I usually order some combination of these every trip, along with mixing in some new choices. You really can't go wrong - try some items out of your comfort zone as the whole menu is well-prepared and interesting.\\n\\nIn terms of drinks, this is a wine bar, so the wine list speaks for itself. Beyond that, there is a solid beer selection (although the draft choices are a bit limited - mostly bottles and cans for the good stuff) and an outstanding cocktail list. If you're a whiskey drinker, I recommend the Bourbon Spice Rack. One minor criticism - my wife is a huge sangria fan in general, but really dislikes the sangria here (she thinks it tastes like fruit punch). No problem though as she always gets wine or a cocktail instead.\\n\\nThe waitstaff and overall service is top-notch, and the management really tries to make sure you have a great visit. On one occasion, they couldn't find our reservation that was made a few weeks prior (it happens), but the manager not only fit us in on a busy Saturday night, he got us a great table and a few free tapas for our troubles.

I remember everything from the sauce, taste, customer service and portions being good.\\n\\n\\nYesterday we decided to go again. I give it a 3/5 because overall the meal was good but not fantastic. I ordered the prime beef combo which cost $21 and my bf got the meatball combo which cost $18. Mine came with 6 slices of super thin beef and his came with 10 pieces of frozen fish balls. They both came with small bowl of veggies (3/4 of the bowl was cabbage), choice of udon or rice, choice of green/black/fruit tea and soft serve for after your meal. \\n\\nCUSTOMER SERVICE: We went at 2pm therefore the restaurant was quite empty. The waitress was was attentive to us but didn't bug us every second. When we got our bill at the end of the meal, she charged us for items that we didn't receive.

The beef was super super thin and they rolled it to make it look like there was way more than it actually is. The bowl of veggies consist of mainly cabbage (3/4 of the bowl).

I always remember not being able to finish everything because there was so much food. But this time, I was able to finish everything but not super full.\\n\\nPRICE: Their prices has also gone up quite a bit. I completely understand that food costs go up. I used to enjoy this place because it was an affordable joint that gave customers a good bang for your buck. However the price didn't justify the quality and quantity.\\n\\nDIPPING SAUCE: Their sauce just tasted bland. It just tasted like a combination of Chinese 5 spice and oil. They give you one little portion of sauce and they charge you if you want more. Unfortunate for sauce lovers.

This seems like a bad way to run a business, that they should accommodate the customer if they can.  The other thing I didn't like (but perhaps they would have accomodated if I had asked) was that I had a marsala sauced chicken dish, but my side of pasta came with red sauce on it... not a fan of mixing the two!

I arrived just before 6 pm on a Tuesday. This location is nestled above the Whole Foods. \\n\\nI started off with a happy hour appetizer of Coconut Calamari ($4.5 discount) and a Oban single malt. The calamari is well cooked with a faint coconut essence I don't believe comes from the breading, but the shredded coconut it's topped with. This was sort of a letdown as I would like to see it incorporated into the breading as well. The dipping sauce paired with it, has a slight sweetness and very mild pepper bite. It surprisingly went well with the calamari, but slightly overpowered the delicate flavor. Overall I recommend this dish as it was prepared. I rly and not overcooked and rubbery like can easily be done. \\n\\nFor main course, I ordered the Surf & Turf. At $36 this honestly seems to be a steal with the 7oz sirloin and lobster tail. The plate came out and the lobster was a partial knuckle and small amount of extra meat, bolstered by Shrimp. The shrimp and very small amount of lobster was cooked in a wine base, where the lobster was overcooked but shrimp was not. The Surf portion of this meal was very underwhelming, but I see why it's priced at $36 instead of $46 or more. \\n\\nThe steak was ordered Med-Rare and it came out perfect. Over all the meal was very tasty, the lobster \\"sauce\\" was flavorful but not bisque like as in the description.

I recently went to Punjab Palace in a Friday night for dinner with 3 friends. We didn't have a reservation, but happily agreed to wait 5-10 minutes for our table. We were seated fairly quickly and had high hopes for our experience as we have gotten food from here delivered in the past and thoroughly enjoyed it. However, our experience here was quite possibly the worst I have ever had. We waited almost 10 minutes for our server to take our drink orders and we also ordered some naan. Our server brought our drinks and took our food orders. We all ordered pretty standard things, no modifications or anything. Approximately 15 minutes went by and we finally got our naan. This and the fact that I hadn't seen any food being served to other patrons should have been a sign that our Punjab Palace experience was about to take a terrible turn. After waiting 45 minutes after placing our food order, we flagged down our server to ask if our food was almost done, he said it would be out soon. 15 minutes pass and we have not been waiting an hour and many other people still have not received their food either. Once again we ask our server for an update, not even to be rude but just because at this point we were so hungry. Our server told us that the kitchen was just finishing up takeout orders and was about to start cooking orders for dine in. As someone who has worked in restaurants before, I was appalled. An hour wait and they hadn't even started on our food yet? I completely understand being busy/slammed and not being able to keep up with orders, but making your customers wait over an hour and telling them that takeout orders were being prioritized is ridiculous. We continued to wait for another 15-20 minutes because we figured by this point we might as well stick it out. After waiting over an hour and 20 minutes for 4 entrees, we asked our server once more for an update because by now I felt like I was ready to pass out from not eating. He couldn't even give us an update on our food. Extremely frustrated and hungry, we decided to leave and called in an order from a pizza place down the street, which was ready for us by the time we walked over to pick it up. Needless to say, I won't be returning to Punjab Palace after this incredibly upsetting experience."},{"name":"Thierry","address":"1059 Alberni Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Perhaps the cafe has gotten too popular that my love for this place has gone away.

What made it awkward was that there is limited space where you can wait for your drink. It's super cramped and there's no space to stand. \\n\\nThe mille-feuille really wasn't that good. Sure the flaky pastry layers were fine, but the 'vanilla bean' cream filling was way too sweet.

The smoked and fried butternut squash was up next, and it was amazing. The smoke flavor on the first bite was completely unexpected and blended amazingly with all the other ingredients in the dish. Third came the shitake soup dumplings, which were the best experience of the entire night. The flavors when they burst inside our mouths woke up taste buds we didn't know we had. Lastly, we tried the goat with tortillas, which was solidly good but not unexpectedly so. The shiitake dumplings were definitely the favorite, closely followed by the butternut squash.

I went with the lamb fir fir - a large plate of lamb and spice-soaked injera served between more injera. The spice was just right so as to not take over my tastebuds and cause me to break out in sweats. I tried Acelyn's ribeye tibs. YUM!

I have never been so disappointed, frustrated and generally disturbed by a restaurant.\\n\\nI looked through the reviews of this place, and seeing one with photos from 2008, it is obvious that in the past six years the restaurant has taken a turn for the worse.  Chairs stacked everywhere, dirty tablecloths, and a general unkempt appearance made me question my decision immediately.  \\n\\nNow, I am used to eating great food in dumpy places, but the whole vibe was off here.  Of the three adults in the place, 2 were watching telenovelas on the large  TV in back, one was working the kitchen, and two very young children were running the place.  \\n\\nThe menus are horribly out of date.  No margaritas, the only beer was Heineken (Heineken?!) and many crossed out food items and price changes.  \\n\\nThe service was very poor.  The young boy who took our orders and brought us food could not have been over 14, knew very little about the menu and had no desire to make you feel as if they appreciated us being there.  The girl at the front counter was absorbed in her smartphone.  We felt neglected and generally unwelcome.\\n\\nOf the four of us there, one ordered a soda, and was told to go grab it out of the cooler in back.  When he came back we looked at the lid and there was a dead fly on the lip of the can.  Not good.  The salsa had good flavor but was very watery, and the chips were stale. \\n\\nWhen the food came, the steak fajita meat was tough and dry, and the guacamole was liquid puree. We were never checked up on, as the kids had better things to do, and everyone else was bust watching TV.\\n\\nI only ate a few bites and decided it was time to leave.

I have been here now 5 times since discovering it and have yet to be disappointed. The staff is super friendly and for a pizza/sub/pasta joint the food is delicious!  Also I had ordered the baked shrimp and haddock meal which is awesome but the best part about their dinners is that when you ask for salad, they give you a full size meal kind of salad not one of those little side salads that other places give you. I ended up having it for lunch the next day.  Also you can't beat their specials on Mondays and Wednesdays.  I just ordered the Chicken Ziti Broccoli and the Shrimp Scampi Pasta- my final bill is under $10!!  They run a half off Pasta special on Wednesdays so I figured I'd give it a try!  Going to go pick up my order now!  Oh I almost forgot!!  If you like shrimp then order the Shrimp Scampi Pizza - they give you full size real shrimp soooo yummy!  Enjoy!\\n\\nJust a follow up - on another visit there I noticed that they microwave the pasta dishes and told one of the girls at the counter that I wasn't comfortable with that practice because you're not suppose to microwave in take out plastic with its cover. She proceeded to tell another girl at the counter who pretty much was a BITCH to me and proceeded  to tell me that it was microwave safe etc and they always prepare the pasta dishes ahead of time and freeze them because they're so busy......I understand their need to freeze ahead of time but I won't eat their pasta anymore.   The girl I initially spoke to was very nice.   If you order the pasta you will see for yourself that the plastic is so hot after it has been heated that it isn't safe to eat.

I believe they are the longest standing restaurant in the food court and the most popular of the 3.  You can usually expect a little wait for your food when ordering here.  I'm giving these guys 4 stars mainly for the value to quality ratio.  I probably wouldn't say it is the best korean food I've ever had by any means, but when you consider the price, it is pretty good.  I've tried the Dolsot Bibimbap, Bibimbap, Pa Jeon, JjamPeong, mackarel, and Bulgogi with possibly the Bulgogi dish being the worst of the bunch.  I'm thinking some of the low reviews for this place are due to the fact that bulgogi is what most people know about korean food therefore when they order this dish, I would also probably give this restaurant a 3 star or less review as well.  \\nThe highlights for me are the dolsot bibimbap, mackarel, and the Pa Jeon with seafood.  I think all these dishes here are as good as anywhere else and anywhere from a few dollars to quite a bit cheaper than you'll find at the other korean restaurants in town especially when you consider the prices here include tax.  As far as the bulgogi, I rarely order this at any korean restaurant because it is over priced and it is actually quite simple to make at home for a fraction of the cost.  I prefer doing this because most places over sweeten their bulgogi anyways.\\nThe free egg drop soup they offer is also a nice touch.  The soup actually tastes decent and gives you something to snack on while you wait.\\nThe establishment is cash only, or you can go in the market and pay there and bring the receipt.  \\nIf you are coming expecting top notch bulgogi, then yes you will probably be disappointed.

I ordered the ahi tuna poke plate with their slaw which, different from most coleslaw, is oil-based rather than mayo. The tuna was very fresh, juicy and flavorful. It comes with soy sauce and spicy mayo sauce which I didn't find necessary given the amount of flavor already present in the meal, but the mayo was also great and had a good kick to it.\\n\\nThe coconut shrimp my friend ordered was crispy and juicy, with a light coconut flavor that was not too overwhelming.

The first time I ate here was on a hot and rainy day in the Animal Kingdom in summer 2010, and we happened upon this restaurant and decided, why not? It is enclosed and has air conditioning, so it would provide protection from the rain and heat for a couple hours, and the food was a bonus. But oh my goodness, I was blown away by how delicious the food was! I normally have no expectations for food in an amusement park, because it usually consists of your regular pizza, burgers, and hot dogs, none of which are particularly noteworthy. But Yak & Yeti is the complete opposite: it is a gourmet restaurant that serves delicious Southeast Asian food, and as someone who is Southeast Asian ethnically, I can tell you that the food here is authentic. The dish I ordered that blew my mind away is the Malaysian Seafood Curry, which is a seafood medley in a red curry and coconut stew with jasmine rice. The curry stew combination is absolutely delicious! I'm not a fan of coconut, but its use along with the curry gave a slight sweetness to the curry that really brought out the flavors of the seafood. I was so floored by this dish that I knew that if I ever came back to the Animal Kingdom, I would have to come to Yak & Yeti and have this dish again, and voila five years later I did! The dish is just as tasty as I remembered from five years ago, but unfortunately I couldn't finish it -- this is definitely a dish meant for two people.

After placing our order, the food was delivered in less than 5 minutes. They definitely don't mess around which is good. I expect no nonsense from counter service restaurants. It's the type of place I frequent when I don't have a bunch of time or when the kids are in tow. \\n\\nSo in record speed, two epic shrimp tacos were placed before me. I noted how beautiful they looked when served. This surprised me as I expected a sloppy mess considering it's a fast food taco but alas my expectations were exceeded. That first bite distributed a nice even amount of protein to topping ratio. A generous number of shrimp housed a fresh bed of slaw and pico topping. I absolutely loved that slaw. I'm not entirely sure what ingredients were used but they were so crisp and bright. The produce tasted like it was just picked from the farm. Whatever dressing used to bind it was another noteworthy flavor. It was creamy and just a nice match for the acidic tomatoes. So yummy! The only issue I take with the tacos is the actual vehicle for the delicious fillings. The TORTILLAS! They were weak if I am being honest. They tasted like something I expect to get off the shelves from Publix. Definitely not a quality tortilla. They weren't even served warm. Had they been, it would've been a close to perfect taco. But my solution is to try a bowl next time! Maybe rice will be a better companion for those delicious toppings. Otherwise the salsas and guac were above average and enjoyable for chip dippin. \\n\\nI plan on being a regular at jimmy hula's in my future as an Altamonte Springs resident.

The tenderloin + shrimp was excellent and came with a surprisingly delicious serving of mac & cheese croquette.

I'm pretty sure that the flavor is good, but I really can't tell when it's so cool. :(\\nSecond, the single size pricing just doesn't make sense. I bring my own sealable 12oz container so I can bike with it. It's silly that there's no payment option for the most normal size coffee in the US. This means that I have to pay for more coffee than I actually receive. Most places not only charge me for a 12oz cup, they give me a small discount since I have my own, reusable cup. \\nThird, those are some hiiiigh prices. As a Pacific Northwest native, I've come to accept coffee as my supreme master, and am willing to pay far too much for it. But not that much.

The bread they served with dinner was crunchy and warm, and the fresh olive oil and basil was a nice touch. For my entree I had stuffed shells. Their sauce is absolutely delicious and the shells were great as well. I had a taste of my mom's veal Parmesan (SO good) and my husbands shimp fra diavolo (just the right amount of heat).

In my head, I imagining burgers but instead of patties, sushi on the inside. Not quite, more like surf and turf sushi or burgers next to sushi but it was nevertheless still pretty good. \\n\\nWe came at 11am, right as they opened and were seated in one of their very spacious booths. Since we had young children in our party, the hostess gave us boxes of crayons, coloring pages (that were each different) and chopstick trainers (very cool and something I hadn't really seen outside of Asia). The kids of course loved it, which was nice because it kept them occupied while we went through the VERY extensive menu.\\n\\nOur waitress was very attentive and came by to explain everything about the menu since it was our first time. She also brought us children's cups that have a top and straw so they don't have to worry about spilling. Us adults decided to start off with the lobster and crab spring roll, which came out beautifully presented. I think I was hoping for more lump crab or lobster chunks but overall the taste was pretty good and the sauce drizzled along the bottom of the plate had a nice flavor.\\n\\nMeanwhile, my friend ordered a PB&J bento box for her 3 year old daughter off the kid's menu and it was fantastic. The PB&J was rolled up and cut like a sushi roll so that was a lot of fun. It also came with perfectly cooked fries, some orange slices and a rice krispie treat with a swedish fish on it, look kinda like a mix between a rice ball and nigiri for the children. Anyways, her 3 year old loved it and had a ball eating it. We all thought the PB&J roll was so clever and couldn't stop eating the poor child's fries because they were so tasty.\\n\\nAs for us, I was also looking forward to a bento box after reading the yelp reviews but their burger of the day didn't sound that good but their specialty rolls did so we decided to just go the roll route. That's when I found out burgushi isn't a burger sushi but rather sushi with meat in it, like a burger. Oh well. So we started off with the turfin'surfer roll and the mad mango-cado roll. The turfin' surfer roll was pretty much a tuna roll topped with filet mignon with scallops. Our waitress asked how we liked our filet cooked, which was a nice touch (we said whatever the chef recommended as usual but I imagine some people may like the option to change). It was pretty good but honestly I think it had a little too much going on so while we enjoyed the concept, we like the mad mango-cado roll better. That was basically a shrimp tempura roll with kani inside, topped with mango, avocado and eel sauce, all my favorite ingredients and in fact it was very good. To the point where we ordered another shrimp tempura based roll because we were still a little hungry. (When we ordered, our waitress said everything came with sides and she can barely finish 5 out of the 8 pieces of an \\"entree roll\\" which is what we got but they didn't actually come with sides and I guess we just eat a lot more than her, haha). Our last roll was the Firecracker roll, which was shrimp tempura and kani inside again, topped with yellow tail, salmon and spicy mayo. Also pretty good.\\n\\nOverall, we got 1 appetizer and 3 rolls for 3 girls at lunch. Honestly I think the prices were a bit high for what we got and so while it was fun to try out, I think I'll stick to my tried and true sushi places since we ended up just getting sushi rolls anyways. Maybe if I had a crew that was split between those who wanted burgers and those who wanted sushi, I'd come back. Or if I knew I could chose one of their specialty burgers for my bento box instead of taking the risk of their burger of the day (knowing it may not always sound that good). The thoughtfulness towards kids was a nice touch though. So even though I personally may wait to come back pending pretty specific circumstances, I still think they deserve 4 stars for very attentive service, great location, extensive menu and overall execution."},{"name":"McDonald's","address":"451 S Goldenrod Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"1.5","text":"This location sucks, service stinks and they never get orders right, super busy and always under staffed.

The chicken was juicy, and liked that for the three-piece dark combo, it was two thighs and a drumstick.  The skin on the chicken wasn't too thick either, as I hate when there's so much batter since I want to taste the meat!  But it was good here.  Pour some Louisiana hot sauce that's on the table, and call it a meal.  My sides were also solid.  The mac and cheese was cheesy and creamy and the collard greens were wilted down with some bacon pieces.  The combo plates also came with a slice of white bread.  \\n\\nAfter trying it myself I can see why Gus' is world famous.  It's definitely a solid fried chicken joint worth checking out if you're near one.  This Austin location was a fun one to visit, with friendly and helpful staff and a night crowd that seemed to be having a good time over chicken and beer.

But the Christmas Market can absolutely be worth the trip (and many return trips) if you plan ahead. Here are my 7 tips for making your visit to the market a jolly good time:\\n\\n1. Buy the Groupon. If you're standing in line right now, it's not too late. The Groupon saves you anywhere from $5 to $14 depending on what package you pick. Now you're already off to a good start!\\n\\n2. Or come on a weekday before 4pm and you get 50% off admission.\\n\\n3. At the ticket counter, spend an extra buck and get a season pass. And that's the magic - you can come back to stroll around on any boring December day you want. No additional charge. Boom! Max merriment for your buck. I've been to the market 3 times this year and with Groupon I only paid 6 bucks total, so I'm getting entry for $2.\\n\\n4. Enter market then drink Gl√ºhwein. (This one is simple, but it is extremely effective at bringing joy.) On Monday nights Gl√ºhwein is $1 off at the shop behind the Carousel.\\n\\n5. Pretend that you are a kid again, and walk through the amazing K√§the Wohlfahrt shop which is essentially a museum of jaw dropping handcrafted beauty. It's not just ornaments and wood crafts, it is artistry and best enjoyed with the look of an astonished 10-year old on your face.\\n\\n6. Do not attempt to go to the Market at prime time unless you love standing in lines. Pretend that the market is closed on Saturday and Sunday. Close your eyes. You can do it.\\n\\n7. To all the Yelpers who argue this place isn't German enough, I say Nein! Go eat some traditional roasted almonds, schnitzel, brats, schnapps, borscht, poffertjes and anything else that is difficult for me to pronounce. And don't let me catch you all in the line for those silly hurricane potato things.\\n\\nBonus tip: If you ask to taste any candy at the Candy Meister shop, they'll give you a sample candy for free."},{"name":"Yard House","address":"825 Battery Ave SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"This place is good if you love sports.

I'd consider this a Texas special so it would be good for a comparison towards other states and their hometown burgers. \\n\\nWe first passed by while walking down the main S Congress street after seeing a long line outside around lunch time. Parking here isn't really difficult, the trick is to just turn into the neighborhoods and park free instead of on the main street. There is also a parking structure located in the back and if you're just picking up, they have 15 minute parking as well. \\n\\nWe had rolled up in the late hours of the night after a long day of gallivanting and ordered to go. The place was still alive and awake with many parties filling the seats. There is an option to sit at the bar. We ordered in the back and had a casual wait, business as usual with a burger joint. \\n\\nThe burgers were juicy and meaty if I do say so myself! You can trust that the brioche buns they use will hold their own and bring the burger together as a whole. We ordered the Prime Time burger (essentially because of the 'kobe beef') and the Magic Shroom Burger. We also had several orders of truffle fries and those were absolute fry-gold! Breaking it down, the Prime Time was a delicious medium cooked 'kobe beef' that really had me going with the truffle aioli sauce. A solid go-to at all times of the day! This would pair well with a nice Perrier or a sarsaparilla. The next burger, Magic Shroom, is great for any mushroom lover who also enjoys the added angus beef. Another great burger to wash down with mexican cola on a hot summer day. Despite my enjoyment of burgers, I have to say that easily my favorite item amongst our meal, was the truffle fries ftw! In a very real sense, parmesan cheese and truffle oil are what make this side dish a strong stand alone which is hard to be disappointed with. All-in-all, I think that any of the burgers here are made with tremendous care and are worth trying out when you get the chance. This was a great meal to binge watch Stranger Things with! \\n\\nThe venue was kept clean and had lots of art directly on the walls inside.

I must get Veracruz like 3 times a week! I'm a girl with a big appetite so I usually go for two tacos. \\n\\nTheir corn tortillas much be house made; they are thicker than normal which holds the taco innards nicely without falling apart. The texture of the corn tortillas is a bit chewy/soft with great flavor. Makes me wonder if they are a corn/wheat mixture.\\n\\nI love their sauces too! I'm a big fan of the creamy orange and creamy green sauces. I called them once to ask what they put in the sauces but the lady on the phone couldn't tell me. That was kind of disappointing; if you work there and answer the phone, you should be able to tell me what ingredients you use; just for those of us who may be trying to avoid wheat or dairy. Also, I usually get the tacos delivered through my Favor app, but once, I went to the actual Veracruz truck on the east side of town... It was a few weeks ago, the beginning of summer so I guess there's not much you can do about it, but there were swarms of flies everywhere! Pretty gross. Couldn't help but imagine those flies the next time I ordered delivery. I won't be eating on site again :P\\n\\nBesides that, amazing flavor.

It's imaginative food that goes beyond the standard recipes, and I appreciate that effort.  I'd love to, and plan to, try the rest of their menu.\\n\\nMy favorite was the pork belly bao.  Super fluffy steamed bao bun, filled with a juicy, savory chunk of pork belly slathered in a tangy, sweet hoisin sauce.  Some daikon cuts through the savory pork with a refreshing, light crunch.\\n\\nThe thai lettuce wraps were tasty and I was happy with them overall, but they lacked some pop, relying on the dipping sauce to add a kick of flavor.  The meat had a fair amount of spice and some nice char on it for crunch.  It could have used some acidity; the menu lists lime as an ingredient, but it wasn't prevalent enough.  Unfortunately there were some splinters of wood in one of our pieces of meat, from the (very) charred stick they cook it on.  The lettuce came on the side with some cilantro, deconstructed.\\n\\nThe shrimp & grits had potential, and almost got there, but fell short.  The shrimp were great, but the grits stumbled. I like the addition of the liquid smoke, but it was just way too heavy-handed.  It was like eating a campfire.  A bit too oily as well, the oil ended up pooling in the surface.  The green tomato chunks were tangy and flavorful: a good compliment to the salty, savory grits.  The dish wasn't bad; but less liquid smoke and a little less oil would have made it a lot better.\\n\\nChicken and waffles were tasty and generally a success.  Juicy chicken covered in a thin layer of sweet, spicy, sticky glaze.  The waffles themselves tasted like regular waffles, but the combination of the sesame butter and the syrup gave them the creative kick that made it unique... Would have liked to see a little more of both on the plate, maybe even in cups on the side.  The waffles are billed as \\"ginger waffles\\", but I didn't taste much ginger at all.  A heavier dose of ginger would have set the waffles on a new level, allowing them to stand on their own without relying on the butter or syrup.  Our waffles were almost too cooked, would have liked to see them a little less dark, but they were still far enough away from being burned.\\n\\nFor dessert, I tried the lemon-ginger mousse.  It came with a big ole fortune cookie.  I enjoyed the mousse, but like the chicken dish, I struggled to taste the ginger in it.  The sour of the lemon was far more present than the spice of the ginger, and it tasted sort of like whipped lemon yogurt.  I'd love to see the same dessert with extra ginger to give it more spice to compliment the overpowering sour of the lemon.  The cookie itself was great, and provided a crunchy texture to the soft, fluffy mousse.\\n\\nI've had my fair share of thai milk tea, and I can give my stamp of approval on theirs.  Seems like they brew it themselves and add the milk, instead of using a mix or powder, so that was great.\\n\\nThe atmosphere is lively and energetic.  Some of the tables are in an odd position with lots of passing traffic (as was my case), which is a little annoying when every customer walking by brushes your table with their coat.\\n\\nAll of the staff were super polite and very helpful.\\n\\nI'll be back for sure."},{"name":"Mama Nems","address":"805 S Kirkman Rd, Ste 106","city":"Orlando","stars":"3","text":"the smothered fried chicken was soo good!!\\nthe oxtail wasn't as tender as i hoped it to be.\\ngot to try out the red velvet cakes next time. :o)"},{"name":"Mana Escondido Caf√©","address":"68 Aguadilla St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Understand that a five star rating is relative, but this little place was a delightful surprise.

The salmon croquettes were light and flavorful with the lemon/onion sauce, and were probably the best dish we ordered. The oysters were good but standard. We had asked for a vinaigrette as I don't like seafood sauce with my oysters. We were told they didn't have any but after we finished we saw that another table was offered the vinaigrette. The tuna poke was the most disappointing dish with only 5 very small pieces of tuna and about 5 pieces of watermelon. The sauce was light and tasty, similar to what tuna poke tastes like but the watermelon was very deceiving.

Unfortunately the restaurant food experience didn't quite live up to the supper club food. The fried chicken seemed a little less peppery than we had originally tasted and it was soggy. This is not a good thing where fried chicken is concerned. If I am going to sacrifice the calorie hit I want a great crunchy coating. I will say that my at home reheated leftovers did crunch up and we enjoyed them more than the original. The creamed corn was, if such a thing is possible, too creamy and really needed something to balance out the flavors. The cornbread had a pretty strong smokiness to it that would have made more sense at their sister BBQ restaurants. I would have preferred a straight forward sweet cornbread. While nothing special the mac & cheese was perfectly fine. However all sins were forgiven with the first mouthful of the cinnamon bun bread pudding (available as a side item - not a dessert).

As far as the vermicelli dish, it was similar to most of the Pho places around town.. The pork sandwich had better pork in it than Tam Deli or Lily's sandwich, but it was kinda dry. I liked Tam's better because of the sauce.  This place has the typical lightning-fast service that I find unique to Vietnamese Pho places in Austin.. They drop off a menu to you and circle back literally within 2 minutes and ask \\"are you ready\\".. If you are not, they come back every 2 minutes until you give up and order. Perfect for those that know what they want, not good for anyone that isn't familiar..

My husband and I were on a date night one Thursday night and had heard this place was good, so we decided to try it out. I'm SO glad we did. \\n\\nHaving a full-blooded Italian grandmother who cooked me homemade food almost every day of the week, I know good authentic Italian food. The food here was delicious. Before our move here a few weeks ago, I lived in Texas for 12 years (after being raised in NY with good Italian food) and the Italian food there (in TX) was meh. There was one place that was good, but it took me 10 years to find it. \\n\\nBella Italia was a quaint, charming place, but also good for kids. I love chicken parm, but on the first time I always try the meatballs. It's like a test to see if the restaurant is good. I ordered a side of meatballs and a side of sausage (I hardly ever see sausage as a side and my mouth watered when I saw it). Both were excellent. The bread was good too (though I did have to ask for butter. I like it when they give you butter along with the oil or it's already on the table).\\n\\nThe chicken parm and angel hair was scrumptious. The portion was large. Along with the sides, it easily made 3 meals. My husband enjoyed his meal as well, but I don't remember what it was. I was too focused on my own. \\n\\nThe service was awesome. Our waitress was Natalia and she promptly took our drink and food order and checked on us many times. The food didn't take too long to come out and was hot when it did. The hostess walked around refilling waters. It was nice not to have to ask. Someone else, a manager maybe, stopped by the table twice to ask us if everything was okay. \\n\\nIt wasn't too loud and they had live music. The restaurant was clean.\\n\\nWe will definitely be going back...with our kids and without. Hopefully we'll get to meet the owners to tell them how much we enjoy their food.

It's dirty, unorganized, the employees are so rude, and my wrap was inedible. We were at the airport so we were already in a rush and didn't have much time to grab some food, this place had the shortest line so that was the deciding factor. We ordered a couple wraps and 2 black coffees. Each of the Half wraps were $10 each and I think the coffee was a few dollars for each which overall I thought was ridiculous but we didn't have time to be picky so I just rolled with it. When we asked for some cream and sugar the employee just pointed in the direction we were supposed to go.. no words, just a finger pointing in the  direction of the station that had all of that stuff and it was completely trashed, sugar and cream spilled all over the counter tops, trash can overflowing onto the counter and floor with people's trash. There were a couple dirty mixing sticks put into the container with the clean ones... anyways, moving on....My boyfriend said his wrap was alright but when I went to open the box for my wrap which was a half portion wrapped in plastic and put into a Togo box I saw that the wrap was soaked in liquid which I'm hoping and assuming came from the meat inside the wrap. It was drenched to the point that the whole tortilla was soggy and falling apart and the inside of the Togo box also had quite a bit of meat juice in it. I was already in the plane so I could go back and complain and I couldn't eat the wrap so I just went with out and spent the time cleaning all the juice from that disgusting wrap that generously poured all over the bottom of my purse as well.

I ordered the corned beef hash and when it arrived, I immediately knew something was wrong. I have ordered this dish at Babica Hen previously, but also at the other main brunch places in town (La Provence and Biscuits) and when it came, it was a bright orange color from swimming in sauce and was missing the corned beef and the bell peppers. It was essentially potatoes and onions, smothered in too much sauce, and covered in cheese. I alerted the waitress right away that my dish was wrong, and in a very polite voice, she continued to question me on how it was wrong and after my explaining it many times, \\"Too much sauce, no corned beef, no bell peppers,\\" she (politely) argued and corrected me, telling me that is how the dish was supposed to be, etc. She finally went to go check with a manager and then reported back that indeed, this is how the dish is supposed to be (corned beef without corned beef??). Eventually she remade it, but after acting like I was wrong for wanting anything different to be done with the dish (like including the actual ingredients listed on the menu). Eventually I asked to see the menu again to see if I was going crazy for thinking there were supposed to be bell peppers and corned beef in my corned beef hash. The whole experience was bizarre. She was polite, but kept insisting they had not done it wrong. When a customer has an issue like that, the ONLY acceptable response is, \\"Oh, I'm so sorry! We will get that fixed for you right away.\\" NOT a slew of questions trying to act like the dish was correct as is (when it is missing its headlining ingredient), or to straight up insist there were bell peppers in it when there were not, or to try and make me feel like a jerk for sending the food back when half of the ingredients are missing and it is clearly wrong. A step above that would be a visit from the manager after the meal was corrected to make sure everything was okay. A step even above that would be to comp the meal, which of course they didn't offer to do. There are other places for breakfast in town. I'll focus on those in the future."},{"name":"The Waterfront","address":"4201 S Orange Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"The waterfront is a top place to eat.

The braised cabbage was to die for. Of course, the sausages were terrific, like always. I topped the mashed potatoes with the stew juice and it was wonderful. Schmidt's is well worth the 2 hour drive! The only regret I have is NOT lining my pockets with baggies to sneak food home with me! Lol. I had to roll myself out the door, I was so pleasantly full.

An Italian restaurant, its cozy dining room is warm with dark red colors, and it has about seven to ten tables.  There is seating outside on their thin sidewalk, a couple metal bistro sets uncovered, a nicer environment then you'd imagine as the alley is sleepy and there are neighborhood trees that provides some shade. The former supermarker provides plenty of parking. \\n\\nNot a place to go on lunch break if you have only 30 minutes; even small dishes can take the lion share of your lunch time to make, leaving you to scarf down the meal in the remaining seconds you have left.  That's what happened to me with my Stromboli; they said it would take ten minutes but it took nearly twice that.  Not really a complaint, good food takes time especially fresh rolled Stroms, but for those that need to get in and get out take note.\\n\\nBuffalo Chicken was the filling I chose. Their medium size priced at $9 and change would be considered an individual large at other places.  It met my heavy appetite, but for lighter eaters a small will do.  Baked perfectly, I loved the crust.  Equally delicious was the chicken mixed with liquidated onions, and chesses.  Jalapenos gave each bite a hot kick which balanced the sweatness of the provalone and mozzarella.  The only dissapointment with the Stromboli was the hot sauce; I really didn't think it tasted, for lack of a better description, 'Buffalo' enough.  Still, it was a awesome meal. \\n\\nAnother good Stromboli I recommend is their Spinach Feta.  Their specialty pizzas are a must try for the enterprising foody or pizza pie adventurer. The menu pretty extensive for a small shop.\\n\\nA great Grandview area bistro that I recommend trying on lazy, chill-out days when you have time.

I'll save the best part of the review (the food) for last.\\nI like Bridges Caf√© and Catering's location - it is in close proximity to my work and it is in a small building on the corner and you can watch the city activity while you enjoy your meal. They also have a window counter which I imagine can be used to place quick orders or to-gos. I haven't used it so can't say for sure. There's a very Portland vibe to the barebones decor. There are photos and artwork of Portland's bridges, a signed photo of Jeff Bridges (nice touch! I love \\"The Dude\\"). They also play good music (Tom Petty and Cat Stevens are two of the artists I recall hearing...two of my favorites, in fact). \\nThe service is pretty on-point. I've only seen one server both times. She is quick and efficient. She seemed a little warmer to others than to me. Perhaps it's me (a tendency toward resting b***h face) so I won't take it personally. I just heard other people receiving a cheery, \\"You're welcome\\" in response to their \\"thank yous\\". I did not get a cheery \\"you're welcome\\". In fact, none at all. (shrug)\\nThe food, now having gone twice, makes me excited to try everything on their menu! The first time I had the reuben, sans sauerkraut because I am allergic to cabbage (I know, so sad, and a reuben without sauerkraut is sacrilege to many but I'd rather not have to go to hospital). That corned beef was the best I have ever had! It was juicy and flavorful and even looked pretty. The dressing was delicious and I imagine, on theme with the caf√©, that it was made in house and if I am correct then bravo to Bridges! The bread was delicious, a bit toasted. It was about $8-$10 for the sandwich but it was worth it. It was a good size and again, so delicious.\\nToday was my second visit. I had a Caesar salad which is $7 and added chicken for $3. Again, $10 for a salad is a little steep but it was very good.  The salad was brought out about 10 minutes after I ordered it which is great when you are on your lunch and let me know that they were making it fresh. The chicken was warm, tasty and juicy. I love warm chicken on cold salad much better than cold chicken on a cold salad. The croutons were of the focaccia type and buttery and delicious. The lettuce was of good quality with no wilted or slimy pieces. The dressing was the star. It definitely had a noticeable hint of fishiness, I imagine from the anchovies which are generally in Caesar dressing, but I liked it. But if you are someone who doesn't like fish or a hint of it in your dressing I wouldn't recommend ordering it. Next time I'll get the Caesar salad with smoked salmon. I intended on bringing half my salad back to my office but it was so tasty I just decided to finish it.\\nI look forward to another visit and definitely will try breakfast. Most other guests on both visits had breakfast dishes on their table.\\nI see other reviews in favor of the catering vs. the caf√©. I mean, the only negative thing I can say is I didn't feel super welcome. The server was efficient and bare-minimum courteous but not especially warm. Maybe if I become a regular that will change.

The sides didnt seem that impressive and were just sitting out there under a heating light.  Just scoop it yourself.  \\nYou then get to the meat cutting station. I ordered brisket and a pork rib.  Brisket seemed to be smoked normally, but the meat texture was kinda tough and not  tender. The brisket had a strong bark on it but it didnt have much pepper seasoning.  I was waiting for the overall food sensation of spices in this brisket but it never showed up.  It was cooked decently, with the proper smoke ring, but it just was not close to the great brisket you can find in this city.  The pork rib was smoked alright but it certainly wasnt meat that easily fell off the bone.  I thought the pork rib was actually quite bland from what I had.  I ordered the jalapeno cornbread which was nothing special.  Peach cobbler was actually a decent treat at the end.  \\nTerry Black's certainly was busy for a sunday night because plenty of people were walking into the store.

Now I haven't been here in the last year or so now and it looked like the restaurant had a renovation, as well as a new sign out front. It definitely looked more modern and sort of like pearl castle. There were four of us at 8:45 PM and we probably had to wait for about 5-10 minutes for a table. I ordered a passion fruit green tea (half sweet, less ice; $4.25), and the Traditional Taiwanese Three Sauce Chicken ($8.95), which I paid an extra $2.50 to make it a combo with two side dishes and a bowl of rice. \\n\\nEven though I ordered a half sweet for my passion fruit green tea, it was still a little too sweet for me. Other than that, it had a strong passion fruit flavour. I think the cups that they served the bubble tea in are slightly bigger than those at other bubble tea shops. I could be wrong though, but for $4.25 for a simple powder based passion fruit green tea was a little too pricey when the average price range for the drink is usually around $3.75. Maybe that is why I am trying to justify it by saying the cup is larger..I thought their food was cheaper than their drinks, as the food items were better in quality. \\n\\nI was always used to having my three cup chicken more pan-fried without any liquid. But the one at Bubble World had more sauce and not as crispy. Although it tasted good, the dish only had around 10 pieces of chicken. There were quite a few of tiny broken bones resulting from not cutting the pieces clean. The two side dishes I had were celery and wood-ear mushroom, and spicy (and saucy) cabbage and deep-fried tofu. I wasn't a fan of the latter one because the sauce tasted weird to me. However, I did like the celery and wood-ear mushrooms as it was light and refreshing. \\n\\nOverall, service could definitely be improved upon. The servers looked like they were mad at the whole world. But they did fill our water without having us hunt them down for it. They gave us the bill even though we weren't done with our drinks yet.

After all, when you are biting into fried chicken using hands and teeth you don't expect a fancy place, do you? I was also excited to see Cheerwine in the soda machine!\\n\\nDid you know you can get a decent sized family meal to go for about $40? It was a bucket of chicken, three large sides and cornbread. First the chicken- maybe it was that we had a 30 minute drive home but by the time we dug in the chicken was not as crunchy as I would have liked. We all agreed we liked the flavor. The sides were all pretty good- and I could not resist trying the cinnamon roll bread pudding. I thought Four Rivers Krispy Kreme bread pudding was good but this one may be better! You can never have enough icing, in my opinion, and they sure don't short you at Coop. The cornbread was a large disk in the shape of a hockey puck. It was a tad dry for my liking and wasn't as sweet as I prefer. But, to each his own on things like cornbread and fried chicken. \\n\\nService was quick and friendly.

Totally not the same thing!!  If you don't have green tomatoes, then you tell the customer that when they order it, or say \\"the tomatoes are just red tomatoes man, no green ones in house, sorry\\". Shame on me for thinking I could get them in March.  Well played Whiskey kitchen, well played.\\n\\nThe atmosphere at this place is nice.  It looks cool and you feel cool sitting there.

But if you have any love for your taste buds at all..... spare them and don't eat here.\\n\\n(they get 2 stars instead of 1 due to the fact that they remade my drink for free after I asked if there was any whiskey in it at all.  Silly me for thinking that if I order my drink in a larger glass they will take into consideration the whiskey to lemonade ratio.  They did not.  And she explained \\"that's why I asked what size glass you want.  We do a pour count here\\".  Whatever.... I got a new drink so I shouldn't complain TOO much about it.

This place was packed on a Monday night at 6:30. I started standing in line outside at 6:43 and didn't get in until 7:20. My expectations of not a long line was a bit naive, but you never know right? Because I sure didn't. By the time I got the door the line started wrapping around the parking lot. I guess I was relatively lucky to get here in time. \\n\\nHere are the details you got to know, because they pretty much got you waiting outside anyways and you'll probably be thinking what the etiquette is. Basically, if you're thirsty...go get a beer. They have a window outside where you can get a drink and people in line don't mind you getting a drink while waiting. Once you get in, they sell merch. If you're into it and want a souvenir, then you can get that as well. There's no line for that as well, so peruse at your own time.\\n\\nFinally, when you get towards the end of the line, you hit the sides stand. Just order what you want as far as sides. They have greens/mac n cheese, the usual. I got mac n cheese and that's it. I wanted to get banana pudding, but sadly my wife wasn't with me to finish so I laid off the sweets.\\n\\nThen when you get to the cash register, that's where they ask what type of meats you want. I ordered a half pound of fatty brisket, a link of the jalape√±o cheddar sausage (they sell by links), and a beef rib. Remember, beef rib is only sold by the bone... The beef rib a good amount of meat, but the bone itself is pretty heavy...so it makes sense. They sell other meats by 1/3, 1/2, 1 pound.\\n\\nI thought the brisket was great, but I wasn't so hot on why it was so salty. It wasn't bad by all, but that turned it off for me. I think that it needs sauce to coexist with the saltiness of the brisket. Beef rib was something I loved because it was just something that is known in Texas and that was what made it for me. If you get anything, this is what you need to get.\\n\\nTerry Black's was everything that I looked for in BBQ in Texas, especially that massive ass beef rib that they're only known for. This spot set the bar for me for BBQ in Texas, and I will be looking for places that top it. \\n\\nIf you're looking for a place to eat, and don't want to wait at 7:00 AM for bbq at Franklin's, this is the place you need to go to. You might have to wait, but it's not going to be 5 hours with the possibility of you not getting anything.

I normally go through their drive thru and if I order more than a cup of coffee, I expect to get disappointed. They always forget or give the wrong condiments or give me a wrong order.  So I just try to avoid  this location. So a few weeks ago, I went through their drive thru again, when I got home I found out I got the wrong sandwich, so I phoned them to let them know. The manager I talked to told me I can come back to get a new one but I didn't come back until today. So I went inside the store, I lined up, told the service crew about my replacement burger and she has to ask her manager. So the manager on duty needed to verify the story and check her book. Because there were people on the line I have to go on the side. When the manager came out, she asked me to line again so she can enter burger on the till, there were 9 people on the line. It's very frustrating because I lined up the first time already. Their customer service is so bad. Obviously even if customers are disappointed they still come here for whatever reason but I have to say this is the worst McDonalds.

The venue is designed like many pubs: large bar, heavy wooden tables, in a large open space. Sound carried from booth to standalone tables, but conversations weren't disrupted.  As a last-minute dine before heading to the airport for my return to Los Angeles, there was still ample seating and it was still happy hour. Clearly, my friends and I were going to go big, for the last meal of the city.\\n\\nFried Green Tomatoes - tomatoes were crusted with cornmeal for a gritty crunch and flash-fried, holding the heat like a batch of fresh onion rings. Careful on the tongue, the neatly packaged tomatoes popped with juice when bitten.\\n\\nFour Cheese Macaroni and Cheese - Well-done, though I wished I could've discerned the individual cheeses. I used the steaming concoction as a \\"palate cleanser\\" between the heavier dishes. That's how it works right? Well, maybe it was just another excuse to eat even more, and with no gravy to dip, I had few alternatives.\\n\\nSmoked Cheddar + Tasso Grit Sticks - the cheese grits were fried to a flawless crunch, but where does the Tasso play in? Were they fried in Tasso? I couldn't answer that question either, but as the server expressed when I ordered it \\"Trust me, you'll like them.\\" The dish was paired with a slightly spiced, creamy onion dip. Call me simple: ketchup worked just fine. \\n\\nButtermilk Biscuit w/Pulled Pork - the shredded pork was tossed in a smoky barbecue sauce, topped with a horseradish slaw and sandwiched between two warm halves of a buttermilk biscuit. The combination suited the flavors and the soft and flaky, biscuit that I ordered. I also put in for a batch of Collard Greens, softened and seasoned - nothing of note here.\\n\\nFried Chicken - If I could have an expression with amorous eyes, that would most closely equate to my satisfaction with this version of one of my favorites. A lightly peppered breading encased each wing to that much sought-after gold. The meat fell off the bone with each bite. Ah, yes, good fried chicken is known to do that.

Fast forward to hours later, the feeling kept getting more intense. I drove myself to the ER, and the doctor removed a sharp object from the back of my throat. See attached picture. It was a super scary experience and my ended up being more than a small ER bill because the doctors were afraid it had perforated my esophagus. The doctors were unable to discern if it was the sharp end of the toothpick or a sharp fish bone that was within the sandwich.

I read one of the reviews on Suya and the reviewer stated that the waitress had added a 20% tip to her check.

On the other hand, a lot of the problems I've had speak to the way the restaurant is run, and not anything innately wrong with the way the food tastes. It tastes fine.\\n\\nOK, so I've ordered this Cobb Salad perhaps four times. The first time, they didn't put avocado in it. I called them up afterwards and to their (and later my) credit, they credited me with a free salad on my next visit, which was proper and nice.\\n\\nThe second time, they put in avocado that was hard as a rock. And the most recent time, the one that prompted this review, the salad was missing the hard-boiled egg, and the cheese.\\n\\nWhen I challenged them on the lack of the egg, they said, \\"Oh yeah, we ran out of hard-boiled eggs.\\" No offer for a substitution, or any compensation. \\n\\nYou should be made aware of any missing ingredients when you place an order, and failing that (i.e., if the order-taker is unaware of it), the staff who prepare the food should track you down and point out the deficiency. It's not as if it would have been hard to track us down - we were only one of two patron groups at the time.\\n\\nFinally, from our seat, we could hear the staff who were preparing the food grumbling to themselves. For instance, one of them was overheard saying, \\"only an hour and a half left!\\" ... I assume referring to the time until their shift ended.\\n\\nThe food at this restaurant is fine if they have the ingredients, but their staff attitude and professionalism leave something to be desired."},{"name":"Andiamo Ristorante","address":"2521 Rutland Dr, Ste 325","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"My wife and I recently relocated to Austin and were trying to find a truly authentic Italian restaurant. After reading the reviews we gave Andiamo a try and unfortunately, even though Daniela was incredibly kind and personable, this place was far from authentic Italian. We were told the pasta was homemade but after ordering two pasta dishes this is hard to believe.\\n\\nMy wife ordered the lobster ravioli which was four pieces with no flavor, and from her description was like eating a frozen dinner entree. No flavor, almost a crab salad like texture inside and dry as a bone. ($23.50 for this one)\\n\\nI ordered the Gnocchi with the walnut mascarpone cream sauce. The Gnocchi was way overcooked and I'm not kidding when I say this had no flavor either. I even gave my wife a bite because I thought my taste buds were fooling me. She agreed. ($18.50 for this one).\\n\\nOn a good note the bread was fantastic, but they don't serve fresh grated parmesan cheese with the olive oil. Instead it's scooped out of a dish like something Kraft makes. No fresh grated cheese was offered with our entrees either.\\n\\nWe also ordered two appetizers, the polenta and the calamari. The polenta was fantastic. Everything was cooked perfectly and the flavor was really good. The calamari was overcooked, heavily breaded (way too much), and was very rubbery. Both my wife and I enjoy anchovies and neither of us took another bite of the fried anchovies they included with the calamari.\\n\\nThis less than mediocre dinner cost $87 in total, and no, we didn't order any wine. This is just for the food I mentioned. I gave it 2 stars because the people were very kind and the server was attentive, almost to a fault. Based on the food alone I would have given it 1 star.

I only ordered one item so, I really can't give lower than 3 stars. I  visited 3 trailers today in my first time at the Hitch: a Mobile food Eatery Park. At one trailer, I ordered 4 spring rolls and got my order in 4 minutes, the next trailer, I ordered BBQ chicken and got my order in 4 minutes. At the Big Kahuna, I only ordered fried green beans and it took 15 minutes, and there were only a few people around waiting for orders.\\n\\nI also found that trailer not too inviting because of the ordering window. It is dark and screened. All the other trailers are open with friendly personnel. This isn't just me, as I heard three different people say, \\" is this place open\\"?  When a customer arrives at the window to order, it's dark inside, they peer in; then, a window just opens up (not the screen too, just the outer window). Now, I know the reasoning is because of the bugs, or maybe it is the proper requirement from the sanitary police, but jeez, it just ain't personal.\\n\\nFor my one little side order, I ordered the tempura-fried, spicy green beans, which came with a sweet-chile pineapple dipping sauce. The batter was light, but barely left on the beans. The whole thing was greasy--maybe, because there was a lack of tempura on it, and what was on it just soaked up grease (and old grease to boot). I did find the actual tempura batter extraordinary, but the grease took away any feelings of envy from my lips.  Wish list: I wanna try the poke and Kahuna burger next.

Nobody in India makes this spicy for the gravy that you can't taste the actual flavor of other spices.

The brunch is amazing - the french toast is an amazing dish. However, the owners seem to have gone from unaccommodating to people with children to almost aggressive. The staff is as helpful as they can be, but the management has clearly created a culture in which they feel conflicted. There are now hours in which children are not allowed (fine) and incredibly loud music even at brunch (really annoying). There are several huge booths (great for families!) with tiny, tiny tables in the middle (oops - not so much, just enough room for drinks and maybe a small plate or two).\\n\\nHere's a bulletin for you, owners of Gourdoughs; This is Austin--Hipsters who drink either have kids, or most likely will have kids at some point. Alienating your patrons with kids (you're a doughnut restaurant for heaven's sake!) seems more likely to negatively impact your bottom line than help it. \\n\\nAdding a modest kid's menu and having your early hours be more family friendly will keep you from pissing off the large numbers of Austinites who have kids, while still keeping your place hip and cool for the the people who come in after 8 pm. \\n\\nSeriously."},{"name":"Hopdoddy Burger Bar","address":"1400 S Congress Ave, Ste A190","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I've eaten here several times, I'm a huge fan of a good burger!

I had the Prime Time on my first visit, served rare, they didn't screw around about serving it rare and it was a serious meal very delicious. For my second visit I wanted something different and had the Ahi Tuna Burger, which was mind blowingly amazing! I would totally have paid more than I did for either burger so the price point is good. \\n\\nThe reason I'm giving them three stars is the insane ordering process, I assume what they are doing is trying to create a fake line. I know I have never gone by here without seeing a long huge line of people. The main reason this line exists is because of the ordering system at the restaurant. When you first go on your in line and funneled by a bar at which point you can order a drink and your card is charged. Then you move to the food order station holding your drink at which point you order food and your card is charged. Then you can sit down, now if you want another drink you have to order it and at the end of the meal be charged again. That's three separate charges for one meal. It just seems they could let you come in have a seat and serve you all traditionally. The quality of food here is good enough they may still have a line doing so. \\n\\nI will encourage anyone who mentions Hopdoddy to eat here, if you like burgers at all this a great place!

At Animal Kingdom with a few friends for the evening, we were getting a bit hungry and decided to get some food at a table service so we could relax and talk. Back and forth between Tiffin's and Yak & Yeti, we ultimately decided on the later due to its proximity to where we wanted to be in the park, and it's more affordable menu options. While I've been to the Yak & Yeti several times before, it has been over a year since I last visited. \\n\\nAlthough the restaurant was not very crowded when we entered, there were still a few parties waiting to be seated ahead of us. As a Landry's Select member, I showed the hostess my card, and within a few minutes our name was called, and we were escorted to our table. Shortly after being seated, we were greeted by our server, who took the time to introduce the restaurant concept to those in the party that had never been to Yak & Yeti before, as well as suggest some of their current specials and more popular dishes. He then took our drink orders, with two of us ordering ice water, and the other two getting the Kiwi Kimono cocktail the server suggested to us.\\n\\nThe drinks brought out about 5 minutes later, and at this time, the server took our food orders. I split an order of the Ahi Tuna Nachos from their sharable menu with a friend, as when I ordered them before, I couldn't even finish more than half due to their immense size. The other two in the party ordered a 44 Farms Burger, which came with a side of Fries, and the Mini Corn Dogs from the kids menu, which were served with your choice of two sides. In addition, we placed an order for Pork Potstickers as a starter to split amongst the table.\\n\\nThe Kiwi Kimono was made with coconut rum, vodka, midori melon, Kiwi juice, and sour mix. The drink was okay, but could have been a bit stronger as all I could really taste was the Kiwi juice with a hint of the sour mix.\\n\\nThe potstickers were your standard potstickers, pan fried with a crispy top and bottom, but soft \\nedges and inside. The filling was pretty good, with plenty of pork inside. \\n\\nThe Ahi Tuna Nachos were so delicious. Thick cut cubes of Ahi served on crispy wonton chips, and topped with slaw and a spicy dressing. The dish is definitely one of if not my absolute favorite here, and I will absolutely get it again in the future.\\n\\nThe rest of the party enjoyed their meals, and said the burger was juicy and very flavorful, and the corndogs were some of the better she has had.\\n\\nService was okay, nothing exceptional, and there were a few times where the waiter made it seem like we were hassling him, or inconveniencing him when we asked for our annual pass discount at the end of our meal.\\n\\nI will definitely return to Yak & Yeti again in the future if I'm looking for a nice sit down meal when I want to take the park slowly."},{"name":"Terry Black's Barbecue","address":"1003 Barton Springs Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"This is one of my favorite places in Austin!!\\nThis place is so good.
