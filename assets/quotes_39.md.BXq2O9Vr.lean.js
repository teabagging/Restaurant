I also got the cheese breadsticks, Greek salad (minus the olives) and the salted caramel brownie. I haven't started on the brownie (saving it for later) and again DELICIOUS!!! I was expecting small portions but there is more than enough food for small order. Actually two people can eat off of a small order. I will just have to save the rest for later as I'm already full. Delivery was quoted at approximately 50 minutes but they were here within 15-20 minutes of my online order.

When we stepped inside the first thing I noticed was how packed it was, but it has a lively atmosphere. The front has a counter with a selection of merchandise like apparel and growlers. The building is pretty large and open and they have some interesting woodworking details that fits with the whole Pacific Northwest theme. \\n\\nMy friend and I snagged two seats at the bar and both decided to get their sample tray of beer ($12) in which you have three options: 1) classic six beers, 2) brewer's choice or 3) choose your own. I decided to choose my own since I like pale/amber the best. I'm not a huge fan of IPAs or porters but I did decide to try their Black Butte Porter as one of mine, which was actually delicious. My favorite was the Swivelhead Red but I also did enjoy the Mirror Pond Pale Ale.

They had a specials menu and their regular menu.  The regular menu contained the kind of stuff you'd find in most Japanese restaurants except that the prices were rather high.  This restaurant is small, clean, and tidy; it is not a fancy restaurant.  So I assumed the prices were high due to portion sizes or incredible food quality.  But I was wrong.  Portions were average or a bit smaller than average.  Food quality was about average.  So I'm not sure why they get so many good reviews here on Yelp since they seem to be unjustifiably expensive.  Oh, it also took quite a while for our food to arrive.  \\n\\nHaving said that, it's possible that the sushi items on their special menu are particularly good or hard-to-find and that's why they were doing such good business when we were there?  So that's why I gave them 3 stars...it's because we might not have ordered the stuff that they're particularly good at.\\n\\nBTW I'll also point out that this place seems to be focused on sushi.

The salmon has always been cooked how I like it and flavorful and crispy.  But I get that meal because of the crab salad because the flavor is made just right with real crab meat, it's subtle but enough to make you miss it and linger, the tomato wedges are so juicy, sweet and so fresh along with the arugula.  It's not served by itself and I like salmon anyway so it's worth it.  I rarely drink so I asked the waiter for recommendation for something sweet and I had prickly pear mojito, that was delicious!!!  I couldn't taste the alcohol much so perfect for me.  My husband has had their chicken fried beef rib and he loves it.  Meat falls right off the bone, juicy and the mashed potatoes are yum!  Their pork belly sliders are pretty damn good too!  Good enough for a meal not just appetizers.\\n\\nWait staff has always been friendly.  The ambience is nice when not busy but gets pretty loud when packed, which is all the time.  Outside seating is relaxing both during cold and warm weather.  \\n\\nOnly reason they are getting 1 star away from 5 is because their brunch buffet on Sundays is mediocre and not worth the expensive price you have to pay per person."},{"name":"The Hawthorne","address":"500A Commonwealth Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"I have been in and out of the Hawthorne twice now without ever having received one drink.  Let me explain:  several weeks ago, my roommate and I decided to see what this place was all about.  We love Eastern Standard, and figured we'd get a drink or two at the Hawthorne before heading over to ES.  We walked in and tried getting a drink at the bar, but to no avail.  I stood there trying to get the bartender's attention, but he wouldn't even look at me.  I realize this is the \\"trendy new place\\" and they are busy, but the joint was definitely NOT packed.  We waited for about 15 minutes, were not helped, and left.\\n\\nThis past Saturday night, we thought we'd try again.  When we walked in, the hostess told us there were no seats at the bar or anywhere else, but said we could get \\"railing service.\\"  Oooook.  We were led like horsies over to \\"the railing\\" and were told that a waiter would be by soon to take our drink order.  We saw him waiting on some sort of (birthday?) party in another section.  In the meantime, a few more people were led over to the railing with us, and they were told the same thing.  A water boy also came by, maybe 10 minutes later, and we asked if we could place an order.  He said our waiter would be coming by for that.  Well, he never came by.  We were probably there about 20 minutes, and got no attention, except from the water boy.  Maybe our waiter was caught up with the larger party, but he was constantly going back and forth from his station to their section, tending to their needs.  We denizens of \\"the railing\\" were definitely put on the back burner.  \\n\\nWe had enough of waiting 20 minutes just to place a drink order, and figured they would not be worth the $ anyway, so we left the railing.  As we walked by the hostesses (there were 2 or 3 of them, which I don't really understand), they implored us to stay and said \\"We have a table opening up!\\"  Sorry gals, I'm out of patience.  We hightailed it over to ES, and got great service there, as always. (Of course, ES is like 4 times the size, and was 4 times as busy, but still able to accomodate two girls that want drinks).  Maybe the Hawthorne is where all \\"the cool kids\\" go, but I don't plan on going back.  It really doesn't seem like the type of place to meet people, and the atmosphere was somewhat dull and smug.  If you're looking for a place with overpriced cocktails where it takes an Act of Congress to get a drink, the Hawthorne is your place!"},{"name":"Fresa's - South 1st","address":"1703 S 1st St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"These people just do not know what they're doing. \\n\\n1) Our waiter rolled his eyes when we asked to move tables due to two more people coming.  Nothing had been ordered and there were maybe two other tables filled in the restaurant.  He was very inattentive and we had to ask for basic things like plates and silverware.  All of the staff I encountered seemed absolutely miserable.\\n\\n2). Margaritas are expensive, tiny and unremarkable.\\n\\n3).   They got rid of the playground.  Everyone coming in had disappointed kids, and probably won't be back.  You guys really screwed yourself.  When you sell mediocre, expensive four and drinks, and somehow you're still busy, it might just be the playground.\\n\\n4). The hostess (Saturday, September 2nd at 4 pm) was sooo rude.  It was not busy at all, and she acted so annoyed when I walked up and asked for a table.  Then, when I asked for chalk for the giant chalkboard they have (because I need something to entertain my kids since there's no playground) she said no, you have to bring it from home.  Really?!!!?  Are you serious?!??!?  Because I regularly keep a pack of chalk in my purse.  Like everyone else.  So unbelievably ridiculous.\\n\\n5).  The kitchen would not give a sample of an ice cream flavor, nor would they split in order with two flavors, because \\"it would cause too much confusion.\\"  Again,  the place was dead.  \\n\\nAnyways Fresa's, good luck with all that.

It's a divey, quirky little place that attracts a lot of nearby government employees. It's a nice place to grab a beer, burger and to just chill. I did order the chili burger once. It's like a mountain of chili on the burger with the buns attempting to keep it all in and failing miserably. The only reason I had trouble eating that burger was because the burger bun was not toasted so it quickly became soggy. I ended up using utensils to eat the burger. It was good.\\n\\nIf anything I really really like the potato salad here. They use what look like new potatoes in their mixture. It's more potato than mustardy blend like you see with a lot of other places. Big big fan of the potato salad.

They bring fresh skinny breadsticks and butter, which is sort of an awkward combination to eat, but delicious.  After sitting next to the candle for a few minutes, the butter was soft enough for me kind of dip the breadsticks into it.  Started with the \\"toast pocket stuff with caramelized onions and cheese,\\" which was essentially the most delicious half a grilled cheese sandwich you could hope to buy for $4.  Then the arancini, which were to die for -- crispy, cheesy, and with a lovely citrus-y flavor.  I had the gnocchi with Italian sausage -- little fluffly clouds of carb-y goodness covered with lots of parmesan cheese.  Very tasty.  My friend had the duck, which turned out to be ground duck formed into patties over wheatberries, spinach, and other interesting tidbits, including grapes.  She enjoyed the duck; I did not.  However, the stuff it was sitting on was delicious.  We finished with the phatty cakes -- tasted just like my grandmother's ginger and molasses cookies, with a mascarpone cheese filling.  HIGHLY recommended if you like those flavors.  Dunked into coffee from a French press... heavenly!  I'd highly recommend C&A based on this experience... not cheap (we spent about $50 each), but a party in your mouth with every bite.

Then I had the Field Greens Salad ($4.95), followed by the Fresh Vegetable Grille kabobs. The kabobs were $13.50 without a protein option, but you can add chicken or shrimp for $4-$5 if that floats your boat.  The kabobs are served on top of a vegan lentil bean salad. The kabobs and the lentil bean salad were both to die for!  Veggies were perfectly cooked and had a cilantro based pesto sauce on it but it wasn't overly smothered with it.

He was both enthusiastic and incredibly knowledgeable about the menu...to a level that I don't usually find. He left us the menus and after learning that we had never been there before, told us that he would be back to describe the specials after we perused the regular menu - a great idea as I tend to forget the specials if I am having to learn a new menu. My son ordered the special cheese board as an appetizer. It consisted of 8 small cheese portions which the waiter described with amazing detail and enthusiasm. My son said it was excellent. I had the local tomatoes, beefy slices of tomato with some oil and spices, very good on a warm summer evening. \\n\\nThe wine list had a great range of selections but I wanted something different so our waiter offered the services of the Canoe sommelier. He explained that Canoe had two sommeliers which were in the process of obtaining their masters level designation from the Guild of Sommeliers, a very big deal in the wine world (around 200 such designees in the US). Alicia  listened to our preferences and price range, asked a few questions and suggested she bring out something that she thought we would like. She brought out the 2009  Andre Perren Saint Joseph which was excellent with lots of pepper and well within the price range. I was impressed!\\n\\nThe pecan crusted grouper was excellent and my son's new york strip was equally as savory. \\n\\nThe only slip up we had was when my son asked to see the cigar list so he could order one and we would sit outside on the porch. Unfortunately, they didn't have a list readily available in the dining room (probably not a surprise) but we decided to pass up the chance to enjoy the rest of the evening outside.\\n\\nI expect that it would have been even better if we had sat outside...6 stars?"},{"name":"Mango II Thai Cuisine","address":"2171 Main St","city":"Tewksbury","stars":"4","text":"My husband and I went here with a friend who had been highly recommending it to us.

It was good. Since then I've gone back many times and being a creature of habit have had the house fried rice just about every time, except I like to request it with duck. Try it; it's delicious.

I also asked for extra extra hot sauce on each (I hate dry burritos and love spicy ones!) This place isn't your typical burrito joint where they make it while you watch, we sat down and waited 20 minutes before they were done. Needless to say I was hungry and anxious to try it. Sadly the burritos were gross! Not spicy at all, very dry, and overall had a weird taste (& aftertaste.) It was also annoying that they were underfilled and with each bite I was eating rolled up tortilla. I started eating in the car but had to take it home and drench it in Frank's Red Hot to make it edible. Waste of $20. Burritos came with chips and a very small portion of salsa. Chips could use salt but salsa was good. I don't know what \\"authentic Mexican\\" is but this place was bad.

Didn't have time to actually come chill at the bar, so I figured I'd just grab a few foods for take-out and have lunch/dinner covered for the day. \\n\\nUnfortunately, they were re-doing their menu when I stopped in, so they had pretty limited options. I ordered a few veggie plates since none of the other (very few) food options were very appealing to me. The plate itself is a decent size for $5, and I don't really have any complaints with that (veggies themselves were average and typical quality for bar food), but I'm incredibly dissatisfied with their service. \\n\\nOkay, I came in on a Saturday afternoon. The venue was pretty empty. They had some people working in the kitchen, along with someone at the cash register. I ordered freakin' raw vegetables, which at most take 2-3 minutes to slice! I don't know why it took them over 20 minutes to make 3 freakin' veggie plates. Okay, actually, I do. First off, they couldn't find their usual dressing for the plate, and decided to spend 10 minutes looking for their dressing rather than asking if I was okay with a different one (or none at all). Then, after finally notifying me of that problem, they *still* wouldn't give me my order. Why? Oh right, because they couldn't find the lids for the containers they use to hold their dressing. Once again, rather than letting me know, they spent another 10 minutes unsuccessfully looking for them. You know, because it's really that hard to make sure you have everything you need at the beginning. I ended up leaving with no dressing anyway.

Well worth it.\\n\\nFirst of all, it is the friendliest place with Wayne's big smile right out front. Great way to start out. I needed some guidance since I have never been to Texas ...really. But I like the idea of buying by the pound instead of some arbitrary size offerings. \\n\\nSo, like I had heard, the BBQ beef brisket was terrific. I have never had Texas style BBQ before as I am a Carolina style pulled pork fan. I don't like KC style at all so I have stuck with my tradition. But this is a new option, tender, flavorful, moist, and I added a touch of sauce. We also got the baby back ribs, different from any I have had or made myself. Very different rub flavoring than the brisket, a little more peppery, really no need for sauce at all on these. \\n\\nAs for the sides, not quite even across the board. The beans were great, spicy with a tomato base and cilantro, one of my favorite herbs. They certainly fit the description of slow cooked BBQ beans, but not sure they were baked, since there was no evidence of crustiness, like Boston style baked. I don't care if they are or are not baked, they were a perfect side and I just wondered for accuracy of name. The mac and cheese was quite good, a nice mild creamy balance to the other items. The cabbage in the cole slaw was cut very coarse, some pieces just a little bulky on the fork. I liked the flavor a lot and it was nicely marinated and with my favorite cilantro mixed in. The dinner roll which I used for making a brisket sandwich was very under-baked, heavy and gummy in the lower half and totally white on the bottom. I am not sure if it was a timing issue or if the baking is not quite adjusted for the altitude but though it was nice yeasty white bread dough, I could not eat the  bottom section. The unsweetened ice tea was fresh and a good strength. \\n\\nWhat I want next time- the brisket  meat served on a baked potato. It was featured on their FB page and looked and sounded terrific, but it is not a daily option. Apparently it was served for a couple of weeks as a trial and they are now out of potatoes. Hopefully, they will bring it back on a predictable basis. Since sides rotate as well as some meat specials, I advise calling ahead so you can plan and not be disappointed and undecided when you get there, which would slow down the line.

Royal China scores high marks on all fronts, but might almost be too authentic for many westernized palates. \\n\\nFood: Royal China specializes in authentic Cantonese cuisine, which is likely the reason why more people don't rave about this place, including myself. Most Americanized Chinese restaurants serve Mandarin, Hunan, and Szechuan cuisines, which tend to be riddled with heavy sauces. True to Cantonese form, Royal China also serves dim sum on a daily basis, complete with an ample supply of roaming steam carts. During my recent lunchtime visit, our party of eight  shared approximately ten different dishes, all of which were fresh and well-prepared. Unfortunately, our attempts to satisfy all members of the large group limited the number of dishes with my preferred food options, which led to an overall average experience. \\n\\nService: The staff were quick and eager to please, but unable to communicate. If it hadn't been for my Cantonese-speaking coworker, I'm not sure if I would have been able to order without just pointing to the menu items. Said coworker was also incredibly efficient at fending off the dim sum carts, which repeatedly attempted to sell us on various items despite the fact that we had ordered off the standard lunch menu. \\n\\nAtmosphere: Although this place is among the swankier Chinese restaurants that I've visited in Atlanta, the overall vibe is still quite casual. The walls are lined with red fabric and the dining room is filled with a series of large round family style tables. The clientele was a mixture of western and eastern diners during my visit, but predominately comprised of the latter. \\n\\nCost: Reasonably priced. All lunch specials, which include soup, are $5.95. Dinner entrees range in price between $10 and $20. Dim sum is generally $3-$5 per item. All major credit cards are accepted and payment is remitted at the counter on the way out. \\n\\nOther: Lunch is served daily from 11AM to 3PM, while dinner is served 11AM-10:30PM, Monday-Friday, and 10AM-10:30PM, Saturday-Sunday. Dim sum is available 11AM-3PM, Monday-Friday, and 10AM-3PM, Saturday-Sunday.

I work at Mikey's LNS and our paper plates are bigger than the \\"platter\\" plate, half of whcih was sauce served in. wait for it... wonton soup style spoons. It was a good appetizer for one person but it was insulting to see that for two. I get the atmosphere, drinks, etc, it's all fancy. It's not fancy enough to justify that bullshit. Also whats up with the wait staff? We must've had 3 \\"waiters\\" despite not asking for much (we saw 1 girl who took our order, 1 guy who checked up and took my drink order / our food order and later the host (or I assume he's the host since he hangs out near the front) brought our food out which was when we knew we were being bullshitted for value).

We went to a new bar in town, one of the very few from what understand. I was fairly pleasantly surprised upon first arriving. They have about a dozen parking spaces in the lot, and somebody to open the door for you- how fancy! \\n\\nIn the center of the space was houses a decent size bar, with seating all around it and a variety of things on TV above. \\n\\nThey had committed more space to sit-down-dining than I would have expected, but this seems to be a town ordinance... Seems like there are alot of \\"blue laws\\" surrounding opening and maintaining a bar in Reading. \\n\\nIt was set up as much like you'd see your generic East Coast Chinese restaurant and from talking to the friends I came with- all of them grew up in this town, it was a Chinese restaurant not too long ago. \\n\\nWe sat down at the bar and finally got enough seats for the four of us. I was happy to see that they had both Magners and Guinnes on tap! This is unusual for a lot of places that are not run by the Briar Group in Boston, I ordered a black velvet, the boys each ordered a Guinness and my friend Maura ordered a Magners. \\n\\nThe waitress was fairly attentive, and then disappeared and we are taken on by another waiter/bartender for the rest of the night. My friends ordered a mac & cheese plate with fries. My boyfriend and I ordered something called \\"angry shrimp\\". Their food came out fairly quickly, the fries were pretty good but it's hard to screw those up. The mac & cheese, however, was I think some of the most pathetic I've ever had at a bar. It was really very sloppy/soupy and didn't have a lot of flavor. We waited about an extra 15-20 min. to get our shrimp appetizer the bartender walked by he noted that it wasn't there didn't apologize and didn't give any reason as to it's tardiness. When it finally did come it was very small- 5 jumbo shrimp, and enough sweet chilli sauce for 10 such plates of shrimp. This is not to say it didn't taste good- we definitely made out better than our companions for flavor, it just took an epically long time and was pricey. \\n\\nWe stayed for one more beer and then called it a night.

Sweetwater hosts a full Bar and many beers on tap. \\n\\nI sat down with the Chef Aaron Parson on the patio to talk. He spoke about the menu and all the new items he is working on. Parson's is extremely passionate about food and it was clear in speaking with him his intentions of continuing to elevate the food and experience patrons have at Sweetwater cafe. The menu is full of signature sandwiches (including a amazing Cuban sandwich), multiple entrees including a vegetarian option, plus several appetizers - and so much more.\\n\\nI had a heaping portion of the Lobster Chowder ($6) and oh my god was it good. It was over flowing with gigantic chucks of tender lobster !  I also tried the Lobster roll special which comes with a side of mac and cheese. It was definitely a cut above any lobster roll I have ever had. Its all starts with a soft warm roll then filled to the brim with creamy lobster then cover with melted cheese - it was love at first bite. The mac and Cheese which in my opinion could be served as a dish on its own - so creamy and bursting flavor which it enhanced by the bits of bacon mixed in - can't go wrong when bacon is involved. The Lobster roll and mac and cheese side are $15.00 a steal !\\n\\nPlus Sweetwater serves $1 oysters - all the time. That's right this isn't a special - it's all the time. \\n\\nGo for the food, drinks or fun pub atmosphere or Sunday brunch on the patio - you won't be disappointed.

But, when we got to the restaurant, their dinner menu looked oddly like their lunch menu and all of the good items were gone.  (We discovered later is WAS their lunch menu!)  Most of us ordered the duck because everything else sounded ho-hum.  Our waitress informed us they only had one duck breast left (at 7pm???).\\n\\nThe food arrives... The appetizers were small and low-grade.  The main dishes were laughably SMALL.  I finished mine in three bites and thought \\"Did I just pay $20 for THAT???\\"  What a joke.  The desserts were also small and run of the mill.  Nothing special and definitely NOT worth $38 for the DOV menu!!  The \\"AAA Steak Salad\\" is nothing but cheap flank steak with some soggy lettuce on the side.  The \\"duck breast\\" is more like a 1/4 of a duck breast.  The \\"vegetable curry soup\\" tasted like canned vegetable soup with some curry powder added to it.  \\n\\nThis was one of the WORST restaurant experiences we have ever had, and after seeing other reviews, it appears we're not alone.  Sadly, we were still very hungry when we left and had to grab a quick bite at a late-night pub.\\n\\nDear Cassis:  WTF? The goal of Dine Out Vancouver is to showcase your best dishes so that customers will want to come back.  It's NOT intended as a way for you to cheat them out of their hard earned money by serving the skimpiest mediocre dishes you can think of.  You don't deserve to charge $38 for that slop.  You don't even deserve to charge $28.  I wouldn't even pay $15 for such rubbish.  Using DOV to clear your inventory of unpopular dishes is just WRONG!\\n\\nYelp readers:  BEWARE!

I had the pork chop and it was cooked to perfection. It was extremely juicy and tender to cut and bite into as well. Furthermore, my wife and kids enjoyed their meal as well and we do plan to go back one day. My only concern is with the cleanliness of the restaurant. We sat in a booth with our back to the bar area and we notice that the area where the bottles of wine were extremely dusty and even the bottles that were on display seem like they never have been moved and whomever cleaned in that area never move the bottles to clean under and over them. They were only dusted and cleaned around the area where they stand. And I can only imagine that the wine bottles that are on display behind us were just as dusty. I can believe that it is a lot of work to keep that area clean, but every restaurant should take the time to clean with perfection if their food is going to taste perfect. Fine dining can only be fine when everything is done with perfection and that starts with the cleanliness of the restaurant. In addition, all of that dust can be harmful to anyone with any type of breathing or allergy conditions. So I recommend that this restaurant would take the time to properly clean their restaurant from top to bottom before I rate them to be an excellent restaurant. Nonetheless, they are on their way they just need to do a better job of some detail cleaning throughout the restaurant then when that is done when I go back I will upgrade the rating."},{"name":"Max & Erma's","address":"7480 Sawmill Rd","city":"Dublin","stars":"2.5","text":"If you go here do yourself a favor and order what they do best - burgers!

I have never been to a worse restaurant in my life.\\n\\nIt was Friday afternoon, we had a reservation for 10 and I was the first person there.  They have the ridiculous policy of not seating until the entire party is present, I said that it made more sense to sit and drink and wait, than stand and loiter and wait. The nasty little girl seated us begrudgingly with six after as we were just milling about the foyer.\\n\\nSo that was the first fifteen minutes of the evening and it only went down hill after that.  They seated our party of ten at a table that could barely handle the six of us present in a virtually empty restaurant with every table having a \\"reserved\\" sign on it. The waiter came over and took half of the table's drink order.  Yes...  half.  The rest of our party began to trickle in, and they moved us to a bigger table (don't get excited about the tables with the taps, since they don't work) with a new waitress, who had to then hunt down our old waiter (who never did bother putting in the half order of drinks he taken).  \\n\\nAt this point I wanted to leave.  I had been there 45 minutes and hadn't even had a drink order taken yet.  The guest of honor hadn't showed yet, so we really couldn't leave, but I certainly made my irritation known. After ONE HOUR exactly I got a drink.  Indeed it took ONE HOUR to get a drink.  \\n\\nAnd THEN the host came over and complained that we had twelve people instead of ten and were using extra stools.  I asked if he felt we should have two of party stand, and he said YES!  \\n\\nWe got appetizers (chicken wings) and it tasted like they simply bought chicken nuggets and drowned them in Tabasco.  \\n\\nAt around 6:00 the live music started.  I don't care for live music in pubs because it makes it difficult to talk, but usually it starts much later so I can avoid it.  Waxy's (ick) is a loud place anyway, but add in the music and after shouting for a half an hour, I had to leave.  That's two hours of my life I'll never get back.\\n\\nThe decor is nice, and the waitress we finally got was exceptional and apologetic, but even that was not enough to make up for the fiasco which started the evening.\\n\\nBad service, bad atmosphere, bad food, high prices.

Talk about unaware of your surroundings in general.\\n\\nFood - 1 - This was the part I am always most concerned about. I ordered the Lamb Tsukemen since most of their other items were out. If you don't know, this is different than ramen in that it's usually a thicker and/or more potent broth. The noodles also come separate and are usually soba/wheat which you dip in the broth since this type will soak it up better and also stay separated on the side. My broth was sure potent but it was like someone dumped too much soy in it so not in the enjoyable way. My noodles were, what I'm guessing, are the standard noodles they use in their ramen dishes. Granted it was now about 20m after I received my items since I had gone back to get my purse, but my noodles had hardened together into a giant mushy glob.

I'm generally not a huge gyro fan, but this one was delicious with the right amount of sauce and lots of meat with very fresh vegetables.  The pita was thinner and tastier than I've seen in many place (where it usually counts as flatbread, really), and they toasted it just a bit for extra flavor.  On the side they had delicious potato slices (they called them 'chips'), that were lightly fried and seasoned and not at all greasy - very crispy.

We've lived in Atlanta for almost 8 years, and I can't believe it's taken us this long. But we were going to see a show nearby at the Cobb Energy Centre and went on a friend's recommendation.\\n\\nThe show started at 7pm, so we made the earliest reservation, at 5:30. SInce we were a bit anxious about getting to the show on time, we got there a half-hour early. The hostess was more than accomodating, inviting us to sit in their lounge until our table was ready. My wife had a cinammon-apple flavored cocktail called Pomme (which she loved). Mine was called Las Ventas, and it was a variation on the old Blood and Sand that matadors traditionally had to celebrate their Bullfights in Spain. It was a mix of Spanish Brandy and Vermouth with a dash of Jamaican bitters and a splash of Orange Juice.\\n\\nThe hostess then showed us to our table promptly at 5:30. She sat us by the window with a wonderful view of the Chattahoochee River. We had an awesome server named James. His style is a pleasure for foodies like us, he makes recommendations based on his own personal tastes, patiently describes how the dishes are prepared, and puts no pressure on us to hurry with our order. I highly recommend him for his great service.\\n\\nMy wife went with Canoe's staple dishes. For an appetizer, she chose the House Smoked Salmon which comes on a crispy potato cake with goat cheese sandwiched between them. For dinner she selected the roasted rabbit with bacon ravioli and sweet potato hash. She was very happy with her dish especially since, having never tried rabbit before, she went into it with some trepidation. I took a taste and found it to be very tender and without the gamey taste that makes many people, including her, quite nervous about trying it. Bacon Ravioli is not my thing, but she loved it so much she texted her friend about it while we ate dinner.\\n\\nI went a bit farther afield. I had the duck pastrami appetizer. Thinly sliced, it comes with pumpernickel toast, pickled radish and blood orange, all perfect accompaniments. For dinner, I was delighted to try what they call the Fork-Tender Lamb Shank. So often Lamb can be prepared incorrectly, and it's not a fun meat to try when that is the case. But this lived up to it's name, falling off the bone with little pressure from my utensil. The risotto, Kale and Mushroom hash at the bottom of the plate was equally delicious.\\n\\nAnyone who visits Canoe should save room for their wonderful desserts. I had their popular Chocolate Grotto, a chocolate dome shell that when cracked, gushes with a mousse-like concoction of hazelnut-salted caramel goodness. It's all finsihed off with liberal helpings of crunchy pretzel dust. Here, it was my wife who eschewed their traditional dish to try the warm, cranberry-orange bread pudding with white chocolate sauce. It's hard to believe that any dessert can top the one I had, especially since I'm a chocoholic. But somehow, the bread pudding does it. Both fantastic ways to finish the meal.\\n\\nNow, Canoe is not inexpensive. But given the location, romantic atmosphere, fantastic service, and most of all, excellent food, it is a perfect demonstration of the oft-used expression, \\"You get what you pay for.\\" In this case, we got one of the best dining experiences we've had in quite some time. Thanks, Canoe."},{"name":"Soul Vegetarian No  2","address":"652 N Highland Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Yum. The vegan movement is here!

That would not deter me from going back again. The space was comfortably full, which was really nice to see."},{"name":"Fresh To Order","address":"851 N Alfaya Trl","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"The Creamy Chicken Vegetable soup was my favorite. This soup was deliciously smooth and creamy, filled with flavor in every bite. This will be my \\"go-to\\" soup when it's chilly out or if I'm in a mood for soup! There are chunks of chicken and sliced vegetables (ie carrots, etc) found in this dish.\\n\\nThe Wild Mushroom soup was made with Button and Portobello mushrooms creamed by a processor as well as small-diced mushroom for that minor chunky texture. I thought that this soup is a little sweet and easy to eat. This is my second favorite soup from f2o.\\n\\nThe Tomato Bisque soup is also another sweet but subtle soup with a hint of carrots.\\n\\nThe Chicken Tortilla soup isn't creamy like the others and the flavors are a bit too intense for my taste. The Corn Chowder soup to the left of the Chicken Tortilla is spicy, but sweet. The spiciness comes from the jalape√±os snuck into it and the corn chunks provide a second texture to the creamy processed soup itself.\\n\\nIn my opinion, the Ahi Tuna Steak has a nice, thin, crunchy coat made of rosemary, sesame seeds and crushed panko. The tuna was fried for 35 seconds before seared and laid on Asian cabbage with an apricot-ginger Dijon vinaigrette drizzled on top.\\n\\nThe Almond Chicken Skewers is one of my favorite dishes at f2o! The chicken is cut thin and has an almond rosemary crust. It is served with two sauces: a Thai peanut sauce made with peanut butter and a spicy chili with marmalade.\\n\\nTender Crispy Calamari added onto a Mediterranean Salad is recommended with an Oriental apricot dressing that I also suggest you to order for the salad! The calamari is also fried with lemon slices coated with the same crunchy coating. The crispy calamari and lemon slices are delicious, but the lemon slices aren't overpowering or tart if you try one!\\n\\nThe Spinach Salad was served with raspberry vinaigrette and bourbon filet steak added to it. Alone, the Spinach Salad contains a seasonal fruit (this one had shredded mango!), spinach, strawberries, blue cheese crumbles, dried cherries, and almonds. On the other hand to the last salad mentioned, this is sweeter and refreshing. However, the sweetness is very bold so try not to drench your salad in the vinaigrette!\\n\\nThe Salmon Panini consists of bourbon-marinated salmon, avocado, lettuce, tarragon aioli, and corn cilantro relish. This is a healthy and delicious Panini. If you'd like to make it a bit healthier, you could switch the white bread to whole-wheat flat bread! I think the avocado is a little dense for my taste and overpowers the salmon. Other than that, I think this is a wonderful Panini with fresh salmon!\\n\\nThe Black Bean Burger consists of black beans, rice, avocado, house pickled jalape√±os, lettuce, tomatoes, corn relish, grilled wheat flat bread, and horseradish honey mustard. Unlike other black bean burgers you may have tried, the black bean patty does not fall apart on you! The texture was better than expected. However, if you don't like jalape√±os like myself, you may wish to order the burger without it because it can get quite spicy!\\n\\nThe Garlic Mashed Potatoes were delicious as ever and didn't even need a drip of gravy on top to add flavor. Instead of Garlic Mashed Potatoes, I prefer the Sweet Mashed Potatoes, as sweet potatoes are a healthier option! Also, f2o did a great job of giving it such flavors with their seasonings and walnuts. \\n\\nIf you'd like a more Southern dish, try the Garlic Jack Grit Cake as a side! This is very dense, but so amazing you'll want to come back for seconds...and thirds.\\n\\nThe Chicken Wild Mushroom is a great dish if you'd like a mix of grilled chicken and mushrooms like I do! The chicken was cooked just right where the juices ran fresh with no hint of rawness to it. The roasted mushrooms on top of the chicken will add its own fresh texture to the meal.\\n\\nThe Grilled Salmon is topped with black bean orange sauce and roasted corn peanut relish. It normally comes with baby greens and wheat berry rice. All I can say is, the salmon is to die for!\\n\\nTo go with it, you should try some house-made teas and lemonades like I did! The house-made teas and lemonades rotate weekly for new and exciting flavors to take a chance to wow you!\\n\\nIf you would like a wine or craft beer instead of tea, lemonade or your ordinary fountain drink, then don't worry! F2o serves wine and craft beers too!\\n\\nA variety of cookies are available on hand and made fresh daily at f2o!!! Some of my favorites include the chocolate chip cookies and peanut butter cookies! They also had white chocolate chip cookies and cranberry cookies.\\n\\nThe brownies were fudgy and like a slice of heaven!

We decided to order a different wine, but instead of offering even the tiniest of samples to ensure that the wine we were spending $68 was worth it, we had to take a chance. Come to find out, we all hated it. We ordered or food, but or appetizers took an hour to arrive over half way through the show. Our dinner hadn't arrived after an hour and a half of waiting through the show. As much as we wanted to enjoy the show, the poor service took away from the entire experience. At the end when our food finally arrived AFTER the show was over, we said don't even bother because we were ready to leave. The server for table 80 on the night of December 22nd by the name of Cyane didn't even apologize blaming it on the kitchen. He was actually quite hostile.

As I walked up I noticed they had a lot of seating.  Tons of what remind me of picnic tables lined up together.  I don't recall seeing any private tables so be ready to make friends or at least be ok with strangers sitting next to you.  My friends were sitting inside so as I walked there the next thing I notices was that the ground was a little muddy.  It had been raining so that happens, just make sure not to wear your nice shoes if you end up in the same situation. I passed by their outdoor stage where a really good brass band was playing.  I wish my friends had grabbed a table by the stage because they sounded great and I would have loved to have a seat where I could focus more on them.  So I got inside and there was a big crowd inside at the bar.  My friends had already gotten food so I had to navigate ordering solo.  We were in the bar area so I think there were some sort of process establish to keep the kitchen area from getting slammed.  My friends told be that I needed this big stick with a number on it to order food which they had kindly lent to the table next to us.  So they retrieved said big stick and I took it up the bar with me.  Had to wait a while because of the big crowd but when I finally got up there it went smooth.  The bartender saw the big stick so I didn't need to do anything but I could see this process being frustrating for those without access to the stick. I ordered a mimosa and french toast.  I was tempted to get the giant manmosa but I was driving so drinking a whole bottle of champagne was not in the plan.  But the mimosa was great so I imagine its larger manly version was just a good but way bigger.  The french toast came out pretty quick and was ok.  It wasn't anything I'd brag about or encourage people to try but as far as bar food goes i'd give it a thumbs up.  There wasn't much else on the menu in terms of food that looked appealing so I don't know what else I'd try but I'd come back just for the vibe, music and drinks."},{"name":"Anna's Taqueria","address":"84 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"There are two things I try not to get involved with debating over the internet-politics and burrito joints.

Back when I used to get annoyed at my then boyfriend, he would bring me Anna's \\"quesadillas\\" as a peace offering. It worked-partially because the food is glorious and partially because I would end up in an Anna's coma and when I woke up I wouldn't remember what I was angry about.\\n\\nYou can get whatever you want in an Anna's \\"quesadilla\\" and it will be amazing.

People complain that the grease and salsa pour out of the tinfoil, but mmmm...I like that. Looks like a burrito, smells like a burrito, but whatever. Apparently the quesadilla is fried and contains more cheese than the burrito. Both noble qualities in my book. The chips are also quite good and they serve Jarritos!\\n\\nUpon moving to Central Square, it was my plan to sit in the MIT cafeteria and find me a geeky suitor who will one day be able to support my expensive tastes.

By now though, we're seriously wondering where the other part of our meal is. I'm sure I caught the eyes of either waitress at least three times before they would look away, not giving me enough time to politely call them over to our table. At this point we have both emptied our glasses of water and were getting impatient, having waited for at least 10 minutes for anyone to come by our table for any reason really.  \\n\\nThe waitress whom was appointed to attending our table, I assume, had gone on her lunch break while we were eating and only when she came back did we finally get some service.

I called her back and she just motioned her hand at me to wait while she went to refill two other tables' waters. The other waitress came to our table instead and I told her that we had also ordered mandu. She looked confused and ran back into the kitchen to get the waitress that had originally took our order. She pointed to the menu and said \\"When I asked, you ordered japchae only and not mandu.\\" I politely, but firmly said no, we also ordered some mandu with our japchae. She said \\"Oh, well we don't have any mandu right now.\\" \\n\\nIf they had mentioned beforehand that they didn't have any mandu, we wouldn't have been so unhappy but the way we were treated, we left as very unhappy customers and were even a bit mad.

There is a strong \\"regulars\\" client base that likes to sit at the bar and tell stories, hence the Cheers feel, but there are also giant flat screens on every wall, dart boards, and pool tables.  In other words, it's perfect for an after work hang out spot, but I wouldn't wanna go there on a date.\\n\\nAs for the food...5 stars.\\n\\nI had the Blue Plate Special- 2 big slices of meatloaf, mashed potatoes, and green beans.

The calamari was very good, actually. And the chili was damn fine to be honest.

The restaurant is relatively small and the tables are quite close together, so you cannot expect much private conversation as neighboring tables can easily hear your conversation.  Once seated, we were given water and greeted by our waiter.  The menu consists of an a la carte and a fixed price menu (called \\"The Supper Club Menu\\").  The evening that we dined, the fixed price menu consisted of 1) an entree course: 'cassoulet' (not called this on the menu but described as such by our waiter) of various meats (duck, sausage, pork, etc.) and red beans and 2) a dessert course:  choice of tea or coffee along with a selection of several dessert.  The fixed price menu was $67 for two.  We ordered a bottle of wine (small but good selection) and the fixed price menu.  The service was excellent but I thought the food was just \\"so-so\\"...primarily because the cassoulet was undercooked with very watery liquid present and the beans were undercooked.  As a result, the texture was unpleasant and the beans were not allowed sufficient cooking time to absorb flavor from the meats.  The consistency was also very soupy as the liquid had not thickened properly.  Overall execution was poor.

I made reservations for 6:30pm on Saturday night.  We get there and everyone looks confused, then they had us wait in the lobby with probably 10 other people.  We didn't know what was going on since we had never been before, but it didn't seem like they took our reservation seriously.  15 minutes pass and got a seat next to the window, perfect!\\n\\nIt took them about 10-15 minutes or so after we sat down before we actually got acknowledged.

We were all discussing how all our grudges left the door.  The best lebonese food in town thus far!

I really wanted to enjoy my experience, however was left leaving with a feeling of bewilderment since I wasn't sure what I experienced, which I will explain below.\\n\\nFirst, let me clearly explain the ambience of this establishment.  As other reviewers have said, it's inside an Embassy Suites hotel.  The strange part is that it's literally in the lobby of the hotel.  The view from our table was indoor hotel elevators going up and down, and of the front doors of the rooms going at least a dozen floors up.  This design is simply the Embassy Suites style, which is nice if you're a guest at the hotel however not what I'm expecting when I want to have a fine dining experience.  To help separate the restaurant from the lobby of the hotel they do have a wood panelling that wraps around that acts as a fence but doesn't do much to pull that fine dining experience together while you sit and watch elevators and their guests go up and down.  While I did read other reviews, I still had in my head that it would be a restaurant with four walls inside the hotel.  Again, this Ruth Chris is situated in the middle of the lobby of hotel.  I'm still scratching my head on who at Ruth Chris headquarters decided this location matched their brand and would be a great location.  \\n\\nSecond, the food was mediocre at best.  When you factor in the prices you're paying, there are better values out there.  My wife and I started with the calamari appetizer which was good but nothing special.  We each ordered the petit filet since we wanted to save room for dessert and also ordered the shoestring potato fries and the mushrooms as side dishes.  \\n\\nThe steaks come out on a 500 degree plate (literally), which is stilly to me since it now becomes dangerous to want to move things around on the table if needed.  Apparently this is supposed to be part of the Ruth Chris charm.  Moving on, the filets themselves had gristle and fat.  The filet my wife received had a large portion of gristle and fat hanging on the side of the steak, which we couldn't figure out why they didn't trim off.  I can't remember the last time I couldn't eat part of my filet at a nice restaurant because it was literally inedible.  \\n\\nAs for the sides, the mushrooms look like they came out of a can on a plate with a bunch of yellow water.  Nothing at all special about the mushrooms, pretty bland and not a lot of flavor.  The shoestring potato fries arrive in a large metal cone and are so small and fried that they became devoid of flavor and were to challenging to eat and truly enjoy.  They also came with a side of ordinary ketchup, not a huge deal but if I'm the management at Ruth Chris I might want to come up with ways to differentiate myself such as having some different ketchup flavors to dip and enjoy with the fries.  I know that I ordered fries at a \\"fancy\\" restaurant but I've seen some classy places (and fun/trendy hang outs) do some original things with ordinary items.\\n\\nThankfully we saved room for dessert as it was the best part of the meal, but uninspired and from what we could tell simply heated up and served with ice cream.  We ordered the Apple Crumb Tart dessert which came with vanilla ice cream on top.  It was good, but didn't feel there was real effort put into it since it seemed mass produced.  \\n\\nI always like to give credit where it's due, and everybody was very nice and did a good job at keeping the flow of the meal going.  It just seemed the service wasn't as polished as you might expect for this tier of restaurant.  For my wife and I, we were trying to enjoy a special date night out and while it wasn't a disaster by any means we just look back and can't say we would ever return based on our expectations, the prices, and what was experienced.  For me, if this restaurant literally had it's on 4 walls inside the hotel I would be giving this location 2 stars. There are a lot of other steak places that are working hard to earn their business and providing top level service and food, and unfortunately I have to say Ruth Chris is living on the legacy of their name.  \\n\\nHelpful Tip: There is complimentary 4 hour valet service when you pull up to the Embassy Suites, if you are eating at Ruth Chris.  Simply have the hostess stamp your card when you arrive so you don't forget."},{"name":"Ration & Dram","address":"130 Arizona Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"I'd rather not post this but I'm no longer getting a response from the manager, Caitlin.

My wife is a vegetarian, so I looked at the menu online and found only two vegetarian entrees. We decided to still go because we had the coupon and didn't want it to go to waste. When we got there, we had to wait 15-20 minutes for our server to come. We had to keep asking other servers to get him for us and finally after a while he came. I ordered the chicken buffalo sandwich and my wife ordered the squash pasta. I guess we were both misunderstood about that pasta dish because all it was, was shredded squash on a plate. How is a vegetarian supposed to eat that? We've been to many American restaurants and they can come up with better ideas for a vegetarian dish. My wife took one taste and said she was not going to eat it. She said it tasted disgusting and too sweet. We asked the waiter if we can get the black bean burger instead and he said that was fine. I am pretty sure their \\"homemade\\" black bean patty was not actually homemade. It tasted frozen and was falling apart. The buns tasted old and disgusting. My buffalo burger was not that great. It tasted completely average. I don't understand the prices at this place too. The price they have for each entrees is definitely not worth it....way too expensive!

The waitress said, \\"Are you prepared to pay another $1.25 for it?\\" I said no and that I didn't think it was right and wasn't going to pay another $1.25 for more sauce.

Reup in New West is a very close second but heads and tails above any of the downtown options.  As a matter of fact, the BBQ rivals that of  some renowned BBQ spots Texas and Tennessee have to offer that I have sampled.  Only a few quibbles prevent a five star rating.  The place is usually quite busy and service can be a bit...leisurely.  I know this is a common Vancouver problem because of a workplace shortage so it probably isnt their fault.  The sides are fantastic with the beans the perfect mix of texture and taste and the slaw perfect to my liking, but it would be nice if there were more sides on offer.  And the last complaint is about the BBQ sauce.  It is a fantastic sauce, but it would be nice to have a bit more than the small bowl that the meal comes with.

I had been here for the opening and the food was spectacular and so was dying to come back.  Smoked salmon tamara was a dip with roe on it and smoked salmon infused.  It was outrageously good and served with Nu's pita bread which has a slight lime taste to it and has the right amount of crisp, I could have just kept on eating this all night long.  \\n\\nNext we had the lobster (yes, yes, yes) souvlakia which of course we had to order two skewers because I am a pig about lobster and won't ever ever ever share.  Yeah, and I don't care if you tell yo momma on me because the lobster was very tender.  I only wished my girlfriend had turned her head away so I could have stole her's too!\\n\\nI have never seen calamari made the way Nu did it, stuffed with herbs and other stuff (couldn't tell as we gobbled it down fast).  Not chewy but coooked perfectly as calmari is an easy dish to overcook and I have had it the consistency of chewing gum - yeck!\\n\\nThe dolmades did not have ground beef or lamb but tuna instead which made it rather tasty.  \\n\\nWe did concede and ordered a plain tomato salad but the tomatoes were amazing fresh and the dish complemented our heavier appetizers.\\n\\nAnd what meal is complete without dessert even if it meant being late for the ballet (we did make it with a minute to spare).  When I had seen the the pomegrante walnet sorbet on the menu, I didn't have to look any further.  It was bursting with flavour although I couldn't really taste any walnut except for the walnut they sprinkled on top.  It came with a light crisp meringue cookie.  My girlfriend ordered the goat cheese cheesecake which she said was divine and to my jealous heart, they also gave her a scoop of pomegrante walnut sorbet and meringue cookie.  \\n\\nThe nice touch to dessert was that I was able to order a decaf Americano, something that has never been offfered to me before.  But it didn't stop there.  That night Harry Kambolis' uncle was at the restaurant greeting customers and actually came over and took our dessert order as we were in a hurry.  He also took the liberty of bringing over to us a complementary order of Loukoumades which were light balls of dough drizzled with honey and cinnamon.  Yum.. More sorbet please?\\n\\nThe only disappointment of this meal was the fact that the cook decided that he wasn't happy with the lamb ribs so that was subsituted for the calmari which was comped to us.   My girlfriend had also ordered the ouzo martini which she didn't like so they took it away and gave her another drink.  Some places would just tell you to buck up since you ordered it.  Not Nu.  With such great service and spectacular food and views, i will definitely be back. \\n\\nThey also have happy hour special from 5-7 in which three appetizers are $7.  What a steal.\\n\\nOh and should I add that on some nights they have belly dancers?  Hmmm, I thought you'd like that!"},{"name":"Cafe Java- Austin","address":"11900 Metric Blvd, Ste K","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"They're always pretty good, some days are better than others.

Sorry I want to like it but my stomach and my conscience just wont let me.\\n\\nI went to Tacos back when it was in imminent danger of closing it's doors for good.  I wanted to support this local eatery and I love mexican food.  It was mid winter, the place was freezing ( i dont think they had enough money to pay for heat ) me and my friends didnt even take our winter coats off.  Some people say the decor is homey and charming, i say it's tacky, tattered and kind of sad.  The black and white tile floor makes the place even colder.\\n\\nOur waitress was really nice, but seemed not to speak even one word of english.

My friend suggested we try Zoot. The chef's tasting menu seemed reasonably priced (even with wine pairings) and her previous experience there was pretty amazing. So what better way to spend a lovely summer evening in Austin than drive out to the Hill Country (or, you know, West Hills), and eat some amazing food. And I was further encouraged when we received a call from Chef Scruggs to personally confirm our reservation. \\n\\nZoot turns out to be something of a hit and miss culinary adventure, with its share of the good, the bad and the ugly. First, be aware that the address on Yelp is wrong. Zoot is on Bee CAVE not Bee CAVES. There is an actually Bee CAVES Rd. right off of Bee CAVE, but, if you don't realize that (and we didn't), you'll be driving around in the near vicinity of 360, looking at your google map feeling like an idiot that you can't find a place that ought to be right in front of you. So drive west, and then west some more and you'll eventually come upon Zoot in a rather unassuming building next to an even more unassuming office park. The outside is a sort of modern rendition of retro-ranch house. In other words, pretty typical Texas. They have a nice little patio area with a fountain, but it didn't seem to be in use and could use a little sprucing up.\\n\\nThe ugly: the interior. First, the ceiling has those really awful white, holey tiles that you see in offices and high schools everywhere. You know, the kind you pop out to access the crawl space. I guess that is great if you want to depress people, but go the extra mile and do something about the ceiling. The rest of the interior leaves a little something to be desired as well. It is gray. Gray upholstery. Gray little squares on the wall (I suppose it is meant to be art). Shades of gray and the ceiling from high school. I really think a higher end dining place needs to pay a little more attention to details like interior design. Gray does not stimulate the appetite...\\n\\nThe good: the service was great. The wait staff was attentive, thorough with their explanations, and really does their best to give you a great dining experience. Scruggs may not know design, but he does a good job with training the wait staff.\\n\\nMy friend and I both ordered the Chef's Tasting menu with wine pairings. But we decided we wanted to also taste the cold smoked corn soup and ordered one order on the side. Instead of just brining us a bowl of soup to split in addition to our tasting menu, they just went ahead and included the soup for both of us with an additional wine pairing (and no charge for the extra wine). So, yeah, the service was great.\\n\\nThe other goods: the veggies. Our first \\"dish\\" was an amuse bouche of little tiny heirloom tomatoes. Just perfect tomatoes, sweet and acidic, great way to stimulate the palate. The next dish was a deconstructed sort of Asian salad that consisted of some lightly picked cucumbers (sort of like a Japanese style Kyuri Aza-zuke), basil, fried cellophane noodles, daikon and carrots, and then some delicious boudin blanc. It was somewhere between tseunemono and deconstructed banh mi (with the sausage, daikon and carrots). Good stuff. I can't remember the exact wine pairings we had (and sadly, they didn't print it on the menu), but I don't recall thinking the wines didn't work with any dish. Next, again, another deconstructed sandwich/salad. This time it was half BLT, half iceberg lettuce wedge salad (except without the iceberg lettuce). Perfect little bites of pork belly, beautiful tomatoes and lettuce and a creamy, but not overpowering play on ranch dressing. Comfort food classed up. Oh, and also sprinkled with some pepitas as a little twist. This salad really let the ingredients shine--and shine they did. It takes some balls to serve some butter lettuce and a tomato on a $80 prixe fixe menu (even with pork belly), but I can honestly say they had some amazing flavor. \\n\\nThe meal peaked with the 3rd course (including at our request)--the cold smoked corn soup. I would have never dreamed that corn soup would be one of the best things I've ever eaten, but this stuff is my new addiction. Smokey, rich and sweet, and yet jumping with tons of complexity. I don't know how or what they did to make this, but I could have eaten buckets of this soup. They serve it with a piece of jalapeno cornbread, and on top of that a fine dice of bell pepper, strawberries (!), and basil chiffonade. If you let the cornbread soak for a minute then get a bite with the bread, the berries, peppers and basil, oh my, party in your mouth! Where Zoot failed me was the proteins. The next courses, halibut in a 5 spice broth and NY Strip on a mustardy potato gratin, were both misses. Mostly because the meat in both cases was a little overcooked and under seasoned. So if I went back, I think I'd do the Farmer's Menu (all veggies)."},{"name":"Oga's Japanese Cuisine","address":"915 Worcester St","city":"Natick","stars":"4","text":"My daughter's favorite.

I found this restaurant via friend's check-in on Facebook. I looked it up on Yelp and saw 4.5 stars & knew I had to check it out.\\n\\nThe Bangkok's interior is very small consisting of only 4 tables for 2, so clearly it's a takeout & delivery restaurant. The menu is fairly expansive, hence I browsed through some food photos to find the most visually scrumptious-looking dish. I've gotten takeout twice and have tried the Pad Thai with Chicken, Indo Fried Rice, Bangkok Wings, and Bun Bo Hue. It was great because I would never order several carb entrees if I dined in. I also think it's reasonable to judge a restaurant based on these \\"easy\\" dishes.\\n\\nPad Thai with Chicken ($10): very tasty and not as sour, mushy, and heavy as the pad thai that I'm normally used to. In this day and age, most restaurants over-season their food and cause sodium overloads, not the Bangkok, they seem to care about sodium levels!\\n\\nInfo Fried Rice ($13): my favorite dish here so far & one of the better fried rice that I've had in a while! It comes loaded with 6-7 large pieces of shrimp along with a fried egg and tasty grilled satay chicken, which somewhat justifies the costliness of this dish. The pik pow sauce is the highlight & makes this dish so delicious and unique.\\n\\nBangkok Wings ($6): while it was perfectly fried and juicy in the inside and tasted fine, the portions were small as there were only 5 average-sized pieces. I'd pass.\\n\\nBun Bo Hue ($11): The steak and tendon was so fresh and melt-in-your-mouth tender! The broth was not spicy at all, but it was tasty. It was a tad salty, but not overly so. The noodles were your standard rice noodles, which I actually prefer to the standard thicker noodle that Vietnamese restaurants usually served for this dish.\\n\\nThe smiley lady at the front was pleasant & friendly and provided great customer service. It's unfortunate some restaurants don't realize these seemingly small gestures go a long way. There was a small mishap where utensils and napkins were not provided the first time, however it was provided when I came here on my second visit.\\n\\nFriendly service and tasty food is the Bangkok in a nutshell."},{"name":"Ginza Japanese Restaurant","address":"1002 Beacon St","city":"Brookline","stars":"3","text":"Good Fresh sushi restaurant.

Think of the nastiest regional beer you have in your home state.  You know, the type of beer you used to drink warm from the can in the back of a pickup truck or in an abandoned parking lot in high school (was it just me?).  Then imagine it being served in a bar in New England like it's something special and CHARGING $4.25 for it!  Imagine watching some unknowning joker order it.

We were hungry but that seemed manageable since the food coming out of the kitchen looked delicious. We didn't get seated until an hour later and we were famished at that point. Apparently the table they quoted us for had been there for four hours and showed no signs of leaving. The hostess was super apologetic even though it was not their fault.\\n\\nOn to the food: I ordered the shrimp and grits and loved it! The shrimps were cooked to perfection and the grits were creamy, savory, and flavorful. The portions are huge - even with a ravenous appetite, I still had a plenty of grits left over. I also ordered a side of home fries because my eyes are way bigger than my stomach. They were not to my liking though. Everyone else in my party enjoyed their food!

No where to be found. I found it odd that the items for our meals were brought long before our appies.\\n\\nWe waited another 15minutes for our appies, and our drinks were finally brought to us. Finger food appies, but no napkins/cutlery on our table, and the waitress disappeared before we could ask for them.

Luckily, there was a diner sitting two tables behind us that had flagged her down, so hubby was able to wave at her.\\n\\nThe food was ok - nothing special. I wasn't overly fond of their gravy...to me it tasted like Christmas - too much clove/nutmeg for daily dining.\\n\\nThe waitress's explanation for the delay in getting our drinks was that they were short on glasses - down to their last two racks because of breakage etc. Personally, I don't care. From where I was sitting, I could see their bar area, full of large wine glasses and beer glasses...why not use a beer glass? Or bring us wine goblets of water and explain the situation rather than just leaving us thirsty for 20 minutes?\\n\\nAll in all, I was not very happy with the experience.

There was nothing wrong with the content, the presentation, or the flavor.  It came out piping hot and right on time with my wife's meal.  \\n\\n...I just didn't like that it was fried.   No big deal though, I've ordered meals at places that came out and wasn't what I was expecting.  I eat what I can, take it as a learning experience and remember not to order it again...\\n\\nWell, they pulled out all the stops and after they cleared our plates, the manager came over to apologize about my meal, and sent out three (!) desserts as an apology.  They even wrote a nice 'happy birthday' message, with a single candle for the all-important birthday wish, on a plate with their signature caramel popcorn sundae.    The other two desserts (an all-new blueberry sorbet, and a triple death-by-chocolate thingy with caramel inside), along with some tasty cappuccino, pleased the palette and rounded out the end of a great birthday dining experience.

We weren't seated until 8pm, even though we had 14 of the 16 people. \\n\\nWe finally got seated, ordered our food, and chatted until the hibachi chefs came out. They put on a pretty good show, although they do spray you with water (so be careful of clothing). When they finished cooking they started cleaning the hibachi grill... My plate and my boyfriend's plate were empty (once again, it was my boyfriend's birthday). I asked the chef, \\"What happened to our dinner?\\" Turns out the waitress taking the order and the chefs who received the orders had some miscommunication. We received our dishes from the kitchen after everybody had already finished eating. The waitress never came back to ask if we needed more drinks.\\n\\nAfter eating, they brought out the cake. We bought the cake along with candles to make \\"33\\". They brought out the cake with only a \\"3\\" candle as if it were for a 3-year-old! We specifically GAVE them the candles and they had one simple job to do! At this point, I just wanted to leave. Needless to say, we will never come back and I highly recommend choosing a different restaurant if you have a large party with you."},{"name":"Gus's World Famous Fried Chicken","address":"5486 Peachtree Rd","city":"Chamblee","stars":"3.5","text":"i don't know what the fuss is about. first visit the chicken on the bone is spicy but it is not particularly flavoral. the small side size is a pathetic excuse for a serving.  maybe an ounce of the item. second visit got the tenders and they were dry, so dry they were too hard to chew. and it's really expensive for fried chicken. a meal for 2of us was $45!!! def not worth that much."},{"name":"Marco's Pizza","address":"7414 University Blvd","city":"Winter Park","stars":"3.5","text":"As far as pizza chains go, this one is fantastic.

Move it along. We're hungry.\\n\\nWith my recent Sichuan experimentation in my home kitchen, I was interested to see how Cantonese differed. While writing this post, I did some research, and discovered that many of the dishes/ingredients we ate at Wan Lai are Cantonese mainstays - congee, century eggs, and beef chow fun are all staples. Similar to Sichuan, stir-frying, braising, and steaming are the primary cooking methods, but Cantonese sauces are often much lighter and less intense and full of heat as Sichuan. The most often used spice is Chinese 5 spice, which can actually vary and have more than 5 spices, though anise, fennel, and cinnamon are almost always going to be included.\\n\\nSo there's a small bit of knowledge. But how did it taste? Well, it was one of the best all around Chinese meals I've had. I love the heat and boldness of Sichuan, but Wan Lai is rocking. You need to get out there and try it. Order a ton like we did, and you'll be left with enough leftovers for 3-4 meals. \\n\\nDish #1: Century egg congee. The eggs looked like mushrooms to me at first, but read the century egg link and you'll understand. Much like porridge, this wasn't bad, but can be very plain tasting if you don't get a big bite of pork and egg. Worth a try if you haven't had it.\\n\\nDish #2: Three dumpling soup. This was ridiculously good. Chinese cabbage (appeared much like broccoli rabe to me), amazing broth, and firm, crunchy (from the shrimp) dumplings. I had to pace myself at this point.\\n\\nDish #3: Beef Chow Fun. I loved the beef and the delicious noodles in this dish. The beef was soft, succulent, and texturally awesome. The flavor of the whole dish was overpowered by bean sprouts to me, but this is definitely something to try.\\n\\nDish #4: Fried Rice. Eh, it was fried rice, not bad, but too filling for me to waste valuable stomach space on, except for the wonderful pork mixed in with the rice.\\n\\nDish #5: Ong choy water spinach. Tubular and leafy greens, saut√©ed with garlic in a light sauce. I loved this, please try it. \\n\\nDish #6: Pork belly and taro casserole. This was one of the casseroles that takes 20 minutes or so for them to prepare, but I didn't even notice the wait with all the other food on our table. The sauce was rich, very sweet, obvious 5 spice flavor, and there was tons of pork belly and taro. I thought taro is a root vegetable, but you actually eat the \\"corm\\", which is like a root, but it's actually an underground stem.\\n\\nDish #7: Garlic fried chicken - Ridonkulous. Perfectly crispy and covered with garlic, you are going to want to savor the skin on this bird.\\n\\n\\nHmmm, now I am hungry for more!"},{"name":"The Original Dinerant","address":"300 SW 6th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"How I heard of this place: On a walking food-cart tour in September, my husband and I met a group of women from New Jersey - who are often in Portland on business.

The first dip was so full of huge chunks of artichoke that you couldn't eat it with the stale tortilla chips that it came with.  The fondue was thin, gritty, and served with a very small plate of stale bread cubes and 5 slices of sausage for $11.  I agree with the other reviewers who have commented on the service as well.  The hostesses are very young and inexperienced and have not been very friendly either time I was in.

I'm super thankful this is the closest one to me!!\\n\\nHow to Get There: It's at the corner of Northside Drive and Powers Ferry, right off exit 22 from I-285. One way lanes here, so just be careful when you're getting in and out of the parking lot.  Plenty of parking though, even on a busy Sunday morning. BTW, I would avoid Sunday brunch until after 1:00pm, otherwise you could be waiting a while for a seat. \\n\\nAmbiance: I mean, it's Waffle House. It's cleaner than most. \\n\\nFood: I'm sure we all have our favorites. I used to love their 2-3 egg combo, but the price on those things keeps going up. Patty Melt and Texas Cheesesteak Melt are great too. And of course I love my Chocolate Chip covered Waffle. I prefer my hashbrowns smothered (with onions). Anyways, back to the price. I'm glad they've started offering a pretty large value menu. You can get 15 meals for $5, including the drink! Some good options here are the Sausage Egg/Cheese/Grits Bowl with a biscuit; and my latest discovery-- Texas Sausage Melt with Hashbrowns. It's not quite Texas Cheesesteak level good, but definitely great value for the price. Whatever greasy, tasty breakfast food you want, as long as it's not a pancake, they got it!\\n\\nService: This is where 1508 shines! Not only do the team members work efficiently during rush times, they still provide excellent service the whole way. Amber deserves a star because she remembered my order from over six weeks ago when I only visit here maybe once a month. I thought she was just sweet talking as most WaHo servers do, calling everyone \\"sweetie\\" and such. But she's the real deal!

Customer service was awful, and I will tell my story here:\\n\\nSunday April 28, 9:30/10:30 AM. \\nI pull up to the drive through and see NOBODY in the parking lot or drive through. I am greeted over the speaker by a woman, and since I have never been to taco bell for breakfast(I know, I'm lame) I ask her \\"do you guys have a protein bowl?\\" her answer \\"no.\\" That's it, just a blunt \\"no\\" and then silence. So I ask \\"is there a way I could add egg to the power bowl or maybe substitute for something in the power bowl? Her answer \\"I mean...you can add egg on the side.\\" After that, silence. I then say to her \\"there isn't anyone in line behind me, do you mind if I have a second to look at everything?\\" and she doesn't even respond. Typically, I would think a \\"sure let me know when you're ready\\" or something along those lines would suffice. But instead, she immediately replaced herself with a different guy. Literally maybe 10 seconds after I asked for a second, I hear a male voice say \\"what can I get for you today?\\" So at this point, I am feeling rushed and I just order random stuff off the breakfast menu that I didn't even want. I pulled up to the window, gave the young man my money, and then was told to wait at the pit for my food. Seconds before I drove away, I looked through the window and literally saw the lady YELL at this guy \\"come on! hurry up!\\" First of all, that is NOT how you treat your employees. You do not need to yell at them like they are in a sweat shop. When he came over, I asked him what had happened? Because she didn't even give me a response, but just put him on the headset instead? He then told me that she was \\"in a bad mood because of stress from the night crew.\\" I then responded to him with the fact that I too work in a stressful, fast paced environment and have to deal with hundreds of angry customers in my face daily. Just because you are stressed or having a bad day DOES NOT MEAN YOU TAKE IT OUT ON CUSTOMERS. Also, there was NO ONE in the drive through or parking lot, so it's not like there were a bunch of customers inside or out. I wish I knew this lady's name but her attitude was so awful and I promise you I will just go to the taco bell on 620 in Lakeway instead because they are always very kind and hook it up big time for me with the power bowls! Again, I wound up ordering random stuff I didn't really want. I wasted money and time, and I probably should have just driven away. I hope you can hear me Taco Bell at Four Points, because I am very upset with the way I was treated today. What's funny is, I am never that person to go on a tangent like this unless I find it very necessary. I can't believe this chick is a manager. I will leave with this--the young man whose name I didn't get was a tall brown haired white guy with colored eyes I believe. He was very nice and did nothing wrong. Another time, a young lady with long blonde hair (Chelsea I think?) was so sweet and got my order right!

Even so, someone wanted it to be a special night for me, and although the experience was pretty good, it was nothing close to a 5-star meal, unless we're operating by Applebee's standards.\\n\\nMost of the people at Canoe are great: the hostess friendly and effervescent, the wait staff well-trained and attentive, the runners efficient. The setting, especially on this evening, was wonderful. I was led to a table on the patio, which is not screened, but has fans set to a sufficient speed to keep mosquitoes away. Mist hung low against the Chattahoochee and as the sun went into hiding and the outdoor lights flickered into life, the fog thickened and began to blanket the river banks. Hummingbirds flitted to and fro, enticed by the feeder a few feet away. I was not alone in celebrating. Most guests around me were there for birthdays or anniversaries.\\n\\nMy server was Ken, who seemed a bit green but was nonetheless well-practiced in the menu. The first thing to annoy me about the experience was that Canoe has the typical in-and-out American restaurant feel. From the time I was seated, it was clear that, although there would be no explicit pressure to speed the meal along, all of the servers have either been directed or see it in their interest to whiz through as many tables as possible. In such ambience, and with the expectation of a wonderful meal in store, I had no desire to be rushed through the process as though I was party #132 at Macaroni Grille. In the words of Mallory Knox, \\"Next time, don't be so fucking eager!\\"\\n\\nI drank water, though I'd been craving ginger ale, because Canoe has only bottled Seagram's. I have a dream that, one day, great restaurants will put as much focus into serving wonderful non-alcoholic beverages as into beer, wine and spirits. A selection of fresh bread was brought - sourdough, cranberry raisin and walnut, olive, and a peppery flatbread. I tried all but the sourdough and they were very good. I don't know why it is so uncommon to find untoasted bread with a meal, but I was glad to have it that night, served with softened butter. The olive bread was my favorite.\\n\\nI started with the warm cheese salad and the corn soup. The salad of spinach and endive was topped with a thick slice of slightly melted sheep's milk cheese from Spain, chopped bacon and pecans, and a sweet and tart cherry vinaigrette ($12). I loved it. The savory bacon and brie-like cheese went well with the nuts and the sweet bite of the dressing. The soup, however, did not impress me. It was a velvet blend, with the subtle flavor of sweet corn and an avocado cream that did little to enhance the serving ($8). All I could imagine as I ate it was that it was probably little different from what is served in a typical nursing home.\\n\\nI was allowed no time to rest and appreciate the surroundings after finishing the soup and salad. The main course arrived within moments. The scallops ($30) were served over a creamy concoction that I forgot to ask about, and were topped with potato sticks, and diced asparagus and bacon. The scallops themselves were firm and had a strong seafood flavor. Personally, I prefer them to be buttery and to melt in my mouth, but this wasn't my plate and I was alone in my dissatisfaction with them. I ordered the quail ($26), which was stuffed with a foie gras and brioche dressing and served atop greens, with a couple of bites of roasted plum. Though cooked to a medium-rare temperature, the quail was quite dry on its own. Together with all of the other ingredients, each bite was much better, but the flavors that I'd have loved to have detected - the creamy deliciousness of the liver, the buttery richness of the stuffing - were overpowered by the sweetness of the plum and dryness of the bird. Perhaps too much subtlety, again. Sure, there are times when we love the subtle sensuality of 1940s film noir, but also times we want to hear Asa Akira beg to have her rectum damaged. I'd have liked to have had a better blend of the two from Canoe.\\n\\nLuckily, the latter was exactly what I got for dessert, in the form of the Chocolate Grotto (although now on second thought I'm reconsidering the previous sodomy reference given the context of cacao) - a small chocolate torte topped with a hazelnut and caramel cr√®me, encased in a hard chocolate shell, and then dusted with salt and pretzel crumbs. Amazing. I restrained myself with such small bites, savoring each with such delight.\\n\\nThis would have been a 4-star meal at $60. Unfortunately, it cost twice that, so I must raise the bar substantially and Canoe didn't deliver at that level. Another five bucks to the valet to drive my car fifty feet and not even open the door for my guest was a final disappointment.\\n\\nOverall, 6/10."},{"name":"Bukowski Tavern","address":"1281 Cambridge St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3","text":"WARNING: Walking in here expecting anything in the vain of Charles Bukowski besides the fact that they have alcoholic beverages is A.)

Their broth is pretty good and is sometimes better than other Pho places.  My only complaint is like my pho very hot and all of the Pholicious places I've tried only have a mildly warm broth.  I'm not sure if its because they don't have a full blown kitchen... I mean they literally make you pho in the middle of the food court, I don't think they make it in a kitchen in the back and then carry it out you, although to some degree I wish they did.  I usually their beef and beef balls combo but their fish balls option is good as well."},{"name":"Basil Thai","address":"2501 W Parmer Ln, Ste 550","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I have been here twice and each time was not disappointed.

The food is pre-made buffet style and if you sit down to eat you can't simply order the food at the counter then find a table.  The staff has to take your order, get the food from the pre-made counter then serve it to you.  If you're going to have wait staff and I have to tip I expect the food to be made fresh.  It's all about expectations and presentation.  This would work best for take outs or self seating with no wait staff.\\n\\nFood:\\nI had the ox tail which was ok.  I think we went a bit late so you can tell it was sitting out for awhile.  I also tried the goat, which was better.  The sides tasted old and disappointing.  The portions are huge, that would be very good if the food was better.\\n\\nOverall:\\nIf you ignore the set up and pre-made food I think this place has potential.

The exterior of the focaccia had a crisp cracker-like crunch to the bite and the mozzarella provided a nice cheesy-pull. I was a bit worried at first that the feta would be a bit strong in this sandwich but my concerns were unfounded. Sipping the passion fruit soda on a hot day like this was quite refreshing.\\n\\nI returned over 2 months later and ordered their Tuna Melt on Toast ($6.95) along with a Hot Chocolate ($3.40).

When that isn't understood and a party of 2 sits down to be told they recommend between 5 and 7 dishes for our party, it starts the experience off in a negative manner.  We settled on 4 dishes.  One was excellent, the other 2 were good, and we did not care for the bread.  It had quite a pungent taste, even for somebody used to red winter wheat.  The bottom line though is that there are too many amazing restaurants in this town where I can go have a really great meal for $125 and not leave hungry.

You can also get the sausage on a bed of greens if you don't want the bun. \\n- 1 Lolo's corned beef hash - six day house-cured angus brisket, herb roasted potatoes, poblano peppers, onions, kale, & cherry tomatoes, topped w/ hollandaise and two poached eggs.

The Centex Mezze board was a no-brainer and will be enjoyed again. I base my review on my meal alone: the 8oz wagyu burger.\\n\\nI love a good burger. Heck, I'll even love a bad one under the right conditions. So, when I pull up to a place than focuses on quality meats with big, beautiful brioche buns bandying about, you can bet on the words that will leave my lips once the waitstaff arrive. In the end, two of our party ordered the half-pounders to be cooked medium rare.\\n\\nMine arrived cooked just over medium well, and over seasoned, with an overly forward salinity. My cohort's burger was raw along the midline, indicating that the meat was perhaps too cold before grilling. Given the difference in the two, I imagine that my patty had already assumed room temperature at the time of cooking, with only the other being tested for doneness.\\n\\nThis phenomenon of raw-being-served-as-rare is not unique to Dai Due. In fact, it only ever seems to happen at premium places. But, I've had many $10 burgers that were properly cooked, as are my own, so it's well within reason to do so. For a $20 burger, this detail of doneness simply cannot be overlooked.\\n\\nI will no doubt return to DD and will, no doubt, have improved experiences.

My wife got the chicken fingers, they were good, nothing special (not getting creative on chicken fingers doesn't score or lose them any points, they're chicken fingers).  The prices were reasonable too, which is nice.\\n\\nAs the night went on and the crowd died down, we got more and more personalised service as the bar staff had time to pay attention to us.  The bartender Corrine (sp?) is a nice lady, she took good care of us.\\n\\nThe pool tables are good looking and busy. Crowd skews middle-aged but there are some 20/30-somethings.

No way of knowing that...she didn't ask let me know they were extra and she didn't offer them or attempt to serve. Just asked if I wanted everything and then asked what sides I wanted. I looked at the sides, but none of them were labeled and I had no idea what half of them where. I asked the young lady and the register what was good, but she was to busy texting to pay attention and have an opinion. So I just stuck with the Gyro.

Their breakfast taco menu is the standard build-your-own-taco with two different price levels for either 2 or 3 ingredients. I think the 3 ingredient tacos were $ 2.95 and that's not bad considering the tacos I received were stuffed with brisket and sausage.\\n\\nAnother night, I stopped in to kill time while I was waiting on the bus by grabbing a beer and watching the first quarter of the Mavs-Lakers game that was on.  BTW, this place has 2 or 3 televisions. While I was there, I talked with the manager a while about different BBQ joints around town and he insisted that Blue Ribbon was better than all of the restaurants I said I frequented.  I laughed and told him he was making a bold claim but once that was said, he cut up a little bit of all their meats except for the ribs and gave me a small plate to back up his claim.\\n\\nI won't say he was right and this was the best BBQ I've ever tasted but everything was great. Most BBQ restaurants have either a specialty and/or a weakness. Their turkey was probably more moist than any turkey I've eaten. Their brisket wasn't as moist as some that I've had but it was flavorful and it wasn't dry at all like a guy said in a another review. The sausage was great. Many places serve sausage that's a fatty, congealed tube of filler that is only moist because it's so greasy but this was higher quality without being too dry or overcooked. The last meat I had was the pulled pork which was outstanding. The pork was really light and was so tender it practically dissolved when I started to chew it. To top it all off, it wasn't too salty so you could actually taste the meat.\\n\\n Barbecue is a tricky thing to cook at a restaurant since the best meat is cooked or smoked at low temperatures for an absurdly long period of time which is why most of the great barbecue I've eaten hasn't been at a restaurant.  This place is doing a great job and staying way above average in a town that has a lot of good barbecue."},{"name":"Tamale House East","address":"1707 E 6th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Came one Sunday, not for a brunch , just to meet w/ friends.

The buffet is small, but what lacks in size makes up for its delicious offerings.  \\n\\nThe pakoras has a nice spice to it with a crisp chickpea batter.  I eat those like devouring popcorn at a movie theater.  The marinated onions and red spice sauce packs a lot of heat depending on who makes it that day.  Naan goes well with the dishes and has a nice crispy texture to it.  The tandoori chicken is moist and addicting too.  There are 2 chicken curries usually available:  the orange sauce is a lot more mild,  the red sauce can be very hot and spicy so eat at your own risk.  \\n\\nOverall I enjoy the  buffet.  The mango juice goes great with the food and helps cool the heat.  It is  best to go when they first open since the food is more fresh and plentiful.  Towards the end of lunch, the food tends to run out and not replenish as often as I would like.  Plus, the rice pudding sauce, it's very runny and tastes kind of weird.

But here, they get it darn near perfect and I fell for it in about 30 seconds. The chicken was fall-off-the-bone tender (but thankfully, no bones to be found). The dumplings had excellent consistency - not the best I've had but more than tasty enough. And the soup/sauce was straight-up awesome, with a great herb flavor (with some bay leaves thrown in for good measure) that tied the whole dish together perfectly. I'm a sucker for black-eyed peas so I got that as a side. They were well seasoned and a great addition. They also throw in a piece of cornbread, which is crumbly and sweet, but not overly so. Man, what a heavenly meal to interrupt a dull workday.\\n\\nIMO, Austin is a little short on good Southern cuisine. Hoover's aside, I haven't found much to write home about.

About 1/2 of the things which French people regularly eat simply do not appeal to most Americans (think pig's feet, calf's head, head cheese, blood pudding, tripe, kidneys, sweetbreads, liver, cold jellied meats, chitterling sausages, wild hare, sea snails, rouget, grainy & strong tasting fish soup, etc.). There are Tex-Mex restaurants in Paris, but they are no more authentic than Bistro Niko is a real French dining establishment, as in France. Compromises to satisfy local tastes (such as New Orleans' Chinese restaurants that offer bread pudding) are always necessary, if one wants to stay in business and Bistro Niko follows suit.\\n\\nPeople in Atlanta may think they want to go to a real French restaurant, but, in fact, most are going to want to eat like Americans do, no matter where they are. For example, a number of the other reviewers have indicated that they ordered the cheese plate as an appetizer (typical in the USA), rather than after the main course, as is always done in France. When the late Gilbert Le Coze came to the USA from Paris and opened Le Bernardin in NY (before opening Brassserie Le Coze in Atlanta) he expressed shock at the way Americans ordered their meals. He commented that he sold more green salads daily in NY than he would in a month in Paris. I, too, wonder about people going to a fine restaurant, with a skilled and inventive chef, and ordering an ordinary dish like a green salad. Why not also order a peanut butter and jelly sandwich?\\n \\nI also wonder about naming this place \\"Bistro.\\" It looks like a large and beautiful brasserie, not at all like a bistro (usually a small and modest Mom & Pop operation, such as Au Rendezvous), minus the main two food items which are always found in real brasseries, plateau de fruits de mer (large cold shellfish platters) and choucroute garni (a huge dish of assorted pork cuts and sausages with sauerkraut). I know that Bistro Niko shied away from offering shellfish platters because they are very expensive and it wanted to be moderately priced. A large one, for two people, will cost $100-150 in Paris, but you can get one nearly as good at Chops (or its Lobster Bar) for about 1/2 as much. Most Americans think of sauerkraut dishes as German and would not expect them in French restaurants. In fact, however, brasseries, which means beer halls in French, first came to Paris in the 1870s-1880s, after France lost Alsace (on the French-German border) in the Franco-Prussian War. A number of Alsatian restaurant owners fled to Paris and set up shop there, bringing beer and somewhat Germanic food with them.\\n\\nBistro Niko is more of a copy of Balthazaar in NYC than it is of anything in France. It is also sort of an American's idea of a \\"best of France\\" mix of dishes which are actually found not just in one type of establishment, such as a brasserie, but also in cafes, restaurants, bistros, and in 3 or 4 different regions in France. For example, it has a Croque Madame, a simple short-order cooking item usually found in modest cafes and never in places which serve serious food (just as hot dogs are not served in serious USA restaurants); boeuf bourgogne and coq au vin from Burgundy; raclette from the Alps; Tarte Flambee from Alsace, etc., as well as some dishes which are not really French, such as mussels (which are  uncommon in Paris, except at the two branches of Leon de Bruxelles, a Belgian chain), white bean soup (not a French dish, but apparently adopted because it was very popular at Brasserie Le Coze), etc. Snails are common in France, but I have never experienced them there made either with Pernod or puff pastry.\\n\\nDespite its very justified failure to be authentically French, Bistro Niko has some very good dishes (especially the terrines, pates, pork rilletes, the frisee salad, and the two Burgundy dishes mentioned above) and I like it."},{"name":"Banger's Sausage House & Beer Garden","address":"79 81 & 81.5 Rainey St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"We probably caught the last 15 minutes of live music, but great music, helpful bartenders...soooo many beers!??"},{"name":"Oga's Japanese Cuisine","address":"915 Worcester St","city":"Natick","stars":"4","text":"Completely mediocre food and a really, really weird crowd.

Not overly spiced and gloriously grilled, Delia and I both immediately ordered the Steak Tacos.\\n\\nServed with a small portion of Mexican rice and black beans (or refried if you prefer) and a small salad, he dished up 3 steak soft tacos and asked how we wanted them adorned.  Personally, I went for lettuce, queso and a little tomato and I was in heaven.  At a price of $7.95 for 3 - the same price even if you get grilled chicken or ground beef - I was quite content.  They even give out free chips and salsa with your purchase - the salsa is quite nice as well.\\n\\nFor a quickie lunch place within walking distance of work, and good tacos, I didn't mind shelling out $10 for tacos and a bottle of water.

I cannot say enough good things about the snacks.  Here's a list of my faves:\\n\\n--Crab wontons:  I am slightly a crab wonton snob because I make splendid ones at home.  The ones at Grass Skirt are probably the closest to homemade as you can get:  full of real crab and a good ratio between the crab and cream cheese.  \\n--Sweet potato wedges:  Thick cut but crispy too!\\n--Coconut chicken bites:  Move over, coconut shrimp!  These chicken bites are moist, slightly sweet, and have a nice crunchy coconut cover.\\n--Spam sliders:  If you secretly love spam, but are afraid to admit it to your friends for the fear of being ridiculed, order them at Grass Skirt.  Regular old fried spam is elevated with Swiss, a dab of spicy Chinese mustard, and Kings Hawaiian rolls.  Yum!  \\n--Any of the salads with crispy tofu added.\\n\\nAs noted in several of my reviews for Liz Lessner restaurants, do not go to Grass Skirt for exemplary service.

I know that everyone says that... but seriously, I never win anything. So I was MORE than pumped when I won a $100 gift certificate to the Back Bay restaurant group at a holiday party this past Christmas. I decided to save this prized treasure until a beautiful weekend when I could stroll through the common, and enjoy the entire day in the city without freezing off any important digits and could wear cute shoes :-) Last weekend was such a weekend. Beautiful. Sunny, warm, nothing else that had to be done. So my boyfriend and I decided to go into the City, eat lunch on the common, catch a movie, window shop and end up at one of the restaurants to use my gift card. Our first choice was Abe and Louie's - but, alas, we called too late and couldn't get a reservation before 9:45pm. Second choice - Bouchee. Bad choice. \\n\\nWe got to the restaurant a little earlier than our reservation and we asked to sit outside, but there was an hour and a half wait and reservations were only good for inside. OK - not a problem. We went inside and got seated right away. A cute little round booth with a great view of the restaurant. However, there is an opening in the middle of the floor that looks down over the bar. The Red Sox were playing the Yankees... sooo needless to say, it was really loud. Our waiter came over and took our drink order - I got an espresso martini which, when given to me, had ice cubes in it. Umm, I'm not bartender, but I'm pretty sure you aren't supposed to have ice cubes IN your martini. Well, I'm not one to complain at the drop of a hat, so I scoop them out and continue on my merry way of perusing the menu. Filet Mingon. Yes please. The waiter comes to take our order, and because I am picky about my steak, I say very cleary - medium rare. I know I said it, because I was there when I said it and I know what I said. My steak was not medium rare, it was well done. My boyfriend (being the lovely gentleman that he is) flags our waiter down and returns the steak and reiterates the medium rare. \\n\\nThe general manager came over in the mean time to apologize and ask if I would like anything else. I thought that was a very nice gesture and decided to lighten up a little and start with a clean plate (heeheehee). The general manager brought my new steak out and waited for me to cut into it - perfect. I said thank you and happily ate my steak. The whole time,  my boyfriend and I were talking about ordering more drinks and what we were going to order for dessert. Well... what we would have ordered if we had ever seen our waiter again. We had to go flag down the general manager in order to have our table cleared and the check brought out. We ended up having both of our meals comped and only paid for the two drinks and a salad we ordered... but it did not make up for them spoiling the joy surrounding my winnings. I did NOT use my gift card, but instead shelled out the money from my own pocket and decided that next time, we would call Abe and Louie's earlier."},{"name":"Vendetta","address":"4306 N Williams St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"I am a bit surprised by all the 2-star reviews, but I've always liked this place for three reasons: 1) Good vibe ; 2) Shuffleboard; 3) Non-smoking.

In the end, I decided that if I had to pay full price for a meal here (10 dollars +), I would be pretty pissed off.\\n\\nSo lets start off with what we got. We got a Mexicana burger(jalapenos, nacho cheese, guacamole, onions [raw] and sour cream), a  Works burger (cheese, onions, bacon, guacamole, and a fried egg), a Salmon burger (salmon pattie, pickles, onions, and lime sauce), and chicken wings. \\n\\nLets start with some overall descriptions. The patties here are consistently cooked a level beyond what you order. My friends ordered medium and it definitely came out medium well. Also, the patties are very underseasoned here. In fact, with all the toppings, you cant even really taste the beef. Oh, and the bread here is as my friend described \\"shitty ass kroger bread\\". I don't know if it's really from kroger, but it definitely didn't measure up to the bread used at other $10+ burger joints. There is also definitely way too much bread compared to the meat. \\n\\nThe best burger was clearly the Works burger. And to be honest, that was due more to the fried egg and the bacon than anything else. The neat thing with this is that they fried the burger in a mold so that it came out patty shaped. Beyond that, the burger and fries were actually SIGNIFICANTLY smaller (and lower in quality) than an equivalently priced burger from say... The Vortex. \\n\\nThe Mexicana burger fared significantly worse. My friend asked for guacamole on the side. He never got it. The nacho cheese is definitely way to much for this burger.  The saltiness of it just overpowers the under seasoned meat. The cream cheese is totally unnecessary and unbalances the burger. And the non sauted vegetables kinda just distracted from the experience. \\n\\nThe salmon burger was probaly the worst burger.First of all, there was absolutely no char on the patty itself. Subsequently, the patty fell apart extremely easily because it was way to wet. The salmon patty itself was not flavorful at all. It kinda felt like it was eating mush. And yes, I can and have made significantly better salmon patties than this place. \\n\\nThe sides here range from unremarkable to spectacularly bad. The wings and fries are straight out of costco. I swear the fries are the same exact fries they serve at the costco food court. Same exact texture and taste. The wings are right out of a Tyson's frozen chicken wing bag. They didn't have any crispness to them (i guess you can't really fry Tyson's frozen bbq wings), were small, and definitely had that preservative taste to them Horrible.The tater tots were unremarkable. And the sweet potato fries were TOTALLY soaked in oil and were thinner than any fries I've ever had. And they're stingy with portion size. \\n\\nAll in all, even at 5 dollars a person, I felt ripped off. The service was slow and the food was average to bad. The business must be down since they have a 50 percent off your entire order coupon (which is what drops it to $5 a person) on their website. In the end, even with that I wouldn't come back here.

My wife and I were seated in a completely remote back corner, with literally no one else seated in our half of the restaurant. Our server then approached us and seemed annoyed before we ever said a word, she forgot one of the items we ordered, and she didn't proactively check on us even once. When we called her over to ask for more water, she said she would get some but never came back. We finally decided to just leave and requested the check. When I received the bill, I asked the waitress to remove the item we never received and she acted like I was somehow inconveniencing HER. She returned after an eternity with the corrected bill, set it on the table, and walked away without saying a word. \\n\\nShe never once smiled or acknowledged our presence without us requesting her the entire time.

But it was kinda disappointing cuz the seafood wasn't that cooked well, it was too over cooked. Scallops and shrimp were so so so melting and less tasty than they were supposed to be. Also, the linguini looks not handmade and as skinny as ramen (I am just telling the truth!)\\nHad the chocolate grotto, pretzel-ish dessert. It was amazing!!!!!

Naturally, we opted for pizza. My husband got the BBQ Chicken Pizza. Their BBQ sauce was probably the sweetest I have ever tasted, and more tomato based.

It was pretty empty, even with a subsequent noon rush of sorts.  I had steak (med rare) and 2 eggs (over easy) with black coffee, sibling had veg omelette.  Home fries were crispy and flavorful.   I will say that this standard breakfast food pretty much knocked the socks off of that served by Bread and Ink-- and the bill was $10 cheaper.

Our waiter was prompt and attentive.\\n\\nMy food was OK, but like I said, nothing to write home about. The steak tips were huge. I got three of them, but they all were about double or triple the size of a regular steak tip. The fries were wedge fries, and it also came with a small sampling of a mixed green salad. The steak was cooked the way I ordered (medium rare), but they were a little chewy and lacked flavor/seasoning.

I had asked if perhaps I could have some chocolate shavings on top of it and they said that they could give me chocolate chips on top of it or Coco baking powder but they couldn't give me chocolate shavings. My boyfriend and I found that odd. And to prove their point they brought out unsweetened cocoa powder and chocolate chips. So while waiting for the coconut pie, my boyfriend took a nice and proceeded to chop up chocolate chips into chocolate shavings so when they brought the coconut cream pie, he then proceeded to dust the chocolate shavings all over it. The coconut cream pie was good but when you added the chocolate shavings it was one of the best desserts I've had in a very long time.

I wish Yelp! allowed half stars...Cakes & Ale is closer to a 3.5 than a 3. \\n\\nHere is what I discovered: The location is fantastic...across from Cafe Lily on Ponce; the space is small, which I like, but very noisy. The host assured us that sound dampening material was to be installed soon. Reservations are strongly suggested...even on a week day! \\n\\nI love the menu, somewhat limited but everything on it sounded great and it was supplemented by a host of daily specials. Fair warning: while the appetizers are priced faily, the entrees are rather pricey...more to the point...I expected larger portions for the money. Likewise with the wine...the shortest pour in Decatur so far. Dinner for two (two beers, a shared appetizer, two entrees, and two glasses of wine) was just shy of $100.00.\\n\\nThe food was quite good...I highly recommend the fried okra appetizer.  Let me say that again...order the orka!!! The beer list at first glance looks limited as well; but again, every selection is a winner! I enjoyed a Langunitas Pils with the okra.  The wine list is also very nice...I was served a glass of True Grit Petit Sirah to accompany my rare roast beef dinner...both were delicious...though the wine was such a short pour (3 to 3.5 oz., 4 oz. tops) I almost sent it back. The desserts looked wonderful...but again we had already spent a C note...\\n\\nThis would be a great stop for a light dinner before going to a play, etc. knowing that a trip to Cafe Intermezzo would follow some hours later. I would not recommend Cakes & Ale to anyone who is really hungry.\\n\\nSummary:\\n\\nThings I liked: The service was top notch! The space is fun. The menu was creative. The beer/wine list is stellar...all top shelf...no Bud, no Kendall Jackson!\\n\\nThings that need improvement: The noise! Very hard to have a dinner conversation. Entrees are too expensive for the portion size. Bartender needs to learn what a proper wine serving looks like. No salt or pepper on the tables...and the gnocchi definitely needed salt! (This is a pet peeve of mine...I find it rather pretentious for a chef to assume the food he serves is perfect...bad memories of Paul Luna come to mind...those who know that ass will understand)."},{"name":"Flying Saucer Draught Emporium","address":"815 W 47th St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Service was friendly and helpful, but we've had one too many bad experiences with the management here.

I was trying to find the Boston Commons and found myself too proud to ask one of the hundreds of Brahmin-accented officers roaming the streets.  I chose a direction and kept walking.\\n\\nEventually I ran into this Freshii.  I had gone to one in Houston before and remembered that they had a vegan wrap that had been affordable and had tasted delicious.  It was like encountering an oasis in the middle of the Sahara desert.  I walked inside and was immediately greeted by two happy, smiling employees.  I asked for a vegan wrap, which they promptly made.  They were enthusiastic about their jobs and they put me in a good mood.  Smiles all over the damn place.  I asked the clerk for directions and posed random questions on how dollar coins in America work (or don't work).  She was happy to answer my questions.  The other employee took out his iPhone and offered to help me find my way to the Boston Commons.  After I paid for my vegan wrap, he brought me outside and walked me down the street.  He made sure I knew EXACTLY where I was going.  I couldn't believe how nice he was.  It showed that they sincerely cared about their customers.  He wished me a good time in Boston and I thanked him again.\\n\\nOn my way to the Boston Commons I ate my vegan wrap.  It was just like the one I had had at the Freshii in Houston - delicious and refreshing.  I had some bounce in my step again.

The thai iced tea is also good and perfectly sweetened.\\n\\nBanh Mi for only $3.50. They have lots of choices but I like their special Tan Tan banh mi. All their banh mi served with liver pate, homemade mayonnaise, pickled vegetables, cucumber, cilantro, onions and jalapeno peppers; seasoned with soy sauce and salt & pepper.

It is a good spice level for me and the noodles are al dente. Vermicelli noodle bowls are super flavorful as well if you don't feel like soup.

We were craving sushi one night and decided to try Bara Sushi House for the first time. I had heard some positive things about it, nothing that blew my mind but good things, so we decided to give it a shot. \\n\\nI am sad to say that I probably will not be going back to this particular sushi restaurant. So here's the deal, the food itself, the sushi, is DELICIOUS!!!!! Some very good quality sushi. I enjoyed it very much. If I could come back and just sit down to a plate of my favorite sushi just waiting for me, I may consider coming back. But it was the service that fell terribly short for me that night. And if I'm being completely honest, I'm really not a picky person when it comes to service, I'll let most things slide, but this experience was particularly bad. The list of screw ups just kept adding up. The young waiter brought us a pitcher of water and cups that were filthy, I honestly did not want to drink out of them. I ordered some hot tea and the waiter told me it would be a while cause he had to brew it. My boyfriend ordered sake that the waiter ended up forgetting and had to ask again what kind of sake he got. Shortly after we were seated a group of young looking kids came in and I don't know if the waiter knew these people or something but he was way more attentive to them and it seemed like he almost forgot about us entirely. He ended up never bringing me my hot tea but added it onto the check at the end anyways. I had to point it out to him and request it be taken off. I also asked him to bring us some napkins during the meal cause there were none on the table but he completely ignored my request. So we went the entire meal without any napkins. I don't know, maybe I was being to picky but I went to this place expecting a nice experience. The food was the only saving grace. I will say again, the food was AMAZING!!! One of the BEST spicy tuna rolls I've ever had, and the salmon hand roll?!?!?!?!?! WOW! DELISH! Service is definitely lacking. Go at your own discretion. As for me, I'll probably be hitting up Toney Bento, Mio Sushi and Sinju Sushi!!!

It was ok, so I prefer much less peppery taste and more sesame oil aroma. My husband ordered nigiri plate, which was accompanied by miso soup and lattice salad.

Yesterday my partner & I went cuz it's hard to deny that Chipotle's burritos are tasty, quick and a pretty good amount of burrito for the price. We went in, it was understaffed but we thought it was okay since there wasn't a line. We went through and ordered; 12 hours later (the usual time it takes for food poisoning), Alex is throwing up -- continuing to throw up all night. The things he had differently from me were the sofritas, brown rice, black beans and green salsa. I was fine so it was definitely one of those four things. Chipotle seems to have a cross contamination problem in general because they have to work so fast (which I always tip and say thank you because it looks like shitty work, honestly), often I have to make sure they wipe things by telling them I'm alergic to dairy (I'm extremely lactose intolerent but no restaurant takes that term seriously). This absolutely was THE cause of his food poisoning. Otherwise he ate exactly the same as me and his dad and we've been fine. Doubtful he'll want to go there or to any Chipotle again; since he already will inconsistently get stomach aches from there anyway. It's a huge bummer since it's basically the best fast food for vegans....

Both halves had the exact same ingredients, and they were assembled as one unit prior to being cut in half.  I made it clear to the manager that I ordered only one sandwich - the $5 footlong, and my total should not be the $10 that he wanted to make me pay.  We had a heated argument about this, and he begrudgingly said he would just charge me $5.  I noticed that he added a $0.35 surcharge, which he said was a \\"charge for spinach, which he normally charged extra for.\\"  This was a blatant lie, because all other Subway franchises do not charge extra for any of the vegetable toppings, including spinach.  I told him he was lying, but I paid the $0.35 surcharge because I was tired of arguing with such an unreasonable, greedy manager.  I also did not appreciate his condescending tone of voice.

The live singers brought my sister on stage and sang to her, and the music throughout the night was a great selection for a night cruise.. your fair mix of young and older dance music. The food is great and in buffet style, which definitely is a plus.\\n\\nTHE BAD: The first night we went, June 1, 2007, there was a high school prom on the boat that was NOT announced to us when we purchased our tickets. So, needless to say, we were very upset when the middle and top decks of the boat were closed off to non-prom attendees.. We tried going to the second floor to take a look out onto the city and were shooed away by over-zealous security guards acting like cops.\\n\\nTHE BETTER: The Spirit of Boston has some awesome customer service. We wrote a letter to the boat expressing our concerns over the ship's unannounced 'prom night' and received a written apology with six free tickets to another Spirit cruise at a later date. DANG! So, we didn't waste any time and went on our second free courtesy cruise. We got to the boat and right away were approached and escorted to our table-- a 9-seater (for only 6 people might I add) right at the front of the boat in the middle deck overlooking the water and in front of a width-wide bay window. It was awesome, such a perfect view of the city all night long.\\n\\nThe ship took care of us the rest of the night and the staff made sure our second trip was more enjoyable than our first (which was still a blast, minus not being able to go to the other decks).\\n\\nThis ship, again, is a lot of fun.

My residence is merely 3 miles from this restaurant and a neighbor of mine recommended that I eat here. With great anticipation I arrived with a friend on Saturday evening. To start, I ordered a Caesar salad which had tiny pieces of yellow lettuce with store bought boxed croutons on top. The salad tasted anything but fresh and the dressing had no flavor.  For my meal, I had the lasagna which was covered in sauce but the lasagna itself was nothing but a hard block of tasteless and dry layers of pasta. There was no cheese, meat or sauce in between the pasta. I can unequivocally say that this was the absolute worst lasagna that I have ever experienced. This is coming from someone who has visited Italy numerous times and has eaten too many times to count in the Boston's North End, known for some of the finest Italian in this country. The owner came by and said he has good food because he is from Italy. Since when being from a particular country does it automatically make that cuisine good? Wow! What a major disappointment! I left in total disbelief how a place with food this horrible could even remain in business. Gordon Ramsey would come into this place and have a field! If you want truly authentic, superior quality food with a nice classy atmosphere in the area, my suggestion is to try out Crispina. We tried it for the first time a couple of weeks ago and both the food and service were absolutely superb!

Ours consisted of a chicken leg quarter, some brisket (hubs fave), a few ribs, some pulled pork, and two sides and usually cornbread.  I say usually cause on this night they ran out and graciously substituted texas toast and one extra side.\\n\\nThis visit we tried their fried catfish sandwich to see what it was like.  We both liked it and that speaks volume as hubs is a haddock (read fish and chips) fan where I grew up eating catfish.  I hope they keep it on the menu past the Lenten season.  If not.....it's still all good!\\n\\nOnly thing that doesn't work really for me are their sauces.  None of them really tickle my taste buds.

This was despite there only being at most 8 other patrons in the restaurant at the time. The official excuse given was that the keg had just changed, but even so, 25 minutes for a single pitcher is absurd.  On top of that, while we were waiting for our beer, the waitress felt no need to return to do something constructive, like take our food order.  By the time the pitcher finally came and we ordered our food, we had already been there for 30 minutes.  After waiting another absurdly long time for our food, we were told that they had run out of the sandwich that one of us had ordered.

This was my first introduction to Austin, and I still visit whenever I can, which isn't as often as I'd like. For drinks, don't expect to come in order a Bud Light. That is considered heresy here and they are free to flog you for requesting it (maybe not, but they should). The handcrafted brews are simply amazing, and a nice finisher to a long hot day (o a short, cold one...do you really need a reason to drink this stuff? It's great!) I prefer the Black, but for those who like their beers a little less awesome, the lighter brews are all very good and there's a sampler if you're not sure what to try. The bar staff is always friendly and will help you choose to, so don't hesitate to ask for suggestions.\\n\\nFor food, I'll make it simple: Angus burger, huntsman cheese, small field greens salad. Of the different meals I've tried, I keep coming back to this. Easily the best burger I've had in Austin, if not in general. The garlic fries are a delicious touch, and the burger is always cooked perfectly. Team it up with a handcrafted Black beer (or two...or three...etc.) and you'll be hard-pressed to beat this for a satisfying and simple dinner.\\n\\nMy only complaint would be that this place desperately needs more parking. The lots are always full come happy hour, and it makes things a bit difficult. They're a bit pricey on food, but I don't usually go beyond what I stated above, which is reasonably priced ($15 after tax with the salad, maybe a bit less?) If I still lived in North Austin, I would visit much more often. As it is, any chance I get to come out is relished.

A good rule to have: Don't buy more than you can carry. \\n\\nThe store is well laid out. You can pick up fresh flowers or a seasonal gift.\\n\\nThe produce section is small, but well stocked. The prices are reasonable. If I could get anyone else in my family to actually EAT a vegetable, I might be able to say more, but the basics are always good quality. There are some nuts and dried fruits here that are very good, probably worth the extra buck picking them up here if it's something you want.\\n\\nThere's a big selection of wine, beer and booze.\\n\\nThere's a cheese case with some little packages of meats and olives, some very interesting cheese here that you might be tempted to pick up, stuff you just won't find anywhere else - but it's a pricey spot so go easy. The salad bar is very good. It's also expensive, + 10 bucks, too much for me to pay for a salad.\\n\\nThere's a few aisles of canned goods, spices, cookies, coffee, tea, chips, soda, but, again, it's not the time to stock up on cans of tomatoes. Shopping at the Hills requires you've got most of your basic ingredients already in the kitchen.\\n\\nThe deli has a very good selection of cold cuts, Boars Head mostly. The guys back there can make you up a sub for 6 or 7 bucks, or you can get the 5 dollar grab and go sub. The deli guys put a lot of care into every sub they make. They also make a decent pizza for about 10 bucks, and there really isn't anywhere else in the area to get a pizza, so definitely give that a try. You can call ahead, or I bet you could order it right when you walk in and have it be done after you do all your shopping.\\n\\nJust past the cold cut deli is a huge display of prepared dishes. You can probably get the deli guys to give you a taste of anything they have back there, and I've enjoyed everything I've gotten, but the prices are prohibitive. The empanadas, the fried cod, the various salads, all good. There's an end aisle area with containers of dips and hummus, most I think are made right there. I like the BLT dip.\\n\\nNext are the desserts. We've gotten a lot of these and they change things out a lot and get them from a lot of different places. I've had a few disappoints out of the dessert case. If you're not sure on something, there's another case a few feet away that sell things at a discount.  There are some very cool artisan bread loaves that have always been worth picking up to me.\\n\\nNext up is the fish case. Now, this is where you need to consider rewarding all your hard shopping and price watching you've been doing up to this point. The fish is very good. They have stickers to tell you if its Sustainable or not. And they often have items you just don't see very often, seasonal, fresh, and worth it. They sometimes offer a punch card for multiple purchases, but the card will expire.\\n\\nThe next case, the meat case. Here's where you can do some serious damage to your wallet. Now, if you are searching for the most tender, melt in your mouth steak, that's as thick as your wrist, this is your spot. They have some homemade bacon at the end of the case and to be honest, it's spoiled me from buying other bacon. It cooks a lot faster so, be careful. I was there one time, and a lady next to me ordered 3 slices to use as a garish for a soup for a sick friend. The butcher didn't blink, just wrapped it right up for her.\\n\\nThere's a row of lesser priced meats that I check out every week, the first thing I look for are the manager specials. The chicken is always good and fresh. They have a brand that's called Free Bird that cost a bit more, but somehow it did taste a lot better. The hamburger and pork is good. They have lamb and veal sometimes. The other side of the aisle has some ice creams and deserts that are available in other places for less. At the end of the meat aisle is a spot for packaged bacon, hot dogs, some kielbasa from Stanley's Market in Toledo that is very good. There's several varieties of eggs. The aisle around the corner has milks, cheeses, and some frozen veggies and pizzas. They sell butter in a big pound block. It's very good.\\n\\nIf you broke the rule and bought too much to carry, they'll have someone help you out to the car. As other folks have mentioned they promote Ohio - made products, but it will add to your bill."},{"name":"G.

The first issue was in ordering - the employee taking orders and working the register could not speak nor understand English very well. It was difficult to order, ask any questions and he even poured the incorrect beer for my husband. We tried to explain to him that there were TWO Fat Tire beers on draft and he wanted the seasonal one, but the message never got through because of language barriers. We simply gave up out of frustration and just settled for whatever we got.\\n\\nShortly after we ordered, the place was over-run by a soccer team and it became very loud and noisy. Not the fault of the restaurant, but potential patrons may want to note that if you're looking for a quieter place, this may not be your best choice.\\n\\nThe crowning jewel to our dining experience was that the utensils delivered to our table with our pizza were dirty - both a fork and knife had crusty food on them from a previous diner. When I walked up to the counter/kitchen area to ask for more utensils, the employee I approached said \\"What's the problem?\\" and I indicated that the utensils were dirty and I would like new ones. Overall, I didn't like the attitude and lack of concern over the customer experience at this restaurant. I also found the food to be average at best. I've had much better pizza elsewhere in Atlanta. Even Mellow Mushroom is better than this place!

The chicken taco was my favorite. We did have to wait a long time for food and they had issues with their computers, but I totally understand there will be growing pains and that will not stop me from trying them again. \\n\\nHowever, being that this is a new restaurant, I feel obligated to give some critiques as well on how they might improve and be successful in that location. I am by no means an expert, but just some observations from a frequenter of beaches and beach-side restaurants. \\n\\nMy observations:\\n\\n-The place looks very nice and clean. Although the patio furniture is of great quality, however, they don't have the right type of tables to easily adapt to groups bigger than 4. We had a group of 6 and although there were 5 open high rise double tables when we got there, we had no choice but to wait 25 minutes in a half-empty restaurant until they had a table that would suit us. And even when they sat us, they sat us at a table set up for 4. The ends of the table are not open on the bottom of them, meaning the two of us sitting on each end of the table couldn't even put our legs under the table. It was a pretty uncomfortable set up that could easily be avoided with more adaptable furniture. \\n\\n-I understand they want to stay true to their core menu and do what they do best. I have no problem with that and think their tacos are great. However, when people go out to a nice patio on the water, they want to relax, hang out for a bit and enjoy some nice time outdoors. Adding some appetizers give another easy stream of revenue for the restaurant, leading to people to hang around longer, spend more $ on drinks, and ultimately, lead to a larger bill at the end of the meal. Adding simple starter items like nachos, calamari etc would go a long way in improving the overall diner experience without forcing the restaurant to stray from it's core theme.\\n\\n-I'm not sure if they menu offers enough for families with little kids or pickier eaters. Chicken fingers is a good start, but adding a burger and a few chicken or steak items that aren't tacos or sandwiches would go a long way. \\n\\nHK Too has a wonderful location and the outdoor patio is the perfect place to hang out when you need a break from the beach. However, I feel that if the restaurant tries sticking to it's guns too much, and doesn't adapt to fit what their audience demands (which isn't much honestly), they'll be in trouble. As I mentioned at the start, the food quality is great, which is usually the biggest hurdle restaurants need to overcome. All of their issues can easily be fixed. I think they'll have some very happy, life-long customers if they can implement some simple changes to the menu, and once they fix the bugs with the computers and service."},{"name":"Tikka House Vancouver","address":"1859 Commercial Drive","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Bought a Groupon for this place and its not a bad deal.

It's like a light falafel patty balanced with aioli and a well-toasted bun.  The french fries that came with were also excellent.

The guacamole was the freshest I've ever tasted, and the sour cream was light and fluffy. The jalapeno that I bit into was good but extremely spicy, hence the aforementioned tears. It really opened the floodgates when I took a bite of the chalupas afterward due to the hint of spices on the rice combined with the flaming hot flavor of the jalapeno. However, when you're ordering chalupas, you don't expect soggy tortillas you can eat with a fork. If they had been any more limp, they would have qualified as tortilla soup made by a five-year-old, The toppings (lettuce, tomatoes, cheese, and beef) were the only things that had real flavor to the chalupas.

We asked to sit outside (because it was very loud inside) and she told us there was a 20 minute wait to sit outside.  This was obviously to push us to an inside table where the waitress probably needed customers or so she could get someone off the shift outside (game time was in 45 minutes and people were all looking for their checks) but we went with it, sat inside and dealt.\\n\\nWaitress - She was very good.  Efficient, knowledgeable and always there when we wanted something.  We didn't see her for about 5 min (probably because the hostess didn't tell her she had a new table) but once she found us she was spot on.  She was very professional, fun and could not have done a better job.\\n\\nBeer Selection - Yes this is important!  I had the Goose Island and my friend had the Miller draft.  Both were a good temperature and tasted just fine.  There were several other beers on the menu and I would have liked to work my way through them but we didn't have time on this visit.\\n\\nFood - Frank had the Shepard's pie and I had the Monday Night Special (Battered Sausage).  Seriously?  Sausage isn't enough of a killer that they have to coat it in batter and fry it?  Of course it was awesome!  It came with the tastiest cup of beans I've ever had in a restaurant, the fries were perfect and the sausages were odd but decent.  The food came fast enough and we got out of there in about 50 minutes or so without rushing.  \\n\\nOverall - This was a solid performer right outside Gate B for Fenway.  It didn't get 5 stars because the Hostess was lame and it was really a little too loud with the music for 6:30 PM.  There were plenty of TV screens and the bathroom was big and clean.

After almost 200 years, the Quincy Market is now a food hall with a plethora of bars, restaurants, fast food, and fast casual eateries. It's remarkable knowing that Quincy Market is still Boston's Foodie Destination after almost 200 years. \\n\\nDuring my brief visit to Boston, I had the opportunity to visit Quincy Market twice. I like the place, because it's a sightseeing location and it has food. There are plenty of  dining options that fits just about anyone's appetite and budget. It has everything like seafood, lobster, clam chowder, Chinese food, Japanese food, Italian food, ice cream, pizza, falafel, basic New England comfort food, burgers, etc. \\n\\nThe ordering at each vendor is counter-style with the exception of a good handful of eateries that have a mini dining area next to the counter like the Boston Maine Seafood Company. Everyone pretty much places an order to-go at the counter and dines at one of the tables in the bi-level public dining area or they find a shady spot outside to sit down and eat. Along the exterior of Quincy Market are sit-down restaurants with large patio dining areas. I notice a reservation is not required, but it can be a wait to get a table. \\n\\nThe Quincy Market is the Foodie Destination for the tourist whereas the Boston Public Market a couple blocks away is the destination for the food-driven Bostonian Hipsters.  Considering that many walking tours either start or end at Faneuil Hall, I liked the convenient location of the Quincy Market for a quick bite to eat in-between my guided walking tours."},{"name":"The Soda Fountain","address":"2525 Edgewater Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"The Soda Fountain is a Great place to get a simple charming small town (feel) ice cream experience.

The staff is friendly and professional, and the atmosphere in the small dining room is charming and relaxing.  \\nI have consistently noticed a few problems, however. The first is that none of the dishes include enough vegetables. The curries and the pad thai, in particular, have maybe a quarter cup of vegetables at most. They just need more.  They also skimp on the shrimp in their shrimp dishes, and often over-cook them. Secondly, there is no \\"medium\\" heat level. Mild is very mild, but \\"medium\\" is spicy-- sometimes extremely so. If I order a dish mild, I inevitably wish it had some heat. If I order it medium, half the time it is too spicy to eat.

Bartender #2 says, \\"hey guys, we're about to head home.\\"  Really?  Still half a dozen people with full drinks at the bar and you're telling me you're about to leave?  Hmmm, my hipster cred is weaker than I thought.   We smile and say ok and proceed to finish our game. Obviously not a big deal since still several patrons finishing their drinks.  About 130 smugly chubster says \\"time to go home guys!\\"  Us: 'ok, we're just one point from finishing our game'. Smug chub:  \\"who's ahead?\\"  Me: \\"I am.\\"  Smugchub:  \\"ok you win now get out\\".  Me: \\" aw c'mon one last point\\". Smugchub:  \\"I'm takin the pucks!\\"  \\n\\nWe gave up and walked out. As I was leaving I gave the obligatory \\"thanks for the hospitality\\" to the which the bartender replied: \\"you're welcome. Fuck off!\\"  \\n\\nWow. What could have easily been more tips and repeat customers turned into a one star review and boycott of Vendetta. \\n\\nNice work bartender!\\n\\nGuess the two guys sitting at the bar still drinking when we left were VIPs. \\n\\nToo many other great watering holes in town to spend a cent here.

Canoe absolutely did NOT disappoint! The food was excellent and the service and environment were as well. The night went like this:\\n\\nArrival: \\nWe pulled up to the front of the restaurant for valet parking. I typically prefer to park my car myself (not sure if this was an option), but the lot seemed pretty small out front so prepare for valet parking or finding a parking spot that is not directly in front of the door. Upon entry into the restaurant (this was around 9 PM by the way) the atmosphere was classy with dimly lit lights indoors, and dim lights outside as well. We were greeted kindly, and once our reservation was confirmed, we were seated promptly (we were asked if we wanted indoor or outdoor seating, and opted for the indoor. The outdoor seating is next to a pond/small lake where pictures can be taken, but the water is not very visible at night).\\n\\nThe Meal:\\nBefore receiving your main course or appetizer, you are offered four different types of bread, and they are all delicious. For our appetizer, we opted to try the Kangaroo Loin (I could not believe it was actual Kangaroo!), and the House Smoked Salmon! Both were absolutely delicious! The texture was somewhere between beef and lamb for the Kangaroo Loin, and the taste was as well. For the main course, I opted for a Duck N' Beef Burger, and she opted for the Slow-Roasted Rabbit dish. The burger was delicious, although the bottom did collapse once it got too juicy, and so I finished it with a fork. It came with fries that were not bad, but may disappoint if you were expecting typical salty fries (like most establishments out there). The rabbit was great and tasted like chicken to me. We were stuffed by the end of the meal and so opted to skip dessert, but our server was so awesome, he provided a complimentary dessert to congratulate our anniversary Happy Anniversary was even written on the plate with dark chocolate)! \\n\\nThe Service:\\nOur server was extremely kind and attentive. Our water remained filled at all times (this is a big thing for me), we were updated on the status of our food whenever he passed by, and always asked if there was anything else we needed. When we were unsure of what to order, he did not mind offering suggestions, and these suggestions were not the cheapest or most expensive items on the menu (more likely genuine suggestions). The complimentary Chocolate Grotto dessert topped everything off.\\n\\nThe Price:\\nThe appetizers were priced in the teens, and most entrees were priced in the high teen's to mid-30's. \\n\\nOverall:\\nI very much enjoyed my trip to Canoe and recommend checking it out if you would like a nice dinner in a wonderful environment, with some exotic cuisine options!\\n\\nSuggestions for Canoe:\\nIt would be great if more lighting was included around the water so patrons could have a beautiful evening view.\\n\\nEdit: Included dish names and revised prices, added suggestion."},{"name":"The Original Dinerant","address":"300 SW 6th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Stopped in for lunch Tuesday, 2/18/2014.

Waited close to 20 minutes and it finally came out. Was never once checked on in that time or even had another staff member stop by to top off water, or heck, maybe sell me another drink. The sandwich was alright, had potential. But when it's ice cold and the brioche is hard it makes it hard to make a case for it. \\n\\nSo my takeaway is poor service and general lack of attention to the food or patrons.

Oh yes, I'm talking about a $10 steak, selected by the butcher, perfectly seasoned, and cooked to perfection! \\n\\nI went to Dai Due on a Tuesday with a group of ladies to check it out. We made reservations and our table was promptly ready at 7:30pm. The hostess brought us drink menus and we ordered wine while we waited for the table (some of us arrived a little early). I was disappointed that they were out of the house red wine on tap, but the white was pretty good. I also tried the Lewis Wines Tempranillo, which was exquisite! One of the best tempranillos I've ever had! \\n\\nAs I already mentioned, the steak was fantastic! That night, they were serving up sirloin. Incredibly lean and tender (and I'm super picky about fat on meat), well seasoned, perfectly cooked medium rare. A great deal for $10. The steak comes a la carte, so I ordered the rutabaga side, which was good but I'm not sure if it was worth the $6. I tried some of the kale au gratin...mmmm, cheesy goodness and kale? Yes please! I also tried a few bites of the side salad, which was tossed with a delicious mustard vinaigrette. I would skip the rutabaga and go for the salad or kale!\\n\\nI have to give props to our server, Evron! She provided incredible service, was super attentive, and was very knowledgeable about the wines and menu items!

Very flaky and delicious.  The curry sauce was reminiscent of jarred chicken gravy with curry powder mixed in. Spring rolls had a horseradish flavor which was very off putting. The five spice calamari was mediocre.  The seasoning had cinnamon which made me feel like I was eating churro calamari.  The bulgogi skewer was very tasty and well flavored.  Laksa was disappointing and had linguine noodles.  Dessert roti was yummy.  Like a Malaysian version of sopapillas.  Overall experience was good but nothing to rave about.  Stick to Tasty Wok in my opinion."},{"name":"Canoe","address":"4199 Paces Ferry Rd SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Canoe has it all:  A classy yet comfortable atmosphere, excellent food and service that's above and beyond.  \\n\\nThis is one of those restaurants that I've been wanting to visit forever but haven't gotten around to for some reason.  Well, no, actually...  I know the reason.  It's not every day that my husband and I can afford to drop $100 to $150 for dinner.  But we decided to save up our Date Night pennies and give it a go.  We were both very happy that we did.\\n\\nNow I know that most people seem to want to sit on the porch out back with a view of the river.  But we were happy to be seated inside, with a view of the open kitchen.  We got to watch the chef in action and smell the delicious aromas of the food she and her staff were creating back there.\\n\\nOur server Terry was also excellent.  He was friendly and happy to explain anything and everything.  He pointed out the chef and the executive sous chef to us, explained that the chef liked to use local ingredients when possible and that the soft shell crabs being served that night had been crawling around when they got there that morning.  He was happy to make recommendations, and they were all on point.\\n\\nFirst, we tried the Lemongrass Martini and snacked on three different types of delicious house-baked bread while we mulled over the appetizer selections.  My was the Kalamata olive bread, and there was also a very interesting chili-rubbed flatbread that had a surprising amount of kick to it.  The menu at Canoe is always changing, so a lot of the items mentioned here on Yelp were not listed last night.  Fortunately, our server was happy to make recommendations.\\n\\nI had the House Smoked Salmon with a Crispy Potato Cake and Vermont Goat's Cheese.  For some reason, even though I love lox AND goat cheese, this item didn't catch my eye until Terry pointed it out. The salmon was bursting with flavor without being fishy at all (which is quite a feat for smoked salmon).  The goat cheese was a perfect complement to it.  Even my husband, who cannot stand lox, thought that the appetizer was delicious.  Oh, and the portion was huge (although I believe it's possible to order a half-portion).\\n\\nMy husband had the Fried Green Tomato with Local Egg (and some sort of ham I can't remember) as his appetizer.  I had a bite of this, and the tomato was wonderfully crunchy and flavorful.  Yummy!\\n\\nWhen it came time to order our entrees, I was very tempted to order the Slow Roasted Carolina Rabbit with Swiss Chard, Bacon Ravioli, and Candied Garlic Sauce.  It's a house specialty and I really wanted to taste it after reading about it here on Yelp.  The only problem was that the only time I'd eaten rabbit before, I really wasn't a fan.\\n\\nFortunately, my husband also wanted to try the rabbit, so he ordered it as his entree.  The main issue I had when I tried rabbit before was that it seemed very tough.  This rabbit was not the least bit tough, though.  It was tender and accompanied by the most beautiful garlicky, buttery sauce.  Mmmmm.\\n\\nOne thing to note about this rabbit dish is that it takes about 20 minutes to prepare.  So you should definitely order a starter and be willing to take your time.  Our server was very on top of things and gave us fair warning about this.\\n\\nI ordered the Chili Glazed Duck Breast with Foie Gras Sausage.  I wasn't sure how I'd feel about the sausage - I've never tried foie gras before because I definitely do not like liver in any forms I've tasted so far.  However, either I do like foie gras or I just like foie gras that's made into delicious sausage.  And the duck was rich and tender.  Even though it was a reasonably small portion, I started to get full quickly.\\n\\nDespite our full tummies, we decided to order dessert because other reviewers had indicated that the dessert was not to be missed.  My husband ordered the Valrhona Chocolate and Salted Caramel Grotto dessert - a dome of dark chocolate filled with salted caramel and hazelnut creme.  As a Greek yogurt lover, I couldn't resist the Blueberry Semifredo with Greek Yogurt and Lavender.  \\n\\nMy husband's dessert was good, but mine was definitely the favorite of the two.  The Greek yogurt was creamy without being heavy, the blueberries were simultaneously sweet and tart, and the lavender broth was just... heaven.  Oh, and in case you are not in the know already (I wasn't), \\"semifredo\\" means it's half-frozen.  Freaking awesome.\\n\\nWe had a great time at Canoe.  All of the staff made us feel welcome and at ease, and every single thing we put in our mouths was delectable.  Would definitely go back and blow our paychecks there again."},{"name":"Banger's Sausage House & Beer Garden","address":"79 81 & 81.5 Rainey St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"You'll be shocked by the amount of beers on tap- so many to try!

I'll note that it was 7:30 pm (not near the end of service) and the server told us they started out with half the normal amount that they normal do...we were ready to walk out then (because their menu is already so limited before things run out.\\n\\nSo that left us with pork chops or fried chicken.  I don't go to restaurants for pork chops because no one has been able to blow me away with them...ever.

There were a couple (like 3) other things on the menu but they weren't up my alley.\\n\\nI ordered the pork chop and I am thinking to myself that this pork chop better blow me away or the dinner gets the thumbs down (the others in my party agreed).  Well, the pork chop didn't blow me away.  It was good, but it wasn't memorable.  Add to that the sides are a-la-carte and I paid $44 for a pork chop and some green beans.

Unfortunately, Nick's food is not as divine as the soups in Seinfeld's looney character's place. Don't get me wrong: it is not bad, but for Zeus' sake, this cannot be the best Greek food in town...someone tell me that there's got to be a better one. \\n\\nNow, we didn't get the gyro sandwich, so this review is update-able (will go again and try the gyro, well I'll have my sweetheart try it cause I'm not a gyro meat fan). I had the spanakopita and he had the souvlaki sandwich. The souvlaki sandwich is as if not more popular in Greece that gyro is but most \\"Greek\\" places in the states don't make it (IDK why since it is much easier to make). Anyway, instead of gyro meat they add skewered pork meat-all other sandwich elements remain the same.\\nThe meat was cut into huge pieces, and given that it was not very tender it was tough to eat. Most importantly, The thing was too huge to eat and wrapped very amateurishly, which made it extremely messy. I don't know why a Greek person would add lettuce (?) in souvlaki, but Nick does, and that is a big no-no. Also, when the sandwich is not wrapped the right way, all the yumminess that is the meat+tomatoes+tzatziki juices land right on to your jeans, and not inside your mouth as they should. In Greece they hire only experienced \\"wrappers\\" to do this job, that's how important it is. The spanakopita was actually very good, although not your typical spanakopita recipe (maybe she used a local recipe from rural Greece?) but it was fresh and tasty. \\n\\nSo, this place from what I understand serves home-made Greek food to go.

We went on the cruise on Friday September 7th 2012. We had SUCH A GREAT TIME!! Although the weather was rainy with thunderstorm threats, it didn't take away from the great atmosphere inside the boat. I found it disco-ish with strategically placed lights (along the stairs and sporadically throughout ceiling) and a nice dance floor. It had a gentle ambience- not too much light that made it insanely bright but a cool glow. Our table was on the lower deck near the dance floor. They have, of course, a bar, and the dinner is buffet style. \\n\\nI read lots of reviews before choosing this particular cruise, and they all weren't that good. There was always some representative apologizing afterwards and stating the changes they would make. However, compared to some of the other dinner cruises, this was a bit more bearable in terms of price and the least bad reviews. (If that makes sense. I still found it a bit overpriced though.) I really wanted to do a dinner cruise because I've never embarked on one before, and I was beyond ecstatic about a romantic cruise with my new husband. With that said, with all the changes the cruise commentator said would be made, my hopes were high as a stoner.\\n\\nEntertainment: What you read in regards to the entertainment is true: the cruise crew puts on the show!! I didn't believe this at first, but when they had mics in their hands and some vocals were coming out along with sub-par dance moves decorated with pomp-pomps, I knew I wasn't in Kansas anymore. The performances are not like Jabbawockeez or anything. They were enjoyeable nonetheless. I thought they were full of fun and energy. Some of them were really good singers, some weren't, and some were just..weird. \\n\\nService: Servers were great! Very respectful and make themselves available for your table. For drinks the first time we got up to go the bar to get them. The future rounds of drinks the server was able to get for us, an he just brought us the check end of the night.\\n\\nFood: Food was alright. I went in with an open mind, but like everyone else says don't do this cruise for the food. I did however find it tasted yummy except for the pasta. The pasta was disgusting. It tasted like a 5 year old made it. Flavorless and dry. The meats and fish was good. I am a mashed potato fiend and I LOVED the mashed potatoes. I had to stop myself from eating the whole pan! \\n\\nOverall, I gave it 3 stars because it was just too expensive to me, the food wasn't worth the costs, and the entertainment was okay. I loved the music though. I guess for me it's more like a 3.8 I'd give if possible."},{"name":"Umi","address":"3050 Peachtree Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Wow!  This place is amazing!

I wanted to sit on the patio at first (since that's what initially drew us in to eating there), but it was a hot Atlanta day and their patio doesn't have AC or fans, so we sat inside. \\n\\nFinally sit, and we take it all in.... y'all this place is really really pretty and nice! Very clean French restaurant with white table cloths....they sat us in one of the really nice big curved elevated comfy booths ( I guess we looked kinda important, lol). Most others were just sat at the table, hehehe...\\n\\nServer came over, told us about all the specials. He was polite and knowledgeable. I forgot the appetizer we got, it was good. My friend ordered one of the specials, and I got a salmon dish... I believe ESCALOPE DE SAUMON. While the place itself was lovely, the food was very pretty, but lacked flavor to me.  Each of the items on the plate was plain and unflavored on its own (this fish, the greens, the sauce), but even when eaten all together it still didn't give me fireworks. I watch alot of Top Chef and stuff so I know different countries have different styles of cooking, I guess traditional french cuisine has very simple flavors? And don't use seasonings or spices to add flavors to the food? And don't use alot of other ingredients to add flavor to the food? Idk point is the flood isn't that flavorful.\\n\\nEven with the food not being that good, this place was such an unexpected delight! Many people dress up going here, we just randomly stopped in so we just had on nice, but non-fancy clothes (I think I had on a sweater, pants, and loafers and I think he was in business casual since he had just gotten off of work), I sorta expected them to be snooty, but they were nice from beginning to end.

Super over-priced, which is fine I don't mind paying for fresh cheeses and meats but the spirits are way too over-priced.

However, this was the place the organizer of the group had chosen, and I really enjoy my nights out with the gang.\\n\\nTwo reasons why I considered bailing; the loud noise level that so many reviews seemed to point out, and the extra charge for pasta.  So, if all 12 people such as our group are going to order any non-pasta entr√©e...be it a $17 chicken parm (by itself, with no pasta), or veal saltimbocca (just two little veals for $25 with no pasta...*really*???  C'mon...at least throw a quarter portion of plain spaghetti or something at it like North End Italian restaurants do for cheaper!!!) and each person wants their own bowl of pasta to accompany an entr√©e, they get charged an extra $8 to $12 for each half a bowl of pasta (depending on what you get), the restaurant just made an extra $100 +/-.  On 12 bowls of *pasta*???  And that's just our group...never mind other dozens of patrons in the restaurant.  I get that you need to mark up the cheaper items to balance things out, but sorry, this just screams shady and greedy.

I had the mushroom manicotti...they were okay and the presentation was nice.  I had two pretty good size manicottis for $18.

I know how to respect my customers and handle a situation properly. Golden Buddha obviously does not and has no respect for its customers. We received a mailer from Lee's Golden Buddha #7, the usual ones with the menu and everything, and decided to try them out. We went to the website because it said on the mailer that first time orders over $25 would receive $5 off and our order was going to be about $28. However, the website provided by them, both online, on Yelp and on the mailer, did not appear to be completed and seemed more like an ad site; there was no way to order on the site. So I called and simply asked if they could honor the offer sense the website wasn't working. This is were I became upset. I suppose I would have understood if they didn't want to honor the offer because I wasn't technically ordering online. But the woman I talked to on the phone completely denied the existence of the mailer and that they ever send them out. She admitted that their website wasn't up yet but said they never sent out a mailer. Now this mailer has their address, phone number, whole menu, hours, etc... It was obviously produced and distributed by them or it is the best most unnecessary fake Chinese menu I've ever seen, probably even the only one I've ever seen. Not to mention I saw the Golden Buddha #7 van, trust me you can't miss it, and their employee putting these mailers/menus outside our apartment complex. And yet when I told the woman on the phone this she still denied it. If you don't want to honor your offer, fine, but don't lie about ever offering it. I wasn't upset about the $5, I was upset that they blatantly lied to me. I consider that to be disrespectful and awful customer service. If anything she should have at least offered an apology and said they couldn't honor the offer. Almost anything would have been better than her lying to me. In my opinion, when working in the food industry and dealing with customers, the worst thing you can do is lie to them. I don't care if this place becomes the best Chinese food in the area, I will never eat here and strongly recommend that others go elsewhere for their Chinese, there are plenty of other options that I am sure will at least show respect for their customers. If Golden Buddha #7 can't even offer adequate service over the phone and is willing to lie to their customers, I can't imagine they are any better in person.

The rolls were tasty and the peanut sauce was delicious. In fact, the waiter could have just handed me the sauce and a spoon and I probably would have been happy.  We then ordered the 7 Courses of Fish, we gave up red meat quite some time ago so we were grateful for the fish option.  This offering costs just $32.00 and while it's listed as being good for two people, we think there was enough to feed 3 or 4 and all 7 courses were DELICIOUS!  Two of the seven courses are cooked right at your table which was fun but a little scary at first as the flames got a little too high for my liking but eventually the heat was turned down and we were able to enjoy yummy course after course 7 times over! My favorites were the butter fish (served with 2 sticks of butter and cooked at your table) and the fish kabobs, however, we really enjoyed everything. My only regret is that I didn't have a Vietnamese Iced Coffee or Bubble Tea, but for now I'll console myself with definite plans to return!"},{"name":"Stella Public House","address":"1905 Aldrich St, Ste 110","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"This is not the place for a vegetarian and certainly not for a vegan!

Let's cut to the chase:\\n\\nCedar Plank Salmon.  This is the first thing I've tried here.  The fish wasn't dry and seasoned very well.  It could definitely be less dry for my taste, but the flavors were all there.  The spinach and potatoes were a great combination as well.  The dish in its entirety is simple and straightforward, but constructed perfectly.\\n\\nRoasted Lamb (Friday special).  Wow.  There's so many things going on on this plate and my mouth loves every bit of it.  The lamb is cooked perfectly to a medium rare and the sauce doesn't overpower it.  The texture of the polenta makes me want to just mix everything together onto my fork.  I'm a huge carnivore, but the vegetables are delicious, and I finished every single bite.\\n\\nGrilled Duck Breast.  This is the first time I've had duck breast that wasn't cooked asian-style.  It's super easy to make duck meat dry and tough, but none of that is found here.  The meat was soft, tender, and juicy with a lot of red and pink throughout  And again, the sauce compliments the duck very well without taking full control.  Once more, the polenta and the vegetables are a hit.\\n\\nLobster Risotto.  A fantastic, super-fancy risotto that can be happily shared between two people.  The seafood stock that the rice was cooked in was so flavorful and the lobster was perfectly cooked.  There were several pieces of lobster too, so quantity was not an issue.\\n\\nBeef Tenderloin.  Probably my favorite dish here at NXNW.  Cooked at a perfect medium rare, the meat is super delicious and so tender from the first bite all the way to the last.  The mushroom risotto also attracted me to this dish.  I love mushrooms, and when they say mushroom risotto, you can really get that strong flavor of mushrooms on every bite.  I tend to avoid bleu cheese, but the texture was in the right place here.  The crunchy and savory haystack onions were pretty much extra credit at this point.  I was initially concerned about the size of the tenderloin, but the beef was bigger than I imagine it to be and was definitely enough to fill me up.  Just....delicious, wow.\\n\\nThe staff was really nice every time.  They're highly professional yet friendly so I feel really comfortable eating here.  My favorite part of this place is their variety in their menu.

Very good food.\\n\\nI've been pretty excited about a burger place opening across the street from me, because I'm apparently still 12 years old and LOVE burgers and pizza. I finally had some time to walk over today and was not at all disappointed.\\n\\nThe decor of the place is really nice. As mentioned, it's in the old Thai Palate place, so it's a little small on the inside. Kind of loungy and modern, but really relaxed feeling, too. They have a full bar for about 12 also, which is where I sat. The bartender and manager (owner?) were both extremely nice. I sat and looked at the menu for a few minutes and talked to the bartender while I was trying to decide. Everything looked so good, it was a tough decision!\\n\\nFinally, I decided on getting the Cheddar Burger. All angus with cheddar, saut√©ed onions, sliced mushrooms, and bacon. I also go the green fries on the side and a Rogue Chocolate Stout.\\n\\nThe beer was super good, served in a nice, cold pint glass and well poured. It's one of the few Rogue beers I haven't tried, and was glad I did.\\n\\nWhile waiting, I continued to chat with the bartender and watch highlights from all the weekend's football. When my food came, I was really excited. The burger came on a white bun that had been toasted a little bit, and was about the perfect size. Medium round, but still very thick. The green fries were piled high on the plate with a small little coleslaw garnish. I threw the top bun on and dug in... what a surprise. I had ordered my burger medium rare, and it was perfect. Juicy and full of flavor. And it wasn't just the onions and cheddar and bacon and shrooms that had flavor, the beef itself was full of it. I took a couple of bites, and had to put it down to try the green fries. Again, also amazing. They were whole green beans battered and fried, and, unlike a lot of other places, they were very crisp and juicy. I've had too many green fries that were soggy and limp and no good. These, however, were f**king amazing.\\n\\nI took my time, and eventually finished everything on my plate. I was perfectly full and perfectly happy with everything. I will definitely have to go back and try some of the other burgers, as their menu has things like like lamb, Kobe, turkey, and salmon as well.\\n\\nOh, did I mention the price?! The regular burgers range from $6 for the classic to $9 for ones with a few extra ingredients. Most of them are $7, though. Also, the most expensive thing on the menu is only $11, and that's the Kobe! I can't wait to try it all. They also have a pretty decent beer selection, and a full bar. I definitely have a new neighborhood place to eat and drink!\\n\\nUpdate 11/03/09: I have been back 3 times since my initial visit. The wings are amazing! As are the onion rings. I have yet to have any of the bad experiences other people seem to be having with slow service and poor quality food.

Placed my order  #62 pork and egg roll vermicelli bowl & bbq pork steamed bao. Came quick.  Went home and my son said the bao bottom was soggy and the middle was cold. ... effin gross and in to the garbage it went as did the  $ I spent . It wasn't expensive but I could have made a better one out of the freezer pack lol. Any who, my vermicelli bowl was ah-ight lol. Included pick of the grilled pork. It was all fat or dry hard pieces or just icky looking. The noodles, egg rolls, salad and  fish sauce were on point though.  Just added a few squirts of sriracha on everything (except the meat that got pushed aside)"},{"name":"The Hawthorne","address":"500A Commonwealth Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Wonderful bar if you are in the mood for a classy intimate setting with excellent cocktails.

But thats where the good part ends.\\n\\nSo we are seated in a booth and waited for 5 or 10 minutes to see a server which is pretty standard for this place on nights after Timbers games. Thats when Breelyn comes by.  No greeting... No Hi How are you, No hows your night, Instead she leads with What do you want? The problem was nobody was given menus... so sorry i have no clue what i want.  I asked her about the whiskey selection which she literally knew nothing about... So i just got a jameson on the rocks. Thrown off by her terrible first impression we decided to not have dinner here tonight, kinda hard to order when we never got menus... and even after she realized we didn't have menus she never offered to bring them.\\n\\nBut wait it gets better. She brings us the bill without even asking if we want something else... My father was in town from Wyoming and we would have loved a second round and stayed to listen to the band a while but apparently that wasn't in the cards for us on this occasion. Of coarse we will return to kells and enjoy drinks and sausage rolls again, I just felt it was necessary to warn people about breelyn.

They were there maybe 5 minutes out of the entire 1.5 hours we were there.  \\nThe buffet was consistently out of multiple items, and the items they did have, weren't that great.  The pasta, for example, was out when we got there, and when it finally was restocked 20 minutes later, it was way overcooked and totally mushy (please note that this is supposedly an Italian restaurant). The staff was unattentive if something did not specifically pertain to THEIR own tables.

I'll be the first to admit that its a great deal, but by the end of the night I would recommend not coming to this restaurant.\\n\\nLet me start by saying the restaurant overall is a very nice place.  It has cozy feel, and the staff was very friendly, but at the end of the day those two only take you so far.  \\n\\nI'm primarily a beer drinker, and usually stick to the normal Bud or Miller.  That's not to say I won't venture off the path and drink different beers.  Zoot offers 4 beers all local, and none of the mainstream beers.  I have no problem supporting smaller breweries, but at least carry one of the big beer companies.  Heck charge a premium, and make more profit off them.  I did glance over the wine list, and didn't recognize any of the vineyards.  The list was a little short too, but I'll say  my wife and mother did enjoy the bottle they ordered.  \\n\\nWe all did the Chef's tasting menu.  They brought out the bread for the table first, and I'll say it was great.  Nice and warm with great flavor.  They brought out a sample of the soup that was on the farmer's menu for us to try.  It was ok.  When I eat soup I like it to be warm/hot, and this was served cool.  The feelings about it were the same at the table.\\n\\nThe 1st tasting was muscles.  The size and quality were excellent, but the flavor was blah.  Our next tasting was a salad.  It was a mixed green, but we were all disappointed with the greens in the salad.  We felt like we were eating a plant in our backyard rather than a tasty salad, and we all prefer a quality green salad (no iceberg here).  \\n\\n3rd course was a piece of halibut.  The fish was good, but halibut is an easy fish to cook.  They served it with some disappointing vegetables.  We all thought this was the best dish of the night.  Next was a piece of NY Strip.  It came out looking great!  I'm a big steak eater, and was excited to try it.  Just to set the steak up, they cut it in half for presentation, and it had a nice red center.  I eat them medium rare so I was glad how they had cooked it.  I went to cut into the steak, and it was so hard that I struggled cutting the piece of meat.  How disappointing, and the table all had the same problem.  This is probably the worst steak I've ever had out at a restaurant.  Especially one of this caliber.  It was served with a german potato dish, and if you like your mouth overwhelmed with mustard you would of enjoyed this as well. \\n\\nLastly was a piece of chocolate cake, and the consensus at the table was \\"meh\\".  We've had other tasting menus, and normally the bring the food promptly course after course.  It took us over 2hrs to finish, and we were all wondering what was taking so long. \\n\\nIf it was just me who felt like this about the restaurant I tell others to give it a shot, but the three of us left saying we would never come back.

I then anxiously awaited the complimentary baked goods that I have heard so much about and salivated over in all the pictures on Yelp...well, they don't do this anymore, so if that is the reason you are going for brunch vs breakfast on any other day of the week (my case) then you will be very dissapointed. The coffee was pretty good but beware, it costs $5.25!! $2.75 for your first cup and like any other restaurant they come and refill it but don't warn you the refill costs another $2.75 and from there on out the refills are free...The server we had was pleasent though maybe a bit flustered, perhaps she was new?\\n\\nNow for the food...What? I don't think we have had a more uninspired, unseasoned and boring meal like this in a long time... The avocado toast was basically brown guacamole on a week old piece of toast, it was 100% un-cuttable and almost unchewable, I even had to ask for a steak knife which still did not do the trick. If it was not a week old I will be very surprised but it was perhaps toasted hours prior to serving, it was the most stale piece of bread I have ever had. Avocados browning is normal, but all chefs know that a bit of lemon juice will keep this from happening and you will serve nice green avocado to your customers. I was absolutely not a fan of there being guacamole on my toast. It was weird and unnatural and I was looking around for a bowl of tortilla chips. Don't jump on the avocado toast trend if you aren't going to do it right or turn it into something better. The tacos had no sauce or seasoning whatsoever and the steak was tough as a board. It was as plain as you could get, not sure why you would even have this on the menu. The breakfast potatoes that came with it were completely brown, matte, cold, stale, bottom of the batch horrible and unseasoned. The table next to ours got potatoes that looked totally diferent, glistening, steaming and appetizing. I could not have regretted more having asked for that extra side of potatoes when we didnt even eat the ones on the taco plate..\\n\\nFinally, I decided I would wash down that subpar meal with some baked goods. I ordered a blueberry muffin and a scone, also to make up for our lack of complimentary bakes. The scone was bone dry, absolutely terrible. It was also completely flat with no rise in it, not sure what was up with that. The blueberry muffin was decent but nothing to write home about. We left both of them unfinished (trust me, I NEVER leave sugar on the table).\\n\\nOne last observation..for a place this \\"fancy\\" (im guessing they believe they are fancy given their prices), why on earth would they serve their ketchup in to-go cups? I all of a sudden felt like I was at McDonalds or a dingy BBQ joint. Why not a glass ramekin or jar? I understand not wanting ketchup bottles around as they are unsightly, but plastic cups??\\n\\nAll in all, I just don't understand how this place is as popular as it is and am shocked that people keep coming back? Maybe they have never had anything better, or maybe just because they live in Midtown (yeah I went there). Not sure if this was all just a huge fluke but for these prices and popularity, consistency should be number 1. Oh and please put a hanger or hook in the women's bathroom...not so nice to have to put a purse on a dirty bathroom floor. I know this review is harsh, but with so so many great restaurants in ATL, means you have to step up your game. Or maybe not, maybe it's ok to be mediocre when you have this much of a loyal following. I would never recommend it to anybody."},{"name":"Aviator Pizza & Drafthouse","address":"6501 S Congress Ave, Ste 1-105","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Love the Aviator for its location to us and that its locally owned.

We have never had German food before so we choose the Pork Roast and the Beef dinners with the German potato salad on the side. OMG the food was amazing and Chris was really personable and was genuinely engaged in our conversation. We told Chris we were from the Bay Area and he told the manager this. The manager came to our table and asked if we had a good dinner and told us he too was from the bay area. What a nice guy! The service really made the food even better.

I believe this bar is owned by the same people who own Surly Girl, Dirty Frank's, TipTop, and Betty's. They really should branch out and do restaurant consulting. \\nThey haven't gotten the full food menu yet, but they do have a good drink menu. Most of the drinks (maybe all) are made with rum. The Navy Grog, Caramelized Pineapple Coffee Grog, and the Dark and Stormy are all good. I drank them all in about an hour. So, I'm not sure how strong they are, but I definitely was not acting like a drunken fool. I guess these drinks are made for civilized people. Plus, for $3 extra, you can get a tiki mug. I love tiki mugs. \\nThe sweet potato wedge fries were delicious - though I don't know if these will be on the menu next month. I hope so. \\nIt was packed.

We sat inside, as it was a December evening a few years ago, and dark outside.  I was impressed by the wine selection (my Atlanta friend is an expert), this was his choice for a not-cheap-but-not-over-the-top dinner with a great wine selection with good service and quality associated with the wine and the food as well.  This was a few years ago, so I am not confident in my memory of what I ate, but I believe it was trout.  I do remember being quite happy with it.\\n\\nThe second time I dined here was last weekend at the same friend's wedding.  This time, we dined outside after an open air ceremony in the early evening next to the river.  The setting was picturesque, and the event very well organized.  It was a warm June day (in Georgia), and the ceremony was hot, but the staff seemed to both keep things moving through good organization and provide ice water.  The reception was in a tent cooled with fans, and was quite comfortable.  Service was exceedingly friendly and never stiff.

The downside is while the intimate space is great for the music and seeing the musicians the seating is horrible. The tables especially those close to the stage are jammed together so tightly that it's almost impossible to turn your chair to look at the stage directly. So you end up craning your neck in order to see the performers. Also it is difficult for the servers to get to the tables close to the stage.
