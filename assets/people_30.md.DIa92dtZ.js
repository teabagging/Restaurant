So good. \\n\\nThe whole time I was eating, I kept saying this was a solid 5 star experience - and it would've remained that way had I not used the restroom there.

We ordered fried shrimp, fried fish, coconut shrimp, fish tacos, and hush puppies. I didn't think the shrimp (fried shrimp) was cooked enough. I questioned whether it was completely done. The breading on the outside (flour not meal) was too soft also so it wasn't crispy, Also, the seasoning was just meh. The coconut shrimp was done and the texture was perfect. Nice and crispy but also just okay as far as flavor goes. My daughter (only 8) had the fried fish tacos. She liked them but said they were a bit spicy. I love spicy so I probably would have enjoyed that. I didn't taste them though so I have no comment at all from an adult perspective. She liked them though. The hush puppies are the reason I came here to begin with. I yelped \\"hush puppies\\" because I really wanted some. It was like all of a sudden I had a craving for them. This place came up with good ratings so I didn't think twice. They were a disappointment though. I like mealy puppies. The kind that start out with a nice sizzling crisp but are mildly sweet with the perfect crunchy but airy center. I don't like them to be gummy and mushy in the center but that's what I got. They barely had that mild sweet flavor. They were very dense, and stick-to-the-roof-of-the-mouth, gummy. Didn't enjoy them but I didn't HATE them. Just mediocre. We also ordered a side of Mac and cheese...flavorless but not exactly the kids menu kind. The Mac and cheese was do-able with just a sprinkle of salt and pepper. Overall, the food was a tad on the tasteless side but the quality wasn't bad at all. The shrimp were quite large and has they been seasoned just a LITTLE MORE and a bit more crisp, they would have been on point. The place looks brand new and kinda sparse as far as furnishings go. They only have one register so be prepared to wait if there is a crowd. Also, the cashier seemed to be the only person in the front of the house working. She was the waitress as well as the cashier so she'd leave the register for long spurts to deal with table.

Last night we waited 45 and this has happened numerous times. Granted, the resturant is very busy but to wait that long when you have a reservation is absurd! If anything they should dial down on the amount of people that can make reservations. \\n\\nI will say our server made up for it. Our waiters Steven and an amazing lady who I can't remember her name but she was 5 stars for sure. One of the best waiters I've ever had. There were 6 of us so we were a handful and she did everything she could to make our experience beyond excellent.

I've never had them made the same way twice. Just a note though, that this dish and one other one are not certified halal (the rest of the menu is though, I believe) and I think it was kind of the server to let me know though they should probably put it in the menu. I did think it was pricey at $19.95 + $3.95 for the actual large flat noodles, but they were very good. Like other places I had this dish at, it's composed of potatoes, bone in chicken, and bell peppers. This one was a braised sauce/stew though instead of the stir fry versions I've had at other places. Because of the sauce, there was more complexity in the flavour.\\n\\nI've also gotten to try the cumin lamb wraps, which I thought were too heavy on the cumin. I loved the black pepper beef and mushroom dish! $16.95 and gave me leftovers for 2-3 meals! The thin strips of beef was cooked just right (not dry) and had this amazing umami flavour. We also shared a goat stew which was too bloated with the base of the cabbage, which isn't easy to chew, but I loved the firm yet silky tofu and the slightly tart soup. We also had lamb jiaozi because I've never seen them anywhere else but it tasted like it was just lamb and could've benefited from something with it (much like the traditional pork and chive pairing).\\n\\nBut hands down my favourite dish is the lamb kebabs. I have never had lamb so good. The seasoning was just right and so was the texture. It tasted like lamb but not gamy either. This is the dish I would order on every visit here. They're also easy to share with friends as an appy if you want your main to be something else.\\n\\nThe restaurant is beautiful and well decorated.

Their portions are plentiful, especially the lemon-blueberry ricotta french toast.  It was definitely worth trying out, very sweet, so it was helpful to balance it with a side order or something savory (i.e., corned beef).  It's always a gamble getting french toast in places, as I always hope it wont come out really soggy on the inside (i.e., undercooked), but this place did it perfectly! Not sure how they did it, but they managed to have a nice crispy outside but still be soft from the ricotta without tasting like the bread itself was undercooked.  \\n\\nThe Morning Monte Cristo sandwich is also very unique, a bacon & eggs sandwich using french toast as breading, who knew!\\n\\nI also was a really big fan of their corned beef, as it was nice pieces of shredded meat (i.e., NOT hash), perfectly seasoned.  \\n\\nOnly down side is, on a week day, you'd expect faster service..., but seeing as it looked like only one server servicing the entire upstairs area, I cut her some slack."},{"name":"One Saigon","address":"979 Hornby St","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"This tiny place on Hornby could be a lot better.

The ambiance is perfectly suited for a cold evening- dark, cavernous and warm, and we felt right at home the moment we stepped into the crowded but comfortable back dining room. We happened to see other friends at an adjoining table, and invited them to join us, making for a convivial atmosphere that our server was more than happy to accommodate. We immediately ordered from their gargantuan beer list- several strong IPAs for us, which were all delicious. Her and I shared the grilled cheese and celery root soup combo- the grilled cheese was good but the soup was better, strongly vegetal but creamy enough to please the palate. We also had the seasonal vegetable special- a sweet and sour Brussels sprout saut√© topped with dried cranberries, a perfect complement to the seasonal weather outside. Friends had the Asian-inspired pork bun, which also looked fantastic. However, the stand-out by far was the pretzel. It was served in a loaf, resembling a challah or a brioche, with a light cheese dipping sauce- it was chewy, dense and incredibly delicious. The only downside was the salt and vinegar popcorn shared by other friends- it was overly salted and over seasoned enough to feel almost dusty on the tongue. The service was casual but friendly, and suited to the atmosphere. The Porter is the place to come for excellent gastropub fare in an environment that is far too cool to call itself a gastropub.

This Thai restaurant has been around for as long as I can remember.  While the words \\"Thai Cuisine\\" are posted in large print above the storefront, this place serves Chinese food as well.  I've been an infrequent customer over the past decade+ and not much has changed over the years.  It's a popular intown Thai joint for both dine-in and take-out, conveniently situated at the center of Midtown, Buckhead, and the Emory area.\\n\\nMy experiences with Little Bangkok have been at dinnertime.  Judging from the reviews, lunch appears to be lackluster.  I've had pretty good experiences at dinner.  I've only ordered off the Thai menu, though I don't doubt their Chinese food is just as tasty.  In most cases, the restaurant's Thai food really reminds me of home-cooked meals, both in terms of quality and presentation.  Virtually all of the entrees can be had for under $10 each, which is very reasonable at dinner, considering the double-digit prices at nearby competitors.\\n\\nHere are some dishes I've tried and recommend:\\n\\nAppetizers:\\nNua Num Tok - sliced grilled sirloin with mint, chili, onion, cabbage and lime juice\\nNam Sod - minced pork mixed with chili, carrots, crushed peanuts, ginger, onion and lime juice\\n\\nEntrees:\\nMassaman Chicken - chicken sauteed in massaman curry with avocado, carrots, potatoes, onion, green peas, spring onion and cashews\\nBasil Chicken - onion, red bell pepper, chicken, and basil stir-fried in basil sauce\\nLard Na Beef - broccoli and wide noodles in a thick gravy sauce\\n\\nThe Nua Num Tok and the Nam Sod are both Thai-style salads I think are underappreciated.  At Thai restaurants, most diners tend to spring for the spring rolls or satays (skewered meat), so oftentimes these salads go unnoticed.  Nam Sod was one of my favorite Thai foods growing up.  The minced/ground pork mixture is served with fresh cabbage (or lettuce) leaves so you can make your own wraps.  Both the Nua Num Tok and Nam Sod are spicy and tangy.\\n\\nMost of the entrees can be served with either chicken, beef, pork, or tofu.  I listed my favorites above paired with the proteins I liked best.  The massaman curry at Little Bangkok is full-flavored and aromatic.  Massaman sauce is made from coconut milk, nuts, and an assortment of spices including cinnamon and star anise.  It's probably my favorite among the Thai curries.\\n\\nBasil Chicken is a simple, but appetizing and satisfying dish.  I like the freshness and tenderness of the chicken.  The Lard Na Beef noodle dish is also very good.  The noodles are especially slurpy because of their wide size and the heavy gravy.  It's chock full of big pieces of broccoli and other veggies.\\n\\nService is polite and attentive.  The food comes out from the kitchen fast and so does the check.  This is a casual joint and you can tell by its worn look that it's been around a while.  Seating is cozy.

The Brooklyn wrap that my wife had was just as plain and flavorless. The kale slaw seemed to be missing the dressing and like every thing else had no flavor.  The price that you pay for the food is deserving of  a much higher quality, they actually served their food on paper plates, my first few visits they used a quality metal dish. I took an out of town guest here tonight and I was embarrassed by the food. I should have known something was up when we were the only people there ay 6pm on a Saturday.

There were large gaps of time where I was looking around attempting to flag down a waiter for a glass of wine or something additional like a glass of water. Then there were other times when the first waiter would stop by to check on things and then almost immediately after, the 2nd waiter would stop over and ask how things were going?

I thought I'd dine here again this morning since we were up early at 10:30 AM and was hoping to beat the crowd. We did beat the massive crowds of people, but the hosts forgot to seat us...which brings about this low rating, \\n\\nYou enter through the back of the building to three hosts standing behind the host stand where they ask for how many people and take your name. He said immediately that he would seat us after he told the other host to grab more menus which she did within a minute. However, he forgot to seat us. He even sat two groups of people that came after us. The other hostess noticed us staring at them, but made no move to tell the head host about seating us. When we inquired about our table five minutes later, he asked for names and how many again...as if we didn't just walk in five minutes ago. He responded with either wait for a table to open or result to sitting at the table next to the door and host stand. We just went ahead and chose that table since we saw how busy it was getting and we were in a rush. Just FYI, don't sit at that table! The massive overflow of crowds that came in flowed into our dining area \\"bubble\\" and it was just so uncomfortable. They were so close that I can hear everyone's conversation. The table too small for two people. I was so scared for someone to knock off our food from the table. The only thing that pretty much saved this review from getting a one star is our server was nice and patient with us as we were not too familiar with the menu. \\n\\nFOOD: I ordered the sausage and gravy skillet with jack cheese instead of cheddar cheese. I switched out my biscuit for an everything bagel. I also ordered a side of grits. My boyfriend decided that it was a bright idea to order a burger for breakfast. He ordered the club house burger with oven-roasted potatoes. My order came in a small skillet pan that contained oven-roasted potatoes, diced sausages, onions, peppers, shredded jack cheese all topped with two sunny-side up eggs. Be careful of not scratching over the metal of the skillet pan with your fork or spoon as it tastes like iron. YUCK! I think the skillet needed more oven-roasted potatoes. Luckily, my boyfriend had potatoes with his burger so I added more to my skillet with his portion. I also topped my skillet with hot sauce which gives it more of a kick. My favorite part of the meal was the grits. Grits were smooth and just heavenly. The everything bagel was pretty standard. I like that I have various kinds of jams to add to my bagel. I did not get a chance to taste my boyfriend's club house burger, but he said it was pretty good and described it as a 6 out of 10. The club house burger came with a medium well beef patty, jack and cheddar cheese, bacon, lettuce, tomato, and a sunny-side up egg. \\n\\nOverall, I would only dine here on a weekday when it's not as busy and when I don't feel like traveling too far for breakfast.\\n\\nTIPS/Quick Facts:\\n- Make sure you park in the back of the restaurant since that's where you enter into the restaurant. \\n- Better not to take large crowds here especially on the weekends since it's so packed. \\n- Complimentary coffee located next to the host stand.\\n- FREE WI-FI (no password needed)"},{"name":"La Taqueria Taco Bar & Grill","address":"636 Hyde Park Ave","city":"Roslindale","stars":"4.5","text":"Love this place!

I'm going to admit that I don't know all the secrets of the menu because one thing keeps me coming back every time - the House Special Pancake. \\n\\nImagine a beaten egg, fried thin like a crepe, filled with chopped Napa cabbage, crunchy fried wonton (?), and a dash of hot sauce, and the whole thing topped with cilantro and black sesame seeds. This is the ultimate in satisfying comfort food: rich but not too rich, soft on the outside crunchy on the inside, warm from the pan, a mingling of flavors and textures in your mouth. Oh, and it's about $8.  In the winter it warms you up. In the summer it's not too heavy. I daydream about this thing. \\n\\nI can also recommend the sesame noodle (add a dash of that black vinegar they have on the table!) and the wontons with spicy sauce.

Neither dark chocolate nor asparagus are among my favorite foods, but the chefs somehow made the combo work incredibly well. The food and drink menu change pretty often, and the Meatless Monday menu changes every week, I believe, so there are always new dishes to try. \\n\\nI'm not much of a drinker, and hardly ever order mixed drinks, but I usually can't resist getting a mixed drink or two here.

I am a bit of a researcher so the process was not a simple one. I began by looking online at all the different manufacturers to find what bikes would best fit our needs. Once we had an idea of what we wanted we began visiting all the bike shops in the Portland area... those of you in the bike community know there are a ton of shops in Portland!\\nNot to discredit any of the other shops that we visited but upon arriving to Western Bikeworks we knew this is where we wanted to make our purchase. The sales staff was very attentive and patient. We had a ton of questions and they had all the answers and were willing to describe everything that we asked. Being newbies to the bike phenom we were concerned that the shops would guide us in the wrong direction or turn their nose upward to some of our simpleton questions. This was definitely not the case here. Joel (the store manager) spent hours, yes hours walking us through the store describing the differences in bikes, apparel, accessories and everything else that we would need. It was truly an awesome experience.\\nThe store is large and well organized. Their selection was far superior to any other shop that we had visited. Their prices were also excellent. Along with the purchase of my bike they offered us a personalized fit session, the fit was far more detailed than I anticipated. He not only adjusted the bike to fit me properly but discussed proper mechanics while riding, how to maintain my bike and made adjustments to factory equipment that was not setup as efficiently as it could have been. Much thanks to Geoff. Along with the fit they offer 15% off all accessories purchased with your new bike and a free tune up upon break in. Many stores offer similar packages but Western Bikeworks set the highest standard. \\nI am very thankful to their staff for their friendliness, insight and support.

Parking here is mostly street (parallel), which I'm no master at so I had to opt for public parking which was a few blocks away. Carrying a two year old with all her necessities and a birthday gift in 90 degree weather made it a not so fun walk.\\n\\nWhen we got to the restaurant we accidentally walked into the gift shop, which is the door on the left so we crossed back over the foyer and made our way over to the door on the right (nothing was labeled to define what was the gift shop/restaurant).\\n\\nOnce finally arriving we were greeted by two kind hostesses who whisked us off to our table.

My only complaint would be was when I did order my drink it was forgotten about, but as soon as it was brought to their attention I had it almost immediately.\\n\\nWe ordered milk buns that come with regular butter and biscuits that come with honey butter.

The brisket was well smoked and had some marbling but nothing overly flavorful but it was good. The sausage is a pork/beef blend and it was smoked correctly and although I prefer beef sausage it was still filling. The pork ribs were the highlight of the all you can eat because the rub on them is so good you don't need sauce, the rub is a sweet candy tasting like rub similar to St. Louis style ribs at Pappy's or Bogart's. Last but definitely not least was the bison ribs my wife ordered which was AMAZING! Smoked extremely well, had a little kick on the rub and were two pretty big ribs.

Lots of crispy rice bits stuck to the pot. Make sure you pour some sweet soy sauce on top of the rice otherwise it's bland.

This particular suite (#110) shares about half the blame, previously housing Red Mountain BBQ, Kebab Grill, and Quiznos, as well as some place called \\"City-Boy's Urban Cafe\\" that opened and closed so fast that I never actually saw it, despite the fact that I live down the street and pass by here regularly.\\n\\nAnyway, I digress. Sabor del Caribe is the new tenant, and based on the head count when I walked in, they're not too worried about becoming the next in a long line of Ghosts of Restaurants Past. It's a bit hectic in here, maybe because they haven't yet figured out a system to keep traffic flowing smoothly.  People coming in, people leaving, people waiting in line, people paying, and people trying to get their drinks and utensils. Everyone is in each other's way. Walking in the door, I had to stop and look around for a few seconds just to figure out where I needed to be. How do I order something that's made to order? At the register? With the guy working the buffet counter?\\n\\nThey might want to streamline the ordering process a bit -- there was a real disconnect between the ordering process and paying for the meal. The woman at the register had no idea that I had ordered but not paid, until I told her I needed to pay for my meal. There was no record of what I had ordered at the register. Had I been an unscrupulous type, I could easily have eaten for free.\\n\\nSo I paid and sat down, and when my name was called I went up to get the meal.  I ordered the pork mofongo, which was big and filling.  I almost couldn't finish it, but it was delicious so I made it happen.  The mofongo is garlicky and flavorful, and the pork inside and out was very tender.  It's not my favorite mofongo in town, but it's great nonetheless, and the price is right; the mofongo and a drink cost a total of about $10.\\n\\nThis isn't the only game in town, obviously. Rice & Beans on Alafaya and Estrella Latina on Goldenrod are both the same style counter service Puerto Rican restaurant.  But if Sabor del Caribe can keep the quality up and keep people coming through the door, I don't think we'll be taking bets any time soon on the next restaurant to set up in suite #110."},{"name":"Barcelona Inman Park","address":"240 N Highland Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Ok so I came here with one thing in mind: paella.

CoM is the best restaurant in Boston, period. It's a Michelin star waiting to happen. Ask the locals who come at 9 pm on a Sunday for the special 4-course menu. Ask the chefs on their feet from 10 am to midnight, in constant creative motion. They come to work for and to stand tall with the best. \\n\\n2. You can possibly have the greatest meal of your life here, if you do it right. And for most of you, \\"doing it right\\" will be harder than you think. But if you're up for it, then keeping reading.\\n\\n(a) Come alone. \\n\\nYes, alone. No distractions from the food and the chefs in the beehive of an open kitchen. No wives, no boyfriends, no anniversaries or birthdays or promotions. No special occasions or people whatsoever. \\n\\nIt's got to be just you and the food. Nothing and no one can get in the way, not even the ones you love.\\n\\n(b) Ask for one of the four seats at the chef's counter, which look directly into the kitchen and allow you to see, hear, and sometimes even talk to the chefs. Your gaze is at them, not at the other 95 or so diners and 30 staff who make this place run to feverish perfection. The 3:1 ratio, by the way, is one of the secrets here. That's serious attention to every little detail possible.\\n\\n(c) No matter what, always order the 8-course tasting menu. And no matter the cost, always go with the white and red wine recommended pairings. This will cost you around $250 (including the 20% tip). That's the price you will pay for greatness.\\n\\n(d) Eat slowly. Use your hands if necessary (it will be). Do not let a single trace of food served to you go back to the kitchen. Sop up the sauce with the bread. Eat each and every last piece of bread in your basket, including the crumbs. Do not let a single morsel go to waste. These are gifts given freely, not cheaply. Do not under any circumstances turn them away. \\n\\n(e) Think about texture and not just taste. Imagine that each course is a museum of art masterpiece and you are walking from one gallery to the next. Except in this museum, the paintings come to you, and not the other way around:\\n\\n(i) Chilled Maine mussels with essence of fennel, a kiss of the sea, and discs of red radish;\\n(ii) Kona Kampachi (ocean-ranched Almaco jack) sashimi with Asian pear and baby red shiso leaf - delicate pieces of the Pacific from half a world away;\\n(iii) Tasmanian sea trout filet slow cooked with chorizo oil, pimenton, and chives - red smoke and pink flesh and yellow oil all melting and merging into one;\\n(iv) Seared scallop with peekytoe crab and polenta - crunch, crust, crustacean, corn.\\n(v) Whole wheat pappardelle with duck hearts and wild foraged mushrooms - the deep and dark tastes of a New England forest floor in the leafy throes of mid-autumn;\\n(vi) Veal sweetbreads (the hypothalamus, in this case, not the thymus) with a roasted parsnip glaze reminiscent of light maple - would that all brains were so delicious;\\n(vii) Venison in rare loin medallions and in sausage casing, with chestnuts and quince - hoof, antler, fruit, nut, tree. \\n(sorbet course) candied celery and green apple - a cleansing cool rush of chlorophyll;\\n(viii) Pumpkin cheesecake with gingerbread foam and orange - sophisticated sweetness in grandma's old-fashioned spiced form.\\n\\nWines - Chenin Blanc, Loire valley; St. Joseph, Northern Rh√¥ne (100% Syrah). \\n\\nSometimes I say to people who review on Yelp to focus on the experience, not just on the food.  But here, it's different. The food and the experience, they are one in the same, locked in a passionate embrace that you cannot escape, because you won't want to. \\n\\nBut the food *is* your companion that night: your date, your friend, your lover, your secret affair; if you want it to be the best, you must leave behind all the rest. \\n\\nWhile there are many reasons to come here, if you truly love great food and genuinely admire the chefs who create it, then there is only one initial option.

Whether it be local in San Francisco, to the East Coast like Virginia and New York, and now to multiple cities in Texas.  Well, my way of finding good deals on hotels is to use the Hotels.com website.  It has many filters to allow me to find something that doesn't have dirty bed sheets or small bathrooms, but still won't break the bank with rooms that have a Jacuzzi filled with champagne.  It seems that wherever I go, the filters show that Omni is always rated very well and a good bargain, to boot.\\n\\nOmni in Austin fit the bill this time, but not only that, it was centrally located to many of the things we wanted to do while in town.  The parking is plentiful here, not to mention FREE!  The check-in process was easy and quick.  No one offered to help us with our bags, which isn't a big deal, because I would've declined anyway.  But, it would've been nice if they at least offered.  We got to the room and while it seemed a little outdated, it served its purpose.  The only negative I would have was that there weren't many power plugs.  In this day and age of excessive electronics, it's always a good idea to have a few plugs available on the tables, so I'm not going behind the bed or charging my phone in the bathroom.\\n\\nThe pool was nice and, while it seemed a little cold at times, seemed fairly clean.  Part of it even goes indoors to where it meets up with an area with the Jacuzzi and also a gym.  Speaking of the gym, it has some treadmills, bikes, an elliptical machine, some free weights, and some other multi-purpose equipment.  It also had a water dispenser and clean towels.  Make sure to bring your room key, so you can get in.  Also, please don't be that guy who comes from the pool, lifts a few weights, and then leaves puddles of water on the equipment and floor for someone else to clean up (true story!).\\n\\nLastly, they gave my kids some free Popsicles when I was in the gift shop.  I thought that was pretty cool.  Pretty typical of Omni to do that kind of thing.  Unfortunately, there was a little bit of a hiccup when checking out.  There was a supposed charge of $4 on my bill from the gift shop and, while I tried to let the girl at the desk know that I didn't charge anything, I could see an argument quickly coming to fruition.  Instead of ruining the kids' vacation by causing a scene for $4, I decided to just pay it.  So, either they charged me for those popsicles, or they let someone charge something to my room."},{"name":"Antico Forno","address":"93 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Absolutely fantastic.

Sometimes they will have a very good spicy fish with cabbage, but that will be further to the left, so you'll know that this isn't the same thing they usually have.\\n\\nThe next pair of trays is something unusual: they will have chicken kidney with vegetables, which is super tasty. Sometimes they have beef liver, which I like, but have to be in the mood for.\\n\\nThe next trays are usually vegetables, among which is a nice dish with mushrooms and chicken - not too much sauce, so that one is pretty good.\\n\\nThe last two trays next to the section divider have orange chicken, which is a staple and is very good if you don't know what to get for your 3rd dish. Before, along with the orange chicken there was another chicken dish which they have since replaced with garlic bok choy.\\n\\nGoing down the second panel of dishes, they have a lot of pork here. All of these are good. One of my favorite things here is the pork with tofu. The pork pieces are very nice and fatty. There are other dishes like the kung pao chicken which they have fairly often - that one is hit or miss. If it's steaming, you know it's fresh and it's good. Otherwise if it looks like it's been sitting out there for a while, pass up on it.\\n\\nThis is also where they sometimes have a spicy cabbage + some sort of protein dish. This is a large tray, and takes the place of two trays. It could be spicy fish or spicy pork. If they have this dish on the particular day that you go, make sure to get it, because it is very good. Not extremely spicy, so don't worry about that.\\n\\nNear the end they have fried things, I got the fried little fishes once, but not again since then. Not that they were bad, just usually go for other things.\\n\\nDefinitely make sure to grab the soup. It's a very clear broth based on beef and vegetables. It's nice and salty, and I usually just drink it out of the styrofoam cup.\\n\\nNow the tricky part here is seating. The place is very communal, and thus don't be afraid to sit down at the same long table as other people! Unless a small table is open, you probably won't get your own table, especially when you go during lunch. If you see a nice empty seat just sit down and eat! They have sauces at the table, Sriracha to add that extra kick.\\n\\nAll in all, this place is fantastic. I think that if I ever move away from Boston and visit for a weekend, this would be one of the places I would come back to. I would also go see my parents."},{"name":"Pizzeria La Sorrentina","address":"3000 SE 164th Ave, Ste 107","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4.5","text":"If they're actually there, or they're actually open, it's excellent pizza.

I figured I'd give it another shot for my mom's Birthday. A little different this time around - the setting/ambiance is still sexy/chic, and the service was great. The food was just...Okay. Got a bunch of oysters to start, about 4 or 5 different varieties and to be honest they all tasted the same. No real nuances. I also got the clam chowder to start. A little too salty (I love salt) and nothing to write home about. The rest of my family got fish (monkfish and rock fish), and to be honest I found them to be a little bland. I ordered the fried chicken with honey glaze, and it ended up just being average fried chicken over a smearing of honey. It wasn't bad at all, but it wasn't great either. I guess I expected more? Lastly, I had the butterscotch for dessert and it was okay, but again more bland than when I first remember trying it a few years back.\\n\\nI'd come back here for drinks/light apps, but I don't think I'd be back for dinner.

Only a 20 minute drive away from Kissimmee/Lake Buena Vista, the Rocco's tacos in Dr Phillips is definitely a gem of a restaurant.\\n\\nGuac: This restaurant is known for their guac, so you HAVE to get it. They make it tableside for you, allowing you to influence the amount of jalape√±o, onion and tomato put into it. Custom guac is the way to go! While it's pricey, it's a huge quantity so if you're in a group of 4+, you'll be good to go on this one, with guac to spare (we had extra, anyways!).\\n\\nFood: As for the food itself, the elotes (street corn) was pretty solid. I'd give it a 7/10, good but not the best I've ever had. I did however LOVE their house made hot sauces, as well as their tacos in lettuce wraps! Such an great way to enjoy the taco components without the extra carbs of a tortilla. The food itself was one of the lower points of my experience, however it was definitely solid food, just not anything special or impressive: just good, this spot is for the atmosphere!\\n\\nAmbiance: the tequila bar outside is an awesome space to wait for your table and hang out at! They have a full service bar of everything you could want when it comes to tequilas, plus little wooden shot glass holders when you choose to do a flight or tasting. My group tried a speciality tequila they offered, and then I got a margarita. They ALSO have a DJ inside the restaurant, creating a perfect party vibe full of energy and vibrance. The decor and design of the space feels contemporary, relaxed and fun, definitely a comfortable and cozy spot that feels upscale. \\n\\nService: our service here was good. The waitress we had was definitely busy but managed our table of 5 well. She forgot to bring a few of the things we asked for a couple of times, but again, she was super busy. The tableside guac thing was amazing and the person creating our special guacamole was very accommodating and sweet. \\n\\nI'd definitely recommend trying out Rocco's Tacos you're in the area or near one of their locations.

The food here is superb, the service is always top notch, and it's just such a fun place to go to with friends! All the dishes (tapas) are small and meant to be shared. I would say 4 small dishes would be enough for 2 people! \\n\\nHere are some of my favorites:\\n\\nAlbondigas (meatballs): this is a traditional dish you'd get at any restaurant in Spain, and it sure doesn't disappoint here! These juicy meatballs are not only delicious, but are also humongous, so if you're wanting to save some money and order minimal dishes but still leave with a happy tummy, these are the way to go!\\n\\nMussels: Delicious heaping bowl, you get a really generous portion and the actual mussels are pretty substantial in size. The flavor of the broth is unbelievable, so make sure you save it and ask for extra bread to dip in it after the mussels are gone!\\n\\nGambas Al Ajillo (garlic shrimp): another typical dish you'd find in any Spanish restaurant. The dish here has just the right amount of \\"garlicky\\" taste to it, not too overwhelming but enough to where you can really taste it throughout the meat of the shrimp... YUM!\\n\\nPatatas Bravas: basically diced potatoes smothered in salsa & garlic aioli (more of a mayonnaise-y consistency). These were cooked to perfection, with the outer layer a little crispy and the inside deliciously soft! This is another traditional Spanish tapas dish and also another one of those dishes that'll really fill you up quick! \\n\\nSwordfish: honestly the best swordfish I had ever had- the meat was tender and had a crispy layer on top, and whatever seasoning/marinade they used was extremely so tasty! It also came with salsa verde drizzled on top, which I would never think to put with fish, but it really was just the cherry on top! \\n\\nSquid ink risotto: comes with shrimp and is very rich both in flavor and in consistency! Sometimes squid ink dishes can be a little too overwhelming or the sauce is too thick, but this is not the case at all here! I know a lot of people can be turned off by the dark color, but it just tastes like alfredo or something to me but with an extra kick .... try it I dare you! :P \\n\\nI could go on and on about so many more dishes here, but those are my top must-tries for now. I've tasted some of the same tapas in actual Spain, and I must say, Barcelona Wine Bar in good ole' ATL beats them all! The atmosphere here is very trendy and almost like a bar/club scene at nighttime. It gets PACKED and can be very loud, but it's so much fun to go here with a couple of friends, especially if you're celebrating a Birthday or any other special occasion! Just make sure to make a reservation or you'll probably be waiting for an hour or more. \\n\\nService here is great!

They are much, much improved by adding some of the Habanero BBQ sauce, then they are great.  The slaw is very different that what you are probably used to.

The tater salad was of the German variety in that it was heavy on the mustard and light on the relish and egg.

I love how the waitresses have on authentic Puerto Rican dresses, and the waiters are dressed accordingly as well. Inside, there are large ornament like lighting fixtures, filled with Christmas ornaments. Its very sparkly and brings your attention to the lights. I noticed that the industrial vibe that it gives in there, paired with the Puerto Rican flag, transports you to another place in Orlando. Now, for the food. \\n\\nWe ordered chicken wings for appetizers as well as chicken and beef empanadas. They brought the empanadas out, along with the mayo ketcup. Five stars for the mayo ketchup. The empanadas were large, however they were barely filled with chicken and they were small pieces of potato in there as well. The chicken wings were just fried, with no seasoning or sauce, but there was the mayo ketchup (to the rescue). For dinner, we ordered mofungo, Creole chicken, garlic chicken, macaroni and cheese for the kids, snapper, and pork chops. The porkchops were good, but they were fried, so I cannot really say how they would be without being covered inThe breading. \\n\\nThe chicken, I am not sure where this chicken came from, but it was very large and not in charge! It was very rubbery, I tried four of the other chickens at our table, and they were all the same. I had to send mine back. I was unable to eat my dinner, and everyone else that got a dish with Chicken, was very embarrassed , so they did not send those back as well. I ordered the shrimp instead, and it came out within five minutes, as if it had just beenWaiting for someone to pick it up. The shrimp were a great size, but they were not fresh nor were they warm in temperature. The rice and beans were very disappointing. They barely had any taste and I am not sure how you can mess up beans. \\n\\nFor dessert, I was afraid to even try that. I was very disappointed as well at the pricing of this restaurant. I feel that every single thing, was extra money. I also got tostones, and they were an extra 3.50. There was no salt or mojo on it. I did ask for mojo and it tasted rancid. The kids ordered Mac n cheese and it was the Kraft box macaroni. What a shame. There were plenty of managers that would walk by and say hello very briefly, but they did not come out to see how your food was. \\n\\nUltimately, i was just very surprised at this restaurant because of all the great reviews. I did not feel the same way. I have been to many Puerto Rican restaurants and I'm not sure what happened here. I had to go to dinner after I came from dinner! I travel to Puerto Rico on and off, and the food is nothing like it.

During my time there, when I asked her to repeat something, she wasn't shy or nervous about it at all, and bravely repeated what she said. You go, girl haha. Gotta practice to get better. After my friend and I placed our orders, I checked in on Yelp and realized that I could get a free appetizer with an entree order. When I asked the waitress if I could go ahead and redeem it, she gladly added it and asked my friend if she'd like to check in on Yelp as well. She even gave us a card with the wifi info so my friend could download Yelp on her phone and do so. Overall, because the space is small, the waitress we had and the other staff were very attentive to when we needed something. \\n\\nThe Paitan sea salt ramen was delicious; I'm not sure I'm qualified to say more than that as I'm not a connoisseur of the Japanese ramen.

I'd almost say to get your food less spicy than you want and add this stuff till you get to your desired heat leve.\\n\\nHere's what we got:\\n\\nTom Kha: Best I have ever I mean EVER had. I have eaten this soup all over San Francisco and Seattle and it was never as good as here.

I got it two star, I was gonna do 4 but thankfully the waiter was like, let's just try 2 cuz we make it very spicy. Thank god he warned me. It was plenty spicy at 2 stars. I would go so far as to say that in this dish the 2 star is other places 5+. If you aren't a total chili head, start with 1 star. I got mine with chopped chicken instead of sliced cuz that's how I'm used to it and it was amazing.\\n\\nTom Yum: I have never had this before as I always stick to the Kha but it was fantastic as well. This one also comes with Shrimp whereas the Kha doesn't which makes it a bit more delicious. \\n\\nRed Chicken Curry: My husband got this and liked it. He got it with 2 stars as well and while it wasn't as spicy as the basil chicken he said that the extra spice actually didn't work in his dish as well.

As good as it gets.  The accompanying slice of white bread was great for sopping up the delicious juices.

The girl on the phone wasn't super friendly, and basically just said well you'll probably have to wait when you get here then.\\n\\nWhen we arrived, the place was absolutely packed. Our table outside was great, and our waitress arrived quickly to get our drink order. We each ordered sangria, and it was brought promptly and was really great tasting. After this, things went a little downhill. Our waitress was MIA and we couldn't flag anyone down to start ordering anything. After about 30 minutes, we finally ordered a salad and some cheese. The salad was good, the cheese was average and we found it weird that no cracker/bread was served with it. \\n\\nI think our main problem at this point was that we had now been seated an hour, and we could hear the table that had just been seated behind us ordering tapas while we couldn't seem to get anyone's attention to order. The people bringing us our wine/salad & cheese were not our waitress, and were dropping it off in such lightning speed that we couldn't slow them down enough to ask for our waitress.\\n\\nWe finally ordered a few tapas and a wine flight from a different waitress. We had a question about the flight and even though she was pleasant, she just didn't seem interested in giving us any suggestions. Our tapas came out and were great - the burrata, shrimp, redfish and empanadas were all hot and delicious. The biggest problem was that they all came out except for one, so we were done eating when the redfish finally arrived. By this time too, we realized our wine flight never arrived so we flagged down someone to cancel it. Who I assume was probably the manager however, came by with it and comped it for us which was very nice. We finished the meal with our original waitress, who we hadn't seen since the very beginning at this point, and she gave us some chocolate dipped strawberries on the house. \\n\\nOverall, the food and drinks were delicious. I also loved the ambiance. I just think they were severely understaffed for Valentine's Day and the whole place just seemed wildly unorganized and frantic. I don't think we were the only ones that had problems though, as we noticed a couple on our other side were having issues and it sounded like a part of their meal was being comped as well as they were vocally unhappy. \\n\\nI will definitely give this place another chance based on the food, the service was just a real let down this time."},{"name":"Urban Pl8","address":"99 Krog St NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"We stopped in at Urban Pl8 on a Saturday for lunch (around 1:30pm).

I'm not on a paleo diet, and I love bread, but I heard the food was just plain good - paleo or no. We tried the lobster roll, the bahn mi style burger, and the blueberry griddle cakes. The food was pretty good. The lobster roll was a bit small, but it tasted great. The bahn mi burger was good, but the bahn-mi flavoring wasn't particularly strong (and if you just want a good burger, you're probably better off going across the hall to Fred's Meat and Bread). Both came with a nice side salad. The blueberry griddle cakes were the only real disappointment - they were a little burnt, and just came on their own with no side items or anything - not what I'd expect if I'm paying $10 for takeout pancakes. \\n\\nSo, overall, I'd say Urban Pl8 is a nice addition to Krog Street Market, and probably really great for those with a more restricted diet, but as a 21st-century-diet, bread-loving eater, it probably won't be one of my go-to places."},{"name":"The Lower Depths","address":"476 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Solid place for Tex mex!

The taste of the fried rice was OK, but it was literally just a plate of brown rice which had presumably been fried. All the rice would need are some vegetables, and it would be an passable fried rice dish.\\n\\nThe boneless ribs and teriyaki steak were excellent, and I'd definitely get those again. I also got a strawberry bubble tea, which was also excellent. I can't give it a one star because the food came super fast, and there were some parts of the meal that were actually very good (for Chinese food). \\n\\nMaybe I put off Nan Ling so long not because I thought it would be bad, but because of what I thought it would say about me if I liked it. I'm happy to say that I wouldn't order from them again, so I guess that means I'm not a total scumbag. That said, you still have to try it once, and it's probably suggestions like that that have kept them in business."},{"name":"Atlanta Breakfast Club","address":"249 Ivan Allen Jr Blvd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Hands down THE best breakfast I've ever had.

I've also never been disappointed with any of the food, drinks or apps here, but I feel like I can't give it 5 stars because the prices seem way too high for this place even with Smith and Wollensky, Strip by Strega, and Maggianos all nearby. The portions are reasonable but on the small side and the prices are such that I'd be pissed if I ever ordered something that wasn't amazing and probably would never come back if that happened. The apps are all in the $14-21 range and are all on the small side. One app for dinner if you're hungry probably isn't going to cut it.\\n\\nThat being said, tonight I wasn't that hungry and ordered the octopus appetizer at the bar. The bartender sent out bread with it which made the app more substantial. And the bread came out hot from the oven which was amazing. The flavors in the octopus dish played very well together- it was mainly squid and romesco but based on the description I anticipated more peaches. I was good how it was- just not what I'd pictured when ordering- nbd.\\n\\n I didn't get an entree tonight but this is where things get pricey- the cheapest entree is the burger at $16 and everything else is $32 to $42 and not huge portions in my experience. It always makes me hesitant to eat here because by the time you get an app, entree and drinks with someone you're in the $200+ for dinner range which to me is Del Friscos pricing but with less food. The food is definitely more well thought out than a steakhouse and the menu often incorporates unique ingredients which I appreciate but it's never enough to make me want more than a drink and an app unless I'm literally starving and in the area for an event.\\n\\nThe cocktail menu is creative and the prices are on-par with restaurants and bars in the area- maybe a bit cheaper even and the wine and beer selection is great. Tonight I had  the mule Magnifique and it was great."},{"name":"Row 34","address":"383 Congress St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"You walk into an open room concept that has a contemporary design with a little rustic flare.

My overall verdict is that their sushi is bangin'! Sushi is made fresh to order and you can even watch the process of it being made while you wait. They currently have deals where you can order a larger amount of sushi along with a Boba drink of your choice. I think the total ends up being between $20 and $24 depending on what type of sushi rolls you get. I'd definitely recommend doing one of those pairings. It is a good amount of sushi for one person and their Boba drinks aren't too bad. \\n\\nI've also had their curry chicken rice bowl, curry style egg noodles with chicken and egg, and spicy poke bowl. If sushi isn't your thing I'd recommend the curry chicken rice bowl. It is a decent price and I think the curry is fairly good based on what you are paying, but again, I'd highly recommend the sushi."},{"name":"Antico Pizza","address":"1093 Hemphill Ave NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"The BEST pizza in Atlanta.\\n\\nAntico is true Napoli pizza.

My friend, his sister, their friend and I were trying to kill time after leaving the fair at the Portland Rose Festival nearby, so we were walking around and came across this place. It was really pretty inside, and it was pretty empty (it was about 4:30pm). It seemed like a good place to sit and relax. \\n\\nWe were given complimentary tea when we sat down, and since we had just pigged out on deep-fried carnival food and only had a limited amount of time, we didn't order any entrees, but we wanted to order something, so a couple of us were going to order dessert. We asked for green tea and red bean ice cream, which made the waitress very confused. She left to go \\"check on\\" the ice cream. When she came back, in extremely broken English she asked us if we were trying to order dessert before our meal, we had to clarify to her more than once that we only wanted dessert and no meal, and then she left to go \\"check on\\" the ice cream, again. She came back and said we could only have tempura ice cream because that was all that was available, and then she added that they only had strawberry. Then she added that they also had chocolate. So one of my friends and I said we'd take chocolate. Then she added that they only had one chocolate left, and one strawberry. So my friend changed her mind and said she didn't want any ice cream, so I was going to take the last chocolate one. Then the waitress left again, and at this point we could see her manager yelling in Chinese and waving his arms angrily at her. She came back and said, \\"I am so sorry. If no order meal you pay $2.50 each person for tea.\\" We started arguing with her, saying we were not about to pay $10 for a little pot of tea that we didn't even ask for, which they wanted to charge us for because we weren't able to order anything because they didn't have anything we were asking for. She and her manager started arguing in Chinese again and then she finally said \\"I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. You pay for tea, you leave now.\\" My friend was still trying to be polite but told the employees that she had never been treated this way at a restaurant before, and as we were walking out (of course without paying for the tea), the manager yelled \\"this is Chinese restaurant, not coffeehouse!\\" \\n\\nWe were basically kicked out because they didn't want us only ordering dessert.

My friend and I got the butternut squash, the lobster, and calamari dish. The calamari has to be the best calamari I have ever had. It was so crispy and juicy unlike any other calamari I have ever had.

The server recommended the pepper jack, so I went with that.  It took a while (approximately two beers), but when I got my burger it was hard to hide my disapppointment.  What I got was a sad, sad facsimile of the Yelp picture.  The pickle was there, and the fries in the newspaper cup were crispy.  However, the patties were as flat as a pancake and the whole thing looked like a double Whopper Jr.  This was certainly frozen patties, but not even Bubba burger quality.

Maybe my expectations were too high after reading so many glowing reviews on Yelp, but my pizza today was not the heavenly experience I was hoping for.\\n\\nGranted, maybe this is my fault.  I'm not the biggest pizza fan in the world.  I mean, I like pizza but I only really need to eat it once in a while.  I'm certainly not an expert on authentic pizza.\\n\\nToday, I went to Antico Pizza on my lunch break and tried the Margherita D.O.P with pepperoni.  I ordered it to-go, but I ate a slice of it in the car, so I don't think the issue was that I didn't eat it when it was fresh enough.  I managed to drip grease all over myself, but I realize that was my own fault (I was too impatient to follow the instructions explaining how to fold my slice of pizza before eating it).  And despite the visible grease, it didn't taste like a funky, nasty, greasy Pizza Hut pie, so I give points for that.\\n\\nI had some issues with the flavor balance of the pizza. The quality and flavor of the pepperoni was good, and I love buffalo mozzarella so no complaints there.  However, I felt there could have been more tomatoes and garlic on my pizza.  But the biggest issue was that the crust, though it had a nice texture, was burned on the outside to the point where it had a charred taste.\\n\\nSo, in summary, the toppings were good.  However,  the flavor balance (to me) was a little off (I tasted mostly meat and cheese with little of anything else).  Add to that the fact that my enjoyment of the pizza was hampered by the fact that it overwhelmingly tasted like burning, and this was really only a 3-star experience for me.\\n\\nThat said, my pizza came out VERY quickly and I'd be willing to try another kind someday.  I was just a little disappointed."},{"name":"Mozart's Coffee Roasters","address":"3825 Lake Austin Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Great coffee shop right on the lake.

The place is overpriced but you understand that in paying that extra money you are at least getting a show. Yet, unlike most restaurants that take reservations on Open Table these guys make you give them your credit card number so they can charge you a penalty fee if you are a No Show. Really a Win/Win for these guys if you make an Open Table reservation with them, if you make the reservation and it turns out you can't make it you get charged to your credit card for a No Show, yet if you show up they treat you like cattle and make you wait near a half hour for your \\"reservation\\" and then throw you in the worst table in the house. \\n\\nWe walked out right after being seated, I had had enough.\\n\\nThis is the second time that after making a reservation with them they tried to seat me in one of the crappiest tables in the house.

(The heat index on the date of my visit was 106 degrees. I'm not angry with whomever opened the door, probably in an effort to create some sort of cross-breeze within the small space.)\\n\\nWhen I complained about the scent of cigarette smoke, the woman behind the counter was kind enough to close the door. The other option that I mentioned, when I complained, was that she tell the smoking couple to move away from the storefront. She probably didn't feel comfortable doing that. And she shouldn't have to. The store should have a sign, as should all of the establishments along this stretch of street in particular, that smoking within x number of feet of the building is prohibited. (If no law establishing this exists, get one passed. If we set the number at 25 feet, for example, smokers would be forced to stand in traffic, because the sidewalk in this area is pretty narrow.) \\n\\nThis experience reminded me why I don't patronize any of the businesses along this stretch of Cambridge Street -- even Grasshopper, which I appreciate for being, it's my understanding, the first of its vegan kind in the area: nasty, dirty smokers, who seem to think that they're hipsters, and don't realize that they just seem inconsiderate and stupid. I wouldn't admit to college, hire, or rent an apartment to any of them, if it were up to me.\\n\\nAnd I won't be a customer of Whole Heart again, despite that fact that its food options, which I haven't tried, sound and smell like the kind of food I dream of preparing for myself. The health benefits of the vegan and vegetarian fare it offers are, I would argue, voided by the fact that it permits smoking within several feet of the door to the restaurant. \\n\\nBe a trendsetter, Whole Heart, by making it clear that you care about the lungs of patrons and community members. Stop allowing people to smoke in front of the store. If they do, hand them one of the plastic Greenware cups in which you served me my kombucha, but fill it with the cigarette butts that currently clog the grooves in the sidewalk in front of your store. If there's one population that deserves to be ostracized and made to feel guilty for the negative effect on public health that its drug habit has, it's smokers."},{"name":"The Porter Beer Bar","address":"1156 Euclid Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Really cool place to hang out with friends in east Atlanta\\nBut seating is limited and lighting is not the best \\n\\nFood Menu is small but a good variety and selection \\n\\nI ordered their fried goat cheese and pretzel as starters \\n\\nGoat cheese sticks were DECADENT.

Sakina Who was our original server, was very snarky about us asking for additional menus as we didn't realize we had left them on the table, and made a point to say that 'they WERE out there.' After taking drink orders twice, and still not taking any of our food orders after ignoring us for nearly 30mins, an additional, very polite and professional server finally came to take her place. She had great recommendations-- and we finally received table pickles after 1+ hour-- and as it was only our second time being there, I want to note that she was incredibly prompt with taking orders and bringing everything out as requested, quickly.

They are usually busy during lunch, so give yourself enough time to find parking and get lunch.

However, it is convenient and easy to get to. If you take 400 and take the back roads, you can avoid perimeter mall traffic.  \\n\\nDecor/ Seating: they have plenty of seatings - inside and out.

They did a great job cleaning the tables quickly for the next mass of customers. \\n\\nService: this is an order at the counter food place, where you order at the counter and they bring you your food. They will give you a number and you are supposed to put it on the metal holder at the table. MAKE SURE YOU PUT UP THE NUMBER, or else they won't be able to see you. Trust me, I learned the hard way... -_- \\n\\nFood: I ordered the grilled steak skewers dish, which came with rice and a side item - I chose corn on the cob. My friend ordered the salmon dish, which came with only rice. My grilled steak were delicious! The rice was cooked perfectly - not too mushy, not too dry. The corn on the cob was so good and sweet. It was ridiculous for a fast food type of place. My friend enjoyed her salmon dish as well. She said it was well seasoned. \\n\\nPrice: I didn't think the price was too bad, but the drinks are expensive. A medium sized soda was almost $3 - that's almost half as expensive as the dish itself. In total, 2 lunch entr√©es and 2 drinks were roughly $30. Kinda expensive for lunch, isn't it?

The have plenty of space to sit & the service is quick. I went ahead & ordered the Thurman's Choice. Great choice! Brisket was moist, ribs were amazing, and I loved the sausage. I thought it was fair in price considering how much food you get and the quality. If you're a big foodie, they offer the \\"family style\\" which is all you can eat BBQ!

My friend and I ordered the arroz con pollo but I counted 4 pieces of chicken that were mostly bone with very little to no chicken on them. It seemed to be just a big bowl of rice, and this was the case for both of our plates. The serving size was enough for two but there was not nearly enough meat. The rice was delicious, but I really wished I had chicken with my rice, which is why I did not make this a 5-star review. \\n\\nFor dessert, we tried the flan and the coconut tres leches.

Glad we made a reservation, since it was pretty busy -- and loud! I was seated right away, which was nice, and the service was great throughout the night. The seating itself was a little awkward -- it was a table right next to a door, so I was jostled by people headed in and out of the patio for most of the night. There also wasn't really anywhere to put my bag or coat. I'd ordinarily hang them off the back of my chair, but it was a stool and there were no hooks by us. \\n\\nI ordered a Hibiscus Margarita, which itself was good but I had asked for sugar on the rim and got salt, which always makes it a little more difficult for me to enjoy them. My mom got the Coco Loco Limeade mocktail and really liked it. For dinner, we split the Pork Carnitas Enchiladas as well as the Sweet Potato Enchiladas. The carnitas were my favorite but both were AMAZING. We couldn't get over how good the food was!! For dessert, we got the Dulce de Leches Cake and Burro Churros. The churros were good, but the cake blew us out of the water. It was just incredible!\\n\\nSo, while the seating itself was somewhat inconvenient (and uncomfortable), the food was amazing!! I definitely recommend giving this place a shot, but suggest making a reservation to avoid a wait.

We ordered 3 trust the chefs and their chicken skewers. While there was an initial mix up with the order in terms of the number of dishes we ordered, that was quickly resolved. Once the food came out, it became apparent that we shouldn't trust the chefs. \\n\\nMy initial complaint would be about the soy sauce of all things. Im not sure the brand they use, but I would suggest getting rid of the metallic tasting stuff. The cuts of tuna they used for the sashimi was much too thick and I found myself chewing a mouthful of raw fish for much longer than I would like. \\n\\nThe rolls here aren't bad, and the chicken skewers are good as well. They're non sushi stuff is fairly good as well. Honestly though, everything here is pretty expensive. The drinks are tasty, but seemed composed mostly of juice.

As someone who is obsessed with Thai food, my friends have told me about Little Bangkok and how they make the best Thai food in Atlanta...After tonight, I beg to differ. First, there's only realistically 2 parking spaces for the restaurant. Once you some how do find a spot to park in, you feel immediately cramped when you walk in due to the structure of the restaurant. The servers greet you and hurriedly seat you at your table and leave you to wonder the menu for what feels like an eternity. When someone does come by, they ask you what you want and scurry away again. My boyfriend and I came here for dinner and started off with the Tom Ka soup which is the best Tom ka soup I've had thus far. I then ordered a papaya salad which was WAYYYYY over priced (but I didn't realized that at the time and this isn't something that is on the menu). Since their pad thai is \\"the best,\\" we decided to get that. This was when things started to go downhill for us; when it came, we were both shocked at the portion size. It looked like something a mouse would eat and then beg the chef for some more...there was hardly anything on the plate!!!! I think the bean sprouts used as decoration cover 2/3 of the plate and the 1/3 was covered with 2 pieces of shrimp, 4 bites of chicken, and a sprinkle of noodles with egg. After the food was dropped off, our waiter disappeared and didn't check on us again until we hunted him down ourselves and asked for our check. The food is OK, the service was sub par, and parking is just a nightmare during normal hours of operation...I'm not coming back here again especially when I know that there are so many other great Thai restaurants in the city that deserves to have my $ thrown their way"},{"name":"Atlanta Breakfast Club","address":"249 Ivan Allen Jr Blvd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"We stopped here early morning on our way out of town.

Not the best chicken and waffles I've ever had but also not the worst. Boyfriend's peach cobbler french toast tasted much better. \\n\\nSaving grace was the super friendly service, just like you'd expect from your neighborhood diner.

We started off the month at Norman's Orlando (in the Ritz Carlton); and, finished the month at 1921 by Norman Van Aken.  First, let try to impress upon you how nice this space is... \\n\\nUpon arrival, we parked at the curb and walked up through the spacious courtyard, up a few steps, and into the restaurant.  To the right was an impeccable private dining facility, to the left the host counter, with an incredible piece of wood work on the corner, we went into one of the dining rooms, to find a Dale Chihuly chandelier, an ultra modern table with Plexiglass and Chrome underneath, modern wall sconces; and, rustic hewn log tables throughout.  It is eclectic; it is impressive.\\n\\nWe were greeted by Ryan R, who presented us with menus; and, offered to take our drink orders.  We hemmed and hawed over what to drink, not knowing what we would eat; and, I ordered a Negroni and my wife a glass of Merlot; but, then we decided on the tasting menu, with the wine pairing - Oh, NO! \\n\\nLuckily, wine by the glass is poured from the bottle, so she was able to very quickly refuse the pre-meal glass; and, switch up to the tasting menu with wine pairing - Great Save!   Don't ask which wines we had, as they were mostly from Spain; and, I am just not familiar with the different vintners, varieties, and blends.\\n\\nWe started out with the roasted \\"Beet Tartare\\" layered with Granny Smith Apples, Lemon Gel & Creme Fraiche Chip... yum!  The wine pairing was excellent, so bright, crisp, and clean!  The fish course was Ponce Inlet Mahi, with a pea puree, mushrooms, and a vinaigrette.  Again, the wine pairing was superb. \\n\\nFor mains, we were presented with the grilled Beef Shoulder with Beans, greens, and another vinaigrette.  This time, the wine pairing wasn't as \\"WOW\\" but, it worked sufficiently well.  The beef shoulder was so tender it was amazing, we'd expected something tougher that had been \\"stewed to death\\" but, this was as close to a filet mignon as you can get in any cut of beef!\\n\\nWe finished with a dessert of Panna Cotta, which we've opted for lately, as it can be light; but, it's a great flavor communicator.  The wine pairing was sweet, as it should be... I believe it was a port, or something very similar.  \\n\\nBeing foodies; and, a Yelper, we got into some amazing food discussions with Ryan, up until about 7:00 PM, when the dining room began to fill.  I am so glad we arrived early, as it gave us plenty of time to enjoy the setting, peruse the menu; and, enjoy our multi-course \\"event\\" of a meal.  Very good service was rewarded with 22% gratuity.  Fit for Foodies; and.

I really enjoyed that the managers came around several times asking if our meals were good and checking in. I enjoyed that very much! I also enjoyed the several options on the menu. I ordered the fried chicken biscuits with pepper gravy. It was \\"ok\\", the chicken was flavorful but the gravy was salty. I took a bite of my friends waffle and it was dense, I prefer a lighter, airy and crisp waffle instead. But nonetheless the food was decent.\\n\\nParking is basically non existent. I parked at the aquarium and it was $15! I am not a fan of visiting places that have no accommodations for parking :(\\n\\nThe wait is ridiculous, especially shocked because it was 10:30 on a Saturday. I followed the other reviews and added my name to the waistless via Yelp. What I did not like is that it showed me 46 parties ahead of me and to check in at 11:26...then I received a text notification 10 minutes later that my table was ready! I had only 5 minutes to get there from my vehicle, which was ridiculous. The app is not accurate. When I power through the line and get to the front they gave my table up, After 6 minutes...really???? Not to mention, the app said there were still 12 parties ahead of me. So, was my table ready or not? The greeter said she would \\"work me in\\" and I ended up waiting another 15-20 minutes. \\n\\nThat was frustrating. My advice is to put your name on the waitlist but still got to the front and \\"camp out\\" until you get your notification and run like hell to the front.

I had a meeting with Plummelo.com, where I will be guest blogging twice a month (check out my first post: http://blog.plummelo.com/), and since Craigie was close by and it was Thursday night, we decided to make a reservation. Highly recommended to do so. \\n\\nUpon arrival at Craigie on Main, we were seated at the most perfect table, all the way in the back corner. Romantic, but also ideal for a shy food blogger who HATES taking photos of food in public. I want to have them; I don't like feeling like a weirdo, and I am afraid I may get yelled at!\\n\\nI started the evening with a champagne cocktail, the Tavern Sparkler, which was made of the following: \\n\\nMedicinal Spiced Elixir \\ncider, Becherovka, honey, Champagne \\n\\n\\nDefinitely medicinal after a rushed afternoon, and delicious, this drink was the perfect way to start an autumn meal. It tasted of sweet honey and spicy cider and a slight hint of effervescence from the champagne. \\n\\n \\n\\nMy dining companion had a Piraat Amber Tripel IPA which was delicious but not as good as the beer he had later in the evening. Keep reading to find out. . . \\n\\nThe menu at Craigie offers a long list of tempting, local creations. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\nAs you can see Craigie locally sources just about everything from places like Verrill Farm. They make their menu after buying their ingredients, ensuring the freshest food possible. Unable to decide on meals, we opted for a six course tasting menu and the staff at Craigie were very happy to accommodate my no venison, no beef, no lamb, no rabbit request. Apparently all of those proteins were options though, showing the breadth of dishes one can try at Craigie. \\n\\nOur first course was an amuse bouche of three seafood delights. \\n\\n \\n\\nThe middle dish is a monkfish liver, and the one on the right is crispy brandade de morue with squid ink. I can not remember what the dish on the left was, except completely delicious, I want more of it. \\n\\nNext up, Hiramasa sashimi with red onion shiso salsa, avocado, and harissa-rose vinaigrette. \\n\\n \\n\\nI loved this dish. The bite of the onion, the creaminess of the avocado, and the perfect fish was subtly spiced with the harissa vinaigrette. It was light and flavorful. \\n\\nThen there were the grilled monkfish cheeks, meaty, substantial, delicious. \\n\\nI think it was at this point that I finished my cocktail and requested a wine pairing. Our outstanding server brought me a glass of 2007 Gr√ºner Veltliner 'Lois', a nearly clear Austrian wine with an acidity that went very well with the richness of the seafood. We often think of seafood as lighter, but as the meal progressed, we definitely had some very substantial fish dishes. The wine stood up to them without overcoming their flavors. This wine exemplified the elegance and flavor of the Austrian wine that we tried in Vienna, wine that was beautiful and strong, like many things Austria has to offer. . . \\n\\nThe hubs ordered another beer, a Foret, which was like champagne. No, not like the champagne of beers. Like real champagne, with a beautiful bubbly, yeasty  nose. \\n\\n\\nNext up was collar of a fish whose name I can not remember (sorry!) with a salty, messy, sticky miso laced sauce. Our server made sure we had plenty of bread prior to this course, and now I know why. We wanted to mop up every drop of the sauce!\\n\\nThink we were done after that? Not quite yet. Our next dish was \\n\\nRago√ªt of Local Forest Mushrooms, House-Made Rabbit Sausage, Hakurei Turnips and Romanesco \\nfarm-fresh egg, Macomber turnip pur√©e, herbs\\n \\nThis may have been my favorite part of the entire meal. A farm fresh egg makes such a huge difference. With the crisp radish, earthy mushrooms, and ooey gooey egg yolk, this dish was both rustic and elegant. \\n\\nOur final savory course was grilled pork belly with pomegranate arils and a thick apple sauce, brought to us by a server and Chef Maws. \\nTo end the night, our server brought us Olive Oil and Taza Chocolate Mousse and Long Island Cheese Pumpkin Parfait. They were both perfect, but the Taza chocolate mousse and olive oil offered an unbelievably rich and smooth treat. The pumpkin parfait offered exquisite fall flavors. I loved being able to taste the squash flavor of the pumpkin along with a little bit of sweetness. Again, perfect portions and balance of flavors. \\n\\nCraigie on Main offered such a special, delicious meal, and I can not wait to go back!"},{"name":"Pio Pio Restaurant","address":"5803 Precision Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"First time eating Columbian/Peruvian food.

Based on the restaurant's name, I was expecting a finer dining experience (ya know, it sounded French and sophisticated to me). But once inside, it was....interesting. \\n\\nThere was a menu placed high up with a limited selection of curry options with different meats such as chicken or beef. You order at the counter, food-court style, and wait for your order to be made. I selected just regular 'kale' with a baked pork cutlet for an extra $5. My friends ordered the 'kale' with beef. There appeared to only be one employee in the entire restaurant because after our orders were placed, the cashier took two other orders before he took a moment to start making our meals. I observed the process and he measured rice into a bowl, then dumped the bowl onto a plate, where the rice was then spread out thin before the curry sauce was poured. I was curious as to where this $5 cutlet was going to appear from when the employee took a few pieces out of a slow cooker-like machine. He hastily cut them into strips before placing them on the curry. Honestly, I think the worker was annoyed because he threw around utensils and closed lids to pots harshly. Whatevs. \\n\\nNow onto the food. We take our meals to the tatami mat table area in the back to dig in. Upon inspecting our food, which did smell pretty good, one friend asked if she got the beef curry? She asked because there was literally one piece of meat floating in her curry. My other friend has a few more measly pieces in hers but nonetheless their curry looked quite lacking. I shared strips of my cutlet, which were tough and void of flavor. The curry itself was unimpressive. It wasn't offensive but it also wasn't anything special. \\n\\nAs we finished our meals, we looked around the restaurant and was amused by the decor. You could tell this used to be a different restaurant in the past but was turned into a curry house by adding a few random pictures and tatami mats. I personally don't care about decorations or whatnot as long as the food is good but this was not the case. \\n\\nWe came here based off of good reviews and supposed cheap price but for $12 for my meal, it was not worth it.

Two chairs to my left sat a guy watching the soccer game on the large flatscreen, two chairs to my right sat two separate couples.

This last weekend I set out to test ride both a 2015 Felt Z85 and a 2013 Orbea Orca B105. The Felt was at Western Bikeworks and the Orbea at River City Cycles Outlet. \\n \\n \\nI ended up buying the Orbea. In the end it was a full Carbon bike for 1200$ below the original MSRP and brand new. \\n \\n \\nThe decision also was made by a few other factors and my reason for writing here. I went over to Western Bikeworks on Saturday happy to be looking at a bike I have researched for a bit and was eager to test. Walking in I was greeted and expressed my interest to look at the bike. The sales associate not only didn't pay attention to the model number but missed it the next four times it was said. I was looking at the Felt Z85 and he insisted on showing me the V85 with disc brakes and a different aesthetic. As he told me they did not have the 56cm in stock he would enter in the system and call me same day to come back and test ride. All the while about 10 ft over his head was the Z85 in 56cm. I let it go and had made up my mind at this point even if I got the Felt it would not be from Western Bikeworks. A full day after I was told I would get a call, I received a voicemail from Westernbikeworks. The same guy told me the V85 (Again wrong model) was not in stock and there would not be anymore until the 2016 model. Then ended the call. No asking me to come in and find something else or any other help. I was left with a real crap feeling after the experience. \\n \\n \\nWhat made it all better was my experience at River City Bike Outlet Store. I was greeted by someone I met the previous day when I was in looking for a booties to keep my feet dry. The guy remembers my name. He remembers the bike I was looking at. Immediately he finds the time. Gets a helmet on me and makes a quick seat adjust so I can test the bike. The whole time he is asking how things feel if there are any movements that feel wrong. Completely checking in. After the test ride I am in heaven with the bike. I tell him I want to buy the bike. He takes me outside, watches me ride for a moment and makes a few quick adjustments. Mounts water bottle cages and gives me two free water bottles. He is again checking in making sure I am happy. I can say they have earned a customer. I am so very grateful for the experience I had there. \\n \\n \\nI had two completely different experiences with two different shops and really wanted to share this. I hope you all have the same experience I did at River City on your future purchases. I will be avoiding Western Bikeworks. I am going to be sending this letter to both businesses including the names of the associates.

It was so creamy . Finally, you can't go to a restaurant without trying their version of the classic Haiwanese chicken, which we paired with garlic rice with chicken broath flavour. The chicken comes with two sauces that were perfectly seasoned and the garlic was not overpowering at all. I could really appreciate that chicken flavour in the rice.

I stopped by here with a friend for dinner, on a Saturday evening, and it was very busy. Long live the reliable American restaurant chain.\\n\\nLike other chains (e.g. Applebee's, Ruby Tuesday, T.G.I. Friday's), Chili's has an extensive menu which includes soups, salads, sandwiches, burgers, steaks, ribs, pizzas, fajitas, quesadillas, chicken, seafood, and more. It's a whole mish-mash of food. We decided to go for the \\"$20 Dinner for Two,\\" which limited our options and made the decision process easier.\\n\\nThe $20 Dinner for Two includes a choice of one appetizer and two entrees from a predetermined list. There are about a half dozen apps and over a dozen entrees to choose from. Drinks aren't included.\\n\\nI checked out the prices of the individual apps and entrees offered as part of the deal. It turns out you can save a bit of money if you take advantage of the deal as opposed to ordering each item separately. For example, we got the Tostada Chips & Salsa ($3.09), Half Rack of Baby Back Ribs ($10.19), and Grilled Chicken Fajitas ($11.89). Ordered together individually, these would cost $25.17 total. One Abe Lincoln saved.\\n\\nThe meal itself was just alright. The chips and salsa were unlimited, which was nice, except the chips weren't very good. They seemed hard and almost stale, which was surprising since the chips here are supposed to be made fresh daily. That was too bad because the salsa seemed decent.\\n\\nThe entrees fared better. I had the half rack of ribs with BBQ sauce (Memphis dry rub available too). They came with a side of fries. The ribs tasted OK, though the sauce seemed too salty. The meat was tender enough.

The cake was very light and moist from the delicious custard and overall it wasn't too sweet which was really nice. It was indeed different then the traditional cream pie and I wish they wouldn't call it that as it's kinda confusing once you taste it. Nevertheless it was really good! Probably wouldn't get it again. Now the chocolate chip cookie was stellar! Great size, plenty of high quality chocolate disks throughout that you could really taste how good the chocolate was.

It's huge, fresh looking decor, and simple seafood. Let me start by saying I love it hear and keeping coming back for one reason alone, service. Row 34 puts other restaurants in the area on notice. There are a few things I'm not thrilled about but we'll get to those a little later. \\n\\nI'll start by highlighting my last experience. I walk in (party of two) and throw my name on the wait list (45 mins). I'm a huge fan of eating at a nice bar so I immediately throw my name on the bar seating list with my favorite bartender (his name escapes me, but all restaurants with a large enough bar should do this). We order a couple drinks and my guy comes out from behind the bar to deliver them, no leaning over people, no spilling, no awkward moments, it just makes sense. We are waiting maybe 25 mins on a jam packed night before we get in at the bar. I explain that we would like a bottle of bone dry white to go with some oysters we planned on ordering. He quickly draws our attention to three bottles and recommends one in particular, of course we go for it and it is spot on. Next we want to order some oysters and I tell him the ones I've tried before and that I would like to try a few new ones and that I like them briny, again spot on with the recommendations. He's so engaged, as usual, its impossible to not ask him for a recommendation so we tell him we are leaning towards the mussels for and appetizer but we were wondering what his favorite was. Right away he says I know you guys will love the tuna crudo but order the mussels and I'll send you a sample of the crudo on the house. We are digging into our mussels and bottle of Pino Gris when the crudo comes, full order on the house. At this point we are stuffed but we order anyways. I'm seriously into fishing and I love the gamy character of a properly prepared bluefish so I know I want that right off the bat and my girlfriend orders the fish n' chips. We are just hanging out enjoying our bottle of wine, engaged in conversation when he comes over apologizing about how long the entrees are taking to come out (hasn't even been that long) and explains that we will not see them on the bill. I tell him that we are perfectly content and that is not at all necessary, but he insists. That's just the type of place Row 34 is, service and customers come first no exceptions. \\n\\nOnto complaints. The prices are high, woof. Look, we use bluefish as bait to catch tuna, they are abundant, they're local, they're easy to catch, they're easy to cook, and they're not a game fish... so $25-28 for a 5oz fillet over farva beans? Please... we can catch 40 in a couple hours. The lobster roll is $25 for 4oz on a hotdog bun, no thanks. Granted, Lobster meat + tiny bit of mayo (or butter) + hotdog bun = winning combination, but not 4oz for $25. I can't trust anyone who chooses to make or eat beer battered fish n' chips and that alone is nearly a serious enough indictment to knock them a star. Even worse, they don't indicate that the fish n' chips are beer battered on the menu. Some people would say that beer battered fish n' chips are classic New England style seafood dish, as someone who has been born and raised on the water in MA I would say that those people are idiots. There is absolutely no excuse for beer battered fish n' chips it ruins the whole profile of the meal, an unforgivable mistake. \\n\\nAll thing considered, this place is pretty awesome and you'd be doing yourself a disservice by avoiding it. Just one more thing, they only serve beer and wine. In an era of $13 craft cocktails if you can't find the talent to execute on those drinks its best to keep it simple so I respect the hell out of that model. There are too many restaurants that charge $10-14 for a \\"craft\\" cocktail and its nowhere damn near craft, if you don't have the talent don't serve it.

However, my positive review of this place ends with the diverse menu (and the fact that it's in a bookstore).\\n\\nI went to Trident tonight with a friend for dinner. I had been running around for work so I got there about an hour early and had a beer while I finished up some work and waited for my friend to join me. It was pretty empty when I walked in as it was just the beginning of the dinner hour. I walked into the main dining room and the guy behind the bar asked if he could help me. I told him that I was just trying to decide where to sit since I would be waiting for someone. He quickly told me that I should sit upstairs because it was nicer. I took the hint and wandered up.\\n\\nI sat at the bar area upstairs where there were three or four other people in the dining area. The woman working up there clearly did not want to be there. I actually heard her say to a coworker that she wanted to make money, but she really needed to finish her assignment and hoped it wouldn't be busy. She was not pleasant at all. When another patron asked what the soup was, she came over and grabbed the menu she had given to me to look it up without saying a word. She was huffing around any time a customer needed something. I was so put off I decided to pay for my beer and move downstairs for dinner. \\n\\nWhen I made my way down I was told to grab menus and seat myself. I did and my friend joined me a moment later. \\n\\nI ordered the Havarti avocado melt with no mustard. Soon after, the sandwich came out slathered in mustard.  I hated to be a complainer but it was inedible to me, so I politely asked for them to remake it without the mustard. The server apologized and told me a new one would be right out. \\n\\nNot too much time passed before the second sandwich came out without mustard. However the word melt does not apply to what I received. It was ICE COLD. The cheese, the bread, the whole thing was cold to the touch. Not sort of warm, ice cold. Inedible. I did not take even one bite it was so cold. In disbelief I made my friend touch it. I ate only the fries for dinner. Since I didn't want to wait for a third one, I gave up. \\n\\nMy server was nice about it and took it off the bill, but overall it was just a bad experience from start to finish. The kicker- when you add fries to a Havarti melt at Trident the price is about $15 for a grilled cheese!!! You would think that on the second go around they would actually try to make it correctly-and warm.\\n\\nTo top it all off, the downstairs restroom was being renovated and the upstairs women's room was flooded (or so the manager barked at me). I had to use a single stall hidden around the corner on my way out. \\n\\nPromising menu, terrible food, ok service. I feel compelled in this one to add the fact that I worked in several restaurants through high school, college, and part of grad school, so my experience has to be really bad for me to write one of these reviews. \\n\\nNot certain I would ever come back here.

The wilted kale was more like frozen spinach, and the green beans were well green beans. The goat-cheese pizza with onions and other assorted veggies was pretty good and the basil was very powerful, however it was so dry it was screaming for a nice extra virgin olive oil drizzle to punch it up.\\n\\nNot to pick on anyone in particular, but the front of the house was being run by a completely overwhelmed high school student (or around that age), that when she gave us our wait time sounded very unsure of what to say next, as in telling us 20-40mins would be perfect, and the built in uncertainty leaves the dining experience unscathed, however stuttering about 20 or 30 or 20. \\n\\nHopefully as time goes on this place will improve with experienced wait staff, and better cooks who are a bit more adventerous.

If you haven't been, it truly is a spectacular space, open kitchen right when you walk in, well lit, and overall very appealing. We hustled to get there right when they opened at 5:30 pm to make sure we could grab a table at the bar area (the only place to get the burger) and were fortunate enough to be seated immediately. We've been delegated to eating in bar area's before (see the Met Bar) but have never been treated this well. In my experience the service in the bar is never as good as the main dining area, and in the case of Radius, the service overall was borderline arrogant and snobby despite eating in the main dining room. Craigie does not mess around, as the service, and everyone we interacted with, was impeccable, very attentive, and made it feel like a special night even if we were just eating burgers, again, the polar opposite of my Radius experience.\\n   The burger was not like anything I've had all year, I wouldn't call it gourmet, but it's not your run-of-the-mill burger either. This felt special, I still can't say any burger is worth $18, but the effort is there. It's beefy, and unbelievably so, cooked to a perfect medium-rare, the cheddar fully melted and tangy, the house-made bun crispy and chewy all at the same time. The mace ketchup, again house-made, is nice, with a complementary sweetness to it, and there are so many different flavors going on, it's difficult to pick them all out. There is some serious Umami, with the miso flavor the true backbone of this burger, it really takes it to another level. It's easily the best tasting burger I've had in a while. It's not a perfect plate, however, as it comes with shoestring fries, which as I've written before are not my preference. I never know how to eat them, if you use your hands it's nearly impossible to dip in to ketchup, otherwise your using a fork to eat fries and feel like a fool. And there is some seasoning on the fries that I don't love, not quite spicy, but assertive, I much rather just see some regular fries. But unlike most shoestrings, these are fried perfectly and are utterly crispy. The fennel slaw on the side also adds a much needed refreshment component to the meal.\\n    Craigie on Main easily delivers the beefiest, juiciest burger of the year, and although it's become a hot destination for burger lovers alike to come to, it's still a process. You need to come early to guarantee a seat, and for two burgers and one beer plus tip, it costs nearly $30 per person.

Antico is the closest that I have been to true authentic Italian pizza since I was actually in Italy a few years ago.\\n\\nMy journey to Antico has been built up for years.  Since the day I moved here over three years ago, I have heard of this place.  THE best pizza in Atlanta, so they said.  Tucked away, a little gem off of 14th Street near Howell Mill in Midtown.  Right in the heart of Atlanta, but somehow it took me over three years to get there.\\n\\nThe hole-in-the-wall pizza joint is part of a quaint little area fittingly dubbed \\"Little Italia\\" corner of real deal Italian eateries centered around the little corner on Ethel Street.  Parking is a little bit challenging as the place has obviously become an Atlanta foodie legend over the years.  They have a little lot behind the restaurant, but that was all filled up when we pulled up around 7:30pm on a Tuesday evening.  We ended up doing a parallel parking job on a little side street across from the McDonald's.\\n\\nWhen you step up and through the doors of the unassuming little home turned pizza joint, your nostrils are greeted with the pleasant aroma of garlic and tomato and floury dough.  My head and my heart and my tummy all agreed in that moment: I was in the right place.  As soon as you walk in, there is a big glass window that separates the entry way from a dining room with a long table of hungry and oh-so-happy patrons.  So this is the communal table dining I had heard about!  How adorable, I thought.  But this was only the beginning.  \\n\\nWe placed our order for a pie to go up at the counter, settling on the verdura (broccoli, tomato, mushroom, garlic, cheese).  There are no sides to be had - no silly garlic knots, no salad distractions.  It's all about the pizza (though there are a few calzones on the menu if you want to spice things up).  They have a refrigerator with sodas, waters, Pellegrinos, wine, and Peronis.  You can buy beer and wine on site or opt to bring your own.  Be warned - you cannot \\"mix and match\\" and do half with meat or other customized combinations.  No slice either - just whole pies that can feed about 2-3 people.  They do what they do so well that I can forgive them for being stuck in their ways.  I actually respect that they stick to the true recipes as they are. \\n\\nThe classic black and white menu above the cash register lists out the pies in US dollars and Euros.  Real deal, I tell ya.  The ingredients for each pie are in Italian, but it isn't too difficult to decipher since most of the pizzas are simple and straightforward with toppings like fresh cheeses, garlic, basil, and tomato.  It sounds easy as pie (pardon the pun), but these pizza masters are not churning out your run-of-the-mill pizza pies.  Don't believe it?  Step right up and watch these pizza pros work their magic.\\n\\nWe wandered into the back area that I assumed was just a kitchen, but I was very wrong.  Here I came to learn what the real communal dining experience is that I had heard so much about.  There are 6 or 7 long tables, about the size of the one in the little dining area by the window in the front of the place.  And of course every seat was filled.  The dining area was separated from the kitchen by a counter with napkins and such.  And my, what a kitchen it is.  The pizza chefs are hard at work, spinning dough and artfully placing the ridiculously fresh toppings onto each pie.  \\n\\nThere are three large pizza ovens, and boy do they get a lot of action.  These guys are moving those pies in and out with grace and skill.  When I was there, they were even kind enough to let a small group of tourists pop behind the counter for a photo op with the pizza gear.  They have boxes piled up along the wall for customers to take home their leftovers.  No way you want to leave a crumb behind.\\n\\nAll I could do was stand in awe as I took it all in.  The dining room and kitchen are not fancy by any means.  It looks a bit like a cafeteria hall, and it is a bit noisy/chaotic with hungry customers scrambling for spots at the table.  But this place needs no frills - it's all about the epic pizza pie production and consumption.\\n\\nLet me tell you: biting into that delicious pizza may have been long overdue, but it was well worth the wait.  The mushrooms were succulent, the cheese was just the right amount of gooey, the tomatoes were juicy, the broccolini was tenderly flavorful, and the dough was utterly perfect with it's not too crispy but just browned enough floury foundation.  Cue the salivation.\\n\\nWe opted for the takeout option, but I will be making a return trip in the near future for the full on family dining, BYOB experience.  So real, so fresh, so unique.

I only got chicken. I chose this dish specially because it came with both.  Looking back at the ordering interface, the default it chicken only and you have to change the protein to chicken + shrimp. This should have been the default. Portion size was adequate, noodles were cooked just right and everything tasted fresh, but the dish didn't have any flavor. I found myself wishing for a packet of soy or fish sauce (I never do that). Also the sauce was like broth in consistency which I thought was odd. At other places it's thicker. \\n\\n\\nSpicy Basil w/ Grilled Salmon -- Again, online ordering messed me up. None of the dishes come with rice, says so on the menu.

In the app, the breadsticks are supposed to come with marinara or ranch but there isn't an option to chose when ordering. While on the phone with the guy, he tells me it comes with tomato oil. (Not in the description). The guy says he will get this $40 order to me in 45 mins. At 2:15, I called back. I have a house full of hungry people. The guy says he cancelled my order! WHY? \\"Because my guy never showed up and I am by myself.\\" He never called, he never refunded my money. Really? Why take the order? Why have a delivery service if he has to cancel orders? What a cluster this place is. By some of the reviews, the owner never comes in and this guy just randomly cancels $40 orders. I was willing to give them a chance but now, without ever even tasting their food--I will never order again. I called back and asked for the owner, a different guy answers (I guess he showed up) and when I asked for the owner's name. He asked why. Because I had a complaint. He hung up.

The manager was right there when we saw the mouse & reported it & simply shrugged. While perhaps it's common to have rodents in Boston restaurants due to the oldness of the buildings, the managers reaction was quite unsatisfactory. Not even a simple courteous apology on the restaurants behalf. It did disrupt our meal, and belittled our feelings.

I totaled how much we have spent on orders from PZA - and my husband and I have spent more than EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS on delivery from their restaurant in the last year. But.... I think we have finally reached the point where we can no longer order from them, and it makes me sad because we really love their food and I used to recommend them to local friends all of the time.\\n\\nTheir delivery service has just gotten worse and worse as time has gone on. A few times in the past, our delivery has taken far longer than the anticipated time... but it usually has still come within an hour to an hour and 15 minutes (so we let it slide). We have also had issues with our order not being 100% correct, and we have dealt with that on a case by case basis (again, we let it slide and continue to order from them). We have given them a pass many, many times in the past - we are probably more patient than many customers would be - but we have finally hit the limit on what we can reasonably tolerate.\\n\\nWe recently ordered dinner on a Friday night, and I got an email that the order was confirmed and would take an estimated 40-50 minutes to be delivered. An hour and 15 minutes later, the food had still not arrived. We tried calling the restaurant - and upon calling them, their phone went straight to voicemail, with a message saying the \\"mailbox was full.\\" Um, what? In addition to calling the number on their website, we also found two other possible numbers for them, and tried those - same message, same results. We continued to try calling the restaurant every few minutes for the next half hour, and it still kept going straight to voicemail. At this point, we were forced to give up and order food from another establishment, since we were starving and frustrated and had no clue what was going on. \\n\\nA full TWO AND A HALF HOURS after we initially placed our order, I got a phone call from PZA saying that our order was ready, and the gentleman on the phone asked if we were \\"still interested\\" in the food? I told him we were not, and he said he \\"understood\\" and hung up. My husband called the restaurant back a minute later to ask them what had happened (because HE was so frustrated) - the woman he spoke with simply said \\"I am sorry, we just got really busy,\\" asked if we still wanted the food that was sitting there, and really didn't seem to care very much about how unhappy we were with the experience. My husband asked them what had happened with their phones (and told her we had been trying to call and it kept going to voicemail) and she just said \\"yeah, we were having an issue with the phones.\\" Um.\\n\\nLook.... with a very rare exception (like Super Bowl Sunday or something), it should NEVER take more than 2 hours for food to be delivered, even if it is a Friday night. And a customer should never be unable to contact the restaurant directly. If you can't handle an uptick in your restaurant's business on a Friday night - so much so that it takes over 2 hours for an order just to be cooked and ready to be delivered- you maybe need to hire more staff, or find a more successful way of operating. It's just unacceptable, and I am disappointed that I have to write this review because we really have loved their food."},{"name":"The Dogwood","address":"11420 Rock Rose, Ste 130","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"Dogwood is the type of bar you would find in the Gaslamp in San Diego.

I got back to work only to discover they gave me maybe 3/4 cup of broth, a small bundle of plastic wrap containing about the same amount of noddles, a sprig of cilantro, one lime wedge and some raw shallots with two pieces of pickled cabbage and gritty chili oil. $15.75 for mostly air.\\n\\nThe broth was mediocre, what little there was, I've had better at a chain restaurant. While ordering, I was very clear with the server that I hate mushrooms, they were not listed in the ingredients yet most of the soups measly contents were mushrooms. They were gracious enough to throw in 4 pieces of tofu. \\n\\nOverall, this was a huge waste of time and money. The best way to never see a customer again is to make them feel stupid for even walking in the door, that's exactly how I feel after eating here.

Very lovely and modern looking restaurant. I really liked that for their High Tea set menu, you have the option in getting coffee instead of tea. Usually High Tea comes with just tea but I liked the idea of having coffee as an alternative (Just a FYI, tea is the only one that you can get re-fill on). My friend got a passion fruit iced tea while one of her friends got a rose tea and the other had an macchiato. I, on the other hand, had an earl grey tea. Their tea pot set was so beautiful because they used China tea sets. \\n\\n(I will start off with the savory items first)\\n\\nSavory:\\nChou au Foie Gras et a la Truffle (choux pastry with foie gras) - This was super cute and tiny. The pastry was light and airy, and since the foie gras was mixed with the truffle mousse, it was surprisingly light and creamy. If you aren't a fan of foie gras like me, you would like this because it didn't had that weird after taste and it wasn't too strong. It had the consistency of eating butter. (4/5)\\n\\nTarte Forestiere (mushroom tart) - This was my favorite savory item because the tart shell was made from pate sucree (a sweet French pastry crust) which was buttery and crunchy. Also, the mushroom filling was flavorful and savory. (5/5)\\n\\nSandwiche au Saumon Sockeye (smoked salmon sandwich) - I liked this one because I love eating smoke salmon, and the salmon was tender, tasty and not too salty. It paired really nicely with the creme fraiche. (4/5)\\n\\nCanard et Poire Pochee au Thym (seared duck breast with poached pear) - This was my least favorite one because I am not a huge fan of duck and I found it a bit too salty (just another FYI, if you really like duck, you might get disappointed because it was super tiny). (2/5)\\n\\nScone au Beurre (butter scone) - This was alright. It was served with butter and honey instead of Devonshire cream and jam. I found the scone quite dry and bland but maybe it was because I didn't eat it until the next day and I didn't had the butter and honey. On the other hand, I had scones before during High Tea where I didn't eat it with the cream and jam, and the scone was perfectly crumbly and delicious. (3/5)\\n\\nSweet: \\nCoeur Noir (dark chocolate cake with chocolate mousse) - The taste of this was good because it was chocolaty but not too rich. I really liked the raspberry jelly within the hazelnut crunch because it provided a sweet and tarty flavor, and it was also a nice surprise when you take a bite of it as a whole. As for the hazelnut crunch, it was a bit of a disappointment because there was no crunch to it. It would of been nice to have some crunch to it to enhance the experiment and provide more texture to the cake since everything else was tender and smooth. Also, I wished it was bigger because it was too tiny. (3.5/5)\\n\\nGateau Opera (opera cake) - This was my favorite dessert item because it had all the flavors that I love like almond, chocolate and coffee. The cake was moist and tasty, and the tiers were evenly portioned so you would get a balance of everything. The only thing I would change would be to soak the almond cake with coffee syrup to enhance the coffee flavor because it was pretty faint. (4.5/5)\\n\\nTartelette a la Pistache (pistachio tart) - This was also really good because it was made from the same crust as the mushroom tart. It was filled with this pistachio pastry cream which was creamy and light, and you could taste hints of pistachio. (4/5)\\n\\nGateau Abeille (honey cake) - This was light and refreshing but I didn't love it (I prefer heavier and richer cakes that are made with chocolate  and coffee). You could taste the honey within the mousse but it wasn't too sweet. This cake had many different soft textures which it was missing that crunch element like the \\"almond brittle\\" but I couldn't taste any. (3.5/5)\\n\\nBiscuit Sable a la Cardamome (sable shortbread with cardamom) - This was pretty tasty. The shortbread with soft and crumbly, and the cardamom was prominent but not over powering. I just wasn't too fond of the extra sugar added along the edges of the cookie because it made it too sweet. (3.5/5)\\n\\nMatcha Macaron - This wasn't bad. The edges were crispy, and the cookie itself was tender and slightly chewy. The filling was light and creamy but it was lacking a lot of matcha flavor. All I could taste was the almond flour within the cookie and cream. (3.5/5) \\n\\nOverall, staff was super inviting and friendly. I wouldn't mind coming back here for their lunch and dinner but not for their High Tea. I found their savory items were way too small for the price we paid and that it didn't help that there were less savory items than sweet. Also, I was disappointed with their scones because they were mediocre, and I had scones before at other High Tea places where they were super delicious. I would of thought that during your High Tea experience, scones should be amazing."},{"name":"Pure Taqueria","address":"300 N Highland Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"Great atmosphere and food!

I have recently started staying one night a week in Orlando, for work.  Let me start by saying the food was delicious-both times. I LOVE Indian food, and have been eating itall my life- in Europe, in Africa and in India! My beef is with the service. Last week I thought the waiter was a tad standoffish. He seated me, poured water and then took my order in silence except for a curt question about how spicy I wanted my dish. The same with the delivery to my table of my naan and paneer makhni. I had to ask him for a refill of water, and for takeaway containers which he plunked down in front of me-again silently and almost as if he were annoyed. Nevertheless, I tipped my 20% and was grateful for the good meal I had just consumed, and the fact that there was plenty for another meal the next day. Today, I was seated by a more pleasant gentleman ( he actually spoke). Then, Mr. surly arrived to serve me. This time, he neglected to ask me how spicy I wanted the dish, then again put it out in front go me without a word. I noticed that there was no serving spoon for the rice. I tried to get his attention, but he seemed more focused on the table ( a couple) that had just been seated. I ate my meal ( enjoying the food immensely) then decided it was time to speak up. I caught the attention of the more pleasant waiter and registered my concerns about the service I had received. He apologized. Not a peep out of Mr. surly. After I finished my meal, I literally had to wait 10-15 minutes for them to realize I was done. Mr. surly studiously avoided my table. As the takeout containers were placed before me, the hitherto pleasant waiter literally snatched up the condiment dish as if he were guarding diamonds. I got the check, left my 20% tip ( good karma) and left. Maybe it's because I'm a woman, maybe because I'm single, but I think the waiter had other serious issues and was projecting his mal assumptions on me. The food might be good, but with the malevolence of the staff, it couldn't be good for my overall wellbeing. As a physician, I'm all about the quality of service ( be it healthcare or otherwise).

So my father opted to order a strawberry lemonade as well after placing our main entrees and my brother realized his coke was flat.\\n\\nRight now, my father is still waiting on his soup; I re-ordered the lemon for my mother that has yet to arrive; and a table next to ours had gotten all honey wheat bread as well as their meal when we had gotten in 15 minutes before them (maybe that's me also being a bit bitter).\\n\\nSitting in the dining area, I'm trying to remain optimistic that maybe there are hiccups within the kitchen and the rest of the dining staff, but it doesn't make much sense to me seeing as though there are also several open tables and that more than 30 minutes have already elapsed where I'm not presented with a meal and that there are still appetizer plates and an empty bread bowl that hadn't been taken away.\\n\\nMaybe about ~5-7 minutes after I finished writing my last statement the food came out and the waitress had a surprised look on her face when my father asked about his soup and she ran back to get it saying it was on its way. When she came back, we asked for a third time about the lemon, but said it was for the entree of a pan seared salmon and the Asian taco lettuce wraps. I ordered farfalle where bacon bits were burnt and it seemed as though the tomatoes were raw and simply cut and thrown into the dish. Then my brother's jambalaya pasta was drenched with a watery sauce.\\n\\nAfter ordering dessert, service improved, but by that point, I've already made my opinion on this location of the establishment. This is my typical go-to restaurant in an area I'm not familiar with and the result of this was very disappointing."},{"name":"Atlanta Breakfast Club","address":"249 Ivan Allen Jr Blvd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Delicious food for a great price!

The menu has Taiwanese appies like spicy cucumbers and seaweed but the main dish are their soupy noodles.\\n\\nThere is a very instagram version where they present different ingredients in small bowls then your job is to put them into the hot noodle soup and let it cook. I feel like you're supposed to let some items cook first before others but I often see people just throw everything into the pot and call it a day. \\n\\nRegardless, I prefer the pre-made bowls (generally $4 cheaper) because they still have similar items. The noodle bowls come with your choice of protein, chicken soup, noodles and topped with veggies, black fungus, enoki mushrooms, bean sprouts, bean curd, and quail egg. The soup is piping hot and stays hot pretty much throughout the entire meal due to the iron pot, which is great for people who take time to eat (like me!). Before you eat, you have a chance to pick up some extra toppings from a table near the door like fresh garlic, cilantro, soy sauce, chili oil and a few more.

I think there are 65 total and counting, but not all are breweries or have lodgings nor do all the lodgings have soaking pools.  Just a block away from Powell's, the McMenamims Crystal Hotel is conveniently located and central to so much of downtown.  It is at one edge of the Pearl District and we easily walked to Andina for dinner and planned to go to Tasty N Alder only a couple blocks away the next morning for breakfast but ran out of time.  The McMenamin brothers were smart to build a soaking pool in this location, as it is the perfect place to relax after a day of shopping -- I mean walking -- all day, and great for warming up especially on a cold evening.  The \\"pool\\" is just a few feet deep, but its dim lighting, freeform design and bamboo walls are enchanting.  Not quite a jacuzzi, but warm and steamy and comfortable.\\n\\nAs for the hotel rooms, they are all eclectic and interesting with different themes.  In general, the McMenamins look and feel is vintage and hipster art, and the theme is all about having fun and drinking with friends.  If you need a private bathroom, definitely choose one of the king rooms.  With regard to the climate control system, read the little manual inside the bedside drawer.  Once you read what the symbols mean, you can get it working no problem.  The main issue I had was the dim lighting in the room, and not being able to adjust this.  Forget about reading unless you have a Kindle or book light.  There were a few other minor issues:  the staff answer every phone call and don't put the callers on hold to finish with the customers who are at the front desk.  So this made our check-in longer than it needed to be, and I suspect is the reason why they forgot to put the extra items in the room that I had reserved ahead of time, and why there were some incorrect charges on my bill that I found when checking out.  If they could improve on the comfort level of the room (firmer beds, better lighting) and focus more on the folks who are actually on site, my rating would easily be 4 stars.\\n\\nOne more note about the the Crystal:  for nearby entertainment there is a decent restaurant on location, Al's Den -- an intimate venue for live bands, and the Crystal Ballroom down the street with regular performances by bands and artists (tickets can be purchased online)."},{"name":"Raglan Road Irish Pub","address":"1640 E Buena Vista Dr","city":"Lake Buena Vista","stars":"4","text":"Raglan Road was hands down the best place we ate while at Disney. \\n\\nThere are many themed dining establishments all around Disney, and we ate at quite a few of them, but Raglan seemed to be somewhat of a perfect storm.

The pizza is definitely pretty big so I would bring a friend to help eat all of it. I really don't think you can go wrong with other options here. Though I hope to come back and try the white sauce options. My pizza was excellently cooked with a nice charring around the edges. The entire pie tasted very fresh, the cheese was great as well. I really don't have too much to say about the pizza, it speaks for itself.\\n\\nI love the classic atmosphere of sitting in a warehouse-like setting and seeing the pizza be made in front of you! The place is very picnic style, with a few long tables spread around the area. They have a small bar filled with different topping options, such as extra parmesan or olive oil.\\n\\nSince it was my first time, I didn't know to order bottled water instead of asking for regular water service, which is a pretty ratchet sink near the back of the restaurant.

It was our first visit to this relatively new establishment and it was a good one!\\n\\nMy wife and I arrived first, found a 4 top table and soon we each had a drink in front of us, she went with the Long Island Shake up and I had a beer, the Seventh Son American Strong Ale to be exact. We asked our waitress a few questions about the menu options and then ordered some appetizers, The Soft Pretzel and the Deviled Egg Dip. We liked the pretzel more than the deviled egg, which was a little disappointing.\\n\\nWe saved some food for our friends, who arrived a few minutes later. They promptly had drinks in front of them and as they munched on the starters we ordered, added an order for the Cincinnati Poutine, which if you have not heard, is tator tots with chili, onions and cheese on top. We were actually surprised by how good this was and how fast it went away.\\n\\nFor our dinner, my wife ordered three tacos, the Pollo, the Carnitas and the Barbacoa.

My friends and I went to Escobar's for New Year day brunch. When we entered we were greeted with a smile and were told that the table near the front door is the only table available to seat 3. My friends and I decided that we would rather sit away from the front door and asked to sit at the bar. Once seated at the bar, the bartender greeted us and asked if we would like anything to drink. I asked for water, one of my friends asked for a Bellini and my other friend asked for a coke. The bartender returned with my water, my friend's coke and told my other friend they didn't have the \\"wine\\" needed to make the Bellini. Wine? In what world is wine used to make Bellini's? Anyway, my friend decided to get the \\"defendant\\" instead. \\n\\nAfter taking our drink order, the bartender(LuLu) asked if we were ready to order brunch. One of my friends ordered the \\"red velvet\\" chicken and waffles ( we observed the waffle being made in a small hallway outside of the kitchen), my other friend and I wanted the \\"Escobar breakfast\\" which came with steak, eggs and potatoes. My friend and I are both pescaterians so we asked the bartender if we could substitute the steak and eggs for salmon and egg whites. The bartender stated yes at first and then returned and stated they didn't have any salmon (although it's on the menu), so my friend and I opted for shrimp instead. After waiting over 20 minutes the bartender came to use and stated that they didn't have egg whites because the eggs are pre-made. Frustrated and angry at this point we asked to see the menu again with hopes of finally being able to order something off the menu. \\n\\nWe both asked to order the Cesar salad and added shrimp for an additional $6 off the brunch menu. The bartender stated to us, \\"we really don't serve salads right now but, I'll make it work.\\" While waiting for our Cesar salad with shrimp we noticed another waitress leaving the kitchen area with a salmon salad for another table. I immediately called over the bartender and asked about the  salmon we saw headed to another table. The bartender's response was *drumroll* \\"oh, girl I can only tell you what they tell me\\" and walked off. 45 minutes later, the bartender appeared with our Cesar salad that had four shrimps and tomatoes. In what world are tomatoes included in a Cesar salad? What world? \\n\\nNow my friend and I are eating our Cesar \\"tomato\\" salad with our four shrimps. The shrimps tasted like hotdogs from the street guy on fifth Ave in NYC (STRAIGHT NASTY). 30 minutes after finishing our meals the bartender comes over with our checks. I noticed that there was gratuity added to my bill. I called the bartender over and asked her why was gratuity added and she stated gratuity is automatic. I kindly asked the bartender to remove the gratuity because my experience was horrible. \\n\\nNot to mention, through out entire experience, the owner, snoop sat directly across from us and witness everything that happened. Before leaving I asked snoop for a moment of her time to share my experience with her. She asked me if it was a good or bad experience. I shared that it was a bad experience and she said she would get the manger to speak with me. Ummmm...what? Snoop, you are the owner. What do you mean you will get the manager? Needless to say Snoop (the owner) never got the manger and left through the back door! \\n\\nI WILL NEVER EVER RECOMMEND ESCOBAR TO ANYONE THAT I KNOW. I WILL ALSO WRITE MY EXPERIENCE ON MY BLOG! \\n\\nThe service at Escobar is horrible, starting with the owner all the way down to the cook. \\n\\nIf I had to choose between spending my money at Escobar and a regular no name restaurant.

Don't let the long line fool you. I mean, it's good food, but not. worth. the. wait. for so many reasons. \\n\\n1) It's really just your average Italian food. If you've never had REALLY GOOD Italian meals, ya okay you might think otherwise, but like, come on - not even homemade pasta? \\n\\nWe ordered shrimp linguini with Fra Diavolo; scallop scampi; and fettuccini with salmon & sundried tomatoes in a lobster based tomato cream sauce. Personally I'm not into seafood sauce AT ALL so I won't give out my biased opinion on that (p.s. This place has NO meat sauce...or meatballs if that's the kind of pasta your soul craves). Scampi was good, but again nowhere close to amazing or worth the 30 minute wait. \\n\\nBread was okay, served with basic, regular olive oil. I really liked the calamari - it was fresh out of fryer and kind of melted in your mouth (so if you're all about CRISPY calamari, stay away). Also, I don't think the prices are super insane for seafood meals, but still, good enough food, not amazing.\\n\\n2) ONE particularly rude server. Okay, I don't yell at servers because that's just freakin' rude so I don't think it's too much to expect to NOT get yelled by servers. The older male server asked if we wanted appetizers, we initially said no. By the time we picked our meals, my friend changed her mind and wanted an appetizer so after ordering our dinners, I politely asked \\"we would also like an appetizer actually...\\" but before I could even finish my sentence, the server literally SCREAMED at me, \\"I ASKED YOU FIRST TIME AND YOU SAID NO, SO FORGET IT\\" and walked away. Dude, UNACCEPTABLE. It wasn't a joke. It was hostile and honestly scared me a bit. Don't tell me it's an Italian thing - I've lived in Italy, talked to older Italian men, and been served by Italian waiters. The three of us were absolutely baffled and I can't remember the last time anyone (sober) treated me that way.

The only problem was that I live 1.25 miles away & by the time I got home the center of the crust was a bit soggy. This was easily remedied by putting it on a baking rack & popping it in the oven  (425 deg) for a few minutes & I was back to crispy perfection.

Every individual on staff, from the door to the host stand to the servers and bartenders, were so friendly and warm to us. Secondly, the space itself is beautiful and I love that everyone got a lei upon walking in; the ambiance really works here. And third, and most important, the food and drinks were delicious. We ordered two pupu platters and they were perfect for sharing. I got the ribs and they were fall-of-the-bone and so good. The rum barrel was everything I had hoped it would be (and needed as I ushered in my 30th).

They smoke their meats in a signature indoor pit and have several other smokehouses on the property. I really recommend going on a weekday because during the weekend, this place requires police to direct traffic. Located on a ranch in Driftwood, Texas just outside of Austin, the meats you'll taste here are like no other. Really it's the absolute best BBQ I've ever tasted. While it's not a fancy place--just down home atmosphere with awesome food, you will not regret making the journey out to the Salt Lick. You can sit outside or inside the restaurant. Inside, there's a casual varnished picnic table seating and an impressive selection of meats and you must try the different ones. I got the brisket, sausage links and ribs. Simply AH-MAZING! What a heaven in my carnivore mouth experience. I also tried their cobblers-- both the peach and the berry. I thought I'd love the berry but oh my! What a surprise! The peach cobbler edged out the berry one. The bread they serve is soft and fluffy and buttery goodness. Don't be on a diet when you come here! This place is definitely a place to indulge. We made the 1 1/2 hour trip from San Antonio just to come here for lunch--WORTH IT!! Bring cash because it's a cash only place but it does have an atm on the property. Don't believe the haters who review this place based on the airport location lol :D Obviously they didn't make the effort to get down to Driftwood and try the real deal!

Twenty minutes later, we were still standing at the door, and two parties with 11:30 reservations who checked in after we did were seated before us.

And we did.\\n\\nApart from that, though, everything about this place was amazing! I had the tajine, and he had the steak and eggs. My tajine: spicy sausage, tomato stew, and poached eggs with a side of fried pita chips and hummus. I enjoyed each and every single mouthful of the combination of flavors in the tajine. The hotness and saltiness of the sausage rising above the pleasant acidity of the tomato sauce, accompanied by a perfectly runny yolk? I'm all about that bass! The hummus was too sweet for my taste, but I enjoyed dipping the pita chips in my bowl of tajine. \\n\\nThe steak and eggs: a 6 oz. steak, two fried eggs, cornbread, and chimichurri! First of all, anything with chimichurri is always a winner in my book, but this plate was so beautifully executed as a whole. The steak was so tender and juicy, and the cornbread -- though not the traditional cornbread you might expect -- was a nice touch. I will order this dish myself the next time I come.\\n\\nAfter our main brunch plates, we ordered two waffles with the pistachio and bacon caramel dipping sauces. Yes, BACON CARAMEL.

Truthfully, I think it wavers between a 3-4. Below are my reasons why.\\n\\nThe BAD --\\nFood portion: The food portions are wildly different depending on what you order. If you get biryani, you can feed 3-5 people with one plate. If you get curry, you might not be completely full at the end. \\n\\nNaan: We tried their naan basket and it all lacked flavor. The onion naan was really bad, as it had so much barely cooked and not seasoned white onion pieces on it. Also, it's extremely thin. I prefer my naan to be on the pizza crust side of thickness. \\n\\nWaitstaff: Although very nice, they seem very new to waiting tables. We have always gotten through our meal without any major faux pas, but it has not been without some awkwardness. \\n\\nThe GOOD --\\nFood: I have enjoyed every entree I've ordered here. I think their spice levels are on points and the food is well  cooked. I especially like the vegetable biryani. \\n\\nAtmosphere: It's a small place, but cozy and low key. I like that I don't feel like I need to get dressed up to go eat Indian food, unlike at Clay Pit or Bombay Bistro.\\n\\nGenerally, the good outweighs the bad. I do really like their food, with the exception of the naan. Thanks the proximity to the street behind it, there is usually parking to be found close by.

While waiting for our table at the bar we shared the Snacks for the Table. I wasn't sure what to think of a creamy swordfish dip, but it was exceptional.  The crisp that accompanied the dip was just bitter enough to balance the creaminess of the concoction. The other snacks were equally delightful. For dinner my friend and I shared the Garden Feast.  This was our the best decision of the evening. First our server delivered a dish of broccoli heads that were wonderfully charred on the tips and topped with a hot pink borscht and chopped nuts. It was exquisite! I can't wait to have it again. The broccoli came with 3 sides a risotto that was so creamy and the ideal compliment for a cold and rainy night. Another of the sides was a baked sweet potato with mushroom bacon which was just as good if not better than the real thing. Lastly we had some chickpeas and possibly other beans that were made into a lovely bean soup.  Everyone must try this restaurant out. I would suggest making a reservation. That was the only thing that wasn't perfect about this spot. I think we waited 2 hours for a table. I hate to say this, but our meal was worth the wait.

My favorite item is the Zinger's flatbread; the hot sauce is great. The calamari is actually also very good. You can't go wrong with most of the burgers and sandwiches. And the daily specials are usually good. Plenty of TVs - you certainly won't miss a game, if that's what you came for.

I chatted with the pit master at The Salt Lick as I watched the smoking meat. Brisket cooks about 24 hours. Sausage smokes all day from early morning. Ribs get cooked for about 4 hours. Turkey gets brined so it doesn't dry out. \\n\\nNow if I want amazing barbecue again, I have to return to Texas! At home in San Diego I'm an omnivore or even a veggie, but in Texas I became a carnivore!\\n\\nOur server, Marisol, was cheerful and very helpful. Based on my preferences, she said she'd bring me well marbled brisket and burnt ends or burnt tips, and pork ribs. I had the Combo plate for $13.95. For some reason my ribs were even bigger than the ribs that my hubs was served. After devouring my juicy and deeply BBQ'd burnt tips, I'm truly madly deeply in love with the pit master! \\n\\nOur sides at The Salt Lick were acceptable but just ok. I had taro salad, pickles, onions, bread, and beans. If you want great sides, I can recommend Ruby's Barbeque and Catering on W 29th street in Austin. But for well-marbled succulent brisket with burnt ends and pork ribs, I award 5 stars to The Salt Lick in Driftwood, Texas.\\n\\nThe friendly and very helpful staff really made my visit memorable, and those burnt tips were the best BBQ I've ever had anywhere.

The fettucini-like noodles had seaweed in the dough, and it was amazing. I could eat that forever. It managed to be both bright and buttery at the same time, super briny and crabby, seafood lovers need to get this one.\\n\\nMy roommate had the dan dan noodles with pork, very bold flavor and nice and spicy. The noodles were more of a ramen style. I can still taste it as I type this.\\n\\nCocktails were pretty good, I had a pimm's cup with a korean bent, I wouldn't kick it out of bed.\\n\\nService was impeccable, especially for their opening night.\\n\\nThe space was super cool, loved the eclectic industrial vibe and the boomboxes on the wall, also the mural is awesome. The bar is the center piece and continues straight from the kitchen, kind of a cool design. Overall the place is a bit tight but they did very well with the space they're working with. Interestingly enough the walls on the north side are mesh that are open to the boardshop (EVO) next door. True to their claim, they were blasting hip hop pretty loudly.\\n\\nPrice was a bit high for the amount of food but that's becoming the norm in these parts :/\\n\\nWill definitely go back again soon and update my review after they've had some time to get the flow of things down."},{"name":"Atlanta Breakfast Club","address":"249 Ivan Allen Jr Blvd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"It's small a little cramped but the service and the food were both excellent.

My friend got this amazing pile of lobster and deliciousness and a definite recommend if you're feeling lobster.\\n\\nThe Inari roll was very simple. Far more simple than the rock & roll, but had that sweetness that I was craving from the tofu. The lobster roll was no holds back on a respectable mound of lobster flesh, and really moist... and just stupid good. I also really liked my two rolls too. They were simple, yet, well, effective and quite good.\\n\\nOur server was really nice too, she even tried her best to assure my friend the mayo used for the lobster roll wasn't overbearing and generally was pretty helpful.\\n\\nDespite my reserved and spend savvy options, I'd like to come back and try a lot more of their menu!~ Thanks for staving off my slight fried tofu cravings!"},{"name":"Famas Pizza and Pasta","address":"5474 Central Florida Pkwy","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Went this Italian Restaraunt tonight while visiting zOrlando.The service was great.Everyone was so friendly.The food was the best.Everything made from scratch.Absolutely delicious.This is a family run business.Give it a try while in the zOrlando area.You won't regret it."},{"name":"Chipotle Mexican Grill","address":"274 Elm St","city":"Somerville","stars":"3.5","text":"I had never had a bad Chipotle experience - until this time - and I have been going for years.

Hands down the place needs to be renovated. The wait was pretty short 10-15 minutes. Went by quickly. Although, it was quite cold as there is not really any indoor waiting. They should tent the walkway during the winter. Parking was pretty easy to come by, but I could see how it might get pretty tight during the high time. \\n\\nIf I was dining out on a budget, this place is the spot, but not the best place when looking for vegan or vegetarian options.

Upon arrival, we walked up to the counter and placed our order. There were several options for Neapolitan pizzas, calzones, and salads, as well as wine, beer, and fun San Pellegrino flavors. Some of the reviews said BYOB, but I believe these might be outdated as they did have wine and beer. We were dining in, so it was important to pay attention to the number on our ticket. We made our way into the dinning room. There were several options for communal seating (high tops, traditional \\"picnic\\" tables, and standing tables). As we waited, we were entertained watching the staff hard at work (mixing sauce, tossing dough, and placing the pies in the traditional ovens) and listening to upbeat Italian music. \\n\\nIt wasn't long until our number was called and a large 14-inch pizza was delivered on an over-sized cookie sheet. It was exactly as I had hoped and looked AND tasted like traditional Italian pizza, only bigger - in Italy the pies are made for one person, but here my spouse and I split a pie and still had half for a doggy bag. I loved the accessory/condiment bar - olive oil, peppers, freshly grated cheese, and fresh basil - all wonderful accompaniments to the pizzas. We ordered the Diavola and it was simply delicious - spicy, for those who appreciate the heat. \\n\\nAntico was a fabulous find nestled in a super cute Atlanta neighborhood.

Bangkok Thai is tucked away in the slightly sketchy part of Ansley Mall, near the nightclubs and bars that have blacked out windows and parking lots that are mysteriously full 24/7.  However, Bangkok Thai is cute and clean inside, with plenty of tables to dine in. There are even a few reserved parking spaces outside to make it easy to visit this place amidst its busy neighbors.\\n\\nWe started with spring rolls and coconut chicken soup, which were tasty and unremarkable - they hit the spot and nothing more.  For dinner, we got double orders of Pad Thai, which was flavorful and meaty, with generous portions of chicken and grilled shrimp.  Most Thai places offer a choice of proteins in this dish; I liked that at Bangkok it comes with both.  We also shared a green papaya salad that was loaded with ground pork and very flavorful.  It was a slightly spicy dish, but the complexity of seasonings was not overwhelmed by pure chilli.  It exceeded expectations!\\n\\nWe ate in, and the service was slow, but more in a way that they weren't trying to rush us, rather than they were forgetting us.  I can appreciate that!\\n\\nThe low prices were the best surprise.  Eating in, most of the entree dishes were around $12-13.  For take-out Thai food, I feel like I'm used to paying around $15/entree.  While this is certainly not the best Thai in Atlanta, it's solid and satisfies my Thai craving.

As avid beer lovers (my husband considers himself quite the beer aficionado), we were starstruck over their incredible beer list. We joyously ordered a bunch of rare bottles and shared. Our server was very friendly and allowed us to take our time ordering food. For starters, we ordered the Belgian fries (SO good), salt and vinegar popcorn (addictive), mussels (the tomato broth was so flavorful we wanted to drink it straight), and the pull apart pretzel (my favorite dish of the evening). We were very pleased with the starters. \\n\\nThe favorite main of the night was the Georgia Wild Shrimp n' Grits; great flavor and perfectly cooked grits. Some entrees, however, were a bit disappointing. Perhaps we were too full from the starter carb overload or the numerous beers we had already consumed, but some of the entrees were lacking. I ordered the kraut and beer brats and found the dish very one dimensional. I wish there had been spaetzle or a bun to balance out the flavors. The roasted chicken also lacked flavor, even with the truffle flavor. \\n\\nGreat overall experience at Porter Beer Bar!

We waited about an hour, but the drinks are really good and with good company an hour doesn't seem so long. Some people will complain about this, but I think the best part about the rooftop is that the host needs to seat you, as in, you can't just stand around.\\n\\nMaybe it's because I'm not good at sharing, but I don't like when open patios or roof decks are just filled with people standing around and waiting aggressively for the bartender's attention while being smushed like sardines.

The potato salad is basically cold chorizo mashed potatoes, again really good, just doesn't pair well with the cole slaw or meat. However, their biggest abomination is the cobbler. DO NOT waste your money on the sad cobbler. It's a dry, insipid cake, with blackberry jam dumped on it.

Also, cream cheese and fried rice as a combination makes the role a bit heavy.\\n\\nCons 2 (-1 star): The price on the menu and the price on our itemized receipt initially didn't match. Ok, I'm mathematically inclined and it was very easy to see inconsistency when you don't have to calculate tax in Portland. Some item in the happy hour menu was $7 and we were charged $14. We were also overcharged for the steamed buns. I found out after we paid and the manager credited us the money back. But that left me a weird feeling. What if I didn't find out? What about other diners who didn't find out? Was it an honest mistake? I would expect to get a genuine apology and some form of dessert on the house, not because I needed it but because I think it's wrong that a restaurant can just get away with charging you double of what they put on the menu. \\n\\nTl;dr: Wine flights are fun.

My friend and I shared 3 dishes and dessert, and each of us had two cocktails. As far as drinks go, the Jack and Rose was particularly yummy. The food was spectacular. I describe it as 4 dimensional because there are so many levels- the depth of flavor, the crunch of texture, the pairing of seemingly opposite  food choices and the presentation. I loved the gnocchi dish. The crazy thing was the prices were all affordable. The menu is full of smaller sized plates to share but while they could have easily been running in the 20s each, they were kept in the 10-15 range, making me feel like I could order another drink! \\n\\n\\nI was afraid that the portions would be too small- but they were great. I'd say with two people 3-5 dishes is all you need plus dessert. However it would be even more fun to have 4 people so you could try them all.\\n\\nSouthern Belle is going to be one of my go-tos now. Whether for a catch up with a friend, or somewhere I want to take a date to impress them.

The gravy was the highlight of the dish, really really good. Biscuit was very buttery and fell apart easily, eggs were cooked to perfection and the bacon wasn't too salty - which I liked.\\n\\nPeach Cobbler French Toast: Very cinnamon-y and I liked the peach cobbler complimenting the already-good french toast. A little too sweet but you can avoid that by taking some of the cobbler off the french toast.\\n\\nCrispy Fried Chicken & Waffles: Think this was my favorite dish we ordered, fried chicken in between waffles. Put some maple syrup and you got some sweet & savory goodness. The fried chicken was actually incredible, better than anything I have had in Atlanta (in my opinion, better than Mary Mac's) and the waffles were pretty standard.\\n\\nService: We went around 9am on a Friday, the place was pretty crowded but we were seated right away.

I wish I had ordered what my date had, though- a seitan sirloin on mashed sweet potatoes with collard greens and a mushroom gravy. So satisfying! The venue is small and intimate with excellent service. Warm and inviting with fresh, local and often organic ingredients.

I emailed the manager ahead of time to make sure they had vegetarian options on the menu and got a quick response and was assured they had many veggie options for us. He was right! The food was delicious!\\n\\n**Service 2 stars:\\n\\nOnly thing was iffy was the customer service, or lack of service. It was surprisingly extremely busy on a Tuesday night, but I made reservations ahead of time (3 weeks) and told the manager my plan of surprising my fianc√© for his birthday, he told me not to worry and that he had my reservations in and everything will be good to go. \\n\\nMy plan was to get there with my fianc√© AFTER our friends were seated. Which I mentioned to the manager. But when we got there, our friends told us that they couldn't seat us all until we were all there or at least 75% were there. So my plan didn't go as I thought it would, and we were still waiting for a table for 15 mins when we got there. \\n\\nWe had to keep looking for our waiter, he always seemed annoyed and wasn't too friendly when we asked him questions. We also ordered items and never got them and had to remind him to bring them. We asked for help for vegetarian options and he wasn't that helpful to direct us to the right entrees. He even brought out the last entree at the very end when everyone was done, so we told him to take it back since it was too late.\\n\\nThey brought out champagne for my fianc√©'s birthday celebration, but I was hoping for some type of dessert or candle or something and they never did that. It wasn't as special for my fianc√© as I thought it would be, especially when the manager told me everything would be taken care of and he knew what my plans were.\\n\\nOverall, it's a good place, I would definitely go back for the food, it was so flavorful and delicious!

It's frickin glorious and I crave it even now as I write this review. I love it so hard it hurts.\\n\\nSo the design: With an interior that juxtaposes gradients of grey with graffiti art and decorative ghetto blasters, and a gorgeous bar that is front and center (and extends to reveal an open-ish kitchen), it's undeniable that this spot is Capital C Cool. The 80s/90s tunes are heavy on hip hop and are provided from a live DJ. I really dig the look of this place, but I find the chairs uncomfortable, especially when I was siting at the communal high top. It's like the dining-room equivalent of a pair of stilettos: Sexy as hell but they'll leave you hurting. At least that was MY experience. Your mileage may vary.\\n\\nThe servers are all dressed in gray to match the interior, and it's a hot look. The staff here is super cool (as to be expected), and they're genuinely friendly as well. They're quick with the swapping out dishes, recommending which custom sauce to use on your dish, and getting your (delicious) cocktail from the bar to your table. It's just a bummer that on both visits I found myself waiting for a fresh water carafe or to make an entree selection or to pay our bill. Maybe I'm impatient, but it surprises me how certain things happen so quickly while others are so slow!\\n\\nSo how is the food? Clearly, I think certain dishes are fantastic. I love the fried chicken, and the charred shishito peppers are fantastic. I've also enjoyed the kimchi and the melon pickle (which comes with a delicious yogurt sauce)! It seems I'm pretty down with their \\"any time\\" menu, and I'd come back to order off of that, for sure. For entrees, I've had the dan dan noodles (with chipotle pork and collared greens), the Seaweed noodle (Dungeness crab, red curry, creme fraiche), and the short rib rice (sambal daikon, mustard green). Of those, the dan dan noodles are probably my favorite, followed by the short rib rice and the seaweed noodle. None of them, however, blew me away like the appetizers. The portions seemed kinda small to me, and I was never as happy at the end of the meal as I was when it was just getting started.\\n\\nSo, I'll probably be back at some point.

They now have a classy looking dining room with lots of warm wood, subdued lighting and tastefully done decor.  They've also installed snugs on one side of the restaurant which you rarely ever find outside of an Irish or English pub.  It's basically your own mini dining area and it's great for a little seclusion and quiet.\\n\\nSo what about the food?  My benchmark Hot and Sour Soup was hot and thick with a little focus on the white pepper.  I also ordered the dinner sized Hunan Shrimp which wasn't as hot temperature wise as I would have liked but it was actually quite good as far as flavor.  It was a decent size portion but not over generous.  Shrimp, broccoli and mushrooms in hot chili oil.  It was hot, spicy and they certainly didn't skimp on the shrimp.\\n\\nThe service was a little on the slow side but nothing too bad.  I figure they recently just opened so there are going to be some teething problems like any other restaurant.\\n\\nSo, I like what I see and now I'm really looking forward to my next visit.

It only seats about 30 people at a time plus some outdoor tables on the sidewalk.  We lucked out and were seated, immediately.\\n\\nThe menu is very different from most Italian offerings.  This is not your typical Italian eatery.  First, think 'small plates.'  Most entrees are available in half or full portions and the there are lots of antipasti and sides in addition to a good selection of entrees.  The owners are from Northern Italy but It's hard to  classify or pinpoint the type of Italian cuisine represented by the menu.  None of it is fancy or lavish.  Some of our favorites ere Roasted Beets w/Onions, Green Beans w/Chile & Ham, Cherry Tomato Caprese, Tagliatelle w/Beef & Pork Ragu, Linguine w/Avocado,Almond & Walnut Sauce, Hanger Steak w/Garlic & Rosemary, Braised Chicken w/Capers, Baked Stuffed Trout, Green Beans w/Bread Crumbs and Mint, Arancini (fried risotto balls filled w/cheese), Polpette (small meatballs) and more.

Even though they are pricey, their 2 coffee drinks on the menu are perfect for either weekend brunch or if you are in need of some caffeine. There are two reason I give this place 4/5 instead of 5/5: they don't have any good menu specials ($1 off burgers on Tuesday, but thats really it) and the girls bathroom situation is horrid.

I added a side of bacon and I was good to go.\\n\\nMy friend ordered the salmon croquettes and it reminded me of a dish my mom used to make when I was younger. It was crispy on the outside and delicious salmon stuffed on the inside. It comes with grits and man oh man, it was tasty! \\n\\nOverall, the food came out fast. The service was great. Only challenge was parking. There are a few spots in the front of the restaurant and I couldn't figure out where additional parking spots were located so I ended up parking at the GA Aquarium (and paying $10). However, I thoroughly enjoyed my breakfast and I hope to return again soon. This is a must visit restaurant if you are in town visiting Atlanta... centrally located next to all of the top tourist spots (Aquarium, World of Coke, and Center for Civil and Human Rights museum)."},{"name":"Stats","address":"300 Marietta St NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Good American sports bar food.

So I chose something else. We ordered kelp noodles and the cannelloni, of which both are cold dishes. Both dishes were priced at $16 each. When the food came, we were disappointed at the quantity. The flavours were also very underwhelming. The price was quite high for what it is, especially when I have created something similar at home for a fraction of the price. \\nOverall, I appreciate the restaurant's philosophy, and I am glad I gave it a try.

They were bordering on consumer fraud by writing in their menu that the chicken serves two (and is a certain price, which we checked before ordering with waiter) only to find that the listed price was secretly per person. The dinner rolls were cold to boot! When I called and complained about my experience, I expected a call back or some offer to retain me as a customer. Nothing of the sort. Not only is the quality of the food and pricing not worth it, but for this declared caliber of dining, I expect a comprehension and appreciation for customer service.

We had dinner here recently, one of our party has a severe, life threatening allergy to tree nuts.  We informed our server, stressed it's importance and were told that without a doubt everything that we had ordered was tree-nut free.  All of our food and our bottle of wine had arrived at the table when our friend with the allergy started feeling off.  We had only eaten the fried chicken appetizer at this point, and not yet started eating the rest of our food so we were able to clearly identify the problem dish, we once again asked the server to verify there was NO TREE NUTS thinking possibly it was a spice in the dish giving her a similar feeling and were once again assured that there was no nuts other than peanuts in the dish.  \\n\\nThen it happened.  She started to have a reaction, turning red, throat closing.  An extremely terrifying experience that she had not experienced for over TWO years - we told our server that we needed to get her to the ER asap.  \\n\\nHis response - would you like me to box up your food?   \\n\\nHe then brought us over our check for our uneaten food and barely touched wine - asking for us to close out our tab before we headed off to the ER.  \\n\\nDisgusting, repulsive and outrageous response.

I'm also surprised that I have to give one for White Spot - an eating establishment that I used to love! It was a family favorite, but after last night, I am not so sure anymore and will be looking for a new family favorite. We came here for the Harvest Roast Turkey dinner that I remember seeing advertised on the White Spot Canada website at https://whitespot.ca/harvest. See my screenshot attached from their website. We came here on October 26th around 8:30pm. It said there would be turkey dinner, pumpkin milkshake, and pumpkin pie offered in the month of October. The three of us came here last night to try this October promotion. I had my heart set on trying the turkey dinner, pumpkin milkshake, and pumpkin pie. The 3 of us were all going to order the turkey dinner as a belated Thanksgiving celebration.\\n\\nWhen we sat down and started our drink orders, the waitress started other drinks (soda and tea) for my 2 friends. I ordered the pumpkin milkshake. She returned to tell that there were no more pumpkin milkshakes and no pumpkin pies left, because their pumpkin milkshakes are also made from their pies. This gave me bit of a red flag about the availability of their Harvest dinner, so to double-check, I asked her if they still have the turkey dinners (otherwise there would be no point for us to come here and if she had said no right then and there, we could just get up and leave politely). But she said that they do have the turkey dinners. Then she came back and said they have them but not the seasonal harvest themed veggies, but with broccolini, and I said that was fine. So we stayed and my friends got their drinks. But about 10 - 15 minutes after drinks were served at our table, the waitress came back and told us that there were no turkey dinners. Had we known this earlier, we could have just left and find another restaurant for a belated Thanksgiving or turkey dinner. But since the drinks were already on the table, that means now we have to pay for them before we leave. It would have been nice if the server had talked to the manager about this and just comped our drinks off and then we can leave. \\n\\nThe manager did talk to us and offered a solution of the thinner turkey deli style meat from the sandwiches for a small turkey dinner (not the actual turkey meat style). But we just thanked her and politely said we would order something else. Anyway it's not the server's fault, she was very polite and kept apologizing. She even called another White Spot restaurant to see if they had turkey dinners when we inquired if another WS would have them. But she informed us that it was sold out everywhere at many White Spot locations. I don't know if that was true or not but I took her word for it. So we looked through the menu to see what else we could order, but honestly, we were just really passionate to do the Thanksgiving turkey style dinner. So when we told the waitress that we will just leave, it would have been nice if she or the manager had just comped our drinks and let us go at that point. My friends paid and tipped for the drinks that they didn't bother to finish and left. They still tipped because it's not the server's fault. If the drinks had been written off, I would have for sure asked everyone to still tip her. But I felt like she could have just asked the manager for advice again when we said we were leaving. The experience was overall disappointing at this restaurant and nearly ruined our night. We left just feeling... well, rather blah and down. Not a nice feeling to have at a restaurant that you used to love.

I booked the only reservation left for their opening day...4:30! First off, the restaurant itself is gorgeous. Shout out to whoever decorated this place! From the minute I walked in the door, I was warmly greeted by the hostess and shown to my table. My friend was running behind because of traffic but the server promptly started waiting on me, brought me a cocktail and food menu, and gave me time to peruse while waiting on my friend. Their cocktail menu was amazing....broken down by taste (sour, sweet, pungent, astringent, salty, and bitter) and based on Indian Ayurvedic medicine. Tonight, I ordered two cocktails: Pink City and Patna Fizz...both of which were some of the best cocktails I've ever had. My friend, who is an Old Fashioned aficionado, tried theirs and said it was amazing...and it was! Apparently the bourbon is \\"fat washed\\" which the server explained was a combo of a couple of different healthy oils and coffee beans frozen with the bourbon which separates out impurities in the alcohol. They also gave us each a glass of complimentary champagne to celebrate their opening night. As for food, our server was very knowledgeable on the menu and provided some outstanding recommendations. We each shared two small plates: the pork belly and the Puri. Both were simply to die for. The puri had a fantastic afterheat that wasn't too strong but perfectly tingly if that makes sense. The pork belly had a wonderful crispness on the outside balanced by the sweet heat of a mango sauce. My body doesn't process pork well but this sat nicely and didn't feel too heavy. I also appreciated that the server asked if there were any food allergies without us having to volunteer that information. It was just a nice touch. We also shared the Butter Chicken large plate which was super flavorful and a good sized portion. After one large plate and two smalls, we were pretty stuffed but saved room to try a desert. We ordered their version of a carrot cake which was really delicious! For two people, two small plates, one large, and four cocktails, our bill came to around $120 before tip which I felt was reasonable given the quality of the food and impeccable service.

The food however, I succumbed to a sandwich that reminded me of myself, \\"The Fatboy\\" a club sandwich on steroids that weighs over a pound! The sandwich had corned beef, Turkey, ham, two fried eggs, four cheeses, lettuce, tomato, mayo, fries, and Cole slaw. Each sandwich comes with fries, and I must, these are some damn good fries! Their crisp but yet chewy and beer-battered. The sandwich was good, but was odd. It was hot with the fries and egg, but cold with the other toppings. I would recommend if you're hungry, but if you have a bird stomach, don't bother.

Surprising that it's owned by the same folks who own Tom's Country Kitchen in Beaverton, because the difference between the two establishments is dramatic. Davidson's food is just BAD and there's no other way to put it. I don't know who the people are that gave this place such high reviews (maybe the staff). After giving them another try for breakfast just recently(because Elmer's was too long to wait), I was reminded why I stopped eating there. The spinach and Swiss omlette I ordered actually had mozerella, rather than Swiss cheese ( if you thought no one would notice, think again...mozerella is not a melting cheese, so it was just hard and chewy), making my omlette barely edible. Toast was cold and dry (do you make up 200 slices in advance and then let them sit under a heat lamp until an unsuspecting customer orders toast?). My friend's omlette with country gravy was cold and the gravy was flavorless. In fact, nothing had ANY flavor at all. I realize this place caters to the senior crowd, but as a senior myself, I beg you people to PUT SOME SEASONING IN YOUR FOOD. The coffee also had no flavor ( like hot, brown water). The side of pancakes I ordered was okay, but would have been better if the butter wasn't rock hard and of sufficient quantity (about 2 teaspoons for 3 cakes...why skimp on butter--an essential for pancakes?). The other issue is that the place seems very poorly managed. There is not an iota of efficiency, as the staff are all bumping into each other. People trying to check out are crowded out by those waiting to be seated. A host was running around, but not focused on priorities (I.e., seating people, making sure tables are cleared, etc). Tables are way too close together  and it's difficult to even get up from your chair, without knocking over someone.The fact that it's always busy there is not so much a testament to the quality of the food as the location.

This meal - a Chinese dish consisting of a bamboo-steamed bun, some sort of protein, garnished with a complimentary sauce and sprinkled with peanuts or veggies or other accoutrement -  is not only delicious, it's beautiful to look at. A fluffy little white circular bun with vibrant colored spices and garnish, set neatly in a row with her sisters, ready to be consumed with some truffle tots or other sides, is almost too picture-perfect to be eaten.\\n\\nAlmost.\\n\\nKing Bao mercifully reigns over Mills as one of the top-rated food-truck-style spots in this category and exists in an unassuming storefront across from a raggedy 7-Eleven and laundromat, catty-corner from a bustling CVS. Though us locals know what treasures may be found on Mills, only those out-of-towners who are Yelp savvy enough and looking for the right thing will stumble upon this gem, which keeps it hip and cool. If you come early-afternoon, before the church crowd lets out and well-dressed families crowd this small space, looking for any surface to enjoy these little masterpieces, you may actually find a seat and have the opportunity to meet someone new. There is a long wooden bar with seating against the far wall, and scattered white tables and sturdy plastic chairs for those who are lucky, and the menu is adorned with cool graffiti and interesting names like \\"hogzilla\\" and \\"kickin chicken.\\" But I digress.\\n\\nI'm not sure what your idea of a fun Sunday afternoon may entail, but on a day when my partner was at a baby shower and I was itching to try something new, King Bao popped up in my bookmarks and I decided to take the plunge. The line was short so I quickly picked three standard Bao's - Firecracker Shrimp, Kickin Chicken, and Hogzilla - then added some truffle tots to round the experience out. Less than 10 minutes later I was gazing out the picture glass window onto Mills, taking my Yelp picture of the meal while trying not to drool on my phone camera. Each Bao was unique and distinctive in it's flavoring but all shared the same spongy fluffy texture and had clearly fresh ingredients. The pork fell apart as I ate it, the shrimp was sumptuous and not very fishy, and the chicken was moist and incredibly flavorful. Tater tots, as a general rule, are delicious so, though the spices used absolutely enhanced the flavor and are something I would get again, it's hard to perfect perfect.\\n\\nThis spot is best for both Chinese/Thai food connoisseurs who don't mind the bold fusion and prideful non-authentic feel, as well as the general person off the street looking to try something new. The prices are great, the food is tasty, and the atmosphere is casual - I am certain I'll be back again to show off this found gem to friends and family alike.\\n\\n5 stars for delicious eats, wide variety of menu items, close location, fast and friendly service.

I was looking for a place that had some typical Americanized Chinese food and combination dinner similar to Golden Crown.\\n\\nI've gotten take-out from here twice now.  Every restaurant has a slightly different recipe for things, and that's to be expected.  I found the Chinese food here to be along the lines of what I expected though - and I consider that a good thing.  My first time here, I ordered their dinner meal #1: Sesame chicken, pork chow mein, and fried rice; I also tried some of their sweet & sour pork as a separate item.  My second time there, I ordered dinner combination #4: Chicken subgum chow mein, sweet & sour pork, & fried shrimp.  I also added a scoop of fried rice.  The chow mein in #1 was in the same style I liked from Golden Crown and some other Chinese restaurants: Aside from the meat, it had bean sprouts, celery, water chestnuts, and some green onion (from what I could tell), and it came with crunchy noodles on the side. The chicken subgum had water chestnuts, carrot pieces, celery pieces, peas, and sliced mushrooms.  The sesame chicken was decent (battered & fried & with an okay flavor and crunchy texture), with sweet & sour and spicy hot Chinese mustard on the side.  The fried rice was as expected, and fairly good.\\n\\nI thought the sweet & sour pork was not bad, though it has a strong pineapple flavor and is a little too sweet for my taste.  When it's ordered as its own iten, they serve the pork and the sweet & sour sauce separately.  In a combination dinner, the pork is mixed in with the sauce.   When separate, the pork (battered & fried) had a batter that is somewhat crunchy.\\n\\nOverall, I think their food is pretty good, filling, and just what I'd want when I'm craving American-style Chinese comfort food.  Also the cashier was friendly (I've ordered food to go twice so far).\\n\\nAlso, this restaurant is in the Cedar Mill area, which is a fairly decent location if you live around there or not very far from there.

So this pleases a large group of people and people who have friends or family who are picky eaters can eat here. \\n\\nWe ordered a ton this morning. We got pancakes and added blueberries, mixed fresh fruit, chicken sandwich, fried green tomatoes (because why not?), eggs over easy and a ton of sausage. The chicken sandwich was great and as expected. Savory, juicy, delicious. I skipped the fries that came with it and finished the other sides I got. The fried green tomatoes were on the tangy side for me. I much prefer the tomatoes at Homegrown or South City Kitchen. But this was a solid place, with a solid meal and huge portions.\\n\\nWe had fast and efficient service and you'll see quickly that that is how they turn their tables. You don't feel rushed but they come straight to your table to ask for your order, quickly get you your food and provide you with the check without you asking for it. As soon as you get up, they are already cleaning it and calling the next person. That is how they manage to accommodate so many patrons in a day.\\n\\nIf you're coming just for the food, grab an uber or a lyft and get dropped off.

Unlike many places who will sometimes require a bit of a wait to actually seat a large party upon arrival, we were seated immediately and without the need for everyone to be there (good thing too as we had a few stragglers). We were seated on the patio near the fire place, and the only complaint was that it was a little crowded on the side that had small stool type seating as there is another table directly across who had someone already there. Regardless the actual table was much larger than needed for our party so we were able to be seated quickly and comfortably.\\n\\nWe had 2 waiters throughout the evening who provided great service, and the only hiccup was a drink order not showing up that was likely due to the bar being overwhelmed. They had no issues allowing us to order individually and not from an optional group menu and order we did, between us all trying most of the various tapas offerings. Michael stopped by several times, at first to welcome us and then to check in to make sure everything was going well. On top of that they brought out 2 plates of 4 different tapas on the house to get things started before what we ordered started showing up. Just about everything I had I remember well, and enjoyed. Notably excellent were the calamari, hangar steak, and cold egglant dish. \\n\\nOther assorted musings and observations:\\n\\n- place was packed, had a very festive atmosphere and quite loud if you were to sit inside\\n- it got a bit chilly, even by the fireplace when the wind picked up, they actually had these faux bear skin blankets for the ladies that they brought out w/o asking which I thought was a very nice touch\\n- they were reluctant to separate the tab at the end of the night, and we didn't press them to due to the # we had; I was surprised they didn't add gratuity for such a large party\\n\\nAll in all, very glad Michael reached out, and even more glad we stopped in for my birthday dinner.

It seems like other Yelp reviews have mentioned the service quality. I appreciate that the manager offered a complimentary dessert. I'm a pretty reasonable person and I very rarely speak up. You can check my other yelp reviews and see that I am not a super defensive or critical customer. I don't appreciate my concern being turned down. It is apparent that the management is very defensive about customer service. That's fine. Clearly this is not a welcoming place."},{"name":"The Albert","address":"918 Austin Ave","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"This is located in the Inman Park area just opposite to North Highland Ave. There is a small parking area in the back of the complex shared with other places and a few street parking areas after 4pm.\\n\\nThe interior has a very old time, pub look to it with beautifully decorated arches with silver lion heads (pictured below).

However, ethnic food is routinely toned down for American consumption.  I'm glad I decided to eat there. \\n\\nThe menu is filled with familiar Indonesian dishes.  There's even a \\"combination plate\\" with small portions of popular dishes. I was going to order it, and my waiter felt it's a great way to have a variety of foods. However, he suggested I order the Arabic Lamb Specialty that was not on the menu.  I have had Indonesian food in New York and where I live. How often does one get the opportunity to eat Arabic food?  It was an easy decision. \\n\\nI was expecting grilled lamb similar to Lebanese food over steamed rice. What I got was lamb and rice cooked in an underground oven. The waiter said it gave the rice its slightly smoky flavor. I couldn't identify several spices used, but I can attest the result was outstanding. The lamb was soft tender and flavorful. The rice was typical very long grain rice. It has a subtle flavor that compliments the lamb. It was served with a tomato based sauce on the side. The sauce was too spicy for my taste but probably mild on the Indonesian hot scale. I felt it overwhelmed the complex seasoning of the lamb. The lamb was too good to hide its virtues with any sauce no matter how good the sauce may be. Truly an exceptional meal. \\n\\nI again trusted the waiter with the dessert. It was an orange colored cheese dish. The waiter told me to stop playing with my phone and eat it before it got cold. Love the guy. I'm not sure what was in it except some pistachios, but it was a wonderful new experience.  \\n\\nNeedless to say, my waiter was great!

Maybe not a bigger foodie, but a different kind of foodie. I look through Yelp, Eater and Infatuation, he reads the Michelin and Zagat guides. Must be nice working in consulting. I happen to like sleep, though. Anyway, he and my sister have tried a whole bunch of fine dining spots over the course of their relationship and have compiled a pretty substation \\"to try\\" list, similar to mine but adjusted for budget. So for my sister's college graduation dinner, her boyfriend had a suggestion all cued up and ready to go. Enter Craigie on Main. It turned out to be pretty perfect for my family. Though we're all some variation of food, most of us don't particularly care if a place is wildly high-brow or not. Craigie on Main is a fantastic, high-quality place, but still down to earth. Great service, equally stellar food and drinks and an environment that makes you want to stay a while. \\n\\nWe came here as a party of six. My immediate family, plus the two boyfriends. Craigie on Main offers a number of different ordering options: tasting, prix fixe and a la carte. The downside--and this isn't unique to Craigie--is that if you want to opt for tasting, the whole table needs to be on board. So though my bf and I were contemplating the tasting menu, the rest of our party was not quite as ambitious. We still got the visuals though--Craigie has an open kitchen (always love getting to watch the masters at work) so we got to peak in at the night's lineup.\\n\\nOur waiter for the night was fantastic. Personable, energetic, upbeat and great recommendations. Particularly when it came to liquor options. Though Craigie is a restaurant first, the alcohol selection is serious. A great list of whiskeys and a really impressive cocktail menu. I knew I wasn't going to be drinking for quite a while after this particular night, so I went a little overboard with ordering. It didn't hurt that my parents were paying *and* it was a special occasion. Whoops. For my first drink, I went with the Stay Gold, Ponboy (ron dipolomatico, pecan-infused sherry, cayenne, gran clasico). Great one to start with, well balanced with a little kick. I also had a small sip of my mom's first drink, the Spearitt Animal (hine cognac, pear liquer, sage, citrus, black walnut, egg white). Complex and perfectly frothy. My second drink was the Thai Basil Smash (cap rock organic gin, thai basil, chili water, ginger, lime), which was a no-brainer for me. Always been a fan of the thai/basil/gin combination. I finished with the Mellow Yellow (mckenna bourbon, chartreuse, becherovka, apricot brandy), which was another very-well balanced drink. About halfway through this drink my memory started to get a bit cloudy so sadly my report on this one isn't quite as clear. The gist: the mixologists and cocktail program here are not to scoff at.\\n\\nWhen it comes to food, Craigie on Main focuses on majestic meats. You know a place emphasizes its proteins when its got a section of menu dedicated to meats to be split between two (the pork dishes here being the most famous ones). The bf and I wanted to have some more variety in our meal, so we got a nice medley of plates, all coursed out to our liking. As expected, the proteins were cooked to perfection--with great variety, too. Eats, below: \\n\\nOlive Oil-Poached Spanish Octopus: A\\nI'm a broken record with these octopus plates. I'm not sure if I have anything original left. Octopus is up there in the running for my most favorite food and I eat it everywhere. The preparation was somewhat simple in flavors but clearly quite refined in preparation. The tentacles had just the right amount of crisp and tenderness.\\n\\nAsparagus: A-\\nThe bf didn't like that these were served cold but we needed some solid veggies to go with our meat-heavy meal. And I actually enjoyed the plate overall. Simple but yummy and fresh. The bread crumbs and seeds made it feel more complete/refined and added some nice texture. I'm all for textural variety in my food, so I appreciated the intent here.  \\n\\nCrispy-Fried Essex Clams w/ preserved lemon, pickled peppers, dried black olive, squid ink ancho√Øade: A+\\nOne of our two favorite dishes of the night. I'm no stranger to squid ink or clams, but this preparation was innovative and seriously tasty. The clams were just the right of fried and the squid \\"ancho√Øade\\" made them all the more decadent. The light/citrusy flavors pairing with the umami of the ink--amazing.\\n\\nVermont Pork Three Ways: Roasted Shoulder, Slow-Cooked Belly, and Spice-Crusted Rib w/ radishes, whole grain mustard, rutabaga: A+\\nObviously the climax of our evening. This place knows how to cook a mean piece of pork. They've mastered all the different renditions in all the different ways. I can't remember which variety I liked best. The ribs took me back to my early pork-eating days (I was never the best Jew in that way)\\n\\nI did have an \\"after dinner whiskey\\" I cannot recall which kind.

Usually i just have the tom ka soup and a side of rice because its my favorite thai dish, but they have many options extending to chinese cuisine. Although its quite small, it has a beautiful cultural and homey sit down restaurant design and its very comfortable. The reason im only giving 4 stars is because the parking is horrible. Its a tiny (not exaggerating) lot in the front of the restaurant which cars need to block eachother in which to park successfully. So, you will need to move your car to let people out. Seriously, they take a picture of your license plate and say whoever car this is needs to move because someone is leaving which interrupts your meal and experience because you must move in order for things to keep running. Also, backing out is backing into the middle of the street where theres oncoming traffic, as well which is pretty dangerous."},{"name":"Chambar","address":"568 Beatty Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Came here for Dine Out 2016 and boy oh boy, it was amazing.

Their beets and watercress salad (salad d'hiver) was delicious dressed and filled with interesting root veggies. Their tuna appetizer (thon tropical)  was also amazing with both a fried and raw tuna on the plate with a nice tangy slaw.\\n\\nThe entrees were even better with a perfectly cooked steelhead trout (la truite au poivre)  and lightly oily purple fried rice again with some veggies. Mussels in white wine and butter sauce (vin blanc) were fat fat fat (in the best way) and bursted with each and every bite into them. The fries were also crispy and did not eat oily at all! Lastly, the star of the show was the lamb (tagine d'aziz a l'agneau) which was tender and came in a huge portion but the best part was the sauce. Cinnamon, honey and fig - these flavours were perfect when paired with the side of cous cous which when all eaten together, was a harmony of beauty in my mouth. \\n\\nFinally, dessert just completed the night. The chocolate mousse (mousse au chocolat) was not too sweet or heavy, balanced but chocolatey deliciousness. Along with dulce de luche ice cream, this was my favourite dessert. The custard (mama rizk) was not too heavy or sweet either but was delicious paired with the blood orange.

This review is purely based on take-out, or in this case, the food I had delivered by a 3rd party service. What I received lacked in flavor, and protein. The food was hot, and all that is fine, but the food itself was not flavorful. I am a bit of a jjigae nut, and succumbed to a particularly strong kimchi jjigae craving. Upon tasting my order, I was a bit underwhelmed. The strong flavors that I so love just weren't there, and I found myself trying to add gochujang just to give it life. The stew was okay, but not at all worth ordering. I like Korean food for the strong flavors, and this was a little on the bland side, especially for a kimchi jjigae.

There was also some type of sweet crumble on top that complimented the sweet, yet somewhat tart peaches that georgia is known for. That along of small bites of the perfectly cooked bacon made for mouthgasms. On to the chicken and waffles. The waffles were slightly crisp on the outside, yet had the carb cloud fluffiness that one desires when eating it.

I can be kind of picky about my margaritas but the frozen strawberry hit the spot.

We came here, by default, because El Sarape was too packed to get in on Cinco de Mayo. The menu looked pretty awesome (American bar food) and the place didn't appear to be that busy. \\n\\nWe took a hi-top right by the front window, seated quickly by the same person who turned out to be our waitress. We hadn't had a chance to review the drink menu yet, so we sent her away the first time she asked us for drinks. We soon wished we hadn't done that. It was a good ten minutes before she returned to take our drink orders. By that point, we were reticent to let her go, so we just put in our full meal orders as well. We decided to start with the Chicken & Waffle Sliders, I ordered the Buffalo Chicken Mac'n'Cheese and JT got a pizza. \\n\\nOur beer took awhile to arrive (I think, mainly because, the bartender was seemingly doing double-duty bussing tables around the bar area). The tap list wasn't as great as Four Square across the street, but they had a few interesting selections. JT ordered an Old Fashioned, but he said it was disgusting and ordered another beer. That surprised me because normally, if it has whiskey in it, JT is pretty non-discerning. \\n\\nThe waitress comes back to re-confirm our dinner order. She couldn't remember it all and she didn't write it down. We confirmed our order and off she went. \\n\\nThe Chicken and Waffle Sliders arrived and ... the chicken was far too uniform in size and appearance to be anything other than frozen cutlets. We lined them up ... same size, equal breading, exact same cuts... I'm pretty sure I'm right. That said, I buy frozen chicken to make meals easy at home. I'm not judging...ok, I'm judging...I make frozen chicken at HOME. Going out is where I'm supposed to get something special, right? Anyway, the waffles seemed like they had been nuked. They were unhappily droopy over the chicken and very rubbery. Not something I would order again. In order for this to be \\"sliders\\" - the waffles have to be crisp to act as the bun...that wasn't happening.\\n\\nI did enjoy my Buffalo Mac'n'Cheese. The chicken was breaded in some seriously spicy buffalo breading, but it was complimented well by the creamy bleu cheese sauce. I actually ate primarily the penne pasta and the cheese sauce. The pasta was cooked well. \\n\\nJT thought the pizza he got was ok. It was a typical bar pizza, but he said he preferred the pizza across the street at Four Square. Funny as they are \\"sister restaurants\\" but I guess it just wasn't up to par with what Four Square puts out regularly. \\n\\nWe ended up choosing not to stay for additional drinks as the tap list was limited and the first drink JT had wasn't impressive.\\n\\nI don't think we'll be regulars at Trio."},{"name":"Kal√©","address":"50 SW Pine St, Ste 102","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Went here several weeks ago and have been meaning to write this up but, just now getting to it...

Walking inside, the place looked like an abandoned Miami nightclub; it was clean and all but the decor maybe a little...dated? Again, my wary feeling returned but we were already there so I figured we might as well try it out. We were greeted by the hostess (who also doubled as our server) and seated right away. Since we were the only two patrons on the floor, our server was attentive and although not overly bubbly or friendly, she was nice enough and professional.\\n\\nAll the options on the menu looked great and it took me a long time to decide what to order. While we decided, we ordered beef empanadas as a side. The empanadas had the flakiest crust I've ever tasted. The filling could've been a little more plentiful but overall the taste was delicious because that crust couldn't be denied. I ordered a mango margarita on the rocks to drink and found that it was a bit \\"thick\\" for me but the taste was still very good. \\n\\nFinally, for my entree, I chose the Lechon Asado (Roasted Pork with saut√©ed onions). It came with white rice, black beans and yucca but I substituted those sides for Arroz Moro, which is white rice and beans cooked together, and plantains. My wife chose the Arroz Imperial which is Yellow rice stuffed with shredded chicken, mayonnaise & melted cheese on top, she had plantains with that as well. \\n\\nWow! Both entrees were DELICIOUS! My pork came out smothered with onions that were cooked to tender perfection. The pork itself was incredibly flavorful with a slight taste of citrus to lighten up richness of it. The rice on its own was okay but not the best I've ever had. But smothered by the pork and all the succulent juices dripping from it, it was great. The plantains were super sweet and the perfect compliment to a delicious dinner. I was in HEAVEN! This is authentic Cuban food at its best. \\n\\nBy the way, the restaurant is very spacious so it's more than able to compliment a large group for a party. In fact, a large group came in halfway through our meal. Some reviews complained about the prices but I didn't find them to be bad at all, especially since we ate our bellies full and still left with full carry-home plates that made for a great lunch the next day.

You'll see the Tara Theater on your left, pass the Landmark Diner and just pass Lenox Rd before seeing Little Bangkok on your left. Typically the parking is all crazy with diners double-parked, but you can park across the street at Kong's Body Shop or Gail K Fabrics.\\n\\nI've been eating at this location for many years - it was a convenient meeting spot for me when I lived in Little Five Points - convenient to meet with friends who were living in Chamblee and other points further North. Alas I had forgotten about it since moving to points north myself. When suggested, once again as a meeting spot for an early dinner I jumped at the chance. Luckily the food is still as good as I remembered. I've since come here for Thai about a half dozen times and it's amazingly consistent - both a product and a justification of being in existence for so many years.\\n\\nThe worst thing about this restaurant, as I've already noted, is the parking. You used to also be able to park at the lot to the right but apparently those guys are now towing - beware and do not park there! The local towing companies are notorious for booting or towing and make great sport of it.\\n\\nOnce inside you'll see that the space is a bit cramped - if you focus a bit on the many items crammed into nooks and along walls there's quite a bit of Thai nostalgia to catch your eye. Also in the foyer you'll see the many awards and food critic notices this venerable restaurant has attained over the years. In any case, on with the food.\\n\\nCrispy Spring Roll - there's something quite magical about these deep-fried spring rolls. More like a large egg-roll, the extra crispy wrapper, fresh ingredients and accompanying sauce makes this one of the best I've had. Order two (you receive two rolls per order) to make sure everyone at the table gets at least two pieces. Delicious!\\n\\nPad Kee Mao with Chicken - this is one of my favorite dishes here - wide soft noodles with plenty of veggies - get this one extra spicy (at least 1 pepper hot). This Drunken Stir Fry indeed foots-the-bill when you've imbibed a bit too much earlier in the day. It's a bit like the post-soccer-pub curry my friends in the UK like so much.\\n\\nPad See Ew with Tofu - of course you should try at least one vegetarian dish - the crispy pan-seared tofu is a great change-of-pace on this classic wide-noodle dish.\\n\\nSpicy Shrimp - love this one! Get this at least 1 pepper hot as well.\\n\\nAny of the curries would also work - try the Penang with Chicken. I also recommend the Pad See Ew with Beef - you'll be glad you did!\\n\\nAs usual, the service is exceptional with a very attentive staff and quick check-out."},{"name":"Home Taste","address":"1312 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Arlington","stars":"4","text":"With great anticipation I biked over to the new Arlington branch of Home Taste late on their opening night and then returned a few days later on a Sunday afternoon with my lady.\\n\\nOpening night was a treat because I was able to chat with the staff and owner about the origins of the menu (which is something of smorgasbord of dishes from difference Chinese provinces) and what they would recommend as an introduction to their food.  My choices were:\\n- Chinese lamb burger\\n- Cucumber salad with mashed garlic\\n- Spicy vegetarian hand-pulled noodles\\n\\nThe dishes were so authentic-tasting and fresh, they took me back to  a recent tour in China and Xian in particular.  The hand-pulled noodles in particular were superb, with a nice kick from the numbing sichuan peppercorns that I love.  In my dreams Home Taste would be able to serve up a cheap fresh Hans lager like their counterparts in Xian, but one can only ask for so much.  Until my dream comes true there is bottled tea.\\n\\nReturning  a few days later, its was apparent that the staff need to learn how to juggle the onslaught of take-out orders along with their sit-down business, but we were patient diners and the experience and the tastes were still fabulous.\\n\\nMy advice to others is to stick take advantage of the sit-down experience at Home Taste until the take-out operation gets dialed-in, you will be rewarded."},{"name":"Flour Bakery + Caf√©","address":"12 Farnsworth St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Oh baby you light my fire. \\n\\nNot only do i have the Flour recipe book, and can make alot of the stuff at home.. i still come here.

This year we were joined by my girlfriend. Had I left a review last year, it would have been an easy 4-5 star. Everything was perfect and my mother really enjoyed herself. Since we had such a great experience last year, it was a no brainer making our reservation for Christmas dinner at Ruth's Chris again this year. \\n\\nAdmittedly we did arrive slightly late. Our reservation was for 8:00pm and it was 8:02 when I was giving my keys to the valet. When we tried to get into the restaurant, the door was locked and they were not letting anyone in. We waited for another party to leave and entered behind them. At the front desk they told us they were closed and I said I had a reservation for 8:00. They said we would have to wait for another table to leave. We were finally seated at 8:20. It's also worth mentioning that they called me to confirm my reservation on Wednesday and I would have appreciated it if they let me know to arrive before 8:00 so we wouldn't be locked out with a homeless man chain smoking on the front steps. \\n\\nThe tables were extremely close together. There was a family of 4 on one side of us with 2 young children. We had to listen to the father make baby noises the entire time. The back of his chair was basically touching our table - that's how close they crammed us in. It was a fiasco just trying to squeeze through to our chairs to sit down (and we are all little). The host was completely apathetic and did not try to help us into our seats. A gentleman at another table got out of his chair to let us get past him to sit down.\\n\\nA busser filled our water glasses when we sat down. Our waitress came over and apologized for the wait and took our order. Drinks were brought out promptly, although our appetizers were not served until 8:55 (and they forgot my mother's salad and my soup spoon). My lobster bisque tasted the same as the bisque I've bought at Roche Brothers. Also, there was no visible lobster in it.\\n\\nEntrees came out not long after the appetizers. We all had filet mignon. The steaks are definitely not the same quality as any other top shelf steakhouse. According to some of the reviews on Yelp, they do not dry age their steaks. These tasted no different than the steaks I've bought at supermarkets. On top of that, the filets were not even trimmed properly! All 3 of us had fat that had to be cut around. My filet was cooked properly (Medium Rare), but there was no visible searing. In traditional Ruth's Chris fashion, the steaks are served on a hot plate with melted butter. Maybe this dazzling display of sizzling butter is to mask their cheap cuts of meat.\\n\\nFor sides we had mashed potatoes and lobster mac and cheese. I will give credit where credit is due and say this was the best lobster mac I've ever had anywhere. I don't even remember it being this good last year. It's a huge portion, definitely enough for 3-4 people, and loaded with big chunks of lobster. The cheese sauce is cooked with jalapenos which gives it a really nice kick. \\n\\nFor dessert I had a cup of espresso. It was probably a half ounce serving. I have a high-end Jura espresso machine at home and have it dialed to 1.5 ounces per shot, and this was a third of that. Was gone in 1 sip (and had very sour notes). \\n\\nDrinks were inconsistent. I had the Sazerac, which is an Old Fashioned with absinthe. The first one was absolutely perfect; the 2nd was a cloudy, almost clear beverage that tasted like black licorice. They clearly dumped way too much absinthe in and served it to me anyways, instead of starting over. I think this drink was symbolic of the night as a whole. The staff clearly wanted to be home celebrating Christmas, so nobody brought their A-game.\\n\\nAfter a 20% tip, our bill came to $320. It was a mediocre night at best and truthfully I felt ripped off. With all of the phenomenal restaurants in Boston within this price range, it will be very difficult for me to even consider returning."},{"name":"Atlanta Breakfast Club","address":"249 Ivan Allen Jr Blvd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"While we were on a quick weekend trip to Atlanta from Michigan, this was a place we New we wanted to go try and it did not disappoint.

The pork is extremely tender and not overly fatty. I picked up the flavor of 5 spice. It's paired with pickled daikon and carrots and peanuts. I thought that the pickled diakon and carrots were mildly pickled but balanced out the meat well.

I was scared about ordering this because I wasn't sure how well seafood would be executed but boy was I happy we ordered sea food options! The crab cake was delicious and not filled with a bunch of fillers. The crust was also very crunchy which I loved. \\n\\nThey have a specials menu that changes: def gotta try those.

Very hearty, very filling, not overly tomato-y either, which I appreciated. Just a nice savory saucy dish. Japanese comfort food!\\n\\nThey also have cold barley tea available at no charge, along with water, and beers/soda. The space is open and clean, and there's a mix of regular tables and a few tatami mat tables where you take off  your shoes. Random mix of books on the shelves, both English and Japanese, and a selection of framed photos of Japanese cities on the walls. I liked the vibe, the people, and the food. They don't serve sushi, or bento boxes, they focus on curry dishes and some breaded cutlets to go with it."},{"name":"Trident Booksellers & Caf√©","address":"338 Newbury St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Revisited he cafe for brunch and it was so spectacularly mediocre that this will likely be my last meal at Trident after 15 years.

It turned out that a spot at the bar opened up first, before we finished our first beer. \\n\\nThey have a really great beer list -- curated with lots of different tastes in mind, and plenty of local options.

Later we got a round of The Cat's Meow from Exhibit 'A' Brewing Company. We picked that one strictly based on the name. (We're both cat people.) While I didn't enjoy it as much as the Darlin's, it was still a solid brew. \\n\\nTo eat, we started with a half dozen oysters.

My party of 3 was 15 minutes late, and the host reminded us that they only hold reservations for 10 minutes, so I guess we were lucky to get seated. She was very nice about it. There were already a few walk-ins lined up at the entrance when we arrived, and I would estimate more than 20 people in line waiting for tables as we left, around 7pm. So be sure to make a reservation, earlier in the evening if available. The restaurant sells a limited number of fish each day (I believe only 100 per day), so even if you've secured a reservation, it's in your best interest to come early, lest they sell out of sauerkraut fish. I was told that at least one week in advance is necessary to get reservations - probably because this restaurant is relatively new. \\n\\nOn food:\\nThe all-Chinese menu is an easy-to-read single sheet (yes!), consisting of sauerkraut fish, the signature dish, and about a dozen small plates. Nearly everything we ordered, including drinks and dessert, was delicious. Not just good, but actually delicious. We had:\\n-sauerkraut fish (of the three sizes we ordered the biggest, which comes with two whole fish): the fish was very fresh; flavour was perfect for me - expect spicy, numbing, and sour all at the same time; one of the best, if not the best, sauerkraut fish I've tasted; I repeat - this is a pretty spicy dish\\n-wood ears (black fungus): nicely marinated, a little spicy\\n-sweet and sour fish pieces: has lots of bones and it's not the easiest to eat, but it's yummy\\n-spicy shredded chicken: great starter, as the spiciness kind of ramps you up to the sauerkraut fish, which has a similar flavour but is a lot spicier\\n-deep fried Chinese dough sticks (youtiao): meh, these were standard\\n-glutinous rice sticks: I didn't actually try this one, but it looked good\\n-baby Chinese cabbage in soup: standard, I liked that they sliced the cabbage really thinly, so I made less of a mess than I usually do eating this dish\\n-watermelon juice: so good I ordered two - fresh with no added sugar, topped with whip cream\\n-dark beer made in house apparently: quite tasty, strong, malty flavour \\n-ice jello with fresh fruit and brown sugar: a must! just a couple spoonfuls of this will help cool down your flaming palate either after or during your meal \\n\\nOn ambience:\\nSat in a super comfy booth (yes!), which even had a nifty drawer containing napkins and cutlery. There are playful signs around the restaurant, and the names of the dishes on the menu are creative and memorable. Environment is comfortable and casual, good place to meet up with a small group of friends. Servers were attentive, friendly, and prompt. \\n\\nOn value:\\nCan't comment on price, since I didn't pay, but honestly I would have happily paid a lot for the meal, based on the quality of the food.

He looks at us with a blank stare and says he will get somebody.  Is this a Spanish restaurant or what? A solid portion of your menu is Grenache. A whole 15 min passed, another person came around and was their version of the least helpful sommelier I've ever met. He didn't ask for the price range, just recommended two of their most expensive grenaches without asking for the price range. Really? \\n\\nIf you expect to order wine, be ready to wait half an hour min. \\n\\n2. DIRTY GLASSES. Dirty wine glasses, twice. Pieces of unknown chunks of residue on the first wine glass, I've asked for another, a different piece of residue. Third time was the charm.\\n\\n3. POOR SEATING.

I love chicken katsu curry and have tried it at many different Japanese restaurants and it's always a safe bet that it will be pretty good. For a restaurant that only sells Japanese curry, this did not deliver. \\n\\n1) Curry has good flavor and spiciness but is too runny and the curry flavor is not very strong. There's also not much in the actual curry to eat, just sauce. \\n2) Chicken Katsu doesn't have enough Panko breading, too thick, and a little dry (not terribly though)\\n\\nCan't judge the service too much since it's a order and sit down type of place and you bus your own table."},{"name":"Miller's Ale House - Orlando East Colonial","address":"2600 E Colonial Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"I typically LOVE the Ale House, but my experience at this location was horrible. I went in and was immediately seated. Then the comedy began. I sat and patiently watched 4 different \\"servers\\" walk past me sitting there at least two times a piece. Only one acknowledged my presence, and that wasn't even to help me. After about 5 minutes (I know because I looked at my watch), someone finally came over, took my drink order, and carded me. She told me she was going to get my waitress and give her my order. About a minute later, my waitress comes over and introduces herself. She didn't bother to do so the other three times she past me, but I digress. She then asks for my ID a second time. I told her I gave it to the other server and she gives me the side eye to which I reply, \\"I'm 42!\\"  I could have had a baby at 21 and that kid would be old enough to drink. So she goes and puts the order in. Mind you, I haven't even put in a food order yet and my menu is closed because I know what I want.

When ordering the cheese board, make sure the server brings enough bread for those sharing it. Four pieces of bread for five people left us puzzled, but our server did bring some more. The food was good but not like the Valentine's meal we had a couple years ago which was amazing. I have since learned that the chefs changed. Although the shrimp linguini was good, no salt was added to the pasta water which would have made the pasta more flavorful. Half of the shrimp was tailed and half was not - was that intentional? We know this to be a good restaurant. The ambiance was nice, the restaurant did not feel crowded, and our meal was leisurely. The server was good and interacted with us. NOTE: if celebrating a special occasion let the server know if you will or will not stay for dessert at the beginning of the meal. We possibly missed out on a surprise from the kitchen. If the server had said, \\"Please do stay - we have something for you\\" we would have absolutely stayed. We did get a nice follow-up call from Adam the GM addressing some of these comments.  Usually in high-end restaurants like this diners expect to see the Chef or someone from the kitchen pass through the dining room to check quality.

Sachi, one of the third generation family members involved in the business, informed me that Monday through Friday, they had a happy hour from 5:30 to 6:30. \\n\\nWe got there around 6:10, just in time for happy hour. We were seated promptly and we opted to sit by the sushi bar. The happy hour special was a great deal as it is $15 for 1 happy hour drink from the happy hour drink menu and 5 menu items from the happy hour food menu. I ordered a sangria drink that was white zinfandel with peach schnapps (it was tasty) with agedashi tofu, panko shrimp, spicy yellowtail roll, seared white tuna, and slow cooked pork. \\n\\nKungfu got the sake of the day for his $5 happy hour drink, and decided to hold off on ordering anything else until we got our happy hour stuff. \\n\\nThe seared white tuna came out first, and it was excellent. Fish was fresh, the ponju sauce didn't overwhelm the fish. After our seared white tuna, we promptly got our spicy yellowtail roll. Very good, the rice wasn't too warm or cold, and the spicy yellowtail was very good. I think I put more emphasis on the rice when it comes to sushi rolls. It's a personal pet peeve when the rice isn't properly seasoned, or if its too hot (it should be room temperature), and if the rice is falling off, I get really irked. The sushi rolls were perfect in every aspect and garnished with sesame seeds. Ah, and another thing, I really hate dyed pickled ginger. It's pink, it's unnatural, and it's much sweeter than the normal non-dyed ginger. I appreciated the fact that they used the good, non-dyed ginger. \\n\\nNext came our agedashi tofu. I love agedashi tofu, and it's really hard to mess it up so this probably isn't a good benchmark for gauging food. I'll go onto talk about the panko shrimp, which I thought was interesting. I love tempura. I've always loved tempura as a kid and I always loved donkatsu (pork cutlets battered  and fried in panko). So, the panko shrimp came with three pieces of panko breaded shrimp with a side of bulldog donkatsu sauce. The shrimp was perfect. It still had that snap effect when you bite into a shrimp that's well cooked, and the breading was a nice golden brown. It was different, and it was good. Then came our slow cooked pork. \\n\\nThe slow cooked pork really reminded me of kalbi jjim (steamed short ribs cooked with vegetables and soy sauce based sauce). I think it was cooked in a similar manner (probably a pressure cooker to speed up the process), with a very similar sauce (usually consisting of soy sauce, shochu or any rice wines, sometimes fruit purees (usually asian pear or apple), and sometimes corn syrup), and they used a good hunk of pork belly with snow peas, carrots, onions, and potatoes in the dish. It was good, it wasn't too salty or sweet  or greasy, which is the biggest problems when it comes to these types of dishes. \\n\\nAfter we finished our happy hour special, we ordered a Two if by Sea roll which has seared scallops on the outside and some other stuff on the inside but the most important part here is the seared scallops on the outside. Oh god, I wasn't very sure or felt too good about it when I ordered it, but it was so good. The seared scallops gave off a nice smoky taste and it was cooked so perfectly and daintily. It's a seasonal item, so I highly recommend this one. I think Kungfu ordered a shrimp roll or did he not? I was already stuffed by this point so I stopped eating. Our waiter brought us a dessert menu at this point, and I was a bit disappointed ot learn they didn't have any traditional Japanese dessert items like taiyaki, dorayaki, etc. \\n\\nWe ordered the green tea creme brulee, and it was really delicious. I wish it had more cream to make it less thick, but no complaints on the taste. It wasn't too sweet or bitter from the green tea powder. It was a nice finish to a great evening. \\n\\nKungfu and I are curious about the hibachi, and he wants to order the Two if by Sea roll again soon, so we'll probably be coming back to dine, for sure."},{"name":"The Copper Rocket","address":"106 Lake Ave","city":"Maitland","stars":"4","text":"Love this place!

We chose this spot from Yelp and saw it had some recent \\"less than excellent\\" reviews.  At the time, it had 2.5/5 stars.  While that was concerning, we thought we would try it anyway. \\n\\nThe restaurant was about half full and we had the opportunity to either sit at the bar or at a table.  We chose a table in the middle of the bar area.  Much to my surprise, on every big screen was the Toronto basketball game.  One small TV had the Winnipeg hockey game (that I could see) and one small screen (that I could see) had the world series game that went 18 innings.  I asked about getting the hockey game on a big screen or at least switching TV's to one closer so we could watch a hockey game.  I was told they can't because they only have 3 boxes controlling all of the tv's (at least 10 TV's).  When the manager (I can only guess) came over as we were paying our bill, he told us the crowd in the restaurant was a big raptors crowd and everyone wanted to see that game.  That was not true as there were very few tables actually watching the game and we noticed that staff seemed more interested in the games that most of the patrons.  While there were some people interested in the game, it certainly was not \\"most of the crowd\\".\\n\\nI will also point out that 3 TV's had broken screens.  One big screen was split with a blue haze on the right half of the screen.  2 other smaller TV's appeared to have black marks on the screens.\\n\\nOn the wall hung a crooked beer poster.  I wasn't sure if it was designed to be like that or if it fell, but figured it was worth noting.  I feel like it went with the atmosphere of leaving things unattended.\\n\\nWhen we asked about local beers to try, the waitress had to ask the bartender which beers were local.  We were surprised by that and thought that the server would at least know which ones were local to Vancouver.\\n\\nSince it was called \\"Wings\\", we figured we would try them even though other reviews mentioned how they were not very good.  We ordered 2 orders of boneless wings.  One was BBQ and one was buffalo.  The boneless wings we got were not very good as we shared them and we all agreed that they tasted like rubber meat.  We finished our drinks and promptly left.  Had the environment been better, we would have stayed much longer and had much more to eat and drink.\\n\\nOne reason I write this is we went up the street to an Irish bar who had a better beer selection, was packed, and of the 6 tv's they had on, they had 4 different things on the TV's.  We all agreed that even though it was an Irish bar, it seemed like a better environment for sports than Wings Granville.\\n\\nIn all honesty, I think this bar has lots of potential to be a great spot.  However, after everything I saw and comparing to other places I have been, I felt like the 2.5 star rating was accurate.  My biggest concern is if I could see those things that were being unattended, what other things (and possibly worse things) are being unattended to that I don't see."},{"name":"Atlanta Breakfast Club","address":"249 Ivan Allen Jr Blvd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"This is old Skool ATL, really enjoyed the atmosphere, the food was OK but the people and place make up the difference.\\n\\nI would recommend..."},{"name":"Park Ave Pizza","address":"119 E Lyman Ave","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4","text":"Approximately 5 months ago,I declared Fridays....

My entree was Vermont Organic Beef Rib-eye a la Poele, which arrived at my table as two minuscule pieces of rib eye (i.e. a few  small bites each) , two sweet potato spears and a small side of creamed spinach--all for $40! I can appreciate the penchant of some restaurants/chefs to concentrate on complex flavors and smaller portions, but I also buy groceries each week:  $40 worth of rib eye could feed several people very well.

Mostly because I tried a few times then gave up, like most do. I wonder if Alton Brown had this much trouble.\\n\\nThanks to my foodie friend Kristin, I was able to get in on a Sunday for a late lunch after months of drooling over other people's pictures and envying their rave reviews. If you work full-time, finding a spot available on the weekends to dine can be quite a feat. Not to mention a splurge. $60 on lunch per person seems a bit insane, but the experience was worth the price tag.\\n\\nWe arrived at 2:00 pm for our reservation but ended up having to wait until 2:30 to be sat. Pro for diners, you aren't rushed out, con if it's your turn you might be waiting with a stomach making velociraptor noises and scaring the people in line for coffee at Lineage.\\n\\nWe hovered closely as we waited our turn and once the time came we saw bright, shining, elated faces emerge from behind the sheer curtain. People literally walked through us as though they were drunk on food.  Side note: Why hasn't Weird Al come out with a Beyonce parody of Drunk in Love to Drunk on Food. Get on that Al!\\n\\nWe did not wait long for our first course (out of 6) which was an appetizer plate filled with goodies.\\n\\nSeared scallops with turnip puree\\nFoie gras with foamed radishes and rice cracker\\nSashimi - Salmon and another fish I did not jot down. (I know for shame)\\nOyster with Rutabaga puree\\n\\nYou will have to forgive my descriptions. They rattle off all the ingredients of each dish, but I certainly did not catch every item nor could I spell them all properly.  I also didn't want to distract from the experience by continually asking as I typed furiously on my phone before eating each dish. Sometimes it's better to just eat and enjoy.  I would actually love it if they produced menu cards with all the ingredients and where they source them from, especially since everything is as local as possible.  What seemed to be the item from furthest away was still in Key West.\\n\\nBack to the food, although I'm not normally a fan of Oysters and Foie Gras, that didn't stop me from devouring each item on my plate. The Salmon was most assuredly the best I've had. It was as smooth as butter.  I also noticed they give you a very small amount of soy sauce, and I'm sure they do that because this fish is so good it doesn't need much else accompanying it.\\n\\nIt's best to note that on Sunday's at Kappo, you are seated to enjoy the courses presented to you. You have no say in what you eat. So if you are not adventurous or have many food allergies to worry about this is probably not the place for you to settle in for two hours.\\n\\nThe next course was a Miso Soup with shellfish & mushrooms. They gave it a really nice foam and it was delicious! Unlike anything I've ever had.\\n\\nNext up was what could have possibly been a dessert course, but was more of a palate cleanser. Fennel, strawberry, Rutabaga with a little tempura.\\nThis dish was great because it was light, had sweetness from the local strawberries, but the tempura gave it such a nice crunchy salty flavor.\\n\\nNext was Sweetbreads.  They were delicious, although I immediately thought of what Sweetbreads actually are and was mildly hesitant. To my delight they were really just like little fried balls of protein with nice flavor, and not all were Sweetbreads, there were some scallops in there as well, along with a nice cucumber pickle puree and tomatoes. Phew!\\n\\nOur last course was a simple dish of seared fresh Salmon on a bed of steamed white rice. It was presented to us, but we were told to wait until one of the chefs came by with a broth that he poured in each of our bowls.\\n\\nYou would think this simple dish wouldn't pack the flavor punch that it did. That' why these people at Kappo are legit.  Even the simplest dishes are powerful.\\n\\nWe were treated to a final dessert course of Matcha ice cream with a Macaroon and strawberries. Again, simple yet so amazing and the perfect end to great dining experience.\\n\\nI would definitely say that Kappo lived up to the hype.  For me, it's more of a treat yo'self meal for special occasions, but I've been told the lunch menu is more wallet friendly and easier to get a seat.\\n\\nAlas if you are looking to book your reservations, the Kappo team is headed back to Japan for the month of March for some R&D, so you will have to wait a little bit longer to get in on this great experience."},{"name":"Row 34","address":"383 Congress St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"My first meal in Boston and it was amazing.

If you cannot find something on that list, the. you are a wine drinker and just leave. Ask if there is a party going on in the cellar and if they isnt, ask if you can see what it looks like. That place is the coolest place in Atlanta when it comes to craft beer. Shelves of the best beers categorized by type and country-origin. The table will instantly grab your eye as it is two big cuts of a tree. (Yes, you can rent it out for a awesome price too).\\n\\nThe food fare will shock you. I remember I ordered the reuben, because I love reubens, and when I took the first bite I immediately thought, \\"this is bar food? Where am I again?\\" The food is very good. The goat cheese fritters get a lot of write-ups and they never disappoint. The salt and vinegar popcorn is an absolute must try. I probably order 3-4 orders of it every time I go here to drink. It is the perfect balance of salt and vinegar where one side doesn't dominate the other. It is the perfect complement to beer and would be my #1 appetizer in Atlanta when it comes to beer pairing. $4.50 per order.\\n\\nThere have been some new additions to the menu and I will start there.

Most poke places are set up similar to Chipotle - you pick a bowl size and fill it up. You start off with the base with some of the current options being carrot rice, brown rice, greens, etc. Then you choose your protein (e.g. raw salmon and tuna), a variety of different vegetables, sauces, and additional garnish at the top. Depending on the bowl size you choose will determine on how many choices you get from each section (base, protein, vegetable, sauce, garnish). To give some perspective, a small bowl will give you two scoops of protein and a large bowl will give you three scoops of protein. After you go through the bar line through each section to create your bowl, you're done! Super quick and easy and fun to make. \\n\\nI personally really like Sweet Tuna because I think they have really fresh ingredients, a good selection, and they give generous scoops of protein than most poke places I've been to.

And you also have to deal with the competing music from Abels on the Lake and the pounding subwoofers of the speedboats.  Mozart's itself has a distinctive smell as well; it's an interesting blend of burnt coffee and sour milk.  Not very pleasant overall.  Certainly not conducive to studying or reading.  \\n\\nThe food looked very tasty.  But there are no healthy alternatives for those of us who don't want to eat a giant bowl of sugar.

The interior has a nice vibe, and you can see the pizzas being made in the open kitchen area. The concept of making your own boards is really cool, and I like being able to pick each component. There's a good variety of \\"pig parts\\" and cheeses to try. I always like the prosciutto, and this last time we also tried the porchetta and pate de campagne, all of which were very good and quite different. Lastly you can add sides such as jams and marinated veggies - I particularly liked the shallot marmalade which is sweet and balances the saltiness of the meats nicely. The boards come with crostini (you'll probably want to ask for more), whole grain mustard, and pickles, which help cut through the richness of the other items. The pizzas here are also great. The Salty Pig pizza again has a wonderful balance of flavors from the salty meats, sweet caramel, and peppery arugula. Overall the pizza toppings are fresh, and the crust is a good consistency - thin and crispy at the edges but chewy inside.

We went back again yesterday, again a Monday afternoon around 1:30pm and were seated right away. \\n\\nWe choose to sit outside and while the view and breeze were lovely, we did not appreciate the two squirrels running around between the grass and the inside of the restaurant. While we certainly understand these are the challenges with outside seating, I would suggest they consider putting in plexli glass between the fence and ground to help keep the squirrels out. \\n\\nOverall, the food was okay. I ordered the chorizo soft taco and a cup of the chicken tortilla soup. The taco had good flavor but the chorizo needed to be drained better. There was lots of oil left on my plate after i was done eating my taco and it was hard to put my taco down as the corn tortilla just got soggy from the oil. Easy to tell it was not cooked fresh and they just scooped it from a container. The tortilla soup was very think. Almost felt like they used a verde sauce as the base. Good flavor and loved the fresh avocados in the soup. The bowl my soup was served it was fine but the plate had what looked like dried guac on it. i notified the server and he brought me out a new soup but we also noted two of the glasses on the table for water felt sticky.\\n\\nMy friend got The Brooklyn tacos which was three tacos piled high with pork belly, pulled pork and other pork stuff. The flavor was decent but majority of the pork belly was just fat. There was also nothing fresh to cut through the heaviness - he ended up getting a side of pico just to add because the pure protein approach was too much. \\n\\nOverall, the experience was okay.

The blackened pasta was too salty, they did not cut our cake and when we asked for extra small plates they said that they didn't have anymore and gave us small to go boxes instead. Definitely not a place to go for a birthday dinner environment cause it smells off cause of the smoking that was going on and it's more of a bar then a restaurant so don't expect much. Our waitress didn't bring water for everyone and then she kept leaving without taking all of our orders first so it took 30 minutes to finally get all of our orders in because of the lack of attention to our group.

Lots of metal, Its a cool spot with huge ceilings , well placed boom boxes and mirrors throughout the walls. The bar looked was particularly inviting, modern and chic. The setting overall intimate and dark almost akin to a lounge. I'm a huge fan of 90's hit hop and there was no shortage of it.

Revelry sells itself as Korean inspired Asian fusion. There aren't many Korean places on the east side of the river, and I'm always weary of Asian fusion places. We tried 2 dishes, the kimchi pancakes ($12) and the short rib rice bowel ($16). The pancakes were tiny, overdone (burnt) and in my opinion, they are much cheaper and rich tasting. Its an appetizer priced as a main dish. As for the rice bowel, the ribs weren't your typical Kalbi, rather a piece of steak marinated in bulgogi- esque sauce. It was pretty tasty and tender, though the rest of it is essentially a fancy bibimbop bowl ( not sure how I felt Daikon which has a tart taste), also small. Left hungry, and didn't feel inclined to spend more for Americanized Korean food that left much to be desired.  \\n\\nService: Very young serving group.
