The main dining room is the \\"dance hall\\" room, complete with beautiful chandeliers and snow falling outside of the windows.

Once during the week and today, on a Sunday.  They have those amusement park winding lines for a reason... and lunchtime is it.\\n\\nTypically, a solid four star experience.  The burgers are tasty, you have your choice of red, white, yellow (ketchup, mayo, mustard) or any combo of the three.  You also have your choice of veggies, which they do not skimp on at all.  It makes for a messy, but thoroughly tasty burger.  Fries are awesome and fresh cut (I'm guessing in the morning, I couldn't imagine them cutting fries during the impressively awful lunch rush).  The tables are well stocked with seasonings, including Mediterranean Sea Salt and Lowry's Season-All.  Top it off with some \\"curious handwashing technolology\\" and you have a solid four star experience.\\n\\nOn the downside, there are no combo meals, so you pay full price for your burger and the fries and the drink.  It makes things a little more expensive and kind of tedious.  But, the awful lunch rush is the reason I took off the fourth star.

It is not a 'couples night out'. You are surrounded by kids. Kids crying, kids yelling, kids doing what kids do. It is all fine - just know it's not 'romantic'. It's like any other Disney eatery. The review that mentions this as a 'best place for a couple to celebrate their something special' must have had a 10pm reservation. Ours was at 6pm.\\n\\nThis is key - the food is very good for Disney food - however it is not so good if you compare it to your home town high end restaurant.  So remember, the prices are high but the food is just OK. Comparing it to a good restaurant is like comparing a 'cook' prepared meal to a 'chef' prepared meal. This is 'cook' prepared meals. Still good - but nothing special for the price.\\n\\nThe price is $50-$70 per person w/o drinks or desert. \\n\\nThe bottom line is this, if you weren't at Disney you wouldn't think this restaurant was worth a second look.

The tall ceilings and floor to ceiling windows around the front of the restaurant make it feel open and outdoorsy and the flowers really add to that feeling. Add to that the table full of decanters by the front door and it's just an outstanding look and feel, especially for fine dining...it wasn't stuffy or pretentious at all.\\n\\nThe food was extremely good and the service was great. Our waitress was a bit shy, but very kind, quick and informative without being a hoverer. They first brought us a complimentary amuse bouche which came in three parts: a chilled soup (amazing, and I HATE chilled soups), a \\"golden bag\\" (something very tasty stuffed inside wonton/filo wrappers and then deep fried...um, yes) and a parmesan cheese crisp topped with homemade, whipped ricotta cheese (I would like it if they could just sell those...they were INSANE). Everybody loves free food, and everybody especially loves free food when it's not only super cute to look at but just incredibly decadent and delicious.\\n\\nWe then moved on to the first of our Quattro Piatti. I started with the gazpacho. Yes, that's right. I HATE chilled soup, but it was tomato and cucumber with burrata cheese...and gazpacho was in quotes, so I threw caution to the wind. It was just delectable. Perfectly chilled and SO refreshing, with a few crunchy pieces of cucumber throughout what was a bowl of tomato-ey goodness. For my second course I had the spaghetti with sea urchin, which was so flavorful and delicious and just the right portion. It had a nice heat to it and that wonderful deep sea flavor from the sea urchin.  I scarfed it down happily and prepared for my next course. Then out came the quail, served with Poularde liver, apples, and cipollini onions. The quail was perfectly crisp on the outside and moist on the inside. The liver was fatty and delicious to a point that I question its legality, while simultaneously wondering why I can't eat it every day. The apples added a bright, crispness to the dish and helped cut through all the richness of both the quail and the liver. All in all, a fabulous dish. For dessert I had the Zabaione alla Limetta. To be honest, I have no idea what was in it other than compressed watermelon and canteloupe, but it was delicious. I'm typically a \\"chocolates for dessert\\" type person, but the zabaione was a lighter option after such a heavy meal, and it certainly didn't disappoint. \\n\\nIf you have the opportunity to go to Frasca, you'd be a fool not to!

I went on a Pacific Northwest road trip earlier this summer and looked up a few places in Portland that were featured on Food Network's Diners, Drive-ins and Dives.  As far as I'm concerned, anything that has Guy Fieri's stamp of approval is good enough for me.  This place is visited by locals and visitors alike, and for damn good reason.  This place is legit.          \\n\\nThe menu boasts a plethora of biscuit sandwich combos, biscuit + spreads/gravy, and sides.  Everything looked so tempting and I would have ordered a sampler of all the items on the menu, but alas, we had to decide on a select few.  What we tried:   \\n\\nThe Reggie:  Moist fried chicken and crispy flavorful bacon sandwiched between a biscuit, blanketed in their special sausage gravy.  Each bite consisted of a chewy biscuit morsel, complemented nicely by the savory gravy, which perfectly balanced the crunch of the bacon and fried chicken.  I really have no words to describe how mouthwatering the gravy is, you'll just have to try it for yourself.  I think my cholesterol went up 15 points thinking about it!  (see posted photos to increase your cholesterol, too!)\\n\\nThe Money Ball: A biscuit drenched in the sausage gravy topped with an egg over easy.  Not quite as heavy duty as The Reggie, but easily just as good if you're not digging the meat.    \\n\\nHash up: hash browns (shredded potatoes, one of my fave breakfast foods) with onions, mushrooms, country ham, and cheddar.  A solid addition to the biscuit specials.  Definitely big enough for a group to split if you're each getting your own biscuit sandwich goodness.         \\n\\nAtmosphere/Service: Pine State Biscuits is overflowing with charm. The place is a small, hole-in-the-wall with limited seating, but the \\"rules of pine state\\" request that you be considerate to those waiting for tables.  Most patrons are courteous and bus their tables as soon as they are done eating and don't lolly gag/chit chat.  Good stuff. \\n\\nDefinitely not your friend if you're on a diet, but oh so worth it if you accidentally let yourself splurge (don't worry, I won't tell).

I couldn't help it; inner eye rolling ensued.\\n\\nThe menu is very simple.  Don't expect poblanos or avocado or any of them fancy ingredients.  You can basically choose from a hamburger, a cheeseburger, or a chili dog - with or without cheese.  Burgers come with the standard fixings, and you're supposed to say, \\"Red,\\" \\"Yeller\\" or \\"White\\" depending on whether you want ketchup, mustard or mayo.  You can add bacon or jalapenos for an upcharge.  That's about the range of entrees.\\n\\nThey also have crinkle cut fries ($1.89), which are skinny, but sadly limp - which is unforgiveable when it comes to skinny fries, IMO.  The burgers, while reasonably large for the price (1/2 lb for $4.95), were greasy and virtually flavorless.  Not impressed.\\n\\nDecor is very sterile, and weirdly hospital-like.  It's a single room with high ceilings, fluorescent lighting, and a TV in the corner that, sound-wise, dominates the room and makes it seem like the place is filled with TV-watching zombies.  The tables are mostly set up in long, family-style rows, so if you happen to sit next to somebody friendly (as opposed to a TV-watching zombie), you may find yourself engaged in conversation with a stranger.\\n\\nAlso hospital-like, but in this case, it's kind of cool:  they have a sterile hand-washing station like something you might see in a wafer fab - where you stick your hands in two holes and water mixed with sterilizer comes spraying out (the sign says, \\"It's like a jacuzzi for your hands!\\").  It's good for getting kids excited about washing their hands; they even have \\"I have clean hands!\\" stickers next to the station.\\n\\nOK, and the kicker?  The men's room is outfitted with giant one-way glass windows looking out into the dining room.  It's mirrored from the dining room side so nobody can see in, but you can't tell that from the inside, which seems completely twisted to me.\\n\\nLike I said.

And several times, drunken teenagers mistook our room for the bathroom and stumbled part way in before being ripped back into the hallway by their friends.\\n\\nOur waitress was not very nice. She left us sitting with just drinks for about a half hour. When we asked if we could get some complimentary bread to hold us over, she sort of snapped back with 'I'll be bringing it in a moment.' She never once apologized for the slow service, but she did give a few excuses throughout the night. PS, the family drink is a Manhattan. These Manhattans were embarrassingly small and weak. They might as well have come in shot glasses.\\n\\nThe pace picked up after we ordered. It seemed like hardly any time passed before we got our entrees. Our waitress, luckily got a little help at this point in the meal. I couldn't believe that up until then, she had been expected to serve all twenty-five of us on her own. But the bad thing is that most of the servers smelled overwhelmingly liked cigarette smoke. Unappetizing.\\n\\nI got the Shrimp and Scallop Parmagiana. The shrimp was unfreshly fishy. The scallops were small and tasteless. The food definitely looked better than it tasted - except for Loren's which was drizzled in bright orange sauce. I didn't hear anyone who really said they loved what they ordered. Only one of us in my section of the table got dessert. When asked how the cheesecake was, Edan nicely stated, 'It's a B...'\\n\\nWhen we walked back out, through the main part of the restaurant, I thought the decor was nice. And there was a piano player that sounded pretty good playing a One Republic song.\\n\\nBut, overall, this was a unfortunately bad experience. It was seriously like something out of an SNL skit, and all night, we kept reminding ourselves out loud 'This is real life. This is really happening.'

But alas I cannot. I have given the place two tries and will never go again.  The interior is absolutely beautiful and that is what got the two stars. Everything else however was a great big disappointment. The starters that my friends and I ordered all came out of the kitchen cold and very obviously pre-prepped and then nuked in the microwave (yuck). My friends and I all ordered entrees as well.  I thought I would go with a nice pan seared grouper with mashed potatoes and steamed veggies, but that is not at all what I got. Instead I was served a soggy not fresh pre-prepped (which seems to be the case with everything)fried piece of I think grouper along with cold mashed potatoes and julienne sliced veggies that were boiled to the point that they became like veggie colored spaghetti  all placed on an icy cold white dish.  Come on people searing a piece of fish and steaming some veggies is not hard.  The one thing I can say though is that I got a dish. One of my friends however was served her burger and fries in a red plastic basket.(yes the plastic basket that was mentioned in one of the other reviews) I never saw a child's list on the menu but apparently they thought they were serving a child.  I am not going in to all of the details of everyone's meal but suffice it to say none of us were happy about the food. Our server was... not bad... but pretty much absent, not only from our table but in personality as well. Try a smile once and a while folks it does wonders. The whole thing about this place is that it was exciting to get a new cool bar restaurant in the area but unless they get one of the chefs from the other places they own and some fire under the asses of the lack luster staff I as well as my friends will not go back and do not recommend you waste your money either.

The staff attitude was nice-with-a-whiff-of-Northwest-haughty, which was strange given the congenial lunch atmosphere.  The rosemary was so overused it was medicinal.

Doesn't feel too comfortable for the small space. \\n\\nFor my overall food experience here, some definitely worked better than the other. The appetizer butter bread was deliciously and freshly made. We probably all had more than needed. Soup and salad were both okay. But salad did taste like those you would prepare at home. Chicken Alfredo was a little weak. Chicken was dry and the sauce to me was relatively plain. It tasted fine but I feel like I was expecting something more. Lasagna was good but not great. Served on a smaller serving compared to most Italian restaurants. My favorite part was the pesto chicken pizza. It's was the highlight of the meal. Really fresh, tasty, and the pesto sauce was on point - not too much or too little. Pizza was not greasy which I enjoyed a lot and didn't feel guilty to eat! Crust was slightly crunchy but soft at the same time. I would definitely get it again. \\n\\nOf course I still ordered the dessert, their bread pudding was just mediocre. Won't recommend (especially if you are already full from the main dishes). I think this place work well if you are looking for a place to dine with family, but if you have a bigger family, reservation is recommended."},{"name":"Be Our Guest Restaurant","address":"Magic Kingdom Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"I'm not sure I understand how this place gets good reviews.

That also took around 30 minutes to come out of the kitchen even though there were many empty tables.\\n\\nSo I've mentioned the service, but the food was even worse.\\n\\nWe ordered the Brick and Fire Classic, the signature of this restaurant, size XL. I think it's important to note the size because that may have had something to do with the quality of the food. When our pizza came out the dough was only very lightly cooked and too thin in the middle to hold the toppings. It was thinner than a soft tortilla and because of all the toppings was very soggy. \\n\\nWe finally showed our server and she agreed that this was not acceptable and promised a new pizza asap. 45 minutes later she brought out the next pizza. It was not much better than the first, and half of it was resting on a bed of black chunks of burnt corn meal - as large as a pancake. When we showed these to our server she said that is nothing to worry about as from time to time large pieces of burnt cornmeal come off of the oven and wind up under the pizza.\\n\\nUnfortunately this was a missed opportunity for them to just make things right but they totally blew it. \\n\\nI may try them again because I so badly wanted to love them, but I won't get an XL for sure."},{"name":"Sage Woodfire Tavern - Atlanta","address":"3050 Windy Hill Rd SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"THIS WAS THE WORST EXPERIENCE I HAVE EVER HAD!\\n\\nWe decided to have dinner for our anniversary at Sage and it was HORRIBLE.

Working in the WPV leaves very few wallet-friendly options for on-campus lunches ($15 is usually the minimum). I eat my fair share of cheap and delicious pizza but sometimes a gal needs a healthy(ish) option. Enter Lime Fresh Mexican Grill, the latest addition to the village, taking the place of greasy old Johnny Rockets. \\n\\nI was pleasantly surprised to find this was an order-at-the-counter establishment, as the surrounding options (excluding the pizza place) all have servers, adding at least a $3 tip to the already costly bill. The interior is a tad fancier than other Mexican joints but still fitting for a burrito place. The chain was started in South Beach, so the theme here is \\"healthy\\" although I couldn't find any nutritional info online. I was pleased to find a Skinny Burrito ($7.99) and Lite Quesadilla (small $5.49; grande $7.99) on the menu, as well as whole wheat tortillas, low-carb options and vegetarian dishes. I ordered the sort-of-healthy-but-not-really Nudie Burrito ($7.99), a generous portion of rice, along with chicken (claimed to be \\"humanely raised\\"), organic black beans (or refried, your choice), cheese, sour cream and pico de gallo. Also, everything -- even nudie burritos and salads -- comes with tortilla chips, which also decreases the healthy factor. There is a salsa bar, where I sampled the salsa asada and salsa suave. Both were okay but I really dug the fresh pico that came with my bowl. We also sampled the guacamole, which wasn't party-in-my-mouth, drop-dead amazing but definitely respectable.\\n\\nThere were servers which was a little odd (although I guess it's the same model as Tijuana Flats) who were constantly coming by to offer drink refills and take dishes out of the way.

All-in-all, I liked the experience and will definitely go back to try the skinny options.

Their open hours (11am-11pm, every day) are - when viewed separately - a welcome change from the typical Wellesley joint (being open past 7pm is too late for most venues).\\n\\nIt took thirty minutes for us to receive one small calzone. I hope that this poor service is merely a side effect of it being a new business, because if they don't get their act together, that kind of service isn't going to fly in this town.\\n\\nI'm sure Old School will be popular with families, Wellesley kids, teens, Tweens, and anyone who doesn't get panic attacks from claustrophobic seating, customers, and d√©cor. Certainly, there were tons of folks in this demographic running around in there when we went. If they had a maximum of one-third the items decorating the place, it would be nearly enjoyable. Particularly if it didn't feel like I was about to get decapitated by falling G. I. Joe dolls and LPs hanging by a (literal) thread. \\n\\nI can safely say that there is nowhere else like this in Wellesley."},{"name":"Starlight Casino","address":"350 Gifford Street","city":"New Westminster","stars":"2.5","text":"Really cool casino and facilities, restaurants are great and plenty of parking."},{"name":"Grainmaker","address":"91 Summer St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Relatively tasty food but...

All of the drinks I have tried on the two occasions I visited (margaritas and a mimosa) were less than tasty and sadly weak. I wanted to try the \\"Cheese Crisp\\", but after reading the description, I came to the conclusion that this was not going to be anything like the Arizona Cheese Crisps that I came to love. Sounded more like it would become a cheese soggy with all the unneeded toppings. I thought about asking them to exclude the tomatoes, onions, green chilis (these are actually ok on a cheese crisp, and traditional), sweet peppers, salsa and crema, but decided that would be a HUGE waste of $12. $12 for a cheese crisp... HA! No.  \\n\\nAfter spending over $50 for lunch, on a Sunday, for two of us (and only one of us had an alcoholic beverage), my boyfriend and I have decided that Pica's is the only redeemable Mexican food in Louisville (so far).

It was nice because there weren't a ton of younger kids running around, which can obviously be a distraction at Walt Disney World. One thing to keep in mind, when you arrive for your reservation, you will probably be sat a little later than your scheduled time. It's not a big deal, maybe 5 or 10 minutes after. Once the beast arrives into the room, people flock to get a picture, so that adds a little time to your wait since people are finishing and paying out as quickly. \\n\\nOnce you enter, you will not be disappointed with the atmosphere or decor. The structure itself is impressive, and the inside is decorated beautifully. It's elegant, but not over-the-top to the point where you feel underdressed after a day in the parks. It is also a large dining room, you you don't feel like a sardine, which can happen from time to time in some of their other establishments. \\n\\nOnce your food comes, your night is made. The food is fresh and prepared perfectly. I had a steak with vegetables and truffle oil fries, and they were unreal. The portions were a nice size as well. The dessert was also delicious (of course we tried the Grey Stuff and it was great), and when we got the bill, I was surprised with the value. If you think you can get a quality steak anywhere, much less at Walt Disney World, for less than $30, you are setting yourself up for disappointment. $30 for a steak is a very fair price, and after the quality of my meal, I was more than happy to pay it. Two drinks, two entrees, and a dessert came to about $70, which is par for the course. I've spent as much at many other restaurants for food that wasn't nearly as good, so this was not an issue for me. \\n\\nWalt Disney World and their staff really knocked one out of the park with this one.

After 3 sips I quietly asked the waitress to send it back for something else, and I got the third degree on why I didn't like and and why it wasn't her fault I didn't like it or that I had been forgotten for 30 minutes while trying to order a drink. \\n\\nShe was convinced the owner wouldn't take it off, and true to form the owner agreed to only refund 50% - after they threw away my full drink.

We order the food and sit down, when it arrives, both dishes were ice cold. Also, my poached eggs were so overcooked they were not even edible. I did speak to someone about both dishes being cold but no one ever came back over, so we ate the cold crap on our plates.

When asking I was told \\"the Master is still sleeping and doesn't wake up until dinner at 5PM.\\" Even though I'm 28 years old, this really ticked me off, I made the reservation here specifically because I was told it was the only place in Disney to meet the Beast and I was told he would be there during breakfast when making the reservation. This was pretty much the breaking point for me and I asked to speak to a manager. The manager, Will, came out and immediately apologized for the entire experience. He refunded my $51 for the terrible breakfast, gave me a card to come back to see the Beast later at 5PM and also gave us 2 complimentary fast passes to use on any ride. Even though it was annoying that I was going to have to come back to Magic Kingdom again later that night to meet the Beast, I felt Will did a great job on rectifying the situation. I felt much better about the awful breakfast once I got a full refund and the fast passes being thrown on was a nice gesture as well. 5 Stars for Wills customer service but unfortunately the restaurant itself only gets 2 from me and the 2 stars is solely on the fact that it really is pretty and something to see."},{"name":"Sugidama Soba & Izakaya","address":"260 Elm St, Ste 106","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"I've never been a fan of soba but the boy wanted to try this place out.

I'm not a big, guy, mind you, but I run marathons and power lift in the winters and generally eat about 4 eggs every morning when I'm bulking. The Gaston's feast must have comprised of two eggs, max, a couple links of sausage, and potatoes. I just want to mention that I hate potatoes and don't eat them unless they've been turned into fries. The cost for me to make this myself would have been about $1, and the meal ended up easily over $100 for my wife and two small kids. Thankfully, we had the Disney Dining plan, but frankly my quick services were spent far better in every other place we ate, no questions asked. \\n\\nLook, if you are all about the aesthetic feel of the place and want the experience of eating in the Beasts castle, have at it. I've never even watched the whole movie. I went for the wife and kids, and I expected that paying $30-$50 a plate all week should fill me up on my last week before cutting. I left hungry and annoyed instead that I'd been highly ripped off. Whatever, the rest of the trip was overall pretty awesome. \\n\\nFinally, the \\"grey stuff\\" everyone is going nuts about is an oreo dream whip pie on a very small cupcake.

I went here yesterday because the reviews for this place were really good, and I hadn't had Indian food in ages. It's small, next to what appears to be a school, and is some kind of home school service. \\n\\nThere are physical menus (in English) and a few small monitor screens on the wall (not in English). Maybe about 20 people here on a Wednesday night. I saw the butter chicken, and thought about it, but wanted to try something new. I wish I hadn't, though. If you want rice for certain dishes, it's an additional cost, but make sure your dish doesn't come with it. Portions are small, and the price is relatively mid-range. When you get Naan, you get two slabs. When you get rice, it's about 2 cups, and your entr√©e is about a cup. Food comes in plastic wear and soup containers.\\n\\nPARKING / MISC DIRECTIONS:\\nMaybe 5 spots in front, but there's a lot if you go (one-way) to the left. Actually an entrance to the restaurant through the little portcullis that's situated on the sidewalk. You can smell the heavenly scents before you even go in. Ahhhh. Those poor kids, constantly smelling that delicious food.\\n\\nPROS:\\nDelicious, full-flavored food. Like the butter chicken was a solid 5 star experience.\\nPerfect amount of spices--not super spicy, but spicy enough that the food really shown.\\nMid-range in terms of cost. Small portions, but food is around $5-6.\\n\\nCONS:\\nBurnt Naan. Like baaaadly. (see images)\\nThe service was kind of... cold. Like \\"Move to the right side.

About half the \\"meat\\" ended up being large chunks of bones.\\n\\nVERDICT:\\nThis food is seriously delicious. GET THE BUTTER CHICKEN. It has full flavors, perfect blend of spices, SO FREAKIN' GOOD. Not only was it the portion size what held me back from a full 5 star experience, but the fact that the entr√©e I got (the mutton) just didn't hold up to 5 stars.

I walked up to the food station to place my order but like a lot of other Yelp reviews, the tall glass between the customer and the person behind the counter makes it nearly impossible to hear each other.  I had to keep yelling my order and I kept asking the guy behind the counter what he was saying.\\nAnyway, I successfully ordered my poke bowl where I got the white rice base, salmon and spicy tuna for the proteins and added various toppings.  I even paid a dollar extra for the tobiko. I got the regular size bowl and it was a bit on the small side.\\n\\nNevertheless, I was excited to try this poke bowl when I got back to my office.  But as soon as I dug in, I was thoroughly disappointed.  The toppings were just laid on top of each other and not mixed together like other poke places.  The fish was not marinated and they were not cut properly so pieces of salmon were stuck together. And I don't know why but it was also stringy??? The cucumbers were not sliced well and were ALSO stuck together. So I'd have to take giant bites of cucumber when I'm eating this. \\nThe lettuce was not fresh...I mean, there were some pieces that have turned brown. \\nAs for the rice, it was NOT cooked properly!! It was way undercooked and made it hard to chew. How can you mess up the rice?????? \\n\\nAnyway, needless to say, I am not going to be  back.

The flavor of the soup hit the pallet nicely. It was still good.\\n\\nEntr√©es: She ordered the center cut filet mignon. It was wonderful. The filet was cooked perfectly and very succulent. The filet was juicy in every bite and the potatoes (mashed) added a nice touch of flavor and consistency with the steak. I wish I would have ordered this.\\n\\nI on the other hand, ordered the spice dusted lamb chops. I was not a fan of the sides that came with it has it's an acquired taste for the vegetables that are served with it. However, the lamb was cooked nicely and had a nice savory flavor. The sauce with it was very good and wished they would have drizzled a little more on the lamb to add more flavor. \\n\\nDessert: The dessert trio had an adorable and was presented very nicely. I don't really have complaints on this as everything served was wonderful. The \\"gray stuff\\" served in the white chocolate \\"chip\\" cup was my favorite. It was truly amazing! As for the almond macaroon and the dark chocolate truffle was just enough chocolate, that it wasn't too over powering with sweet! The stained class decor the dessert was placed on is edible, so that made it even more fun! \\n\\nAs for the finale. Meeting the Master, the Beast! This moment was one of my favorites because it lit my girlfriend's face up and put a huge smile on her face! The Beast was a gentleman and very welcoming. Not to mention he gave the best hugs.

Apparently, you're supposed to make reservations right when they open - 6 months in advance.  But never fear!!  Go to the restaurant RIGHT when it opens and see if there are any openings/cancellations.  Luckily, my friends and I were able to snag one.  We had to wait on the drawbridge (because conveniently, that was the only place it would work) for 45 minutes (I have the bestest friends ever, obviously).  Once the beeper went off, we were led into the castle.  One lucky person got to hold the candlestick holder (!!) as the host led you to your table, giving you a mini-tour of the restaurant on the way. \\nThe restaurant is split up into different rooms of the castle - the ballroom, the study, etc.  The detail is amazing.  We sat in the ballroom and got to admire the beautifully painted ceiling, the chandelier, and the \\"snow\\" that was falling outside the windows (seriously.  DETAILS!!).  I got onion soup and the gray stuff (which was really the only thing I wanted).  The gray stuff = mousse, which was good.  \\n\\nWhen you're done eating, you can walk around and explore the other rooms and on your way out, take a picture with the Beast himself!!\\n\\nIf you're a fan of \\"Beauty and the Beast\\"/classic Disney, just GO."},{"name":"Mighty Fine Burgers Fries & Shakes","address":"10515 N Mo-Pac Expy, Ste 105","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"\\"Have you had a Mighty fine burger?\\", \\"Mighty Fine is the best\\", \\"You have to try Mighty fine!\\"  \\"See why Mighty Fine is the best burger in the best city in the best state in the country.\\" NOT EVEN CLOSE!!!!!\\n\\nFirst off I'm not going to bash this joint, because the burgers are average.

Need a reservation and there's free parking after you show your reservation to the parking attendant. \\n\\nThe restaurant is inside animal kingdom's lodge. Very gorgeous, woodsy, elegant rustic design.  They have live music and African drum shows kind of in the main foyer, not entirely in the dinner room.  You can definitely hear it throughout the place.  During the musical show, I believe African women are dancing to the beat of the drums. Please don't get upset if I get some ethnicity facts wrong.  We rushed over here for a very late dinner after spending over 13 hrs at Disney parks.  We arrived late in the evening and probably missed a lot of things going on inside and had no time to explore.  \\n\\nThe food is wonderful.  I had pork belly - it was extremely juicy and fall of the bones, melt in your mouth.  The sauce reminded me closely of Vietnamese houston sauce.  Lots of Asian flavors and I love it.  It was my favorite entree that matched my taste buds. It was so rich I did not finish it and had it for leftovers the next day, not a good idea. It did not reheat well at all.   The veggies that accompanied it were perfect! \\n\\nWild boar app - another fav and would def get again.  So delicious! \\n\\nMy friend had the wagyu beef. It was extremely tender and juicy. Perfect cut.  I preferred this cut of meat over my pork belly but preferred my entree's sauce more.  So it's hard to decide which plate I liked more.  \\n\\nDessert- the chocolate themed one.  Amaaaazziiinngggg!!! We loved everything on it! If you like chocolate mousse, get this! \\n\\nA couple things that lowered my rating: \\nMy drink Victoria Falls- it was sweet, light and fruity.   Too sweet and Tooo light.  Almost like there was no alcohol and I was drinking fruit flavored sprite.  I was quite disappointed with it, I didn't finish it.  \\n\\nSecond, Most of the plates were a bit too salty.   Some were inedible and was returned (my friends pasta side). All the meats and sauces were on the salty side.  So later on I was downing the water by the jug.  \\n\\nThe service is superb.  Of course I feel like it's a Disney thing.  They're there to make you feel like you're in the happiest place on earth.  Our waiter was attentive and helpful.   \\n\\nPrice point is where I'm hesitant to come back for not being, Omg! This was amazeballs and the most amazing thing I ever had! Apps ran about $20 each.   Mini starters/entrees- $30ish.  Entrees around $50 each.  Drinks $15ish.  Desserts- $20ish.  I can't remember verbatim.  But I do remember spending almost $100 on myself.  that was sharing an appetizer and dessert with my friend.  \\n\\nI normally reserve that price point for Michelin restaurants.  I want to feel amazed and wowed and have a food porn experience.  I just didn't get that here.  Most things were good.  Some great.  But a couple things were not good.

The shrooms were cut a little thick for my taste (not sure they were fresh).  The crust was nice and crisp without being too crackery.  The sauce had a nice zing to it.  All in all, while Ohio-style pizza is not my favorite, Villa Nova makes a pretty darn good one.\\n\\nWhile not technically on the menu, I also obtained our traditional side of meatballs ($1.50 a pop).  Damn those were good!  The sauce was truly robust - nice and thick with awesome herbiness and a slight sweet note on the finish.

I've taken a couple of out of town friends here, and they go back home craving their flavored mojitos and martinis. In their words, \\"They are to die for.\\" In addition to their drinks, their food is pretty good as well. I usually go for their chicken enchiladas w/verde sauce, and haven't been disappointed once. PLus I'm also a fan of their two salsas. Only thing I can't comment on is their smoking room, being as I don't smoke. yea sorry to disappoint. In regards to service, it's never been bad, both from bartenders or table waitstaff. Having moments when you can have a smalltalk conversation w/your waiter/waitress while waiting for others to decide on what they want adds a bit of a personal touch to it. Especially when their recommendations prove good, which has occured many times. As far as parking, sometimes that can be a bit of a hassle, considering there are several dining places within that area. Oh and do try not to park under the trees, because chances are you will be stopping by a car wash on the way home due to the massive presents the birds leave behind.

There are dishes inspired from different African countries and a lot of the workers are from different countries in Africa as well! \\n\\nOur server was Jamal, and he was amazing! He got all of our orders, was personable, did special requests, and was just overall nice! Try their special juice..I forgot what its called but it's so good and since its a buffet, try everything! They have soups ,salads, meats, pasta, etc. It was all good, and they have American dishes as well. They are vegan friendly too and will actually make you a special vegan dish if you ask!  Definitely Disney 5 star service.\\n\\nThe desserts were amazing as well and at night they do a sort of drum circle with chants and dancing Lol it was a lot of fun.

I live in downtown Orlando and I don't go to Disney unless I am forced. So I am not the usual person who would be eating here or loving all things Disney or comparing Jiko to other Disney restaurants. But since I spent some hours and a sum of money here, I might as well summarize.\\n\\nSo, I guess this building is supposed to be something like a British lodge in colonial Africa. Why that is something we would want to have recreated for us, given the ugliness of that history, I am really not sure. But a lot of people seem to love it, so what do I know? There is a Pinterest site devoted to recreating British colonial design, so I seem to be in the minority in being offended by faux British sitting rooms filled with faux artifacts that faux colonizers brought back from Africa. I am also the only reviewer to be offended by the fact that Disney gathered all their brown employees together and dressed them in \\"African\\" garb and had them play the drums and pretend to be \\"African\\" as they welcome guests to Jiko. Our server, while brown, was clearly Pakistani and not from any part of Africa. \\n\\nBut no one else seemed bothered by any of that. So, onward with the review.\\n\\nThe restaurant is cavernous and decorated in dark woods. Basically, an African-themed Cheesecake factory. The menu consists of fish and ribs and lamb, all purportedly prepared according to some version of some African country's recipe. The fish I ordered was actually good and cooked well, and the stuffed squash blossom was delicious, but $40 was excessive. \\n\\nI will say that our service was truly excellent. Ron knew his wine, and was friendly and attentive without smothering us. Everything was timed well, and the service was well-coordinated, as you would expect of Disney.\\n\\nWould I go back? Not unless my Disney-loving friend had another important life event to celebrate. But if you are at Disney and eating rubber chicken and tater tots (or whatever it is that people eat at Disney), then this is probably a nice break. Not quite sure how to give appropriate stars for: offensive and overpriced, but well executed. Extra star for a nice hot towel service, though."},{"name":"Gami Sushi","address":"10111 Number 3 Road, Suite 126","city":"Richmond","stars":"3.5","text":"We ordered the roll combo, spicy tuna combo and black dragon roll.\\n\\nBlack Dragon Roll\\nUnagi is on top of the sushi.

The chicken is better than the lamb there in my opinion. And the hummus, it's to die for! The pita comes out of the oven, right to your table. And it's unlimited.\\n\\nThe service is very friendly, they get a little mixed up sometimes, but they are nice about it. Anyone that has ever been there knows the owner, he greets each table, comes over to you during your meal, pats you on the back, thanks you for coming in, GREAT guy. And he pays tribute to his parents on the menu and on the website. I like that.\\n\\nNotice I said I really LIKED Habibi for their chicken shawarma plate ... that's because I am vegan now. Goodbye chicken shawarma, hello artichoke heart casserole. I can still eat the hummus with the nonstop fresh pita bread, but now that meat is not an option, I was shocked to see all the vegan options Habibi has to offer. And vegetarian too. Clearly labeled and easy to find. And not just one or two things, a bunch of options!\\n\\nThey get 4 out of 5 stars because they still are a little spendy compared to other Lebanese restaurants/carts in the area. But they just did a big remodel to their restaurant, so I get that they are trying to class the place up. It's worth the extra $1 or 2 for the unlimited pita. (As you may have noticed, I am very impressed by any restaurant that provides a constant stream of carbs.)"},{"name":"Spice Modern Steakhouse","address":"407 E Central Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"3","text":"My experience was so much different from most people. We went last Thursday with my brother that was in town. We actually prefer to go to the Winter Park location and were pretty disappointed when we found out that it was close for good.

Perhaps now that it is the only location they might spend a bit more effort to make this place a great restaurant to come. \\n\\nOur waiter was great, gave us wines bottle suggestions and was very quick at every request we had. We started with a house salad,... OMG so delicious! That was my favorite of all night, greens, cucumbers and a mango dressing that I want to still and take it home. We also had the mussels appetizer and it was just ok. We couldn't get over the salad.

Why do you ask? The answer is simple. EVERYTHING about this place is awkward. \\n\\nLet us Begin.\\n\\nThe Bar: Awkward. The art on the walls is awkward (apologies to the artist, I'm sure it's only awkward given the already awkward ambiance it contributes to). The space is wide open but not in a fun, lofty kind of way. Without enough people in the restaurant, I'm sure our voices would likely create an echo. I suppose the strange techno-porn music solves this problem as well (although, creating another).  You can't move the chairs, rest your feet on any kind of rail at the bottom, nor is there ample room to cross your legs in a comfortable position. WTF.\\n\\nThe Service: Awkward. We sat down at a bar which at the time hosted a max of 8 other people yet the unenthusiastic bartender refused to acknowledge our existence for quite sometime before coming over and awkwardly asking if we were ready to order. Smiles and warmth were absent. \\n\\nThe Beers: AWKWARD. When I'm enjoying a local brew, the last thing I want to ask after every sip is \\"Wait... is it SUPPOSED to taste like this?!\\" My partner in crime ordered an Irish Red which looked just wrong. The foam never settled. It acted like a poorly made meringue; sort of reaching un-collapsible peaks yet maintaining the appearance of boiling caramel. Where is the soft, creamy foam that us beer lovers so desire?!  The beer tasted exactly like kombucha. When we told the bartender about the clearly under-developed beer, he curtly stated \\"Yeah, some people think it tastes off\\". Really dude? SOME people think it's \\"off\\"? Clearly these people are kombucha lovers and haven't had a beer in their life or they actually enjoy the overly yeasty taste of an immature beer.  I tried the \\"Pumpkin\\" ale which was not the robust, spicy brew that I've grown to accustom to with almost every pumpkin beer I've had. This was bland, dull, and tasteless, save a tiny hint of cinnamon in the finish. It was more of a cinnamon flavored Molson Canadian. \\n\\nAt this point we made the wise decision to avoid further assault on our taste buds and not order another kombuch... umm \\"beer\\". Had we known it would take eons to receive our bill and pay, we would have initiated the process when we first sat down.\\n\\nFinally, as to solidify their spot at the top of awkwardness hierarchy, the hostess attempted to say goodbye (I think). I say this only because there was a feint sound of an unenthusiastic \\"bye..\\"  that seemed to come from behind us out of a grumpy looking young lady who was staring downward at a newspaper- not even at us nor in our general direction. \\n\\nIn conclusion: Watch City Brewing: Fail. Awkward City Brewing: Wins the awkward award of the decade!"},{"name":"Taco Loco Mexican Grill","address":"44 Broadway","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"Mexican food simply stated... simple fresh ingredients cooked to order served by a passionate staff.

For example, I have tasted Chicken 65 at numerous restaurants and each restaurants version is completely different. Same goes for a number of other dishes. \\nI have to say that the Chicken 65 at Zyka is pretty amazing, I love their raita, saag paneer is great, and they have an okra dish as well as a cauliflower dish that are delicious and great for vegetarians.\\nA lot of people talk about how cheap Zyka is and although it is not expensive, I cannot agree. In fact, they have raised the prices recently, but the food makes it all worth the price. The portions are large and the food is always fresh. The food keeps well and leftovers always taste great the next day. There are Indian cooks in the kitchen and the people working at the counter are always nice. I have been going there for quite a while and they always remember my name and what I like.\\nA lot of people complain about the atmosphere, the fact that you have to pay before you eat and that all the food is served on styrofoam and cutlery is plastic. The atmosphere does not bother me at all. I find the atmosphere reassuring when I go into Zyka because I am always surrounded by Southeast Asians, so I know its authentic, and the place is pretty clean compared to a lot of the other Indian restaurants in the area. I personally do not have an issue with paying up front because I know the food will be good. Yes, styrofoam and plastic is not the most green way of serving food, but considering that it doesn't affect the taste of the food, I wont let it take away from my 5 star rating. \\n\\nBe warned, if you have a weak stomach and cannot handle spicy foods, this place is not for you. Personally, I would love to go here with a date, but if you are looking for a more romantic and quiet place to take a date where you will be served by waiters, this place is not for you.  If the fact that they use and discard a lot of styrofoam and plastic bothers you a lot, you may want to ask for your order to go, so you can enjoy your food at home where you can use your own cutlery, napkins and recycle the containers. This is also a good option if you want to have a glass of wine or a beer with dinner, as they do not serve alcohol.\\n\\nZyka is my favorite Indian restaurant and though there are many other Indian restaurants in the area that are great, Zyka is always the best overall experience. I encourage all of my friends to try it and I bet that anyone who loves Indian food will love Zyka."},{"name":"Great Harvest Bread Company","address":"8926 SE Sunnyside Rd","city":"Clackamas","stars":"4.5","text":"I absolutely love this place.\\nSuch friendly workers.\\nSamples are always HUGE- and me love some gooood yummy samples.\\nBreads are always full of flavor\\n\\nMy favorite is the Red, White and Blue.

I have never been disappointed for what I get at that price. \\n\\nThe crowd is very commercial drivey (piercings, working class, old people, bohemian, etc.) and I enjoy the eclectic crowd. Service is straight up and brief, as they are busy serving the masses, but if you want coffee you can grab it yourself.

Our waiter the first time was more catering to a table whom they assumed would leave a good tip. We were simply brushed to the side. Took almost an hour to get a check AFTER we asked for it. The second visit, our waitress had so much attitude. And expressed a lot of sarcasm, I felt like I was fighting with her. I hate that Disney makes tipping required because she did not deserve one.

After trying for 3 months to secure a reservation,  we decided with not much hope to visit the restaurant in hopes of being able to land a reservation in case of a cacellation. \\n\\nWe were told by the person working the front area that the people in charge would be back in 15 minutes and we could talk to them about getting in. We decided 'why not'  it would be well worth if by some miracle we could get in. After all,  what's 15 minutes at the Magic Kingdom right? So,  after waiting approximately 10 minutes and drawing a semi crowd behind us, a cast member named Elizabeth approaches and tells my wife that 'sorry,  the people doing reservations won't be here untill 5pm(another 3 hours) OK. Fine. We didn't really waste anytime and frankly we weren't expecting much anyways.. Ahhhhhhh... But here is where it gets interesting,  Elizabeth informed my wife that the reservation people would not be able to help her untill 5, she no sooner then 20 seconds later turns around,  taps another party on the shoulder, motions for them to follow her and secured them a reservation at 4! They were clearly behind us in line.. Well,  that didn't go over very well with my wife as soon as she found out that that party was given the reservation ahead of us,  let me be clear,  they were behind us and Elizabeth  clearly knew it. Now,  I'm not throwing stones, because frankly,  I didn't really want to eat there anyway due to the overpriced menu, but Elizabeth was wearing a name tag stating she was from Venezuela and the party she gave the reservation to was Latino. Coincidence? Maybe. But when confronted, Elizabeth quickly back peddled and disappeared and arranged a reservation for us at 8pm(thats the best she could do) as it turned out after confirming with guest relations at the park our 8pm reservation was really just a stand by,  and we really weren't confirmed anything.\\n\\nBottom line, if you visit the magic Kingdom and you are looking for overpriced, but a decent dinner or lunch, try The Crystal Palace, they couldn't have been nicer,  plus it's all you can eat."},{"name":"Thai Spice","address":"1310 S F M 360","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"This is the best Thai food in town.

I had high hopes, Ill admit. And it didnt quite live up to my expectations.\\n\\nWe had lunch reservations here. The entry and seating was easy. Drink stations and what not were convenient. We pre ordered online so I was surprised it took 30 minutes for our food to arrive. I saw plenty of people that sat after us that got their food before ours arrived. My husband had the pork and he said it was good, though the portion is very small for the price. I had the quiche. I hoped I could opt out of a side and just get the quiche (as I know you can do on other menu items) but it did not give me the choice to leave off the salad that it comes with. I disliked the dressing that was on the salad. I took one bite and the rest was wasted. The quiche looked nothing like photos Ive seen posted. Some photos have it as a mini personal quiche in a crust. Some pics have it as a slice of quiche with crust. What came out for me is a personal sized quiche with no crust... sitting atop a piece of puff pastry. Im not into the puff pastry crust, and I wish it had been a normal crust actually cooked with the quiche filling. The quiche itself was delicious though. It could have used more cheese, but the 2 bites that did have cheese were the best bites. They garnished the quiche with a piece of like... I dunno, pickled grape. And that was disgusting. And they put the same pickled grape type jelly between the quiche and the \\"crust\\", also disgusting. The flavor did not go well with the quiche at all. For dessert we shared the grey stuff cupcake. It was good, but not worth the price of course."},{"name":"Mikado Sushi","address":"6417 Raleigh St","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Fresh seafood (often flown in from japan) , authentic Japanese food, and decently priced.

For a restaurant in this price range, I expected food with a little more sophistication and attention to detail. I thought the service was absolutely delightful, particularly our waiter, who offered us incredible wine and dessert recommendations.\\n\\nTeatro is located on Tremont though it can be easy to miss. The main entrance is a bit rundown and didn't look as nice as I expected. The threshold was uneven, which was a bit surprising given how nicely decorated the restaurant was. The ceilings are high and arching, with rounded corners. There are beautiful crown mouldings all around. The only caveat to the dining space is that the tables are very close together and for the person sitting on the inside booth, it can be really difficult to get to their seat.\\n\\nTo start with, we tried the calamari. The calamari was fresh but a little too heavily battered. They also brought us some dark bread with hummus and olive oil. The dips were great but the bread was a bit too hard. As mains, we shared a half risotto, half orecchiette, and scallops. The orecchiette was served with pork sausage, rapini, and broccoli -- absolutely delicious! The risotto was a bit heavy but the truffle oil was delicious and the mushrooms really added to the texture. The scallops were also very fresh and juicy and served alongside a good balance of Brussel sprouts. I would definitely recommend getting half portions to increase variety. We ended the meal with sorbet, which included lemon, raspberry, and blueberry. I do have to say that none of the dessert offerings were particularly enticing.\\n\\nIn closing, I felt that the meal was a bit too pricy for the overall experience. The service was great and they didn't hesitate to replace our plates and forks every so often, but the food didn't blow me away. I think the ingredients are great but it's missing that special value-adding touch.

I'm not even all that sure why. It just appeals to me. A bit expensive but so worth it. Jeff and I love it a lot, in fact, this is where we came for his last birthday at his request.\\n\\nGordon Biersch is a restaurant but more importantly, a brewery. It's in the heart of the Arena District in the same little area shared with Nationwide Arena, Frog Bear and Buca di Beppo. You can't really see it from the road, at least not very well. You have to walk on that brick boardwalk area to get in the front door. But I love this area. It's quaint and I think it's romantic on a date. The inside of the restaurant is huge and there's even a nice patio so you can take advantage of the pretty brick stuff outside. The inside is neat and trendy. You can sit at tables, booths or at the bar.\\n\\nParking sucks, no question. Sure, there's a huge parking lot right across the street, but it's Nationwide's lot and you have to pay to park there. It depends on what's going on for how much you'll pay, but forget it if there's a hockey game or something, it'll be over $10. There aren't really any good metered spots close by. Usually when I come here I walk from my house because it only takes me about 10-15 minutes, but that sort of rules this place out in the winter.\\n\\nIt sucks here when it's crowded. If you come here before or after a hockey game it's insane. It's also pretty crowded during happy hour. The people that come here are definitely older and look like they have money. So it's pretty chill - no crazy screaming people.\\n\\nFirst I'll talk about the beer. I love the Hefeweizen. It's my usual here. I can't come here and not get at least one glass. It's really awesome and so smooth. I also enjoy their Golden Export. Not as good as the Hefeweizen in my opinion, but still worth trying. I believe that they will let you sample the beers if you want to try them out before ordering a glass. You can order some beer in a huge glass/mug which is always fun. We came here for one of the OSU games to escape the craziness of campus (which we totally succeeded in here - there was only a small crowd) and got huge mugs of beer. It was great. The beers aren't real cheap, and happy hour only gets you $1 off the price. But coming here is a special treat anyway and I don't mind. Worth it!\\n\\nThe food can be great, but I've had some things that were just alright. The Kobe Sliders were so good. I have a thing for mini burgers. I'm like the girls in that commercial, \\"They're just so cute!\\" Not really that bad. Anyway, they come with onion straws and I love it! The downside is it's only 3 burgers and it's over $10! I usually don't order this because it costs so much. I highly recommend the Gorgonzola Pear Salad. It's topped with pecan-crusted chicken and it's heavenly. Almost $13, but so good. Last time I was here I got the BBQ Chicken Pizza. It was good, but I've definitely had better. And for $12, I won't be getting it again. The sauce was too sweet. I've also tried the Goat Cheese Ravioli. Good, but it had pine nuts in it, and it was then that I discovered my dislike for pine nuts. There were too much and the flavors were rich and overpowering. I've had the M√§rzen BBQ Burger. This was good (it had bacon and cheddar) - I do like the burgers. And the burgers come with garlic fries. These are a must have. They are just as delicious and addicting as Red Robin's garlic fries. Only here they aren't bottomless. Eating here is so expensive and we usually come here with the intention of having a few beers, but it smells so good in here. It's hard not to order something.\\n\\nThe service is typically pretty good. Sometimes they are a little spotty, but they've always been polite. The restrooms are consistently clean and well-stocked with all the essentials. It's not always my first choice, but when we do decide to come here I get pretty excited. I really love the beer and it's always a yummy treat to snack on the fries.

Sure, they have a one pound burrito, but it's pretty bland. The veggie one is filled with beans, rice, lettuce, a couple diced tomatos and a small bit of cheese, at least that's all you can taste in it. I slathered it up in the tomatillo green sauce that they had on the counter (which was the best part of my dinner). \\n\\nThe BF had the tortilla soup, which tasted a bit better than my burrito and was made with a tomato soup base, which is cool, since most soups seem to be made with a chicken stock. The prices were pretty average, except for the prices on booze, that seemed a bit ludicrous. We're talking $30 for a pitcher of sangria, and almost $40 for a pitcher of margarita or daiquiri - that's just crazy! I could sort of understand if it was a nice restaurant, but this place is like a self serve burrito joint. Ain't no need to be ballin' that big here! \\n\\nIn the end, I'd rather have a smaller burrito with better ingrediants, or more ingrediants for that matter.

We got there about an hour before closing and it was busy but we didn't have trouble finding a table.  \\n\\nWhen we walked in I was really excited to see alligator heads and sketches of the French Quarter on the wall.  There was even a New Orleans themed bedtime story perched on the ledge next to our table.  It looked promising...  \\n\\nIt figured if it looked like NOLA then it would taste like it too, right?  Not so much.\\n\\nI started with the Corn and Crabmeat Soup.  To say it was just a cup of soup and not a bowl, it was a huge portion.  It was creamy and chock full of named ingredients but there was no heat or spice to make it taste interesting.  At least the guys enjoyed their crispy Gator Bites.\\n\\nMy entr√©e was the Blackened Redfish, grilled redfish served with Macque Choux.  Our server, Crystal, told me they'd run out of redfish and would have to substitute tilapia.  That should have been my cue to order something else but I didn't.    \\n  \\nThe plate arrived to the table with equal portions of white rice, fish and corn.  It didn't look appetizing and for $18.95 I expected more fish and less filler.  (No, they wouldn't adjust the price even though tilapia is NOT redfish.  I wasn't footing the bill but it irked me on principle.)  \\n\\nI didn't care for the Macque Choux.  I prefer a creamy-style dish and this version was more vinegary.  The fish was just ok.  The guys had more luck with their fried seafood platters.  They reported that the fried shrimp were pretty good--well battered and flavorful.\\n\\nBased on my dishes...2 stars.

I like the spicy Thai salad (beware though, sometimes the cilantro is sandy and there's a branch of basil rather than nicely plucked leaves) and the chicken parm salad is tasty, too.

Ranging from the tacos and burritos, to even small bites of platanos and pupsas. Whatever it was, I wanted it all!\\n\\nThere was so many options to choose from, but their menu is yet simple. So I ordered the chicken and steak burrito and asked for it spicy(I love me some spice), along with an order of tostadas with pork. For those two under $10, and the portions served? It's a pretty good deal.\\n\\nI also ordered a bottle of the lime flavored Jarritos. I wasn't sure whether it was a twist off cap off the glass bottles(very vintage, they even have the glass coke bottles!), later to find out it wasn't after many attempts to open it with my hands. I was later told that there is a bottle opener right next to the fridge(Just for future reference, for those whom don't notice things off the bat).\\n\\nI devoured my meal, the tostadas were okay, only because the pork was a little dry, but overall okay. Both the chicken and steak burrito combination definitely hit the spot. Next time I would try the beef tounge burrito, I'm a little curious to see how that taste. \\n\\nTaco Loco seems to be kept clean overall, I didn't go to the bathroom to truly find out though.

My expectations were met and exceeded! The ambiance, first of all, is beautiful. It is a perfectly sized place with beautiful decor. The service was amazing, especially for a party of 25 guests. The food was great as well. I worked with the manager to create a menu specific to my party. The menu options were wonderful and we pre-selected wine bottles for the table which were delicious. THe manager graciously let me bring my own dessert with a $2.00 plating fee per person. This turned out to be cheaper than ordering dessert from the menu. Our menu options included Arugula Salad and Calamari as family style starters; mushroom risotto, shrimp and scallop pasta, chicken milanese, and steak for the main course. I believe everyone enjoyed the food! \\n\\nLast but not least, the cost. For a large party, the total cost of the dinner was EXTREMELY reasonable.

To one of her errors, she responded, \\"Well this is better than what you ordered anyway.\\"  Second, after a couple of hours, we were asked to leave because we ordered too many drinks.  There were eight of us at the table and each of us had ordered 2-3 drinks as well as appetizers and meals.  None of us was impaired, and we Ubered there so were not driving anyway.  We split the $600 bill between 6 credit cards.  To our surprise, it was discovered the next day that the ENTIRE bill was charged to my friend's debit card, leaving his account in the negative.  I don't think anyone was planning on a $600 dinner for themselves that night.  He called and they refunded him, but he had to wait until Monday since it was the weekend.  His birthday weekend I might add:  with no money.  They then proceeded to charge each of us our share like they should have the night before.

The employee went over to eat some food she had on another counter before getting back to work on orders. The manager NEVER acknowledges anyone waiting at the counter for their food. She looks over at you and sees you there but never makes her way over to assist those waiting. As I waited 15 minutes past my pick up time again, I told the manager that the customer service here sucks. She said \\"I know, I'm under staffed\\".

The buffet also offers different kinds of breads and salads, delicious soups, a variety of vegetables, and traditional dishes like bobotie, chakalaka, fufu and sambal.  This time around, I especially enjoyed the Tunisian seafood soup and the pecan-red pepper pesto, one of the many chutneys and sauces served with the meat.  \\n\\nThe desserts consist mostly of American style cookies and mini-cheesecakes, but this time they also offered a little sponge cake type of thing and a cobbler with a lovely vanilla sauce.  \\n\\nAfter our meal, one of the waitresses answered our questions and told us a little about her country of Zimbabwe.

A group of my friends and I decided to give this place a try and we were not disappointed. Though it took time to actually get a table, the line up was only testament to the popularity of this place. Our food arrived relatively fast and the sound of sizzling food being tossed in the line of woks only provoked our hunger more. The chicken gyoza was incredible; crispy yet moist with a chewy dough, the filling was seasoned and balanced perfectly and the vinegar dipping sauce was a bold accent to the dish. Next we had the beef stir fry noodles in which the vegetables were very tender and the noodles were cooked to near-perfection,though i found it relatively bland, the dish itself felt very fresh. Following this we indulged in the beef soup with a balanced stock of bone marrow and ketjab manis accompanied by fresh noodles and a very tender flank steak accented with coriander. The last thing we tried which ended up being my favorite dish was the beef roll. I would walk to this place from West Vancouver just to eat this again. It was lightly fried beef inside a spring roll with lucid salty and sweet flavors that worked harmoniously. This place is truly a bang for your buck.

This was confusing because we've walked in and they've had us stand to have our order taken, at the roll cart POS. Then we've been told to sit and they'll come to you...then later on, just kidding, come stand at the POS. I'm just shuffling along when i walk in wondering what it will be this time.\\n\\nThe menu is supposedly changed so the orders are expedited- the kitchen only has so many ingredients and whatever so you're supposed to get your food faster...?

That and it is absolutely no faster, really it's the same wait time. Or am I just always lucky?\\n\\nReal restaurants have waiters always doing something or in the back, but it's never really crowded so they're kind of standing around and talking a lot. I don't know maybe since it's a new place there is nothing to do but I was a server once and the amount of crap you actually can be doing is absurd- I never had time to stand around...or I mean I did but I never wanted to.\\n\\nI mean it's close by, I order what apparently is signature so I really don't have any problems.

It's right across the way from the hospitals downtown, in an old Pizza Hut and old Moe's.\\n\\nI really like this place. The staff is top notch, and the food is good and reasonably priced, bordering on a bargain. \\n\\nI've had salads, pizza and pasta here. All, were excellent. The small caesar salad is very large, and could almost be an entree. The great thing about the salad, is the right amount of dressing. The pastas are good too. The only issue I had was the sauce is a bit rich, not overwhelmingly so. \\n\\nMy favorite is the pizza though. You can tell they are using fresh ingredients, including fresh cheese. The crust has some sort of garlic butter on it and is just the right size. It's a handle for the rest of the pie. My wife really likes their Hawaiian pizza. I've liked everything I've tried. The one pizza I won't order again anytime soon is the 4 meat pizza. It is so full of toppings, I feel bad for my arteries. It tastes very good, but is full of meat. The toppings are generous and flavorful. \\n\\nThe restaurant also participates in the Buy Local Orlando program and when you bring your card, you get free soda or $1 wine (I think). I would much rather support a local place when I can. \\n\\nAs another reviewer pointed out, it's self service drinks at lunch time. Although, it's hardly rare, it does seem odd to do this some of the time and not the rest. \\n\\nI'll certainly be back!

We tried to be really extra polite the rest of the night because we felt that might have annoyed her (even though, my Aunt didn't really interrupt her or anything, she was just holding her phone to her ear, on hold, while she ordered). Our server just got progressively worse the nicer we tried to be. At one point she asked if we needed anything and my cousin said something like \\"another couple napkins would be great\\" she immediately started walking away and said \\"Ok\\" so I had to kind of call out to her (cause she didn't wait to hear from anyone else) and I said \\"Oh, can I have another drink as well?\\" She stopped in her tracks, stayed facing the other direction for a moment, then turned to the table with a super smug smirk on her face, raised up her hands and in the b*tchiest, most condescending tone and raised voice she said \\"Anything ELSE I can get you WHILE I'M HERE??\\"\\n\\nWe were all put off and looked at each other like \\"wtf\\"? and said \\"uh, no.

Seriously, it was like being slapped in the face by a smell. The place reeked of a frat house or an undergraduate co-op. We were seated by a young man who, I thought, neglected to give us menus. So, I went back up to the podium and requested menus and was informed that instead of menus, there's now a buffet ($9) featuring many of Trudy's favorites. \\n\\nWhen I expressed concern that the kid's meal would be unavailable, the young man checked with the manager and reassured me that they would be able to accommodate that request. I was still skeptical, but gave the young man our drink order and asked for a kid's menu and crayons so that I could read my Chronicle in peace while my son colored. \\n\\nWell, the drinks nor the kids' menu/crayons never came, and we were one table out of about maybe 4 in the entire place.

Yes, the salad bar might not be as impressive as you'll find elsewhere in the city- however, judging a Brazilian steakhouse by its salad bar is like judging a Chinese restaurant by its french fries - let's stop the insanity, people. \\n\\nFood: Red & Green is your standard Brazilian Steakhouse - the staff parade around the restaurant with meat on skewers and each patron is given a color coded card - the green side denotes that you want them to bring on the meat, while the red side denotes that you've been defeated. The menu includes 15 different meats: Rump Steak, Top Sirloin, Filet Mignon (dinner only), Garlic Beef, Pork Ribs, Filet Mignon w/ Bacon (dinner only), Chicken w/ Bacon, Flank Steak (dinner only), Lamb (dinner only), Pork Loin, Pork Sausage, Chicken Drumsticks, Chicken Hearts, Beef Ribs (dinner only), and Rib Eye (dinner only). During my visit, I tried at least 10 different meats, all of which were well cooked and flavorful. They also have a salad bar and hot foods bar (rice, fried plantains, etc.) - the selection isn't overly extensive, but there's enough to please most reasonable diners. Garlic bread and cheese rolls were also served with the meal. \\n\\nService: Impeccable. My partner and I dined here on a Saturday evening and we were treated like royalty. The staff were friendly, efficient, and eager to engage in conversation. For the reviewers complaining about the variety of meats that were brought around - just ask and ye shall receive - the staff were more than willing to bring out particular meats that were requested. \\n\\nAtmosphere: I think the decor would best be described as cruise ship chic - there's faux wood paneling and brass galore. They've also attached a small sign to the end of every single table warning that \\"the consumption of raw or undercooked meats, poultry, seafood, shellfish, or eggs may increase your risk of foodborne illness\\" - bom apetite, meus amigos! In addition to the main dining room, the restaurant also has a large banquet space in the basement. \\n\\nCost: Expensive by casual dining standards, but inexpensive when compared to other Brazilian steakhouses in Atlanta. Lunch is $18.95/person, while dinner is $34.95/person. Discounted rates are available for children under 10 years old. \\n\\nOther: Red & Green is closed on Monday's.

A place where you can actually smoke indoors! But even if you're not a smoker, this isn't a bad place to hang out. Shisha Lounge appeals to both crowds.\\n\\nIt's located on High St. north of campus, near Hendoc's and The Blue Danube. It's easy to walk to if you live around the north campus area, but if not, parking isn't always so easy. Especially now with all that construction going on along High St. in this whole area. But there are usually some spots you can score along the side streets, like Maynard or Patterson.\\n\\nShisha isn't really my thing, but I've been here twice to hang out. If you're not a smoker, it's still not that bad. When you walk in, you'll see that the interior looks a bit middle eastern, a bit like a college dorm room. Straight ahead is a front desk with an employee behind it. Upon going up to the desk, you'll see a list of your flavors of tobacco to choose from. They have somewhere around 25 flavors, most of them fruity, or unique, like rose. And if you're not a smoker, you should know that smoking here isn't quite like smoking a cigarette. It's very light and it tastes like the flavor that you choose. If you're used to smoking cigarettes, you will find this to be different than you're used to. It will feel much less powerful.\\n\\nAnyway, when you choose your flavor, which I think each flavor pouch is around $8, you will get mouthpieces for everyone in your party. However many people is with you. I should mention that this is a nice place to come alone to relax, or with a group to sit and chat. And I skipped a part! When you come in, you have to show your ID before you buy any tobacco. Just to prove that you are at least 18. Anyway, you take your tobacco and find a  hookah - there are usually some sitting out on the tables in the sitting area. The sitting area is to the right of the front desk, and when you go in there you'll see several old and dingy couches sitting there - they look ancient and dirty but they are strangely comfortable and when you sit in them you sort of sink down in. They look like couches that were left by the side of the road for trash but ended up here. Tables are here and there amongst the couches for your smoking convenience. There are also a few wooden tables and chairs. Everything's also pretty colorful, but in a muted down way that makes everything appear a bit sun faded. Maybe it's just the haze in the air. Since everyone is smoking, it is a bit hazy and gray, but it's not overwhelming and doesn't smell real bad since it's a lot of fruity flavors going around.\\n\\nSo you just attach your mouthpiece and put your tobacco in the bowl and smoke away! I've done it before, and it's actually not so bad. We tried strawberry and it just tasted like strawberry flavor in your mouth. It was so light, that no one, including myself was coughing or anything. It's pretty harmless. Although, I don't really see the point of it. For non smokers, if you want some flavor, I would just chew some gum. But some people find this environment relaxing.\\n\\nThey have live music here sometimes. My friend's small jazz duo played here one night and we came to watch them. The music matched the mood and it was pretty mellow. I've never been here when another band was playing, so I'm not really sure of the other types of music that's played here, but I don't think that it's anything real heavy. From what I've heard it's all good stuff to relax to. I really liked the atmosphere. But it can get sort of crowded sometimes. It's not so fun if you can't find a comfy place to sit down and relax. A lot of people come here all the time and so it might be a hit or miss - it's definitely more enjoyable if you happen to come in at a slower time.\\n\\nAnd you can stay as long as you like. You might see some students here studying and enjoying the fact that they can smoke indoors. Mostly it's small groups talking. But they also serve food here. I've never had it, but I think it's mostly sandwiches and the like. But one thing I wish about this place is that they served alcohol. I realize that there are bars right outside, but it would be nice to maintain the mellow while enjoying a beer. Maybe that would disrupt the whole flow, but I think it might be fun. But I guess it's nice so the younger crowd can come in here and enjoy themselves, too. But since I'm not big on smoking, I don't really have a good reason to frequent this place, hence me only being here twice.\\n\\nOne time I came here with some friends, and one of my friends that was with us is a heavy smoker. He tried some of the hookah, and while he didn't hate it, he also said that he didn't see the point and said it felt like nothing since it was so light. He then proceeded to light up a cigarette and enjoy that instead. I personally think it tastes lightly like flavored gum or candy. But it's not bad and it's worth a try, smokers and non-smokers alike."},{"name":"Au Bon Pain","address":"53 State St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"Today was the second time i was charged incorrectly.

They have a TV usually playing some futbol (soccer).\\n\\n6) I wouldn't recommend for groups because I believe they only have one cook most of the times. I just went this evening (my fifth time there), and it was just me and a friend and it took about 15 minutes for both our meals when there was only one other table there so I'm assuming a larger party would take quite some time.\\n\\n7) Nice selection of beers such as Modelo, Modelo dark, etc.\\n\\n8) Very fresh and yummy margaritas.

I was sitting in my office here in Westlake wondering where in the world I was going to watch my beloved Manchester United play their Champions League match today at 1:45pm.  I always go to lunch around that time and thought \\"If only there was an English pub around here with large TVs and fish 'n chips with the big game on.\\"  I put my Yelp-ing mad-skillz to use and ~VOILA!~  The Lion & Rose Pub popped up on my screen and as if the gods of pubs shined their grace upon me, it's right across the street!  This is totally my day and raced my car over there as quickly as possible.  \\n\\nThe place is nestled right next to Chick-Fil-A in the Village at Westlake, my #1 fast-food addiction!  I'll review that later... just you wait (grin).  I walk in to the restaurant/pub and it seemed a little \\"Bennigan's-ish\\" and not as open as a real British pub.  Walking to the left I noticed the bar area with plenty of TVs on the wall and quickly asked the bartender (who is from London--nice touch) and asked if the game was on.  He knew exactly what I was asking for and handed me the remote control!  I think that's the first time a bar-keep has ever allowed me to  grab a remote (hmmm...is there Playboy TV? ~grin).  The game JUST started and I was tempted to grab a cold pint of beer but refrained.  Why- OH WHY did I have to go back to the office after lunch?  They have about 18 nice choices of beer (Guinness, Old Speck Hen, Smithwick's, etc...) on tap.  Not ordering a beer right now  feels as if I'm stepping through the 7th level of Dante's Inferno, but I digress.  The menu is full of English pub standards like Fish 'n chips, corned beef, bangers 'n mash, etc...etc... Heck, they even have Bubble 'n Squeak!  Not to worry, for those of you who do not fancy a bit o' the ol' country, there are plenty in the \\"Yanks Favorites\\" section like burgers and steaks.  The fish 'n chips I got were also served with an extra side.  I chose the battered mushrooms, which were saut√©ed and tasted very awesome.  My plate came with a nice hefty portion of fish that was really crispy on the outside and flaky soft on the inside.  By far one of the best fried fish in town (sorry Dog 'n Duck, new player in town now)!  Although my lunch was about $12 bucks, it really felt like it was well worth it both on quality and quantity.  I can't wait to try more of the many other menu items that caught my eye.  \\n\\nWhat a great lunch!  Good food, great match (Manchester United won 4 to 0!) and all of this only 2 minutes from my office.

There's a display of the available donuts on the counter but be sure to ask if the plate is empty; they sometimes have some more donuts in the making.\\n\\n+BLUEBERRY BOURBON BASIL (BBB): This is my absolute favorite here. First of all, it's such a gorgeous color, and then it's nice blueberry taste with a nice depth of sweetness. I definitely recommend this one!\\n+COINTREAU CREME BRULEE: This is my second favorite here! They don't always have this one when I come, though maybe it's bad timing since they ran out or are making them.\\n+PASSIONFRUIT COCOA NIB: The donut is tasty and pretty! It does have a dash of cayenne (which came unexpected), but to be honest the spice is nicely contrasted with the sweetness.\\n+GREEN TEA: This one I've actually only had at the airport but just wanted to throw this one in in case you find it here! It's definitely one of the most green tea flavored donuts I've had.\\n-HARD APPLE CIDER: I found this to be good, but only okay compared to the other donuts.

With a few exceptions, the secret to great food at Disney World is that it's found in the resorts and not in the parks.  This would apply to Jiko which I believe is the best restaurant on Disney property.\\n\\nJiko is found at the Animal Kingdom Lodge, which is an African safari lodge themed resort adjacent to Disney's Animal Kingdom.  The restaurant is located in the lower level by the pool area and across from Boma, a buffet service restaurant.  The decor of the restaurant is very warm and inviting with deep lush color tones of brown and dusty red which compliments the dark color of the wood tables and chairs.\\n\\nNow for the food, wow!  I can't tell you how awesome the food is here.  Since the theme of the resort is Africa, it's no surprise that the cuisine at Jiko is primarily African with influences from India, Europe, and the Mediterranean.  \\n\\nFor a starter course I would suggest the cucumber, red onion, and tomato salad.  It's very light, it's got just a bit of tang to it but it's not tart.  If you'd like a soup then you can't go wrong with their butternut squash soup.\\n\\nFor your main course I would recommend the lamb shank, so filling and so rich and it falls off the bone because it's so tender and moist; the pan roasted scallops which were incredibly buttery; the tamarind-braised short ribs which is a little sweet which only compliments the beef; or the oak-grilled filet mignon which is accompanied with macaroni and cheese in a red wine sauce.  One of my friends who is a meat and potatoes gal will only order this dish when we dine there.  The mac & cheese is good as sin.\\n\\nFor dessert I would recommend the pistachio creme brulee or the flourless chocolate mocha cake with vanilla ice cream and caramel sauce.  \\n\\nThe service here is very attentive and very friendly.

I felt like it could have been a \\"Dining in the Dark\\" experience when we first arrived. It took me 10-15 to adjust. Maybe I don't have enough photoreceptors in my eyes. According to the servers, this restaurant has been around for ~20 years; that's cool. \\n\\nThe mango lassi was good and thicker than other lassi drinks I've had. It's sweet and a little tangy. After I ordered the lassi, we thought the server was joking when he added roti to our order.  We kinda laughed, but didn't say yes or anything. Then he brought it out and charged us for it later. It didn't cost that much and good thing we were using scoutmob. The roti came with tamarind sauce, garlic sauce and one other sauce, it might have been mint. \\n\\nI ordered the Chicken Tikki Massala dinner. You have the option of ordering a la carte  or dinner. Dinner comes with a lentil soup. I've never ordered this dish as a main dish because I usually get my fill at Indian buffets. Daniel B. and I agreed this was a REALLY good dish. The chicken was tender and the sauce was just the right bit of creaminess. Gawd dang, I licked that plate clean. I like the big piece of naan they give you. Oh so soft and carbo-licious. \\n\\nThe Chicken Makhni was also very good. It has a creamy tomato base. I didn't get it because sounded as though it would taste like spaghetti sauce with a sharp, tomato taste. I'm glad Daniel ordered it. \\n\\nIt took some time for our food to come out even though the restaurant was not too busy.

She was very nice but seemed a bit swamped, considering there weren't any other people eathing, this didn't make much sense.  We ordered our food and once it came, she unfortunately dropped one of the meals on the floor.  She went back to get another one and about 20 minutes later, the meal came, after everyone else was almost finished eating.  The head bartender came over to apologize and asked if the meal-less person wanted a free drink or for them to take it off the bill.  Obviously it should be taken off the bill, this shouldn't even be a question.  That's an awkward question to answer so we said it was fine, when clearly it was not and they left it on the bill, at a price even higher than what the menu listed!  Once it arrived, it was the crab cake sandwich, and it was completely missing the aioli sauce so it was literally a plain crabcake, obviously this wasn't the waitress's fault.

In truth, the breads looked more like a taste of my favorite chaat Indian restaurant in Austin, Swad.  However, the dips were hummus, a cilantro one, and an African inspired masala one.  The last one was excellent.  It had cardamon in it and some vinegar as well.  I'm going to try to play with it at the house to see if I can replicate it.  They warned us it was spicy, but on a scale to one to 10, it was a 3.  It wasn't all that bad...heck, if the husband ate it, it wasn't spicy.  The cilantro one was the most spicy followed by the hummus.\\nOverall, the dips were good and a nice start to the meal.  \\n\\nNext, we had the BBQ chicken flatbread.

It also had a bit of pickle dashed on top of it.  The corn soup arrived in a hot carafe that was poured atop the crab.  For the first couple bites the cold crab and the hot soup exploded in my mouth.  The soup was velvety smooth with that earthy sweetness that can only come from corn picked in season.

At $9 ($7.50 for pulled pork + $1.50 for scoop of mac), my meal was large and filling.  I think the prices are typical when ordering from a food truck and are appropriate for a restaurant setting.  The little metal trays are a cute reminder of their food truck roots, but it was hard to eat the corn cake out of it--would have been easier if the cake was laid out flat.  \\n\\nBoth meals were delicious.  The pork and brisket were very similar in taste and texture, so if you're concerned about price get the pork and save 75 cents.

It's close to my house, it's fast, it's cheap - all of which make for a take out match made in heaven. \\n\\nOn those cold rainy nights nothing warms you up, soul and all, like a bowl of Pho. You know what else warms you up? Pajamas! Which just so happens to be my outfit of choice after a long day. Lucky for me Pho Jasmine can whip up a mean bowl of Pho with a quick phone call in about 10 mins or less. N Portland is a bit of a Pho wasteland with this exception. \\n\\nMy order here is Veggie Pho, always. What can I say, I'm a creature of habit. Vegetables are pretty standard - cabbage, broccoli, cilantro, onions with a side of lime and bean sprouts. Tofu is, for better or for worse, Tofu.  I've had other Pho that gets a little more adventurous with veggies and garlic which would be preferred. For $7, It's good! It's predictable! From what I can tell it seems fresh!\\n\\nInside is bit of a yawn, nothing to see here folks! There are always tables as far as I can tell, but lunch might be crazier with the college students. I suggest getting stuff to go. Not that it's unpleasant, there's just nothing to it. Bring cash if you order is under $10 or be prepared to fork over .25 cents! \\n\\n3 Stars might not look great, that dull orange-y color and not that shiny bright 5 star red, but I assure you it's good and worth stopping by if you're in a Pho'mood in the area.

Walking in, we noticed the big, breezy patio...definitely could see ourselves relaxing there before or after dinner. Armed with a restaurant.com coupon and an open mind, we ordered a variety of items off the happy hour and regular menu: wild boar with grilled bread, fried goat cheese with red onion jam & honey, pork pinchitos with sea salt, and scallop & pork belly with risotto to share. Each dish held its own. The fried goat cheese was just as good as everyone said, but I do wish they brought out more bread with it. I absolutely loved the small plates, and there were so many that I want to go back and try. Our main entree, the scallops & pork belly was fine although I didn't LOVE the risotto. The apples were an interesting touch. My boyfriend kept raving about the scallops, which were ginormous. We really wanted to go for the paella, but maybe another time. I feel like FINO is a place we could keep visiting and not get tired of - everything matches our slightly adventurous palates without costing an arm and leg. Service was solid as well - our waiter gave us plenty of time to look over the menu and brought out our food in a timely manner.

The sausage, I'm sure, was fully cooked, but it was that unappetizing gray color.  It would have been much more appealing with a little brown on it.  I don't like cantaloupe or honeydew, so I gave my fruit away.  There were four small pastries on a plate.  I had a chocolate one, which was delicious.

The problem is, Union Burger performs neither role very well.\\n\\nWhen you order your burger, you're not offered a choice in temperature. What you receive is somewhere between medium well and well done. The flavor is bland and the burger I received was dripping with grease. The particular sandwich I ordered was advertised as \\"The Steakhouse Burger\\" which comes with Onion Rings, Garlic Sauce, Mushrooms and A1. Classic staples such as Pickle, Lettuce, Tomato, and Onion come at an additional charge to an already expensive burger that you can't pick a temperature for. Upon receiving my burger I was greeted by what I've decided I can only label as \\"cafeteria food.\\" I can forgive the portion sizes on account of Union Burger being a Canadian brand, and American restaurants are notorious for their oversized portions. \\n\\nUnion Burger lies in the middle of the road which more often than not means you're going to be run over by a bus. On the one hand it tries to be fast and accessible in the same strain as Panera or Chipotle offering you the option to take something on the go in a timely manner, or sit down for a bit in a \\"nicer than McDonalds\\" atmosphere. At the opposite end of the spectrum, Union Burger also offers wine and beer with their offerings probably in the hopes that the guests will be too drunk to realize the inferiority of the product they've received. Unfortunately this also sets them up as direct competition to larger restaurants in the area such as Nona Blue which offers identical price points and dedicated table side service. I can't justify the increased price for \\"convenience\\" at Union Burger when I'm not really sure if what I'm eating is a burger. \\n\\nIn an ironic logistics decision, Union Burger is the awkward neighbor to restaurant/tavern Nona Blue which recently boasted the \\"Best Burger in Orlando\\" according to the Sentinel Foodie Awards and offers almost identical prices in their burger offerings.\\n\\nPricey Mediocrity is a spot on description for the newest member of the Lake Nona restaurant scene.

The outside patio need some minor attention as there are a few chairs with broken spokes again safety and some floor boards are warped and could be a trip hazard.\\n8. Ordered a chai and a slice of thier chocolate tart. The chai tea was too bitter, it was their house blend. I don't know if sugar really would have helped and they sprinkled too much cinnamon. The tart was dence and chocolatey, not very sweet, but it was well balanced with the whipped cream and fresh strawberries on the side."},{"name":"Teatro","address":"177 Tremont St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Seated immediately.

I saw others order it and it came in a large crockpot- steaming to the brim with exposed lobster. But I was disappointed- as the presentation could be easily rated as 5 starts, it had little flavor. In addition, it came as an ocean in a broth and I never received a spoon and had lobster shells with nothing to break the shell of the caw. Edamame had a nice touch with the corn but it seemed to be overused in nearly every single one of their dishes. The bread, slightly dipped inside the broth was nicely toasted inside.  \\nI ate everything because I was hungry until as I was scooping up the last bit, saw TWO jet black hairs in the broth. I looked over at the kitchen and two of the cooks had their hair away from the food with cloths but one man had his open. It was two small to be mine and mine is not that same color. I probably should have said something but as someone in he industry myself, I didn't want them to think I was looking for a freebie because I DID practically eat the entire thing. \\n\\nMy eating companion had the sole which was the catch of the day and it was extremely tiny. Flavors didn't match with the green sauce, edamame, corn and bacon. And he finished it in practically three bites. \\n\\nDessert was my favorite part of the meal. We ordered chocolate rangoons- per our server's suggestion. They were the Rangoon's that you would think of at an Asian bistro, served hot with a cool, vanilla cream. \\n\\nService was the best part of the experience with Erica, our server, who was bright and bubbly. \\nHowever, for a New England native, the seafood was below par."},{"name":"Clyde Common","address":"1014 SW Stark St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"This place reminds me of one of my favorite spots in SF.

I know I did a terrible job spelling the dishes, it's not my thing. I just like to eat them and take pictures of them.

Reservations are not necessary and kids are welcome.  This could be a good date place if your date enjoys ethnic cuisine and don't need decor to impress.\\n\\nI so want to give Himalayas the elusive 5 star rating! The main reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because there are some dishes that I don't care for like their saag (it's on the creamy side) and their portions are a bit on the small side. Also, because I go there so often they sometimes get a little overly friendly and they constantly try to get me to order more food, add a glass of wine...

In fact, all of the salsas are made in house and are super fresh tasting. For the portions and quality, Chile Verde is very well-priced (averaging $10/ entree). The owner is a friendly chap who is almost always on hand, seating people and working along side the waitstaff. Always a good sign.... \\n\\nChile Verde has a full bar with Mexican beers and a pedestrian selection of wines. Most folks, however, come for the margaritas, which are often voted best in town.

I really don't even know where to start here. The food was ok and the service was TERRIBLE. Simply atrocious. The worst of any restaurant I've ever been to. Having been a server myself, I typically leave generous tips but I left one that reflected the poor service our table received. 7 of us came in around 3pm on a Tuesday ready to enjoy some yummy noodles but we left thoroughly disappointed. The place was nearly empty yet our table went unattended for a long time and this was just the tip of the iceberg. Apparently our waiter was sent home but nobody told anybody else about that. Our entr√©es came out at different times. First, 2 entr√©es came out, then a couple more, they brought the wrong entr√©e out for me which they took back and remade and 15 min after that the other entr√©es came out. 1 person at our table got his order way after 2 people had already finished theirs! And the joint was still nearly empty so we're not sure what the issue was here. Regardless, nobody came over to apologize or explain what was happening. When we asked the girl that seemed to be the manager about the last entr√©e we were waiting on, she went to the kitchen and started making the dish herself! Clearly they forgot to put it in. We also ordered a entr√©e to go but 30 min later, we were still waiting. Turns out they forgot to put in that order as well. We finally say something about the service and they ended up apologizing and comping dessert which was appreciated. However, when we asked for the bill, it never came. We asked a 2nd time and the waitress responded with, \\"nobody brought it out?\\" Who else would bring it out but HER (our waitress)? We finally get it, take a look at the bill and it was wrong. We didn't say anything since they were kind enough to comp us a few desserts which, by the way, sat at the counter for a while as employees walked past them and didn't bother to bring them over. We almost got up to fetch them ourselves. Anyway, we're ready to get the heck out of the place and move on with life so we hand her two credit cards and ask that the bill be split between the two cards. Well, they couldn't even do that right! One card was charged about $20 more than the other and the total of the two random charges on the cards didn't even add up to what our overall bill was! We couldn't believe the mess of an experience we had at this place!

Once you walk inside, there is a beautiful water fountain that that goes from the upstairs to the downstairs with a light that alternates between different colors. I thought it was pretty cool and beautiful. \\n\\nI was taken here on a Groupon deal that came with everything including a bottle of wine under a certain price. We checked in with the owner (or an Asian man I assume was the owner or manager) and he promptly seated us. Since it was around 6pm, which seems like that's an early time for Atlantians to eat dinner, there were only a few other people in the restaurant besides us which was great! The man asked us if we had ever been there before and went through what our red and green cards were and how they were to be used. He asked how we liked our meat cooked and gave us the supportive cards; mine was for medium. After his spill, our server for the night came and talked to us again about how the cards worked and we were off to the salad bar. The salad bar here is very clean and there weren't any drops of food on the counters. It looked like they had refilled it for the dinner times. I had some Brazilian greens and a regular salad. The greens were really good! I could eat those all day. Our waiter also asked if we wanted cheese bread and gave each of us a roll. They pretty much are small rolls stuffed with mozzarella cheese on the inside. \\n\\nAfter a while, the fun started. We turned our cards to green and the meat came out rather quickly one after another. There was a lot to try and we both tasted everything that came our way, except I was more into trying out the variety of beef over anything else like the pork. All of the meat that was brought out tended to be at either the medium or medium rare level. This didn't bother me even though I had a medium card, but if you want medium well or well done then you better pay close attention. The meats were seasoned almost perfectly as they were neither under or over seasoned, but just right and they were all very tender. My favorite meats were the rump steak, top sirloin, and the filet mignon. We found out later, after wondering where the chicken hearts were, that some of the meats have to be asked for in order for them to get cooked and brought out. The chicken hearts were better than I expected them to be for my first time trying them.\\n\\nRed and Green has really good food and for the time that we arrived, we avoided having more patrons in the restaurant that the waiters had to serve with the meats so the time in between each ended up being probably less than 8 minutes. It really didn't take them much time to bring them around during the 6 o clock hour so I suggest this dinner time for people looking for a good experience with not much wait. When 7pm came, more customers were being seated and in need of meat so the time in between was more noticeable. It's all about what you are willing to wait for.\\n\\nI'll be back and I'll be trying out more Brazilian steakhouses in Atlanta!"},{"name":"Fresh To Order","address":"860 Peachtree St NE, Ste B","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I like coming to Fresh To Order because they have quick healthy meal options.

It's one of those places that is frequented more for it's Chinese-American variety, but they also have the \\"other menu\\" for their Chinese patrons.  The bottom line?  Everything is cheap and good.\\n\\nThe decor won't impress anyone, in fact, I would say minimalistic is a great / wrong way to describe this place.  It doesn't look like the fast food joint that used to occupy the spot, that's for sure.  I still think there is a drive through window on the left side of the restaurant, but that might be sealed up already.  The place despite being on the smaller side, is well equipped to handle larger groups though anything beyond 6 may be pushing it.  The tables are clean and the place is well maintained, even the bathrooms are solid.\\n\\nThe food is good and the prices are extremely reasonable.  A large hot and sour soup only ran us for $5.99 and an entire Crispy Chicken (Zha Zi Ji) was a mere $10.95.  That sounds like a lot, but the portion size was good enough to feed 5 people, so that works out just fine.  Also on their hot list is a decent attempt at Honey Spareribs (Tian Dao Pai Gu) and Fish Beancurd Soup (Mei Yu Dou Fu).  However, the rest of the stuff that I've sampled here was pretty subpar to say the least.  That said, on their busiest nights they have quite a few Chinese customers.  And on their empty nights, this place is nearly dead.\\n\\nDon't let it stop you from wanting to come out here.  The exclusive parking is spacious and the service is fabulous.

I really didn't like standing in a line for nearly 20 minutes to get the meat and fish options. Everyone was in this line and my food got cold while waiting. The soups were fairly good and there were 5 options such as Cream of mushroom, Gumbo, Mulligatawny, and Black eyed peas w/ham & mustard greens soup.  The Gumbo was better was at Boatwright's in Port Orleans Resort.   The grits were some of the best I've tasted - creamy and smooth but not doctored up at all with any other ingredients.  The mixed sweet & white potato hash was lightly spiced and not too sweet or rich.  The kid's macaroni looked rich and cheesy but I didn't try it.  The couscous with spices and nuts and currants was simply delicious.  \\n\\nThe pistachio crusted Salmon was dry and way too sweet.  Not for us.  I believe the carved meat was prime rib and it was absolutely wonderful.  Medium rare, flavorful and moist.  Of the many delectable sauces to put on your meat or rice the favorite at our table was the Tamarind BBQ sauce for the chicken.  I also tried the Hummus and a red colored dip next to it and both were really great.  Pita bread or lentil crackers were offered for the dips.  There was lots of fresh fruits like Pineapple and Watermelon which is always a plus at buffets!  I expected more curry but the only dish I noticed was a corkscrew cold macaroni dish in a light mayonnaise curry sauce which tasted much better than I had expected it to at first sight.  It wasn't overcooked but al dente.  There were many other side dishes but only a couple mains such as the Bobotii.  That dish was just alright, but I wasn't really impressed.\\n\\nFor dessert there was a tiny Cassava cake which I absolutely loved due to its unusual texture and mildly sweet coconut aftertaste.  Others in our party didn't like it.  All of us enjoyed the small raspberry mouse.  The Kenya Coffee mouse in a small chocolate tart was OK but a bit too creamy and rich.  The chocolate chip cookies and Oatmeal Raisin we wonderful.  I tried the Zebra Domes and they were OK.  As with many other Disney restaurants I was unimpressed with the service.  At one point she asked me to gather up the dirty dishes and hand them to her.  We weren't in a booth or inaccessible so all she had to do was walk around our table.  Rude and not at all deserving of the recommended 18 - 20% tip.  This buffet is expensive - I think it's worth $30 each but not the $40/per person they charged and at that price so I expect really great service.  Throughout our meal services our waiters simply got drinks then disappeared.  That left a bad taste in everyone's mouth despite the fact the majority of dishes we tried were really tasty and fresh."},{"name":"La Scala","address":"4199 W Dublin Granville Rd","city":"Dublin","stars":"3.5","text":"I know this might not be the right place for a wedding review but I am posting this everyplace I can think of because I cannot begin to express how happy I am that we held our wedding at La Scala.

Think semi sweet tofu, cooked as if it were a creme br√ªl√©e shell on the top with a custard filling in the inside covered in a lightly salted sauce; delicious. \\n\\nThe dessert was a fried bao with cinnamon ice cream in the inside:  the taste was fine but I thought it was more work than it was worth. \\n\\nI give this place 4/5 with it being a nice departure from the typical Asian ; however, I couldn't eat it more than twice a week."},{"name":"On The Bayou","address":"3120 S Cobb Dr","city":"Smyrna","stars":"3.5","text":"Can't believe this place has been here for 2 years and I've never stopped to eat, great food and service.

If only Yelp had a \\"not available\\" checkbox under \\"Parking\\", I could make this more clear.\\n\\nThe Java Iced Tea excited me at first, with a nice dark crimson red base. But, as I started to drink it, it began tasting more and more like pancakes and maple syrup. What?\\n\\nThe vegetable rolls were mushy and flavorless. The banana rolls were a bit too sweet/greasy for my taste.\\n\\nI was glad to see that they hadn't changed the curry coconut soup. That stuff was always delicious and is great for clearing out the sinuses. In fact, the soup is the only reason I'm not giving them 2-stars.\\n\\nThen my main course, L9, I believe - spicy red curry with tofu. Meh. The vegetables were not cooked consistently, and I found the sauce rather sweet. It missed some of the typical curry notes and seemed to replace them with pepper.\\n\\nNow, with a full belly, I'm wishing I ate about 1/2 of each of the items that I tried.

If you're lucky enough to get there a little early, you might see them actually making all of the elixirs by hand and get the inside scoop on how everything is made.  These drinks really are amazing.

They also have a standard menu created from some of the best options on the rotating menu, so you have some staples you can rely on every time. The duck confit and the duck fat fingerling potatoes will give you life, but I also recommend getting a couple things off the rotating menu just to check it out. You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu.\\n\\nThe Consulate is conveniently located right off the Midtown Marta stop, so it's really easy to get to with public transportation.

He was totally happy that we were going to Blue Star, as he's had their donuts before, but has never been to this location. \\n\\nNo line on a Friday morning! Hooray! We took our time looking at the many flavors they had, and settled on five flavors between the 3 of us. We had the PB & J with Marionberry Jam, Cointreau Cr√®me Br√ªl√©e, Chocolate Almond Ganache, Buttermilk Old Fashioned, and Cinnamon Sugar. The hubby loved the Buttermilk Old Fashioned as prefers cake over raised donuts. I had a bite and loved it. So much flavor in each tender bite. I love raised donuts, so I enjoyed the PB & J which had a delicious Marionberry Jam filling and the Cointreau Cr√®me Br√ªl√©e which had a nice amount of liqueur to go with every bite of the donut.  The Chocolate Almond Ganache was quite decadent! Great chocolate flavor, but sticky so lick those fingers. Don't waste all that chocolate goodness. \\n\\nThe hubby approves of their coffee. I believe they brew Coava Coffee. Black coffee went really well with our donuts. \\n\\nWhat I like most about their donuts is that they're light, and not too sweet. You can actually taste the flavor of the fillings and coatings. They make a brioche dough (a la South of France), and use milk and European-style butter from local farms for their dough. All toppings and flavors also change with the season. \\n\\nOh and if you're looking for another reason to visit this location, SE Hawthorne is a pretty awesome street.

The \\"salad bar\\" was out of everything except dressing and black olives. Maybe like 8 selections to begin with...\\nSoup: Literally plain water with some of their plain boiled pasta spirals in it. There were a few dried herbs floating on top but it had absolutely ZERO taste. \\nPasta: plain, unsalted boiled spirals, optional canned red sauce, Zero taste.\\nPizza: We were there at 7:00 on a Friday night and the place was busy but it seems they don't cook pizza based on how many people are there trying to eat. There were 3 pizzas on the line when we first went to get some. All of them had very sparse toppings on about the inner 1/3 of the pizza and the toppings were so strange... one had pineapple and nothing else, one looked like frozen spinach and no sauce, and one had about 15 grains of what i think was sausage on the entire pizza. Do they know pizza is supposed to have cheese on it? \\nDrinks: Seriously!!!

I have been to their other locations in Flushing NY and Cali, and this place is just as good if not better. We got the half and half (Original and Spicy), and it was the best hot pot broth I've ever had (I have had countless hot pot my whole life). It was so rich and flavorful that we didn't need any dipping sauces as recommended. Their server told us that the broth took about 6-8 hours to prepare. Almost all other hot pot places I've been to only give you watered down \\"broth\\", so you can't even compare it with this place. We also tried their New Zealand spring lamb even though we are not huge fans of lamb; to our surprise, the NZ lamb pared so well with the broth that we ended up ordering more. I especially loved the fried Chinese donut as well...so good with the spicy broth. Overall, the portion was very generous, and definitely worth the $25 we paid per person. We got here at 6:30pm on a Friday night, and it was completely packed by 6:45, so do get here early or make reservation ahead of time.\\nAfter our meal, we went down the block to Toscanini's for ice cream (also amazingly good), and it couldn't be anymore convenient."},{"name":"Fresh To Order","address":"860 Peachtree St NE, Ste B","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"The menu looks great, food is nice and fresh.

The nachos and tots were just a bit bland overall. \\n\\nBut enough about the food, you're coming here for the beer! Slumbrew is my favorite Boston-area craft brew (ok, maybe tied with Aeronaut).

When we arrived they were playing some really really bad metal, which combined with the crowd noise, was just noise, and definitely not the mood I was wanting to be in.

That was interesting and surprising. Just about every restaurant I go to, (and I don't go to the really expensive ones so I can't tell you about those), if the dish has feta cheese it will usually be an infinitesimal amount. Not so here. This Greek Plate was clearly ABOUT the feta, of which I got a very surprisingly generous dose -- and the kalamata olives were in a nice amount as well. There were some bread slices for dipping into oil and I don't know what kind of bread it was but it seemed like it was fresh out of a very nice bakery. There were nice slices of fresh tomato and mixed greens, a few slices of purple onion. Very nice (though a bit high-calorie). \\n\\nThe trees in the outside patio area are MARVELOUS, giving lots of shade and where, if you are facing south from your table, you can gaze upon an amazing block-long mural that has been painted on the building across the street.

I was there on a Sunday at lunchtime and there was a band playing (for the hat). GREAT band -- including a fiddle, great lead vocalist and might good lyrics to some mighty nice songs, though I would REALLY prefer the music had been louder. Until I moved to a table quite near the band I would not make out many of the words. I hope no new sound ordinance was behind that problem. I have no idea how often the band members play there, but if they are any indication of the type of music to expect there I give it an unqualified two thumbs up for \\"Authentic Austin Homegrown Music.\\"\\n\\nWhat a wonderful way to spend some time, eating good and generally healthy food (not cheap, but not expensive either) and just digging the atmosphere.\\n\\nInside there are tables too, and there are connections in several places for people that need to hook up their laptops for the Internet. About 4-5 tables inside were clearly inhabited by seriously-studying students, as well as 2-3 of the tables outside. \\n\\nI needed a phone book to look up the address of a movie theater while I was there, and the very friendly wait staff pointed out to me the bookshelf area with the telephone books.

Anyways, the interior is pretty nice with comfy seats and wooden decor. They also have a bar/lounge area and they offer happy hour from 3-6 pm.\\n\\nWe started off with the Japanese Gyoza, which features pork dumplings with hot mustard and a spicy sauce. These are pretty pricey gyozas, since an order comes with only 6 gyozas and costs $12. Everyone quite enjoyed these as the sauce was delicious and they were pretty well made. J did mention that she wished they came sizzling hot. They were rather lukewarm.\\n\\nThe Rainbow Roll featured Ahi tuna, salmon, crab, and topped with a sriracha aioli. I was surprised that it was actually pretty well executed since it's not a Japanese restaurant and the flavours worked well together. Basically a Califronia roll but topped with salmon and ahi tuna. We all agreed that the rice was a bit cold and seemed like it was premade and refrigerated though.\\n\\nFor my entr√©e, I was sad to hear that my favourite Beef Dip was removed from the menu. Perhaps it's because beef is so expensive now! Anyways, V and I both ended up getting the Ahi Tuna Club and paired it with a Caesar salad for my side. The sesame bun was filled with two large slices of Ahi tuna that was grilled to medium rare, bacon, onion rings, and some sweet pepper relish. It was a mouthful but the tuna was seared on point and I liked the crunchiness and sweetness of the onion rings. I wasn't a huge fan of that sweet pepper relish though. The salad had just the right amount of dressing and was topped with a generous amount of Parmesan cheese and croutons.\\n\\nM got the Bacon Cheddar Burger and paired it with sweet potato fries. A classic and it seemed like he had no complaints about it.\\n\\nS got the Sashimi Tuna Salad which had seared rare Ahi tuna, mango, peanuts, avocado, tomatoes, and a cilantro ginger dressing. The tuna was seared perfectly with the edges being slightly seared and the center a beautiful pinkish red. Delicious and visually pleasing as well!\\n\\nJ got her go to Beach Salad, which comes with strawberries, quinoa, candied pecans, avocado, lemon poppy seed dressing, and grilled chicken breast. It normally also comes with goat cheese, but she asked for it on the side.\\n\\nIt was all tasty and good...until she found a piece of chicken that was still raw. We notified the waitress and she had the kitchen cook up a brand new set of chicken.\\n\\nTo finish, we had their famous Baked to Order Apple Pie. This is a must order if you like pie! The menu claims that the pastry is hand-folded, and I'm not sure if that's true, but the pastry is the star of the dish. Extremely flaky and one of the best pie crusts I've had. The pie is filled with cinnamon coated apples and toasted almonds, and topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. It also comes with maple syrup which was asked to have on the side. A delicious way to end our meal!\\n\\nOverall, the food at JOEY Broadway is pretty good (other than their failure to cook chicken). Service though, is a hit or miss. I've had some pretty good service in the past, but this specific time was terrible. Our appetizers arrived rather quickly, but then the wait began... Our entrees took literally another 30 minutes to come and our waitress seemed lost and confused. She even came back to confirm our orders, so it seemed like she had forgotten our orders.

Pull in their lot to park (no signs saying I can't).  Get inside and on the menu it says \\"you can't park in our lot\\".   (OK, but why not put a sign outside?)  I ask the bartender for ideas, she doesn't give me any good options, like I am shyte out of luck.   I go move my car and park in a sketchy lot outside a meth lab across street.  \\n\\nGo to order.  4 beers on tap.  Boo.  Need to order at bar since server won't come over to us.  Then says we need to tell her right now if its one tab or if we are splitting it.  Whatever, but is that necessary?   And why is your beer the same price as a regular bar when it's sitting in the big tanks right next to us?   Shave off a buck or two for no distribution costs.\\n\\nOrder food.   Beers for 4 of us take a bit long to pour (we are only ones there besides one guy at bar).   Beer is OK, had it before.   Food comes out.  Wow.  How dare they charge for, or even serve, this...\\n\\nGot pulled pork sandwich.   It would be cruel to serve this to a prisoner who committed horrific crimes against humanity.   Roll was crazy stale.   The stuff inside was about a 2/10 on the pulled pork rating scale.  And there wasn't much of it, which was almost like they did me a favor.  Barely any BBQ sauce, dry, and skimpy.  Friends got roast beef.  I didn't believe them but they swear it was worse than my order and not really edible.\\n\\nNext up, their \\"tater tots\\".  (I think this whole tot trend is total b.s.   Just make some damn fries.  This is 'merica.)   I actually felt bad for these tater tots.  They were sorry little soggy mush piles of microwaved potatoes.   A lunch lady is rolling over in her grave somewhere.   The menu said they come with \\" our amazing chipotle ketchup\\".  We got no ketchup.  Then we asked, and got plain old ketchup.   Is this some sort of cruel new reality show where they want to see how much they can do wrong before people walk out?\\n\\nI will stop there but could go on.   Here's my advice:  Don't go here.

It is a bad mistake.\\n\\nI am a Japanese who lives in Boston for five years. I know ramen very well and how it should taste... which is far beyond tastier than the ramen offered in Men-Tei.\\n\\nTheir food is just not good. Simple as that. Their Shoyu-ramen (soy sauce) lacks both taste and color. It comes with thinnest soup defies the definition of soy sauce, the bean sprout which is tasteless, a tiny amount of bamboo shoot, distortional naruto, and soaking wet nori-seaweed. Their noodle isn't that bad, but nothing remarkable. A 3-minutes Maruchan noodle could be tastier than a ramen offered in here.\\n\\nSame goes with miso: it is not any better than floating noodles in instant miso soup you can easily find on any oriental market. You can just go to Cherry mart like across the corner and they must have something better. Their Yasai-ramen (vegetable ramen) lacks vegetable (which cast very philosophical question--what makes vegetable ramen vegetable ramen?), and their Chashoo-ramen (ramen with pork) lack it's taste.\\n\\nNow, to be fair, I think I know where they coming from. I believe they are aiming more of healthy delicate tasting which may be common on Midwest side of Japan (e.g. Kyoto or Osaka). But I have to say, they are not succeeding. What they are offering is nothing more than noodle floating on colored water. At least it is not a ramen that gastronomist Bostonian expects.\\n\\nNot to mention, they just include the gratuity in the service which is not very common in this sort of fast-food restaurant. Does it worth it? I'd say no. The waiter in this restaurant is not very helpful. He speaks neither English nor Japanese to communicate, won't give you any recommendation of food, and, hell, not even pour water to a cheap-ass plastic cup when you get thirsty by pecking salty fried rice. It is not so difficult to imagine they have started charging for not doing anything because no one is giving them tips.

The gnocchi was fine, a little to heavy, I think for gnocchi to be good it has to be fresh made, I've never liked it all that much when it's not.  The one thing I didn't like was there was cheese melted on top, I'm not one that's much for a big mess of cheese on my pasta, a little is fine but this was overkill, to me it just takes away from the meal not enhances it.

Once our food was dropped off at our table, that was the last we heard from our server. She didn't check back to see how our meals were, whether or not I needed a box (which I did), and never dropped off the check. I needed to leave so left some cash with my boyfriend and left. He called me on his cell 15 minutes later to say he grew tired of waiting for her to drop off the check so he went to the bar to ask for it himself. She made eye contact, heard his request for a check, and continued to ignore him. Let me reiterate, the only other customers in the entire place were a one top and a three top. This was definitely not a rush. My boyfriend got so frustrated he finally just left some money on the counter and left with no objection from our server.

The decor, as many reviewers have pointed out, is beautiful and modern.  There are just enough touches imported from Vietnam to tie the theme of the room together without veering into the kitsch.  \\n\\nWe ordered the bun bo hue and the pho Hoang.  Both bowls came out quite quickly and the broths were both delicious.  I liked how my bun bo hue was not too spicy while still giving some heat.  It also had a good meaty flavour (some places have the broth too sweet).  There was a generous amount of beef brisket and the traditonal pork knuckle.  It did not have the also-traditional cube of pork blood, but as I don't eat blood anyway I didn't miss it! The pho broth was also deeply meaty without being too salty, and also had a selection of meats within.  The only thing I'm docking a star for was that the pho lacked the tripe and tendon included in the menu description - the tendon being my husband's favourite part.  He still ate it and enjoyed it but it would have been nice to have a heads up if they had run out. \\n\\nThe liquor menu also has quite a few cocktails to choose from, in keeping with being a more modern type of restaurant.  My husband had the Green Lantern and found it quite refreshing.  \\n\\nOur meal for two came to under $40 before tips, which isn't bad for date night, and we were full.\\n\\nI'm going to agree with another reviewer and say that although the price point is higher than your typical hole-in-the-wall pho place, the ambiance, service, and presentation are also at a higher level, so hopefully visitors will keep this in mind and they wont suffer too many complaints about it being \\"too expensive\\" for this type of cuisine.

It was a meal to remember.  We waited too long to make reservations, but luckily they had a table open for 5 pm.  We had a series of dishes during the 2 hours that we were there, and some fabulous, unique drinks.  We started with the Chopped Tuna Crudo from the Raw Bar and it was heavenly.  We also had the Blue Crab & Angel Hair Pasta, which was our favorite.   We also ordered the Smoked Mackerel and the Italian Sausage Pizza, both wonderful.  I had the Pearl Diver's Punch and everyone else drank delicious wines from their menu.

I've been there twice; once for brunch and another time for dinner.\\n\\nWhen we got there a little after 11am, which was a Sunday, we had to wait for 5 to 7 minutes for a table to open. They have plenty of seating, but they only use the front for breakfast. I believe the back area is closed. Also, after placing our order, we waited about 15 minutes for our juices to be brought to our table. My partner ordered fresh squeezed orange juice was was very small, maybe 5 ozs of Juice. \\n\\nOur waitress was very friendly, polite, and smiled a lot. We both ordered the omelettes, which came with potatoes. Mine came with broccoli. The food was good. I have no complaints. My omelette was cooked properly and was flavorful. With tip, we spent about $33. The prices are reasonable. I will go back for brunch again, but I hope they improve with faster service. They do not have salt or pepper on tables. I think some Tabasco sauce would be nice as well. \\n\\nAnother time, I went for dinner when it first opened.We orderd the Mac and Cheese with bacon. I really enjoyed it but I remember my partner saying he could not not taste the bacon as there was not much in it. I recommend it highly. I ordered the Chicken Parm dinner, which was an average tasting chicken parm. Nothing special about it. I am not much of a cook, and it tasted like the one I cooked from a recipe from the cooking network. The chicken breast was very large, and I did not leave hungry. My partner ordered the fisherman's stew (named something different). He said it was very good. I tried the broth, which was very good. The service that time was also slow, but they had just opened, so this was expected.\\n\\nAs for the theme of the place, I don't understand why everyone makes a big deal about it. I would call it new wave/60s retro. Then again, I know nothing about designing. I think it is kinda cool. I really like the art work, with characters such as the Simpsons, the Flint stones, ect,\\n\\nI will go back but they need to be a little faster. Otherwise, I would have given 4 stars.

A sign would have been good. As I was ordering they got what I wanted so it was ready when I was done. That was good.

The food prep area just sort of out in the open.  The menu is shockingly bare as well for my tastes and the calories are quite a bit for even mostly veggie meals.

Comprised of fresh shredded vegetables and roast duck  with a delicious tangy sauce, it was an instant favorite. I had the spicy beef noodle soup which comes in a huge steaming bowl of heavenly smelling broth with bits of floating red pepper. The broth is complex: sweet, sour, meaty and a high note of chili pepper. The veggies, noodles and beef are almost incidental, but they provide a nice texture, especially the garnishes of bean sprouts, basil and lime.

But it was good nontheless.\\n\\nThe scone was good sized, the soft and cakey sort, and tasty.  A good buy!\\n\\nI'm going to have to go back sometime to try their cinnamon swirl loaf and some of those flavored whipped honey $6.35 that they have stocked from Honeyville - the peach amaretto sounded especially good...\\n\\n3/2010 - Cinnamon Chip Swirl Bread $5.85, fat loaf, white bread (not at all cakey) with swirls of cinnamon.  Tasty.\\n\\n5/2012 - Cinnamon Chip Swirl Bread $6.50, fat loaf of white bread that tends to separate at the cinnamon swirl seams.  They can't slice it there for you, but it is still tasty.\\n\\n8/2012 - The Cinnamon Chip is still $6.50.  I also tried the Cheddar Garlic $6.95 today which had this huge piece of garlicky cheese hidden within.  It was tasty.  I enjoyed it straight and toasted with a bruschetta topping.  I was also offered a Buy 12 Loaves - Get One FREE! card, which I gladly accepted.\\n\\n5/2013 - One Saturday afternoon I ran over and picked up 3 loaves: Bruschetta Twist $7.50, Cheddar Garlic $6.95 and Challah $4.95.  I ended up leaving the Challah at a friend's place where we broke into the Cheddar Garlic with dinner - a lovely addition for sopping up the lovely salad dressing and marsala sauce - yum!\\n\\nThe next day it was commented that the bruschetta loaf was like eating pizza of a sort.  It went pretty quick."},{"name":"Chez Nous","address":"510 Neches St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"This place was a little strange, since the experience of dining here seems to need a  polar opposite effect for it to work.

The staff are friendly and fast which is great always a plus.\\n\\nGoing back to the great meats they have, my theory is that they obviously marinate them before cooking but afterwords, they place the cooked meats in a warm sealed metal containers where the juices, grease, and goodness marinates the meat even further right after it comes off the grills.

The Ballroom is the most beautiful room, and an EXACT replica of the famous ballroom from the film. The room has extravagant architectural designs, drapery, and a fully-windowed wall looking out onto a dark night with gentle snow.

I am a HUGE Bobby Flay fan, and while waiting on a connecting flight to take me to my TDY in Ohio, I had the pleasure of coming through the Atlanta airport. I was starved, sleep deprived, and soooo thirsty, but opted to hold off on food and drink and begin the epic journey from Concourse F to Concourse B (it made sense- if I reached the point where medical attention became necessary I didn't want to be confronted with a near death experience FOLLOWED BY the journey to the center of the earth. It took every muscle in my rapidly failing body to hold myself up in the underground tram. I made it with minimal hallucinations (I literally thought i saw my former mustached boss man 4 different times, each time to no avail after a second glance- and once it was a chic). So it stands to reason that when, from 15 gates away I saw the 70s lookin Bobby's Burgers sign, I had very little hope that this mirage at the end of of my travels was any different than had I been staring at the Egyptian Pyramids, Elton John, or a talking parrot. But it was REAL! \\n\\nIve only ever eaten at one other celebrity restaurant and was highly disappointed, but cmon. It's Robert Gerard Flay. I wasn't gonna miss this opportunity. Menu looked amazing. Simple (which is great), basically various specialty burgers, onion rings/fries/sweet potato fries, a salad option and few other things. And shakes. \\n\\nWhen you walk into the establishment, you stand at a menu board and order. Another individual takes your ticket to seat you with a number sign to place on your table to indicate which customer/ticket you are. You don't pay until later. You have a server to tend to your needs and also a plethora of food runners. The concept, considering anything in an airport is time sensitive, is SPOT ON. You order before you are seated so ur food is cooking before you even sit down, and u don't pay when you're ordering to prevent the lines from backing up. Fastest operation I've seen ever with a scratch made food operation. \\n\\nSo this is why I'm a sad burger girl. I had a couple in front of me getting rang up (we'll call them Hannibal and Clarice). That was it for the line but the spot was bustling so they were definitely on their grind. Hannibal and Clarice order and are immediately seated, I took all of two seconds to order my lemonade, onion rings, and Atlanta Burger (pimento cheese and fried pickles- I love the south). Total was 20 bucks. Better be a damn good burger, but I'm sure 10 of those dollars were simply because of who's name was on the sign.\\n\\nIt's a relatively small interior so everyone can see everyone. Seated after me is 2 guys (Vincent and Jules), then an elderly gentleman (Feeney), another solo lady like myself (Nancy), and a then a solo man (might have been Glen from The Walking Dead- I mean, I am in Atlanta so it makes sense). \\n\\nHannibal and Clarice, immediately served. Cool. Got it. They were right in front of me in line, means my food will be out soon. I'm greeted by a very sweet lady who brings me my fresh lemonade. YAAAAAY!Well, then Vincent and Jules who were behind me are served their food and start chowing down. \\n\\nHm. Ok. But still- YAAY lemonade!\\n\\nThen my burger is brought to me by a food runner who I make eye contact with as she approaches so I know the time has finally...finally.....finally come.....and.....it has a big scoop of green on top (clearly guacamole, clearly NOT pimento cheese- unless it was in which case there are far worse problems than just getting my order wrong). I say to the young lady \\"I ordered the Atlanta Burger\\" and she gives me a brief blank stare, to which I reply \\"pimento cheese and fried pickles\\"....after a shared moment of silence, me in mourning and her in what I can best guess to be confusion, she says rather abruptly \\"so this isn't yours?\\" Well, uh, I know BBQ sauces can be regional and vary pretty greatly in color depending on where you are...hot sauces....curries....gang colors....but I know for damn sure I never saw Atlanta on Food Network bragging that they have the greenest cheese you'll find on the east coast. \\n\\nSo no, young lady, that is not my burger. But Mmm.

When we visited, we were some of the only people present, but it was about 6:00 in the evening.\\n\\nIn case anyone reading this doesn't know exactly what is meant by \\"Brazilian steakhouse\\" it refers to a restaurant where a flat fee is paid in exchange for an unlimited amount of food and (usually) access to some sort of a salad bar. Most technically speaking, that is what you get here. Technically. \\n\\nThe variety and quality of meats available isn't bad, but it's not great either. The basic cuts are there - filet, several different types of pork, chicken and lamb, but quality-wise, it just does not compare in anyway whatsoever to the quality Brazilian steakhouses in the area. What kills it for Red and Green, and why I will never visit again, is how they handle their service. You are given one or two small cuts of meat - which is fairly typical at this type of restaurant - and it will be like pulling teeth to get that cut of meat again. Or another biscuit. Or anything else for that matter. It's truly as if the service staff is trying to \\"wait\\" you out, making sure they serve as little as they possibly can during the time you are there. \\n\\nIt's about $35 per person to eat here (for the meal itself). Fogo may be a little more expensive, but your plate or glass will never be empty, you don't feel as if the staff is intentionally holding back food and if you want a particular item and ask for it, it will be delivered promptly. I can't emphasize this enough: if you're in the mood to go to a Brazilian steakhouse, just spend the few extra bucks and leave happy and full instead of disappointed and feeling cheated.\\n\\nTwo stars is being charitable.\\n\\nPros: Food isn't terrible.\\n\\nCons: Service staff tries to \\"wait\\" you out.

I mean, you do have to realize that we probably don't eat enough to justify going to a buffet for a meal anyway, but I didn't think the food was mind-blowing enough for that price.\\n\\nBut if we say that for every $10 of Disney, it's $5 in the real world, then this would probably be more like a $25 per person restaurant in the real world. So that's actually not too bad.\\n\\nAlso, if you're not adventurous, this probably isn't the place for you. They offered fufu, creamed corn (?), a selection of hummuses (hummusi? hummuseses?) with pita bread, and other African dishes. I probably don't have diverse enough taste buds to enjoy these delicacies.\\n\\nSo, if you're adventurous, rich, and have a highly expandable stomach, this is the place for you. If you're a simple eater, poor, and have a stretch-resistant stomach, I would suggest the Golden Corral."},{"name":"Pine State Biscuits","address":"3640 SE Belmont St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Thanks to Guy Fieri and his show DDD (Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives) I was able to find out about this wonderful place that serves homemade biscuits and gravy!!\\n\\nWe got there at perfect timing since the place itself is super small (hole in the wall) we were afraid it would be too packed for us to find a seat.

Two pieces of triangular layered bread pudding that was very right in taste and the size was just right for a dessert.

It's also a crime against humanity to run a takeout place in 2017 and not have any form of online ordering.

I understand some places become much more of a bar scene at night, but it was maybe 830 and they already had a band playing far too loud. The service is so slow. Not only was it understaffed, but the bartender had no sense of urgency despite how many people were trying to order drinks. $9 for a well vodka and Red Bull is way too much. The other drinks were just way too sweet. We got a mixed plate to try the food. It was okay, but I've had better at several different places. Presentation of it wasn't great and I'm used to getting more sauce to add to the rice. Not a huge deal on that, but it's kind of standard. We both really liked the mac salad though. We were at the bar, so we got our food timely, but we watched every time food came out the poor runner looking around and wandering to find the person who's food he had.

If you are looking for fine dining while on your trip to WDW it doesn't get better than Jiko's.  Located inside the Animal Kingdom Lodge, this place is festive and different. Make sure to dress up as this isn't a shorts kind of place.  \\n\\nI don't know about you but how many times have you had South African food?  I live in Los Angeles and we have great variety of ethnic food but South African has escaped me until I paid a visit to Jiko's several years ago. It wasn't until I feel inlove with Jiko's that I found a cool South African bar near Sherman Oaks. If I can't make it to Florida I go there. Anyhoo, I digress.\\n\\nI have been to Jiko's four times now and each time has been exceptional.  The food is just fabulous.  It's exotic enough to excite a foodie and not too exotic to scare away people like my dad, who is a fast food/chainy kind of guy.  \\n\\nSpeaking of Dad, I took him here for the first time on this last trip and the guy was making sounds as in mmmm and yumm throughout the meal.   The guy loved his coconut bread pudding so much that he refused to share with anyone nor take a bit of anyone else's dessert because he wanted to keep the flavor of the dessert in his mouth!!! Can you believe that?  I about died laughing. (Dad is not one to spring $$$ on nice food too much)  Oh yeah, did I mention he hates coconut (although he loves bread pudding hence why he choose it) but savored every last bite?  I think I have finally convinced him that paying $$ for really good food is an okay thing to do. \\n\\nEven my little one and a half year old nephew loved the place and he  is picky!!  You can read about what other people love. It's all pretty good.   But I will tell you a few of my musts when visiting:\\n\\n1.  You must order flatbread.  BBQ chicken is a good one. But any flavor will do.\\n2. You must order South African Beer or Wine.   Drink the wine with dinner and have them pair it with your entree.  (Best wine of my life was a South African wine I had here). \\n3. The Mac and cheese is delicious!\\n4. You carby people who are watching calories need to put your fears aside when it comes to the bread basket. They make kick a** bread with a spicy butter. You have to have a piece or two or three!\\n5.  The Filet Mignon is my absolute favorite thing to eat.  (Oh yeah, make sure to ask for the side of mac and cheese).  You can substitue it for the asperagus or sometimes if you smile you can get both!  When the chef changed a while back some people said they stopped serving it. But just ask and they will give it to you!  Do it!\\n6  You must save room for dessert! They have so many good ones you are bound to order just the right one.  If you are in a group you better all order something different and share bites. \\n7. Don't forget to tip your waiter. They deserve it. They guys work hard here!  The service is great!\\n8. Go here your first or second night because if you wait till the end you will be full from your dining plan and believe me you want to be able to eat your heart out here. \\n9. Bring cashola!! Lots of it. But its worth it.  Better yet, use two meal points fromt he dining plan and pay for another cheap place. Its soooo worth it!!\\n10.  Most importanly make reservations now!!

First of all I'm a vegan and I always order from their vegan menu. Early this morning on 10/14/18 around 1:30am I was given real chicken I got all the way home I took a bite from my food and immediately spit it out. I took it back to the restaurant and I was very calm and courteous. I told them for the inconvenience I wanted a refund on my food for having to come back and have it made again vegan style. One of the middle age male workers came to me and said that it is stupid and doesn't make since for me to want a refund and made over and the older male that's always there late at night then came and said you just trying to get money back. I clearly stated to him that I have PLENTY of money and that is not the principle of the entire situation. I told him the point is you gave me real meat when I clearly asked for the vegan style and I had to come back to your place of business to get it right again especially when I have an allergy to chicken. By this time I already had in my mind that I wasn't going to eat the food because I heard the older male go in the back and clear his throat really load and cough. I will NEVER step foot in their doors again, customer service is poor, cooks or order takers aren't paying attention to you ordering and there is a lack of empathy when a mistake has clearly been made. They act like you did something wrong when they are the ones who made the error. This is a very serious matter, especially when customer's have ALLERGIES.

My childhood could be to blame, doughy and flavorless versions were a dime a dozen, I soon understood why honey and butter were required with every helping. Then I had homemade biscuits, the kind that were fluffy and tasted good all on their own, and the various southern varieties that helped ease my scorn taste buds again. Pine State had a hand in this madness, along with 1,500 extra gooey calories of awesomeness. There is a reason why this place is among the highest rated breakfast joints in Portland. Simply put, no one does biscuits better than Pine State.\\n\\nFor as popular Pine State is, there isn't much seating. Pine State's large open kitchen and robust staff cranking out biscuits only add to the perceived dwarfism of the dining area, which if I didn't know any better was no larger than a regular coffee shop. This also creates another problem: crowds and a wait. Pine State is no stranger to crowds of brunch seeking folks who have wait 45 minutes to an hour just to get seated. Parking is another animal that isn't worth mentioning, but I should note that on a week day, the coast is clear..\\n\\nPlace an order at the front desk and quickly get a seat before someone else does.

It's like a fast food chicken biscuit on steroids, crunchy from the fried chicken, fluffy from the biscuit, creamy from the sauce, and savory with the bacon and cheese. It's the one thing on the menu that gets ordered time and time again and might just be PSB's most popular item.\\n\\nOther biscuit combos need love too, take the Chatfield for instance: it's everything the Reggie is, minus the egg and the gravy and plus lots of apple butter. This biscuit is good, equally as filling, and dare I say somewhat light compared to the Reggie. The Wedgie is another favorite, with fried chicken, fried green tomato, iceberg wedge, and blue cheese dressing. Despite its artery clogging goodness, it may be the one biscuity item that may feel \\"healthy\\" with the crispy iceberg lettuce and the juicy fried green tomato. They're not called hash browns here, but the \\"hash ups\\" are decent and virtually the same thing. I can vouch for the andouille corndog, which may feel spendy at $3, but is tasty and has a great texture.\\n\\nBe sure to clean up after yourself since there is no waiter service. Groups should be limited to 4 and no more. Be sure to bring an appetite for four, as the biscuits will surely induce a gastronomical food coma of Pine State proportions."},{"name":"Somerville Brewing Co","address":"15 Ward St","city":"Somerville","stars":"3.5","text":"I went here for the first time recently and quite liked it. Their flights were a little pricey compared to what I'm used to, but the beers had good flavor and there was a very balanced mix of styles on offer, which I always appreciate.  They actually have a full menu and table service, rather than employing the laid back \\"bring your own snacks\\" policy of most taprooms I've been to.  I didn't try the food since I'd already had eaten that night, but will definitely keep that in mind when planning my next visit. It seems like a really nice place for casual dinner and drinks after work.  The only thing that felt a little strange is that the same staff both tended the bar and waited the tables - I think this led to some confusion and inefficiency, particularly since there were two events going on the night I was there in addition to regular patrons all mostly sharing a pretty small space.  \\n\\nI did really love how the space was laid out and decorated.  They really created a very warm and inviting atmosphere in what is basically an open warehouse.  Owner/brewer Caitlin gives tours and classes there as well, and although she tends to speak so quickly I occasionally had trouble understanding her she is extremely friendly and passionate about her craft, and it does show."},{"name":"Bobby's Burger Palace","address":"6000 N Terminal Pkwy, Gate 26 Concourse B","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Honestly, we were impressed with our dinner considering we were sitting in an airport terminal. After ordering at the counter, you find a table and then a waiter comes to confirm your order and grab your drinks. Our food was at our table within 10 minutes, which is great for a connection.\\n\\nI had the Bacon Crunchburger and my wife had the Palace Burger with chicken. It was great that you could choose any of their burgers and make them with chicken, beef, or turkey. The burger was cooked how I asked and full of flavor. The chips are something I've never had on a burger but I loved the added crunch.\\n\\nThe fries were the only disappointment, but they weren't horrible. The sauce they came with was tasty but the fries seemed soggy.\\n\\nOverall, quality option in the B terminal while waiting for a flight."},{"name":"Avid Cider Co","address":"121 NW 9th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Loved our afternoon at this place!

Appetizers were above average but roughly $20 each plate for 3 or 4 bites of unexceptional food just isn't worth it. The scallops and trout were solid but unspectacular but the $60 ribeye was without exaggeration, the worst piece of meat I've ever eaten. We ordered it medium and it came out slightly rare which ended up being okay but the flavor was absolutely terrible. Under-seasoned and it tasted like blood. Absolutely disgusting. \\n\\nThe service was actually pretty good for the most part until dessert which took over 20 minutes to come out, longer than our entrees. We were celebrating a birthday as well and they charged us for the birthday dessert. You would think restaurants would know better than that by now. The patio area was very nice by any measure and the weather was really the only thing keeping us from complaining too much. \\n\\nFor the price, I can't imagine why anybody would eat here. Even if everything was half the price, I still couldn't give this place more than 3 stars. There are so many better restaurants in the area."},{"name":"La Cocina de Consuelo","address":"4516 Burnet Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Chicken enchiladas = YUM\\n\\nBYOB = AWESOME\\n\\nThis places get a sold 4 stars for great food and a cute atmosphere.

We ended up finally leaving out of frustration after we sat there for 25 minutes without the slightest bit of acknowledgement from any of the staff. AND THERES MORE the time before that my boyfriend and i sat down, the waiter was nice and helped us promptly. We ordered our food, my boyfriend ordered rolls, and i ordered udon. He received all of his food after about 15 minutes, and i sat there waiting for mine (the waiter even came to check on us still not realizing i didn't have my food) after about 20 minutes of waiting i asked if my food was even being made, and he told me that they didn't have any staff in the kitchen that night to make my food.... after i ordered and he let me sit there without food for 25 minutes while he brought my boyfriends entire meal. \\n\\nThis restaurant is run like a joke, save yourself the time and money and go elsewhere."},{"name":"Xinh Xinh","address":"7 Beach St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Went to Boston back in August 2010, and after reading the reviews, I just had to come here, since I love pho.\\n\\nWe were greeted very warmly, and they showed us to our seat.

This is classic for setting up meetings or getting a little work done on the side."},{"name":"Rontoms","address":"600 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"How do I love thee, Rontoms?  Let me count the ways.\\n\\n1) The space is fantastic.  It's a really nicely designed bar, with tons of seating.  The bathrooms are really funky (and used to be really beautiful before some moron tagged them).  You kind of feel like you're in a 1970's den when you're here, complete with a sunken living room, and a cool mix of vintage furniture.  \\n\\n2) The patio is humongous and lovely at night.  I'm pretty sure it's heated in the winter, and on a beautiful summer night it's the perfect spot to hang and drink cocktails.\\n\\n3) They have a freakin' ping pong table outside!  Where do you see that?  And it's free.\\n\\n4) The service is good.  Yes, there are people on here that will say otherwise, and the hipster vibe can be a bit much sometimes, but I think it depends on who serves you.  There are some decent folks who work here.  I was there last night and I got very good service, and have every other time I've been here.  My friends and I were all acting like complete fools last night, and we still got good service.  They do make you get your own water which annoyed one of my friends, but whatever.\\n\\n5) The menu.  Yes, it's eclectic, but you can get fondue here.  Melted cheese and bread, need I say more?  It's an interesting mix of midwestern / Scandinavian, cocktail party eats.  You can even get deviled eggs here.  Deviled eggs and liquor seem like a bad combination to me, but to each his own.  The fondue and sandwiches are really tasty.\\n\\n6) The staff has awesome musical taste.  They're always playing good music in here.  Fleet Foxes came on towards the end of the night.\\n\\n7) They have great bands from time to time, and they're often (if not always?) free, which is my favorite price.  I had my going away party here last night, and I got kind of annoyed that a band was setting up when I arrived.  I just wanted to have good conversations with my bff's before I leave town, and I figured the band would get in the way of that, so we went out to the patio.  When I went back inside to use the bathroom, I realized it was Delorean and it was a free show!  How cool is that?  They sounded incredible and it really looked like a house party.  People were just lounging on the couches and watching them play.  There was even a couple full-on making out on one of the couches.  Awkward, but just like a house party.  \\n\\nRontoms is a great Eastside bar and a good place for gatherings.

The first time I went, I had the full dinner.  Amazing.  The second time I went, I was with my best girl and we staggered up to the bar for martini's and ended up eating our weight in food.  They even gave us a free antipasto platter because I couldn't stop raving about the place.  THEN the bartender hooked us up to pass the line of a \\"swanky\\" club near there (which will remain nameless so I can keep my dignity).  The third time I ate here, I didn't.  I was sick and an exboyfriend knew that Teatro's mussels would make me better.  They did.
