And then disclosed that he paid 80$ for said scotch.  Here's the thing.  \\n\\nA. How you made this about Trump I'll never know.  But the simple fact that you bought four glasses of the libation clearly indicates that after the first pour, you felt that it was worth the 20$ you paid and wanted a second, third, and fourth finger.  Pro tip- Nothing in this world is worth any set amount.  It is only ever worth what someone is willing to pay.  This is no different than every restaurant on earth charging 20-100 a bottle for wine when said wine can be bought at Fred Meyer for 6.95$.  Or paying 4.50$ for coffee at Starbucks when the same cup would cost literally .01$ to make at home. \\n\\nB.  If you truly are this smug a person, you literally represent the worst in humanity.  Celebrate the fact that you have 80$ in disposable income to blow on booze and get over yourself.  And may God have mercy on your soul.\\n\\n\\nOh, and for those wondering about the restaurant...\\n\\nBar- two delightful, incredibly skilled tenders.  \\"Church\\" cocktail one of the best I've ever had.  First time in a long time I've walked over to the bar after a meal and slid an extra tip.  \\n\\nAppetizers-  Burrata salad one of the best things I've ever put in my mouth.  Creative, remarkable, hits all the texture buttons and bounces off the palate... who ever came up with the gingerbread crumble to add on is a wizard.  The bread was also delightful.  Not sure how they got the inside to be toasty.  Again, wizard.\\n\\nMain Course-  Lamb Ravioli- again... salty, sweet, crunchy, smooth.... somehow not gamey at all.  The pasta was perfectly toothsome.  Just really remarkable. Canestri- the meatballs blew my mind.  Just the right amount of heat, and pasta again was perfect.  \\n\\nDessert-  Budino.  So much going on, but each creative inclusion somehow begged the presence of each other part.  \\n\\nWait Staff-  My biggest pet peeve at a restaurant is when someone is present, but if you request something they tell you they will ask your server.  Same team!  None of that here.  Our server was a delightful transplant from Georgia.  She was kind, warm, and knowledgeable.  Every other member of the staff was equally kind and helpful, and I found it to be a very welcoming environment.\\n\\nAmbiance- for such a big, open room, it was remarkably quiet and welcoming.  I enjoy the open kitchen setting and the hearth and pizza oven are a sight to see.  \\n\\nCost- 145$.  Which is a lot.  Except... 4 cocktails, 2 entrees, 2 apps, dessert, and coffee... and a high end restaurant... plus a 30$ tip....I would gladly pay the same again.  But, if you don't want to blow that... a pizza and a few drinks for 40 bucks.  That would work too.\\n\\nThank you for a wonderful meal.

We didn't know she was asking us if we wanted soup or appetizers after ordering our entree and she yelled at us because of it. Then, after our meal, she swiped our credit card for another table's order, which was more expensive. If I had not caught this mistake, this miscalculation would have been overlooked.

They could have at least put a piece of parsley on the plate or something- it all looked so bland. Had a Long Island iced tea for about $10 that was almost entirely ice- what a rip-off. My husband ordered a full rack of ribs with rice pilaf and brussel sprouts, and when I asked him how his food was he said it was \\"just okay.\\" Ordered the triple chocolate cookie with ice cream for dessert, and even though it was shown with vanilla ice cream in the menu it was served with chocolate ice cream & chocolate chips (way too much chocolate! We could eat only a few spoonfuls. And speaking of spoons, the dessert was served with one regular spoon and one soup spoon.)

Enter: Restaurante Montecristo. They have a $15 minimum order for delivery, so I added a couple pupusas and coffee to my order. With tax, tip, and delivery, my total came to be around $21. Now, I can see where some might think this is expensive for lunch. However, when my food arrived (20 minutes before the estimated arrival), the bag easily weighed 3-5lbs. I was confused. Didn't I just order soup and a couple pupusas? Yes, I did. But apparently the chicken soup comes with an amazingly seasoned huge portion of a whole chicken (breast, leg, wing), a few servings of rice, and a mini salad, in addition to the tortillas and large container of broth.  Looks like I ordered lunch and got dinner too! Worth mentioning, since I ordered easily spillable items (soup, coffee), said items were diligently wrapped to avoid spillage. Sad not everyone subscribes to such attention to detail.\\n\\nAnyway, the pupusas were amazing, just like the homemade pupusas made by my friend's aunt. I got the pork and wasn't disappointed at all.

This review is mostly about the food. Our servers were welcoming and very helpful, especially when it came to dietary restrictions in our group. We really appreciated that.\\n\\nI found the menu a little weird. There is no overarching theme tying everything together, and I wasn't sure what to expect. Some things looked Italian, others Asian. The dim sum menu was an interesting supplement to the regular menu, but we didn't try anything from it. I think similar farm-to-table, small plate places do a better job of communicating their identity than this place.\\n\\nI ordered the Army Navy for a cocktail, and boy was it strong! You will get your money's worth, though I am not a huge fan of super boozy drinks. I wanted a different drink that was on their menu online but not on the in-person menu, and they were unable to make it. If it was food, I would understand if you don't have the ingredients, but a cocktail? That kind of confused me.\\n\\nAs a vegetarian, I did not get to eat all the dishes that came to our table. Each dish I had was nice on its own, but altogether I found the dishes entirely too salty (and I like salty food). Each dish was doused in lemon juice and/or finished with a layer of salt (so it tasted), which really turned me off. Again, I love both lemony flavors and salty flavors, but I found it really overwhelming at Emmer & Rye. It just made me really thirsty. My friends seemed to enjoy their meat dishes more. We didn't get dessert, as we were full. \\n\\nOverall, food was not great, especially for the price.

After finally being seated, our orders were taken quickly and food was delivered shortly thereafter. The shoyu ramen reminded me of all the ramen houses throughout Tokyo...I was nervous to try the Takoyaki as I've never seen it on a menu outside of Japan, and was skeptical that it would ruin my love for the snack from many years ago - but Yuzu definitely surpassed my expectations ! Nostalgia shortly after kicked in as I reminisced in memories of Japan. \\n\\nWe returned about a week later (with an additional member to our party) fully prepared for the hour long wait, knowing that due to the amazingness of their food, it would definitely be worth it.

But, the drinks were good, and I really appreciated how they spelled out the price of my manhattan in their receipt: they charged for the single of bourbon, and then added just another $1.50 to turn it into a manhattan. Very honest.  I'm glad that they're aren't charging me more than $1.50 for vermouth, bitters, and some little maraschino cherries.  Better than some other places that I recently visited that charged an extra FOUR DOLLARS for those super cheap additions.  Ugh.

The quality of the meats (we had ribs, sausage links, pulled pork, and brisket at our table) was uniformly high. The biscuits were enormous, fluffy and served hot. One disappointment: the sauce selection. They have 3: a super sweet molasses based one, a hot jalapeno infused one, and a thin, nearly tasteless vinegary sauce. I **wanted** to like the vinegar one, since I grew up on eastern NC vinegar based sauces, but this one was effectively zero. No kick, nothing intrresting to it. I tried the other two, and the best of the lot was the jalapeno infused one. Back to the drawing board, folks...I ate my meat without sauce rather than coat it with something subpar (and I like mustard sauces from SC, dry rubs from places like Memphis, and tomato based sauces like western NC).

Seemingly not found in anyone's must eat list, it does healthy business--the dining room was near capacity at 6 pm. It was my first time eating here; I was surprised it was almost as old as I am, as I was only familiar with it from the marquee next to Coaches in the Bethal Center mall, and decided on a whim to try it out as I waited for friends to meet me for a show. \\n\\nOld yes, but the fixtures were new. The place has been remodeled a couple times since founding, recently perhaps. I actually was surprised on entry as the reviews correctly pegged it as a non-frills M&P but it looked more swanky at first. The long hall from door to podium was flanked on the left with a slick brown wall topped by beveled glass. The room to the left, which seemed more formal was empty. In the back I heard the reveries of a bar. I kind of wanted to go there as I was in a barflyish mood, but instead I followed the server to the right into a dinning room which was what I expected--a simple mom-and-pop. \\n\\nHungering for a good Italian sub I picked the Italian Stallion sub which was like an Italian sub on steroids. (I searched the menu for sides called Adrian squash and Apollo Creed side salad to complete the theme but they weren't listed.) It was filled with meat and was very filling. Although it tasted great and was cook right it didn't have any distinguishing features that would set it apart from any other place. But for $9 it had more meat and a better taste than a similar product from Subway or any other chain has for the price. I added French fries which were a bit too hard, lacked taste and had too high of a water concentration in them. (Or at least it seemed like there wasn't much too them, as if they were made partially of air.) I wouldn't say that fries are in their wheelhouse. \\n\\nThe service was straight from the M&P handbook. They were not trained in the fakery of a corporate wait staff, who'll gives you an inauthentic smile and a scripted introduction. If you are the type that expects that then indy businesses are not for you. I on the other hand like authenticity and don't mind not being showered with fakery. This is not to say my waitress was rude, which is never acceptable, she wasn't. She \\ndid her job well without interrupting too much. \\n\\nIn my one experience this is a nice, easy going place to get a decent bite between destinations on a weekend night, or an easy get away on a busy weekday."},{"name":"Felipe's Taqueria","address":"83 Mt Auburn St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"To me this is the best burrito place in the Cambridge/Boston area.

I'm unsure if the honey mustard is made in house, but it's amazing too, and makes the sandwich even better. The bun was soft and warm. The fries were piping hot and perfectly fried. \\n\\nThe second time around, I also ordered the Lox Bagel. It caught me off guard when I got home and realized it contained cream cheese only and no smoked salmon. (I'm assuming it was lox-flavored cream cheese.)

He asked for a purple one and was told, again, simply, \\"No.\\"  I determined that maybe the pretty colored ones were for an event.  \\"Yes\\" was the reply.  WHAT is with the closed-ended responses??  When we finally figured out what we could and could not order, my boyfriend presented his Go Local card.  That got him a free fairy cake.  I asked if we could add a fairy cake to our ORDER, and was told \\"You have to pay for it.\\"  Right.  That's why I wanted it added to the order- I didn't ask for one for free.  \\n\\nI found the food to be mediocre, and for the drive out there from where we live and the weird service, it's not worth it for me to go out of my way to go back.  The whole exchange was off-putting and weird.  By the way, friends with us were able to order bangers along with other breakfast food, as well as cottage pie, which has \\"mash\\" on the top.

Me and my family went here for dinner on 4/2 had a normal wait time of about 20 minutes to get a table, then the server (who I'd like to give the good credit too!) Luis V promptly brought us our drinks, explained the menus specials to us and got our food and dessert out while being very friendly and attentive during our whole visit. The service we received here and the amazing taste of the sogno di cioccolata is the reason we stopped in again tonight. We had dinner at another steakhouse nearby and decided to call in dessert to Carrabba's and take it to go back to our hotel, called in the chocolate cake to go at 9:55. Arrived at the restaurant close to 10 minutes later and was told to take a seat in the waiting area and they would bring it to us when it was ready. 25 minutes later they finally bring the cake which had slide around the box and separated. If I was to order a meal or anything that actually had to be cooked then I could understand the wait time but for a piece of cake that was called in ahead of time and didn't even have to be cooked I found the wait ridiculous. So as for my dining in experience Monday night I would give it 5/5 stars, but with the take out experience I would say 1.5/5 because if I had known it would've taken that long I would've gotten dessert at the restaurant we dined at."},{"name":"Noodlebox","address":"1867 W 4th Avenue","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"Excellent food, fusion Asian dishes of all kinds.

This is the only reason that prevented a 5 star rating. Looking forward to try other menu items."},{"name":"Stauf's Coffee Roasters","address":"1277 Grandview Ave","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"By all rights I shouldn't be writing this review.  I worked at Stauf's and I learned more about coffee in one year than most people learn in a lifetime. It transformed me into the purist caffeine snob that sits before you today, happily clicking away at my keyboard with one hand while holding my coffee mug with the other.  I owe the bulk of how I view coffee today to this company, so you might say I was biased.\\n\\nOddly enough, you'd be wrong.\\n\\nThe truth of the matter is, it's so difficult for a business to rate five stars on all levels, but Stauf's really does come through on all of them.  How do I love thee, Stauf's?  Let me count the ways:\\n\\nFirst and foremost, product quality is top notch.  Stauf's buys only AA SHB beans whenever possible and boasts a very wide selection of single origin varietals.  If you are serious about increasing your coffee awareness, if nothing else, understand that there are tremendous differences between beans and between growing regions.  Even before I became an affected coffee drinker, it always used to bother me that 99% of coffee makers didn't bother telling you where their coffee came from.  I knew that different beans had wildly varying flavor characteristics, so wouldn't it stand to reason that we would want to know the origin of our favorite coffees?  A package that says 'Coffee - French Roast' tells me nothing.  To me that's like walking into a car dealership and having the salesperson trying to sell you a car.\\n\\"What kind of car is it?\\" you ask.\\n\\"Well, it's a blue car.\\"\\n\\"Yes, but how do I know it's not a lemon?  Is it good quality?\\"\\n\\"It has four doors.\\"\\n\\"No, I mean, who makes it?  Where did it come from??\\"\\n\\"Did I mention it's blue?\\"\\nAnd yet we seem to be okay with this, and have been duped into believing all coffee is the same.  Do yourself a favor and the next time you're going out to buy a pound of coffee, instead stop at Stauf's and buy four quarter pounds of different varietals, or maybe the same bean but in different roasts.  Even Sanka drinkers will admit that yes, there is a huge difference.  Find out what you like... before long you'll have a list of a half dozen favorites you can't live without.  Myself, I'm partial to Guatemala in a vienna roast, Costa Rica vienna, and Yemen vienna (meu deus, I could go on for hours here).  And yes, they will do custom roasts.  I won't talk about about their flavored beans because I can't imagine how someone could actually like them, but they do keep a wide variety in stock because they are, strangely enough, wildly popular.  Not unlike reality TV.\\n\\nThe retail area where you buy your coffee and hardware is maybe a bit sparse, but the staff is heavy on product knowledge and are quick to help out.  Most if not all of the staff are coffee junkies so they are quite knowledgeable on their own passion and can help you find the best gear for your needs.  You'll find that some of the hardware can be a bit pricey, but that's only because they don't stock the kind of substandard crap that you could find at WalMart for one fifth the price.  By all means, pay the $125 for that Zassenhaus hand grinder because it's the best and last grinder you'll ever need.\\n\\nThe cafe itself is one of the first things most first-timers will notice.  It's spacious, rustic, unassuming, and very casual.  The baristas are friendly and patient, but they hustle.  Lines may stretch as times but they move you through quickly.  They sell the usual coffee accompaniments along with casual lunch fare, all reasonably priced.  But it's the overall no-nonsense mood that I find attractive.  So many coffee houses try so hard to be quirky and electic and unassuming that they wind up forcing an ambiance that reeks of assumption.  The only other coffee house that could duplicate what exists at Stauf's was the Coffee Table in the Short North, which is sadly gone now.\\n\\nThe overall value was the one factor that could have held my review back to a four, because in the large scheme of things, you can pay more for their product than you are used to.  If you drink Folger's, much more.  But I feel the quality of what they sell really does measure up to the cost, so if you're comparing apples to apples and oranges to oranges, it's a reasonable value.  So indulge, for crying out loud, and discover coffee for the first time."},{"name":"Toasted","address":"1945 Aloma Ave","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4","text":"The food is so good , I wish we lived closer!"},{"name":"Northstar Caf√©","address":"4241 N High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Overall it was pretty good.

The food itself is pretty delicious as it was just pretty standard choices of beef, skewers, veggies, dumplings etc... but the broth is really what makes a hot pot go from good to excellent. The original broth was very delicious with a rich and hearty tone and enough saltiness with a slightly bitter but not overpowering after taste. The spicy broth had a present heat that didn't over power the food and the flavors but made sure you felt a small kick. Honestly, I enjoyed the broth enough that I drank a good amount even though it probably isn't too great for you. In regards to service, I like how they're pretty speedy with the food (which is good since it's just raw food) as well as their attentiveness to come back, fill the broth, ask us how our meals were, etc. It made me feel at home. I did hear service declines as there are more people both in your party and at the restaurant but it is somewhat expected as they don't seem to have to many people working there. The only thing I did find really odd was the lack of someone standing at the front to take seats right away which made me feel a tad awkward at first but I overlooked it. Another small gripe I did have was that they didn't explain how to order really but It isn't really hard to figure out. However, it may be a little unwelcoming or offputting to newcomers of hot pot. Little sheep had a great variety of food for traditional hot pot  that was of good quality. However, what takes it home for me is the flavors of the broth and how the flavors mingle with the food."},{"name":"Dante's","address":"350 W Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"awful service, AWFUL BARTENDERS!

My date ordered the Chicken and Shrimp Tortelloni-- \\"spinach and roasted garlic tortelloni with grilled chicken, sauteed shrimp, Roma tomatoes and baby spinach in a lemon scampi cream sauce\\" ($18).

I tried the Tres Leches for dessert. It was ok. I've had better. Next time the Flan for sure. Our server was attentive tho he forgot to bring my husbands decaf coffee with his dessert and brought the check before we could say anything. My husband didn't want to make an issue of it.

Well that sounded too good to be true, so, that's what we ordered.  The margaritas were a little sweet for my taste, but not bad at all.  And Javier's perfect timing meant we got all of our drinks at happy hour prices, even though we cut it pretty close.  For $3, those enchiladas were excellent, too.  We both cleaned our plates.

Anyway, I felt pressured to take the casserole since they ALREADY had made it, but was quite disappointed.

At around 9:50 pm, the server approached us and said they close at 10 pm which was not what their website says.

While I'm rating this place 4 stars, it by no means means that I think this stall is better than a standalone sushi restaurant.  It's just reliable and tasty for quick and cheap Japanese eats on-the-go.\\n\\nSushi Yuki offers over 30 different sushi rolls, most priced at $7.99 or less.  Their other entrees, most priced at $9.99 or less, include unagi don (eel over rice), jirashi don (sashimi over rice), soba noodles, udon noodle soup, yaki soba noodles, don katsu (deep-fried pork cutlet), \\"sushi box\\" (i.e. bento box), tempura, and teriyaki.  They even have takoyaki (deep-fried octopus balls).\\n\\nI've tried the udon noodle soup ($6.99) and the don katsu ($7.99).\\n\\nIn all honesty, the udon noodle soup here isn't too much different than something you can instantly make at home, though the portion size is a lot bigger and there are a lot more (fresh) ingredients such as fish cake, scallion, and seaweed.  The bowl is large and for the most part, quite satisfying.  The broth has adequate flavor and the meal is served on a tray, steaming hot.  I do wish they provided Japanese/Chinese soup spoons with this meal rather than the more shallow metal Korean soup spoons (this business is more than likely Korean-owned).  Overall, I like this dish.\\n\\nLike the udon noodle soup, the don katsu looks like a pork cutlet that had been frozen and reheated (something you could make at home), but you know what?  It still tastes good.  Each bite is delicious.  The exterior of the cutlet is delightfully crispy and the interior is tender and flavorful enough.  The cutlet itself has a lot of sweet sauce on top, which makes it taste that much better.  The don katsu comes with a side of white rice, a small salad with ginger dressing, and a bowl of lukewarm miso soup.  They could stand to provide more temperature hot miso.\\n\\nLike with all the food court stalls at H Mart, you can request small Styrofoam cups for water if you're not purchasing any beverages."},{"name":"Bahama Bay Conch Bar and Grill","address":"349 Decatur St SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Just went here the other night because I been craving conch for the longest time.

Thankfully the restaurant was not busy (at 8:00 on a Friday night!!) so we had no problem getting a table.\\n\\nService started off good enough.  Drinks came quickly and our water glasses were continuously filled.  We put in our dinner orders and were on our way...  Appetizers came out and those were...OK.  The beef carpaccio was decent, although it was slightly pinker (not red) than I've ever seen it and the dish was seriously lacking in the balsamic drizzle category.  The rest of the table's apps were also just OK and on the small side.\\n\\nThe main course arrived after we had finished our appetizers, and when they arrived everyone at the table was a little confused.  Are the portion sizes always so small??  Enough food for one person to eat and be satisfied, but nothing compared to the rest of the restaurants in the area...or any other restaurant for that matter (especially for the price).  I ordered the gnocchi dish and had no complaints about the dish (other than the size of the portion).  2 of my friends ordered the duck dish and neither were overly impressed with their meals.  \\n\\nAfter dinner we put in our dessert and coffee orders (this was during Restaurant Week, afterall).  This is when the service really went downhill.  We waited at least 20 minutes for our desserts to arrive, and when they finally came our coffee was missing.  That took another 15 minutes to come out of the kitchen.  Does it really take that long to make 3 cappuccinos and an espresso?  To top it all off, all of the cappuccinos were full of coffee grounds and the espresso was nothing more than a tiny cup of regular coffee.\\n\\nI would not eat here again.

There isn't anything magical about the ingredients (oranges, organic carrots, lemon and ginger) or the juicer, but somehow out came this amazing fresh juice.

On two occasions I had the COWBOY BREAKFAST which comes with two locally grown, organic eggs, bacon or breakfast sausage, and a buttermilk biscuit with Michigan black cherry preserves.

On another day, I had the SWEET POTATO AND TURKEY HASH, which had diced Applewood smoked turkey and sweet potatoes, red peppers, sweet onions, scallions and came topped with two sunny-side-up eggs.  It was okay.  The turkey was a bit too salty.  But I've never had sweet potato in a hash so I wanted to try it.  I would've liked to order off the non-breakfast/brunch menu, but apparently you can't until 3 pm! \\n\\nOn one visit, I stayed until 3 pm so I could order the BUDDHA BOWL for dinner.  I chose the pan-seared organic tofu, instead of roasted chicken, and it also came with long-grain organic brown rice and bright veggies.

The bowl was doused and since I'm not a fan of too much sauce I should've known better than to trust that they would use a light touch.  I guess I assumed the sauce would be separated since I was ordering it to-go. \\n\\nI still consider Northstar Cafe to be a great option in Columbus.

I haven't ever dined outside in the restaurant, and after many comfy cozy visits to the bar, I don't really find a need to. \\n\\nFirst off: the cocktails. My one major complaint about this place is that it's in Woburn and not inside my house. So I can only have so many cocktails before I safely and responsibly drive home. The bartenders are super inventive and very very good at their craft - so if you want to go off menu and ask them to make you a drink, you will not be disappointed. \\n\\nSecondly the food. Szechuan style everything. Spicy and mouth tingling deliciousness. The pork dumpling appetizer cannot be missed. There are two kinds of wings (bourbon BBQ and dry hot) you really should do yourself a favor and order both. And maybe one of my favorite things on the menu is the Chinese broccoli. It really doesn't look like anything to shake a stick at, but it's crunchy and garlicy and just plain tasty. I could eat a mountain of that stuff.\\n\\nAnd finally the service and atmosphere! Service is always impeccable. Even when it's busy, service is very friendly. You never feel rushed or pushed out the door. It's great.

One was that the tables we were sitting at were all crooked and wobbly - definitely something a restaurant as nice as Tasca should have under control. \\n\\nThe other bad thing about the night was that we came with a birthday party, and the two Birthday Boys were wearing paper birthday hats. The waitress automatically brought over an amazingly delicious Pastel Basque covered in whipped cream and a candle for each Birthday Boy. However, she then CHARGED US for these unsolicited birthday desserts. They were cheap enough, and delicious enough, that we sucked it up. However, it's just wrong to hand someone food out of nowhere and then charge them for it. (Happy Birthday, buy your own present!)

However, that was probably to be expected on a Wednesday night.\\n\\nI have to say I was pleasantly surprised by the tempeh miso burger with fried potatoes on the side, as well as the Thai burger I tried on a subsequent visit (although I didn't care too much for the beansprouts in it). I expected a bland, flavourless, grainy patty doused in a bilious sauce that was labelled 'fair-trade', 'artisanal' or something of the like to pander to the budding beatnik's delusions of social awareness. However, both burgers provided the same satisfaction as having eaten a traditional burger, but not the shitty, bloated feeling that usually accompanies it. All in all, not bad.\\n\\nThe only reason it doesn't get five stars is because service was slow. For example, it took them almost half an hour to get me a mint tea on a night where I was the only customer - the generic, teabag kind at that.

My pecan-gorgonzola salad was delicious, though next time I'm definitely forgetting my diet and going with the fried chicken strips on top.  The meager portion grilled chicken I got instead was sliced so thinly it might as well have been Boar's Head, while my companions who went with the chicken fingers on top of their salads were rewarded with three fat, almost tempura-like battered chicken fingers.  Bonus points for having a really tasty balsamic vinaigrette and only dark leafy salad greens (no iceberg or romaine here).\\n\\nWe were celebrating a birthday, so dessert was on the house, and we had our choice of a few delicious sounding options.

It does not actually have authentic Taiwanese cuisine like a similarly-named restaurant, Facing East, in Bellevue, WA.

I don't normally carry cash on me, so I was relieved that I saw the Visa/MasterCard logo on the side of the truck.  Unfortunately when I got to the window and ordered for my girlfriend and I, the cool guy at the counter said the machine wasn't working today.   But rather than being denied my lunch, the dude at the counter literally said, \\"Don't worry about it, how about an IOU?\\"    My jaw dropped that an establishment (let alone a food truck) would allow such a thing.   I was shocked, kinda embarrassed that I didn't have cash, but thankful for the opportunity to enjoy their wares.   \\n\\nAnyways, we didn't wait long until our Falafel wraps were ready and we headed back into the Hancock to sit in the AC and eat.   I thought the food was excellent - for $6 you get a massive falafel wrap, filled with whatever extras you want in there.   The quality of this place is far better than the Falafel King in downtown crossing.   Granted this has been the only thing I've eaten there, but the place is great, hands down.   I read a couple of the falafel snobs here on Yelp, but whatever, I thought it was really good.   \\n\\nAfter eating, I felt bad about the payment thing, so my full belly skipped over to an ATM.  Luckily, I was able catch the truck as they were cleaning up/closing down.   I paid them, gave them my many thanks, and eventually being able to have a conversation with the owner.  Young guy, he was making some of their lemon/lime slushy's and he just randomly gave me one as they were closing down.   We talked business for a couple minutes, differences between their Home Canton shop vs. the Truck Business.   He almost inspired me to quit my job and become a food truck man - but not.  He and his staff were all good dudes.    \\n\\nSo, in summary, I was given a delicious falafel lunch on good faith, and then got a leftover slushy when I went to repay them back.   Owner was a real cool guy and the workers were hip too.

I love updates, and mostly better than the original updates!  While the service was up to par this time, they did not hide that they read my previous review.  I could tell because we were literally the only table they walked up to and asked if everything was okay four times.  The young lady wearing the pink nikes with brunette hair was the sweetest ever and very attentive towards us. \\n     Sadly, I still did not appreciate the food. Again I split the burger and grilled cheese with someone else and I was still not impressed.  This time I tried the truffle melt, but there was basil in it and that is not mentioned in the menu. And again, the sandwich was bland.  The basil should have been pan seared in some oil before being put into the sandwich raw. Raw ingredients in a hot sandwich is not my favorite...but it may impress some. The bread is great, as always, and cooked perfectly.  \\n    I also got the truffle and rosemary fries again and this time there was a lot more rosemary than last time, and I did not appreciate that.  Fresh rosemary is such a bold tast that you literally only need a little slice or two per fry to get the whole flavor.  The deal with these fries are that you need to eat something else and then you can actually tastes the truffle.  Weird, because truffle is such an earthy and distinct taste that you would imagine it would pop in your mouth, but it really doesn't until you have something else on your pallet. They were cooked perfectly, and I truly enjoyed them.\\n     This brings me to the burger.  Again, the meat itself was fresh and juicy, but it needs to be seasoned!  Just a little peper and salt it would be more than perfect. This time I tried the triple B and it was decent.  By decent, I mean it is nothing special.  If everything else on the menu seems a little too extreme or scary to try, order this burger.  The blue cheese was good, but it should have been melted a tad.  The cheese was ut on cold and I do not believe that is a great idea. The potato chips were bland, they brought great color to the burger and a fun crunch but they need some sort of seasoning. The bacon was a little overcooked and tasted old.  The bun was great, as always...Sadly, I ordered my burger medium and it came out well done, again.  Really, the cooks back there need to memorize temps and use the thermometer.  A wonderful server tried to tell me that the meat keeps cooking under the heat lamp and at the table; that left a bad taste in my mouth.

My bagel and lox plate was delicious. It was on a large platter with lots of extra accompaniments. Very creative presentation. The service was great - very happy that the server was able to hand out separate checks. \\n\\nThen I returned last Friday night with a four other gals. We sat on the heated patio  which was pleasant and warm on cool night. Four of us started out with the Micca Caliente which we enjoyed. Spicy, refreshing cocktail. The fifth gal in our party was pregnant so the server made sure she received a virgin cocktail to enjoy. Then we ordered an array of appetizers including mussels and smoked crap dip. Though I enjoyed both apps, the crab dip was quite memorable with a great smoky flavor. Since I also filled up on the bread and butter too, I was not prepared to order a full entree. Instead I opted for the octopus and pork lettuce wrap. It is actually a small plate for sharing menu option. The wrap turned out to be a filling entree for me. Though quite tasty, it was also salty. Again, service was attentive and friendly that night. Checks were separated for us which we appreciated.\\n\\nThe wine list is quite diverse in terms of regions and price points which is refreshing. I enjoyed the Malbec but saw a number of interesting wines at reasonable prices on the menu. Afterwards we enjoyed another cocktail at the bar which was packed throughout the night. Fun spot to grab drinks.\\n\\nHope to come here again to enjoy a full entree and try some new wines."},{"name":"Musashino Sushi Dokoro","address":"2905 San Gabriel St, Ste 200","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"This is by far my favorite sushi place in Austin!!!

I have had great experiences at the location at the Inman Retail district and the location on Piedmont near Monroe. I assumed the same here. \\n\\nWhen I got there with my children, my friends were already inside waiting. We must have waited about 5-8 minutes before we had to get a server's attention. The place was full, but not packed. Also, everyone else was eating and had been served. The server told us she would let our server know we were ready. After another 5 minutes he finally came over. We ordered and were good to go. \\n\\nI decided to get the buffet and I ordered sushi rolls for my children, a 7 year old boy and 4 year old girl. Bottomless pit 1 and 2. The food was great! I was not disappointed, however, our server did not come back to check on us. I was really wanting more water. My children complained that they were still hungry, should have known better. So when the server finally came back he had our checks. I asked him to add a fried rice to my order for the little ones. My friends had to leave and so we stayed to get their rice. Which was delicious!! Probably the best I have ever had. I was a bit annoyed but chopped it up to every experience can't be the best. \\n\\nHowever, my annoyance changed to downright anger and frustration as I sat waiting for my check once we were done eating. Oh, did I mention that I still had not gotten a refill on my water. After being ready to leave for about 5 minutes, I finally got up and found my server near the front of the restaurant. I seriously considered walking out without paying. I always tip my servers and like to think that I am generous. I found it hard to leave him a tip due to the shoddy service, but I did. He just did not get a large tip. I am willing to try again, like I said earlier every experience can't be the best.

The Woodlawn neighborhood just continues to improve in my estimation.  Anyways, they had some issues with the building (new roof, etc.), but FINALLY opened last weekend...and it was totally worth the pent-up anticipation.  This means that I am nearly beside myself with glee and have been in practically every day since then!\\nFirst of all, the interior is lovely: open, spacious, well-lit...handmade tables and banquets from reclaimed wood, chalkboards, the list goes on.  The tables are technically for two, and wide enough that everybody can have their repast and play a board game or do their homework with plenty of room.  I love this.  There's even an open bakery in the back so you can witness the magic of Gretchen (the pastry chef) at work.  The coffee is Stumptown, and is well-crafted.  As for pastries, so far I've had a pumpkin-ginger cake with candied orange (or was it lemon?) peel and a blueberry cornmeal muffin: both super tasty, and I was actually sad when I ate my last bite of that cake. \\nSo far it's also been full of neighborhood cheer, which I hope continues.

What I did like about Toasted was:\\n\\nThe decorations found inside Toasted. They had a periodic table of cheese, lights that look like cheese wheels, and cheese graters used as lamp shades. \\n\\nThe food came out really fast. This is a type of place where you order at the counter and the food is brought out to you. \\n\\nThey have a Vegan friendly menu.\\n\\nWhat I didn't care so much for:\\n\\nThe table arrangements inside. It is a very small restaurant and maneuvering around the restaurant is a real pain because there is no space between tables.\\n\\nThe prices. I felt that they were pretty steep. I know cheese isn't the cheapest ingredient. However, I felt the bread could use a major improvement for the price I paid. \\n\\nThe sandwich itself. It was suppose to have three different types of cheese, truffle oil, and arugula. I might have saw two specks of arugula. I honestly could not taste it at all. I had about half of the sandwich and then just couldn't bring myself to eat anymore. My husband ordered the Mac and Cheese and it just tasted like burnt cheese. \\n\\nThe lack of knowledge or courtesy of some of the employees. When our food was brought out the employee couldn't tell us which sandwich was which. She said they looked too similar to tell. She told us what she thought, but then said that she really didn't know. She then sent another worker over to help us out. I believe this was the owner. The owner told us that the employee was in fact wrong. She told us to flip sandwiches. Shouldn't the employees know what they are serving? Yes the sandwiches looked similar, but that can't be an excuse. \\n\\nAlso, when I was getting napkins, straws, and lids there were a couple employees standing by the drink station. I overheard the conversation about what they do in the kitchen. Every other word out of their mouth was the F word.

Just the meal I needed after a nice morning run.\\n\\nPower House also has a nice selection of smoothies. Alas, I could not try one this time around. My only complaint with Power House is I wish they offered their smoothies in smaller sizes. I really wanted to order a protein smoothie with my meal. But seeing as how they only come in a 24 oz. size, I knew there was no way my stomach could take all of that, so I ordered a green tea instead. I'll have to drop by again some time soon just to try their smoothies.\\n\\nThe service is great too! Almost the second I sat down the waitress was at my table asking if I was ready to order.

But I don't doubt that it is high quality and for the right customer would be perfect.  Give me my toasty American breakfast brew any time.\\n   Today for brunch we ordered the eggs Benedict and the croque madame.  The benny was good, ever so slightly over cooked egg yolks were not an issue for me. The sausage was sort of lost- not very punchy in flavor, the biscuit under it all was good.  For me the hollandaise was well seasoned but too runny, I prefer a fluffier rendition.  Balloon whisk!\\n   The croque Madame was tasty.  To be critical we thought that again, the mornay sauce was a bit thin, and the brioche too dry, with a crunchy crust.  The fries were soggy i.e. greasy, stuck together in clumps, and about half of them were small broken pieces.  I know house-made fries are difficult as potatoes can change throughout the year, but these were sub par.\\n  All that sounds a little critical of a place that I have been to more than a few times, would return to again, and would recommend to friends and family.

The Basil di Limone is a nice, refreshing drink.\\n\\nFor appetizers, we ordered the Arancino (a fried Italian rice ball) and a crostini with roasted butternut squash, goat cheese, and espresso walnuts. Both were recommended by our waiter. Numerous reviews have complained that the portions are small. The menu is very clear - you get one rice ball and one crostini. They are the right size for two people to split for a light appetizer. We saw a lot of people ordering multiples to share as dinner. Both appetizers were very good and exhibited a trend for subtle flavors that seemed to hold for everything we ate. The Arancino has a very subtle citrus flavor that really makes interesting. Similarly, the combination of the squash and goat cheese was very nice, complimented by the texture of the walnuts. The service on the patio was attentive but not overbearing. The prices were good given that it was happy hour.\\n\\nThe hostess came and found us at 7 for our reservation. We moved inside for dinner. The restaurant is simple and clean, with a nice feel and open kitchen behind a large glass window. Monday night is 1/2 price wine by the glass night so we started with a Pinot Noir and a Sangiovese. Both were very good and were generous pours. We started with the Red and Gold beet salad. This was a very nice salad made with yogurt, arugula and fennel. It had a very light dressing that blended it all together perfectly.\\n\\nWe ordered two entrees to share - the spaghetti alla norma and the duck leg confit (the special). Again, both were very good. The spaghetti was a nice portion, again not huge, but more than enough. The duck confit was also very good.\\n\\nWe finished our meal by sharing a pumpkin panna cotta for dessert. The panna cotta was mandarin orange slides,vanilla gelato, and pumpkin seeds on top. The menu also says the dish includes salted caramel, which added a nice flavor to the wonderful panna cotta. Their drink menu features Amari. Amaro (singular of Amari) is an Italian after-dinner drink made from herbs that it is typically bitter. I'd never had one so asked our waitress for a suggestion. She suggested one that's a good beginner (don't recall the name) and another that was very 'advanced,' Braulio. I felt adventurous so went for the Braulio. She wasn't kidding when she said it was intensely pine-flavored. It literally tasted like what you'd expected pine tar to taste like! Funny thing, it was good. She said to let it sit for 10 minutes so that it warmed a bit. That really made a difference, intensifying the flavors but also making it more interesting. I really enjoyed it but you definitely will only want one!\\n\\nI need to stop now because this review is really long. I have to give props to our waitress, Allyson. She was friendly, knowledgeable and attentive. Our main dinner was $100, which was very reasonable for the salad, wine, entrees, dessert and Amaro. We will definitely return to Olive & June in the future!"},{"name":"Ah Sing Den","address":"1100 E 6th St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I went to Ah Sing Den with my boyfriend on a Friday night for dinner and drinks and we both had a great time!

You have to look at how many burger places nickel and dime you for wanting a lot of toppings on your burger. Five Guys gives you Onions, Mushrooms, tomatoes, lettuce and all the goods included in their burgers.\\n\\nI also like the simple ordering style. It's a cheeseburger or not. It's a single or double burger. Just be warned. If you are with 2-4 people. Just get one order of fries. They are very generous with their portion of fries. They fill a cup toss it in the bag, then toss more fries into the bag on top of everything. It actually kinda keeps everything warm in the bag since your order is wrapped in fries. Is it messy? Yeah it is, but it's also delicious.\\n\\nThe cajun fries are good, but can get pretty spicy. You will need some napkins!\\n\\nLastly? If you are allergic to peanuts, do not step within 5 yards of the door. Peanuts are available to be scooped up for snacking right at the front door.

Everything about this place screams South. If your in the mood for steak I dont recommend coming here because you wont find any on the menu. Overall, i give the food a 3.5, I give the prices a 3, and the service a 3. The menu is a bit confusing at first glance but once you look it over a few times you kind of understand the ordering process. This place is redbones esk, with less of a selection food wise.\\n\\nAs for the food, we ordered pork ribs, pork belly, pulled pork, pulled chicken, and brisket. All of those come with 1 cold or 1 hot side. The meat was extremely flavorful and soft. It has a very smokey flavor and is served without being smothered in sauce, something that I often prefer. We ordered biscuits as an appetizer as well, which were absolutely amazing if you are in the mood for a heart attack that night. The sweet butter that they bring with those biscuits is literally the icing to the cake. The only problem with the biscuits is that 2 will feed a family of 4, and they give you 4 total.. I was literally full before our food came out because i ate half a biscuit, and these things are massive.\\n\\nPrices are a bit steep. If your going there for the first time and want to try some of their food out, expect to pay somewhere in the upper 70's to mid 80's.

They have a whole section of the menu dedicated to different kinds of eggs Benedict... which - trust me - are all wonderful.

I ordered the shrimp salad.  The girl at the register had some trouble putting my order through the register but finally was able to do so after five minutes.  Twenty five minutes later, I had still not received my salad.  My companion who ordered a chicken teriyaki bowl with rice after me had received his order over 10 minutes prior.  I flagged down the expeditor, and asked him about my salad.  He took my receipt and the girls at the register began looking at the order screen that is hung on the wall.  He came back to let me know that someone else had ordered the same thing and probably my order was given to them.  He offered no apology or sympathy and never gave me back my receipt.  He then left. It seemed like an implausible excuse, as logically I should have then received the other person's salad, if it had been made at all.  I had noticed that while not terribly busy today, the expeditors were running around with dishes, trying to present them to tables only to take them back to the grill/sushi bar.  It seemed that a lot of mistakes were being made.  Why were the placards being handed out if they were not being used to match orders to tables?  Five minutes later, the expeditor was back at my table with the salad.  He said, \\"Sorry\\" and left.  The salad looked nothing like the salad that is advertised on the electronic menu board.  My salad was served on a glass plate, while the one in the picture is served in a big bowl.  The portion I received was a small \\"starter\\" size rather than the hearty \\"entree\\" size in the photo.  The photo depicted the salad having tomatoes and other veggies and a good amount of shrimp.  My salad was iceberg lettuce, shredded carrot, some thinly sliced cucumbers and 6 small shrimp.  It was a puny and pathetic salad, and cost $8.95.  I could basically get a better salad at McDonalds for half the price.  Feeling very upset with both the service and the switcheroo, I went in search of the manager.  As I tried to explain the situation, he also did not exhibit any sympathy or apology for the long wait, that my salad was given to someone else despite their placard ordering system, or for the fact that my salad looked nothing like what was advertised.  He offered to make me a new salad or give me my money back.  I opted for a refund.  I was truly appalled at the poor level of customer service I received from everyone here.

Ok, fine, I'll ditch Popeye's and pay the extra $10 for Sweet Cheeks. \\n\\nThe jumbo-sized biscuits were my favorite part of the meal. The Yelp reviews don't over hype them, they're mounds of crack. They're therefore addicting so watch yourself, or else you'll look down a few months later and not see your toes. I was also a huge fan of the collard greens, which had chunks of savory meat. Honestly, I didn't care for the mac & cheese, although most people love it. I prefer my mac & cheese to be covered with ooey gooey melted cheese and served piping hot. Sweet Cheeks made such a huge impression on me that I fought regular cravings until yesterday, when I finally gave in and returned.\\n\\nI got the same things, except I subbed the sides for a farm salad and the cheese broccoli casserole. Unfortunately, the chicken wasn't as good as the first time I went. It was a bit bland and didn't seem to be well-brined. Not worth the price anymore, IMO. The casserole was pretty terrible, as it was mushy and bland. However, the farm salad was spot on. I would order this alone. I can't remember the numerous ingredients, but if you like a salad with savory toasted hazelnuts, roasted brussel sprouts, barley, grapes and a light vinaigrette to pull it all together, you should try it. Plus, it's healthy!\\n\\nService was always great and portions are huge. You can split a platter between two hungry people."},{"name":"Austin Java","address":"1206 Pkwy","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Great time on a Wednesday night. Not too crowded.

The duck was also a bit dry and I would have used the sauce for some moisture but it kind of a tough decision as to whether or not to make the plunge.\\n\\nThird Course - Creme Brulee: The top made a nice satisfying crunch which I honestly wasn't expecting so that was nice. I think the custard was a tad too creamy though.\\n\\nBoyfriend's first course - Escargot Atmosphere: This was unremarkable and mediocre.\\n\\nBF's Second - Steak Frittes: This was salty as all hell (theme, anyone?) It was cooked to the correct temperature but you would have thought someone dumped a bunch of salt on the steak before serving so this was disappointing.\\n\\nBF's Third - Profiteroles: He loves dessert so I don't think anything could have spoiled the profiteroles so I will admit that their desserts are not bad.\\n\\nService - Was great, it seemed like the waitress might have been a newbie but I didn't have any complaints.\\n\\nVerdict - I...probably not."},{"name":"Centro Mexican Kitchen","address":"950 Pearl St","city":"Boulder","stars":"4","text":"I think of their breakfast burritos every single day.

I think it's so important to have a great host in a restaurant because that truly sets your mood for your experience at the restaurant, it's one of those things that can make or break your feelings on the service of a restaurant. The host during my visit put us off to a bad start. She didn't acknowledge us for, what seemed like,  a good 5 minutes despite there not being any other guests. She was communicating with different waitresses and couldn't even take a moment to be polite and say something like \\"I'll be with you in just a moment\\". We were sat at a curved both for 4-5 people which was really awkward for just the 3 people in our party. We started off with a few drinks, my friends both got their VIP martini which would have been pretty good if it were served colder, it was on the verge of not being cold at all. I just got a basic margarita which wasn't on the menu but they had a full bar and were able to make it and it was decent. \\nAll of us got a caesar salad to start with, we all enjoyed it and the dressing was good but mine was drowning in dressing and it was just too much for me to be able to finish. All of ordered the filet mignon as well. My friends ordered theirs medium and I got mine medium rare. They had us cut into the steaks when they served them and they seemed okay at the time but as we got further into the center they weren't cooked to our requested temperatures. Mine was definitely rare and theirs were medium rare. One of my friends tried to let one of the employees know that her steak was undercooked but there was a language barrier so she just gave up because she was already full anyways. The mashed potatoes were really good and thin green beans seemed to be slightly undercooked because I love crisp veggies with a crunch but these had a little bit too much crunch. \\nFor dessert, each of us ordered something different so we could share. We got the strawberry cheesecake, chocolate mousse, and the banana bread pudding. The cheesecake was good and creamy but it could have been served colder, it was more room temperature. The mousse was okay, I didn't prefer it but one of my friends really liked it. My favorite of the three was the bread pudding, it had a really nice banana flavor and was warm and moist in the middle but the outside of it was a little hard - the ice cream paired well with it. \\nOverall, the service and the food was just decent and I probably wouldn't spend the money to come here again."},{"name":"Harlow","address":"3632 SE Hawthorne Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"This is the best quick, casual restaurant in SE Portland.

All of their pasta is handmade, and you can tell. The Spaghetti Cacio e Pepe was perfect. So simple and pure, but the flavors were complex and lasting. The one other dish I have to mention was the sourdough bread. Simple. Easy. Reminiscent of the best piece of buttered bread I have ever had, but taken to another level. I have always said my last meal would be bread and butter, and now I know, it would have to be this bread and butter. The key here was the Prok Fond that was melted into the bread.

Each time, the food has been very good and the service has fluctuated from mediocre to really good.  Sadly, the really good service I received was about a year ago and I'm not sure that server is still working there.  What a shame.  \\n\\nMy most recent experience there was a few weeks ago for my birthday.  If you subscribe to their newsletter, il Nido will send you a letter for you to bring in on your next visit for a free birthday entr√©e. So, my friend and I went there for my birthday meal and I was really looking forward to it after my last visit. \\n\\nI found the servers (who I believe are also the owners) to be very indifferent towards us. The gentleman who took our order also brought our wine. At the first sip of wine, my friend commented that it seemed a little too warm, so the server suggested we place it on the windowsill at our table, as there was a bit of a cold draft there. Interestingly enough, each time the female server came to top up our wine glasses, she would remove the bottle from the windowsill (giving us a withering glare) pour the wine and then place the bottle on the table. Of course as soon as she stepped away, we would put the bottle back on the windowsill to 'cool'.  It became like a game almost and we kept laughing at how determined she seemed every time she put the bottle back on the table, glaring at us as if to say, \\"It belongs HERE\\".  Well, fine - if you want the wine bottle on the table, then you should serve it at the right temperature! Sheesh. \\n\\nLet me say that the reason I'm giving this place 3 stars is entirely due to the food - I have to ignore the service because the food is really quite tasty.  Plus, the bread they served is quite possibly the best bread I've ever been served in any restaurant, ever.  (Yes, even better than those amazing little bread rolls at P2B Bistro!) This bread was served warm and it tasted like what dreams are made of. The top of it was perfectly salty, beautifully browned and the inside was pillowy softness. I wanted to make a bed out of this bread, lay in it and try to eat my way out.  Okay, that was TMI, but that's how good this bread is. Really.\\n\\nFor starters, I had the seared scallops (beautifully presented) and my friend had the Piedina (Crostini with pesto, cambozola cheese, capicollo ham and dried figs) both appetizers were delicious, no complaints there. For the mains, my friend had the bolognese pasta and I had the osso bucco, which was divine. The only complaint with the mains, was that the parmesan cheese was powdery instead of freshly grated. Otherwise, quite enjoyable.\\n\\nSo, despite the really great food, I can only give this place 3 stars because the whole time I was there (especially considering it was my BIRTHDAY) the servers did absolutely nothing to make me feel welcome or appreciated as a guest. In fact, I don't think either one of them smiled once the whole evening. I can't say I won't return, (I'd go back for the bread alone) but Cafe il Nido is certainly not high on my list of places I WANT to eat. I like to feel, when I'm spending my hard-earned dollars, that both my presence and my money are valued, which in this case wasn't evident."},{"name":"Austin Java","address":"1206 Pkwy","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I love, love, love coming here on Monday nights when their Happy Hour special is 2 for 1 burgers!

The food's great (I have the chicken or vegetable superburritos constantly, and love their nachos). The wait's often really long, but it's not their fault, they go as quickly as they can; it's just really popular. Seating is mediocre (it's often crowded and loud, and not the loveliest place; cold in the winter, since the door's continually opening), but it's good for take-out, even if that just means taking your food into the main Garage food court area. Employees are surly, but efficient. And prices are decent, though they sometimes (they're not consistent) charge extra for all the options (guacamole, cheese) that should come included in the price.\\n\\nBut a few days ago, I decided to save a bit of money and get the small burrito. I got it with cheese and guacamole, and discovered that it cost about the same as the large one, since they charged so much extra for the options. That's bad pricing; with tax, I paid $4.53 for the small one, while the large one costs either $4.30 or $4.85 (as I said, they're not consistent). Makes no sense. So they lose a star.\\n\\nEdit: With a cooler head, I'm raising my rating from 3 to 4 stars, which it deserves given the many good experiences I've had here.

Amazing that other, higher end burger joints in the area can't even manage this. Then it gets even better, the beef patty is sitting on a dollop of their mac n' cheese and topped with really good thick slices of smoked bacon, cheddar cheese and sweet BBQ sauce. Yumm-tastic! What's not to like? I will say, the only possible downside is that I was pretty full about two-thirds of the way through but had to finish that sucker off 'cuz my taste buds wouldn't let me stop. On top of that I devoured a side of their mac n' cheese, made with Jarlsberg, Sharp Cheddar and Gruyere cheeses. The mac n' cheese was pretty ridiculous too, in that it is fried on the griddle a bit to make all the surfaces nice and crispy. Nice portion though, without being too much.\\n\\nOn top of everything the employees are super nice and friendly and made me feel truly at home.

Usually with friends when we more so want to have drinks with snacks without gorging on a huge meal.  the tapas aren't too expensive, neither is the drink menu.  The tapas I have tried so far that I can remember are the chicken croquets, the beef short ribs, and a few other things I can't remember the names of, but they were all delicious and well executed.  Service is very very good.  The last time we were there our server (Amelia I think?) was super knowledgeable,  and incredibly nice.  It was almost like catching up with an old friend you hadn't seen in years.  All in all , every time I've been here, I'm left happy and full (booze and a little food).  The sangria is delicious which means a lot coming from me....I'm not big into sweet drinks.  they serve you bread automatically with a delicious and creamy garlic herb butter that isn't over powering.  Is the best Tapas place I've ever been to?  No.  But certainly not the worst by any stretch.  It's close by, affordable and the atmosphere is nice and cozy with a rustic kitchen feel.  I must mention though, every time I have been there, there has been a group (or two) that go a little crazy with their camera's.  I'm all for capturing the moment, but in a dimly lit place and you have your crazy cannon super flash going off every three minutes, it gets really annoying.  It would be nice to see management intervene.  I'm not saying don't take pictures, but be considerate and thoughtful on the frequency of picture taking.

It's a little spendy and out of the way, but definitely worth a visit. Just be careful, though--those tiki drinks are serious business.\\n\\nI started off with the notorious Zombie, which was tall and frosty and smelled of baking spices. Not as fruity as you might expect, it was good and strong, with a good mix of rums, spices, pastis, bitters, grenadine, and citrus on crushed ice. While no one would mistake the Zombie for a low-octane tipple, its strength is not in going down super-smooth but containing a standard-issue amount of alcohol, but in tasting like an ordinary strong-ish cocktail and containing a truly gargantuan amount of rum, including the overproof stuff. It's good, but of classic rum cocktails, I'd take a well-made daiquiri over it most days. My second drink was the Coconaut. It's definitely one of the simpler drinks on the menu--lots of blackstrap rum and cream of coconut, plus some lime juice, blended up, and served on crushed ice with a flaming lime hemisphere. Strong, sweet, and delicious, the coconut in the Coconaut makes it a smooth killer.\\n\\nOver the course of the evening, my friend ordered the Fogcutter and the Jet Pilot. The Fogcutter was OK, with the sherry and gin playing well with the rum and juices, but the sochu that's in it for some reason seemed to add a note I wasn't crazy about, concealed only slightly by the OJ and lemon juice. The Jet Pilot was better, with a nice spiciness from the Falernum. Like the others, it was full of rum and citrus. Unlike the others, it was served in a huge chalice. Also, it was set ablaze tableside.\\n\\nMore than just the potent, rum-driven cocktails it's kitschy fun that make Hale Pele special. Between the flaming drinks, the tiki masks, and recorded thunder and flashing lights that mark every 15 minutes, it's a place that doesn't take itself too seriously and strives to inject a little escapism into its customers' lives. I appreciate that. And while they're clearly serious about their craft (each cocktail has an explanation, along with a potency level and flavor profile listed next to it), there's no mixology pretense here. The drinks are pricy, but you get what you pay for, considering how much effort and rum go into each one. Hale Pele isn't an everyday kind of bar, but it's a memorable experience and merits a visit, for sure."},{"name":"Olive & June","address":"3411 Glenview Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I visited Olive and June for the first time this past Friday.  I had heard a lot of great things about the restaurant so wanted to try happy hour to check it out.  Had a difficult time getting to it at first as it is located at a strange intersection.  The next time I go, I know to go a back way through the neighborhoods.  Anyway, no parking, just valet so I parked in the neighborhood streets behind the restaurant.  That can be tricky though because a lot of the spots in front of the houses are no parking zones.  Anyway, the entrance wasn't really clearly marked so I, of course, went in the wrong door by the bathrooms.  I walked in very confused, I asked a waiter how to get to the bar and he seemed annoyed with me that I had no clue where I was.  No biggie.  Anyway, the main dining area is downstairs and the bar is upstairs.  The place had a great patio (covered and heated in winter, huge plus).\\n\\nMet a girlfriend at the bar for happy hour and was greeted by a snarky bartender.  She also seemed very annoyed with me that I didn't know all the proper Italian drinks, etc.  She was condescending when describing the drinks and made sure I knew that this a common drink in Italy (like, duh you stupid chick, you didn't know that??).  Anyway, didn't appreciate her, she was a little rude.  I think she sensed she was being a brat because later in the evening she got a little better.  Still, not impressed with her.  For happy hour, the have some beer and cocktail specials, I believe they were half off.  Happy hour is until 6:30 so get there early!\\n\\nDecided we would stay for dinner so we were able to grab a table downstairs on the patio (recommend making a reservation).  My dining experience was EXCELLENT!  Our waiter was fabulous!  He explained the menu in great detail as it is set up a little different than most places.  He made a recommendation for dinner that was FABULOUS.  He totally made up for the bratty bartender!  I would definitely dine here again.  The place is a a trendy dressy casual kind of place.  Ambiance is very nice and great patio set up (1st and 2nd floor patios).  I would have given Olive and June 4 stars if it were not for the bad parking situation (they can't really help this but next time I go, I know where to park), poorly labeled front entrance (no helpful staff when entered) and snarky bartender.

They have hemp, rice and soy for milk alternatives. There are some g-free products resembling cookies, packaged and placed on the front counter. They have plenty of glutenous option in the deli case. They also have ice cream. I have been here several times now, trying to wait out the bugs that were nagging at me, but I've come to the conclusion those bugs are going to keep bugging. There are only ever two ladies there, and both have a bit of a sour attitude. It's nut just the lack of smiling, it's the complaining about customers from behind the counter (the place isn't that big...we can hear you), and the general air of how inconvenient your order is every time. For a short time, they were boasting they served a full breakfast menu. I had eaten before coming the first time, so I skipped breakfast the next time (two weeks later) and arrived, ready to eat some eggs and sausage, or something sans bread. In that short time, they quit doing breakfast. I guess I should have called ahead. As it was such a short time since they began providing breakfast, I didn't think to. On hindsight, I may not have missed out as they don't have a kitchen. Everything would be nuked. They offered to unroll a breakfast burrito and dump the contents in a bowl. I appreciate the effort, as that would work if I'm choosing to avoid gluten. They have also taken to this trend of taking away the water cups, which used to be easy for customers to access. They will give you a glass, rather than disposable cup, if you ask for water. That said, if you want water, you have to get back in line. \\nThey have plenty of seating, with enough square tables by one bay of windows to seat ten to twelve, combined, as well as soft chairs by the gas fireplace, and one circular table on the other bay of windows. If that doesn't suite your needs, there's a bar for people watching along the river-facing window bay. The bathroom is in the back, to your right. Just before you turn to head in the little hallway, there's a shelving unit of nick-knacks and small boxes for purchase on the left. Two or three outside tables are usually set up, so long as it's not cold and wet. They do provide a good-sized, metal water bowl for customers with dogs. \\nOverall, this isn't a bad coffee shop.

Oh yeah... it's filled with Mac users... so if you fit that category, you will love this one.\\n\\nLatte lovers: you will definitely appreciate this coffee shop. Their lattes are thick and creamy, rich in flavor, and it will convince you to go there more and more. Also, there are a lot of vegetarian options, lots of healthy food... I tried a vegan muffin for the first time- not as tasteless as I imagined- actually, it was pretty darn good. My favorite at Diesel is the Brie Sandwich... apples, brie, greens,  tomatoes, all pressed into a warm deliciousness? My stomach is always happy. I will warn you though; I love pesto, and their pesto is way too salty, so I would try to avoid that.\\n\\nAlthough the food isn't bad, the price seems a little more on the expensive side. It's more than $8 for a sandwich, pricey for the latte (around $4 I think?), but well worth it. Also, I'm really impressed with their Jasmine Tea... being Chinese and all (that should give you a hint). It's so frragrant and has a wonderful floral taste. It's safe to assume that all the teas there are good quality.\\n\\nAs for the staff, 99% of them are super friendly, 1% of them seem more than unhappy... cheer up, jesus.

The product has always been excellent, probably the best in it's class worldwide (I travel extensively).  Generous portions, reasonable prices, always fresh, etc.  Then why only three stars?  It is because of the deplorable service this place has had since the new ownership.  Many, many reviewers have mentioned the long lines and servers with \\"attitude\\".  It's very, very true and it's a shame.  Truthfully, the long lines would not exist if it weren't for the lackluster workers and thus the service.  My last visit prompted this review.  I and a stranger in line before me were amazed as we watched two servers engage in an animated discussion about a personal matter.  At one point, they put down the bagels and bags they were working on and continued their conversation without the distraction of their work for at least 5 to 10 minutes.  This is a regular occurrence here.  It's one thing to enjoy conversation with coworkers while being productive but this place is the opposite, personal priorities take precedent.  We both made the same comment almost simultaneously, \\"How can ownership tolerate this?\\"  The Danvers location is pretty much the same.  This time I and my new friend walked out.  Not the first time and certainly not the last.  Best advice, only go there between 9 and 11 am, or after 2 pm, you will have a long but tolerable wait at those times otherwise it's a nightmare.  You can order ahead, but during busy times they do not answer the phone (purely attitude).

It has cheddar, bacon, BBQ sauce AND mac & cheese. Sounds amazing! But he ordered his burger medium and instead got a very well done patty and hard to imagine, it was the most bland burger we've tasted. How is that even possible?? The ingredients are killer but yeah, no real flavor. Super disappointing. \\n\\nI ordered the Gouda As It Gets and I felt it was dramatically better than what he ordered but again, the meat was just blah. I could've gone without any meat as it added nothing to the sandwich. It was super cheesy so that's the saving grace for that sandwich. \\n\\nIt's not all bad. The truffle fries are pretty dang fantastic. And at a modest $2.50, if (and I do mean IF) we come back, it'll be for the fries only.\\n\\nThe only other thing I felt could improve the experience is if they offered some sort of wet nap.

This little restaurant is away from the beaten path of other North End Italian restaurants. I had walked by it many times, but had never been inside. The single table in the window always intrigued me and if I ran that restaurant I would make it a functioning table. \\n\\nAs we arrived on a Friday night, the place wasn't packed, it really wasn't very busy, there were lots of empty tables. But the greeter was very welcoming and friendly (huge plus in my book, first impressions are SO important) and he sat Girly and I in a nice padded booth. There was a little candle holder on the table, but the candle had burned out already and no-one offered to change it. Looking around the room, all the candles were burned out. It's just a little thing, but it was important to Girly and I on our date night.\\n\\nThe server was one of those people that has obviously been in the business for a long time, but maybe too long. He was ok,  but not great.  He seemed to be over it. For example, I asked him what beers he had and he said, \\"um, er, Harpoon, Peroni, Sam Adams, I think\\" You think? Is it really that difficult to remember three beers? And I find it hard to believe that any establishment has only three beers. I ordered a Peroni and when I was ready for a second he told me that he was out, but gave me a Bud Light for free. So credit for the free beer part, but an Italian restaurant runs out of Italian beer on Friday night? And where did the Bud Light appear from? He did not offer any specials or additions to the menu. \\n\\nWe ordered the fagottini funghi as an appetizer, it was a puff pastry dome filled with fontina cheese and mushrooms. It was served with a marsala mushroom sauce and it was delightful. The pastry was light and flaky, the mushrooms and cheese were in perfect combination.\\n\\nFor entrees I ordered the Veal Scallopini and Girly got the shrimp fettuccine Alfredo. The fettuccine was a little bland, and Girly, who never salts anything, had to salt it. The Scallopini however was delightful, so tender!\\n\\nPrice-wise, a little expensive, but on-par with the North End.

It was cozy and romantic with a beautiful decor. The service was great and the wine/cocktail selection was very good. The Dessert, Tres Leches Cheesecake was by far one of the better one's I have had and I have had quite a few being one of my favorite desserts. Great job nailing that one.\\n\\nThe Dinner on the other hand was a different story for me, everything was laden with butter and cream which masked and took away from the real flavor of the ingredients. For example, a couple tapas style dishes had some drippings and sauces that should ideally be served with a dry crusty bread to mop up the flavors from it. We had to ask for some bread on the side that came as two sad looking sourdough pieces for fried bread and a giant dollop of butter, totally lacked appeal and finesse you expect from a fine meal. It was still dripping oil from the deep frying so no chance of soaking up any flavor. \\n\\nI would give it 3 stars at the most as my overall rating.

They have a macaroni and cheese (you will never catch me saying, \\"mac-n-cheese\\" btw...watch, I dare you...) there that for my kids, was too pungent. For me? I could have eaten the whole plate, but I know why they didn't. I think it was bleu or Gorgonzola in it. Now, they do have excellent taste buds, but this was too strong and for my Sensory kid - too cheesy, lol so take that into consideration for your adult taste buds, all. And your Littles! What they would up getting, and loving, more than once, was the grilled chicken breast. It came with a fruit cup, but all - this was not some sad, sorry, pitiful dehydrated and anemic cantaloupe crapola. It was fresh, delectable strawberries, blueberries (no squishy ones, at ALL) and whatever else they had that was fresh and yummy in the kitchen. Fresh pineapple, too! Here's the Kid's Menu: http://graysatthepark.com/toolkit/dynMenu/pdfs/FN_09212011125001906488.pdf See?! Yeah! \\n\\nOK, so I had the Baby Leaf Spinach and I added salmon to it...good Lord, that was good. I also had, two times (!) the cheese platter. My daughter, almost 7, LOVED it and ate most of it, so we had to get it again the next day. A few types of nice cheeses, crackers, fruit. Really good! http://graysatthepark.com/toolkit/dynMenu/pdfs/FN_05242012191150408078.pdf If you want to check it out directly. \\n\\nSo the bar...http://graysatthepark.com/toolkit/dynMenu/pdfs/FN_05242012152333879065.pdf Terminal Gravity is the beer I leaned on. It was GREAT! I also was able to sample from Mr. Accent man (I wish I knew their names, i feel like an ass, lol) of the Mack & Jack, which was also really good. Two new beers for me! But my go-to, as many of you loyal followers know...champagne...They made the. Best. Champagne cocktail. It was as good as mine! As in, it was made correctly *and* I did not have to tell them what it was.  \\n\\nI loved how they knew me...and I'm adding this in a different paragraph because this is a Karen Moment.

I do... now they have even more \\"living rooms\\" I can stretch out in. I like to sit in the different rooms. Check em out, see which ones I could see myself living in. Sometimes when my friends and I are bored, we come here... we're all at that age where we need furniture... there also comes a point in the night where we all need food... and sometimes, we also need to take that food home. \\n\\nI don't see IKEA as a place I am going to get furniture for life. They aren't pieces I am going to hand down to a grand baby or anything. I get that and I respect that. That is also probably why these things are super cheap, not sweat shop cheap, but cheap. I bought a dresser for $150 last year (I think it's cheaper now, shake my fist at you). My husband bought the same one three years prior. His drawers sag... ahahaaa... (his drawers sag)... It still works, but I hear the base of the drawer rubbing on the front of the other drawer as I pull it out. Mine has not suffered the same fate, but who knows. We also bought a couch there. My side has sagged a bit, but the other has not. It's the most comfortable couch I've ever sat on though. I nap frequently on it while watching cooking shows or trash tv. My husband bought a bunch of wooden chairs pre-Jasmine and they are still in good condition. Depends on what you buy... not everything is disposable crap. \\n\\nI love buying the little knick knack things. I've bought bowls for cheap- glass bowls that I can make a salad in and not care if I get back. I've bought cookie cutters... I have a wok I use (mainly for taco meat...

I use them as candle holders too sometimes... that is probably wrong, but sometimes when you're camping, you need to put the votive in a taller glass so the wind doesn't get it.

Immediately we realized that we were never given our \\"choice of 2 pasta sides\\".  The pasta portion was generous so I was not about to drive back there.  Next, we noticed the containers were not labeled so we had to 'explore' each dish to determine the contents.  A simple label on each container would solve this problem.\\n\\nThe food was very average.  Breaded chicken, veal, and eggplant patties that were fried and smothered with sauce and cheese to mask their cafeteria appearance.

We were literally the only people there when we entered and the place remained empty throughout our entire dining experience. The waitress served us some complimentary olives and some cold bread with butter. Olives were ok, but it would have made a difference if the bread was fresh and warm like certain restaurants we've been to. I ordered the paella marinheiro (Baby shrimp and clam rice topped with lobster, shrimp, clams, scallops, chicken and lingui√ßa) but asked them to hold off on the chicken. When they brought it out, I noticed what appeared to look like chicken chunks spread out throughout the entire dish.  We asked if it was chicken, but it turned out to be a bunch of pork loins per the waitress's clarification. The entire seafood dish smelled and tasted mostly like pork- and nowhere on the menu did it mention adding those pork loins . A few of the  clams were undercooked and inedible. My husband ate his steak and eggs but wasn't too impressed. Turns out it is under new owners and management.

When I got to the chicken, the pieces were the size of large italian meatballs, and not the typical bite-size pieces you normally associate with General's Chicken.  And while I could see the cooked hot peppers in the sauce, there was virtually no hot spice in the dish.  I even ate one of the hot chili peppers, which is usually a dangerous proposition.  But instead of heat, I tasted something else, something unusual.

Again to be fair, whoever was in charge took the food of our bill and brought over a dessert, which was not all that great either. They did try to do everything they could to make it right, but there is not much that can be done about bad food at what is supposed to be an upscale restaurant. \\n\\nI hope this was an off night, based on other reviews, it very well may have been.

They moved to the new location, not 1539 Broadway. Just an FYI.   We decided to give them a try since the move, and we thought we waited plenty before we visited.  Well, we were told when we called very far in advance, that they do not take reservations on Saturdays between 4pm-9pm.  And we were told over the phone that they get so busy so there is no telling how long the wait  will be.  I was then told to call ahead when we were leaving and they could give us an idea of the wait.  Nope.  it didn't happen. we were told 45min wait, and we could sit at the bar until our name was called.   Ok, us and another couple, we walked in and put our name with the hostess, there was more than one, just saying.  to the right is the open kitchen and for some reason there are a few seats along the front window while you wait, which makes it overcrowded.  Then there is a DJ, with very loud disco tunes directly across from the open kitchen which seemed un necessary, so we managed to snag 2 seats at the bar, which has what looks as a dance floor with tables on it. for some reason they remained empty for a while, because not enough waitresses and the kitchen cannot keep up with the orders. We saw 4 empty seats at the kitchen counter that were vacant for so long and I asked the waitress if we could sit there instead of waiting for a table,  We got there at 6pm-It was now 715pm. I was told no, there were other people still waiting that came in before me, and I believe that was not true, because I saw a couple walk in and went directly to the seats and had dinner.  Not cool.   By this time it was 8pm!  and everytime we checked in we were told another 10 min, another 20 min,  meanwhile, the tables (of 4 and 6) on the dance floor remained empty.   I saw people leaving that were seated because they were waiting over 45min for their meal,  So finally at 820pm, there were 2 other seats that opened up at the bar, so myself, my partner and our other 2 friends decided to just sit there and eat at the bar. Not too ideally, because the dj was so loud.   The food took forever to get to us and then it was not like from the previous place, that's because Carl the original chef, had left, and now his son took over, but watching him, he seemed so flustered.  and that is their only kitchen, and he looked so overwhelmed. my dish, lobster ravioli, with shrimp (2 small shrimp and 4 ravioli) was lukewarm because it was sitting there waiting to be picked up.  it was a rip off, really, everyone's dish was not hot, and the antipasto was just ok.   There is another side, with bar and a few tables. but that looked so small, too.    So this was the most disappointing of a long awaited visit.  I miss the old location and its original chef.  Nothing is Victors about this place. also, they should decide whether they want to keep it a disco,  or an eating establishment.

I might just be harder to please because I'm from Memphis, TN, but Sweet Cheeks was a huge disappointment.  \\n\\nTHE ATMOSPHERE:\\nThe place itself is casual and truly southern, so in a way I guess I can't complain.  But am I crazy to expect something classier in a restaurant where one can easily spend $30 on a meal?  I sat at a picnic table.  PICNIC. TABLE.\\n\\nTHE FOOD:\\nI ordered the pulled chicken tray with the mac & cheese and the potato salad.  The pulled chicken was moist, but flavorless.  The mac & cheese was standard.  Nothing mind-blowing, really.  Also, had I known the potato salad came with bacon on it, I wouldn't have ordered it at all because I don't eat pork.  But when I explained this to the waiter, he happily brought me another order of the potato salad, sans the bacon.  My only regret would be that I had not tried the biscuits, because I heard such great things about them.  But 10 dollars for only 4 biscuits?  Pass.   \\n\\nMy friend ordered the ribs and mac & cheese.  He said the ribs were dry and flavorless (and overpriced!) and agreed that the mac & cheese was just average.\\n\\nI will say their sweet tea was really good: sweet, but not artificially sweet.  I'd go back there just for it.  \\n\\nTHE SERVICE:\\nThe waiter was genuinely nice to us the whole evening, which made it even more surprising to me when he charged me for the replacement potato salad I ordered.  I'm not sure if I should blame the service or the menu, because it doesn't say anywhere on the menu that the potato salad comes covered with bacon.  But that doesn't make up for the fact that I was charged for both potato salads when I only ate one.  \\n\\nOVERALL:\\nAfter leaving, me and my friends felt sick.  Sweet Cheeks brands itself as a southern barbecue establishment, but it is honestly the worst barbecue I've ever had.  I might just be a harsh critic, but I can guarantee anyone from the south would agree with me.  It's the equivalent of PF Changs calling itself authentic chinese food.  \\n\\nMore importantly, aside from having lackluster food, I would say Sweet Cheek's biggest problem is its price.  It promises amazing food, which makes it seem worth paying $30.  So anything less than amazing is just unacceptable.

So we called today to place another order and use the credit. Unfortunately, the restaurant had no record of the credit that they had extended, no memory of having a conversation about it, and no record of any previous orders or deliveries to our company (which is impossible since we've placed at least a half dozen orders within the past few months).

There were empty seats at the bar on either side of us - and three bartenders behind the bar.  We looked at menus. Chatted. Waited. Chatted. Tried to catch the eye of one of the bartenders.  Listened to one of the bartenders chatting with what appeared to be a couple of pals to the right of us. Listened to what seemed to be a tasting of some sort to the left. Waited. Finally my friend waved her arms in the air like flagging down a ship and the woman bartender looked up and came over. My friend asked for sparkling water and I asked for a Sazerac.  She looked perplexed and asked another bartender who also looked a bit perplexed, suggested an Old Fashioned - which I also like - so agreed.  Told him we were going to order dinner and asked him to leave the wine list because I'd have wine with dinner.  \\n\\nWe looked at the menu. And waited. And tried to catch someones attention.

He takes our order - we were sharing a few apps and an entree - and back to the friends he goes.  The food comes.  We ask for set ups. We need more of something - the bartender is at the register ringing up something and I say \\"excuse me\\" - he doesn't look up, doesn't acknowledge me - I say, \\"Can we get more sauce?\\" he doesn't look up - but nods.  Someone brings more sauce.  My friend asks if I wanted that glass of wine - I say \\"what's the point?\\"  We ask a passing busser for water.\\n\\nWe finish. Our plates sit.  All three bartenders are still on.  Still chatting.  Bar and restaurant still not busy.  We catch one of them and ask them to take our plates away.  He doesn't ask if we want desert ... coffee... my glass had sat empty but for an ice puddle before me - nothing.  He starts to walk away and my friend says \\"Excuse me, we'd like to order coffee\\". Coffee comes.  No refill is ever offered - empty water glasses - we shake our heads in dismay while waiting, once again, to catch someones eye to get a check. One bartender appears to be doing closing side work, the other two are still chatting away - and for a third time, my friend waves her arms in the air to get someones attention.  We ask for the bill - he says - \\"How was everything?\\" And my friend says ... exasperated ... \\"Seriously?\\" and she begins to tell him of our evening... he looks horrified.  A manager walks up and says,\\"By your body language it looks like something's wrong\\" where had he been all evening? And we tell him the same story.  Same horrified look on his face.  Waving down any server once is extreme - borders on funny . . . but three times? The bartender - who might be the bar manager?  Says ...\\"You're right.  We ignored you all night. No excuse.  I'm so sorry\\".  I asked him why.  Really - why?  Was it because we were 2 women and you thought we wouldn't care?  Or wouldn't be a big ticket?  What was it?  He literally said he had no excuse - and was really sorry. The manager comped our meal gave us his card and said he hoped we'd come back and they'd take good care of us. But why would we want to go back?  It's nice that they'd take care of us if we came back - Of course they'll do better next time - they'll know it's us.  Shouldn't they have just done it right the first time?\\n\\nI'm so surprised that the same company that runs the wonderful Ecco and SCK - runs Lure.  They're just not up to the same standard.

This place exceeded any and ALL expectations.

It was absolute insanity......yeah.  I can't say that I've ever tried heroin, but from what I've heard the sensation seems VERY similar to how I felt while eating a meal that can only be described as a really intense aphrodisiac. Shit, maybe they use an altered form of MDMA that hits you the moment it touches your pallet, but regardless of this mind-boggling mystery, I haven't been this in touch with my emotions in a looooooooooooong time and as usual, I caused a scene (Think \\"When Harry Met Sally,\\" haha). Not a shocker......I'm very expressive.\\n\\nOur appetizer: Ankimo Kobachi Foie Gras of the sea (aka Monkfish liver) \\nAfter the first bite, I'm pretty damn sure I saw Jesus (yet another reason why I think it's laced) and the lady to my right was simultaneously blessed with my notoriously inappropriate \\"Ooooo's and Ahhhh's\\" and that's putting it nicely, hahaha.\\nWhat followed:  Unagi is pretty much the best thing that has ever happened to my face and the Ozzi II roll incorporates it wonderfully  Then, we ordered a sashimi sampler and the salmon and spicy tuna were out.....of.....control!! I have NEVER had fish this fresh EVER in my ENTIRE life. It literally melted in my mouth and the flavor was just......UUUHHHH, SON!!!! \\n-cue the body quivers-\\nPlus, the presentation is something else to discuss in itself. I can't say that I've seen rolls this glorious before and the way it's all set up.....it's awe-inspiring. I love seeing food as art before consumption.

Passable but I didn't really eat much of it. \\nTheir homemade red and green sauces are tasty however. \\nMy food came fairly quickly. Fish tacos came with lime and radish on the side. Nicely grilled fish was well seasoned. Cream sauce on it was OK but closely resembeled chipotle BBQ mixed with ranch. Hell, maybe that's what it was. \\nCarnitas crispy taco came with cheese, lettuce, tomato, and sour cream. It was alright aside from the SUPER salty carnitas. I would not eat it again. It was a bit greasy too. \\nAll in all good meal though. \\n\\nStaff was friendly and my bill was under $10.

I hate to bet against a place but I'm not sure this place can make it through the off season more than once or twice. If you're a local it feels like a spring break cross between the Witch's Brew and Pig's Eye run by high school kids in cargo shorts. The outdoor hostess station needs to go back to the trash pile in the point where it came from. The high school hostess pair seemed not to notice us walk up... there should be only one hostess and that station should be at the enterance to the outdoor dining area not hidden 40 feet away. Next there is this confused ice cream window concept by the serving station thats more like unmanned storage. Random customers will stand waiting for ice cream and someone to notice them, some give up and go away others observe the dish boy slathered in dish goo entering and exiting the dining area to retrieve dishes from the serving station. Meanwhile the ad hoc server station is rolling around and servers are reaching over and under to find utensils. Here is some good advice dump the ice cream concept and convert that area into a proper server station so people at the window booths don't need to watch dishes being cleared. I watched the owner/GM talk to a couple through 1/2 their meal about the menu... he wasn't that interesting and he didn't take the hint from the couple. Also, people seem to be allowed to smoke at the outside tables and the smoke makes its way inside, management should get on this as I think its against the law. The food is ok. The salads had old greens like they came from a bag and someone didn't look through for the gooey ones. The steak tips were good but slathered in BBQ... send that on the side. The buffalo fingers are from a bag so no props there, fries are great and prices are great. The beer/wine selection is for the Bud Light crowd. Make some smart choices around your organization, clean up the service and you'll make a ton of money.

Beer and liquor selection are adequate and the house margarita is solid. Restaurant is clean and food comes out pretty quick. \\n\\nCons : Service is inconsistent. With some people bringing chips/salsa, others bringing the food and the server filling out everything else, there's many times you sit forever waiting on something because the communication isn't there.  Certain food items are really overpriced for what they serve. The skirt steak tops the list. It's around $18 and you get one, really thin and really small piece of meat.  If you want to add a side of guacamole to your dinner, it's $4-$5 and you get a really small scoop.\\n\\nFor a couple, you can expect to spend $60-$70 for 2 dinners and a drink or two each.

Equally of interest to me is besides standard soda and shakes you can get (craft) beer, wine, and Mexican soda (i.e., with real sugar instead of HFCS). \\n\\nThe burgers are pretty good. I find the beefy taste not quite as strong as Uburger, but I feel the choice of toppings compliments the burgers, including the fried egg option. Be aware that when you order a cheeseburger, or even a build-your-own, they start by assuming you want American cheese; be sure to specify if you want other.\\n\\nThe regular fries come in a portion large enough for 2 people. They were for me slightly too well cooked, slightly too greasy, and too salty. I wonder if they maybe stayed in the deep fryer slightly too long.

For our entrees we ordered the 12oz filet and the eggplant. Seemed like we waited forever but they finally arrived and were a mixed bag. The eggplant was lacking and seemed to be under a heatlamp for quite some time. The filet was ok nothing special. Best part was the mashed and veggies. We felt with a bottle of sriracha or similiar the meals would have better. Service was very slow but we can throw the guy serving us a bone due to the fact he had a table of elderly Russians asking/demanding for everything. Did have a bar area. Very small and dimly lit.

To her, there is nothing like an artisan-ally made vanilla latte. Personally, you could give me Speedway coffee and I wouldn't know the difference, but there's something calming and aesthetically pleasing about stopping into a cozy coffee bar that takes pride in what they're roasting.\\n\\nI've been meaning to stop by Stauf but every time I've been in the Grandview Heights area I've been on a time crunch. I had a little extra time today and finally was able to give it a shot. When you walk in, you find yourself at the beginning of a two room cafe. The first room has all their in-house roasts; you can buy many coffee related items and freshly roasted beans to go. There are a few tables to hang out as well. More than likely, you came to get a cup of coffee, so you'll want to hang a left toward the chalkboard and baked goods section. You'll find many more tables, all of which are filled with young professionals and students trying to get shit done. They have a large and impressive food menu, along with a scrumptious looking baked goods display. My friend and I were simply there for a cup of coffee and we ordered some. There was a line of people waiting but I assume that they came in a bunch because the baristas got the orders out fast. We both ordered an iced vanilla latte. By the time I ordered and used the restroom, the drove of people were gone and there were four new orders ready in addition to mine. Since this was a drive-by coffee run, we took our drinks and left.\\n\\nAs I mentioned before, there's nothing as important to Laura as a good vanilla latte. To this day, she randomly mentions that she misses Cafe Umbria in Chicago. (It's been nearly a year since our initial visit there.) When I tell her about a coffee shop I enjoy, she makes every effort to go there. Therefore, there are always high expectations for lattes in her book. Stauf delivered for us both. The latte was creamier and sweeter than what I was expecting, but I really enjoyed it. I sort of regretted not getting a large. Hell, she finished her coffee before I could even get back on the highway. It was a very well made latte and I would order it again.\\n\\nI want to come back to Stauf and try their food menu. Every time I've passed it they've been packed, and that chalkboard menu has a lot of interesting breakfast and lunch options. I will definitely make another pit stop here soon!"},{"name":"Hale Pele","address":"2733 NE Broadway","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Tiki done right.

For $28, I wasn't expecting fire works and a puppy, but I didn't expect just two plain bland pieces of fish fried covered bread crumbs. The spinach was okay. Not as flavorful as I expected.

The Cajun seasonings did not get a chance to permeate the flesh of the seafood, unfortunately. The shrimp was large and juicy though, but the crawfish was frozen. You know this immediately when you suck the heads and instead of a sweet, buttery taste you get a slightly bitter flavor. Overall the dish lacked sweetness, saltiness, spice/heat, butter, and garlic.\\n \\nIt was even more ironic that in addition to the bland seafood, we got extremely salty garlic noodles. If anyone has lived in SF and eaten at PPQ or Thanh Long, you know what good garlic noodles taste like. Even I make a really good copycat at home. The garlic noodles here were waaayyyy too salty. They were also overcooked and mushy. I'm wondering if it's because we ate there at 10pm that we got the noodles that have been hanging out at the bottom of the pot all day.\\n\\nMaybe it was an off night and we got the bad batches?

The bbq sauce (which they put on the side) was very good.

My pork ribs were tasty, meaty and lean. The sides were ok but I suspect that the novelty cole slaw and cheese broccoli were the wrong choices.

Sides are a little bland, as is the \\"disnt this used to be Cambridge 1? \\" decor. Service was decent but water refills would have been nice. Good drinks but douchy hipster plates and canning jar glasses were a little much. The biscuits alone were worth 4 stars alone.\\"\\n\\n--\\n\\n\\"Sweet Cheeks was a delight. Between the excellent biscuits and the perfect tender meats, I'd come back here any day!  Unfortunately, the sides left a bit to be desired....   The collard greens were uninspired and the carrot salad was very one note. Servicewise, I'm still trying to figure out where my drink order is.....   The decor was nice, but completely an afterthought.  Also, I'm really longing for the days when you'd go to a restaurant and food was served on plates.  The tray/mason jar/tin can dinnerware rang very inauthentic.  I mean, come on Tiffany, this is Fenway, not rural Appalachia.  Despite this, if return solely for the quality of the meats. And those f'n awesome biscuits.\\"\\n\\n--\\n\\n\\"The pulled chicken was excellent.  Moist and perfectly cooked.  The biscuits were incredible.  Ribs were just ok.  Sweet tea wasn't really well mixed.  At first I didn't think it was sweet.  When I got to the bottom it was all sugar.  I never have that problem down South.  Acoustics in the restaurant weren't great.  The music needed to be dialed down about 20%.  I could only hold a conversation with the person next to me or across from me which was disappointing.  Didn't love the shared tables either as I had a little kid next to me (which didn't help with the noise!).  Waitress overall did a very good job although she was oblivious to the fact that her voice did not carry to such a large group in that loud a setting.  But everything was brought out efficiently and correctly and that is saying a lot for a large group.  I concur that the water should have been refreshed without asking.\\"\\n\\n--\\n\\n\\"I always ask, \\"Would I come back here? and the answer is definitely \\"yes!\\" You get bulk and bang (drinks) for the buck that just tastes good.

The breakfast buffet is a good size. They have a mix of cheeses, meats, breads, pastries, waffles, yogurt, fruit, eggs, etc. There was definitely something for everyone. I wouldnt say it was the best Ive ever had but it was ok. The eggs were a little too heavy in butter and had been sitting out a while because they had a film on them. They only had about 2 options for fruit. The cheese had either sat out for a while or was old because the edges of each piece were rock hard.\\n\\nIf you have a gluten allergy they do have gluten free bread with a toaster dedicated to just gluten free bread (they even have a sign on it). In the area with pastries is jelly and butter but be careful. You run the risk of cross contamination because people use the knife to put jelly directly on their bread/pastry rather than on their plate so particles transfer into the jar after use. You might want to ask a server to open a new jar or get you sliced butter from a new stick. \\n\\nService is decent. Our server was very kind.

Let me set the stage for you.  It was my anniversary. My hubby and I arrived before they opened, about 10 minutes before the started seating.  The hostesses were rude and we overheard someone saying not to let anyone inside until 5:30 pm. So, we sat down and waited.  We were the very first people there and where do we get seated?  Right in the corner near the door that leads to the outside patio seating area.  The temperature in Austin has been climbing and we kept getting a blast of very hot, humid air every few minutes.  Yes, we complained.  Who wants to eat raw fish when it's sweltering... if we did, we would have asked for outside seating, but our server was too busy catering to a table with 6 people  (3 of them young kids) to notice us trying to flag her down.  So, we tracked down the person who sat us and asked to be moved.  She came back and said they couldn't find a different table, but would have the staff use a different door...there was no difference.  It took 45 minutes after we ordered our sashimi moriawase plate to get our food and the place filled up.  So, we had our sake and tried to order more food at ok ne point, but again, the server wouldn't even make eye contact.  When she showed up we ordered more food and that's when the door opening, hot air blasts got worse. We finally had it and the manager finally came over when our food arrived.  The tab would have been over $300 without tip.  We had the additional food sent back and told the manager our grievences.  We paid our bill and left.

The inside had cute decor- periodic table of cheese? Genius! Another focal point I enjoyed was the 3D Cheese wall. It mimicked Swiss Cheese with all the holes. I myself if a HUGE cheese lover, so this place seemed right up my alley.\\nI went in on Sunday morning, so I decided to turn my grilled cheese into a breakfast sandwich. At Toasted, you can add bacon or a fried egg to any sandwich. I added both. Another aspect I appreciated about this restaurant, is that they serve their sandwiches on locally sourced artisan breads and try to outsource local, fresh ingredients whenever possible. I decided to try one of their Signature Items- the Truffle Melt. I must say there were so many appetizing sandwiches, it was difficult to choose! The Truffle Melt has Havarti Cheese, Truffle Oil, Arugula, and  Fresh Ground Pepper. The sandwich itself was pleasing, the only gripe I would have, was that it was a little lacking in flavor. Very good, but I feel some spices or herbs could have enhanced it. Maybe a little more of that Fresh Ground Pepper was in order. Overall, this did not discourage me from wanting to try other items at Toasted. There is a Fig and Goat Sandwich that sounds intriguing -being that I absolutely adore goat cheese. Also, I grew up on Grilled Cheese and Tomato Soup. I found out after visiting Toasted, that they offer their Tomato Soup in a \\"dipper size\\" for your sandwich, so you don't have to purchase a large cup. I'm very interested in going back and exploring some other items on their menu. \\nIf you're into Grilled Cheese, I recommend checking out Toasted.

For the main course we shared the roast chicken and the salmon. Neither dish was amazing nor did they seem Italian in taste.

I can't tell you how many families I've seen tour this location that require special modifications to their pizza ( no chunks in the tomato sauce for picky children, slices cut smaller for convenience, gluten free for those who can't visit other restaurants) and the staff here complied willingly. I've never seen anyone turned down without reason. The environment is most definitely family friendly,  not a bar like atmosphere although they still offer multiple large screen TVs (usually with the games showing) and a good variety of beer/wine if you wish to indulge with your slice of Za. \\n\\nFor my lazy long days after work, Upper Crust does offer FREE delivery which is particularly rare within the confines of Boston.

That said, it is still no match for a real burger.  I'm not stating this out of carnivore pride or disdain for herbivores, I simply believe it to be true (and my wife agreed with my opinion).  The taste of the burger was great, but the bean patty falls apart easily (it quickly squishes out as you hold it like a real burger).  You have to resort to eating it with a fork and knife or you will look like a savage (albeit it non-carnivorous savage) by continuing consumption with your hands.\\n\\nThe biggest appeal of Northstar Cafe is how fresh their food tastes.

The idea was to make everything from living facilities such as condos and apartments, to restaurants and shopping areas more posh and modern. As a result, places like Brix Eurobistro have become a staple for those who live, work and frequent in the Downtown area.\\n\\nFrom what I can tell this restaurant is meant to be modern chic with a very posh feel to it. Both fondue and American cuisine are featured on their menu in addition to a quite vast wine list. As is usual for most downtown hot spots, they have pretty good food and drink specials throughout the week and especially on Friday nights. Their food, in my opinion is average in taste and presentation and bit too overdone as far selection goes. \\n\\nTheir cheese fondue is okay. The burner either wasn't hot enough to keep the cheese melted or wasn't working properly because the cheese got really thick and gooey verses smooth and creamy very fast. Bread, apples and some other items came as dippers, but the bread just wasn't sturdy enough to hold the thickened cheese and I'm not a fan of apples and melted cheese...personal preference I guess. As for the rest of the food, the sandwiches are all I've tried and, again, not the best I've had, but not the worst either. Both times that I've been here I felt somewhat overwhelmed by the menu and confused at the same. I think that they should stick to one type of cuisine, either fondue or American, and work on perfecting that verses trying to conquer so many different things. \\n\\nService here isn't bad. The waiters I had each time were good about refilling drinks and catering to everyone's needs as best as they could. Prices aren't too bad if you are lucky enough to catch a special, but can get pricey if you're not careful. As far as wine goes, I was able to find a few that I liked and was also pleased with their selection of other drinks as well. The bartenders seemed good about making a drink if they didn't feature it on their drink menu. \\n\\nOverall, not my favorite place to go to downtown, but I'd pop in again if a friend suggests it."},{"name":"Emmer & Rye","address":"51 Rainey St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Austin!

All the games (for those kind of fans) seemed to be on on the many tvs. It really is a great 5-12 kind of place...and I mean to stay there the WHOLE time.\\n\\n  What I mean by ''stay there the whole time'' is that despite the fact that they are plenty in staff, when we went it was NOT that terribly busy for a Monday night. Our waitress never once came by to fill waters and really only came by periodically. \\n\\n  We were there to take a wing challenge and sure we didn't mind them so much getting on the PA to announce it and get the crowd worked up, but my husband is a bit of an Introvert and it rather wrecked his nerves to have people fussing over him at the table about the challenge. First time he has ever expected that. And really, he is okay but I can't say I was too pleased about it. He understands though. And we don't hold that against them (but consider this a heads up for those that DO want to consider that and take the challenge. 12 large HOTTEST wings in 6 minutes.)\\n\\n  The biggest thing here is we had friends in our party that have been and every single time has experienced this inattentive service of the staff.  This is what really drags down my opinion, as it contributes very much to the fact that I personally don't plan to return.

When properly made, it is amazing! However, the quality control is majorly lacking (and has disappointed me at two locations --Lane Ave. and the new location in my hometown of Toledo, OH). The Farmer's Market Salad is one of my all time favorite foods, but on three separate occasions I have been given sub par salads missing ingredients. They have forgotten to put the candied pecans on twice (literally the best part of this salad) and have put feta on my salad when I asked for it to be left off. Also, the last time I went they put the chicken intended for my salad in a different customers order by accident and instead of getting me fresh chicken, they picked it out of the other person's bowl and put it in mine. Kind of gross. One more very alarming thing: my friend ordered the farmer's market salad and found black plastic pieces in the salad!!"},{"name":"Carthage Caf√©","address":"1851 Commercial Drive","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"what I found most off putting was the service. The servers here were from another generation, and I guess the customer service level now-a-days did not parallel with what they are familiar with delivering. The night was filled with awkward stares, inconvienet reach arounds, and high waisted pant pull ups. We never felt alone and at peace in our three person conversation. There was always one of the two men lurking around. A couple of sips they were ready to refill. Kudos for them on being attentive, but it almost felt like they were bored and trying to find something to do. We were rushed through ordering, with repeated check ins; and rushed to finish with them inquiring every 5 minutes, if we were done with a plate that was half full. First, when you first sit down with a group of girls you catch up before looking at the menu. Half the experience of dining out is catching up with your friends in a different settle. Second, some people just eat slow, they take their time to savour and truly enjoy the food. This isn't me, but I want to defend them here. Long story short, our server's pestering worked; now that we were in we wanted out, and skipped dessert because of it. Plus $5.95 for a scoop of vanilla ice cream is ridiculous. There were also some general manners passed over. When delivering our first course our served stood and waited for us to shift an empty plate. We had no problem doing it ourselves, if he had bothered to open his mouth to ask; instead of just standing above us looking down. When refilling our glasses for the 10th time, the same server reached right across my guest. He almost brushed his arm against her chest, and was success in interrupting our conversation. The second time he tried a different tactic. He snuck up behind her, and wedged his hand between her and the wall to grab her cup. Both felt like an invasion of space and an unnecessary distraction. \\nAt then same time I felt bad for the man, he was honestly trying his best and it was just coming across wrongs. He seemed fun in a cute tie your grandpa would wear: a beach scene with yellow sand and blue water. Bodies on the beach and fish in the sea. Though my opinion changed quickly when I had to watch him walk out of the restaurant on four separate occasions, to look out into the night and adjust himself and tuck in his pants. \\n\\nI don't know anything about Tunisa cooking. The menu included fish, meats, and vegetables. Nothing stood out and I had trouble choosing. I ended up selecting one of the 6 specials of the day, which was perfectly memorized and recalled by our server. But little did I know it would be double the cost of our other dishes, and not as good. When ordering specials you always feel sheepish to inquire about pricing, so I selected it based on the fact it sounded good and I didn't think any of it would be more $25, like the rest of the menu. Beef medallions in a red wine sauce with mashed potatoes and vegetables. It was good when I ate it, but reflecting back on it now and considering the price, the food was below par. Beef with gravy, mixed vegetables and mashed potatoes. Nothing I couldn't assemble myself at home for a fraction of the $30 cost. And it didn't even look that great. I looked like cafeteria slop. Something spooned on as you went along a line with your hot plate and plastic tray. I was so angry at myself for ordering this."},{"name":"Motomachi Shokudo","address":"740 Denman Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"I've been here three times so far and of all the ramen places I've tried, this is my favourite.

And it's not bad, really; ingredients for the wraps, sandwiches, and salads are usually fairly fresh. They have plenty of vegetarian options (especially their farmer's carrot broccoli soup, which reminds me of Jewish grandma stuff and is goooood).\\n\\nIf it were cheaper, it wouldn't matter that this stuff is really not very exciting. The seasonings are kind of minimal and the combinations get old. And when you're generally paying at least $6-$7 for just the wrap or salad or sandwich (never mind a drink or cookie or fruit to go with it), this is aggravating. But convenient it is, and the food is all pretty satisfying when you just need to fill your stomach and run.\\n\\nBut stay away from the blondies. Those damn blondies are the most irritating baked good on earth.

OOh, ooh, good.\\n\\nToday after church, my son David took me to Piada for lunch.  It was my first of what I am SURE will be many visits.\\n\\nDavid described it to me as being \\"like Chipotle, but Italian\\" and I think that is very apt.  They have limited ingredients, but very fresh, and you choose how to combine them.\\n\\nFirst, you select the form of your lunch.  They call it \\"order at the stone\\".  You can choose either a \\n\\n1)  Piada (a very thin bread or wrap, similar to a flour tortilla) that is lightly grilled\\n\\n2)  Pasta bowl (angel hair pasta)\\n\\n3) Chopped salad bowl \\n\\nOn David's recommendation, I chose a piada (as did he).\\n\\nThey put some pasta on the piada!!\\n\\nThen, you choose a grill item.  I chose the Italian sausage.  (They were big, chunky, very flavorful, and somewhat spicy.  Delicious.)  David had the same.  We also could have chosen calamari with hot peppers, chicken (with rosemary, garlic & lemon), crispy chicken fritte, steak (with rosemary, garlic and lemon) or salmon (with garlic and lemon).  \\n \\nAt this point, you can also choose some grilled vegetables.  David had the grilled peppers and onions, while I had grilled zucchini and mushrooms).  If you choose, you can just have this as your grill item for a vegetarian meal.\\n\\nThen, you choose a sauce.  They have three hot sauces (pomodoro, diavolo and parmesan alfredo) and three cold sauces (red pepper pesto, fresh basil pesto, and creamy parmesan).  I had the basil pesto, Dave had the diavolo.\\n\\nThey have ample toppings to choose from.  Cheeses included parmesan reggiano (my choice), mozzarella (Dave's choice) or Feta. \\n\\nI also had them add artichokes, pancetta, red onions and spinach to my piada.  I forgotto heck what Dave added.\\n\\nThen, they roll it all up, sort of like a burrito, and wrap it in foil.  Boy, did it taste good.  Caution, don't unwrap the whole thing to eat it as it is pretty messy.  Just open one end and unwrap as you eat!!  \\n\\nIt was an awesome combination of flavors.  Very garlicky.  We both reeked of garlic when we left.  I pity my poor husband because he did not go, and seven hours later, I still must reek of garlic....and since he didn't go, he has not garlic of his own as a self defense.  Sorry, honey!  Too bad, so sad.  I will not be getting any kisses tonight.  But (sorry, honey), I'm pretty sure it was worth it.  Next time, we will go together so you can defend yourself and I can still get some kissin'.\\n\\nDavie and I also each had a piada stick, which is a thin crusty bread stick stuffed with cheese, pepperoni or artichoke.  I had the artichoke with parmesan dipping sauce.  David had the pepperoni with a red dip, not sure which one.   \\n\\nTruthfully, it was too much food and I couldn't finish it, even though I really wanted to.  Next time, I will probably not include the pasta on the piada.  Basically, it just took up space and didn't add any flavor.  Or, I'll get a bowl with the pasta and not have the piada wrap.   I don't think both are necessary.  But it was a great introduction.\\n\\nThey also had artichoke and spinach dip with piada chips, calamari fritto misto with hot peppers, a side sald or soup (tomato basil or lobster bisque) as sides.  We'll have to try those on another trip.  Or you try them and tell us how they are.\\n\\nApparently, they also have cannoli chips with chocolate chip cream for dessert.  I didn't see that on the menu as I was ordering, but here it is on the carry-out menu.  DIdn't need it because the portions were very big, but when I was ordering, I remember thinking how something sweet would be nice to finish it off.\\n\\nI give the place an A +.

The first mistake was there wasn't a proper handling of first things on the top, and the newer things on the bottom.  The person I saw handling the Piada stick took fresh artichoke ones from the oven (which I was happy about getting a fresh one), and put them on top of the older ones.

For example, seeing a man sitting alone in IHOP at 4am weeping and singing a song to himself = 42,000 points. Seeing a man walk by you 4 times with 3 different stuffed animals on his shoulder in Diesel = 28,000 points.\\n\\nI digress.

I've never been to a tapas restaurant before this, but I was so excited to experience all that is Spanish tapas dining.  After finding street parking near the restaurant, I was surprised to see how busy it was on a Wednesday evening around 7:30pm.  We had a reservation which allowed us to be seated almost immediately.  The staff was friendly and efficient.  The atmosphere of Tasca is very romantic, yet fun.  There is a small bar when you first enter the restaurant, and the dining area is divided between two levels.  \\n\\nAfter ordering a carafe of sangria, I feasted my eyes on the everlasting menu where everything sounded amazing.  We began our meal with the complimentary bread served with hummus and the Caracoles Escargots.  I've never had escargots before, and my conclusion was that I have definitely been missing out my entire life.  It was so delicious.  Our next course included the Calamares Fritos (fried calamari).  We also ordered the Alb√≥ndigas (tenderloin meatballs) and the At√∫n salteado (pan seared yellow-fin tuna over a mixed bean ragout in a saffron Dijon aioli).  Next, we ordered the Conf√≠t de pato (roasted duck leg served over braised red cabbage and apples).  These dishes were savory and the flavors exploded in my mouth.  They were well prepared and the presentation was fantastic.  My favorite would have to be the roasted duck and red cabbage as well as the escargots.  To complete our meal, we ordered the Pastel Vasco (layered dessert of a homemade cookie base with milk toffee, bananas and whipped cream).  \\n\\nWith all the dishes you order, the bill can run up.  However, I have to say that I was utterly stuffed upon leaving Tasca, and my experience was exceptional.  The food went beyond my expectations.  Our waitress could have been slightly more attentive, but we excused her because of the crowd.  I hope to return again soon and try new dishes as well as revisit a couple of my favorites.  Tasca is nice for a date, but I also saw a few large parties of 8+ in the restaurant.

I expected decent food (especially considering it's Cat Cora's restaurant) but all I got was SALT SALT SALT. I got the fisherman's stew with the shrimp, mussels, fish. And ALL I could taste was salt. It was EXTREMELY salty. We sat near the prep area and it looked like they were running around with their heads on fire. My cousin got the risotto. That was a little bit better but again, it was salty (although not as salty as my dish). Service was extremely slow and I wasn't able to flag our server down to let her know about my meal so I ended up picking at my meal, trying to eat what I could (the pieces of shrimp or clam or mussel by itself was less salty) and basically left the tomato broth alone as that was spicy AND salty.

Yes, the location is less than ideal; who thinks about going to a pub and then say \\"Let's go to the dump!\\"?\\n\\nCame here just after six on Saturday night and they had a sign on the door \\"$5 cover charge 5:45 to 9:30 no exceptions\\".  Gave it a pass.  They were charging because of the UFC pay per view and I wasn't in the mood for paying a vig just to get a bite to eat.\\n\\nCame back Sunday afternoon and got a seat on the first floor in the corner a couple of tables away from the fireplace.  It was busy, but easy to get a seat.  I do regret not checking out the loft area, though.  I imagine it being luxurious with couches, booths, and gorgeous women who just want my company, but I'm sure I'll be disappointed.\\n\\nService was quick, courteous, and near perfect.  Informed the server that we had a Living Social voucher and there was no change in attitude or service (which seems to happen all too often with these deal vouchers).\\n\\nWe stuck to the $3 14 oz. sleeves of beer (the $3 sleeves are an everyday, all day deal).  They do Russell Pale Ale and some other brand's Pilsner, which I can't quite remember the name of (Big Rock, River Rock, Rolling Rock? F'ed if I know, I had 7 of them).  Did the math on it; for the beers they offer at $3, don't get the 20 oz. pints, the sleeves are better value.\\n\\nFor food, we had the Narrows Burger (burger with cheese, bacon, and mushrooms) with a poutine and the Southern Burger (cajun chicken, banana peppers, and coleslaw) with regular fries.  Food was fantastic.  It was decided that our non-wing pub nights would now be at the Narrows.  Unless our wing night turns out to be on a Wednesday, since the Narrows does a wing special on Wednesdays (watch out, Black Bear!).\\n\\nHung out for a bit after brunner (breakfast, lunch, and dinner - tends to happen on hang-over days when you can't really eat or drink before 3pm) having a couple more beers.  Decided that it was getting ready to go into club mode when a handful of bar stars came in to occupy a table.  Grabbed one last beer and the bill, and then went off on my merry way.\\n\\nWould I come back?  Hell yeah.  In fact, I even came back Tuesday night after hitting up the Dunbar Haunted House.\\n\\nStill sat on the first floor, to keep the loft a mystery for myself, in one of the half booths (bench seating on one side, chairs on the other).  The place was quiet with a few people at the bar and a couple in our desired seating of the table right next to the fireplace.\\n\\nThey were out of pulled pork and we kept ribbing each other about how much we wanted a pulled pork sandwich.  Went with share plates: deep fried pickles, poutine (sans pulled pork version), and a chorizo pizza.  The poutine was as good as it was on Sunday and the deep fried pickles were a pleasant surprise, though they could do with a little more chipotle mayo.  The toppings on the pizza were great, especially when adding hot sauce, but the crust was poor.  It came out cracker like and gave a strong impression of a pre-made, store bough crust that was frozen and pulled out just for our order.  I've genuinely prepared better pre-made pizza crusts in my toaster oven at home.\\n\\nOur server was Bailey and she was an absolute delight.  My partner in crime even enjoyed her more than I; probably because the bill was snookered out from under me and I didn't get to pay (a common battle when my friends and I dine together).\\n\\nWhat's rather refreshing about their menu is that everything is tax included.  Yes, that means the $3 beer is not $3 + tax + tip; it's $3 + tip.  It takes a little getting used to when looking at the food prices because they seem a buck or two too high, until you realize your taxes are included and then it's good value.\\n\\nThe kitchen is open until 11pm every day and, aside from Sundays, the bar is open until 2am.  This would easily be my new spot to be if it was stumbling distance home, but it's not, so I plan to be an infrequent regular, unless I've got a designated driver on hand.\\n\\nHead's up, Narrows: you're going to see more of this thirsty bastard."},{"name":"Harlow","address":"3632 SE Hawthorne Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Soooo gooood and sooo good for you!

It's been a trend to put cereals with these bing su dishes, and Frosted Flakes went well with the green tea one. \\n\\nThe desserts here are not too sweet or too heavy- similar to the Korean bakery trend that you will find in other larger cities.

Ruhhhh oh. \\n\\nI dislike what they've done w/ the food trucks - they're now abt a block away, rather than just through towards the vintage market, but I guess the exercise is good as I'm spoon deep in 3 scoops of ice cream/froyo/sorbet sandwiched between two cookies, Frozen Hoagie truck style.\\n\\nNot a real farmer's market, more a bougie lifestyle market w/ Etsy-style crafts, food trucks, bakeries, and a smattering of vegetables."},{"name":"LongHorn Steakhouse","address":"401 Park Drive","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I can highly recommend the grilled salmon salad on mixed greens. They give you a VERY generous portion of perfectly-cooked salmon on a heaping pile of veggie goodness. My only mini-complaint was that my waiter brought italian dressing instead of balsamic, and then insisted it was the correct item.\\nWould have given five stars but service was a bit slow."},{"name":"Agave Azul Cocina Mexicana","address":"5248 Red Bug Lake Rd","city":"Winter Springs","stars":"4","text":"This restaurant is exactly what Oviedo/Winter Springs needed. Great food & atmosphere. My only wish is they'd make traditional tamales vs. the Tex Mex tamales that they currently serve. Other than that, awesome!"},{"name":"South Philly Steaks","address":"12094 Collegiate Way","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Being from Center City Philadelphia, I'm really picky when it comes to my cheesesteaks. The atmosphere is great for a PA native. It's equipped with a lot of Philadelphia sports memorabilia, and the guys at the counter and in the kitchen are very friendly. Food comes out lightning quick. All in all, great service and authentic Philadelphia cheesesteaks"},{"name":"Cazuela's Grill","address":"2321 N High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"3","text":"We've waited over 2 hours.

Good flavors and the chicken was not dry. The only bummer was my burrito was supposed to come with guacamole, which I love, and I didn't see any. Taco meat was tender and portions were great for the price. The sauces are great too, perfect amount of kick. So glad this is in my hood!!"},{"name":"Austin Java","address":"1206 Pkwy","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Still love this place after eating here for the last 8 years.

Started off good except the sun blinding me when I sat down. Ordered food to share, and they didn't bring us an extra plate. Asked for a plate and watched as the server brings out other plates of food, but not my empty plate. Waited another 5 minutes to grab the attention of our waitress to a plate and finally got a plate after about 10 minutes; while she stood their with it in her hand now apologizing for not remembering it in the first place... REALLY? Then we proceed to start eating and low and behold, no ketchup, hot sauce, knifes, or the gravy or toast we ordered; finished our food when the gravy and toast arrived.
