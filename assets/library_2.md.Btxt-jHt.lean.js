I also tried two cocktails, and didn't care for either of them. (I was surprised. I'm really not a picky person) The food was good, but nothing that really \\"wowed\\" me.

Also, the dessert options were just so-so: ice cream, berry shortcake, or dirt and worms. We got the dirt and worms (thinking my two little boys would like it). Nope, they didn't even like the gummy worms. (Probably because they were home-made and not like usual gummy worms). It'd be nice if they had desserts that everyone loves like peach cobbler, cheesecake, etc.\\n\\nAlso, ALL seating is outside. (I would NEVER come here during summer.) It was pretty hot when we were there and we were squeezed together on these community-style picnic benches.

If I'm going to have \\"finer\\" food, I just prefer a more comfortable environment. There's not even a nice hill country view or anything.

That being said, for $17(12 for the sandwich and 5 for the bacon tots, which look like tots but are more frittery) I expect a pretty good meal. First the bread was stale, not overly toasted but straight stale, I threw over half the bun away. There were supposed to be grilled onions and there were maybe three. The prime rib was either way overcooked or more like store bought overcooked roast beef. There are much better and way cheaper steak sandwich options close by that I would recommend before going to tilt. The bacon tots were ok. If you like fritters, tater tots and bacon, then you might like these, but there wasn't much actual bacon, but they did have that kind of smoky bacon flavor to them.

(We were two moms with two children.) I have dined out extensively at both high end and middle of the road restaurants with kids and not ever received a cold shoulder as with this pair.   We were then directed to a high top in the main dining area which was obviously not a good selection for two children and we asked for a booth in the bar area (we were there at happy hour and would be leaving before the dinner rush).  Reluctantly, we were allowed a booth.  I agree with another reviewer that the television is distracting and not very appropriate for the space.  \\nThen the busser seemed very put out when we asked for two additional place settings (as the four of us had been sat at a table set for two).  He also did not accept dirty plates even when finally I picked them up myself to hand them to him.  \\nMost of our dinner was mediocre and I must say I have had a good meal here in the past.  But the final straw was that at the end of my meal, I tasted a bit of my son's rice.  He had not eaten it the entire meal after one bite but I had not asked him about it.  It was obviously moldy or off!!  I asked the server about it and she said she would check with the kitchen.  We were brought the bill and I expected the dish to be comp'ed as it was only a $5 dish (not a cost issue for me or them but out of the principle of good service.) I've never asked for anything to be comp'ed as I don't think I've ever been served something that was that obviously off.). It seemed like an easy choice as a server.

For the price, I expected more. \\n\\nThe roasted nuts looked and tasted like something that came from the bulk section of any large supermarket. The olive oil on the table tasted like it was either stored by a heat source or perhaps someone forgot to look for the Protected Designation of Origin logo. My dining partner's trout dish was good but not extraordinary. If a restaurant is going to do any kind of minimal-ingredient cooking, the food must be exceptional in quality and preparation. That's not quite the case here. Everything fell just a bit short. Thank goodness there was free bread. \\n\\nThere are more pros than cons at Arugula, though.

For example, that garlic sauce that is supposed to be just pureed garlic heaven- it's awful here and really tastes to me like they mix it with something (mayonnaise?) to make it go further.  I don't know why they would do this, but it just doesn't taste right.  \\nOnce we asked for olive oil- and they brought out what was clearly canola oil.  We had to ask twice before they brought us actual olive oil, and never admitted that the first two containers did not contain olive oil.  That's just cheap and lame.\\nThe labneh from here has been really good- but tonight it tasted bad.  Not tangy or rich, it tasted starchy, like it had some filler.  It tasted like cheap low fat yogurt.  Really disappointing. \\nThe zattar tonight also appeared to have been diluted with some type of oil...it was way runnier than it should be.  \\nAnother problem is the bread.  I am too used to the puffy, soft bread fresh from the oven that lots of middle eastern restaurants near Detroit serve...this cold, flat bread is just nowhere near as good.\\nAll of the entrees I have had are very good, the chicken, beef, and lamb are all delicious, the rice pilaf is heaven, and the mujadarra is amazing.  \\nI just wish that everything here was super quality- while the entrees are great, they try to push this diluted crap on you (fake olive oil, garlic mixed with mayonnaise...) and expect you not to be able to tell the difference.

Secondly, the food was awful and Americanized. I have never gone to any middle eastern restaurant to be served plain white rice and steamed vegetables with my entree. It felt like I was eating Chinese food (chicken & broccoli) all it was missing was the soy sauce. The meat although it had plenty of flavor it was very dry. I'd have to say the best part of this meal was my Pepsi. Finally, for the prices charged I was really expecting so much more. I really feel like I was robbed going here.

I had been craving these little delights for weeks so I decided to check in with Tanuki to see if they still existed (or if they were but some wonderful dream).\\n\\nHaving been on their web site already, I knew the menu changes daily and they do not keep an updated menu online.  However, I was hoping to find details on specials on their Twitter site @TanukiPDX. All I found there was sad, misled, naive \\"objectivist\\" diatribe.  Tell me, how can I enjoy spicy cinnamon tea quail eggs knowing they were birthed from of some puerile Ayn Rand libertarianism?  I can't.  If you're going to be a pain in the ass and change your menu all the time, how about posting some useful updates on your web site or tweeting about something else?\\n\\nIf I were judging by food alone, four stars easily.  The service was also pretty good last time I was there.  The waitress seemed enthusiastic and very knowledgeable about every item on the menu.

Given the recent departure of pitmaster Esaul Ramos, and the elevation of Dylan Taylor as the new pitmaster, we wanted to see how the transition is working out. At this point in our trip, we were way behind our planned schedule, having lingered a little to long at some of the previous stops. So it was after 4:00 pm before we made it to the line, and noticed several items already sold out.\\n\\nBrisket was still available, and knowing that La Barbecue delivers some of the best in Texas, it was an easy choice for us. With a little potato salad and homemade pickles on the side, we settled comfortably into a feast of this sublime brisket. Every bite was memorable and spectacular, and even more so given that this was 4:00 pm brisket! If you've never been to La Barbecue, you're missing out on some of the Top 10 BBQ in the state in my opinion. And generally speaking, the lines are never terribly long, so you're assured of getting quality product.\\n\\nThe relocation last September to the Aztec Food Park at 1906 E. Cesar Chavez seems like a good fit. The vibe is great, and we had a good time visiting with several local regulars.

With Podnah's being such a big shop, the meat can sometimes come out dry and inconsistent. You won't get that at Smokehouse 21 -- it's a much smaller shop. It's actually quite impressive how good the BBQ is, considering the restaurant's size (it's about the same size as a small one bedroom apt). But Smokehouse 21 serves good quality meats (flavorful, smokey, and great BBQ sauces), better sides (get the brussel sprouts and pickled veggies yo), and a better setting. \\n\\nIn sum:  this place is baller.

The dumplings were very thick and the pork a cylindrical wad inside..barely cooked and very little flavor. Not even close to being good. The sweet and sour chicken was basically fried chicken strips with a godawful neon, vile,sweet red sauce. I don't think anybody in the kitchen even tried. Sure, these dishes are simplistic and perhaps chefs don't even care about the basic stuff; Still this is the way I draw a baseline.

The garlicky frog legs were ok but nothing special, and the escargot stuffed onion with sausage and sage crumbling, while flavorful, wasn't one of my favorites either.  There was no textural contrast - everything was soft, including the \\"crumbling\\" which was more like stuffing.\\n\\nFor the entrees, the venison was inconsistently prepared - some of the pieces were overcooked, some were the perfect medium rare; the au poivre sauce was good and the side of root vegetables were fine.  The rabbit pot pie arrived steaming and was pretty good but the bones made it a little difficult to eat.\\n\\nFor dessert, the pumpkin flan was just ok and didn't have the consistency of flan (more like pumpkin pie filling, but with more of a cream cheese flavor) but the walnut pie was pretty good.

I haven't had dinner there in a while and they were fully booked on my birthday last week so we arranged to go tonight as a party of 6 (sadly the bf has labyrinthitis so he was stuck in bed and it ended up just being 5 of us) just to see what it was like and do something different.  The restaurant is naturally sectioned off into 2 sections so one side was set up for the murder mystery event and the other side was left as the normal restaurant setup.  The menu was set with two choices for each course, drinks were fair game.  We all tried the prosciutto wrapped prawns with a maple syrop glaze (except my parents who had the prawns sans prosciutto due to being semi-vegetarian) which was delicious.  The prosciutto had a taste and texture similar to bacon and you can't go wrong with that.  The duck breast and spinach salad was light and flavourful, the cranberries were a nice touch.\\n\\nThe rack of lamb although we all asked for medium rare came as medium to medium well but it was still very juice, had good flavour, and the sides were delicious - lightly roasted vegetables and a sweet potato or yam mash (almost as good as I make myself but I do mine with a touch of spices and rosemary to enhance the flavour).  The dessert we chose was chocolate mousse which was rich but still very fluffy so it wasn't too heavy or too light.  The only downside was the 'garnish' and I seem to remember this being an issue before, but not that big of a deal in my opinion.  The garnish consisted of curled strips of beet with kale leaves, and the leaves were often a little limp and the beet was dry as if it was cut this morning and left in a bowl all day so it was rather hard.  I love beets so it was a tad disappointing especially as the garnish was on every dish but the desserts, but all in all the meal itself was amazing.\\n\\nThe murder mystery was fun as well - I won a bottle of spanish wine, which i haven't had in years as we tend mostly to drink australian, german or okanagan wines at the moment.  The setup was an opening list of clues, a vignette with the actors, then question time where they go table to table and you can ask them prying questions - only one actor made it to our table but we managed to get enough to figure out the situation.  We also found a photo under our table mats that we had 'autographed' by another character...they did vignettes between each course, sometimes coming around to talk to guests, my dad even ended up assigned at the very beginning as a 'groupie' for the actress character which was very funny.\\n\\nI will seriously do this again, they are doing more in June, and I have every intention of being there, this time with the sick bf.  They do different mysteries each time, and I would love to see what he thinks because he usually knows who did it within the first two minutes (Literally I got home, mentioned the three types of characters, and had not even gotten into how the thing was set up when he already said who did it - seriously he's talented...playing Clue sucks with him sometimes...he should be in crime investigation or something)...I will be hopefully able to book one of the events in June and I strongly recommend anyone who enjoys Clue or murder mysteries (they often base them on Agatha Cristie type scenarios or 'British' style mysteries) should give it a try!  The food is worth the trip if nothing else!  Their regular menu is delicious as well, the mystery setup just adds an element of fun...and the potential to win a bottle of wine! ;)"},{"name":"Old Tyme Italian Cuisine","address":"612 Boston St","city":"Lynn","stars":"4","text":"Went to old time Italian last night.

When it arrived, it was disappointing, to say the least.  I had watched another couple sitting and eating while I was waiting, and I could tell they were none too happy, but the reviews were good, so I still had high hopes.  The first clue that it was not to be was the fries that I saw them packing for me.  They mentioned to me that they were hand cut, which I in fact witnessed.  But they might as well have been frozen, because they were way too browned, yet limp and leathery, with a sour acrylamide flavor; they were simply the worst fries I can remember eating.  Ever.\\n\\nThe burger was flavorless and goopy.  When they say \\"stuffed with cheese\\", they mean exactly that.  They press some ground beef around a slice of cheese and grill it up, so when you bite into the burger, cheese slime oozes out.  With a smattering of chopped lettuce, a dab of mayo, and two small bits of red onion, the burger had not a thing to recommend it.  The frozen onion rings were greasy and not good, but they were easily the best part of the meal.\\n\\nThis was really more of a one star experience.

The closest parking lot is next door $10. There was a fairly sizeable line out the door, even on a cold Monday night. It was a young, almost exclusively female crowd. I still have no idea why so few gentlemen were in need of fried chicken and waffles on this particular evening. \\n\\nWe couldn't be seated until all of us arrived. Leslie asked the hostess for some water while we were waiting for Erika. The hostess told Leslie she would have to charge her $1. I believe there was some discussion on why that was necessary, given that we were just about to sit down and be given free water with our meal, but no progress was made on that issue. Demerit for Gladys & Ron's Chicken & Waffles!\\n\\nOnce Erika arrived and we were seated (and served complimentary water), we had trouble deciding between ordering Uncle Ron's Platter (2 pieces of chicken and 2 sides and a cheese biscuit) and ordering a la carte. Our very sweet waitress, Candace, calculated that in end, it would be 50 cents cheaper if we each ordered the platter. Extra love for Candace. The chicken and waffles combination was not a temptation for me. I don't like syrup to touch anything besides my pancakes or waffles. If it touches the bacon, breakfast is scrubbed, so I definitely did not want it anywhere near my chicken. \\"No sweets with the meats,\\" as they say.\\n\\nWhile we were ordering, we noticed that the R&B classics playing in the background were frequently punctuated by LOUD recording of Gladys Knight singing Happy Birthday to You, much in the same way as would occur in a TGIFriday's. (Do they still do that?) This was interesting the first time it happened. It was annoying when the fifth birthday girl came in for dinner.\\n\\nI went whole hog and decided to go with the mandatory mac and cheese and a side of yams. Not a green vegetable in sight! Although the mac and cheese was baked, it was the right blend of cheesy, salty and some of that gooey goodness that comes with powdered cheese from a box. The yams may as well have been dessert, because I swear they were marinated in orange juice and glazed with Coca Cola. Not healthy, but very delicious. The cheese biscuits were universally loved. Gladys & Ron's has certainly nailed the side dishes.\\n\\nThe chicken itself was moist and tender, but the breading was a bit thin for me. (I hate the word \\"moist\\", so that hurt me a little bit to type.) Leslie thought it was slightly too salty. Erika said it was \\"okay.\\" In short, the chicken was ...good. Gladys & Ron's nailed the side dishes and served them with solid fried chicken. My one regret is that we didn't order any iced tea. If you're going to be in the fried chicken or barbeque business, your iced tea better be above average. You can bet your collard greens we won't forget to order tea again.\\n\\nAfter our visit, several mysteries remain. Why were there hardly any guys here? What is it such a big birthday spot? We don't know. Would we go there again? Leslie says no. Mary Ruth and Erika say not unless they were in the area and had to have fried chicken at that exact second AND had $10 for parking. None of us planned to make a special trip down there for the fried chicken.  I do think it's the cost of paking that kills it for me. Although we might consider it if there was less birthday singing and more cheese biscuits involved."},{"name":"La Famiglia Giorgio's","address":"112 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Our first time.

I use the restroom, go outside for a bit, texting friends, and when I realize that it's been 20 minutes since I ordered, I go inside.

Luckily my cousin had been there before.  We were meeting a friend there and he got there first so he put our name on the list- 45 min wait.  We got there 15 min later and double checked the status of our wait- 30 more min.  We waited outside because there are exactly two benches inside.  Good thing it wasn't freakishly hot or freezing out.  A good temp to be outside.  35 min later my cousin went to check on the reservation, 5 more min... 20 min later... 5 more min.  20 min later...you're next... FINALLY we were called.  I don't have a problem waiting an hour and a half for a restaurant I really want to go to but I do have a problem with hosts who don't know how to estimate time and you end up waiting twice as long as initially promised.

He looked mildly perplexed at the table as there weren't any drinks.  He brought over water and said our waitress would be right out with drinks.  Our waitress came over about 5-10 min later with our drinks. The 'Uptown' is a mix of lemonade and sweet tea and it's $2.50 a glass and no refills.  I tend to drink a lot when I eat so I was a little worried, but they bring out what seems like a half gallon of beverage.  YAY!  The Midnight Train is the signature Chicken and Waffles.  I wanted to go here because I'm a foodie and I had to try it at least once but I wasn't expecting much.  Alas, I was wrong.  The chicken was delicious and the Uptown was sweet and tasty.

WOW!  I loved the first round we got.  although I noted that the description for my margarita said \\"pink salt\\" and it clearly had the same salt as my wife's...  but they were both so good, real good.\\n\\nthe boudin balls!  these were perfect and I loved them.  I was sold right there and didn't need to be impressed from there.  salty sow could have coasted into an easy win.\\n\\nbut...  my wife, she had ordered a salad.  and she got a salad, and it was a pretty good salad.  but she mentioned the some cubes of cheese, and really didn't want to eat them.  I sampled one.  yes, cheese, likely cheddar, possibly irish.  then she said \\"I don't see the carrots\\".  the menu was still on the table so we read the salad description while we inspected the salad served...  no carrots, no point reyes blue cheese, no bacon lardons, and no white balsamaic vinaigrette.  four of the items listed for the salad were not present at all.  \\n\\nI flagged down the server.  I explained that the cubes of cheese were clearly NOT the point reyes blue and noted that my wife didn't really like the cheese served.  the evidence was undeniable, she excused herself to check with the kitchen.\\n\\nupon her speedy return she sort of smirked and said \\"yeah, the kitchen made the salad we were serving yesterday.  it's easy to make that sort of mistake when you serve a different salad every day.  at least this one is good too!\\"  and that was it.  my wife ate the salad, all except the cubes of cheese that she quarantined in the corner of her bowl.\\n\\nit wasn't a big deal.  we were still happy with most everything else.  we anxiously awaited her mixed grill entree.    \\n\\nthe big plate of meat arrived!  it was all pretty good!  the bone marrow was a big serving, the pork belly was a bit salty but we liked it that way after spending the day outdoors gardening.  the tenderloin with bone (ordered medium rare) was really good too.  I ate a few bites from the outer edge.  I'm not a big meat eater and I quickly excused myself from any further consumption as it got bloody and rare towards the bone.  the wife went forward, enjoying all the different textures that gristle and sinew next to bone afford.  (the wife became very ill -spent the night throwing up- about 4 hours after eating at salty sow, but we have no way of knowing for sure what made her sick) \\n\\nand the dessert, we LOVED the ricotta with macerated fruits.  I'm always happy to find a final course that is not too sweet.  we left happy, despite the fact we were served a salad that was not what we ordered.\\n\\nthe more I thought about the salad...  I had to wonder when it became acceptable to serve something not ordered and just expect patrons to live with it.  I've been to restaurants where you pay a fixed fee, and the chef decides what you will eat.  but we DID have a choice, we made a choice, and we were served something different.  can you recall any place where that would be OK?  imagine you ordered a Margarita pizza, but received the Greek pizza.  you'd likely explain to your server that you got feta cheese, olives and artichokes when you were expecting fresh basil leaves, mozz and tomato...  would it be OK to hear \\"but this one is good too\\".  no big deal, the salad was got wasn't bad, but the one we asked for sounded perfect."},{"name":"Royal Clay Oven","address":"5290 Arapahoe Ave, Ste B","city":"Boulder","stars":"4","text":"This meal truly knocked my socks off.\\nIt was by far, the best Indian food I have ever had in my entire life. \\nThe location was a little weird, but the service was excellent.\\nIt was so good I might even ride the bus up from Denver so that should tell you just how delicious it was!"},{"name":"Carmelina's","address":"307 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Great food and service.

The food is great and the employees are great. I am writing this review in the hopes that someone will get the hard working staff some help! Below is what happened today. It is an example of what happens nearly every time I order, which is several times a month. Fridays are always worse, but truly this can happen any day of the week. \\n\\nThey open at seven, so I usually try to call right when they open. Today I actually placed a call a few minutes early, hoping someone would pick up. The phone rang about 20 times and then went to a busy signal. Weird, but no big deal - I called back. It was 7:01 a.m. when I placed the second call and the phone was answered after about 10 rings. I was asked politely to hold, which I did until my call was finally answered at 7:09 a.m. Yep - 8 minutes on hold and I called one minute after they opened. I arrived just a few minutes later (I had time to drive nearly all the way there from South Austin in the time I was on hold). I walked up to pay. There were four people waiting for their food and the only employee was taking an order for 100 tacos over the phone. I paid and started counting. While I was there, a call came in for 20 tacos,  three more walk ins with small orders to place, another walk in that ordered 60 tacos, and two more people picking up orders they placed earlier (maybe they called between 7 and 7:01 a.m. when I was put on hold?). Several people were angry and shooting daggers at the employee stuck with this mess. I was out the door by 7:25 a.m., and in that time a single person was handling phone calls, walk ins, the register, and delivering orders for 13 customers (at least that was my count), all in the span of 15 minutes. At one point another employee walked over and answered the phone in an attempt to be helpful, but when she was told it would be a large order, she panicked, handed the phone over to the lone employee juggling all of these customers, and walked away. \\n\\nI truly feel bad for the employees because it is always the same with only one person covering the take out area. Everyone I have encountered is working very hard and doing his or her best to treat customers well. The problem is there is no time for customer service and it is bound to be discouraging to have a lobby full of annoyed people with no way to fix the systemic problem that is created by management not providing the appropriate level of staffing.

Between our waitress Jennifer and the GM Mike who took care of us, the service was fantastic!\\n\\nAtmosphere:  Very wine-centric decor, this restaurant exudes what it specializes in...it's cozy atmosphere, coupled with it's wine-bottle dividers and cork wall, lends to a very distinct look and feel.  The seating and tables are comfortable and well-placed (which is a relief from my typical nyc restaurants which tend to be cramped as they attempt to slam as many tables and chairs together as possible to seat more people).\\n\\nFood:  They mention on their website that the dishes are seasonal which, quite honestly, would encourage me to come back regularly.  My girlfriend and I shared an appetizer of seared scallops on a sprig of rosemary, with cherry tomatoes in a pea puree.  It was fantastic!!!  As our main courses, I had the risotto with butternut squash, fried sage, and toasted pumpkin seeds and she had the cocoa tagliatelle with cepes mushroom ragout scented with nepitelo.  Both were excellent! (I don't typically use that word to describe food unless it really creates an impact...so consider that a big compliment).  One of the KEY things I look at the menu is uniqueness and creativity.  This was certainly present in their menu.  I get tired of going to numerous restaurants where I am presented with, what I call, \\"typical\\" dishes.  I like variety, I like experimentation and I appreciate it when the head chef and owners give a thorough level of thought to the type of dishes they are going to offer and they don't just go with staple dishes I could get in any restaurant of the same cuisine.\\n\\nService:  We were promptly met at the door by one of the managers, Mike.  He was very personable, helpful and EXTREMELY knowledgeable about the wines and provided a very personal introduction to them.  He had a great knowledge of the wines he choose and helped us to pair them with the foods we were getting.  Service like that is not often heard of...our waitress Jen was both quick, attentive, personable and helpful.  She definitely represented the restaurant well.\\n\\nOverall:  As I look through the reviews of this restaurant, there's quite a mix in the ratings.  I find this to be odd.  Perhaps I stumbled across a good night at the restaurant however, I don't believe that's the case.  I also, truly believe this place is definitely worth visiting and trying both their food AND their wine.  I think you'll find it's worth it...\\n\\nSuggestions:  You have two things going for you.  Your wine selection and your creativity / seasonal dishes.  Keep running with that.  Take the things that compliment those and kick them up a notch.  I'm not sure if it's typical practice, but I think your managers are a key component of that.  Mike and Jennifer worked great together.  I think that having a manager compliment your wait staff adds a sense of appreciation from your visitors.  That the restaurant really wants its customers to have a good dining experience.  So make that connection with your people and you'll stand out even more.  Mike and Jennifer were a good example of the synergy that can occur when the staff works well together."},{"name":"Newcomb Farms Family Restaurant","address":"1139 Randolph Ave","city":"Milton","stars":"4","text":"A basic breakfast joint.

It's not that hard...a little chili sauce, a little fish sauce with peppers.  But they did not have it.   What? How are you a Thai restarant and not bring me the spicy sauces?  They lost a star for this one. \\n\\nBut that was okay, the food was pretty spicy enough without it, and I like really spicy food. The red curry was definately better than the green curry my friend ordered.  The atmosphere was very nice. It was a good place for a quiet dinner where you want to have a conversation. It might  be too quiet if you go when you are looking to see and be seen. \\n\\nOverall, Okay. If you are looking for a solid place to have dinner in the eastside, definately go.

Smoking and grilling are essential to the experience, and TR Fire Grill smokes all of their meats and vegetables in-house daily using hickory wood.\\n\\nThe bar menu features the very best in American craft beer, wine, bourbon and artisanal cocktails.

A must try even if you're adverse to deviled eggs.\\n\\nHand-Cut Flank Steak: Tomato infused, roasted tomato and onion, jalape√±o Cheddar polenta, spring vegetables. Polenta is often underrated and underutilized, but it's always a nice mix-up from grits!

Woah.

Camarena tequila, Grand Marnier, agave nectar and lime. No syrups or powders in these cocktails!

The restaurant was packed, even at half past 11 pm and I took it as a good sign that I was the only non-Asian in the place.\\n\\nI began with the  BEST scallion pancakes I've had since King Fung Garden. (does anyone know if that place closed or relocated?) They were crispy and light and extremely flavorful, even before I added any of the beautifully balanced, soy/ginger dipping sauce.\\n\\nThe hot & sour soup was delicious as well, with the perfect blend of white pepper and vinegar.\\n\\nMy main dish was a tad disappointing and the only reason that I'm not giving this place five stars. Though it was presented well, the flavors of the chicken, broccoli and mushrooms weren't melded that well.  The individual ingredients were good but as a whole, the dish, Szechuan chicken, by the way, lacked identity.  I had ordered it spicy and there were several good sized chilies in the dish but I would have preferred them to be crushed or ground, not whole. \\n\\nService was prompt, efficient and courteous.

The calamari was your typical Asian spicy style, always delicious, however missing the best pieces, no tentacles just rings.  A little bummed but still a good dish.  I had the five spice tuna which was incredible if you like five spice.  My leftovers were even better the next day.  I tried someone's steak and almost wish I went that route, it was that good.  I'm more of a seafood guy than a meat guy, but it was very juicy and flavorful.  And I can't forget the dessert, salty caramel cheesecake, one of the best I've ever had!

I know I talk fast when I'm excited, but there's no way she didn't understand things like \\"lettuce\\" and \\"barbeque sauce\\".

The white interior is accented with natural woods, industrial vents, high ceilings and windows that invite tons of natural light. The walls are filled with art from local artists which rotate regularly. On the counter they have an Oji cold brew coffee system from Japan which looks like it belongs in a chemistry lab.\\n\\nEverytime we visit Steveston, this is one place we always drop by to get takeout coffee before walking around the neighbourhood. If we need a break, the cafe is equipped with WiFi and spacious tables. At the front, there is a communal wooden table or opt for a smaller table along the wall for yourself. It's a great place to read, or work during the day.\\n\\nThey also offer tea, hot chocolate, juices, pastries, sandwiches, freshly roasted coffee beans, and coffee equipment. The baked goods are from a local bakery, The Sweet Spot.\\n\\nOrdering Tips:\\n- Dripped coffee lovers, try their pour over or siphon coffee. \\n- French press coffee lovers, try their Espro Press. \\n- Espresso lovers, try their flat white for a velvety texture or cappuccino for more of a milk foam.\\n- Soy and almond milk is available.\\n\\nOVERALL IMPRESSION OF ROCANINI COFFEE ROASTER IN STEVESTON:\\nIf you're visiting or living in the Steveston area, we definitely recommend coming to check out Rocanini.

I also asked them for a glass of Coke, but it never came out. I didn't bother to ask since we already finished our meal. I noticed that at other tables when they had leftovers and asked for a box, they would boxed their food for the customers but for us, they handed us an empty box and bag and just walked away with our payment and bill.

Its almost like there's an oven in the room or something. The place was really warm and stuffy. Also, despite their signs everywhere instructing folks to order first and then find a table, most people seem to walk in, puts their purse or a glass of water on a table, and then proceed to get in line to order. We ended up getting our order to go and heading down to the Tin Bucket  because there was nowhere to sit. \\nThe pizza is great, but the fast food style seating doesn't really lend itself to high quality of food that takes time to prepare.

The Guacomole was served with chips and the restaurant made their own chips. No chips from El Milagro here (For the record El Milagro chips are good). Guacomole was good too.\\n\\nMy friend mentioned to me this place was known for their mole (not the animal but you get the picture). I knew I had mole but it was a long time ago. I forgot how it tasted like. So I ordered the Mole Poblano with chicken and veggies. It was really good. The chicken compliemented the poblano sauce which was a black color and not too spicy.

The glassware and decor is modern and sleek. The staff was accommodating, energetic and very friendly.

There was an unpatched hole in the wall on the ground level near the staircase. Our table had clearly been cracked and then patched with silicone.

Soft and chewy bread with plenty of hard crust--the perfect split for me and the manfriend. We started with the mozzarella--a must whenever we run into the good bufala stuff.

I thought this was a family oriented restaurant, one not requiring one to be 21 to even be seated. At this point,  I just took it as I do look a little young for my age she didn't want some \\"kid\\" sitting at her bar. After showing my ID, I order a bourbon on the rocks, which I received several minutes later in a rocks glass with a measly 1/4 shot on ice. She then explained that she was out of the bourbon in which I selected but proceeded to charge me the full price and went without offering as much as a comparable option instead. Coming from a bartender, this is a deplorable showing of what good customer service is and should be. I then ordered food, which was underwhelming at best. The restaurant on the inside is nice and great ambiance, but the food is severely lacking. As someone else stated, save your time and go to Napoleon's on Lavista -much better quality from service to food.

The salmon rillette was great, and they brought extra crustini without an extra charge.\\n\\nThe Bad: You should probably make a reservation. Their drinks aren't as awesome as Drink Well, but still pretty good. They need to get a little more creative with their Bloody Mary's and their beer is a bit pricier than I'd like. \\n\\nSuggestions: Make reservations.

We got a small order of calamari and a large order of spring rolls. The calamari was tender, fresh, and seasoned well. Chili pepper paste was light dolloped on the calamari and it was served with a spicy mayo. The spring rolls were crispy, full of veggies and served with a sweet chili dipping sauce. I really think the spring rolls were simple but executed well because they were fried perfectly. \\n\\nSo after those appetizers we realized we were still hungry, but not hungry enough for meals so we got a large order of calamari. Clearly, we really liked it. This order took long to get to us which was disappointing since the first order came so quickly and we wanted more. \\n\\nI think the prices are fine for being in a hotel.

My husband ordered the Arugula salad and the Bolognese Pasta.  After ordering they brought out bread with pesto and olives...I think this was the best part of the meal.  During the bread and the very short wait for the appetizers they filled the remaining seats in the dinning room with TWO different business dinner parties.  Making it impossible for me to hear my husband talking to me from across the table.  I completely understand having business dinners, but do they have to be in the same dinning room as the rest of the patrons?  Back to the food, the apps arrive and my mozzarella was nothing like what I was expecting, it was bland and dry (not the super soft moist cheese I was expecting).  The best part of the plate were the four tomatoes that were on the plate...my husbands Arugla salad was ok...he didn't say anything negative about it, well that I could hear.\\n\\nProbably 5 minutes after they cleared our apps, the meal arrived.  The lobster ravioli was huge - and stuffed with lobster meat.  Unfortunately, the lobster was dry and there was no flavor to the pasta, sauce or veggies on the plate.  All you could taste was the lobster, which didn't really taste that good (and I love lobster).  My husband's Bolognese had sauce that tasted like it came out of a can, and the meat was dry.  The pasta itself was chewy and al dente and didn't taste like anything, so I can't say it was bad, but I definitely won't say it was good.\\n\\nWe didn't order dessert.

In short, if it wasn't for the beef rib, I don't know if I would come back here again. I'll compare la Barbecue to Franklin as it's what most people are familiar with.\\n\\nWait times: The perfect time to get here is between 9:30 and 10am. You'll get your food by around 11:30. Advantage: la Barbecue.\\n\\nFor food, let's start with the beef rib. Everything you have heard about it is true! It literally melts in your mouth as you bite into it. The seasoning is perfect. The meat falls off the bone so well that gravity nearly pulls it off as you pick it up. And it's gigantic. It's pricey, but you could easily just get one and have enough to take back with you for at least another meal. la Barbecue easily trumps Franklin here.\\n\\nThe brisket could have been more moist. The fatty side of it was out of this world, but the lean portion was surprisingly dry and a little bland. The pulled pork sandwich, sausage, and pork ribs were only decent. In fact, I'd say the second best meat was the turkey, which shouldn't be the case in a barbecue joint. Props to laBBQ, though; the turkey was moist and delicious. Franklin beats la Barbecue in every other category.\\n\\n...Except sides. I absolutely loved the chipotle slaw. The balance of mayo and chipotle is excellent. laBBQ deviates slightly from your typical barbecue sides and in my opinion it pays off tremendously. I'm looking forward to trying the black bean salad next time. While it may not be for everyone, I like la Barbecue's sides over Franklin.\\n\\nOverall, la Barbecue is not as well-rounded as Franklin, and so my verdict goes to Franklin. I was conflicted between giving laBBQ 4 or 5 stars because there wasn't much to talk about besides the beef rib. But because the beef rib was just that good, I'd come back here just to get one. 5 stars."},{"name":"Carmelina's","address":"307 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Stopped into Carmelina's because we found  a spot out front, saw the open windows and thought we would give it a try.

I'm sure stuff has changed since I left in '05, but the staff included some of my favorite Bostonians.\\n\\nFirst of all, there are two dining areas here: the dining room (requires reservations) and the bar/cafe (doesn't take 'em).

On busy weekend nights -- and there are plenty -- drinkers forfeit table rights.\\n  \\nOn to the food.  It's Mediterranean/Middle eastern, seasonal and fantastic.  There's a sizeable selection of small plates that are vegetarian-friendly (house-made hummus, arugula salads, seared tuna) and easy to share if you want a quick bite with cocktails.  Entrees are pricey but generous, and include venison, bluefish and often an imiganative vegetarian entree such as roasted and stuffed eggplant.   My favorite aspect is (was?) that the chef works almost exclusively with local farmers -- everything is sustainably grown & raised and super-fresh -- which is reflected in the flavors.\\n\\nThe bar & jukebox combo are reason enough to check it out, especially after a show at the Brattle, and the food quality's extremely close to that of The Harvest, just served in a younger, more laid-back setting."},{"name":"Derby Joe","address":"142 Derby St","city":"Salem","stars":"4.5","text":"Best place to get coffee in Salem.

The quality of the food was very, very poor, especially based on the extremely high price.  The escargot dumplings were bland, and basically amounted to a large amount of tasteless dough with a tiny escargot inside.  The filet did not seem like a filet, but possibly a flank steak covered with some sort of lumpy mystery sauce.  The meat came with vegetables that were also bland and nothing better than what I could make at home.

We sat down at a dirty table with other people's used dishes and were not acknowledged for at least 15 minutes! Then we were asked if we wanted another round! We finally put our order in and mentioned that we were on a time crunch. We should have taken a cue from the people on our left who sat for a half hour without even getting water; they got up and left. Then the folks on our right were delivered the wrong wine! It was just one thing after the other. Waiters were frantically rushing around yet again no one touched base with us. The bartender was also directing the waiters as to which tables were new. After an hour of being ignored, and still no food, we just got up and left.

Made a reservation here for Wednesday and was surprised to show up to a completely empty restaurant. \\n\\nLet's start with the good: The service was solid, but I'm not sure if that's because there was no one else, so we had almost three servers checking up on us at any given time. Ordered the guacamole, the seasonal ceviche, the Pastel Azteca and the Tlayuda Oaxaquena, as well as a drink. It's nice to see an actual Mexican restaurant and not just another tex mex place, especially one specializing in Oaxacan food, which is rarely seen on our side. Of the dishes the Pastel Azteca was the star. A wonderful mix of savory and sweet it carried layers that hung on the pallet and was easily the most memorable dish. The Tlayuda was basically a glorified tostada/nachos, which is okay because I knew that is exactly what it was and have a strange love affair with nachos. The ceviche was the other winner, I believe that it was yellowtail at the moment, and the cooks at El Naranjo know how to properly make a ceviche. The two key points are texture and how \\"cooked\\" the fish is with acid and they got it both right. \\n\\nNow the meh: When we left I mentioned that they shouldn't be called El Naranjo, but El Limon, because everything thing there (except the Pastel Azteca) was drowning in lime. In the Ceviche it worked, though was a little overbearing, in the guac not so much. Also the drink we ordered, something based around their house made orange liquor was so strong it was like drinking cough syrup. And I love my strong spirits.\\n\\nOverall I quite enjoyed it though.

The waitress didn't learn from her first mistake. She brought out my meal but forgot to put in the food order for my friend. So, my friend waited another 20 minutes.

The food, drinks , prices and service are all great. It is definitely one of my fave restaurants.\\n\\n---------------\\n\\n6/20/18\\nThe above is my typical experience at Cheddar's. Our experience 6/20 was an entirely different story. It was like if anything could go wrong, it did. It got to the point where all we could do was laugh. We were seated quickly, and our drink orders were taken almost immediately. Now here is where we start to go downhill- when my Painkiller was brought to the table, it was overflowing and when they placed it on the table it spilled on the table (creating a puddle underneath the menu) and all over my wrapped silverware. It also spilled onto my iPhone. We wiped it up as much as we could with the napkins we had, but then noticed there was even more under the menu so we asked for more napkins when the waitress came back. Even though she was aware of what the napkins were for, she came back dropped the napkins on the table and walked away. While we had no problem wiping it up ourselves, it was sticky and we were surprised she didn't offer to wipe it up with a wet rag. \\n\\nNext we ordered 3 appetizers (there were 3 Adults in our party, all separate checks) and when we received them we had to wait and ask for plates. When we placed our Entree orders, we asked if it could be delayed a little to give us time to eat the appetizers because there wouldn't be room on the table- she stated they had to be prepared so they wouldn't come right out. My daughter then ordered Honey Butter Croissants, when we received them the first thing we noticed is they were much darker than usual- basically burnt. We were then told the recipe had been changed and we were handed a survey. We were annoyed that this was not mentioned when we placed the order, which means that we were not receiving what we ordered and were used to but, we were still going to have to pay for it. The three of us tried them and didn't like them (the new recipe is AWFUL) - three croissants were left on that plate but, my daughter still paid for them. The waitress did check back to see if we liked the croissants and we advised that we did not- but again, although we were not satisfied and left 3 uneaten, we were still charged. \\n\\nOur entrees arrived while we were still eating the 3 appetizers- and we had to try to consolidate in order to make room for the entrees (all of our empty glasses were still on the table as well even though she brought us refills). I ordered the Country Fried Steak, which I was extremely disappointed with- as it was 80% breading and 20% meat- I did enjoy the corn and potatoes, however (which is mainly what she ate). Our friend ordered the Dijon Chicken which she was not pleased with as it had too much Dijon and she was not asked if she wanted gravy on her potatoes which SHE DID NOT but, got anyway. My daughter had Spasagna- which was excellent, as usual. \\n\\nNow comes dessert- our friend ordered chocolate cake, and my daughter asked for the Apple Crisp which she loves and was one of our main reasons for going. After about 10 minutes, the waitress returned and was cleaning up our other empty dishes and then looked at my daughter and said \\"Oh! We don't have any Apple Crisp, we are out of Apple Crisp\\" as if this was an afterthought for her. As disappointed as we were, we said we would try the Monster Cookie. Our friends Chocolate Cake arrived first- and we were surprised at how huge it was (it was DELICIOUS, NO COMPLAINTS). Next arrives our \\"MONSTER\\" Cookie, first thing we noticed was how small it was. The second thing we noticed was how BURNT it was. My daughter tried to take a few bites, with the ice cream, to see if that would cover the burnt taste...it failed miserably. The cookie was almost black. By the time the waitress returned to check on us, mind you the restaurant was not busy, the ice cream was almost completely melted and covering the cookie. When we advised her that we didn't want the cookie, because it was burnt, she looked and said \\"Okay- do you want another\\" ... my daughter said no thank you. Our friend and I did ask if we could get some water, I didn't receive any refills throughout the whole meal. \\n\\nWe received and paid our checks- mind you there was plenty of delay between our server's visits to our table and again they were not busy. Our friend and I had to ask for our water again- and finally received it AFTER we paid our bills. I am not one who complains- but, this is definitely not the Cheddars experience that we are used to. While the waitress was extremely nice, she was very nonchalant and unapologetic for all the things that went wrong. The other thing is, the service was very slow causing our visit to be 2 1/2 hours."},{"name":"Clay's Sports Cafe","address":"6518 Roswell Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I have only had delivery from Clays.

After checking some reviews, we decided to check out La Barbecue instead. I am so glad we did!\\n\\nWe arrived around noon and there was a line of about 25-30 people. Not too bad. We sent a few friends to pick up a cooler and some beers for the wait. It probably took about 45 minutes before we got to order, but it was one of the nicest line waiting experiences I have had. They had a band playing and everyone around was friendly. The aroma of the BBQ in the air was amazing and we couldn't wait to order.\\n\\nWhen we got to the window the pulled pork was sold but they seemed to have pretty much everything else still available. We were greeted with a sample of the brisket which was to die for. Growing up in the north, I never experienced anything like that perfectly cooked meat. We were sold and got a pound of the brisket as well as some turkey, ribs, baked beans, coleslaw, and potato salad. \\n\\nWe grabbed a picnic table and dug in. It was food heaven.

I had the ribs and steak tips combo. The ribs fall off the bone (as I'm sure you've heard) but that just means they were wrapped in foil then grilled for a bit then slathered with sauce. Good but not great. The steak tips were under cooked. I will get them medium well if I go back. Very flavorful. The bruschetta was just French bread covered in cheese and some garlic tomatoes. A filler that we didn't finish. The pasta and veal piccata was yummy but too much. You will bring some home. \\n\\nThe bar is like a dive bar, cheap with interesting scenery.

SERIOUSLY. All the hundreds of Middle East Club shows I've gone to in the past 7 years would have been so much better had they started off by a dinner at Veggie Galaxy. Though I cherish those late night moments at Falafel Palace, this new place is definitely going to win my heart fast. \\n\\nI got to go to the same sneak preview last night of this restaurant with the Boston Vegetarian Society. It was the best deal ever - $5 for anything you wanted! holla! + free cookies! \\n\\nKristine and I split the vegan french toast stuffed with banana nut cream. It was delicious (make sure to see the pic I uploaded). It was a very generous portion too. \\n\\nThen I ordered the Reuben (pic uploaded) and she ordered the open fast seitan sandwich (pic uploaded). She liked my Reuben better and I liked her seitan sandwich better. We shared. I loved the seitan because the swiss chard in the sandwich was spicy with so much garlic. Delicious! Super garlic breath here I come! However I asked for wheat bread instead of rye bread because I hate rye and they served my Reuben with rye anyway. I sucked it up and ate it but STILL. Also even though it was apparent to the waiter that I was vegan since I had asked about the vegan options, he didn't tell me the Reuben comes with swiss cheese. On the menu it just says \\"swiss\\" and reading it fast, it didn't occur to me. So I took a big bite into the swiss cheese and was gross out. a) I have always hated swiss cheese and b) there is no such thing as vegan swiss so I knew it was real cheese! AHH Leave it up to a vegetarian restaurant to serve me real cheese! I ate around the cheese as much as possible but I couldn't finish my sandwich. Bummer. The owner came up to us and I told him to make it more clear on the menu so hopefully it won't happen to anyone else. \\n\\nThe side potato salad was sooo good!! And the side of kidney beans were also amazing.\\n\\nFor dessert (mostly small portions) we shared the strawberry cheesecake (so much like real cheesecake), blueberry pie (yum, diner style), and the Taza chocolate butterscotch pudding (yum though I would have liked the butterscotch flavor to be a little stronger. Taza is amazing but it dominates). (see picture uploaded!) \\n\\nWe didn't get drinks but next time I will come for a vegan milkshake when they have them! This place also have beer and wine. Kristine did order a root beer but the waiter forgot it. Oops. \\n\\nAll the desserts are vegan and the dessert area serves as almost a separate vegan cafe. So glad they carry Equal Exchange coffee and other local Boston companies. \\n\\nSo in all for a soft opening they did very well. I can't wait to go there again (just without the cheese!)"},{"name":"Ovation Coffee & Tea","address":"941 NW Overton St","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"The owner and the employees are fantastic folk.

The wait was over an hour, which was to be expected. I was pleased with the staff, they did their best to expedite the wait time. I was very disappointed in the dress code or later the lack thereof. Patrons wore bikini tops, panty like shorts, etc. My 9 yr old daughter had a hard time understanding why someone would dress like that at a restaurant. \\n\\nOnce we were seated, it was in a booth next to a bench where other customers were waiting. My daughter and I couldn't enjoy our meal or hear each other talk because of the loud conversations going on next to us. One group FaceTime a man with him on speaker and the conversation was very inappropriate, at that point she expressed how uncomfortable she was. I think they should remove that bench so patrons can enjoy their meal. \\n\\nFor our meal, I ordered the signature chicken and waffles, Midnight Train and the waffle was overcooked, chicken lacked flavor and the catfish was overcooked as well. My daughter's Mac and cheese was very bland. We also shared the peach cobbler and our portion had a lot of burnt crust in it. I wasn't pleased with meal.

The Rosemary elote was my fav of the bunch; however, I wish it had just a hint of cayenne for some heat since it's more of a Mexican cream corn style dish. All the other sides were great as well. For dessert, we had the brownie, sticky toffee pudding and the popcorn ice cream. They were all delish, but we enjoyed the ice cream and the pudding the most. The wines were great as well...I had the Malbec and others in my party had the Cabernet. Valet parking was free with a stamp from the restaurant so no need to search for parking on the street.

There is one on Main Street in Reynoldsburg, but it's not nearly as good. See my review for the one on Main Street in Reynoldsburg. THIS is the Gengi Go our family goes to when we have a hankering for yum-yum sauce (of which I just had to buy a bottle of last time!). The rice is cooked nice and tender, but is not crunchy and the vegetables are always freshly prepared as I walk in, as is the meats: steak, chicken and shrimp. My favorite bowl is the shrimp and steak with double rice, onions, bean sprouts, mushrooms and yum-yum sauce and is about $15 or so.\\n\\nIf you have never been to the actual restaurant, it is certainly worth the first visit. The cost goes up (~$20/person), but your food is cooked really fresh right in front of you, and you get a nice show from the extremely talented chefs that prepare your food. If you go in a group of 4-5-6 or so, you'll probably get your own table, so you get the individual attention of the personal chef assigned to that table. You'll laugh and be amazed! But, if you've seen the show, it's cheaper just to get the food to go :)\\n\\nTIP: You can buy the yum-yum sauce by the bottle (and perhaps the ginger too, not sure, I wasn't a fan of the ginger at all) and use it as dip for chicken strips, salad dressing and many other things!

There were only a couple of tables that were filled, but based on the daily specials that our server let us know about - we were there on the wrong night! \\n\\nWe ordered a bunch of food and just shared as a table. For appetizers we had the Spring Rolls, Vegetable Tempura and a bowl of Coconut Soup with Chicken. The fried food came with dipping sauces. Everything was amazing! \\n\\nFor dinner, we split the Pineapple Fried Rice with a vegetable add-on and the Pad Thai with Chicken. We went with Medium Spicy just because we didn't know what their heat index was all about. Medium Spicy was just my speed. Just enough heat to not overwhelm the flavor of the food. Needless to say, we devoured most of the bowls. There was a bit of Pad Thai left. \\n\\nSo, they have their desserts on display on a big chalkboard over the bar so you can stare at it all night and contemplate which one you want. Well, as full as we were, we couldn't resist the Fried Green Tea Ice Cream and the Blueberry Spring Roll. Both came with a Lychee (a Chinese fruit) and the Blueberry Spring Roll came with Coconut Ice Cream and a peach pur√©e. We all swore we were only going to have a couple of bites and we ended up cleaning the plates. Everything was terrific. \\n\\nDid I mention we were starving when we walked in?! Spoon cured us of that. Great place! I loved it! I will definitely come back to eat at Spoon.

We were fortunate to snag a small one, but if you're debating whether to splurge or not, I say stick with the brisket.

I started with the Lobster Pasta (which is a home-made lobster ravioli), then went to the rabbit pappardelle (I literally can't turn this dish down when it is on the menu.... it's a true compulsion).  Both of these were great.\\n\\nFor those of you who can't make up your mind between two different pastas, they're happy to give you half-portions of each one so you can try multiple items, which I think is a wonderful and not-used-enough idea.  It ranks up there with John Slover at Ciano allowing you to pick any wine off the bottle list and commit to only 2 glasses (for half the bottle price) while he sells the rest of the bottle off the glasses list.  More restaurants should offer options like that as a way of differentiating themselves... maybe market forces will cause it to naturally happen.\\n\\nFor desserts we tried the chocolate tort with espresso gelato and the Sfogliatelle (puff pastry with fig glaze).

These guys failed me on both accounts. The bun should not only house the burger, but be an intricate part of making it a great meal. \\n\\nThe bun here was too small for the burger, the three cherry tomatoes I got were super tasty, but too few. The lettuce, one big wilted piece that was pulled out from the first bite- how effing annoying is THAT? I love the large julienne of onion though- complimented the hell out of the burger. The burger was a perfect medium (I ordered Medium-Rare), tasty as hell, but it was due mostly to the over seasoning of the meat and the super greasy aspect of it all. I didn't have to wear Chapstick for three days. Seriously.\\n\\nSo here's my beef. No pun intended. The meat was old. Even cooked to medium, the burger was gray inside. Which means what? Atleast a four day old patty. Kinda scary to know they're either hanging onto meat longer than they should or that there's some serious temperature abuse going on in that kitchen. The illusion that I actually had tomato on my burger was more than irritating. \\n\\nI would have given three stars based on the burger itself, if it wasn't for how absolutely disgusting this establishment was. Seriously disgusting. It's hard to find the words. Trash on the floors, ants on the burger bar, the tables and silver bar that circles the..well, bar were sticky  with food residue.\\n\\nI've actually wanted to go back and have a burger and maybe try their sides. I've craved the greasiness like no other...but the filth of that restaurant and the idea( and probably inevitable truth) of their kitchen matching their FOH has me scared s*****ss. No thanks.

There is a lack of a solid bark on the brisket.  The bark on this Brisket is soft and not crisp like johns.  This is due to a longer smoke time with less heat.  Also forgot the legendary 1 inch smoke ring that I loved from John Mueller.  So i ordered a pound of brisket that came to $20.  All I can say WTF.  I could understand if this is the best BBQ in the world.  Also my suppose half pound of ribs came to $14 with the extra weigh added.  If anything I would say that I felt my wallet getting raped.  Also one other thing to be noted is that the new sauce was a lot more watery with less of pepper and onions.  As far as the sausage it lack that snap and was a grease mess.  I liked the taste but the amount of grease was a little to much.  \\nMy conclusion is that I won't go back and use the extra money I would have spent there to drive to snows on Saturday or the Mueller's in Talyor.  This was my favorite place but not any more since I don't like the prices and to be honest I don't think that the BBQ is anywhere close to the bar John Mueller set.  To be honest its good but not the best and at the prices this should be the best bbq in Austin/Texas.  Also for all you no reservation fans its not the same.  At least I had a year of the best BBQ of my life.  As I learned all good things must come to a end sometime.  RIP my favorite place and I hope John will be back.

It's not east coast Chinese and for some reason it's not really that good. This town is successful with every other type of Asian cuisine but how is this one overlooked?? Where is my day glow Egg Drop Soup???? Why am I stuck with Egg Flower Soup? Where are the good spare ribs with sticky red sauce and the always funny Pu Pu platter? \\n\\nWell, I was out in the Beaverton area with friends and he told me that China Delight was pretty close to east coast Chinese food and that he really enjoyed it. Ok, works for me, off we go. No Egg Drop Soup. Bummed. But we did get some really good potstickers. No sweet chili sauce though. They had a nice lemongrass sauce that went with them and it was decent. We ordered a chicken dish and Orange beef. A simple classic. We ordered white and brown rice and I assumed we'd get a small bowl each, nope, we each got a large steamer full of rice. Wow. The Orange beef was actually really good with the exception that the slices of beef were huge, not bite sized. The chicken dish was good but there wasn't a lot of chicken in there and way too many water chestnuts and very little green onions. So basically the meal was hit and miss. Not the best, but better than some of the other places I've been to over the past year and change.\\n\\nIt was odd that they sat us in the bar area. Some rather loud, drunk regulars were there, so that was different. The bartender apologized to us in her own way. She was helpful. As I said the place was hit or miss. Would I go back?

The food is worth it, btw, but it would disappoint a foodie who had considered the long wait to be a journey with a destination. Instead the ambiance, crowd, and service are the point; music's not too loud, and despite complaints about smoke I'd say this is intermittent and off in the corners (it is not a smoker-friendly place, truth be told). So, the \\"Austin experience\\" aspect is real here in that the vibe is similar to Guero's music patio or something, but with better selection (and no live music that I've seen).

I couldn't have Franklins so I cannot say whether it was better or worse, but this place was pretty damn tasty.

We were going on a Thursday but didn't want to risk waiting in line and potentially not being able to try something because they ran out. Note- just because you pre-order, it doesn't mean that you're guaranteed your order. When you go to la BBQ and go to the side window for your pre-order, they cut all the meats at that moment and if they ran out, they would not be able to serve that to you. Luckily for us, we got everything we preordered! We picked up our order and went inside and laid out our spread. We ordered 2 beef ribs, pound of brisket, one of each sausage, quarter pound of pulled pork, the coleslaw, beans and 2 potato buns. No, we did NOT finish this all but we were all for the leftovers!

The broth is on the spicy side which I always enjoy and there was a bunch of different types of seafood in the dish. We ordered the King Kong roll, it was tempura shrimp with avocado and crab. I'd say that was okay, I don't think I'd order that roll again. \\n\\nNow onto the service which was lacking. We decided to sit outside with the nice cool night. They took awhile to take our order. After 35 minutes, I went to the hostess to ask if they could please bring out the roll if it was ready. They brought the roll out and we finished it quickly. \\n\\nOnce an hour passed and we started to consider getting pizza next door.. it was that long of a wait. Mind you we ordered Ramen, I don't think an entr√©e like that takes over an hour to put together. We were starving at this point, so I went up to ask how much longer it might take (because our server had not made an appearance since the sushi role 30 mins ago). They gave me the excuse that a lot of orders were in the kitchen.. but the restaurant was not full. We gave it a few more minutes and the incognito sever ran out with the ramen. \\n\\nThey said they'd give us a discount for the wait but it ended up only being the same amount offered by the Yelp check-in. \\n\\nIt's really sad that the service was not up to par because I'd come back for the food."},{"name":"Gladys Knight's Signature Chicken & Waffles","address":"529 Peachtree St NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"I have lived in GA for about 3 years now and have finally got myself some GladyS knight chicken and waffles..  guess it's all about the hype.... the uptown was the best thing that I had.

This food pod was easy to find, but it was kind of gross to see flies surrounding the area. \\n4.5/5\\n\\nFOOD QUALITY:  \\nLamb curry with freshly made Poori. I'm pretty sure I ate this wrong (like a burrito) but it still tasted pretty good. You can definitely taste the cumin, thyme, and rosemary alongside with the curry, lamb, and potatoes. Upon the first bite, you'll taste a mixture of sweetness with a intense burst of savory spices that gradually mellows to a more sweet, but bitter/smokey flavor -- but the flavors feel a little loose. All the savory spices don't seem to mold together and can only be tasted linearly. Slightly underdeveloped, but still good. Though I would have liked to taste the lamb flavors more.\\n\\nOverall, high intensity flavors that are modestly balanced and medium in density. It's a heavier curry with good flavors. \\n\\nSERVICE:\\nWhat makes this food cart better than the other is that the owner takes great care in being enthusiastic about what he's making and how he treats his customers.

During a trip to Portland, my gf and I stopped by this place after I found it on Yelp (thanks, guys!). I LOVED what I was reading, and needed to check it out for myself. It was conveniently located only a few blocks from where we were staying in North Portland, and was easy to find, despite being not much larger than a couple office cubicles :)).\\nWe arrived at around 1 pm, and were informed by the friendly owner/chef that there were 5 other orders in front of us, and that there would be a bit of a wait... It's pretty much a one-man operation, so I wasn't surprised to hear such. This place is totally worth it, anyhow! It took about 20 minutes to receive our order. During that time, the aroma surrounding the establishment increased my appetite from hungry to ravaging.\\nI ordered the pan-fried noodles with curried chicken and the tropical heat sauce. She ordered the portobello burry with lentil fritters, with fried noodles and the healthy vegan sauce, as well as the vegetarian samosas.\\nThe samosas are made fresh to order (we even watched as he rolled out the dough for the order). They're $5 (for 2) for the vegetarian version, and each are about the size of a generous pizza pocket, but much more delicious! They are topped with a sweet salsa of some sort, the recipe for which I'd kill for! SOOOO good!\\nThe Curry was $7, VERY fair by food-truck prices, and was TOTALLY large enough to serve as 2 meals. They come in a HEAPING portion that the container can barely, well.. contain! It was ready first, and despite the 30-degree temperatures outside, was STILL hot when we got back to our friend's place to eat 10 minutes later. The chicken was PERFECTLY tender, and flavorful, the noodles were relatively spicy (I'm a spicy food nut, so they weren't HOT-HOT-HOT, but I knew that my gf, who has no tolerance for heat, would not be able to eat it). Despite my ravaging hunger, I was full before it was even half consumed (though I did have a samosa).\\nThe burry was $8, and served in equally large portion. She asked for a mild version, and he happily obliged. It was still spicy for her, but she was wishing we had picked up some milk so she could eat it all as she enjoyed it so much! I tried her dish as well, and it was delicious. The fritters were probably my favorite part.\\nSide note! The cart is adorned with a red-cross sticker, and a message which states that if you give blood, you can get a free appetizer... so if you've just given blood and are hungry... WIN!\\nThey have tables next to the truck that we would have used had it not been so frigid, as well as a shelf with some boardgames and badminton rackets.\\nAll in all, 20 bucks for lunch AND dinner... can't do better than that!

I had the Rockefeller, which was an interesting array of flavors. The veggie patty really has more of a look and texture of meat than most places do. The guy said that one lady got so pissed because she thought they gave her meat that she started yelling and throwing things. Hilarious. \\n\\nThey also have some homemade hot sauces that I wonder if someone who works there makes. They're not bad, but not memorable. \\n\\nAs to the flies, well...they're just really freaking bad this year. I don't know what to tell ya folks. I've had bad fly experiences everywhere I've been eating outside this year. It's weird. \\n\\nAs to the fries:\\nHand-cut fries are really really hard to make taste good. You either get soggy fries or crispy potato-less crisps. \\nCase in point- In-n-Out Burger. They are so crispy that there's no potato left in them. It's like you bite into this lovely, crispy fry-shaped object and a little puff of potato-scented air comes out. NO potato left inside. \\n\\nThis place suffers from overly potatoey goodness that leaves you wanting a bit more crisp. \\nThere's a couple of tricks, if y'all wanna listen. \\n1. Freeze your fries before you cook em. OR\\n2. Fry them about halfway, then soak them in salted water until they're ready to be cooked to order. It totally works.\\n\\nThe main thing that's keeping this from being 5 stars is price. For a burger, fries and a lemonade (plus tip) I paid $15.

The fries that came with it were underwhelming as well.\\n\\nI've been back one time since that first visit with hubby-to meet friends for drinks and snacks.

Maybe a flat-bread pizza or two?  Add some personality to the fries--some sea-salt or garlic or....something!  plain-old shoestrings a la McDonalds just weren't memorable.

I got the Carne Jefe with a veggie patty instead of the carne, and here's the deal: the veggie patty is really good.  Is it $9 good? No.  While the veggie patty is tasty, the buns are plain, white bread mediocre. Everybody I was with liked their food, but agreed that the price was higher than what you are getting, especially since it's a self-service restaurant, which should cut down on labor.  Tilt WOULD have gotten 3 stars for being good but expensive, but because I asked to switch out the meat patty in the Carne Jefe for the veggie patty, they charged me an extra $1.  I know I know, it's just a dollar, what's the big deal, but come on, really??  It costs EXTRA for me to not eat meat? Pretty sure the meat costs them more money, since the menu is all braggy about the quality of the chuck.  The veggie burger on the menu costs the same as the burger I ordered, so it seems pretty stupid to charge me more to just replace one type of patty with another that they already have on hand.  As a vegetarian coming into a meat-centered burger joint with only one vegetarian option (even most of the sides have meat in them), I do not appreciate being charged even more.

It did have some very tasty pieces of chicken in the curry sauce.

While this isn't really a strike against them, I absolutely love eating naan with a curry dish... and the pita bread didn't truly satisfy me like naan does.\\n\\n3) The vegetable samosas were a little cold. They tasted a little bit like the samosas you can purchase in the freezer section of Trader Joes. But the price (2 for $3) was right.\\n\\n4) You have two choices of rice! This was a neat little surprise and definitely very cool.\\n\\n5) Garbonzo beans were very flavorful. This was one of the bright points of my combo plate.\\n\\n5) Prices were very reasonable.

My date was excited about punch on the menu only to have the server say it was only available during happy hour. I ordered Charles and Charles rose and I can assure you that's not what I received. Rather than continue to complain, I drank the Rose I was served but it was clearly not correct. Next problem was our table, it was so uneven that as my date tried to slice his steak that our water glasses almost fell over. We called the waiter over and showed him the table and he just stared at us and said, so...what do you want to do, move to another table? He didn't offer to fix it and clearly didn't care. We would have happily fixed it ourselves if he had offered anything to put under the uneven table legs. We moved ourselves to the table next to our original table. Anyway....the service was TERRIBLE. Empty water for most of the meal. The food was OK but not great. We ordered steak and there was so much gristle that my date said ouch at one point as he bit down on a particularly hard piece.

Franklin gets all the press, for entirely deserved reasons, but this is the better bet for those in search of cue-vana if you're not willing to commit to a 2+ hour wait.\\n\\nEven if you are willing to endure some wait, La Barbecue makes it easy, because they offer free beer! Sure, it's kegs of Lone Star, but free cold Lone Star at 10:30am on a Saturday makes for an unbelievably convivial atmosphere between you and the other folks in line, especially since they've typically got countryish acoustic bands to serenade you with funny stuff like Disney tunes as you wait. There's plenty of shaded picnic tables for your friends too lazy to stand, and while they can get full if there's too many big groups, overall they're adequate.\\n\\nThe barbecue itself is some of the best you'll ever have. Their brisket is perfect. Their beef ribs are perfect. Their pulled pork is perfect. Both their sausage and turkey are excellent also. The best value, since a pound of any of those things is north of $15, is to drop $9 for the El Sancho sandwich, a weighty barbecue monster with brisket and sausage topped with slaw (definitely do \\"el loco\\" to add on pulled pork for a nominal extra). You should also get either their potato salad or their chipotle cole slaw, because you have to respect a barbecue place that respects their sides too.\\n\\nGo in expecting to drop a serious chunk of change and stand in line for at least 30 minutes, but it's more than worth it. I recommend grabbing some friends and making a morning out of your trip, since you'll be able to drink some beer, enjoy some tunes, and then dig into some slices of heaven that will forever ruin your palate for the lesser barbecues of other cities and states. Everyone I've taken here has been blown away, so get here fast while it's still somewhat underground and hasn't yet taken the wearisomely predictable step of becoming yet another Cool Austin Attraction that no one goes to anymore because it's too crowded.

Nothing unusual or really different, just good, flavorful Tex-Mex. This time I ate at the bar so I can't speak to the table service but the service at the bar was just OK.

It was rich, thick and flavorful. The taco too was better than most I've had.\\n\\nThe Bad:\\nI wasn't too impressed with their chalupa, just a smearing of refries and a crap ton of lettuce, big deal. Although I was sitting at the bar I ran out of tea a couple times, to be fair I drink A LOT of tea but still, sitting at the bar there was no good reason to not keep it topped off (it only takes a second).\\n\\nThe Indifferent:\\nIt took about 10 minutes to get chips and salsa, any longer and my \\"understanding\\" would have started to dissipate rapidly. The reason I'm indifferent about this is that the bartender was working his butt off when I first got there so I don't think it was a case of laziness or incompetence. However, management should have had someone else behind the bar to help him keep up. The refries and rice were nothing special, just the usual fare. The tamale wasn't anything special either, if it hadn't been for the gravy I suspect this may have wound up in the \\"bad\\" paragraph but as I said above, the gravy was better than most and I suspect it saved it. The only way to know would be to have one without the gravy so all I'm tasting is the tamale.\\n\\nOverall, a fair experience that I'm sure I'll do again."},{"name":"Bin 26 Enoteca","address":"26 Charles St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"My girlfriend and I stumbled across this spot for brunch and loved it.

I am usually skeptical of food stands/quasi-restaurants with long lines, but the lines at La BBQ are for a reason.  It's delicious and they have the good sense to offer complimentary lone star even while you are in line.  Here is how I think the food shakes out in quality:  Brisket and ribs are top of the mark.  Can't beat em.  Sausages are a close second if they have them and they sell fast.  I am not a big fan of pulled pork but you're in Texas so go to GA if you dig on swine.  The sauces are all good and the hot is delicious.  Finally, the atmosphere is really great.  On one occasion at La BBQ we waited in line for a good 45 minutes with a large group.  People were kind and and having fun (the lone star helped) and the line became a vehicle for solidarity and good will.  It was blast just waiting to order food!  Mid-week its much easier to avoid long lines even at the lunch rush.  Weekends are dicey but it's well worth it.  Go for a walk afterward and do your heart a world of good.

The barbecue here is really quite good and worth the trip - even if it does involve dealing with the riff raff and rotating cast of street urchins that plague the Edgewood corridor. \\n\\nFood: Sweet Auburn specializes in Southern barbecue with a few contemporary influences. The menu consists of a fairly standard selection of meats (smoked pork, chicken, ribs, or brisket), a rotating assortment of approximately a dozen different sides, and two different self-serve sauce options: spicy and sweet & smokey. I ordered the five smoked fried ribs plate, which came with 2 sides, Texas toast, and pickles. The ribs were perfectly cooked and absolutely massive - I was only able to finish four, which is a rare occurrence in my dining adventures. For sides, I opted for the creamy mac n' cheese and the creamed corn, both of which were sizably portioned and well-flavored - the b√©chamel cream sauce used to make the mac n' cheese was particularly tasty. \\n\\nService: Friendly and efficient. All orders are placed at the front counter and your name is called out once the food is ready. We only had to wait approximately 10 minutes for the food to be prepared during the peak lunch hour on a Saturday. After we were finished eating, a member of the staff also walked over to the seating area to see how we liked the meal, which I thought was impressive. \\n\\nAtmosphere: Sweet Auburn Barbecue is located in the middle of the Sweet Auburn Curb Market, so this is not the place to go if you're looking for a quiet laid back lunch. The market is loud, chaotic, and packed with people, which really shouldn't be all that surprising for a public market. The restaurant does not have its own seating area, but there are a handful of tables available nearby that are shared by multiple restaurants in the market. \\n\\nCost: Reasonably priced. Barbecue plates are approximately $10 and include two sides. The fried rib plate is a few dollars extra. Sides are approximately $2.50 each. Credit cards are accepted.  \\n\\nOther: Hours of operation are limited - they're only open 11AM-4PM from Monday through Saturday. Parking is available in the Sweet Auburn Curb Market's private lot - the first hour is free with a validation stamp, which can be obtained from any vendor in the market following a purchase."},{"name":"Shin Jung Korean Restaurant","address":"1638 E Colonial Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"We found this restaurant while celebrating our 10 year anniversary today and it was delicious!

His choice:  The Kendall Square Burger.  I was actually asked if I would like the mushroom/chickpea patty or the black bean patty!  WOW!  I opted for the mushroom patty and potato salad instead of the red cabbage coleslaw, and had one of the best dining experiences ever!  To be able to have grilled food and not worry about it being exposed to animal grease was a completely new experience for me.  It was really a pleasure.  \\n\\nI had to ask to ask about a drink half-way through the meal (water was automatically provided) and having to ask instead of it being offered was a bit strange.  I had the English Breakfast tea which was a novel experience -- loose tea in a neat little metal pot with a built-in strainer.  It yielded at least two cups of tea per pot-full, and when I had a refill with hot water, the tea stayed strong.  You can get your choice of milks -- almond, cow's milk, half and half, etc.  \\n\\nI did tell them about the PureVia they offer as a non-caloric, stevia-based sweetener being produced by Pepsi-co and Whole Earth Sweetener Company (a subsidiary of little-known Merisant which is a spin-off from the most-hated MONSANTO (HELLO!!) sneaky, no?).

No, I don't work for the producer of it (Cumberland Packaging Corp.), but maybe I should . . .\\n\\nThe prices are on the low end of the $$ ($11-30 per person), and you can easily get food for the $ (under $10) level."},{"name":"Gladys Knight's Signature Chicken & Waffles","address":"529 Peachtree St NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"This joint is actually the first Chicken & Waffles restaurant that I've ever been to.

Just to give some context. We just moved here and came across Tilt and noticed it was by use. We got directions to it, but it wasn't where it said it as. It was in this industrial area. We kept driving around, but nothing. So I called their other location and I asked the lady where there other location was, she said, other location? She was very confused, I said on Anchor, she said what? I then ended the conversation and asked someone on the street and they said it closed down for a couple weeks and took the sign down. We decided to go to the other location because my girlfriend really wanted there Cobb salad. I ordered a double cheeseburger. I got my cold fries and a burger that was way to high to eat. My girlfriend got their $15 Cobb salad that's in a bowl that's way too small for it. The burger was something where you have to eat only half because it's too tall, which for a burger to me is really annoying. I want everything in one bite. The burger is falling apart, the bun crumbles like it's old. I've eaten many burgers in my day and this is a first. I've never sent back a burger or any meal for that matter. I looked in my burger and there's three parties and bacon, not what I ordered. I went to the counter and the lady said that's how we do it here. A single is a double and a double is a triple. I said, but that's not what I ordered and no one mentioned that to me. She looked at me with a plank stare and said, I can take the party off for you...I said, I can take the patty of thanks. She said, I can give you a new top bun. She clearly doesn't get it and I was so baffled. Such a weird experience from the start. I never want a triple patty, you should tell people that a double cheese burger means a triple bacon. The only reason I didn't give a one star is probably because I'm nice, but also because the burger itself wasn't too bad. They should however use just regular sesame buns."},{"name":"TenOak","address":"409 Colorado St","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"Ambiance is hip and old school. Great combo.

The Pizza Hut across the street that charges 3 times the price for what used to be exceptional food was always my first choice. But the pizza at Pizza Hut kept getting worse and worse. The service was horrible and they'd always screw up my order. The meat was all nasty and chewy. It was disgusting. And the prices are outrageous. Almost $50 for two pizzas. So I stopped going to Pizza Hut. \\n\\nI started ordering more from Dominos and over the last few years the quality has really improved. The pizza used to taste like cardboard but now it's full of flavor and super cheesy and they have amazing side dishes all at a really good price. They've never messed up my order, they are really polite and helpful, I don't have to wait an hour for food like I did with Pizza Hut, it's always fresh, and they always have good deals on.

There was no wait on a weeknight, and a musician was setting up in the corner. There was palpable excitement in the air.\\n\\nToo bad that excitement was misplaced.\\n\\nThough the atmosphere is the same, and the waitstaff just as helpful, the food has taken a nosedive. And not because the novelty of having streams of waiters come by your table with skewers of grilled meat has worn off. No, the food has just become inedible and cheap.  The meats are overcooked, chewy and unpleasant; the sausages, for example, look great...from a distance...until the waiter plucks one off the skewer for you. And then it goes PLUNK on the plate.  There is an emphasis on quantity over quality with regard to the cuts of meat that is very apparent.\\n\\nIt's a shame because the place has so much potential, and there're so many happy memories attached to it, and yet it has become a bitter disappointment.

This review is specifically for the Salty Sow Happy Hour. \\n\\nI finally purchased every item on the menu on Friday and the value was exceptional. $5-$6 per item (it used to be $5 for all) plus deals on drinks and beers meant that for about $60 +drinks I was able to have a full meal with my family who were visiting Austin for the first time. Considering I usually spend double that with just my fiance and I by ourselves, this was an awesome deal. Plus, the happy hour is every day, runs until 6:30, and is not restricted to the bar area. This means that, with a reservation, us 9-to-5ers who regularly miss out on happy hours are able to partake. Not only that, in my opinion it's the best in the city. \\n\\nHighlights include: Honey Rosemary Dipped Fried Chicken, Truffled Deviled Eggs, and of course the famous Duck Fat Fries.

I'm not falling out of love with the brisket, just the experience now that it's in the quickie pickie.  Also I'm not blaming QP at all, they're just along for the ride.  My beef is with how now the experience has changed.\\n\\nWhile it's great that it's mostly an indoor wait, gone are the line beers and musical numbers.  You can't bring your own beer anymore and there's no more free beer.  Want bread with your brisket?  That's extra.  Pickles?  Extra.  Onions? Extra.  Want a quart of a side?  The container is 3/4ths full.  None of the personality is there anymore, just a sort of clash of culture between the Quickie Pickie clients and BBQ lovers.  \\n\\nThe other thing is that other places are catching up in terms of brisket and have revamped things on their side including HEB and Buc-ee's and that's at a much lower price, free pickles/bread/onions, and none of the wait.  Today was probably my last big buy for now from that location :(  If you're not gonna try, then I'm not gonna buy.

Tapas. Piattini. Sfizi. Whatever you want to call them. If it's tasty and Lilliputian, I am on that like white on rice. (Also, I STILL don't understand that phrase and if someone could essplain it to me, that'd be great.)\\n\\nRistorante Damiano is itself a little piattini of a restaurant. It seats maybe forty in a squarish dining room. There's a tiny exhibition kitchen in the corner with a bar lining one side and a service station along the other, and big windows that open up onto Hanover Street (which is really quite pleasing, given that it gets balls-hot with the kitch open like that.) The place is dim, pseudo-sexy, and oddly-decorated; the giant rose statue in a vase of foil-wrapped Hershey Kisses looks like something you'd find in a tacky Italian-by-way-of-Vegas restaurant on V-Day. \\n\\nLooks can be misleading. The food at Damiano's is classy, tasty, and truly worth it. (Unless you want dinosaur-sized platters of meat. In which case, I would refer you to your local steakhouse and/or fast food establishment. Portions here are indeed small, and if you are looking to be stuffed like a Christmas goose, ain't gonna happen here.)\\n\\nOf note: the beef carpaccio, drizzled with just the right amount of truffle oil and shaved Parmesan. The cheese was nutty, the truffle oil earthy, and the beef melted away on the tongue. Also fantastic were the mussels. The broth was lemony and rich and begged to be mopped up with some crusty bread. Short rib \\"pasta pillows\\" were unbelievable, though \\"pasta pillow\\" is such a dumb term, I was tempted to order something else because I can't say \\"pasta pillow\\" without thinking it's a pejorative term for the female genitalia. Alas, the cognac demi-glace on my pillows was good enough to lick off the plate. (I restrained myself, mostly, as one should never lick their own pillows.) Pumpkin ravioli were sweet with mascarpone; the sage in the sauce kept them from being cloying. A filet rubbed down with black garlic was perfectly cooked at medium rare, and actually quite sizable at a good 3-4 ounces.\\n\\nService is friendly, casual and professional. Our server told us to feel free to shout at him if we wanted anything, anything at all. (Given the deafening volume of the restaurant on a Saturday night, shouting is necessary. Hand signals and written signs are also a good idea.) We didn't receive our courses at the same time, which was only a little bit annoying. Only other crappy aspect: our table had to ask for bread multiple times; on each go-round, we received one small slice which, though proportional to the portion size, was kind of a pain in the butt. With such good sauces and dippy things, bread is vital. I hated having to call someone over for every course and feeling like a fatty trying to fill up on the free bread during Restaurant Week. Don't be stingy, Damiano; give us a basket!\\n\\nI can see how the prices on the regular dinner menu could be steep, if you were absatoots starving. But TBH, I was perfectly full after three plates and a couple glasses of wine. The food is rich, especially the meat and pasta dishes.

The pork ribs here are great with a nice rub, smoky flavor, and fall-off-the-bone tenderness.  The in-house sausage links puts them over the top.  Great snap casing.  Coarse texture.  And spicy!  Love these hot guts!  Best of all, no stupid 4-hour line.  Wait times vary between 1-2 hours which is more than manageable for good cue."},{"name":"la Barbecue","address":"2027 E Cesar Chavez St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Long lines still but not nearly as long as some other famous BBQ places and the food is just as good!!!"},{"name":"P.F.

The atmosphere and presentation were on point (I especially love how Austin places are starting to put water carafes on the table so you don't have to wave down the server every 2 min).\\n\\nThe 4 stars is simply because I don't think I'll come here for dinner (a little too tiny plate/huge bill for me)- but I will definitely be back for Happy Hour!

For starters, it is odd that the BBQ sandwich dwarfs the chopped pork sandwich, I dont get it.  For such a small amount of money, I think ~ 1.00 dollar, there should be more parity here.  The pork is also not a true BBQ, its simply as another reviewer stated, a crock pot concoction. Its flavor is given by the overwhelming sauce, I would rather have a McRib.\\n\\nAs for the ribs, they were not cooked evenly, the thick top of the ribs were tough, chewy and lacked much smoke, char or anything else.  Besides, ribs should not be \\"fall off the bone\\" unless cooked in an oven.  This is, at best, average BBQ. \\n\\nThe sides, ugh, canned green beans and box made mac n' cheese. \\n\\nI suppose, for a business lunch, if you must, then fine. eat it.

There's local artwork on the walls and outside is a spacious patio with outdoor seating. We had friendly and attentive service from the staff as we eyed all sorts of deliciousness behind the counter. There were no sad, neglected sandwiches or uninspired pastries. In fact, everything was displayed with thoughtfulness and care, and it was really nice to see that. It was nice to see a coffee shop that cares about all the details. \\n\\nEverything looked appetizing, I had a hard time choosing. Each sandwich, for example, had a thorough explanation as to what was inside. I finally decided on their veggie sandwich (tomato, spinach, cucumber, thin slices of carrots, cheddar cheese, on multigrain) while my OH ordered the turkey, brie and cranberry on baguette. We drank a lot of coffee that morning so opted to have an organic fruit soda instead.  The server toasted our sandwiches and told us to sit down and that she'd bring out our food when it was ready. We sat at a table outside and a few minutes later our sandwiches were presented on ceremic plates with a side of green salad. Better yet, the dressing on the salad was a fresh basil/Dijon mustard aioli, which was not only aromatic, but so tasty that we were dipping our sandwiches into it!\\n\\nThe sandwiches were certainly a hit - definitely some of the best pre-made in Yaletown. There's definitely a home-cooked quality to what they serve. They were so good, we came back a few days later and ordered more sandwiches to go. This time I tried to turkey, cranberry and brie on baguette. There was a subtle hint of sage, it tasted like I a sandwich made from a proper turkey dinner. Definitely the best turkey sandwich I've had in Vancouver.\\n\\nOh, and this time I had a coffee. Their Americano? It was superb. \\n\\nGuess who's a newly converted Agro Cafe fan?"},{"name":"Gawa Sushi","address":"11156 84th Avenue","city":"Delta","stars":"3","text":"Worst sushi in North Delta.

Woah...I got to check this dig out. And so I did tonight...but unfortunately for me, everyone else is freebasing crack and therefore doesn't have a solid grasp on reality: \\"Woo! It's ethnic!? 5's all around!!!\\"\\n\\nSeriously, I don't care if the food is Ethiopian: you got to call a spade, a spade. \\n\\nHere's the real-deal yo:\\n\\nSo we arrived and were promptly seated outside near some disgruntled customers. The outdoor seating was quite nice - well at least parts of it were: sitting right next to one of the offshoots of the Boulder Creek was pretty cool; the shitty plastic lawn chairs and cheap wobbly tables were not so much. The location wasn't great (there was one of those seedy Asian massage parlors behind the place. Yes...that kind. Further, being directly on 30th, the traffic noise was pretty loud the entire time). The disgruntled customers had been waiting for awhile for service it looked like. Even so, we sat down, scanned the menu, decided to go big-style and ordered the vegetarian feast for 2 + 2 glasses of mead, all before the other people outside (who had been sitting there for awhile it looked like) got to order. The meals were about $12-15 a plate, so the $50 step up for a feast for two including mead and dessert wasn't too extreme.\\n\\nStill, for $50, I expect fire works, or at least a delightful dining experience. What we got instead was cramped and uncomfortable outdoor seating and a huge check for some of the most bland and mediocre food I've had in a long loooooooooooooong time. \\n\\nHere's what our feast consisted of: various types of lentils, all of which tasted bland, some sweet potatoes which were ok, some beats which were ok, regular and unseasoned potatoes, collard greens, some diced carrots, and various other vegetables of sorts which tasted bland and were so unmemorable, I can't even recall what they were. Now, with Ethiopian food, you don't have silverware; instead, you get some tasteless airy bread which you scoop everything up with. Thus, you have tasteless bread scooping up bland lentils...all for $25 a pop before tax and tip. \\n\\nSeriously, the meal was exceedingly unimpressive. It's like if I decided to cook, so I get some frozen veggies, put them in a pot, boil them, and then once they were well cooked, instead of seasoning them or using silverware, I would take some Wonder Bread and scoop it all up. I'm not exaggerating.  \\n\\nThe dessert we got was also unimpressive: plain vanilla ice cream, you could tell it was the cheapest kind you can buy at Safeway.  \\n\\nAnd while our service was decent, you could tell other people were not impressed. The table to my right consisted of an entire Indian family. When their communal meal on a plate came, they appeared confused, since there was no silverware around. So what the waitress did was scoop up a big old thing of lentils with that tasteless bread and then shoved it into the grandma's mouth. The waitress then left, and the grandma promptly started choking and coughing up the big mass. \\n\\nSeriously, who does that? \\n\\nI'm severely disappointed Yelpers that you made me spend 4 hours of wages on a sub-par dining experience.

We had a cactus appetizer (delicious), margaritas (fresh, with freshly squeezed lime juice), mole with pork, and a cheesy chili relleno (a special not on the menu).  The food was timely and well seasoned.  What impressed us in particular was the large number of vegetarian options, and the fact that their moles are vegetarian based.  Non meat eaters will find plenty of options here.\\n\\nThe service was attentive, polite, and just . . . well, just great.  Austin doesn't have a good service culture in restaurants (except for super expensive joints).  El Naranjo, however, takes service seriously.  More impressive was that the cook stopped by not once, but twice, to ask about our experience and the food. That was a surprise touch.\\n\\nThe bill was not cheap, but then again, the experience was lavish and delightful.  I told the cook when she stopped by the second time that Fonda San Miguel was a longstanding favorite, but no longer.  This place blew them out the water.

He poured a small amount for me to taste the wine, and then started pouring practically to the rim of every glass to make sure that the bottle would run out before getting back to my glass. Then, when the bottle of course ran out, he put us in the position of having to order again the same bottle so that we could all share a glass of wine together.

Came during happy hour on Tuesday. Wasn't stacked so I was a little disappointed that we had to grab someone's attention to get seated. We was seated by the back door where it was located near a parking lot and some of the waiters or cooks kept going in and out the building so it got cold quickly. So I suggest sitting somewhere else or bring a jacket. We parked in front were the meters are. The decor is modern, nice drinking glasses and view of N 3rd street.\\n\\n   We ordered two appetizers since it was happy hour. We order the 7 seas edamame and the kimchi pancake. The 7 seas edamame required work you don't eat the shell which at first I didn't know. It comes with lime juice and two different salts, I personally didn't like it in lime juice but my partner in crime did. The kimichi pancake was great and at first I was skeptical because it look like it had processed cheese on top but dipped in that cilantro ( it doesn't taste like cilantro which is a good thing because many don't like the taste of cilantro) vinaigrette dressing it tasted awesome. We kept the rest of the dressing for the rest of our food. I would suggest the kimchi pancake is a must try for first timers and yes I would order it on my next visit.\\n\\n   I end up choosing a hamburger for my entree there are many choices to chose from and the Spam burger won me over. The walnut panko spam was not overpowering of spam flavor, which I liked. The pineapple was thin (but glad it was not chunky) and I had to remove the red onions to be able to taste it and it was warm and not cold which is good. One thing I wished this hamburger had was bbq sauce of some type it. Originally comes with wasabi truffle ketchup I asked the waitress to remove it because I'm not a fan of wasabi. The burgers come with truffle fries they are really good but salty to bring out the truffle flavor. Probably my new favorite place to get fries.

That is the only thing they do well. \\nThe customer service- I can't even begin to illustrate just how ridiculous the customer service was. The woman that took my order on 3/18/16 was rude. It felt like it was an inconvenience that I was even there. When I tried to tell her to that I was with the folks that ordered before me so our food could come up together she couldn't have cared less. In fact it was 10 mins between our two orders. WTH is that about! \\nThe Environment- I love music as much as the next person but Jesus, there are limits. What i didn't care for was feeling/hearing just bass and no music. It was so loud I couldn't have conversation with people that were three feet away. \\n\\nLastly, the seating situation in general is uncomfortable and poorly laid out. Just do your self a favor and go to Killer Burger, cheaper, better and an environment you can enjoy."},{"name":"Thai Bloom","address":"3800 SW Cedar Hills Blvd","city":"Beaverton","stars":"4","text":"Delicious!

He was nowhere to be seen after the food runner brought our appetizers out.  We had no silverware or napkins and had to ask the food runner for those things and he still didn't bring them out.  We had to ask another server for the silverware because Antonio was nowhere to be seen.  He never even checked on us to see if we liked the appetizers.  In fact, we never even saw him until after our entrees were delivered.  Our finished appetizer plates were sitting on our table for about 5-10 minutes after we finished when the food runner brought out the entrees.  We never got a bread basket, which I assumed was coming before the entrees.  We asked for a bread basket from the food runner, our server and a second server (over a 10 minute period) and we never got the bread until Antonio came back 15 minutes after our entrees were delivered to check if we got our bread.  We finally got it but we were almost done with the entrees at this point.  We really wanted to eat the bread with one of the pasta entrees that we ordered.\\n3.  Now this is the MOST egregious thing...we asked another server (not our server since we didn't see him for 15 minutes after the entrees came out) to speak with the manager and the manager never came out.   I was going to go up to the hostess stand to ask for the manager, but my husband did not want me to make a scene.\\n\\nDespite the food being quite good here, I will not come back.  The bar scene is very busy, but the dining portion was only 60% full at 8 PM on a Saturday night.  I was here about a year ago and it was full on a weeknight.  I think the less full dining room is related to very poor service and not the food.  If you want to cater to the bar scene and not the diners, then your restaurant will close within the next couple years because the bar scene is always changing and there's always a more hip place to hang out.  This is my third time here over the past year and a half and the service was always something I thought was lacking."},{"name":"Mandarin House","address":"8929 N Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Since Din Ho's is rather authentic in style and taste... in Austin, I usually compare the Asian restaurants of Austin with that. \\n\\nMandarin House has good service for the time I went.

Long story short: the quality of the Korean food here is simply sub-par. Anyone who highly recommend this place might never tried any good Korean restaurant before. The stir-fried squid does not have the flavor that it should have. Instead, it tastes like a stir fry using some red cheap Chinese cooking sauce.

The coconut passion fruit cake was nice and moist, but the cake itself had an off flavor to it. Service was ok, the guy who rang us up was nice and pleasant. The girl who gave me the bathroom code was emotionless and held up a laminated piece of paper with the code for me to read over the counter. I looked at her, then at the bathroom door (which didn't have a keypad), back at her still not speaking or smiling and asked \\"where am I supposed to punch that code in?\\", to which she finally replied that I have to go through the first door to get to the second door where the actual bathroom (& keypad) are located.

Nothing makes you feel like more like a carnivore than smearing a glob of marrow on warm bread. Didn't bother with the chimichurri sauce that it came with. The fries were a little disappointing, as they were much raved about. They weren't exceptionally crispy and quickly became soggy.\\n\\nAs for the entrees, my table shared the Crispy Chicken Thighs and Candied Pork Belly. I was surprised to see 3 large thighs on the plate. No skimpy portions here. They all had a delightfully crisp skin and I found the smashed potatoes much tastier and crispier than the fries. Paired well with the Thanksgiving-like gravy it came with. The pork belly was also done right. Crisp top layer, well rendered fat, and fork tender meat that melts in your mouth. I also enjoyed the tart greens in the dish as it lightened up the meal.\\n\\nOverall had a great experience here and would definitely return to try out their other menu items.

It has always been greasy, over salted, and over priced.  Even the drinks are over priced ($5 a can for Austin Beerworks = ridiculous).  I relegated that place to be a place to occasionally have a  drink and that is all, but against my better judgement, returned this afternoon with friends for brunch.\\n\\nThe first notion that things weren't going to go well came when the waitress just disappeared.  I mean, we waited LITERALLY for about 15 minutes to order after we got our menus, and they were not busy.  We were sat immediately.  We finally got to order, and I got two of my favs: biscuits and gravy ($9) and a side of sausage ($3).  While we waited for our food, my coffee cup became very low (ridiculous), but I was pleasant enough about that.  Food came within a reasonable amount of time (sans sausage), and the gravy was decent, but the biscuits were as hard as rocks.  I literally had to put muscle into cutting it with a knife, and when I chewed it it was crunchy like a cookie, or perhaps an English biscuit.  Now, there aren't many things that I am sure about in this world, but biscuits are one of them.  I grew up in the south with a mother that refused to ever buy biscuits from a can.  Again, I ignored it and focused on the fact that the sausage would soon arrive and then all would be delicious again.  So I set down my fork and knife and waited for the rest of my meal to arrive.\\n\\nFinally!  Sausage came and I was so ready.  I plopped it on my plate and started to dig in, ready to have my faith restored in the place, only to cut into it and realize that IT WAS RAW IN THE CENTER.  Disgusted, I tossed my knife and fork on the plate and called to my waitresses attention.  She assured me that the biscuits were not, in fact, old, because the pastry chef arrives every morning at 6 am to make them.  I don't care.  You don't serve hard biscuits.  Ever.  The chef should have checked them before he put them on the plate, as well as known when a $3 sausage patty was done before it left the kitchen.  \\n\\nThe manager came after over a bit and apologized for the mistakes.  She offered me a pastry and said \\"at this point I am willing to take care of your meal.\\"  No.  Fucking.  Shit.  Lady.  She should have bought the entire breakfast for the party.  I worked in the restaurant business for YEARS and know that it is hard work, know that mistakes are made and how you deal with them.  I left an unsatisfied customer, and know that I won't be one again.\\n\\nThe sad part is, I met the one of the owners, Ben, a long time before the place opened at a colorful bar on East 6th.  I liked him, and was excited about the possibility of a cool hangout in my neighborhood.  I WANTED to love the place.  I have told people countless times about the great space that it offers for drinking and hanging out.  But I am done.  The drinks are over priced, the food is bad, and the service is equally terrible.  I don't mind paying a hefty sum for an experience that is worth it, and I do all over town, in places with chefs that actually know how to make something as simple as a freaking biscuit.\\n\\nOh, and for the love of god, put some sand around the washers holes.  ugh."},{"name":"China Delight","address":"8975 SW Beaverton Hillsdale Hwy","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Hey Dave K from Northside Chicago.... your review of this restaurant dated 7-29-2015.

They have a bunch of activities for you to do while waiting. We didn't get around to any of it because we didn't really have much of a wait but there was twister, coloring books, etc. The menu was somewhat of a prefix menu. You choose one salty item, one sweet item, and it comes with one drink for $20. You can add additional items for a price. The portions were good. We left full. But the food itself was subpar. The dishes were unique but I was so overwhelmed with flavors I wasn't sure what to think. I got the rib, grits, and egg as my salty and the strawberry waffles as my sweet. My friend got the green eggs & ham which was on the salty side. For her sweet, she got the banana foster. The banana foster was good, but it came with ice cream so she felt obligated to eat that first since it might melt. Our service was great. Sweet waitress with vibrant blue hair.

I'll probably go back and see if it's better. But, for my first time there, Floataway Cafe did not live up to my expectations.\\n\\nTo start, the food was less than interesting. The fritto appetizer was overly spicy, way too big, and some of the fried items were just a little too over-fried. The main course I had was lacking, too. The fish (salmon) was cooked perfectly, but it was under-seasoned, and the chic pea salad was without flavor at all. Again, everything was well cooked, but it was uncreative and really lacking the quality that I was expecting.\\n\\nWhat really killed this place for me, though, was the service. The waiter was on top of us the whole meal, constantly interrupting conversation, filling water glasses too often, cleaning plates when we were not yet finished with a course, etc. In the same move as my appetizer plate was cleared, my main course was on the table. Not even enough time to have a sip of wine. (I should note, four people having cocktails, appetizers, wine, a main course, and dessert, and dinner was less than 90 minutes because of the pace.)\\n\\nI really want to like this place.
