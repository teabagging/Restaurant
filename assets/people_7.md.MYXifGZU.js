Yes, this place has complimentary valet and pretty good cocktails but it was probably the worst hibachi restaurant I've been to in Atlanta so far. To start off with, the dining room was hot. I do understand that there's many grills and chefs cooking around us, but it was uncomfortably hot and stuffy. The chef had 2 huge hickies on his neck which are not professional at an upscale restaurant. If I were the manager there, he would've been sent home the minute he walked in the door. \\n\\nThe food didn't help the situation. I ordered the Teriyaki Chicken Hibachi with Scallops on the side. The soup tasted like plain broth. The salad dressing was supposed to be a ginger dressing but it tasted more like a bitter pepper dressing. The chef didn't talk to anyone at the table the entire time. Usually at hibachi restaurants, the chef is very interactive with the customers and making jokes, etc. It's one thing if he doesn't speak to anyone because he's concentrating on making the food amazing but it didn't taste good. The meat was overcooked and no seasoning was added besides salt and pepper and teriyaki sauce for the chicken only. I didn't even want to eat my scallops! They tasted bitter and the veggies were hard!\\n\\nThe only reason I feel this place deserves 2 stars is because they handled the situation well after speaking with the manager about our experience. I sincerely appreciated the kind words of the manager and his understanding of what was going on at the table.

I really expected to like Aquitaine, and I really wanted to.

The place was PACKED, which would seem to be a good sign at first.  The crowd was a bit rowdy though, and the noise level was deafening.  Not exactly a 'quiet bistro' ambience. We were seated at a tiny two-top right next to the  waiter's station (e.g. cash register, salt shakers and a constant stream of waitstaff with elbows next to our heads).  Some bread appeared after a while (I think the cutsie paper bag that the bread arrives in is a bit gimmicky, and, sorry, wasteful).  Bread arrived well enough before bread plates/cutlery that we wound up with a crumb-covered table right off the bat.  I can say, however, that the little roasted/carmelized garlic cloves that came with the bread were delicious, sweet and mellow like garlicky little gumdrops.  \\n\\nAlso, there's a bottle of sparkling water on the table when you sit down, and the server immediately asks \\"would you like this sparkling water, or tap water instead?\\" .  You then have to say no, and they snappily take it away and pour you a glass of water.  I felt a little bullied.  I think putting ice water on the table shouldn't be this complicated.  If I want a five dollar bottle of sparkling water, I'll order it.\\n\\nAnyway, I ordered the bistro steak with caramelized shallots, done medium well.  It arrived practically cool to the touch in the center.  Totally raw.  It's pretty rare that I send food back, but I wasn't spending twenty dollars on a raw steak, so I pointed it out to the waitress.  She did look pretty genuinely horrified, took it away immediately, came back and apologized profusely.  She said she had given it back to the chef and he realized it was totally undercooked.  I then sat for fifteen minutes while my husband ate his meal, stealing bites off his plate because I was starving.  By the time my steak returned to me, I didn't even want it anymore but the whole thing had already been cooked twice at that point so I thought I'd try to eat it.  It was brought back out by the manager, who again apologized for serving me something that was \\"still mooing\\" - in his words - and brought me a new knife to cut into the steak.  Here's my novice mistake - I cut into the end of it, and it looked okay.  Two inches to the right, and the darn thing was still dark red all through the middle.  WTF?  It came with some kind of odd warm tomatoes and nothing I could call bistro frites, they were french fries of the most ordinary kind.  I ate the ends of the steak, we declined dessert and got out of there.  \\n\\nI'm not trying to be a jerk, here, but I have spent time in France.  I've eaten in many a bistro. I'm okay with snobby waiters.  I understand that the dinner rush on a Saturday night can get hectic.  That said, something is really not right at this Aquitaine location.

Reubens is your typical New York  style deli, from the food to the customer service. Their goal is to greet you, take  you're order as quickly as possible, and make sure you walk out the door happy and satified. When I stop  in for lunch, I usually go with a whole classic Reuben.

Another thing, the waitress forgot about my miso soup, which is ok,  it happens, but then it magically appeared in the check. When asked why is it there if we didn't get it, she didn't have the courtesy to apologize for her mistake.

I'm fairly certain that this used to be the location of Mr Ho's Wonton House (which has since moved a bit further east on Kingsway a number of years ago). We were a bit hesitant since this place was dead at 11am but figured we might as well try them out.\\n\\nUpon walking inside, there's a sign which states that they've been around since 1965 which made me wonder if this is the same restaurant as On-On that used to be in Chinatown back in the 70's (anyone know?). As you can see, the inside of this restaurant is actually larger than it appears from the outside and the interior decor (aside from the partially burned out tv) was fairly nice. The utensils and dishware, however, seemed to be a bit lacking in cleanliness.\\n\\nWe ordered the Wonton and Beef Brisket Wonton Noodle Soup ($7.95). As you can see in the pic, the beef brisket, while fairly tender, had some big chunks of fat in it. I suppose that's to be expected a bit. The thing that threw us was the noodles... they seemed to be chopped up for some reason. As for the wontons themselves... I've had better. If you're looking for a wonton filled with plump and snappy shrimp, you're not going to find it here.\\n\\nWe saw on their special menu that they had lobster in cream sauce with efu noodles for $16.95 and figured we'd try that out. However, when we tried to order it, they said they didn't have any lunch special lobsters available (I'm guessing they didn't have any of the small lobsters since $16.95 is a pretty good price). Instead, we wound up ordering the Pork Chop with Black Pepper Sauce ($10.95) which arrived on a sizzling hot plate. This was actually quite good and came served with onions and peppers and a bowl of rice.\\n\\nOverall, I probably wouldn't return for the wontons.

Honestly, they could get away with changing the name to \\"Cucumber Bento\\" and suddenly the food would make a lot more sense.  There was easily a 4-to-1 ratio of the green to all of the ingredients in the rolls...including the rice!

As an avid fan of all types of beer, I ran here the minute I found out about it during my recent trip to Atlanta. And it did not disappoint.\\n\\nThe Porter is an a funky little mini-neighborhood called the Little Five Points - a hipster-esque, mission/brooklyn-like haven for the tattoed and educated-but-alternative lifestyled folk of Atlanta. I sat next to a girl who worked at a bar down the street and claimed the Bill Murray had been in for a few drinks the other night (and yes, he is a grumpy guy...apparently...but he also left a $30 tip on a $20 bill...apparently).\\n\\nANYWAYS, what I loved about the Porter is that it was a no-nonsense beer bar for beer lovers. A massive, frequently update beer list of informed, hard-to-find brews. Generous barkeeps who offer tastes of everything before you commit to a pint. Good gastro-pub food, including the staples of moules and frites (but not over-the-top belgian). The beer menu keeps an even keel, listing American, English (often overlooked), Belgian, German, and others with equal thought put into each. When I went for St. Patrick's day, the choices were Beamish draught and a whiskey-barrel-conditioned cask ale called \\"blarney\\" straight from Ireland which was simply incredible. \\n\\nLastly, the thing that I just couldn't get over were the affordable prices! Somehow, all of the beers here were $1-2 cheaper than anywhere else I've been with a similar menu. They have Maudite on tap for $3.75...that's insanity!

The restaurant has a very modern and chic design and the servers are pretty friendly.\\n\\nI had heard great things about Barcelona and was very hopeful I would have an awesome experience.  The restaurant is located in Inman Park and I love brunch in this area!  Unfortunately, my experience today did not live up to my expectations.\\n\\nOur table was in close proximity to the main entrance and the door stays open all day.  This presented a problem for most people at our table because even though we are in the first week of Spring, the weather today was very cold and rainy.  The temperature was in the high 40's and the draft from the door made us uncomfortable and cold.  We asked if it was possible to close the door but our server said they had to leave it open.  I ordered hot tea to try to warm up a little and it took over 20 minutes for me to receive it.  I asked about the status of my drink several times and was told that orders for hot tea are submitted when the meal order is sent to the kitchen.  This is not a customer friendly practice because most people expect to receive their drink orders within a few minutes of making the request.\\n\\nWhen our server passed out menus to our table, we were told they did not have enough left for each person to have their own and we needed to share.  I will admit the restaurant was pretty crowded but I felt like they should have had enough menus on hand to accommodate large tables.  After looking over a friend's shoulder to review the menu, I decided to order the short ribs hash.  While placing my order, I was told they had just run out of the entree I wanted so I had to look over a friend's shoulder again to make another selection.  I was a little disappointed they didn't have what I originally wanted but I ordered the eggs benedict instead.  I was impressed when the server offered to add shrimp to this dish after I stated I did not want the sausage it came with.  It's too bad it was served cold!  I was one of the first to order, so I imagine my food sat out in the open kitchen area while the other entrees were being prepared.  At this point, I decided my entire dining experience was shot so I sent my meal back and decided not to order anything else.  \\n\\nI don't remember hearing anyone talk about how wonderful their food was but I did hear a few other complaints.  One person at the table had undercooked eggs and another felt like the potatoes were too spicy.

Hand-blown glassware, rustic wood tables, all as expected for this relaxed corner establishment. 3/4 of the restaurant was full when we arrived and they were slammed just before we left. The menu is a mix of vegan and vegetarian dishes, ranging from veggie pizzas to sides of saut√©ed greens and hearty, protein-based entrees. The prices sounded a bit steep at first glance of the restaurant, (starting at around $13.50) but once we got our meals, we thought we'd hit the jackpot discovering this place. That being said, I highly recommend asking about portion size before ordering. \\nTo clarify, we came in for dinner service. \\n\\nI ordered a Chimichurri Seitan with parsnip mash and mushroom gravy, my S.O. ordered a Jerk Style Tempeh with Mango Slaw. Both were excellent. Eating vegetarian and vegan meals frequently, we expected the prices to be steep and the portions to be small. That's the usual with this kind of menu. Not here! Not only was our food incredible and jam packed with rich, layered flavors, but the portions were HUGE. We both looked at our plates as they arrived, confused because this almost never happens. To my surprise, the side of sweet potato fries ($4.50) that I ordered to compliment the \\"small meal\\" I thought would leave me hungry? It could have fed 4 alone as a side. We had fun guessing how many potatoes must have been used because the size of this side platter was nearly as large as our entree plates. Most of the fries came home with us and were very good as well, served with a sweet BBQ sauce.\\n\\nThe highlight of my meal overall was the seitan in my dish, surprisingly the star of the show. I'm not sure I've ever had seitan that was this good or vegan food at this quality for the price for that matter. Seitan is usually the thing nightmares are made of, a thinner, drier and chewier piece of faux meat that grosses everyone out, but this could have fooled anyone into thinking it was a few moist slab of meatloaf. I'm unsure if it's house made, but I've tried a lot of seitan, and none could hold a candle to this.\\n\\nWe could have easily split one entree and both been full even without fries. I overheard a couple next to us commenting on the portions as well. As impressive as the dishes were, the entrees could be slightly smaller since it's very likely you'll end up taking some of your meal home no matter what you order. Some dishes are probably too wet and messy to make for great leftovers (e.g., the Shepard's Pie), granted our sweet potato fries held up well. I appreciate the size of the dishes, but I wouldn't mind if the portions were half the size for half the price either.\\n\\nMy only real complaint was that the poor hostess was filling too many roles, semi-frantically moving back and forth to seat customers, grab checks, and ring up take out orders. There was one other waitress but between the two of them, they were stretched too thin for the amount of customers. As a result, the service was a little bit slow.\\n\\nAfter recently eating at one of the most popular vegan restaurants in NYC, I'm in shock that this little Watertown restaurant has erased that meal from memory.

The noodle was also cooked just right. Their Char Siu Bun is different but still delicious. The Avo Tuna was excellent. What's more, it's not expensive at all.

The bartender (Alexia) sorry about the spelling) was great, good conversation and very attentive! For a Monday night it was slow as would be expected.\\nVisited again with my girlfriend the next day for lunch. Not a lot of customers for a Tuesday lunch so I was curious why. We sat at the bar and got our drinks promptly. I ordered the fried haddock and my girl got the grilled salmon sandwich. My meal although ordinary was ok, nothing great but hey it's fried haddock and fries. My girls sandwich looked tasty but she made no comment so i will assume it was good too. If it was great she would have said something but she can judge that on her page. The bartender although pleasant seemed a little annoyed when the phone rang (he stated his wife was late and he had to cook) funny, but hey, \\"no whining when I'm dining\\". The price was the only real downer. Lunch cost me $38.00 for a sandwich, fried haddock, two soft drinks and a 20% tip. I'm not cheap but seemed a little pricey to me. In closing.. I found a nice mid evening drinking hole close to home."},{"name":"Tamarind Indian Cuisine","address":"501 N Orlando Ave, Ste 149","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4.5","text":"Good food.

The parking alone is just horrible because the harbor, a restaurant and Mozart's share. You have to really enjoy the food or coffee or really need a dip in the water to come here.\\n\\nThe interior of Mozart's is nice. Backup, there is a deck where you can sit outside if you like and bring your dog. The dock is shared with another building and it overlooks the water. When you go inside, there's shelves to the left of their blended coffee. I never buy any from any cafe because I have yet to find a place that makes a natural roasted coconut coffee like in Sugar Land at HEB but hey, they gots da coffees here. You'll also notice a huge coffee machine of some sort off to the right, maybe a grinder,  but whatever it is, it's nice to see. You'll also immediately notice their pastries in the front.  The menu lists their coffees and teas but only a hot chai, no cold chai. Disappointment #1. I noticed a bottomless iced coffee. Bingo! No decaf offered with this option. Disappointment #2. I got the bottomless iced tea instead because I didn't need caffeine at 5pm. I got a peach black tea and a blueberry pie. I was handed my pie immediately and told to wait around the corner for my tea. I waited with a nice sized group of people. The employees never announced anything they made so people just waited. Disappointment #3.  I see a cold beverage sitting there and ask the barista, \\"Is this tea?\\"\\n\\"Um...not sure.\\"\\n\\"Ok?...I ordered a tea but I'm not sure if this is mine\\"\\n\\"What did you order exactly? \\"\\n\\"Peach tea.\\"\\n\\"Uh... oh yeah this is it then.\\"\\n\\nOkay,  so why aren't they announcing anything so customers don't grab someone else's drink so they don't have to backstep and make another to replace it? The whole place was noisy so really, there's no excuse. Announcing what is on the table or person's name wouldn't have been a problem. I took my drink and sat down. I took a swig o' tea. Blech! It tasted horribly fake, like pure syrup. I knew this wasn't a naturally brewed peach tea made earlier. I drank it anyway just to get some hydration even though it was pure corn syrup or sugar. I bit into my little blueberry pie and there was no flavor except the flavor of sugar. The blueberries had been so reduced that there was nothing left but death. The crust also had no flavor and seemed like it had sat there all day. My friend got a peanut butter chocolate cake. Nothing special. I think perhaps the peanut butter icing was real but really, a vegan chocolate cake at Central Market tasted better than this. We got through half of it and we threw it out. I went back up to the cashier and asked to try another tea so I could watch how it was made. I watched the guy turn around to the flavors and fill my cup full of syrup. Yep. Knew it. I sat down and realized that nope, I can't drink pure syrup. I asked just for tea only. He gives me black tea even though I noticed flavored teas behind him that looked natural. I paid $3.50 for this syrup tea. The least they could have done was offer a good tea. I sat down to drink. This tea had no flavor other than what tap water tastes like. My friend and I just sat there and tried to find something positive. The most we got was the view. Seems like a cool place if you're doing online gaming or schoolwork but bring your headphones. It's loud. Don't eat the pastry,  don't order the syrup teas either. Okay, maybe the interior is nice too. That's about it. If you want dessert, go somewhere else. $6 for a mini tasteless fruit pie is ridikerous. Never again.\\n\\nThis place has a great opportunity to do better. Put out a table of natural flavored teas for unlimited refills instead of making us stand back in a long line to get another. Offer cold chai, decaf cold coffee and take advantage of Austin's all natural train. I think I'll only come here if I need to stay up on night with bottomless coffee and need an evening alone on the water. Even little snacks would be good that isn't sitting out all day and tasteless.  \\n\\nOnto the next coffee house. This one can be removed from my list but let's break it down.\\n\\nParking - HORRIBLE\\nAtmosphere - A+\\nFood - No. Thank. You.\\nTea - My kidneys and blood sugar died.\\nService - Meh.

A lovely dining room and the chance to observe a legion of chefs at work in the open-plan kitchen will greet you.  \\n\\nIf however you are looking for a welcoming experience, memorable food, and reasonable prices, keep looking.  Craigie on Main \\"knows what's best\\" and you had better do what they say.  Wait patiently. It may be 6 degrees outside; still they will not open their door, even to the vestibule, until 5.30pm.  Order the burger.  You will be told at the front desk that there are only 18 burgers available on any night so put in your order before you are seated. (Sort of a cool early decision plan for food rather than college admission. ) Do as you are told.  The \\"burger\\" does not appear on their menu--if it did, I suppose it would be under the category Manufactured Scarcity--so you will have no idea what you're signing up for or the cost. You will be scorned as a novice if you don't add the requisite fried egg and bacon.  But be grateful for small flavors. The amuse bouche is either a rice cracker with \\"trois gras\\"--I swear that's what they said (I asked twice to be sure that was trois not fois)--or a sardine pave the size of half a postage stamp.  Remember they know best. The oysters will arrive with the chef's choice of sauce already added to each crustacean.  The fried clams will huddle on one side of an otherwise empty plate...looking rather like something that might accompany a ransom note to underline the dire nature of the demands. And do order that rare and famous burger... which turns out to be a cheeseburger. Consistently described as \\"a burger\\" and with no written description provided (\\"it's not on our menu\\"), there was no escape from the cheese. You're lactose intolerant?  Too bad; we know better what you should eat.  \\n\\nMore surprises: the \\"it comes with bacon and a fried egg\\" is actually a supplement billed at $3 per item.  The meat is ground in-house, proven by the inclusion of miniscule bone chips.   There was a lot of laying and taking away of silverware but we still had to wait for appetizer forks and salt.  We were given a \\"time when we will need the table back.\\"  When our server brought dessert menus, and we explained we were on the clock, she appealed the deadline--to no avail.  So wait patiently, do as you're told, leave when they say...but do enjoy the space, the exclusive burger, and their superior sense of what you ought to have ....and you will (or let's say we did) take all this attitude and instruction and pay $150.00 (tip not included) for 2 appetizers, 2 glasses of wine, and 3 burgers.

Awesome.  Pair that with oh, some tender Sliced Pig Ears, Soup Dumplings, crispy Green Onion Pancake, Leek and Egg Pockets, Fried Buns, and Daikon Cake, and you've got yourself set to unbutton your pants.  Don't forget the Spicy Beef Noodle Soup!...better just wear elastic-waisted pants. \\n\\nSo, while the flavors are legit, my main beef with the dishes is that many items are fried instead of pan-seared, as they normally would be (like the Leek & Egg Pockets or Daikon Cakes).  I assume this is to speed-up the cooking process, since the service is notably fast and well, patrons are considerably hungry after waiting outside for 45 minutes (unless they already had an ice cream from McDonald's.  Did I already mention that?).\\n\\nAlso, the service style is that all waitstaff help serve and bus all the tables, so you basically holler out whatever additional items you want to order to whomever happens to pass by your table at the moment.  I'm sure they have some sort of efficient system worked out in the kitchen where they keep track of each table and their orders, and I'm sure it probably works maybe 85% of the time, but the other 15% of the time, a couple of the dishes you ordered might be forgotten.  And so might your drinks.  But at least they'll be friendly about it!\\n\\nOverall, Chung Shin Yuan brings Taiwan to the corner of Watertown and Newton, and, while there are a few quirks here and there, the food is good enough to gain the approval of your Taiwanese in-laws and make them pardon the fact that their ABC daughter-in-law can't cook Asian cuisine worth a lick (speaking of which, don't park at McDonald's, because they'll tow!)."},{"name":"Daedalus Restaurant","address":"45 Mt Auburn St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"One of my favorite roofdecks in the Boston area.

My cousin and I went to there for the first time yesterday. My food was ok. She however did not like the \\"fried chicken\\" because it was soaked in grease. I know because I tasted it for myself. She asked for chicken sausage instead. By the time the sausage came out, she was done with her waffle so she didn't want the sausage. The waitress was very pleasant and told the manager about her dislike for her food. The manager asked what was wrong with the food. She expressed to him her dislike for the chicken and why. His response was, \\"Well it's not to everyone's liking.\\" The waitress gave us our checks and to our surprise, the chicken and the sausage was still on it. The waitress gave her a 10% discount because she cannot take food off. We asked the waitress to get the manager. I saw her talking to him but he never came to the table. We sat there for about 20-30 minutes while I watched him stand around with his hands across his chest or serving other customers. My cousin finally got up to find out how to pay because we were never told where to pay (probably because the waitress was expecting him to come speak to us). We were directed to the counter. She asked the cashier to get the manager but of course she had to ask more than once. He finally came over and after my cousin told him why she requested to speak with him, he said that he'd already taken care of the check in a tone in which I don't think anyone in customer service should speak to a customer. She explained why she didn't feel that she should pay for food that she didn't like or eat and he finally took them off. That left her paying seven dollars for one waffle.

Dude, pull up the Yelp app, there's no way...\\"\\n\\"But it's the top rated restaurant in Boston! We're here anyway, let's just stick around.\\"\\n\\nWe weren't the only ones to have this conversation that night, and I'm pretty sure it's repeated quite often, especially with tourists like us. People passing by stared, laughed, and mocked. It was cold and threatening to rain. But we continued to wait for nearly 2 hours, rocking back and forth on our feet, draining the power on our phones, and sending each other to scout out other nearby places for the occasional snack (such as cannolis from Mike's one block away).\\n\\n2 hours later though, and we were in. And it was WORTH it! We were seated quickly and handed our menus, but with 2 hours to make my menu choices, I already knew what we wanted, save for the menu specials on the left wall that I hadn't seen from outside.\\n\\nFresh burrata with tomatoes to begin (I never, ever say no to burrata - who can?). The calamari (\\"SMALL CAL!\\") with mildly spicy pickled peperoncinis and spicy tomato sauce. House special for two, obviously.\\n\\nThe burrata was extremely fresh, and of all the burrata I've eaten, it ranks pretty high up there. Burrata is made from mozzarella and cream, so it has both that pliable cheesiness and rich creaminess that is so yummy. It was refreshing with the slices of tomato that it was served with.\\n\\nThe calamari was unlike any calamari I've had before; I've never had it with peperoncinis before and now I will probably wish that all of them are supposed to include them. The batter was very seasoned and the tomato sauce was spicy - a must-order!\\n\\nNow, onto the house special. Our tablemates had chosen the ravioli and some kind of spicy pasta, which were both fairly generic choices. I'll bet they were tasty as well, but nevertheless, our tablemates had HUGE menu jealousy when our house special platter holding two lobsters, clams, mussels, shrimp, scallops, and a pile of pasta in spicy lobster sauce was set down.\\n\\nIs it weird that the action of the platter being set down on the table has been on loop in my head for the last few weeks? It was seriously the biggest plate of food I've ever had (esp. for two people only) at a restaurant and I've never had so much fresh seafood.\\n\\nI mean, I've had king crab legs in Las Vegas and garlic-scallion crab in LA, but this is a whole different level of seafood, particularly for the price. At $55 for the house special for two, this is so much cheaper than what it would probably cost in LA -- $55 would probably just get you a single serving with 1/6th of the clams, mussels, shrimp, and scallops, and a few chunks of lobster on a bit of pasta. NOT all of this for two people.\\n\\nIt was as delicious as it looked, and I am so very glad we stuck out the 2 hours to wait. If you are waiting in line and reading this, don't lose hope! Send your friend down the block to pick up some morale-boosting cannolis and you'll be through the door in no time."},{"name":"The Albert","address":"918 Austin Ave","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"The Albert is a great bar.

The beef ribs were meaty and fell off the bone easily with a delicious BBQ sauce to top it off. My husband had a sampler of brisket, sausage and pork ribs. All of which were incredible too.

Giacomo's pasta is definitely good, don't get me wrong, but it's not the same caliber as you might get at other high-end Italian restaurants. And the place is so small that it's super noisy. This is particularly true if you sit next to a group like we sat next to. You know the type, where it seems that each member of the group is competing with each other to see how loud each one of them can laugh, as if laughing loud is somehow a substitute for having something interesting to say. \\n\\nBut Giacomo's is good. What does it have going for it? The atmosphere is very warm and casual. I'm not Italian, but I imagine it's like going to a busy Italian family reunion. The food is, for its quality, pretty cheap. This is a place you could consider eating at every night (if you could stand waiting in line for an hour to eat). So while I would say that purely in terms of quality, Giacomo's would not be able to compete with other high-end Italian restaurants I've been to, it is definitely probably #1 in my mind, or close to it,  for value (i.e. Italian deliciousness per dollar)."},{"name":"Nick's Famous BBQ","address":"2901 Parkway Blvd","city":"Kissimmee","stars":"2.5","text":"Place was near empty when we went in for lunch, so we were a little apprehensive but pleasantly surprised by the great food and friendly service.

This has happened to me at another restaurant before as an honest mistake so I collected all of our receipts, pulled out my phone calculator and did the math. (Just to make sure we undoubtedly had to pay another $15 to our bill.)\\n\\nOur bill was split into 6 so I asked to see the total bill for the table as 1. This was when I noticed that there was an automatic gratuity added to our bill. By the way, isn't it proper server etiquette to let guests know that there would be automatic gratuity? We ended up tipping ~15% each on TOP of that, which I wouldn't have minded doing if I didn't have to spend the next 30 minutes explaining to the waitress and the manager that we did not owe them money.\\n\\nI added up all of our debit receipts; we paid a total of $145 when the entire bill was $129. I showed the waitress and the manager but he shrugged it off and said \\"there's an error with our machine, it doesn't make sense on the receipt but we need you to pay for one more Hat Trick\\". I asked him again if the total bill was indeed for $129 and he said yes, but insisted that the bill isn't accurate and that they \\"go by the item number\\" whatever the hell that means. I even asked for a pen and worked out the math for him on paper. Now if they don't \\"go by the bill\\" then what do they go by? Whatever number he made up in his thick skull? After trying to explain to him that we did not owe them money for about half an hour, he finally says \\"you know what? I don't want to keep you here, I will take it off the bill and you can go home\\". I felt frazzled to say the least and I don't feel in any way that he was apologetic for completely wasting our time.\\n\\nNow if the manager doesn't even understand simple math, then I can't even begin to imagine what else is wrong with his restaurant. I'm not sure if they tried to hustle money out of a group of young adults or if they're really that ignorant, but I feel that both the manager and waitress need more training or at least a few math lessons.\\n\\nThe food was good, so 1 star for that, but wasting my time and energy to teach basic math to a grown man is not how I want to be spending my Sunday nights."},{"name":"Giacomo's Ristorante - Boston","address":"355 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"My mom came to visit me in Boston last week and she wanted some good Italian food.

To those who knew the former space (Honey's) and liked it, you will be happy to know that a few of the former breakfast items (particularly the skillets - very good) have remained on the menu.

Organic lean beef served on a gazillion grain bun - as a burger goes, it is about as healthy as you can be and I must admit that it wasn't bad for a lean burger.  The standard sandwich/burger side is the homemade sweet potato chips and they are delicious.  My wife chose the salmon and was very happy with her flavorful and not too cooked but not too rare entree.  So 3.5 stars for the food.  Honestly, to me, the best aspect of Kasan Red was the service (particularly if Roberto is your server - he also works nights at La Casita and is one of the best in the area - seriously, the entire region ).

Boy was I glad I did!  I walked up to the restaurant to find a line.  The wait on a Sunday night at 7:30pm was 30-45 minutes, not too bad.  Since there was two of us, I decided to head over to Mike's pastries and grab a couple cannolis to go (since they don't serve dessert at Giacomo's) while the other stayed in line.  I returned after about 15 mintues, and what do you know, we were seated right when I returned.  Perfect timing!  All parties before us had three or more people, so it's a plus to not come with a larger group.\\n\\nWe started off with the caprese salad with bufala mozarella, fresh tomato, basil and virgin oil ($9).  You could tell the mozarella was homemade, and everything tasted fresh and delicious.  For the main course I ordered one of their specials of the night...a green, spirally pasta with creamy pesto sauce, shrimp, and lobster ($20).  So DELICIOUS!  The pesto sauce wasn't too heavy and there was a generous portion of shrimp and lobster.  Nom nom nom!

Water, Pepsi, iced tea and a milkshake. Another 10 minutes later, drinks arrive . The Milkshake was a mess running over the glass and we asked for a wet cloth to clean it up so the child could even pick it up . Wet ones arrived and were not helpful .

At this point we complained about the service to a manager serving our meals. Our server was standing behind us and heard our complaints. The manager apologized and did offer us 2 free desserts to Take HOME. There were 4 adults and 2 kids. Interesting offer .

Chef provides us with some small bites and samples which were all truly amazing. Very friendly people and great environment\\n\\nDrinks:\\nTalk about a proper drink in Boston. This isn't your basic bar these folks know what they are doing. Cocktails are roughly 11-14$ but are actually made properly.

They are super fatty and a melt in you mouth texture with an Asian fusion sauce topped with hand battered onion rings. These were the true star and would come back for these alone.  The burger that everyone raves about is fairly good I would rate it 8.5/10 as it was heavy on the pepper but had a nice meat blend and a lot of hand crafted components.  We didn't try any of the entrees as they are priced fairly high but the burger is only 18$ which is good consider its quality of components.

There is a reason why The Salt Lick has been shown on a number of television programs including the Travel Channel and Food Network.  There is a reason why you'll always find this place packed regardless of when you go.  There is a reason why people travel to the middle of nowhere (sorry Driftwood) to eat.  Everything about this place screams Texas BBQ...the ranch like setting, the open fire pit, and cabin like environment and the food won't disappoint either.  \\n\\nThe BBQ here is amazing, especially the ribs!  When I come here, my friends/family and I generally do \\"family style\\" (~$19/adult, $5/kids 11 and under) where they will bring you plates of sausage, brisket, and ribs until you throw in the towel.  Sides of coleslaw, potato salad, bread, pinto beans, and pickles & onions will also be served.  I can't even begin to describe how delicious the food is, it's something you simply must experience.  I generally don't care much for coleslaw but the one they make here is not bad at all.  They use a vinaigrette instead of mayo and it's pretty good.  Potato salad is awesome as well, it has a bit of a smoky, peppery flavor and no mayo again so it's different yet still delicious.  Driftwood is also a dry county so feel free to bring a cooler with your favorite libations into the restaurant since it's BYOB, this is especially useful when there's a longer wait list.  \\n\\nFinally, if you manage to have room left then definitely get the peach cobbler.

Aside from the glowing recommendations, my ulterior motive for going to here was due the name \\"Sweetish,\\" which as a play on words for Swedish, reminded of a crush I had on a certain Swedish girl I knew.  So... I had some pretty high expectations. I expected a lot of things, which after thinking about the experience, made me question the validity of using Sweetish Hill in this crush chasing exercise. \\n\\nHowever, I've realized that while my ulterior motives took me to this bakery, it's likely that people choose restaurants all the time for reasons aside from recommendations on food quality. \\n\\nWe chose to walk to Sweetish Hill as its only half a mile from my apartment.  While the website noted the address of 1104 W. 6th, it turned out that the real location was closer to 1111 W. 6th.  I was frustrated that I had to call the bakery and ask them for directions, and wished at the time that I had a GPS device to autopilot myself to the correct location.  While having an implanted GPS system is not currently feasible, it points to the need of more less bulky / more pedestrian friendly GPS systems. While a simpler option would have been for me to call ahead and confirm the directions, that just seemed like too much effort.  \\n\\nAfter calling in for directions and learning that we were pretty much staring at the restaurant (not the best signage) we quickly found our way through the front doors. I was expecting a bakery more European styled. Instead, we were greeted with an eclectic-styled bakery; Austin meets Amsterdam.  The counter area was typical of a bakery in that all the pastries and breads were neatly arranged in a glass shelf beneath the wall-to-wall countertop.  I was in awe from the sweets in front of me, but overloaded by the equally impressive selection of bagels/bialys, soups on wall shelves, and the hot foods listed on the menu attached to the wall.  There was too much in front of me to absorb.  I must have scanned from bagels to soups to breads and back again at least 5 times.    I finally chose a simple cheese and cherry Danish pastry, but I'm sure that if the menu items were organized more neatly, I would have ordered something more intricate - and thus more expensive. \\n\\nWalking with plates and juice and coffees in hand, we proceeded to look for patio seating under the sun.   Again, I had the same experience of too many things going on.  I wanted to find a sunny table, but with everything about to fall from my hands (no service trays), I had to find the nearest table.  A table that turned out to be in the shade and nowhere near the sun.  In fact, for such an outdoor friendly place, I was very surprised to see that a majority of the outdoor tables were under the shade of the trees.  Only two tables were exposed to the sun.  Why not place some more tables in that area? It's springtime; everyone likes the sun, right? I don't know why, but I felt less impressed with the bakery for the lack of \\"sunny tables.\\" \\n\\nWhen we finally situated ourselves, we decided to relocate to an outer-table due to the beautiful weather.  After managing not to spill drinks and food on neighboring tables, we sat down to enjoy our food.  Everything that turned me off about Sweetish Hill disappeared the moment I took my first bite.  I was actually upset.  I was upset that it took me so long to find such an amazing pastry in Austin.  \\n\\nThe breakfast I had at Sweetish Hill was amazing.  In fact, it reminded me a lot of the sidewalk cafes in Europe - big taste, small portions and small coffees.  What's weird is that I've never had an issue with smaller portions in Europe, but here in Austin I was disappointed at the lack of volume in my breakfast. \\n\\nThough, I still wanted more on my plate - even though I probably would have eaten the same.  I think its crazy that so many of us have come to expect mega-size meals everywhere we go.   While I'm not a fan of charging customers $50 for a fashionable plate of 1 asparagus, I do like the idea of restaurants charging less for serving smaller portions.  In fact, I think this counter-culture could actually increase a restaurants business as more and more people are seeking healthier lifestyles. \\n\\nAnyhow, I found the service and the food to be amazing.  Outside of that, I was disappointed that not as much attention was paid to outdoor seating, menu iitemizing and tray options. These were small things, but large enough to influence my overall experience at the bakery.  When I see an outdoor gourmet bakery, I guess I expect a lot more than I would of any normal restaurant.  I want an experience; a little slice of the day where I can escape and drift off somewhere away from here.  Sweetish Hill kind of does that for me.  All in all, I'm a happy guy with a new favorite bakery."},{"name":"The Salt Lick BBQ","address":"18300 Fm 1826","city":"Driftwood","stars":"4","text":"Yes, it is all that.

Caprese was just average. \\n\\nPrimi:PAPPARDELLE ALLA BOLOGNESE - dat sauce doe - it slays. Best dish of the night. The Gnocchi Amatricana left something to be desired as far as flavor goes.

We had to pause on the wine otherwise we wouldn't have had any to sip with the meal. \\n\\nThat being said, it wasn't even worth the wait. Chicken of the Pollo Marsala wasn't cooked evenly.

So you get the well-appointed interiors, the rich woods, the faux European advertising posters on the wall, and the jacked-up prices to match.  These trappings of smugness and superiority are like mother's milk to the desperately hip.\\n\\nOf course, if you go to the real thing in Europe, what you'll usually find is a casual, unassuming neighborhood joint.  That's the feel that Simplicity reaches for and mostly achieves.\\n\\nNo one is trying to impress you with the decorating budget.  The cavernous and somewhat industrial-looking dining area is pretty spartan except for the occasional painting or mirror on the wall.  The furniture mostly doesn't match.  This no-frills look extends to the outdoor patio in front.  It's all very laid back.\\n\\nSimplicity's green approach also contributes to the informality.  Everything is served in compostable containers.  The utensil options range from chopsticks to the little flat wooden spoons (?) you used to get with your single-serve ice cream - i.e., nothing metal that has to go through a dishwasher.  Depending on what you're eating, that can be a bit of a hassle (if you have arthritis, you're just better off bringing a fork from home).    \\n\\nAs I said, there is a place for this style of wine/tapas bar in Austin.  I'm sure there are plenty of people who would like to hang out over a glass of grape and some small plates in a very casual atmosphere and not pay a huge markup (the wines range from $3.50 to $8 per glass and the plates are all $5).  And there must be many people who want to throw their dining-out business to places with a genuine commitment to the environment.  With 200 seats at Simplicity, there's ample room to accommodate this crowd.  If going to a wine or tapas bar is as much an affectation as a meal for you, go elsewhere - there are plenty of alternatives in Austin that will meet your striving needs.\\n\\nSo why only 3 stars?  The food, as many others have noted, is nothing special, and all the concept, environmental friendliness, and low pricing in the world is not going to get me to return if I don't really love what I'm eating.  The crab croquetas and tortilla espanola were probably the best things I ate, and they were just okay.  If there was any chipotle in the chipotle glazed sweet potatoes, I missed it.  The \\"buffalo style\\" calamari was a mistake.  I was really surprised at the so-so quality given that Simplicity is the brainchild of the team at Restaurant Jezebel, one of the best restaurants in Austin.  Maybe there are better options that I didn't try, but don't give me the \\"you get what you pay for\\" line.  Cheap food does not have to be mediocre.\\n\\nAnd, oddly, the green approach does not translate to the wine list, which is mostly comprised of bottles that had to cross an ocean to get here.  On the by-the-glass list, I counted only 4 domestics out of 24 options.  The bottle lists had similar ratios.  I would have preferred to see more California and Texas wines available.\\n\\nI'm intrigued enough that I will probably give Simplicity another chance when the menu changes and cross my fingers for some better food."},{"name":"Pino's Pizza","address":"1920 Beacon St","city":"Brighton","stars":"4","text":"Great place, great food.

When I took the first glass I realized it had a piece of tomato in it attached to the glass itself. I told the waitress to wait bc the glass was dirty... she looked at me annoyed and said \\"ok I change it\\"... no apologies just pure annoyance that I made her go an get another glass. When she started walking to get a clean glass I checked the other one she had just poured. It had somebody's lips and lip marks or lipstick on it. I said seriously?? I called her back inmediatly and said \\"this one is dirty too!! It has lipmarks!!!  She then more annoyed than ever took the other glass and left. I feel unconfortable with this waitress attitude let alone level of paying attention to details such a clean utensils for people to eat (seriously!!! Come on!!!) and decided to speak to the manager (owner?). When I went to see him I requested a new waitress to what he responded \\"we can not change her\\" he then asked why to which I responded I didnt like her attitute.

It's in the heart of Inman Park, away from L5P, and is an \\"it\\" place. (I've seen a couple of reality TV shows shot in the area and the glitterati of ATL come here from time to time.) Yet the crowd has a good mix of folks so you will not feel out of place, whenever you come.\\n\\nFor starters, it's a tapas bar. Small Spanish style appetizers dominate the menu. This weekend, we went and had a couple of favorites: Patatas Bravas -- roasted potatoes with a red tomato based and aoli sauce. Normally, the Hangar Steak is a favorite, but this time we ordered a Braised Rib Short Hash. That was extremely tasty.  The Patatas were perfectly roasted and the sauce is just smoky genius. (In the past, I've also ordered the empanadas and the 3 cheese place. Stick with Manchego and the fig jelly, you cannot go wrong.)\\n\\nThe Bar is excellent. You can count on a variety of top shelf liquor and well made drinks.\\n\\nBut what sets this place apart, and I'm sure others will agree, is the service.

Even though we had a 30 minute wait for dinner on a Thursday night, my colleague and I passed the time by drinking our BYOB beers and listening to the live music.  The interior was also great and the smells that emanate from the open pit at the center of the restaurant are out of this world.  I ordered the largest plate there was, turkey, ribs, brisket, sausage, and three sides along with complimentary bread, pickles, and onions.  All the meats were great, likely the best I've ever had.  However, the ribs were unbelievable, clearly the best I've ever had.  I'm no BBQ connoisseur, but I've been to some decent east coast BBQ joints like Dinosaur BB.  However, I recognize that saying that is probably equivalent to someone from the Midwest saying they've been to some decent Midwestern pizza parlors.  The ribs at Salt Lick were amazing; they had the right amount of smoke, not so fall of your bone meat, and sauce.  \\n\\nThe other great part of the restaurant was the drive there.

Anyway, granted I've only been to Brass Union once, but first of all, I don't think they changed it up that much.  The space looks relatively the same with the exception of the games and the new bathrooms.  The food is good, but waaaay over priced.  We had three, count 'em, THREE chicken wings for $9.  Does anyone else out there think that's a little outrageous?  The games seem like they would be fun and I'm definitely interested in checking those out, but other than that, I don't know that Brass Union would be on the top of my list for awesome bars in the area.

I guess the story is that the owners went to Naples and studied pizza until they perfected their technique and then they brought three ovens back with them.  More on that later.\\n\\nEverything about this place is great.  There is no \\"dining room\\", per se.  All of the seating is scattered around a giant \\"kitchen\\", so you're right in between all of the ovens and sinks and sacks of flour.  The actual process of seating is kind of a free-for-all and can get messy, but there are just enough seats that open up at the right times to prevent chaos from breaking out.\\n\\nThe real star here, of course, is the pizza.  Oh god, the pizza.  I had the Diavola (spicy, spicy, spicy) and the San Gennaro (sausage and sweet, sweet peppers).  Both were incredible.  The crust is chewy and has just the right flavor, the sauce is delicious and not too sweet, and the cheese is simply awesome.  The sausage and sweet peppers on the San Gennaro were both crazy delicious.  I wish I could eat that combo every day.  Some people complain about \\"burnt\\" crust, but dammit, it's wood-fired pizza.  What the hell do you expect?  The burnt parts are what makes it so good!  To the contrary, I thought the crust at the center of the pizza was a little thin and got soggy, making the cheese and toppings fall off when I tried to pick up the slices.  It was nothing a little finger-picking couldn't fix, though.\\n\\nAnyways, despite being a guy from Chicago who firmly believes that our stuffed pizza is the end-all-be-all, I can appreciate the different styles and Antico is right up there at the top of theirs.  \\n\\nHighly recommended for in between courses of fried chicken and shrimp and grits."},{"name":"MADdogs Gourmet Hot Dogs","address":"1900 NE 162nd Ave, Ste D114","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Who knew hotdogs could be so much fun and yummy!

We were not sure what to make of a battered and fried burger but, it was delightful.  I think it was the garlic mayo, chutney and bakery style bun that really made it great.

I have fantastic memories of this place that go back decades. But, today? Uff-da. It has gone from being a family bbq joint to being a tourist attraction. Their focus now is volume, and that's a shame. So, just the facts, trying to be nice.\\n\\nOrdered two pounds of moist brisket and half a chicken for takeaway; total bill with tax was $54.81. \\n\\nThe chicken was not good. The thigh was okay, the leg was dry, and the breast was like sawdust. The skin was rubbery, its rub was mostly sugar, and, despite having what appeared to be a bark, there was no smoke ring. The leftover breast is gonna get chopped up for chicken salad, but I don't have high hopes. ($6.95)\\n\\nThe brisket was a mixed experience. I ordered moist; I got what appeared to be cutter's choice. Some of it was moist side, some of it was tips, and some of it was lean (flat). The lean was tough and very dry. The moist had been cooked at too high a heat and not long enough; the fat wasn't rendered much at all, and hadn't absorbed much smoke, so it was just kinda chewy. The tips were tasty -- c'mon, you can't mess up tips -- and were the only part we finished. I mean, look, it's difficult for me to judge brisket too harshly, since, I LOVE BRISKET. Even when it's super-dry flat, a good sauce can make it into a reasonable sandwich. Nothing, however, would save this lean; it's in the fridge and we're not sure what to do with it. Maybe a stew? The moist re-heated okay, but it's also destined for sandwiches; it's just too tough to eat unchopped. The rub is good but not great; the bark was okay, except on the moist where the flavor was overwhelmed by the texture of stringy fat. Disappointing. ($43.80 or $21.90/lb)\\n\\nThe free sides were a little mysterious. Texas bbq joints serve pickle chips and onion slices; I don't know about other states, but here it's standard, expected. When you get bbq, you get sauce, pickles and onions. My receipt reads \\"1 FREE 1/4PT SAUCE, 1 FREE 1/2PT SAUCE, 3 FREE PICKL ONION.\\" What that meant was a 16oz container of thick, vinegary sauce (it's okay, but not great -- and really sweet), and a little styrofoam tub of odd mini pickle spears and a quarter of an onion, root and all. I didn't ask for bread because this is Texas and when you order brisket, you get bread. I didn't get bread. My bad, I guess. But the pickles and quarter-onion were... hm. \\n\\nI first went to the Salt Lick about thirty years ago. My family has been going there on a less- and less-frequent basis in the last few years. It used to be the stuff of legend. It's unfortunate that I can't really see myself going back. Again, it's not bad; it's just... okay.

I vividly remember the truck's former owner, Thomas, and eating its food many, many times in 2011 and 2012, but hadn't seen the truck out much since he sold it or, as far as I can remember, tried any of the new owners' food. I saw the truck at the food truck event in Longwood a few days ago and gave it an overdue visit.\\n\\nThomas' hamburgers were among the best in Orlando, and I was hoping that the new owners would be able to follow suit. They did! I chose the All-American hamburger, which had bacon, Swiss cheese, lettuce and tomato on it. It was great! There were a few other tempting burger choices on the menu, but I kept it simple. I might go for something a little bit more adventurous next time. I haven't had many hamburgers lately, but this one definitely was the best one I've recently had and I definitely would have it again. I think that it was $8, which is fair. I also had an order of the fried Oreos (I couldn't resist), which were $3 (for three cookies). They were very, very good, though didn't seem to have as much powdered sugar as I was expecting. Thomas used to include a lot of that stuff. I'm not going to nitpick, though. Everything was excellent.\\n\\nThe new owners are very friendly and I hope that their business is doing well. I already am looking forward to stopping by again. It looks like the truck has retained at least several of the most popular items (\\"Luther\\" burger, fried peanut butter and jelly, fried Oreos, etc.) from Thomas' days, which is good to see. I really wanted to get the fried peanut butter and jelly sandwich when I was here on Monday ... I've had it in the past and it's amazing. Maybe I will get it next time.\\n\\nI still am rating this truck as 5 stars and will continue to do so until I have a bad experience.

After driving by Cibo e Beve multiple times wondering what it was like, I was so grateful to finally get a chance to dine here with a big group of girls for Galentine's Day! Organized by the lovely Mish K., I felt like I was a hip diner-in-the-know about this gem of a spot!\\n\\nChef Linda has developed a menu to satisfy all palates, people, and preferences! Everything looked so good, I didn't know where to start! Luckily a few return guests guided us in the right direction. Sitting at the chef's table, we were able to see all the plating action, dish preparation, and finishing touches. What was really neat was that they even had a bar at the window so you could sit and eat while checking out everyone else's noms! The overall ambiance is relaxed and romantic without feeling squished in (even though it is a smaller space). The bar area has tons of bottle and specialty cocktails to choose from and has a wrap around seating area that has full menu service. \\n\\nOur waiter Ryan was fantastic!! He walked us through all the specials, classic dishes, and recommended cocktails for us. I got their take on a Moscow Mule and it was delicious! They even make their own ginger beer in house and man could you tell it was fresh! Ryan made sure all of us felt at home and was happy to encourage us to relax and take our time, he would always be around when needed. For such a large group, it was awesome feeling like you had the attention often given to smaller parties. \\n\\nFor appetizers we started with the meatballs, crispy brussels, and housemade burrata cheese. Everything was so good! I have to say the crispy brussels were my favorite. They had a great texture with smoky flavor from a little char and bacon mixed in. The fried egg on top helped add some creamy notes and brightened the dish to make it perfectly savory and satisfying. Next were the meatballs. They come three to an order and are covered in a fresh, lightly seasoned red sauce. The sauce was so good, I was eating it with a spoon once the meatballs were gone! Finally, the famous burrata cheese. Chef Linda makes it a little differently each time - on our visit it had a roasted red pepper coulis drizzled on top with juicy veggies on the bottom (catching all that yummy cheese once we popped them open!). Some of the diners preferred the balsamic reduction over the last one which sounds right up my alley.\\n\\nFor dinner, I chose to try the pasta carbonara. Fresh tagliatelle pasta was coated with parmesan, cream, and had peas with Nueske's bacon mixed it. It was plated beautifully with a cracked raw egg on top that I could mix in. Ryan brought out extra parmesan and red pepper flakes to top it with and I couldn't wait to dig in! The pasta was creamy without being overly rich and was a perfect portion for dinner. Definitely a member of the clean plate club on this one! The only thing I probably would have changed would be to have fresh parmesan grated over it rather than the powder style spooned but that's because I'm a cheese addict who could grate the entire block if they would let me.\\n\\nFinally, the pi√®ce de r√©sistance! Chef Linda brought out a platter (yes, a PLATTER) of her famous gelato pie and chocolate semifreddo for us to dig into. It was the perfect temperature to be firm when you cut a piece off but melt in your mouth the instant you ate it. Chocolate oreo crust, coffee and vanilla ice cream, indulgent fudge, and yummy sour cherries took this dessert over the top. Thank goodness I don't live closer, otherwise I'd be eating it everyday.\\n\\nRyan, Chef Linda, and the whole Cibo e Beve crew were fantastic. From the bar manager checking in on how our drinks were doing to the delicious food that we were all able to sample and share, I had a wonderful girls dinner with the group!

It was pouring ran and we ran in the the nearest building for cover. Not letting up anytime soon we put out name on the waitlist. On a weekend afternoon, pouring rain, the wait was very long. But the food and overall experience was so good that first time, despite the wait, that we have been back many times.

You can call the restaurant or use the Open Table App. If they are busy you can still wait or do open seating at the bar. Weekday evenings you can usually be seated pretty quickly.\\n\\nOnce you get in, you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. We've have tried numerous dishes which have all been cooked perfectly and tasted great. We have brought out of town guests, including a gluten free family member, who were all happy with their meals. \\n\\nIn particular, we like the Dalkey Duo to start. Fish and Chips is a can't miss but the bangers & mash is also a classic. Pork chop or pot roast also quite good if you want something a meaty. Dessert is also very tasty, if you have any room left in your happy belly. Bread pudding is the star here, but there are quite a few others to pick form.\\n\\nOne added bonus to this place is the atmosphere. It is beautifully decorated, to the nines, as you would expect from anything Disney does. The lighting, sounds, smells all add to the Irish Pub feel. Add to that the fabulous live entertainment and you will find yourself lingering after you've eaten. Some nights there are Irish dancers, live bands, or other entertainment on the stage.\\n\\nA special treat is to come for a drink and dessert at the big bar, while you watch some great performers on the stage.

My dad had been taken out for the lunch buffet for his birthday by his coworkers, and apparently he found it so appealing, he wanted to share the experience with the rest of us. \\n\\nHere's where I'd normally break in the review and relay some amusing personal stories about someone or something Persian that I've experienced. I don't think I have a lot this go-around. Let's see...I knew a Persian guy in law school whose last name actually *was* Alborz; he ended up driving me home after a party in which my fellow law students did shots of contraband British absinthe and got completely naked (Cf. the case of Nathan v. Are These People For Real, 2006 Houston District Court of What The F**k); one of my friends of a friend is married to this gorgeous Persian man, and I'm sort of pissy about it; and finally, I had an undergraduate Persian political science professor whose family were friends of the Shah back in the day and who adored anything and everything I said because I never failed to compliment her fabulous Chanel and Hermes scarves. Huh. Looks I did have a few things to say after all.\\n\\nWe were greeted and seated immediately, and our waitress brought around menus. I already knew I wanted the buffet, but I didn't think it would hurt to take a gander at the menu selections. I know it says it's Persian cuisine, which is pretty much the same as Middle Eastern cuisine, except geographically emerges just a tiny bit up and to the east. Otherwise the hummus, dholmas, and tabouli are all the same thing. That country singer who actually admits he doesn't know the \\"difference in Iraq and Iran\\" probably wouldn't, if he judged it based on cuisine alone. In his case, though, I think he's probably just an ignorant redneck who thinks Jesus won a Purple Heart fighting in World War II. \\n\\nJust a note: the default iced tea is a black raspberry, which I found to be refreshing...I just didn't want anyone to be surprised.\\n\\nThe buffet is $13.99 a person. I began with the leg of lamb that was fork tender and delicious. My sides included Persian macaroni (which tasted an awful lot like regular spaghetti, except the meat was the drier Middle Eastern kind; still great, though); a decent tabouli salad; and my favorite, the basmati rice with dill. I noticed my brother's chicken leg was meaty and fell right off the bone. I appreciated the array of vegetarian options, including a vegetable stew I enjoyed. All in all, a strong buffet selection of all the usual favorites. Noticeably absent? The stuffed grape leaves. You can order them a la carte, but I would have liked to have them as a buffet item. Oh, well. \\n\\nMy dad didn't re-order anything as he was still full from lunch (I wondered how he'd be able to pull off eating there twice in one day), but for his birthday they brought him out a piece of baklava, which I thought was so appropo. \\n\\nThe place could have used louder background music. It was a little too quiet for my taste. Pop in any kind of Persian instrumental, and I think they'd solve the problem. \\n\\nOn the way out, I noticed they offer belly dancing lessons. The place isn't that large, so I tried to imagine these random American women awkwardly popping their hips around the buffet table in silk veils. In any event, I wouldn't be opposed to taking belly dancing lessons if 1.) They actually let guys do it; and 2.) It was in a secure, undisclosed dance studio where I could look like an uncoordinated fool, and not in front of people eating their dinner. \\n\\nI'll give it 3 1/2 stars--and what the hell--round it up to 4."},{"name":"Yasu","address":"1366 Beacon St","city":"Brookline","stars":"3","text":"Fairly decent Korean place.

Sometimes you do, but sometimes you don't. I'm leaning on the 'don't' side. I measure a dining establishment as the sum of its parts. Food, portions, atmosphere. When two of these variables falls below expectations even though one may excel, the full experience just doesn't make it worth it to go out of your way to go back. The food here was good, but the portions were small for the price, and the atmosphere cold and uninviting. \\n\\nThey have a really small menu, although their website may suggest otherwise. They just don't prepare everything for every day.

I ended up ordering the Nasi Kapau and their beef white curry.  \\nThe flavors are reminiscent of Thai, Vietnamese and Cambodian flavors, of which I am a supreme fan.

Like I have mentioned before, out of all Asian restaurants, I think Thai are the most polite. Anyway, I ordered the crispy pad thai and I wished I didn't. To me, it tasted like uncooked ramyun mixed with chicken and whatever is added on to pad thai. At least the chicken satay that I ordered was good...it was huge and delicious. Price was pretty good...not expensive at all. \\n\\nI want to be fair because the other dishes that my friends ordered looked delicious.

I'd never been and she spoke fondly of the clam chowder.\\n\\nWe were seated right away. It's a cozy place though the lighting above the booths was brighter than expected for the space and started to irritate the both of us after a while. You could say it was a slower night; there were three or four booths filled and the bar area was empty.\\n\\nIt took a while for our server to take our drink and food orders which was perplexing because the place wasn't packed. I ordered the scallop carbonara with a cup of clam chowder. I was hoping to try the corn chowder but, for some reason, it was only served on Friday and Saturday nights. Weird, right?\\n\\nThe pinot noir we ordered was decent (though a little pricier than I was expecting). The chowder was very good. \\n\\nWhat killed this place for me was the entree and the service before/after we received our food. After we ordered our entrees, it took a good forty minutes to get them. For a smaller restaurant that's simply unacceptable. And the \\"carbonara\\" sauce felt like butter-and-cheese-flavored concrete. It had a very strange texture and sat like a stone in my stomach for hours after only a couple of bites. I was also not a fan of the pea pods in the mix instead of using actual peas; they were out of place and did not mix well with the horrible sauce.

We arrived a few minutes early and went to the bar for a glass of wine. The bar area is very nice. It is large and airy. A place where you feel comfortable sipping on a drink and relaxing. In addition to the bar there are dining tables in this area. The atmosphere would seem more casual than in the main dining room. The main dining room was very elegant. My only complain on it was it was louder than I would have liked and the tables were just a bit too close together. \\n\\nWe had a wonderful bottle of wine. I like wine but am not knowledgeable on Italian wines. The wine list is extensive (and does have American wines) and ranges from $30 to many hundreds. We went with the wine I had ordered by the glass at the bar; a Super Tuscan 2005 IL Borro for a reasonable $59 a bottle. This was a very enjoyable wine. \\n\\nFor appetizers, Alayne had the Eggplant Parmigiana and I had the fresh Italian buffalo milk mozzarella, tomatoes, arugula salad. I tried the eggplant and it was very good. Mine was outstanding. The mozzarella was very flavorful and the tomatoes were perfect. \\n\\nFor our entrees I had the seafood risotto. I was a little disappointed. It was good but not great. Hardly any shrimp and just not as flavorful as I expected. Next time I am going to try the Rack of Lamb (that was my second choice). Alayne had the bow tie pasta with lump crab meat. She seemed to really enjoy it. I also had a few bites of the grilled swordfish and that was terrific. Of the three entrees I tasted it was the best. The seasoning was perfect. \\n\\nOne other thing I should mention on the entrees. Most are available is appetizer portion size. Such a wonderful idea, especially if you are not a person who eats large meals. Save some money and not waste any food or have to take the rest home. \\n\\nAnd I know you are thinking, Did you have dessert? Well of course. We split the Capri Island chocolate cake. A rich brownie like cake with ice cream. Very good. Glad we shared it. \\n\\nService was a little slow but not where it influenced my enjoyment of dining there. There was a slight error on the bill and they corrected it quickly. \\n\\nSome reviewers have commented on the prices but I disagree when compared to other nice places (This isn't Olive Garden thank god!).  Most entrees are between $20 - $30 (under $20 for appetizer portion). Add appetizers, dessert and wine and the bill adds up but no more than others. This isn't a place I will come to all the time, but when I want a real nice Tuscan meal, I will return.

Oh, and lol - the table of three young bros next to us ordered the seafood tower - and hot damn, that's a mountain of lobster, shrimp, oysters, and heaven - if you have the dollar bills, it looked insannnne (though points of for presentation as the boys literally had to stand up to reach the top of their cornucopia of raw bar treats) \\n\\nWe moved onto some effing banging ceviche - went for the wahoo w salsa verde (mild fish with a soft but pleasantly firm texture - dish was slightly over salted for me) - and the fluke crudo w pickled nectarine, lemon verbena, aleppo - hot damn - I'm not usually one to mix fruit with my savories, but the lightly tart nect + buttery fluke was just divine - was also tempted by the mahi crudo w aji/cilantro and salmon crudo w creme fraiche, scallion, and harissa, but sadly, I am but a mortal and knew that my tum wouldn't accommodate anymore raw goodness and be able to make it rain on the rest of our meal.\\n\\nWe ended w the snap pea salad (ricotta salata, lemon), salmon pastrami (toast, pickles, creme fraiche), and crispy calamari w jalapenos - all were delish, but the calamari was melt-in-your-mouth tender - absent of all hints of chewiness that make one stop and think \\"hold up, is that this pig's anus masquerading as calamari that NPR so desperately warned me abt last year?\\" - a must order. \\n\\nI can't tell you how many lobster rolls ($29) I saw pass by - sure, it's steep for a sando - but, there was a bounty of that succulent meat nestled btwn those buns and I saw no sad faces on those around us who'd chosen to nosh on that. Fish and chips also looked solid, as did the ME crab cake, roasted striped bass, and daily whole fish - oh, and if you're not into the sea, they have the obligatory burger, a steak, and a chicken dish - but like, why bother - just go elsewhere. Nevertheless, Vegetarians could easily make a meal of many of their starters/sides and have zero regrets.\\n\\nSkipped dessert - butterscotch pudding, whoopie pies, strawbs + cream, something else - nothing decadent enough to make my panties drop. \\n\\nService was a bit absent and weird - to be fair, they only had two waitresses for all the patio tables, but even had our gal had more help, she didn't bring her A game to work last night. Not bad enough to turn me off, but just a bit slow/not useful.\\n\\nCrudos are $12-15, smoked/cured is $10-11, starters are $9-15, fried stuff is around $15, mains are mid-high 20s, and sides are $8 - which might be a dollar too much, though the portions are generally appropriate. Din for two ladies was $135 (incl 3 glasses of wine) - and I think it could be done for $50/pp, depending on what life choices you make.\\n\\nOverall, despite their best attempts to keep me out, Row 34 has now found a new regular.

I really like it there. I have two reasons for giving it 4 stars instead of 5:\\n\\n1. They generally have VERY slow service. Now, this is partially because they are careful about the making of your drinks/sandwiches/etc, but also partially from inefficiency. It's not a big deal if there are very few people in line or waiting for their food, but it's hell if you're there at the lunch rush. I've waited 45 minutes before for a sandwich, which is absurd, no matter how good it is. \\n\\n2. The price. They are a little on the pricy side for a bakery/sandwich shop. Don't get me wrong, they do make incredibly good food, but if you get, say, a sandwich/stuffed bread, a hot drink and a pastery, it can easily be $15 just for lunch.\\n\\nWords of advice: \\n\\nDO NOT go there between about Noon to 1:15pm on a weekday. You get all the business-people of the nearby area and all of the children's museum lunchers. If you go even a little before this time, or a little after, you'll be fine, but don't go then!\\n\\nTry to go in the morning - they have a really large selection of pasteries and other goodies, but between the morning coffee people and the lunch people, a lot of the good stuff can be sold out by the afternoon.\\n\\nThings to try:\\n\\nThe oatmeal (served until 11am) - good oats, candied nuts, carmelized apple chunks and raisins, which you can augment with honey, brown sugar, or other good things. They mix it up with the addons fresh for you, so you can easily ask them to leave a part out of you don't like it.\\n\\nThe oreos - crispy chocolate cookies with a fresh tasy cream inside. \\n\\nThe banana bread - a little tiny bit on the oily side, and has nuts, but incredibly flavorful and tasty. \\n\\nThe hot chocolate - they use a nice semi-sweet concoction, so you get the chocolate taste and sweetness without it being overly sugary.\\n\\nThe stuffed bread - a calzone style heated pocket. They change what type it is everyday, but it usually has a mix of meat, potatoes/rice, vegtables and a sauce.\\n\\nThe lemon-raspberry cake - it comes in a small, round single-serving size, or also as a larger cake.

What an experience! Best Italian food I have ever had! I had the Lobster Ravioli, and just wow! The ravioli were so delicious with fresh lobster meat with a very subtle filling. The garlic cream sauce was phenomenal. My friend waited until I was done with my ravioli and then scraped the rest into her chicken ziti! I am not a tomato sauce person, but the tomato sauce on her ziti was really good! Most of the pasta dishes are really large, so you will pay about $16 a plate, but you will have left overs! Now, here are the things you need to know. Number one, this place is crazy busy and crowded. We got there at 4:20 when they opened at 4:30 and there was already a line. We left at 5:10 and the line was about 15 people deep. And it was a gross night with snow and rain. So if you decide to experience this fantastic place, you better come for an early dinner and get there before the doors open. Number two, it is super fast paced here. It's a neat environment, considering the kitchen is right there and they are communicating the entire time. But if you have a bunch of bags after shopping or a stroller, this place may not be possible. Number three, they are going petal to the metal the whole night.

It was yum but not too happy paying 18 dollars for less than 2 dollars worth of lettuce...The steak was very flavorful but needed a side of potatos or starch to accompany it.  My girlfriend raved about the octopus appetizer, but i thought it looked a little scary.  She thought the sea bass was just average for its priciness.

Not bad! The steaks are seared at a magical temp and served with butter which, if you read the propaganda, makes this the best steak IN THE WORLD! In reality it's just a really good steak. The quality of the meat is unquestionable and the cuts are excellent, I just wasn't 100% convinced that the butter seasoning was the way to go as far as cooking goes. We ordered the New York Strip, Filet, and Cowboy Ribeye. I got the New York, after all the rave reviews I was just luke warm on it, wish I would have gotten the Ribeye (it's my favorite cut). The mashed potatoes were super creamy and the brocolli and string beans were good not over seasoned and really fresh. \\n\\nWas it a great steak? Absolutely. Was it worth the bottom line?

There are 4 seats there. We had fun watching the kitchen, but had we been seated elsewhere I don't think we would've enjoyed the meal too much less. \\n\\nWe both got the non-vegetarian 6 course Chef's Whim, which was a single bite, a charcuterie plate, a salad, a fish dish, a meat dish, a palate cleansing sorbet, and a dessert. The single bite was a sliver of scallop and sauce, and was delicious. The salad was endive, cured duck breast, toasted (or roasted?) hazelnuts, and a very tasty cheese. The fish was Scottish salmon over rock shrimp, mussels, and a few bits of lobster in a celery puree sauce and another sauce. The meat was veal wrapped in bacon with (sorry, it was last night, and rather late) several small vegetables. The palate cleanser was lemon-mint and vanilla and had some seeds along with the sorbet. We were given 2 different desserts - their  Milk Chocolate Mole Panna Cotta and Vanilla Mascarpone Mousse (I think - the second could've been something else.) I got a mocktail (which I didn't see listed on the menu) that was tasty enough when I told her what flavors I liked, and he got one of the specialty cocktails.\\n\\nThe single bite was delicious. They then brought a basket of rolls, which we partook of. The rolls weren't terribly special, but I'd read reviews about people not thinking there was enough food in the Chef's Whim. We were both full at the end of the meal, so I somewhat regretted the rolls. I didn't mention what the charcuterie was, because I generally don't like sausage and the effect was lost on me, as was the description of what the main piece of meat was. My date enjoyed it. The salad underwhelmed me. He enjoyed the bites he took of everything together, and I particularly liked the bites that had toasted hazelnuts, but it didn't seem possible to get them in every bite and the other flavors didn't work well enough for me without the hazelnuts. The fish was delightful, all around. Very tasty, everything tasted well together or even if taken in bites of only bits. The meat course was divine. The palate cleanser existed, and I think that's about all that can be said about it. On the other hand: my mocktail was already doing a fairly good job of palate cleansing, so maybe that's my bias? It was a bit grittier of sorbet than I wanted it to be. The desserts were both tasty in their own ways. \\n\\nThere was a couple seated next to us that ordered the 4 course Chef's Whim. They received the same single bite, charcuterie, and dessert as we did. They may have also gotten the salad? They definitely didn't get the same meat course and didn't get the fish course at all. They may or may not have gotten the palate cleanser, depending on presence of the salad? So: I thought it was interesting that the 4 course did, in fact, have a different set of food than the 6 course, though that may not always be the case (this is the only time I've been.) \\n\\nOn the experience: It was fun to try. My date said he especially enjoyed not having to make choices, and just waiting for people to bring him food, though it wasn't as much of a draw for me, in the end.  If it were standard for me to lay out that kind of money per person I might try it again sometime.The food didn't wow either of us enough (even though he did say he had enjoyed all of the courses, and I had very much enjoyed a few of the courses and had just moderately \\"not gotten\\" a couple) nor the experience knock our socks off enough to be worth it in the \\"special occasion\\" type price range, since I feel like I've had better experiences at other restaurants for similar or better prices. I would put this on a list of \\"fun things to try if you've lived in Boston for a few years and have the money to throw at it\\", but not a \\"must do if you're visiting the city and looking for the best food experience ever.\\" My opinion my also be colored by the fact that a 9 pm dinner is rather late in the day for me. I think the couple next to us almost caught up to us time-wise, but not quite.

The soft shell crab bao was perfectly crispy and flavorful. The grouper bao had the perfect texture and the refreshing slaw on top perfectly complemented the flavors of the fried grouper. The tofu bao was delicious, although the red pepper relish was kind of out of place on the bao, I would have preferred a sweet chili sauce or maybe a daikon radish slaw but it was still amazingly delicious. The buns were perfect, not too dry, not too juicy, and just the right size. The fakeinit tater tots were extremely delicious and the tofu bacon, onion and garlic jam, scallions, and other ingredients all complemented each other in a very delicious fashion. Together they created an amazing flavor profile.

My server didn't mention them so I didn't know they existed until I saw the cook building the best looking breakfast burrito I ever set my eyes on.  Oh well I know for next time.\\n\\nThat's a very small complaint because what I ordered was delicious.  Good food for a fair price .\\n\\nI had a very basic breakfast but there were some delicious and notable surprises.  I had cheese grits, bacon, eggs, and toast.  It was just good solid food.  the eggs were cooked well and not greasy.  Cheese grits were perfectly cooked and not the regular waffle house variety, the bacon was crispy and not greasy, and they served it with artisan toast almost like a sourdough slice.  It was the perfect compliment.\\n\\nAnyway I'll definitely go again.

I have been twice since they opened and while I am a fan of their space--a little funky--and their cute staff, their food was average at best.  \\n\\nAfter all of the hype, their food was a bit bland and very greasy.

We've had some amazing Mexican food in Santa Barbara, California and we have both been looking for something with that quality and flavor on the east coast ever since. Happily, Acitron fits the bill on this one. The atmosphere was friendly and festive. Good decor, good lighting, and a lively crowd. Great for a casual meal or a date night.\\nThe service was friendly and prompt, which is always appreciated. And the food was very good. I would say that the main part of the dish is what really stands out, and the sides are good but not great, which is why I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5 stars.\\nFor dinner, I started out with a Corona Light ($4.50). It arrived in a freezing cold glass with a nice slice of lime. I love a nice, cold beer. They also brought fresh corn chips and tasty, not hot, salsa to the table. The salsa was excellent.\\nFor dinner, I had grilled shrimp with a Tamarind Mole sauce ($18.95), and a little sweet corn cake underneath. I want to say there were 8 shrimp, a generous enough portion. I brought home leftovers. For the sides I chose rice and beans and both were fine but underwhelming. They also offer grilled corn on the cob which looked good. I was not in the mood to eat with my hands that night, so I didn't try it but would next time.\\nMy partner had grilled shrimp enchiladas with a green sauce ($17.95) and rice and beans as the sides. He thought the dish was very good, and although I didn't try the enchiladas, I did try the green sauce and it was flavorful without being too hot.\\nAll in all, it was a nice meal and we are happy we chose to try this place.

Manager was out back smoking a cigarette all this time!"},{"name":"Craigie On Main","address":"853 Main St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"The anxiety is palpable.\\n\\nFirst and foremost, I don't care how hyped your restaurant is... it is just plain annoying when, having made a reservation three weeks in advance, my choices for a Saturday night dinner time are 9:30pm or 10:00pm, everything else booked solid. We're not talking about culinary enlightenment here. Perhaps this is due to their somewhat small size. I like making a dinner reservation a couple days before, maybe a week tops. Apparently three weeks just wasn't enough in this case. The cynic in me just instantly feels like I'm dealing with a pretentious establishment. It's not entirely fair to blame this on Craigie... tables are just in high demand. But know that I went into my reservation with an attitude of \\"This better be worth it...\\" Get your reservations out of the way as early as you can.\\n\\nSecondly, this place will stress you out. The environment may seem cozy, but on a Saturday night Craigie On Main is bedlam. Servers rush back and forth, and the whole thing seems a little disorderly. It is very interesting to be able to observe an open kitchen, but the cacophony emerging from this open space can really put a damper on anyone expecting a relaxing meal. You will also leave smelling like the kitchen. I will note that I was here for a date, and so I was hoping for something a little more intimate. On any other night, this kind of environment may have been exciting and an experience in and of itself.\\n\\nAs we were walking in, I caught a glimpse of the hostess having a private moment: She was pushing down with the palms of her hands, taking frantic breaths, and saying, \\"Ok... ok... breathe... breathe...\\". However, she greeted us with a lovely smile and calmly and efficiently directed us to the bar while they prepared our table. The bartender was also visibly stressed, but upon closer observation she was holding the entire operation in order and handling herself like a pro. Want a cocktail that isn't on the menu? Not a problem. Our server was also top notch and knowledgeable. I regret that I don't remember names, here, but I made sure to compliment the staff on their survey (provided with the check). We were seated 15 minutes late. Not a big deal, but again a little frustrating given the already late hour.\\n\\nUltimately, what ruins the entire experience are two things. First is the anxiety level mentioned above that will turn off most casual diners looking for a pleasant, intimate meal. Second is quite simply the perceived value for the price. This is an unusually pricey meal. Quite frankly, it's good, but it's not THAT good. For two of us, we spent (after tax and slightly over 20% tip) approximately $175.00. What we received at that price level were two cocktails while we waited for our table, an appetizer which we shared, two entrees, and two glasses (not a bottle) of wine. The value just isn't there. Especially when the entrees (both were pork 3 ways) were small, and much too salty. And look, I'm not Joe American who needs a heaping plate of food in front of him. The price and perceived value just didn't match for me. Maybe this is just the inflated cost of good, local ingredients. I can't really say. The pork was mostly fatty and over-salted.\\n\\nWhere I did perceive a better value is in their brunch offerings. At around $55 per person, their fixed price brunch menu is a much more satisfying choice. Having done both brunch and dinner at this establishment, I can honestly say that I will probably only return for brunch... and probably not very often since it is still a very expensive brunch, indeed.\\n\\nAll in all, I just can't justify a fourth star. For me, the only thing keeping it from dropping down to two stars is their service, who seemed to admirably handle themselves well despite the anxious nature of this establishment."},{"name":"Strega Italiano - Seaport","address":"One Marina Park Dr","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Love this restaurant!

I've got a text file on my desktop filled with reviews that I always planned on posting but somehow never got around to, & I've been typing up some new ones recently as well. I think Steve's deserves the distinction of being such an awful experience, that it finally pushed me to start posting my reviews again. Hooray, I suppose?\\n\\nAnyway, I had decided to order from them after viewing their rather humorous (though I'm betting it's unintentional) website & wanting to support a local business. After seeing their good reviews, I figured they would be a safe bet.\\n\\nThe order was taken without any problems. They said it'd be around 45 minutes. It came in closer to 30, so I guess you could say they are relatively speedy. Delivery guy was also nice. The problems started once he left...\\n\\nYou see, we ordered a buffalo chicken sub, a small order of fried mushrooms, a large order of buffalo fries, & a slice of tiramisu.\\n\\nI took the food out of the bags. Okay... let's see... there's the tiramisu. Two cups of ranch. A big, dripping, wrapped sub, presumably of the buffalo chicken style. NO FRIES IN SIGHT! & the small order of mushrooms? Yeah, that was $4.75. How many mushrooms did we get? NINE! Totally not joking. I almost wanted to check the bottom of the bag & see if maybe there was a huge hole that the mushrooms & fries could have fallen out of. But there wasn't. I realize it's a small size order, but nine frickin' fried mushrooms for nearly five bucks is disgustingly overpriced -- especially after reading multiple brags about \\"large portions\\" on their website. That small of a small should be like 3.50 at most... I've never had a problem with getting the small size at other establishments, there's always been plenty to share. But this was pretty sad.\\n\\nOkay, well, let's call them back & let them know our fries are missing. The guy on the phone says he didn't hear when we ordered them (really??), but he'll send some over (alrighty then). So we have a small disappointment, but good customer service. I felt a little better. No problem, right? Sometimes mistakes happen. We can just eat the buffalo sub until it gets he-- HOLY GOD WHAT IS THIS. I unwrapped the sub, & it's COMPLETELY WRONG. It's not even chicken! It's some shaved steak... thing... nothing but shaved steak. There doesn't appear to be any cheese, condiments, or veggies... how do you confuse buffalo chicken with this? They even asked on the phone if we wanted the chicken fingers or the chicken kebobs! SHAVED STEAK =/= CHICKEN FINGERS! Don't try to fool me!\\n\\nMaybe I should have inspected the sub before we called about the fries, but I guess I put too much trust in them. Frustrated, we called back, not even three minutes later, & told them we got the wrong sub. They said they'd fix that, too. Ugh.\\n\\nSo here I sit, still hungry after a handful of mushrooms, wondering if I should just eat my damn tiramisu now instead of bothering to save it for dessert. Aw hell, I'll go ahead & take a bite so I can tell you guys if I liked it.\\n\\n*grabs fork & opens plastic container*\\n\\nNot real tiramisu. However, it doesn't taste horrible. But a small slice of tiramisu & a handful of mushrooms is not a dinner, folks!\\n\\nAnyway, the second delivery guy came with the buffalo fries & sub... he wanted to make sure we weren't screwin' around or whatever, so we showed him the sub. He said oh, that's a cheesesteak (really? I could've sworn cheesesteaks have, you know, CHEESE on them). He was nice too, as well as apologetic. We took the bag & got ready to eat our dinner, finally.\\n\\nWe opened the bag. The sub was correct, thankfully. However, it was also very underwhelming. Slightly stale bread with four or five tiny-sized buffalo chicken fingers shoved inside. No ranch, no lettuce. Nothing. Which is good if you're just looking for a straightforward sub, I guess. But I was not impressed. As far as the buffalo fries... they just gave us normal fries. & we had ordered a large, but they gave us a small. So yet again, it was wrong. But ya know what? Screw it. I'm not gonna make them come all the way back out here a third time. I'm just gonna post a review & make a mental note to never order from them again.\\n\\nI took photos of the mushrooms, tiramisu, & subs. It's a damn shame this place sucked so hard. If you want to support a local sub/pizza shop in the Malden/Melrose/Medford area, they're pretty much a dime a dozen in these parts. So just pick somebody else, ANYbody else.

What's good to some is not always good to others and vice versa. Anyway, MY experience at antico's pizza was much less than desirable. First of all, the menu to me was very hard to decipher. It must be geared toward one who's familiar with Italian or someone versed in culinary arts because all of the pizza ingredients listed were like trying to read a foreign language. Definitely do not plan on \\"having it your way\\" because what you see is what you get! I feel like I deserve it my way paying an expensive base price of $18. There is a set menu and no substitutions or additions or subtractions allowed under any circumstances with the exception of maybe adding meat or vegetables for a whopping additional price. No kind of create your own or anything. You choose one of the kinds they make or you're out of luck. I ordered the \\"margarita\\" pizza and added sausage. Pizza was ready fast, and it showed why when I got it to my car and opened up the box. When I got to my car and looked at it, it looked as if they had dumped a cup of water on top of the pizza. It was a wet, soggy, hot mess! The water was draining off the pizza and running down into the box. I'm not sure if this is because they had watered down the pizza sauce to stretch it or if the pizza was previously frozen right before they cooked it. The sausage topping was huge globs of barely cooked meat. There was also some type of white cheese on it that was in huge COLD clumps. I attempted to pick up the pizza to taste it, and it was so limp and soggy and dripping water I couldn't even get it to my mouth. Unbelievable. I ate about three slices there in my car. The dough was pretty good. I brought the rest home, but it's still in the box sitting waiting to go out with the garbage. But to those of you who love antico's, the more for you and I'm glad you love it! This was merely MY experience. I sure don't believe in consuming \\"unenjoyable\\" fat and calories.

It's like the American version of omakase, where the chef chooses what to serve you based on what he feels like making and feels is the best for the night. I had originally been told that I would be sitting at the chef's counter, which overlooks the open kitchen, and had been super excited about that, but when we arrived there happened to be an open table so we were seated there instead. Ah well, a table made the meal seem more intimate anyways. The decor gives a feeling of being in someone's living room, with the some bookshelves and vintage serveware decorating the area, as well as some vintage posters decorating the walls. Very homey.\\n\\nSince it's been awhile, I don't remember all the specific dishes we had, but I do remember them being very well executed.

But before I go any further, let me just say that The Salt Lick BBQ is more than just a restaurant, it's an event!  From central Austin, it'll take you roughly about 35 minutes to get there, but the drive to Driftwood is still very scenic.  Better hurry though, looks like the ever expanding Austin sprawl will be knocking on The Salt Lick's door's quite soon.  I've found that the best way to enjoy The Salt Lick is to bring along a cooler full of beers and a few friends because this is definitely a social experience.   There's a pretty big shaded patio area with plenty of picnic style tables and typically a band will be playing all your Texas standards and some country classics.  Get your name on the list, grab a seat and pop open one them beers!  Now relax and take in the atmosphere that is unique only to Texas and the rest of the country wishes they had.   \\n\\nOnce your name is called, you'll be brought in to where the real smokey magic happens.   Inside the original restaurant, you'll  see the world famous \\"Open BBQ Pit\\" with many years worth of flavor cooked in to it.  It truly is one beautiful thing to behold.  The inside of The Salt Lick has an old western ranch feel to it and yes, you guess it... more picnic style benches and some wooden chairs & tables in the back area.   All of this western rustic aura really works well and totally gets your taste buds screaming to be satisfied.  We were lucky enough to be visiting during one of the few times during the week where they serve beef ribs.  My order consisted of a mixed platter of smoked turkey, sausage and brisket.  Along with that, I asked for a single beef rib because the waiter warned me that it weighed about 5 pounds.   Once all of our food arrived, I can clearly see that our waiter was not exaggerating at all!  Fred Flintstone would've had a big grin on his face.   The BBQ sauce here is a little more sweet than I prefer, but their spicy haba√±ero sauce really hit the spot with it's slow burn.   The sausage was my least favorite and frankly, left me quite disappointed with it's flat taste.   But the brisket was incredibly moist and tender.   The smoked turkey was incredibly juicy and bursting through with flavor.  \\n\\nAs a whole, I love the whole event of visiting The Salt Lick BBQ.  It's a wonderful place to spend the afternoon with friends, family and out of towners.   The food is worth the trip, but not my favorite BBQ in Texas.  Don't let too much time go by before making a trek down to Driftwood, you'll have a great time getting to the heart of Texas fun."},{"name":"Brooklyn Pizza","address":"240 N Liberty St","city":"Powell","stars":"4","text":"If you are looking for a a spot that reminds you of NY style pizza in Central Ohio, this is the place to go.

We first ordered the Rainboll Roll, which had 8 pieces and was a combination of tuna, salmon and yellowtail.  Definitely a 5 star sushi roll, very fresh fish and perfectly cooked rice!  We then had the shabu shabu hot pot which is the most traditional.  It costs $40 and comes with a HUGE plate of vegetables that we couldn't finish and a plate of thinly sliced beef.  This was more than enough food for 2 people!  I love all veggies so this was a huge plus for me.  It comes with a few different dipping sauces but I didn't really care for them, so I asked for the ginger salad dressing and they were very nice about it.  The vegetables were great, but the beef was a little weird to me.  It was good quality but it was just sliced so thin and cooked so quickly that it became pretty chewy.  For dessert we had a seasame pudding that was pretty good, not too sweet so I liked it!  I am glad I had the hot pot experience and I think it's worth a shot one time, but I don't think I'll be back for more.\\n\\nI will however be back to Nakato for Hibachi without a doubt.  They have an early bird special every Sunday-Thursday until 6:30 pm with $11 for steak and chicken, $12 for chicken and shrimp, and $13 for steak and shrimp - can't beat that price and they still give you the same portions and all the fixings.

The worst part though was that we were seated in a back corner. When we mentioned to management that we were bummed we couldn't see the entertainment they responded that only 1/5 of the seats can! They told us dancers would come to our section - except for when they did they danced behind a pillar! Really upset as that was the whole reason we had chosen to eat there. I wish I had known to request a table in the main room. Worst part is a little better design planning and they could improve sight lines to the entertainment. The design seems lazy and ineffective for what they brand themselves as. They had mirrored barriers for our room - why not windows? Why not a small raised stage in the side rooms or raised tables? I will say the waitress was nice but not sure if I will ever go back as I was pretty let down and management just shrugged it off.

As a New Yorker in the TX for the first time, I had no idea what to expect from Salt Lick. All I had to prepare were my roommates legendary stories of Salt Lick's excellence and my own love of finger-lickin' BBQ. Aaaand by meal's end, I was beyond full, and my culinary pantalones blown away by the delicious meats.\\n\\nFirst, the space. I love how Salt Lick is laid out - just a series of long wooden picnic tables to talk and eat with family and friends over good (BYOB) drinks. Oftentimes they have a live band, which only enhances the outdoor, laidback atmosphere.\\n\\nNow to the food. You see that pit? ALL the fine meats you will tasting will come from that magical place. Salt Lick is an institution built for family style, so we ordered beans, brisket, pork ribs, and sausage for the table to share, along with the complimentary pickles, jalape√±os, onions, and bread to share. Ooo and what a meal it was. The sausages were crispy on the outside, salty and savory on the inside. The ribs could sometimes be a tad dry, but this was more than made up by the rich flavoring. However, the REAL star of the show was the brisket. I could have eaten that crisp, smoked mesquite crust forever. The meat was juicy, fresh, and seasoned, but not overly seasoned as to undermine the use of sauces.\\n\\nThese sauces were so good that I bought a bottle of the spicy version to bring back to Queens with me. The mild is smooth and sweet, but my vote will always go with the \\"spicy,\\" which to me was more smokey with a hint of pepper and spice. A perfect complement to the meat, and my new favorite BBQ sauce.\\n\\nAs for the sides, the beans were smoky and covered in a thick sauce, the pickles appropriately crisp, and soft bread a perfect way to soak up all the meat juices. And while it can take long to get a table - we went on gameday, so we barely waited for a table - the food comes out pretty quick (10min), which is a plus. All in all, Salt Lick is an excellent BBQ establishment that lives up to its praises."},{"name":"The Porter Beer Bar","address":"1156 Euclid Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"As you walk in there's an extremely narrow bar area which opens up in the back to a dining area.

The beer menu on the other hand has over 200 varieties from microbrews to high-gravity Belgian ales to rare specialty beers (some with a price tag of $98 for 1.5L!).\\n\\nI opted for The Porter's Half Pound Cheeseburger, which has fresh Angus Beef, bacon, cheddar cheese, lettuce, tomato, red onion, pickle, and had it cooked medium. When the food arrived, I was drooling over how appetizing it looked. I bit in, and noticed it was cooked more medium-rare, possibly even rare. I didn't let it bother me and kept on chomping down and enjoyed every bite. I feel like The Porter could be giving other local restaurants a run for their money in \\"Top Burger in Atlanta\\" competitions.\\n\\nOverall, the burger is great, they give you more than enough fries (let a friend get a salad and split your sides up), the service is...decent, but it is in Little 5 Points, so maybe that's why, or maybe it's due to the fact they are a new place and the beer selection is AMAZING.

I had been there for beers before, but this was the first time I had their food. You know, I found no rhyme or reason to their food menu. They had everything listed from ceviche to teriaki something or other to tamales to brats with kraut. Now some people may appreciate the variety, but to me, it was a cacophany of regional delights. I am suspicious about how well one small kitchen crew (cause the kitchen is indeed tiny) can do on so many different dishes. \\n\\nThat being said, I had the shrimp and grits. The dish was beautifully, though simply presented, with a mound of crimini and portabella mushrooms, and a drizzle of truffle oil. The mushrooms were tasty and added a nice smattering of tart/salty in the creamy grits. However, the portabella were a little, um anorexic. They were either chopped up small or were actually baby bellas, for which I have much less respect. There were a fair number of medium sized shrimp which were cooked properly (thank God). The grits I found to be creamy, though a little bland, do the mushrooms were a nice complement. All in all, it was pretty good.\\n\\nThe beer menu is staggering, fit for even the most finicky of beer snobs. So, no complaints there. \\n\\nMy only complaint is that this place could be hazardous to your physical well being. The front part of the joint is shotgun style.

I drink a lot of water, so for me that's a bit annoying. I get it, they're trying to avoid waiter- service and make more profit. However, I think they're being a bit greedy here with the prices, quite an expensive pizza! (I mean, does it have shaved truffles on top?!)\\n\\nNext step: find seating. This was a challenge. There is no rhyme or reason, no order to the chaos in this place. The seating arrangements are a bit awkward, I feel ergonomically the interior design is quite poor. If a re-design is not in their plans, they should at least consider having a host/ hostess to seat customers. Also, a designated waiting area would be nice instead of the cluster f*ck in front. :)\\n\\nFinally, with some careful stalking (that felt a bit predatory) we snatched up seats.

I find it interesting that there are no plates, as customers are expected to eat right off the tray the food is served on. Huh. : /  I was also quite disappointed in the lack of table service. Honestly, I don't feel it's right to expect the costumers to track down hurried servers to ask for something. The pizza had a great taste, despite dripping with grease, but for me did not have enough sauce. I stalked down a server for some extra marinara, and shortly thereafter 2 other people at our table copied my idea.

Expect good and get great, and you're satisfied.  Expect stellar and get anything less, and you're not.  The day leading up to dinner at Ruth's Chris for Restaurant Week was an excercise in expectation management.\\n\\nI'd never gone out for Restaurant Week, as hearing scattered tales of disinterested or downright terrible service for years has kept me away.  But I decided that I couldn't live my life based on heresay and conjecture, so I toughed it out and made a reservation.  I then prepared myself for what to expect, which was a fairly involved process.\\n\\nI love steakhouses.  Smith and Wollensky speaks to my sensibilities in the most complete way, but I also have an appreciation for Morton's, Capital Grill (at times), KO Prime and even Frank's out on Mass Ave.  You sit in comfortable chairs and are served excellently trimmed cuts of meat by waiters who take the time to introduce themselves and explain what they do.  It's a two hour affair and you should leave feeling as if you've somehow taken advantage of their kindness, even though you're dropping $100 per head.\\n\\nI knew going in that Ruth's Chris for Restaurant Week would have some elements of this, but not all.  The service would be hastier, but the ambiance and quality of food should remain the same.  So my expectations were set to \\"workmanlike yet satisfying affair.\\"  And, for the most part, it was.\\n\\nThe ma√Ætre d' checked my coat herself and led me into the labyrinthian catacombs of the Old City Hall.  She asked if I had ever dined at this location (I hadn't), and then proceeded to tell me about the seven rooms of various sizes and shapes, and that I'd be in the Freedom Trail Room.  She sat me at a table near the door, and I took a moment to soak in the exposed hundreds-year-old brick from my cushioned chair.\\n\\nI ordered from the fixed-price Restaurant Week offerings - the jambalaya, the petite filet with garlic mashed potatoes, and the bread pudding to close it out.  The jambalaya, a \\"Ruth's Chris favorite\\" was a bit on the thin side, and I was disappointed that the restaurant's definition of jambalaya did not include andouille sausage.  Still, the flavor was there.  The petite filet was served on a sizzling plate, which I know is a Ruth's Chris speciality done for presentation purposes, but I didn't care for it.  Let the meat speak for itself.  It was a larger cut than I had expected, but could've been trimmed just a bit better.  It was the first time in my life that I had to leave some filet on the plate.  The garlic mashed was what it needed to be - creamy and not overpowering.  The bread pudding, a dessert I never order, turned out to be tasty if a bit on the eggy side.  I noted it was the perfect dessert for Restaurant week; it is baked by the trayfull and cut to order.  Worked out great.\\n\\nThe service was efficient if not falling-over-themselves friendly (as you usually see in a steakhouse), but my water glass was constantly filled and my plates were cleared quickly.  They pooled their waiters together to take care of the press of people, which worked out fairly well all things considered.\\n\\nAll told, I was in and out in just under an hour.  Throughout that hour, I ate fairly well, was served fairly efficiently, and was in comforting surroundings.  If I expected \\"full steakhouse experience,\\" I'd have been disappointed.  But this is Restaurant Week, so my \\"workmanlike yet satisfying affair\\" speculation held true.  Nice place.  Not my favorite, but I wouldn't turn down an invite."},{"name":"Toney Bento","address":"1423 SE 37th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3","text":"I just had chicken bento and it was so good!

You might have to park somewhere down the street in front of someone's house and walk it.\\n\\nService: You walk in, order at the counter, you pay for it, and take a seat, and someone brings it out to you.  When you're done, they clean it up.  Nothing more to it than that.  If you want drinks, you can go get it at the counter yourself.  Also, as far as ordering pizzas go, think, \\"Soup Nazi\\" from Seinfeld.  No half-toppings, no frilly crap.  Either you want it or you don't.  \\n\\nDecor: They could REALLY use more seating, but I get it, it's a prime real estate.  In the front is a tiny counter area you can pull up a bench, and behind it is a small picnic table you can all sit at.  Behind that area, is a larger room with multiple picnic style tables, so don't be shy to rub shoulders with someone else.  Protip: In the summer, the back room has no AC (it's the kitchen staff area, where you can see them making the pizza and put them in one of three fire brick ovens).  So be warned.  On a hot day, you may not be a fan.  The back room also has two TVs mounted on the wall, usually playing sports.\\n\\nFood: It's good, the food comes out fast (5 - 10 min for a pizza), and it's pretty decent.  But it's definitely NOT better than NY pizza.  The portions are NOT NY pizzas.  \\n\\nAnother note: It's BYOB, so feel free to bring a cold 6 pack and enjoy.\\n\\nOverall: I thoroughly enjoyed the place.  It was good food.  However, I wish that there were more seating, the back room had AC, and they had more than the tiny little bottles of sodas.  At such a high price ($30+ for a pepperoni pizza and two cokes), and sweating profusely in the back room, I doubt I'll try again, but it's worth it to try once."},{"name":"WINGS Granville","address":"1162 Granville Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"2.5","text":"This place sucks....we came here to eat breakfast and there was a large party of 6 or 7 people who were loud as hell.

The spice-encrusted pork rib was tasty, but the grilled pork belly and crispy suckling confit weren't spectacular. I simply did not think an establishment of this caliber should produce dishes without more of a punch. The Tasmanian sea trout was cooked very well, tender and just a bit raw in the middle. There was a sauce with a bit of a spicy kick, mussels and a bean of some type, too. Unfortunately, the fish didn't have much flavor and was bland. Regular salmon has more taste. Maybe it was the particular dishes we selected or the ingredients that they happened to select that day, I don't know. The prix-fixe menu looked great, and we decided that we would come back in the future to give that a try.\\n\\nGranted I had high expectations, but a $30-something per plate restaurant with a James Beard Award finalist chef, named one of the top restaurants in Boston should produce more exciting food. When our waitress asked how we were enjoying our meals, we were honest with her. She apologized, offered to get us something else, told us about their Chef's Whim tastings on Sunday nights and invited us to come back another day to give them another chance. She listened to our opinions and was sympathetic.\\n\\nNow here's the best part of it all ... when our check was supposed to arrive, they comped our meal and gave us a $50 gift card for our next visit!!! That was so unexpected and generous, and now we definitely have to try Craigie again! Honestly, I rarely find such great service, and it's so refreshing when I find a restaurant that actually cares about their customers. \\n\\nBased on my only on my experience with the particular entrees we had at Craigie last night, I would have given only 2 or 3 stars. With the excellent service, Craigie on Main has definitely earned 4 stars in my book. I will be updating my review after my next outing to Craigie.

Granted, it was a 20-minute ride home, so I wasn't surprised that it wasn't hot (it came fresh out of the oven, so that's not their fault).

I said well I didn't get it and she said she'd call back.  She called back and said oh he's on his way it will be 5 minutes.  5 minutes was more like 15 minutes.

The kids enjoyed watching the chefs of other grills cook while we waited for our chef to arrive. The atmosphere was pleasant, the service was fast and the food was delicious! I've been to a handful of hibachi restaurants and feel that in comparison, Nakato really gives you your money's worth. The hibachi dinners include soup, salad, 2 shrimp, rice, grilled veggies and your main dish. The kids ordered from the children's menu and the only difference I noticed in portion size is that they got slightly less salad than the adults. You can see their menu and prices on their website. Other reviewers have stated that Nakato is pricey, but as far as the hibachi experience goes, the prices are industry standard and include plenty of food along with entertainment and a relatively authentic atmosphere. The one thing I didn't like is that to park in their parking lot you must valet.\\n\\nSave money on your bill by going to couponmom.com and clicking on the \\"Restaurant Coupons\\" link, then click the restaurant.com banner.

I know it sounds too good to be true, but I did it and it totally works--Nakato accepted the printed out gift certificate with no questions ask.

In fact, our reservation, made days earlier, wasn't immediately found and the maitre d' was avoiding all eye contact with my husband, seeming to hope we'd just disappear.  The bar was packed and buzzing with games on TV, a dynamic environment, not a quiet little place.  Twenty minutes after we arrived, we were seated in a big comfortable booth.

Because that's exactly how I felt after a night clubbing at Republic and hitting up McDonald's, ha. The drink consisted of Glenlivet Founder's Reserve, Beefeater gin, roasted pineapple puree, fresh lime, homemade ginger beer, Peychaud's bitters and fresh mint leaves. It's a little fruity and a little spicy. I enjoyed it... although there was no straw (environment first) so it was a little difficult to drink/mix up.

Whew. I do like options! Favorite components: eggplant with yogurt, halloumi with dates (sweet and salty heaven!), carrot puree, and hummus. The tomatoes were decent. The zucchini with lentils and \\"falafel\\" were a bit bland. The falafel were really not falafel at all. They seemed raw? Not fried and hot like traditional falafel. The pita was a tad stale. If it were tender and fresh it would have been delicious.

I am a sucker for these types of places- I love Les Halles in NYC, and any bistro/brasserie really, as long as the food isn't crap. \\n\\nThe food here is good, but as mentioned, we did opt for the Restaurant Week offerings. We started with the 1/2 dozen oysters- so good and fresh and no sand. We also had the wine included with the menu, which is a fun little perk. But, when we were on to subsequent glasses, we had other varieties from their decent wine menu. I had the asparagus salad app- very good. Husband had the salmon tartare, also good. The bread with the roasted garlic was my favorite next to the oysters though- such a fun twist on the usual butter/oil.\\n\\nI had the duck for dinner- it was yummy. Not as crispy as advertised, but delicious, nonetheless. Husband had the flank steak. Good, but not world-rocking. \\n\\nDessert was a banana tart for me, and strawberry parfait for him. Both were passable. \\n\\nThe main thing about our experience at Aquitaine was the service. I wish I remembered our servers name, because she really deserves a shout out. She was amazing, and not over-the-top in-your-face amazing. Just kind of felt like she was working only on our table, because she anticipated our every need.

I have to drastically disagree with the 1-star review of this place. I've been hearing a lot of good buzz from the locals for a while now, so I tried it for the first time a few weeks ago. Had a cheeseburger sub and an order of fries, and I was pleasantly surprised. The ingredients are fresh - no pre-frozen burger patties here - and the quality and care really show. They batter their fries, so if you like them that way, you're in for a treat. And I have discovered, today, that their chocolate chip cookies are surprisingly tasty! They were perfectly done, with a tasty cookie batter, good consistency, and even at lunchtime the choco chips were slightly gooey and lovely.\\n\\nI have now ordered on a weekend, on a weekday evening, and at lunchtime. The lunch crowd is definitely their busiest time, but the employees were all friendly and helpful. Everyone made it a point to smile at me, and even though it was hectic, I never felt they had forgotten me - they made it a point to acknowledge and take care of me. They've always been friendly and welcoming - even when I went in at an off-peak time on a Saturday and weren't sure if they were even open. Whether they're overflowing or you're the only person there, they'll take care of you.\\n\\nA few notes: I probably wouldn't order the fries for delivery, as they'd likely be soggy by the time they got to you. They come out very hot and crispy, and they're best enjoyed that way. I haven't tried the pizza yet, but I've seen a lot of people eating it so it must be good.\\n\\nThis place is definitely a neighborhood sub and pizza joint, although they profess to be \\"Mediterranean\\" on Foodler and Campusfood.

I am not even sure how they got it to be so perfectly together, but when I asked for a little extra blueberry they brought me a full cup of blueberry sauce with wild blueberries to put on top that was nice and warm. They also give generous portions because there were two slabs of french toast on the plate and we shared. I'm not sure I could have finished both pieces with the exception that my taste buds would have insisted that I finish.

We then waited 21 minutes for our waitress to return with our cashed out bill. Don't get me wrong, she was actually a really nice waitress (not the one who was puking bc I refused to let her serve me) but she also spent too much time socializing with other servers and bc of that we were late returning from lunch. After listening to the one server puke her guts out and talk about how messed up she was the night before, I will be taking my business somewhere where the serving staff isn't sick and puking in the bathrooms.

We go to Disney every year and this year decided to try Universal Studios.  I bought a package for 3 nights at Lowes Royal Pacific and 3 days of park hopper tickets.  Where do I start?  We got to the park first and since I didn't have the credit card I made the reservation with we had to stand in the 45 min long line just to get in.  Frustrated already.  Because I didn't visit my hotel first I didn't have our express passes.  Lines were long so I went to guest services and the lady was nice enough to comp me some for the day.  If you are not staying on the property you have to pay extra for this A LOT EXTRA!  This is the one of two reasons we stayed on property.  For the express pass and proximity to the park.  We spent the rest of the afternoon at the park which I wouldn't do without the express pass.  With the pass you can practically walk on a ride while the regular line is almost an hour.  They should however have an express pass for the quick serve meal counters because most of them only have one attendant working and we waited 20 minutes in line just to get a soda and a bag of Doritos.  Having said that I hate that you are forced into paying so much for it or staying on their property.  I think Disney's fast pass is much more fair.  At Disney you can only hold one at a time, it's more like a reservation and they can run out.  I realize it's not the same, but it's free!  I think it's outrageous to ask people to pay that much extra after they already paid for their park ticket.  Check in at the hotel was easy enough and went smoothly.  We are at Jakes bar and grill which was average.  After a very long day we went to the room which again was average and honestly not the cleanest.  Lots of dust.  Not just dust, but huge dust bunnies and mildew in the shower tile.  We woke up very early to be at the park at 8 since the express pass doesn't work at Harry Potter and the lines can get excessively long.  So when we get to the park early we have to show our room key to prove that we are staying on property.  Then I need my regular ticket to get in the park.  Now I need a separate ticket for our express pass.  I have to keep track of 12 tickets everyday for my family of 4! Can't you please just combine them all like Disney?  Your room key is also your park ticket which also gets your your fast pass.  Makes perfect sense to me.  When we got back to our hotel that evening the beds hadn't been made.  Upon some investigation I found the door hanger on the back of the door behind the do not disturb sign that said please service this room.  I have to ask for my bed to be made and new towels for a room I'm paying over $300 a night for!  Are you kidding me??  Well okay, my bad for not seeing the stupid sign which I find ridiculous.  So the next day I put my sign out.  After yet another long day at the parks I come back to more unmade beds, but I do have new towels.  I guess while they were bringing me new towels and NOT making my beds they got hungry and helped them self to some of my $12 jelly beans because they were almost gone and touched my toothbrushes which I left in a glass on the counter.  No reason to touch my toothbrushes and you didn't even make my bed?  Why why why did you touch my toothbrush?  So on our way to dinner we stop by the front desk to complain.  He will investigate and call back.  We head to a dinner show.  He calls back and offers to comp half of our average meal from the night before and give us free breakfast the next morning.  Well the breakfast doesn't help me because we are leaving so early.  When we get back I have the housekeeping manager come to the room so I can point out all the dust, the unmade beds and the unswept floor.  He offers to send someone up to make the beds.  I decline because it's now 10pm and I have kids that need to go to bed.  I'm not going to wait for someone else to come now.  You had all day!  He leaves to go investigate and calls me back and says we offed you half off your dinner from yesterday and breakfast tomorrow.  I explain that I am leaving too early for breakfast.  So the end result is they credited me less than 1/3 of one nights stay.  I have now both called the hotel manager and sent an email and I am waiting to hear back.

I asked her what could possibly be in it that had gluten and she said that they use bread to thicken.... QUINOA.... if you've ever made Quinoa.... you'd know that this sounds crazy.

If your answer is yes, this is the place for you. If not, maybe you'll change your mind after reading this. Kappo stands to change all the rules of dining in Orlando. No menu, no options, no substitution, no, no, no,....... just accept divine offerings and indulge.\\n\\nFor centuries, highly acclaimed and well respected Japanese chefs have served the chosen few in tiny restaurants. The personal interaction and service from these master chefs is worth every ounce to an appreciative fan. This kind of dining is not for everyone. One has to be totally open minded and willing to try anything. Complete appreciation for ingredients and chef skills takes the frills out of dining. These restaurants seat just around a counter with hardly any other space. The walls sometimes act as chair backs. Decor is not a factor, one goes here for food and chef. That's it. No frills, no high pressure servers, no nose in the sir sommeliers, no corporate high clicker asking how was the food. None of that. Just honest to good food. This is Kappo.\\n\\nTheir food takes cue from Japanese cuisine. It seems as though the chefs submit to ingredients rather than pulverize food into submission for personal interpretation. Very few ingredients are used to compliment or contrast a main ingredient. This allows for ingredients to shine all the way through. A simple cut of fish on top of rice with a drizzle of ponzu or soy burst with flavors that speak for themselves. The difference here, that cut of fish does not exist in any sushi restaurant in Orlando or that delicate balance of sushi rice dances ever so lightly. Only freshly grated wasabi root is used in preparation none of that green bitter tasting paste.\\n\\nKappo is challenging Orlando diners to expand their palate and dining vision. Who said that there must be a sushi case, kimonos, Japanese bells, menu and everything in bamboo or ultra industrial modern or food that all taste the same? These young chefs put their training on display. Their food speaks for itself. The restaurant menu and style evolves every hour. Who knows what they are doing today or tomorrow.  Every high profile chef started somewhere. If these young chefs continue at this level, we are experiencing the birth for something truly special. If you can open your mind to entertain a dining experience like no other in Orlando, go and submit to greatness in the making."},{"name":"The Salt Lick BBQ","address":"18300 Fm 1826","city":"Driftwood","stars":"4","text":"I have added another spot to my BBQ heaven list!!!\\n\\nI have been searching the US for amazing BBQ and the salt lick is now on my must have list.\\n\\nThere are few places that I have seen on TV that have lived up to the hype, luckily the salt lick did.\\n\\nI was passing through the Austin area for work on wednesday and thought I'd score some BBQ for lunch, a quick search brought up The Salt Lick and I was on my way.\\n\\nI got there at 11:45 and the place was fairly empty (it's location isn't the best, it is in the middle of nowhere), but it smelled amazing.\\n\\nI was immediately given a menu and told to sit where ever I pleased.

I'd been a bit reluctant about Thai food in Boston after my first experience: Brown Sugar. I don't know who in their right mind would say that place is good! Their Yelp rating is way too good for them! Anyway, we're not here to discuss \\"the OTHER Thai place that shall NOT be named..\\"\\n\\nFirst thing I noticed about Chilli Duck was the \\"Free Delivery\\" sign at the door. I decided to take note in case I enjoyed the food and felt like using it in the future. Like a fortune cookie says, I decided on take-out since I felt like dinner and a movie.. in bed. I couldn't decide on what to get and asked the hostess for some suggestions. Oh man... she was so \\"I could care less\\" and \\"is it too late to pretend to not speak English?\\"-kinda attitude all over the place. I was so taken aback I almost left.\\n\\nIgnoring the rude service, I decided to just order the Thai staple: Pad Thai. And an order of chicken Panang Curry with rice. Kitchen was fast. It was ready in 10. Once I got home, I thought the meal was... alright. The curry wasn't lackluster. And the Pad Thai was different from what I'm used to, but it wasn't half bad. Dare I say good? Only thing missing was a wedge of lime. And once I added my own chili garlic sauce, it bumped up the taste quite a bit.\\n\\nAll in all, the place was ok. Don't think I'd come back again. Maybe if it were a little cheaper... yeah, it's not expensive, but it IS a bit expensive for Thai food. Eh... maybe if I'm desperate, stuck in bed and don't want to pay for delivery.."},{"name":"Rocco's Tacos & Tequila Bar","address":"7468 W Sand Lake Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"Way too loud to enjoy this place and the DJ was horrific.

For the groom's cake, we had a very simple cake structure with a very complicated design. After we sent Leila the pictures, we wanted to make sure that the design wasn't too complicated. She responded with, \\"It's going to be really fun to do.\\" So I wasn't worried about the quality of the picture. When I saw it on the cake, I was totally floored at exactly how perfectly the picture transformed into a drawing made with piping.

I believe a new cafe opened up nearby, so parking might not be as ample as before.   \\n\\nThe first time we went there, the ordering process was a bit confusing.  You order the pizza when you walk in and pay, and then move onto the cafeteria.  They call out your number and collect the pizza.  \\n\\nThe choices are somewhat limited, but all of them taste good.  The Margarita tastes really good.  The Pomodoro tastes good as well, but I think the Margarita one was the better of the two.   It's pretty cheesy, and the crust is thin.  The cheese and sauce have a very good relationship as well, as it's not too cheesy (although I'm much more forgiving if it is) but neither does it feel like the sauce overwhelms the pizza.  They also have a variety of peppers that you can put on your pizza afterwards besides the standard chilli flakes.  I especially liked these peppers that were pretty spicy, yet addicting.   \\n\\nThe seating is cafeteria style, so it's not really all that comfortable.  The place is loud though, and it can be hard to talk to people at times.  The pizza works much better if you could take out and eat somewhere else actually.

Opted to do the whole shebang tasting menu. I will say that the majority of the food was absolutely creative, delicious, well prepared, and thoughtful. However, great food isn't the only part of a great meal. \\n\\nHere is where i deduct fractions of a star from Craigie: We were never offered cocktail menus, and i was insaaaanely jealous of the awesome looking cocktails that went out to tables around us. Yeah the two bottles of wine we had were great, but i love pre-wine cocktails, and i was not facillitated in getting one.  Despite discussing meat and meat free amuse bouches, we were never brought one at all. Which was disappointing. The side of the evening was roasted bone marrow, we jumped all over that. Unfortunately, waiting with quite bated breath, it never came. I was deprived of my meat jelly experience! There was much wailing and gnashing of teeth over this. Also, it doesn't effect the rating negatively,  but i was confused why the first 4 courses of an 8 course menu were all fish. Seemed very fish heavy, but it is summer i suppose. \\n\\nPositives: staff was pleasant and informative, nice wine list, the assortment of desserts for our final course was really nice, we all got to try different things and share around. Nice to see an open kitchen, and how focused their team is. I was fascinated by the pull down food heaters at their expo station. We were all pleasantly surprised when Tony Maws came out to say hello.\\n\\nAh! Final point of contention: The chairs Craigie supplies for you to sit on, for a 3 hours multi-course tasting menu are torturous. No amount of adjusting, squirming, or talking walks between courses could bring a semblance of comfy feeling to my bum.

Something here really throws me off. \\n\\nThe restaurant is pretty rustic and kinda has 4 sections.\\n\\nWhen you walk into the front door, you find yourself in a crowded little area that is mostly a waitress station. There are some small booths here to help with the crowding. I've been here a few times and I always feel awkward and don't know what to do. I'm sorta standing on top of other diners and feel relieved when they take me to a table. I took a pic of this area for you. Note the many unmatched shades of green in the plants, walls and various decorations. As I waited on my food, I watched the waitress. I noticed that if I squinted so that everything was blurry but her, she was really cute but otherwise she was not so cute. It is the opposite effect of when you see a person step out of a Jaguar and you suddenly notice they really aren't hot. \\n\\nTo the left of the central waitress station is a big section with strange booths.

It wasn't spectacular, but still delicious.\\n\\n2) Hamachi with avocado = the avocado went well with the the delicate piece of raw fish.  \\n\\n3) Olive oil poached halibut with beat salad, risotto, and shrimp = My #2 dish of the night.  Halibut was very delicate and the beat salad enhanced the flavors of the fish.\\n\\n4) Lamb 3 ways (tongue, loin, and belly) and Grilled Spanish Octopus = My friend doesn't eat lamb so she got the octopus, while the rest of us got the lamb. The octopus was cooked well and very tender.  The lamb 3 ways was my favorite dish of the night.  I've never had lamb tongue before, so the experience was a pleasant surprise.  The amount of resistance I felt cutting the tongue with my knife, was the same as cutting a piece of chicken breast.  However, once I placed a piece of it in my mouth, the texture of the tongue was very creamy.  A very unique experience.  The belly was the most flavorful of the 3, with all the juicy fat.\\n\\n5) Bone Marrow (ordered this extra for my party) = I decided to order this separately after watching it being prepared several times that night.  Bone marrow...mmm...pure fat in my mouth.  This is a great dish to share with 4-6 people.  Eating this practically by myself...not a good idea.  I quickly got a headache after eating this much bone marrow.  I basically drank a cup of oil.

The staff was attentive.  \\n\\nOverall Opinion = Craigie on Main is a great restaurant.  However, the reason I'm not giving the 5th yelp star was because most of the dishes I had didn't blow my mind.  Given this place's reputation, I had high expectations.  I had a hard time writing this review simply because I struggled to remember details of the dishes that night.  Would I recommend the Chef's Whim? Absolutely!  Would I come back to this restaurant? Of course.  I've heard their burgers are really good, and I witnessed multiple burgers being prepared that night.  So the next time I visit Craigie, I'll go for the burger.

I preferred it without sauces but the green sauce is spicy and the white sauce makes it more mild. My BF got the ripe plantains and I chose to try the casava. The casava was basically a big French fry. Honestly not my favorite. I much more preferred the ripe plantains. These were just the right amount of sweetness.\\n\\nThe juice was also very good.

Yelp really needs to add the 6th star for this restaurant.\\n\\nWe found out about Kappo when we were researching dining options in Orlando, since we made a pretty last minute booking to Disneyworld. After reading all the wonderful reviews, we decided that we HAD to visit this place. Unfortunately, the online reservation system showed that the restaurant was fully booked till Dec. I decided to take a chance and begged for a reservation through email, since we were flying across the country. Fortunately, they were willing to accommodate us for a Sat 4pm seating for the sushi omakase. (Would have loved to go for dinner omakase instead, but that was fully booked)\\n\\nThe restaurant is pretty small, in fact, it is literally a hole in the wall. They seat only about 7-8 people at the sushi bar counter, and you can watch the chefs prepare the food right in front of you, which just makes the experience that much better.\\n\\nWe started off with a half dozen of oysters, 2 of each kind, all from the West Coast. There were 3 different types of accompaniment, which was quite a delight. This was followed up by a sashimi platter of trout, scallops, sea bream and ikura, all slightly seared and rubbed with a little yuzu pepper. \\n\\nWe saw that they had a special king crab dish served with burgundy truffle in the ala-carte menu, and requested to try that. The dish was beautifully presented with the king crab meat sitting on top of the truffle sauce, topped with egg vinaigrette and shavings of black truffles. The combination was perfect and it made me want to lick the plate at the end. In fact, we both liked it so much, my boyfriend almost didnt want to share that last piece.\\n\\nNext up was the sushi, served piece by piece. We were given wet towels to wipe our hands, since it was recommended for us to use our hands for the sushi as using chopsticks would cause it to fall apart. As the sushi was being prepared, the conversations flowed. We had lion fish, sea bream, trout, scallop, king crab, lobster, salmon belly... I forgot to take a picture of the salmon belly sushi, and they happily made one more for me, just for the pictures. Of course I gobbled it down greedily :P\\n\\nWe chatted with Mark and Lo about food in San Francisco, and casually mentioned that we were disappointed that foie gras was banned in California.  Following which, they served us a sushi with foie gras custard, uni and quail egg. This was totally orgasmic as we popped the sushi into our mouths. \\n\\nThey also served us a foie gras terrine topped with sturgeon caviar. This was very very good too. We discussed how to make the foie gras terrine and this dish has definitely inspired us to retry making it again. In fact, they gave us some pink salt to bring home since it was needed to cure the foie. How thoughtful!\\n\\nJust as we were getting full, our final dish was an ikura handroll. In my opinion, this was the weakest dish in the entire omakase menu. \\n\\nDesserts were meant for a separate stomach, and we enjoyed a persimmon ice dessert topped with cream and walnuts. This was very light and refreshing. Great for cleansing the palate. We also had another plate of yuzu marshmellow (Very very light), matcha cake (served warm, and oh so good), mango something (sorry I can't pronounce the name)... kinda like a jelly thing, and the ultimate miso macaron. The surprising combination of savory umami and sweetness worked extremely well. It was so good we packed another 6 pcs home!\\n\\nThe total bill came out to be $140+ for 2 people. It was well worth the price, and we were very very very happy with the experience. We even got 2 free onigiris to bring back. Mark, Lo and Jen were extremely friendly and the entire culture and atmosphere of the restaurant makes you feel very homey.. kinda like going to a friend's house for dinner. It was evident that they had many regular customers, since they greeted everyone like old friends and were super eager to feed everyone (sometimes even for free).\\n\\nIf I were to be nitpicky, I'd say that there was too much seared fish. Perhaps it was because the fish were not as fresh as they'd liked it to be, so they tried to dress it a little? Or maybe they just wanted to be creative and go with the flow. To be clear, the fish here IS fresh. I'd have loved to have some plain nigiri sushi. But that's just me.\\n\\nThey've only been open for 3 months, but I heard they've got the lease for 2 years in the incubator. I can't wait to see all the great things they come up with. I'm sure they'll be very successful wherever they go. I just wish that they'd preserve that culture and atmosphere as they continue to grow.\\n\\nKeep up the good work guys!!

Not only is their food incredible, but their service is also on par with what 5* restaurants should aspire to.\\n\\nLast night we took a group of friends to the bar to try the infamous Craigie burger.  Due to some miscommunication when I called a couple of weeks back, I thought they didn't take reservations in the bar (they do apparently).  The manager was incredibly sympathetic and helpful, and we worked it to split our group into 2 smaller tables.  She kept checking up on us, brought the ladies out a bowl of the brussel sprouts to taste (awesome), and was super attentive even when we were only ordering off of the bar menu.\\n\\nNow on to the burger: The beef is sourced from Hardwick beef in Western Mass.  It's mixed with miso paste and bone marrow, cooked in a CVap open and quickly charred on a plancha.  It's topped with cheddar, fried onions, and house-made ketchup.  It's served with perfectly seasoned, slightly spicy steak fries.  It's indescribably good, incredibly rich, and quite simply the best burger I've ever tasted.  The burger was cooked a perfect medium rare, stays unbelievably juicy because of the cooking methods, and the bone marrow takes it to the edge of being too rich... without quite getting there.\\n\\nIt's great to see how versatile Chef Tony Maws truly is... Craigie is known for unique culinary masterpieces, but Maws also can perfect the burger for the bar.  Combine this with awesome service, and you've got Craigie on Main.\\n\\nTips: For the burger, try to make a reservation at the bar - they apparently have like 4 tables you can reserve.  Otherwise, get there early (they open at 5:30), grab a seat at the bar, and enjoy.

During our first night in Portland, I did a quick search for best sushi places in Portland and came across this place.  Since this place did not allow reservations for parties 7 or less, we decided to get there early in order to minimize the wait time.  However, we had a super late lunch, so when we arrived, we weren't super hungry, and thus didn't try as many dishes as I would've liked! :)\\n\\nMSC Albacore Carpaccio - it was good, but I am not sure four pieces of sashimi justified the price ($15).  Under the description provided by the restaurant, this dish consists of  \\"chopped, house smoked cipolini onion, pickled shiitake mushrooms, momiji, ponzu, chervil, and Japanese sea salt\\".  Perhaps it is my unsophisticated palate, but I really couldn't taste all of the ingredients that went into the dish.  To be me, it was a good piece of sashimi, lightly seasoned, almost like a light ceviche \\n\\nImo Koroshi - definitely not worth ordering.  I read about some of the Yelp reviews that raved about this so-called \\"potato killer\\", but it was just roasted sweet potato, with some butter brushed on.  I could've easily made this at home, albeit without the amazing presentation.  My recommendation?  Unless you can't live without sweet potato, skip it.\\n\\nAburi Nigiri (savory) - one of the highlights of the meal, I enjoyed this so much more than the carpaccio.  I love the technique of torching sushi, and wish restaurants in the east coast will start to adopt it.  To be completely honest, I thought Miku in Vancouver did it better, but this was definitely a close second.\\n\\nHoki Poke Box - again, another technique that I wish the restaurants here would adopt, i.e. \\"pressed\\" sushi.  I don't understand why, it just tastes better than rolled sushi.  Any experts out there, I would love to hear from you.  Back to this specific dish, I appreciate the fact that they actually used a generous slice of tuna, instead of the scraps that restaurants generally use for tuna rolls.  The togarashi worked wonders for the roll, as did the few sprigs of scallion\\n\\nGarden of Eden - whoever thought of putting apples in sushi was brilliant!  I was worried that I would be sick of eating albacore for another dish, but it tasted so different from the other dishes.  I loved the addition of apples and picked mustard seeds.  Moreover, I love that the roll can stand on its own without the need for soy sauce and/or wasabi.\\n\\nSea Urchin Cr√®me Br√ªl√©e - I am not sure what exactly I was expecting, maybe a piece of sea urchin on top of the cr√®me br√ªl√©e?  Haha, I know that sounds ridiculous and I probably should've asked the server to clarified beforehand.  The dish was good, a bit creamier than the regular cr√®me br√ªl√©e.  The waiter mentioned that some people are turned off by the fishiness of this dessert, but I honestly didn't taste the sea urchin at all.  \\n\\nThe place was packed when we sat down and each dish was brought out by a different server, which could get a bit confusing after awhile.  However, our main server was great and patiently explained the intricacy of one dish after I misunderstood the server that brought the food.  I wish I can go back and try other dishes.

Creative and fun cocktails will surely delight everyone in your group and the bar tenders have no problem mixing you up a little something off the top of their head that will blow your sox off. (If you can't tell I take drinking seriously) They keep home made infusions and bitters for all mixed drinks. \\n\\nI have been to Craigie on Main a hand full of times now and I have never once had a bad meal or bad service. The wait staff is prepared to answer any questions about preparation and they are willing to give a guided hand to those who have a hard time making up their minds. The staff is well versed in wine so they are able to help make amazing suggestions on what will go best with your meal. The chef Tony Maws cooks each dish with love and care (you can taste it) \\n\\nI started with the House-made Terrines and the Crispy Pig Tails. AMAZING! They used to have Bone Marrow that was my all time favorite but I have not seen it on the menu for some time now. The Terrines are light and delicious and a great way to get your pallet ready. The Crispy Pig Tails are to die for. \\n\\nFor my entre I have tried a few dishes the first was the Local Grass Fed Beef Burger ( I had dinner at the bar) This burger is like none I have ever had before and no other burger has ever compared! The beef is surrounded by a home made bun and when you take your first bite.... Perfection....the beef just melts in your mouth. The shoe lace fries are seasoned like a dream.

All in all I would probably go back in a pinch."},{"name":"Craigie On Main","address":"853 Main St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Wow, this place had amazing food. Not amazing prices, but definitely amazing food. We had the 6-course tasting menu, and my one complaint is that the waiter could not give us ANY idea what would be on it before we ordered. He said it was the chef's choice, and it varied from day to day, but you'd think he could at least tell us what kinds of ingredients were likely to be served. In any case, we took the plunge and ordered it, and were pleased to note that he did ask if we had any allergies, particular dislikes (sweetbreads, etc.) or anything the chef needed to know.\\n\\nFirst came a trio of seafood-- there was a tartare of smoked fish topped with tiny potato chips and caviar, which was good and not too \\"fishy\\" for my tastes. The sashimi of smoked fish with the skin still on was unfortunately on the fishy side for me, and the texture left much to be desired. Hunks of raw fish with skin on are not fun to put in one's mouth. The last was a bite of octopus (cut to be almost noodle-like) with a yellow beet salad and citrus vinaigrette. Very refreshing, though I still had to have a sip of wine and some bread to get the fishy taste of the skin-on sashimi out of my mouth.\\n\\nNext we had a tiny salad of fennel, shiso, avocado, and thin slices of trout, with more citrus vinaigrette. My husband thought the trout added nothing, and would've been fine eating the salad alone, but I think it added richness to the dish. Very good, though it needed  touch more acidity.\\n\\nNext was a giant seared scallop with a fennel puree and some other components I can't really remember. The scallop was excellent, though.\\n\\nNext was foie gras with persimmon puree, candied pistachios, and a paper-thin slice of candied persimmon, served with brioche toast. I would've preferred if the foie gras weren't quite so chilled-- it was definitely cooler than room temp and the flavor didn't spread over the tongue until it got warmed up in my mouth. As it was, the temperature made it feel a little congealed, not as indulgent-- my favorite preparation for foie gras is to have it seared, so you get some textural contrast. Good flavors, though.\\n\\nNext was pork belly with some sort of wilted greens, and you'll have to forgive me if I can't recall all the accompaniments, because I was just so wrapped up in the meat. It was incredible. The texture, the flavor, everything. I'd never had pork belly before and always thought the fattiness would be a turnoff-- boy, was I wrong. It was perfect.\\n\\nFor the next course, Chef Tony came out to serve us the venison with potatoes and \\"Cape Cod olives\\" (I think). This was my husband's favorite course, though I still have to hold out for the pork belly. The venison was very tender, but the flavor just couldn't compare to the previous dish.\\n\\nNext came a series of desserts. They brought out two small glasses, both filled with sour milk panna cotta-- one was infused with jasmine tea, one with orange. The jasmine tea was subtle but definitely the best. Texture was spot-on.\\n\\nNext was another pairing-- I got a dish of sweet grits with stewed apples, pears, and other fall fruits, and a cinnamon ice cream (though it tasted more like a sherbet, and I could swear I heard another waiter tell another diner it was Meyer lemon sorbet). It reminded me of breakfast in autumn, though it wouldn't have been my first choice for a dessert. My husband got a napoleon filled with coffee cream, which had a strong coffee flavor but needed another dimension to it. Not bad, but not spectacular.\\n\\nFinally (and you'll notice this is the 9th course of a 6-course menu) they brought out tiny cups of very thick Valrhona hot chocolate, spiked with cinnamon, cardamom, and pepper. Well-balanced, chocolatey, and a nice finish to the meal.\\n\\nOverall, it was totally worth the price. We spent 2.5 hours there, and despite the tiny size of each dish we walked away stuffed. I can't imagine how we could've eaten the 10-course tasting menu! We are absolutely going back for our next special occasion!"},{"name":"Kal√©","address":"50 SW Pine St, Ste 102","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"this place is BULLETPROOF!!! what more can i say? you get a great portion of curry for 7-10 bucks (at least coming from the appetite of an infant); there are vegetarian, vegan, and meat options for THE WHOLE FAMILY! the guy at the counter said that the vegetarian curry can't be legally called vegetarian because of food facility conditions but big shocker right. i can only assume the same (if not worse) applies to most places, but i wanna give the guy Big Props for being as helpful and informative as he was being. the staff here is always very friendly and welcoming, plus the place's vibe is like a classy cafeteria which makes you feel at home. the food is excellent. it's one of those places you can always count on."},{"name":"Rocco's Tacos & Tequila Bar","address":"7468 W Sand Lake Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"By far one of my favorite spots to have some guacamole.

The wall next to us was covered with what looked like little tiny fruit flies. They were moving.  Absolutely disgusting!  \\n\\nNow on to the food.  I ordered one of their curry dishes (can't remember which one) and my friend ordered beef teriyaki. Our meals came out in less than 5 minutes, so they were obviously precooked and just microwaved for us. That the was worst curry I have ever had.  It was bland and watery.  I sent it back to be spiced up.  The waiter instead gave me a container of red pepper flakes.  Like an idiot, I added too much so it became unbearably hot.  The waiter then took the dish back and added more water I'm assuming because it tasted like it did prior to adding the red pepper.  \\n\\nMy friend, who is Asian, has had substantial experience working at all levels of the restaurant business and was utterly appalled by the experience.  She couldn't believe that the dining and kitchen area had a fly problem.  Not to mention the quality of the food.

The first was in Dallas and I was so impressed by everything (the food, employees, extras, the bed, room size, ect) there that I decided I would be loyal to Omni from now on. I should have stayed at a few more before deciding that. That amazing experience made this one seem awful.\\n\\nThe pros: \\nPrice is a good for a nice hotel downtown Austin.\\nWas offered a mini bottle of champagne (although terrible) at check in. \\nThe kids were delivered 3 Christmas brownies in the afternoon and milk and cookies at night. They were thrilled.\\nRoom is attractive and typical in size.\\n\\nThe cons:\\nCheck in clerk was quite, didn't tell us much, had the wrong room at first and forgot breakfast vouchers. I had to specifically ask everything, but she was smiling and polite about it. \\n\\nEmployees watched me struggle with my kids and the luggage rack and didn't offer to help or take it up for us. (this was done without our asking the first hotel)\\n\\nPool was really cold, not all indoors. Kids had fun but it was too cold for me. Would be awesome pool for summer.\\n\\nExtra terrible bed. I'm a side sleeper and both shoulders hurt so much all night, had to lay on my back to rest my shoulders many times which I didn't like either, both me and my son tossed and turned all night and gave up at 5am on sleep. First omni had an awesome bed.\\n\\nPretty small and dated bathtub/shower. This must vary room to room considering reviews, but my water pressure was really poor. I couldn't even rinse all of my conditioner out, my hair is oily right now. \\n\\n\\nThe food:\\n\\nThe Onion Creek Grill at dinner-\\nHad a very limited menu.  Service was very good, the food was mediocre. I had a pork chop which was just okay, with polenta which was not cooked well, was grainy and clumpy. I've had amazing polenta, this was poor cooking. The vegetables on the plate, however very few, were excellent and I wish I had a plate full of them instead of the polenta and pork.  My kids ordered pizza and neither of them ate much, I am assuming they were not impressed. It was a pretty pricey meal to leave anything other than very happy. (I was expecting much better bc the first Omni had an amazing restaurant where I had several wonderful meals.) \\n\\nOnion Creek Grill at breakfast-\\n(Keep in mind this was on Christmas Day, I would think they would put their best foot forward, try to make it a little special maybe?) \\nTerrible service and worse food. Waiter was a little absent, didn't ask us if we wanted to order anything from the kitchen (eggs, pancakes, waffles, ect.) that wasn't on the buffet table. I ended up asking someone else that works there who brought me coffee for him, which was awful, awful coffee. I drink Starbucks coffee several times a week. This didn't taste like that. Maybe a bad day?? I know some have been very pleased with it. I couldn't drink it. My kids all 3 filled their plates, and didn't eat a thing.  They all said the food was awful. I believed them because it looked awful. The biscuits were like rocks, quite literally, I know because I cut them up for my boys and it was REALLY hard to cut through them with just a butter knife. I thought soaking them in gravy would help, it didn't. My kids adore bacon, they all took a bite and said it was gross, it was mostly overcooked as were the sausage patties, the links were edible. The eggs were dry, I guess they should have just ate cold cereal. I had a veggie omelet (had to cover in salsa to eat it) and potatoes, the omelet was very dry and the potatoes were shriveled up old, dry potatoes, possibly frozen crap. My daughter ordered an omelet, too but tasted it and wouldn't eat it (she wouldn't eat the spicy salsa that made mine edible) I was really excited to have the breakfast buffet at the omni again because of the last one, it was beautiful, delicious, so fresh and huge. This one was more of a Holiday Inn continental breakfast as far as food quality goes. The one big plus I give them is that they had gluten free bread and cereal available and labeled. The bad though, it's right next to the other, which if you are easily sickened by cross contamination, it's very likely happening there. If I had paid $17 for each of us to eat there, I'd been ticked off and refusing to pay but it was included in the room package. The waiter never asked how the food was, and the Hostess didn't ask how everything was when we left. When we checked out, the front desk clerk didn't ask how our stay was. No one ever asked us how anything was, and I don't like to complain at the time, because I don't like to seem like I'm trying to get anything free. \\n\\nMorsels coffee shop- Really, really bad coffee but more drinkable than the grill. Plus side, carried cheap floaties for the pool and a great variety of drinks. \\n\\nSo overall, poor service, bad food, terrible bed and water pressure in a pretty nice building, beautiful pool and good location. I wouldn't stay here again due to the bed alone."},{"name":"Theo's Pizzeria Grill","address":"1157 Broadway","city":"Somerville","stars":"3","text":"Indeed Greg, this pizza is the bomb 5 stars in your faaaaaaaaaace.\\n\\nIt is so luxurious with the chicken and the pepp's and the roastedness and all the Nummy Nummies.

So good that I ordered Garlic Bread, as an app.\\n\\nThe prices blew me away. Frutta di Mare (Lobster, Shrimp, Scallops, Calamari, Mussels, and Oysters) with Fra Diavolo was EXCELLENT.

I ordered a side and he came back from the kitchen stating it was fried which I said was okay. He brought the plantains to the table and there were not hot and looked like they were dried, then fried. I called him over and told him these were more like plantain chips. He explained that he did not really know what plantain looked like.  I also suggested Rosa Mexicano is where to go for really good plantains.  He was really nice and took it off the check but this is the first Mexican restaurant I've been to here that did not serve fried plantain's guess it's more of a Caribbean dish.

The menu isn't overly huge, but there is enough of a selection.  I think they need to develop their flavor profile just a bit.  I had the buffalo chicken sandwich which was a piece of buffalo chicken with a slice of mozzarella on a roll.  I thought it strange that blue cheese wasn't served with it in any way.  The fries were decent, but not anything that I would rush back for.  My husband had the shrimp and scallop scampi.  He said the pasta tasted more like fish than the fish did...strange.  Also the scallops were cut in half lengthwise...I don't know if that was so they would cook faster, or it was to give the impression that there were twice as many scallops as there actually were.  The waitstaff was extremely friendly.  I think it's a nice place with potential, but they need to improve their menu selections.  If I wanted a piece of chicken with hot sauce and a piece of cheese, I can make that at home.  I want to be wowed and dazzled if I'm going out for dinner.

I love Caprial's. 1st class kitchen, fresh local NW cuisine, great desserts and, best of all..a retail wine wall! First, the wall. All the wines are up on a big wall so you can walk around and look at and hold and pick the wine you want instead of just looking at a list. Second, retail. That means instead of paying $25-$35 dollars for a bottle of wine you can buy at a wine shop for 10 bucks, you get a bottle of wine that costs  you $25-$35 at a wine shop. This is honesty, truly admirable and reflects their desire to have you drink great wine with their excellent food. The entree prices are a bit higher than they would be if they were making more money marking up cheaper wine but it's honest. Great place to take out of town guests for a quintessential NW dining experience.

We couldn't decide between appetizers, so we just ordered them all (except for the chowder, because we just didn't feel like having chowder), plus a glass each of their sparkling  wine, and called it dinner. Plus the Cured and Smoked Board to start. Good lord what a feast. In between appetizer courses we switched to IPAs (I know, quite a jump from sparkling wine, but the menu and our thirst level demanded it). Our server didn't blink. He advised us on beer pairing with a twinkle in his eye, and made sure timing was right so the table wouldn't be overwhelmed with plates. And what plates! That Cured and Smoked Board is to die for -- the uni toast is unctuous and decadent, and balanced well with the rest of the board, which includes bread, house-made pickles, and creme fraiche. The steamed mussels are savory, not overly salted (a common error), and spiked with coins of chorizo. The two salads were beautiful, so tasty, and perfectly dressed -- although the snap pea salad was a tad fibrous. The salmon collar? If you order no other app during your visit, order this one if it's available. It was cooked to tender, crisp-skinned perfection and served with a glaze that was a sweet-umami delight. Of course we had to try a dessert after dinner. If cheesecake is on the menu, and you like cheesecake, order it. It's custardy, luscious, and served with macerated strawberries and a cannelle of barely sweetened whipped cream.

This one is better than the one in Los Angeles, CA. I've had an annual pass for years. If you're in a group and aren't looking forward to standing in lines, take single riders. After all, you don't talk while on the ride anyway. You chat about the ride as soon as you get off, so save time and go single riders. \\nIf you're doing Men In Black, make sure to press the RED BUTTON when Will Smith tells you to, you'll get bonus points which pretty much guarantee you'll beat out everyone else in your car.\\nWhen doing Rip Ride Rockit, Google the secret song list. There are a lot of fun songs to listen to on that list. The downside is you can't purchase a video of it. You can still watch the video of yourself after the ride, but you won't be able to purchase the video with that song playing. If you don't plan on buying the video, then secret song list it! To get to the secret song list keypad on the ride, as SOON as you sit down (this is important, you only have so much time. Stay patient, if you freak out, you could miss it and be put with a random song). Okay, so back to what I was saying...as soon as you sit down, press and HOLD the Rip Ride RockIt logo on the TOP of your screen. Hold it for 10 seconds, count and be patient. Then let go and a keypad will pop up. Type in the number that you saw on the secret song list you Googled, then press #. Your song will start playing. Very fun and exciting to get a song that works just for you. Makes the ride fun and refreshing EVERY time. If you care about where the camera is, it's when you go inside of the building as you approach The Mummy ride.

I had had their pork schnitzel-type sandwich a few times and it is delicious, but I always passed on the burgers until recently.

Ugh, I am so pig-headed sometimes. \\n\\nSee, the original burger (Galesburger as they call it) is a masterpiece of simplicity. Burger Guild uses hormone free, grass fed yadda yadda yadda beef and puts the cheese inside the burger. I repeat, INSIDE the burger -and it's fantastic. They'll grill up some onions to top it with if you ask, and you should. Topped with their house sauce, lettuce and tomato and you've got yourself burger nirvana. I had it twice in one week it's that good.\\n\\nI've only tried the original, but there are a number of other varieties. They have burgers of the month - this month's features bacon jam and green chiles, unless you are dead inside should make you drool a smidge. \\n\\nAll the burgers come with crinkle fries like your babysitter used to make (just me?

The state is littered with top-notch BBQ. The Salt Lick isn't simply a restaurant, rather a destination, a place all visitors and locals should eat at once. But, keep in mind, this spot isn't a secret. Nearly every BBQ TV show has featured it, it's a resident in magazine/newspaper articles that focus on the country's top BBQ spots and sees a massive number of visitors - and for a good reason. \\n\\nFor many, the allure of Salt Lick is as rewarding as the meat. Upon entrance visitors stroll past a huge pit filled with piles of smoked sausage, ribs and brisket. Set atop a wood fire it's a treat to simply watch the pit master stab and grab meat (like you'd see at Rudy's), slice and send it towards tables. Thousands of photos of this appear on social media, in magazines/newspapers and on TV. It's a special scene. \\n\\nYou won't be here alone, even if you arrive at 3pm on a weekday. Salt Lick is practically a Texas landmark and visitors from worldwide come here. In fact, people snapping selfies with food and taking photos of their ribs is the norm. There's several huge dining areas, but fortunately, quality isn't sacrificed with volume. While the sides are average, the BBQ isn't. \\n\\nThe Salt Lick doesn't lure customers with a dozen different meats and sides. They focus on a few things and succeed at always producing top-notch chicken, brisket, ribs and smoked sausage (they didn't have turkey the last time we were here, but did historically). The brisket is tender, smokey, but does need to be doused in their sauce (there's two available on the table) to enjoy most. It's not the country's best brisket (try the Smokin Pig and Pompous Pig in South Carolina and you'll agree) but it is very good. The smoked sausage, on the other hand, will win awards and the half chicken comes juicy and packed with flavor. \\n\\nMeanwhile, the desserts will wow you, if you have enough space left to cram them down. We were stuffed but couldn't leave without trying a slide of pecan, chocolate pecan and cobbler (they make a half and half - half blackberry/peach). All the desserts are excellent. \\n\\nHands down, when within driving distance of Austin/San Antonio or anywhere in the Hill Country a trip to Salt Lick is a must, just like one should always visit a Rudy's. It's part of the Texas culture and will be stamped in your mind forever, even after one visit."},{"name":"Anthology","address":"4808 SE Woodstock Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"Foodcart with a 2x picnic table for eating on site.

He says roast beef will be fine, pastrami, sliced steak...\\" -- The West Wing: Season 1, Episode 19\\n\\nYou all know me and know I love a good sammie - my father and grandfather were the kings of the sandwich. So when it comes to a true Deli - my dad's side of the family is Jewish - I know when someone is doing it right. Reuben's has broken the code, my friends.\\n\\nFirst, finding this place is weird. It is at the end of a maze of one-way streets and you are convinced you are driving down alleyways to get there. Second, parking sucks. You'll have to find street parking a block or so away (but luckily it is all tied to the Park Mobile app, so it's easy to pay with your phone) and huff it over. There are 3 spots to park out front - also paid, but odds are they will be taken and you will have to circle another few times to find a place. So don't bother to chance it - just park when you find a spot and walk.\\n\\nWhen you walk in, you immediately smell all those familiar smells - roasted turkey, pastrami, spicy mustard, rye bread, etc. You know you are in the right place for a delightfully filling sandwich. The menu is filled with the standard run-of-the-mill selections, but then there are their specialities. Trust me, they are worth it (and HUGE). Since it was my first visit, I opted for the Eastsider. This meant I could get both pastrami and corned beef - hot. They top it with 1000 Island dressing and coleslaw. You select the bread you want (I opted for rye, but then later realized they had marbled rye) and they make it fresh while you wait. I also ordered a knish and a bag of chips (they sell Zapp's, but did not have voodoo, my favorite) and a drink.  \\n\\nThe sandwich came up almost immediately - impressive since I showed up with 11 people - but had to wait a which for my knish. We sat in the back of the place and took up 3 tables.  The sandwich was huge and so full of flavor. The saltiness and meatiness of the two beefs with the sweetness from the dressing and the crunchiness of the slaw - add in the caraway bite from the rye bread and I think I had the perfect sandwich.  By the end, I was eating it with a knife and fork as the slaw had soaked into the bread so much, but that bread was some of the best I have eaten. They so not skimp on ingredients here.  \\n\\nThe knish - pronounced KA-nish - is a fried dough stuffed with mashed potato (sometimes meat) that is a polish street food. Often accompanied with a spicy mustard, it is a personal favorite of mine. I ended up devouring it and skipping the chips (officially not a fan of the Zapp's sour cream and onion). I was so full when I had finished my sandwich and knish that those chips were not needed. The iced tea was fresh brewed and free refills were included.\\n\\nMy sandwich was $7.19 and to upsize that to a combo was just $2.29 more. Adding in the knish was $2.69. I probably would have saved $1 skipping the chips that I ended up throwing away. But with tip $15 for lunch is not bad at all considering how much food I got, plus the free refills - a great deal and amazing food.

I highly recommend going for the family style all you can eat.   At $18.95 (and don't forget, you brought your own beer) it is a bargain by all accounts.   All you can eat brisket, sausage and pork ribs along with some fantastic sides (beans, potato salad, cole slaw, sesame bread, pickles and onions).

Hecks yes!\\n\\nAll I wanted to do was buy more.  But instead I stopped myself, and ran 5 miles to try to burn off half the calories I had just ingested.  The things I do for foodie love. \\n\\nI'll definitely be back.

Nothing too bad about it, but nothing that made it stand out from the crowd.\\n\\nThe ambiance is pretty good. They are going for that 70's vibe and it works for the space. Even when full the place was still quiet and felt kind of empty. The wait staff was almost too attentive as they seemed like they were anxious to make this a good experience. It is still relatively new so that might have something to do with it. For a Friday night there didn't seem to be that much of a buzz around the place. You would think this would draw some of the after work crowd and they were noticibly absent.\\n\\nThe pricing is consistent with the area, but not really justified by the selection. The drink menu was verging on being nice, and probably would be if they had 4-5 more beers on tap. The food selection was similar in that there didn't seem to be that many options for a place that calls itself a tapas bar. What they did have was good. The meatballs were excellent. One of the great things about tapas is that you can try a small quantity of a lot of things and this place failed me in that regard. If this place want to go high end, which it's pricing and demeanor indicates, then they need to push things a bit more. So far this is a good start to a restaurant, but not one you would tell your friends about afterwards."},{"name":"Burger Tex","address":"5420 Airport Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"Service has a lot to do with a business.

A customer left after informing him that he just lost a customer because of his rude behavior. He said you all can go eat anywhere you want. They lost another 2 customers.

The polenta is nice and creamy and the tomato sauce is tangy, not too sweet. \\n\\nAll of their pasta (except the gluten free) is homemade and cooked to perfection. My favorite pasta dish is definitely the carbonara. I had it the first time I came here and everyone at my table kept trying to get bites because it was so good. I had to physically guard my plate in order to eat in peace. Ultimately, that same group decided to make a repeat trip to Terramia so everyone else could get their own plate of the carbonara; I got the gnocchi amatriciana that time, which is also fantastic. The mushroom and asparagus risotto with truffle oil is amazing--there's just enough truffle oil that it has a nice flavor, but isn't overpowering or greasy.\\n\\nAnd for dessert I always get the tiramisu. \\n\\nThe only other restaurant in the North End with a comparable atmosphere is Trattoria di Monica's--I would say they're tied for #1 favorite restaurant in the area. Terramia is small and cozy, it makes you feel as though you're dining in someone's home, and the decor has the feeling of either a wine cellar or ancient stucco home in Tuscany. \\n\\n***The one point I'd take off from this place is their pasta flight \\"deal\\" on Monday nights. I went a few months ago with a friend to check it out, because it seemed like a nice way to try a few different things on their menu. Excluding the open face scallop ravioli, you can create a flight from any 3 of their pasta dishes for $25--but that is actually more expensive than any single pasta dish on their menu, and the collective amount of pasta in the flight is not nearly as large as any single pasta dish. Not worth it in price in my opinion, even though, as usual, all the flight components were delicious."},{"name":"Pambiche","address":"2811 NE Glisan St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"The mix of sweet and spice made my mouth water.

Alot of people rave about their pizza and so I decided to put it through the ringer, ordering from their Newbury St. location 7 times over the past 4 months.  \\n\\nI noticed that many of the negative reviews complain that the Upper Crust pizza is crust-less and that all pizza should have it.  Cuisine is a constantly evolving beast and pizza is no exception.  Pizza in Italy vary from region to region and in the United States, shrewd restaurant owners cater to their clientele's tastes while chefs will experiment with new cooking methods to create something unique.  That's what the Upper Crust attempts to do.  The pizza is best described as more of a new age \\"gourmet\\" pizza.  It tries to separate itself from the old school places like Pizzeria Regina and the mom/pop pizza and sub shops by offering a thin crust baked to a crispy texture with a mix of traditional and non-traditional toppings.  It's a carb-conscious world out there and some diners don't want to be weighed down by alot of dough by the end of the meal.  I originally thought that the crumbs on the bottom of the pizza were just an anomaly, but all of my pizza slices and calzones had it.  I wasn't a big fan of this as it pretty much tasted like a chimney sweep from Mary Poppins decided to brush the pie before serving it to me.\\n\\nThe toppings are generous and they offer some interesting combinations.The service is curt but fast.  The Newbury St. location has a problem with air quality as well; smoke from the ovens weren't   venting properly and tended to fill the entire restaurant until the workers opened both doors.  I wasn't too thrilled with that. \\n\\nI can see why people rave about the Upper Crust: it's new and trendy so it attracts the younger crowd who are looking for some pizzazz.  If you're a Newbury St. type, you'll probably enjoy the place and fit right in.  Honestly though, I prefer a less pretentious place and look for good value.  Service, even for takeout, is mediocre.  The pizza isn't consistent enough (even for what they're trying to do) for my tastes.  The pizza's one of the most expensive pies I've ever scene My girlfriend and I ordered two large specialty pizzas for a small group of friends and ended up paying close to 45 dollars for them.

We were a challenge because a couple, originally included, had transportation issues which delayed us.  Allison at the reception stand was upbeat, flexible, and ultimately welcoming. We were eating lightly because of the impending party list.  \\n\\nThe raw bar reminds of the ICO parent; and is a near-par.  The Raw 34s (the lead oyster) as another reviewer has noted are suspension versions of the Island Creek.  Be sure to try mixed pairs to teach yourself the difference between nature nurtured and a master's hand. We had six different oysters each then voted for our favorite and closed out a dozen apiece.  The tarragon vinagrette  was splendid with my favorite.\\n\\nWe paired the bivalves with a delicious cremant by Mulin.  It was an extraordinary value under $50.  Minor, and practically only, complaint was that it was featured but not cold. I was looking for a 4.5 rating.\\n\\nOne of us had the Hake, pan-sauteed perfectly.  The fish flaked onto our knives and exploded on the palate. I love the fish, but it's rarely available.  The best I've ever had was on a sailboat off an island in Maine.  This was second only to that. My mackerel tartare (Sorry, it's a fetish...I'd never had it before, and therefore had to try it.) was intriguing...not a replacement for hamachi, but a very good idea. Our third diner had little necks that were completely competent, but didn't play on a par with the other two.\\n\\nNick, our server, was a gem.  Ask for him.  He doesn't have years of experience,but he's upbeat, intelligent, hustles and really wants you to have a good time.  \\n\\nBecause we were on a bubbly track, we didn't sample further in the wine list or the beer selection.  I'd price Row34 at a little less than ICOB, probably because the wine list isn't as far-reaching (There's always been a fresh face at ICOB that has convinced me that my life would be changed by experiencing one bottle or other....and unfortunately, so far, they've been quite correct.)\\n\\n I'm going back very soon to expand my experience with the kitchen (the menu changes frequently with the catch available), and hope to be able to compare the Row to ICOB directly , so don't so many of you respond to this review that I can't get back in."},{"name":"Giacomo's Ristorante - Boston","address":"355 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"On our last full day in Boston we decided to do the line.

But first, I wanted to give you my, uh, first impression of this place in the hopes that they'll read this and I'll be able to notch my updated review a star or two.\\n\\nThe Porter is a good addition to L5P.  So it's no Brewhouse or EAYC, but I wouldn't view it spo much as competition as another reason to hang out in L5P after dark.  A friend called The Porter \\"a poor man's Brickstore\\" (referencing the infamous Decatur beer haus), but with the economy being the way it is, I think poor describes many of us at this point.\\n\\nI've eaten/been drunk in every business that's been in this cursed spot since the Bridgetown Grill was here.  Bridgetown, Mangrove Alley, Grandma Luke's and now the Porter.  Based on my memory of each restaurant, the owners have done a great job renovating the space.  They took an oddly shaped area and made it their own without any of the baggage (wait, maybe that's not a good word to use) of the old businesses.\\n\\nYeah, I should've used a different word than \\"baggage\\" seeing as how luggage seems to be the overarching theme of the place.  This seems to bug reviewer Sean, but I don't mind it.  In fact, considering the name of the place, I think it's pretty clever.  I could tell a lot of effort and love had been put into the bar even before the doors opened.  We loved the beer and the prices weren't completely outrageous.  Many beers were there to be tried and try we did.  We picked and chose, picked and chose and realized that we were drunk about four iterations in.  Nice. \\n\\nSo why only three stars in this go around?  First, I expected a little more from the food, considering the pedigree of the kitchen.  The fish and chips were all right, but to tell the truth, O'Terrill's is still better.  The shrimp BLT was also strange.  When we got over the initial shock of mayo-covered shrimp (I know, I know, the menu says it comes with \\"lemon aioli,\\" but c'mon, it's mayo and it covered the shrimp), it had a decent taste.  But it was somehow heavier than the menu read and  heavier than we were expecting.  Just wasn't expecting a shrimp salad sandwich which is what it turned out to be.\\n\\nMost of all, the service still needs a bit of work.  Our beer was served with more head than (insert fellatio pun here.)  For a beer pub, that's pretty lame dudes.  Not to mention our glasses weren't wiped down at all from the head that flowed over the rim.  In fact, the sticky beer residue didn't even seem to warrant notice.  \\"Uh, can I get a napkin please?\\"\\n\\n\\"Yeah, we're gonna get some coasters soon.\\"\\n\\nHmmmm.....don't know how coasters are going to clean the beer off the side of my glass, but thanks for the info.\\n\\nThree tentative stars for the Porter.  I'm pulling for you guys and will be trying you again soon.  I also know it's pretty early on, so hopefully you can fix some of these glitches.  I'll just leave this one as a to be continued...."},{"name":"The Lower Depths","address":"476 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I love this place.\\nI worked in Kenmore Square for about 2 years, and this had become my regular spot for a while.\\nAn original tap-room; seasonal beers are spectacular and the food is phenomenal.

Excellent falafel, good prices, fast service, and The King really is one of the friendliest guys in Boston.\\n\\nUnfortunately, it feels like that wonderful falafel is only about 25% of a falafel sandwich.  Most of it is lettuce, tomato, and bread.  And unfortunately, those parts tend to be pretty bland at Falafel King.  The bread is dry and kind of hard.  The lettuce tastes like... water, really.  The tomatoes aren't much better.  And this all really takes away from the falafel.\\n\\nMost of the vegetarian selections suffer this problem.  There has to be a better way to deliver falafel to my mouth!  I wouldn't have a second thought about paying, say, $6 or $7 for a sandwich with higher-quality, tastier ingredients.

After reading through numerous amazing Yelp reviews and contemplating on where to go to celebrate our two year anniversary, we decided to come on a Sunday to sit at Chef's Table for their Chef's Whim, 6 course tasting served only after 9:00pm.  \\n\\nWe had made reservations a week in advance on OpenTable for 9:30pm.  Craigie on Main has a $25 reservation policy: If you cancel over 24 hours in advance, you will not be charged $25. If you cancel less than 24 hours in advance and they are able to fill the originally reserved table with another party, you will also not be charged $25.  However, if they cannot find a replacement for your less than 24 hour cancelled reservation, you will be billed $25 which goes toward a Craigie on Main gift card to be used at another time.\\n\\nAs a side tip and much research on their website, you can also book a table on a sponsored app called Reserve.  Through this app, you are able to manage your reservation and even pay your bill through the app.  A perk?  The code, boston25ah, gets you $25 credit to spend at any partnered restaurants, including Craigie.  \\n\\nStreet parking is available after 6pm, valet available for dinner service for $12, or nearby paid public parking lots.  \\n\\nOn the day of our reservation, snowstorm Juno had just arrived. We were able to park in the valet lot for free due to lack of street parking, which we had appreciated.  We were surprised that Craigie had a fair amount of people dining despite all the snow.  We were brought to Chef's Table, which allowed us to get a birds eye view of their open kitchen.  We were given complementary glasses of champagne for our two year anniversary and some rather hard chunks of bread rolls with butter to start.\\n\\nBy sitting at Chef's Table, we were able to see every little thing. I thought that all the small details that goes into making one tasting dish is phenomenal.  That aside, we felt cheated with our meal.  Other patrons of chef's whim got a variety of excellent courses, including a pan seared salmon for one course, pork three ways, or frog legs.   We would have been thrilled to get any of the three but instead got none.  It was as if the kitchen had ran out of food, and instead scrambled up the left overs, tried to compose it in a dish, and served it to us.  Details out of our courses include::\\n\\nAmuse Bouche: Raw oyster with kumquat, appleback roe, kelp\\nCourse 1: Sashimi of diver scallop, sea trout roe, avocado, lemon anglaise\\nCourse 2: Veloute of turnip, sausage, crab meat, trumpet mushroom\\nCourse 3: Ragout of lentils, bacon, butternut squash puree, and a farm fresh poached egg\\nCourse 4: Beef sirloin, veal sausage, broccoli rabe, fingerling potatoes\\nPre-dessert: Almond ice cream, cranberry sorbet, candied almonds, orange foam\\nCourse 5: Black tahini chocolate cake and warm apple fritters with a whiskey ice cream\\nPost meal: Homemade orange spiced marshmallow cube\\n\\nLet's break down the meal and talk about the few pros and many disappointments:\\n-The oyster was not freshly shucked, rather it was pre-shucked, placed back into a half oyster shell, then garnished with the accompaniments which all tasted \\"ok\\".\\n- The veloute reminded me of a chowder or soup, which was actually pretty tasty\\n- The ragout course was probably the most disappointing.  After seeing other awesome protein dishes go out, you give us beans and an egg as a course?  Not impressed.\\n- The beef was flavorless and actually tough to cut into.  Potatoes and broccoli rabe uninspiring\\n- What's MOST upsetting?  Craigie considered the amuse bouche + pre dessert as one course.\\n\\nAt $57 per person for pretentious, flavorless food, we left unsatisfied and upset.  The only highlight of the meal at all was probably the apple fritters and the free homemade marshmallow at the end.  I understand that the concept is chef's whim and you are served whatever he feels like making, but it felt pretty terrible to receive left over stuff no one else wanted."},{"name":"The Salty Pig","address":"130 Dartmouth St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"My family and I went for an early dinner.

We ordered the Prosciutto Di Parma, Parmesan Cheese, and for a side we ordered the fig jam. The dish known as the meat and cheese plate also included house made pickles made in the restaurant. The service was very good and the food came out fast. The dish came out on a cutting board and the meat, cheeses, and sides were all separated, The Prosciutto Di Parma tasted like a meat from Italy. It was amazing. The Parmesan Cheese tasted like a perfect fresh hard cheese. The fig jam complemented the meat and cheese perfectly and the pickles were incredible. The most unique pickles ive ever tasted with amazing seasoning. My wife ordered the ravioli which was also very good. It was filled with a potato with a smoky like taste. After that the main dish was the salty pig pizza which was also very unique and included a variation of types of meats, a mixture of mozzerella and parmesan cheese, and a caramel beer sauce.

Add-on options include a choice of farro, quinoa or rice for grains and shrimp, salmon cakes, chicken, tofu or egg for additional protein and heartiness. I opted out of the grain option but the portion is certainly enough for a filling meal. Of note, the Brussels were a little on the crunchy side...could have used a touch more time either by blanching them prior or just a few more minutes in the roasting pan. \\n\\nBut all in all this place is so great.

I recently went to this location for the first time. I live in North Reading and North Reading needed a new place like this. This was a brilliant idea to put the Place on the map. My wife,1 year old and I went in and was graciously seated by the friendly hostess. The place was very busy on a sunday afternoon. The big room on the right when you walked was having some sort of what I believe was sporting banquet or event of some kind. There was over 30 plus kids and adults. The owner (Bob) who was actively working and overseeing his establishment greeted us at our table and was very kind and informative to our questions. He stated to me that the star burst martini was a good choice....He was \\"right\\", It hit the spot and was something diffrent. Our waitress (forgot her name) was \\"on the ball\\" and eager to take our drink order as well as our appetizer and dinner order. We ordered the basic hamburger,haddock sandwich and a crab cake appetizer. The food was cooked perfectly and was hot when served. We had our little one with us so it made things interesting as far as who got to eat first. (but we made it through)  The place is new and from what I can see will be a very sucessful buisness. Everyone who was working there was hard at work and tending to there customers without delay.  My wife and I will be back soon to enjoy more of there hot and delicious food.(we probably will get a baby sitter) so we can both enjoy a martini that the owner reccomends.

However, my last experience here was so terrible, it makes me think about wanting to return. \\n\\nWe got there for Brunch at 11 AM on a Sunday. They told us we'd have a 20-25 minutes wait. No problem, typical In a Pickle. After 45 minutes, I asked the hostess how much longer. Apparently, someone had written down the wrong pager number, and paged a party who had been there much later than us, and had given them our table. Multiple parties were then seated in front of us. The hostess assured me that we would have the next table for two. After 20 MORE minutes, and again multiple parties being seated in front of us, my boyfriend got up and asked the hostess what was going on. We were eventually seated. \\n\\nI got ready to order my favorite In a Pickle Meal -- Eggs in a Basket. Because I am a vegetarian, sub fruit for meat, and because I HATE home fries, sub regular fries for home fries. As a Sunday Brunch regular, this is something I have ordered, for both takeout and eat in, MANY times. However, the waitress told me that there were no substitutions. When I informed her that I had eaten this meal many times before, she said, that was impossible. She refused to let me order what I wanted, unless I was willing to pay for each item. SO... add 6 dollars to my meal to substitue for food I am not actually putting on my plate or eating. \\n\\nAll in all, I enjoyed my eggs in a basket, but I left unsatisfied, because that was all I had to eat (you know, since I couldn't get fruit or french fries). After a bad hostess, and a bad waitress, I'll think twice about coming back.

It was enough for the both of us. To be honest, their menu was a bit on the pricier side considering I've had similar food at a cheaper price. (FYI - Tacos should not cost $4). Anyways, our food was served in a lava bowl with sides of sour cream, (MORE!) guac, spicy rice, pico, and tortillas. We finished it all! We also had to order drinks - the tequila gods persuaded us - and boy they were strong. Another FYI they don't come in the color you think they do. Your raspberry mojito will come green - not red.

Also, seitan is the best substance to cook with, hands down.\\n\\nBut I digress.  The \\"steak\\" was delicious, and the trifecta of tastes was absolutely for the win.  It was a special, so hopefully it'll be making the rounds this winter as it's the perfect hearty beat-down-the-weather-blues kind of comfort food.\\n\\nWe topped the meal off with the raspberry chocolate cake, and while I was a tiny bit critical of its moistness (I do a lot of vegan baking myself), it was still quite delicious and topped with a dollop of something vegan cream cheesy, and man, I want to know what that was because I've been fantasizing about using it in a vegan cheesecake.  Raspberry and chocolate belong together, and, they don't need to involve eggs or milk to bring them into a perfect, delectable harmony.  Just sayin'.\\n\\nI will also mention that the ambiance and service were A+.  Very pleasant, smiling staff.  Clean, orderly, with a shock of lime green (just how I like my decor), and an appreciated ethos for customer/planet health.  I hope places like this become the norm/new trend. \\n\\nSeriously, check this place out!"},{"name":"Row 34","address":"383 Congress St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Full disclosure: we only had oysters (a lot of oysters- but just oysters) and beers here. \\n\\nThe atmosphere is great.  The place looks awesome inside.  The beer selection is fabulous and so is the raw bar selection.  Oysters were wicked fresh.  \\n\\nThe only drawback we had was the service.  We weren't super impressed with our server and maybe it's because they were annoyed we weren't ordering dinner (though we ordered 36 oysters and a few beers) but they were very condescending almost and just left a bad taste in my mouth. I'd probably head somewhere else before coming back here because of that.  I get that everyone has an off night, I'd just prefer it to not be the night I go to a restaurant for the first time."},{"name":"Rocco's Tacos & Tequila Bar","address":"7468 W Sand Lake Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"This is my favorite Mexican food.

Our Diavola pizza was not \\"hot right out of the oven\\" and showed up literally 2 minutes after we sat down. The pizza was still good, but it was not as great as it used to be.\\nAlso, the person taking the order at the front was not friendly at all. We tried asking questions about pizzas, and got short abrupt answers: it felt like this person was annoyed with us and didn't want to be there. I feel that for the price we paid for the pizza, we deserved a warmer welcome. \\nWe will come back to Antico, but not very soon -- we were a bit disappointed today."},{"name":"Kal√©","address":"50 SW Pine St, Ste 102","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"The owners is ridiculously nice and the food is out of this world!

I must say that she was the most patient and easy person to work with!  I had a ton of questions and many detailed requests - floral arrangements, placecard holders, cake from outside, but she was always prompt and patient with her responses.  What I appreciated the most though was that unlike other restaurants I've talked to, she never tried to up-sell me anything. I was a little nervous before the reception about whether things would work out well but on the day of the wedding, it looked absolutely stunning. \\n\\nThe guests all complimented on the ambience and the food portions were quite generous.

For my last week in Boston, I decided to give the much discussed Giacomo's a go. We waited in line for a little over an hour for a group of five. I expected this and didn't mind the wait because I figured it would be worth it. \\n\\nWe finally got inside and were seated and hastily run through the menu after establishing we had never been there before. Less than two minutes later our waitress returned to ask if we were ready. We were not but we ordered a bottle of wine and some garlic bread.\\n\\nThe wine was bad. $19 a bottle should be decent wine- this tasted like box wine. Not good at all. The pasta dishes were good, but nothing spectacular. I've had better across the street. \\n\\nOur entire dining experience lasted maybe 40 minutes. Our party could barely talk to each other because the restaurant was so loud and our waitress was rushing us through our meal. I couldn't even enjoy my food.\\n\\nI honestly don't understand the line for this place- the food was good (and the only reason this place is getting 2 stars instead of 1) but for a $25 per person meal, I should be able to enjoy myself and not feel like I am being chased out. I also didn't appreciate that gratuity was \\"included\\" for parties of 5. I've never heard of this practice and am pretty sure that was just because no one tips them for their terrible service.

I'm very glad I did as the bartender was very helpful!\\n\\n Hailing from Chicago, I haven't tried a variety of oysters but he helped me pick out a few that are popular. I'm a beer drinker but never know what to order, so the bartender asked what type of beer I liked and poured me two samples before I ordered. Small acts like that scream volumes about an establishment and their staff. \\n\\nThe food was fantastic. I couldn't get enough of the tacos!
