Pickles, onions, and pickled jalapenos (at an extra charge) are available with white bread, so you get your standard BBQ garnishes. \\n      We had the coleslaw which was perfect to balance the richness of the meat and potato salad because, who doesn't have potato salad with BBQ?\\n      We also had a pecan mini pie (all the choices sounded great) that was delicious.\\n      The atmosphere is fun, and you will always have to wait so bring a chair and a cooler of beer and relax!

We arrived on a Tuesday at 8:30 in September and were the first round of people who got a seat and BBQ. The line can wrap around the building, and yes they can sell out before you get any BBQ. This tends to happen during peak travel times for Austin like the Spring and Summer or for festivals like Austin City Limits in the Fall or SXSW in the Spring.\\n       If you are lucky, you may get a free mini chopped beef sammie while you wait.

I had to carry a suitcase with me and they were able to roll this away to the back so that it wasn't in the way. I didn't even mention it, they just kind of asked and then took care of it for me. They were also super attentive with getting me water and keep us updated with our food. \\n\\nPrice & Food: \\nPrice was amazing. I don't know how they make money with the price being so low with such high quality food. My friend and I got a pull porked sandwich with sweet potato fries and the bread pudding.

It just finished making so it was very warm and nice with the whip cream :) \\n\\nThe pulled pork sandwich was huge! My friend and I ended up sharing it together and splitting this was just right the amount for the both of us. The pork was well done with amazing cole slaw inside. I ended up eating too fast because of the long wait for the food, but it was well worth it. Potato fries on the side also did justice for the long wait.

I had my wedding reception/banquet here recently.   Where do I begin to describe the awful service & treatment that was given to me by the manager, Mr. Chan. The only time he was nice & accommodating was when I met with him to discuss the details of our wedding banquet & to give him a deposit for the night. Once he got the money from my wedding deposit, it was all downhill from there. First off, he had originally OFFERRED the nicer and more private area in the back of the restaurant for our function & we agreed to this. We thought it would be great as the dance floor location was better, more private, & it was a better area for my DJ to set up his equipment.  \\n\\nWhen we arrived to the restaurant on our wedding day, the WRONG area of the restaurant was set up for us!! The area Mr.Chan originally OFFERRED & PROMISED to us (in the back of the restaurant) was changed to the area at the entrance/front of the restaurant.... strike 1.  As I got out of my limo in front of the restaurant, I noticed the wrong area was set up even before I walked in. It was the most AWFUL feeling on such a joyous day!!!! I walked in, went up to Mr. Chan & asked him about the wrong tables being set up, he rudely DENIED the fact that that he had set up the wrong area of the restaurant!!  He brushed my shoulder as he stormed off & walked away from me... strike 2.  We arrived with our wedding party before 5pm and my dinner was planned for 6:30p.  I only had 15 tables total of guests/family and I asked if he could do the right thing and set up the 15 tables in the back of the restaurant before my guests arrived... He said NO! My wedding party offered to help the waitstaff move the table settings for the 15 tables and Mr. Chan said NO!  I spoke to multiple members of his staff and they were all willing to make it right but Mr. Chan would not allow it!  We witnessed members of his staff telling him that he is doing the wrong thing & he argued with his staff in front of me and my family!! Rude. Unprofessional. Awful. A few of my family members confronted him and he ADMITTED that he does not remember offering me the back of the restaurant and he did not \\"make note of it in his book\\"!! He also said that he had given away my reserved space to a group of Chinese tourists who all then arrived in tour buses!!!!! Over 100 tourists had to enter the restaurant and parade past me and all my guests to get to the area in the back of the restaurant (which was originally reserved for our wedding).... strike 3.  My family had to ASK him and TELL him that he needed to set up partitions so that we could have some privacy as multiple tourists were taking pictures of me and my guests!!.... strike 4. \\n\\nI also noticed 16 tables instead of 15 tables were set up and I mentioned this to Mr. Chan as I did not want to be charged an extra table's worth of food. His response in Chinese: \\"What's it matter? You still have what you need!\\". I told him I didn't want the kitchen staff to make more food than necessary & I didn't want to get charged extra. He shook his head as if I was bothering him and waved me to go away.... strike 5.\\n\\nWe dropped off our own beer/liquor at the restaurant the night before so it could get chilled for our dinner. When we arrived to the restaurant, we noticed that the cases of beer we brought in the day before were NOT CHILLED and were all sitting in boxes on the dance floor?!?!... strike 6. They weren't even on tables!! I bet the health department would not be ok with drinks being placed on the floor. I confronted Mr.Chan about that as they were about to serve warm beer to my guests & he yelled at the waitstaff to ice all the beer. Yes, he yelled at his staff in front of my guests & family!! The waiters brought out folding tables with tupperware bins filled with ice for the beer. They set up these tables on the dance floor!! I asked him where my guests were going to dance now? I told him if they had chilled the beer as promised the night before or even that morning then this would not be an issue! Mr. Chan said \\"there was no room in the refrigerator\\"?!? I told him if he was unable to chill the beer then he should have never told us that he could do it. I told him he had an obligation to tell me the truth instead of misleading me that it would be taken care of. \\n\\nThe food was ok. Although, they did skimp on my bird's nest dish which was supposed to be made of taro (I specifically asked for it), they made it with egg noodles instead!... strike 7.  We had to ask 3-4 times for take out containers to be given to my guests before they actually got them... strike 8. They also tried to keep the rest of my wedding cake.. until my maid of honor told them to please box it up!!.. strike 9.\\n\\nWhen it was time to tally the bill at the end of the night, Mr.Chan sat annoyingly with his legs wide open, pounded his hand on the table and said \\"let's just get this done!\\"...

That teacher always gave me the chills.\\n\\nAnd I ordered the Pad See Ew with beef. Noodles. First choice. No second guessing. Teacher would be proud.\\n\\nThey were awesome. Picked up some fried wontons, too, and they too were delicious. Pad See Ew is never the prettiest dish, and this was no exception. But it was as delicious as it was ugly. Perfect flavor, perfect spiciness. (I ordered it \\"hot\\".) Wontons were crunchy, the chicken was tender, and the sauce was tasty. My only complaint, (and I think I read it in another review,) is that the beef was a tad bit chewy. Wasn't enough to scare me off, though.\\n\\nLong story short, I'll be back. Often. I love seeing small, friendly, quality places like this survive.\\n\\nEvernote Food Notes: https://www.evernote.com/shard/s3/sh/9af8f408-0f0d-4912-84ce-03326f781874/a32d6bd71930c2068cfebc21f7aed28f"},{"name":"Cypress Street Pint & Plate","address":"817 W Peachtree St NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Great hangout, great crowd.

That being said, I have been going to this place for about a year now and can give you my perspective as a repeat customer.\\n\\nWonderful sandwiches, with great meat, fillings, and bread. What else could you ask for when analyzing the quality of a deli? For non-bread eaters (I feel for you in the most heartfelt way), you can grab a salad to calm your growling stomach, though I cannot tell you how those are because I always go for sandwiches.\\n\\nMy favorite is the Bachelor Brunch, which is a grilled sandwich on pumpernickel with bacon, hard-boiled egg, jalape√±o peppers, Swiss cheese, and mustard. I always have to press a few napkins to this, as some kind of fat is slathered on the bread prior to it hitting the panini press. This makes me feel slightly better about myself and once I devour my sandwich and usually a slice of cake, I pat myself on the back for having taken off about 10 calories. Others that I have tried and loved are the Continental (sans onions) and Rebel Reuben. \\n\\nSpeaking of cakes, their cake slices and cupcakes are fantastic. I am not exaggerating. The portions are generous and the cake itself is always perfect moist with a wonderfully delicate crumb. I've tried the yellow cake with chocolate frosting and red velvet varieties. This place absolutely rivals the cake shop down the street on Mount Vernon Highway, of which I have a pretty high opinion. If you want brownies and cookies, those are also available. I think I tried a chocolate chip cookie once upon a time, but it did not really stand out. If you want dessert, get cake. Be a cake monster, rather than a cookie one.\\n\\nWhile never looking too hard at these options, it seems that Wrights Gourmet has trays available for parties and such. Their catering menu reveals that you can order things like the Chilled Beef Tenderloin Platter, Stuffed Mushrooms, Lemon BBQ Drummettes, and Savannah Marinated Shrimp, in addition to other items.

The chana salad was just okay for me since I don't really like chickpeas. The plantain chips were a nice snack. You're supposed to dip them in the jerk mayo to give it a slightly spicy and salty flavour. Otherwise, they don't have much flavour. The jerk wings were the best of the platter.

You sit down and a basket of corn muffins and homemade biscuits magically appear at your table.  Totally starting out right! We had the pimento cheese with house-made pickles to start. I am a huge pimento cheese fan,  and this was a perfect portion to split between me andb the hubs. Actually we split an order of the fried chicken and waffles too.

It's a great deal considering coffee and appetizer are included for only $7.95.  The tapas apps on Monday nights are also a great deal if you get the platter of 10, it's only $5.  However I've eaten brunch here too often and find I'm getting bored - the menu hasn't changed in the last year.  Recently I had a small, meh fruit salad app (instead of the slightly decadent, super sweet plantain empanada) and the creamy scrambled eggs w/farmer's cheese and chorizo, which has become my go-to entree (the texture and taste of the eggs is delightful).  \\n\\nThe eggs benedict on biscuits with avocado (no meat w/this one) is yummy but I've learned to ask for my poached eggs a little well done (they're often runny).  The huevos rancheros I've had once - the menu says \\"on crispy tortillas\\" and they were not - they were simply slightly warmed, and definitely not traditional nor the best counterpart to the eggs.  The homefries are sometimes really good, today mine were lukewarm. They give you dry toast for some reason.  BUT - the restaurant is attractive and the ambiance is nice (especially when they keep the new agey, uptempo, vaguely Latin beats at a lower volume), the service is good, and the coffee, if not particularly full bodied, is kick ass caffeinated and gets your heart pumping.  Oh, and I love the corn bread with 3 mini scoops of spreads - raspberry chipotle, apricot habanero, and honey molasses (I've finally memorized it).  Once I went there about six months ago and the corn bread was hot from the oven, two pieces were blue corn and two yellow, it was light and fluffy and the best I've ever had.

We were seated in the voodoo lounge, which was where my boyfriend and I had been seated a few months earlier.  When we walked into the lounge, it was swelteringly hot with no air flow.  We all sat down and were promptly greeted by a waiter, Ryan, who told us he was on his second day of work.  We asked what the rotating Abita beer was, and he said \\"Yeah I have no clue.\\" and just blankly stared at us.  And it was SO. HOT. in there.  \\n\\nI asked for the frozen grenade, and he said \\"Really?  *That's* what you want?  It's not very good...\\" I told him that was what I would like, that I had had it before.  He went to put the drink order in.  When the drinks finally arrived, they came out one at a time, but the drink that kept coming back to the table was the Whodi Smash, which only one person had ordered, over and over again.  After about an hour, I still didn't have a drink.  I asked after the grenade, and Ryan said \\"Oh we're out of those.\\"  Another blank stare.  I asked for a gin martini, which again, took a very long time.  All the while, we were dripping sweat because it was so hot.  On top of that, the waiter kept touching my lower back and shoulders (I was standing and floating around) and making me incredibly uncomfortable.\\n\\nWe asked if there was anything to be done about how stiflingly hot it was in the room, if there were any fans that could be used, and we were all but ignored.  \\n\\nWhen we finally all had drinks in our hands after 2 hours, we decided to close out and head home.  To make it simpler for Ryan, we decided to just put the whole bill on my boyfriend's credit card and sort out paying him back through Venmo.  However, on a $230 bill (which was about how much we expected it would be), we never received an itemized receipt.  We asked for one, and never received one.  We tipped more than 20% and finally left.  \\n\\nTo say that this experience was disappointing is an understatement.  I made the reservation far enough in advance that management should have put a more competent and proficient waiter on our table.  Don't give the new guy a party of 15.

It was sold to us as a dumpling like noodle, and was not that at all. I can't even describe how it tasted except that it wasn't great, so proceed at your own risk.\\n\\nEnded on a high note with the chicken fried local rabbit, which had incredible flavor profiles playing together and was cooked to perfection. \\n\\nLast note- whatever you do, eat the chocolate bread pudding.

When we got to the front, we had our choice of meat and sides. We got brisket, turkey, and a chopped beef sandwich (and all the sides). The brisket was absolutely delicious!!! The meat was fantastic- super tender and flavorful with the perfect hint of smokiness. So much flavor you don't even need to use their sauces (although their original sauce was also great).

If this is your first time trying out Franklins, you must wait in line. I personally think you have to go through the experience first and then order ahead next time. You need to get there at 7:30AM. Bring a chair, a book, ipod, and a friend. Why? early birds gets the worm. You will be the first one to get in, gets first pick at the meat, first one to leave. Sleep is overrated anyway. Nobody tell great stories of when they sleep in. Everybody tell great stories of when they wait four hours in line for some good bbq!!!!

And besides, you can always go back to sleep after. Food coma is guaranteed, my friend. After waiting for hours in line, order a whole bunch and stuff your face.

It's cool to find out where people are visiting from and their stories. Good networking tactic, too. Patio is dog friendly but not inside.

Let me explain.  You are handed a scantron.  This scantron may send you into a tailspin of flashbacks of your childhood education days but this standardized test is a lot of fun.  You get to choose what type of shell you want, what protein and all of your add-ons.  You can even choose some sides.  What I really love about the scantrons are the Veg/V/GF/D that help you identify what is vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free or contains dairy.  This is a big deal to me because of my milk allergy and it made me very happy.  On the other hand, the scantron can be pretty confusing and was pretty daunting for my group at first.  My 2 companions elected to go with the pre-made tacos that were on a separate menu because they were overwhelmed by the scantron concept.  I very nearly joined them but I'm glad I tried it the other way because it was fun.\\n\\nLet's get to the food itself.  Okay, for starters, we ordered an appetizer of chips and guac.  The guac was really tasty and had a spicy little kick to it.  The chips were REALLY bad.  I was so disappointed.  They were all just tiny broken pieces and they were completely saturated in salt.  It was really rough.  We got a second batch of chips that was slightly better but overall we couldn't even come close to finishing the guac because the chip fragments wouldn't allow it.  The tacos themselves were bigger than we expected so we were all glad that we had only ordered two.  I was very glad that they came with a fork and so were my comrades because not one of our taco shells made it out of the basket without completely disintegrating.  I'm not sure what is up with these shells but I got the harder corn shells and the others got the flour shells and they all fell apart immediately. It made for a very messy experience.  I tried the chicken and the shrimp ceviche.  The shrimp was delicious!  The chicken was meh.  I may have put too many toppings on mine or something but I ended up not liking the chicken one much at all and only eating the ceviche one.  I also ordered a side of rice and it was delicious!  I almost wish I had just ordered that because it was good enough to eat on its own.  Perfect combination of cilantro and lime juice!  The side portions are very small which was a blessing since the tacos were bigger than anticipated.  \\n\\nThe best part about Condado is the drink selection.  It is fantastic.  I tried the Lady Lilith as well as the Buckeye Mule.  The Buckeye Mule features Watershed products so I knew it would be a winner but the Lady Lilith was fantastic as well.  I tried my boyfriends Blood Orange Margarita and it was also super tasty!\\n\\nThe atmosphere gives off a \\"Dia de Los Muertos\\" vibe which is fun.  The space is actually bigger than I anticipated and they also have a nice little patio.  The restaurant was super crowded but they set the chairs up in a way that made it comfortable while eating.  The service was mediocre which I mostly attribute to the busyness of the restaurant as well as the fact that it is a new place but it was definitely a slow dining experience and our server forgot multiple items such as my boyfriend's second drink and everyone's side dishes but hopefully that is something that will improve over time.  I am excited about Condado because it is in my neighborhood and it is a short walk from work.  I can only hope they'll get their act together with those ratty chips and make some changes to the taco shells and beef up the service.  Then I could totally see this place as a 5 star venue!"},{"name":"Soul Fire BBQ","address":"182 Harvard Ave","city":"Allston","stars":"4","text":"Soul Fire is the best place in Allston to get a plate of comfort food.

The wings were tolerably hot and enjoyable, having a penchant for hot and spicy foods probably qualifies me as biased but being such I could have (and as it seems should have) made a meal of this alone! \\n\\nThe French fries were crispy and flavorsome,  not overly done, the onion rings were of a cut that I favor but my companion did not, \\"birdsnest\\" style, a very thin cut which favors a copious amount of batter, crispy and addictive to some, so this comes down to a matter of individual taste and preference! \\n\\nThe \\"Gorgonzola Burger\\" was my friend's choice, mine being the \\"Butta Burger\\" both fine selections according to our waiter. Upon arrival both burgers were found to be very greasy, making consumption a careful process, dry cleaning being expensive!

I am a big fan of different kinds of blue cheese, and I was expecting gorgonzola, as the menu promised, but what was on my burger can only be described as ubiquitous blue cheese dressing. It didn't taste like gorgonzola to me...just really really salty. So sad. Not only that, but the bun on both sides of my burger was covered in this dressing...the bun was soggy and falling apart as my burger slipped around while I tried to eat it without getting both hands covered in the dressing. Too much dressing, too salty, I couldn't get a real taste for the meat although I did see it was cooked medium rare (pink in the middle) which I prefer\\"\\n\\nSo all in all a mixed experience, I believe just a bit more care as to burger preparation would make this a truly top notch casual dining experience!"},{"name":"Se7en Bites","address":"617 N Primrose Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"So cute, comfortable, and such great service!

There are many unique dishes on any of several menus. The cheap food menu is a gem. As mentioned by several other reviewers the only negative with this place is the service. It is slow, inattentive, and friendly in a stand-offish kind of manor. I have been coming here for many years and often wish the chef-owner was on hand so I could speak with him about the problem with his service. Who ever is training the server staff is leaving out some very important direction regarding how customers are treated and level of attention that should be afforded to each customer. If the kitchen is slow the server must pick up the slack with the customer. Bread and beverage refills are part of the value added experience and should not be withheld until demanded.

We finished with dessert: a caramel and chocolate ice cream sandwich (yes...an ice cream sandwich) and a lemon pound cake with the best lemon custard I'd ever tasted.

I hear it's good, which is why we drove all the way to Avondale Estates to give it a try. The one star review is for the god awful service and the armpit stench which I could not get out of my nose even long after leaving the restaurant. We went in at dinner time, and there were about 5-7 free tables available. The hostess asked us how many, and we said \\"two adults and room for a stroller,\\" because we had our sleeping 8 week old infant in the car seat travel system. She walked us to the back of the restaurant, where a waitress was cleaning two tables that were kind of half booths, half regular tables, against the wall. There was no room in one of them for either of us to sit on the same side as the stroller, so we were eyeballing a bigger corner booth that was being cleaned. The waitress cleaning it turned around to walk past us and glared at us because our stroller was in her way, and she didn't speak she just gave us a hard glare. We moved out of her way. She took her time clearing the tables. So, we chose a regular 4-top that was not against the wall where our stroller would fit and would be out of the way. She saw us, and instead of greeting us or giving us menus or asking us to wait - no words. She just looked at us, and walked by us, and started clearing another 4-top next to the one we were seated at. She did not wipe our table at all. After several minutes of awkwardness, she finally turned to us and asked in a very rude tone, \\"did you not see the hostess?\\" I guess implying that we sat in the wrong space. The hostess had walked us to the back of the room, but had not indicated a specific table, and had just walked off. So we explained that. The rude waitress then started wiping our table very abruptly with an attitude like we were clearly disturbing her by sitting here. So I asked her, \\"Should we not be sitting here?\\" She looked at me and said nothing, just pointed to the table where I guess she thought we should be sitting, turned her back on us and walked off, obviously bothered. I am sorry, I am not giving my good money to a place, good food or not, where patrons are treated this way!

The restaurant doesn't even open until 11:00 am, but there must have been 75 people in line ahead of us already.  And the line swelled dramatically as the day wore on because some groups initially sent one or two people to stand in line for the much larger group.  The employees were really great about coming out and giving you updates on how much longer the wait would be (their initial estimate when we arrived was that we were so far back in line that we would need to wait another 2-3 hours after the restaurant opened at 11:00 am before being served).  After the employees came out the first time they took tentative orders from everyone in line and gave someone a handwritten sign on butcher paper designating them as the \\"last man standing\\" (i.e. the person who was the last one guaranteed to get food per their calculations of when they would start running out).  For the record, we were 6 people behind the first \\"last man standing\\" but they later re-calculated and moved the sign back another 20 people and we got plenty of food.  All told we waited in line for 5 hours - which is moderately insane now that I think about it.  But it was totally worth it.  The brisket was amazing - buttery, moist and tender.  It melted on your tongue with an explosion of beef flavor.  It was far and away the best brisket I have ever had.  And the ribs were peppery (without being seasoned so heavily with black pepper that it obscures the flavor of the ribs) and tender.  I think these ribs were the perfect degree of tenderness, but my husband would have preferred them to have just a little more bite to them.  While standing in line I re-read various articles on Franklin's on my iPhone and decided that we should also try Tipsy Texan sandwich - a mess of chopped brisket, sausage, coleslaw, pickles and onions on a soft white bun.  The sandwich might not appeal to barbeque purists but I thought it was wonderful.  I loved it.  It was gloriously messy and delicious; I highly recommend it.  I will be the first to admit that waiting in line for 5 hours to eat barbeque is crazy.  But I have to say that given the chance to do it again I would totally do it.  It was that good.  And the whole experience was just so much fun.  The people who work there (including the owner, Aaron Franklin) were just so genuinely nice and pleasant.  They came out to chat with us in line, roamed the dining room to make sure everyone was happy with their food, brought out beers, sodas, etc. for sale and also brought out free samples of the sausage.  It just had such a great welcoming vibe - you felt like you were visiting a friend at home who just genuinely loved to cook and was so happy to see you, rather than visiting a restaurant.  I was so happy with it that I bought a t-shirt.  Oh and for the record, by the time we left at 3:15 the \\"sold out\\" sign was up on the front door because they sold the 1500 lbs of meat that they cooked for the day.  But there were a lot of people who arrived around 1pm and still got served so there really is no need to get in line at 9:30 am. However, by the time those people got food I think they were out of a number of meats and only had brisket left."},{"name":"Cypress Street Pint & Plate","address":"817 W Peachtree St NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Went to Cypress street to try the infamous sublime burger.

I do have to start off by saying that I totally didn't research enough before coming here because 1) I'm a poor student on a budget and 2) I thought we would be leaving full but ended up not.\\n\\nDon't get me wrong, the food was great. For an appetizer, or \\"snacks\\" as they call it, we got the Shrimp & Cornbread Toast, Kimchi Vinaigrette, Benton's Bacon Bits. No one flavor was overpowering the other, but the plate was so small, it left me wanting more! That could be a good sign for the dish, but we also showed up pretty damn hungry.\\n\\nWe got the seared duck breast which was amazing!! If you don't really eat duck much, I can see how it may be overwhelming. My boyfriend doesn't really eat duck but he thought this was the best dish. I know duck and I grew up on duck and this one was perfect. I know there was another review bashing it, and maybe each duck has its own flavor (more game-y or less) but ours was not as game-y. \\n\\nWe also got the pork belly. My bf was a big fan of it but if you've ever had the fatty pork with the roasted skin in Chinatown, you would think, \\"Wow, for 10 bucks less, I could've gotten the same thing, but better!\\" It wasn't a bad dish, I just grew up on perfect roast pork from Chinatown Cafe and let me tell you that they do it in this kind of style for cheaper and less bland. \\n\\nFor drinks - we asked the waitress what the most popular ones were, so she recommended \\"Round Up\\" and \\"That'll Do\\". I loved my Round Up. It's a sweeter drink (I don't really like sweet drinks but it seemed very interesting) but I wouldn't have minded another one. That'll Do was extremely interesting. Definitely smell that one before you take a drink. Perfectly strong - if you want one drink for the night... That'll do. Oh wow I guess that's why they named it that haha.\\n\\nLastly but definitely not the least, it was my boyfriend's birthday!........ Called in to ask if they can do something special and they said of course! During dinner, I double checked with the waitress, asking if she got the memo from the hostess. She said yes, so I asked if they were gonna give a small little cake or something. But! She said she was under the impression that I was gonna choose something from the menu and they'll put a candle on it. Hmmm, I thought restaurants usually give a small complimentary dessert, especially since this restaurant is on the pricier side. Seeing how our interaction was a bit awkward, I agreed to get the chocolate mousse. I honestly expected a slice a cake with layered mousse but it was just kind of smushed onto the cake. Totally unexpected. Regardless of aesthetics, it was a great dessert! Not too sweet. Boyfriend was completely surprised, which made me really happy.\\n\\nAll in all, the food will leave you wanting more. I'm still not sure if that's a good thing, for me at least. I definitely appreciated all the unique flavors. The total came out to around 90-ish for 1 small plate, 2 big plates, and 2 drinks. Service was great except the little misunderstanding about the cake which left me in a bit of an awkward position. Just know that it's not quite tapas you would expect (especially looking at the prices) but it's not quite a full, regular plate that you're gonna be ordering. I think the atmosphere was delightful and would definitely come back to try the secret burger (my bf doesn't eat bf and it was his birthday so I didn't wanna order in front of him!) and to get drinks with friends if I feel like ballin' out again."},{"name":"Sugar Factory","address":"8371 International Dr, Ste 70","city":"Orlando","stars":"3","text":"Food is so yummy awesome environment the food is great the south beach flair burger is my favorite the mai tai is absolutely delicious I'm so excited every time I come here I love the location perfect spot for a entertaining time out!

I saw one little old lady, who must have been at least 80 years old, tottering back to her table with a brewski in plastic cup!  After my order was in, I grabbed a small table and my food was out in no time.  About seven meaty ribs with some char and slathered in a tangy sauce.  The collard greens were delicious, cooked with a bit of pork and the beans were home-made in the same tangy sauce.  Two slices of white bread finished the meal along with some tasty pecan pie.  I couldn't finish it all there but I can tell you the ribs were still delicious, cold.  \\n\\nThe guys working the dining room were super polite, taking care of refills and cleaning the tables.  I'd love to come back here at night for some ribs and music.  All I can say is that Fat Matt's delivered a great lunch and good 'ol southern hospitality!  This place was great, but my body is thankful it's far, far away in Atlanta for health reasons. And those little old ladies that were at Fat Matts?

While some might think it's crazy to split one dish, the portion size of the chicken at the Screen Door is insane. \\n\\nIn my opinion the chicken was just alright. I thought the taste and texture of the breading was definitely good, but the chicken itself wasn't great. It was also strange to me that both the thigh and breast piece tasted exactly the same.

ABSOLUTELY!\\n\\nSure, there were great reviews of this place, but I wasn't sure if I wanted to stand outside feeling like poor ole Oliver Twist, feasting only with my eyes... I was also getting anxious as we approached the cashier because I wanted to know if I was going to be able to find a table, but as you're waiting, the waiter points you to a seat before you order. I was VERY relieved. \\n\\nI ordered the mi-so-hot spicy miso ramen, and my bf ordered the tonkatsu original. We shared an order of gyozas and pork yodas (pork belly and what seemed to be grilled brussel sprouts with tonkatsu sauce) They were ALL so delicious!!!!\\n\\nmi-so-hot ramen: Wow, this was... actually spicy! I was pleasantly surprised because many dishes are labeled \\"spicy,\\" and it usually isn't. Both ramens were pretty oily, but if you're on a diet, LEAVE!\\n\\ntankatsu original: Best salty/savory/creamy ramen I've ever tasted. Soft chashu pork with a beautiful fat to meat ratio. It slid through my teeth so easily. Yes, we traded ramens in the middle of our dinner!\\n\\ngyozas: You can NOT mess up on gyoza. If you do. die. \\n(Tasted like the store bought kind, not a bad thing, because they are actually very tasty) \\n\\npork yodas: Love the bitter charred flavor of the brussel sprouts with the sweet tang of the tonkatsu sauce.

Will give them a little slack since it was opening weekend (7 PM Saturday night) but we were expecting a much better experience especially at this price point. The room is pretty and buzzing. They sat us towards the back (there were 4 of us) and that was a mistake. The room narrows so the noise level trebles (as it has no where to go) to the point we couldn't hear each other talk. Pick a different area if you can.\\n\\nThe service started excellent and friendly as we had 2 servers at the beginning (training?) but 2.5 hours into our meal we barely saw 1. \\n\\nWe ordered craft cocktails and really enjoyed the Sarsaparilla Whiskey drink. Nice twist on an Old Fashion. \\n\\nThe food was good. The highlights were definitely the starters. We had the Fettine Trio from the Wild Game Fettine. While the portions were small they were tasty (the trio was bases of duck, elk, lamb). Very unique!\\n\\nMy son and his fianc√© were interested in trying different items from the First Course and the waiter said he could reduce the numbers of each item and happily substitute so they could sample. They raved about the Elk sliders, wild Boar ribs, and Blue Corn Lobster Hushpuppies. (We were a bit surprised when we got the check it ended up being over $35 in samples when we were expecting it to be one Starter as it was explained to us. So be careful here).\\n\\nFor the entrees (there was about 35 minute min wait between meals even though we ordered everything at same time) my son and I went with the servers suggestion of the house specialty of the garlic infused tenderloin and our better halves went with the flank steak with fries.  The tenderloins  were cooked perfectly, of decent size, and had a nice flavor, though not as tender as you would expect. Good but ultimately forgettable especially billed as a house specialty. \\n\\nThe waiter said the flank steaks were excellent and 6-8 oz of meat. There was barely 4oz and the meat was ok. The French fries were stone cold when served so the remedy was for the server rather than taking the dish back and re-plating, he picked off the meat with tongs at the table to bread plates, took away the cold fries, and later brought back bowls of hot fries (which were very good).  Not the right way to handle an issue.\\n\\nWe passed on desert as it would have been too long but the chocolate cake that went by looked really good.\\n\\nAll in all, was it worth the $350 bill for 4 without wine? Probably not. There is much better value in town. However the starters are so unique that were would probably come here again just to try the rest of them (they do not have a happy hour menu at this time). We thought they might offer a desert or chef to come over and say a few things about the service or food issues, but at the end we were treated to brusk delivery of our check (after we had to track down our waiter) without a thanks, sorry for issues, thanks for coming etc.. This was definitely reflected in the tip. \\n\\nSo all in all if it wasn't for the starters, this review would have been a 1 star. We eat out often and we may try this again after the buzz dies down."},{"name":"Mrs. B's Cafe","address":"30 Channel Center St","city":"Boston","stars":"2","text":"Terrible food quality while being really expensive.

People at the front of the line were there at 6am, from what I'd been told. I arrived at 10am and didn't see the inside of the store until about 145 and from there didn't actually pick out my food and eat until 230. It is a long wait. My best advice is get there early. As early as you possibly can. You'd think that arriving before it opened would mean you'd at least be able to get it 'to go' in a faster fashion but that's not true.\\nGet there really early and dress for the elements (sunscreen and water for summer/fall, jacket and gloves for 'winter', jacket and umbrella for spring).\\nBonus: they have cloth lawn chairs for you to borrow to sit on. \\nTheir customer service is bomb. They came out multiple times to explain what time they estimated that it would take to get us fed so that people didn't have to hang around if it was out of their time limit. They came out numerous times to offer water, soda and beer for sale while we stood in line. They came out to check off meat orders for everyone so that they made sure people stranding in line to get ribs would actually get the chance to get ribs (hint: those go faster than anything else).\\nThe brisket was falling apart as I tried to eat it and the rub they used was great. The beans weren't anything I'd choose again. The sausage was on point. Bourbon banana pie=banana pudding in a cookie pie crust. Delish!\\nThe sauces were not anything to write home about. There are three signature sauces and I ended up picking the lesser of three evils to eat but I really wasn't satisfied with any. Make sure to grab some bread when offered and get some pickles and onions. \\nGreeeeeease everywhere. Get lots of napkins and the wet wipes from the front.\\nAll in all, five stars.

I had mashed potatoes collared greens topped with two big pieces of Fried chicken.  Food was good but I was not impressed with the Mac-cheese I ordered on the side. A random Caucasian guy I'm not sure if he's the manager or owner greeted us and asked us if everything was going ok and if we needed anything.  This was the first time a person of official status greeted me at a restaurant.

It's not that they are terrible, I just feel like something is not quite right. I feel strange looking at traffic roll by eating BBQ. Maybe it's just me. Either way, Fox Bros has become my go-to BBQ spot over the last few years of living in the big city.\\n\\nThe meat is the main attraction. I can honestly say that I have not been disappointed across the board here. The brisket has a nice char, while remaining tender. The pulled pork and chicken both have just the right amount of smoke without becoming dry.\\n\\nThe thing that sets this place apart IMO, however, is the variety of things that they create with traditional BBQ ingredients. The Texas fries are awesome. They are like BBQ nachos: just a huge pile of fries covered in pulled pork, sauce, jalapenos and cheese. An awesome sandwich is the Fox Bros burger, which is built just like a burger but with brisket instead of ground beef.\\n\\nThe sides also really shine here. Frito pies take me back. Also the brunswick stew is out of sight with a decent amount of meat. I would also like the record to state that I am a huge fan of tots and that's a welcome member of this menu in my book.\\n\\nBONUS: $6 pitchers of Yuengling all day."},{"name":"Press 101","address":"7600 Dr Phillips Blvd, Ste 22","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"I am basing my rating on the service experience that I had at Press 101.

My husband & I & two friends went for dinner last night. We got there between 7:30-8, so needless to say, there was a wait. There is nowhere to stand while you wait except near the doorway, where you are constantly in the way of EVERYONE: people coming in, people trying to leave, other people waiting for a table & staff trying to roll silverware. It was chaos. My friends & I noticed a small \\"inlet\\" where we could stand that was totally out of the way of all the chaos, but we were immediately chastised by a tiny hostess \\"No. No. No. You're in my space. Pick on somebody your own size. I need to stand here to roll silverware.\\" And, yes, she really did say that bit about picking \\"on somebody your own size\\". Ummmm, okey dokey, artichokie. So, we moved & she frantically rolled silverware for a couple of minutes. As soon as she walked away, a family of 4 stood there for several minutes & were NEVER fussed at for standing there like we were. So, yeah, we were feeling a bit picked on. Not a great start.\\n\\nWhen we got a table, it was near the door, so it was a bit cold. Our waiter showed up promptly & brought us water. Then, he came back & took our drink orders. He mixed up my husbands drink order (at least that's what he told us) with another table & brought him a coke with no ice. When my husband told him he wanted ice, the waiter was VERY apologetic & brought him a new one. No big deal. I ordered a classic corn dog & fries with poutine. Both were VERY good. I really liked the gravy on the fries. My husband said his pork burger was tasty. \\n\\nOur friends ordered corn dogs. One with pepper batter, the other wrapped in pastrami. BUT, WAIT! Just when we thought things were starting to get better, they didn't......the corn dog with pepper batter didn't come out with everybody else's food. The waiter told us he would be back with it. Then, my friend waited, waited & waited some more. We all kept wondering where her corn dog was. She ended up filling up on her fries because 15 minutes went by & no corn dog. Our waiter walked by & said \\"You all look like you need something\\". We told him that she still needed her corn dog & he acted very indifferent to the fact that EVERYONE at the table was almost finished with their food & she still hadn't gotten her corn dog. The weird thing: he was super apologetic about bringing a coke with no ice (which really wasn't a big deal at all), but super duper indifferent about the fact that we were all finished eating by the time her corn dog arrived. She finally got it, but everybody else was already finished eating. The cashier was very pleasant & took my friend's corn dog off her bill, so that's a good thing.  \\n\\nSo, overall our experience was pretty bad. Pallookaville, I wanted to love you so much!!!!

There's a line trailing outside the door for a reason, people - this place is amazing! \\n\\nTHE GOOD:\\n- I went with the 7th Trimester for breakfast, and for a fatty like me, this is what dreams are made of: a biscuit, egg, bacon, and...wait for it...MAC 'N CHEESE (!!!). I never thought I'd see the day where the two loves of my life - breakfast food and mac 'n cheese - came together on a plate. It was simply divine. My arteries were crying, but my taste buds were singing. \\n- My man went for the Eggs Benedict, and it was equally delicious - the eggs were soft and runny, and the hollandaise sauce was perfection. I was stealing glimpses at others' plates as we were eating, and everything looked fantastic - I don't think you can make a bad choice with the menu here. \\n- We both opted for a Nutella Iced Coffee to go with our meals, and this was also an A+ life decision: tasty, refreshing, and just the boost of caffeine we needed to kickstart our day. \\n- The girls inside were wearing 1950s inspired outfits and bandanas - I thought this was cute, and it definitely added to the restaurant's charm. \\n\\nTHE BAD:\\n- Se7en Bites is on the pricey side. For the sake of your wallet and your waistline, I'd recommend stopping by on occasion at most. \\n\\nAll in all, I thoroughly enjoyed my first breakfast experience with a mac 'n cheese twist.

After checking out some of the reviews on yelp and the rave on pigtrip.net (a great resource for barbecue joints in the Northeast), I decided to try Soul Fire.\\n\\nSoul Fire feels spacious, especially on week nights, when there aren't a lot of people there.   There are high ceilings and a huge flat screen TV.   Service was friendly, helpful and prompt.\\n\\nPork ribs were as it as it gets in the Boston area.  Spare ribs and baby backs are infused with a fine smoke flavor and the rub added great flavor.  The ribs needed no sauce, but I love to play around with sauces and even mix them up a bit.   I really enjoyed all but the sweet sauce, the \\"pit boss\\" and \\"soul fire\\" were great.   The fiery sauce was a little hotter than I liked but blended with a little pit boss, I loved it.  It has some mustard in it and is like a kicked up version of Blue Ribbons golden sauce.   Fried Chicken, including the chicken wings was excellent - well worth ordering even if you love pork.\\n\\nSides were good to great.   The collards were really nicely prepared, but just a little too sweet for my liking.  Fries were nicely done. \\n\\nEverything benefitted from being served on large plates, so that things were kept separate - unlike Redbones and Blue Ribbon where everything runs a bit into everything else before you get a chance to chow down.\\n\\nWhile Soul Fire lacks the life and the funkiness of Redbones, it also lacks the crowds and the noise.  Soul Fire has definitely joined my list of top BBQ places in the area.   Next to try:  M&M's."},{"name":"Stefano's Grill","address":"7512 Dr Philips Blvd, Ste 80","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Service was great and food was good, but the prices and menu caused some frustration.\\n\\nThe good is that they have a real chef at this restaurant.

Next time I'd like to try the chipotle artichoke dip or the spicy tuna cabo rolls.  Though I don't usually order it as my main course at restaurants, their chicken entrees are delicious as is the southwestern steak frites.  I found their vegetarian empanada to be lacking flavor.

Only with time have I been able to come to terms with this story enough to tell it to you now. It's been a couple of years, but as you'll see I was unable to bring myself to go back since then:\\n\\nI came here with my husband and my parents to grab some dinner. I should've known something was askew in the universe, because on the way there, an unstable man who was yelling on the street corner decided to jump in front of my moving car on Division. I digress...\\n\\nWe walk in the door just as a couple walks out, looking a bit frustrated, and soon we realize why. Looking over the menu, my husband asks about the Sun Cheese plate, and the guy behind the counter says, \\"Nah, nobody gets that. Don't order that. Actually, I don't know even how to make it. They just left me here, man.\\" (Perhaps an emergency occurred, and they had to call the new guy in as backup; based on his behavior, he might've eaten one-too-many magic mushrooms before being summoned to work.)\\n\\n\\"No problem!\\" We smile reassuringly, as fear creeps across his face. We order despite our better judgment. My husband and I order first, and take a seat. Then my parents order. The dude starts preparing my meal, getting slower and slower as he works, occasionally pausing to stare into the abyss. After 20 minutes, my meal comes out first, by itself, and I use my big girl manners to wait for everyone else to get their food. While making my husband's dish, he makes several trips to the bathroom, leaving the restaurant unattended while taking some \\"me time\\" in the bathroom to stare at the unfamiliar appendages where his hands used to be, telling himself the world is a kind place and everything is going to work out fine. \\n\\nMy husband's dish comes out 20 minutes later and my parents implore us to eat, sensing the futility of the situation. A new customer shows up and just wants to buy some cling-wrapped cornbread from the counter and the server CANNOT handle it, saying \\"not now man, just hold on a sec.\\" The server had like 1 neuron left and was using it to keep on track with our food prep. Meanwhile, that \\"sec\\" lasted 15 minutes while the customer waited patiently, asking if he can just quickly pay for the cornbread. He's ignored. My parents exchange knowing glances with him. The customer then takes off with the cornbread (nobody blames him!), but has a conscience and returns. Frustrated, he lays more than enough cash on the counter, saying \\"here dude,\\" and leaves. I don't think the server notices anything at this point. \\n\\nOur third dish comes out 30 minutes later. We serve as unofficial ambassadors, warning newly arrived customers of the abominable wait, hoping the next one who comes in won't trigger the cosmic sands of time and space to implode. Between giggles, my parents, who have a habit of whispering too loudly, start piecing together what is going on in what is possibly the worst day of this guy's life. It seemed only I was made very uncomfortable, and felt super depressed for him. I don't know why I took it so hard. \\n\\nAnother bathroom trip, and the guy finally finishes making our last dish. \\"I'm sorry. This is just SO HARD.\\" We say it's alright. \\"They left me here and I'm the only one.\\" At this point, the three of us who were already served are finished eating, and eagerly wait for my mom to finish her dish so we can get out. By that point, it's nearly closing time, so the server, now left with nothing to do starts packing up the salad bar. And he's so slow, like 80-year-old-shuffling-grandpa slow. At one point he kinda trips over the rubber mat, and I am honestly worried for the guy's welfare. Is he going to get home OK? I hope he's not going to drive home. \\n\\nAs we leave I am too shaken up to drive the 1/2 mile back home, so I let my husband drive. At home I immediately say \\"Anybody want a drink? I think I need a stiff one,\\" and got drunk, trying to forget everything I just witnessed. I'll probably never know what really happened that day, and I don't know if I want to. But I do know one thing...\\n\\nAbout 4 months later, my husband totally saw the same guy working at another vegan food cart on the other side of town. He was totally chipper and normal, and our food came out quickly. I DID NOT believe it was really him, so we went back a few days later and it WAS him--I saw with my own eyes. I wanted to take a picture, but I'm no creepo. I'm mostly just glad he was safe.\\n\\nPS: The food was totally delicious. I get Papa G's tofu packs at the supermarket all the time and it's great, but I will always be haunted by this. \\n\\nTo be clear, 3 stars is an average between 5 stars for the food quality, and negative stars for the the most traumatizing restaurant experience of my life."},{"name":"Screen Door","address":"2337 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"I love shrimp and grits.\\n\\nSadly every single time I've had them at Screen door it was more like Shrimp and the shits."},{"name":"Art Bar","address":"40 Edwin H Land Blvd","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"The best burger ever !

So they serve burgers and sushi and lets just say they have perfected neither. But I'll get to the food after the service.\\n\\nThe service was beyond slow. I mean I understand sushi takes a long time to make because I love love love some good sushi, but this was ridiculous. It took us so long to get seated (which we expected because, duh, City Walk) it took twenty minutes for the beer to come for my boyfriend and refills on WATER took at least thirty minutes. Now font get my wrong I don't blame the servers nor the rest of the staff, there just had to be a communication problem between the levels of the establishment. Also, there has to be a better system of seating people. I saw at least five hostess per minute and yet there were TONS of people waiting and many tables open. I don't know if they want to appear more desirable or what.\\n\\nBut anyways, we ordered the crab rangun appetizer and something was just off. I mean it was cold, but I didn't know if that's how they did their crab rangun, but personally that's not how I like it. Also the sauce on top was more buffalo than sweet. I also ordered a chicken sandwich which was beyond burnt. It was like biting plastic. The fries were meh.\\n\\nMy boyfriend ordered the bento box with sushi and a mini burger. The sushi was not appetizing (I know I tried some) and the mini burger was definitely the best part. You can't really mess up edamame but the sweet potato fries were ridiculously awesome. \\n\\nMaybe we have been spoiled on good sushi and chicken sandwiches we can actually chew but I just think it would be better to eat at another more mediocre place at city walk. Because that's what you're getting anyways.  I think we wanted our pants blown off for the price we were paying and it was just barely edible.\\n\\nOverpriced. Slow. Sub par.\\n\\nJust go to Margaritaville or eat in the dang park.

The waitress was also nice enough to let us move to a different table by the window when we asked.\\n\\nThere is a small outdoor bar outside the restaurant, but there doesn't seem to be anything special about it. Their appetizers are expensive, but good. We had the bacon wrapped shrimp and the calamari. The shrimp came with 4 medium sized shrimp with large pieces of bacon to wrap, which was kind of expensive for what it was, and was also a bit on the salty side for my tastes. The calamari was served on a plate with a Chinese takeout box (really?) and chopsticks, which was also an interesting presentation choice. The calamari itself was done pretty well though and mixed in with pretty dull, sliced jalape√±o peppers and served with some Thai sweet chili on the side.\\n\\nThe main courses all looked well presented, but I wasn't entirely sure about the taste. I had the walleye fish, which was an interesting mix of flavors; chimchurri sauce, some yellow mustard like sauce, really strong plum sour topping... I wasn't sure what flavor profile they were going for, but it was definitely confusing. It was almost as if they were trying to cover up the blandness of the fish itself instead of actually bringing out the flavor. The corn polenta served with the dish was okay, but it was also pretty bland considering the combination. Might have done better with some more corn, but I wasn't sure. Interesting flavor choice combinations... not sure if it worked. The brisket looked pretty good as well (presentation and size portion), but I can't attest to the taste. \\n\\nThey had a small selection of desserts which all looked pretty good, but I think they came out only so so. I had the panna cotta with the fresh fruit, which looked decent (presentation wise), but was pretty plain and the flavors were not particularly well mixed. Nothing particularly memorable. \\n\\nThis place tries really hard to impress with the serious presentation and plating, but I think they could use a little more work with the food flavors itself. It is a nice enough place though and the service is good. It's not too loud (seems like a place where everyone goes after work for drinks) and the price is reasonable (entrees are all $30 or less).

I redeemed the vouchers last evening with my parents.  There was virtually nothing VIP about our experience.  As a matter of fact, our evening began on a bad note and progressively got worse.  My father is terminally ill and cannot walk long distances.  My mother is recovering from knee surgery and cannot comfortably walk long distances, either.  After paying a five dollar parking fee, I found the one remaining disabled parking spot.  It was nowhere near the entrance to the building. None of the parking spots were close to the entrance.  It easily took us fifteen minutes to get to the podium from our car to check-in.  Maybe two minutes after arriving at the podium, a very casually dressed younger gentleman asked us if we were VIP guests.  We informed him that we were.  He politely told us someone would be with us \\"shortly\\".  That \\"shortly\\" ended up being almost thirty minutes.  My father finally had to ask if he could walk into the building to use the restroom.  As the VIP line continued to grow, the other queue to enter the building was flowing quite smoothly.  One would have foolishly presumed that the VIP guests would have been offered priority entrance into the building.  When we finally got into the building, they seemed to be more interested in selling us a photographic souvenir of our visit than escorting us to the VIP lounge.  When I booked our reservation yesterday afternoon, I was informed that the doors opened at 18:30 and the show started at 19:30.  Our VIP experience included an appetizer buffet in the VIP lounge.  We had slightly less than fifteen minutes to \\"enjoy\\" our appetizers before we were rushed into the main theatre. In defense of this business, the appetizers were better than the actual dinner (but that's not saying much). As I mentioned previously, both of my parents have limited mobility.  In the shuffle, the employee escorting us into the theater lost us.  We didn't know where to go.  As soon as we entered the theatre, the smell of mold slapped us in the face.  Finally, a person who I suspect was a manager asked me for our receipt and pointed us in the direction we were supposed sit for the main show and our dinner.  Although I booked VIP seats with the primary intention of securing a good view of the show for my parents,  the seats the initially tried to offer us were not in the VIP section of the theatre and the view would have been obscured.  We did not sit down.  We informed the server in that area that we had booked the VIP experience. He offered no assistance whatsoever. He merely said, \\"this is where they put you\\".  At this point, I was ready to ask for our money back and take my parents out for a nice quiet dinner somewhere far away from The Pirate Dinner Adventure.  Fortunately, the server who hosted the appetizer buffet in the VIP lounge came to our aid.  She promptly spoke with the manager and moved us into her station,  She was the server in the VIP section of the theatre.  However, at no point did a manager come to speak with us or to offer us an apology.  The server who assisted us was perhaps the only pleasant aspect of yesterday evening's nightmare.  She was polite, very friendly, and professional.  After moving us into her section, she promptly offered us a water, cola, beer, or wine.  She then offered us either tomato soup or a salad that looked much more like something a rabbit would eat.  It was little more than iceberg lettuce, two or three shreds of cabbage, and some cherry tomatoes.  The next course was a choice of either chicken, beef kebabs, or vegetable lasagna.  My mother and I had the beef kebabs accompanied by a rice pilaf and frozen mixed vegetables.  My mother and I both picked at our plates.  Prison food could very well have tasted better than what was placed in front of us last night.  My mother ended-up wrapping the beef morsels from both of our plates in napkins and bringing them home for the dogs.  The dessert course consisted of a stale brownie with a scoop of freezer burned vanilla ice cream.  By the point the dessert came, we were so hungry that we ate it.    Although some of  the performers were quite talented and tried very hard to do the best they could with the little they had available to them, the show was mediocre at best.  The sound system made it very difficult to hear much of what was being said. Furthermore, at several points during the show we were distracted by servers bickering with each other right in front of us.  Also, the script didn't seem to have any sort of a plot.  Several times during the show it was even quite obvious that they had \\"borrowed\\" material from The Walt Disney Company, Universal Studios, and Viacom.  In all honesty, the show was so difficult to follow, by the end my parents and I had no clue what it had been about (other than the clich√© of pirates kidnapping a princess and somehow a dragon shows up).

The entire chicken and waffles phenomenon is so American. So I'm always interested in trying fried chicken. The Screen Door fried chicken has a good texture with a nice crunchy build, light salt; the salt becomes more apparent as it cools. It has a very very slight cayenne flavor, following the chef's strategy of cayenne as a subliminal flavor and spice activator related to me by Jen Lewis when she was at Wildwood. \\n\\nThe shrimp cheese grits are a success, though I don't have a comparison eating them in the South.

There is a dollop of bacon, onion? - something sour, in the middle of the center of the dish.

Throughout the whole meal, I was getting annoyed... slow, and you definitely felt they didn't want to be there.

Bar-B-Q","address":"1238 Dekalb Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"My fiance (now husband) and I just got married last night and hired Fox Bros as our caterer. This was one of the absolute, hands-down, best decisions we made in the whole process. Amanda (Fox Bros events) was amazing to work with. She kept us in the loop and answered all of our questions/concerns and worked with us to make changes and updates and was positive and supportive the whole time. The night of the event she showed up to introduce us to our event lead, Nick, and make sure we felt good about how everything was going. The servers/staff were all incredibly kind and attentive to both us and our guests the whole night. The bartenders (also Fox Bros staff) kept everything moving and there was never a line even with over 100 guests. They set up the bar and food service quickly and everything looked really nice and put together. We supplied the alcohol, so they didn't really know what they would have to work with, but the bar looked like a professionally set up operation within just a few minutes.\\n\\nWe had 6 vegetarians and 3 vegans on our guest list, Fox Bros (and Amanda) worked with us to get an option together for each group and the staff was kind and helpful in getting their food for them at the event. We also brought in our own desserts and Fox Bros set everything up with the trays we supplied and it was really well done. The air conditioning went out at our venue and Fox Bros staff never complained or acted like it bothered them at all. They also tackled tasks quickly with just the hint of a request - for example, they asked if we would like them to grab a plate of food for us right after we finished the ceremony while guests were starting toward the buffet, we said yes and instead of asking us to list everything we wanted, they just smiled and got us a bit of everything immediately. It may sound silly, but it was an amazing burden lifted not to have to micromanage or answer questions in a very busy situation. They were always available no matter what we needed, but they weren't hovering at all - they really made the evening go smoothly and were invaluable to the evening.\\n\\nI can't say enough about the staff, but the food was also amazing. At the end of the night, they cleaned everything up after themselves and packaged all the left overs up for us in marked containers and put them in the refrigerator for us to take home. Today I've gotten so many compliments on the food and the staff (I've gotten several texts about the bartenders specifically as well as a couple of the individual serving staff).

When I looked at the menu I did not see the vegetarian friendly items I had scoped out beforehand so I asked about it.  I was then informed of the Club Room space just through the hallway with a different menu.\\n\\nService:\\nWe decided to sit at the bar as it was early and the place was quiet.   \\n\\nThe bartender was attentive and friendly but seemed new to what he was doing as he asked questions of the other bartender to make our drinks that were on their menu.\\n\\nThe service was good and attentive.  \\n\\nFood\\nI had the vegetable appetizer special and my boyfriend the Endive salad.  Both were good with decent portions.  I ended up getting the Ramps entree and the bf ordered the Scallops appetizer as his entree.   Both were good but the pasta dish was pretty much a half size portion.\\n\\nSpace:\\nThe two space/restaurant theme was interesting but confusing and not very clear at all when you walk in. \\n\\nThe space looks great but most people just walking in won't realize there is the \\"sit down\\" Club Room restaurant when you just walk into the more open Expo Kitchen area.\\n\\nThey should perhaps have different entrances for the two spaces or ask customers which room/menu they are interested in when they come in.   Either that or give people the option of which menu they want to order from no matter where they sit.\\n\\nThe ferns were definitely \\"overwhelming\\" leaning into the walkways to the Club Room and the restrooms also.\\n\\n\\nOur takeaway:  \\nEverything was fine about our experience except for the price.  \\n\\nI'm rarely one to look at prices on the menu before ordering but was floored to see our 2 drink, 3 appetizer, 1 entree bill come to just about $120.\\n\\nI asked to see the menu again when we got our bill as I thought they must have gotten something wrong.  $16 salads and $24 pasta dishes are just a bit too high especially for the portions.  The BF called it \\"small plate portions at full plate prices\\".   I expect that kind of pricing on Newbury street or at some place in the Back Bay attached to a hotel, but not at a neighborhood restaurant in the Fenway.   \\n\\nPerhaps they are trying to appeal more to the condo sprawl that has come in on Boylston Street in the neighborhood, but eating in the Club Room just wasn't worth the price for the portions we got.\\n\\nWe'll probably give it another try in the Expo Kitchen for the pizzas or for the outdoor seating for brunch sometime, but I won't be rushing back even though I walk past it every day which makes me sad."},{"name":"Veli Thai","address":"335 SW 5th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Walked up, ordered my tofu pad Thai, and it was done in a minute.

Like really terrible. We made reservations for a Friday night with no problem but when we asked for a seat on the patio they said it was \\"first come first served\\". So we got there early, asked for one of the 3 open patio tables and they said, \\"Those tables are reserved.\\" Okay. \\n\\nThey ended up seating us in the front area under a ridiculously bright florescent light (the only one of its kind in the restaurant). It was so distracting I asked the server if they could turn it off- she even agreed it was \\"really bright\\" as she shielded her eyes. She came back and said they couldn't turn it off. We then asked the hostess if we could move into the empty dining room (two tables were being used) and she said \\"we're pretty booked, let me get back to you.\\" She never got back to us, and the dining area was empty until we left. \\n\\nNow onto the food. I admit the HH prices are good for the amount of food you get, but I did not care for the mushrooms and prosciutto I ordered. I ended up getting a plate full of mushroom stems... which was weird. The prosciutto was fine and it was a large portion. My husband ordered the salami and salad appetizer and was raving about how much meat they included. We then ordered dinner- bolognese for my husband and chicken Parmesan for me. My chicken Parmesan was the single worst dinner I have ever ordered. It came with penne in a \\"cream sauce\\" which was LITERALLY milk poured over pasta. You couldn't tell there was sauce on the penne because it had all run off onto the plate creating a watery mess under the horribly cooked chicken parm. The chicken was rubbery with no breading at all. It was slathered in a florescent orange sauce which tasted nothing like tomatoes and then topped with some chewy cheese. \\n\\nI don't send food back. I never do it. I find it embarrassing for everyone involved. But I sent this back. I could not pay $20 for something I wouldn't feed to my dog (seriously). I told the server my glass of wine would suffice as my dinner, and to please just take the plate away. \\n\\nFor two HH apps, 2 HH cocktails, one entree and one glass of wine +tax and tip our bill still came to $75. We tipped the server a little extra since I didn't end up getting an entree, and she was really the only saving grace of the whole meal.

I'm not even a coffee fan and I found myself drinking a few loads. The taste is very smooth, unlike what I usually sample in So. California. I have a feeling the higher quality water had to do something with this. \\n\\nOnward to my main dish, I wanted to get a local feel of the food so I opted for the Montreal Corned Beef Hash. Compared to typical mashed up corned beef, they cut the corned beef into fine 1-inch strips. The result, much more flavor from the beef and a much fresher taste. The plate was complete, I did not feel bloated and they did a good job on the combination of ingredients. \\n\\nNext time I come back to Vancouver, I plan on returning to Paul's Place to try their other entrees.

The bartender left the bar to tend to other patrons and literally forgot about my wife and I and my beer which was still sitting under the tap.  So I sat and sat and looked at my beer across from me sitting under the tap.  So close and yet so far.  Finally, as it appeared that no one was about to serve us, we left my wife's untouched wine on the bar and left the restaurant.  The service, needless to say, is extremely lax.

The beans are sweet and tangy pairing perfectly with the cool, creamy texture of the potato salad. The best part of the meal is that they serve white bread and it sucks up all of the juices and sauce that the ribs leave on the plate. Also, please don't let the meal down by ordering soda, no sir and no ma'am, order the SWEET TEA! Overall, four stars and that's only because of the seating.

We went to brunch on a freakin' WEEKEND morning here. Wow, crazy idea, huh? They open at 9 am, we were there at 8:50am and there was already a long line around the corner and down the street.\\n\\nIt took them about 30 minutes to fill up the restaurant with the first wave of folks lined up, and we JUST missed the cut off. But it was only another 30 min or so after that when we were seated. So a total wait time of about an hour and ten min, which is NOT bad for a weekend brunch waiting time.  It would be best to show up around 8:20ish and then you're pretty much guaranteed a less than one hour wait. But then you have to wake up earlier so maybe not worth it to save just a bit extra on the wait time. (I'm thinking way too hard about this..)\\n\\nI had the oyster po' boy, as did my friend. My husband had biscuits and gravy. I don't know what else to say except everything tasted absolutely amazing. Portions are GIGANTIC. I ate most of the po' boy and did not eat another meal that day (I had to eat some snacks but I never felt super hungry again that day!).  The oysters were lightly fried but you could clearly taste the fresh oyster flavor quite strongly.  The eggs are over medium but jut runny enough to perfectly mix in with the sauce and oysters. The bacon was perfectly crunchy and salty.\\n\\nThe service was extremely professional and courteous, quick to keep refills on water and coffee. They know how to handle these kinds of busy mornings and do a great job of manning the tables efficiently.

Half-off happy hour menu til 7pm every night? Cheap beers? Nice outdoor seating? Relaxing ambiance? Sounds like a foodie dream come true. But alas, not for me...\\n\\nLet ms start with the good. The happy hour food isn't bad, but I haven't been very impressed by it. The fried mushrooms are actually quite good with just the right amount of crispy batter. The fries come with an aioli that's not bad. I've ordered their chicken wings twice, and I've only been disappointed... I like my wings spicy or sweet, but the wings come drenched with this thick-ish sauce that leaves a sour taste in my mouth (literally).\\n\\nThe last time I swung by Cypress, the service unfortunately was below average. We were a size-able group (10-12), and the first round of appetizers were fine, with one appetizer lagging about 10 minutes after the others (should have been a foreboding sign). In the second round of ordering, one person in our group ordered some take-out items, which she got in a reasonable amount of time. The rest of us waited ~20-30 minutes before hungrily inquiring about our food. The waitress looked confused, so we investigated ourselves --- apparently, the waitress gave us ALL our orders in take-out boxes! At that point, we were so hungry that we decided to just eat our food from the take-out boxes. Shortly after, the waitress came by with our same order again on plates (she had no idea what she had done and apparently had not figured it out yet) and saw us eating already... We politely explained to her that all the food were in take-out boxes. She then proceeded to make a face and take the new plate of food away --- no apologies for her mistake. So we were left with soggy fries, luke-warm food, and some attitude from our confused waitress.\\n\\nAnyways, from what I can tell, this bad service was an isolated incidence. Honestly, since it was such a big group, we were prepared to overlook the mistake, but the attitude was an unwelcome addition to our otherwise fine night.

Yet, after having TWO BEERS We tried to re-enter following the cigarette with the same bouncer, yet a manager intervened and we were told we were too intoxicated, could not be let back in, and could not be served.

He just kept putting his hand out to my face and threatening to call the cops? It was really bizarre. I felt like I was talking to a five year old. I kept calmly asking him why he was denying only us as people were stumbling past us and he just kept yelling at me to go home or pick another bar and \\"get wasted there?\\" I'm still so confused about the whole situation.

They also pretty condescendingly refuse to note what is celiac disease friendly.

Either way, Ajumama is a standout.\\n\\nTHE PROS:\\nbecause I know nothing about Korean cuisine, I'm assuming this is relatively authentic.  even if it isn't, it's very different from anything i've ever tried before, so +1 for a novel dining experience that was still delicious. \\nthe portion sizes are large and prices seem fair. a $6 dinner is fine by me.\\neveryone who was working was very nice and did their best to work as quickly as possible, which was definitely appreciated, since my experience with Ajumama was at the food truck festival (read: lines on lines on lines).\\n\\nTHE CONS:\\nI can't really think of too many Ajumama-specific cons, but there are the hassles that come with any food truck experience: tracking it down (which is why I hadn't tried it until the festival), standing while eating, waiting in line, etc.\\nthe sauce that came with my food was very, very salty, but I admit that's to be expected from a soy-sauce style dipping sauce.\\n\\nI enjoyed Ajumama, and I would recommend it.  I'm not sure I would make the effort to track them down and seek them out, but I did decide to follow them on twitter, in case of the unlikely event of motivation striking at some point, and I think that on its own says something.  If you pass the truck, definitely make a stop.  If it sounds interesting, go ahead and seek it out.  I doubt you'll be disappointed."},{"name":"DeSano Pizzeria Napoletana","address":"8000 Burnet Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Good Neapolitan style pizzas. My view it's more like 3.8.

I recommend ordering ahead so you can skip the 3+ hour wait in line.

The only stipulation is that you're required to  order a minimum of 5 lbs of meat.  It may sound like a lot (because it is!) BUT if you plan ahead and get a few co-workers or friends to join in it's a great way to enjoy top notch BBQ without the dreaded wait.  I recommend getting as much brisket as you can, it's amazing!  The ribs are also delicious, but you truly can't go wrong.  You also have to get at least one serving of each side dish (beans, coleslaw, potato salad). When you pick up your order you'll get a ton of BBQ sauce (several choices) a LOAF of bread, sliced onions and pickles.

My friends commented perhaps this wasn't the best time or place for me to admit I wasn't really into BBQ.  Now having said this, I will tell you that I've been to several BBQ establishments, including the Salt Lick, Rudy's, Opie's, Smitty's and Cooper's.   And although I've had some good experiences, BBQ just isn't my first choice of culinary options.  But that was before I tasted Franklin's offerings....now I'm a born-again-singing-hallelujah BBQ believer!   \\n\\nAaron Franklin was personable and cheerful (the man must be a natural born morning person, since he'd probably been up since early dawn) as we watched him slice up the meats.  He handed me a sample of the fatty brisket and as it melted in my mouth I immediately realized my expectation of BBQ would be forever changed.  At our table I tasted the delicious Tipsy Texan sandwich, which is definitely Texas sized and not for the faint of heart.  Piled high with chopped beef, sausage and sprinkled with coleslaw.  My friend devoured his sandwich in five seconds flat, perhaps fearing having to provide his friends with additional samples.  I ordered brisket (a leaner cut), turkey and sausage.  The sausage had a good flavor, but I can't say it was better than all other sausage I've tried before.  The brisket and turkey were all together a different story.  Since I usually get lean brisket it's never that great, usually lacking in moistness and flavor.  But Franklin's had a delectable smoky, peppery crust, was tender and moist and had a through and through delicious.  I don't know what he does differently, but it was certainly the best I've ever tasted.  For me the definition of brisket going forward will be \\"Franklin's.\\"  The turkey was incredible and was falling-off-the-fork moist and juicy (the brine juices are poured over the turkey slices). The accompanying BBQ sauces were complex and tasty, but honestly I used the sauce sparingly because I did not want to mask the flavorful goodness of the meat itself.  That is a statement I never expected to make.  Was my taste experience worth waiting in line for two hours on a Sunday morning in the summertime Texas heat?  You betcha.\\n\\nUpdate:\\n\\nI revisited Franklin's and had another great experience, this time with the pork ribs.  I've never liked pork ribs.  I'm generally not a big fan of pork, and I don't like the texture of rib meat or the visible fat content.  Franklin's ribs have changed my mind.  I had to be talked into trying a portion of my friend's ribs, but after the first taste I asked for more, just to be sure I really tasted ribs so amazing I will order them for myself my next visit!"},{"name":"Bambinelli's","address":"3202 Northlake Pkwy NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"This is a great neighborhood Italian restaurant.

The concept was cute but out of everything I ordered, only 1 fish was good. Which was the filet steak and lobster sushi roll. I also ordered truffle burger (buns super dry and burger was ok), truffle Parmesan bacon fries (didn't even taste truffle and way too much Parmesan, bacon was burnt...had way better ones elsewhere), crab dip (everyone raves about it but it was good... but not amazing), seaweed salad (taste like a market bought one), and the bacon coleslaw (disgusting! When told server she goes it's a hit or miss... like the coleslaw itself was dry and had no flavor. It wasn't the bacon's fault). Talk about the server... barely came by our table. I had to almost grab her myself to ask for refill, utensil, clear the table, and the check. Most annoying part was she only helped the table next to me. Then other servers were so messy too. One dropped a bowl right next to me and didn't apologize. It literally slide to my feet! She just shrugged and picked it up and left like it was normal. For the price, this was not a good dining experience. I could've ate something else at citywalk."},{"name":"Franklin Barbecue","address":"900 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I have really struggled with this review because I think perhaps my expectations were too high given all the raves I have heard about Franklin. I don't get it...a three-hour wait to get BBQ is the same amount of time that I could drive to Lockhart or Driftwood, eat and be home again for what it was to get food here. The experience was certainly one that I am glad I did (particularly to see the football fans, etc. out there on a Saturday morning), but the reward at the end of the line wasn't one that I would return for. We got a sampler tray (more meat than you can imagine) and I tried everything but the ribs...here's my feedback:\\n\\nBrisket = B (people said \\"best I've ever had!\\" and I am not sure where else they have had brisket as this was just OK to me...)\\nPulled Pork = A (by far my favorite...moist and pulled just right)\\nTurkey = A- (my second favorite and I am not a huge turkey fan...this certainly impressed, but I don't know too many people who wait 3 hours for turkey unless it is Thanksgiving)\\nSausage = D (to be fair, I am not a huge BBQ sausage fan anyway, but the skin was super tough...hard to chew it OR cut it...and the sausage itself just tasted greasy, no real flavor to it)\\n\\nThere are three sauce choices, which certainly provided some nice options...none were life changing though.\\n\\nThe staff is friendly and attentive, while you are in line and when you get to the counter. They are working on a ktichen expansion, which should mean they will have more to satisfy their customers...tip we learned is that they do do 100 lbs of pre-order takeout orders a day, so get those orders in early (particularly on the weekend) to get the golden ticket to the front of the line and indulge sooner than most of the other suckers (like myself on my visit) waiting three hours for some grub."},{"name":"ADios Cafe","address":"180 Walker St SW, Ste D","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Service was great.

So this stay happened for us by mistake since my friend booked this location instead of the usual city center one we stayed at! I was less than thrilled since you can't have the same walk around downtown experience here. You gotta uber every single you wanna go. Oh boo!! What's the fun in that! Portland is fun and weird when you walk all over town!!! And eat food carts! And go to entertainment clubs! Meet random hipsters! Eat more food carts! And stumble back to your hotel room for a few hours nap! Well, you get the plan!! \\n\\nSo, this place was less than ready/prepared for such activities since the closest thing to this place was a mickey D and subway! There's no partying and walking back here!! Hotel lobby was much bigger, brighter! It was empty when we arrived but seems busier later at night! Charlies bar gives you 15% off with your check in! Woot woot!\\n\\nThe hallways are a little outdated as well as the rooms. The beds are nice. Compared to the other location: this was like night and day!! Bigger room though since you are not in downtown anymore!! We came, we stayed in room in our pjs! Drank coffee! Drank adult beverages and bonded all over again!! \\n\\nService came in to play the next morning when we ran out of coffee!! Like we are so seattle!!! 4 of us finished 8 cups the first day! And I asked for more: they were super polite. Brought it to us with cups and all the extras. Even asked what kind of cups we wanted ( like in room dining cups or togo). That was nice. Super friendly lady too!! Thanks for saving us from being zombies all day!! \\n\\nNow the final star was saved by a shoe!! No for real!! I left my favorite pair of heels here by accident. Who took the heels off and put it in the closet? I did!! Didn't realized it till I was on my train back! Last time this happened to me in a different hotel: they told me I never left any shoes!! I totally knew I did!! \\n\\nAnyways: they checked, they called and voila! They have my favorite loubies! All clear/black/ strappy heels that fits like a glove and oh so comfy. Granted, they were my backup pair but still! I ended up leaving a voicemail for housekeeping since they will be shipping it back to me! I waited a whole day for it! And there she was! The nicest lady ever called me back the next day: told me my options! I can go back there and pick it up within 60 days or they can UPS it!! She even checked to tell me how much it would cost!! Easy peasy! Now I have my tracking number ready and waiting for my almost lost shoes!! Saved by the shoes for real!! If all hotels are just as nice as this!! \\n\\nAverage hotel but they went above and beyond for service in making us happy! Oh thanks for the late checkout too!!

I'd order it again - the noodles had good texture, it was very tasty, and I liked how they packed in a little pouch of hot chili flakes into the box. If I was rating on the Pad See Ew alone, this would be a 3.5 star review. However... my experience with the salad really brings it down a couple notches.\\n\\nThe flavours in the salad weren't bad, but it was just so watery that it actually leaked through the paper box, through the paper bag that they gave us to carry them in, ended up breaking the bag, and both boxes of food ended up falling onto the ground in our parking lot just as we were getting home. Luckily most of the food stayed inside the boxes, but there was some leaky clean-up to deal with, which was annoying.\\n\\nThe Pad See Ew was promising enough though, that if I was in the neighbourhood again, I'd try a couple other dishes to see if they can redeem the salad fiasco."},{"name":"Hansik","address":"2639 E 49th Avenue","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"I'm new to the neighbourhood and just moved to the area a few weeks ago and I've been to Hansik 3x already.

The only drawback is that for the price ($10.95) there's only 2-3 pieces of pork bone in the soup.  Usually when I'm done eating pork bone soup, the bones are piled high...this one not so much...otherwise I would have given it 5 stars.  My bf had the marinated beef in rice with lettuce... so good!  At $6.99 for the big bowl that we ended up sharing, this one is a good bargain... I think I'll get this one next time.\\n\\nThe little appetizers that come before the meal are awesome.

First couple where crispy and crunchy the third one was burnt on the bottom badly. Here is the positive criticism, pressing the dough in the metal pan will never work, why? The chef is squeezing all the oxygen out of the dough that's why. You must only use the tips of your fingers to starting compressing from middle outward, at this point you must stretch with tips of fingers, this is the only way it will rise and make a nice puffed outer crust. Second bottom burning, the reason it's burning you guys have to much flower underneath il impasto, and too much flower on the paddle you transfer pizza to oven, pull your pizzas onto the paddle this will limit you from using that much flower. third your fire in the oven is out, should be always a flame. Products used are great, must use a bit of salt on fresh pomodori served. 2 ovens would be enough as you can cook up to 5 pizzas at a time.

My tater tots and fries tend to be cooked to the point of death... all over fried with no flavor. The brisket chili was too heavy with the tomato base and came across overly acidic, an addition of beans would have been nice. The fried okra is nice, but they do run out.

They buy the best cut of beef that is double the price of other BBQ places and start smoking it at 3am to be served at 11am. The brisket, ribs, and sausage are the best items on the menu. The moist beef is so delicious it melts in your mouth. The dark sauce is espresso based is delicious. The staff are also really nice and friendly.\\n\\nThe wait can be up to 4 hours!! People usually aim to arrive at 8:00am. Bast 9:30am on a weekend and you could be there til 2pm.\\n\\n1. Everyday at 9am a resident takes a picture of what the line looks like on twitter (FranklinBBQline). Usually weekdays have the shortest lines. Check the twitter page.\\n2. Bring lawn chairs, cards, games, and a cooler of beer to pass the time. Make friends with the people around you.\\n3. If you didn't prepare, there is a CVS around the corner where you can buy drinks. Or you can just buy drinks from Franklins at a slight premium. Beers were $3, water $1.\\n\\nIf you don't know how much BBQ to get, the staff knows best and will be able to recommend what is a good amount of food. I got a pound of brisket, quarter pound of ribs, quarter pound of sausage for myself. It lasted me about 3-4 meals. I wish they offered mac and cheese or cream of corn as sides, but they primarily focus on their meats.\\n\\nOverall, the experience was a lot of fun. We met a couple from London and after just coming back from Europe, we had great company with us while we waited. It was definitely the best BBQ I've had, but it is something that I would only do once.

Two sides I enjoy are the tater totchoes and the Mac and cheese. My soda of choice is grape soda with free refills. They have a full service bar that features adult slushes, draft micro beers and retro cans like Burger and Schlitz. The music at this particular location seems to be a feed like pandora featuring top 40 and it clashes with the rap emanating from the kitchen, the parking could be better and the wieners could stand to be a bit hotter.

The Heather has guacamole that had a nice kick to it and definitely my favorite of the two. If I had more time in Austin I'd definitely try out the rest of the vegetarian options and even get a breakfast taco (which Austin is known for). \\n\\nBtw the salsa bar was my favorite thing!

The food is always delicious, fresh, and is something I feel sort of \\"good\\" about eating. I especially enjoy how they rotate in different sandwiches depending on the season. It's fun trying out the new sandwiches, although sad when a favorite is retired!\\n\\nIn terms of different sandwiches, here are my thoughts on the ones I've had in the last year:\\n\\nChickpea Fritter- this is the classic Clover sandwich, and they have absolutely perfected it. Crunchy falafel, crisp and colorful vegetables, and a portable pita wrapping it all together.\\n\\nHakurei Turnip- such a wonderfully balanced sandwich. There's the crisp slightly sweet raw turnips, a salty miso mayo, the sweet crunch of carrots, and some of the tastiest fried onions I have ever had. Would definitely recommend.\\n\\nThe Enzo- I'm fairly health conscious, so when I went to get my sandwich and saw it was topped with french fries, I cringed slightly. That being said, it was a very short lived cringe as really anything stuffed with fries and provolone cheese is going to be delicious\\n\\nPushpir- One of the few Clover sandwiches I found disappointing. Leaked about 1/4 cup of liquid all over the place(i.e. the table and my lap) and then was so spicy I couldn't eat it. I can definitely see how someone would really like it, but I wish I had been warned about the spice level\\n\\nJapanese Sweet Potato- I almost wanted to cry when I saw this was taken off the menu. My absolute favorite Clover sandwich I've had. Fingers crossed for its return.\\n\\nBreakfast Sandwich- poached egg, cheddar cheese, and a tomato. Nothing more, nothing less, and pretty much perfect. \\n\\nTomato Sandwich- Wonderfully simple. Just mayo, lettuce, tomato, and cheddar. If you are a tomato purist, then this is the ultimate sandwich. This is the only Clover sandwich that I finished, and immediately went and bought a second because I didn't want to stop eating it. \\n\\nHungarian Beet Sandwich- Absolutely wonderful. Beautiful beets took center stage. Walnuts and cabbage added a wonderful textural element. \\n\\nOverall, a fantastic place to grab breakfast, lunch, dinner, coffee, or a snack. Can't wait to see what the next sandwiches will be."},{"name":"Franklin Barbecue","address":"900 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Long line but worth it... one time!

The nice thing with having it delivered is that you don't have to deal with the mad parking situation, which can be a huge deterrent (and has been for me). Anyway I've eaten the beef brisket, smoked chicken, and pulled pork and enjoyed them all. I usually go for brisket though I can agree with other Yelpers that it can be dry here but also lean, which is a huge plus.\\n\\nThe mac-and-cheese is phenomenal. Fox Bros. makes theirs with shells, which is pretty awesome and the sauce is oh-so-creamy. I also have had cole slaw, baked beans, and collard greens. The cole slaw is good if you want something kinda refreshing on the side. Baked beans are good for baked beans but I typically prefer my beans to be all the way savory, rather than sweet. Collard greens are yummy as well. I vaguely remember getting the Brunswick Stew too, though I don't recall any specifics about it.\\n\\nThis place is probably deserving of its hype, though the wait can still seem very daunting if you come during a weekend evening. If you want to avoid the extensive time before being able to get down and dirty with your food, try to hit up Fox Bros. during non-peak hours.

Add to that a myriad of experiences with shawarma and other such dishes, and one might call me a pro.\\n\\nWith a fixin' for a nice platter in a city that is not exactly known for this type of food, Boston Shawarma provided a ray hope. This was, unfortunately, mostly that - hope. \\n\\nMy first time here, I had the chicken and lamb platter. It was expensive (almost $11), but I was pleased with the weight of my treasure chest that was the Styrofoam container. Within, there was an ample supply of chicken and lamb, accompanied with rice, hummus, hot sauce, salad and a side of pita. The chicken and lamb looked a little dry, and tasted similarly. Flavor was lacking, and was mostly obtained from the hot sauce. The hummus, however, was more than just a surprise addition, as it tasted delicious and complemented the meat.\\n\\nMy second visit had me once more try the chicken and lamb platter, but I also had their lamb pie for $3.50. This time, I did not make the mistake of forgetting to request \\"no salad\\". They happily obliged and filled the space with fried. Unfortunately, the story of the meat remained unchanged - relatively dry and bland. The lamb pie fared no better, being substantial in quantity but not quality.\\n\\nOverall, this is the type of venue that would best be frequented late at night when a voracious appetite requires settling - preferably while under the influence of something that makes anything exceptionally good.

Nice, dim-lit pub, good beers, and typically pretty good service. The location has definitely been helped by the removal of the obnoxious and ugly I-93 elevated highway.

First bad service experience was on one of the Eat East Tuesday nights, escargot was great, drinks were okay, but service was slow and the waitress was nonexistent most of the time, when they weren't even very busy. A friend ordered a happy hour $5 wine and when it came time for the bill, she noticed the cost of the wine on the bill was 2x what she was expecting being that she ordered the $5 happy hour wine. After the waitress finally came out to us after a long time of waiting, my friend pointed out this wine price discrepancy, after which the waitress replied \\"oh, we were out of that wine so I gave you a similar one instead but it is more expensive\\". My friend said \\"don't you think you should have said something before or at least at the time you brought out the wine?\\" The waitress replied \\"oh well I've already printed the bill so what do you want me to do?\\". My friend simply replied \\"do whatever you think is right\\". The waitress took her card and the bill and went on to charge what was already on the bill (2x more expensive wine), and left it at that. We were pretty floored.\\n\\nToday's experience: went for brunch on a Sunday. Again, not very busy at all, our waitress probably only had our table, MAYBE one other one. Service was fine until it came down to the food service. The four of us had each ordered a bagel plate, and I had additionally ordered the grilled asparagus and fried egg dish. The bagel plates were all brought out, and the waitress asked us if she could get us anything else, to which I replied asking about the grilled asparagus plate. She said that they had broken the egg (yolk) so they were cooking another one. TEN MINUTES LATER, we were all done eating our bagels (mine was cold and stale by the way), and my grilled asparagus/fried egg was still not out, nor had we seen the waitress at all. I went and looked for her in the restaurant but she was nowhere to be found, must have been in the kitchen back area the whole time. Finally she brings the asparagus out and I said \\"Thanks. That took a really long time for an egg though and everyone has been done eating for a while\\". She asks me \\"oh do you want it to go?\\". I was at a loss for words so I just said yes. I ended up eating it in the to go box at the table because I didn't want to eat it cold later after I had already waited like 15 minutes for it. It was a tasty dish by the way! Nothing was comped or addressed further.\\n\\nIf the restaurant was ever busy maybe I'd be understanding but this was twice that I saw lack of attention to detail and our waitresses not addressing obvious issues.

During my visit there, I had their Key Lime Sliced Pie, Chocolate Individual Tart and Macadamia Nut Tart. I initially wanted their Coconut Cream Sliced Pie, but they apparently didn't have any ready yet. Not wanting to have to wait 1 hr, I decided to get their Pecan Sliced Pie. I quite enjoyed all of the treats. Price-wise, I do find the costs for most of their tarts to be quite steep; however, I think that their Macadamia Nut Tart to be reasonable since the nut's expensive, and they really load a lot of in the tart. Now, I should mention that I probably got undercharged during my visit: the guy at the till seemed to have trouble when he rung me up, and when I got my receipt, I noticed that he charged me $5.60 for everything, even though the prices on the board for their Pecan and Key Lime Pies were $7.15 and $7.52 respectively. And...I didn't go back and correct the mistake (I'm an awful person :(). All in all, I'm quite impressed by the food there, and I think it's definitely worth checking out if you are visiting the Public Market.\\n\\nChocolate Individual Tart ($5.60):\\n3.5/5\\nAlthough the shortbread looked a bit blond, it was quite tender , albeit very crumbly. The chocolate ganache was quite good, melted in my mouth, and had a nice bittersweet flavour. I do find there to be a bit too much crust vs. filling.\\n\\nMacadamia Nut Tart ($5.60):\\n4.5/5\\nThis was similar to a pecan tart, except with macadamia nuts. The crust was tender and flaky. It was filled chock-full of macadamia, which were fresh, crunchy and had a wonderful rich flavour, and was coated in a thick gooey sugar. This is the first time that I've had a macadamia tart, and I seriously wish people would use this nut more often, its freaking fantastic! \\n\\nPecan Sliced Pie ($5.60, listed as $7.15):\\n4/5\\nThe crust once again was quite tender and flaky, although I did find the outer edge to be a bit too thick and overbaked. The filling was gooey and had a great caramel flavour, and a very generous amount of pecans. It was quite sweet - I personally didn't mind, but I think it might be a bit too much for others.\\n\\nKey Lime Sliced Pie ($5.60, listed as $7.55):\\n4/5\\nThe filling was smooth, creamy and sweet, with a texture that's similar too that of a cheesecake, while the breadcrumb crust cut easily had had a nice, slightly moist texture. I quite enjoyed the whipped cream as well, which seemed to have a slightly tangy flavour. I did find the filling to be lacking somewhat in lime flavour: I would have preferred there to be a bit more tang.\\n\\nSummary:\\nFood: 4/5\\nPrice: 3/5\\nService: N/A\\nOverall: 3.5/5\\nRecommendations: Macadamia Nut Tart, Pecan Sliced Pie, Key Lime Sliced Pie"},{"name":"Bob Evans","address":"9891 Brewster Ln","city":"Powell","stars":"2","text":"Very slow/boring service seems like they judge every customer there.

Everything about the place from the dusty decor to the scratched, dented bar top, the uneven bar stools, the chipped plates, poor service and the greasy place mats says \\"Please!  Put me out to pasture!\\"\\n\\nI'd last eaten here about 4 years ago and had enjoyed it.  The times have changed.  We went because we had a Groupon and just didn't feel like cooking on a Thursday night.  The restaurant was reasonably crowded, but there were seats at the bar, so we decided to eat there.  A couple who arrived when we did waited more than 10 minutes for a hostess who never appeared, and they ultimately turned around and left. We never saw a hostess during our entire meal. \\n\\nWe ordered drinks - my friend had a Hendrick's gimlet and I had a club soda.  It took more than 10 minutes for them to arrive, though no other orders for drinks arrived during that time from either the bar or the restaurant.  The bartender had to open a fresh bottle of Hendrick's, and all I could think was that he had to go to London to get it.  I was served my club soda in the tiniest glass I've ever seen for a non-alcoholic drink.  Three sips and it was gone, and I waited 15 minutes for it to be refilled.  The gimlet only filled 2/3 of the martini glass in which it was served and according to my friend, was very poorly made.  \\n\\nWe ordered carpaccio as an appetizer and two different pasta dishes as entrees.  The food took well over 30 minutes to arrive, and during that time no one ever spoke to us about its tardiness.  We were never offered bread (it's an Italian restaurant, no?), and when we looked around the restaurant, we saw that no one at any table had any bread, either. \\n\\nWhen the carpaccio arrived, it was 4 very thin slices of beef that were stuck to the plate at 12, 3, 6 and 9 o'clock.  Over them was dumped an overdressed baby greens salad and at about 2 and 8 o'clock, small mounds of blue cheese crumbles were stacked.  This presented two problems.  First, it wasn't anything like what we expected from the description on the menu (which mentioned nothing about Mt. St. Salad).  Second, i LOATHE blue cheese, the menu promised goat cheese, and no one ever addressed with us the fact that they'd substituted one for the other.  Needless to say, I did not enjoy the dish.  \\n\\nWhen the food finally arrived it was, well, tired.  The pasta had clearly been pre-cooked, warmed up and then left under a heat lamp.  Mine was pretty dry & chewy, but was tolerable with the sauce.  The clams were overcooked and chewy, however, and the broccoli rabe was not cooked at all, leaving it too bitter to even eat. \\n\\nMy friend's dish was better, but the pasta faced the same issue - it had clearly been pre-cooked, reheated and then left to die under the heat lamp.  He was really hungry, so he ate it, but said as he did so that he wasn't enjoying it.  \\n\\nAs we left the restaurant, we said to each other \\"That was the waste of a perfectly good dining opportunity.\\"   We walked back to the car, parked across the street from the burger place at the corner and I thought \\"Wow - I wish we'd just gone there.\\"\\n\\nIf you're thinking of Appetito?

Just when you think there's no seats, someone gets up. Super pleasant and knowledgeable staff.\\n\\nService: The staff was awesome, pretty much figured out what I wanted or needed before I even asked. Great talking to them and the guys behind the counter asked and gave me exactly the cut and type of meat we were hungry for.\\n\\nFOOD: Brisket was perfect. It was a touch greasy, but the flavor was simply awesome and the brisket was amazing. It melted as soon as it hit your tongue.The sausage wasn't as flavorful as I thought it would be, but it was still really good.

They are very consistent with the flavor of their tea (I usually get their original milk tea or jasmine milk tea).  And the boba always has a good chewy textures.  The stamp card is a good way to save 10%, making their drinks a good value (especially now compared to Bubble Bubble, which increased their prices on June 1). Lastly, I am changing my review from 2 to 4 stars mainly because of the chicken wings. Sooo goood.  Crispy with a good, subtle spice flavor.  Best Chinese/Taiwanese style chicken wings I've had.  If they would open at 11am instead of 12pm and actually have boba ready when they open, I'd give them 5 stars. \\n\\nOriginal review: \\nVery poorly managed.  Twice now I've come at 1200-1210 (they \\"open\\" at 12) and have been told it'd be 1230 until the boba is ready.   Why not just come earlier and prepare before opening?\\n\\nAnyways... the milk tea is actually pretty good for Portland.  I like it that they have milk, sweetness and ice options.   The original milk tea has a clean and smooth taste and isn't too sweet (I wish I could get 75% sweetness level but they only have 0/50/100%).  \\n\\nThe honey toast is decent but is way overpriced.

The bar was almost above my reach and there was almost nowhere for me to wait without blocking the aisle.  We were told there would be a 35 minute wait, but when they learned I was in a wheelchair that changed to a 45 minute wait.  I could understand this and we asked if we could wait at the bar and maybe get our appetizers there.  We were advised we could, so we did.  about an hour later my companion went back to the entry podium and asked if our table was getting close.  She was told that when the hostess saw us at the bar they took us off the list for a table figuring we'd eat at the bar.  (Remember now, I'm in a wheelchair so I had to take my plate off the bar and hold it in my lap just for the appetizers).\\n\\nWhen we got to our table, we ordered our brunch off the menu.  The menu was disappointingly limited, but I ordered their version of an eggs benedict.  Barely resembles a REAL eggs benedict.  Poor choice on my part - my companion decided to play it safe and ordered a cheeseburger with fries.  While the cheeseburger was acceptable, the fries were so salty they were barely edible.  Worse though than the food was the cleanliness!  We were at a table that abutted the partition.  Just as the food was being delivered I looked closely at the partition and there was some kind of food splashed on it.  It was not fresh.  Upon closer inspection I looked at the \\"gap\\" between the table and where it was affixed to the partition.  There was some kind of food, dirt and oil in that crack.  We ate, but called the manager over to show him what we'd discovered.  He explained that they were going to replace much of the wood in the near future.  This had NOTHING to do with my complaint.  I showed him I could scrape the dried food off the partition and it was an issue of cleaning, not remodeling!  Then I pointed out the \\"gunk\\" in the crack and he acknowledged that it was dirty.

We wanted a refill on the salad before our meal came out but she was too busy talking to the other employees to even pay any attention to us. My wife's food had a piece of Carla's hair in it. We knew this was bound to happen because her hair was in her face each time she was at our table. Not pulled back like it's supposed to when you're serving people food. My wife doesn't like to complain so she just took out the hair and didn't eat the part of her dish that the hair was in. Carla didn't even come to check on us at all after dropping off the food. Again, we saw her talking to other members of the staff rather than check on us. When she finally came back to see us we were done with our food. She asked if we were all set for the check,  she did not even bother to ask if we wanted any dessert.  We decided to just pay for our bill and get some dessert at Applebee's. Before we left we asked the take out person if we could speak to a manager and after waiting for 10 mins for a manager we decided to leave. This was our worst experience ever at this Olive Garden location. It will take a while for us to recover from that experience."},{"name":"Punjab Cafe","address":"653 Southern Artery","city":"Quincy","stars":"4.5","text":"Only reason not five is decor.

We brought two of our friends as well. It definitely was not as great as our first experience over a month ago. Our reservations were for 9:30pm and we weren't seated until after 10 - we had to keep reminding the hostess' that we were there. Anyways, once we were finally seated, we got stuck next to an 18 year old's birthday party and they were absolutely obnoxious. It then took at least 10-15 minutes for our waitress to finally come over and take our orders. \\n\\nOur goblet was great, and our friend had a strawberry milkshake and loved it. My boyfriend ordered the macaroni and cheese balls appetizer (they were bomb we highly recommend them). I ordered a regular burger and asked for it to be medium well and it came back completely well done. At that point it was close to 11pm and I was starving so I ate it. My boyfriend ordered the steak (way overpriced) and specifically asked for it to be medium rare. It came back completely well done. The waitress felt bad and asked if he wanted another but at that rate we were over it and were ready to leave. \\n\\nWe were super bummed that it didn't live up to the hype we had when we first visited.

This enables them to tell you what they have available by the time you reach the counter.\\n\\nSure enough, I arrived at the counter at 12:30 (about 45 min later, as predicted) and yes, they still had plenty of Brisket and Ribs available - as promised. Once there the staff is efficient and friendly.

Jeez, I don't even love meat so much.\\n\\nWell, here I am, in Austin Texas. \\"You have to eat the BBQ\\" they said. OK. \\"Franklin's is the best\\" they said. OK then.

OK, this better be worth it.\\n\\nTwo and a hours pass by. Surprisingly quickly to be honest. And we're in. We ordered the lot, to share: pork ribs, pulled pork, brisket, sausages.

I have reached peak foodie heaven. This is the best meat I have ever tasted. I will remember this meal for years to come. I will. \\n\\nWe ate till we couldn't eat anymore. We still had loads of meat and salads left over. And the damage? About $25 pp for So. Much. Food. Worth every penny and then some. We pack up the food. We're staying at a hostel.

Should you wait in line? Hells yeah. Will you regret it? Not a chance. This is the point where food goes beyond food. Beyond being a foodie. This is an experience to treasure. It is food art.

We asked then to sit at the bar and ordered a medium, two-topping deep dish within just a few minutes of sitting down. \\n\\nAfter 35 minutes, we asked how much longer the pizza would be (there were three other tables in the whole place) and we were told ten more minutes. 20 minutes later, I asked again and was told they put the wrong toppings on our pizza. The bartender (I don't remember her name, but I think she had bright red hair) asked us if we wanted THAT pizza, and I told her no, we wanted the pizza we ordered. \\n\\nShe said if we wanted the pizza the way we ordered it, like she was shocked we didn't want a pizza different than what we ordered, it would be another 25 minutes. I asked her why, if it just had wrong toppings, it took almost an hour for the first pizza, but if they remade it,, it would only take 25 minutes. She didn't have an answer, so we deducted that our pizza was likely forgotten, someone didn't put it in, whatever. It wouldn't take an hour to make a medium, two-topping pizza at 9pm and 25 minutes to 'remake' it an hour later. Someone dropped the ball, we never got our food, and I will never, ever be back here.\\n\\nIt's sad too, I just moved here and I'm from Chicago. I would've loved to have had a Chicago style pizza joint to take my friends to, but thankfully, there are plenty of pizza places on 6th Street so we got our dinner shortly after leaving.

I found its location on 6th street to be a bit odd.  I get the feeling who ever scouted the location was only in Austin for an hour and picked that spot.  It's surrounded by bars and feels like a bar with some seating when you get inside.

I enjoyed my plain cheeseburger, but the house sauce just ain't flavorful enough. So I piled on the special onions to ramp my burger from 'pretty decent' to 'mouthful of awesome.' These onions -- pickled? spiced? whatever, they're awesome, snag some on the condiments table. I like all the topping combinations they offer, like the BBQ Blue (bacon, blue cheese, barbecue sauce) and Sunday Morning, with an egg, ham, and a fascinating tomato jam. \\n\\nI think the fries are pretty all right, but I like my fries thin anyway. It'd be cool if fries or onion rings came with the burger, but whatevz, it's fast food. And even so, I've always found the service friendly and non-surly, unlike your local McD's. \\n\\nLastly, Flat Patties is the first place I've been in 'round these parts that has Mexican Coca-Cola.

One friend had the black linquni with scallops &shrimp; and she liked it well enough, the other friend and I had the Penne Puttanesca which was nice with all those capers, olives and....anchovies? I never saw nor did I taste any influence of the anchovies, sadly.\\n\\nThe salad was okay, the minestrone soup was excellent. The bread was very yummy with a good olive oil and an excellent balsamic vinegar. I asked for the name of it but the waitress never did tell me. Drat!

Now that I have had it, I can honestly say that if you have never had bbq before, don't come here. It will ruin all other bbq places for you. Franklin's has the most amazing pieces of meat you will ever taste. The flavor is robust and the meats are all cooked to perfection. The moist brisket will just melt in your mouth. Surprisingly though, the ribs were my favorite, the meat just falls off the bone. There is no need for bbq sauce, but they do have three different ones if you are so inclined. There's no wonder why Franklin's has been voted best bbq in Texas so many times.\\n\\nLike everyone has said before, you really need to get here early. This is pretty much a whole morning into the afternoon experience. We arrived at 7:55am on a Tuesday and there were already 30-40 people in front of us (when the staff came around, they told us we would be eating at around 11:30-12:00, which was right on the dot). We were going to stand or sit on the ground, but found out that they have camp chairs there for the patrons to use. Waiting isn't bad at all. We pretty much chilled, read some books, and hung out with all the other hungry and excited people. Some people brought coolers and had themselves a party. Some people even set up some tailgating games in the parking lot. Franklin's opened up at nine for people who needed to use the restroom or wanted to buy beer.\\n\\nThere's only one staff member cutting the meat, so it's a slow process to get everyone through. Again, it's totally worth it and we definitely didn't mind after already waiting for three hours. Staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. I'm guessing that most people who have waited in the line have already researched and know exactly what they want to get. Remember that they sell each meat by weight. If you don't know what weight to get of each, check out my picture. We ended up getting 1 lb of brisket (moist and lean), 1 lb of ribs, 1 sausage, 1/4 lb of turkey, potato salad, coleslaw, and 1 bourbon banana pie. This ended up being two meals for two. Also, don't sleep on the pies! The bourbon banana pie was legit, this coming from a non-pie guy. Hands down the best bbq in my life. Go!

Perfect carnivore hideout prior to a show at the Paradise or Brighton Music Hall (formerly Harper's Ferry). Pit Boss Sampler is perfect for 3 people and nicely priced at $39. Includes most every kind of meat they have and a dish of each side plus 2 corn bread squares.\\nI tried most everything (oh me and my gluttonous ways). \\n\\nThe meat - \\nThe ribs (spare and baby back) were smokey and delicious. The baby back were a little dry though and needed to be slathered with copious amounts of one of their 4 sauces. \\nThe chicken (fried and smoked) were moist as well. Loved the wings. Just the right amount of spice to 'em. \\nSpeaking of spicy, the sausage link on a stick had a nice fiery kick to it and the little cubes of brisket (I think) were morsels sent straight from BBQ heaven. \\nThe pulled pork was ok but once again, a little too dry. But like I said before, nothing a healthy dollop of BBQ sauce couldn't cure.\\n\\nSide dishes - \\nCollard greens were tasty especially mixed with the molasses heavy baked beans.\\nMashers with gravy was standard but the cole slaw was superb and offset the heat of the spicier meat dishes.\\nMac & cheese looked good although I didn't have any.\\nRice and beans was a cajun BBQ mix of perfection with diced veggies thrown in for good measure.\\nPotato salad also held it's own against the spicy BBQ sauces.\\nCornbread was very tasty with the kernals of corn bursting with flavor inside.\\n\\nMisc - \\nService was excellent. Sat down right away and Ian, our server, was constantly checking up on us for beer refills. Could have used a moist towelette for the cleanup though.\\nPrices seemed reasonable. We only got one thing though so who knows.\\nBeer selection seemed ok with a couple of micros and PBR on tap.\\n\\nIn all, a solid dining experience and reasonably good BBQ in Allston area. They usually have some cool specials like all-you-eat-wings night on Mondays I think. Might like to try this out sometime in the future.

We also consumed about two full baskets of cornbread during a single round of drinks - the bread is *that* good.

It's worth every penny, so get involved.  \\n\\nDinner has always been on the inconsistent side and even though I've had three separate dinners here, I can't remember anything specific other than it was fine. \\n\\nCome for the drinks, stay for the tapas and make plans for weekend brunch."},{"name":"Supreme Roast Beef","address":"18 Maple St","city":"Danvers","stars":"3.5","text":"I was a huge fan of this place about a year ago, but recently, the quality of the staff has gone way down.

It serves well for all of those occasions. \\n\\nChristopher's serves what I would say is better than average pub food. They have a large selection of your typical appetizers and their burger and sandwich choices are excellent. They have specials every day, covering a burger/sandwich, a pizza, and a ravioli. I've never ordered any of the pasta dishes, but I've tasted them and they are superb. (Avoid desserts, though. The one down side.)\\nAs others have said, their nachos are dynamite, although a bit pricey. I think it's worth it because the toppings are better quality. (If you want big, cheap nachos, go to Tavern on the Square.) Also, the draft beer selection is top notch. One days when I'm feeling more adventurous and a bit more spendy, I get the prickly pear margarita or the lime rickey, but all of the cocktails look good. \\n\\nChristopher's is a solid pub and one that I'm glad is walkable."},{"name":"Sarku Japan","address":"2901 S Capital Of Texas Hwy","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"i love this place more than i care to admit. who knew mall food would give me cravings? they've gone up a little in price recently, but it's still good and relatively cheap food. a tray of rice, chicken teriyaki and veggies (steamed cabbage, carrots, broccoli). i can see how none of this sounds appealing, but that's fine. while you're still skeptical, can you step aside and let me get in front of you? the longest line at the food court should tell you something. granted, you do have to wait a little for them to make it, but that's even better! you know your stuff is fresh when it's made right then. i've never felt the need to double the meat (extra $1.19 now) b/c what's given is plenty. must try if you haven't."},{"name":"Super Fusion Cuisine","address":"54 Mt Auburn St","city":"Watertown","stars":"4.5","text":"Prices a bit steep, but otherwise great place for quality sushi.

We were prepared for a wait, but with good company and a New York Times crossword book, the 50 minute wait passed quickly. In hindsight, I'd wait a few more hours to relive this meal again.\\nThey have a text message system so that you get a text when your table is ready! Our party of 7 was seated, and our waitress let us know that they were out of short rib for the night and were quickly running out of brisket. Definitely didn't hold anything against the restaurant for running low on meat considering that they were nearing closing and the restaurant was hopping.\\n\\nFOOD:\\nIf you come with a group (which I recommend), just order a ton of meat and sides so that everyone can dig in - comes out to be cheaper than getting individual plates. We ordered 2 pounds of brisket first before they ran out, a full rack of ribs, a whole chicken, mac and cheese, tater tots, chili mac, and fries. There was truly nothing that we didn't love. \\n-Brisket: For me, the brisket was the deal breaker. I've had Texas BBQ in Austin (Terry Black's) and honestly this was so much better. No shade on Terry Black's, but that just attests to HOW GOOD Fox Bro's brisket was. We got 1 lb of fatty and 1 lb of lean, and while I prefer the fatty, both cuts were delish. I was worried that by the end of the night, we would be getting some crusty pieces of scrap meat, but NOPE. Best brisket I've ever had. \\n-Ribs: Wow. Loved these no sauce needed, sweet, salty, fall off the bone ribs. The succulence of those ribs is truly a work of art. Try them for yourself and see.\\n-Chicken: After gobbling brisket and ribs, i was too full to go for the chicken, but people at my table loved it even more than the ribs! Looked and smelled fantastic.\\n-French fries: Had some special kinda sweet, kinda spicy seasoning that made the fries the perfect pairing for the meet. Finger lickin' good.\\n-Tater tots: Ended up ordering another basket after we finished the meat. Have never had tater tots that crispy and flavorful in my life.\\n-Mac and cheese/chili mac: Yummy, but tots and fries still top in my opinion.\\n\\nSERVICE:\\nI was really happy with how nice our waitress was considering how busy the place was and how tiring it looked to work there. After hearing how we wanted brisket and were unsure of whether to get fatty or lean cut, she set aside two pounds of the remaining brisket for us with 1 lb fatty and 1 lb lean. Super good about refilling drinks for us, and was very accommodating when we asked to order one more basket of tots 10 mins after the kitchen closed. Also, got everyone at our table Fox Bro's stickers when we asked.\\n\\nOTHER: \\n-Merch: They have shirts on the menu and hung up, but make sure that you ask to see the full selection in the back. I got a light blue tank top for $25 and have been wearing it all the time since. Good quality, good design, and the name of a great BBQ place on the front.\\n-Bathroom: Clean, but just be careful when you're opening the door on the way out! Accidentally hit our waitress with the door on the way out (oops!) while she was opening a cabinet in the back merch room that the bathroom opens up to.\\n-Parking: Not sure what exactly the parking situation is like since I Ubered, but BE CAREFUL WHERE YOU PARK. In the 80 minutes we were there, the hostess station called up 3 or 4 cars, seemingly because they were blocking cars or parked in the wrong places.\\n-Pricepoint: The way we ordered, our dinner came out to be $15 a person - for the amount of food you get, the price is so worth it.

However, I am not a fan of the staff at this location.  They are very rude to you when you order something that is not a combo that they normally make and ask you several times for your order over and over in a very not nice tone.  I've found this is just the staff actually making the sandwiches.  Once you go to the counter the checkout staff don't always seem to be the brightest (I always get the same exact breakfast and coffee and have been charged different random amounts on several occasions), but at least they are nice.\\nThe coffee is also not too terrific, pretty burned.  Probably better to go to sbux and then just get the bagel from here, but i'm usually in such a rush that I suck it up and deal w' the burnt coffee.

After reading an article in the newspaper that said The Hideaway was good, we checked YELP ratings, saw it had 4.something stars & decided to check it out.\\n\\nThere was no parking left in the tiny lot, so the husband dropped us off & went to park. This turned out to be a tactical error, as we couldn't turn around & get back in the car as soon as we walked inside & got blasted by crackling speakers distortedly blaring football & Cialis commercials. Then there was the cigarette smoke & the loud screaming patrons. Dad was still parking, ending up literally 6 blocks away, & we were all pretty hungry, so we ordered for all before Dad even got back, hoping we could be out sooner.\\n\\nUnfortunately we managed to hit the Hideaway during a Miami Dolphins game. Apparently this is where local Fins fans go to cheer on their team, which is fine; Dad is a huge football fan, so we understand team spirit. But this is a tiny place, & many of these people were really freaking out, in unison, as the Dolphins were loosing. They were yelling full blast & jumping about like they were in the stadium at the actual game. There was one patron in particular, \\"REX #14\\" according to his team jersey, who seemed to be the de facto leader of the gang, kind of like Rick on the Walking Dead, but obnoxious. Rex bellowed & screamed at the top of his ample lungs every single time ANYTHING happened. \\"AND THAT'S ANOTHER MIAMI DOLPHIN _______ (fumble, first down, etc.)\\" followed by big booming ham handed clapping & then pounding on the bar. It was like he was providing an extremely animated  running commentary of the whole event, & it sounded like he was doing so on a freaking bullhorn or a microphone set on maximum. Honestly, if I'd had some tomatoes, I might have beaned him good. He was dancing around, like the \\"hey, people, all eyes & ears on me, NOW!!\\" type, but on steroids, & there was no escaping him, not even with your ears covered. This is not The Hideaways fault, however.\\n\\nBut other things were; there was a dirty ashtray with used ciggies on our table. Our server, a nice but busy lady, took our orders, which were simple, because all they have here are wings, burgers, hot dogs & a few sandwiches & sides. The boys had \\"plain old burgers\\" as the menu calls them, me the \\"hot wings\\". After enduring 25 minutes of smoke & high dB noise while we waited for our food, some people near us lit up clove cigarettes. It was a toxic combination. I got up & went outside for air just as our food came, hoping to find a quieter low smoke place, but with street noise & those speakers set on \\"STUN\\" it was just as loud. Plus, there were lots of smokers there, too, so we just went back to our table to eat & run.\\n\\nWhen the burgers arrived, they were dry little meat pucks, ordered plain but drowning in ketchup. They came with bag chips. The hot wings were spiceless, room temperature to cool, tasted old, & were overcooked to the point of chalkiness in parts. The place was busy, but not crazy busy; maybe they par- cooked food ahead because it was game day, then reheated it, but this was not at all the \\"dank\\" \\"awesome\\" foods we'd read about. In all fairness, the celery was fabulous, however, some of the best celery ever.\\n\\nWhen I went to the restroom to wash my hands, I saw the kitchen. It was an area about the size of a closet or studio apartment kitchen & really \\"rustic\\". I've lived in the area since the 1980s, LOVE a good dive & have been to The Hideaway for drinks years ago, but this was the first & last time for food.\\n\\nSo, this is where I buck the trend to give The Hideaway 4-5 stars. My ears will never be the same after Rex's ridiculous ranting, my clothes stink like cigarettes, & I'm out $27 but didnt eat, so I'm hangry. I'm really sorry, don't usually do low stars, but imho, the food at this place blows. Oh, yeah, & if you do go, BRING CA$H!!!

The temperature was about 40*F, and patches of rain were pelting our faces. I offer my wife to wait in the car while I hold our place in line. Off to a good start.\\n\\nLuckily to numb the pain of having to wait for the worlds best BBQ I thought it would be a great idea to bring beers in my backpack. \\n\\nA friendly Englishman from London comes right behind and politely asks, \\"is this the right spot for the queue?\\" \\n\\nI look at him a bit dumfounded along with my cold, numb face. Confused, I ask \\"what is a queue?\\". \\n\\n\\"The line,\\" he courteously responds. He's apparently holding a spot for his wife as well. We introduce ourselves and so begin my teenage and college years at the line in Franklin BBQ. I offer him a beer and we start chatting about places we've been. Food we've had. Hours pass, and a few more beers we consume. The line gets longer, and the more people I meet. Conversations with the people in front, the people behind us. We're all having a great time and I see the line getting longer by the minute.\\n\\nSo comes the time the doors are about to open, we call our wives and they come meet us in line. Now we are no longer teenage and college boys, we are grown adults. Having a great time with all the short relationships we've established and the doors open. We've died and gone to heaven.\\n\\nBrisket is sliced for us to sample. They take our orders and we order the crap out of everything. Then we meet the BBQ god himself, Mr. Aaron Franklin. He is courteous, polite, one of the least egotistic of any chef/person I have ever met. He's asking where my wife and I are from. Where in Austin we've eaten so far? \\n\\nAnd me, I can ask him anything! The meaning of life. How he gets his brisket to taste so great. What pearls of wisdom to offer to a fellow entrepreneur. And all I can say through my nervousness at the moment was \\"What beer can you recommend?\\".\\n\\nOye... \\n\\nI can see the cashier at the corner of my eye give us one of those \\"I can see how giddy you are\\" looks. \\n\\nMy wife and I sat together and enjoyed the meal with everyone we met in line. We laughed, and ate like we were all a family. Like we just enjoyed a whole lifetime together. Silly as it seems, it was true.\\n\\nWhat can I say that other reviewers haven't already written? \\n\\nWell, that waiting in line was unbelievably one of the best lines you can wait in. People are great, and it makes you believe for a short while that the world ain't so bad. Franklin BBQ is definitely one of those distractions.

Every so often they have a smoked filet mignon special, which is what heaven would taste like if heaven were made of delicious smoked cows. \\n\\nThey have great drink specials and the friendliest staff. They're quick to suggest options if you're overwhelmed by all the wonderful choices and happy to share in your enthusiasm for delicious meats. They have great cocktails and a solid beer selection, so this is a great place to grab a margarita and sit on the patio in the sunshine and gorge yourself on delicious animals. \\n\\nThe parking is a little cramped, and the place fills up quickly in the afternoons and evenings. But the wait moves fast, and there's street parking on the adjacent Elmira Place - just be respectful of the neighbors and don't block their driveways. \\n\\nThis is not a typical, down and dirty, hole-in-the-wall BBQ joint, so the prices are a little higher. But you are getting quality meats, fantastic sides and huge portions in a casual, family-friendly atmosphere. \\n\\nThey offer two BBQ sauces: a traditional red (which is also available for purchase by the bottle at the restaurant and in groceries across Atlanta) and a lesser-known white sauce, which is typically served with just the fried ribs; but if you ask sweetly, they'll usually bring you a side of it to try with whatever you've ordered. \\n\\nDefinitely give Fox Bros a try if you have some time to wait out the crowd - or consider getting some take-out. I'm certainly not above taking advantage of their efficient to-go business and getting a pork sandwich to go to shove in my face in the privacy of my own home; why should you?\\n\\nI'd also like to commend their catering business. They conveniently remind past customers of catering options before the holidays, and I've purchased many a smoked turkey and smoked ham for Thanksgivings, Christmases and even Easter for the family.

J described the flavor as \\"a liquefied bread\\" and i can't disagree. all the bits made for an unpleasant texture, and the lukewarm temperature didn't help. \\nmango chutney - salty and more jam than chutney, but i can't stop ordering it for some reason. i like to spread it on the garlic naan and then top with chickpeas and onion chutney.\\nonion chutney - pretty standard, but i wish they would add this as a pay-for menu item. i always ask for them to send at least two containers, but it's hit or miss whether they follow through. \\ntamarind sauce - really thin and sour. i usually like this condiment from other indian places but not here.\\nmint chutney - never seen any! \\n\\nregular menu items:\\nsamosas chaat - never had this dish before so i don't have much of a point of comparison. i thought it was quite good. i've ordered it each time and it just gets better. the last time i got it it had a really nice spice to it, too. finally! for an indian place the food is decidedly not that spicy. this is also a huge portion. it's listed as a cold appetizer but it is a hot dish, and i usually get it for my main and can barely make a dent in it. \\nchicken tikka - this is the appetizer, not the chicken tikka masala dinner. i did not eat much of this and would not order it again. i expected skewered marinated chicken, like thai style, but instead got a little styrofoam box of chicken chunks covered in overcooked sad looking pepper and onion strings with a few dehydrated lime wedges. like bad mexican. my biggest issue was the texture of the chicken. it just seemed...not right. spongey. you ever get food and just get that gut feeling you shouldn't eat it? yeah. \\ngobi pakora - deep fried spicy cauliflower. another item i haven't tried elsewhere, but it has piqued my interest for awhile. finally got this in our last order and i'm glad i did. these were so tasty! plus they give you about a dozen of them, too. the only thing i wish is that the batter was a bit crispier as opposed to soft, but maybe this isn't realistic for food that has to travel awhile, esp in styrofoam. still totally gonna get these little snacks again. \\nchicken curry - J always gets this and finishes the whole thing - never seen him do that with any other indian food and he's never inclined to try anything else. he loves it.\\nchicken vindaloo - this was just okay. the flavor was good - it was a tasty dish, but to me it just wasn't vindaloo. it wasn't spicy at all. also, both chicken dishes contain both white and dark meat, even though the menu says white meat. not a big issue for me, but ymmv. the curry and vindaloo also both come with a nice portion of rice. \\ngarlic naan - this is so good! i can never stop eating this. \\naloo (potato) naan - never had this before either, but i liked it. nice flavor. just got out-naan'd by the garlic one. \\n\\noverall we'll keep this as our go-to indian delivery place, but if you're in the mood to travel i'd recommend any of the places in cambridge or anmol in beverly if you're out that way. but for us over here in chelsea/everett, we're making it work."},{"name":"Sushi Oyama","address":"5152 Kingsway","city":"Burnaby","stars":"3.5","text":"That's already pushing it too.\\n\\nWhen it comes to uniqueness, especially with the plethora of sushi places in Burnaby, this one stands out, as it's in a nice mansion, or a former funeral home.

The place is clean and airy - as Melinda M. pointed out, with lots of room.  The prices are very affordable.  Two grown hungry men left with a tooth-pick in their mouths (OK - we didn't do that, but could have), with the damage being just north of 2 Lincolns - and one of us had an ice tea!  We each had the half combo sub, which is the size of a 6\\", but filled with a reasonably generous amount of meat and cheese and trimmings, including oil and vinegar.  Asking for whole wheat bread would be as futile as wanting a whole wheat pizza - it's not going to happen.  My 4 stars are in anticipation of that great NY-style pizza I'm going to have come Friday evening.  But first, to burn off that \\"little\\" sub, 3 miles each day, Paul: walk, run, or crawl, followed by some jumping jacks and a few burpees for good measure.

My boyfriend is from Memphis and said hands down they were the best grits he's ever tasted (sorry granny).  He had the Screen Door Sampler with the catfish and it was breaded just right and cooked to perfection. His sides of greens were amazing with chunks of ham like he had back home, the mac and cheese is a joke how good it is.  We will visit again very soon.

It was very large and very spicy - it was good but not at all what I had expected with nothing crispy about it.

I have been here for dinner several times and have taken numerous people here also, all of which fell in love and talk about their experience for months later.\\n\\nTheir pork broth is amazing. I can easily drink an entire bowl of just the broth as it envelops you with an incredible amount of flavor. The pork belly is delicious, I always order extra chasu as I'm never satisfied with just one piece. Fall apart in your mouth soft, enough fattiness but not excessively so, deliciousness. Their egg is unbelievably good too. The yolk is amazing with a gel like texture that makes you want more and more. I usually eat it in one or two bites to really get the texture of the egg, you don't want to let the yolk disperse and get lost in the broth. The Tonkotsus have yet to fail in giving me a foodgasm...and there have been many.\\n\\nAfter having tried most of the ramen options, my favorite is still the Tonkotsu. The Tonkotsu Sho-yu is excellent also, it has a higher flavor high with its added seaweed and soy sauce. However, I love the milkiness in the original Tonkotsu and it keeps me coming back. The Miso-Hot is an interesting item, I would have preferred the Miso-Not more I believe as I didn't find the spice adding much to the bowl. It still had great depth though I missed having chasu which was replaced with ground pork. The Tsukemen is delicious also, but a very different beast compared to the other three. It's a bit sweet, but still delicious and intensely flavored and also features a thicker more udon style noodle than ramen style. My optimal order is Tonkotsu w/ extra chasu, brussels sprouts, and egg.\\n\\nThe gyoza are nice, cooked well, not too pricey, well seasoned, not dry, and flavorful. The pork sliders are great too, surprisingly juicy and cripsy, though they do feel like less of a value than much of the rest of the menu. The curry bowl was fine, I didn't see what was japanese about it per say, it tasted like indian curried potatoes on top of rice, with sliced chasu on top.\\n\\nThe atmosphere is excellent.

The booth was reasonable, but the ramen had the worst texture in this world. The texture was starchy, and the noodles had no \\"chew\\" to them at all - I know this is what happens when you undercook noodles. Hell, this is what happens when you undercook spaghetti also. That is epic fail for a restaurant with \\"Ramen\\" in its name. \\n\\nSecondly, portion and pricing: I paid an extra $3 for extra Chashu (pork slices), and my bowl came with three small slices of pork. I'm starting to wonder if $3 buys only an extra slice? I can understand if this was really Japan where food is expensive, but for god sakes you are in Texas, a nice pork ribeye cut at HEB is $4.97/lb, be more generous to your customers.\\n\\nSo lets sum it up...\\nThe food, fail.

We also shared meatballs and marinara and caprese salad.  The caprese was good but the tomatoes they used seemed wrong.  Also, they weren't prepped right with the stem still in place.  Otherwise, it was nice.  The meatballs themselves were OK but the standout was the marinara honestly.  That sauce was SUPERB.  The main event was why we were there though.  The Carnavale was AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS.  The staff seemed nice enough too.

A PDX friend Chef Leo (Roost) asked us to meet there this past week. We also mentioned LM to a Flyingfish Seafood (Paul) friend - and he said \\"get the burger.\\" We made sure to order both mussels and the burger. We sat at the cooking bar and were taken care of by Stephen - front of the house and Valerie. Chef Neal was slinging mussels and was obviously busy as heck. The method was fun to watch. One can get Mussels: Mariniere - garlic, capers, herbs, chili flakes; Salsa Verde - tomatillo, jalape√±o, cilantro; Thai - green curry, green beans, coconut milk; Korean - gochujong, miso, kimchi; and Diavola - tomato, chilies, salami, garlic, basil. The chefs love their unique chili peppers and local fresh herbs. We enjoyed the Mariniere. I told Neal the mussels were like buttery pillows. These west coast mussels were Divine! (And not over salted.) We also had a delightful conversation with the Chef-Owner Aaron Barnett. Aaron and his partner Tommy also own the successful St. Jack in NW Portland. The butter lettuce salad on the LM menu is a reprise of The St Jack classic. We were unaware of this but read Cameron Addy is its creator. The LM salad brings together bib lettuces, radishes, and avocado. It is enhanced by a tarragon herb Dijon vinaigrette. The salad was bright refreshing and soothing. We compared it to Cafe Castagna's butter lettuce salad, and La Moule won this trip.\\nFinally our chef and artist friends arrived and we moved to a booth in the drinking bar area, where Ned did order the burger -local beef, thick bacon, triple creme Brie, and red onions on a toasted brioche bun.

They have revised their system a bit to have your order come out right when you sit down. That's pretty fast.\\n\\n-Appetizers: This is a place for ramen. I *could* call you names for having gripes against the gyoza here, but I wont. Also keep in mind that even though the gyoza, salad, and curry are technically \\"appetizers\\" they will often come out after your ramen, since this place is mainly designed to be an in-and-out style ramen churning machine. My advice would be to skip on the gyoza, and maybe get the curry or salad as a substitute for a kae-dama(extra noodles).\\n\\n-My Complaints:\\nThe ramen shop gets absolutely blasted with sun before sunset. It gets really hot inside... I'm not sure how to alleviate this, but I start sweating buckets if I come in at this time. The solution that I've come up with is to bring a headband/bandana so I can enjoy eating my ramen without wiping my forehead every minute.\\n\\n**Now for some new tips from going more times:\\n\\n-Recommendations:\\nIf its your first time, either get the tonkotsu ramen or miso ramen. Get an extra egg, the \\"corn on the bomb\\" and spicy bomb if you want the spice. (yes 3 add-ons, all completely worth it)\\n\\nIf it's your second+ time, try the tsukimen ramen. Don't be afraid of pronouncing it... hell you can just say \\"#4 please.\\" It's an amazingly flavorful dish, which has a very refreshing citrus element to it. This is PERFECT for those of use who douse our tacos and pho with lime. The proper way, as told by one of the owners is to eat half of the noodles without squeezing the lime that is included in the dish, then halfway in, squeeze the lime over the noodles, which will change the flavor palate quite a bit.\\n\\n-My personal favorite:\\nMy favorite currently is the Mi-So-Not (non spicy miso ramen), with an extra egg, spicy bomb, and corn on the bomb. Getting the spicy paste on the side lets you experience the miso broth by itself, and then decide how much spiciness you want to add in afterwards. The brussel sprouts in this ramen are absolutely mindblowing (channeling paul qui of Uchiko). \\n\\nMake sure to pair your ramen with a beer.

The Hawthorne/Belmont neighborhood really needs more cheap-eat restaurants like this, and Misto does what it does really well.

The bar area isn't that large and table are close but it's not too tight to make it uncomfortable. \\n\\nDrink: Champagne of Shandies (5/5!!!) - Apple Cider, brown sugar, miller highlife, apple chip. One of the BEST cocktails I've had. Admittedly, its on the very light end of the alcohol content spectrum so only gave a light buzz but was still delicious. It was sweet at the first sip and really hits home with the highlife smoothness and the subtle apple cider flavor. Totally wasn't prepared for how well it tasted. They only mix half of the miller highlife so they bring you the partly used bottle as well for you to top off if the drink is too sweet. Big tip! do not drink all the highlife bottle, save it to keep topping off the champagne as the brown sugar settles at the bottom. So as you consume drink, keep swirling it a bit to get the sugar back up, then top off with some of the highlife to re-balance the drink. I made the mistake of polishing off the highlife towards the end and didn't realize all the brown sugar was at the bottom. \\n\\nArtisan Ricotta (4/5) orange truffle honey drizzle, pistachio, roasted tomato, stewed olives, warm wheat bread. The ricotta spread was amazing, it was well balanced with the light sweet honey and definitely went well with the warm bread. There was only 3 roasted tomatoes which is a slight bummer since I liked the slight tang it gave to the overall spread. I'm not a big fan of olives so didn't really enjoy that part but won't ding the place for it. \\n\\nLobster Bologneses (3/5) squid ink tagliatelle, spicy tomato crema, English peas, parmeasan. This is sort of a disappointing dish. The main issue is the squid ink...the texture was totally off. It was totally limp in terms of firmness so it was like eating overcooked pasta and tasted bland. The chunks of nice lobster was good and light and cooked just right. \\n\\nService was excellent.

The pulled pork was rated a 5 out of 10 from my wife. My duck was served stone cold. It was a very small portion and had little taste. I sent it back and they tried to reheat it but it was still cold! I picked up the plate and it was stone cold. How can a highly rated restaurant serve hot food on a cold plate? It makes no sense and it is truly a rookie mistake.\\nIf you go avoid sitting near the fireplace. If they are seating guests outside, you are in the path of dozens of people walking past you.

I was introduced to barbecue in North Carolina, and dry, tough pulled pork that requires slathered (though admittedly delicious) bbq sauce to enjoy is not really my thing.

I wish eugene had a spot like this."},{"name":"South City Kitchen Midtown","address":"1144 Crescent Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Went here for a lunch meeting and I was not all that impressed.  Great service, location and atmosphere.  However, the chicken which is supposedly famous, was bland, kind of dry and lacked salt.  It could have been the day that we were there where it was made slightly different than normal (and thus lacking its famous flavor), but it was definitely not worth the $16 for the dish.  \\n\\nThe cornbread and biscuits were pretty good.  Overall, I would say it's a good place, but I need to try something else besides the chicken.  It just didn't win me over."},{"name":"Stubb's Bar-B-Q","address":"801 Red River St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"We were visiting Austin and really wanted BBQ so decided to try them. Meats were good and service was great."},{"name":"Screen Door","address":"2337 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Let me start off with saying I despise eggs and I do not like brisket. Coming to Screen Door changed my impression of them entirely. The Huevos Ranchero is a magical brisket and egg concoction. It had a perfect taste of smoky goodness blended with spices topped with red chimichurri. \\n\\nWe also got the chicken and waffles. GET 2 pieces of chicken. It's only an additional $1.25 per piece. The chicken itself is super moist and so savory when paired with the sweetness of the waffles. \\n\\nOverall a wonderful experience with our super sweet waitress, Sarah. Absolutely listen to her recommendations when she tells you what to get. Not a long wait and the portions are pretty big for good prices"},{"name":"Screen Door","address":"2337 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Both times I've been here, the food has been fine, once you get it. The long wait to get a seat and finally order and eat takes away from the food experience, frankly. A solid 4 stars for the food dwindles to three stars for the long wait."},{"name":"Screen Door","address":"2337 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Don't let the line bog you down. The Screen Door is worth every minute of agonizing wait. It's everything I hoped for and more. Hearty, comfort food with friendly service. \\n\\nDon't come when you're hangry. But even if you do, you can't help but be satisfied by the decadent pecan praline bacon and the succulent fried chicken atop sweet potato waffles. Did I mention they have the most buttery biscuits with gravy?! Need I say more? Grab a cup of joe from the front and wait to be impressed. The Screen Door is by far one of the best brunch experiences ever!"},{"name":"Seattle's Best Coffee","address":"500 N Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I love Seattle's Best Coffee but not for the drinks, per se. I like it because it is a productive place as another yelper stated. This is the only place where I can actually get work done. I have taken two other graduate students with me, and they concurred wholeheartedly after pushing out pages and pages for their thesis or dissertation. I will never know why this place has such an environment so conducive to getting much homework done, but it does. \\n\\nAlso, almost all of the workers (I say \\"almost\\", because they have hired some new workers recently) know my name and my preferred drink (Caramel Mocha hot or cold) and my favorite dessert (a heated up Cinnamon Roll w/o Icing). They chat with me often, and if something every goes wrong, they give you a coupon for a free drink. They provide samples of drinks or day-old desserts often as well. Lastly, as someone else stated, they do allow you to bring in foodstuff from other restaurants as long as you order something from them.\\n\\nWhile I have had better coffee drinks and am limited to the Caramel Mocha, Seattle's Best Coffee is my number one coffee shop so far. My mother and I jokingly call it \\"Seattle's Worst Coffee\\", because of the other coffee drinks, but it is my favorite place to be and study."},{"name":"Ramen Tatsu-Ya","address":"8557 Research Blvd, Ste 126","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"First time every trying gourmet ramen and I was not disappointed!!
