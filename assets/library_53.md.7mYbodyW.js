We ordered our food and I got the Brussels and chicken Asian chopped salad with a cup of tomato soup, my friend had the Asian nachos with a Cesar salad and her son had fried chicken fingers and mash potatoes. \\n\\nLet's start with my \\"ginormous\\" salad! It was not ginormous like the server said. It was old wilted handful of chopped lettuce that looked like I could have gotten at Costco with what suppose to be grilled chicken. It was drenched in dressing because I was to afraid to ask for it on the side since the server hesitated when my friend asked for hers on the side like it was to much work for her to do that. Then my friends nachos...never mind this is to much breath for such a disgusting place. It was nasty the restaurant looked like the inside of a nightclub bathroom that hadn't been cleaned since 1995 and maybe before then. I don't know but I just hope I don't get sick. Midway thru I blurted the words we should have went to Applebee's it would have been better...now that's saying something since I would never chose AB on any given day. \\n\\nOh and I think the manager ran by...yelling how is the food but I wouldn't know because he didn't stop he just yelled it out. I did say it was disgusting but he was running so I guess he didn't hear me. \\n\\nLet's get to the end of the disaster where we had to wait 20 minutes until our server could come out of from wherever she was to give us our check. She never checked in on us or refilled our drinks, but then again I didn't touch my water since it tasted like dirty dish water and I am pretty sure a bug was enjoying it more then me. So I followed her to get my card ran because I just could not wait any longer. Got my card back and the receipt in which the server stood right there while I wrote out the tip and signed. I very rarely give a poor tip but if she wasn't standing there she would have gotten no percent. And before all you yelpers go crazy...I tipped her over 20% which was way more then she deserved. I was a sever for twelve years and my husband is a area Director still for restaurants. I know he never ran past a table screaming how was your food but I digress!

My main course was the Salmon which came with asparagus.  They give you a lot of asparagus which was a nice surprise - again perfectly done and presented.  I planned to end with the French press coffee and I ordered that while hubby perused the dessert menu.

There was so much noise that I actually sent a text message to my wife across from me because I couldn't hear her.  We placed our orders and when our appetizers arrived, we had to ask for the bread that we saw served to other tables. Water never arrived either. The only time the waitress asked how we were doing was when she brought something to the table. People sitting in the bar kept bumping into my wife's chair and gave us looks like it was our fault.

The food is small plates, so as to not allow too much heaviness when you are getting smashed on their cocktail list.\\n\\nThe menu starts out with little munchies, moves on to more seafood based items, and rounds out with a touch of red meat and the OTHER white meat. The wine menu is not too well-crafted, and the palate of the list is definitely a little on the light, simplistic side--a little too much for the pricing.\\n\\nSome starters: bland olives, pickled vegetables, fancy kimchis (my favorite being the asparagus). Nothing fancy, but certainly a \\"healthy\\" way to start the meal--probiotics are all the rage, no?\\n\\nThe food in itself was nice, in terms of texture, but the seasoning was a little off on everything. We will touch on a couple positives, followed by a couple negatives. The squid fries (long calamari) boasted a nice crunch and tender interior. The duck wings, though possessed an unattractive sweetness, certainly had a good meaty mouthfeel. The edamame had a touch too much salt. The kale Caesar boasted a smidgen too much fish flavor.\\n\\nSome of the more Asian items, specifically the trout in broth and mussels in coconutesque broth boasted a nice Eastern flare, but all in all, just a little lacking in overall quality. Something was missing, I felt.\\n\\nI think the food here is a little overrated, but there is no doubt in my mind that everything can be improved on, even the wine. Check this new spot out; there are enough menu items so as to afford you the opportunity to perhaps have something a little tastier than my selections.

I personally don't taste a difference at each shop- the ice cream and waffle cones all consistently fresh and rich! Every month I make the trek to another scoop shop because I love trying the new flavors- even the weird ones like Arbequina Olive Oil- because even if the idea of them is weird, the ice cream itself will blow you away with how well these flavors work so well.\\n\\nAt every location, the workers are super nice and don't judge you for asking to try each flavor. The Portland location takes it a step further and brings you free samples as you're waiting in line. Don't even fret about the line as it moves so fast. The classic move for me: try every seasonal flavor, if I like something then I get it, and if not I get the Sea Salt with Caramel Ribbons single scoop in a waffle cone.\\n\\nMy only gripe is that some of these flavors are good, but definitely would not want to commit to getting a whole scoop of it as it would be too overwhelming.

Naw, that's just me drooling over this chicken from afar. I've been stalking Hat Yai for months now, because, frankly, I never go to this part of town. It's just not on my normal path. And that may quickly change now that I've gone out of my way to try the food here. \\n\\nIn my world, this is manna from heaven. It hits the sweet spot for my tastes. The perfect combination? Fried dark meat chicken, sticky rice, buttery roti and a bowl of orgasm-inducing massuman curry. Sweet, earthy, savory, buttery, sticky, messy goodness. Let's break it down...\\n\\nThe chicken is battered, fried, and glazed in a greasy, sweet, slightly-spicy-stickiness. It's not like Ike's (Andy's) wings over at Pok Pok. Totally different flavor profile and style altogether. The chicken is so tender, and I'm so glad they don't bother with any bullshit white meat, especially on the combo. The chicken comes with a sweet chili dipping sauce that's eons beyond May Ploy. The perfect accompaniment. \\n\\nWith the #5 Combo (the must-get), the chicken is paired with the house roti. If you've never had it, roti comes from the malaysian/burmese triangle and is sort of like naan or paratha but a little different. It's often paired with an earthy curry - and here that's massuman. Their version is nice and thick, with a smattering of fried shallots on top. You also get some sticky rice to dip as well, and a few pickled peppers and melon. I've had curry all over SE Asia and this is easily a top-10 experience. It satisfies. \\n\\nThis chicken ain't cheap. But it's super high quality, and the flavors are all there. The combo is $17 and I would pay that again in a heartbeat. In fact, it's good that Hat Yai is far from me, because I would put on significant weight from this food in no time, were it closer to home. \\n\\nI can't recommend this food enough.

This is quite possibly the best BBQ I've had so far in Orlando. The ribs were truly fall off the bone and tasted good enough to eat without sauce. The Big Floyd went beyond BBQ (perfectly charred brisket with a juicy center, delicate pulled pork, and smoky sausage btw) by also offering citrus peanut slaw and french fries on their toasted Hawaiian roll. Their black beans and rice packed some heat and their plantains were perfectly sweet. The corn was cooked and seasoned well, but I wasn't a fan of the  cheese on top. \\nA quick excerpt from discussion with my wife:\\nRachel: You haven't made ribs in a while.\\nBrittany: I know.

My fianc√© and I both went for the Omakase, and while $40 is generally reasonable for Omakase with about 5-6 courses, the portion is small, relative to the price or even to other high end restaurants. We tried everything on and off the menu today; the beef tartar was small and the beef texture was buried by radishes and pickled veggies. The catfish and bean dish was nice, but the catfish wasn't the star of dish; only 5 bite sized pieces and got blended in with beans and other vegetables. I love the butter squash dish - very interesting and creative. Some mix of indian spices throughout the courses. The tofu dish was good but the tofu was wayyy too small. The chicken dish was alright, but again I expected a bit more on the execution of the chicken; most come from the sauce. I love the fact they use local and seasonal ingredients, the star of any dish should have been highlighted more, either through portion or execution given that these ingredients aren't necessarily expensive. I feel like most of my dishes were swamped in sauces sometimes. I would say overall there are a lot of spices, salt, and vinegar coming through the flavor, which will taste good after a few drinks. Without drinks, some of these dishes are quite salty. We got both of the desserts on the menu and they were great!

Boyfriend was happy with beer flight. \\n\\nWas not sure we'd go back but inevitably ... We did! Sunday we went for brunch and I can say my mind was changed.

Cocktails were delicious. Bloody Mary's were a hit at the table. Bf ordered the tray which looked great upon first glance. Unfortunately, he was still not blown away. Having sampled his as well, I can understand why. Being raised in NC, when I think ribs I think fall off the bone, juicy and seasoned to perfection. While the flavor was good, they just weren't cooked enough. You shouldn't have to fight to get the meat off the bones. The tray comes with beans as well. The beans were al dente. Both of us being chefs for over 10 years... There is no excuse for this. Beans are meant to be cooked.  \\n\\nFor being a \\"southern public house\\"... And being from the south..  I hate to say the prices are a bit ridiculous. Being serious culinarians (not foodies) it's sad that the rav and c&l charge as much as they do. It would be nice to see gastro pubs and \\"public\\" houses in the true sense. Amazing food, great drinks ... For average and affordable fair. If you've ever been abroad (esp in UK or Ireland) you know the meaning of true pub food. It seems now gastro pubs and like mean charge a lot for little and make it super fancy.

I was taking myself on a leisurely stroll through downtown Austin and noticed that Swift's Attic was only a few blocks from my hotel. I had remember hearing about it on Yelp and that it had good reviews. My colleague and I were planning to have dinner that night so I decided this would be a good choice. I always love tapas, trying new/high rated restaurants on Yelp, and, of course Austin style twist on everything. It is a little bit difficult to see because there are two restaurants side-by-side and Swift's Attic is up two flights of stairs. Upon arrival, You are sort of mesmerized by the Decour. I wish my attic looked like that! There is a really cool bird cage like chandelier hanging from the ceiling, there are smaller tables and there are more private larger tables off to the side. We were greeted by our server right away, but throughout the night different people were helping and serving us. There were four sections of the menu and we decided to order one from each section. We ordered the scallops, the brussels sprouts, the pork belly, and the burrata. We also got craft cocktails while we were at it. My colleague got a gin inspired craft cocktail with lavender and a few other nice surprises. I got the coolest drink I think I've ever had. I got champagne and vodka with a strawberry ice cube. When the ice cube melted, the strawberry flavor disintegrated into the champagne and vodka. The server said it was a take on the French 77. It was about $13 and I believe you can get refills for nine dollars where they just pour the champagne vodka mix over the ice cube while it disintegrates. I only had one and then my colleague and I both switched to New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc. All of our dishes were great. I would say her least favorite was the pork belly because it was on the dry side. They burrata was good, the brussel sprouts were excellent, the scallops were good, too. We shared a peanut butter & chocolate dessert too. That was good but it got a little bit too sweet because of the chocolate flakes on top. I've been trying to stay away from scallops lately because every time I order them at a restaurant they are oversalted and that wasn't the case here. Overall, this is an excellent place with a cool vibe almost like if a restaurant met a speak easy. I highly recommend getting the fabulous cocktail that I got! Prices are a little on the high side, but it's sort of the environment that you expect them to be higher. The service was quick, and they paced out our dishes well.

Hop's Chicken is a tiny corner establishment inside Ponce City Markets on the west side of the building. If you haven't been to Ponce city Markets, it is an upscale food court with communal seating and randoms tables dispersed throughout the building. \\n\\nExperience:\\nThere was a fairly long cue for the biscuits, and thankfully I arrived right in time to grab one. The chicken biscuits are a nice size for the price. The chicken was freshly out of the fryer, and not greasy in the least bit. They are not the traditional fluffy flour biscuits I am use to from Pillsbury or Chick-fila, but made with cornmeal. This made the biscuit denser and a bit more filling.  However, I do wish the cornmeal had some sort of seasoning. Cornmeal is a common ingredient in Latin american cuisines, and a little bit of salt, pepper, or cheese would of livened up the biscuit. In regards to the chicken itself, I thought it was okay. I loved the crispy texture, but they did not season the meat. Overall, the biscuit was flat. I believe they rely on their customers to add sauces to the biscuit for flavor, which I personally am not a huge fan of."},{"name":"Pizza Days","address":"111 Brighton Ave","city":"Allston","stars":"2","text":"This restaurant caters exclusively to drunk people.

I wanted all of the cocktails--they have a full page of old fashioneds!

I ordered the Cavalcade and didn't realize until the end that the garnish was dried strawberries (they looked like flowers!) This drink was also really good, the pepper giving it a noticeable but not overwhelming spice, and I had to slow myself down from chugging it. Both are great options. \\n\\nFood: my friend and I shared a \\"picnic basket\\" (choice of 3 out of 4- soup, sandwich, share, salad), choosing tomato basil soup, grilled cheese, strata.

There's a few cheaper options for the happy hour specials. I had the French fries. It's about $5 to get these at happy hour. The fries were certainly better than what you can get at any kind of fast food place. It looked like they were freshly cut. These fries were also thick. Beyond that there wasn't much that appealed to me on the menu.

After hearing the reviews of the place and checking Yelp to confirm (you can never tell how good the food is by watching it on a TV show) we headed out to East Boston to try and get in for dinner. It was early, around 4pm on a Saturday, so we figured we might be able to beat the rush. Nope, we were told there was a 2 hour wait (!) so we opted to come back another time rather than wait in the cold for our table.A few months go by and I remind my husband about this place he wanted to try. It was a weekday night and again I figured beat the rush by getting in early, just before 5pm. We were seated immediately but the next couple to come in the door after us got told it would be a 45 minute wait, so we just beat the line! \\n\\nHowever, a couple of things. There was no hostess at the front to greet us, and as we stood milling about in the small entry way, none of the servers walking past us said anything either. Finally a chick comes up to us after a minute or so and pointed to a table we could sit at. After we were seated it took the guy a while to come over and greet us and get our drinks. Now, this is a small place, and they have a couple of servers working there. There's no way it should take five minutes to get a drink order or 15 minutes to have the table cleared after dinner while you're waiting for the waiter to reappear to give you your check. I'll give him credit though, he warmed up to us more as the meal went on and was a pretty funny guy, just a little slow with the service which was disappointing (you're full, you're tired, you just want to go hoooome).\\n\\nThat being said, the food is PHENOMENAL. The pastas are fresh, perfectly al dente, and delicious. We ordered the calimari which came out exactly as it is supposed to be cooked, not rubbery in the least. My husband got some special chicken-shrimp-veal dish with a brandy cream sauce that was ok (personally I didn't like it that much but he loved it) and a side of penne bolognese (again, phenomenal). I went old school and got the chicken parm with linguine and I'm not exaggerating when I tell you that the chicken took up an entire dinner plate and we had four full plates between us for our meals. Needless to say we had leftovers for lunch the day after... delicious, amazing leftovers. The portions are huge for pretty much every entree we saw come out of the kitchen and the flavors are spot on. The food will not be a disappointment, I can assure you of that!! The total check including our dinners, appetizer and tip came to about $75, which isn't bad at all considering how much food we actually got.\\n\\nOverall, I'll go back without a doubt, but hopefully the owners read these reviews and make adjustments in their service. I think a lot of people would be more inclined to return if the service was up to par."},{"name":"Flower Child","address":"11721 Rock Rose Ave, Ste 120","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Love this place!

If you haven't tried this place and live in Portland, you probably have been hiding under a rock.  During our food adventure in the city, we squeezed S&S into our diet schedule, AKA had ice cream after breakfast. Service was incredible. The servers were not only patient and knowledgeable about local favorites, but also offered recommendations based on basic flavors we enjoy. They offered me samples of the Honey Strawberry with lightly hint of Balsamic Vinegar, Pear and Blue Cheese, and Honey Lavender. If there was a love at first taste, this was it. I was sold by the Pear and Blue Cheese and had a scoop of it in a waffle cone (which was a rather big portion for 4.95).  This local favorite had tiny chunks of blue cheese mixed into the ice cream, which provides a nice contrast of salt to the subtle undertones of pear. The  ice cream itself was not too sweet and balanced between fruity flavor and the basic vanilla cream. Kevin tried Almond Brittle and Snickerdoodle both which he end up getting. He had two half scoops in a waffle cone. Given Kevin doesn't have a sweet tooth (or teeth) like I do, I ate half his share. Yes, I ate one and half scoops of ice cream. No, don't judge until you tried the ice cream here. His snickernoodle had a light cinnamon flavor and some chunks of cookie dough, which provided great balance of texture. The almond brittle has a hint of caramel among a nice nuttiness to vanilla-ish ice cream. When it comes down to it, I am still more biased to my Blue Cheese and Pear decision although the others were solid contenders. \\n\\nThere's limited seating indoors, but more benches outside for a spring/summer days. No wait for us this time, but if you come on a weekend, we heard lines could run outside the door and around the corner!

Hake Fish was under flavored, though the fish was fresh tasting.  The sides that came with it was flavorful, spinach and crab meat.  And my favorite dish of the night, dessert!!

What I learned was that it's to Pei Wei's benefit that the sushi doesn't get mentioned very much.\\n\\nI ordered two rolls, the spicy tuna and the wasabi crunch. Perhaps the fact that they don't offer any rolls more basic than spicy tuna -- and the other four options are smothered in sauces -- is the first warning sign. It suggests sushi insecurity. In-soosh-curity. Either the fish can't stand on its own or something else about the roll needs to be hidden under additional flavors (I'm getting ahead of myself, but it turned out to be the second option of these two).\\n\\nThey arrived on separate plates, as if they were expecting two diners. I guess people don't usually order this for their whole meal. Another not-a-good-sign sign.\\n\\nDug in, and the rice was wretched. It was not noticeably seasoned, it was a trial to chew, and there was just so crazy-darn much of it. The wasabi aioli and the tempura flakes on the wasabi crunch roll did nothing to hide the problem or balance it out. About midway through the meal, I decided to just remove the contents of my rolls and eat the tuna and veggies naked because I couldn't taste them through that awful rice. Liberated from their glutinous prisons, the fish and cucumbers and sauces were fine. Nothing standout, nothing that will make me come here again and get do-it-yourself sashimi, but fine. And that's a lot more than can be said for how it tasted with the rice.\\n\\nThe rice was not quite so bad when I wasn't expecting it to be sushi rice, either (that is, when I went back to the rice after taking everything else out of the sushi). But at that point I was dousing it with soy sauce, and everything* tastes better with soy sauce.\\n\\nThe restaurant's atmosphere was nice, and I'd be open to trying other things there, but sushi was a big miss.

The meal also came with a biscuit. \\n\\nAs is to be expected, with such a following that 4 Rivers has, the pulled pork was excellent, as it should be for a BBQ restaurant. However, the one thing that disappointed me and ultimately made this a 4, not 5 star review, was the sides. The french fries are maybe marginally better than Ore Ida fries you'd get in a bag at the grocery store, but they're clearly not fresh. The macaroni and cheese is watery and bland, lacking any real flavor, texture, or consistency as it swims in a cheese sauce. Lastly, the potato salad might as well be called a dill salad, because I tasted enough dill for about twice the amount of potato salad than I had.\\n\\nSadly enough, my second visit to the University Blvd. location confirmed two things: The side dish issue appears to be systemic and chicken quesadillas should not be ordered at a non-mexican restaurant. Again, I tried the french fries which tasted the same, albeit were slightly more crispy than the Winter Park location. The Mac and Cheese however, was still a runny, tasteless, disappointing mess. The quesadilla contained great tasting BBQ chicken, but the \\"quesa\\" part of the \\"dilla\\"  that typically helps hold it together, seemed to be missing, and it proceeded to fall apart. This caused me to have to eat the chicken with a fork, separate from the tortilla, which sort of defeated the purpose of the dish altogether.\\n\\nOne thing saving this review from being worse is the hospitality. In the Winter Park location I never had to get up to refill my drink, as the lady circling the room would always notice when I needed more. In the University location, a staff member offered to get my mom some water so she didn't have to get up and get it herself. I was also swiftly assisted by two employees who, when I dropped one of my cups on the way to the fountain, promptly grabbed another cup for me. \\n\\nOverall, 4 Rivers falls victim to one main problem, and that is paying so much attention to one area that everything else seems to be an afterthought. Just because you serve great barbecue doesn't mean you can serve mediocre side dishes. Five Guys serves really great burgers, but they also make really good and \\"fresh\\" fries. One day soon, hopefully, the quality of the hospitality and tasty barbecue will soon be matched by the side dishes, because that is what would really make this place top notch."},{"name":"Shoal Creek Saloon","address":"909 N Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Considering all the years I've lived in Austin, I had never been to the Shoal Creek Saloon!

If you're looking for tasty Indian cuisine in South Austin, this is a fantastic choice.  The portions were standard and the prices basically were, also.\\n\\nI attended Pakwan's \\"soft opening\\" the other night, for which they are offering a stream-lined selection of menu items and a brief but fabulous drink list.  The Dark and Stormy was an interesting and somewhat tart but delicious cocktail, made with ginger beer and liquor.  The tamarind margarita was also interesting, although not my personal favorite.\\n\\nThe veggie samosas were spicy and fried to a perfectly crisp golden brown and served with the traditional fresh mint and tamarind dipping sauces as well as a delicious fruity chutney.  We also had the vegetable pakore, which were also fried to a perfect golden brown.  Both of these appetizers are a must!\\n\\nI ordered the Saag Paneer, which was rich and full-flavored and pretty damn spicy.  It tasted like they had used fresh spinach, too.  My boyfriend had the Murg (chicken) Tikka Masala, which was spicy and yet somewhat sweet with chunks of perfectly tender chicken.  Both dishes were fantastic.  The chana masala was also very good.  The plain naan bread was delicious and soft, and they made us a special order of onion naan (that wasn't on their soft opening menu, but they were very accommodating) which was awesome!\\n\\nOur waitress was extremely sweet and very attentive, and one of the owners introduced herself to us and asked to make sure we had enjoyed our experience.  I can't wait to come back to Pakwan to check out the full menu!"},{"name":"Max's Deli Cafe","address":"151 Milk St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"The four stars are mainly for their sweet potato fries, which were maybe $3.50 for a large boxful - those open topped boxes that fried clams are sometimes served in.  They were light and crisp with natural sweet potato sweetness, and fried to order!  In fact, that turned out to be the order item that made us wait, hungrily, within hearing distance of the cashier.\\n\\nTheir Thursday special - Max & Cheese (nope, not a typo) - was served with your choice of green salad or Caesar.  The romaine arrived nicely coated and crisp, but the shells were hardly warmer than room temperature and a bit above al dente.  It wasn't the creamy sort of mac & cheese (ie. Panera), but it was tasty, and the portion was generous for one diner.  Too bad though that it wasn't kept hot, or heated up for us.\\n\\nThe side of garlic mashed ($1.95?) was creamy with garlic and natural potato flavor, but not much else.  That was an okay rendition.\\n\\nWhen we asked for honey mustard, we received a generous little tub of honey dijon.  Ketchup was available on the table in a squeeze bottle along with \\"Chinese Ketchup\\", napkins, and salt.\\n\\nWe were there for lunch after 1pm, and the place was nonstop take-out the whole time we dined.  Their bags of sandwich breads sitting on top of the counter looked enticing - especially what looked to be asiago ciabatta and the heavily flecked onion rolls...\\n\\nWhile I waited, I noticed that Max's advertised that they are there for your last minute catering needs.  Just FYI.\\n\\n4/2011 - $3.95 for the sweet potato fries.  Yum!\\n\\n7/2011 - still $3.95 for the crisp sweet potato fries, but this time the open box was fillled to overflowing.  Nice!\\n\\n(4 stars)\\n\\n8/2012 - the sweet potato fries (still $3.95) were rather limp yet meaty today.  I prefer the crispy sort, unfortunately.\\n\\nBut the Thursday special is now a shrimp scampi pasta which turned out to be al dente linguini with perhaps 10 good sized solid shrimp all covered with buttery olive oil and garlic.  It came with a bowl of caesar salad, well dressed, and a nice slice of bread which I will save for later.  They seem rather proud of the special - one of their staff ladies, a brunette, came by twice to ask how we liked it.\\n\\nThere was a chill to the air conditioned air on this rather cool summer day.  Wish I had thought to bring a jacket.\\n\\n8/2012 still - the Max & Cheese special was too peppery and not what I normally think of when I think of mac & cheese.  The pasta shells were fine, but the breadcrumb thickened mush wasn't particularly cheesey a concoction.  The caesar salad was fine and crisp of leaf.  The garlic mashed was decent - I liked it better than the main entree this time.\\n\\n(downgraded to 3 stars)\\n\\n9/2012 - the office catered from here.  White sheet cake was light and fluffy.  Someone else vouched for their egg salad sandwich with bacon.  I liked the large chunks of veggies in the healthy sandwich option.  They provided a large variety of snack portion bags of chips, which was pretty impressive."},{"name":"Tasty n Sons","address":"3808 N Williams Ave, Ste C, Hub Building","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"OMG, if I lived in Portland, I would eat here every week. \\n\\nMy girl and I showed up for brunch on Saturday morning.

It is the traditional breakfast of eggs, toast, hash browns, and bacon. But today we were hungry and allowed our stomachs to order. We started with the breakfast special but added and subtracted as we pleased to get this plate. We choose over easy eggs, bacon, added two sausages, exchanged the toast for an English muffin, and said no to the hash browns. It did not come up to much more over $7. This is a pretty standard breakfast, truthfully one that you can get anywhere; and quite frankly can make yourself. Though first thing in the morning, do you really want to wake up early to cook? Or would you rather have it brought to you as you take a sip of coffee and rifle through the day's paper?\\n\\nAlso wanting something sweet we ordered the \\"candied walnut French toast\\", a \\"Park\\" special. It is 3 slices of whole wheat bread, made into French toast, topped with maple butter, sprinkled with candied walnuts, and served with a jug of maple syrup. This was amazing and it hit all the right spots. You couldn't tell that the toast was whole wheat. Each bite was light and fluffy, from middle to all four crusts. The maple butter had the luxurious texture of melted butter, with a wonderful whisper of maple. It gave the French toast a maple flavour, without any of its sweetness; so you can really taste the cooked egg over the bread. The candied walnuts were my favourite part, I could eat a whole bag of these for lunch. The nuts didn't have that old, nutty, rancid taste that some do. These were pan fried and caramelized with simple syrup and honey. We didn't finish the toast, but I made sure that the walnuts didn't go to waste. \\n\\nThere were three waitresses to share between the 5 occupied tables. Our server was attentive, she scurried to us any time my hand went up past my shoulder. We left full and ready to start our day. \\n\\nWould I come back? - Yes.\\nWould I recommend it? - Yes.

And NO airpockets inside the shell where there could have been a touch more filling.  Other options were chocolate (chips?) and rainbow sprinkles.\\n\\nWhen they told me it would be 15 minutes for my pizza to be ready, I was a bit doubtful.  But when I got there before the 15 minutes were up, my pizza was already boxed and ready to go.  Ah, the baking time was short because their crust is so thin, yet still chewy, not like a cracker.  The chicken chunks on my chicken pesto pizza $10.99 (Extra virgin olive oil, our famous pesto spread, mozzarella cheese, diced chicken & roasted red pepper) were juicy, and the pesto evident both in looks and taste.\\n\\nOne and a half slices of the pizza plus one cannoli made for a good lunch.\\n\\nPS - service was good, and I noticed a whiteboard in the window confirming what caley t. said about $5 pizzas Friday at 5pm.  (photo posted)  The hard part will be manhandling the pizza box on the subway...\\n\\nFYI - Large soda bottles were available for purchase, and several (6+) tables were available for eating in.  Too bad their plastic knives are rather wimpy.\\n\\n*** 2/2011 Friday visit ***\\n\\nDecided to try their Friday night special.  When you order it is when they start working on your pizza.  When I placed my order for just 1 large cheese, the fella on the phone asked \\"just 1?\\" - sounds like multiple discounted pizzas are not discouraged.  The regular prize for their large cheese is $8.99, so at $5-$8 per pie (5pm-8pm), it is a discount of $.99-$3.99 apiece.\\n\\n*** 4/2011 visit ***\\n\\nPicked up two subs:\\nChicken Bruschetta - $6.99\\nSliced chicken topped with chopped tomato, balsamic vinegar, olive oil, oregano, fresh basil, fresh mozzarella, pressed panini style.\\nMeatball - $5.99\\nHomemade meatballs in our marinara sauce with provolone & parmigiana.\\n\\nThey were out of rolls, so I was informed, so they made them with focaccia bread and gave them a grill and a press.  Adding veggies (tomatoes, roasted red peppers) to a sandwich were at  no additional cost.  Both were tasty, but I may have preferred the meatball over the chicken, even with the gooey cheese oozing out from the white meat sandwich.\\n\\nService was good, as the gentleman packing my sandwich was willing to slice up my order into four pieces instead of the normal halves, per my request.\\n\\nCannolis are still $1.75 for a good sized shell.  And fruit is available at 50 cents apiece for those hoping to make their meal a tad healthier.\\n\\n*** 10/2011 visit ***\\n\\nFunny, the way everyone's been yelping about the size of their pizza by the slice, I was expecting something humungus... I mean, they are big, but they're the same portion of a pizza as Ernesto's - a quarter of a pie, sliced in two.\\n\\nThey offer slices daily - cheese, pepperoni, and one other pie.  On Mondays through Wednesday the third pie varies, but on Thursdays it is pear and parmesan, and Fridays it is shrimp scampi.\\n\\nI had the shrimp scampi slice for $3.  Tender crust, decently sized shrimp, I had 4 of them per half slice.  Good.\\n\\nAlso good was the eggplant parm on baked ziti for $7.99.  Talk about a huge portion!  Plenty for two girls to lunch on, I imagine.  The small garden salad for $2 was freshly made for me, and the slice of Rustic Italian Bread that came with the pasta was a thick slice of soft bread.\\n\\nThe lunch rush seemed to start after 12:30pm, so I didn't have any trouble getting a table.\\n\\nLooks like they have tiramisu for $3 a slice.  A whole small pan might cost $23, and would need maybe 2 days notice.\\n\\nPS - plasticware is now located behind the counter - but the knives are no longer wimpy!\\n\\n*** 1/2012 visit ***\\n\\nThe pesto tortelloni slice of the day was tasty.  The tiramisu a good portion and moist, but not the best I've had.\\n\\nService was good though.\\n\\nIf your order takes a while (like the baked pastas), keep your ears perked up, as they call out the dish (not your name) as they are ready for pick-up.\\n\\n*** 2/2012 visit ***\\n\\nLooks like cannolis are now $2.\\n\\n.Soup of the Day - $3.50 was cream of broccoli, which was hot and creamy, a basic and good version of the classic.\\n.Garlic Roast Beef Panini Special of the Day - $6.49\\nGarlic herbed mayo, roast beef, roasted red peppers, provolone, on Parm focaccia.\\nSizable portion, crisp bread, but not especially flavorful despite the \\"garlic\\" in the name.

The reason for such a poor review is because while the food was flavorful, it was way too greasy for my liking. I was not happy with the fact that the chicken had been previously fried. You could see a couple baskets of pre-fried chicken sitting above the fryer, waiting to be re fried when a new order came in. That makes the chicken incredibly greasy. I was also frustrated to see that much chicken just sitting there being that they had just opened and weren't busy yet. The Roti was good fresh off the grill but was very oily. And lastly the curry was cold and I found it to be a bit too gelatinous/elastic. We got the #1 and #5 under the curry and roti sets. When I'm spending over $32 for two dishes I would expect the chicken made to order instead of previously being fried.  I would also expect the portions to be larger. Nonetheless, the service was good. The counter server was knowledgeable with the menu items. The food seems to be quality as well.

The menu promises inventive, delightful cuisine in a quiet, sophisticated setting.  The setting is, indeed sophisticated, but the evening we were there a large group of loud revelers spoiled the quiet.  Of course, the restaurant can't be blamed for this, and we were determined to enjoy my companion's birthday in spite of it.\\n\\nThe appetizers we ordered were bass crudo, and mooncusser chowder with clams, smoked scallops and skate.  We don't like condiments on raw fish, but something needed to be done to the bass.  Maybe something as simple as salt.  As it was, it was bland.  The chowder came with four clams in their shells.  The texture of the broth was very good, not heavy, but light and tasty.  However, I could neither taste nor see smoked scallops or skate.  If they were there, they must have been finely minced.  It was a nice dish, but not memorable.\\n\\nOur entrees were seared scallops, and hake on a squid pancake.  The scallops were prepared well, and there were plenty of them.  They came with chanterelles and a roasted tomato, a satisfying combination.  The hake was also well prepared, with nice, crispy skin, the delicious squid pancake was a pleasant surprise.  Again, the kitchen needed something to enhance the flavors.  Everything was good, but nothing was memorable.  I think I could duplicate everything we ate in my own kitchen.\\n\\nA mooncusser is a kind of pirate who stays ashore, shuts down lighthouses, and builds fake lighthouses, causing ships to run aground where they can be raided and sacked.  I thought of this when I looked at the wine list.  The wines here are very expensive.  I didn't recognize the labels, so I did some research before going to the restaurant.  Typically, a restaurant will price their wine at twice the retail cost.  Here, a nice French white for $48 sells at retail for $12.\\n\\nOn a happier note, our excellent waiter overheard me wishing my companion a happy birthday.  When we were done with the meal, he brought out a little plate with a birthday candle and two little cakes.  I like that kind of attention, and it goes a long way for me.

The server was inappropriate on so many levels. \\n\\n- Very interruptive, constantly to the point of obnoxious and ruined the flow of conversation and the evening. We are a very relaxed informal group but his demeanor was way too familiar out of the starting gate. This is not Friday's. \\n\\n- Announced that he was there alone doing everything (don't need to know that, that is the business of the establishment. The customer is there to relax)\\n\\n- When my colleague ordered Brussel Spouts and potatoes she asked if they could be prepared w/out butter. His response was the cooks did not speak good English perhaps they might or might understand no butter - or something to that effect.  Really? \\n\\n- We left a few pieces of the 4 apps we ordered on the plate. After interrupting my colleague's story he preceded to insist someone finish them. Again, this isn't Friday's. \\n\\nI might add many moons ago I was a waitress as well as a dining room manager. As a server one needs to read their customer. Some customers want zero interaction, some customers want some interaction, and some customer prefer a lot of interaction. You work accordingly. That night was our one night out a year to have some wine, dinner and share some laughs, not to hang out w/the server.\\n\\nLastly, the filet mignon was a surprising disappointment. $42 of chewy and overcooked. An actual over the top struggle to chew. No filet mignon should be anything other than tender and melt in your mouth. On a positive note the beet salad and short rib sliders were excellent.\\n\\nI did head over there Thursday night for a quick drink with a friend. More feedback ... we have three different servers at 3 different times try to deliver us food we never ordered. This seems to happen almost every time I am there. Your food running system is clearly flawed, and just more interruptions if you are trying to have a conversation. \\n\\nJust providing feedback as I want your restaurant to be successful.

I asked for my porterhouse to be cooked medium and it came out well done and had to be sent back. I was told they were out of mashed potatoes (how hard is it to make some?), Then the second steak was about 40% unedible because of all the fat and gristle and was still on the plate when they took it. I spit a good majority of it out after trying to chew it and not being able to. There were 3 or 4 gnats flying around landing on my food the whole time. The manager, I believe his name was Gary (heavy set black guy with a beard) came over to look at a 20% off coupon I had. I told him I hadnt been in for 3 months because of all the problems and nothing has changed. I told him about my experience tonight and he said that the gnats are a summer problem and they put plastic bags over the buckets (it's not even summer and obviously the gnats are a huge problem if I had 3 or 4 just at my table). He said the mashed potatoes being out is just something that happens (mashed potatoes are advertised as being made in house. Why not make more?). He said the only thing that was really their fault was the steak not being cooked right, but he made sure to give himself a pat on the back for cooking the second one right. I told him for the same price I can go down the road to Longhorn and get a porterhouse that's cooked right and far less fatty and less gristle. He said the next time I came in he'd personally select a steak. I told him I wouldn't be back, so that does nothing for me. He said he'd take off the 20% coupon I had. Whooptydo! It was going to be taken off anyways! I've never met a manager who seemed like they couldnt care less about a customer's experience, and obviously he didnt care that his guest is unhappy! Even after I told him I would contact corperate (which I already have) he didn't give a shit.

To be fair, originally we planned on going to Atlas Tavern, but unbeknownst to me they're closed on Mondays (maybe they're like Garfield and don't do Mondays....), so we opted to try Condado because they were literally right around the corner.\\n\\nOnce again, eating at a toddler's dinner time of 4:30 pm has its perks, like no waiting to be seated, so that was a bonus. I brought Nugget with me to  the last supper I'd be having with a friend. \\n\\nWe were seated pretty quickly. It was pretty quiet in there (I'm assuming due to the time or maybe because it was a Monday). The interior of Condado is pretty fun looking: bright colored aliens and robots adorn the walls. It really keeps a kid's attention.\\n\\nI started with a Modelo Especial, Nugget ordered a \\"fancy water\\" AKA club soda, my friend got a beer (I can't remember which one), and we shared an order of queso.\\n\\nBeers came out  quickly. Our beers were cold and refreshing, which was great because it's been super hot here in the Midwest. \\n\\nOur queso came out right after the beer. Houston, we have a problem. There was spice (paprika) and one lone jalapeno on the queso. I asked my friend to distract Nugget, so I could swiftly take it off. Hell hath no furry like a toddler that sees \\"spice\\" on queso. Phew, he didn't see anything, and dug into the queso. He really enjoyed the queso, so much so, that he had a queso beard by the time we finished.\\n\\nI LOVED the queso. It was hot, smooth, silky, velvety goodness. If I could have taken a bath in it, I would have. Had I been in a room by myself, I would have drank the remaining drops of queso (don't judge, I'm pretty sure you'd do the same). The chips were delicious (crunchy/fried vessels for our beloved queso).\\n\\nOnto food. Condado's ordering is a bit unconventional. While they have some recommendations, you really can choose how you want your tacos/burritos/bowls made. You choose everything from the type of shell, protein, salsa, cheese, etc. I opted for a bowl this time (rice base, pulled pork, lettuce, tomatoes, queso fresco, pineapple salsa). They don't  have a kid's menu, but you can get a kid's quesadilla, which is what I ordered Nugget.\\n\\nEverything came out quickly. I dug into my bowl. Wah Wah (cue game show music). The pork was bland. It really lacked any type of flavor. I couldn't even taste S and P (salt and pepper) on it. The rice tasted like your basic white rice. The pineapple salsa was good, but they could have been more generous with it, due to the low ratio of salsa to meat. All in all, the bowl was a disappointment.\\n\\nI'm sure the quesadilla (or as Nugget refers to it as a quesadida) tasted fine, but he didn't touch it. He opted to eat a side of sour cream (sounds delightful, right?!?).\\n\\nPros:\\n-Interior is super cool and fun\\n-Queso is off the chain\\n-Chips were crunchy pieces of heaven \\n-Variety of items on the menu\\n\\nCons:\\n-Lack of overall flavor in the bowl\\n-Pulled pork was bland\\n\\nTips: Get a queso to go, so you can drink it in the privacy of your own home."},{"name":"Little New Orleans Kitchen & Oyster Bar","address":"5840 W Irlo Bronson Memorial Hwy","city":"Kissimmee","stars":"3.5","text":"Hoping it is only temporary, but as of Sunday evening 7/31 there is a sign on the door that says \\"Sorry for the inconvenience, but this restaurant is closed until further notice.\\" Will upload a photo."},{"name":"Pasta Da Pulcinella","address":"1123 Peachtree Walk NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Wow!

Then we had to asked for two sprites instead and then had to asked for the bubble tea three more times until we finally got it after the ramen came. He constantly would run past our table and we only got anything if we caught his attention by repeating \\"excuse me\\" while he literally ran by us. He had one other table he was attending to and they got all his attention and he would look at us all the time but never asked if we needed anything or how our meals were. It was an absolute joke. It took so long for him to finally bring us the check, and he charged us for the two ginger ales he accidentally brought us!? Tried to get his attention to fix this, and he was sitting down at a table eating the food of the customers that just left. What the hell? Took another 10 minutes until he finished that and I was so fed up I just wanted to leave. But we needed the check split up and he had no idea what we meant even tho I wrote down how to split it. He took the check and all the cards and disappeared for 20 minutes until he finally came back, and we got the hell out of there. I liked the sushi and the scallion pancakes, but I would never recommend that ramen to anybody and would beware future customers of that terrible waiter. He has to be a relative of the owner because no one would want him working for them."},{"name":"High Note Kitchen","address":"300 S Lamar, Ste A","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"The food was decent, but not worth the lack of good service and inability to hear conversation. There were maybe 4 tables full in the restaurant with a single server and (presumably) manager working the floor, yet somehow had to ask 3 times to get a water refill. The server station is around the corner from most of the tables, so they aren't able to quickly check in on their tables' needs, but really didn't seem to want to. After the second time of unsuccessfully requesting water, we had to physically get up to go get their attention - the server and manager were just talking to each other on the other end of the bar. The food was decent, but overpriced especially for the level of service. As I said there were only 4 tables, no one talking particularly loud, but something about the music or how the place is laid out or both, we could barely hear each other; don't even want to imagine what it would be like when it's half full or more.

I had been here several times and despite the long time it took to serve or the server getting our order wrong multiple times, I always gave them the benefit of the doubt. Until tonight... if I could give this place a 0, I would! A group of about 8 of us stopped there at about 9:30 after a day on the river at Reimer's Ranch. The bartender who said she was the \\"manager\\" was on some power trip and refused to serve our friend. I was even witness to her openly criticizing and talking bad about our friend to other patrons who were at the bar. In all honesty, our friend had been drinking during the day and had a bad day due to relationship issues. We have all been there but she wasn't drunk, just upset. Well, the bartender refused to serve her so we decided to chill outside and proceeded to give our friend water. Our friend was not causing any problems and playing pool but an hour and a half later, this bartender decided to come out and confront our friend saying that she had a credible source that said oue friend was drinking and she got aggressive with our friend. Our friend, being attacked, obviously responded negatively telling her she didn't know why she was singling her out and making this scene when she wasn't bothering anyone. We stepped in and informed her that we were driving her home and all taking care of her. Despite the whole group attesting for our friend, the bartender was on a high horse and stated she was only \\"doing her job\\" and that the ownership told her not to serve our friend and that she had a credible source who told her that she was drinking. That is absolutely absurd because all of us were watching her and making sure she was good. So, for the bartender to come out almost two hours later and start an altercation when we were not bothering anyone was absurd. We tried to reason with the bartender and she kept saying it was her job and would not listen to reason. Long story short, we live in the area and will never again return to this establishment! It was clear the bartender had a personal issues with our friend and used her title as \\"manager\\" to enforce it. I have never written a review such as this on Yelp and I live and die by these reviews in my own personal business but now clearly understand why they are so important. I do plan on following up by calling and speaking with the ownership. As a professional who works in Experience and Customer Service, this is the worst service I have ever received in any establishment.

I do this because I am very much rooted in my past in terms of .... it makes me who I am today. So with that in mind here it goes....\\n\\nThis story takes us back to 2007. I began working for a small Cuban restaurant called Habana's. With two locations, one on Soco and one on east 6th. The location on east 6th was a location that had a great build to it, as far as the physical building. An older design, that was probably from the 30's or 40's, it had an expansive patio and seating areas, as well as a patio overlooking the outside. It sits near the Waller creek section of downtown Austin. Great location down the end of East 6th. \\n\\nThe owners were.... well to try to be polite, we will say they were...nice.... yeah....anyway, I always thought that this location was great and just never had a chance to give its full potential to the foodie masses. \\nThe biggest thing about this restaurant was... that it had such great potential, yet not the right draw, and even though it occasionally would have a pop that would fill the place, it wasnt consistent enough or busy enough to really succeed.\\n\\nEarlier in the evening in question, we were at One-2-One Bar on South Lamar, listening to some great music and visiting with friends, Greg and Destiny, the owners and Mike Q. the bartender who had worked for me at Habana's as a server/bartender, and I think still does at the Soco location. I mentioned to him that we were going to Easy Tiger from there and we  looked at each other with that, I know - look and smirk. we both knew ;-) \\n\\n So with that in mind, I hadnt been inside the location where Easy Tiger sits since it had changed names several times, and now sits firmly with Easy Tiger as its tenant. \\n\\nThe first thing that struck me, as someone who spent many hours inside this building...was...\\nThere is an F'in Bakery in the first floor....WHAT?.... Awesome..... \\nthe sign said, Left to order to go, right down the stairs to stay awhile...so we....\\nWe followed the signs down the stairs to find a seat....YeAH right...the place was packed, we finally settled on two seats at the bar.\\nSo, again, the memories are fading in and I remember how I spent hours behind this bar, cleaning and stocking...counting bottles, fixing sewer backups... I didnt say they were gonna be all good memories.... \\nThe downstairs bar and dining room almost looks the same, I remember more high tops back then, but its still looks the same, just maybe different paint and some wood work.\\nAgain...PACKED...\\nAfter a brief intro by the bartender, We order a Game Sausage and Venison PAte plate, along with an Alaskan Amber to share. The Plate was meaty and delicious and well prepared. After settling up, I wanted to take a look out back and see what they did to it.\\nSo again...memories.... the back patio doesnt look much different. Since there is a bakery upstairs now, the patio that was overlooking the outside is sealed up. \\nThey put up a tent, which I am guessing as part of the now almost done with winter in ATX. I am sure that it isnt always there, or maybe it is... I dont know.\\nSomehow, they have managed to acquire the space near the creek and opened up some tables out there along with ping pong tables for fun... paddles at the bar.\\nalso there is a bar outside, which there always was, but hardly used when I worked there.\\n\\nBefore we left we grabbed some bread from the bakery and an Almond Croissant. again high praise. \\n\\nOverall I am happy the space finally got something that filled its Karma-tic walls. \\n\\nAfter hearing so much about Easy Tiger from all my friends, It lived up to its expectation.\\nI want to go back for a longer experience... just a matter of time...\\nThanks Easy Tiger..."},{"name":"The Magnolia","address":"4075 NE Sandy Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"The Magnolia is a Quaint little place right across from the Hollywood theater. Perfect for a drink or food before a movie if you are not in the mood for Pizza or popcorn. \\n\\nThey have uniquely inspired plates and drinks. The atmosphere is not modern but feels almost upscale, especially for this neighborhood. It's definitely not what I expected. \\n\\nThey fit a lot of tables into the small space without making it look or feel crowded. The seating is great because you can choose between a comfy couch by the window or a seat at the bar or a small table for two or the large group table. \\n\\nYou order at the bar and then they will come to your table to serve you. This is perhaps the only area that could be improved, because when it gets busy it can be hard for them to find the right table. \\n\\nParking of course, is less than ideal. If you are just stopping in for a quick drink and snack, the nearby two hour parking might do, otherwise you will have to park about a half mile away to find an unrestricted spot in a neighborhood."},{"name":"Chicken Guy!","address":"1506 E Buena Vista Dr, Ste A","city":"Lake Buena Vista","stars":"3.5","text":"A friend and I were pondering on where to grab lunch and decided to visit the Chicken Guy after all the talk and wanted to see if this place lived up to the hype.\\n\\nWe walked in on a Sunday afternoon around lunchtime through the glass double doors and were promptly stopped by an employee and told we had to wait in the line that started outside. We brushed off the slight rudeness and apologized for not noticing the queue and walked over to the back of the line to wait our turn. After a few short minutes we found ourselves walking inside with only a handful of guests before us waiting to order their lunch. The restaurant itself was clean and very vibrant and colorful. What stood out to me the most and found kind of disturbing was a life size picture of Guy Fieri holding a  live chicken. A couple of minutes went by and I was able to place my order and pay for it. We got our drinks from the self-service soda machine and looked for a table. It just started to feel like fall in Florida so we grabbed a table outside to enjoy the beautiful weather. After another five minutes going by, a staff member brought over my order and took my pager and left, never asking if we needed anything else.\\n\\nI started my lunch with \\"The CG Classic\\", a sandwich with two chicken tenders, lettuce, tomato, cheddar, and special sauce (essentially Big Mac sauce). I took a bite of my sandwich and it automatically started dripping right onto my tray. I was quite pleased with the taste, but thought it was frustrating that it was made of two chicken tenders instead of a chicken patty since it was making the sandwich a little difficult to eat and get a good hold on it.\\n\\nWith the sandwich came with a side of fries and a fountain beverage. I saw on the menu that they offered Gold Peak sweet tea and was super excited since it's one of my favorite brands but was super disappointed when I saw on the soda machine that they were serving Fuze sweet tea instead. My friend pointed out that not only is it false advertisement, but a guest can be allergic to an ingredient in Fuze and drink it thinking it was Gold Peak sweet tea, causing an allergic reaction. The side of fries I was served was heavily seasoned to the point where they were too salty to enjoy. After a few bites, I noticed a strand of blonde hair in my side of fries. I work in the restaurant industry, so I wasn't disgusted by it, just inconvenienced. I got up and handed it to the manager on duty, Moe, and he said, \\"That's not cool\\", walked away without saying anything else, and threw them in the trash. He didn't apologize or even try to offer me a new side of fries. The lack of professionalism was the part that shocked me considering this restaurant is on Disney property and they are so big on customer service.\\n\\nAside from the overly seasoned \\"Chicken Guy fries\\", I ordered a side of the \\"Mac Daddy Mac 'n' Cheese\\" since it's one of my favorite foods of all time. Although the side was macaroni and cheese was decently portioned, it was incredibly bland in taste. I'm not sure what their cheese sauce is made of, but it tasted like burnt American cheese that was left in the microwave for thirty seconds too long. I had a couple of bites and tapped out since I was full and honestly didn't like the mac and cheese.\\n\\nIn the end, I can honestly say that I was very underwhelmed with the Chicken Guy and don't think it lived up to the propaganda and excitement. Despite the short wait time and the wide selection of sauces that were actually quite tasty, the subpar, bland food and inattentive service given by young, rude staff members earn this place a rightful 2 out of 5 stars in my book. I don't think I'll find myself revisiting the Chicken Guy. Quite honestly, Chick-Fil-A has a chicken sandwich that can run circles around this joint.\\n\\n   Guy Fieri always talks about a place he so pridefully invented called Flavortown, where he takes those iconic food items and moments and gives them a home. Well Mr. Fieri, it looks like you drove right  past the exit to Flavortown with this one. \\n\\n**UPDATE: Had them reach out to me on here to email their manager, which I did. NEVER heard back, so after a month I emailed again, only to get a half ass voicemail from Trisha, the manager. Completely unprofessional. I've been telling EVERYONE to stay away from this place.***"},{"name":"Olive Branch","address":"115 W 3rd Ave","city":"Mount Dora","stars":"4","text":"Awesome new place.

Happy to say we loved it!\\n\\nWe started with the biscuits and the wedge salad. The biscuits were hot and fresh, served with honey butter and jam that were to die for. We got the wedge salad to have some semblance of vegetables, but it was topped with blue cheese, bacon, and a delicious dressing... so not healthy at all, but SUPER tasty. Highly recommend both.\\n\\nMy boyfriend had the fried chicken for his entree. He really enjoyed it and the honey was a nice touch. It came with street corn and peppers that weren't really standouts.\\n\\nI had the half rack of ribs. These were delicious and fall-off-the-bone tender. I really can't imagine coming back and not getting these - they were that good. They also came with cornbread (yum) and mac and cheese, which was made with velveeta. I'm not really into mac and cheese, but my boyfriend said it was good!\\n\\nWe were really full at this point, but decided to grab some pie to take home. We got a slice of key lime and a slice of mud pie. These weren't bad, but really nothing special. I wouldn't get dessert here again.

I am a Southern transplant who has been in Somerville for almost a year.  I was unaware at the time how fortunate my location in Somerville would be considering I am less than a block away from my beloved Highland Kitchen.  \\n\\nThere are numerous things I miss about the South and one is predominantly food.  I had no idea how much I would crave shrimp and grits, biscuits, fried chicken, etc.  However, one night I found myself pining away for all of these things, and then, I discovered Highland.\\n\\nI won't say that it is exactly like food from the south because it isn't, and that's what makes it so great.  The chefs add their own unique flavor on a lot of southern classics, and then they have, also, created their own dishes, such as buffalo brussel sprouts. YUM! \\n\\nI have been here almost a year and will admit that I eat at Highland on average probably twice a week.  It's sad I know.  Admittance of the problem is the first step, right?  However, I feel somewhat qualified to give this review since I do frequent there so often, so now on to the important stuff such as the atmosphere, food, and cocktails:\\n\\nHighland Kitchen gives off a laid back, rustic feel.  It's very welcoming and the staff is absolutely great.  They are warm and, in my experience, are always very helpful and ready to provide one with an array of suggestions when it comes to the menu.  Highland does fill up fast seeing as it's one of the most popular restaurants in Somerville, so I recommend getting there 30 minutes to an hour after it opens to snag a table.  However, if you're a lone diner, the bar is, also, a great place to sit.  The bartenders are extremely knowledgeable and friendly, as well, and even better the turn around rate on your drinks is quicker than at a table.  Also, if you are fortunate to live in a close proximity to Highland, the kitchen staff does expedite food very quickly.  I usually order my food for pick-up and have never waited more than 15-20 minutes. \\n\\nNow onto the menu.  I have had the majority of the food on the menu.  The apps are my favorite.  I like to order an array and call it a night.  The buffalo brussel sprouts really are worth all of the hype.  I am not a fan of brussel sprouts, but Highland has converted me.  The ricotta mozzarella fritters are one of my favorites; they are decadent.  Now, my only complaint thus far is that they have removed the shrimp and grits from their nightly menu, which was my go to meal, however it is still available on Sunday brunch, which is a must for anyone who loves breakfast.  I have, also, had the mussels and the handmade potato gnocchi and while not my favorite they are both savory.  The cuban reuben is my favorite sandwich there; it combines two classics for a delectable experience.  The veggie burger is, another good option, as well.  As far as, main courses are concerned; I love the porkchops which is not a regular menu item but one can see it once or twice a week; the steak-tips are, also, another great option.  They are very juicy and tender.  And, as far as, desserts I have yet to encounter anything I haven't loved.  The brownie sunday and banana bread pudding are decadent. \\n\\nMy favorite cocktail here is the monsoon.  It is Mount Gay Rum, Mango, and Ginger beer.  Absolutely a must if you like any of the above.  The bartenders, also, do a great bloody mary.  \\n\\nAnyway, if you made it this far in the review, you will, hopefully, instead of judging me for the frequency of my Highland consumption, find me to be a qualified critic.\\n\\nCheers."},{"name":"Cafe Agora Midtown","address":"92 Peachtree Pl NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Bless the hands of the cooks at Cafe Agora! \\n\\nFinding decent Mediterranean food in Atlanta is difficult. The most prominent type of food you find is wannabe Greek cuisine, i.e. gyros and spanakopita. In short, the options are ridiculously slim. Mediterranean food is so complex and rich and spans 3 different contents. So naturally, the flavors go well beyond shaved meat and yogurt sauce slathered on a fake pita. \\n\\nIn comes Cafe Agora to save the day. \\n\\nThis restaurant was recommended to me by my Turkish roommate. And from the first day, I was hooked. Everything is fresh and cooked to order. And Mehmet, the friendly guy at the counter is awesome!\\n\\nGo for the Mixed Grill platter if you want a bit of everything. It comes with beef k√∂fte, lamb and chicken kebab, gyro meat, a side salad, rice, pita and cacƒ±k. For $17, you can't go wrong. I especially love the k√∂fte. They're juicy, well-seasoned and scrumptious. \\n\\nFor a more vegetarian-friendly option, choose the Meze platter. It has a TON of food on it. Babaganoush, hummus, ezme, haydari, kisir, piyaz and havu√ß ezme. All be vegetarian. And with delicious pita for dipping. Don't know what that stuff is? Visit their website. Or even better. Drop in\\n\\nAnd let's not forget dessert. Like rice pudding? Try the Turkish version known as sutla√ß. Into baklava? Go for the cigars. Mehmet makes them exceptionally delicious. The best in town actually. \\n\\nFair warning!\\n\\nThe spanakopita isn't all that good. In fact, it's served rather mushy. Don't order it. There are better items.

Both dishes were stale and tasted like they were made 2 days before. The mushroom ravioli was chewy like rubber, entirely too salty, and accompanied by nearly zero sauce. The eggplant ravioli was also chewy, but more like tire rubber. The tomato sauce that was ladled over it was spicy but salty enough to de-ice a driveway. The browned garlic that's supposed to give a nice hint was more like a Gordon Ramsay shout. That's not a compliment. \\nTo end this dreamy experience, the hostess asked if we could get up so she could move our table closer to the already cramped crowd that would give anyone claustrophobia.

I have been charged different amounts for the same order, and since there are no prices listed on the board I cannot compare.  The set up is confusing and it is tough to determine where the line starts and it is strange to walk through and disrupt customers while deciding on where to order.  If you order food, don't expect it to come in a timely manner.  And if you ask the progress of you order, they argue with you.

For an opening weekend service was 99% spot on. We mostly drank wine and didn't plow into the cocktail menu, but I did try my friend's Seelbach - a drink famous from the Seelbach Hotel in Louisville, Kentucky - a tasty adult beverage which combines bourbon, Cointreau, sparkling wine and bitters. The ham tasting we started with offered three generous portions of flavorful southern hams, along with biscuits, and was delivered to our table in a flash, along with two bowls of cheese straws. We also started with a round of oysters from Reach Island which were quite fresh. For our main course we opted to order a couple of sides (again - huge portions!) and a variety of entrees to share family style. The sides - mac and cheese, in its full baked and breaded glory, and waffle fries, done up with gravy and curds like a southern poutine, for lack of a better description - were solid but the entrees really got us. Notably, we all loved the grilled lamb heart as the flavors worked so well together (Did you ever watch Macgyver as a kid and marvel at how he'd make a sophisticated device by putting disparate things together? Yeah, it's kinda like that. \\"Hey, a lamb heart with three things that start with P. I know, peanuts, popcorn and peaches!\\" ), the stuffed quail with bacon, figs and leeks, and the smoked oyster and crawfish pot pie. Didn't get to try dessert as we were crunched for time with a friend flying in at 11pm whom we didn't want to strand and there would have been a 10-15 min holdup as the kitchen had run out of chocolate crisps to go with hubby's mud pie (total first world problem, I know). But a) opening weekend and b) I hate rushing through meals so I can't deduct for this.\\n\\nAlso, it's more reasonably priced than I expected going in, compared to some restaurants I'd consider similar. Food for five - one cocktail, one beer, one bottle of petite sirah, eight oysters, a ham tasting, two sides, five entrees - came to $200. And we had leftovers. Waffle fry poutine with a couple fried eggs on top makes a killer breakfast the next morning."},{"name":"Sweet Hereafter","address":"3326 SE Belmont St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"This is possibly my favorite restaurant in portland, definitely my favorite vegan place.

Long wait times and long lines where there are so many other food options? Since I was arriving just around brunch time, and T&S were known for their brunch menu, I figured why not give it a try? I surely was not disappointed as even though the food dishes seemed rather simple, each had great flavor, creative pairings and tasty as well.\\n\\nWhen we arrived, there was already a long line of people already waiting for their turn. I'm not talking about just locals and tourists, but people who seemed to have just got off the plane (as some people still even had their luggages with them). We checked in and got seated as we scanned the menu. Seating arrangements are community style seating on long tables and sharing with other people. There are smaller tables to each side of the restaurant, but still very limited.  Also, restroom situation is a bit weird. You have to exit all the way to the back where it's more of a shared restroom with other shops (again, the community theme going). Oh yeah! For you ladies, look underneath the table for customized hooks for your purses!\\n\\nOur server was super sweet and accommodating to my vegetarian's friends needs! We got seated in a great spot where it faced the front large windows facing the front of the place where we could people watch. \\n\\nShoestring fries - crispy yummy\\nPotatoes bravas with over easy egg and aioli - potatoes were nicely flavored with a good aioli sauce\\nSaut√©ed Spanish with sunny egg - Spanish is naturally bitter, but these were actually pretty good.

It was heavily creamy to me and not so garlicky, which is not typical of most authentic Italian restaurants and I think that's what Pasta Da Pulcinella is supposed to be aiming for. For dessert, I split a cannoli with a friend. The creamy filling of the cannoli tasted too processed and too sweet, very confection like.

A nice local coffee shop with couches, internet, cozy and inviting but it ends there.  I like my coffee straight up, no flavors, with a touch of skim milk, an easy one.  If you are eating in, to enjoy the cozy atmosphere, they don't have real cups, only paper, kind of ruins the experience of sitting quietly and enjoying a nice cup of coffee.  They don't take debit or credit cards unless the bill in $5 or over, really people carry cash!  My coffee in a paper cup was lukewarm, I should have realized this when no cardboard cozy was placed around the cup to keep my fingers safe.  I wanted a muffin but the choices were pitiful, chocolate chip, bran or corn, so I went with the pumpkin scone which was mushy and undercooked.  An hour later I still can't get the horrible taste out of my mouth.  When I returned both items, the coffee to be warned and the pumpkin scone to be trashed the owner claims that she makes her scones soft, well yes not baking them all the way would do that.  She seemed put out that I didn't want to eat her trash but did refund the price of the scone and make me a fresh cup of coffee but insisted it was my taste that was the problem.

It was crowded and consisted of a fairly diverse group of people in their late 20s to 40s.  I recall the music was loud and the drinks were pricey but strong.  I wasn't really a fan of the bar scene, but knowing that they also served food during the day, I mentally bookmarked BBB and vowed to return to try some.\\n\\nRecently, a friend and I met up for lunch here one Tuesday around 1 pm.  There was literally one other customer aside from the two of us.  Although my friend expressed concern and questioned why it was so quiet here, I stayed positive as one of my co-workers had told me their chicken sandwich was good.\\n\\nAfter glancing at the lunch menu, I chose the Almond Crusted Chicken Sandwich Plate.  My friend ordered a bowl of the Seafood Gumbo.\\n\\nConsidering how empty the restaurant was, we expected the food to be served a lot quicker.  I would say it probably took about 15 minutes for us to get our food after we ordered.\\n\\n* Chicken Sandwich Plate (Lunch: Almond Crusted, $10) - Per the menu description, this plate consists of your \\"Choice of almond crusted or grilled chicken, ciabatta, field greens, ginger plum sauce, basil aioli with bbb fries.\\"  For a lunch item, I have to admit that $10 is a little steep for a chicken sandwich and fries.  However, this sandwich was fairly large, so much that it was served already cut in half.  Thank goodness!  And boy, was this delicious!  It tasted even better than it sounded.  Almond crusted...  Yum.  I requested a side of the basil aioli to dip my fries in, and they also brought me some of the ginger plum sauce.  I really liked both, especially with the seasoned BBB fries.\\n\\nHonestly, I was only able to eat half of the sandwich and had to take the other half to-go because it filled me up.  I was excited to have some more to enjoy later.  Unfortunately, my friend didn't like the Seafood Gumbo as much as I enjoyed my sandwich.  =(\\n\\nAbout a week after my delicious lunch at BBB, some of my co-workers invited me to join them for happy hour here on a Tuesday evening.  BBB's happy hour is from 4 to 7 pm, Monday through Friday.  They have a few options of \\"bites\\" (appetizers) that cost from $3 to $5 each and \\"sips\\" including the featured draft ($4), Cosmopolitan or Lemon Drop Martini ($5), and House wine ($7).  I would say those are fair deals considering the convenient location across the street from our office building.\\n\\nI ordered the Lemon Drop Martini, Lollipop wings, and BBB fries with basil sea salt ($3).  My co-workers and I sat at the bar since it wasn't too busy and got our drinks and apps fairly quickly.\\n\\n* Lemon Drop Martini ($5) - This martini was just the right amount of sweet, tart, and STRONG.  I don't have much else to add except that I recommend it!  Great deal at $5.\\n\\n* Lollipop wings ($4) - There were three choices of flavors of wings, and I went with the Jerk BBQ because it was supposedly the most popular.  I had asked the server how many wings come with the order, and she responded that it really depended on the size of the wings.  I ended up getting five small wings, but they were tasty!  It had a bit of heat to it, but nothing I couldn't handle.  \\n\\nI ordered my BBB fries with a side of ranch, but they were also good dipped in the Jerk BBQ sauce.  Although they're tiny, I would recommend the Jerk BBQ wings and the fries as well.  They were great accompaniments to the strong Lemon Drop Martini.\\n\\nOverall, Buckhead Bottle Bar & Bistro gets 4 stars for their tasty food and friendly service.  Yes, the food is kind of pricey, and I personally wouldn't come here if I had to deal with the horrible parking situation (fortunately, I could park at my office and walk over).  However, I will come back because it is so conveniently close to my office building, and the happy hour offers fair prices on apps and strong drinks.\\n\\n[Review 330 of 366]"},{"name":"Fuel BBQ","address":"120 S Park Ave","city":"Sanford","stars":"4","text":"My sister and I was craving for some bbq and wanted to try a new place.

Quite a lot actually...hopefully you're in the mood for some light reading.  I've been to Kings twice and have not yet picked up a bowling ball.  OK, well I picked up a ball, but didn't actually get to bowl.  Let me explain.\\n\\nThe first time, I went with four friends and this was the least eventful of the two visits.  A Friday night, 9pm.  I put us down for bowling and they took my license from me...told me it would be a two hour wait, but I could put my name in to play pool while we waited for bowling.  Seemed fair.  Ordered a drink...the waitress in the \\"sitting area\\" took my debit card.  The buzzer went off for pool within about 30 minutes and I went over to get the table number and the pool balls.  They took my credit card because the systems aren't linked for pool and drinks in the sitting area.  At this point, Kings now had three separate pieces of identification.  OK, fine.  We took our drinks with us and went into the next room to play pool.  Finished the first round of drinks and found that the waitress in the pool area was different than the waitress in the \\"sitting area\\".  Tried to order drinks from her and she told me she needed a card to open a tab.  At this point, I had no cards left to give, so she had to get my other tab, close it, and open another one.  Wow.  Poor system of tracking tabs if you ask me.  Stayed another hour or two...never got to bowl.  Still wanted to try another time.\\n\\nThe second visit.  I believe it was a Saturday night this time...9pm also.  Arrived and put my name in.  They took my license again of course, but this time, it was a FOUR HOUR WAIT for bowling, which pretty much meant we wouldn't be bowling until they closed.  I reminded them of this, and the guy at the counter just kind of shrugged and said we could play pool in about 20 mins while we waited for bowling.  A likely story.  Went with three friends this time...ordered nachos and drinks while we waited for two of them.  Again, a debit card was taken from me.  The nachos arrived and they were terrible...for some reason, they put liquid movie theater squeeze cheese on the top, but we found real cheese in the middle.  We immediately reported to the waitress that this was terrible and asked her if they ran out of real cheese.  She replied by telling us that was how they make it.  We sent it back, since as I said, it was TERRIBLE, and of course didn't order any other food items.  The two other friends showed up and after about 50 mins, we still hadn't been paged for pool.  I asked the guy at the counter about the supposed 20 minute wait, and he handed me a set of balls, \\"here you go\\".  Took my remaining credit card (again leaving me without ID).  Went to play pool for about 45 minutes and during this time, the waitress in the pool room couldn't find the waitress from the sitting room who was apparently strolling around Kings with my debit card in a pocket or something, leaving me with the inability to order more drinks.  Wrapped up a game we were playing and decided we would leave...it was at that point that one of my friends decided to take all of this out on us and be an ass, but I can hardly blame Kings for that part so I won't write about it as part of my review.  The waitress finally found my debit card and returned it with my bill...I collected the rest of the ID and credit card along with the bill for pool...we paid all of the bills and left the building, never to return again.\\n\\nSo why can't Kings get their billing situation straightened out?  You have to give separate cards for pool, food in one room, food in the next room, and presumedly bowling, but I wouldn't know that since I've never bowled there.  Why are they walking around with people's credit/debit cards?  And if I walk in, and you just can't fit me in for bowling, just say so.  So, there's an addition to this, as if I hadn't already said enough.  Just last week, on a friend's Facebook page, Kings left a comment for his birthday:\\n\\n\\"Happy Birthday, *****!! If you're looking for a fun place to celebrate tonight, come bowl for free at Kings Boston! Just say you were invited on Facebook at the front desk and you'll be all set! Remember to show them your ID and everyone needs to be 21+ after 6PM. We hope to see you tonight!\\"\\n\\nI couldn't leave that there without a comment:  \\"Haha...this is funny to me because I've been to Kings twice and never bowled. The last time they said it would be a 4hr wait and that was past their closing time by about 30 minutes.\\"\\n\\nKings replied within 10 minutes: \\"Jeff we do offer priority lane reservations which is a dinner reservations for the restaurant and you get bumped to the top of the wait list as long as everyone orders entrees - it helps avoid the sometimes long wait that we have\\"\\n\\nSo in order to enjoy bowling at Kings, you must eat there first to get a priority lane offer...and if you don't, you continue to get bumped all night long, which is likely why I've never bowled there."},{"name":"Eleven at Reunion Resort","address":"7593 Gathering Dr","city":"Kissimmee","stars":"3","text":"This was a up and down type of night, both the food and service had highs and lows.

My husband accurately described our dining experience as overwhelming to the palate.  We thoroughly enjoy 5 course menus or chef's tasting menus, but the courses at Beast, had too much going on.  Too many flavors in one plate and not enough in between to cleanse the palate.  Furthermore, and this may be due to the latter, the courses tasted salty.  San Franciscans are very sensitive to that, as we're increasingly health conscious.\\n\\nLastly, what's with the hard chairs?!  At the end of a three hour dinner, my butt hurt, and throughout I felt as if I was at the principal's office--the chairs were so upright!  Well, at least Beast encourages good posture!"},{"name":"Dos Madres Cantina","address":"340 W Ponce de Leon Ave, Ste 100","city":"Decatur","stars":"2.5","text":"Decided to NOT wait in the line at Taqueria Del Sol as it was so hot this afternoon and try Dos Madres.

It came out completely well-done. There was no issue when sending the steak back and they even offered him complimentary soup. That he already had. I mean the Lobster bisque is really good but it's pretty buttery so he didn't eat it a second time. He even politely said that he had already eaten it earlier--the manager just mumbled something under his breath to the waiter and left. \\n\\nContinuing on our meal--my sister and I were sharing some of the crab macaroni when I pulled a whole hard shell knuckle out of my mouth.

At that point we were already late for another reservation at 9--it was a 2 1/2 hour dinner, that was long for the wrong reasons.

We arrived without reservation, but were told it was open seating in the bar and we right away saw 2 or 3 empty tables so happily took one.  The downside to sitting in the bar was that it was incredibly loud.  We sat at a small round table near the window and entrance and could barely hear each other.  \\nThere were 2 different people working in the bar and they said they would be taking care of us together.  They brought us menus and ice water.  My first thought upon glancing at the menu was, \\"where is the rest of it?\\"  It seemed quite sparse.  I wondered if we had a limited bar menu, but no, it was the full menu.  Luckily, I did manage to find one of the items I read about on yelp and ordered the Nashville Hot Chicken.  That being said, if I hadn't ordered that, there was zero else on the menu that appealed to me.  There was a lot of seafood on the menu and neither my friend or I eat seafood, so this is part of the issue.  \\nMy friend and I decided to split this item and that was a good call.  The portion size was large with 4 pieces of chicken and a side of macaroni and cheese.  First of all Nashville Hot Chicken is usually served with pickles.  I am disappointed to say this was served with a bread and butter pickle relish.  Neither of us like bread and butter pickles so we scraped those off.  The chicken was really delicious.  It was succulent, and juicy with great flavor.  It was hot, but not too hot. They had this white bbq to go with it that was really interesting and which we both quite enjoyed.   The macaroni and cheese was delicious and it had a soft white cheese on top,  sort of ricotta like, but why oh why did they have to ruin the macaroni with collards?!  They put collards in the macaroni!  I did not care for this at all.  The macaroni was delicious, but I spent so much time picking around the collards that I didn't eat very much of it.  \\nFinally, my friend had been here before and had the best wine of her life, but was disappointed that it was no longer available, at least not by the glass.  She ordered a Cabernet instead and was disappointed.  I ordered a Cocktail called a Lost Horizon and did not care for it at all.  To start of with the color was off putting.  It was a muddy brown color.  It was bitter at the beginning and sweet at the end.

The scrambled eggs were dotted with the soft cheese and that creaminess worked well. Overall, I didn't really feel like delving into the 2nd slider, which would normally never be the case.\\n\\nThe benedict was served on housemade english muffins with nitrate free ham and, of course, poached eggs & hollandaise. The BF has become somewhat of a eggs benedict connoisseur. He said his hollandaise didn't have the lemony tang of others (like Sanborn's & Meriwether's) and that he was surprised he missed it. I tried the sauce & it was missing something. The ham though was the \\"best ham ever\\" as the menu states. It reminded us of the pork loin slices he had in his benny at Veritable Quandary. \\n\\nDon't get me wrong, I'd go back because it's cute & local, but I really would rather head elsewhere for food at better prices."},{"name":"Kawawa Japanese Restaurant","address":"E15-4700 Kingsway","city":"Burnaby","stars":"2","text":"I made a yelp account to post this review.

When I finally ordered, I asked if I could make a simple change to my combo, just switch out one of the items. Obviously, they declined. It doesn't seem like they care much at all for the customer.

And this place certainly did not disappoint. Called in an hour beforehand to be put on the waiting list for a table for 2 for 8:30 on a Saturday evening; got seated within 10 mins. Ordered the daily mussels which was similar to the Provencal but with chorizo. The mussels were well cooked and the sauce was so delicious we soaked the rest of our bread in it. For entrees I got the hake masala and my husband got the haddock piccata. That hake masala was one of the best fish dishes I've ever had. The fish was flaky and well cooked with delicious sauce. The sides of mashed potato and spinach we're also good but with such good portion sizes I barely touched the sides. My husband also really liked his meal; the sauce wasn't too overwhelming with the lemon which was his initial concern. Service was excellent. We would definitely come back the next time we want seafood."},{"name":"Beast","address":"5425 NE 30th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I was really looking forward to this restaurant but the experience was lacking. We got seated at a community table, which is fine, but prefer to have own table to talk freely to the person I came with. The speed at which the food was served was slooooow. With such simple dishes, I'd expect a much more polished service. \\n\\nThe food was boring, unbalanced, and overpriced. The first course was a blueberry clafoutis with a gratuitous piece of candied bacon sticking out. The custard texture was good enough but it was overly sweet. The bacon added nothing except an inane instagram prop. \\n\\nThe second course was a cucumber salad with labneh and bay shrimp that was dry and non-cohesive. Bay shrimps are mealy and can be used in a tossed salad maybe , but not unadorned on such a deconstructed dish, as it shows their mealy, unappealing texture. The cucumbers themselves were good, but the labneh dressing was much too firm and there was not enough of it. This dish was boring and not well thought out. \\n\\nThe main dish was a hash of pork with poached egg and crisped bread. The description of this dish by the waiter was an absolute joke.  He waxed and waned unenthusiastically for a really long time about how it was prepared and what ingredients were used. The eating experience was also a joke. There were a couple large pieces of totally inedible meat with dense cartilage. The hash was heavy, flat, dry, and one-dimensional. The egg was overcooked, and the bread was nearly inedibly hard. \\n\\nThey threw in some petit fours at the end, the highlight of the whole meal believe it or not. There was a passionfruit/guava type gummy that was quite good. The other two items, a chocolate cake and some cookie were very forgettable. \\n\\nThe bill was $80 for two people, which, given the poor food quality/service, not worth it. \\n\\nAll in all, I would strongly recommend against dining at this restaurant until they can step up their game."},{"name":"McDonald's","address":"150 Hickman Dr","city":"Sanford","stars":"2","text":"Years of fast food.

Warm cheese goodness with a little kick.  The chips are big and greasy, but if you are ordering a big bowl of melted cheese it is akin to polishing the silverware on the Titanic to complain the chips aren't very healthy.  I have to say I was disappointed by the tacos though.  My girlfriend and I ordered four total and shared and none of them were worth ordering again.  If I come back, I won't order any of the tacos, I think I will try the quesadillas.\\n\\nMy girlfriend LOVED the organic margaritas, I really couldn't tell the difference, but they were good.

Seafood enthusiasts would love this place for it has the perfect balance of intense flavor and incredibly well cooked seafood. \\n\\nIt's a small restaurant with an incredibly eclectic patronage. At any given time I have seen people of all nationalities sitting at this place and it makes it that much more fun to come and dine here. The staff is incredibly nice as well and the decor of the place lends itself to a cheery atmosphere fit to be right out of a finding nemo set (the giant wall art with marine life and a net around it being the focal point). \\n\\nThey have a great juice bar for people who want something refreshing to start off with. However we decided to forgo that and get right into pigging out. So the appetizer order was the fried yucca. Oh how delicious - when served it doesn't look all that appetizing for it doesn't have much color nor does it have anything in terms of presentation, but the taste makes up for all of that and much more. The dipping sauce provides a great way to add to the taste of the crispy fried yucca and we had soon devoured the entire thing within 5 minutes of it being served. On to the next!\\n\\nYou cannot come here and not try their signature moquecas. Unfortunately, I am allergic to shellfish and cannot try most of their moquecas. Fortunately they cater to one and everyone, so they have a fish, fish and calamari, and even a vegetarian moqueca. PERFECT! So we went ahead with the Fish and Calamari one and it certainly did not disappoint. The sizzling clay pot that is brought out (after a good waiting period of about 20 minutes) to show that there was a reason for the waiting we had to endure, the colors are immediately eye catching, as is the aroma and the sizzle of it all. This dish is amazing. The fish was cooked to perfection (they change the fish each time you order this dish) and melted in my mouth and the calamari was equally amazing. My only gripe with this dish is that of the two times I've been here and ordered this dish, it seems to lack a little bit of salt and thus doesn't have that punch - but no worries, we add some salt and pepper and the incredibly spicy side they have at the table and voila, we're set! Oh is it delicious...\\n\\nThe second entree we ended up ordering was the Lansanha de Banana which is made with plantain, 3 cheese sauce & oregano. Brought along with it is a plate of rice. I don't even want to THINK about how many calories are in this dish, simply because I just don't want to ruin it for me ever ordering it. The three types of cheeses melted on the sweet plantains are incredible. Though you have to be hungry for a day or so to finish this dish - it's simply too rich to finish al in one go, especially when there's another entree on the table...even with two people. But man is it good!\\n\\nAfter we were sufficiently stuffed, we looked over our shoulders to see our neighbors being served flan. Suddenly (and magically) there was more room created in our stomachs for more food! So we continue our culinary journey through Brazil to end our night with some flan. Nothing spectacular, but certainly satisfying and a good way to put a close to a wonderful meal. \\n\\nThis place is quite far from where I live. I have to catch two different trains and walk an extra 15-20 minutes to get to this place, but I'm willing to do it over and over again simply because their food and everything about their restaurant is amazing.

They're clearly an established restaurant with a reliable kitchen and attentive staff. Of the times I've been there I've been treated well by the staff. The food is not a flavor tour de force, but it's not terrible either. \\n\\nMezzo caters to the well-to-do in the area, and it shows, I think, in making an effort not to excel  but to not offend. Not offend the senses. Not offend delicate palates. Not offend someone's established sense of entitlement. Something that I think anyone who has worked in a service-sector job, particularly to clients of means, can understand. \\n\\nNo single element of the experience - aside from its price - really stood out for me that beckoned me to return and fight for a parking place on a busy weekend evening. \\n\\nI went here for a birthday celebration, to give a more concrete example for reference, and I remember exactly nothing about the food, the service, or even where we were seated.

I'm pretty sure they cook/smoke all of their meat in house, resulting in a super tender and fresh product that is unforgettable. Most notably, their turkey avocado sandwich and their pastrami ones. Their homemade sausages are also great, as well as the accompanying mustard (and this is coming from someone who normally despises mustard!)!

That was a little surprising seeing that it was a Saturday night and to have already ran out of those items. Instead he decided on the pulled pork platter and he wanted to have the rice and beans side which they didn't have the rice ready so he ended up choosing fries and veggies.

The yuca came with a dipping sauce called fancy sauce. Most Hispanics, like myself call this sauce mayo-ketchup. Basically mayo and ketchup with garlic. It was a good compliment to the starchy yuca. The rice and beans were pretty bad in my opinion. Just no flavor at all. That's probably bad judgement on my part. After all, black beans and rice are not really a bbq staple. Should have gone with the Apple/fennel slaw, which looked really good. Now to the ribs. They were incredibly moist and tender. But again, just nothing special about them. Overall the meal was good.

Seating is one long table and one large booth, so get cozy with your neighbour!\\n\\nI've heard good things about the pho, but the real gems of this restaurant are in some of the less-often travelled items. Case in point: the Betel leaf wrapped beef appetizer. This  appy is interactive - you get to customize and wrap the beef yourself.  Add any combination of bean sprouts, pickled veggies, banana flower, basil, lettuce, peanuts, and vermicelli to your betel leaf-wrapped beef and wrap the works up in a softened rice wrapper. Flavours were bright, the meat was juicy and delectably seasoned, and the make-your-own factor lent itself to a fantastic and humorous date! I'd come back for this dish alone.\\n\\nThe spring rolls were firm and crispy on the outside, and had a softer middle - likely due to the addition of taro to the typical porky mix. Delicious.\\n\\nThe classic bahn mi was very tasty according to my date. The bread was less airy and more densely baguette-y, but I actually preferred it. The flavours and textures layered really well.\\n\\nIn comparison to many of the pho-focused Vietnamese joints in town, there is a deeper complexity and balance of flavours coming out of this kitchen.

I've only eaten them on Taco Tuesdays because it's 2 for $5 (no mixing, must be two of the same). Otherwise, I think the tacos are overpriced, especially if La Taqueria is a 15-20 minute walk to Cambie & Broadway. \\n\\nAlso had a carne guisada Boccadillo, which is a basic street sandwich you can find in South America.  Great balance of beef, onion and arugula.That was amazing! I'll order it even on Taco Tuesdays.\\n\\nThe mussels are also amazing! Cooked in a coconut broth, they remind me an affordable version of the Chambar Congolese mussels. Definitely worth splitting or sharing with friends (maybe that's why they're on the Tapas section of the menu?!)\\n\\nLast but not least... THE SHOTS! Highly recommend the El Tigre shot that comes with a \\"Verdita\\" chaser: a puree of mint, cilantro, pineapple juice, and a bit of jalape√±o. Takes the tequila edge off immediately. It's so good I ended up asking for the recipe! Definitely serving it next time I have taco night at my place! There's also a \\"sangria\\" chaser, made out of a spicy tomato base... have to ask for that recipe next time!\\n\\nAmbiance. Very laid-back, chill and minimalist. The red and orange lights remind me of Cha Chas in Seattle. \\n\\nAnd now... the not-so-good:\\n\\nThe staff is friendly, but a bit slow. Granted I'm there on Taco Tuesday nights when it's crowded.. but they did end up forgetting my carnets taco and had to remind them twice about it. One time I was with a larger party and they screwed up our bills a bit... oh well! \\n\\nEmpanadas. I'm not a fan of them to begin with, but the ones here seemed half full of meat that slid to the bottom when you tried to eat them... so my first bite was practically fried dough... but in a dried, reheated sort of way. Will not be ordering them again. \\n\\nIn conclusion, if you like Mexican food, go here. You won't be disappointed, hopefully.

I wish I could comment on the taste of the catfish though, because it was smothered in their smoky-pepper cajun remoulade sauce, and I couldn't taste anything else.\\n\\nMy southwestern fried chicken was indeed a southwest take on fried chicken, because the batter had a bit more spice to it, and a LOT more salt. Unfortunately, it went beyond juicy to slightly greasy. The smoked andouille sausage was grilled to perfection, but the blistered shishito peppers were, to me, sort-of meh.  I think I liked the street corn, but again, I couldn't get much of the flavor, because this, too, was drenched in a sauce that overwhelmed any flavor the corn might have had.

The fries were the one item they could improve. The seasoning was a bit heavy and a little too salty. Overall it was delicious and I plan on going again just asking for the fries to be seasoned lightly."},{"name":"Truluck's","address":"10225 Research Blvd, Ste 4000","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Came here for my birthday dinner, was my first time at Truluck's but I had high expectations for it due to what I had heard about the restaurant. I can safely say that is did not disappoint! We arrived relatively early after the restaurant opened, as our table reservation was at around 5. It was Easter Sunday so I had anticipated it having more people but it was relatively empty, although that may have to do with out time arriving after it opened. There was a live music lounge out front which was really cool to see, and the atmosphere of the restaurant was very nice and relaxed.\\n\\nThe staff greeted me very warmly and wished me a happy birthday, which was very nice.Our server was very accommodating to me and my family, and he was happy to explain to us wine recommendations and other items on the menu. We started with some salad and the escargot, both of which were delicious however I do wish that there was more escargot, as our table of 4 went through that appetizer fairly fast. Then we had our main entrees. I ordered the Swordfish Steak, which was delicious and well cooked with the sides being very good as well. My family ordered the Miso-glazed seabass which I tried a little and it was very delicious and the Ribeye steak, which was also cooked to a perfect medium rare and was great as well. Finally, for dessert they brought out a complimentary Baked Alaska that the server then lit on fire (with Bacardi Rum acting as the fuel) and cut for us. This was absolutely delicious, with the flame adding a nice hint of char to the cold ice cream and the rums flavor being present in the cake as well. It even had a Happy Birthday message written in hard chocolate on the plate as well which was a nice touch. \\n\\nAll in all, I had a fantastic experience at Trulucks and while the price may be high, I would say it was worth it."},{"name":"king bao","address":"11768 E Colonial Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"My whole family loves King Bao!

My dinner came up to $15.  I was very full, happy and not feeling guilty about eating such large quantity of food.  The ambiance at Ping was casual and hipster.  The service was friendly and very attentive.  I felt very comfortable dining by my-self there.  Most people dined alone or in couple.  You have your choice sitting at the bar or table for two.  I was given a table for two at the window. \\n\\n      1.   Wild caught prawns skewer came with three borderline large shrimps with the shells and tails intact.  You need to remove the tail and shell (I ate the shell).  It was the best value.  The shrimps were marinated and grilled to perfection.  The skewers came with a dipping sauce of salt, pepper and a piece of lime.  I like this the best.\\n       2.  Chicken Breast skewer came with about three to four 1/2\\" cube chicken breast, marinated, grilled and a sauce was brushed on them after grilling.  It was perfectly grilled and seasoned.  It was good but nothing extraordinary; the portion was on a small side.\\n       3.  Cucumber relish - this was cut up pickle sized cucumber, cut up shallot and cut up fresh hot pepper pickled in a sweet vinegar solution.  It was good but very hot.  I had to picked out the hot pepper and set them aside.\\n        4.  Sticky rice - about a cup of sticky rice steamed in an individual whisker container.  Good portion size and was steamed to perfection.\\n\\n\\n Overall, Ping offers fresh, healthy dishes at affordable price with casual, modern, hipsters ambiance and good customer service.  I had a good dinner and a relaxing time at Ping."},{"name":"Salt & Straw","address":"2035 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Salt & Straw is one of my favorite ice cream places and is definitely worth the usual wait and hype. I used to be able to eat here (as in Salt & Straw in general, not necessarily this location) every so often, as I used to go to school in Eugene, but ever since I've moved back to San Francisco I don't get Salt & Straw as much as I'd like to. I came to this location shortly after eating at Pine State Biscuits, which isn't too far away. Though I was stuffed, I was sure to make room for some ice cream, even though I had Salt & Straw the night before at its 23rd Ave. location, which ran out of cinnamon snickerdoodle. Luckily, this location had some, and I was able to try it and fall in love. The night before, I ordered a double scoop of cinnamon smoked apple, which was delicious with it's big chunks of apples, but was a bit too overpowering after the first scoop; the continuous taste got to me and I couldn't finish it. So at this location, I ordered a double scoop of cinnamon smoked apple and cinnamon snickerdoodle on a waffle cone; my mom ordered the same thing she got the night before: a single scoop of honey lavender on a regular cone; and my boyfriend ordered a single scoop of cinnamon snickerdoodle. We all loved our ice cream, as expected, but my boyfriend and I occasionally tasted a slight coffee flavor in our cinnamon snickerdoodle scoops, which wasn't too bad, but very unexpected, as neither of us like coffee. The people who work at this location are very nice, as they are at most Salt & Straw locations, and the lady who helped me gave my group generous portions of ice cream. One thing that was great about my last visit was that there wasn't much of a line, which is very rare for Salt & Straw. Sadly, I was only in Portland for Labor Day weekend, so I won't be getting Salt & Straw any time soon, but this last visit was everything I could have asked for."},{"name":"Southern Kin Cookhouse","address":"500 Assembly Row","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"We sat outside and had a very nice waitress for lunch on a beautiful Sunday.

I already know what I wanted, Chicken Butt Skewers and Quail Egg wrapped in Bacon skewers with a side of Jasmine Rice.\\nI also got a Knee High cocktail. \\n\\nThe server was friendly and nice, but a little bit in \\"Let me tell you the concept of this dish\\" mode. I know they probably do that so people that aren't familiar with Asian street style food won't be so surprise of what they are getting. \\nJust maybe they should have a \\"How to eat chicken butt skewers guide\\" on the table just to make it easier and so the poor waiter doesn't have to repeat himself every time he brings out dishes to us.\\n\\nAnyway, here comes the dilemma about Ping. The taste of food is excellent, five stars all across the board. It was fresh, tasty, perfectly seasoned, and delicious. However, the portion of food is about one star which meant, it's too little. Those skewers are about $5-$7 for two skewers and they are smaller than Biwa's.\\n\\n If their concept is Asian street style food, then they went the wrong way with their portioning. I grew up in Jakarta, I know how big skewers are there and how filling they are. It doesn't make sense that Indonesian chickens have fattier butts than American chickens. \\n\\nSo, I spent $23 including tip for my meal and I was still hungry. We left to another place and had pretty satisfying meal for about $9, but that's for another review.\\n\\nAfter I visited Ping, I realized how much Pok Pok is a better restaurant. I know they are not the same, but the concept is pretty much the same. At least at Pok Pok, I can get their half bird for around $9, side of rice, and cocktail for about $16 and completely full.\\n\\nI guess, Ping is a good place if you just want snacks and in the mood of splurge.

My friend has to open up her menu, find what she's looking for and say, \\"I'll have the burger.\\"\\n\\nI'll say the \\"bife\\" was okay. It's better than the $10 steak with all the fixin's in old Vegas, but that's old Vegas and it reeks of desperation. It was an unassuming cut of steak that's wasn't all about being flashy like \\"looky here! I'm a steak!\\" It only merely suggested it's steakiness. And, dear god, the potatoes. They must have unloaded these potato-chip-thin slices of potatoes on my plate and got a phone call and forgot to stop.

Especially their sandwiches, which range from $8-$9. \\n\\nNow, when I'm visiting an establishment and come across the Reuben on any given menu, I'll almost always try it. I'm a Reuben enthusiast and I'm highly critical when presented with one. The ideal sandwich should have the Corned Beef (or Pastrami) piled high on Swiss cheese with copious amounts of Sauerkraut and Thousand Island Dressing between Rye. With that said, when I received my Reuben at Toojay's.. it was  supremely disappointing. I thought to myself, \\"Are they for real??\\" It was TINY in my eyes. There were maybe 3 slices of Corned Beef, barely any Sauerkraut/Thousand Island and the slices of Rye were small in circumference. $9 went down the drain. I could've gone to subway and gotten 2 foot long subs for $10!! \\n\\nJust last week I ordered their Smoked Nova Salmon bagel; and again, I was disappointed by the portion. Another waste of $8. It seems they're intentionally measly. \\n\\nI've also been there for breakfast/brunch a hand-full of times. Their omelets and brunch dishes are decent, but nothing special. \\n\\nI will say their saving grace is the extensive menu and desserts.  Above all, their Dill Chicken Salad Sandwich.  It is sublime, and they give you a pretty good amount for the price.  I've gone out of my way to visit Toojay's for this sandwich alone. Not sure why they decided to be liberal on this sandwich in particular.  \\n\\nI feel like Toojay's has the right concept of a NY style deli, but lacks in that home grown feel that a legit deli should have.  It lacks authenticity for me and feels artificial.  \\n\\nThe best analogy I can think of is going to an Olive Garden instead of a home grown Italian family run restaurant.\\n\\nSimply put, It lacks love and passion."},{"name":"George's Greek Coney Island","address":"2396 Old Stringtown Rd","city":"Grove City","stars":"4","text":"Excellent salad for those looking to eat a bit more lightly.

B and I were headed to Hele Pele and seeing it was packed, we decided to check out Pour. I've seen it plenty of times driving by and never had the opportunity to check it out. We walked by and it looked like it was closing so B and I decided to head back to HP when this guy comes out of Pour and invites us to come in and have a glass of wine on him. He introduced himself as Robert, the owner. What happened next was a mix of wonderful and strange, which wasn't a bad thing by any means. There were only a handful of people there when we arrived. A couple in the corner that appeared to be on a first date and another couple with the cutest pup in a sweater that I've ever seen. Robert brought us two glasses of a beautiful red and we decided to order some grub. We ordered the risotto, the lamb sliders and the fondue. The risotto was good, perfectly cooked, needed a bit of salt but was solid. The lamb sliders were yummy, they had a depth of flavor that can only be achieved with time and love. The fondue was good as well, but the standout was the caramel apple pie that Robert's sister made. Robert was our server and host and did a fine job making sure we were happy. All that was wonderful. Now, on to the strange, which again is not a bad thing. The cutie pie pup made the space feel much more homey and cozy than the decor made it out to be. The space is pretty but felt like its suffering a bit of an identity crisis and made it feel disjointed. I'm no interior decorator or even have an eye for decor so that is just my humble opinion.

The only reason I step into this place is because it's 6pm and my wife is having a dim sum craving. I don't know of any other place with a wide selection and available after 3pm. I'm secretly hoping a fellow yelp'er will help a sister out.\\n\\nI really wish they would take a scrub brush to this place. Not only is it in serious need of a renovation makeover but they really need to fold down the extension flaps on the smaller tables and clean the cracks of food from time to time. That or use some table cloths. Normally, when I sit at the table I like to rest my forearms on the edge - at this place I keep my arms in my lap. Also, at random intervals they'll blast the place with air conditioning. I understand the need to keep the place cooler and ventilated with all of the hot pots steaming, but other places usually just keep it cool at all times instead of taking their customers on temperature roller coaster.\\n\\nThe dim sum menu is decent but even though I'm usually pretty good at figuring out which ones are my favourites some of their English descriptions leave me scratching my head and I have to ask the waiter. Because it's after-hour dim sum, understandably, it usually takes 20 minutes for them to steam the food and then it just comes en masse. \\n\\nWhen we were there last week, however, for some reason they staggered the food. We were literally eating one dish at a time which made for a less enjoyable experience since the point of dim sum is to have some variety of choices as you eat. The food quality and price is decent enough but nothing that's really amazing so I take what I can get considering the time of day. I can't speak to the hot pot menu because it's been quite a while since I've had it here or other places.\\n\\nI can say that the service is shoddy if you're not having hot pot. The restaurant is pretty big and they like to seat people by the windows which also happens to be at the very opposite end of where the cashier counter is. This makes it impossible to flag down any of the staff who like to hang around the counter until they're needed. The waiters don't think to scan the tables (either physically or with their eyes) to see if the customers need anything.\\n\\nIt's worth noting that they accept debit here. Most places only either take credit and/or cash. Also, for their parking lot, even though they have signs every where saying that it's a pay parking lot, we've never once paid and never been fined for it -- not really sure what that's about.\\n\\n1 star for having dim sum available all day and night, 1 star for not robbing me blind for making dim sum available at all hours of the day. -3 stars for the cleanliness and service."},{"name":"Cafe Agora Midtown","address":"92 Peachtree Pl NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"A Taste of the Mediterranean in Midtown Atlanta.  \\n\\nThe bustling corner almost makes you forget that you're in Atlanta, but a real city with a vibrant street culture.\\n\\nI've never tried the original Cafe Agora in Buckhead, but everything tasted fresh and light.  \\n\\nLoved the Mixed maza platter which lets you sample a lot of the dips like the smooth hummus (never getting the store stuff again!),  Havuc Ezme (a mix of carrot and yogurt), Tabouli, roasted eggplant, Baba Ganoush, and more.\\n\\nAlso had the Adana Kebab - a kebab of seasoned ground lamb served with rice pilaf and lightly seasoned salad. \\n\\nWill definitely be back."},{"name":"The Rambler","address":"4205 N Mississippi Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Fantastic place with good food, good drinks, and fantastic vibe.

This made for a pleasantly different breakfast experience compared to the typical breakfast/brunch restaurant. The server explained the dishes are meant to be shared so my fianc√© and I split the Shakshuka and the Smoked Salmon Hash. The Shakshuka is the restaurant's most popular dish and for good reason. The dish is essentially a flavorful tomato stew with cooked onions and peppers and topped with a fried egg. We ordered the dish with sausage which added a delicious meatiness to the stew. Large pieces of thick toast soaked up the stew nicely. The Smoked Salmon Hash was also delicious. The chunks of salmon were meaty, flakey and smoky and were complimented perfectly with cooked potatoes, cauliflower, and red bell peppers, a fried egg, and a lightly spicy creamy horseradish sauce. Overall, this was a fantastic breakfast experience."},{"name":"Chicken Guy!","address":"1506 E Buena Vista Dr, Ste A","city":"Lake Buena Vista","stars":"3.5","text":"Cheap and delicious!

It also came with two signature sauces and I got  curry mayo and sweet sriracha bbq, both of which were delicious. The sauces are a hit or miss. I also tried sweet n sour and special sauce, but didnt really like either of them. The chicken tenders were perfectly crispy and not too oily. I also shared an order of fries with a friend.

If you're a UT student without a trust fund, just keep on walkin'.  I can be a cheap-ass with the best of them but if I'm going to pay good money for a meal, it's got to be memorable (in a good way).  Seeing as I can't stop thinking about the food at Swift's Attic, I'd say it qualifies.\\n\\nSwift's Attic is part of a newish breed of restaurant usually called the \\"gastropub\\" that is like a non-Spanish Tapas bar with a dual focus on delicious, interesting food in sharable, small portions (i.e. quality over quantity) and booze.  I didn't actually drink any booze on this visit so I'll focus on the former.\\n\\nOur server recommended 2-3 dishes per person, we each ordered two and there was some overlap of dishes ordered multiple times.  Of what was ordered I only sampled three items:\\nheirloom tomato salad, the roasted beets, and the braised goat.  All of these were superb.  \\n\\nThe surprise winner was the one that wasn't my order - the heirloom tomato salad.  I don't know what kind of crack was in this salad but it was beyond delicious.  I can't even describe the flavors but there was some kind of creamy coating on everything that was just out of this world.  Aside from the chopped tomatoes and other things I can't remember (apples maybe?) there were delicious croutons and OMGWHEREHAVEYOUBEENALLMYLIFE grilled cheese bits.  (I don't mean mini-sandwiches, I mean chunks of cheese that were put on a grill to char the edges... you have to taste to see how good these were).  I have been dreaming about this dish for a week now.\\n\\nThe roasted beets were also very tasty.  They came with a vanilla yogurt sauce that had a hint of mint infusion and some kind of spikey lettuce.  \\n\\nI could come here alone, order those two dishes, be full and happy though a bit poorer in the wallet.\\n\\nThe braised goat came with ricotta gnocchi and was very soupy, but it was one of those dishes where the first bite you're thinking \\"this isn't bad\\" but by the third or fourth bite it's grown on you.  I really enjoyed it, but I think I could skip it on occasion to try other menu items.  Skipping the heirloom tomato salad though...not an option.  It will be ordered Every Single Time. \\n\\nI did not try desserts this visit, but they sounded good.  \\n\\nI will note it is REALLY loud in here.  My throat was sore after dinner from shouting to be heard by my companions.  So I recommend coming here with someone you don't have much to say to but can just make goo-goo eyes at and play footsey.\\n\\nI can't wait to come back though."},{"name":"Salsa & Agave Mexican Grill","address":"1205 Pacific Boulevard","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"I was so glad when Salsa and Agave opened a few years ago because Vancouverites had previously had a decades-long single option for \\"Mexican\\" food, which was a place near 4th and Burrard, a Tex-Mex,sour cream-slathered, cheddar cheese dripping, strawberry margarita cliche.  The Salsa and Agave owners come from an area of Mexico where I lived and they had the wisdom to make their food authentic but not totally, in the sense that it isn't greasy - which is important.  I like their tortas (Mexican subs), Aztec soup, tender tacos de lingua, fresh salsa, delicious tostadas and Jamaica to drink.  The owners work hard, are victims of their own success in that they could use 50% more tables and a less- than- tiny kitchen but they are almost always present and focus on keeping the food consistent. As well the prices are very reasonable.  As for the new Iranian-Mexican place (the former Something Good) down the block, the reason their staff are Spanish speaking is because many of them were poached from Salsa and Agave to be servers and to provide intel.  All's fair in war and the restaurant business, I guess, but that isn't very neighbourly."},{"name":"Turner's Seafood - Salem","address":"43 Church St","city":"Salem","stars":"4.5","text":"Our favorite seafood restaurant ever.

A couple of them received their food before we did, which irritated me.\\n\\nAnyways, we studied the menu and decided on the Tri-tip meal with 1/2 pound a la carte Brisket. The cashier asked how we wanted the Brisket, moist or lean. We chose lean. Apparently lean means dry, so I don't recommend ordering that style.

So, here we are in Portland in 90+ weather and dying but got ourselves here while risking skin cancer with all the UVA/B/C/D rays. Ok, I added a few rays b/c it really was that scorching HOT. \\n\\nBut once you walk in, it's well worth feeling like The Walking Dead from melting in the heat. That wonderful smell of baking waffles is music to my nose. Yes, there was a line but it wasn't too bad. It moved quite quickly actually which surprised me. With all the taste testing I had read about,  I had wondered how they didn't have a 2 hour wait. The secret: they are so smart.  A couple of the workers will ask you while in line which flavors you want to sample and they'll bring it to you while you're waiting so by the time you are at the head of the line to order,  you're pretty much ready to go. SMART! \\n\\nOh, and try I did! I sampled the sea salt ice cream with caramel ribbons, coconut with Petunia's salted caramel bars, olive oil, freckled woodblock chocolate, and the strawberry with cilantro lime cheesecake. Whew..that was fun! \\n\\nWhat stood out for me was the clear winner: the sea salt ice cream with caramel ribbons! That vanilla ice cream was so pure and smooth without being overly sweet like french vanilla.  And the caramel ribbons were still in liquid form so when you lick certain parts of the ice cream and expose the caramel, it will run down the cone. No worries b/c that caramel is not faster than my tongue.  It reminds me of the caramel in the candy bar, caramello. \\n\\nSo, if you're asking yourself if it's worth waiting in line for that ice cream,  I'd say once you've tried this place,  you won't ever ask that question again."},{"name":"El Camino's","address":"3250 Main Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"I've had an overload of Asian eats lately so I wanted to change things up and eat something different.

Here is where you'll find the best that Greater Boston currently offers. To everyone that has no idea what dim sum is - PERFECT.  You must try this.  Dim sum is basically Chinese brunch, most famous in Hong Kong.  You'll find lots of steamed tapa-style (3-5 pieces) dishes here, with a focus on rice flour and dumplings/buns.  Therefore, the taste is fairly light, but don't let that discourage you - some of these dishes can also pack a wallop to your taste buds (spare ribs, I'm lookin' at chu). \\n\\nSo out of all the numerous dim sum places, why this one you say?  First, it's a la carte.  Therefore, FRESH.  First timers, you may be reading this with confusion, as how else would a restaurant serve food?  That's cause a novelty of most dim sum restaurants is bringing out the dishes in carts, and you point the dish you want as they are wheeled around the restaurant.  Definitely a fun experience, but it can cause stale food if the cart has been around the block a couple of times and is more of an annoyance for pro-dimsumers like myself, as I hate waiting and hailing a cart can be as difficult as getting a taxi in NYC.  You don't have these issues here at Winsor.  Second, it's tasty AF.  You know a place is good when it's a tiny hole in the wall, and has been in business for years.  On Sunday, there's a hefty wait, so I would recommend getting there as soon as they open to nab a seat.  Otherwise, wait around -the turnover time for dimsum is fast.  Plus, you'll have the option of being seated faster by sharing a large round table with complete strangers - how's that for table conversation?\\n\\nLastly, the food.  Oh joyous, heavenly shrimp dumplings.  These round bags of joy are my baes.  I get them wherever I can, and I have to say, Winsor does them well.  The rice flour skin is moist, and just the right thickness.  The shrimp filling inside is large, chewy, tasty.  No qualms here.  I recommend most of the other dim sum staples - chicken feet (TRY IT), pork spare ribs, shrimp rice roll (delicious and a must for first timers), pan fried turnip cake (another must) and shu mai (pork and shrimp dumpling).  Those are my go to, and if I feel hungry, I expand and go for some of the fried items (fried shrimp ball, yum!) or other steamed items (Cha Siu Bao AKA Steamed Pork BBQ Bun also hits the spot!).  You can't go wrong with most of these items, so have fun, and explore the different dishes!  They even have a laminated menu with pictures for people unfamiliar with the dish / name, how helpful!"},{"name":"Muscle Maker Grill","address":"358 Broadway","city":"Saugus","stars":"4","text":"Great service & food.

The problem started when the bill came. One bill for all parties. To be fair the waitress said it's their policy not to split a bill. The organizer had been told but it caused a nightmare scenario.

Often times there are some extras; saut√©ed onions, peppers, tomato, the possibilities are endless. Served with the quesadilla at bare minimum is usually some salsa. Better establishments will go so far as to serve you sour cream and guacamole. \\n\\nThen there is the 4 rivers quesadilla which is a tortilla filled with pulled chicken--period. Nothing else, no cheese, no salsa, nothing accompanying it, just nothing. The most barren and unimaginable quesadilla money can buy.

In both my OpenTable reservation and the phone call with this restaurant, I informed them that this dinner was a celebration for my mother in laws retirement and I would appreciate it if they could do something special for her. The woman on the phone informed me that they always read additional messages that come with the reservation and would def do something special. Nothing special ever happened - no acknowledgment from the concierge or our server, no free dessert with a candle, no complimentary drink for her. Thanks for nothing. \\n\\nOur server was also so frazzled and forgetful. We didn't get our bread and butter basket till after we sat down for about 15 minutes. After he provided us with the basket, we had to wait another 5 minutes for him to make an appearance so we could ask for silverware (he didn't even notice there wasn't silverware on the table!!!). He also provided two kiddie cups of water - one for my 3 year old and another for my 2 month old baby. Um, what? My 2 month old can't drink water. This lack of attention is what we received throughout our meal. \\n\\nNow food. What saves this place is the raw bar and lobster bisque. \\n\\nThe raw bar pricing is so cheap compared to boston prices and the fresh taste quality of the oysters (12 for $29) and littleneck and cherrystones (12 for $14) are worth it. I would order this again.\\n\\nWe also got Turner's clam chowder and the award winning lobster bisque. The clam chowder reminds me of Kelly's Roast Beef clam chowder. The lobster bisque reminds me of lobster from Bar Harbor, Maine and brought up fond memories of my vacation there. Order the bisque!\\n\\nMy father in law got the New England Bouillabaisse. He liked the stock. My mother in law got the fried seafood medley, which she said was only okay. She did not finish it. Both my husband and I got the halibut (special). It was underwhelming and not seasoned at all. My toddler got a pasta dish from the kids menu.

Yes, not exactly cheap, but you get quite a hefty amount of serving and quality of food is superb!  Most French food I've tried is usually really rich, but somehow, managed to scarf down the whole entire meal and still had room for dessert.  No reservations taken at the time, given the size of the restaurant, worth the line up, and I quite enjoy the intimate and cramped style!  Service was great, only reason as to why I gave it a 4 instead of 5 is because most 5 stars would require tux-clad servers, leather seats seating with chandeliers and veuve cliquote.

It was a chilly night (by Atlanta standards) and I'd just finished shopping at the Wal-Mart across the street from it.  \\n\\nAt first glance, it's easy to be misled into thinking Mr. Everything, with its logo of a smiling black cook dressed in white holding a full platter of food, is a soul food restaurant.  Also, the name of the place is kind of odd.  Mr. Everything - is this a diner or an urban male revue, lol?  But once you enter and view the menu, you understand why it's named that.  There are sandwiches, healthy dishes, all kinds of meat (from chicken, steak, beef, turkey and lamb), and even a veggie lover's burger on the menu.  There is also some seafood (like tuna, salmon and shrimp).  I saw slices of cake being sold for dessert behind the counter.  \\n\\nMr. Everything resides on MLK Jr. Drive, within a block of the Ashby MARTA transit station, a gunshot's distance away from the Georgia Dome and the new Mercedes Benz Stadium.  The surrounding area is mostly country ghetto with a hint of gentrification the closer you get to the Dome.  In addition to the Wal-Mart being across the street from it, there are other establishments nearby like J.R. Crickets, Johnny M's Pizza, McDonald's, a tattoo parlor, a barbershop named Uppercuts, a beauty supply store named KO, and a small community center on the corner that I believe is (or was) run by the Nation of Islam.  The colleges/universities that make up the Atlanta University Center are the lifeblood of the neighborhood here and many of their students are customers.  On one of the restaurant's flyers, it says students receive 10% off sandwich combos.\\n\\nWith this being my first time eating here, I found the layout to be kind of confusing.  Time I walked in, the woman behind the counter closest to the door loudly, but in a welcoming manner, asked if she could help me.  Since I didn't know what to order, I asked for and received a menu.  The grilled steak yellow rice dish (prepared with onions, mushrooms, broccoli, diced tomatoes, bell peppers, spinach and cheese) looked good to me.  It cost $9.95 plus tax.  I went back to the lady to tell her what I wanted and she instructed me to go to the other end of the counter and place my order with the young woman waiting there.  I did that, but as soon as I tried to hand her the money she told me I had to go back to the other end to make my payment with the lady I previously encountered when I first entered.  After that, came a long, awkward wait for my food, as I stood patiently since the bench they had for a seating area was already filled to capacity.\\n\\nMy order was presented to me with a smile as she opened the container it was in and revealed its contents.  It looked delicious and was more food than I could eat all at once.  I took it home, ate half of it that evening and the rest the next day.  It was good even though the steak wasn't the best I've tasted and there was more cheese on it than I would have liked.  I'm rating Mr. Everything about 3.25 for now but it certainly has potential to easily be a 4.  I plan on eating here again soon and maybe trying out their shrimp dish next time."},{"name":"Mambo Italian Street Food","address":"2022 Powers Ferry Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Cool spot, even better food!

First of all, I don't think tacos are authentic if they aren't corn tortillas. I soon got off of mr bandwagon when I had this one! The flour tortilla was the outer shell and the inner shell was a hard corn tortilla with slices. It was filled with the perfect amount of each ingredient. I can't tell you how great it was! One was enough for me and I'd probably never try another one because I think anything else might disappoint. \\n\\nMy boyfriend ordered two Ooey Gooey tacos. I don't know why he'd do that.

We had the charcuterie board and was impressed with the duck fat candle. Kind of like a luscious butter/oil. I had the pork chop and I really enjoyed it.

When asked about certain dishes she provided the least helpful information. She was extremely forceful with her suggestions and seemed like she had predetermined our meal choices.\\n\\nI think had the service been better I would have said a solid 4 stars perhaps 4 and half even.

When I arrived at 7:25 pm for the 7:30pm, the table wasn't ready yet. To be honest, I expected the table to be ready because I had reserved so early and I wanted to set some things up because my friends arrived. But I ended up waiting around 10-15 min for the table to be ready and my friend who's bday it was had already arrived as well so we both had to wait. Our table's location was nice though. The ambience was very nice. Our waitress was nice as well. We just wished she would have checked up on us a bit more often. I had a couple of friends who needed drink refills and she never came around to ask if we needed anything else so we had to track her down a few times. The food, or my entree which was the chicken carbonara, was very average. I felt like it needed a bit more seasoning and just wasn't that great. I had the parmesan fries as an appetizer and you could tell that half of them were fried in bad oil. You could taste the bad oil on some of those fries and the fries tasted horrible. So that ruined the experience for me. Most of my other friends seemed to enjoy their entrees though.

Aside from that, after growing a thicker skin, the many advantages outweigh the frigid temperature. In fact, there are far too many to list. It's as annoying as Oscar winners listing names of nobodies that I don't care for (just accept the award and get the hell off the stage). \\n\\nOne advantage, however: new restaurants. It's a totally different scene compared to sunny Los Angeles. The cuiscene (get it? cuisine + scene) I've noticed, is either: contemporary New England; or Italian (traditional and/or contemporary). This restaurant I would say is the former. \\n\\nThe Butcher Shop is appropriately and eponymously named. Although it's a restaurant (and a bustling one, too), it's also a butcher shop. Hybrids are so trendy nowadays, aren't they? But what makes it stand out even more, other than the stellar food and service, is that it's a neighborhood butcher shop + restaurant. Alongside the left wall of the narrow and petite dining room are various cuts of meat and sausages suspended deliciously, encased in a glass refrigerator. Animals, specifically animal parts, make for a beautiful hanging. They even have pate (freshly made) and other cocktail party assortments that you can purchase. \\n\\nI tried the plate of pate because next to pork, duck is #1. The well-informed server, who poured me a delicious blend of Spanish reds, brought out a spotless, white, rectangular dish with three different samples of pate. I forget which were what because at that point I had more than enough of the Spanish in me (story of my life, ain't it?). Situated across the three different types of pate were honey and other accompaniments. All I can recall is that the one in the middle was my favorite. I can't say for sure if they still have pate, since I was told that their menu changes frequently, which is exciting to hear (and a hook for me), because I'll be back shortly...if the total didn't come to $1 million. Then again, 6 glasses of wine, the $16 pate, plus the individual dinner platters--sorry, I just can't justify the price. My share alone, excluding tip, was $90. I can be--rather, I am--extravagant and hedonistic, as that is my philosophy in life: To sin is to enjoy the finest and the most pleasurable things in life; therefore, I am a sinner; I don't want to be good. I am, however, outstanding when it comes to not paying my student loans.\\n\\nEnough of this non-sequitur. For dinner, I ordered the braised leg of lamb, which next to pork and then duck is #1, served on a beautiful firm-soft bed of lentils. Before dinner was served, the waitress suggested I change from the Spanish blend to a Syrah. She was expounding a lyrical essay on the tasting notes and the pairing of it with hearty red meat, but I was slammed by the point, so I was just sipping the small drop she let me sample. After she was done, I just smiled crookedly unlike Oliver and said, \\"Please, can I have some more?\\"\\n\\nFor someone who was so pissed by the end of the meal that he got a little lost in South End and headed the wrong way home, he does remember a few details of the night. But I'm a budding fiction writer. I can easily fill in the blank.

I don't like beer. Or so I thought before my first visit to Jester King. \\n\\nLike, I REALLY didn't like beer. In fact, I flat out refused to drink it and I would only begrudgingly go to places that only served beer. \\n\\nBut, I went with a group a friends a while back and the description for Black Metal caught my eye. I like chocolate! I like coffee! I like the homage to KISS on the label! How terrible could it be? I got a sample and was shocked by how delicious it way. So. Fucking. GOOD. I honestly couldn't believe it, so I got a second pour. And a third. And...\\n\\nBlack Metal became my gateway beer -- because I liked this one, I learned what notes I liked and that I prefer darker beers to lighter ones. I started to branch out. I bemoaned the fact that I couldn't buy Black Metal at the grocery store, but I eventually found some substitutes. \\n\\nHonestly, nothing compares to that first taste of Black Metal. And, while I can't say that I love the new sour version of it, I still love Jester King.

Plenty of choices for vegans and vegetarians. I don't eat the meat dishes but they seem to be mostly chicken, so if you're craving other meat besides chicken, you might want to go elsewhere. Lots of good flavorful dishes, well cooked. It's a buffet so service isn't a big factor, but the staff is always friendly. My only complaints are that they often run out of naan - I feel like I have to ask them for more every time I'm there - and the salad bar is very underwhelming.

Themed to be the former mess hall of the RDA in Pandora, Satu'li Canteen somehow integrates well into the theming of the land.  The inside is decorated with \\"Pandoran\\" weaved art which succeed in making this place seem less like a cateferia.  The ordering system is very different from the rest of Disney, and the staff do a good job of directing traffic.  The sum total is this: one of the best counter service restaurants on all of Disney.\\n\\nThere's plenty of familiar but weird stuff on the menu.  The main attraction here are the bowls; you pick a protein (chicken, beef, fish, tofu), a base (quinoa and veggie salad, romaine and kale salad, mixed grains and rice, red and sweet potatoes), a sauce (chimichurri, creamy herb dressing, black bean vinagrette) and then you get veggie slaw.  That's a lot of possible combos, and the good news is that the quality is there!  The beef is cooked to a perfect pink.  The chicken was moist and addictive.  The sauces do a great job of bringing it all together.  It's also a genuinely big portion (fellas/ladies that can eat, pay attention) that's worth the money.  We opted not to try the cheeseburger pods (basically cheeseburger bao) or their vegetable cousins, but we did also try the blueberry cheesecake with passion fruit curd.  You know those stupid raindrop cakes that people put up on Instagram?  These blue things look like that, however they thankfully taste great.  I almost never get dessert at an amusement park, but this is something I will be back for again.\\n\\nDid I mention there is beer/wine/sangria available here too (must-haves on a military base)?

The artichoke was nice and tender.  The cheese stuffing was a little bland.  The appetizer was ok - but did not wow me.\\n\\nFor dinner we had four entrees that we shared.  The Panzanella Primizie was a nice arugula salad with grilled peaches (not butternut squash as the menu posted on their website states), canellini and green beans, and light shavings of parmesan - dressed with a light balsamic viniagrette.  Very good, fresh and light.  I am really picky about salad dressings and use them sparingly - this was perfectly applied, for my taste.  \\n\\nThe Insalata Misto had greens, grilled avocado, and pancetta - it looked as inviting as the Panzanella Primizie but I personally did not have any of it.  Suffice it to say the plate was empty when my friends and I had finished.\\n\\nWe had the Caprini e Balsamico pizza - it was awesome.  Nice thin crust - generous application of goat cheese, greens, and carmelized onions.  Perfectly cooked and delicious.\\n\\nThe fourth entree we tried was the Gnocchi di patata con finferlo e mais.  This was a potato gnocchi sauteed in a brown butter sauce with chanterelle mushrooms and corn.  Very tasty, and still managing to feel \\"light\\" despite the fact that it was gnocchi.

And there is a bakery case at the front of the cafe with all sorts of tempting confections - I thought of bringing an assortment of cookies home for my family - but a single italian wedding cookie was $1.  A decent sized chocolate chip cookie was $1.50.  Too much.  \\n\\nDinner for four with a bottle of wine (plus 3 glasses of wine and a cocktail before dinner) all came to about $160 with tip.

And all for a busy Friday evening.  Even thought I am not a big fan of pizza (hey, don't shoot me!)  it seemed like the logical choice.   I called 2 locations of a certain pizza chain but both told me they didn't take reservations and could only tell me they would be slammed due to a volleyball convention.  I decided to call UNO on a whim and was pleasantly surprised that they were willing to accommodate my request on such short notice! \\n\\nUpon arrival to the restaurant, I checked in at the hostess stand and within minutes we were seated . I was so impressed to see that the table for 11 had already been set up for us and it wasn't the usual scene of frantic servers pushing tables together. \\n\\nFrom that moment on, our entire experience was fantastic. Our server was patient - you have to be with a large party with some taking a little longer to give their entr√©e selections. The menu is a bit overwhelming so I recommend looking at it ahead of time if you are able. And they do have non pizza options so don't be alarmed.   Their signature crust is the Chicago deep dish style but UNO also offers flatbreads and an artisan crust option.  I ordered the individual personal pan pizza in the Chicken Spinach which is one of the newer deep dish creations. It's the perfect size for one person and I still only ate 1/2 the pan.   On a side note, against my better judgment I ordered a side Caesar salad to go with my meal. I expected a small little plate of greens. Their \\"side salads\\" are huuuge! I think it contributed to why I felt so full so quickly. So I would skip that additional charge and go straight for the main meal. \\nThat way you have room for dessert...more specifically the UNO deep dish sundae! You can't go wrong with cookies, ice cream, whipped cream and chocolate syrup!

At this exact moment, it is.\\"\\n\\nhttps://www.bostonglobe.com/lifestyle/food-dining/2018/10/01/the-pop-pizzeria-that-stole-heart/7eCUcqRaxVCuQT6iDdmDXK/story.html\\n\\nWith a recommendation like that, this is a pizza place you HAVE TO TRY, especially since they are closing the pop-up in 6 weeks.\\n\\n[Of course, another restaurant reviewer for the Globe just declared Dragon Pizza in Somerville the best.  Unfortunately, they are both wrong!  But pizza is a personal thing, so make up your own minds, lol.]\\n\\nFirst off, Rab's is in the former Stone Hearth Pizza building.  The glassed in space is spartan, with simple tables and chairs, and a view of the flames in the gas-fired oven.\\n\\nThere is a small parking lot outside, but get there early, since all the praise has made them popular.  We arrived right at 5PM on a cold Saturday evening, and ended up being second to put in our order at the counter.  They gave us a numbered placard to place on our table and the pizza was delivered to us ~20 minutes later.  Half an hour after we got there, the place was full, and by the time we left there were people standing waiting for a table.  Lots of young kids, but well-behaved.\\n\\nAs far as the pizzas, the 3 of us got one large round and one large square (they do offer a small size as well), so we ended up with half leftover (the leftovers crusts stood up pretty well).  To try more toppings, we ordered each pizza half and half:\\n\\nSQUARE ($24):\\n~Pepperoni--red sauce, whole milk mozzarella, Ezzo's pepperoni, Grana Padano, Pecorino Romano\\n~Greens--white pie, with olive oil, garlic, whole milk mozzarella, Maplebrook Farms ricotta, Grana Padano, Pecorino Romano, seasonal greens, chili flake, lemon\\n\\nROUND (~$24):\\n~Mushroom--red sauce, whole milk mozzarella, cremini mushrooms, roasted scallions, sharp provolone\\n~Fall Special #1--roasted local potatoes, poached red onions, sharp provolone, fresh herbs galore, whole milk mozzarella, Pecorino Romano, Grana Padano\\n\\nThe toppings on both pies were excellent, and obviously high quality (they source a lot of things locally, including from Waltham Fields).  I liked the mushroom the best, the flavors really shown through, and then maybe the Special (although I preferred the square's crust).  The tomato sauce was thick and tomatoey, although not particularly acidic or spicy.  But a good sauce.\\n\\nHowever, the crust is really where it's at for Rabottini's.  Both shapes are made from the same long-fermented dough, which is very good.  Style-wise, the square is Sicilian, full of air pockets like a good pan pizza should have when cooked in a very hot oven, and with a nicely crispy pan-fried bottom.   The round is thinner and more of a NY-style pizza, with a crispy bottom and a denser doughy interior like a good NY.  Definitely some serious pizza expertise went into crafting these.\\n\\nHowever, I can't really give Rab's more than 3.5 stars (rounded up to 4 on Yelp).  Why?  Although the crusts could have been outstanding, each suffered from different fundamental flaws.\\n\\nFirst, when you make a Sicilian or pan pizza, a critical step is to lift the dough to remove any air pockets underneath, and also to poke the crust with your fingertips to pop the largest air bubbles in the dough.  If you don't do that, the same thing happens when the hot oven hits that crust: you get massive bubble eruptions that push aside the toppings and result in boring, thin, burnt cavities on the top of the pizza.  Which happened in 2 or 3 places on our square.  Which is why my photos don't look nearly as beautiful as the one in Devra's article.\\n\\nSecond, the round pie's bottom crust was burnt (see photo).  Not burnt as in well done, or even very well done.  Burnt as in so burnt, every bite had a decidedly burnt flavor.  In my mind, this is an unforgivable offense, since you could see them rotating and checking the bottoms of the pies in the oven.  They should never have served this one and just remade it.\\n\\nDon't get me wrong, most pizzas are undercooked in my book, and I really appreciate a pizza with a nice char and some good burnt cheese on top.  But giant bubble eruptions and seriously burnt bottom crusts are never good things.\\n\\nNo alcohol, but they do have cane sugar soft drinks and some other things to drink (pour your own water).  Pity they didn't apply for a Boston BYOB license (legal in Allston), but I'm sure the city hall bureaucracy would have ended up awarding them a license 6 months after they had closed.\\n\\nBut I do recommend you check out Rab's before they close up shop.  Hopefully there is a long-term location in the works, since I would definitely like to try them again."},{"name":"Juice and Jazz Cafe","address":"501B Washington St","city":"Dorchester","stars":"5","text":"Love this place!

Four women were having a heated, and very loud, discussion about some infidelity issues in the group.  The surrounding patrons, the waitstaff, and the management all observed what was going on, but rather than management asking them to refrain from obscenities at high volume, or even please exit the establishment, they let it play out for all to witness.

The tartare was a gorgeous magenta, the beef was of a pleasant consistency, and the horseradish was delicious. It's not overpoweringly spicy when made fresh. The large salt granules sprinkled on the egg yolk were the final detail in a well-planned small plate. Worth the price? Definitely.\\n\\nThis dish was part of the \\"raw/cured\\" section of the menu, which also included tuna, oysters and salmon, around $10-$15 each.\\n\\nWe also ordered oxtail croquettes ($9) off of the specials menu for that evening. These fried balls of ground cowtail mixed in a fluffy stuff sat on a tangy, orange sauce and were scattered with a sprinkle of green onions. While delicious, these croquettes were not worth the price, at $3 each.\\n\\nTopped with fried shallots and freshly chopped herbs, the deviled farm eggs ($5) were both picturesque and delicious, but at the price of $2.50 each, this dish didn't warrant the price tag, in my opinion. The deviled eggs were just one of many in the \\"bar snacks\\" section, along with other scrumptious-sounding munchies like cheddar biscuits and stuffed peppers, ranging between $4-$6 a plate.\\n\\nThe grilled octopus dish ($13) has become a new favorite of mine. The octopus, perfectly cooked, was not overly chewy yet had a pleasant bite. It was mixed with fennel and other greens, drizzled with a slightly creamy vinaigrette, and plated over a creamy hummus-like sauce that tied the whole dish together. The quality of the octopus made this dish well worth the price.\\n\\nOther small plate options from the \\"hot/smalls\\" section included grilled lamb loin, pork empanadas, fish tacos and duck confit.\\n\\nCauliflower is one of my all-time favorite vegetables. Saltyard's version of the veggie was roasted until nicely charred and crispy on some parts, served in a steaming hot cast iron serving dish and topped with a chevre (goat cheese) sauce and green onions. Worth the price? Yes, but call me biased.\\n\\nIn the \\"veggies/salad\\" section, green beans, kale, flash fried brussels and more are offered for $7-$10.\\n\\nOur sixth and final small plate, fresh-made pappardelle pasta ($10), came mixed in a delicious prosciutto-infused cream sauce. The pasta was evidently freshly-made and the mushrooms in the sauce tasted so fresh and flavorful that the small portion just might be worth it.\\n\\nThe menu also offers bruschetta options as well as entr√©e dishes like steak frites and braised pork for the traditional-at-heart, roughly $20 each.\\n\\nI was happy to splurge and pay $30 for my half of the meal.\\n\\nFor one, the service we got from the wait staff was phenomenal. Our waiter, Ruben, bent down to fix the wobbly table for us and came back frequently to refill our drinks and check on our meal. He smiled at us a bunch and helped make us college kids feel pampered for once.\\n\\nThe restaurant got its name Saltyard from the ancient belief that salt was a rare good representing hospitality and friendship, with the potential to create a bond between a host and his guest. This restaurant aims to carry on that belief through its food and service."},{"name":"Swift's Attic","address":"315 Congress Ave, Ste 200","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Great place for dinner.

On the plus side, Hubs thought the  tempura style onion rings were tasty.\\n\\nIt was kind of them to seat us away from others, because it is a loud loud place, and impossible to have a conversation when the dining room is full.

We arrived just after 8 o'clock, which seemed to be perfect timing as it was still busy, but not too crazy.  We were told the wait would be about 45 minutes (which we were expecting, based on other reviews) and were brought to the butcher block waiting area - such a great idea!  I don't know why some people are put off about not being able to wait at the bar - the butcher block has a couple of servers so you can still order drinks and appetizers while you wait. The server there moved very quickly and was knowledgeable about the beers and wines on the menu.  Here comes the good part - we were only there about 10 minutes, and were about to order an appetizer when we were told space opened up a the bar - score!\\n\\nThe server/bartender at the bar was awesome!  She was super friendly and made the place feel almost like a neighborhood pub you could walk into any time and have a drink and a conversation (we were chatting about her awesome earrings - which happen to be made of cow bone - and how they look like Maori Koru).  She was also very knowledgeable about the entire menu, and she didn't try to sell the most expensive things.  She actually told us that there was a half-sized antipasti plate - the regular size is MASSIVE, and she also suggested we share a steak for dinner (at 14 oz for the Ribeye, it was a great suggestion).\\n\\nNow the food.  The soda bread with salted butter and raw honey was unreal - I was about ready to lick the bowl of honey.  The antipasti plate was sooooooooooo good - the Mortadella especially was out of this world. The Ribeye was perfectly seasoned and perfectly cooked (my hubby and I are lucky in that we both like medium).  It was very tender, but there was a tad bit more fat than I would have expected for this place - nothing too crazy, but just a bit.  We ordered the Pommes Gallette - shredded potato baked with cheese and herbs - and that was very disappointing.  They were oversalted and the flavor was just not right - I still can't put my finger on it, but I think the combination of herbs/spices was not right.  Other than that side dish, the food was fantastic.\\n\\nOne thing they are lacking on is desserts.  They only had 2 to offer than night and neither of them really screamed at us to stay and try them (perhaps they do this to keep the people moving since this place is so tiny).

She was sweet, but didn't seem overly prepared on the items on the menu.

The steak and salmon were decent.  \\n\\nWhen the server returned to inquire how the meals were, she was told and was a bit surprised.  She went and notified the Manager who came by our table and explained that what they had ordered are pieces that are cut off the filets because the area of meat is too 'marbled'.  Basically, what they both ordered were the parts that weren't acceptable to serve on the filet.  This was not only shocking to us, but apparently the server who had listened to the Manager's explanation.  As appropriate, the Manager removed both the bad meals and provided deserts to both which was a nice gesture.  Bottom line is the menu item should be removed from the menu or at the least WARN the patrons by using a proper description.\\n\\nWould i return this restaurant?  Yes - the  salad was really good and the salmon was worth a return visit.  Location?  Great.  Wine - nice.  Service was acceptable.

When you go there to eat it is more like you are simply trotting down the street to a friends house where they have already been preparing food for a handful of your neighbors.  There is no huge line, long wait, or the noisy \\"calling of the names\\"  as tables come available.  You find yourself focusing on the real reason why we like to go eat out. To spend time with people you presumably enjoy, while eating food  that is likely better then what you could make at home. Oh, and the back patio is great!  Now to talk about the food. They actually do quite a good job, I ordered the smoked salmon breakfast pizza, and my girlfriend decided that she would try the breakfast sandwich, both were hot fresh and properly prepared.

I think that's fine. At least I know they're not overloading their food with salt. Their sodium level isn't not ridiculously high like the other places. \\n\\nSo I'm becoming a fan of Moe's again. I now rank Moe's #2 behind Chipotle. Willy's and their soggy burritos falls to #3.

I understand is a Chinese restaurant which implies a different culture. I have been to other Chinese places and the workers tend to be quiet, polite, and respectful. Yesterday, my friend and I visit this place and before we went in my friend told me since is a small place the restaurant tends to seat people together. I told her that I did not mind at all, so we sat at a big table and a few moments later a family of 6 sat in our table. The family took my chopsticks so all I said to my friend since she is a native Mandarin speaker, can you please ask for another set of the chopstick. She called this old and bald man and ask for a set chopstick. He came with a plate, a cup for tea, and a chopstick. I guess he did not understand what my friend said, and my friend quickly told him, I just wanted the chopstick. All I saw, since I did not understand anything, the old man throwing the plate in an aggressive manner into the table that hit my tea and it spills half of it on my plate. He looked at us so angry and left. I ask my friend what was the problem, she told me, he thought we wanted to seat another person but I told him I was only asking for the chopsticks. That is why he got mad and threw the plate. I took my napkins and started to clean what he spilled on my plate and on the table. He never came back to our table again to either clean or apologize. We had already ordered the food and me being the person that I am lol so chill. I did nothing because I knew my friend immediately tried to change the topic so I could feel better and not bother. Of course, in front of her, I acted like I did not mind but inside my head, I was thinking to either leave the restaurant or complain. But, both of my ideas were too dramatic hehe. Of course, if I was a person with more attitude, I would of speak up immediately. But, I did not let this issue be the reason to not taste the food. The food was good and cheap.

Their overall ambiance is a southern kitchen feel, laid back yet trendy with light colors, low tops and benches in the dining room and high tops and a long bar in a separate area.   They also have a giant chalkboard on one wall which lists the farms that all the produce and meats they use come from.  Just on a side note they have complimentary valet parking (I'm not sure if this is running all the time but it is on Sunday Mornings) and you can make reservations which I definitely recommend on the weekend, unless you are fine with the bar area which is open seating.  \\n\\nSomething super awesome about C & L is that they brew a variety of their own beers in house!  The brewery room has a table which seats 6-10 and can be reserved by anyone with a credit card.  Instead of being closed off from the restaurant though the top half of the wall is a window so you still get to see what's going on.  My friend reserved this room for his birthday brunch and it was a very special experience.  The party before us ran a little long, so we were let in 30 minutes after our reservation time.  Although we didn't mind, the staff was very apologetic and provided us with two bakery boards on the house!! We were pleasantly surprised with this as we got to try some desserts we wouldn't have otherwise.  The baker's board is PURE DECADENCE and featured monkey bread, macaroons, fried chocolate dough balls and crumb cake that week (I'm not sure how often they change it).  Our service in this room was wonderful, I never felt forgotten even though we were separate and it was much quieter then in the main dining room.  Also, I didn't notice any extra noise or heat from the brewery setup.  The service I received at a table in the main dining room was just as attentive.  I was with my grandparents who asked the waitress everything from \\"what is creme fraiche?\\" to \\"does the brioche have seeds on top?\\" and she answered each one with a smile and patience.  \\n\\nI cannot say enough about how delicious their food is, flavors burst from each dish, which isn't surprising since the power couple who runs C & L also own Ravenous Pig.  Here is a rundown of what I tried-\\nFixin's:\\n-Biscuits and gravy: 4 mini dense biscuits with a very rich and deep flavored white sausage gravy\\n-Potted pimento cheese:  a heaping pile of collard green infused toast with a mason jar filled with silky cheese and \\"ham jam\\" which are sweet, cooked down ham crumbles\\n-Smoked sausage: cooked in a deliciously sweet maple bourbon glaze! my boyfriend and I fought over this one\\n\\nBrunch:\\n-Catfish sandwich:  super light and VERY juicy sandwich, the breading on the fish is perfection and the sides of Brussels sprouts would make anyone want to eat their vegetables.\\n-Chicken biscuit: this is the only dish I wasn't happy with, the combination of Alabama BBQ and pickled peppers was too sweet for my liking.\\n-Chicken and waffles: soooo delicious! This is served with giant pieces of chicken and waffles so be prepared to take some home or share with the table.  The smoked honey sauce is finger licking good and the chicken was very juicy.\\n-Shrimp and sausage: I was very impressed with this dish which reminded me of jambalaya, I would describe it as smoky and flavorful but it could have been a little spicier for my taste.  The shrimp fell apart in my mouth and I enjoyed the added crunch from the handful of crisps placed on top.  It also comes with a coddled egg which rounded out the flavors nicely.\\n\\nLast but not least, don't forget to order a cocktail! Besides an assortment of brewed beers they offer some delicious handmade cocktails, my favorite being the Sunday  morning coming down which was tangy and refreshing thanks to the grapefruit bitters.  If they are offering the cask and larder golden ale and lineage coffee brew, I definitely recommend a glass of that! It had a very rich coffee taste which I feel most of those blends are usually lacking.\\n\\nAs you can see I love this place and can't wait to go back to try some of their dinner and happy hour items!"},{"name":"The North End at 4580","address":"4580 Broadway St, Ste D-1","city":"Boulder","stars":"4","text":"Nice atmosphere and friendly service.\\nWe shared small plates that were mostly good.

I love spices, and the paprika gave the sauce a pretty red/orangy color, but the paprika flavor was way overpowering, to a point that I could not eat it (paprika has a funny taste if eaten by itself, and I felt I was having pure paprika in my plate.)\\nThe drinks were good and we had a pleasant evening, except....Please, please don't bring us the check without asking if we want a dessert!!!!! Our waiter was very nice and attentive, but brought the check assuming we did not want any desserts without asking.  This happens too often in restaurants and I will never understand it.

Lucky for us 4 people from high tops did leave and we were able to be seated. After we were seated, we had another manager/server come to our table and apologize for the confusion/the wait and bring us appetizers on the house, I am not really sure why he was apologizing to be honest. But yes, this restaurant gets busy so make reservations before hand. \\n\\nThe bayou tacos and the red neck nachos, according to our waiter, are the most popular appetizers. The bayou tacos are a must! The nachos, I wasn't as big of a fan of because I don't like pork grinds or gritz so I'm biased but my group of three boys loved it. \\n\\nThe fried chicken and waffles were so delicious and lived up to their hype. The fried chicken is one of the best I've tried in the Boston area. If you're looking for something else not fried, the bourboned brined chicken was so juicy.

I've read mixed reviews about the ribs but these were hot and smothered in delicious sauce and I'd easily order this as my own main dish. \\n\\nTheir bourbon cocktails were yum! My group shared the Southern Ice Tea that comes in giant mason jar for 4 people. It has the flavor of bourbon + sweet tea without ANY burn. We also tried the raspberry lemonade mason jar to share - it's sweeter and not my favorite, but I can see it being really refreshing on a hot day.

You will be ruined afterwards, because nothing will quite measure up to the food here! On this trip, I shared both the calamari and baked eggplant (on the specials menu) with my brother and cousin. The calamari doesn't come with any marinara, nor does it need it. Top if off with a squeeze from the fresh lemon provided and you are good to go. The eggplant is layered with a delicious pesto sauce, tomato, melted mozzarella, and is perfectly cooked. I tried to go with something different as my main entree and failed. The pasta al forno is my weakness. It is a huge dish of baked rigatoni noodles with a delicious tomato sauce, mozzarella, and meatballs. My brother got the bolognese with the fusili noodles, and it was amazing as well! My cousin got the veal parmiagiana with two huge servings of veal and an entire plate of fusili noodles to mix in.

We sat at the bar, where, if I were a few inches taller, I would have been able to see the cooks busily preparing the dishes that emitted delectable aromas around the cozy restaurant. \\n\\nWe got the dates wrapped in bacon-- oh my goodness, just get them. Don't look at the price first-- just get them. As in, more than one. They are absolutely amazing-- sticky, sweet, rich, bacony, and oh the perfect starter. \\n\\nWe should have ordered more of those dates.\\n\\nWe also opted to share a few plates so that we could each sample the abundance of goodness that is Tasty N Sons. The grilled quail with cous cous was yummy-- quail was cooked perfectly and was tender and juicy. The cous cous and sausage was okay. The pork shank adobo with pickled vegetables was also cooked perfectly with meat that pulled easily from the shank bone and pickles that cut through the richness of the pork. The only disappointing dish of the night was the spaghettini cabonara-- I'd never had cabonara before and was really looking forward to trying it with the house guanciale-- but it was really salty. Tasty, but salty. Boo.\\n\\nWe finished the evening with chocolate potato doughnut with cr√®me anglaise -- and they were so so so delicious!! Warm, chocolatey, and not too sweet. The cream anglaise paired well with them. Yum!! I want another one now! \\n\\nOf course, we got our drink on. Well, kind of. I like bubbles and he likes beer. So he had his beer and I had a couple of cocktails. The ginger lime rickey appears to be a customer favorite and it was light, refreshing, and tasty. I really liked it a lot.  I tried an Golden Apple Delicious drink and it was way too alcohol-y. They were nice enough to let me exchange it for something else-- and I opted for the Apricot Fizz. It was delicious- not too sweet and served in old school champagne glasses with a little garnish of lemon peel. Lots of fun and yummy.\\n\\nOverall, a night with lots of food and not enough space in my stomach.

The sides were spot on, I tried the Apple Fennel Coleslaw and black beans, others had corn and French Fries -- everyone was pleased with their side dishes. My wife took 1/4+ rack plus of ribs home because there was no way she was going to finish that huge 1/2 rack. Our meal choices didn't include a coconut pineapple roll, but our waiter was kind enough to bring one to sample and we all agreed it was very good.

The salsa tastes fresh and has just enough spice. This would be a great start to any meal, but my suggestion is to also order the queso. The version with the beef, guacamole and pick de gallo is best, but I've been with a couple of vegetarians and they can do a vegetarian version if you ask and it is still very good. \\n\\nI love the Tortilla Soup here and it comes as a giant bowl which could serve as a meal.

Great vibes, music was upbeat, staff was amazing! I love the local Atlanta flare on the menu as this is a locally owned place they have cool titles of things like, let's go to MJQ, and we don't call it HOTLANTA anymore. The drinks were amazing aka strong and like Bartaco, they don't use any pre-mixed ingredients make all of their mixes and items from scratch. My favorite food item is their bowl. The taco selection is different every night the owner said, we had the Barbacoa, the chicken, and the poblano pepper tacos. It's nice they give you an option of corn or flour tortilla. I do wish that they had some sauces out so if you had a chicken taco and you wanted it to be a bit more juicy o could add something. But I was able to ask for a side of the sauce on the other taco and without any problem got a side to dip. The guacamole comes in three different sizes and the smallest plenty for two people. I also loved that they have local artwork that changes every month on their walls. Saw some super inspirational things and got to check out some new artists as an added bonus. Definitely worth A walk down the beltline, because there's no parking so get those walking shoes out and stroll down have a seat at the bar maybe even grab some kombucha from the kombucha spout while you're there. We will definitely be back! And we look forward to how this plays continues to go get even better after they have been open a few more months.

I had the cold brew again because I wanted an iced cold drink that had a lot of caffeine in it. We also shared a lavender lemon tart which looked so pretty with the dollops of lavender meringue and marshmallow meringue on top.

My bf loved it so much that he was tempted to order another one but he knew he shouldn't. \\n\\nOverall, my bf and I really enjoyed this cafe.

First, it's an amazing value. If you get a medium or large pizza, you can get unlimited toppings, and they have daily specials. Their prices are fantastic, and tax is included, so you know exactly what you're paying. The crew is also attentive and super nice. Everyone is always so sweet and they seem genuinely happy to help. They apparently have some sort of CRM system, too, because they request your number when you call and ask if you'd like to reorder your most recent purchase, which I thought was a nice touch, and pretty convenient. Most importantly, the pizza and wings are really good. I prefer New York style pizza, and this is the closest I've found in Orlando so far. Also, do yourself a favor and try their ranch Cajun wings.

And listen, it takes quite a bit to impress me when it comes to food, service and ambiance. This place had all of that. From the moment I walked in the staff was super welcoming. The bar had quite a few people already around it and there was 1 bartender but girlie was rockin the orders and still had time to wait patiently for my indecisive tail to make a decision and she didn't bat an eye when I changed my drink order about 3 times. And she kept the drinks coming without anyone asking her or trying to get her attention(yes, I sat back and just watched her work, looking for that slip up, but she never made one).. when we sat down to eat the food and drinks flowed effortlessly and timely. The food was awesome and I wasn't sure I was going to eat any of it because I'm picky AF and the descriptions were a no but when the food came out they were nothing of what I was thinking the description met!! Everyone enjoyed their food immensely.  We had the steak with garlic mashed potatoes (I think, don't quote me on that one), jumbo scallops over potato salad (and the scallops were huge and the potato salad is not your backyard potluck typa salad it was like some roasted potatoes with mushrooms and maybe roasted garlic, idk)and chicken with grits(them grits are to remember). Our 3 different meals to choose from. The views from this restaurant were absolutely beautiful. The staff was well trained and super efficient.  Now we didn't pay for our meals because we were taken there by some clients so I don't know the costs of everything but it is more than worth my money to go back. I will be going back.

It's NOT a traditional Japanese restaurant, in fact I never spotted a Japanese person anywhere on the premises, so IF that's what one is looking for, avoid.\\n\\nIF however, you want a good meal 'in the style', GINZA is slightly better than average for this part of the world.\\n\\nMy dining companions opted for the colourful rolls with fancy names. I tasted a bit of everything, but MY order was SASHIMI, the DX plate @ 20 bucks, allegedly a deluxe selection, chef's choice.\\n\\nI'M TRADITIONALIST in the sense that I wish to TASTE the fresh fish, uncluttered by too much else.\\nGinza's colourful rolls have lots of mayo like stuff, sweetish sauces, and chili peppers etc. NOT my thing, so I 'stick with my knitting'.\\n\\nSashimi DX (stands for deluxe, I was informed) selection had some good moments, and the tuna was fresh and tasty, generous amount, ditto salmon. Tiny serve of razor clam ok, tako (octopus) very average, HUGE amount of shredded daikon radish dwarfed everything else, a few salad leaves, no wasabi? wassup?\\n\\nNo uni (sea urchin eggs) in the restaurant. period.\\n(Too tuff to stock, said the spokesman)\\n\\nIn a general sense, the sashimi dish was fine / fresh / enjoyable, but hardly 'deluxe'.\\nPrice point of 20 bucks = nothing to complain about, just not 'special'.\\n\\nGluten free soya sauce at extra cost, and a wasabi with pickled ginger dutifully arrived later, as did warm green tea.\\n\\nMy companions ordered a cold sake which was 'industrial' quality.\\nThey enjoyed their colourful roll selections, and I sampled at least one of everything.\\nNothing to write home about imho.... but better than average in this local market.....\\n\\nService:\\n\\nReally good making reservation, answered telephone promptly, seated quickly upon arrival & bypassed the queue at door.\\n\\nFriendly and chatty table server, we got an UNSOLICITED apology (we said nada, old friends enjoying our time together as we waited) for slowness in serving the food, and an offer of miso soup 'on the house', AFTER food was consumed.\\nSo, management KNOW they have an issue there, but it never concerned us.\\nPromptly seated spot on 730pm for reservation of 730pm, though no food / drink for 45 minutes.\\n\\nDear management:\\n\\nIF u r running slow with food, suggest serve DRINKs quickly?\\n(we had an empty table for 45 mins+)\\nIf u r REALLY concerned, put out complimentary nibbles or snacky things, but why wait 90 minutes into proceedings to bring up the 'subject'?\\n\\nOffering an item we didn't order, don't particularly want,\\n(and for good reason because it wasn't particularly good, and I didn't consume after tasting) = strange daze in Poco town.\\n\\nConclusion:\\n\\nClean tidy venue, friendly service, sushi 'nouveau' formula with a nod to the traditional, a Japanese 'style' food experience which seems to be popular with the locals.\\nValue fair.\\nQuality good, not astounding.\\nMy assessment is 3.6 stars rounded up to 4 on this forum."},{"name":"Mambo Italian Street Food","address":"2022 Powers Ferry Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Mambo Italian Street Food has an extensive menu. They have sandwiches, pastas, calzones, pizzas, salads, entrees, etc. Their drink menu is big as well.\\n\\nThe place is huge. It's so big, they actually have 2 entrances. Their main entrance is on the Windy Ridge Parkway side. \\n\\nInside, you can see some of the wood fire ovens in the back, where they bake their breads. It looks like a place where you can invite a big group to have a wild Italian meal. They also have events and specials on some nights.\\n\\nLet's get to the food. One thing I noticed was that the bread they use for the sandwiches, the appetizers, etc. is the same bread they use on the pizza (and probably their calzones). \\n\\nI guess they just make the same dough and use it for everything. They have a wood fire oven and the dough, why not kill multiple birds with one stone? \\n\\nI think the bread is fine for the sandwiches and for the entrees. However, they are not right for the pizza. I expect pizza crusts to be lighter and have some spring But I think it's too bready, thick, and dense for an Italian pizza. \\n\\nI tried their Sant' Angelo. It came with italian sausage, caramelized cipollini onion, dolce piquante pepper, garlic, and mozzarella. I thought the toppings were fine. But once again, I couldn't get over the crust. It was more of an American style pizza (Not NY style, but more Papa Johns Style) than Italian style\\n\\nTheir Gnocchi tasted better. The Gnocchi themselves was slightly dense, but I thought it tasted fine. The tomato cream sauce and a good amount of tang and sweetness. I also liked the fresh tomatoes on it.\\n\\nTheir sandwiches, as I wrote before, uses the same bread as the pizza. Since it is so dense and bready, it worked well with the sandwiches. I tried a bit of the Vitello. The Vitello is supposed to have \\"Crumbled Veal.\\" What is crumbled veal? I think it's veal with breadcrumbs. The veal reminded me of a schnitzel. It was flat and fried. I thought it was a decent sandwich. \\n\\nThe Meatball Appetizer came with 3 big meatballs and more of the pizza bread baked in the oven. It also came with a ton of tomato sauce. I liked the meatballs. And I liked soaking the bread int the sauce. It was good. It was huge too. I think it could be a meal by itself. \\n\\nThe service is slow. Since they're new, I think they're working out the kinks. Everyone seemed nice. I think they're understaffed. \\n\\nThe food is fine. I would avoid the pizza here unless you really want the pizza. I would stick with their sandwiches or their pasta.

They have loads of FREE parking all throughout the strip mall.\\n\\nOnce inside you'll realize this Nando's doesn't look like the others. This particular location has been remodelled to have a more modern look to it. Also, just a heads up, if you've never been to a Nando's before you'll realize you have to order up at the front counter. Wether you're dining-in or taking-out you have to order up at the counter, so grab yourself a menu, give it a little gander, Nando's has plenty of options to suit everyones dining needs.\\n\\nOn this visit I ordered the Full Pack that comes with a whole chicken, normally I get the chicken cut up into 8 separate pieces so it's a little easier to share but I forgot to this time. The Full Pack also comes with 2 Nando's Size side-dishes, I chose the Spiced Rice and the PERi-PERi Vegetables. They also throw in 3 Portuguese buns OR garlic bread, but I always just end up choosing the garlic bread because its so good. Since I was dining-in this time I added a soft drink to my order because they have a touchscreen Coca-Cola Freestyle machine where you can customize your drink with tons of different flavours, very cool.\\n\\nI can't find the words to describe the chicken at Nando's. It's literally the best chicken on planet earth. The PERi-PERi hot sauce is tangy spicy and compliments the flame grilled chicken so well. I love the PERi-PERi hot sauce so much that I buy my own bottles of it to take home with me for when I have Nando's leftovers. I started eating Nando's less than 2 years ago and I'm distraught that I didn't know about it sooner.\\n\\nThere are no words to describe my love for butterfly-cut, flame-grilled, PERi-PERi chicken. Once you try it I guarantee you won't be able to eat chicken from another restaurant again. \\n\\nI'd like to take this time to warn all the Nando's Newbies out there about the dangerous side effects of PERi-PERi chicken... It is highly addictive. Don't become a Nando's addict.\\n\\nUsually at the end of my reviews I say something like \\"I'll definitely return\\" but I think that goes without saying this time."},{"name":"Chicken Guy!","address":"1506 E Buena Vista Dr, Ste A","city":"Lake Buena Vista","stars":"3.5","text":"Chicken guy what can I say out of control chicken sandwiches big bite super good southwestern salad wow if you get anything you also have to try the chicken tenders chipotle ranch sauce is super delicious The Nashville hot really good I've tried about six or seven sauces they all have awesome flavor can't wait to go back"},{"name":"The Rambler","address":"4205 N Mississippi Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Beautifully decored, unfortunately the waiters at the restaurant were unequivocally racist towards all minorities.
