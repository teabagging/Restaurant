You wouldn't really guess that it is that busy considering it looks like it's closed from the outside. The servers are kind of running all over the place - seating whoever they can and serving whoever they can. It's understandable when you're trying to run a small establishment and having such a high influx of guests coming in. \\n\\nI ordered the Massaman Curry (chidken) and my boyfriend ordered the Spicy Basil Duck. Both very delicious and reasonably priced. I'm not a fan of duck, but the crisp way it is cooked gives it tons of flavor, paired perfectly with peppers and onions. Though I felt that the food to rice ratio wasn't equal. Maybe it's just my inner Asian culture speaking out - since we eat rice with everything! I do like the table side chili powder, crushed peanuts, and spicy chili sauce that you can personally add to whatever you order. \\n\\nMy only downside to this place - which is why I didn't give it a full 5 stars is the service. While they are doing their best to deliver the best food and try to accommodate every seated customer - it does stray away from the \\"your server serves your table\\" aspect.

A huge mistake on my behalf for selecting this place to show my buddy some good Bostonian fare, but this place was an absolute train wreck and I will NEVER go back.  First, on Sunday's their brunch format is a communal style, you seat yourself, you order from a location at the bar then they bring you your food and drinks (that's the extent of the service you can expect during this format).  When your ordering, you feel rushed and under the gun since there's 10 people behind you that are also presumably hungry and waiting in a long line, horrible start to a relaxing brunch.  Second, when I dine out and spend the amount of money I spent at this place, I want an experience.  The order taker offered me absolutely nothing pertaining to menu feedback or even a small degree of personality.  I asked about the steamers not being on the brunch menu, oh we don't do that for our brunch \\"service\\" - if that's what you want to call it.  This place doesn't even have a liquor license to serve the classic brunch staple, a bloody mary, which I guess isn't their fault since they obviously don't have the proper licensure, but what a letdown.  Then we sit down, the drinks take forever, no one offers any assistance or even checks up or even smiles/makes eye contact with the customers.  We order a bunch of raw oysters and my girlfriend really likes crackers with these so we asked the server if we could get some, she looked at us and said \\"sorry not during brunch\\" - uhhh, what?  I didn't even know what to say to that reply.  They didn't even bring share plates for us with the 15+ oysters for 3, just the metal pan.  The lobster roll sucked, 90% bread, 10% lobster and it wasn't even hot or accompanied with a buttery coating like it proclaimed on the menu.  The clam chowder honestly tasted like it was from a can, the potatoes were hard and it just lacked the overall creamy texture/tone that this soup should always have, especially in Boston.  Lastly, the shrimp arepa was hardly an arepa at all and I feel fairly qualified to make that accusation since I just returned from South America - this thing was so doughy and cold-centered, so far from the traditional style it's embarrassing.  To top it all off, everything was served to us on paper plates and bowls.  I found a funny article online titled \\"Row 34 Debuts Casual Sunday Brunch April 3 - Boston Magazine\\".

Two of us got the bison ribs and beef brisket. Others just got brisket. The bison ribs were really good. Not as tender as pork ribs. The brisket was just tender enough without being too fatty. I don't care for cole slaw or pickles, but my friends really liked them. I liked the potatoes and didn't like the refried beans.

However, despite the Groupon, I felt the food was similar to its compatriots in North End and just a bit more expensive than what I'm used to. I came here with a college friend, hoping to take advantage of the Groupon deal...however, after looking at the dinner prices, we still felt obligated ordering the cheapest pasta entrees as the meat dishes ranged in the upper $30-$40. The scallop appetizer with the buttered potatoes were amazing ($17 was a bit pricy), and I was very pleased with how the sweat savory potatoes blended so well with the lightly salted scallop behemoths. My friend ordered the gnocchi dish, which was extremely tasty, but my cheese-blended pasta dish was a bit too much on the al dente side and a little salty for my untrained taste buds.\\n\\nFor those who may have read my previous review, it dawned on me that I may have been a bit more harsh on this restaurant than I had anticipated.

Giacomo's is all that. \\n\\nAfter living in Boston the better part of forever, I finally got to the North End location last night with some friends visiting from the Midwest. The wait for a table of 5 was something along the lines of 45-60 minutes, but we had expected that. \\n\\nWe got the two appetizers people rave about: a large order of calamari and an order of broccoli in garlic butter. They were stellar. The broccoli was fresh, al dente, and the sauce was sublime. The calamari was light, meltingly tender, crunchy and just outrageously delicious. \\n\\nFor entrees, we had four entrees. One was the pumpkin ravioli with mascarpone sauce that everybody raves about. A friend put one of those suckers in his mouth and just had to close his eyes and tilt his head back in bliss. You too will be whisked into another intergalactic dimension-cum-nirvana of yumminess if you order it. I had to slap the wait staff's hands so I could lick the plate clean before they took the dish away. \\n\\nWe also got the eggplant parmiagana. Now, this is the right way to cook eggplant: You get a deli meat slicer and you shave ultra-thin slices of eggplant so that the layers in this dish are distinct and light, as opposed to the globby blob wonders that come out of some kitchens, with eggplant slabs in a congested confusion of tomato sauce and cheese. What I'm saying is that Giacomo's does it right, does it perfect. \\n\\nFor the other entrees, we got two dishes of pasta: one had mussels and shrimps with Giacomo's sauce, which we think was some type of pleasant, light tomato with perhaps a touch of cream sauce. It was nice, but not eye-rolly nice. The final entree was fettucini with tuna and swordfish chunks in a pesto cream sauce. The pesto cream sauce was delicious, but the fish chunks were meager. I think next time I'd just order the swordfish steak. \\n\\nWe got two bottles of Sangiovese off a delightfully affordable wine list that had a good selection of serviceable wine for $17/bottle. They do have reserve wines for the deep-pocketed, but the Sangiovese suited us just fine. \\n\\nIt's crowded, it's homey, the chalkboard has the menu handwritten (but it's the same menu as the paper menu, so no need to squint or sit close to it), the service was brisk and competent, we got stuffed. We thanked our lucky stars that we hadn't fallen prey to our starving-artist cheap-ass impulses. We could have gotten a Groupon or Yelp deal to Davide, or another one to some other North End restaurant with a ton of mediocre reviews, but we said screw it, let's go get some food we know we'll love. \\n\\nAfter all, Giacomo's prices are absolutely reasonable, particularly given that it's in the touristy North End, and particularly given the quality of the food. For a party of 5, we paid $137, which included an 18% gratuity and two bottles of wine. \\n\\nGo, by all means. Don't compromise your dinner out in the North End by being in a rush or wanting to save a few bucks with a coupon to an inferior restaurant.. Be prepared for a long wait.

Langbaan also received nods in 2015 from James Beard Foundation (semifinalist Best New Restaurant) and GQ magazine (2nd place Most Outstanding Restaurant list).\\n\\nYou enter Langbaan by going into Paa Dee, making your way to the restroom but make a sudden u-turn and approach what appears to be a bookcase and pull on the large handle to enter. The menu selection here is a fixed tasting menu with innovative cocktails and matched wine pairing available from Paa Dee's excellent mixologist. The service was good with each dish was presented and explained individually at your table. It is noted that the service is table specific so you only got your next course when you were finished with the current course vs whole room getting the same course at the same time. There are also only 2 seating's each night and due to their size and concept, don't expect vegan or gluten free options.\\n\\nThe fixed menu is a parade of courses that consist of one-bite flavor wonders. On our night, we were privileged to actually sample a new menu and approach that was the result of Langbaan being closed for 5 weeks as they explored Thailand for new inspiration - and they found it. The menu was divided up into 3 snacks, a soup, 2 appetizers, 4 dishes that make up the 'main', and 2 desserts. We started off with very creative and wonderful cocktails and opted for the wine pairing. Note that the wine pairing was very well done and perfectly complemented the Thai cuisine. Our menu included: \\n\\nSnacks: marinated shrimp with pomelo, chili, lime and ginger wrapped in a betel leaf; scallop in coconut cream with lemongrass, and galangal in a crispy rice cup; and Phuket style rice noodle stuffed with ankimo, dried shrimp, shiitake mushroom, port, sprout, omelet, garlic and soy vinaigrette.\\nSoup: savory clam in coconut broth, Romanesco, matsutake mushroom, sawtooth, and shallot.\\n\\nAppetizer: soy cured wagyu zabuton, groundwork carrot, braeburn apple, dried squid, mint, shrimp powder; kanpachi, mandarin orange, delicate squash, pomegranate, sunchoke, zucchini, pine nut.\\n\\nMain: Dungeness crab curry with cha-om, pineapple, betel leaf, kaffir line; turmeric fried squid with tentacle and smelt; Chef Ann's (Ruaysuntia) salted duck egg relish with prawn, fresh greens; Jasmine rice.\\n\\nDessert: cassava, job's ear; pineapple, black bean in coconut borth, jasmine ice; pan fried roti, local spicy honey.\\n\\nOverall the majority of the dishes were mild with only the last 'main' dishes considered 'spicy' for those sensitive to chili heat (as my dining companion). Out favorites for the evening were scallop in coconut cream, savory clam in coconut broth, soycured wagyu zabuton, kanpachi with orange, and Dungeness crab curry (spicy), and the cassava and job's tear and pineapple in coconut broth.\\n\\nThis is not a budget outing as total damage, including tasting menu, cocktails, wine pairing, and after diner scotch was $125/person (expensive by PDX standards).\\n\\nSo if you are in PDX and enjoy a fine dining Thai experience, you will be competing with us for any open seats going forward.

The inside is cramped and noisy which I don't mind but what we didn't like was being seated basically on top of the kitchen. At the bar area i guess they found a little space and were like, oh we can definitely squeeze two seats in there. I get that it's busy and popular but it kind of ruined the experience. I mean we were literally two feet from the kitchen in a corner, the waiters were packing leftovers 20 inches from my boyfriend and I could hear the guy scrub the kitchen two feet from me. If even the waitress feels bad that you're sitting there, probably shouldn't make it a \\"table\\". I wish we had said we wouldn't mind waiting longer for a real seat.\\n\\nThe food itself was okay. I got chicken Marsala, nothing outstanding. My boyfriend got some fettuccini with chicken and pepper dish that was yummy.

It was the most horrible food ever. First the sides were not edible. The beans should be banned, the potato salad was just potatoes with bits of onion and seasonings, and the coleslaw was a joke. Not one person at my table touched the sides. But here is the kicker. Our food was cold. COLD!!!!!! Can you believe it? Fresh BBQ? COLD???? The cold sausage was just regular old sausage from the grocery store, nothing special. The COLD brisket was dry as bone and flavorless and the one cold rib that came with the plate was tolerable but nothing special. If I lived across the street from this place, I would never go. I would not take anyone to this place and am seriously going to question man vs food for now on. Don't waste your money. Cooked over fire but can't taste a thing.

Also the breakfast potatoes were kinda flavorless and undercooked. Also, no REAL maple syrup at this place people :( , but they did make it up by having packets of Mrs. Butterworth's (the entertainment in impersonating Mrs. Butterworth almost made up for lack of real maple syrup). \\n\\nOverall, a fun little diner, and of course wayyyyy better then a Denny's or I hop, but as far as fancy Eggs Benedicts is concerned I like Keke's or First Watch.

Half lobster and seafood pasta special was good but I must agree with some other reviews that the sauce was not particularly flavorful. I got the half fra diavolo and half giacomo sauce. Not much depth of flavor. Lobster was cooked just enough and not cremated like some places. My daughter raved about the swordfish. Now to the chief concern: the tuna was rotten. My wife got the homemade pasta with a creamy pesto sauce and chunks of tuna and swordfish I think. She picked at it while we ate and eventually said she was full. At the end of the meal I tried a bite and the fish was past its prime: spoiled. I told the server and she was apologetic and immediately took it off the bill, but the more I think about this the more angry it makes me.

The server advised up front that their chef usually prepares the salmon medium rare so I decided to give it a try. When I dug into it, it was basically seared on the outside and pink inside. I took a few bites and the fishy smell was unbearable. The server came by and I asked her to cook the salmon more. She happily accommodated. Once returned, it was still pink inside but now it added an oozing fish oil in the form of gel. I've only had salmon either completely raw as sushi or completely cooked all the way. \\n\\nI could not get myself to eat it. The server saw that I was not touching my dish and asked if it was still too raw for my taste. I told her its fine and I will just eat around it. She volunteered to take it back to the chef again but the original salmon was all broken up at this point being on the grill twice already that she stated that the chef may just cook another salmon. I felt bad about this but since they volunteered, I thought why not?\\n\\nA few minutes later, a manager came over to inform me that chef was going to prepare a brand new salmon and that although the chef likes to prepare the salmon medium rare, there had been people like me who prefer fully cooked salmon. I guess I was not the only one who disliked partially cooked fish. I got a whole new plate of the salmon dish that was fully cooked to my liking. And to my surprise, they took 50% off the dish on the tab. \\n\\nI applaud the restaurant for their accommodation and going out of their way to please a customer. What could have been my first and only visit, this is an excellent example of restaurants that do it right where well trained employees work together in making one's restaurant experience from potential negative to a positive experience. \\n\\nI will definitely go back next time and try other dishes.

The lamb is braised to the point where it falls apart.  As tender as it is, it kind of blends into the thick nut/butter curry-ish sauce.  The carrots and sweet potatoes make the stew a little sweet, which works nicely with how spicy the thing is.  This is a lot of food, especially with the heaping portion of buttered jasmine rice.\\n\\nThe Thiebou Djeun is a fish steak roasted in some sort of tomato based sauce over a gigantic heap of sauced rice and some roasted vegetables.

As we were walking in, an older Italian woman was giving big kudos to the gnocchi, and basically said everything she had was fantastic.   My friend and I decided on three items (we just couldn't settle for only two!), the gnocchi, fusili, and a pizza, the la capricciosa. The gnocchi was denser than I thought, but the texture definitely grew on me as I ate more.  The fusili was a nice contrast, being lighter, and the goat cheese gave a nice punch to the flavor.  My friend and I agreed that our choice in the pizza was a good one.  Oh how I love the crust! Chewy, crispy on the outside, with a hint of smokiness from the oven.

I think $5 is reasonable for the amount of food they give you. Two tapas will usually be a very satisfying meal for one person.

I've been to Cibo e Beve a couple times and think the food is A-OK. There are some outstanding dishes and service is excellent.\\n\\nCibo is a nice looking, warm and cozy restaurant. It's perfect for small groups and dates. The largest table at Cibo is a 10-person tall table in the back next to the open kitchen. I recommend sitting at the counter in front of the open kitchen to see (and smell) all the action. Convenient coat and purse hooks are installed throughout the dining room and bar. Between the bar and kitchen is a wood-fired oven for pizza baking. Wood is used extensively in the space, from floor to ceiling, including decoratively stored stacks of chopped wood (presumably used in the oven). Comfy booths and banquettes with pillows round out the rustic-yet-contemporary interior which can get loud when things get busy.\\n\\nMy trips to Cibo have been for dinner where the restaurant offers salads (e.g. the Insalata D'Estate includes strawberries, buttermilk dressing, candied pecans, goat cheese) and veggies (e.g. Crispy Brussels), appetizers like Wood-Roasted Oysters and Charred Octopus, pastas, pizzas (including Neapolitan-style pizzas), and traditional and inventive Italian entrees like Chicken Parm, Ossobuco (veal shank), and a \\"Cibo\\" burger made with brisket, short rib, and tri-tip. Expect to spend about $10-12 each for most apps and sides and $20-30 each for most pizzas, pastas, and entrees.\\n\\nCibo uses local, seasonal ingredients and I've noticed the menu change between my visits. The exact items I've listed in this review may not be on the menu during your visit.\\n\\nMy top three favorite Cibo dishes:\\n1. Burrata with tomato tartare, watercress, poppy seed, local honey and balsamic\\n2. Diver Scallops - corn and fregola salad, cauliflower cream, green apples, fig vincotto\\n3. Roasted Blue Point Oysters\\n* Honorable mention: Coconut panna cotta, hibiscus-blackberry coulis (dessert)\\n\\nMost recently, I tried the following spread:\\n\\nFirst Course\\n* Burrata Caprese Style - fresh mozzarella pouches with creamy cheese, local heirloom tomatoes, aged balsamic reduction, basil, EVOO, arugula\\n* Kale Caesar Salad - red Russian kale, creamy Caesar dressing, white anchovies, croutons, Reggiano crisps\\n* Cibo Meatballs - beef & veal meatballs, San Marzano sauce, ricotta\\n\\nSecond Course\\n* Rock Shrimp Spaghetti Carrettiera - fresh Florida rock shrimp, spicy San Marzano tomato sauce\\n* Lamb Scottadito - Italian marinated lamb chops, garlic jus\\n* Chicken Marsala - Springer Mountain Chicken, wild mushroom marsala sauce\\n\\nSides\\n* Roasted Potatoes\\n* Sicilian Style Broccoli\\n* Heirloom Polenta\\n\\nThird Course\\n* Tiramisu\\n* Cannoli\\n* Salted Caramel Gelato Pie with Amarena cherries\\n\\nOnce again, the Burrata wins. I can't get enough of its soft, smooth, creamy goodness. It is truly delightful. The Cibo Meatballs were fine. They were big - between the size of a golf ball and baseball. The sauce really brought out the flavor in the beef and veal.\\n\\nThe Lamb was my favorite dish of the second course. The on-the-bone meat was tender and tasty. The Chicken Marsala was my least favorite. When it came to the sides, I didn't care much for the Potatoes (rather plain), but the Broccoli and Polenta were terrific. The broccoli was nice and buttered up. I recommend the polenta. It was smooth and velvety.\\n\\nThe Gelato Pie was delicious with a plentiful helping of sweet Amarenas. It was the clear-cut winner in the dessert category.\\n\\nPlenty of parking is available at the strip mall. You may have to park behind the building and walk around to the front.\\n\\nCibo e Beve is on OpenTable so book online and earn free dining points."},{"name":"The Salt Lick BBQ","address":"18300 Fm 1826","city":"Driftwood","stars":"4","text":"We went on Saturday Night on Labor Day weekend.

There was a lot of chicken in the form of a nugget (eh) and it was very juicy - yum. This was my personal favorite, but I would have to be in the mood for this because of the hearty hefty flavors. \\nHogzilla (4/5) - the pork belly fat was very tender but the meat was a little bit dry. I enjoyed the pickled carrot and radish. \\nGlen Rhee (3/5) - the meat was on the dry side but the salsa was delicious. It was a bit tough to tear through without getting meat shreds stuck in between your teeth. \\nFirecracker Shrimp (2/5) - there was too much of the aioli for my liking - I found that it overwhelmed the others ingredients, but the shrimp was battered well! The shrimp had great flavor too which does not need to be covered by the aioli. Plus guacamole? That definitely doesn't need to be overshadowed either. \\nPorky's Tatchos (2/5) - eh, I ordered these for my boyfriend. I thought they were good but my boyfriend thought they were great. There wasn't enough braised pork (about 1.5 tbsp) to distribute the flavor. \\n\\nTo be honest I found myself reaching for the sriracha often for the Hogzilla, Glen Rhee and Tatchos. The turn off was the stiffness of the meat and the sriracha added the flavor and juiciness back to it (I love sriracha by the way, but avoid using it unless necessary in order to experience the dish's original flavors). \\n\\nOverall, I like King Bao - my boyfriends LOVES it.

This was a mistake, since evidently, this is not the speediest option. \\n\\nMost of the lunch crowd had not yet arrived. I placed my order for a sandwich and a side of coleslaw, and then proceeded to wait TWENTY MINUTES for it to be received. Several other guests who had arrived after me received their orders, so eventually, I had to ask the cashier what happened to mine. She gave me a puzzled look, which is strange, since I have been standing within feet of her for the past 20 minutes. After shuffling through some receipts she declared that mine had fallen to the floor and went unnoticed by the chef, and--an amazing 40 seconds after that--produced the order. She walked it over and said, \\"Sorry for the wait.\\" She did not offer a refund, or anything to try to keep my business in the future. She then immediately about-faced and walked away, leaving me to wait again to ask her for a napkin and fork. Eventually, another guest suggested I just grab one from a basket at the bottom of the cash register, which I did, and left.\\n\\nThe truffle chicken salad sandwich was mostly flavorless and bland. The Applewood smoked bacon is apparently crushed into tiny bits and mixed into the chicken salad, but these bits were few and far between. The jalape√±o coleslaw was very good, mercifully.

We drove a half hour into the country, then waited an hour & a half on a Thursday evening (no problem). I really wanted this meal to be 5 stars because I'm a bbq lover, but I can't even give 4 because their bbq sauce is SO nasty. That was the only bad thing we had.

This was the first time I had ever tried bone marrow and I was left wanting more. They brought out what must have been 2 or 3 bones cleaved in half with the marrow glimmering under the understated lighting. I was there with three other friends but I probably ate more than my share of the marrow. Other stand outs from that evening were the orange beignets and the octopus.\\n\\nLast time, I came with the bf for a nice dinner out. We came ready to order the chef's tasting menu but took a peek at the a la carte menu instead...obviously looking for the bone marrow but we were severely tempted to share the confit milk-fed pig's head. I asked our waitress about the bone marrow and she said the kitchen had run out and didn't have enough to put it on the menu. That got me down a bit but not too much because we were definitely getting the tasting menu and I had just ordered a cocktail with bourbon in it. The makings of the best Sunday night ever.\\n\\nThe tasting menu is lovingly crafted. It started with some lighter seafood fare working up to heavier sea food, pasta, duck, oxtail, and mushrooms. There isn't a wine pairing for the tasting menu but the staff is more than happy to recommend some. The featured wines-by-the-glass are supposed to go well with the meal but we decided we were happy with our cocktails to start. One of the lighter dishes included some oysters topped with roe and a light citrus sauce that really left an impression on me from how light and airy it felt. I very much enjoyed the warmth and heartiness of the the seasonal pasta with mushrooms featuring some local fungi that you don't see too often at restaurants. But, of course, the surprise was when our waitress brought out some glistening bone marrow with bread for us. I almost cried.\\n\\nCraigie knocks it out of the park in all areas.

I must let it be known that my wife is indeed from Italy (no, not just Italian, but born and raised in Rome). Having said that I can say with some authority what genuine Roma cuisine is really like (plus having visited Rome myself). True Italian isn't sugar laden and made with artificial ingredients, which unfortunately is what most Americans have come to know Italian food is (i.e. Olive Gardens, pre-made pasta sauce from super markets, etc). Although the American style does taste good, it's not real Italian nor is it natural and healthy. Those people that say \\"nay\\" to La Strada are missing the point here.\\n\\nLa Strada is true to it's Italian roots (the chef is a super nice gentleman) and the food is *fantastic* if you want authentic italian fare. All the dishes we have had so far are made from fresh vegetables and other ingredients. The service was fantastic and the homemade desserts are marvelous (small selection, but be assured that they are made there and taste as they would in Italy).

I'm a vegan and she is mostly vegetarian, and we both enjoyed our meals immensely.\\n\\nWe started with the red lentil soup and a special parsnip soup, both of which were very good.  The red lentil soup was lukewarm which was disappointing, but the parsnip soup was piping hot. \\n\\nOur entrees were perfection.  We split the butternut squash polenta, and a polenta cake special that came with tempeh and mixed vegetables.  SO GOOD!!!  You know when you're eating something and you just never want it to end because it's one of the best things you've eaten?  Yeah.  I'll admit the butternut squash polenta was a bit on the salty side, but we both don't like salt at all so that's probably more of a personal preference.\\n\\nWe split a chocolate ice cream and carrot cake for the dessert.  The carrot cake was sublime.   The chocolate ice cream came from FoMu, and it was probably the low point of the meal which was odd because we both have been to FoMu many times and love it.  The ice cream was super dense and not smooth/creamy at all.  Not sure if this was an issue with how it was stored or on the production side, but disappointing nonetheless.\\n\\nService here is not great, waitstaff is very friendly and helpful but seems preoccupied.  It was not very crowded when we went but nobody refilled our water glasses through the entire meal.  If a restaurant is busy, I get that water isn't a priority.

We only picked two meats and two cheeses so did not expect to see how well rounded the plate came out to be. They also immediately provide more bread as needed as well which was awesome. The pizzas were good - not my favorite, but my other coworkers raved over the mushroom pizza so maybe just personal preference. My biggest complaint was how loud the place was - I wouldn't recommend this place for anyone trying to have a group dinner where you actually talk to each other. Otherwise, fantastic charcuterie, good pizza and selection of fun cocktails, and not too expensive. Great option for anyone staying in the Copley place area."},{"name":"Raglan Road Irish Pub","address":"1640 E Buena Vista Dr","city":"Lake Buena Vista","stars":"4","text":"Make sure to make reservations.  There was a long wait when we arrived but they seated us promptly due to reservations.  It was a packed night on a Saturday and there was live entertainment.  We actually got  a seat right next to the stage.  I really love their dancing but the food to me was ok.  I ordered their infamous fish & chips and I was left disappointed.  ~$20 for a decent size of fish and some fries.  I wouldn't mind if it was good but it wasn't.

Fresh imported ingredients made in authentic Acunto ovens that come from Italy. You order your pie and go to the back in a small bench seating area in the back of the restaurant next to the open kitchen. The pizzas are one size,16 inches in diameter, yields eight slices and has a tangy, blistered crust. Antico is close to the Georgia Tech campus and is better suited for students than for older adults, but the pizza is awesome. I've been here several times and every time the pizza has been great. The food I would give 5 stars but deduct a star for the dining area. For younger people I would give this 5 stars. Too bad there is not a 4.5 star choice. This is a great place for authentic Neapolitan pizza."},{"name":"Royal Hookah & Cigar Lounge","address":"6203 W Sand Lake Rd, Ste D1","city":"Orlando","stars":"3","text":"I do not leave many reviews but this place deserves a good review for several reasons.

The same situation with the Mac and cheese. Definitely get the scallop dish with the fried oysters though. Holy moly. Expensive, but so worth it. Fried oysters were the best part of the dish, so don't shy away from them!\\n\\nMassive selection of beers and they do a beer/mug club as well. I don't understand the appeal of having to drink (and pay for) all of their beer options within a constrained time frame to win a personalized mug. I can buy one for under $30, rather than spending $100s on beers. I guess it's the challenge of it or the honor of having earned your mug. *shrug* Smart way to drum up business though.\\n\\nSide note - my friend's burger had a hair in it. Staff responded to the situation appropriately (apologized, offered to replace, the chef came out and personally apologized, and they took it off of the bill).

If you are looking for a bit of spice, the voodoo fish taco is the one to try. Prices are generally under $10.00 so very affordable. Kid friendly place.

But it's just not fine tuned like Disneyland is.  Many of the rides are simulators.  By the end of the night, I felt like throwing up.  I saw one of the parades, what a joke.  What they do get kudos for is the thought that went into some of the different lands.  Simpson's Land is pretty groovy.  \\n\\nNow the cream in the coffee.  Harry Potter land.  Holy cow they nailed it.  From the Hogwarts train to the butter-beer, A+.  Tons of detail.  The shops make you feel as if you're in the movie.  There needs to be some kind of face lift to the remainder of the park, it's slightly dated.  I think mainly because the rides are based on movies and many of the movies didn't hold the test of time...  Someday I'll go back, but still recovering a month later from the simulators.

We have been several times and the service has always been exceptional. The staff is super friendly and if you need recommendations on beer they are more than happy to offer a suggestion.

My complaint would be is that they kind of go crazy with the bean sprouts.  Her smoothie was pretty good, nothing to write home about.\\n\\nThe spicy tuna maki kind of echoed the entire meal.  The roll wasn't tightly rolled and it looked like they didn't have the correct amount of rice covering the seaweed.  BUT as ashamed as I am to say this... B cafe's spicy tuna maki roll is probably the best one I've ever had(and I've had Oishi).  Good amount of tempera flakes to give it a nice crunch when you bite into it.  Maybe I like sushi super white washed or something.\\n\\nThis place has intrigued me.  Overall, the food looked a mess but tasted really good.  Also, great value for the amount of food you get.

Absolutely love this place - great craft beer selection....surprisingly one of only a few in the area!  We tried the large plate with smoked beef tongue, pickled mushrooms, and foi gras pate and it was to die for.  Split the lamb shoulder sandwich and the salty pig parts sandwich (the parts they us vary daily) and it was awesome- a little on the bready side but I didn't mind so much because it wasn't heavy, was homemade and delicious- the lamb was probably my least favorite of the meal but was still good.  Also tried the salty parts pizza and it was awesome!  Salty and sweet!  Loved the music selection: Stevie wonder/hosier/Florence ....especially loved the open kitchen layout where you can watch them cook and prepare everything/ seems like they home make everything!

The service and ambiance were okay, but the food was terrible.  We ordered the short rib, pork belly and lobster corn dogs. \\n- The short rib was cooked decently but lacked any depth of flavor, and the celery root puree underneath was tasteless and had an off-putting color.  The bone marrow garnish on top was disgusting.\\n- The pork belly, like the short rib, was cooked well but had absolutely no flavor.  The baked beans underneath were not good at all...I would have preferred them to come from a can.\\n- The lobster corn dogs were the best of the three, but that's not saying much.  They were cooked well, and had a nice golden-brown color.  The lobster flavor was masked by the corn breading, and the lemon aioli that accompanied was very weak.\\n- The worst part was, all of our food was cold, not even warm.

I and my 4 other friends went with the Family Style option. It was, in my opinion, the best way to go. I loved it all but my favorite was the sausage and brisket. Cooked to perfection and so delicious! I could eat the burnt ends of the brisket all day.\\n\\nWith Family Style you get bread, potato salad, coleslaw, and baked beans. Mayo-haters do not get discouraged all salads are vinegar based. I loved the potato salad and coleslaw but the baked beans left something to be desired for me. They were savory and I prefer a sweater baked bean.\\n\\nAnother thing to note about Salt Lick, it's BYOB (no soda). If you forget your brews don't worry! They have a store and vineyard on site. \\n\\nSalt Lick also had many tasty looking desserts to chose from. I saw a pecan pie that looked particularly good.

There were like 2-3 other parties here that day so the place by all means was not poppin'. Let me share my thoughts about The Lower Depths with you:\\n\\n1) FOOD (3.5/5): \\n- Tater tot platter (Kenmore?): I'm not a tater tot fan but my roommate ordered this to-go and brought home a pie tin filled with CRISPY, DEEP FRIED taters covered in MELTED CHEESE and it was MAGNIFICIENT. (Throw some cheese on that b*tch.) OMGZ SO GOOD, I would most def go here just to get those taters. \\n- I ordered some sort of chicken wrap sandwich (I don't see it on the menu now) but the serving size was decent; I saved the other half for home. \\n\\n2) SERVICE (2/5): Like I mentioned, there were very few parties here that day but it took about 40+ MINUTES FOR US TO GET OUR 3 SANDWICHES. We were hungry and all I remember is the service being DANG SLOW.\\n\\n3) AMBIANCE (3/5): It was a warm summer day so we were able to sit outside on one of their handful of patio tables. There were only a few other parties here at this time so it wasn't crazy loud or anything. They have a bar and few tvs so you and some friends can go grab drinks and watch a game. On the *plus side*, very close to Kenmore Green line and bus terminal.\\n\\nBOTTOM LINE: \\nIf you are starving, don't expect to go here and eat right away.

So we had somewhat high expectations *smirk smirk*\\n\\nWe had trouble finding the place at first because it's not really marked all that clear or obvious (to us, tourists... *sigh*)  But we walked in and we found ourselves in a little japanese looking garden scene, which was really cool! It was peaceful and juxtaposed harshly with the noisy world just outside.  Then we entered through another door to the place.  We made our way to the cashier to place our order, and we just ordered the popular chicken katsu curry.  Plain and simple.\\n\\nWe sat down after getting some water.  They have tables and then they have these really cool, traditional Japanese sitting area where the table is closer to the floor and what not- great for groups!  We waited quite a while before they called us over to fetch our food.  It was a hefty helping, a wide bowl full of rice, curry and chicken katsu.  With our stomachs a rumblin', we dove right in.. with again- somewhat high expectations !\\n\\nThe first bite was bliss to a couple of tourists who walked around all day in the portland summer heat.. but then I came back to my senses by the second bite- because chewing the chicken katsu made an internal symphony of crunching and crushing sounds that only I could hear.. it was very fried and the batter outshining the white meat.  I didn't like that very much because it just made it seem very dry.  I like crispy, but not to the point that it sucks out all the juice in the chicken, ya feel?? But you know what, we were SO hungry that we devoured that dish.  The curry was tasty, it was a solid curry! Nice and warm and all.  No complaints about that. and I love rice in general so I was easily sold on that.  Collectively, the entire dish was maybe a 6.5/10 for me.. I've definitely definitely had better and I think they could do a few things to spice up the dish to make it better..\\n\\nBut overall, I enjoyed it!

This was the WORST restaurant I have ever been too.\\n\\nWe made a reservation for 7:30 PM a few days earlier, but when we arrived, we were told that the restaurant does not actually take reservations. I was pushed a bit for information on how this was possible, as I had a decently long phone call with the restaurant concerning the booking. And the details of the evening. Regardless, we were told that there was no table for us, but that we could sit at the bar and wait for one to open up.\\n\\nAt the bar, we were given menus with completely different prices than the website indicates. The difference wasn't a paltry dollar or two, either. Everything was significantly more expensive. \\n\\nWe each ordered a cocktail and appetizers. I received mine immediately, but my wife's cocktail never showed up. After about ten minutes of looking at this one lonely cocktail, I grabbed the waitress to ask what was going on. She had totally forgotten about the other cocktail, and dropped what she was doing to make it. Normally I would appreciate this, but I imagine that she probably forgot something else in the meantime.\\n\\nAfter receiving my wife's cocktail, we were delighted to see a table open up, only to be filled immediately by another couple that just arrived. I'm sorry, but we had reservations and were promised to be seated at the next available table. We had been at the restaurant for 30 minutes, fought for our drinks, and still had not received our appetizers. I told the older male waiter/bartender/whatever that if we weren't sitting at a table in ten minutes we were leaving.\\n\\nSomehow they managed to get us a table, and about 15 minutes later brought us the wrong appetizer. I asked for the correct appetizers and ordered our entrees. After another 15 minutes or so I asked the waitress to confirm what we had ordered, only to find out that she had never actually written it down and had forgotten everything. She did, however, tell us that the items we actually ordered (their \\"national dish\\") were unavailable. We stood up, paid for our drinks, and left.

The grounds are amazing, and it's BYOB. The BBQ was not the best I've had in Texas, but the all you eat for $24 was worth the price. I had an issue with my server James. I went to use the restroom and when I returned from the restroom, James was breathing heavy like he was running. He proceeded to ask me if I was going to pay for my check. I was actually going back to my table, but James insisted that I pay for my check first. I asked if he thought I was going to skip out on my check and he agreed that he felt I was not going to pay. I followed James to the cashier and paid the $26 and tipped James $5 for his service anyway. I decided to speak with the manager about the incident and the manager said he was unsure why James responded the way he did considering 99% of their customers pay as agreed. He apologized and offered to cover my meal. I agreed and took the money and tipped James again and asked the manager to coach James on proper customer service. I most likely will never visit Salt Lake BBQ again."},{"name":"Stats","address":"300 Marietta St NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Stats kicked off my birthday weekend festivities.

You can even keep it under the double digits by getting a single plate, more than enough food for my stomach. Either option comes with brisket, sausage, and ribs with the state's popular thin, vinegary BBQ sauce in a little pouring tin, not unlike a diner half & half pot. Sides are also bottomless, including beans, cole slaw, potato salad dressed with the same vinegary concoction as the meat, and endless cubes of the softest, pillowiest, most cloud-like bread I've ever had the pleasure of pinching and watching bounce back. \\n\\nThis tourist spot lets you in behind the counter to photograph the giant brick oven where it all goes down, and you can gorge yourself at any of the picnic tables in or outside.

So here's the low-down:\\n\\nPros:  \\n- They offer 2 sizes of burgers (6 or 8 oz) \\n- It basically tastes like a hamburger you made at home, which is a great change of pace from the usual McDonalds / BK / Wendy's\\n- Their condiment bar was excellent and fresh, plenty of onions, lettuce, pickles, tomatoes, jalapenos, relish, and pica for your burger.  Great quality too and you can heap on as much as you want. \\n- Their fries were pretty good, they seem to have a crispy coating to them that make them unique and different from the rest. \\n- The bun was really good - they say it's homemade.....well it was definitely more than just bread to me. \\n\\nThe Cons: \\n- Don't expect glamorous ambience, it's more like an old run-down place w/ old carpet and every table has a different chair - - although it was clean.  \\n- The service wasn't that great (this is the main reason why I gave 3 stars).  I waited an awfully long time for my order (10 min) and there were only 4 tables of people.  I finished off 2 ice teas during my wait and headed up to check on my order to find it sitting on the counter while everyone around was chatting.  They never called my number so I had to ask if it was mine (I already knew), and they said yes but never apologized.  \\n- I said the bun was good, and it was, but it was unfortunately drenched in grease so I'm sure it's still sticking to my arteries days later.  I just read in someone else's review that this location (Airport Blvd) tends to be greasier than the Guadalupe location, so I'm heading to Guad next.  \\n- My 8oz cheeseburger w/ fries and drink came to $8.00, which was a bit high if you ask me.  I was expecting 10-15% less, but oh well....I just sat their and ate away my 2 gallons of gas.  \\n\\nOverall - even though the service was subpar, I will give them another try in the future.  They praise their Bulgogi Burger (Korean marinated beef) and have plenty of literature posted on this, so it's worth another shot, although I may stick to the 6oz portion on my next visit."},{"name":"The Salt Lick BBQ","address":"18300 Fm 1826","city":"Driftwood","stars":"4","text":"The Salt Lick definitely lived up to the hype.

The sides- beans, potato salad, and coleslaw were decent but nothing to write home about. The meat was definitely the star of the show. Make sure to ask for a side of pickles and onions. The pickles were amazing! We also got the blackberry cobbler for dessert and it almost beat the brisket for our favorite dish. A must get here!! \\n\\nThe winery is also worth a visit. They have wine tastings and you can purchase wine/beer here to have with your meal. \\n\\nThe ambience is great.

My adventure that lead me to Craigie On Main started with the realization that my g/f's birthday was coming up in a couple weeks. This past winter we traveled to Paris and dined at a place called the Hidden Kitchen (a private dinner club hosted at a chef's apartment). We were treated to a 10 course tasting menu that was like nothing we have ever tried.  We are not foodies at all but going through that experience in Paris opened our eyes to what food could be when it is prepared with the skill and love of a true chef. Anyways, I tell you all this because when I was looking for a place to take my g/f for her birthday I immediately thought about a classy restaurant that had a chef's table so that we could see all the action and relive our time in Paris. Surprisingly there aren't as many of these in Boston as you might think.  Most of them have tables that accommodated 10-12 person parties so they would not rent them out for just 2 people. When it came down to it the restaurants I was deciding between were Craigie On Main, L'Espalier, and Menton.  All 3 have wonderful food and service but I just thought that the cozy feel that Craigie seemed to have suited us more then the ritzy/dry/uptight atmospheres that the other 2 places seemed to offer. Before I evened showed up for our reservations the staff was VERY helpful in making my g/f's night as special as possible.  I had flowers ordered and send to the restaurant earlier in the day and they had them set up on the ringside chef's bar (looking right into the kitchen) before we arrived.  They also, helped me pick out a great champagne and had that accompany the flowers.  A birthday card signed by the chef was also there. I couldn't ask for anything more from the tremendously helpful staff.  We decided to go with The Craigie Experience (six course tasting menu) because we were feeling a little adventurous piggy backing on our Paris experience.  We did inform the server that we did not want to be served any organs meats but that was our only restriction.  They had no problem with that and once again were very accommodating. I won't go through every dish but some of the dishes included: smoked sashimi salmon, sashimi geoduck, bass, pork ragu (my favorite), and pork belly (my g/f's favorite).  Once we had our 6 courses of food we thought it was over but then we were also served 4 more dessert dishes that included fresh fruit sorbets, a funnel cake creation, panna cotta, a sweet ginger drink, and finally some homemade chocolates. Needless to say we were STUFFED. The presentations of every dish were great and each server (even the head chef) made sure we knew what we were actually eating. Through out the dinner, which was about 3 hours, almost every employee came up to my g/f and told her happy birthday and that just showed me what a warm and inviting place this really was.  All the reviews I read about this place raved about the food but the service was just as good! Overall, this was one of the best dining experiences I have ever had and I have to give great thanks to Craigie for making me look like a king in my g/f's eyes! If you are reading this you need to go eat here and see for yourself what great food can taste like.\\n\\nP.S. during dinner we could not keep our eyes off the burgers that were being made in front of us.  We are defiantly going back to get one of those because they looked AMAZING!!!!\\n\\nP.S. during dinner we could not keep our eyes off the burgers that were being made in front of us.

They have a few natural juice drinks, I had mora en agua which transported me back to Central America when I would drink this daily.  \\n\\nSpeaking of feeling like I was in Latin America, the music was mostly 90's salsa and it was loudenough to hear but not too loud it impeeded conversation.

The flavor combination was funny to her, but she should have figured it out from the menu.  The thing that she really didn't like was that the pasta was overcooked.  I had the linguine al frutti di mare.  The sauce was good and the seafood was good.  The linguine was flaccid.  The menu refers to these two pastas being finished off in the oven.  Neither tasted like a casserole.  Both dishes just tasted as if the pasta was overcooked.  If the linguine was al dente it would have been a lot better.

Food that is good because it has to be:  The meats will be fatty and rich, the vegetables will be braised to within an inch of their lives, the seasoning will be salty, herbal and sweet/sour, and aromatics are not really used except in creme sauces or baked goods (think dill sauce or seeded bread).  This is immigrant comfort food.\\n\\nThe waitstaff will enthusiastically suggest things -- if you're indecisive or haven't been around Eastern Europeans, you might be put off a bit.

The barley adds an excellent texture, almost a hash rather than a pure blood sausage.  Have it with Zywiec Porter, which pairs beautifully with it.\\n\\nProTip: The bread is very good, save some for sopping.\\n\\nBeef Goulash:  Wine, smoked paprika, caraway, tender long-cooked beef, a little heat, the food showed up searingly hot and it was a chore not burning my mouth on this dish -- the smell was complex fragrant and comforting.  I had this with the cucumbers in dill sauce for counterpoint, which worked well.  Lezajsk beer recommended.\\n\\nDessert: Varies, check with the waitstaff if you honestly want to test your stomach that far.\\n\\n=====\\n\\nFollow up (Head cold, need some soup):\\n\\nBorscht.  Outstanding, a meal unto itself.  This and some bread and I was set, but then I realized I'd not eaten that day, so I had the Polish Trio.\\n\\nOn a diet?  The stuffed cabbage leaves will destroy you.  There is utterly no hope what-so-ever, so just accept the 2 hours of gym time and add them to the \\"but it was worth it\\" list.

We both started with the steak house salad which was very under-dressed. I was dying to try there Lobster Bisque as there is a restaurant in Newburyport where I live that makes the best! I was let down as it was very flat tasting. On to the entree's..... When the food arrived the plates were so small; we each had 2 small pieces of turkey with gravy, less than a dollop of cranberry sauce and spoonful of very mushy stuffing. We got 1 side of mashed which was cold and a side of sweet potato casserole (the only hot item). Unfortunately, we did not find our waiter to let him know how cold our plates were so we did out best. When he came to the table he asked if he could remove the plates, there was a lot of food left on these very small plates but he never asked if everything was okay.... We opted for coffee and the pumpkin cheese cake that came with the dinner. All we could do was laugh when the dessert was placed on the table.  It was the size of a half dollar; it was spongy and tasted like they forgot to add sugar when baking. Needless to say we dropped a lot of money and left so disappointed. The saving grace? My sister took me for a walk to Faneuil Hall to see the beautiful Christmas tree... It was like walking into a beautiful winter wonderland.

A couple of miscommunications that changed the night a tad, but everyone made up for it.\\n\\nPer recommendation of the waiter, I ordered the cod with chorizo, served in a ceramic dish. Unfortunately, he was just coming onto his shift and hadn't been told that the chorizo was 86'd.  I don't blame him, but wouldn't've ordered it so read the rest of the review knowing that I didn't get the dish as it was meant to be served.   I'll add that the chef came out to apologize once they realized the mistake and they gave me a slight discount on the meal and added a little port.\\n\\nThe dish itself was slightly bland and I see that they have cod dishes available without the chorizo.  The cod was a tad boney, which is fine, but good to know going into it.  It came with some nice onions in the dish and potatoes on the side. All fine, but nothing really that interesting about the dish or the fish.

Our monthly dinner group (18 people this time) was treated as though we were bothering the servers. No offer to refill any drinks (we had to leave our table to go to the bar after 40 minutes), had to ask 3 times for bread that came long after we finished our entrees, and twice for dessert. We were seated at 7pm on a Thursday night and didn't get the last checks until 10:45pm after most of the table had left. While we loved the food and had a good time because of good company, the consensus was this place is not worth patronizing again since there are so many choices out there. Why put up with really crappy service?

Most places will include \\"tostones\\" so I ordered a side order of tostones.  The tostones were plenty so they can be shared but They were cold and weren't crispy enough.

I've tried several times (with no luck) to get the recipe, but they have two sauces - a white garlic-y sauce and a spicier green variation that I think is just the white with jalapeno blended in.  Whenever we go the servers know to bring out several extra sauces, and there is never any leftover, in fact we practically lick the bowls clean!\\n\\nI reserve 5 stars for my favorite places in town, and this definitely qualifies.

We ended up getting another 1/2 pound of pork ribs (about 2 ribs). \\n\\nThe quality of the meat here is really good. The beef brisket is incredibly tender and juicy and the rub dry rub on the pork ribs is delicious.

We got there about 12 and the place was crazy packed.  It only took a few minutes to order, and a few minutes later a dude hands us a sheet pan with our pie.  Perfect timing since we just found a place to stand too.\\n\\nTip # 1 - Get water, not a soft drink.  Not sure why, but soft drinks are like $2.50 or something and they are small.  I read the reviews ahead of time and ordered water.\\n\\nTip # 2 - Eat in!  The pizza comes out piping hot and can be a little watery in the middle depending on what you order.  We ordered the Diavaola which has some peppers which pack a nice kick.  I'm pretty sure the high heat from the cooking was releasing some of the water from the peppers and giving our pizza a little water in the center.  No matter, once you pulled a slice off you could hardly tell.\\n\\nThe crust is like a cross between a yeast roll and pizza dough.  So light, cooked perfectly, a little char on the bottom, and it almost melts in your mouth.\\n\\nThe spicy sopressata on the Diavaola is like pepperoni's older hotter sister.  Better in every way when compared to pepperoni.  It's like the first time you ate non-boxed Mac and Cheese.  You think to yourself, why would I ever go back to that crap?\\n\\nMy co-worker and I managed to throwdown the entire pie ourselves.  There was a split second when we thought about taking two pieces to go, but we knew it wouldn't get any better than it was right then.  Good thing we paid attention to Tip # 2.\\n\\nOne the way out I managed to snag a cannoli to go.  The folks in front of me were taking forever to actually order, so they gave it to me for free!

And oh yeah, what's up with the CASH ONLY?"},{"name":"Antico Pizza","address":"1093 Hemphill Ave NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Ave Margherita...\\n\\nWhen I was Daniel Boulud's assistant at his flagship restaurant in New York City, each morning I contemplated my wardrobe carefully in consideration of the fact that my trek up to our office - in what is to referred to as the \\"Sky Box\\" - required a steep and narrow climb up a flight of stairs in full view of the four-star kitchen staff.  Any fumble in high heels or a compromisingly short hem would be noticed by all.  But once safely inside the office - free of danger and embarrassment - arriving and looking out the picture windows to the luxurious kitchen below felt like I had a been given a VIP pass to watch the exhilarating behind-the-scenes movements of a super-star team of chefs preparing for another nightly performance.  I felt special, unique, privileged...and I believe it's what fuels the demand for reality shows that give the viewer an experience that, until recently, was completely out of touch.  Several nights a week as I was ending my workday, servers and captains would prepare the skybox for private dinners purchased by wealthy New Yorkers desirous of an exclusive meal overlooking the live entertainment.  \\n\\nAlthough it may not have been the primary reason for his \\"chef's table\\" in the back of his new restaurant, Antico Pizza Napoletana, I believe Giovanni di Palma knew that people are not only bored with the dining scene in Atlanta, but they're also suckers for a unique dining experience.  I sure was.  On my first visit, before the restaurant was even open for business, I wasn't surprised to sit at the chef's table because it was, in fact, the only place to sit - the storefront renovations weren't even complete.  But on my second visit, weeks after Yelp! ranked Antico #1 in Atlanta (even higher than Bacchanalia), I felt lifted into semi-stardom when Giovanni invited my mom and I to sit at the chef's table.  Situated in the center of it all, we chatted with Giovanni in between bites of pizza Margherita and watched the staff prepare pizzas, cannoli's, and old fashioned pressed coffee.  Rest assured, whether sitting at the chef's table or at the gigantic, rustic table in the front of the store, you're guaranteed a bona fide Neapolitan pizza made with the same loving ingredients used in Naples and the surrounding region for centuries.  Giovanni went to great lengths to obtain the finest milled flours, salts, mozzarella di bufala and San Marzano tomatoes that actually meet the \\"strict guidelines of Italian law\\" that make this pizza an age-old specialty. \\n\\nNot only does Antico fill a niche in Atlanta that was nearly void of artisanal pizza, it also provides a comfort food that appeals to the masses.  While I've only eaten the Margherita (twice) and a hybrid of the San Gennaro (once), it doesn't take a genius to know that Giovanni's pizzas are simply delicious - from the doughy, bubbly crust to the juicy, flavorful tomatoes...the closest you can find to pizza this good would require a round-trip flight to New York for a pie at Franny's or Lombardi's.    \\n\\nSimilar to Daniel Boulud, Giovanni's plans for Antico sprang from the pure and simple desire to make good food, and yet, like Daniel, I see the beginning of an empire that will carry Giovanni from humble beginnings to a very large and successful enterprise, if that's what he wants.  Unlike many \\"chefs\\" that come to Atlanta with their branded restaurants who never step foot behind their own stoves, Giovanni is \\"en place\\" making pizzas every night of the week until he runs out of dough.  This is the beginning of tradition.\\n\\nUpdate 7/27/10:  As many of you now know, there is no longer a chef's table.

Which was fine since it had 4 fried plantains and then a pretty niced sized empanada.  The empanada was fried to a golden brown but didn't taste greasy.  3 of us split it and had maybe 2 bites each.  I have had lots of empanadas but I really like this golden fried variety with its delicate flakiness.

I too recognize that your palate is optimized for hot wings, potato salad, and cheap beer. Still, I humbly request you *try* this food that you label as being \\"disgusting\\" and \\"scary looking\\", perhaps even just to humor me. \\n\\nSee, New India serves better food than Bombay. For starters, it is always fresh and hot. The naan lacks the dubiousness present in the Bombay-naan you had before, and this basket we got has four different kinds of naan that are all delicious; how can you turn down sweet dessert naan with raisins in it, after all? And this delightfully creamy and aromatic Paneer Durbari/Korma with almonds and raisins --it is truly bar none in Austin. Here, try putting some rice on a piece of plain naan and then drizzling copious amounts of the Chicken Tikka or Saag on it and let your eyes roll back in your head as you bite down. Sooooo goood. \\n\\nWhat do you mean you aren't hungry? We're here for dinner, and there is plenty to go around. Does this Goat Malvani not interest you in the slightest? No?\\n\\nWell do you know what? Fine. You clearly don't know good food when you taste it, or even just see it since you won't try to taste it.

It was lovely. The gnocchi were perfection, and the dish on the whole had an unbelievable flavor. HIGHLY RECOMMEND. You will not be sorry.\\n\\nI tasted the butternut squash ravioli (unexpectedly tasty, not too sweet - I never much cared for butternut squash in any form) and the pesto [had a nice flavor and the basil was interestingly a bit coarse in texture - it was also more liquid-y than the kind of pesto I prefer (my mom's, of course), as if they added some broth to the sauce]. \\n\\nWine is $4.25 a glass.. beer $3.

It's hot, cheesy goodness with a pleasant sauce and a chewy without being too thick crust.

The blended fruit medley was pleasant and light... until it started tasting kind of plastic-y? I'm not sure if that's the right word to describe it, but the taste was off after a few sips. I couldn't finish it because it felt too strange to. The second time I visited, I tried their Eggplant Parm sub for lunch. It consisted of fried eggplant, marinara sauce, and provolone cheese. It came with a side of chips and a pickle. It happened to be Open Newbury that day, so it took awhile for my order to come out- which was understandable. However, the sub itself wasn't worth the wait. The baguette was dry and so was the cheese. It felt as though my order had been out for awhile since it was kind of lukewarm when I got it. :- ( The best part of the meal was the fried eggplant, even though it was a bit soggy- and the side of chips. My order came out to be around $15. \\n\\nTheir menu has a huge variety of options, so maybe it's a matter of ordering the right thing. A lot of it definitely sounds appetizing! The cashiers were very nice during my two visits. I have yet to explore the other parts of the store- such as the bookstore component of it, but I love the concept of such a large dining space alongside selections of books. :- )\\n\\n**UPDATE: I visited on 12/31/17 & 1/1/18 for dine-in and the experience was pleasant! I had their jumbo tots (~$5) and a frittata (~$10) during my first visit. One order of jumbo tots came with three large tater tots filled with cheese. There wasn't enough cheese filling, but it was so yummy nonetheless. I really enjoyed my frittata. It was an open-faced omelet that consisted of three eggs. There were bacon bits, potatoes, scallions, and tomatoes all mixed in. It went great with ketchup, and so flavorful and fresh, too. On my second visit, I had their soup of the day (tomato minestrone) in a bowl (~$6.90) and a side of home fries (~$3). I loved that the soup had a bit of kick to it- I wasn't expecting it to be a little spicy! I wished it had more components to it, like maybe some grains or more vegetables! The home fries were cut into large chunks- some were thoroughly cooked while some were still a bit hard. The service was friendly but keep in mind that they do get very busy so sometimes it's difficult to flag down a server. +1 star!!\\n\\n**Tip: If you see open seats at the bar, take one!!

Our food took forever to come out and my bff's food was cold, who likes cold steak and mashed potatoes. My duck burger was cold, bland and left a lot to be desired.

The food was terrific except for the Grouper entree, but I'll get back to that.\\n\\nWhen I first walked in, I went back to the kitchen. I design commercial kitchens, so I can't help myself. The equipment was heavy in ventilation because of the live fuel. It looked to me that they did the ventilation correctly, which is expensive. Then, I don't mind dropping 40 bucks for an entree.\\n\\nThe service in the courtyard was really weird. I can't say that the server was bad, or just overwhelmed. It was slow, our water glasses were almost always empty and he wasn't clicking. We ordered wine by the glass (Rose), and the comeback was, \\"we sold the last two bottles\\". OK, this stuff happens and menus don't get reprinted in time. But, usually the liquor order comes in one Friday. At 5PM on Saturday, the Rose was 86'd? \\n\\nHe made another wine recommendation, which I didn't care for, so I asked for a \\"taste\\" of the Spanish wine with a grape I didn't recognize. He agreed. Next thing I know, he comes back with the bottle, opens it and starts pouring. Huh? I wanted a taste first. We were already into our first course and I get quickly annoyed if I don't have wine.\\n\\nNext, I wanted a bottle of red and asked for the list. Waited, waited, and walked into the building just to find the server having a discussion as to what a wine list is. Forget the list, there were bottles on the menu, there was one I wanted. Apparently the door staff was stunned there were wine selections on the menu, or that they offered a wine list. But, there I was, leaving my seat, going inside to order a bottle of wine. \\n\\nThe server was quadruple sat, and he had no support. I had to walk into the building 3 times, each time the hostess staff was standing around. Would it have killed them to step outside and look at tables of empty water glasses, grab the bottle and start pouring. \\n\\nAgain, this is a restaurant, as many high culinary venues have, outstanding food, but a lack of emphasis of FOH skills. This continued when our entrees were dropped. One happened to be the giant pork chop was rare when the suggestion was medium rare. I knew Mason was not going to make to back in time. I took a platter of butterflied, rare pork chop back into the building and stood there. Two women an the hostess stand completely ignored me. Someone, finally, stopped and ask me what was wrong. I got an \\"absolutely\\" and \\"where are you seated?\\" \\n\\nIt was fired up a little and came out nicely. At that point the only complaint was on the Grouper entree. At $34-$40, the portions were quite good. We brought pork chop and beef home. The Grouper portion was very light. Now, I get that with fish, that portion might be a little harder to control. But, one of the sides was corn. Even that was small. Corn is cheap, throw on a few extra kernels.\\n\\nGreat food. Needs FOH experience.

We wanted to try a variety of dishes so we ordered a duck confit and mushroom ragout appetizer, Vermont pork 3 ways (roasted loin, spice-crusted rib, and country sausage), the famous Craigie burger, and a salted chocolate mousse with espresso ice cream for dessert. They also had a special side of bone marrow that evening that we ended up trying. \\n\\nDuck confit and mushroom ragout appetizer: delicious! The ragout was flavorful and the duck pieces were tender and moist. It was served with an over easy egg on top and the runny yolk mixed with the ragout and added to the creaminess.

At $18 for the burger I didn't think it was worth it, but I'm glad I tried it.\\nVermont pork 3 ways: I was also disappointed by this dish. None of the ways that the pork was cooked stood out to me. I didn't think the flavors worked together very well, and there was too much meat on the dish that wasn't balanced by anything else.\\nBone marrow side: this was the highlight of the meal. For $5, we received two huge slabs of bone marrow in the bone. The marrow was gelatinous and fatty and melt in your mouth, perfectly cooked for fatty buttery heaven. \\nDessert: this was excellent as well, although I wish the portion was larger for the price. The mousse was lightly salted, balancing both sweet and salty. The espresso gelato paired very well with the mousse, adding coffee notes to the chocolate."},{"name":"The Porter Beer Bar","address":"1156 Euclid Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Look.

Whether you want to or not, you get pushed into ordering from the first menu you can see when you enter. \\n\\nNext, they try to take advanced orders which appears helpful, but only means you can't see the bakery items you might want to purchase when you get asked what you want, resulting in people trying to guess what they want from 20 yards away.

I've often attributed this effect to the fact that there are just more snotty hipsters going and writing bad reviews to boost their street cred. In Luce's case I've discovered that it's ratings drop can be attributed to more than just snotty hipsters.\\n\\nLuce became the talk of the town after a few features in prominent food media such as Bon Appetit and Travel Portland. I can't comment on the quality of Luce before this exposure. What I can say is that Luce blew up on the scene after. This hype was evident when a group of me and two friends went to Luce around 630 on a Wednesday night, and waited a total of 3 hours to ever see food.\\n\\nThe way that our experience played out was that we waited in their overflow room for around 45 minutes and ordered wine. The server never offered us food or appetizers in this room, but it certainly could've been done to increase the speed of our meal and our happiness. After sipping on our wine we were given a checkered wobbly table outside. I was pleased because it was still light out and fairly warm. Unfortunately, sitting in the warm sunshine turned to shivering in the dark as we proceeded to wait almost an hour until our order was taken. The waitress came out after another 50 minutes and poured us a free glass of wine and gave us free focaccia with our appetizers, but it was too little too late. \\n\\nThe focaccia was ok, but it was a bit chewy for my tastes. For my antipasti I ordered mozzarella with anchovy and marinated mushrooms. Both were good, but I think it's wise to order the cooked/fried antipasti available (my friend ordered some and it was excellent). For our main course my group all ordered pasta. Sadly, we were very unimpressed. I had the Pork and Beef Ragu. It was, honestly, and average bowl of pasta. I, literally, have made better at home. \\n\\nSo, overall our experience sucked, but wasn't due to the wait staff or the food (which was lackluster, but not horrible). The problem was clearly systemic. There were not enough chefs or waitstaff to help customers. They were losing tickets, missing people, and the food was getting cold. It was also a bad sign that the owners and manager were nowhere to be seen. There were only 2 people serving an extremely large glut of patrons. Clearly, the reason why Luce's quality has suffered is because they have not figured out how to deal with fame. They're acting as if its ok to only keep the same staff to try to maintain that mom and pop feel. Well let me tell you, when I'm waiting for food for 3 hours that's not mom and pop, that's great grandma and great grandpa."},{"name":"Pino's Pizza","address":"1920 Beacon St","city":"Brighton","stars":"4","text":"I've previously had good experiences with Pino's pizza in the past, but tonight was definitely not one of them.

It's a small space, more of a pick up or get delivery sort of set up. The first time we attempted to order delivery, their driver was sick (or something), which was disappointing. There's very little worse that having everything selected and then being told you can't get it and have to start all over again. But I digress. For New Years Eve dinner we decided to give them another shot. And I'm glad we did. \\nFrom the woman who took the order to the delivery guy who came in record time (had to be 15 minutes tops), their service was great. The food was pipping hot - so much so in fact that while trying to remove the contents from the bag I nearly burned my fingers. That's good - means it was plopped out of the pans at the kitchen and scurried along to me quickly. \\nNow, on to the food itself...The Chicken Satay was pretty good but the peanut sauce was outstanding. The combination of the two gives it 8.5 out of 10.\\nGolden Rolls were quite tasty. Crisp and filled with ground chicken, veggies and glass noodles. They came with a sweet and sour dipping sauce, which I found to be more spicy that sweet and sour. (But I'm also a wimp when it comes to heat - for the most part). 9 out of 10\\nPork Dumplings were fried (I usually ask for them steamed but, got them fried this time) well. I think I prefer them steamed in general, but the filling was good in these and they were still quite tasty. I wasn't as crazy about the ginger dipping sauce for these as usual - might have been a tiny bit too much soy or fish sauce or something in there. Still quite good. 8 out of 10\\nGolden Triangles - These little bundles were extremely good. The reminded me of Indian Samosas a bit - potato, veggies and curry in a filo type dough. 9.5 out of 10\\nPad Thai was very tasty and a hit with everyone. 10 out of 10\\nPad Kee Mao with chicken was also suburb. It had 2 chilies by it on the menu but it really wasn't that spicy. The chicken was juicy and very good as was the sauce and large assortment of veggies. 9 out of 10\\nBasil Fried Rice was a bit disappointing to me. It only had 1 chili next to it on the menu but was significantly more spicy than the Pad Kee Mao.

We are also able to get carry-out for a party with friends, as we did last night, and get the pizzas home while they are still quite hot.\\n\\nBut I am downgrading to three stars because, despite the laudably high pretensions of the establishment, the quality control remains shaky.

The distribution of toppings across the pizza can be rather lopsided as well.\\n\\nI still sometimes find the experience worth paying a premium for: the pizza is vastly better than anything else on offer in the neighborhood, and by timing our visit we can get a seat and enjoy a home-brought bottle of wine for something like a third the cost of what a restaurant would charge us for the same bottle.

At first she just looked up and stared at us for an uncomfortable moment and then greeted us.

Additionally, let's even say that it is a strict policy and that the hostess obviously has no control/management at the front end.....she could have been professional and polite when she told us the policy. When we asked her if we could grab a drink at the bar, she said no as she was walking away from us AND wasn't even looking at us when she said no. In fact, since we were looking at the back of her head, we had to ask again to make sure we heard correctly. She then told another girl at the hostess desk to have us wait there in the waiting area. Hello? We are standing right there too. She could have addressed us directly. Then the girl just walked away without saying anything else. Honestly, with the heavy competition of restaurants in Portland, I was astonished that someone who greets patrons as they walk in could be so unprofessional. Needless to say, we didn't dine there.

But, in the event that it starts raining, or the deck is packed, you can always step back inside and have a good time on the generous second-floor bar area.  The food is solid -- classic Cambridge new American pub fare.\\n\\nBottom line:  Daedalus with friends on a summer night is unbeatable.  Enjoy the breeze,  look out over the rooftops of Cambridge, and feel happy you're alive."},{"name":"Flour Bakery + Caf√©","address":"12 Farnsworth St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"OMIGOD!

Pretty much everyone I've ever met in Austin talks about eating at the Salt Lick as an almost religious experience.  Well, this describes my experience: MEH.\\n\\nFirst, the positives.  I LOVE the atmosphere.  It is the absolute perfect place to bring an out-of-town guest that wants a glossed over, stereotypically Texan experience without getting their hands too dirty at a more bare-bones, hot as hell BBQ joint (aka anything in what I view as a lil piece o' heaven, LOCKHART) You sit outside, drink beer or wine from the cooler (it's BYOB, for those that weren't aware) under huge, shady trees on long picnic tables.  On a beautiful, cool day, it is an absolutely sublime way to spend an afternoon with a group of close friends.  It's also perfect post-tubing in San Marcos.  If you haven't already noticed, there's a running theme here: booze.\\n\\nIn my humble opinion, though, the food is just alright.  I suppose it depends on your preference.  Salt Lick covers their meat in a bland sauce so you could be eating turkey, pork...whatever, and you'd never know, whereas, the more authentic places in places like Lockhart, view BBQ sauce as akin to blasphemy.  They passionately (and VERY rightfully) believe in the quality of their meat, and, thus, believe that it should speak for itself.  Some places will offer sauce (Black's), but it's definitely frowned upon.  Maybe if I'd never eaten at places like Smitty's or Black's, I would really dig Salt Lick, but, for me, the experience was pretty much ruined.  Don't get me wrong, I had a TON of fun.  But, after eating the insanely good, flavorful, delicious smokiness of the various briskets, homemade sausage and pork ribs lovingly cooked by the real Texas BBQ capital, nothing really stands a chance.  Also, the various owners are completely charming and the sense of history covering the walls of the restaurants is totally humbling.  Think, all the UT quarterbacks since forever ago thanking the owner of Black's, and personal letters of adoration from LBJ.  \\n\\nSo, this has completely snowballed into one long rant about how I kinda like Lockhart.  Just a little.  Bottom line, if you're looking for a place with ambience, then Salt Lick is a fun excursion to take friends from out of town and wind down after a raucous afternoon boozin it up on the river, but if you want the real deal, BBQ that brings you to tears of joy, Lockhart ALL THE WAY."},{"name":"Row 34","address":"383 Congress St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I've dined at the bar twice now.

We had the wine tasting and Ms. Jaimie was extremely helpful, however, Ken and I already had a bit of knowledge of wines (just wanted to test her proficiency). \\n\\nThis place has their own vineyard and they support local growers and small businesses. They are very homey in the ambiance when we visited their establishment on a Tuesday for lunch. \\n\\nWe tried whites and the dessert wine. We usually get reds at other places so something adventurous was what we were looking for. Ken liked the Salt Like BBQ white wine --- don't ask me why it tastes good, but some folks say it's too sweet for meats (I don't think it's sweet enough haha). It was sweet to me but it had some dryness that made it perfect for the juicy brisket and ribs in the restaurant!\\n\\nI purchased the Dotson Cervantes Gotas de Oro '12 to take home. I tried it at the tasting and, although I've had the Italian Inniskillin dessert wine, this was appropriate to pair with the peach cobbler a la mode --- very succulent and the crust was cake-like (moist). \\n\\nOur server was David. Most of the servers are young but extremely efficient and very polite. Justin helped him drop off some drinks. David checked up on us every 10 minutes which was perfect. \\n\\nThe place where we were seated was by the windows; great view of the foliage outside, we had air to keep us cool (not as cold as your usual restaurants but because they smoke/cook meats inside -- obviously it won't get that cold). The tables are MASSIVE!! \\n\\nBring a friend (or 4). The Family Style is a killer --- I did not expect that we were eating all you can eat. I was sooo full after the first plate - the second one made me hate myself.\\n\\nThe meats were moist and flavourful. We had lots of it. We did not need any extra sauces since the meats were just right. \\n\\nI almost forgot about dessert until Ken reminded me. I moaned my predicament.\\n\\nThe desserts are large: we were told it was small (from the Texan perspective), but for those from the east coast, these were massive; think 1/4-1/5th of a pie. \\n\\nWe had Peach Cobbler a la Mode, and Chocolate Pecan Pie - the peach cobbler was well made; the crust was cake-like and moist. The filling was sweet and tart.\\n\\nThe Choco Pecan pie was unique but I was not in the mood for chocolate - it was moist but I needed something to contrast the meats.\\n\\nOur Linder (lunch/dinner) came up to an appropriate cost with the tip. It was a good place to bring a family to, or a date, since you can BYOB. It was a worthwhile meal but make sure to watch your portions - you can go get a dessert somewhere else that is equally flavourful but a palate cleaner like a limoncello gelato. \\n\\nOverall: when we have our friends fly in, we will definitely go here again."},{"name":"Row 34","address":"383 Congress St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"We were visiting Boston from Pittsburgh and went to Row 34 last night for dinner.

I'm not an expert at BBQ but I have eaten BBQ some BBQ here and there but so far this is THE BEST. First of all it's in the middle of no where a little outside of Austin. It's not bad of a drive. When you enter they have a big ass parking lot. It's BYOB but if you did not bring any liquor the place next door has wine and beer. They have a some space for the waiting area if needed. Luckily we got there around 2pm on a Tuesday so no wait needed.\\n\\nI'm going in with the kill with this review. The sausage. Wait first off let me just say that the brisket, ribs, and sausage are cooking for 28 hours straight before they serve it. Let me say that this is the best trio since Lebron & Bosh went to Miami with Wade. Now the sausage was smokey, juicy, fresh, and cooked perfectly. It has like hidden meat juices with every bite  I could've had a whole 3 feet of sausage and would not get full. \\n\\nMy second favorite out of the two is ribs. Meat could fall right off the bone. You can probably stick the whole rib in you mouth bite down and skin all meat off. It had good amount of fat and juices that all worked together. Perfectly seasoned and great char color and taste that you don't even need a knife to eat it. It tasted so good I was sucking the bone dry like a vampire. \\n\\nMy ultimate favorite is the brisket. Holy dead cow that they used to feed me I pray to you. I never had brisket like this. It was soft, succulent, so juicy, and that is with out the charred marble top dry rub. When you add the charred marble dry rub that was cooked for 28 hours you get a piece of Heaven. The best is when there is some fat and carmelized meat with my bite my eyes rolled back. This was the MVP. Every bite is delicious. I could not get enough. I want a 10 lb brisket from here for my birthday. I saw them cutting it and its like he's not using any force to shave it.

I didn't even have to think about my base flavor any further. It definitely has some great pimiento flavor to it and it you can even see some of the flecks on the popped kernels. Another great note about this flavor is that it isn't coated with the awful poison dust like the cheddar popcorn of olde. It's lightly coated, but it packs a good wallop of flavor. \\n\\nThe other flavor was Spicy BBQ. It's another favorite in the shop.

I saw an advertisement for Raglan Road in one of those tourist magazines that you pick up at the airport. I saw that they had live Irish dancing and music. That sounded like fun.\\nKnowing that Raglan Road is in Disney Springs, I decided to make a reservation. The reservation process was clumsy and required that I create a Disney account, but ok. At least I secured a reservation. We arrived on time and announced ourselves to the hostess. \\"Do you have a reservation?\\", she asked.  Yes we do! I replied. (Awkward pause while she looks at her screen....).  \\"Did you make it through Disney?\\" She asked. Uh, yes. Why?  \\"Our system doesn't work well with theirs\\" was the response (!?!?). However, she told us that they could seat us anyway (whew!). \\nThe hostess takes us into the restaurant and towards the stage...(I was getting excited).  Then we walked past the stage and down a dark corridor into a distant wing of the restaurant. That's not what we wanted!  I protested that we wouldn't be able to see the show. The hostess asked us if we had reserved a table near the stage (!?!?). I didn't know that you could. I didn't see any such request on the website, but then again, they didn't even have our reservation. Back to the gift shop we go. We waited about 30 more minutes, but this time we were rewarded with a seat right in front of the stage!\\nThe shows run about 40 minutes long each hour. The shows are different each hour so it's not a repeat.  The shows are lively and colorful and fun. We enjoyed them!\\nThe real surprise was the food. We ordered the Smokie City appetizer. It is a hot, cheesy fish and potato stew served with grilled bread.  They were a bit stingy with the bread, but the dish was delicious!\\nMy wife ordered the shepherds pie and I ordered the Kevin's Heavenly Ham.  Both were great and a bit different than we expected!  A nice presentation and high quality as well. Our sever was excellent.\\nFor dessert we had the bread and butter pudding at our server's recommendation. Amazing!  Not too sweet with a wonderful bread/custard texture.\\nThe bottom line:  Our food was great and the show was entertaining. The prices are steep, but that's what I expect at a Disney area. Watch out for the reservation glitches though (-1 star) and be aware that many seats cannot see the show.  We might have had a disappointing night if they hadn't been able to seat us where they did."},{"name":"The Dogwood","address":"11420 Rock Rose, Ste 130","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"Lost safety pin....almost had a nip slip.

The best ones are parked at each end of the rating scale (the lovers vs. the haters).\\n\\nAs a culinary nut and gastronomic delights fetish guy I approach this business model with a careful, yet analytical lens.\\n\\nFirst off, let's make one thing VERY clear... \\nThis establishment is doing a mighty fine job of providing a fun, no-frills, tasty experience using locally raised beef, locally crafted cheese, brioche buns made locally, and ketchup made in-house. \\n\\nIf you've been in school (you need not have a degree for this one) you will understand that making a commitment to supporting your local producers of such products comes at a higher cost to the business owner.\\n\\nI'm fairly sure the business owner isn't running a non-profit burger church but rather, is a business owner who would like to profit from their creations. \\n\\nI personally feel that LBB is a phenomenal deal. When I pay for all 4 members of my family to eat and it's $20 or less, that's amazeballs! I dare you to hit someplace like Burgerville and try that!\\n\\nThese things being said, I also feel it's vital to point out that many burger joints use cheap beef. Even the 'good stuff' you may have thought you were buying at your local Freddies had that now famous 'pink slime' additive in it. \\n\\nFor burger aficionados (either imaginary or actual) I would suggest that you ask, or you read deeper into the menu about where the beef is coming from our favorite burger joint. It's an eye opener! \\n\\nI know at LBB that I'm gobbling up a smartly proportioned burger that is made with all natural (pink slime free) Cascade Beef. I salivate when I think of the perfectly deep fried french fries lightly bathed in a mist of truffle oil and salt. I get giddy at the thought of their signature ketchup made with champagne vinegar & a wee bit of sri ratcha! And then there's the fry sauce... Holy smokes! It's a deviant combo complete with holman's mayo and their ketchup. Don't know what gets your burger juices flowing but these do it for me every time. \\n\\nI love LBB. My family loves LBB. It's nice to have a place where we can come occasionally and feel good about supporting!\\n\\nLast, I have to agree with some of the haters that the service has been choppy here at this newly opened location. I have not experienced some of the awful service detailed in some of the reviews, but I have been met with a few folks who were apparently having a difficult time providing exceptional customer service. In a town that is bursting with exceptional people needing work, it's always infuriating to me when I am met with ANYTHING other than politeness. I have zero tolerance for that kind of poor service. Look. I know it's hard dealing with loads of traffic. You work your asses off. But here's the thing... if you are going to succeed at anything in life you've got to take what you've got and fucking own it!

A solid Italian option!"},{"name":"Terramia Ristorante","address":"98 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I am sorry to report that Terramia Ristorante did not cut it for me. I should say upfront that we ended up going here because my wife had brought a Groupon at some point of time ($20 for $40 of food) but that fact had no effect on our dining experience. If anything, having used the Groupon was a saving grace because absent that, the dinner would have been an even worse value\\nfor us (more on that later).\\n\\nThe big reason for our disappointment in the restaurant was the small portion sizes. We had gone to the place with a full appetite but nothing out of the ordinary (not the kind some of my friends bring with them when they might go to a Brazilian steakhouse, for example!). All in all,  we were looking for our usual night-out - either an appetizer or dessert (but rarely both), 2 drinks, and 2 entrees. However, for various reasons, what we ordered differed quite a bit. \\n\\nFirst of all, in terms of drinks,  this place has a limited selection. The drink I always go with is the Riesling. Unfortunately, the place did not serve a single Riesling by the glass. In fact, the wine selection (those available by the glass) is extremely limited.  (9 to be precise - and that is across white and red!) My second preferred option after the Riesling are rose wines but again - no rose wine was available by the glass. Eventually my wife went for a single drink and she ended up getting a Rotari Brut Champagne. As is often the case, we would have wanted to try it out first before going with it but the Champagne (the only one which appealed to us on the menu) was available as a 187-ml. bottle and so the server could not oblige. The drink turned out to be fine but as you can see, the drinks selection left a lot to be desired.\\n\\nWhen it came to ordering an appetizer,  we looked at the prices and decided to pass. The median price for an appetizer was $15 and that's a bit too much IMHO.  Pasta dishes at Italian places tend to be fairly filling and we decided that we could always finish off with a dessert if we so chose. Moving on to our entree selection, we had a number of pasta dishes to choose from. Both of us love sea food so we decided to go with the only two sea food  pasta options  - the Spaghetti Alla Chitarra Con Gamberi E Aragosta and the Raviolone Aperto. Our wait was short and both the dishes came out pretty quickly. \\n\\nMy first reaction at seeing both of these dishes was a bit of shock at the portion size and a reaction of - \\"You got to be kidding me.\\" Once we got over that reaction,  we went for it and while the restaurant could have at least made up in taste what was clearly lacking in portion sizes, it failed to deliver on that front too. There is not much I can say other than that neither of the dishes were particularly flavorful nor original.  The pasta with fresh Maine lobster meat had two small pieces of lobster meat and each of us ended up having one of those pieces. The ravioli had lots of sauce, which was good, since the other dish was rather dry and needed some sauce. Our dinner was done quickly and my wife did comment as to how it must have been one of the  shortest dinners ever (given the minimal wait time - good, but the paltry portion sizes - bad). Our server did ask us if we were interested in dessert options but based on our experience, we opted out. And one last thing - when it came to getting the bill. the folks made an error, albeit a small one. Instead of adding $27 and $25 to $52, they added those to $53. I am sure it was an innocuous mistake but such an error shouldn't be there in the first place. \\n\\nOverall, there was nothing particularly negative about our experience but it is not a place we would have gone to had we known what our experience would be. Our total bill was ~ $67 without tips (before the Groupon gets factored in) and I think one can have a significantly better experience at that price point. Neither of us would want to come back to this restaurant, EVEN IF it were to run an identical promotion like the one which brought us in.

I am not sure how this is perceived in the US, but from my point of view serving the main course while the antipasto is on the table is extremely rude. The swordfish was of good quality and very well prepared (thought the grill should be cleaned) and the portion was substantial. The price was $20 ( they should update the menu prices on their website as I see pictures on Yelp with the same $20 a year ago..). The pasta was tasteful.

Unfortunately our waitress was the same mean lady who ushered us in the door. She proceeds to bark at us to look at the menu quickly and throws down water glasses at us. She comes back in 5 minutes and TELLS us to give her our order. When my boyfriend asked if he could substitute a sauce on his pasta she screams NO at him..... I'm sorry but if we're paying customers I'm not sure why you wouldn't allow such a simple request.

We were obviously going to tip but not 15$ on $44 especially considering how insufferable she was.\\n\\nI have eaten at amazing authentic Italian restaurants with exceptional service and a great atmosphere. This was unfortunately not one of those places. If the food had been as amazing as we thought based on the reviews we would consider going back despite the service. But because of how terrible the service is, how miserable and disrespectful or waitress was and how they rush you and make you feel unwelcome, I would never visit this place again.

True Authentic Italian restaurants care about the atmosphere and if their guests are\\nComfortable and feel welcome.....THAT is the Italian culture we expected.\\n\\nI can also say the other guests in the restaurant were treated just as disrespectful and rudely as we were.

A chorus of 'May I have a fork?', 'You forgot my wine', 'How about some salt'...'um we have been waiting for our check for 30 minutes' kind of ruined the experience.

They were most successful with the pork belly but it still needed more seasoning. This can be achieved by having a more flavorful braising liquid. What they need to work on is the flavor development of the proteins.

The place is very nice inside but I don't get the brown paper over the vinyl tablecloths.  Some tables did not have that, I wish they all did not have that.  Our waiter, David, was very nice and attentive.  The menu is not what I expected.  While there were many fish dishes, there were many non fish dishes as well.  The prices are on the higher side.  They seem to be a fan of \\"Asian\\" and \\"Thai\\" sauces on several menu items which I do not like so much but there are other sauce options if you want it.  The fish and chips, while cooked  very well, was made with talapia and not a haddock or cod which is a better piece of fish and which we would have preferred.  For a piece of talapia, though, it was well done but not flaky and light like a cod or haddock, more dense.  I had one of the specials which was crab crusted cod.  The cod was prepared very well with a nice sear at the bottom which gave it a great carmelization flavor.  The crab crust was some crab meat thrown on top, not a lot but enough to get the effect.  By the time I added my \\"upgraded\\" side for an additional $3.50, my dinner cost $26.00.  These are Boston prices.  The fish and chips was an affordable $13.90 but that is because they used a cheap talapia.  I'd rather pay 5 extra dollars and get a cod or haddock. The portions were large.  I would definitely go back and try some more items on the menu."},{"name":"Marcelino's","address":"901 Tillery St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Best tacos in the neighborhood.

They give you a small baggie of pickled carrots, radishes, jalapenos too.  So good!!!\\n\\nI've read reviews elsewhere where people rave about the breakfast burrito but I have not tried this.  I have gotten fish tacos but be forewarned, they are done in the Mexican tradition, very basic, two corn tortillas, a small amount of fish and onions/cilantro.  That's it so don't expect an Americanized version, just appreciate it for what it is!\\n\\nThe people who work here are some of the kindest and most pleasant restaurant workers around, always helpful, smiling and working their butt off to fulfill the orders coming in non-stop.

Well done.\\n\\nWalking into the joint, it's not that impressive. It's fun and somewhat hopping. The bar area is notorious for a virtuoso male of the cocktail behind the bar. He grows, collects, and makes his own bitters, mixers, and flavorings. TIP: please come early and seek him out.

The waitress was as slyly attentive and monitoring of the table as one would expect in a white tablecloth classy joint. Neither intrusive nor too distant. \\n\\nDrinks: You must try the daiquiris! They aren't the Wild Willy's sort. These are mean drinks in their original boozy nature. After having them, I'm proud to say I would love a daiquiri. When the hell did adding an extra 100g of sugar and 1 lb of ice come into the equation in the past 70-80 years?! Highlight was the Papa Doble -- Hemmingway would be proud. Come to think of it, he's the perfect role model for stating how a daiquiri was (and here continues to be) a noble and fine drink of choice. The Lawyers, Guns, and Money was... money. Drink up. Only the Boogie on Reggae Woman was meh. Yes, I had three daiquiris. Don't judge.\\n\\nFood: Unfortunately my companion did not want to do the tasting menu. Who comes here and doesn't want the tasting menu?! Not gonna order it (and can't) unless the both of us could. So I chose the $67 option for an appetizer/small dish, main dish, and dessert. Conversely, one could have ordered the chef's choice tasting menu for only $100. I watched the table next to me in envy. Sigh. Note: the chef's choice menu can be made gluten and/or veggie-sensitive as needed.\\n\\nI ordered the Essex Clams. My god the Essex Clams. Whole body clams, fresh, fried perfectly in a somewhat rough on the tongue but chewy batter. The squid ink anchioade was the piece de resistance: heavily thick dipping sauce. Who the hell needs tartar sauce or clarified butter (if dissing clarified butter doesn't tell you how good this was, nothing will). I'm asking for squint ink anchioade when I go to my next clam shack in the summer instead -- though I'm sure I'll get a dirty/quizzical look. I was skeptical about the preserved lemon, but it just works, man.\\n\\nFor my entree I ordered the Pork Three ways. The rib. Oh, the rib. I know, it's just one rib, right? Savory sweet as all get-out. Fell off the bone tender, too. I'll have one rack, please! Oh wait. Fine restaurant. Only moderate portions. Sorry. Luckily the Porcelet Sausage came to the rescue of my hunger. It's deep umami and somewhat gamey taste was mana from heaven. The pork rolled out of the casing just waiting to be sopped up. Both fresh and cured. I'm still in shock and awe. I kept eating small portions of it and attending to the slow-cooked belly so I could prolong affair. Don't get me the wrong, the belly was good. But rib and sausage were epic.\\n\\nMy companion had the ragout of locally foraged mushrooms without the pork sausage (vegetarian). I think it was a little too earthy and rustic for her. The pasta was whole wheat and seemed to be comprised of vegetables and other starches (potato?) and is served cold -- very un-Sicillian. Good for me, not her style. It created for a hearty dish and I was glad to finish it for her.\\n\\nFor desert, I had the malted milkshake. I have to say, it was quite minty and thick. Not a large portion but rich enough that you didn't need it. The graham cracker should have been renamed the crack cracker. I don't know how they made such an incredible combination of crisp cracker with flavorful graham sugar; I'm just glad they did.\\n\\nScooting away for a mid-$100 check for 4 dishes, 4 drinks ain't bad when the food is this good.

We FINALLY found it at Nakato. We prefer authentic Japanese nigiri sushi and sashimi (as opposed to Korean and/or American sushi and sushi rolls), and we were encouraged by the fact that Nakato is Japanese-owned and operated, with actual Japanese sushi chefs.  Our experience was absolutely fantastic, start to finish. Our sushi chef, Nishihara-san, recommended the freshest fish and cuts for us, and boy did he deliver. The salmon and flying fish (tobi-uo) nigiri were amazing. He also had fresh aji (Spanish mackerel), which is rare. The sushi is not cheap, but it is definitely reasonable for the high quality, freshness, and flavor. The flying fish and scallop sashimi literally melted in our mouths. We went on a Friday night, which was perfect, as the fish is apparently flown in from the Tsukiji fish market on Thursdays. The service was also excellent.

It was ok, but needed a little more sauce. The second time, I got the pad thai with chicken and veggies-- it was FANTASTIC. Not too greasy, just enough spice, just enough flavor. The rest of my party also really enjoyed their meals-- the basil fried rice and a beef dish whose name escapes me right now (his main complaint was not getting enough rice, but the server brought him more on request). I sampled a bit from their entr√©es and really enjoyed the basil fried rice. The next time I went to Sea Thai, that's what I ended up getting (my friend ended up with the pad thai) and both were ok, but not as good as the last time I had been. The portion sizes were huge and I had leftovers to bring back with me. We had also ordered spring rolls. They came with a strange clear sauce that had an odd aftertaste I cannot describe.

Keep in mind that you probably shouldn't order this if you're in a rush because it takes time for each part to come out. Every single course that came out was both delicious and a work of art from the sashimi to the nigiri. Each omakase also comes with a small soup and dessert, so I was perfectly satisfied by the end.

I've done the omakase at other restaurants before, but you can tell Kappo really takes pride in their quality and individuality while maintaining a flawless authenticity. And I know my Japanese food since it's by far my favorite cuisine. \\n\\nTheir menu changes all the time, so no experience is like the last.

He's never had tapas before and we've been on a culinary adventure kick so we decided to dine here on a Saturday night - great choice!\\n\\nWe started with a pitcher of Cava Sangria - citrus flavors, light and refreshing, bubbly! Now for the tapas. For those of you who've never experienced tapas, you forego the traditional entree and order several, smaller dishes and shared. Our waitress suggested between 3-4 tapas per person. We had a hard time settling on the dishes we wanted to try but ended up with the following:\\n\\nBunuelos - broccoli & cauliflower fritters. Delicious. Crispy outside, chewy on the inside, accompanied by a creamy, tangy aoili. The sauce went very well with the fritters.\\n\\nMejilones A La Salmorra - steamed mussels in a spicy tomato & wine sauce. So good. My boyfriend is allergic to seafood so this was all mine. Huge portion of big mussels, great sauce, spiced well. Soaked up the extra sauce with the bread, which was key! \\n\\nPechuga Con Huevo - grilled chicken breast, crispy fried egg, yukon gold potatoes. Nothing special about this dish. I was underwhelmed. The best part of this dish was the potatoes - they were spiced and flavorful and set the tone for entire dish. \\n\\nButifarras Con Foie Grad - pork sausage, foie gras, poached apples, fig and port wine sauce. I loved this dish. We made sure to get a little bit of everything with each bite because the flavors went so well together. The sausage had spice, and the port wine and poached apple were sweet and tangy. Great dish.\\n\\nLomito Al Cabrales - pork loin with cabrales blue cheese sauce & mushrooms. I was a little nervous about this dish because I'm not a huge fan of blue cheese and it can often be overpowering. I was pleasantly surprised. The sauce was almost like a creamy alfredo with a slight tang from the blue cheese. I especially liked the mushrooms. The sauce was so good, my boyfriend soaked up the remaining sauce with bread. \\n\\nAt first, I was a little disappointed they didn't bring out all the dishes at once as I wanted to sample a little bit of everything. But once we finished our meal, I was definitely happy that the dishes were presented over a series of courses. You were able to enjoy each small dish while it was hot, just the way the chef intended.

The second order was more dry and not as moist. We even asked the waiter if it was the same batch.

The pork ribs fell off the bone and soft. Ughhhh my mouth is watering!! Beef ribs aren't my favorite but I have to say, the seasoning and the way the cooked it was on point!

What are we to do with all that extra yolk from the second egg?! Please throw in an extra waffle so we can enjoy eating our food evenly!\\n- Shared a waffle with two toppings: 1) maple syrup and 2) white chocolate pistachio rose water. The maple syrup tasted more watery than I was used to. Wasn't too big of a fan. The rose water was good but I couldn't pick out any white chocolate in the taste.

There is another place in Austin that comes very close, but this is by far my favorite barbecue.  \\n\\nFirst, the atmosphere that surrounds the restaurant is fun and upbeat.  I've only been there on weekends and they've always had live musical entertainment outside on the patio, which is great because there will be a wait.  But believe me, the wait is worth every last finger licking bit of deliciousness you'll get once seated. \\n\\nInside the main restaurant is a large barbecue chock-full of ribs, brisket, sausages, chicken, turkey - make sure you go in and see this even if you're not seated in the main restaurant.  Once seated you'll have to make the hard decision on what to order.  No worries because you can pretty much have it all.  If it is your first time there, I would strongly urge you to order the family style.  This way you get brisket, sausage, ribs and all the sides...and it just keeps coming.  If you decide you don't want this much, however, go for one of the combo plates.  Last time I was there I had the 2-meat combo with brisket and turkey.  I was a little hesitant to order the turkey (because we all know turkey breast can sometimes be dry), but it was so moist and delicious that I can't wait to go back and order it again.  I have heard the desserts are phenomenal, but unfortunately I've always been too full to try them.    \\n\\nNow I want to take a moment to briefly discuss the barbecue sauce because it is worth discussing.  It is a mustard based sauce, but it has the perfect balance of tangy, sweet, and spicy.  No one flavor overpowers the other.  I could literally drink the stuff straight out of the bottle.  I am extremely happy to say that there is now a store in Omaha who stocks the Salt Lick BBQ sauce.  I will never have to go without again. \\n\\nSo how do you prepare for the Salt Lick experience (because it is an experience)...go hungry, be prepared to wait if you go on a weekend night, and stop for beer or wine on the way because it is BYOB."},{"name":"Giacomo's Ristorante - Boston","address":"355 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"One of my favorite restaurants! \\nEvery Good Friday, my mom and I go to the North End as our tradition.

Ryan was a very attentive server and knows his game.  All three, for the most part, were very good... but there was a big slip-up.\\n\\nBread was great.  The tuna carpaccio was delicious, but perhaps could've been a bit thinner.  The bar was short on ingredients and could not mix two of their signature drinks.  The salad (Washington?) was very good, as was the pasta chicken primavera.  The ahi tuna was good but not stellar.  The lobster spaghetti was good (I was told the noodles were overcooked) but was a poor value since it had very little lobster in it.  \\n\\nThe atmosphere was upscale and very nice.  Hard flooring and a very open room lend to more noise than I would have preferred, but the booth seating was superb.  \\n\\nNow for the faux pas...  The $14 hamburger was ordered medium-rare but arrived dead rare.  I confirmed by looking at the center and it looked completely raw, which I was told was cold.  This in itself was not a big problem, but the way it was handled was very Applebee's of them.  They quickly scooped up the entire plate instead of leaving it, which was a big mistake.  Who the hell wants to sit around watching the rest of their party eat with nothing in front of them?  If they'd left the plate, my sister could have eaten the outer/more cooked parts of the burger and nibbled on the fries while waiting for a new plate.  Or, if they couldn't stand to leave the old plate then at least offer your guest a quick appetizer or drink while they're waiting.  This is not rocket science, folks!  To make matters worse, the manager? personally came out to clarify exactly what temperature the beef should be.  I can tell you that his demeanor was very passive/aggressive and insulting.  He didn't apologize for improperly cooking the meat.  Instead, he strongly implied that his cooking was correct and her palate was not.  This is, by far, one of the best ways to alienate your clientele!  If you don't know what medium-rare is I suggest you go back to culinary school before going back to the kitchen.  In this case, I think it was obvious that your guest wanted it cooked more than it was when served, so even a moron should be able to figure that one out, all temperature descriptions aside.\\n\\nIn the end they sort of redeemed themselves.  It was taking too long for the replacement burger plate to arrive so my sister told the server to cancel the order, especially since the rest of us were nearly finished with our entrees.  The burger was delivered a few minutes later anyway, but it was comp'd and put in a doggy bag.  I made mention to the hostess upon arrival that it was my mom's birthday, and they made note of the occasion.  Ryan arrived with a surprise dessert for her called coconut flan.  We all hate flan but this dish was in an entirely different class, I can tell you.\\n\\nI would return to give them a second shot.  I am an old-world pizza afficianado, so I would love to sink my teeth into their margherita and a few others next time.  I'd also like to try the BMPT? cocktail."},{"name":"Pio Pio Restaurant","address":"5803 Precision Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"So good. Must do the pio pio ceviche. Best ever.

No, not because I feel especially passionate about it (though I do love coming here), but because after looking over my reviews, I noticed an abundance of Mexican and Italian restaurants.  That's funny because those are my two least favorite foods.  Yeah, yeah, blasphemer.  Sorry.  I think I've been to so many Mexican places because I'm always searching for something I'll love.  That and it's the fiance's favorite.  (Yes, married men, I've learned quickly.)\\n\\nBack to Little Bangkok, thai food is one of my favorite cuisines.  I know, here in the aughts, that Thai is played out.  So sue me.  Wait, that's one of my favorite Chinese dishes.  Anyway, when I first had Thai those many years ago, it was love at first bite.  Spicy, Asian food...whoa.  I love Thai food so much that Tom Kha is one of my favorite dishes in the world....and I hate raw coconut with a fervor reserved for Nazis and boy bands.  And Little Bangkok, my friends, has one of my favorite tom kha soups.  I'm also addicted to the larb which I order, not just because it tastes good, but because I like to say the word \\"Larb.\\" Larb.  Larb.  It's a fun word to say.  Try it.\\n\\nOK, parking here sucks.  Park next door at that brick building that I think are law offices.  (As long as it's after hours, though.)  Waiting here also sucks as there is NO waiting area.  Be prepared to stand on the doorstep or the sidewalk, two things that I tend not to recommend when on Cheshire Bridge.  (Unless you want to make some extra money on the side, if you know what I mean.)\\n\\nLittle Bangkok is worth the wait.  Make sure to order the specials though.  The standard curries and basil beef plates are good, but nothing to write home (or write yelp reviews) about.  If you just stick to these plates, then you'll wonder what the fuss is.  But if you order one of the ubiquitous daily specials then you'll understand.  Ah-HA!  The thai'd has turned and now you understand!  Even though I've been stingy with my five stars lately, when you take into account the value, the pleasant service I've always got, my favorite soup in the world, and the Filipino peso that's smack dab in the middle of their world currency decor near their cash register, Little Bangkok earns five.

They offered us a town car to get back to our hotel which was only a few minutes away.\\n\\nCons - The tables are extremely close to each other making it near impossible to have a conversation (because of the noise) and you feel like you're constricted in your movements. Our table for 2 was really small also, making it really hard to put our food and drinks down without having other things fall. We ended up just stacking other things and asking the next server to take it all away (including bread =( but there really was just no room for it). \\n\\nWe were also shocked at how many people were dressed casually considering our meal (dinner for two and two drinks) was over $100. Not the worst thing but it definitely took away from the atmosphere we were expecting.\\n\\nWould I go back? Probably... But maybe once every other year."},{"name":"Pizzicato Pizza - Fremont","address":"4217 NE Fremont St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Now this place knows service.

I truly believe quality service should be rewarded!\\n\\nP.S. I also have to give a shoutout to Justin Issacs for taking time to come say hello, even though he was working in the bar room.

My friend and I drove about 40 minutes from the UT-Austin campus area to get here around 5 pm on a Sunday. In addition to the drive, we waited about 40 minutes. Thankfully the weather was nice, and we had a good conversation. Finally when we were seated, we were sat at a rather large table for a party of 2.\\n\\nFood: I got the unlimited barbecue deal because I was feeling particularly hungry. However, my friend ordered one of the barbecue plates with the option of being able to upgrade to the unlimited. (This very useful fact was confirmed by the waitress). The food came out and was absolutely delicious. The potatoes were okay, the cole slaw (I think that's what it was) was a good change from the slabs of meat. The beans and jalape√±os were good (per my friend's opinion). And of course, the meat was amazing. The brisket was moist enough and consumed in large quantities. The ribs were super. I usually do not prefer sausage meat, but I was still pleased at its taste. I ended up eating 3 plates of meat (I eat a lot okay) and then took another plate home.\\n\\nService: The service was decent. The greeters, hostesses, and waiters were all friendly, but in retrospect, there seemed to be a lack of a personal service that is present at places with good service. I contribute this to the huge hoards of people that go during meal times, leading to the lack of connection the service staff has with the customers. At least the food came out quickly, although the wait to be seated was a little long.\\n\\nEnvironment: The environment was all in all full of hustle and bustle. There were a lot of larger groups and the crowd was generally older. The place was pretty clean. I was there with just one friend, while, in general, parties seemed to have at least 6-8 people.\\n\\nMy meal was $21.95 + tax. So it was definitely not cheap. However, I did eat a BUTTLOAD of meat and was so full afterwards. I would not recommend coming here with just one other person because groups of 6 would probably be a better fit for this atmosphere. The next time I come back, I'm definitely going to order a plate and then upgrade to the unlimited, and it will definitely be with a group of friends. With the great food and atmosphere, this place is perfect a group of friends to get together once in a while (it's too expensive for my college student budget to be a weekly or even a biweekly thing) and feast on some delicious barbecue."},{"name":"Teranga","address":"1746 Washington St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Everything has SOO MUCH flavor.

We had to aggressively get a table and it was outside and miserable because it's like 90 degrees outside. I ordered the chicken Caesar salad which was super mediocre and my husband got the pepperoni flatbread, which is totally cheap pizza. The customers are super rude, there's couples taking up tables meant for families of 6 and people just hanging out.

I echo the other reviews, the kitchen staff really knows how to take advantage of seasonal goods. I also think that this is a place to go when you want something good and creative, but aren't picky about what. The reason I say that is because the specials here are pretty damn special. \\n\\nOn our first visit, we tried both the appetizer and soup specials. The appetizer was an amazing duck confit (think breaded and oven baked). I'm not an expert in fowl, but the meat was extremely flavorful, tender, and fell off the bone. The crust was fantastic. We followed that with the Fried Squash Blossoms (a rarity in the states), which were good but a wee bit overpowered by the hummus filling.\\n\\nThe soup of the day was a Roasted Corn Soup, and it was in the top 3 soups I've had my entire life. Simple, balanced, fresh with just the right bite. Old Girl had the Roma/Crab Gazpacho, which was very good. \\n\\nWe decided to go with normal menu fare for the entrees, the pork porterhouse and the filet. It was a 16 ounce tbone pork cut, the filet more normally sized at ~8 oz. Both were very good, although I think the Pork outshone the filet. The sides were fantastic, a cheese stuffed potato cake with the cow and a mix of veggies & chorizo with the pig. \\n\\nWe had friends coming by the place after their Midtown run, so we packaged up all the deserts we could carry (OK, she could carry), and took them home. The things I do for y'all, really...\\n\\n1. Peaches and Cream: is exactly that. Very fresh and tasty, but I was hoping for a magical cake/muffin/shortbread/piece of starch with which to savor my peaches. No Carbs for you. \\n\\n2. Chocolate Opera Cake: I would go eat this again, even if they only served it in hell. Moving on. \\n\\n3. Ricotta & Honey Napoleon: Don't really know what a Napoleon is. Don't really know what this was. Flaky bottom, fruity top.Tasted great. \\n\\nA minor complaint, but one that I didn't let change my rating - for the remaining smokers, the smoking area is you standing in front of the restaurant, or sitting on a bench beside the front door. I know, we shouldn't, but if we do - you probably don't want to walk through the cloud on the way in.\\n\\nAll in all, a great place that I'll definitely visit again. Nice Interior, clean lines with a nice selection of local art and decent views of Freedom Parkway. Very quickly gaining on a \\"5\\" from me, as soon as they can more fully justify their price across the spectrum of their menu, and as their waitstaff becomes more familiar with their dishes... and the free palate-cleansing-veggie-hippie-drink they give you comes with a bit of rum in it."},{"name":"Sweetish Hill Bakery","address":"1120 W 6th St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Sweetish Hill catered an event for me on June 8th, my mother's 90th birthday.

It opens at 4:30. I ate there on a Thursday. I got there around 5 and the place was already packed. I got the last open table. I also walked by the restaurant on a Friday night. I noticed a couple was already camping out at 4 to beat the lines. At 5, the line was already out the door. The food lived up to its reputation. For my appetizer, I ordered the fried calamari. The calamari was fresh and tender. It was breaded lightly, which I thought was the perfect balance between calamari and breading. It had a nice crunch to it. The appetizer also included jalapenos and red peppers. They were also breaded and fried. However, they were spicy and had a strong kick to them, which is not my preference. The marinara sauce was excellent. For me entree, I ordered the butternut squash ravioli. The pasta dough was perfect. The butternut squash was not too sweet. I actually prefer it a little more sweet, more like yams. The balance between the amount of pasta dough and the squash was well proportioned though. The sauce was good and added to the dish. Nevertheless, it was nothing extraordinary. The fra diavolo sauce is what Giacomo's is known for, which is something for patrons to keep in mind. In addition, I saw a couple of tables that ordered the zuppa di pesce. They were massive plates of linguine that included 1/2 lobster, mussels, scallops, shrimp, scallops, and calamari. If you enjoy pasta and seafood, it is definitely a dish for you. It is supposed to be for 2 people but it looked like it can definitely feed 3.\\n\\nThe lines are long because the food is great and the restaurant is small. It was definitely a tiny, intimate space. The service was rapid fire fast. The food arrives quickly and you will feel hurried by the waitstaff. The waitress was ready to grab my plate as soon as I finished my last bite then gave my check in the same motion. It is understandable because they want to churn tables. Nevertheless, the always in a rush New Yorker in me enjoyed and appreciated it. I get annoyed with having to flag down inattentive staff for my check so I preferred the alternative. Regardless, there are generally long waits for Giacomo's and it is not a great spot for a group that wants to lounge and enjoy each other's company. If you go, understand that your primary mission is to eat great food.\\n\\nIf you are visiting and planning a trip to Boston and looking for recommendations (especially food), feel free to message me for my itinerary.

I ordered the ribeye medium rare and while it was really good, I was a little disappointed with the amount of fat on the steak.

For me the Salt Lick has always been that standard when it comes to Texas BBQ.  If fact, when I lived in Colorado I on occasion had their BBQ shipped to me.\\n\\nSome of the beauty of the Salt Lick is its country setting and outside ambiance.  They do not sell alcoholic drinks within their BBQ establishment, but you can purchase beer and wine next door at the Salt Lick Winery to bring in to the BBQ area if you so choose (a bucket of six Shiner beers = $10), where they also do wine tastings.  For bonus points, there is a Bocce court outside (only for adults) in the winery area.\\n\\nNow on to the best point--the food.  We did a family style dinner with about 12 people present and the food was endless.  Every time we finished off a plate, a new one arrived :)\\n\\nI had never had the ribs at the Salt Lick before and they were delicious.  The sausage was outstanding, and the brisket had great flavor and bark.  They actually brought out two types of brisket, a lean brisket, as well as a more moist and fatty brisket for those so inclined (raises hand)!\\n\\nThe table had two types of BBQ sauce and regular and a Habanero which were both quite good.\\n\\nThe sides were outstanding and included bread, onions, pickles, jalapenos, potato salad, and coleslaw.\\n\\nLastly came the cobbler with ice cream; I went with the peach which was above average. There was also blackberry which everyone raved about, and it was stated by several people who tried both that the blackberry was superior to the peach.\\n\\nAs we were leaving about six, the line had begun to get longer and longer to get in, and a live band was warming up to play some music.  It was hard to leave, but it surely won't be long until I return to the standard of all Texas BBQ, located in the heart of the Texas Hill Country!!"},{"name":"Reuben's Deli","address":"57 Broad St NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I was in on a short trip for work and read good reviews so I had to try it out.

For those of you who know me, you're probably pretty surprised. We actually tried to go to Toro but the 3.5 hr wait time led us down the block to Teranga, the city's only Senegalese restaurant. I was a little hesitant, but my hunger got the best of me and I gave in. \\n\\nThe place was really cute inside. On the smaller side with maybe 10-15 tables and a nice bar where people can also sit and eat. Dark wood, low lighting, and a comfortable atmosphere. The staff was super nice, especially since we asked a lot of questions about the menu. At the end of the night we even chatted with the owner/chef a bit and she was great. \\n\\nSince we were starving when we got there, we ordered a couple of appetizers - fataya and nems. Fataya are a pastry stuffed with fish (shell fish in case you're allergic) and the nems are spring rolls. Both were excellent. They each came with a sauce that had a little bit of a kick but it was manageable.\\n\\nFor entrees, they have 9 or 10 options, mainly lamb, fish and chicken dishes. I ordered the brochettes which is filet mignon on skewers and it came with yucca fries. The meat was cooked perfectly and the sauce was delicious. The other girls seems to enjoy their dishes as well. We were all raving about how happy we were to have ended up there. \\n\\nAs for prices, I thought they were pretty reasonable. My filet mignon dish was $16 and there was a decent amount of meat so I definitely feel like I got my money's worth.

Prior to we had planned to drive around Hill Country territory and making a stop at Salt Lick.  I was excited because I knew of all the hype that this place receives and the best BBQ I've ever had before coming here was at Rudy's. Oh my goodness, my life changed after Salt Lick was through with me.\\n\\nWe went during the weekend, which if you haven't already heard is probably the busiest time to go. The wait was around an hour - hour and a half or so, but we walked down to the winery to kill some time and give some wines a sample. Eventually when we were seated we had an entire big picnic bench to ourselves. A friend who has been here a few times already made some suggestions and I settled on one of their combo plates with lean brisket and sausage. The food came out fairly quick and at this point I was beyond starving. That first bite? GOOD LORD. Where have you been all my life, Salt Lick? Their BBQ sauce is the best and hands down my favorite BBQ sauce I've ever had. It has a sweet but not to sweet flavor to it that really compliments your meats. As for the brisket, it was incredibly moist and not dry at all, and the sausage was also very flavorful. My friend let me try some of their smoked turkey off of her plate, and I'm kind of picky about turkey because I usually have the general impression that it's going to be dry. But not this turkey, oh my goodness it was also very moist and tasty. The combo plate also comes with sides of potato salad, coleslaw and beans. Not a fan of beans so that usually goes barely touched but their potato salad is pretty good. For dessert, we had their peach cobbler with vanilla ice cream and seriously, what is air? Best peach cobbler I've ever had. It doesn't matter how full you are, one savory bite of the peach cobbler and all that goes out the window and next thin you know, you've practically inhaled the whole thing. The contrast of hot peaches and pie and the cold ice cream just melts in your mouth. I am always in food heaven after Salt Lick.\\n\\nThey also have other waiting areas besides the winery, especially for families with kids who aren't 21+. On weekends they usually have some live music and also sell fresh squeezed lemonade that they concoct themselves and popcorn just in case your borderline about to pass out either from the heat or hunger. The most recent time I went was with family from Jersey and we went on a Monday and it wasn't busy at all. So, if you want to avoid the wait then I suggest showing up on a weekday. As for the staff, every single time I've been here, everyone has been extremely friendly and attentive. One of my nephews broke one of the BBQ bottles with his toy monster truck and they were really nice about it. The first time I ever came here I wanted to take pictures of their BBQ pit and they encouraged us/let us go behind the counter to take a picture right in front of it. Really nice picture opportunity!\\n\\nI'm completely confident and satisfied with labeling Salt Lick as my favorite place to get BBQ and probably the best I've ever had in Texas.

Another staff member tried twice to bring out our entrees while we were still eating the salad.  The entrees were absolutely terrible. I'd like to give them the benefit of the doubt and chalk it up to the fact that the entrees sat under the lamps for a while until we finished the salad but I don't think that is the case.  We had the linguine which was too thick, served with canned asparagus and overcooked shrimp and the sauce was completely bland.  The Casarecci was slightly better but that's not a high standard. The past was too soft and the tomato sauce was completely bland. No flavor whatsoever: no salt, no garlic, nothing. The eggplant was cooked well but not well enough to save this dish.  The attire of the female employees was revolting.  A woman came and spoke to the table next to us and her dress was so short that her bum was almost completely exposed.

They only take CASH, come prepared because on one occasion my boyfriend had to run down the street to an ATM to get cash to pay the bill.\\n3. Guard your food with your life! Because these waiters will try to snatch it away when you're not paying attention in order to turn over tables quickly to accommodate the suffering customers outside (especially if it's cold, it sucks to wait outside). They will also bring things out fast and attempt to rush you through your meal, so if you're looking for a romantic spot go elsewhere because this is all about the food!!!\\n\\nAll in all if you're in Boston Giacomo's is an absolute must!

Back then, I thought this place was a little overpriced but the food was decent. This past Sunday when I came here for brunch with my husband, I had one of the worst brunch experiences I have ever had. I don't know if Trident has gone way downhill or if we were just unbelievably unlucky. Keep in mind as you read the following story, that the most horrible part of the entire brunch was the awful stuff they served us that they called 'iced lattes'.\\n\\nWe were seated very quickly when we arrived. However, after the hostess left us with our menus we didn't see another staff person for at least 10 minutes (not even in our general vicinity). Finally, after 10 minutes, a waiter came to our table to take our order. We ordered iced lattes, the breakfast skillet and the truck stop breakfast.  Incidentally, ordering REAL maple syrup for the 1 pancake in the truck stop breakfast costs an additional 2.50$.  It was after we placed our orders that I started to notice a steady stream of water coming out of the A/C unit right next to my husband's shoulder. At first it was just a trickle, but quickly a steady stream of water was making a huge puddle on the floor and splashing my husband's leg. As one of the waiters passed by, I grabbed him to point out the increasingly large problem. He nodded and walked away. Several minutes later, a different person (possible a manager) came to look at the problem. He turned off the a/c and mopped up the floor. At our table, there was still no sign of either our coffee or our food. \\n\\nStill waiting for our first cup of morning coffee, the conversation at our table was stilted at best.  Our general grogginess was not helped by the steadily increasing temperature in our section of the restaurant (due to the lack of a/c). Several minutes later, perhaps because of heat complaints, the same person who had originally turned off the a/c unit came to turn it back on. At first, it seemed that the dripping water had stopped. However, after several more minutes, there was again a steady stream of water coming out of the unit. Not only that, but as the waiters went by our table with food orders, the a/c water leak was dripping onto the plates! It was right about then, that the waiter finally brought our iced latte orders. \\n\\nThe iced lattes were a dark muddy brown color. They tasted like someone poured coffee (not espresso shots) that had been sitting on a burner for hours over a little ice and added a splash of milk. We both took a sip of our drinks, and despite being in desperate need of coffee realized that it was undrinkable. After several attempts at flagging down the waiter, we finally got his attention. Unfortunately he stopped to talk to us right under the a/c water leak and as we talked, his shirt was getting soaked. We explained that the iced 'lattes' brought to us were undrinkable and we were returning them. He looked at us, looked up at the gushing water and without a word turned around and left our table. \\n\\nMy husband and I stared at each other in disbelief. We didn't know why the waiter had left or what he was planning to do. We contemplated just leaving the restaurant, but at this point we had been waiting over 30 minutes for our food and we were starving. Several minutes passed, and a different waiter came to our table. He had heard we didn't like the lattes had also been told about the water problem. He suggested we move tables (so my husband would no longer be splashed by the water) and also agreed to take the lattes back. He asked if we wanted them to remake the lattes...we both declined.\\n\\nVery quickly after this our food order arrived. The pancake in the truck stop breakfast was very good as was the apple-chicken sausage in the breakfast skillet. Other than the sausage, the breakfast skillet was rather bland and under seasoned. The check was brought to us, and thankfully they had removed the lattes from our order. The overall breakfast was still very expensive considering the uninspired food and terrible experience.\\n\\nThe two most astounding things about our experience are that 1) a brunch/breakfast place would have such terrible coffee and that 2) when I looked at yelp (afterwards) I saw someone had experienced the leaking a/c THE DAY BEFORE we went there.\\n\\nI won't be back to eat at Trident cafe."},{"name":"Taqueria Villanueva","address":"281 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Nice food cart next to PSU campus.

The cortado on the other hand was excellent. It would seem that with how river maiden pulls shots and stumptown's espresso, that about 3oz of steamed milk is spot on. Very caramelly and sweet and surprisingly a bit more richness than the espresso.
