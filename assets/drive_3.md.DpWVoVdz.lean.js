A knuckle sandwich. One of our favs! Yay! The days of cash only are over -- they TAKE CREDIT/DEBIT now!! Though the place seriously has a DUDE vibe (which is WAY better on the days when they play metal or classic rock than on the pop or trance days) we come as a family for lunch all the time. We LOVE it! Decadent, tasty old skool sandwiches (forget uber fancy ingredients) all served up on fresh Pearl bakery rolls and bread. We always want to branch out but I can't seem to get out of the clutches of the siren's call of the Burnside (House roasted beef, jalape√±os, red peppers, cheese whiz, crispy onions and pickles) so delish. If you're like me and a total wuss when it comes to heat (though, I have toughed it out a fews times because the jalape√±os do add an awesome kick!) you can order this without the jalape√±os and get a mild version of this unforgettable sandwich. The tender au jus soaked beef and onion strings make this sandwich, as does the cheez whiz (sometimes you just need to go trailer park!) The hubs always gets the east sider (neck-and-neck with Bunk for the best Italian sub in town) it's sopresatta, capicola, proscuitto, genoa salami, mortadella, provolone, lettuce, roma tomato, red onion, pickle, olive oil, red wine vinegar and Mama Lil's Peppers all on a Pearl hoagie. (He hasn't been able to venture past this little baby either.) The fries are great, thin, crisp, served in a big basket and be sure to get the ketchup in the squirt bottle -- like old 50's diners serve -- allowing you to get the best ketchup to fry ratio ever in the history of man. The chili also gets high marks (though it IS spicy) it is big chunks of succulent beef, rich and yummy you can get it on your fries as well. Our kiddo gets the grilled cheese with cheddar & mozzarella and it is a real treat on their sourdough. In addition, to sandwiches they have burgers, breakfast sandwiches, hot dogs, PB & J  and even a burger with peanut butter on it.

The place was crowded but the line moved quickly. A staffer periodically shouted back to everyone as to how everything worked: side dishes are cafeteria style; you get two. (I sent a photo to make my Texas-born friend jealous and he wrote back, \\"Nothing says Texas BBQ like styrofoam plates.\\" Actually they were some sort of recycled cardboard thing -- this is the new millennium, after all -- but the concept still stands: three separate compartments like a lunch tray.)Then you move along to the meat stations where you can claim your protein of choice. I was a little surprised that they didn't have pulled pork (yes, I know it's not the traditional Texas BBQ, but most places do have it, after all), so I went with brisket, which isn't usually my bag but in Texas you know it'll be good. Well, it was. In fact, I got there as the carving guy was pulling out a fresh, unsliced piece. The spiced surface called out temptingly. And it lived up to its look: tender and flavorful. I chose the creamed corn (real cream, clearly) and macaroni and cheese (not my favorite ever, but I still wouldn't kick this off the plate). I rounded things out with a local beverage: Austin Eastciders Texas Honey (the sweetest of the three varietals I tried while in town, and the best IMO). For dessert I picked up a mini pecan pie: gooey, not too sweet and loaded with nuts, it was the perfect finish to a Texas meal. Terry Black's apparently has enough of a following that they have t-shirts and whatnot for you to buy; there's also a penny smashing machine as you come inside! There's also enough of a following that parking is at a serious premium, even early in the evening, but we were lucky to score a spot out front!

FLIP is a great experience--trendy with a good looking staff and a cool bar--but the food is definitely overrated.  The turkey burger is my favorite (boring!), but the more interesting burgers have not tasted as good as they sound.  The fried sides are bland, but the potato salad and the caesar salads are good.  Definitely try the milkshakes, but do not expect to be blown away by any of them, especially the Krispy Kreme one.  It tastes like a blended donut--not really my idea of a creative or tasty spin on a milkshake.  I liked the pistachio milkshake as well as the one with the burnt marshmallows, but the idea of the liquid nitrogen shake is actually better in theory.  Its pretty unspectacular in person.The location is odd with a bad parking situation (you will probably have to park across the street and cross over four lanes of busy traffic without a crosswalk), but its worth taking a trek just for the adventure.  The bad part is if you want to go for cocktails afterward, you do not have the option of strolling down the street to another bar.

To be fair, I've had a lot of ramen and I'm picky, but I would eat a bag of dehydrated Sapporo Ichiban over this any day.

Look through the pictures and you'll see a lot of bowls come with a small mountain of green onions and my bowl looked like one of those. It wasn't a sprinkling of green onions to round out the flavor, it was a substantial fistful of green onions trying to make up for the flavorless broth. The noodles were ok, slightly hard and lacking the proper chewy texture.

Very modern Asian inspired interiors. Popular with the younger set. Food: We ordered a series of different dishes. First we began with the Spring Rolls, which were filled with chopped vegetables and served alongside a tangy dipping sauce. The sauce is reason alone to order these, sort of vinegary but in a way that is not overtly so. The spring rolls themselves are crispy and delicious as well. \\n  Then we went with Ming's Market Greens which consisted of saut√©ed Chinese mustard greens with fermented tofu. The tofu acts as a sort of sauce providing creaminess as well as flavor. My friend loved this one, however I found it almost too salty. \\n  Then onto one of my personal favorites Hakka Eggplant which was basically classic Chinese braised eggplant. The eggplant was fresh and slightly sweet with a soft texture and light caramelization. Pretty typical but very delicious. \\n  Then the Asian Braised Soft Tacos which I found to be the least interesting and impressive of all the dishes we tried. The pork filling along with an herby salsa and pear slaw are double wrapped in two soft shell corn tortillas. This was definitely one of the heavier dishes and one I feel we could have done without. The shredded pork was slightly tangy yet sweet at the same time. The herb salsa was surprisingly spicy and the pear slaw added more sweetness. I understand the concept of mixing different flavor profiles to create something more interesting, however I don't think this one translated well. \\n   Lastly we ordered the Fried Chicken and Waffles, which was absolutely amazing. The chicken was covered in a crispy crunchy exterior seasoned with Asian spices while the meat was moist and juicy.

Less than 10 minutes from entering the restaurant we were eating our spring rolls and sipping hot tea. I had the pho with brisket and eye round. The great thing about pho is you can ease yourself into the spicyness. Add a couple of jalapeos and sri racha, and then keep on adding until you can't stand it. The broth was perfect. I've had a lot of pho that didn't have a lot of flavor, but this had a good balance of sweet and salty. The brisket was tender, but the eye round was on the chewy side. I ordered the large size and there was way too much food; enough for several meals.  He had the bun with pork. I had a little taste and it was fabulous. It was definitely something I'd order if we visited again.

A recent visit there was so disappointing that I will not be going back, neither will the various organizations for which I coordinate meetings and events. We had a reservation for 11 at the start of the lunch service, I was the first customer there, arriving 5 minutes before my 11:15am reservation in order to review the menu at the table and be at the table to welcome/start the party.   I was told in no uncertain terms by the hostess that I wasn't allowed to sit at my reserved table until all guests had arrived (very odd policy which I'd never encountered there before, or in other venues), which I summarily dismissed and said \\"that's okay, I'll go sit there anyway, as I made the reservation.\\"  :D  I settled in to the large table, and within minutes the male owner strode up and sternly announced I was not allowed to sit there, lol.  Not only did he not back off when I said I preferred to the welcome my guests at my table,  he continued on with the absurd performance.  Being a mature woman,  I smilingly and demurely refused to budge, stating I'd been a customer for many years, and had never encountered a problem sitting at my own table,  thank you very much!   He seriously huffed that he would let me get away with it this one time, but not again.  LOL.  After he left, I realized the rest of my party was seated in the waiting area, meekly obeying the stern hostess.  I collected them, we had a good laugh about it.  But this is really poor management style, and downright control-freak behavior centered on a peculiar psyche, not on good business (the customer is right, man, etc.).   Well, HE is no longer receiving the estimated $3.5K that my matronage has brought his establishment on a yearly basis with various groups and small lunch meetings. Gone.  And not only will my experience live on through my incredible word-of-mouth Austin network, this is a permanent boycott with untold lost streams of potential new business for Clay Pit.    It's easy enough to forego Pseudo-Indian and instead focus on more authentic and fresh G'Raj Mahal Cafe on Red River for an upscale downtown experience, for those times when you when you can't make it to south Congress's super-authentic New India Cafe.

The breakfast tacos taste all right, but if I eat more than one, I almost always get a stomach ache.  And the fajita tacos on the lunch/dinner menu are gooey and drippy and just gross.Fortunately, there are many others who like Taco Shack and can help it carry on the success it's enjoyed thus far.This location literally has ONE very tiny table inside that you really do not want to try to sit at, because people will be constantly bumping into you as they try to crowd into the interior to keep their place in line.  There are a few picnic tables outside, but it seems like most of this location's clientele gets their tacos to go.  I have to hand it to the owners of this place for keeping this location open even after opening their much bigger/swankier location just a stone's throw away on Lamar.

I am literally in love with this burger. I didn't even think that was possible.First time I ventured out to Hopdoddy, I was a little shocked with the length of the waiting line. It was out the door and around the building. I was conflicted on whether or not to wait it out or find somewhere else to dine. Really, how could any place be worth this long of a wait? Luckily, I stayed put, and boy was I sure glad I did. Once I took my first bite of the Magic Shroom burger, my frustration and irritation from waiting simply melted away.After my visit, I raved about this place to anyone that could/would listen to me. It is usually one of my \\"have-to-visit\\" places when I am in town now. Believe me, I have been here PLENTY. Granted, I am a HUGE burger fan.The actual wait in line lasts maybe 40 minutes to a little under an hour? It varies on the day and time. They offer water outside to keep you hydrated as you wait. Unfortunately, there is no shade outside so be warned! Once you get inside, there is another line to the counter. A waiter/waitress will approach you in line to assign you a slip with your table number, which you will give to the cashier when you place your order. Thankfully the wait for food is not long, 10-15 minutes usually. The burgers are pretty huge. I have sampled the Primetime, Goodnight, Llano Poblano, Terlingua, Ahi Tuna, and La Bandita. Though they are all good, the Magic Shroom is my favorite hands down. I love the flavoring. That basil pesto! Mmm! I am drooling just thinking about it.Oh!

At the urging of my companion, I caught the attention of a man who appeared to be a manager or assistant manager and told him about what happened. I was trying to be nice about it and not cause a stink, but he needed to know. His first response was, \\"Are you sure?\\" and then he looked down at the napkin in my lap as if insinuating that I had eaten my own napkin and not realized it. I'm sorry, but the customer is always right. I know I didn't eat my own napkin, I'm not an idiot. So I was offended by his dismissal of the situation. He gave me a half-assed apology and walked away with my plate. I was really offended so I grabbed another man who seemed to be the manager in charge and told him about how rude the first man was and how my complaint was virtually dismissed. He was very receptive and apologetic and went off to talk to the first man. The first man came back and offered me a $5 gift certificate for my next visit, never apologized for the way he treated me, and basically told us to get lost. It is a shame that I never want to go back because the food was good (I'm a food writer!) but the way I was treated and the fact that I found a non-food item in my food was highly disappointing.

Walking in on Wednesday night, we thought we'd found the coolest, new place that might become a date-night staple. At 7, the place was packed; we got seated in about 15 minutes. The sleek, white decor is great. There are big tables for four, and we assumed they would have us share a table with another couple of diners, but they didn't. There are also fun-looking booths for 6-8 and you can eat at the bar. While waiting, we already decided to have the vodka battered onion rings and the asparagus tempura.Once seated, we first encountered drink issues. Every other full bar in town carries non-alcoholic beer. Flip does not. My other half ordered an apple martini (I assert there is no such thing, but that's another story) and, without warning, it came with the glass rim dipped in cinnamon. Once he wiped it off, he said it was okay.We ordered the Po Boyger, a burger made of shrimp bound with a small amount of mayonaisse, and the Southern, a beef burger usually country fried (we asked for just a regular beef patty) with pimento cheese and green tomato catsup. Also the onion rings and asparagus.There was a bit of a wait on the food and I realised they don't crowd the tables because the kitchen couldn't handle that volume. Finally, the food arrived. The shrimp burger was sublime, and we'll be tempted to go back at some point just to have one again in spite of everything else. Yet the beef burger arrived rare, even though the server had not asked us how we wanted it cooked. I like rare and thought it perfect, but most would have sent it back.  And the burgers are so small--the size your mother used to cook for lunch when you were little.The asparagus tempura, laced with fresh dill was awesome! The onion rings were good, too. Each had a dipping sauce. The portions weren't meager but they could have used more.While we were eating, the manager flitted by and said, \\"Everything okay guys?\\" without looking us in the eye or stopping so we could say more than \\"Yes.\\"The food was good and different but for $8, to offer such a small burger with no sides is a bit much. The sides are about $4. So it's basically a $12 burger, unless you spring for the $45 Japanese kobe burger. Had they served french fries with the little burgers, we'd have still ordered the sides and then left satisfied. (Even better would be to bring diners fries while waiting on the burgers and sides.) You can order a milkshake for dessert, but if you want something solid and sweet to get you to full--I was craving a  decadent brownie--forget it.Nice try, but next time I want to fill up on a good hamburger, this foodie is going to Five Guys."},{"name":"Bukhara Indian Bistro","address":"3698 Washington St","city":"Jamaica Plain","stars":"3.5","text":"I'm a sucka for buffets.

The staff was very friendly and welcoming.I heard a lot of hype about the restaurant, before coming in.  Maybe it raised my expectations a bit too high, but it was just a tad over exaggerated.Even so, the food was still great.  My Oaxaca burger tasted excellent (although the burger itself became a bit messy because they keep the top bun off initially), and the Krispy Kreme shake added a sugary touch to the meal.  Among my table, the nutella shake was excellent, but I heard that the foie gras shake was very similar to an average vanilla shake.

It had octopus, imitation crab meat, tobiko on the outside of the roll, and cucumbers. It wasn't amazing, but edible. The noodle soup consisted of bok choy, cabbage, squid rings, a couple of large scallops and shrimps and what I believe was salted fish? When it said seafood I'm assuming it's all of those things excluding fish. Maybe it's just me, but I'm still confused as to whether fish is seafood. Don't mind me just having a moment here. Again the soup wasn't like wow amazing, but it was filling. I'm not sure why they put cabbage, it doesn't seem like it belongs.

The lady greeted us right away but started out by offering us a seat in the bar. Finally she said if we were interested in a table, she'd get someone else to help us. Huh? Why would she not be able to seat us and why would she not offer all options upfront? So we waited for the 2nd guy, who took us to a table then made us walk back to the front because he hadn't checked to make sure it was actually ready. Other than that he was pleasant.Our waitress was there in seconds asking us if we wanted to order. She was blustery but friendly and we ordered drinks but had to slow her down as we had just sat down & hadn't even looked at the menu. From the start we felt rushed.The pork belly came right away, which was 3 bites on a small skewer. Not sure how this is shareable, or why you'd do it in 3 pieces so that it wouldn't divide evenly. We love small plates but please, explain either on the menu or to the customer when ordering how big or small things are - i.e., for these people should order 2 so each person could have their own skewer. We got the chicken meatball (yes that is singular) which we had to cut in half. Without sauce it had no flavor, and with it, it was like drinking a bottle of soy sauce in just one bite, that's how salty it was. Yikes. We got one bao bun (again, not easily shareable, tell people to order two) which the meat innards were quite tasty but the bun itself seemed a bit undercooked as it was soggy.When we'd ordered, we'd let her know it was our first time and asked to explain things on the menu, but neither the menu nor she said the veggie appetizer was a Japanese hot pepper (the description mentioned bacon and cheese). I have a sensitive tummy and when my husband bit into it he was in serious pain, so he called over another waitress (because after our original served us she disappeared and every time we tried to signal her she didn't seem to see us...which was an indicator of things to come, unfortunately).  This new lady started out by telling us \\"oh it's only 1 in 10 peppers that are that hot\\" (as if somehow after burning his mouth the first time he's going to want to take another bite) but agreed to take it back and get us tempura instead. Then we waited. And waited. Our original waitress never came back, and when you're sitting at the table for 10-15 minutes, drinks long finished, no food on the table, water almost gone, and no one comes by to at least get you a refill or let you know when your last food item would be arriving, you get a bit frustrated - especially as you're so hungry and she said we could order in stages! We had wanted to order the burger next that was recommended - which by the way was $14 plain or $19 with bacon and a fried egg, so we were planning to share as there's no way in hell we'd be paying $30-40 for two burgers) but never got the chance.Did I mention one of the men on staff was less than 4 feet from our table standing there doing nothing looking out over where we sat? He had stains all over his pants and we were so uncomfortable as it felt like he could hear every word we were saying. If you're on break, dude, go somewhere else, don't stand next to a table (and if you're not, and you see customers frequently looking around for a waitperson with nothing on their table, maybe you should see if they need anything!).After no service for far too long (while they were bustling all around a large party next to us), we decided we weren't ordering more and approached the other lady (the one who we ordered the tempura from, who was now standing next to the man we just mentioned) because we still didn't have the tempura, so we asked for our check. Her first reaction was defensive\\" \\"well the tempura takes a lot longer to cook\\" (as if we would somehow know that when no one said when we ordered that it takes longer than the rest of their food & no one ever checked in on us), and when we said nicely that we haven't seen our waitress, gotten any refills, or a chance to order anything else, we just want our check, she walked over to that man, who walked to the kitchen and started grabbing food (that's how we realized he was staff, yikes). She came back and said the order would be on the house and apologized. We also let her know that the guy standing right by our table had made us super uncomfortable, and that we love Bamboo as a whole but this experience tonight was pretty bad. We're willing to go back to the sushi-focused locations, but this izakaya just didn't cut it service or quality-wise. There is better izakaya in town."},{"name":"Medina Cafe","address":"780 Richards Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"I read some great reviews on yelp and decided to try out this place.

She had the fish and chips lunch box which is good value for the price.  Only one pc of fish, but the sides really spruced up the meal.  I had the Coast Signature Burger because I was attracted to the lobster poutine side.  The burger was not bad, not great, but the lobster poutine made me sad.  No bisque gravy, just a bit of lobster, so very meh.  I know it's just a side portion but if that's a mini version of the appetizer I wouldn't order that appetizer.  My husband wound up with the worst dish.  At first he wanted to order the beef tenderloin but opted for red snapper instead as Coast is a seafood resto.  When the snapper came there was no wow in the presentation.  Just a piece of grilled fish on plain white beans.  The disappointment was showing clearly on his face when he was eating the dish.  The snapper had no flavor, the bean ragout was dry as well.  Overall dry dish.  Will not order that or any of the seafood dishes ever again.  And just to erase the bad experience of that dish we ordered the sushi feature.  Now that was a winner.  Should've gone with that in the first place.

I accidentally swallowed one before I could stop it from going down--it was soup, so I just wasn't expecting to swallow a cocktail sword--at that moment I didn't worry too much about it, although it definitely was sharp as it scratched the side of my throat--but I thought since this was Eddie V's that my bisque must have just been made fresh and I happened to get a rare piece of claw cartilage .Then I had another bite and felt what seemed like a bone, which shellfish don't have, so I pulled it out.  It was 2 inch long sharp metal spiral, painted on one side and shiny on the other.  I realized it was also the same size of the piece I had just swallowed.  These spirals can come off when you open one of those 10\\" diameter soup cans with a restaurant-size electric can opener--it also means there could be a lot more of those in their soup pot back in the kitchen.The bartender apologized and took it back to the kitchen immediately, but I expected something like that to prompt a manager to come out, and hopefully pick up any other patrons' crab bisque as well as a precaution.  Something like that not being handled properly can and should end a restaurant.  It may have been embarrassing, but metal shards in food is potentially life threatening since it has to travel through 7 meters of small intestines making hundreds of turns along the way there's a lot of opportunity to slice or puncture and cause internal bleeding.  It's at least going to make some cuts on the way out.  While death from punctures is statistically rare, dishing out a hundred bowls of soup will up your chances of killing someone's grandma at her birthday dinner and making your new remodel a great location for someone else's restaurant.The soup was taken off the bill, but instead of just generously comping the $9 bowl of metal bisque, they probably should have comped the $43 dollar glass of Macallan 18 sitting next to it (that's half the wholesale price of the bottle btw).  Or maybe even my whole meal since all I was going to leave with was anxiety over what the hell I just ate.I had already broken into a sweat as I pondered the only way this little sword was going exit, so I wasn't concerned with being comped at the time, and since I figured there was more metal in the big pot in the kitchen I declined the offer of another bowl.  I was actually more worried about all the old people eating in there--I pictured some sweet old lady (sorry but it's an older crowd) screaming in the bathroom the next day.  Turns out I was the only one worried.  A manager never came out.  If a server comes back to the kitchen holding up a 2 inch twist of metal found by a patron that should be treated like they found a 2 inch cockroach doing the backstroke in their soup.  It's a big deal.  If it's not, then you must be used to seeing some pretty messed up stuff in your kitchen.  I should have heard a solid Gordon Ramsey impression in the kitchen from where I was sitting but nothing happened.I had already decided I wasn't coming back ever again though, since I clearly valued this restaurant a lot more than they valued me, so instead of ordering my usual bone-in filet and another scotch I went with fish and a Stella.In the end, the best thing about my dinner was the one thing I already had in my own refrigerator at home, Stella.If anyone else thinks they ate metal in their bisque be sure to drink plenty of water, avoid meat, bananas, peanut butter and nuts; have a salad, actually have several; have 3 tablespoons of mineral oil mixed with yogurt before bed; get yourself some stool softeners; and when it's time to go, strap in tight and bite down on something.  Otherwise you might just cut your o-ring in half when that bad boy exits.  Good luck friends and remember, what doesn't kill you only makes you stronger."},{"name":"Leaky Roof","address":"1538 SW Jefferson St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Extremely indifferent service.

When I don't know what I want, I usually stick with the house special chow mein.   Not bad for a chow mein made by a caucasion chef!  LOL.

First of all, what is up with the current fixation on calling everything a \\"boutique\\"? Like when I visited the Blush Lounge in Vegas, which billed itself as a \\"boutique\\" nightclub. I guess it's a way to let people know that you'll get something new, trendy and exciting in a somewhat small and cozy location. That's how I can sum up my lunch experience at Flip Burger Boutique: new, trendy and exciting. I'm not sure how long this restaurant will last, but I think it's a great new edition to Howell Mill in Atlanta's upper west side. The decor is plush, the atmosphere is loungey elegance and the food is pretty darn good. I tried the rBq, which was a perfectly cooked burger with pulled pork brisket on top with some cole slaw. It was amazing! I added a side of the vodka onion rings and was able to try the fries and fried rutabaga. All were very good especially the onion rings that I dipped in the chipotle-smoked mayonnaise. Service was pretty good for the place only being opened for a couple weeks. I was disappointed that I didn't get to try the sweet potato tots. The waiter explained that since many people were complaining about how long it was taking to get the sides, they decided to only offer certain things for dinner. I was also bummed that Chef Blais had already left on holiday break, so I wasn't able to meet him but we did get to chat it up with the owner who explained why he chose the location instead of somewhere in Midtown (for a free-standing building). But either way, I'll definitely be back to check out the evening crowd and some more burgers and a nitrogen milkshake -- the Shrimp Po Boyger and Krispy Kreme shake look really good! P.S. WARNING: Do not come here looking for massive burgers. They are like the size of two sliders put together with at least 1/4 pound of meat. If you are starving, you might want to order two burgers.. However, I found myself adequately full from a burger and a side."},{"name":"Navarre","address":"10 NE 28th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Showed up at 7:30ish and while there were a few tables open (good start considering no reservations), got stuck at the table right next to the entry way (my seat was actually in the walkway so when people came in or left, it was uncomfortable).  Overall, the first impression was terrible with being stuck in the aisle, the temperature was blazing in the place and the waitstaff didn't come by to greet us or describe how the menu worked for quite a while (not that we couldn't figure it out, but just not overly attentive). The wine list was nice because you could get most wines by the glass, quarter, half or full bottles.  This deserves more like 4-5 stars.  We had a glass of Cava each to start and then a nice Pinot in half bottle (which was perfect).  We had bread (B- seemed burnt), olive oil (B just okay), cheese plate (B could have been an A with better description of what we got and maybe something like quince paste or almonds or hazelnuts etc), mushrooms(C- button mushrooms that seemed like they were from a can, not what I expected considering the time of year), Buffalo (B but only because I love Buffalo, nothing inventive here, also oddly presented sliced in a pile with a lemon wedge garnsih), Quail (A, the only really good dish), Beets and Tomatos (B-), Kale and Pecans (B).  All in, we ended up at $95 before tip.  Overall, terrible seating (I don't mind close, but close and in a walkway is taking it over the line), mediocre food, good wine choices, bad temp control and mediocre waitstaff (although not bad enough to doc the tip).I'd pass unless you just have to try it for yourself."},{"name":"El Chilito","address":"2225 Manor Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I used to really like them I they deserve more stars on their food alone.

The pizza was one of the better ones I've tried north of Long Island.  The wood fired oven gave it a nice character yet it hasn't charred like some tend to be.  It was slightly pricey for 2 slices of pizza at $7.49 but given the high end fresh ingredients they were using it seemed fairly reasonable.

For a town steeped in great food culture, what I have always found lacking we're the burgers. Too many places try to 'gourmet' the hell out of them and you get these abominations on artisan buns with dry meat. Not at Killer Burger! I have eaten all of their burgers at 4 different locations and I still proclaim them the best burger in Portland...and if you make the Fun Guy a Fatty...you've got THE BEST BURGER I've ever eaten in my life! It's stupid, ridiculous delicious! To those who whine about the burgers being greasy...really? Isn't that the point of a burger? It's ground up meat and fat with cheese and bacon...it's a cardiologist's nightmare! If grease is your concern go get a tempeh sandwich at Veggie Grill (which with all of the processing it takes to make veggies look live a burger can't be that healthy either...)...but don't critique a burger joint with regards to grease. Cumulatively, I have eaten at 4 different Killer Burgers @ 50 times...this one, the first on the west side is just as good as the other locations...bigger space, brighter lighting, same GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE, same GREAT TASTING BURGERS, and of course, BOTTOMLESS FRIES! Though honestly, with the size of their burgers...I doubt you will eat a second serving! Lightly salted and served straight from the fryer, these crispy fries are served with a plethora of dipping options...personally, I like to mix mayo with sriacha...nom nom nom! And of course, their beautiful rotating taps! Great LOCAL brews at a great local price. There is nothing to HATE about Killer Burger...except that maybe there are some patrons who think an east coast chain's thin ass patty burger that will run you the same price as a burger with bottomless fries is somehow superior to this locally owned business serving up locally brewed suds...Dude...get with it!

The restaurant has high celling, dark wood bar in the center, it has the old traditional look with the mix of contemporary style, very inviting friendly atmosphere.I ordered a crawfish etouffee and bison burger with garlic rosemary fries, crawfish etouffee was like an open faced crawfish croquette, it was very creamy and very tasty, crawfish, onion and peppers in cream sauce over a grit cake, I would love to order this again on my next visit.Then the bison burger came, double stacked bison burger on a toasted sesame bun, served with garlic rosemary french fries but also came with a ranch dipping sauce for the fries, I'm not a big fan of ranch, but this was the best ranch dipping sauce I ever had. French fries looked homemade, the bison burger was juicy, as I bite in to the burger and the juice flowed out, mmmmmmI was told that everything they serve is made from scratch even the dipping sauce, also explained most breads are baked at the restaurant, but some like the toasted sesame bun was purchased from local bakery.Friendly staff, great food, I'm a fan!I'll come back again for sure and try other things on the menu.

I had heard people rave about the food here, especially the hangar steak. The food wasn't bad but there was something lacking. The soup was a bit on the watery side and was missing that rich beef broth flavor. The croquettes had a nice light crust but only if you ate them right away. And so on. Some people talk about this place like it's the Vij's of French cuisine. Not quite.For the price price point, the experience, and the nice little strip of shops I wouldn't rule out another go-round, but for the lack of je ne sais quoi I can't really give it more than a 3-star A-OK."},{"name":"FLIP burger boutique","address":"1587 Howell Mill Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Chorizo burger and Butcher's Cut burgers are good.

Small, well decorated, a pleasant casual rustic space.  Varied music felt just right and at the right volume to add to the feel of the place.  Very friendly and efficient wait staff.  Helpful picking out beer/wine from a very interesting list.  Professional and unobtrusive at presenting and clearing plates.  On \\"communal tables\\" couples are separated with space and a centerpiece , making the seating more private and roomier than  the old school style of closely lining up a row of small 2-top tables.  Well done, don't be concerned with the \\"communal\\" comments in other reviews.  No choices, other than checking on any food allergies.  You're there to pick your beer/wine and get fed.  Good timing between courses,  Pretty much the same short pause between each course.  14 courses in just at 2 hours felt like a pleasant relaxed and not too long dinner, and the courses though small were enough to feel like we'd had a solid meal by the end.  Every dish was good; some amazing, some just interesting, and all were well thought out with quality ingredients interestingly presented.  All in all a very nice dining experience.  Glad they do reserves, there is no place to wait for a table.  We didn't see any party having to wait more than a few minutes to be seated during prime dining time on a Saturday night.

Would you like a baby dandelion seed encrusted Hawaiian sugarcane donut with a lion tear glaze? How about a Tahitian coconut muddled in Flora de Cana rum atop a seasonal pine nut fritter? All so fancy feathers!I went for the pumpkin pecan pudding donut for $3. It was good not great. It didn't have a ton of holiday pumpkin flavor and it had a grand total of 3 pecans on it. The inside pudding was a bit too tart. I am sure there are some wins here. A couple things stuck me as unnerving. 1. I wish they served espresso. Don't even start in with me about trying to be a donuts and coffee place. 2. The service. No one was really nice. They took a long time to get to me, and I was alone in the shop just standing there like I enjoyed drooling on myself in hunger throws. 3. Mainstream urban rap, whatever. Call me old fashioned but a sound system blaring middle of the road rap that yells over and over how they don't give a f#ck doesn't make any of you lily white urban cowboys any cooler. Stick to listening to it in your cars or during times kids aren't trying to enjoy their little treats. This would also go for any other music that isn't conducive to little kids who hit this spot at this time. Honestly after the kids go I don't care if you serve donuts in bikinis while exclaiming your nips never felt harder then when you came up with the idea that kombucha drizzled curry paste made an excellent donut topping.I get this is donut for grownups but kids still were in and out of this place.In the end, I won't be back. It's a place to try but it isn't a place I would even take an out of town visitor unless I was really phoning in their visit. Reminds me so much of how gourmet cupcake places have become.

My man ordered the brisket sandwich and was unhappy with how fatty it was. He also had the same mushy slaw.

Since my initial review of Casa Maria, I've been back for breakfast, and subsequently ordered items from the bakery.For breakfast I had the migas plate, which was fresh and perfect. The beans weren't your typical refried plop of brown, they actually had intact whole beans goin' on. My husband ordered a Corona, and it came out with a tall, frosted pint glass with a salted rim and a lime wedge. Nice! His menudo was quite tasty, and usually I HATE menudo. Something about the texture of tripe just throws me WAY off. Our waitress brought out the usual salsa, and said, \\"...unless you want the hotter sauce.\\" At the same time, we both replied, \\"YES!\\"\\"Do you want the green or the red?\\"\\"Both?\\" We looked at each other, our mouths salivating with anticipation, eyes wide. Turns out, the \\"green\\" is almost the same concoction as the \\"green crack sauce\\" many Yelpers have experienced at El Pollo Rico (Regio). Very spicy, and creamy. The red was a smoky, dark brown guajillo salsa that complimented the potatoes on my plate nicely. Later we asked our waitress what they call the \\"crack sauce,\\" and she said they call it \\"apocado\\". She even named all of the ingredients, and my husband and I looked at each other smugly, as we think we had just been given a secret family recipe. From the bakery I ordered a couple of pastries and an order of flan. The pastries were just OK later on at home, but the real winner was my flan. It's a HUGE order, delicately sweetened and swimming in a pool of sticky caramel sauce. Yum!As a side note, I really don't give two hoots about the weird decor in Casa Maria.

Cool little spot to grab a drink and a snack at the bar, but I wouldn't come very hungry."},{"name":"The COOP: A Southern Affair","address":"610 W Morse Blvd","city":"Winter Park","stars":"3.5","text":"I guess I should start by saying I'm not a fan of Four Rivers, so as much hype I've heard about this place, u came in with a semi open mind. When I walked in the door I saw that the line was backed up all the way to the door; another reminisce of Four Rivers. Let get to my breakdown....Decor: To me decor is huge. The way a restaurant flows and looks effects its efficiency, so it should be a huge focus. From start to finish I think they do a great job. The door starts you off by blatantly saying that if the line continues out the door to leave it shut so that the air conditioning can operate properly. I'm sorry, did you read my mind?... (pet peeve alert). The dining room sort of has a country chic vibe: mix matched chairs and rustic wood top tables. The colors used have a nice pop without being jarring and welcoming without putting you to sleep. They should give their decorator a raiseService: Because of the cafeteria style setting I'm not sure I can fairly judge this category. There's no greeter so it is merely understood by the partition that one is to stand in line and pick what you want before you get to the counter. There are hand held menus available to peruse while you're in the line, which is so convenient. The servers behind the counter will let you sample the food if you ask but aside from them there is really little interaction with the staff. You get your own refills and bus you own table. A positive note is that every table we walked by looked clean so there must be someone wiping down the tables and returning them to order. So.....service? I guess you can call it minimal chances of a good or bad experience; which is just fine for me.Food: I got the chicken and waffles. If I were to judge from the pictures from others, it looked excellent. The chicken was on point. Probably the best I've tasted; like someone took a Chick-fil-A chicken strip and finally added some salt and pepper. The breading was crisp and crunchy with jut the right amount of seasoning. It was boneless and still retained its moisture. Then I cut into my waffle, and my big red balloon was popped. The waffle was a total let down. I'm not sure if it was the amount of syrup or the fact that the pour the syrup on for you but it was a soggy mess. No crunch, no flavor, nothing. It was awful. My boyfriend got the chicken pot pie. I had half of his plate and he had half of mine. I only have one complaint, the crust. A true pot pie, in my humble opinion, has crust on the bottom and top. This pot pie, while excellent,  only had crust on the top. The chicken was so good, maybe a little tough, but that's only if I'm being picky. The vegetables in the pot pie were nice and chunky and tender. The second let down were the sides. Why don't people understand that your sides are not afterthoughts?! They are just as important if not more than the entree. The Coop just like Four Rivers, had neglected their sides. They were awful. Unseasoned, horrible textured and definitely the weakest link of the dish. The cornbread was extremely dry and had no flavor, the macaroni and cheese had no flavor and was gummy in texture, and the broccoli was over powered by the shallot butter. My broccoli should never taste like onions. The hush puppies were good but the other sides just ruined the whole dish for me.Overall I don't think I would return to the Coop. I wouldn't mind paying the inflated prices if the food was good. But there's too many shortcomings for me to recommend this place to anyone. Yes the food reminded me somewhat of my childhood. But it also reminded me the reason I don't eat this type of food in a restaurant, not everyone can throw down like Paula Deen.

I declare Blue Star the winner.If you're debating whether to go to Voodoo or Blue Star, go to Blue Star twice.On our first visit (because yes, I went twice in 24 hours), we bought a half dozen to share amongst me, the hubs, and our five year old. We squeezed ourselves into a corner along the window and stood there and devoured all six on the spot. We tried one each of blueberry bourbon basil, buttermilk old fashioned, Valrhona chocolate crunch, creme br√ªl√©e, Key lime & lemon curd filled, and maple bacon. All were amazing. My favorite was the blueberry bourbon basil. The blueberry and basil flavors in particular really come through and are a fantastic pair. The chocolate crunch is so deliciously indulgent; I seriously considered licking the ganache off of the paper. And the maple bacon puts you-know-who's to shame. If I had one minor complaint about any of them, it would be that the filling in the lemon/lime filled was too thin. Rather than being thick like a custard (or, well, lemon curd), it was super runny and poured out of the doughnut and made a giant mess.The next morning I felt like we really needed to try some of the others we hadn't gotten to the day before. The very last coffee coconut cheesecake doughnut had sold out right in front of my face, and it was haunting me. So I went in to pick up three doughnuts for the three of us to share, and of course came out with four. I couldn't leave without another blueberry bourbon basil!The coffee coconut cheesecake was not *quite* as mind blowing as I'd hoped considering those are three of my top four favorite flavors for anything sweet. Perhaps that alone made my expectations too high. I can see what another reviewer meant about the texture being different. It was more like a cupcake than a doughnut. (You may be saying to yourself, \\"Is this really a complaint?! 'Wah, my doughnut was too cupcake-y'?\\" No, no complaint! Merely an observation.)The blackberry compote & peanut butter powder was for my husband. He enjoyed it and said it really did taste like a PB&J.I have to say I would have liked some heat to the Mexican chocolate; it tasted more like a regular chocolate cake doughnut with a touch of cinnamon. To me, \\"Mexican chocolate\\" anything needs some spice to qualify as such. Now I'm just getting picky, though. Still five-star doughnuts, all.

I've been here three times and each time, I walked away very full and slightly guilty conscienced, but very, very, happy. First time, I tried the pork over rice dish and I was hooked!! Very generous serving. Could probably have for two meals, but I'm very bad at leaving left overs. Very flavorful, juicy meat. You can tell it was cooked with quality meat and with love. Lots of Bok Choy on the side, which is GREAT because it really does help me feel less guilty. And it's rare to find a dish with enough veggies these days! I feel like you always gotta pick one or the other, BUT I WANT BOTH and this place gives it to ya! Egg is delicious and even their pickled radish is delicious! Obviously, I ate everything.Second time, I went for a \\"snack\\" and ordered the pork belly buns.... While it may seem a little pricey at first for 2 buns... Once you see the thickness of the pork belly on your buns, you think it's worth every penny. It's suuuuper good. It has a light sprinkle of peanuts on it, for those that are allergic. Super tender, on the sweeter side, but very subtle. And I was definitely full afterwards even though I didn't intend on getting full...Third time, I tried the bento box, which rotates entrees. Mine came with chicken nuggets. It's a really good bang for your buck! I think it's $8 but you get like. 2 veggie sides, tofu and radishes. The veggies are simple, but I really enjoyed that. Again, it made me feel healthy. :) my veggies were lightly seasoned cooked cabbage and a medley of green beans, carrots and corn. I don't even think the medley was from a frozen bag?! If it was, they did a really good job of masking the freezer burn flavor. It was super tastey. The chicken bites were also very good, but I dunno if I'd say they're the best? What made them super good was that they taste so fresh! The batter crispness is undeniable, but it may have been a little light on salt for me, but I have a super heavy palate when it comes to that.

I doubt a lot of places have a lineup that includes a doughnut with blueberry, bourbon, and basil glaze. Even the \\"simplest\\" glaze uses horchata.The doughnuts here are fairly large, but incredibly light and pillowy. Basically surprised, shocked, jolted. Each doughnut is fried to a beautiful golden brown. Me = happy panda.My first doughnut here was the aforementioned Blueberry, Bourbon, and Basil doughnut ($2.50). A beautiful glossy glaze that screamed blueberry in color, while the hint of basil hitting while enjoying that first bite.I went back on a second trip and got their maple bacon doughnut. Didn't have to think twice before getting that one. It's a lovely glaze where you can appreciate the maple syrup. The bacon was perfectly cooked, crisped up wonderfully. No burnt taste. The maple bacon doughnut, while still light, admittedly wasn't as airy as the blueberry doughnut my first visit. Regardless, it's still an awesome product.People, myself included, might initially cringe at the sight of the prices. After all, $3 for a doughnut usually makes my wallet very sad. In any event, try these other doughnuts on for size: Coffee & Coconut Cheesecake; Homemade Horchata Glazed (a.k.a. Original Glazed); and even a Passion Fruit Poppy Seed doughnut. They're thinking of new glazes all the time, so they'll eventually have something you won't be able to pass up. They rotate doughnut options daily, although the real popular ones probably will be there just about every day.The coffee is also good. Can't go wrong with Stumptown. You'll get a nondescript paper cup for your coffee here.Occasionally, Blue Star Donuts will roll out a doughnut with pieces of homemade fried chicken on top. The doughnut is rolled in a honey butter glaze and served with a packet of Frank's Red Hot sauce to go with it. A fork may be required.

The first three are soft, round glazed donuts, and the last one is obviously a cake donut. I liked that the basil in the BBB donut wasn't subtle, and you don't have to search for it to taste the flavor. I don't mean to sound like a snooty food critic, but the basil really does contribute to the overall \\"flavor profile\\" in a substantial, fresh way. The Bacon Maple donut tasted exactly how you'd think it would taste--sweet, salty and rich. The best word to describe the Passion Fruit Cocoa Nibs donut is \\"intense\\"! It's definitely sweet, and the fruit flavor is really concentrated. I actually took the matcha donut with me as a hiking snack and couldn't get enough of it while I was in the wilderness. The store itself is uncluttered and trendy with a chalkboard menu and the whimsical sayings all over the walls. You'll probably get donut anxiety as you wait in line, hoping the people in front of you won't take the last of the best flavors.

Even though the donuts (and photos of the donuts) look like they would be really really overly sweet...they ended up not being overly sweet at all.I really liked the Blueberry Bourbon Basil and Chocolate Almond Ganache.  Regarding the Blueberry Bourbon Basil donut -- if you don't like Basil, you should skip that donut as the basil flavor is quite strong.  Regarding the Chocolate Almond Ganache -- it's a dark chocolate on it, so if you don't like dark chocolate or have nut allergies, then you should skip that donut.

While waiting for my food, I saw at least three employees wipe their gloved hands on their dirty aprons.The employees clearly don't realize that they are working in food service in terms of service or regard for food safety or quality. Getting to the meal, the mashed potatoes tasted like potatoes, slightly dry, and the gravy tasted like cream of mushroom, not great, but it actually helped being so dry because the chicken was like eating a fried sponge soaked in oil, with flab attached.

It's a big open space with plenty of room around your table or booth--not so much that it seems spaced out, but you don't feel you're crowded near anyone, either. The big lobster tanks are right in the middle of the room, a nice atmospheric touch even for someone like me who's never eaten lobster. Despite that, I should mention, there's no fishy smell.They bring you plenty of rolls and cornbread, then offer to bring more when you've eaten them. That's a sign of good service, IMO. (And both breads are really good, especially the cornbread.) The food (I had flounder with lemon and capers, which comes with hash browns) was very good, though the potatoes and my salad (same plate) were swimming in butter. For dessert I had a oatmeal raisin cookie sandwich filled with cinnamon ice cream (from the specials menu), which was very good as well, though that owes more to Ben and Jerry than to Jasper White. Oh, and they have good fried (RI style) calamari, too.I enjoyed this meal. It's a nice though casual atmosphere, and very good food. Prices are high, with dishes starting aroung $13 but mostly clustered around $20 (so it loses one star from this poor grad student). The main downside to the place is finding it--it's easy to get lost (not that I'm speaking from personal experience...) trying to find your way into the parking lot. The T would be the way to go; it's right across from the Alewife stop. I recommend it.

The donut itself was perfect. They use a brioche recipe from the south of France (says some sign inside the store) and it's a fantastic recipe indeed. Their flavor profiles are exceptional, it's hard to pick a favorite.Despite the long line, service is pretty quick. My only comment would be to figure out a way to control the line a little better.

I think it's because the ambience is fun, so quintessentially New England, so casual enough to go after a long day of working in the yard or a long week at work, so with plenty of parking.Why can I not remember that . . . THE FOOD PRETTY MUCH SUCKS.I don't get it.  There's no reason this restaurant shouldn't be able to get it right.  They have everything going for it:  great space, a good routine for getting fresh catch (they go daily), prices that should MORE than amply provide for a good chef in the kitchen.  We've gone to Summer Shack on and off for over 13 years.  I always have hope that THIS TIME, it will fulfill the measure of its creation, and every time, I leave with big regret and many fewer dollars in my wallet, vowing to never make the mistake again.Mediocre, mediocre, mediocre--starting with the bread basket.  A collection of grocery store-quality white rolls and dry squares of cornbread that taste like they're made from a mix.  Bertucci's does better.The tomato and corn salad was bitter and tasted of refrigerator, with wilted skins on the tomatoes.  The price for it bounced from $7 to $11 when I chose the crostini option--three diminutive slices of toasted baguette with a soft cheese spread on.  No herbs.  No artistry.  No flavor.Then, the skewered grilled scallops.  I am a scallop-lover.  I order them everywhere.  I understand that they mustn't be over-cooked.  But these were very much UNDER cooked.  They were doughy and raw inside.  And again, plain plain plain.  And they were served on a greasy, lukewarm, dry and shriveled pile of fried potato bits with chorizo.  Bleh.And back to the ambience--you know, the place is just unbelievably LOUD.  Don't go there if you want to have a conversation.  The accoustics must be just terrible in that cavernous space.Summer Shack:  where the fish is fresh, but there's no talent in the kitchen.

I want to give BoMa 5 stars, I really do....but I can't.To begin, BoMa is exactly what the name indicates; a Bar of Modern Art.  Set in an old renovated church, each room contains multiple pieces of contemporary art hung tastefully and subtley, yet certainly not hidden.  The pieces range from deco to traditional and sculpture to installation.  While none may blow you away, the effect is nice as a whole.  The scene is completed with a solid LuisArmstrong/Miles Davis soundtrack that is loud enough to notice, but also easily\\nignored.  At the center of the ambiance is the restaurant in the loft and a 'main floor' below complete with video screens, draped beds, and private booths.  I'm certainly not a club-goer by any means, but the whole setting is very sensual and I'm sure the place gets hopping at night.  Tables are wood and seating is comfortable, athough the creeky floors can be a bit disconcerting at times.With the scene painted, the main event is certainly the food.  A small menu of unique presentations, BoMa shines in its delivery.  Bread service was prompt and two types of bread (note to all restaurants, more variety is welcomed) were served with an incredible whipped butter infused with blood orange and peach.  Three baskets later, no wonder we were so full afterwards!  For appetizers we opted for the Ahi Tuna with Avocado, Sesame Oil, Achiote Vinaigrette in a coconut with banana chip and Peanut Butter and Jelly Foie Gras with Roasted Cashew Butter, Grand Marnier Marmalade, and Black Pepper Honey.Having tried Tuna Tartare at a myriad of restaurants, I can legitimately say this was the best both in presentation and in taste.  The long fried/dried bananas served as scoops for the incredibly fresh and tasteful tuna which was perfectly chilled in a coconut on a bed of ice and infused with a sweet oil/avocado blend.  In a dish that has become increasingly common, the uncommon nature was delectable.Like the tuna, the foie gras was wonderful.  Served on a honey toast with crunchy cashew butter and an incredibly sweet marmalade, the foie was perfectly seared and tender.  When eaten as individual components, the flavors were all very potent, and when eaten together the overall effect was bliss....the fatty smoothness of the liver, the crunchy cashews, and the sweetness of the marmalade, and the crisp bite of the toast.  In all honesty, after the appetizers, I didn't think things could taste better.The meals we opted for included Sustainable Salmon with Maryland Crab Wontons, Wild Mushroom and Scallion Saute, Blood Orange Soy Butter and Tanglewood Farms Chicken with EVOO whipped Potato, Saute Swiss Chard and Chorizo and Corn, Sage, Chevre pan Sauce.  Both dishes were plated simply yet beautifully and both tasted fresh and delectable.  The chicken was moist, tender, and flawless.  Pounded flat and quickly pan fried, the crispy outside contrasted sharply with the silky potatoes and pan sauce.  A hint of salt and a whole lot of spice blended wonderfully and made this a very pleasant dish, if not overly exciting compared to the flashy appetizers.The salmon was perfectly prepared and without a hint of fishiness and the mushrooms were rivaled only by those served at Dragonfly in terms of taste/texture.  The blood orange butter was particularly wonderful and added a beautiful tartness to everything.  The wantons however, lacked filling and flavor...a small disappointment.  With two courses of such quality, dessert was a no brainer....and the best decision of the night.I selected the Chocolate Passion 'with layers of passion fruit, chocolate mouse, and cream over decadent fudge cake.'  In a word.....amazing...There is really no other way to describe the myriad of flavors in the dish.  The chocolate shell was bitter sweet and surely 72% or better dark chocolate, the passion fruit cream light and refreshing, the mouse flawlessly smooth, and the cake dense, warm, and oozing.  While the dessert options at Rosendales, M, and Worthington Inn are all good, this may be my new favorite choice in Columbus.  For those interested, a similar dessert is served on weekends at McCormick's at Easton, albeit more pricey and less delicious.My sister opted for the Goat Cheese Cake atop Short Bread Crust finised with Fig marinated in Port Cherry.  Expecting a tiny tart, we were both amazed by not only the size, but the flavor of this well crafted dessert.  The cake was smooth and crumbly, the port cherry was sweet and poignant, and perfect figs in Ohio in May?  The only thing that could have made this better is a scoop of Jeni's goat cheese and cognac icecream on the side.Continued here - http://www.chowhound.com/topics/515675"},{"name":"FLIP burger boutique","address":"1587 Howell Mill Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Good news: No wait.

Now for the bad part: the food.  The portions are absolutely teeny weeny tiny, it's a wonder you can even taste anything with how small it is.  Most of their stuff is cold and supposed to be that way, but I prefer a nice hot meal.  They also just try to put too many things together and I just don't dig that combination, I want it to be together because it tastes good, not because it's sounds funny and eclectic.  There was nothing too memorable about any of the dishes except they use a lot of fish foam (I can't remember the fancy name for it).  The fish foam is gross and adds absolutely nothing to the dish.  I'm so glad I went to the cheese place beforehand, I would have been absolutely starved if I had walked away from this place without an appetizer, even $70 a person later.

The first time we came was lunch time on a weekday. We brought my parents to try Ethiopian for the first time. There was not a soul in the restaurant and we sort of had to \\"yoo-hoo\\" our way in until a nice hispanic lady greeted and seated us. After looking through the menu, we decided on a big variety platter so that we could try various things and she took our order. She then dissapeared into the kitchen because it turned out she was the only person in the entire restaurant and cooked the dozens of components of our order by herself. Of course this took an extremely long time. I can't complain though because despite the amount of time we sat in this completely empty and quiet restaurant, it was the best Ethiopian food we have ever had. We were there for maybe 2-3 hours total and not one other soul walked in. The second visit was with my mother and sister in law for dinner. They are big fans of Ethiopian and go to Desta (popular ethiopian restaurant nearby) a lot. This visit was a little more traditional as there was someone working in the kitchen and a server. There were more patrons which made the service equally as slow as the first time because their capacity as two human beings was still too little for the amount of people in there. Either way, it was another fantastic meal. The meals are meant to be eaten by hand using injera bread as a vehicle to bring food to your mouth and they are served on these small round traditional basket tables.

Our waiter took the time to explain things to us even though it was super busy. He also regularly filled up our water cups and was very friendly.

They have six other locations and this restaurant in Atlanta is their seventh location. They have some big names behind this restaurant like Gretchen Thomas, one of the very few level one master sommeliers in the world, designing drinks menu. And I have a colleague in westchester who swears by the Bartaco in his neighborhood. So naturally, I was excited when I heard about a plan to visit Bartaco. With some 11 of my fellow yelpers, I came here for lunch. We arrived to the restaurant around 12.30 Pm, the sun was at the peak spewing too much heat for anybody's comfort. To my horror, we were seated outside in a long table in the back, directly under the sun - no umbrellas or shade, whatsoever. May be this is ok in moderate summer weather in north-east, but not in south! I'm quiet tan enough, thank you! And worse, ours was one of the very few table outside that didn't have any shades and most others did. why this omission for just few, I have no idea. The tables looked pretty at least. So this is how it works, there is a sushi-house like menu. You basically, put in the quantity you want and turn it over to the waiter and your food will be delivered in, eh, reasonable time. They were quiet flexible in terms of splitting checks, so that's not a problem but it is a good idea to fill individual menu than haranguing with your waiter after you get your check. And they have blue credit card sized card in each table; any time you need some help from the staff you put it up on the holder. The first one to notice will come help you. That's neat. So a fellow yelper and I decided to split small tray between us. Our tray came with following,1) 9 tacos(3 Baja fish, 4 sesame ribeye, 2 chicken)\\n2) Mushroom mole tamale\\n3) Pork tamale\\n4) Spicy cucumber salad\\n5) Chipotle slawIt was $24 for the small tray.We have no idea how many tacos there is supposed to be in the Small trays. Our came with nine tacos whereas one of our fellow yelpers only had eight tacos. It's never written anywhere, nor mentioned by waiters. Eight or nine, it was more than filling for two. if you are light eater, three can easily eat from this plate. Baja fish taco was crispy, delicious and my favorite of three. I didn't care too much for their chicken taco -the chicken was tender but flavor was just ok. And sesame ribeye taco was somewhere in the middle. I also tried pork belly taco - I think they nailed that one. Juicy, tender and delicious. I liked both tamale, may be the mushroom mole tamale a bit more. The cucumber in 'Spicy cucumber salad' was crunchy and hint of heat to it - perfect for the summer. Slaw was, well, slaw. Not sweet, at least. I am not a fan of sweet tasting slaw, so I appreciated that. At the end of the day, while I think the food is good, the experience wasn't to my liking though. I mean, if I just want tasty Mexican food, I have plenty of options closer to my place and near Buford highway, a lot cheaper than BarTaco. No that wasn't just it. It is the experience and ambiance that usually justifies spending more at places like BarTaco  and when that's lacking, it gets quite hard to recommend this place. 3 stars"},{"name":"Wild Chix & Waffles","address":"7714 Burnet Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I came here with my friend on a Thursday afternoon!

There was also a cute little message at the bottom of the cup. Although it is a bit on the pricey side, I would say that the drinks were definitely worth it. My favorite part about my visit to the cafe was the excellent customer service. The employees were so friendly and helpful. They offered my friend and I a complimentary hot chocolate and it was absolutely delicious. I loved it even more than my Cortado! It was the perfect amount of chocolate, at the perfect temperate with a perfect design on top. So so so so delicious.

A working man classic at split-tail price points. Fine, I get it. And truth be told, I like it.Meat and bread don't need science. They need quality for the price, accoutrements that bring something to the table (not just everything to the stack) and, ultimately, a sense of carnivorous satisfaction.

The fish was quite tasty, but the chips were standard french fries. They had a good color but were pretty limp, somewhat soggy and very pedestrian. The price of the Fish & Chips was $13.95 which cost more than Bag of Nails or Max and Erma's and was a smaller serving size. I didn't mind the smaller size but the value was not there.

The atmosphere was perfect and exactly what we were looking for, with soft lighting and jazz music playing in the background. The tables are close together to maximize room, but it doesn't feel crowded even when it's packed (which it was despite the non-typical date night). Our waiter was French and very friendly and attentive, ensuring the wine and bread was to our liking, and refilling our water before we even noticed it was needed. I had the la poulet aux citron, very juicy and flavourful, with delicious grilled zucchini and creamy mashed potatoes that melted in my mouth. I have a serious love on for mashed potatoes, and these hold a special place in my memory. My partner had the filet de boeuf grille, rare. She commented upon receiving it how perfectly it was cooked, as she finds most restaurants tend to overcook to be on the safe side. Not this tenderloin! Red and still bleeding, just the way she asked for it. The potato gratin were as excellent as the rest of the meal, matched well with glazed seasonal vegetables. The only downside to the meal, unfortunately, was the dessert. We ordered the creme brulee to share, and it was extremely disappointing. The sugar was too burnt, giving it an unpleasant acrid taste, and there were dark flecks of vanilla coating the bottom. It was also much too runny.

The experience really didn't do it for me at all . And given the biographies and ( Michelin star) aspirations shared by the owner on the menu , I was very underwhelmed . \\nArrived 7 minutes early for an 8pm booking & seated immediately- Restaurant 1/3 full 2 serving staff , 2 chefs visible in kitchen .  It was 8.30 before we got the bottle of wine we'd ordered at 810 & our ( pleasant & friendly ) server checked back at the same time as she couldn't remember if we'd asked for bread - appetisers arrived a little while later , great presentation , tasted \\"ok\\" - main course / entree was where it became a little farcical . One main & a side delivered correctly , the other was wrong as the server said she'd mixed our order with another table . No huge deal , but I was told to \\"make do\\" with nibbling on the side order till the kitchen could cook my original main course . Any semi decent restaurant if my experience would have taken the whole lot away & redelivered it freshly cooked . The main courses (eaten at separate times ) tasted fine , the side a  cheese sp√§tzle was delicious it all looked great  -  but at that point we just wanted to leave and it took 15 mins to get our bill & another 10 to pay .  \\nAlso only restaurant on our 4 nights in Vancouver that didn't acknowledge the special occasion they'd asked if we were celebrating .

I imagine it'd be nice when it was all filled up and lively, though.The server (and his trainee) seemed to have a hard time balancing too much and  not enough -- it took a really long time to get our bill and pay it and to place our order, but we were visited at least four times while eating our meal by our waiter and the owner (no, the quality of the food didn't change every 10 minutes, interestingly enough).The vegetarian thali platter (I thought that was an Indian concept, but whatever) had salad, hummus, baba ghanouj, basmati rice, asparagus in sauce, tabouli, dolmas and tzatziki. My dining companion took one of my two pitas, so I was forced to eat much of the dip with a fork, but it was still mostly enjoyable. If I were able to customize, I'd have reduced the tzatziki portion by half, seasoned the tabouli a little better, and given more asparagus (my memory is failing me right now and I'm trying to remember if they were actually green beans -- whatever they were, they were delicious). The hummus others rave about was just OK and I'd have skipped the dolmas entirely -- too sweet. \\nNothing stood out as a must-have for a repeat visit, but it was all fine.His meat dish looked, well, meaty. And he seemed to enjoy it. I brought a bottle of wine that turned out to taste pretty bad (only the dozens of flies at our table liked it), but I can't blame the restaurant for that. I'm not used to BYOB, but I thought it was funny that we were charged $3 for access to glasses and bottle opener but they didn't open the bottle for us. (Is this the standard?)Would I go back? If someone else wanted to, sure. Three and a half stars is fine once in a while, but Sarah's Mediterranean less than a mile away is half the price and better food (though the market doesn't offer the ambiance, or potential ambiance, of Phara's)."},{"name":"Parish Cafe and Bar","address":"361 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Pros:\\n-Really fun menu with each item created by a different Boston chef! \\n-Tip: get there right before 11:30 on a Saturday (opening time) and you won't have to wait too long.

The chicken tasted surprisingly plain (not as if it were marinated in olive oil or garlic per the description), but dipping it into the sauce gave it all the flavor it needed.

I went here tonight with my boyfriend, and overall we had a great experience.We started with the antipasto rustico, and it was a really delicious assortment of olives, cured meats and cheeses.  Simple, not overly dolled up on the plate, and absolutely delectable.  For mains, I had the bolognese, and my boyfriend had the spaghetti with meatballs.  The pasta for the bolognese was clearly made in house - the entire plate was filled with one perfectly-cooked, gargantuan noodle that would have required a roughly three mile-long Barilla box.  The sauce was more tomato-y than I had expected, but perfectly cooked, with the meat still tender and flavorful, and a nice mellow flavor to the tomato component in the sauce.  There were little pockets of cheese secreted throughout the dish that occasionally provided a nice salty hit on the tongue, which I thought was a really nice touch.The spaghetti with meatballs, it must be said, was not made the way my boyfriend's (real) Italian grandmother made them.  Shocker.  That aside, he enjoyed them a lot.  There seemed to be a bit of cheese mixed into the meatballs themselves, which once again added a nice salty component to the dish, and the bit of the tomato sauce that I tried really incorporated the flavors from the meat really nicely.  At the end of the meal, we both felt full without feeling like we had just gorged ourselves in a ravenous, hedonistic glut of tomatoes and reconstituted animal carcass that sent us immediately into a gastronomically-induced stupor.The wait staff at this place was great.  They were all very polite without trying to become my friend - always appreciated, as I have generally gone to dinner with a friend or a group of friends, and thus don't feel the need to find another friend halfway through picking an olive pit out of my mouth.  In response to people who comment on how small the place is: Yes, it is a very small place.  However, Monica has, in her inestimable wisdom, installed windows through which one can look both out and in!  Yes, one can actually look through the window and see the entire interior of the restaurant.  So while I admit that the place is small and that everyone is certainly at close quarters, one cannot accuse this place of hiding it.The last thing I'll say is that, if you are in a hurry, this is not the restaurant for you.  It is small enough that they don't really give out accurate time estimates of when you might be seated if you're waiting for a table.  But if you do decide to wait, it's definitely worth it.

It took us about 15 min to order and receive our drinks, so I assume the wait for food takes even longer.We picked up a banana-berry smoothie, pineapple aguas frescas, and a small black coffee.  The fruits in the drinks are so fresh and bright, you can tell that everything is freshly made with real fruit and ingredients.  You get a huge 16 oz drink for under $5, and the larger drink for cents more.For a refreshing drink to take with you while you walk through the streets of Austin, stop by Veracruz All Natural for a fresh pick-me-up."},{"name":"Santarpio's Pizza","address":"111 Chelsea St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"We were staying at a nearby hotel and were looking for local pizza, as a antidote to all the good seafood we had consumed the previous days.

I went the other weekend to watch the World Cup and really can't say enough good things about Whiskey's.We went for lunch, so I got the El Paso Chicken Salad in an attempt to be \\"good\\", and my friend ended up with the Pulled Pork Sandwich. We did, however, end up ordering some Mozz sticks to start and by the end of the game (R.I.P. Team USA), we threw caution to the wind and ordered the Kahlua Brownie Sundae. So, how was the food? It was exactly what I expected it would be, in the best way. The mozzarella sticks were tantalizingly breaded, hot, with a yummy marinara sauce. The salad was spicy and the chicken was well cooked. The pulled pork sammy came with a side of cole slaw (a pairing that ranks up there with PB&J, grilled cheese and tomato soup, and bacon and eggs), which, according to him, was fantastic. (He scarfed it down in about 3 minutes, thus preventing me from taking a bite for myself. It's okay, I trust his judgment.)But the real star here is the brownie sundae. I ordered it thinking it'd be your run-of-the-mill mediocre pub dessert meant to be consumed only after several rounds of brew. NOT THE CASE AT WHISKEY'S. The sundae came out in an enormous goblet, overflowing with whipped cream and a little cherry on top shining like a beacon in the night. I ordered mine without nuts, but I imagine that typically the mountain of cream is doused in them, so order accordingly. The sundae is layered such that the brownie sits at the bottom, retaining its warm gooeyness while the generous heap of ice cream melts into it. The tower of whipped cream is just a bonus. You have to dig into it, and it may get messy, but let me tell you this dessert is DIVINE. So divine that I ended up devouring it almost entirely by myself. At 2pm. There are no excuses...except that it was absolutely and totally worth it.Other key points: our waitress was fantastic, the bar scene was hoppin', and the drinks were pretty tasty.

The tables are outside and the majority have no shade or umbrellas, despite the beating Florida sun at lunchtime.  I've had the Asian chicken salad (flavorless and bland) and the shrimp lo mein.  The lo mein was dripping in grease, more so than even mall food court Chinese food.  It's the kind of meal that will make your stomach hurt the rest of the day.  My husband and I were on the Disney Dining Plan (DDP) so we got dessert which we would normally never try in a place like this.  The chocolate cake was edible, but Little Debbie does a better job.  It's a rare dessert that looks better than it tastes.  The frozen lemonade was pre-packaged, and was refreshing if not entirely necessary.

Two items on menu were not available. Sliders and all kids meal items.  Made us wonder what else would not be available. We really were excited about all the options for our picky eaters. They really need to fix the menu if these items are not at this  location. The boneless wings were more like nuggets but did have nice sauces. My advice is skip those and get the bone in wings.

I personally like to dine with a variety of people helped me decide that this area wouldn't fit me. It's now 1:05 and  we ordered 20 minutes ago. The Brookhaven location is very fast.

There was nothing to distinguish the BLT (except that it came with 3 halves!), the Viera was only so-so (and it was recommended over our first choice by our server), and the rare tuna wasn't rare and included a weird sticky soy sauce-like condiment that was not part of the menu description.The service was sub-par. Our server abandoned us after taking our order with no comment that she was going off (and later we saw her on the patio with her friends) and she did not do a very good job of handing us over to her successor. Our sandwiches came out late and cool and we finally had to find someone to ask for our bill.  A side note, menus were printed on heavy stock paper, but not particularly special, and there was no sleeve or coating. Our menus were stained and wrinkled and could have been months old - they had a high yuck factor.

It's a small, well put together space with new furniture that's extremely clean and orderly each time I go in. Today was the third time that I visited the Caf√© and this time- I ordered the Chicken Parmesan, which came with pasta of my choice and a side salad for before the meal came out. The salad was not only a great touch, but was also not the typical iceberg lettuce. This salad almost made me ask for a second one with tomato wedges, a slice of red bell pepper, onions, a massive olive among other fixings over mixed greens including spinach. The dressing was light and savory. Then the bread that they give each party comes with a delightful dipping oil with an arrangement of spices and plentiful amounts of garlic. When my chicken parm came out, I was expecting a typical, run of the mill slab of chicken. Instead, I got a very large cut of meat with a side bowl of pasta. Much more protein than pasta- which I think is how it should be, even as a pasta lover.One waitress and a single cook operate this entire restaurant and the food comes out quickly and the server is extremely attentive. Also, keep in mind that this place is BYOB and not just a place you can go while waiting to get into Rino's. However, this is the ONLY BYOB place in the area, which is what makes the concept so special. I did not get a dessert or coffee this time, but have in the past. Their cannolis are just as good as the ones in the North End that you can find at Modern Bakery, but better than the ones that you find at Mike's Pastry- plus they're made from scratch. If you're looking for a salad for a lighter option, I recommend the caprese salad. The balsamic reduction is made by scratch there and is arguably the best I've ever had. I wish them luck in their new venture."},{"name":"Gus's World Famous Fried Chicken","address":"117 San Jacinto Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Delicious.

I've never been a fan of the kind of dark bar where you can't hear anyone talk and end up yelling over the music for most of the night. The Local, at least, has a decent mix on the jukebox (now digital, so that it downloads your songs, which ends up costing more, and on weekends so many people play songs that yours often don't come up for several hours). But I've been coming here for a long time, and it has pretty much become the intermediary place to go between wherever else you want to end up. A kind of prenight meeting grounds, though often it ends up being the place everyone stays through to close. The staff are all super cool also, and actually pay attention to your drinks, so you don't have to worry about bad service. The food ranges from decent to not so great. The chicken wrap is excellent though, and everyone likes tater tots. If you're looking for a loud bar full of college-age Atlanta-ites who listen to Modest Mouse instead of Linkin Park, this is a good choice. You could do a lot worse than the Local.They also have darts, foosball, several video games and photo booth in the backroom, so there's something to keep you entertained between yelling over the music at your friend to find out what time they're heading over to MJQ."},{"name":"FLIP burger boutique","address":"1587 Howell Mill Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Delicious!

Not sure what lack of seasoning others referred to...it seems that's what it is. Dipping sauce delicious and made it a perfect app to start with. My husband ordered the meatballs and the sauce..oh my...the sauce I was scooping up with my fork...very fresh and tasty!\\nI ordered the Chicken Saltimbocca and it was good...but possibly a little too salty because of the wrap around the chicken. But again, well prepared and full of flavor. Potatoes were incredible and the spinach and garlic sauce as good as it gets. My husband had the Rigatoni Arrabiata and he left not a bite for me..lol.\\nBecause we checked into Yelp in their precesnce we got our dessert for free. It was their Italian Creme cake. Very rich flavor, full of nuts and a smooth cream cheese icing. A new fav!!! Oh...how can I forget the wine selection. We had a hard time deciding which bottle to go with, we settled on the Dolcetta and it was an excellency choice. We had so mud food and wine and still walked out of there for only $75. Excellent place to go with friends or a fun date night!

It was too good to be true, caught me off guard not having a bit of nausea from eating something so decadent. How did they pull off a donut without that inevitable taste of oil? The donut was perfectly fluff, chewy and crispy all at once and had an even amount of cinnamon and nutella spread topped with incredibly fresh chilled strawberries. Usually outrageous taste creations are concocted with mass pleasing artificial components to up the ante. I'm thrilled that this dessert was all natural and just enough to share with another. The price was decent and it was nice to note pearl beers are sold for a dollar. The brick walled and warm lite atmosphere resembled a basement, which I find cozy and nostalgic. \\n   My second time at Gourdoughs I ordered a plain burger, which is just the meat and bread, I couldn't justify it in my budget to sit down and have it served to me so I took it to go. I knocked my vote down two stars because they have a to go fee. They lost this sale. To go fees are greedy, at least offer me the option of a useless bag if you're going to charge me for it.

The chocolate foie gras was alright, and the burnt marshmallow and chocolate one didn't have as much burnt marshmallow taste as I had hoped.  The cake bits in the pineapple upside down shake were a bit odd, but the taste was spot on. The burgers are alright.  They're unique, that's for sure.  But I can't say they're the best I've had.  I do like that you can substitute a lettuce wrap for any burger though, because I'm not a huge fan of buns.  Lastly, the fries.  Mmm mmm mmm.

The garlic mashed potatoes were the perfect complement, and we just couldn't get over how tasty it was without being as greasy and artery-clogging as we expected. In a curveball move that even the husband didn't predict, I ordered the Lumiere. Pork is usually the meat of husband's choice not mine, but I was intrigued by the papaya salad with peanuts that gave me a hint of the bright refreshing flavors the dish would encompass. It really hit the spot. After a few heavy and filling meals, I was pleased to find that the Lumiere was exactly what I needed to cut the grease of the past few meals and put me back to sorts with the peppered peanuts' spicy kick and the crunch of the papaya.We enjoyed our meal (all alone) on the open patio.

It also had hard boiled eggs. They had 3 sauces in the cold station: hummus, tzatziki, and the last sauce looked like aioli sauce. The hot stations had 3 different types of rice from plain bastmati rice to it being done 2 different ways. It also had a grilled beef and chicken.

As far as the doughnut itself, we bought a dozen doughnuts, of differing varieties, and they give you a 13th doughnut, for a cool baker's dozen. I started with the buttermilk old fashioned, as I'm guessing this is their base doughnut, before all the goodies are added. As clean and trendy as the baker looked, I can't say I was immediately impressed with their doughnuts.

I was minding my own business and enjoying my Sazerac until I was informed by the bartender (just before the band was scheduled to start) that the management needed me to vacate my seat because all the seats at the bar were reserved (do most bars reserve their bar seating now? Usually that's guaranteed first come first serve seating).My husband spoke with the owners, who informed him that every single table and bar seat in the entire restaurant was reserved for the show, and that I still needed to vacate my single seat at the bar, even though I was a paying patron and was prepared to order overpriced cocktails all evening long to meet the minimum order requirement per hour. The owners told my husband they would consult to see if they could \\"come up with something.\\" The bartender returned after several minutes to tell us that the owners could seat me at a table behind a pillar in the very back of the dining area. Why they would offer a single patron an entire table makes no sense, but neither does their backwards business model if asking paying patrons to leave. Plus, wasn't every single damn seat in the house spoken for?The staff made me feel so uncomfortable and less-than that I decided to leave the restaurant, rather than be treated poorly the rest of the evening. I was cordial to the bartender and left quietly without making a scene. I can't remember the last time I've felt so disrespected... oh wait, this exact thing happened several months ago during another one of my husband's gigs there. That time, I was moved from the bar and ended up sitting alone at a table for four the entire night, behind a pillar, with negligible service... when I could've been occupying a lot less space sitting at the bar.Because my husband plays here often, I've put up with the staff's rude, condescending and pretentious attitude for years. However, this is the last time I'll be setting foot here, and it's also the last time my husband will ever gig here. It's a shame, because Wilf's just lost out on a very talented musician.By the way, hubby called during set break about two hours later (I'd driven back to our home, an hour away). Apparently, the place wasn't sold out (surprise, surprise), and the seat at the bar that I'd briefly occupied before the show had sat empty ever since I left. Nice. Could've been making money off of me, ordering cocktails had they let me stay there, but whatever.Don't waste your time here.

Entrees ranged from pabellon criollo to asado negro  and the roasted portobello arepa. And an extra side of sweet platanos to share. We all loved our entrees!! Very fresh, full of flavor and tasty.Hot sauce is homemade and you MUST try it. My family is from South America (Guyana, which is next door) and that pepper sauce is very similar to what my family makes. I'm sure it's a regional thing as some cuisines cross cultures.  The food here is amazing. I felt very much at home here and I'll be back. Oh!!!!

Throw on your best Columbia or North Face coat and come on down. My kids both got cinnamon rolls, which were huge but wonderful on the texture and glazing fronts. It's hard to pull off those things with the care they deserve, cinnamon rolls that is. They need time, rising, etc. Most places don't have the patience to do it right.  I decided to try something different and ordered their champagne oyster breakfast. One of my personal things is an aversion to cooked oysters in general. Most of the time they are overcooked and the texture inside ends up becoming crumbly and frankly sort of gross. These particular oysters in the champagne oyster dish or cooked perfectly, with a nice cornmeal type breading on the outside, and served over puff pastry, artichoke, and a very nice cream-based sauce. There were some home cooked potatoes as well, but I didn't really get to those because I was enjoying the rest of the dish so much. It was a real home run for me. My wife got one of their scrambles, iron Miner or something like that, and it was very tasty as well.The only reason this isn't a 5-star is I really don't like the parking lot, and inside a can get a little bit stuffy. You can end up waiting longer than you want to. But I guess that is the price of success, isn't it?

Small but cozy spot. We counted only 4 communal tables in the place, each seating about 6 diners, plus a small bar area with additional seats. When you enter you see a very warm space, which smells delicious thanks to the wood burning grill that they use to cook much of their food on. The open kitchen is pretty sweet too; I liked watching everyone prepare the food.Started with fried brussels sprouts and potato fritters. Fried sprouts were delicious, crispy with some bite in the middle with the nice tang of lemon at the end. The potato fritters are basically the best croquettes you've ever had.Pasta stuffed with fish and potato was good, but by consensus was not the favorite dish of the night. Anywhere else it would have been a great dish, but compared to the rest of the fantastic food here, it was my least favorite.Rabbit terrine was dynamite stuff. Smoky deliciousness. Texture like a nice coarse ground sausage.Sweetbreads were cooked to perfection, crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside...and fantastic with the braised bacon. One of my faves.Leg of lamb was also solid, but honestly not super memorable.Grilled pork belly was crispy, smoky delicious. Like eating thick slab of grilled bacon. Awesome.For dessert we had the hazelnut chocolate crunch. Basically a deconstructed candy bar. This was a very smart dessert. It was very rich so the small portion size was just right, and hit the spot without having to hit you over the head with sugar like one of those ridiculous MEGA JUMBO COOKIES SERVED IN A PIZZA PAN served at shitty chain restaurants.I really love this place. The service was super friendly and attentive, and the communal atmosphere is perfect for a friendly city like Austin.

The donuts that i did choose were two glazed donuts, two bavarian cremes, a glazed cinnamon roll and another i think a chocolate glazed bear claw with a filling of sorts. Ive only had the glazed and the bavarian since the bf murdered the rest of the box and gave me a chocolately thumbs up. The glazed was so light and airy it left me wanting more. Kind of like a glazed cloud of goodness . The bavarian was also perfect because it wasnt too sweet and it wasnt dense either. \\nIts also worth noting that each regular costed 90 cents. Not even a dollar. You cant beat it.  The only issue i had this visit was the wifi. It seems that they were still working out the kinks and because of that, their credit card machine was down.

The list of why things were bad way outweighs the list of good things.- It has an odor when you enter\\n- The waitress as slow as mollasses - not with bringing food out, but just in things like coming to get a drink order. I'm not expecting \\"sitting on top of me while reading aloud the menu in different character voices,\\" but some attention would be nice. It's like the middle school dance all over again.\\n- My first ginger ale had a ... thing in it. I'm told it was the plastic wrapper, but I think it was more like a scale. How does that happen? Why did it even happen in the first place. \\n- The miso I had with my chicken katsu was off. I've had many miso soups in my day. I've been abroad, lived with a host family, and cooked my own miso many a time. This tasted off. My dining mate pointed out that there was vegtable in it.

It's a short jaunt down the main street to get to the restaurant. \\n- Interesting art to look at, and fun steryotypical art. \\n- The Katsu Chicken I had was amazing.

I was fortunate enough to sample a bunch of things on the menu since our group of six decided to go family style.  The trendy, Asian inspired decor coupled with Beirut's \\"Scenic world\\" in the background was very South End without being pretentious.  The waiters were friendly and patient as we scrambled to find the glossary for words on the menu we didn't recognize; there were many.  The first dish to arrive was the much anticipated green papaya slaw which didn't quite live up to my visions of a ripe, tropical green papaya combined with something creamy.  The actual dish tasted more like shredded radish in vinegar and fish sauce.  Next to arrive was the edamame and celery slaw, crispy arctic char roll and the chicken and rapini stir fry.  The edamame and celery was bathing in soy sauce and oil but as long as you fished out the essentials this was quite enjoyable.  A medium-sized fillet of fish wrapped in nori and served with homemade hot mustard, the arctic char roll was one of my favorite dishes of the night. The mustard alone made my mouth water and  complemented the sweetness of the tender fish perfectly.  The rapini in the stir fry was more bitter than I would've liked but this may just be the nature of rapini.  Next up: panko crusted lemon chicken, soy glazed salmon and udon noodles.  The promise of lemon chicken was misleading as the chicken remained largely untouched by the lemon sugar marinade while the soaked it all up.  However a bite of the rice and chicken together was quite satisfying and left me wanting more.  The udon noodles absorbed the soy sauce wonderfully while the soy-glazed salmon was just good but nothing exciting or inspired. Lastly we ordered cauliflower in a coconut milk curry that was surprisingly bland and actually masked the natural flavor cauliflower rather than enhancing it.  Prices were steeper than what I'm used to paying for Asian food and while I'd be willing to pay a premium for fusion, Myers and Chang just didn't live up to all the hype."},{"name":"Bijou Cafe","address":"132 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Great place for breakfast.

We opted to stick with a good bottle of wine and try as many small plates as we could fit in our bellies, which was a very good decision. Out of all the small plates we ordered throughout the meal (you can have them come as first, second and third courses), the crab cakes, grassy olive oil, fish, and fried parsnips were the standouts. I don't eat meat, but my sister said the rabbit was also delicious. Not all the food was spectacular, especially the Austrian specialties, but the great thing about small plates is the sampling!

Heck, it was classy enuf that a lesser known actor was lunching there! Wish i knew his name.... but he's a lesser known actor, so i'm not sure... I digress.\\nThe only complaints i have are two... The tacos were really small... i was like what the heck?!... they need to work on that... or at least make the tacos (corn tortillas) themselves a little heftier, so at least you can get filled up on the bread/corn part of it.  But in spite of that, the ingredients were quite tasty... but only for the premium tacos (curry shrimp, sesame beef, wild boar).  The regular tacos were kind of bland (grilled fish, chicken). In fact the grilled fish one was quite awful (to me anyway)... it was extremely fishy and barely had enough seasoning to cover up the fishiness.  Which leads to my second complaint which is i would expect more toppings on the tacos. For most of the tacos, the only thing in them was just the meat.  That being said, for the premium tacos, the sauce and seasoning on them were more than enough flavor, so i excuse the lack of other toppings.  However, for the regular tacos, they definitely needed a little more.  One more thing... we also got the roasted corn (which surprised me b/c i was not expecting it to be on the cob, although maybe i should have expected that).  The corn was almost too flavorful. But too much flavor is definitely something that i would not complain too much about, so therefore i enjoyed the corn a lot.\\nBut other than those two criticisms, i loved this place and it is totally a great fun place to go with a group of friends.

The burgers they brought out to my friends and I were comparable to the size of the credit card that I later (hesitantly) pulled out of my wallet to pay for this poor excuse of a meal. I won't deny that the burger tasted very good...all five bites of it. So...$8 for a slider sized burger, $4 for a few fried pickle chips, and $5 for a beer (no happy hour specials here), plus tax and tip = $23-24 for a meal that left me hungry.

I am also seven months pregnant and way overly excited by food.Ye be warned.My husband made surprise reservations at Trattoria di Monica for 8:30 on a Saturday night. Reservations on a saturday night in the North End are a must (or so I thought; turns out they don't actually mean crap at Tratttoria di Monica). I was really excited to give this place a shot, because the menu is pretty appealing and the reviews generally positive. We arrived just before our reservation and checked in the the hostess, who told us patrons were taking their time and therefore all reservations were approximately 15 minutes behind.\\"No worries, we can wait\\", I said. I was starving and definitely in the mood to eat, but what's 15 more minutes for a meal that looks and smells like it has the potential to be life-changing?Well, quite a lot actually, when 15 minutes turns into 30, then 45, then 50...My husband and I joined the throng of people milling around outside, waiting patiently for their own reservations. Turns out, after sparking up conversations with the six separate groups standing out on that cold sidewalk, that many of them had been waiting for their tables since 7:45. It was nearly 8:50 at this point.We all start gathering around the windows, hoping all the people sitting on their checks and nursing their final sip of wine will take the hint that other people are waiting to eat their dinners. Nope. Then we notice the wait staff  begin prepping two tables, and we all think, \\"huzzah! some of us are going to get to eat soon!\\" Rounds of excited murmurs circle the sidewalk, all of us focused on these two tables like they're a lifeline.Then, out of nowhere, a random group of people march down Prince Street, pass the throng of hungry and anxious would-be diners, and parade right through the front door of the restaurant like they own the place. They circle the table like vultures and sit, making themselves quite at home as the wait staff flock to them like moths to a flame.\\"What the heck?\\", we poor souls on the sidewalk all exclaim in unison. It turns out that Tuuka Rask, goalie for the Boston Bruins, was also in the mood for some Italian. An \\"unexpected party of six was being seated at the request of the owner\\", the hostess immediately explains to six very annoyed and starved groups of customers.Point to note: being a famous goalie helps you get faster service.Apparently, the owner of Trattoria di Monica doesn't cater to the plebs. (You, Mr. Restaurant Owner, are a bad business man and an even more shallow human being.)So, since I'm seven months pregnant, freezing, ravenous at this point, and not at all intimidated by athletic celebrity (a rarity for a Boston sports fan, I know), I immediately sought the hostess out and informed her that six groups were ready to mutiny if they were not seated immediately, and that it was highly unprofessional of any business to ignore its patrons for so long without some level of consideration.To their credit, the wait staff was overwhelmed and trying very hard to over compensate, but it was too little, too late. The damage was done.One hour after our reservations, we were all finally seated. The hostess informed my husband and I that part of our meal would be comped for the inconvenience, which was a nice gesture on the part of the owner, but pretty sad when the bill came and we determined that one small appetizer costing $8 has been deducted. Dude, you couldn't even comp my husband's wine? Man, that's weak.I will admit that the food was delicious, so my compliments to the cooking staff. Unfortunately, the whole experience was so unexceptional that I have no desire to recommend Trattoria di Monica to anyone, nor eat there again. The North End is filled with incredible restaurants, and there isn't anything about the Trattoria di Monica experience that places this establishment above any of the others.Do yourselves a favor and take your business and hungry bellies elsewhere.And just to add: Tuuka Rask didn't even play last night, so thanks for the good game, Chad Johnson."},{"name":"Yak & Yeti Restaurant","address":"Disney's Animal Kingdom Theme Park 775 Werikhe Way","city":"Lake Buena Vista","stars":"4","text":"Made a last minute reservation the morning before we came to the Magic Kingdom after having friends rave of this restaurant.

(The rice comes in a cup vs. the kabobs and Korean beef where it comes on your plate. Everything was cooked well.

Not so good for indecisive people like moi.  My bf and I went for a nice date the other night.  It was Sunday, aka the day I abandon healthy eating for comfort food.  We split the chicken lettuce wraps which were really tasty and came with delicious sugary sauces.  It's an app that can def. be a meal (or two).  Lettuce wraps always crack me up because they are usually 1,000 grams of sugar and fried noodles masquerading as health food (duh! lettuce is healthy), but these were damn tasty.  We also split the meatloaf with mashed potatoes and broccoli which was tasty.  The portions are really big, so splitting an app and an entree was plenty enough food.

Had heard a ton of people raving about this place. IMO, it doesn't live up to the hype.If I were judging solely on food, I'd give it... 2 stars. But the decor and layout is pretty awesome, so it earns an extra star. I'm not paying to look at pretty things and sit on a nice cushion when I choose a burger joint though, so here's reality:The burger. Just okay. Had the butcher's cut because I love me some bleu cheese. Asked for it medium well, and I remember it being pretty dry. Actually, maybe really dry. The best part was the bun. Gourmet quality, crispy, just the right amount of breadiness without being overwhelming. Kudos, but not really what you wanna be complimenting MOST about a burger.The fries were good. Notch above standard.The burnt marshmallow-Nutella milkshake. OK, I looked forward to this. Big time. It tasted like... melted solid chocolate. I like thick milkshakes, but man. This, for me, was overkill. And I didn't know what to do with the burnt marshmallows. Spoon them out and eat them? Mix them in and eat them? I ended up doing both. This milkshake has a legion of fans. I get that. I just personally don't prefer the combo. Will get the Krispy Kreme next time. Without a doubt.The milkshake alone is a meal. The burger is kind of small. The milkshake is more filling. Don't get both together. Unless you're extremely hungry. [Guys, y'all can probably handle this with no issue. Just speaking for myself.]Anywho, check this place out if you don't mind regular burgers and wanna pay for trendy. The ambience really is special. I'll give it that.

Everything we ordered was delivered promptly and without any issues.  In fact everything was perfectly prepared, perfectly seasoned and delicious.  The only negative is portions are a little on the small side for me which then makes the dishes only slightly over priced.  However from a business point of view the dishes are probably perfectly sized and priced. Then again it is obvious that only the freshest of ingredients and highest quality products are used, therefore, the smaller portions and slightly high prices. When something is so good I want a lot of it and not a small morsel.\\nThe Mountain Trout special was SPECIAL!  Perfectly cooked and the sweetest tasting fish I might have ever had.  The House special Snapper was also amazingly fresh and tasty!!!!\\nI won't wait 10 years to return again!!

There were a couple of tables with people outside (which is where we sat), and when we got there, Phara herself was belly-dancing for us. Awesome! We came to smoke but also wanted food- I had my heart set on a gyro, but there were none on the (tiny) menu. So when our hookah girl came to take our shisha order, I asked her if they might be able to make a gyro for me, and she said yes without thinking twice or batting an eye. And it was great!! Spendy ($9, no sides), but SO good- exactly what I wanted. And did I mention it wasn't on the menu?! So cool. Our hookah girl let us be since we knew what we were doing, and the shisha was good (we ended up ordering the flavor as soon as we got home).

The regular bartender lady is a true master and she rules that bar like it's her kingdom. I discovered my new favorite drink here: the blood orange caipirinha. Mmm, so good. The avocado colada sounds strange but is silky smooth and incredibly good. The mojitos are a can't miss either. Not too minty, not too sweet - perfect!Here I am going on and on about the drinks and I don't even drink that much!On to the food... My \\"regular\\" here is the Orinoco salad - grapes, tomatoes, almonds, feta, and grilled chicken blended with mixed greens and a delightfully light yet flavorful dressing. I always worry it won't fill me up but the portion is generous and I always wind up feeling full yet healthy. And for $8?! It can NOT be beat.My fiance has tried just about everything on the other side of the menu. His favorites include the tuna entree and the sliced beef (can't remember all the names). The sides - beans and rice, yuca with mojo (my favorite!) and fried plantains are comforting and delicious.We always take our out of town guests here because it has something for everything - great drinks, delicious and interesting food, great service, great atmosphere and incredibly reasonable prices (warning though: my favorite drink costs more than my favorite salad!).Couple of things to note: it's hit or miss with the wait. We went on a random Wednesday and waiting nearly 45 minutes once, then scooted right in at 7 pm on a Friday. Regardless, the wait is almost always less than they say it will be so stick it out! Pomodoro is a little pricey and only takes cash and Matt Murphy's serves mostly heavy foods and the place is tiny!Also: the arepas are great to try, especially if you've never had them, but aren't really worth it. They've decreased the size of them so they'll come nowhere close to filling you up. If you do get them, get the cheese ones. They hold together much better.

First, on the phone, it took about 5 minutes to establish that the Groupon was, in fact, valid for takeout. The guy took my Groupon number over the phone. So fine. I arrived at the restaurant to pick up my order, and he asked me to show him the Groupon. My experience with Groupon has mostly been that I don't need to print out the voucher, unless the merchant specifically asks for a printout. So in this case, I got out my phone to show him the voucher... and it was gone. He'd already redeemed it, after I placed my phone order and gave him the number. So then he basically accused me of dishonesty and stealing, because I couldn't show him the Groupon voucher. I did show him the redemption number and date, which was that day, since he'd just redeemed it. I mean, we're talking about a 20 minute time frame here. He had my phone number... what was the problem, exactly?So then, I had overshot my voucher by about $8. No problem, I was expecting that. So I got out my credit card to pay for the balance... he told me they don't take credit cards for amounts under $10. Well, the only cash I had was US, so I had to give him that. Again, the food itself was fine. Good, even. But the hassle? Not worth a repeat visit.

TV is available near the bar area and, no matter the time of day, the acoustics of the restaurant assure a satisfying \\"busy\\" sound that makes your conversations feel private without feeling the need to yell. Customers queue up to order in the back in a fast-food fashion, and are  assigned to their table and can order drinks while in line. On busy days, the line will go out the door, but moves fast.Having at least tasted-- if not devoured-- all the standard choices and a few of the \\"specials,\\" I can say the burgers are absolutely fantastic! The Magic Shroom in particular is pure...magic, especially when complemented by a delicious cookie milkshake. I've also enjoyed the \\"the skinny dip,\\" a ball of frozen margarita floating in a goblet of beer. Gimmick aside, it's friggin' delicious.Price-wise, Hopdoddy may not be the ideal place for a budgeting college student.

There was a salmon slice under each egg, but it barely covered the English muffin.  Hash were freshly cut up, fried cubed potatoes and there was a slice of orange to accompany the meal.  I felt the value wasn't there as I have had better ones elsewhere.Service was alright.  Server checked up on me once and asked if I wanted hot sauce to go with the potatoes.  It is odd that you need order your food first before you sit down at your table as though it is a fast food restaurant.  I felt rushed with deciding what to eat as other customers came in and I wanted a windows seat.  The menu lay out was not well placed so that the cashier blocked parts of the menu. The place would benefit with a typed out menu so that customers can take their time digesting the menu selection at their seats.  Ambiance is a cafe feel.  Clean and tidy place.

The server suggested that each person order at least 2 items.  This meant the average price per person was $20-25.  It wasn't as cheap as I thought, but it was worth it.We had the following menu items...fresh rolls - 2 rolls were served, so though they tasted great, $9 seemed a bit steep for only 2 pieces.garlicky spicy coal-black wings - This was delicious. Upon seeing how black the wings are, you feel like you're going to taste bitterness or a charred taste, but not at all.  It was cooked well and the spicy sauce they serve with it gives it a nice kick.asian-braised short rib soft tacos - Three tacos filled with lots of meat! Delicious! But, be careful when eating, because it gets really liquidy and soggy.chicken and waffles - I've never even had the traditional chicken and waffles but this was great.  The dipping sauce was the perfect to have with these items.  The only downside was that the chicken was a bit overcooked.wok-charred baby octopus - My friend had this dish and though it only had one star for spicyness, it ended up being extremely spicy.  Good thing he likes spicy foods.tiger's tears - The friend that had the octopus also ordered this dish expecting this one to be extremely spicy since it had three stars, but ended up not being spicy at all.

This used to be one of my favorite spots in Portland, and I brought my out of town friend here for lunch.  The menu is mostly the same but the whole restaurant seems to have a different feel.  More on the quaint side instead of the standard hefty BBQ side.  Personally, I don't spend too much on fancy drinks so Southland could thrive in this area, I wouldn't know.  The food was still tasty there were just a few disappointing aspects to it.  First off, I ordered the smokestack sandwich with a side of Mac and Cheese.  The sandwich I must say was delicious!  The issue I had was the Mac and Cheese side was very small and they treated this as my only side so I didn't get fries with my sandwich.  When I explained this to them they made the correction but it took ten minutes to get my fries, and then it came in a small cup with only around 12 of them.  One of the things that I loved about this place was you would get so many delicious fries that you could dip in tasty ranch.  Well when I asked them for a side of ranch when my fries finally arrived, they told me they no longer carry ranch.  What BBQ place doesn't carry ranch?  Or restaurant in general?  Ranch is staple for Obese America.  I also wasn't too impressed with the service, they had a bit of the \\"Portland Slow\\" mentality which is a pet peeve.

It was my very favorite sandwich.  The side salad which was red cabbage with some spiciness and peanuts was also particularly good.  However, the last time I was there, it was gone!!  Needless to say, I was very sad.  I freaking loved that sandwich.  So the last time I went I was forced to get something else.  I chose The Lumiere which was pulled pork butt with a lime and green curry sauce on a seeded bun.  Now, I love all of those things, but let me just say that the sandwich was pretty unmemorable.  The side salad was also sort of... eh and definitely not an acceptable substitution.One of the items that is both memorable and remains on the menu however, is the Vegetarian Corn Cakes.  Hello!  They are so delicious.  I love the combo of corn and avocado and yeah, these definitely deliver. As for the service, unlike many of the other people on Yelp, it seems that I have been fairly lucky.  It hasn't been amazing, but it certainly hasn't been horrific either.They also have a great beer selection and it's in a fabulous location (and by fabulous I mean very close to my apt....)

Good dish but not remarkable.\\n4) Smoked fish and potato stuffed pasta in a scrambled egg sauce with some apple.  I never in a million years could have imagined all this stuff would go together, but it did and was damn good.\\n5) Grilled foie gras - one of my favorites.  The spanish tortilla that accompanied it didn't have a lot of flavor, but the foie gras made up for anything lacking on this plate.\\n6) Rabbit w/ some kind of bacon liver mousse - exploding with flavor.  The rest of my table shied away from this dish, but I found it to be quite enjoyable.\\n7) Braised short rib - this was the favorite of all four in our party.  Juicy, tender, simply to die for.\\n8) Hazelnut chocolate crunch - I believe another reviewer described it as a deconstructed candy bar, which is an accurate description.  Rich, flavorful, a must for all chocolate lovers.\\n9) Almond cake with strawberry gelee - I am an extreme chocolate lover and not so much a fan of berry desserts, but my girlfriend absolutely loved this one.

Nothing that I'd crave and should I have an occasion to return, I wouldn't order it again.For dessert I ordered the Nutty Valentine, nutella, cinnamon, sugar, & fresh strawberries.  This was really good (of course, how could it not be).As for the restaurant itself, located in the old Kerbey Lane, it's had quite a makeover and is very nicely redone.  It is a bit cramped and loud.  We had a group of about 10 and were seated at a giant square table near the bar.  It was impossible to hear each other across the table and I felt like we were in the walkway (those on the bar side).  I don't know if we made a reservation or not but they do have two large picnic size tables that would've been a better option.  However, they were already reserved.  The hostess did offer us another table when I asked about them (the party they were reserved for hadn't arrived yet), the table she had still wasn't big enough.Also, just a strange note.  The music is piped outside.  So you can continue jamming out in the parking lot.  Kind of strange.  I suppose it's for the patio but it was a bit loud.So, I'll leave Gourdough's for those that adore it.

This place was the latter.We were seated right away during dinner service, unfortunately by the booth table near the door so it was freezing cold every time someone had entered or left. Though because they never refilled our waters or checked in on our table the freezing cold air actually helped cool us down from the spice and extremely hot \\"wok in a box\\". Service was absolutely terrible. We had no set waiter, and the girl who was supposed to serve our table was extremely rude. Her face had a constant look of constipation and her \\"I don't care\\" attitude left us having to take what we needed for our table from other set tables (clean chopsticks, sauces, another napkin, etc). When we asked for water they gave it to us in a paper takeout bowl (the ones used for takeout miso soup), which was fine, except they never refilled it. The food was sub par to what other raving reviews are saying. Two of us ordered the beef bowl and they were 3 chunks of thin sliced beef morphed together into a thick piece of meat. Needless to say that was difficult to eat without getting sauce/broth all over your face. Im not sure if they use MSG in their soup base, but it's quite salty and if you have any spice in it don't expect to taste anything but spice. If you make sauce from their sauce options on the table, be careful because the lids with labels were all switched. Having this been our first time there, we didn't know better and had very spicy, gross sauce combinations. The rest of the things in our soup had cooked to mostly mush and tasted all the same (like the broth) besides the lettuce on the top which were still mostly crunchy. Overall the food was terrible, this place makes instant noodle broth seem like fine dining. Beware, they do not let you substitute or change their set bowls at all due to \\"company policy\\". The only thing you can change is to take out things in your bowl, but of course pay the same price.Ambience and restaurant decor was meh, ambience wasn't really there besides a lot of loud talking in Asian languages from other customers. Restaurant decor was mostly dark brown, the walls were mostly bare from what I remember, except near the cash register where signs like \\"we have the right to refuse service to anyone\\" and \\"no split bills\\" were emphasized.

All of a sudden, Jason comes to us and apologizes for the delay between dishes and presents us a free watermelon gazpacho plate.

They do not take reservations but you can call ahead and get on a list and receive a text when your table is ready. How convenient! I started my meal with one of the best margaritas I have ever had in Atlanta! They are made in house and are pure perfection. We also had chips and guacamole and loved it. The tacos and other menu items are served tapas style and all food is brought out as soon as it's ready so your meal may not be \\"coursed out\\" in a certain order. The tacos are quite small but very good. I had a falafel taco and a cauliflower taco and I also tried the mushroom mole tamale.

So much so that, while I hate to admit it, of the 5 days in town, my guy and I ate here 3 of them. It was that good. The hot and cold chicken salad is so freaking good I don't know what I'm going to do without it. It seems so simple - a bed of warm jasmine rice, mixed arugula, snow peas, and slivered candied almonds in some sort of Asian vinaigrette, and then topped with chilled grilled chicken. Oh. My. Gosh. So good. I got this two of the three times here - the other time my boyfriend and I split the Zuni Roll, simply because we'd never heard of it and there was an article on the wall near the bar about it - it was absolutely nothing special, but decent for a late quick bite.Back to that salad - if I lived in Bahston, I'd be there everyday for lunch eating it - at the bar, that is. While I swoon over the food, table service was less than desirable. The night my guy and I split the Zuni Roll, our server brought us drinks, took our food order and then we literally never saw him for 45 minutes. Our waters were empty and we had no silverware or napkins the entire time we ate. We had to eat our potato salad taking turns with the toothpick that held the Zuni Roll together, and that is not a joke. On the other occasion we sat at a table it was a similar situation, only this time the table was already set so we could actually use utensils. Which was good. 'Cause nothin' was gonna get between me and that salad.But all in all, great food, great atmosphere, great patio, great place - allot time to wait for inattentive service."},{"name":"Pho Van","address":"8557 Research Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Great service,good food, and reasonably priced.

Very spicy, which I like, served cold so it just needed to be plated, don't know why it took so long. B. Pork belly buns, don't care for the style, they don't make the bun in-house so I don't know why they don't go all the way and make a serious full on bun and go with the taco style, over-sauced and the meat was almost non-existent. room temperature. C. side of brown rice, actually good sized portion, but served pretty much on it's own, and it was room temperature when we got it, cold by the time the last dish came out. D. Duck wraps. Do not get this, complete rip-off. The wrap is supposedly made at flour, basically it's a tortilla, not sure what's Asian about it, also cold, completely unappealing. The duck serving was an afterthought, some greens and sauce, there was not enough here to fill even one wrap much less the 3 they gave you. Also room temperature. Nothing ruins food faster than being served food, while not cold, fast becoming so.Initially we came for the cheap date night. Not sure why they are promoting this as a cheap date night because we added up the cost of the 4 items and it came to $2 more than what it would have cost had we ordered each item separately. Lastly, they tell you, repeatedly, that the food is meant to be shared to order with that in mind. You've got to be kidding me. Tapas has more food on it than each plate we ordered. I would not return. The manager gave us ginger brownies as a consolation, but after reading these reviews, it looks as though this is common, kinda worrying."},{"name":"Windy City Pizza","address":"516 Gallivan Blvd","city":"Dorchester","stars":"2.5","text":"I've been craving buffalo wings for MONTHS. I just haven't had it and have been wanting it like CRAZY. Well, it just so happened that my mom found out about this health diet mumbo jumbo that she desperately wanted me to try. I decided that I would and figured I'd start in a couple days. She reminded me that the diet was incredibly strict and that I wouldn't be able to eat anything but the food she provided me with. That was it. I HAD to eat all the things I wanted before the diet started and buffalo wings was gonna be one of those things.My friend told me about this place that served up the BEST buffalo wings and I went to Yelp to find out if it was true. Sure enough, the reviews said \\"yay\\" so I went ahead and went for it.My friend and I got twenty-two super hot buffalo wings with spicy fries and fried pickles. The buffalo wings had five levels of spiciness and the super hot option was the second spiciest. Golly, it was amazing. The fried pickles were hot, crispy and one of the best fried pickles I've ever had. The spicy fries were great as well. They weren't incredibly special, but they  were fried very well with spices sprinkled on right after they came out the fryer. As for the wings? By golly. There are NO WORDS to describe them. They were the best wings I've ever had. Drenched with enough buffalo sauce to give the wings a magnificent kick, but still have a bit of a crunch when biting in, they were fabulous. Dipped into their cool, bleu cheese, I was truly in heaven. I loved their bleu cheese. Great flavor and very yummy. One of the best meals I've had in a while. It was so good that I didn't feel guilty at all that I had devoured a whole bunch of fried foods and drank cups and cups and cups of soda to wash it all down.Wow. The meal set us back about $28 altogether and we only had some pickles and fries leftover. The only thing that I didn't like about the place was the fact that there wasn't a bathroom where I could at least wash my hands at. Conveniently, however, are hand sanitizer dispensers at each door for your use. Unfortunately, with buffalo sauced hands, they weren't of too much help. They also don't have booths or tables, but a counter where you can eat with stools, but with the food they served? I wouldn't mind making a picnic right there in the doorway.I also greatly appreciated the fact that when I paid with my card, they asked for my ID. Granted, that's not the most convenient option if you need to pick up food for a friend or anything, but it's good to know that they watch out for things like that and make sure that it's ME who's using MY card and no one else.Next time, I'll have to remember to try their spiciest wings though. Called Ballistic, it's practically screaming my name. Everything was perfect and I can't wait for this stupid diet to be done and over with so I can go get some more buffalo wings.

My girlfriend and I met here so it is kinda special to us.. We were both disappointed.  I have some concerns with them being able to survive especially with La Provence going in.  The problem I have with Ava's is that they make the customers do 90% of the work and for a very average product  yet they charge restaurant prices.  We ordered a bagel with cream cheese, a small sandwich that we split, and a naked fruit smoothie drink.  nearly $20. The sandwich isnt even accompanied by anything.  No chips, no greens, nothing.  At ava's:*  you order at the counter\\n*  you have to walk up when you think your food is ready because they dont call your name and they definitely do not walk it out to you.  \\n*  you bus your own table.  SERIOUSLY??? \\nI understand that La Provence is a restaurant and Ava's is a coffee shop that sells food.  However,  when a place like La Provence opens their doors, that would be a golden opportunity to make the necessary adjustments.  La Provence's over flow crowd might actually benefit you as long as you do not disappoint them as was the case with us.  We most likely wont return as long as things are the way they currently are.

I have been waiting for a chicken place to open for many years. We were in town from Houston on a day trip. We arrived right at the lunch rush, the wait was not that long, but the table seating name taking process needs to be changed. Your supposed to give your name to a girl behind the counter to be put on a waiting list for tables. She is so busy with take out orders and such that you can't get anywhere near her if she's even there. Their claim is that they don't cook your chicken until you order it. I ordered a 3 piece dark plate which consists of 1 leg and 2 thighs, and 2 sides. My wife and daughter both ordered chicken strips. My chicken was slightly overdone, which I could live with, but what I didn't like was that it was not hot. It was a safe temperature, but not fresh from the fryer. It didn't even steam when I took a bite. It was also slightly dried out.

Get this.  We ordered our food online for our family of four.  It was a long week and we were looking forward to relaxing so we ordered from Bite Squad.  We - much to our chagrin - choose to order the food from this so called pizza joint.  We ordered online at 6:30 pm.  Bite Squad has a cool feature where they show the process from ordering to cooking to delivery.  Our delivery time said the food would be at our door about 7:30 pm.  We then watched as the time kept slipping by  - every time we checked the delivery estimate would be delayed!  This was odd in that the online feature said our food was cooking durning this time period.When the delivery time changed to 8:15 pm (45 minutes past the original estimate), we contacted this so called food establishment.  When I questioned the manager about the issue, he said \\"sorry we are busy, we are getting to your order\\".  He then said \\"your order is next to go out and if you have an issue contact Bite Squad\\".  I then said, Bite Squad is NOT the problem.  I knew that as the computer told me the Bite Squad driver was THERE.  I pointed out this issue and the manager said, \\"contact Bite Squad\\".  If the issue was they were \\"too busy\\", they should not have accepted our order.    Bite Squad then called us to tell us that \\"our order was cancelled because I was rude in questioning why our food was delayed\\" - I never used profanity but I did express my dismay about the delay. I immediately called back the manger who's new story - totally contrived - is that the oven is broken.  Two minutes prior, there was not a mention of an issue with the over - suddenly after my call, the oven is on the fritz.  A two year old could come up with a more convincing story.  I then said, let me get this straight, the order we placed at 6:30 pm was still not in the oven and the manager replied, \\"yes\\".  If the oven was \\"broken\\", how is everyone else in the place eating?  He then never offered an apology, a discount or even a fake sympathetic comment and simply told me that our order was cancelled.Bite Squad called us an offered their apology - I immediately said not necessary as it is not their fault, I would note they lost out on a sale.

The portions for noodle dishes were just too small to be called family style. They should just call them tapas. Yes, I am nitpicking what they call their portion sizes, but it led us to order completely wrong. We should have gotten two of everything, because the dishes are meant to be shared between two, not four. So we basically ordered 8-10 single dishes, and we each got 1-2 bites of each. We should have gotten 4-5 things (but 2 orders of each). The tiny bites and flavor variances were just too much for my taste buds to handle. Everything is slathered in as much mirin and sesame oil as possible, without it being gross. If there was a variation between layers of salt and msg and fresh ingredients, I would not complain, but it was too much. I felt my cholesterol rising physically.

We landed on the Kim Chi Udon #15. The place was fairly empty when we arrived and our food was ready in under 5 minutes.

My sandwich on the other was very disappointing because they forgot the hot honey sauce!! That was the entire reason why I ordered it in the first place. I looked inside to see if they too had put it there, but no, it was completely absent. I was kinda sad. However, the chicken was really good. Nicely breaded and fried and very large.

My friends ordered off the menu, my husband and I ordered the 25 dollar \\"We order for you\\" meal.  We all ended up sharing everything anyway.  It was delicious.  The meal ranged from salad, cured meats, trout, braised pork, fennel, sausage, cauliflower, and more, all prepared with strong and sometimes surprising flavors, like cumin in the sausage.  I also got the 15 dollar \\"we choose for you\\" wine, with 3 glasses, and each was lovely, starting with a sparkling white, then a blush, and then a red.  I couldn't hear the names of the wine, as it was loud in there, but I was happy with the choices.  I wasn't thrilled with the crab cakes or the barley thing, but everything else was fantastic.  The meats are beautifully done, and the vegetables were well spiced and interesting.  The pickle platter doesn't have pickles, it's a PICKLED platter of beets, green beans, and a yellow thing that was really tasty.  The owner and chef, John, answered the phone when I called for reservations, and said he couldn't take the reservation (rule of 5) but to let him know if I had a problem finding a table at 5:30.  It was fine and the place was almost empty.  He was sitting behind us when we left and I thanked him for a good meal.There was more than enough food and it was fantastic.  I really recommend the 25 dollar option, but I wouldn't recommend coming here unless you eat meat, or at least fish.  I'm sure there are great vegetarian options, but the meats are just that good.

I think they ought to give a more creative name to the stout, but then it's not really a stand-out beer, save for it tasting overly rich (really, it seemed to be much more dense than stouts typically are).  The Sweet Heat is a lighter ale made with sweet peppers, and it is certainly unique.To eat, we had the gnocchi (with Oregonzola cheese -- get it?), squash, and walnuts -- and the warm lentil salad (with arugula, cumin dressing, and fried? chickpeas).

My bf and I were in town for the weekend, and called sometime in the afternoon on Saturday for a same-day reservation. We were somehow lucky to score one for the same day, Saturday, at 7:15pm. Can I get the WOW emoji here?! Maybe it's not as hard to get a reservation in Boston compared to SF, but when we walked into the restaurant, it was JAM PACKED, loud, and looked like the most hip restaurant in Boston ATM. Highlights:\\nThis is great Spanish food. My bf and I went to Barcelona in March 2016, and this was a great revisit to their tapas, charcuterie and sangria. \\n-Paella Mariscos - seafood paella, including mussels, clams, squid, and one giant prawn. This was WONDERFUL, but takes 30 mins to prepare. When you're waiting for your table at the bar, take a look at the menu beforehand and know which paella to get first. It's nice to order this one first so you aren't waiting forever. \\n-Charcuterie platter, 3 for $17.50. They gave a lot of meat and cheese! Manchego was good, as well as the Spanish ham Jimon. \\n-Bikini sandwich - basically a Spanish version of a grilled cheese & ham sandwich! Yum!\\n-Sangria pitcher, $26.50. WOW...this is definitely a must for the evening. For the pitcher that we ordered, it gave us 6-7 full drinks! This was totally worth the money. We also got really drunk; they definitely had high alcohol content. This would be perfect to order when with friends too! You can choose between red sangria or white sangria. Maybe not order:\\n-Arroz black rice. It was kind of dry. It did have a good sauce on top, but only a dollop. A larger amount of sauce would have been more tasty. \\n-Spin chickpeas. This was good, but tasted healthy. Just not something I wanted to eat on a Saturday night.Service:\\nThe food did come out fairly quickly, and I'm very appreciative of that.However, it seemed like they needed a little more help. It was hard to flag down waiters and busboys if you needed something. For instance, we had finished some of our plates for a good period of time, but no one bothered to remove it. Then came our next tapas that we ordered. This was a super awkward experience - the waitress actually asked US to HOLD our empty plates while she put down the new food. I mean, come on! Get your restaurant service rhythm together!Another weird story: When the hostess showed us to our table, the dirty napkin from the previous diners was on my chair!!! Omg. I've never seen that before. After verifying with our neighbor diners that it wasn't theirs, I had to point it out to our hostess that that dirty napkin had to go! Wow. Also, we noticed when our neighbor diners' table flipped, their dirty napkin was on the floor. One of the waitresses was cleaning up the table and resetting it. She neglected the dirty napkin on the floor. I pointed it out to the hostess when the newly dining couple sat down, and she literally said, \\"Don't worry about it,\\" smiled, and took off. Talk about a weird dining experience. This is not a super casual restaurant, nor is it a Michelin star restaurant, but still, have some class please! Is picking up a dirty napkin so much to ask for!!! The dirty napkin struck twice in our 2 hours dining there.Overall, I thought this restaurant was great, despite the weird service.

Finally the server came and asked if we'd like to have our udon first which didn't make any sense at all. The udon has no vegetable nor protein other than some shredded green onions and ginger, the noodle is kinda hard. The udon was for my daughter but we were so hungry so we shared hers.

Because I am vegetarian, I had one option, the Asian Chicken salad minus the chicken. It was awful, but not because it was gross, but because it is not something I would ever even order.  I did, however, fall in love with the mash potatoes on my boyfriends plate.  I don't think I have ever had such delicious mashed potatoes in my life. So it was worth a second chance. I kept it generic today  with the veggie burger and fries and yum! I wasn't disappointed.  The portion was huge so I saved half for later.  Boyfriend had chicken fried steak with the same heavenly mashed potatoes and steamed veggies.  His plate looked good and he finished it all up, so thumbs up.We tried one of their deserts, I don't remember what they call it, but some sort of pizza cookie. A chocolate cookie + Ghirardelli chocolate squares + chocolate ice cream= Chocolate Coma. The desert was definitely decadent and rich, not something you can eat every day, but definitely worth it. Our server was nice, but not very helpful.  I think we had three different people bringing our food and water, so we were never lacking anything.  I can't really say much more about the service.

I asked for it to be coked medium, and it was cooked medium well to well.  I'm a believer in meat being juicy, so that's an annoyance for me.  Not enough to send it back, but enough to irritate me.  It also wasn't terribly flavorful.  For a burger with that name, you better be knockin' my socks off with some flavor, know what I'm sayin'?I had the freckled lemonade, which was good (although they should find you a bigger straw if you're expected to suck strawberries through it), and I always enjoy the fries.

The latter was very good, nice and crispy on the outside and tender on the inside with lots of capers.  The brat was very slender, and the flavor was quite mild compared to what I am used to (I grew up in Milwaukee eating Usinger's!)  My companions all really enjoyed their entrees, and we were too stuffed to even consider desert, though we did get a piece of cherry strudel to go.  The strudel was mostly gone by morning, everyone had to pick at it.  The strudel was a bit dense, but great flavor.The setting is an old building on the lower level with very low ceilings.

I really liked this place the first time, but I wasn't sure if it really was five star worthy. After checking out the Short North location, I'll probably be back here quite often. As far as this location goes, it's very similar to the one at Easton size-wise, but I think the bar itself is a little smaller. I do wish the front windows opened to the street, but that's only a small gripe.I had heard that the wings here were awesome, and I love grilled wings, so we had to put an order of those in for an appetizer. Our server was incredibly helpful and friendly in answering questions about the pizzas as well as making recommendations to my girlfriend for beer, since she's not a big beer drinker. She went with a cider that she actually really liked.Heads up to everyone: This place only serves beer and wine and not liquor, but they have a huge selection of beer.For the main course, we went with a large pizza, half Chicken Gouda and half white-pizza that we customized with garlic, tomatoes, and onions. The wings came out quickly, and they were amazing. Dry rubs are my favorite, and these wings had all sorts of flavor. The creamy Gorgonzola that came on the side was so tasty that I was eating it by itself once the wings were gone. The pizza didn't take long to come out, and I think I've found one of my new favorite pizzas in Columbus in the Chicken Gouda. The Chipotle sauce mixed with the diced chicken, bacon, and scallions was addictive. The pizza was big, but it didn't get soggy toward the center, and I could keep eating the buttery crust for days. The white pizza was good as well, but it didn't top my Chicken Gouda.The pricing here is a little on the high side, but they use high quality ingredients, and the flavor is amazing. I would gladly spend more money in order to try all of the pizzas they have to offer, but it'll be hard to not order the Chicken Gouda each time. Don't be fooled by people telling you this is a sub par chain-y restaurant."},{"name":"Burnside Brewing","address":"701 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Decent beer, but not so impressive menu.

There is no way you can miss this restaurant for several reasons. First, follow the trickle of smoke. The key to an amazing BBQ spot is the smoker, and Terry Black's definitely has it! Second, every car ever is trying to get into this place. That's how I knew I made it. Finally, Terry Black's has some amazing signage. When I walked it, I was jet-li punched-in-the-face by the aroma of BBQ. My mouth began to water and I was placed in a relatively short line. I anticipated having a ridiculously long wait time. I was probably in line for 20 minutes, so it wasn't too shabby. While you are waiting, you can peruse their assortment of local Austin beers or their assortment of goodies such as hot sauce, seasonings, or t-shirts. \\nWhen I made it to the front, you grab a tray and get your sides. Each side is $2.25 but I would recommend getting a pint as it is $5.50 and gives you WAY more. I got one pint of Mac and cheese and one pint of green beans. \\nAfter getting my sides, I got to the good stuff, everything that I was here for: BBQ. \\nI knew of everything I got, I wanted the beef rib. Because I am not in Austin often, I decided to go big or go home. I got 2 big beef ribs and a quarter pound of juicy brisket. \\nI was a happy camper, so I set off to grab my fixins' (pickles, onions, bread, soft drink) and headed to my table. \\nI could hardly wait for my rib so I immediately took to eating it. Y'all. If you're reading this. Just know, I'M IN LOVE. As someone who loves food and eats like a horse, I, too was surprised. IT WAS EVERYTHING. Perfectly soft (like fall off the bone soft), perfectly juicy, perfectly flavored, perfectly smoked. I'm not even sure a food critic could find something wrong with this rib. I've never had a better beef rib in my life. So I obliterated it in 10 seconds or less and couldn't wait to move on. \\nI kill the rib and immediately couldn't wait to start on the brisket. I think I jumped the gun on eating the brisket second. While it was amazing and well-flavored, it could not compare to how amazing the beef rib was. I tried the BBQ sauce with it and actually enjoy eating the meat without the sauce (which is actually how bbq should be enjoyed). \\nThe question isn't IF I will come back, it's WHEN."},{"name":"bartaco","address":"969 Marietta St NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Really nice patio n bar!

He tossed/slammed our iced drinks on the counter, (2 iced coffees and and iced tea), and got the 4th drink incorrect.

The decor is interesting and is a huge improvement over what was there before. I have two complaints, hopefully both of which will be addressed soon. The first is that each time I have been there, I was not given a plate for bread or shared appetizers. This was true at the bar and at a table, and it was clear in both contexts that the food would be shared. It made for a kind of awkward situation. It's the type of thing you'd never think of unless it weren't there, but it's a real pain. Second, they are way over-staffed much of the day, and the surplus waitresses and bar tenders don't seem to know what to do with themselves. My first visit there was kind of uncomfortable because two waitresses basically stood over our shoulders and watched us eat. I imagine they'll adjust the staffing soon.

When we first got their the hostesses were very friendly and quick to offer their opinions as to what burger to order. As a matter of fact person that we encountered that worked their offered their suggestions as to which was the burger to order. Our server was very nice and accommodating. The first thing we ordered were the fries, vodka onion rings, and the sweet potato tots. I thought the fries were pretty tasty, but the onion rings were not really my fave and the tots were crispy on the outside and mushy on the inside. I think I would have liked them better if they were more of the traditional \\"tot\\". I ordered the Bun Mi which was a Vietnamese spicy pork sandwich with pickled veggies on top. VERY GOOD. I had a bite of the Southern which was a fried burger with pimento cheese. It wasn't bad but not my fave.  I also ordered the Butcher which was my absolute fave very nice flavor combinations I would definitely order that again. Lastly I had the Krispy Kreme Shake, sounds a little weird but it was DELICIOUS! Best shake I've ever had. My friends wanted a taste and I honestly have to say I was watching how much they drank because I didn't want to give up TOO much of my delicious drink.

They each have different broths, different levels of spiciness, different meats, and you can choose the type of noodle you want. I guess there's still lots of decisions to make... SO. \\nChoose the ...1) Champion Beef Shank Noodle (5/5): This is your typical beef noodle soup, except done way better. Really meaty broth with extremely tender braised chunks of meat. The meat from this bowl was my favorite. \\n2) Champion Beef Brisket noodle in Clear Soup (5/5): The soup was lighter than 1), which makes it easier and nicer to drink. Both delicious. The sliced meats here are also tender but I didn't enjoy it as much as the chunky ones. Depends on your preference!\\n3) Pan Fried Ground Pork Cake (5/5): It's like XLB meat in a pan fried fashion. Really great appetizer, and it's nice to have a different mix of meat since the rest of the meal was beef-filled.I also had the Champion Braised Beef Noodle in Tomato Soup (4/5), but wouldn't recommend unless you really love tomato soup.

One of my few minor complaints is that there is not much of an option for non-alcoholic drinks, your options are coke or sprite, and you are charged $3.00 for a very small glass of this unremarkable beverage without a refill. Maybe they could bring in some of the fun flavored San Pelligrinos that they sell at their sister market across the corner."},{"name":"NAPA Kitchen + Bar","address":"7148 Muirfield Dr","city":"Dublin","stars":"4","text":"Wow!

There you get not only all of their sausages, but the entire gamut of sides. The green beans are out of this world!  Probably the most overlooked item on the buffet is the sausage stew (spicy Bahama Mamas, onions, sauce, and pasta). It's out of this world!  The fudge shop is a must stop as well with plenty of good stuff in there as take home or gifts. The peanut butter Buckeyes are amazing."},{"name":"Terry Black's Barbecue","address":"1003 Barton Springs Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I'm from LA so we came to Terry Black's looking for good barbecue since franklins was closed. \\nWe came around 8:30 on a Sunday before they closed and waited in like for about 20 minutes.

They were out of the beef rib when we got there so if that's was you're looking for, the get there earlier. But I was only concerned about the brisket. It was amazing. Soooo tender and flavorful.

I drive by this place a few times a week and have always wanted to try it, but after my experience last night, I probably won't return. So here's the thing...I am not Haitian, but I know good Carribean food when I taste it, and I definitely wasn't knocked out by the food at Highland Creole. First, I'll start with the food that was actually acceptable, and what we went there for: the Creole Fish and Creole Goat.  I was surprised when my fish came out and it was an entire fish, (that had been properly emptied of organs and such) complete with head, but it was relatively easy to eat, once I learned how to work my way around the pin bones in the fin. I was glad that it wasn't just a generic piece of fish. The sauce was okay, though a bit oily, and the dish itself was pretty salty, but I enjoyed eating it.  My fianc√© ordered the Creole Goat and it was good, with a salty, tasty sauce.  The rice and beans were mediocre in my opinion, and there was such a large portion that we ended up taking most of it home.  You know your rice and beans are mediocre when you take it home and plan to add spices, sauce, and more beans to it before eating it again. My fianc√© also ordered the \\"Papaye\\" juice, and while I know papaya doesn't have the strongest flavor, the \\"juice\\" which was basically a smoothie, was almost completely flavorless.  A different flavor would probably have been better... Mango, maybe?The plantains were, by far, the star of the meal.  Yum.So why two stars, you ask? It all started with the salad and bread before the meal.  While I always appreciate complimentary food, I honestly think I would have given this place three stars if we hadn't been given either item at all.  The salad was iceberg lettuce with two pieces of flavorless tomato and a few slices of red onion, and for dressing, they brought two ginormous bottles of Wishbone salad dressing to the table with torn, greasy labels.  The worst part, by far, was the bread.  I have read other reviews - someone called the bread \\"warm, French bread\\" - but our experience was that someone had literally put HOT DOG BUNS in the toaster.  I repeat: HOT DOG BUNS. And not even the substantial kind.  Granted, they were the ones that you would have to cut yourself, so it could have been worse (though not much), but I pity the fool who thinks this is french bread.  It was warm, to their credit, which I appreciated, because the only bread item worse than a warm hot dog bun, is a cold hot dog bun.As others have said, the decor and ambience leave something to be desired.  I feel like if the owners stuck with what they know (Haitian food) and stopped trying to give us Americanized \\"bread\\" and \\"salad,\\" they might be able to spend a few dollars on more appealing lighting, salad dressing carafes (though they wouldn't need these if they stopped trying to make salad) and napkins that don't rip when you wipe your hands. Finally, I didn't try to find a bathroom, so I'm not sure if there even is one, but if there is, there is definitely no need for two giant bottles of hand sanitizer on the half-wall in the dining room.  They don't need any more eyesores in the joint, and people can use a sink if they need to clean their hands. I did use the hand sanitizer, but it was only because it was there.  I figured it must be there for a reason...(?) Yikes.Let me know if this place improves, and maybe I'll return."},{"name":"Parish Cafe and Bar","address":"361 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"We were seated after the requisite 40 minute wait, and we put in an order for drinks--only to wait nearly half an hour for our wine and beer to arrive.

We also had their chicken karaage, which is what I think they are most known for because it's very good. The bowls were around $6 each plus 3 pieces of karaage was around $4 , so the price was very reasonable. They don't have free water or tea ( didn't notice it anywhere) but you can buy a cold green tea drink for .50 cents when you buy a meal which was very delicious and refreshing.

I don't blame that on Checkers  though. That's life in Atlanta.  I often go through the drive in to avoid them.

When I do eat there at the outdoor tables, I often order an extra burger that's on special. More often than not someone will come ask for money.  I don't give money, no no...but I will offer the extra burger and most of the time they will eat it and be thankful.

The location is just 3 blocks north of the NW 23rd ave streetcar stop. Living my entire life in the south before I moved to Portland, I have eaten quite a bit of classic southern food and BBQ. I can say that the food here is quite fantastic. Is it BBQ and potato salad the way your grandmother in Alabama made it? Maybe, or maybe not, depending on how she made it. Maybe it is better. This is classic southern foods served up with great care to deliver a powerful flavor, and presented with a very impressive aesthetic. It's maybe not always classic and traditional (I have never seen grit sticks in the south, but they sure are good. But on the other hand, the south is a big place, they could be out there.) Southland offers 6 different varieties of BBQ sauce. It is also a Whiskey Kitchen, so has over 100 different whiskeys and much of the food is cooked with some whiskey flavor! Service is excellent and very friendly. The design and decor of the restaurant is very pleasing, with attention to every detail down to the Boraxo powdered soap in the restrooms!There does not seem to be an abundance of such restaurants in Portland, so this is welcome addition.Tips:\\nOrder the grit sticks.\\nGet your your favorite whiskey old fashioned."},{"name":"Seize The Bagel","address":"13215 SE Mill Plain Blvd, Ste C3","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"There's a reason there is almost always a line.

I liked both but the fish stood out more to me. First of all you get a generous serving of fish in the taco. It is not like a lot of other places that skimp out on the fish. Also, the fish is grilled not fried. It was flavorful and came out piping hot! The salsas and guacamole were also spot on. The portion size of the guac is rather small, which is probably my only complaint about it. Beware though, the red salsa is very spicy!

It is a little pricier than some of my favorites in the North End, but it's a great date night spot in the North End & they take reservations on open table which is nice. My boyfriend and I ordered an appetizer which was one of the specials. It was the fried zucchini with a delicious sauce over it. Although I felt like all I could taste was fried food & barely the zucchini. We didn't even finish it & it was pretty tiny (and WAY overpriced). We just dipped the bread in the sauce it came with because that was really the only good thing about the appetizer. Both entrees were very good -- I got one of the specials which was pasta in a pesto sauce with scallops. Very good - my boyfriend got the raviolis which were delicious, but also seemed a bit overpriced. The ambience here is wonderful. It's a very small place -- probably sits between 20-30 people.

I'm still skeptical, having now tried it, but would consider going back.Pros: The decor is perfectly homey, clean, and bright. It reminds me of riverfront restaurants on the St Johns, very laid back and relaxed. The sweet tea was exactly what I wanted, just sweet enough to please without tasting like candy. The hand pies were warm and gooey and perfectly baked. The service was friendly, attentive, and never overbearing or fake.Cons: The food was nothing to write home about. While the chicken was hot and clearly just fried, it was a little overly crispy for my taste, and a little heavy-handed on the pepper in the coating. The sides (we tried creamed corn, collards, biscuits, bread pudding, hoppin john, mac and cheese, and rice and gravy at our table) were okay, really - they tasted like they should have, but nothing unique or outstanding about them.All in all, it was good to try, but I'm not craving a return trip any time soon."},{"name":"China Cooks Chinese Restaurant","address":"215 Northwood Dr NE, Ste 9","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I've lived in the area just south of this restaurant since before it existed.

I've been coming here since before Canton Cooks was started and copied exactly what China Cooks had been doing awesomely.  \\nThe hood is a bit shoddy.  The building and amenities are not the best kept, and the servers are not the happiest people around...but the food is amazingly good! This place has some of the best Cantonese food around.  I'd say the top five in Atlanta would be Royal China, China Cooks, Oriental Pearl, Hong Kong Harbor and Canton Cooks.  A few other smaller hole in the wall restaurants, like Ming's BBQ, with more limited menus are great and exist, but they're kind of in a different arena in my mind.    \\nAt China Cooks try the Hong Kong style wonton soup, walnut shrimp, anything salt and pepper, the combination crispy chow fun noodles or combination ho fun with egg gravy, the steamed chicken with Chinese sausage and mushrooms, eggplant with garlic sauce (try adding shrimp)...it's all delicious!   Also if you come on the weekends they serve authentic Chinese dessert soups...must try.  \\nAnyway, like someone else said, if you stick with the authentic stuff, you will not be disappointed.

The boyfriend and I decided to hit this place for happy hour on a Saturday night, as I had previously skimmed through their menu online, and had a gift certificate from the event I had gone to. I loved the location (super easy to find, but parking was street-side for us), and the ambiance of it as well. The best way to describe the decor and setup would probably be southern type turned modernized hipster, and it actually fits it's location perfectly. First thing you see coming in is a well organized bar, there's repainted & recycled wood that makes up the back wall by the booths, and strategically placed tables throughout. I probably don't do it justice, but it looks LEGIT.We sat down and began browsing the menu after making a pact that this was an ALL-OUT kind of night, because hey, $25 gift certificate. We started with a round of Moscow Mules (which were disappointingly weak) and ordered 3 plates between the 2 of us. I went with the road-side burger, my boyfriend went with the pulled pork sandwich, and we split the house smoked chicken thigh. The burger was pretty plain, and we were both disappointed that this place serves chips instead of fries, but this was quickly forgotten once we had a few bites of the pork sandwich, and the chicken thigh. I've never been a fan of pulled pork, but then I tried this sandwich, and now I'm a believer. The chicken was cooked to PERFECTION, and paired wonderfully with the refreshing potato salad. My boyfriend's sandwich put us in such a good mood, that we decided on another round of drinks. They made them stronger this time, which I certainly appreciated. (There's another breed of people that complain about drinks being too strong, but I personally want more liquor for my money, PLUS drinks can always be watered down for wusses.) We finished the night by getting chocolate pecan pie for my date, and the pecan sundae for myself. Both were brilliant, and though we were on the brink of explosion, we wiped the plates totally clean. Ended up paying a $55 tab (which is freaking AWESOME considering how much we binged,) before we rolled out the door full and happy.

But when the creative consultant behind the concept is local celebrity chef, Richard Blais, you can expect the simple classics to have some very modern updates.Located on Howell Mill just past Chattahoochee Avenue, Flip Burger Boutique looks and feels like a retro burger joint with Sex and the City flair. From the outside of the building, large windows reveal a dimly lit dining space with patrons swathed in flattering candlelight. The interior aesthetic could be best described as a post-modern Johnny Rocket's. Stark white predominates, highlighted by flashes of red and chrome. A bar flanks almost the entire length of the room, opposite a few cushy benches set into intimate alcoves. In the center of the space, two rows of adjoining high-top tables create a communal feel, which is ideal, since you'll invariably be tempted to peek over to see which of Flip's many gourmet burgers your neighbor settled on. At the rear of the restaurant is the open-air kitchen where you can observe two chefs feverishly churning out the goods.The burger offerings are split into two categories, beef (organic, of course) and 'flip'- non-beef alternatives that will satisfy vegetarians, those who shun red meat, and anyone with a hankering for a pork patty. All of the burgers are slider-sized and served on buns that are part-Kaiser, part Hawaiian sweet roll. Actually, they're more like sliders on steroids, so depending on how hungry you are, one might suffice, but two are recommended for larger appetites and for indecisives like me and my friends. Among the three of us, we sampled 4 different selections:From the Beef side:\\nButcher - with red wine jelly, caramelized onion and Cabrales blue cheese, this burger was my absolute favorite. The red wine jelly and caramelized onion added a hint of sweet and a lot of savory, while the tiny amount of Cabrales blue packed a tangy, funky punch.Southern - featuring a fried patty w/pimento cheese, was definitely my least favorite. I'm not a huge fan of pimento cheese, plus the super-crispy coating encasing the burger shredded the roof of my mouth. Not fun.From the Flip side:\\nPo Boyger - A shrimp patty topped with lettuce, tomato, a fried lemon slice and Old Bay mayo. Delicate flavors, but still very very tasty. I was pleased that the patty wasn't overly pureed, and I could still identify what I was eating as shrimp.Bun Mi - An interpretation of the Vietnamese banh mi hoagie-style sandwich. This burger features a ground pork patty topped with cilantro and pickled veggies. It's spicy, exotic, and complex - I can definitely see it becoming one of the restaurant's more popular creations.For our sides we ordered a sampling of sweet potato tots, french fries, and vodka battered onion rings. Accompanying them were ketchup, a dill mayo, and a honey mustard. Fries and rings were decent, nothing terribly remarkable about either. The tots were slightly disappointing - while the flavor was great, the texture was more mushy than crispy.For dessert, we ordered one of each of the shakes on the menu - The Krispy Kreme and the chocolate. The Krispy Kreme actually has doughnuts blended into the vanilla ice cream base, and the chocolate shake comes topped with marshmallows given the hand-torch toasting just before being served. The shakes are cooled with liquid nitrogen, which aside from just sounding, well...cool, actually makes for a thick, creamy treat that stays that way until the last slurp.My bill - which included 2 burgers, a side, and a shake - came to over $20. With the baby burgers averaging about $8, it'll be interesting to see how well the restaurant performs after the initial excitement wears off and the reality of a tight economy settles back in.cheers,k\\nwww.bonvivantonline.com"},{"name":"Clay Pit","address":"1601 Guadalupe St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Please save your money.

Well, unfortunately, The Breakfast Club missed the mark for me. A reviewer before me summed it up well with \\"diner food at a premium\\". On the positive side of things, this is a neat 80s themes diner, music and all. For those familiar with the movie, about half of the menu is themed as well; pretty cool stuff. I ordered the seasonal pumpkin pecan pancakes. While they were fine , somehow adding pumpkin, spices, and half a handful of pecans more than doubles the price of their buttermilk option coming in at a hefty $8.99. Hey guys, Denny's has the same seasonal pancakes for about five bucks. No pecans though, so there's that. If say they were too sweet too, especially\\nCompared to their standard buttermilk, which I tried some of as well. My mom got the chicken sausage omelette, also seasonal. She wanted egg whites, a $1.50 premium. This tipped her meal over $10. Was the food bad? No. Great? Nope. Once again, I could get something similar at Denny's. That's not a bad thing, but when prices are that much more, well, yeah it is...Wife got \\"the basket case\\", which came with eggs (she chose scrambled), four strips of bacon (that was generous, usually see two or three), some toast (meh), home style fries (slightly burnt but some might like that) and two buttermilk pancakes. Pancakes were the best part. The rest was ok, but forgettable. Lastly, we got the banana and Nutella shake. It may as well have been just banana, which is ok since I love bananas and banana shakes aren't too common, but my wife was bummed by the lack of Nutella, of which she is a big fan. It certainly could have done with more. A lot more. It was all but lost in the shake. Too bad, I really wanted to love this place.

Now it is on the ground floor of a slightly nicer motel. The place is owned and run by Thai couple. They have supplied the restaurant's decor with pleasant touches. The booths are comfortable, and the furniture is attractive.The food is very good but if you go in hungry, you'll be very hungry before you get your food. It's not that the service is so bad, it just seems like everything is time consuming. Just ordering the appetizer takes five minutes. The appetizer arrives ten minutes later, so there's fifteen minutes right there. The main course takes another twenty minutes even if you ordered it with your appetizer. So dinner, start to finish, can take an hour, and that's if the place isn't crowded (which it usually isn't). If the place is crowded, I might turn around and go elsewhere, especially if I'm hungry.

Its bright and clean atmosphere is the first draw, with a big open kitchen and lots of space (and a kids table with coloring supplies  and toys). \\nThe menu is items inspired by the PNW, which is such a cool idea. There are three sections of the menu - Oregon, Washington, and Idaho. The first time I went, I went with the owner's recommendation and got the Brussels sprouts poutine spud - basically roasty Brussels and bacon in a potato covered in cheese curds and gravy. It was amazing. \\nSecond trip (and I'm stopping here on my lunch more and more often), I ordered their grilled portabella pretzel burger - a seasoned and grilled mushroom with vegan mayo, pickled onions, and arugula on a pretzel bun. Oh my god. It's so good. That's what I've ordered twice now. \\nOverall the owners are exceedingly sweet and attentive, with a clear concept for a restaurant and menu that was very well executed. Their drink menu is impressive, and they even have a root beer on draft. \\nReally, this place is gonna blow up any minute and it'll be impossible to get in for lunch.

Yes I said \\"good\\". Unfortunately, I wasn't blown away, but at the same time I wasn't disappointed. I guess you can just say I was in limbo - In a good way of course! Don't get me wrong, I am a fan of tapas style dining, but for some reason I don't know if my taste buds were up to par that night or maybe because it wasn't just a great match. My fellow grubbers and I decided to dine here for the night. For a party of 11-12, they were able to accept our reservations. What I liked about this place is that they actually DO keep your reservations! Unlike some places who say they \\"reserve\\", but give your table to diners who come in earlier (hoping they will leave prior to your arrival, only to find out that your \\"reserved table\\" is still occupied because the diners are-taking-their-sweet time).  The service was great! They really do take care of you. They were tending to every need and answered every question we asked.  I'm an avid fan of restaurants using farm fresh, local-grown products in their menu, and this is what Navarre is all about. They are also known for their laundry list of wines. They have a menu all alone of the various types of wines they offer (majority red). Front and back listings if I may add.So our dinner clan decided to all go out and order the Chef's Special that night. For approximately $28 ($15 additional if you'd like to have a 3 glass wine pairing of expensive wines with your meal), you can enjoy a fam-bam style of small plates. Of course their menu changes weekly or daily (don't quote me on that but it changes often). I thought the salads they served were mediocre. From the 3-4 salads we received that night. Probably one was delightful. We had a couple sides of  veggies. What I liked was the potato-pancake. Yes it was starchy, but it complimented the mediocre salads I had quite well. The lamb was also yummy as well. The broth, I can't really describe, but I thought the meat was quite tender and emitted various flavors into every bite. I wasn't too fond of the kale side dish, maybe because I'm not a kale fan, but to some of my fellow grubbers, it was exceptional. And sorry I must debunk the HYPE of the claimed \\"best red velvet cake\\". In my opinion, this was NOT the best I've had. And I felt It wasn't prepared quite well.  I felt that grocery store red velvet cakes (which taste a bit artificial) tasted better.  First of all the cake was DRY.  The frosting did not complement the cake. I wasn't quite sure if it was a cream cheese frosting, but it wasn't all that.  I didn't mind the pistachio they had in the cake, but it didn't do it any favors. The cake in the end was abysmal. It was something that was difficult to swallow since the flavors didn't emit red velvet cake at all.Overall, I applaud Navarre on their simple farm-fresh-to-dining ideas and laundry list of wines, but we weren't such a great match in the end. I did go home full from trying all the foods that were available. The Chef's Special did feed the whole clan and we were able to have left overs. I don't know if I will be back, but I would give this place another chance."},{"name":"Baby Acapulco","address":"13609 N I H 35","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"I have been to several of these locations throughout the Austin area and this one is probably one of my favorite ones to visit.I do enjoy their salsa which for me is a staple to these types of places.  They have the usual menu including tacos, burritos, enchiladas, queso, tortilla soup, to name a few.  Their Chicken Tortilla soup is pretty good here, usually fresh with lots of veggies and such in it in a warm chicken broth that is pretty good.They do have a large drink menu featuring many types of margaritas, but I remember back in the day when they were larger, stronger and cheaper.This visit we came later in the evening as we were all hungry and didnt feel like cooking.  The service was pretty decent, warm and welcoming. From the menu we ordered several items as there were four of us.  We had the following:\\nMushroom & Swiss with French Fries - these burgers are huge and cooked as just requested.It comes with the general toppings placed on the side of the plate and of course the mushrooms, which there is a decent amount of and sauteed well, and melty swiss cheese.  The french fries were nothing special, but the burger is pretty dang good.Helen's Combo - this is one of my \\"Go To\\" options for food.

It says it has orange / horchata flavors but I only tasted a slight citrus tang, which didn't really differentiate it that much for me. The lemon poppyseed cake donut reminded me of those lemon loaves from Starbucks, the donut itself felt like a plain one just covered in special frosting that was lemon / poppyseed flavored. Blue Star is definitely a more artisanal donut than some others in the area (cough!), and it leaves you feeling (relatively) fresh. But while the employees are friendly, the donuts aren't anything ridiculously hype worthy in my opinion.. pretty donuts though"},{"name":"Wilfs Restaurant & Bar","address":"800 NW 6th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Stopped in for a bite before my train ride back to Seattle.

Striking out on several BBQ places, we eventually stumbled upon Terry Black's on our way out of Zilker Park. First and foremost, they were open! Yay! When we walked in, we were warmly greeted and told how things work at Terry Black's: grab a tray, pick your side dishes, and then pick your meats. The standard small side dish is $2.25. I tried the Mac N'Cheese, the potato salad, and the corn. The Mac N'Cheese was simple and good - creamy with just the right amount of cheese. The corn was also good as well - crispy and buttery. The potato salad was just average in my book. It needed a little more seasoning. But on to the good stuff - the meats. I tried a slice of the brisket, a beef rib, and a sausage link. They sell their meats by weight (or by the rib in terms of the ribs). The brisket was out of this world, melt-in-your-mouth amazing. Probably the best brisket I've ever had. The rib was also phenomenal, fall-off-the-bone. The sausage link was disappointing but the rest of the meal made it all worth while."},{"name":"Southland Whiskey Kitchen","address":"1422 NW 23rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Really great BBQ meats.

I really like this place, but three stars means \\"A-OK,\\" and that's how I feel about Cherrywood. Let's talk about the good. There's lots of space here, though it's occupied entirely by a sea of small, crowded tables. The vibe is strange - a large, enclosed warehouse space with eclectic decor, that ends up feeling hole-in-the-wall, despite the fact its a large, stand-alone establishment. If you're trying to do work or study, or talk, you can end up feeling kind of swallowed by the size of the room.The coffee is good, but what most people talk about is the food. I've tried numerous menu items, and I've always been pleased but never impressed. Though I believe Cherrywood is a great cafe, the standard of excellence in Austin is understandably high.Cherrywood is a lot of things. It's a coffee shop. It's a bar. It's a cafe. It's a restaurant. They have live music. They have stand-up comedy. It's jokingly Swiss-army-knife-like. And it succeeds in being pretty good at a lot of these things. If anything, Cherrywood's greatest strength is the fact that it possesses a hipster charm in being 'okay' at a lot of things, and not really seeking to be excellent in any of them. But since this review is objective, I think Cherrywood is \\"A-OK,\\" and that's the description of a three-star review.Long live Cherrywood."},{"name":"Thierry","address":"1059 Alberni Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Popped in here for one of the better and more beautiful lattes I've had in a while and a perfect buttery flaky croissant for breakfast.

It's really just a food court with different stations for different dishes.

They are ONLY found here, not next door at Riverside, and nowhere else on site that I'm aware of (Disneyland park DOES have beignets, but not sure about anywhere else at WDW). The decor here is borderline creepy, with the giant floats hanging overhead (some of them of giant heads), but with that said, it's otherwise a pretty busy and boisterous space to get a quick fix before heading out to the parks.I always make a point of visiting Sassagoula Floatworks and Food Factory for their fantastic beignets whenever I'm staying at a nearby resort.

This place has a very nice employee that took our ordered and she was so nice and friendly so kudos to this establishment for that, the place was not that clean but not bad for a usual fast food place that normally gets busy during dinner time even though we came after dinner I was expecting it to be a mess(only a few dirty tables and trays left around)The nice girl that was working the register and taking orders was constantly cleaning the tables and keeping it all organized, I was also happy that the place was clean but that they had sweet tea and all other fountain drinks.The place got remodeled recently and looks really nice inside and even the outside, newer tables and layout inside. The new look makes this Taco Bell more inviting and wanting people to come back. It looks like all Taco Bells in the area are growing thru this.Last time I wrote a review on this business was 5 years ago(2007) but finally I decided to comeback and review this business again. Good experience and over all I like this Taco Bell, plus the service was great for a fast food joint.I did not give this establishment five stars because there was nothing in the food that stands out for it to get five stars and the only thing that was something to remember was the good service of the employee taking our ordered."},{"name":"MOD Pizza","address":"12196 SW Scholls Ferry Rd","city":"Tigard","stars":"4","text":"Tonight we got food at this location, and the food is always good as normal. The guys working the pizza line were so nice and friendly.However, we noticed a younger girl with a dog walk in, in her arms.

This holds true here. I went here with my mom and sister since they like seafood. I'm a steak guy but I've had fish from Hawaii to Denmark to Florida to South Korea, so I might be a little biased on fish quality. They ordered the Florida grouper and swordfish steak, they liked theirs. I ordered one of the specials which was just the Seabass with crab thrown on top and a pile of soggy spinach underneath, I guess it was a flotation device for the pool of soy sauce, oven cooked instead of steamed, the server made it sound good, with a Caesar salad and Brussel sprouts. First, it took a bit for the food to come out but it was busy even on a Tuesday. The waiter was nice and explained how the menu worked and what not. When I got my plate I was pretty disappointed at how it looked. It's a boring plate to look at for sure. The fish needed more time in the oven, it was just starting to get color then it's like they took it out because it was good enough. I took the first bite and it was Luke warm at best and the crab was cold. Not a good combo. I immediately scraped the crab off and choked the fish down which had almost zero taste, I've never had Chilean sea bass so maybe it's suppose to be like that idk. But it was bland fish that had to be dipped in a light watery soy sauce for any flavor. The sprouts were still pretty hard, I like mine cooked a little longer, and they weren't all that flavorful either EVEN with the best known ingredient aka BACON. When I got the check I noticed that scallops, $13 for two lol, was added which I didn't order. When I told the server he went and changed it but told me the crab meat on my bass was going to be around half that, which ended up being $7. What? He never mentioned that my special would be more than the actually menu price. Why am I paying more for cold crab meat? Specials are usually cheaper deal, not this time I guess, they got me good. I didn't fuss about it. The only redeeming factor was the free dessert  because the food took too long. For all the high reviews I was expecting something good. Instead I paid almost $200 and was wanting a cheeseburger after for satisfaction because I didn't eat much. Oh and what's up with the valet blasting my radio? If your vehicle has valet lock, I'd use it, apparently valets just do what they want with your vehicle for the 30 seconds it takes to bring your car. Like what's on that's so important that you need to even touch my radio?

After looking at several restaurant choices we decided to stop at Yak & Yeti. It is a Pan Asian cuisine. The ribs were a ginger barbecue and the house special fried rice had shrimp and other chopped up meat in it we had linguine tossed with onion and garlic saut√©ed mixed vegetables spicy slaw red cabbage with ginger onions and scallions. The atmosphere was booth seating and wooden tables. Lots of Asian artifacts decorated the two floors. Friendly service and waiters willing to please. We sat on the second floor with a view of discovery Island and Himalayan mountains in the backdrop. Many people scurrying about walking through Asia to discovery land  and Africa. Our dining experience was very comfortable. The food was very tasty seasoned well and spicy. I recommend this restaurant if you like spicy  foods with Ginger. So my fellow Yelpers anytime you're in animal kingdom come and check out Yak and Yeti.

The staff was friendly not extremely welcoming but nothing so bad that would turn me away. The food?! Ugh...let me say that the pictures were more appeasing than my actual plate. The burger was uncooked in the middle (very pink). The bun tasted as if it had been soaked in oil (not butter but straight up cooking oil). The fries were hard and oily. Ordered the coffee shake and it had the residual taste of a protein shake (powder mixed with milk).The food wasn't horrible but for this to be a burger joint, I expected more flavor.

The interior is nicely renovated but has such an old-school design and feel that reminded me of something from an 80s movie.I had the pesto benedict, which was a solid dish throughout -- the pesto was a worthy substitute for hollandaise. I also had the coffee oreo milkshake which was seriously fantastic; it was delicious and had great consistency -- I highly recommend it. My only knock on The Breakfast Club is that the service was a bit slow despite only half the diner being full when were ordering. This may have been because the layout of the diner made it difficult for the waitresses to see us from the other end.Overall, I had a pleasant experience and am looking forward to coming back!"},{"name":"Clay Pit","address":"1601 Guadalupe St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I see The Clay Pit through two lenses: (1) the hungry college student and (2) the Indian food lover (though I know next to nothing about Indian food when compared to Indians).Now, the hungry college student perspective: this place is awesomeeee. It's right next to the iSchool, so that's great because I have class there sometimes. But the best part is that the lunch buffet is dirt cheap. It's, what, $7.50? But the secret sauce is that all UT students get those little discount books, and inside that little discount book, you will find a $1 off coupon for Clay Pit's buffet. So that puts us at $6.50 for an all-you-can-eat war with not-so-great-but-who-cares Indian food. Love it.And then there's the Indian food lover perspective. From this perspective, the buffet is disappointing. The dinner menu is an upgrade, that's for sure, but there are better Indian places around.But it's OK, Clay Pit.

We were a bit pressed for time, but our waitress seated us immediately, gave us a couple minutes to decide what we wanted to order, and was back and ready to take our orders the second we set our menus down. On top of that, it didn't take more than 8 minutes or so for our food to come out! And boy was it amazing...We ordered the Le Mistral sandwich and the Rialto sandwich to share. We must have picked the best two options on the menu, because I don't think it's possible to have ordered anything better than what we had. The garden salad (with the Rialto) had the most amazing dressing on it, and was the perfect addition to the sandwich. The sandwich was simple and contained a small number of my favourite things: prosciutto, pesto and buffalo mozzeralla. How could you ever go wrong with that?! My boyfriend ordered the Le Mistral sandwich, which was the most expensive option, and rightfully so; it was incredible. Perfectly cooked beef tenderloin with mashed potatoes, cheese and crispy onions; it tasted like one of my favourite comfort meals packed into a deliciously compact sandwich. If I were to recommend one item at Parish Cafe to a friend, it would be Le Mistral.

However, the last couple times I've been here, I've been a bit disappointed, so my rating is reflective of that.I LOVE the sangria here, it's the best I've ever had... but then they changed the recipe.  I went here a couple months ago, noticed it was a lot more watery than I remember, and sure enough when I mentioned to the waitress (who checked) she confirmed that the restaurant did change it.  Why they did that - no idea.I went here last week to order what has become my ultimate comfort food.  Not mac-n-cheese... the Asado Negro - stewed beef, rice and plantains.  The rice, which was typically a nice homemade sticky, perfectly seasoned, slightly buttery rice is now what tastes like 90-second rice you put in the microwave. GROSS.  I couldn't even eat it.  The stewed beef, while the sauce and flavor was still the same, and oh so good, was completely distracted by the fact that the beef is now tough thinly sliced slabs of beef and not that fall-off-the-bone post roast style beef.  The plantains, still good.  But overall, I was so disappointed that I requested to have a different entree all together.Not sure what Orinoco is doing, but whatever it is they need to stop it and go back to the stuff they know is good and stop being cheap.

Glad we did too because we got our drinks and ordered out food long before those who were in line near us even entered the building.Anyway, we both got the classic burger and it was one of the best burgers I've had. My wife got their margarita and loved it and I got a Fireman 4 draft beer. While I'm not usually a desert type of guy they talked me into getting a milkshake, which was also amazing! I got the Nutella & Chocolate Pretzel... Highly recommend it! If you're in the area and don't mind the wait for some good food, you should give this place a try!

But a corn tortilla folded and filled is a taco, whereas a filled wheat tortilla is a burrito. Deep fry a burrito, it's a chimichanga. Toast a tortilla, it's a tostada. Roll it, it's an enchilada.\\" -- One Day (2011)Oh Bartaco, how I really wanted to love you. For now, we'll just be friends, ok?We came here as a group of 11 (and a half - baby on board) on Friday and had given the restaurant fore-warning. They seated us outside in the blazing summer heat (in mid-July, at 12:30pm). And understanding we were a larger group, I figured outside might happen. However, I did see some large tables also seated inside. How here is what surprises me most - no umbrellas or shade of any kind at the tables...nothing. AND the attire for the waitstaff seemed to be long-sleeved button down shirts and long white jeans. Poor saps.After 5 minutes, we were all dripping in sweat - it was not pretty. Our waiter was very nice and gave us instruction on how things worked as we were downing our tiny glasses (old-fashioned-sized) with ice water from carafes where the ice was melting as fast as we were. The ordering process is easy - fill out little order cards (they need a place for names and seat numbers) and that's it. If you need a server, there is a dark blue credit card you place in a holder and someone stops immediately - this is by far the most brilliant idea in ages! And it seriously works.Now - we were dying, the mama and baby had to move to an abandoned table quickly as they were dying in the heat and that table had very little shade. The rest of us were miserable and finally called for help (hello blue card). And we pleaded for relief and the staff was quick to apologize and tell us they would do what they could, but they had to wait for people to leave and they were busy, and there was a wait. Sigh.Some food began to trickle out. I got my Mexican corn - grilled on the cob (cut in half) covered in lime, cotija cheese, cayenne pepper and it was hot - but so was I. I was too uncomfortable to eat it as I donned my sunglasses and dabbed my forehead. We caved and blue-carded again and said we would split into smaller tables just to be comfortable. So we moved to 2 tables - built for very short people or children having tea parties with dolls.The table came to my knees - why? So very odd - I really didn't understand this at all. Finally more food began to come out and I was cooling down a little (the sun was still beating down on my back) so I ate my corn. And then the real mess began. As food came out, there was all kinds of confusion - tacos were messed up on trays. I ended up with the right types of tacos, but to many. I was told not to worry about it and I was only pay for the 3 I ordered. But I was one of the last people to get my tacos. They pace the food like a tapas restaurant, which I wish we would have been told.I loved the sesame ribeye and the porkbelly was the best! The portabello was great - but rated 3rd of the 3 I ate. They are small, but 3 plus the corn was really enough for me, but for most I think it would not be enough.  As for paying, the corn was not on my check, but the 3 tacos were (albeit the wrong ones). The server told me it was his fault and not to worry about it (as his shirt was drenched in perspiration). I felt for him as most of this cluster did not appear to be his fault or problem, but he was trying his level best. The whole operation seems disorganized and poorly designed. He looked to frustrated and deflated - It seemed like this was not the first time.I may try again, but inside only. Their outside design needs serious work. The food is saving them from a 2 star review. The food is great."},{"name":"Kaya Restaurant","address":"581 Boylston St Lbby","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"I am Korean and I would not recommend this Korean-Japanese restaurant to anyone.

I would sub out their potatoes au-gratin with french fries or something else though. I loved the asparagus that came with his dish! all in all, a highly recommended spot for date night! it can get crowded even for a wednesday evening. so im sure on weekends there is a well worth it wait. definitely bring your cutest friend and your best loved one here because it is well worth the drive from cbus! note: the service was impeccable! i forgot to get our waiter's name but i loved how friendly and inviting he was!

Paired with some nice white wine, you could taste that they knew what to do with a fillet, but nothing that would make me come back for more.

Umm, as long as you avoid the Chinese. Don't get me wrong: the Chinese food isn't bad, it's just that it's your standard Americanized-Chinese buffet fare: chicken, beef, and pork in cloyingly heavy sauces. They have some more upscale items, like salmon, but their upscale items get dried out after sitting under the heat lamps for a while, and aren't that great even if you get to them right as they're delivered. And they've got the  usual stuff like pizza, for picky eaters who walked into a Chinese buffet but didn't want Chinese food.The freshness of the sushi isn't bad, for a buffet, but the rolls are 99 and 44/100% pure rice and .56% sushi.So why am I giving this place five stars? First of all, expectations are just lower at a buffet. But more importantly, the Korean food here is actually good. Multiple types of kimchi, bulgogi, soup, seaweed salad, jap chae, not to mention multiple variates of ceviche (including Korean octupus ceviche), plus a good selection of dumplings. If you just want one dish, you can do better for the same price at Korean Grill, Manna, Misung 888, New Oriental Market, Chosun Galbi, Shilla, Osaka Mansun, Odaku Sushi, or Korean Garden, but you can't beat the variety here."},{"name":"Fresh Start Cafe and Bakery","address":"24 N Sandusky St","city":"Delaware","stars":"4.5","text":"Very friendly baristas (I've been 3 times and they already remembered my drink!), delicious pastries, and a clean, chill atmosphere!"},{"name":"Medina Cafe","address":"780 Richards Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Cute place with plenty of seating.

Everything I tried was authentic and served hot. I loved that each dish really showcased its ingredients with simple flavors additions that left an impact.  Nothing was overly salted!

Desta had this cool, corner cafe feel with yellow trim, reminding me of past wanderings through Brussels and Paris, passing popular bistros, bakeries or quiche restaurants.  Desta was on an odd lot, adding all the more to it's charm, and the food did not disappoint.An impulse decision, like this, which I often make, always works out to my favor.  I'll tell you why.  I have this curse:  90+ % of planned outings (by me) to restaurants, sometimes to the dismay of my party, turn out to be a bad experience, or no experience at all - due the restaurant's folding, or being unaware of it's day off, it's changed location, or it's changed hours.   This was a first in trying Ethiopian food, so I can only imagine how good it would be in it's native setting.  I ordered the Kitfo Dulet with Shiro.  The lean beef I more or less pictured to be crispy like the Fish Dulet my friend had, but the texture was OK (seemed to be braised or cooked/simmered right in the sauce), but the rich chickpea coulis it came in was very flavorful.  Honestly, I liked Fish Dulet more and could eat that on any sunny day (I'll go with Fish Tibs with Shiro on chilly days).  The meat, the seasoning, the spices, all blended together for what is now one of my favorite meals in ATL.  Tilapia, I will never look at you the same, or less than salmon, tuna, or hamachi.Pardon, but I have to make an ode to one of the ingredients I know was used:Oh butter, humble, yet sublime, you take me away from the daily grind.

We were torn between the hot date and the pig out date, but our waiter (who was very nice and funny as an FYI) made the decision easy by recommending the pig out. We also couldn't decide as to an add-on dessert at the end, and were glad we went with the recommendation of one of the waitresses to get the special of the day, which was a coconut foule (spelling?).I'll start with dessert--it was an awesome ending to a surprisingly filling meal. The coconut foule, with the light airy mousse, little broken up chunks of merengue cookies, and sake soaked berries was light, flavorful, and had an awesome contrast of textures. I could have gone for a 2nd if my friend didn't stop me from being a fatty.As for the Pig Out Date courses, the dishes came out somewhat randomly, with the noodles and sprouts coming out first, and the egg roll and dumplings coming out last. Overall, my impression of the cooked food is somewhat mixed. The egg roll, though crispy and meaty, was lacking in flavor for me, even when dipped in the accompanying orange-y sauce. It needed either some more aggressive seasoning or a zingier dipping sauce, IMO. The sweet and sour brussel sprouts didn't taste very sweet our sour to me, but I loved the way they were cooked, and they actually tasted better the next day. The pork dumplings and the dan dan noodles were good, but they were pretty comparable to items you could get at a regular szechuan or taiwanese restaurant.Overall, I'd be back for dessert again and to try some of the other dishes on their menu as the service was good and the food decent."},{"name":"Cherrywood Coffeehouse","address":"1400 E 38th 1/2 St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Great brunch spot and patio area.

For me, the place is overpriced and underwhelming. I ordered the vegetable korma - I generally really appreciate korma's rich, savory, sinfulness. I got the korma at the *hot* spice level, also.What I got was nearly an abomination to my palette. Sure, it was rich, but the sauce was crunchy (they did not grind the cashews/almonds into a fine/semi-fine paste in the korma to make it a divine, sinful sauce as one would expect in traditional korma) as they did some half-assed rough chop of the nuts. This really detracted from the dish as the sauce was not rich enough and the vegetables were overshadowed by me constantly grinding cashews in every bite. Second, despite ordering *hot*, my dish was anything but - rather, I got a dish that bordered sweet.This place is an elegantly-presented fa√ßade: sure they have a nice atmosphere and service, but the food is not good Indian food by any means."},{"name":"Verde Cocina","address":"524 NW 14th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"I had a mimosa it was great. the bartender Fernando was a really nice guy and seemed liked he enjoys his job :)"},{"name":"Medina Cafe","address":"780 Richards Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"First meal in  Vancouver and I am glad we chose this place.

The sandwich is also really difficult to eat because the rice paper is a little tough. The entire sandwich just fell apart, and I ended up eating it with a fork and knife. The ingredients were fresh, the tuna was cooked well, and the fries were great. But overall, the flavor of the entire sandwich was just plain weird.Service was so slow. It took the waitress 15 long minutes just to bring us our bill. I asked for paper napkins and my waitress forgot, so I had to flag down someone else. Still, she was sweet and really enthusiastic about the menu. The restaurant is really beautiful inside and out. My friend and I decided to eat on the patio, which I would recommend if you decide to come here. I'm willing to give this place a second chance, but when I come back, I'll just stick to a regular burger or sushi. And probably a handspun milkshake--the coffee/chocolate combo is really good."},{"name":"Yak & Yeti Restaurant","address":"Disney's Animal Kingdom Theme Park 775 Werikhe Way","city":"Lake Buena Vista","stars":"4","text":"Asian Fusion food served at a sit down restaurant with lots of Asian decor!

There's a salad bar, multiple pizza choices, a couple pasta choices. And a couple of dessert choices. The inside was clean and there was a lot of staff working. The pizza was ok. The salad bar was ok. But unfortunately there wasn't anything super special. This is a nice place to take your kids as they have a game room.

I have never been to a place where the meat is weighed so after eying the ribs I asked for 4 of them. It was not by any means a particularly large portion. It was comparable to any other local restaurants serving. So my jaw just about hit the floor when the cashier told me my total was $22 and some change. I was caught a little off guard and I came very close to leaving the restaurant. Had I not been with a friend who had just ordered a couple slabs of brisket and two sides (for about $15) I would have. In all fairness I must admit the ribs were excellent. Meaty, juicy, nicely seasoned and highly enjoyable. The sides were absolutely no different than you would find anywhere else in town. So I'm giving this restaurant a 3 star rating based on the overall experience. And I'm still wondering if I had been there 15 minutes later would I have gotten the same plate of food for $11.All in all I'll stick with Green Mesquite or even the pit at Whole Foods.

Parking can be a bit of a challenge, but thankfully we went after peak lunch hours and found a spot. The idea is you stand in line, scoop your sides, and then tell someone what meats and how much you would like. For sides we had mac and cheese and coleslaw, both pretty solid. We then got two types of sausage, a regular and spicy that wasn't really that spicy. Both were delicious! Crunchy on the outside and a nice meaty texture on the inside. The brisket was decent, but was a bit too dry for our taste. Lastly we had ginormous beef ribs. All I can say is wow! The meat was so tender and juicy that it melted in your mouth. One rib was enough for us to share with the other items we got. For all of the above items mentioned, we paid almost $60, so it is a bit pricey for two.

I like them better than most any other edible item out there. I pay tribute to them with a tattoo. I take them seriously, too seriously sometimes. I probably (definitely) love them. If donuts were a sports team, I'd have a personalized jersey and wear it religiously, even in the off season. Donuts are all that is right in this world. And, once a year, on National Donut Day, I treat myself to really good ones. Caloric consequences be damned that day. Bring on the supreme dough-y happiness!\\n \\nThis is my first National Donut Day in Portland. But I've done my research. And I've chosen Blue Star. What? You thought Voodoo? No. Donuts shouldn't change with every passing fancy and they shouldn't be a novelty for the sake of being novel. They should taste super good and sometimes push the limits of what is expected. I said I take this stuff seriously, yo.\\n \\nI pulled up to the curb at 6:30 am. Three people are in line ahead of me. Damn. But not so damn. Because when the doors open a half hour later at 7:00 am, the line is at least 30 people deep. I'm actually in a primo spot. Because things don't move quickly here. There aren't a bunch of donuts sitting around waiting to be sold. The kitchen, fully visible in all its glory, is actively making donuts--dough is being kneaded and dipping is being done and it all looks so magical I could squeal. Like a pig. Like the pig I am about to gluttonously become.\\n \\nAt roughly $3 apiece, I limited my order to a Raspberry, Blueberry Bourbon Basil, and Lemon Poppy. The Raspberry and BBB were good. I liked them. The dough was marvelously soft and chewy. The flavors were on point. I'd probably be raving about them had I not ordered the Lemon Poppy. Because that LP donut, well, that was the star of the show.\\n \\nI'm optimistic about my potential for finding and consuming good donuts, but I am firm in my belief that Blue Star's LP is most likely going to wear the Best Donut I Ate in 2015 crown. It has this perfect dough acting as base and so much lemony goodness sealing the deal. It's a sweetness that's been tamed so as to strike a beautiful balance, not saccharine like a lot of good donuts gone bad. And topping it all off are the poppy seeds, sophisticated sprinkles of sorts, lending tiny hints of crunch to this divine donut experience.Take a bow, Blue Star; your donuts are pure perfection."},{"name":"Medina Cafe","address":"780 Richards Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"I really loved this place, and on my trip to Vancouver before I moved here I went there twice in a span of 3 days!

Both are a short walk from my hotel so today I hit up both.Blue Star is gourmet donuts - $3.50 for the one I bought, Mexican Hot Chocolate. I ate half: it was tasty, not too sweet with a moist but dense cake. After half I was stuffed, and maybe a little uncomfortable stomach-wise.Don't get me wrong - this is a good donut. The frosting was delectable. There was overflow that seeped onto the wax serving paper and I found myself scraping it off and licking my finger clean. But, half a donut and some extra frosting in and I'm finished? What's up with that? Did I mention, it's a kind of dense cake?This is a spotlessly clean, light and airy space with comfortable stools along the windows on two sides. The clientele looked more upscale as a whole than at Voodoo (but with the much higher prices that's not surprising). There is also a smaller, more curated selection of donuts that I'm sure changes frequently. If high end donuts is your thing, this is the place you want to be. FYI, not sure why but there was no line here at all at 2pm and there were plenty of donuts.

Three different rices, three different meat entrees and two traditional stews as well as a decent variety of greens, dips, and other sides to choose from. A large group automatically gets charged a service fee but that is NOT considered a tip. Even if you split the checks the fee is split as well. For the lunch buffet, it averaged out to just under $20 to include the fee and drink. A non buffet item to try is their pistachio ice cream made with saffron and rose water. Naan was served warm at the table and it's a shared item so be ready the rip and split one large piece. It's is connected to a Persian market and that too is worth checking out.

With a big glass of horchata - the cups are so huge they might as well just give you a bucket and be done with it - it's a very satisfying meal. The pastries in the bakery are similar: not mind-blowing, but they hit the spot for brunch, with the requisite horchata trough of course.What I really like about Casa Maria is the atmosphere, especially when there's live music. It's almost the platonic ideal of a friendly neighborhood restaurant, and I spent a really lovely afternoon there eating chips and salsa and watching World Cup soccer with other folks who live nearby.

The wait was a half hour, which allowed us a lovely stroll around the area.I don't mean to start out on a sour note, but the service wasn't stellar. We weren't checked on very often and we had at least four different people help us while we were there. Each individual was very nice, but it was a little odd. But they were busy, so it wasn't a big deal.I got a seasonal drink which was ok, but not fantastic. I don't think it was worth the $10. The boyfriend attempted to get a cider, but they were out.The food reviews from the two of us are mixed. The boyfriend got the meatloaf club, which is a club sandwich that includes huge slabs of meatloaf. He said it was super tasty, a five star sandwich. I got the mac and cheese, which fell flat for me. The cheese topping was good, but the cheese sauce that covered 98% of the meal was really bland. However, this place is known for their sandwiches, so it's possible that I got one of their less awesome meals. For dessert we split an ice cream sandwich (fitting for a sandwich bar), which was soooooo so good; two warm chocolate chip cookies, hard vanilla ice cream, and chocolate sauce. The prices were reasonable, about fitting for the type and quality of food they served.

Honestly, I think it's a bit overrated. We arrived at the door 10am sharp and there was this huge list and surprisingly there was a girl a few slots ahead of me with the same name and also for a party of two. Instead of getting us mixed up, they took down my friend's name instead. We were quoted a 45-60 min wait so we head down to Starbucks to chill.We came back 30 mins after to try our luck and what do you know, we got two seats at the bar. We were handed the menu and I was immediately overwhelmed with the choices. They all somewhat seemed similar but with a bit of a twist. I finally decided upon the Fricass√©e which consists of 2 Fried Eggs, Braised Short Ribs, Roasted Potatoes, Caramelized Onions, Applewood Smoked Cheddar, Seasonal Greens with Grilled Focaccia. My friend had the Wolves Breakfast (In-House Cured Peameal Bacon, Double Smoked Medina Bacon, Andouille & Merguez Sausage). I also ordered the  Susurluk Soda which seem to peek my interest. It was a Yoghurt drink with Kabosu Citrus Juice, Sencha Syrup, Jasmine Water, Fleur de Sel, and topped with Roasted Green Peppercorns. It was nice to see my drink made in front of me- a virgin cocktail for the morning. It's hard to describe the drink, but if you like Calpico and club soda, I'd say this is the adult version to it with a twist. It didn't take long for our food to come and taking a look back at the door, there were still a long line of hungry diners. We took some pictures and quickly dug in. The Fricass√©e, served in a cast iron skillet, was rich from the tomato sauce base and with each bite I discover different elements in the dish. I loved how the melted cheese was hidden underneath the sunny side-up eggs and arugula. The shaved apple at the top gave the dish a refreshing touch, though it didn't quite cut through the richness of the sauce. The downside of this dish was the roasted potatoes. It had a weird earthy potato taste to them and I wish they'd served this dish with two pieces of Focaccia since one wasn't enough to soak up all the sauce. The Wolves Breakfast was to our surprise a pretty small portion. It represented a Carnivore's take on the cheeseboard, hence the name Wolves breakfast. My friend enjoyed his meal however he didn't seem blown away. I can't really comment much about the service as there really wasn't much services needed nor provided.

The location is easy to find, centered in the popular 78704 area on busy Barton Springs rd of south Austin. When walking up, you can see the large BBQ hut where all the meats are cooked, which we found pretty neat. They offer outside patio seating as well as inside seating and the restaurant is self service, cafeteria style-which we loved! It allows you to devour in peace not worrying about the next time a server will come around. You start off with a blank tray. Then as the line moves closer to the food items, you have options to pack as many sides as you'd like in 3 different sized cartons (largest being a full quart). You are charged for the price of the particular carton regardless of which side you pack it with. And the meat is freshly cut right in front of you, with your preference of amount or part of meat. The meat is then weighed, side cups are added up, and you pay up front. We ordered the mac n cheese, creamed corn, beans, beef & pork ribs and banana pudding. Besides the [mediocre] beans, everything was phenomenal! The beef ribs were my favorite. The flavor was really something else.. and the saltiness was not overboard either.

Ghion Cultural Hall is located on Cheshire Bridge Road just past the traffic light for Faulkner Road on the left.  The restaurant is attached to the Blue Rat, which has a more colorful and noticeable sign.  Parking is challenging.  The lot is small and there's no street parking on Cheshire Bridge.  Strongly recommend carpooling or taking an Uber/Lyft/taxi.  The main dining area of the restaurant is small, but it has a cool ambiance and the mesob (basket) tables that are frequently found in Ethiopian restaurants.  Kitchen area is visible through a sliding window and there are a few tables for medium sized groups.Hoping someone from Eat24/Yelp online ordering reads my review - it's very convenient for the customer, but not as convenient for the business.  Apparently Eat24 calls the restaurant notifying them of a new order without telling them what is in the order?  I recommend that you call this restaurant directly to place your order - this inconvenience should definitely not be held against the restaurant.  The owner cooked my meal when I arrived and she was very friendly.On the Menu: Ghion Cultural Hall has vegetarian, lamb, and beef dishes.   As with most Ethiopian restaurants around here, you can order a combo (Ghion Cultural Family Special) which comes with a huge mix of meats and veggies and injera (sour spongy Ethiopian bread).  If you have a smaller appetite, you can order individual tibs (meat cube) entrees, kitfo (Ethiopian beef tartare), or firfir (a mix of moist injera and meat). I'm impressed by how they not only have lentils and vegetable dishes, but also vegan protein substitutes.  Their vegan drek tibs and vegan awaze tibs both come with vegan beef. What I Tried:\\nVegan Drek Tibs ($13.00) - The vegan protein only comes at a markup of $1 in comparison to its meat counterpart, which is small compared to how much extra you need to pay to go vegan at other restaurants.  I ordered my dish as takeout and a generous portion of the tibs is hidden in the bottom injera, so don't panic when you only see bread.  In addition to the vegan beef, there are sauteed onions, tomatoes, and jalape√±o peppers.   I liked how my entree was flavorful without being too rich.  The vegan beef doesn't match the texture or flavor of real beef, but it tastes good when cooked with all of the spices.  The dark awaze sauce served on the side gives a little extra heat to the dish.  Injera is comparable in taste and texture to the injera served at other local Ethiopian restaurants.Verdict: This is my favorite vegan Ethiopian plate so far in Atlanta.  I would be equally inclined to order a meat tibs from another restaurant as I would order a vegan tibs from Ghion.  The dining area is cozy and more traditional than some of the other restaurants around here.  Great place for a quiet, low key Ethiopian dinner."},{"name":"Petrone's Pizza","address":"438 Main St","city":"Melrose","stars":"3.5","text":"Petrone's is the best place for pizza in Melrose!

Not sure if they were between shifts or what but there was 2 people behind the bar. They were chatting with each other and stocking glasses and no one spoke to me. I sat there for over 5 minutes with not even the slightest acknowledgement from the 2 people behind the bar. I didn't even have a menu and I was looking up hoping to make eye contact. Finally a waiter walking near the bar area mad eye contact with me and I asked if I could get a menu and perhaps a greeting and some water. I was super annoyed and disappointed.

The COOP has both. The problem is that it's unpaved and I got my fee all wet in a pothole. But, at least there's a private parking area, so I didn't ding them for the parking.The food was good. We split a 3 piece chicken meal and chose to have 3 sides. The chicken was tasty. Homemade is better, but that goes without saying. Unfortunately, Publix and Popeye's both have fried chicken that tastes better to me.The greens weren't bad, but they weren't very tasty either. The mac and cheese tasted like it was from a box. So if you like boxed mac and cheese, you might like this. The bread pudding was delicious. It was so good that I gave them an extra star. It comes with a delicious frosting. It all just melts in your mouth. If the bread pudding is delicious, it's possible that there are other things that are good on the menu.On our way out the car scraped on the potholes in the unpaved lot. Once again, I didn't take any points away for this, but it didn't make me happy. That being said, the unpaved parking lot probably adds to the experience and possibly helps keep prices low.We felt like we got a lot of food for the money. I always complain about food portions, and I can't complain about the COOP. The COOP is very generous. That being said, we saw a Popeye's on the way home with a $5 box special. I feel like I would have been happier at Popeye's, and I don't even like Popeye's!Anyhow, take my review for what it's worth. I'm not a fan of 4River's either, I'm more of a Pig Floyd's man.

Really. You won't find any that compare to Black Betty or Sin A Bomb, and certainly no other doughnuts that will melt in your mouth with every bite like these heavenly, heavenly creations do. I hate to be one of those \\"I'm not a doughnut person but these doughnuts are awesome\\" people, but what can I say? I'm not a doughnut person, but these doughnuts reeeeally are awesome. Having said that, there are some service, pricing, and menu issues that just can't be overlooked. I understand that it's a pretty new location, so for this reason, I can cut you some slack, Gourdough's--so long as you step up your game a little in the near future. The \\"seat yourself\\" kind of structure only works when met with fast and ready service, and during my first experience at Gourdough's, this didn't happen. My guest and I walked in right past the section's server, and it took a good 10-12 minutes before we had to flag her down to get service while she was asking table after table if they had been helped or not yet (not to mention, no one greeted us until then either). So to further my point, seat yourself service doesn't sit well with customers when you have servers going back and forth from table to table asking if they've been served or not. Also, the price of a fountain drink is $3.00, and though it is bottomless, aren't fountain drinks usually provided with free refills for a much more reasonable price? No need to call it bottomless and charge twice the price.Aside from the dessert doughnuts, the menu is essentially bar and pub food, but I don't recommend coming to eat here if you're a vegetarian unless you're just planning on a doughnut. They have very few vegetarian options, although I will say that the Leadbelly (blue cheese dip with sea salt potato chips) is fabulous. Good place for drinks and doughnuts (seriously, go get one and you won't regret it).\\nBut I hope you like really loud Irish music or this really, really isn't the place for you."},{"name":"El Chilito","address":"2225 Manor Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"After several years of eating at El Chilito frequently, maybe 3 times a week, I can say unequivocally that I've never had never had anything but really good fresh tasty food there. I've occasionally had an order mixed up, or take too long, but that happens anywhere.  Waiting for my order I've watched all the various stages of the food prep happen in the open kitchen many times, so I know how they make it, and I like what I see. Watching them roast an entire grill full of the fresh tomatoes for a sauce, for instance, day after day after day, instead of just opening a big can like so many others do back in a closed kitchen where you can't see, speaks volumes about the care and authenticity of what they cook. And what they unabashedly cook at El Chilito , since so many people are aparently confused by this point, is authentic interior Mexican food, not the gaudy, excessively spicy, overamped border Mexican style that unsophisticated diners latch onto as being \\"real\\" Mexican. In fact, the cochinita pibil I raved about in my original review is still the best I've tasted in Austin, with a depth of flavor unusual in any setting. But then again, not many places even attempt it, because it is a lot of work and takes a lot of time to make right with the aciote seeds and the bitter orange and the long slow cooking. Ditto the tomatillo pork, the barbacoa... and everything else on the menu, for that matter. Reading the spate of recent naysayers, posting one and two star reviews, I'll just say I'm highly suspicious of them. Sounds to me like at least some of the haters are just trying to mess with El Chilito's success, or have some agenda running other than fairly reviewing the food. After all, any time of day you go by El Chilito, as i do several times a day, there is always a line. And that line isn't for the decor (there isn't any), or for cheapo prices (they are reasonablly priced by adult standards, but nobody would call them cheap) or even for the so-called \\"hipster scene\\" (which is as inane a comment as it is inaccurate.) The lines are for the food, sillies, because it is real food and and it is tasty food and and it is well prepared food and it is clean food and it is served up in such a casual setting that anyone can go to El Chilito, any time of day, and get something good to eat without feeling awkward. As for the neighborhood competition, I suggest you folks put more time and energy into improving what you offer to the public, and less into trying to game the Yelp ratings system."},{"name":"Veracruz All Natural","address":"2505 Webberville Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Our AirBnb couple took us out here for breakfast on our last day.

So I returned it and they said they would \\"rush\\" the order for me.  About 30 minutes later my burger arrived.  My husband had long finished his and I had already had two beers on no food and and was feeling pretty good, so I wasn't too upset, but 30 mins?!?! On the plus side, they comped me for it and what's the only thing better than food?  FREE food!  When I finally started eating it in the car on the way to pick my mom up from the airport (oh did I forget to mention that we would have left a long time ago had we not been waiting for our order?) the burger was actually pretty damn good.  Of course by then, I was super hungry and a little drunk, so I may not be the best judge.  It was juicy (for a turkey burger,) and had some delicious corn relish and salsa mayo on there.  Our waitress of course was super apologetic and nice, so overall, the experience definitely could have been worse.

The caveat is, of course, that it is still a buffet, so it won't be as fresh and tasty as what you would find in a sit-down restaurant.  There are a ton of average/mediocre buffets in Austin, none of which make me really WANT to go there. Buffet Palace is one I'll make an exception for. There are two things which stand out here:\\n1) Makizushi\\n2) Some Korean foodsLet me start with the Korean food. There is Bulgoki, pork Bulgoki, Kimchi, and a two very good soups. My all time favorite is Dak Yukgaejang. I like it so much I've tried making it at home. Think of it as a spicy chicken vegetable soup. It has diakon, chicken, beans sprouts, onions, and a nice spicy broth. The Kimchi is OK, and the Bulgoki is not bad at all.The Makizushi is good. For a buffet, they make some really tasty rolls. They have your traditional rolls, but they have really gone above and beyond in coming up with their own variations which are very tasty and I give them  a lot of kudos for that.Their entrees are also nice and flavorful, and they have some things that you don't find in a lot of other buffets. On top of that, due to the relatively high volume of traffic, the food is brought out fairly frequently before it has a chance to go stale. That makes you almost forget you're eating at a buffet.If you're looking for a buffet, but you're tired of the average buffet with stale food and so-so selection, go to Buffet Palace."},{"name":"Fin's Sushi & Grill","address":"62 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"A nice, small space gives fins an open feel.

There are parking spots all around the restaurant and even Atlanta drivers are capable of parking.  It feels like it's trying to be upscale by having valets, but it reminds me of countries with low labor costs just filling up space with cheap jobs.  The valet was very good though and ran to my car to get it.  They require you to pay $2 for the valet, which considering the cost of the restaurant seems very random.  Just make it free if you want to be upscale.The food was delicious.  The scallops practically melted in your mouth and were very soft.  The octopus wasn't tough.  The tomatoes in the salad were a vibrant red.  The olive oil for dipping bread in was fruity, but should have have some oregano in it. The bread was also good.  If this place had takeout, I'd probably do that.So why only 3 stars with such great food?  They screwed up a couple times and haven't figured out basic things like get pepper and salt mills.  If you want to be a Greek restaurant, get some Greek sea salt and put it in a mill.I ordered zucchini fritters, which never arrived at the table but did arrive on the check.  A server told us that the chef was unhappy with the way the scallops were cooked and was going to remake them, and wanted us to have a salad.  It was a salad we ordered, so we felt that might mean the salad was comped, but it wasn't.

I actually ordered the burger WITHOUT steak sauce, as I was mainly interested in the first five ingredients listed. The flavors were still overpowering, and I had to remove most of the onions that had been piled on. I also ordered a Lonestar, which could have been a lot colder. I left my dining experience wondering how much can possibly be piled on a burger, and when is enough enough? I'm in an unofficial burger club made up of some of my friends, and we eat at a new establishment once a month to judge their burgers, so I've eaten A LOT of burgers in my life. I see what Hopdoddy is trying to do, and I admire the effort. I also know I am not in the majority with my 3-star rating.

The drive there was nice and I went on a weekday and found a great parking spot close by.There were no open tables (a good sign) and I have no qualms about eating at a bar so I sat at the bar and started making friends.

The spicy mustard was great with all of the sausages and it was a very good meal overall.

The problem i had was that while the icing and topping of the cupcakes were good, the cupcakes themselves were pretty dense and dry. I prefer fluffier cupcakes, and these weren't fitting the bill at all. I ordered four different kinds with the same results. I didn't even get through all of them since I was so disappointed.

We only got 2, the Creme Brulee and Apple Fritter. The Creme Brulee was super unique and very very good. The Apple Fritter was pretty average. Not worth the $3. I would go back again and get more variety so i can try the different flavors but i think this place is more of a trend or an Instagram picture to check off the list."},{"name":"Barley Swine","address":"6555 Burnet Rd, Ste 400","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I finally made it out to this rustic, quaint, delicious restaurant I keep hearing wonderful things about!

However, thank god I am a carnivore because the beef dish was amazing. There are some fried... things that are also tasty. I do wish they would label their dishes so I wouldn't have to refer to what I am eating as a thing.The restaurant is a little small, making the buffet setup extremely awkward. I think I excused myself about twenty times during the five minutes I was at the buffet. This was not due to curry induced gas but rather because the buffet is set up in such a fashion that you are constantly  in someones way. I'm awkward though, so maybe it is me.I didn't get a knife.

Pulled pork, coleslaw, cornbread, ribs, and much more.  It sounded much better than our original plan so we headed in to see what Portland has to offer in the way of authentic bbq.We were greeted by the friendly staff and ushered to our pub style table.  Dimly light with a cabin style decor we immediately noticed the bar was well stocked with row after row of scotch and whiskey.  We perused the whiskey menu in search of something that sounded vaguely familiar (as neither of us know a thing about whiskey). Precursor- A week or two earlier we decided to have a shot of something new and fabulous after a late brunch at Urban Farmer before we headed out to stroll the cold streets of downtown PDX in search of a fabulous and undiscovered boutique.  Our waitress suggested a a special 10-year whiskey made especially by Russell's Reserve for Urban Farmer.  Ummm....ok, sure.  Why not?  Long story short...We sipped our fine glass of rye whiskey and found it to be flavorful and complicated, interesting and surprisingly palatable.  We left our table feeling joyous and light on our feet!  We knew we would have to explore this throw back spirit once again. Fast forward - Saturday evening, Southland Whiskey kitchen, BBQ, and our first flight of rye whiskey.  John (our bartender) is our super social genuinely all-round great guy.  Knowledgeable and friendly .....  the embodiment of everything a great bartender should be .... as we sipped our tastes of whiskey John educated us on the distillery processes, history, and best bangs for your buck!I honestly am giving up my dirty martini (as least a for time) to explore whiskey thing.  I truly enjoy it and honestly find it down to earth, complicated yet basic and a little intriguing.  And let's be honest ..... it's damn cool to walk pass the bar and see a woman sipping a neat shot of whiskey! lol!\\nWe've returned on several occasions to chat John up and pick his brain a bit.  My mom was just up for a visit and I treated her to a Crown Royal XR (neat) while I enjoyed a nice glass of Middleton Very Rare (neat).

I had been to the Tavern many times to enjoy cocktails and the amazing view.  On occasion, I had an appetizer, but never had a full meal at the Tavern.  I loved the Tavern!  Friends had asked us to dinner this past week to try the restaurant which replaced the Tavern - Pier 6.  I was just so happy to hear that a restaurant opened in this great piece of property.  I was excited to see the renovations (which I have to say, look great - new floors, bar stools, and decor)  It was a Wednesday evening and we were quickly sat down in the upper deck for dinner.  Unfortunately, that was the only thing that happened quickly.  After the 4 of us sat there waiting for a server, we had to ask someone if we could place an order for drinks.  It was 30 min from when we sat down to when our drinks were brought to the table.  Really?  They were not that busy!  Now for the food....we placed an order for dinner and waited close to 1 hour for our food.  At this point we all were very hungry.  The farm salad my friend ordered was never delivered to the table - she had to remind the waitress that she never got her salad!  The grilled oysters (only 4 of them) were extremely small in size and disappointing.  We also ordered 2 small plates of the broccoli rabe.  It looked delicious until we tasted it - it tasted completely BURNT.  I think maybe the steamer they used to cook the rabe was burnt , because by appearance, the broccoli looked fine - YUCK!   The other items we ordered - swordfish and crab cakes were OK.  Once we made the waitress aware that we didn't receive the salad, and the broccoli was burnt, she did take it off the bill.  But, it was very poor service and a major lack of polish (she left the inedible food on the table). Never did a manager come over to the table, or anyone to apologize for the lack of attention and disappointment with the food.  The kicker is the prices have gone way way up - for both food and drinks.  After only paying for swordfish, 2 orders of small plate crab cakes, and 1 order small plate order of oysters, and a couple of glasses of wine- the bill, including tip was $210!  I had high hopes for a restaurant at this location.  We love being on the water and having dinner and drinks.

You can understand my disappointment when I arrived at the Salem bonchon to see menu. There was not much variety, but things like a goddamn chicken ceasar wrap and other similar basic stuff etc on the menu. My heart was crushed. I even went several times thinking that maybe it was an off day, maybe I'd like something if I kept trying other things. Unfortunately everything sucked- Like the person cooking didn't know how to cook or something or maybe the food has been out for too long?

The food tasted stale and the saag paneer naan was cold, stale, and there was no paneer! It tasted like frozen spinach stuffed in old white bread. I was pissed I spent so much on such mediocre food. \\nFor dessert we tried some gulab jamun and kheer- the kheer was tasteless, and devastatingly so, because it's really not too hard to make kheer taste good.

The sauce that came with it was mayo base hot sauce with a lot of kick to it. Reminds me of sriracha mayo but better. I had the ahi poki. They were very generous with the poki. It even has a side is rice and a cucumber salad, which I did not expect. The cutest carrot cut out of a crab was place on top of the poki with gave the dish it's awesome presentation. Poki was a little bit more on the pricy side for a food truck item but most definitely worth it! I never had poki before so I can't tell you how authentic it is. It was just really delicious. The poki was marinated in soy sauce, fish eggs, onion...just to name a few ingredients. My other friend has the big kahuna burger. I was too full to try hers but she said it was really good and moist. It had a beef patty and shredded BBQ pork on top from what I can see.

I literally took the topping to-go in a small container, because I could eat it with anything. In fact, I even dipped my bread from the charcuterie board in the topping/sauce for the waffles because it was just that delicious! At first glance, the topping may sound very sweet, but the hint of rosewater gives this topping a beautifully light and fragrant taste, which ensures that the white chocolate is not overwhelmingly sweet.

Even harder for me to hate on a spot that turns out damned good wings, but there's one thing that's keeping me from giving this Hooters at least 4 stars-the service. \\nTo be clear as well as fair,  I have never received egregiously poor or hostile service,  but I always notice that the service has never been as warm or attentive as I have observed male patrons receiving. I'm thinking \\"Sheesh, you should be glad I'm not here to ogle or flirt with you, I'm just tryna get some wangs, Shawty\\"; but of course I don't say it. I've had this happen while I dine alone, and with male companionship; it seems even more odd and stark when I'm here with a man.I dunno, I think I'm gonna just start getting take-out from this location from now on."},{"name":"Chez Vincent","address":"533 W New England Ave","city":"Winter Park","stars":"3","text":"Never coming back. I had reservations here for Mother's Day at 8:30 pm. We got there around 8:45, usually restaurants have 15 minute window. However\\nfrom the moment we walked in a young man approaches us with his hands up acting as if we can't be there. My mom then told him that we have an 8:30 reservation, he then asked us what time it was and we told him 8:45. He then pointed to a random table in the back corner and said to \\"go sit there and by the way we close in 15 minutes\\" . My mom the. Got upset and stated why would you accept a reservation for 8:30 if you close I. 15 minutes? He then shrugged at us and walked away. We looked at the time on the door and it stated the restaurant closed at 10 and another employee also confirmed that they closed at 10. I do believe the young man was discriminating against us and it's unfortunate to see such blatant ignorance\\nracism in 2017. Completely ruined the night."},{"name":"Barcelona Wine Bar South End","address":"525 Tremont St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Great service and great food. Really liked the steak tartare, the chicken liver mousse, the broccolini, and the bone marrow! They also have a nice wine and cocktail selection. They have decently priced sangria pitchers and wine flight. I would definitely go back. It was a great meal with a lot of variety for a decent price, especially if you come with more people. The waitresses are super attentive and they're really helpful for suggestions."},{"name":"Ghion Ethiopian restaurant","address":"2080 Cheshire Bridge Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"So on the spur of the moment and with a deep craving for Ethiopian food, my honey and I hopped in the car and drive 2+ hours to this restaurant. When we pulled up there were 3 guys talking outside, but 0 patrons and we were worried they were closed, but the owner car to our car window and waved us in with a welcoming smile. After a trip down a long, somewhat suspect hallway and through a door in the left, we were greeted by a very large, very empty room full of neat woven basket and regular tables. Needless to say we were slightly concerned, but it was unwarranted because when the food came out it was like heaven. Service was attentive, but not overbearing. And we ended the meal with traditional coffee accompanied by incense that filled the room. A wonderful night. We plan on visiting again! Meal for 2 was about $40 plus tip. Definitely worth our drive."},{"name":"Baby Acapulco","address":"13609 N I H 35","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"My husband and I just left baby a's on 35& howard Lane. We went and sat down, but no one even acknowledged we were sitting there. I got up and asked for chips and salsa as the 2 kids stood there playing and joking around and not getting the chips to tables. I stood there for a few seconds before they even knew I was standing there. We NEVER even saw a server so we got up and left. We use to go three times a week but service wasn't as good as it first was, so we started going once a week and then once every other month or so. Yes we do enjoy their food but the problem I have is the service. What is happening to Baby A's? I called the restaurant to speak with the manager and although I was a bit frustrated, the Manager James listened to my concerns in a very professional and patient way and I thank him for that, but still..service needs to improve or their business is going to dwindle."},{"name":"Shane's Rib Shack","address":"1522 Gemini Pl","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"Ive always like SHANE'S RIBSHACK !

Went here for dinner with my boyfriend based on numerous recommendations, and I was not let down. We made reservations (a little earlier - 6pm), and got seated right away. We decided to go the safe route and skipped out on the special to get the Steak Frites (his) and Canard Confit (mine). I was skeptical about his Steak Frites at first because while the name sounds fancy to our uncultured ears, it is essentially, steak and fries. But oh my goodness was it tasty. I was blown away at how perfect and flavourful that piece of steak was. It came pre-sliced, and with a heaping pile of crispy fries (with garlic mayo... didn't really care for that). My duck came sitting on a bed of fresh greens and goat cheese, with more shredded duck mixed in. It was fall-off-the-bone tender and I loved it even more than the steak.For dessert, we chose to share the fresh berries and lemon curd with shortbread crumbs. The lemon curd was amazing and melted in your mouth. My only complaint was that it was on the small side for the price ($7). Our server was so very friendly and did not seem overly snooty at all. He made sure we had lots of water refills and our baguettes never ran out.Way to go, Le Faux!"},{"name":"Render Coffee","address":"563 Columbus Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"I live a few doors down and LOVE this place.  Their coffee is great, staff is friendly, they use the latest technologies at the register, and the place itself is really nice.  I only have two issues:1) Hours - they close pretty early; places like The Thinking Cup stay open until at least 10PM.  I'm studying for the GMAT and always looking for a great spot after work but unfortunately Render is always closed by the time I start.2) Price - call me crazy but they seem a bit pricey for their location.  It's on the edge of Roxbury and a bit out of the way unless you're passing through the Mass Ave T stop or Columbus Ave - why do they charge as if they're on Newbury?Otherwise, keep up the good work, Render!"},{"name":"Hopdoddy Burger Bar","address":"1400 S Congress Ave, Ste A190","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Their bread really makes the burger at this place. I have tasted their meat, seafood, and vegetarian sandwiches - all delicious. The menu is not too daunting, and I appreciate that. I think they tend to stack the burgers a little too high, and IMHO it takes a little fun out of the burger eating experience. Also, their fries and cocktails could be better.The progression of service is a little confusing for a newcomer, but I've never waited long at all to eat. As long as they all know what they're doing, and I get my food at a decent time and temperature, I'm all good!"},{"name":"Orinoco","address":"22 Harvard St","city":"Brookline","stars":"4","text":"Ate there last night with my whole family and it was delicious!We got dates wrapped in bacon for an appetizer which were great and then for dinner I got the palua arepa which was really yummy with shredded beef.

A little bit of a wait, because its a pretty small hole in the wall. Tables a Lil close together, but no biggy. our waitress was lovely, although took a while to get the check. I had the Caboulette for breakfast, and what a nice surprise. Never had a true French breakfast, so didn't know what to expect. It was two sunny side eggs on top of beans. With two pieces of sausage, roasted tomatoes, and a thick piece of bacon. It all went together harmoniously. A very filling rich breakfast. My friend had the La serna, which I tasted. A lot more refreshing and light compared to mine. Rice, fried egg, chorizo, avocado, and I believe Arugula. Very different flavor, but delicious nonetheless.
