She had told me that there was a new restaurant that opened around the corner from her and I am all for sushi and dumplings! We decided to give this place a try.\\n\\nFirst, the specialty drinks menu was odd. There is a drink called the Black Dragon Margarita with tequila, lime, pomegranate, coffee, and soy sauce. I had to try it because I had to know how it tasted. I received it in a little goblet where my friend received hers in a large glass with ice. When I asked the server if it was a hot beverage (I didn't know what to expect with the coffee as an ingredient) she told me that it was shaken with ice so it was cold. One sip and I was confused! It tasted mostly like lime juice but then I would talk to my friend and I could taste the tequila. So bizarre. I sipped it through dinner and came to realize that all of the tequila was on the bottom. I should have mixed it. My mistake.\\n\\nFor food, my friend ordered the steamed bao with a side of salmon sushi. I ordered the vegetarian dumplings with a side of idaho maki. I was surprised that there were only a couple dumpling options considering the restaurant has dumplings in the name. The sushi came out first which is typical. However, almost immediately after the sushi came out, my dumplings also came out. My friend's bao did not arrive until 10 minutes later. This creates some awkwardness between dinner guests and should be standard at all restaurants. We sat awkwardly waiting for my friend's food while mine was sitting on the table getting cold. The poor server kept coming over to reassure us that it would be out shortly. \\n\\nOverall, the food was okay but nothing spectacular. The server we had was nice but making sure the food comes out at the same time is a must (this is probably a kitchen concern more than the server).

We grew up in small texas towns, and we have lived in Austin for a decent while. This is the first bbq place that we have EVER been to where we both did not finish our plates. We also kicked ourselves in the ass after we left for not asking for our money back. We were so hungry, this place was close, and we didn't think bbq could go too wrong. Boy... were we wrong. We came in hungry and left queazy. \\n\\nMy food was so salty, so dry, and ultimately flavorless (except for the salt taste). The sides had the same value as the meat. Over salted and still... flavorless. The food tasted very cheap, but had the price of a respectable bbq joint. My friend that was with me ordered the ribs, and he had the same complaint. Too dry, hard, and much too salty. The bbq sauce was very thin. It tasted like watered down ketchup, pepper, smoke flavoring, and lots and lots and lots of salt. \\n\\nLet tourists and the people from L.A. have this place. Texans and true bbq seekers should check out the various bbq trailers on the east side, or go to Lockhart Texas (20 miles away) or Fredericksburg, Texas. For downtown area bbq, green mesquite is \\"okay\\" for a quick bbq fix, or try lamberts or stubbs for a more tourist-like environment but with decent bbq. \\n\\nSorry to leave such a poor review.

The food was fine, but the service and atmosphere were subpar. We came in and the lighting was a little bright, giving it a cafeteria feel. Now I am a huge critique of lighting in a restaurant, so no big deal. Then they forgot our appetizer. I've worked in restaurants before. Things happen. No big deal. All the while there are fruit flies all around us. We assumed this was the entire restaurant, so we just dealt with it. Then there was a bone in my boyfriend's chicken sandwich. The server was not apologetic at all. He had a bit of an attitude. He just asked if we wanted to send it back. When we asked about the fruit flies, he said we were the only table to experience them and said he could have moved us. Again, not congenial at all. At this point, I had just gotten a fruit fly in my mouth because it died in my wine. He then sent the manager over, and she apologized and said they were working out the kinks. The food wasn't really good enough to return, at least not anytime soon. I had the vegetarian barbecue sandwich and calamari. The calamari had a weird sauce. So food was good, but not good enough to deal with bad service and a bad atmosphere.

They were good - interesting flavor profile but not my favorite. \\n\\nDinner was the filet (8 oz.

After recently moving here and visiting south east Asia, I've been so happy to see the options of Asian street food in the Orlando area. Granted, it's not exactly the same, but man it gets pretty close. \\n\\nA lot of the reviews talk about how the food is overpriced or small but the whole point of tapas is to try everything, and yes, even though a good bowl of noodles abroad may cost you $1.50, the cost of good quality food is not the same here so you can't expect to pay low prices. \\n\\nWe ordered the chili crab, the roti, the po po lo curry, the papaya salad, the king prawn noodle soup, and the mango sticky rice. The chili crab was my absolute favorite thing we ordered. It came with a bao that was fried which I really haven't seen before and it paired so deliciously with the soft shell crab and the stew/sauce. It had the perfect tang and perfect spicy kick. The roti and curry were good, but this had a little more kaffir and lemongrass which resembled more of a Thai curry when I was hoping and expecting more of a Malaysian styled curry. Nevertheless, it was flavorful and pretty good. The po po lo curry was good, but a tad too salty. The papaya salad was good. I enjoyed the mango that it came with. The king prawn noodle soup was absolutely delicious and the mango sticky rice was good too.\\n\\nAs for the service, I didn't come in expecting much because that's how south East Asian style dining is. They're definitely slow at cleaning up plates and you don't get many napkins, but hey, the messier the tastier!\\n\\nThis spot is an amazing find.

It was January but the weather was good: not too cold just a bit windy. Tip Number 1: Come with good company. The wait was nearly an hour to seat four people. We all knew this coming in and were okay with that. So be prepared. But Rainey Street is super cool and photogenic so we walked around looking in at all the bars and restraints. There is a lot! We walked down to a museum and to the river which wasn't even a 3 minute walk from the front door and enjoyed the day. \\n\\nWhen we got back, we only waited about ten more minutes before we were seated. Tip 2: come on a day with good weather. I didn't have a chance to walk around for long inside, but the majority of the seating was outside. Having been to Munich, the entire atmosphere is very similar to a classic beer garden which can be nice or not so nice depending on what you are looking for. Pros: it has a lively, fun crowd, all laughing and drinking. Cons (sorta): you will be seated at benches at long tables so you will be rubbing shoulders with strangers (metaphorically, because we actually were very comfortable and had plenty of personal space). \\n\\nThey had live music while we were there which was very nice! It was a brass band that played early 2000's and 1990's music. Tip 3: don't expect privacy or a intimate conversation. It is very loud between the music and the crowd so go for a fun laugh not a first date, I guess. My party had to talk very loudly to have a conversation and often had things lost in the sound. Still a great time though.\\n\\nThe Food!!! Do yourself a favor, and get the weirdest thing on the menu. Each of us had a different dish, and they did everyone incredibly. It was a lot of food and simply great. It took a lot of time to get a waiter but that is part of the beer garden vibe: you're their for the experience, not the service. Our waiter who eventually helped us was friendly and nice! Food takes a long time to come out but the drinks do not. Two in my party got the Man-mosas which I think is what they are most known for and they both enjoyed them a lot! \\n\\nWould go again, only reason it has 4 stars and not 5 in my book is because of the sound levels.

They had coffee outside for waiting patrons which is a nice gesture. The space is definitely small where you are literally sitting next to the next table. Not recommended if you care for a lot of personal space. One downside of being so close to your neighbors was how loud it got. My friend and I were seated across from one another and sometimes I found it hard to hear her above the noise. There were only about 4 more tables outside on the sidewalk. It didn't look exactly comfortable to sit outside since you were on the sidewalk in run-down parking lot with other patrons waiting in line behind you trying to get a table. \\n\\nStarted with complimentary blueberry muffins and cinnamon buns. The muffins were delicious. The cinnamon buns were a little on the hard side. We both ended up ordering the eggs benedict with smoked salmon and fresh fruit. It was delicious. The eggs were cooked to perfect yolk-y goodness and the smoked salmon was so good. My usually gluttonous appetite couldn't even finish my meal. Portions were definitely satisfying. I also tried the peach tea which was good, but a tad too sweet for my personal taste. I had to ask for it to be mixed with half unsweet. \\n\\nService was prompt and friendly.

The dish is seven succulent scallops (seared) served with asparagus in a fresh sorrel sauce (DEE-licious), over mashed potatoes (I prefer fries, but that's neither here nor there).\\n\\nThe other thing I have to report to you is that Niko does haricots vert about the best of anywhere I've ever had them.

So we figured that Tilted Kilt would be a great idea.  And we were pretty much wrong a majority of the times.\\n\\nNow, I am not one of those reviewers that has only been here once and my experience was kind of terrible so I decided to vent about it on Yelp.  We have been several times and the only time that had great service was when we knew the waitress.  Let's go over some specific instances; please note, the latest we've ever walked in at was still before Midnight so we were not an inconvenience.\\n\\n1) Walked in and stood waiting for a seat for at least 7 mins before I grabbed the menus for myself and sat down.  \\n2) Did something similar to #1 except this time 3 waitresses/hostesses were playing cards at a table, still in uniform.  None of them said a word, even when they looked up.\\n3) A friend of mine had an old license with a scratched up strip that wouldn't scan.  The waitress said that she couldn't accept it and said because she didn't want to end up like her friends in their recent serving to the underage bust/fine.  Never got a manager even though we asked for one.\\n4) On multiple occasions, we would order a beer and it would either be a. she would never come to see if we needed another drink or b. would bring us a refill without even asking.\\n\\nGenerally, the food is okay.  I've never had too much to be wowed by.  The clam strips are pretty good (honestly, the sauce is amazing and I think that makes it the best)  The garlic fries are def my favorite thing on the menu.  Sometimes that would be my only dinner item.  The pulled pork sandwich was pretty good too.  Pint of Guinness is priced a little high, but standard in relation to the price of food.\\n\\nTo the ladies of the Kilt.  I understand that the short kilt is required for dress code.  However you can find a shirt to cover yourself up top.  Your belly button ring hanging lower than your belt loops is not encouraging me to come back to enjoy the sights.

I used to live in Richardson, a suburb of Dallas, and the Saucer's Addison location became \\"our bar\\" for my circle of friends. Transferring my loyalty to this location was fairly easy, even if this location isn't so convenient for where I live and work anymore, because the Saucer has a lot of strengths to it no matter where it is:\\n- Unmatched beer variety. A base selection of well over a hundred beers in all styles, with constantly rotating brewery offerings, including local microbreweries and weekly rare keg tappings on Thursdays. There simply isn't a better place to go if you like to drink new beers in as many styles as you can find.\\n- Pretty good bar food. Over the years I've had essentially the entire menu, and while none of it would win Best XYZ Ever, their burger beats Crown & Anchor, their sandwiches compete favorably with your local sub joint, and their bratwurst is actually pretty damn good.\\n- Good ambiance. They always have a decent assortment of sports on their TVs though they aren't a sports bar, their patio is spacious and appropriately-lit, and their indoor seating is comfy and has a good mix of tables, booths, and couches. The infamous Saucer Skirts on the waitresses obviously don't hurt either.\\n- Decent specials. On Sundays, most pints from Texas breweries are $3. On Mondays, most drafts are $3. Every other night they have a fire sale beer that's $3, sometimes more than one per night, and on Wednesdays they will have a beer that for an additional few bucks will come with a pint glass with the logo of that brewery. Plus a yearly special pint glass on 4/20, which is funny even if you don't smoke.\\n- A neat loyalty program. If you fork over $18 you can be in their \\"UFO club\\", where for each 200 distinct types of beer you drink, you receive a free pint, a free big beer, a free piece of merch, and a party for you and your friends with $100 worth of free beer to drink. In addition, you get a plate that hangs on the wall with your name, the date of your 200th beer, and a quote of your choice, to immortalize your alcoholism. Drinking 200 different beers, especially when only 3 per day will count towards the program, translates into some hefty tabs, but you would unquestionably pay more to drink 200 different types of beer at any other conceivable bar, and you get to expand your beer palate as well. Come on, anyone can drink 200 different Lone Stars at Poodle Dog, that's a meaningless achievement. (Disclaimer: as of this writing I'm about to get my 3rd plate, which means I've spent more $ than I want to think about here over the years).\\n\\nI take off a star because the service can be pretty inconsistent. Most of the servers are really good, but you'll get the odd one that doesn't care about your table and somehow manages to defy all mathematical laws and split your 3 beers between 4 different people. Also, if you're in the UFO club, you have to watch your beers in their system like a hawk to make sure they count them all; I actually recommend the excellent drinking app Untappd just so you can record your beers to email them if they mess up. It's rare, and they've always fixed it instantly, but when you're spending the kind of money it takes to get a plate, glitches are frustrating, and those missed beers add up.\\n\\nAll in all it's a great bar though, and even though it doesn't get 5 stars I still like going to it more than almost any other. As a general bar it has its peers and betters, but for a beer aficionado it has no rivals. The Triangle is also a great central location if your friends live all over town like mine do."},{"name":"Ball Square Cafe","address":"708 Broadway","city":"Somerville","stars":"4.5","text":"Amazing.

I recently visited for the first time, and I'm already looking forward to their reopening. Look for them on August 16 at 151 Sycamore Street.\\n\\nThe ever-changing menu here is perhaps a little bourgie, but it's almost all some serious quality, too. There hasn't been a single dish here that's stood out to me as mediocre, and everything's incredibly fresh. Bartenders are competent (there's a few suggested cocktails on the menu, but they can whip you up whatever you want; drinks are actually quite reasonably priced), servers are friendly, and the ambiance is intimate and comfortable. The space is admittedly a bit cramped in a few places, but the move ought to remedy that problem.\\n\\nAs far as individual dishes go, here's what I've had a taste of:\\n\\nAppetizers:\\n- Arancini with citrus & fennel pollen ($6): Breaded and fried rice balls stuffed with cheese. They're quite addictive. The citrus and fennel are really a nice touch, as you can taste just a hint of both.\\n- Prosciutto & lomo, bread & butter pickles ($8): Quality cuts, though nothing unique, especially with places like the Iberian Pig just down the street.\\n- Fig, peach, mozzarella, purslane, almonds, aged balsamic vinegar ($9): Fresh, flavorful, and delicious.\\n- Tomato, eggplant agro dolce, cucumber, arugula ($9): Ditto.\\n- Misty Point oysters, pickled daikon ($15): Six to an order. The pickled daikon is a unique flavor I hadn't paired with oysters before, and fortunately, it didn't overpower.\\n\\nEntrees:\\n- Soft shell crab, slow roasted bacon, charred okra, tomato, romesco ($15): Generously sized, incredibly meaty, and caught at just the right time. I really enjoyed the smoky flavor of the okra, as well.\\n- Whole roasted trout for 2, salsa di salmoriglio, pea shoots ($31): One of the highlights of the menu; I could've eaten this whole thing myself. Juicy flesh and crispy skin, both very flavorful. You can ask to have this filleted.\\n- Smoked duck, lettuces, ground cherries, edamame, squash, peach ($24): Decent, though I've never found duck to be a particularly delicious meat.\\n- Lamb loin & shoulder, summer vegetables, green grits ($34): Delicious cuts of meat, but I particularly loved the flavor of the vegetable medley with the grits.\\n\\nDesserts:\\n- Mascarpone mousse, macerated cherries, spicy almonds, chocolate covered cherry, pizelle basket ($9): A very light mousse, and I appreciated all of the cherries (here, macerated means they've been de-pitted and split in half). The chocolate-covered cherry, however, is frozen solid with the pit still in the middle. I wasn't a huge fan of this part of the dish.\\n\\nOverall, a great meal."},{"name":"Alegria's Seafood","address":"2584 Bethel Rd","city":"Columbus","stars":"4.5","text":"I would love to know how this place managed such a high score. I have been wanting to take my family here for a while and since we couldn't decide on fish or tacos for family night, I convinced my family to give this place a shot.\\n\\nFirst, there was more food on the floors than on the tables. I should have taken that as a sign, but gave them a pass because it was a busy Friday night with a large table with several children. \\n\\nNext, it took about 15 minutes to get our drinks  (strawberry margarita and pina colada). The margarita was a watery daiquiri and the pina colada was reminiscent of pineapple sherbet with strawberry syrup garnish. \\n\\nAs a chef, I know you can put your own spin on classics, but if it is a classic that people are used to and that is standard across the globe, you have an obligation to phrase it as such on the menu.\\n\\nOne of the meals we ordered was the fish and chips. The fish was almost burned, yet still absorbed much of the oil on the outside, and the inside had some sort of green paste (yet to be determined - the manager said it was parsely but I knew better)which made the batter soggy on the inside since it was not cooked properly. The \\"chips\\" were Rally's french fries.\\n\\nLet's not even talk about the hard piece of bright red plastic that I bit into as we were eating the empanadas - which the owner advised it was just part of the packaging from the shrimp filling.

As mentioned, their concept is to bring out food for you, without prompting, so that you can experience all they have to offer BUT they did let us know, if we didn't want or didn't like something, we can ask for them to take it back.  The food normally comes out as individual dishes for the table (traditional dim sum) BUT they also had platters of food served to you individually (like a reception/hors d'oeuvres style).\\n\\nWhen we initially sat down, we received a bunch of dishes--great!--but soon after, the dishes came to a halt and our tea had also run out.  We mentioned this to a server, who said that dishes are coming BUT we waited and waited--with little to nothing coming out of the kitchen.  Service at this point was unattentive and very disappointing given the price point and how they are marketing themselves.  It took multiple requests to even get more water for the tea.\\n\\nAfter alot of waiting, we finally ordered some dishes but it was quite confusing because we didn't know if some of the dishes we ordered were eventually going to come OR if the dishes we received were the ones we ordered or their randomly served ones.  Ordering was also quite hit or miss, some waiters were definitely better than others.  The odd thing is, the restaurant wasn't full at all and they seem to have a lot of staff BUT they all seem to be running around aimlessly.  Quite a disappointing experience!\\n\\nIf you want to have a \\"better\\" experience, just order your food--don't rely on their concept of service!  It really isn't \\"service\\" as there is no rhyme or reason to what dishes are served.\\n\\nFrom an actual food perspective, they were all 'okay'--we didn't feel any were good or memorable.  And none of the dishes were terrible or unedible BUT that's a very low standard to have for an upscale restaurant.\\n\\nGiven the overall experience, it wouldn't be a place I'd recommend--not even for the novelty of AYCE dim sum.  If you spend $40/person at a decent dim sum place, you'll probably have pretty much an AYCE experience with better service and food, and some leftovers."},{"name":"Buckstop","address":"833 Denman Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"absolutely outstanding. hands down the best bbq i have ever had. can't wait to go back!!"},{"name":"Joe's Crab Shack","address":"11680 Research Blvd, Ste A","city":"Austin","stars":"2.5","text":"So I've eaten at a Joe's back in Michigan so I knew the food was generally good.

I called 3 days prior to Mother's Day to inquire about brunch on the patio, since the venue was sold out for a show.  I was told it was open for brunch, no reservations required and dog friendly.  Upon arrival @ 12:30pm, the hostess (short, glasses, long hair) had a bitter-face engaged upon approach.  She indicated the establishment was Sold Out for Mother's Day brunch and she would \\"see what she can do to get you a table outside, and sir.. please step aside\\"  (mind you, not a single person behind me).  The most tart-attitude a customer should ever be greeted with upon entry.   I approached the manager on duty who apologized and sat our party outside.  Keep in mind, EVERY TABLE outside was empty except for 2 prior customers.  The experience got worse...  food took upwards of 2 hours to reach our table, with salads arriving last.   We actually shared our food with a family at the adjacent table who was celebrating with their elderly mother and had also been waiting for 90+ minutes.  When I asked the server, Jarrod about the food, he was clueless and said he was NOT allowed in the kitchen to inquire about our food due to the busy Mother's Day brunch in the main venue.   Then we started receiving food that wasn't even marked for our table... when asking Jarrod, \\"is this the breakfast burrito?\\" --- yes it is.. but it was in clearly a breakfast QUICHE?

I also got a side of sweet potatoe fries and sweet tea. You know your burger is going to be good when the employee bringing it out says it looks super good. \\n\\nThe burger did not disappoint. Probably the best burger I have ever had at an airport and would hold its own out in the general public. The bun was nice and soft and the burger was nice and juicy with a warm lightly pink center. The toppings all paired well together and made for a tasty burger, no ketchup necessary. If you are hungry, get the double patty version, it will fill you up and is only a couple bucks extra (there were some complaints of size so that is why I went with a double). The sweet potatoe fries were great and came in a nice big portion for only $3-ish dollars.\\n\\nI definately like the mishmash retro feel they are going with with old robots and 1940's era pinups.

I feel like I was in one of those commercials where I walked through the world in black and white, then I went to Cafe Brioso and my life suddenly became colorful again. \\n\\nCafe Brioso was not too packed when I got there at 7:30 this morning, but around 7:45, there was a huge, albeit diverse line of people waiting for this mean muggin' coffee. \\n\\nThe staff here was quite friendly, even striking up a conversation about scones (I got the lemon-blueberry one), and they were VERY knowledgeable about their coffee. I overheard one of the cashiers talking to a gentleman about their different brews and it was really cool to hear how much the staff takes pride in their cafe and what they serve to the customers. Not to mention, it was like the Cheers of coffee shops, I think I heard them call 5 or 6 customers by name, even using the token line \\"just the usual?\\" I want to fit in like that! Dammit. \\n\\nAnyways, I got a large cappucino and sat there reading some magazines. The first sip was just magical, it was full of flavor, just the right temperature, and the design made me smile. Sipping on it slowly was tough because it was just so good. My scone was just the right texture, light, fluffy, and refreshingly sweet. If I worked closer to here I would be going back right now for another capp. Cafe Brioso is fairly cheap too.

I cannot say more about how beautiful this room is. \\n\\nMy friend throwing the shower barely had to bring any decorations as Scott and his group provided everything you could want or need (candles, flowers, decorative succulents, burlap runners, chalk board signs for the food, desert corner platters to place cakes and/or cupcakes, fully stocked bar, clothes line with clothes pins for hanging cute decorations, etc). \\n\\nMy shower began with their delicious bruschetta and a fruit tray along with champagne with a fresh fruit garnish. It was followed by a yummy lunch consisting of their turkey bacon avocado sandwiches, BLT's, and chicken salad sandwiches, strawberry salad, and homemade chips. Everything was delicious! \\n\\nScott allowed us to bring in our own desert for the party.

The beers are usually good and I enjoy the large selection. The service has been nothing to write home about, but I didn't get so aggravated I felt like walking out. Up until last night, that is.\\n\\nI've worked in the restaurant industry before. I realize that from a waitress's perspective, because she might not make as much money on such a cheap pint special night, she may not see a table that only orders 1 or 2 beers worth the effort. But really that's no excuse. I'm not coming to Special Night to get a beer and shitty service. I expect the service to be just as good as any other night, regardless of how much my beer costs and how many beers I buy. \\n\\nI have never in my life not tipped until last night. I've been tempted to write my waitress's name on here, but I decided against it. All I can say is that she was extremely not attentive and not too bright. First of all, it took a while for her to even serve us. We were brought a beer around 9:30. I was finished at about 9:55. The waitress didn't stop by ONCE. I saw her and other waitresses through the glass door (we were sitting on the patio) talking to each other. After 10, I eventually flagged down another waitress and asked for my check. She assured me she'd bring it. Guess what? She didn't.\\n\\nShortly after my first waitress walked on by and asked if I wanted another drink. I said no and asked for the check, which she brought. When she was walking up to the table with the check, I had my bright red Bank of America debit card in my hand, ready to give her. She just placed the check on the table and walked off. More than 15 minutes later, she hadn't returned. I had to go inside to pay. Needless to say, she didn't get a tip. \\n\\nI don't think I'll be back to this establishment. I love good beer, and it provides it, but bad service overrules that for me.

As a party of 14, we were seated pretty quickly.  That's about where the good vibes stopped for me.\\n\\nYou see, I get pretty bad migraines and my #1 trigger is loud noises.  As I usually do in loud situations, I put in my eargasms which allow me to bring down the volume considerably but still allows me to hear and interact with people just fine.\\n\\nWhen it came time to order, I *TRIED* to get pad thai with tofu.  Apparently annoyed at me for some unknown reason, he starts arguing with me that he doesn't have pad thai with tofu.  He kept telling me it wasn't on the menu.  \\"Where did you see it on the menu?  Are you sure you can read the menu right?\\", was what he asked me. \\n\\nI pointed to pad thai in the menu and he kept telling me that it comes with shrimp chicken and tofu.  Well, in my view, if there are 3 ingredients and I only want one of them, why wouldn't it be possible?  I, again, stated that \\"I want the pad thai with just tofu\\" and he replied \\"You want vegetarian pad thai?  Are you sure?\\"\\n\\nSo.. I said \\"Yes.  Vegetarian pad thai with only tofu.  No shrimp or chicken.\\"\\n\\nHe continued to acost me verbally saying that it's not on the menu and that I clearly didn't read the menu correctly.  I got so upset that I just said, \\"Why can't you just make me the pad thai and leave out the shrimp and chicken?  Isn't that vegetarian pad thai?\\"  \\n\\nAt this point, he lost it and started yelling in my ear saying \\"Can you hear me?  Can you hear me?  WE DON'T HAVE PAD THAI WITH TOFU!!!!!!!!!\\"\\n\\nSeriously, what the hell?  I was conversing with him just fine before and now he thinks I can't hear him because he notices my ear plugs.  I flipped out and started yelling back at him saying \\"What's your freakin' problem!?  I was talking to you just fine and if you're going to be a dick about it, maybe we should just leave?  What's YOUR problem?\\"\\n\\nHe then started making all these excuses saying that he wasn't sure if I could hear him because I had something in my ears.  Despite me talking to him just a few moments earlier and answering his questions he was being a dick by not taking ownership of his stupidity.   I basically told him that he was being an asshole and that he should be fired for being an ass and not knowing how to make pad thai with ONLY tofu.  If he couldn't figure that out, he shouldn't be in the food business.  My raging migraine went nuclear at this point and I told him that if he continued to yell at me, I'm going to have to find his car and puke all over it.\\n\\nAnyways, I was so frustrated with the dumbsh*t waiter that I just ordered pad thai with everything.  Once it came, it was basically the worst pad thai I have ever had.  It was a tomato sauce based pad thai and was totally white washed asian fare.  Gross.  Imagine banana ketchup over half cooked rice noodles.  Not quite ketchup, overly sweet, no where near what pad thai is supposed to taste like.\\n\\nThe rest of the crew got their orders and the kids didn't particularly like any of it either.  The only thing they finished was the roti.  The only thing that I ate that was good was the beef satay, eggplant, and pineapple fried rice.\\n\\nThe food was less than spectacular, to say the least.  Some of the dishes were OK but overall, it was just a \\"meh.. I'm hungry and the food court next door is closed -- I've got no choice\\" experience.  If it was just me and my family, I would have walked out the moment he flipped out but when you're in a group of 14 with hungry kids you gotta do what you gotta do.\\n\\nBottom line is that if you're into verbal abuse and frustration, this is your place!  I certainly wouldn't return for the food.  I sure hope that server gets fired -- I just wish I got the guy's name.\\n\\nGoodbye Tropika!

So, today I was out with a colleague and decided now was the time. What caught me this time out of the others? Well, for starts, I actually stopped and read the menu on the window. Then, of course, I was trapped by the idea of chicken fried steak (which is one of my favorite foods...mmmm).\\n\\nSo, in we went. Ordered up our meals and waited. Service was actually prompt and food arrived in a very timely manner (this during usual lunch hours). First thing I noticed was that, as the menu stated, this wasn't just some cube steak pounded down and breaded. No, this was a steak, nice and thick and medium rare, breaded and cooked just right. Enough gravy covered it to add to the moisture of the meat and it cut easily. Flavors were good and the potatoes were served in large fried home-style chunks, perfect for cleaning the gravy from the plate. It also came with rapini, which appeared to be sauteed, but was a bit overdone for my liking. I also tried my colleagues poutine (fries with gravy and cheese curds) and they were really tasty. \\n\\nAs far as the food goes, I'd give it a 3.5 - 4 stars (at least from this one experience). However, the atmosphere seemed off to me. I wasn't overly impressed with the plastic chair I sat in at the small plastic table. I can appreciate good food at decent prices and understated surroundings, but it almost seemed like they were trying too hard to NOT be that overpriced type of place that they skimped a bit too much on the seating. In this case, environment brought down my rating to a solid and decent 3.

We passed on a couple of ones we really do want to try - Matt's El Rancho and Maudie's - and by the time the road turned into Lamar we were in full tilt \\"no one would make a decision\\" mode.  Suddenly the Mandola's sign appeared and we just gave up on trying a new place and pulled into the Triangle. \\n\\nVeek spotted the crowd at The Flying Saucer and wanted to go take a look, and we parked and did just that.  You could see immediately that they had a wall full of beer taps, so we went in to at least have a beer and check it out.  There were people on the patio, inside both at tables and a room full of soft, overstuffed furniture, and at the bar.  I'd say all of the little areas were about 2/3 full when we arrived.  We weren't sure what we were going to do yet, so we just sat at the bar and ordered a couple of pints. \\n\\nThe beer selection was fabulous.  Lots of varieties, and their beer menu was laid out by style rather than country or brand.  We both selected a hefeweizen, and they were featuring Veek's choice as a special so that was cool.\\n\\nAs we drank our beers, we started sizing up the place, tangible evidence of the influence Yelp has on us now.  Its like I start thinking about how I'm going to write about the experience when I go into someplace now.\\n\\nThe wait staff was friendly and attentive.  Yeah, the girls are dressed skimpily, but I'm straight, so its cool with me.  The place got more crowded but never seemed to get noticeably noisy.\\n\\nSince we enjoyed our first round, we went for another and decided to try some food.  The first one was a disappointment - a large pretzel with slices of bratwurst, covered in cheese.  We must have read it wrong because we weren't expecting it to be all one thing, but rather a plate with all three as separate items.  It wasn't  - it was kind of a german pizza, and it underwhelmed.  \\n\\nI ordered a bratwurst plate which was excellent, very authentic.  Two types of sausage, some kraut and german potato salad and a warm roll.

The restaurant was pretty empty, and we were the only table there. The server was prompt and friendly, and there were four chefs in the kitchen for this relatively small restaurant. \\n\\nWe tried to order salmon benedict but they were out of salmon. We didn't really understand how they can not be prepared for a dish when they only serve 6 menu options for brunch anyways. So, instead we tried beef omelette and vegetarian omelette. \\n\\nBoth dish came with small fruit salad ( more like a cute epitizer size) composed of chopped strawberries and cantalope. It also came with sides of potatoes,toasts and spicy salsa as a dip. Portions are on larger sides at reasonable pricez\\n\\nOverall, vegetarian omelette was goog. It had avocado, tomatoes, carmelized onions in it and was very tender and creamy. Beef omelette was okay, not as smooth and beef had an weird smell. I also felt like the guyere chesse inside the omelette should have been better incorporated as it didn't melt at all, and was just sitting inside of the omelette as big chunks. \\n\\nCompared to other great brunch places i tried in vancouver (staphano's,abigail's), I wasn't impressed by their brunch.

The outside was super crispy yet not greasy and the inside was light and cinnamony and soft and dense all at the same time.  A few days later I tried a jelly stick.  Equally as delish.  Um, then I went back and got a butternut.  It too, was fantastic.  I like my new slimmer, healthy body, but I really really like these donuts, so I'm at a crossroads!  \\n\\nAs others have said, it's hidden behind the shadow of DD, but definitely worth actually getting out of your car and walking in to get a freshly baked donut from a local joint.

The restaurant is located in a shopping center so there is plenty of parking. This bistro has a very attractive appearance from the outside. When I walked in there were not many patrons so I figured my stay would be short since I was going to order something healthy like a salad. The ambiance was cozy not too small, they have a full bar and patio seating.  \\n\\nNo one was at the hostess stand when I walked in so I walked straight to the bar. After sitting in front of a young lady who works there for about 3 minutes I realized that she had no intentions on greeting me nor asking me if I needed a menu so I had to ask her for a menu. I was given a lunch menu and the items nor the prices were impressive. There was nothing on the lunch menu that I could eat that didn't contain meat and the prices were similar to dinner prices at most Caribbean restaurants. I was then handed a dinner menu and decided on the Bahamian Conch Salad to go. My salad took about 25 minutes to come out and the same rude young lady handed me my bag with no apologies for the wait. The salad was $13 and I had no idea that it would be a small container of chopped up cucumbers, peppers and pineapple with a few tiny pieces of conch soaked in Italian dressing. Totally not worth the price nor wait. \\n\\nI'm thinking I simply ordered the wrong thing, came on the wrong day at the wrong time.

Well, good Pho broth is not made that quick, and it was rather tasteless, barely savory and certainly not complex.

The service was great and the food was very good. The only problem I had with this restaurant was that the breakfast menu ended at 11:00am and my 75 year old father-in-law was not able to have a simple order of home fries and scrabbled eggs. We were told that the breakfast menu ended at 11:00am, the only breakfast items we could order were the items on the all day special board. I changed my breakfast order to a special that was on the board which was basically a bacon and cheese omelet with avocado; which came with a side of home fries and wheat toast. My father-in-law ended up changing his order to only home fries since scrabbled eggs was not on the special all day menu. When I got my food my father-in-law made a comment about how come he could not get his order when it was almost what I got but with even less ingredients. I don't understand myself, I am only giving this place a 3 star because the service and food was great as well as the name.

For $7 more, they'll throw in some foie gras. They have other diner type fare like chicken fried steak, a fancier kind and not the chopped beaten steak but a flank steak. Other playful stuff like, duck'n'waffles with duck confit -check out their website- this dish is on the front page, I'm sure paired with the finest Oregon Pinot. Mac'n'cheese with lobster (today they got crawfish instead), marscapone cheeese and truffle, beer can chicken, Voodoo Donut Burger and...WAIT. A WHAT!? \\n\\nOK. It's a burger with Voodoo Donut for buns. I had to have it. They may need to call an ambulance after I eat it. If I'm going to eat that, might as well get another thing off of their appetizer menu.

First of all, it was not a whopper of a burger (not a 1LB burger) but a dainty one (hey...it's only $7.95!), and the sweet (buns=Voodoo Donut!)) and savory went extremely well.

I could not face the fries, so I opted for a salad with vinaigrette, which was slightly more aggressive (vinegary) that I would have liked. For those of you who think I give too many places with a five-star review: just a reminder that I don't review every place I eat at, I don't think you can truly judge a restaurant just because you ate there once.

Everything is pre made so once you place your order all they have to do is plate it for you. That doesn't mean their food isn't fresh, just that they make it as needed instead of to order (much like Chipotle). \\n\\nMy husband and I came for lunch and each got their chicken platter. For $10 a plate they give you an enormous amount of food! The platters come with a choice of meat (or vegetables), 3 sides, and either feta salad, lentil soup, or lemon chicken soup. \\n\\nThe chicken is sliced fresh off a spit, but a tad lower grade than I like as there was a lot of fat and gristle in it. Some people might argue that they use those cuts because they are more flavorful which I agree with, but getting a bite full of gristle is not very appetizing. I also wasn't used to the spice mixture they used. Normally Greek chicken is seasoned with lemon juice, olive oil, some oregano and garlic, but here it is a deep orange color almost like paprika? I'm not complaining because the flavors were great, just not what I expected is all. \\n\\nI picked the feta salad and for my three sides chose hummus, spanakopita, and the rice pilaf. They give you tzatziki sauce as well, but it lacked flavor to me. When I dipped the good parts of the chicken in it with all the spices however, it was quite good. The hummus and spanakopita I loved, and forgot to mention they give you one free piece of pita bread per platter as well. If you want more, you do have to pay extra for it. \\n\\nThe feta salad was alright, but drowning in dressing. The rice pilaf I didn't care for either because usually it's more of an orzo rice, but here simply tasted like white rice with peas and carrots in it. \\n\\nI do think that for the price you pay and the amount of food you get they are definitely worth checking out. Some of the flavors are there for sure, but I still craved more of the authentic ones. Overall though, good in a pinch with plenty of parking and friendly employees.

I almost want to give Pasha lunch deal/ this place a 5/5. I think it is one of the best things I have experienced so far in 2015. We have been there 2x's in the last couple of weeks. I can see myself becoming a regular patron of this place.\\nThe lunch deal can't be beat. The off the skewer chicken kabobs the first time we went were off the hook! I craved it.  The next time we went however, it seems that they got the meat too close to the flame because it had a scorched taste to it.  That and the ran out of grape leaves that week for their lunch and substituted beets which were nothing outstanding. Chicken Shwarma, meatballs and some sort of seasoned ?curry? fish also available as for the meat selection.  They also had an eggplant dish, seasoned yummy slaw, bread,  great hummus, lentil dish, two different kinds of rice, salad w/homemade dressing, various kinds of vegetables. The lasagna is better some weeks not so great others. I suspect they switch off family members of who is cooking on certain days!?!? They do have soup available on the lunch deal but it is across the room from the buffet so keep your eyes peeled for the pot. I suspect it is because they ran out of outlets on that side of the room so they have it plugged in close to the bar. \\n\\nThe Decor:\\nThey have a lovely patio out back next door to Walter's Patio. The interior has a full bar plenty of seating and is painted in theme to fit Pasha's owners country of origin. They have belly dancing at night on weekends here. I see posters in the window for an 80's night. They have a dance floor area and If I recall correctly a DJ & stage area. You are prob best to phone the Pasha to find out what entertainment they have going on that weekend as I am hard pressed to find any solid info online about it.

They are running a great special that for $12.99 you get a drink, entree, and dessert. Multiple iced teas constantly refilled, seasoned chicken breast over sauteed spinach with grilled shrimp on top, and a choice of another side or a salad so I took the salad with honey mustard dressing. Also came with a nice warm roll and butter, plus I had a slice of cherry pie as dessert. All this for $12.99? Awesome deal. Never see that in NYC!\\n\\nMy waitress was terrific and friendly. Sat at my table for quite a while going over some notes and business files and never felt rushed. She took good care of me and even turned up the AC when I mentioned it was a bit warm. Hey, it was around 95 with a 103 degree heat index today, but Perkins once again made me feel relaxed, cool, and filled with a decent simple meal.\\n\\nTo me, Perkins is a good place to get solid food choices, healthy and otherwise, quick, and at cheap prices.

I tried two very different pizzas- both times, the dough was the star- cooked perfectly so it's both crusty and chewy, not soggy, and with the appropriate slight char at the bottom from the oven.  The pizza with red sauce had a fresh tomato sauce that complimented the pizza ingredients well.  The only downside is the small size of the pizza- I can easily eat the entire pizza by myself for dinner, but for more delicate eaters, it's probably a 2-meal pizza.

I did not have issues with portion size as the food was delicious and not that expensive for how good it was. However, how three waiters could take two hours to serve us with only 7 tables of people in the entire place is beyond me. One waitress literally was running at one point, in a place that is about twenty feet across. She ran, cleared 1/3 of the table and then left the rest of the stuff on their for 20 minutes.  How about less running and a little more organization? At some point every waiter served us instead of focussing on their own tables, this did not speed anything up, it only led to more confusion.  People around us got served before us despite arriving after us and we were having the same dishes.  We had to ask for plates, for more water, for more drinks, and for just about everything.... and then at the end we also had to ask for our check when at that point there were only four tables left and three servers. Some of the slowest and most disorganized serving I have ever witnessed in my long life.

Putting a napkin in front of only 1 guest -- that's just weird, patronizing. When she came back to the table and saw that the guest removed the napkin, she stared at them, expecting explanation. At that point, the guest explained that they found it humiliating to be the only one sitting with a napkin on their part of the table.\\n\\nFrom the very first moment she gave us an attitude by arguing over the correct preparation styles when we just expressed our curiosity over how venison is cooked. Moreover, she got really defensive when we tried to pick out wine -- she was anything but helpful, and the worst of all was her attitude when we were just trying to pick something we'd enjoy. All this time our table was polite and respectful to the waitress, even through her rude attacks.\\n\\nI'd never come back to this place, not even for its good food.

WAIT, not so fast. The drinks took about 10 minutes to arrive and he stated that he would be right back for to take the food order, and he did, about 5 minutes later. We asked about a few items on the menu and I was on the fence between the eggs bend your dick or traditional breakfast. He said that hands down no question the steelhead eggs benedict was top shelf and over the top. We discussed the preparation of the dish and it was very clear how I was going to get the meal.... I was waiting on pins and needles and forgot all about the drink in front of me, and yes it was empty and so was my daughters. No one offered a drink to us even after the wait of about 20 minutes for the meal. Yes, it was delivered, overcooked cold fish on a soggy untoasted English muffin, with a egg that was also almost hard boiled and it was cold also. The dish had tomatoes on it even though we had discussed the precise preparation 1/48th of a day prior...... I was planning on sending the plate back as the fish smell was over powering and after 10 minutes of waiting, I finally pushed the chow around a little on the plate and ending up eating some of it. Now thirsty, my daughter finished with her pancakes, no servers to be found anywhere and the 4 customers in the entire joint seemed to be content, we decided to make out way to the hostess who was clearly counting cars and rain drops, but she actually was the best part of my experience and for this there is a extra star delivered to the review. We did pay her and off we went. Kinda felt like the owners should be informed of a few things as I feel they can be fixed. The location is good. Check. The interior looks and feels good. Check.

We walked in here and we honestly did not know what to expect, we only knew that they had a lot of really good reviews and thought we should try it out. When walking in we were greeted again by 3 sparking smiles standing at the reservation desk. They seated us promptly as well. It was not crowed that night but there were still a lot of people dinning. They brought us to a booth in the back of the restaurant. It was set for 5 but let us have it to ourselves. :D  (the little things make me happy) \\nWe were then seen by a pretty blonde waitress (sorry I don't remember her name) :(\\nShe brought us water and asked us if we needed anything else to drink.... We wanted wine since we noticed this restaurant is big on wine....here is the catch... we know nothing about wine so looking at the BIG menu of wines was over whelming.... so we had the waitress suggest a sweet white wine called moscato d'sati by the bottle. It was wonderfully yummy!!\\nSomething that I found so interesting was how they serve the bread, the waitress brings a tray of 3 different kinds of your choice and you pick which one and how many slices you would like, I picked the sourdough. The only thing that I would have liked is if the bread was warmed up a little. But it was still cool!! :D\\nWe ate the crab cake for an appetizer, (roughly $15) it was really good but it was kind of disappointing that it was only one crab cake instead of two crab cakes for $15. \\nOnce we were done with the appetizer and the bread someone came and took our dishes and then the waitress came by with a scrapper of some kind and scrapped all the crumbs off the table from the bread. OH MY GOODNESS... at that point my jaw had dropped... crumbs on the table is one of my biggest pet peeves when at a restaurant, I am always trying to get every single crumb off. \\nanyway, I ordered the Salmon and my boyfriend ordered the Hickory Steak. His portion of food was pretty big compared to mine. I was jealous. I honestly left a little hungry. But the salmon was delicious and his steak was cook great. The only complaint from him about his steak was that there was a lot of fat. \\nWe ordered the Chocolate Grotto and the Smores brownie. They were both very rich in chocolate and were the best desert that I have had in a long time. \\nThis place really made my week and I had a blast!\\nI ever heard that there are chickens in the back...

My friend and I each had the sweet potato side ($3.90) with a barbeque-something entree ($4.50). I had the bbq tofu and she had the bbq cauliflower. \\n\\nSeeing the prices of the entrees were initially a shock - it was so cheap for an entree, but upon receiving the dish, $4.50 seemed like a bit much to charge. I had 3 very thin slices of tofu slathered in bbq sauce that could not have cost more than $1.50 to make. The plate was the size of my hand (with fingers spread) and I have small hands. The taste of the bbq tofu was just okay. I honestly just tasted the sauce, which was tangy and spicy. It was a zinger, but I felt like I was eating slabs of sauce. \\n\\nThe sweet potatoes were really sweet, tender and flavorful. I liked my side of sweet potatoes but It was also quite expensive for a small dish (the same size as the entree). \\n\\nThe food took such a long time to cook and bring out. I would guess maybe 30-45 minutes, which is kind of ridiculous because all we got were sweet potatoes (probably not made-to-order) and tofu slabs with sauce on top.

So cheap!!\\n \\nThe real reason to hit up The Tavern? $5 pitcher specials. The selection varies between Coors and Bud but what do you expect for $5? Drafts of specials are $2 and other drafts are just barely more expensive. The bar offers a poker night, trivia night, amazing karaoke competition (in an 'I'm so embarrassed for you' kind of way), scratch ticket machine, Keno TVs, tons of flat screen TVs for watching the game of your choice, a dart board (bring your own darts) and two pool tables.

My chef could bang out every meal option in less than 10 minutes.  Brought my boyfriend there last night for his birthday, and had thought about taking out, but either way the food would take the same amount of time to make (plus we were the only people in the restaurant).  When we walked in no one was there to greet us, and it was so humid! I know if no one's there you don't have to have the A.C. blasting, but damn.  We waiting a few minutes, rang the bell, and then some guy (who we later on figured was the delivery guy) came in and rang the bell louder.  The lady sat us down and gave us water.  We ordered our food, and I must say it came out within reasonable time.  She was mostly attentive and refilled our water a few times.  Let me tell you, at the Thai place I worked at (though with it's faults) if someone orders a curry dish they get unlimited rice until they are full.  I'd say I got about a cup of rice, and really needed double to use up all my curry (and was charged $1.25).  After we finished eating it took a while for her to come back to the front to take our plates away, but I gave her a decent tip.  I really would love this place to be successful.  \\nI got the yellow curry with duck.  The duck was slightly fatty.  Afterwards my stomach was bloated, which is really odd for me since I eat Thai food pretty often, and did straight for the 7 months I worked at a Thai restaurant.  My boyfriend got the Hawaiian fried rice and he said it was good. No complaints from his side (though he was a little gassy too).  They had a help wanted sign, which I'm guessing would help them in the service department, but don't run a business without enough helping hands.\\nI will go back again, for take out, and if I get curry I rather make the extra rice at home."},{"name":"Southern Proper","address":"600 Harrison Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"OPENING NIGHT AT SOUTHERN PROPER (SOWA, SOUTH END)\\n\\nSpur of the moment, we decided to check out opening night at Southern Proper, featuring Chef Jason Cheek (ex-KO Prime, Toro, Coppa, Little Donkey, Sam's on the Waterfront, Merrill & Co, The Maiden) returning to his childhood roots in southern cooking.\\n\\nOpening night was packed, and since the reservation book wasn't opening until night two, we got placed on a 1-hour waiting list after arriving at 6PM.  No big deal, since we could wander next door to Gaslight and have a couple of cocktails while we were waiting (also giving us a $15 off validation for the parking lot next to Gaslight).\\n\\nSo far, media write-ups have suggested that Jason's menu represents so-called \\"low country\\" cuisine of the South Carolina coast, as well as up-country \\"Piedmont\\" cuisine.  Which is interesting, considering he hails from North Carolina.  While I'm no expert on southern cooking, the menu seemed more general than that (shrimp & grits, fried chicken, hushpuppies, a small variety of smoked meats) and didn't feature the greater seafood focus I was expecting for low country cuisine.\\n\\nWe enjoyed:\\n\\nCOCKTAIL: Pinochle, a draft cocktail of peanut-washed rye whiskey and Coca-Cola\\n~Apparently, Jason's grandma would soak Coca-Cola in peanuts, and this was certainly a very peanutty drink.  Interesting, but I wouldn't it order again (and it needs a longer straw, which otherwise sinks into he Coke bottle and is useless)\\n\\nDEVILED EGGS: Dill, paprika, vinegar powder ($5 for 4 halves)\\n~Quite serviceable, but nothing unusual\\n\\nCHEESEBURGER: American cheese (2 slides), pickles, cheese sauce, fried potatoes\\n~A messy, but tasty burger, particularly if you are into cheese, cheese, and more cheese.  I can't remember ever seeing a second slice of cheese melted on the outside TOP of a bun!  Is that a thing???  The fried potatoes were good, but needed some hot sauce and the 2 provided house sauces (\\"red hot\\" & \\"pepper vinegar\\" lacked punch and were not that interesting.  I would order this again, if I wanted to melt into my burger\\n\\nFRIED CHICKEN: Hot ($18 for 4 pieces)\\n~Also available in a non-spicy version, I thought this was very good fried chicken, with a nice crispy, spiced crust and tender, slightly moist meat.   Apparently it was brined in Lipton tea, although I can't say I could really tell, and pressure fried.  I'm not sure if there is any attempt to reproduce Nashville-style hot chicken here, or if the spice blend is completely different, but I do have to say, it wasn't very spicy (although I'm a spice-nic, so YMMV).  If you are familiar with the famous Hattie B's in Nashville, this would rank as the mild level or a bit more.\\n\\nSIDES: Buttermilk biscuits, pimento mac & cheese, collard greens\\n~Good size sides.  The biscuits (2) were delicious, crispy on the outside, airy and buttery on the inside.  The greens were also good, with chunks of pork and a strongly smokey flavor I liked, although I would have preferred them a bit more al dente.  I'm not a fan of mac & cheese, so I only ordered it to text a picture to my mac & cheese-iac friends Ron & Katie, but it seemed serviceable to me.\\n\\nDESSERT: Chef's selection of fresh pies daily, it was a Smores pie tonight\\n~Tasty, covered in thick burnt meringue, although I was so stuffed I don't think I could really appreciate it\\n\\nService, although a bit slow at times, was generally good and enthusiastic, despite being a packed opening night.\\n\\nThe airy interior of SP is attractive and intriguing, with 16-seat bar, open kitchen, quirky antique lamps hanging from the ceiling, and very extensive use of pine wood that supposedly harkens back to a tobacco barn (so much so, that the aroma of pine trees pervaded the evening).  I also thought the round, tri-tiered standing room tables (one tier for your coats and bags, one for food and another for drinks) looked like a cool way to casually hang out with friends after work.  Overall, seating for about 100.  Noise level was energetic, but not over the top when packed.  Sound track of '70s, '80s, '90s music.\\n\\nStreet parking is not too bad in this area, depending on time of day, and there are two lots further up Harrison (although no validation by SP).\\n\\nOverall, I think this is some of the best southern cooking I've had in the Boston area, and I will definitely return.  However, I was a little disappointed that the menu seemed so generally Southern in nature and was not as focused as we had been led to believe."},{"name":"Thailander","address":"1275 NW 185th Ave","city":"Hillsboro","stars":"4","text":"Great portion size and decor, super nice waitress. \\n\\nThe pad thai was not great..

We have been customers since the day they opened their doors a few years ago.  The sushi has always been okay for a non-Japanese Japanese restaurant.  Nothing stellar but good in a pinch after a long week, plus the biggest reason we have been consistent customers is because they deliver.  However, they seem to have a revolving door with their staff both in the kitchen and on the floor.  The per-requisite for wait staff seems to be rudeness. The food has been inconsistent, I mean bones in the salmon roll and weird chewy cuts of fish in the rolls..maybe we're gluttons for punishment or lazy but we kept dialing that delivery number for \\"old skanky\\" (our nickname for the place) every once in a while.  By the way, this is not our usual sushi place, just the one for cold, wet rainy nights when no one wants to head out to pick up an order.\\n\\nThe last time they delivered, the driver was surly, told us to call the restaurant to process the credit card and the person on the phone demanded to know if we tipped the driver and how much to add to the total if we hadn't  tipped him.  \\n\\nSo we are doing something we should have done a long time ago.

Mind you, the four teeny gyozas (I understand we could call them dumplings, but gyozas are gyozas) cost me $6!!!!!! that price is outrageous for the quality and quantity of dumplings. Again, I could have bought a bag of 20 at Trader Joe's and steamed them myself for $4 at the most. \\n\\nIn addition, the server convinced my boyfriend to get the Thai iced coffee (which I  normally really enjoy), but the coffee was very burned and was also overpriced (I believe around $4). I've made both traditional Thai iced coffee and tea, and even though I'm by no means a Thai connoisseur, mine is better and never burned. \\n\\nI feel that the other people who wrote reviews for Com Bun Yeu are either good friends of the owners or visiting Austin and thinking trailers are all awesome in general.

I had lunch here and was very satisfied with the service - the waitress was really nice - as well as the food. \\n\\nThe sample plates are good for sharing and I love them. The spicy king crab is really amazing, soft-shell crabs (4 bites max) with spicy sauce and a fried bun, very delicious and not too overwhelming with the heat, everyone can enjoy this dish. The roasted duck is so tender you can break it off with chopsticks, and the sauce it's smothered in just lifts the dish to another level. The coconut shrimp and golden dumplings were good as well, the pairing sauce with them are each unique in their own way. \\n\\nOnto the main dish, which is bigger than the sample plates but in a perfect size for one to finish, we ordered the Viet bun and the yaki udon. Yaki udon is very nice, not overly salted, just right with the taste, amount of the noodles to bean sprouts is 50/50, plenty of vegetables. The Viet bun is mainly vegetables, very healthy, but the only complaint I have for that is the spring rolls that go with it isn't as tasty as I would have expected. \\n\\nOnto the dessert, I love the mochi trio. The lychee one isn't too sweet, just enough, the green tea one is slightly bitter to go against the sweetness, and the Thai tea one has stronger tea flavor. The purple sticky rice is ok, I don't like the crunchy bits in the sticky rice though.

Every single time we go, we say never again, yet always seem to forget and go again since it's the only place in town like it.  The service couldn't be any worse.  You name it -- they seating is some randomly assigned priority (which we all know is friends), they waitresses leave you waiting forever.  Once I timed 40 minutes.  Wrong food, missing orders, disappearing waitresses, 1/2 hour wait for the check.  Rudeness.  No silverware.  You name it.  And the kitchen is no better.  They're actually probably why the wait is so long since they are ridiculously slow and messed up.  The food is inconsistent.  Good enough sometimes to make you think the place might be worth it, but always over-priced.  And don't even think about to-go.  An hour wait is not unusual, but your chances are greater than not that something will be wrong or missing entirely.  And then they will make you wait another hour to fix it.  \\n\\nOne highlight -- the place LOOKS great and is in a great location.

Little Sheep is definitely inferior to Hai Di Lao or imperial Treasure for those who've had the opportunity to try these 2 remarkable joints. \\n\\nFinally on 2/8/2015, the doors to my current favorite hotpot place in Atlanta opened. This place has horrendous service which I already expected beforehand. It does not bother me as much as it does others but I enjoy the value I get in terms of quality/quantity. Clearly the best broth around more than makes up for their lack of attention. \\n\\nFor ~ $20, you get to have a decent selection of meat and vegetables, as well as food already cooked like Xiao Long Bao, Scallion Pancakes etc which I do not order at all. Uncooked food here are obviously frozen, like any other hotpot place around including mini-hotpot/Shabu & Shabu. It is just more evident that the food here just came out of the freezer because of the large quantities of items they're dealing with daily, which leaves no time for defrosting. I tried almost all of the items with additional charge and they are the usual frozen items that are served at other hotpot places nearby. I find that I could do without them considering there's already an endless amount of other items.\\n\\nI noticed some people mentioning the 2 hour time limit. I have to say that on both occasions that I went, the restaurant was packed and I had no issues at all with the time limit. In fact, I was so full I wished my chair would turn into a sofa so I could laze around until it felt comfortable to walk.\\n\\nHopefully they hire more servers to help with the crowds in the near future, if you pay attention to the employees, you'll notice that they are definitely not slacking off. Someone is always shaving the meat slices consistently, 2-3 servers are always washing silverware/dishware, and the rest are running around pushing carts, refilling drinks and delivering sauces. These guys are worked to the bone so that we can dine here for ~ $20.\\n\\nTips \\n\\n1. Take a picture of the menu before you hand it back to them so you know what to order next instead of having to ask them for that sheet of paper and having to wait again.\\n\\n2.

By the way, I was carrying a handbag which cost close to $500, and was wearing drop dead beautiful Cartier jewelery., definitely did not look like a bum.  We were seated, and the waiter had to be waited upon to arrive, we waited about ten minutes,  the manager passed us by twice, commenting on his absent waiter, and then  fetched him from somewhere.

He said that all of them were good and walked away. When he returned I somehow managed to have him recommend the French Martini since I asked for something sweet (which by the way isn't exactly my idea of sweet, rather a bit tart). My friend asked for a half a shot of Bailey's with coffee, to which his response was \\"we only do full shots.\\" No other clarification, such as \\"it would still be the price of a full shot if that's ok?\\"\\nThe only appealing element all night was the brussel sprouts which were good. But we were there for an HOUR & a HALF before our main course was served. The waiter did inform us after about 45 minutes after our appetizers were cleared, that the kitchen was behind and our food would be out shortly. Finally 30 minutes later our main dish eventually came. I was able to sample every dish our table ordered (lamb, pork chop, tofu) & all were mediocre at best, and the desserts (bread pudding & chess pie) fared about the same.\\nI am very disappointed overall and have no intentions on returning.

I had gone there when it was open under a previous owner and remember just how unmemorable my \\"asian\\" experience was.\\nA co-worker/friend of Amanda's suggested we go there and we finally decided to check it out. Now we had just gotten back from a cruise in Miami...literally and we were in no mood to be chefs that day and after a week of absolutely horrid \\"food\\" we were praying for at least some descent food...well....I must say...Hawkers delivered far beyond our expectations! How many times can you really remember leaving a restaurant totally pleased and possibly even elated?\\nI can think of no better way to describe our experience other than joyous. The Roti bread was cooked to absolute perfection and the curry dipping sauce commanded us to order yet another piece. I mean why would you waste a delicious sauce like that?!lol We didn't...and neither should anyone else. The Laksa was completely balanced in flavor(as was everything else). My only complaint...and trust me, it's a small one, the satay sauce was a bit bland which would have been very dissapointing had we not been givin such delicious dishes to cover up for it.lol \\nEven though it was upsetting about the lack of shrimp in those rolls, they were absolutly delicious. The only place that does em better is Little Saigon. Anyways, the service and atmosphere were fantastic. Our server had way too many tables for one person but he continued to offer us and the other patrons exemplary service. I wish I could remember his name. He deserves to be mentioned. I had considered giving only 4 stars but I just couldn't. We haven't left a restaurant feeling that great in a while.

The place is tiny.  I was introduced to this place by my boyfriend who had discovered it 5 years previously when owner, Frank, bought it. It has since changed ownership (Frank went on to open Frank's Noodle House in Portland) but the food hasn't changed too much.  The food is still delicious.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the food isn't enough to keep me coming back.  My last few experiences here have been a bust. While the food is consistently good, the service, is lacking. I've had a recent string of bad customer service experiences every time that I have gone out to eat. Is it something in the water or am I being discriminated against?\\n\\nOnce seated, it seemed like we were forgotten after our orders were taken. Two parties were seated after us and they were served their drinks and complimentary kimchi and radishes immediately.  It was apparent that they were regulars because of how attentive the waiters were towards them. I'm not peeved about that. I am peeved about being ignored and forgotten. Had I not stopped the waiter (twice), we would never had received our drinks. When I asked him how long until we get our drinks, he brought us the menu. I reminded him very nicely that we already ordered our drinks and we ordered it from him.  \\n\\nAll in all. The service sucks. Expect it to be slow but when you don't have kimchi and radishes or your drinks to bide the time, that wait time seems even longer.  The food is DELICIOUS!!!  We had our usual; dumplings, pork bulgolgi, and baby bok choy.  So good. The menu has changed since I've been here last and there are some dishes that I would like to try however...will I come back? No. Will I come back if invited? No. I would rather go to the restaurant next door or down the street.

Dai Due is yet another restaurant on the Eastside that left me speechless after the first bite.\\n\\nI decided to try it out after hearing about Tuesday Ladies Night, which features a 6 oz. steak for a mere $10, topped off with female artists belting out of the stereo all night, like Britney Spears and Taylor Swift. Throw some champs in there and I'm good to go.\\n\\nEven though our server suggested the Tempranillo to pair with our steak, I choose the Sauvage Blancs de Blancs, which is a sparkling wine and still tasted excellent with the food. I know, I know; I should've chosen a red, but I will always go with the bubbly option.\\n\\nFor side dishes, we ordered the venison ceviche and kale au gratin. I would have never thought venison with ceviche could be a good combination, but its spicy and tangy flavor was hair-raising. I usually only eat kale raw and thought the kale au gratin was a nice differentiator, as it was very creamy and delectable. It's nice to see kale on the menu as a more health conscious side, as well- even if the 'au gratin' might have canceled that out (#worthit).\\n\\nOur server suggested ordering the steak cooked at a medium temperature because it holds in the flavor and seasoning. At $10, my expectations weren't too high. Dai Due really surprised me and served up some of the most mouthwatering, juicy six ounces of steak I've ever consumed.

The place has a nice ambience. It was romantic without being stuffy. Though it seemed rather busy to me, we were seated right away, on a Friday night, without a reservation. \\n\\nOur server, whose name escapes me, was very nice. She was very helpful in suggesting drinks and entrees according to our current tastes. My boyfriend had a Lurk in the Ditch, of which to me tasted like cough syrup. He said that he didn't mind the taste. I had the Eleventy One and it had a very herbal taste. My favorite drink of the night was Lavender 75. It was very refreshing. I am beginning a theory in Decatur - that the drinks come in baby cups at these restaurants. I have only been to one other restaurant in Decatur, which also had these insultingly, yet interestingly small glasses. I will have to further my research. These small and expensive drinks could be a product of the fresh ingredients that the server told us they use. On to the food...\\n\\nWe had the minted zucchini salad crustini as an appetizer. Meh it what I typed into my notes beside it. I think there were two pieces on the plate. It was definitely something that I could have made at home. I wasn't impressed. For our entrees, I had Gnocchi and my bf had pork loin. Both of us thoroughly enjoyed our choices, BUT the portions are so small that I was hungry again 30 minutes after we left. This was quite upsetting, since I was starving when I got there. I had expected the lamb that accompanied my dish to large enough for me to distinctly taste it, but it was so small that it looked like minced garlic. Just like the drinks, the portions were small, and the prices were high. Again, this must be attributed to the farm-to-table movement. Be advised that the menu changes often according to the season and availability of ingredients. Don't get your heart set on anything, because it may not be able the next time you make your rounds here. \\n\\nWe opted our of dessert because we didn't want to be duped again with a small portion size for two people. Plus, there wasn't anything that compelled either of us to want to try. All in all, it was a great experience. We now know what to expect when we go back. Yes we will be going back.

In our three years together we've hit up the best places in town: Chops, One Midtown Kitchen, Hal's, Horseraddish Grill, Two Urban Licks, just to name a few. Friday's date night at Bistro Niko was right up there. Y'all, it was truly a five star date.\\n\\nStar 1: We knew it was going to be a great date when we pulled up next to a bright red Ferrari Spider. For those of you who know my gear-head man y'all know it made his night. I told him if he ever got a Ferrari I'd buy red lipstick and nail polish to match the color of the car. He laughed and we proceeded into Bistro Niko.\\n\\nThe restaurant space has a serious wow factor. We walked in and I was immediately impressed with the open kitchen. The smells wafting out of the space were divine. Thankfully we'd made a reservation and were promptly seated. \\n\\nStar 2: somehow we got the best table in the place! We were seated in one of the sumptuous booths facing out into the restaurant. Perhaps it was one of the tables reserved for Open Table reservations, or we looked that damn good, perhaps we just got lucky; either way, we had an awesome place to enjoy our meal.\\n\\nStar 3: greeted within one minute by our fabulous server. She was great. I loved the Syrah she recommended, our wine and waters were never empty, and had great menu selections she highlighted for us to help narrow down our food decision.\\n\\nStar 4: \\"OH-MY-GOD-THIS-IS-SO-GOOD!\\" was all I could keep saying. First we had the escargot. The escargot were exactly how I like them: tender, flavorful, swimming in butter and covered with flaky pastry puffs. Then we tackled the mussels in the most fabulous broth ever. Despite what I've read from other reviews, the mussels were pretty big and tasted fresh. They came with warm, crusty bread: perfect for dipping in the broth or noshing on with butter.\\n\\nWe skipped the salads to save room for our entrees and I'm very glad we did. The scallops were the best I ever had. Pan-fried with that golden crust, swimming in a butter-wine-lemon sauce complimented by tender asparagus and cherry tomatoes over a potato puree. I can't tell you how many times I said awesome during this meal. Kevin P. had the skate wing which we learned is wholly-roasted in the oven for 13 minutes, then deboned and finished by frying in a pan. I've never had skate until this evening. Now I'm officially a fan. Kevin P. even ate the spinach served alongside the skate which he said was \\"not bad.\\" This is a really high compliment from my husband when it comes to leafy greens. We finished our meal by sharing the decadent chocolate cake laced with bourbon and orange flavors.\\n \\nStar 5: the ambiance of Bistro Niko. In some reviews you'll read that it's loud in the restaurant (which is true) but awesome if you're on a date. You can say almost anything to your partner and it won't be heard by the table next to you due to the dim roar. The restaurant itself is designed for conversation. The architecture is great, especially the accents on the ceiling and walls. It was cool to see the variety of people: tourists, businessmen, kids going to prom, other couples on dates. Bistro Niko is building a solid reputation with the ATL and it's well deserved.\\n\\nI close saying this: if you really want to wow your lady, take her to Bistro Niko.

She is very picky, so if she finds something she likes, she sticks with it.  \\n\\nThis last visit was a disappointment.  They've changed the meat that they use in their Reuben sandwich and it's nowhere near the quality that it used to be.  I know that they've changed it because I submitted a complaint online to their website and their GM called to discuss it.  While I think it shows a true commitment to customer service for the GM to personally respond via telephone to a complaint submitted online, it doesn't change the fact that they've made mistake in changing their menu.  Apparently they used to brine and cook their own corned beef in-house and it was always consistently tender, flavorful, and not fatty or chewy.  Now they use an outside vendor and the meat is already pre-sliced and cooked!  Why would a restaurant that specializes in seasoning and roasting all of their meat in-house move to an outside vendor for one product?  \\n\\nWhen I shared this with my mom, she said, \\"I guess we'll have to cross that one off the list.\\"  So, my husband and I may be back for the fondue, because as far as I can tell, that hasn't changed, but we wont be back when family is in town.

The coffee is good here, I've had drip and some cappaccinos from here and they have always been good. The food is definitely decent, although my favorite thing on the menu is the grilled cheese.

The \\"Avocado Salad\\" was delicious.  The \\"Sake Aioli\\" was amazing.  The \\"Hinomaru\\" with its shisa leaf was wonderful.  The \\"Otoro Caviar\\" melted as soon as you tasted it.  We finished with the \\"Crunch Lobster Box\\".  Wow!\\n\\nFinally we had a desert which was called the \\"Chocolate Box\\" which contained a molten chocolate cake and a scoop of green (tea?) ice cream.  Perfect!\\n\\nWe shared everything.  Many of the items came as two pieces only and having just one of each item made each one a flavor to savor.

The space is gorgeous, with tables for various different sizes of groups, the backroom is huge and can accommodate a bunch of large groups so it's definitely an ideal space for birthdays or other special occasions with many people. The bar space is great too with two long bars in the front room and back room. When the weather's nice, the round tables for four people near the open windows in the front are great for people watching. \\n\\nThe menu tends to have new items every once in the while, and there's usually dinner specials. Saturday and Sunday they start with brunch, afternoon menu from 2:30-4:00pm then the full dinner menu. However, all these menus include pasta and pizza so you'll have those options all day.\\n\\nFor food, two of my favorites was a Steak Tartare special that came with salsa verde and crispy shallots (amazing, unique take on a classic app) and a new app that's on the summer menu, which is a Zucchini Flower (lightly fried zucchini with a ricotta sauce). While I usually choose pizzas with meat, I really like the Zucca pizza with is awesome for vegetarians with squash, burrata and pesto. For brunch, the steak and eggs (on the pricier side, but a generous portion you can even share the dish) is tender and the corn/zucchini salad pairs well. You definitely can't go wrong with the Short Rib Arancini (fried rice balls). I like their pizzas more than the pastas, and the chicken parm seems like a popular choice as well.\\n\\nThey also have a downstairs section (Supper Club) with live music Thurs to Sat nights, and you can either reserve a section at a fixed price ahead of time to guarantee your party to get in (seems like they have a lot of private events down there) have dinner upstairs and then put your name on the list to go down (preference over getting downstairs sooner than if you just walked in). It seems confusing at first since there's no waitlist to call in and put your name down, but they do have a limited menu for food which you can reserve for a small party ahead of time.\\n\\nService is great, everyone is so friendly and it feels like a comfortable place to eat, relax, and hang out.

They were good, but not as good as Danny's Diner (sadly no longer walking distance for me).  My boyfriend had some sort of Southwest style omelet, which was quite tasty.  He also got the fired mashed potatoes that they do, which I would definitely get next time, as they are far tastier than the unmashed kind.  The service was prompt, and the food was tasty and filling all at a pretty low price.  I can't ask for much more from a breakfast place.  I'm sure I'll be back again to try something else on their menu (the Belgian waffle selections were very tempting!).  If I could, I'd probably give 3 1/2 stars, but the slightly over-runny eggs and mediocre potatoes pull the score down again.  Still, I'll go again!"},{"name":"Local Roots","address":"15 E Olentangy St","city":"Powell","stars":"4","text":"This has become a favorite lunch spot.

They seem to use excellent quality ingredients (shrimp, scallops, beef, etc), but everything, absolutely everything is flavored with nothing more than crappy sauces (soy and the other most common one which I can't write here because the spell checker refuses entry) and sugar.  This food was easily the very worst of its kind that I have ever had anywhere in the world (New York, Los Angeles, Taipei, Tokyo, Osaka, Hong Kong, etc).  ANY native Japanese dinner would walk out in extreme disgust with this Chinese-owned horror show.  The prices for this type of food, if tasty, would be reasonable, but given just how poor the taste is, this restaurant is a complete zero.  I would not go back, even for free.  Also, these \\"chefs\\" are actually damaging the cooking surface making cleanup more difficult and bacteria growth more likely.  Oh... lastly, seeing people having sake squirted into their mouths from a few feet away, only to drool, splash and spit sake and saliva onto their neighbors, clothing and plates, is about as repulsive as one can imagine.

I love the brightly lit and whimsical decor. The birch tree stencil on the windows, the decorative pillows, the chalkboard wall with specials and other little details. \\n\\nI was curiously drawn to this restaurant by claims that this restaurant has very authentic Thai dishes. One of them being the Khao soi. I don't particularly like this dish simply because of the sweet curry flavor. There is a whole chicken thigh in this curry noodle soup, yellow egg noodles, and bean sprouts, pickled cabbage and other vegetables garnish. \\n\\nThe second dish is a clay pot cellophane noodle with two giant prawns. My husband thought the prawns tasted frozen and not fresh. Overall, I like the uniqueness of the dish. I have never had anything like it before at a Thai restaurant and I would have it again. The portion however is very small and you would need to order an appetizer otherwise you would be leaving hungry. \\n\\nWe also ordered the Thai spicy beef salad. The flavor was on point. The only thing I wish was for there to be more vegetables for color and texture. \\n\\nWe also ordered the curry beef penang. The beef tendons were very chewy. I wouldn't recommend this dish for that reason. \\n\\nIf we hadn't ordered so much food, I believe the Indonesian fried rice would have been amazing because it looked amazing. Sadly we ordered way too much to be able to fairly rate this dish. \\n\\nThai iced tea was standard. We never have room for dessert. Service was extremely friendly and prompt.

In the beginning I was going once every week, sometimes twice.  The passion has waned over the years, but only slightly.  This is a place I go when its cold outside (hah) and I want something hot, spicy, and hearty.  I come here when I want something reasonably quick, cheap, and filling.  I bring folks from out of town sometimes, but only after taking them out for barbecue first.  I've watched a few games here, but there are better places for that.\\n\\nFor me, Chili Parlor is about consistency.  They've got it right probably nine out of ten times.  There is the occasional tenth experience, usually after a busy weekend when any number of things can go wrong:  no more chunks of brisket left in the spicy chili, wait staff spread too thin, billing errors, etc.  But I can count on the ambience and the friendly drunk murmur of the regular clientele.  I can count on walking in starving and walking out beef stoned.\\n\\nI usually go with the spicy chili or the gumbo.  The former has large chunks of brisket and what looks like a chocolate brown roux.  A large bowl is just the right amount for me.  It has a perfect degree of spice that doesn't overpower the taste but still makes you reach for the water after every few bites.  In the summer I'll even break into a sweat.  Sometimes I use the onions and jalapenos that come standard with the order, sometimes I go crazy and order it with cheese on top.  It does not have beans, as it damned well shouldn't.  A white bean chili with green chilies and chunks of pork tenderloin is a slightly milder and less-heavy alternative to the standard brown beefs.  Be prepared to sleep alone after a bowl of that one, though.  The gumbo is my personal favorite.  It used to only be served on Sundays, and for a while I was showing up almost every week for my bowl.  It's lighter than the brown chilies, and sometimes I feel like it could benefit from a similarly hearty base, but really the nearly-clear broth base is better suited to keep the chicken, sausage and veggies fresh.  Besides, everybody else does a dark brown gumbo.\\n\\nTamales can be dry, but cheese enchiladas with chili are good for your cheese-addict wife.  Chili-mac is the foundation of something brilliant, but as it stands it's just overcooked noodles with chili on top.  It would be amazing if they actually had macaroni and cheese accompanying their chili.  Until that happens, skip it.  The nachos are nothing special, but they're good for snacking and the house salsa isn't bad.  Don't get the guacamole.  The burgers are better than most, but they can sometimes be a bit heavy-handed with the liquid smoke.  And even though they probably hear it all the time, they really ought to serve French fries.  (They might be prohibited from deep frying, which would explain a lot.)  A baked potato with chili has to suffice, and it does so well enough, I suppose.  Chili goes better with rice anyway, but you don't ever see that pairing offered.\\n\\nThere's a lot of little stuff you can point to at the Chili Parlor to argue a case for three stars (I've heard stories), but in doing that I think you would miss the bigger picture.  Come here a few times and try different things.  Come here for the atmosphere, when you want something rich and complex that isn't pretentious or expensive.  When you don't know where else to go, when you're not quite sure what you're hungry for:  Chili Parlor."},{"name":"Umi","address":"3050 Peachtree Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Umi is heaven on Earth.

Not charming outdoor scenery, no chance at feeling any sunlight, and just dark and a little depressing. \\nWe ordered the spinach and artichoke dip appetizer. It came out quickly, which was good. However, the waitress neglected to bring us any silverware or napkins and we had to grab some off of an empty table. As for the dip itself, not really that good. I've had much better quality dip with large chunks of artichoke and a consistent texture. This was really just a dish of melted cheese someone had sprinkled spinach in. I've had better at Kona Grill, and that's a sushi place!!\\n\\nFor drinks I tried the Passion Fruit Madras. It came out in a glass only slightly larger than a Scotch tumbler and packed with ice. Hardly worth it for $7. I will give them this though, the beers they brew are really good. My husband had the Bavarian Hefe and the Northern Light and they were good and reasonably priced. \\n\\nWe didn't bother with ordering food.

It was empty in here, with only one person to man the counter and one cook quickly handling orders as they came in. The drive through menu even had sections of it that were missing, presumably from vandalism that were bandaged with a few pieces of paper taped to replace whatever went missing.

The dish came with taboule, hummus, grape leaves, babba ghannouj, falafel, kafta kabab and chicken shawarma. We were happy we shared because if we had not been really hungry there was enough food for 4 people. We ended up eating all of arnabeet, and the main dish, while taking half of the feta home with us. There was just so much deliciousness to eat.\\n\\nThe server was efficient and I was never out of water. There was a large group that came in after we did and the staff was very helpful answering all the questions they had about what each person had in front of them, since they had trickled in at different times. We didn't really have any questions, so they just took our order and made sure we were happy,  always had pita, and always had water.\\n\\nThe only downside was the baklava. It was tasty, but they made it in a unique fashion that made it difficult to cut into and difficult to eat. They had one thick layer of nut paste on top of rock hard filo dough. There was also a layer of flaky filo dough on top, it was like a sandwich instead of a dessert. All that said, when I finally got the baklava into my mouth it was delicious. I wold give this part 4 stars instead of 5 stars. \\n\\nAll and all I will defiantly be coming back again. I am deciding between this place and a Korean BBQ place for my next celebration.

When the waiter came back for our food order, we asked why he had responded to our friend that way; he just said he wasn't going to serve him and he wouldn't serve us either. We asked to speak to the manager and the manager wouldn't give us an explanation either. The rest of our group was able to drink. We were all the same level of tipsy, about 3 or 4 beers in, yet a select few of us were cut off entirely without any explanation. At the end of the day it's the establishment's choice to serve or not to serve, but I will not patronize a restaurant where the standard is arbitrary and without reason. People typically go to a beer garden expecting to order a beer."},{"name":"Urban Hearth","address":"2263 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4.5","text":"Food is ok but overpriced for the amount provided.

I've found myself walking home, cold and hungry, at 1 in the morning more times than I would like to admit. I love the Hawthorne, because it pretty much solves both problems:\\n\\n#1 - you can order food after midnight here - the spinach and artichoke dip is delicious. It's served hot with crudit√© (aka sliced raw radishes, carrots and cucumber) and tortilla chips (which are slightly too salty). They also serve a whipped ricotta dip and a pretzel with mustard. Perfect late night food. And if you show up at a normal food-eating time (e.g. 10pm), there are even more options from which to choose (although I'd still probably order the spinach and artichoke dip). \\n\\n#2 - it's located in the Commonwealth hotel, and there's a taxi stand right outside. Score. \\n\\nWhat else makes the Hawthorne so awesome? Outstanding, unique cocktails, whimsical d√©cor, and outstanding service. They also have a back room that can be rented for private parties (max number is 50). Out for our ladies' night, my friends and I spent several minutes discussing the whimsical elegance of the d√©cor. We referred to Kate Spade, and also Alice in Wonderland. It's Ethan Allen meets upstairs in the Square, but in black and white. The wall furnishings are clever (including a faux eye exam chart). The lighting is just muted enough so that everyone looks their best, and so that it's impossible to say if the walls are grey or a pastel purple, blue, or green. It feels a bit like a movie star or a princess' boudoir (sort of like that old IKEA commercial with the princess bedroom - but much more classy). This is also a great place to have a conversation with a few close friends, and an impressive second or third date spot.\\n\\nThe staff is extremely helpful and welcoming. I've been to The Hawthorne a few times, and have generally had a great experience. This time, we sat down at a table in the back, and the hostess immediately followed us with cocktail menus when she saw we were sitting. A waiter came over immediately, and was very helpful in getting us food right away. We didn't end up ordering cocktails, but our waiter couldn't have been any nicer. In fact, he's the one who told us about the room in the back. It definitely helped that the bar was less busy by then, but it was still very nice of him to take the time to help us.\\n\\nMy only complaint: This bar has a penchant for playing songs by the same artist back to back. 5 Beyonce songs followed by 6 Katy Perry songs. I don't listen to albums very often anymore, but these aren't even albums, just random collections of songs. It's like a spotify playlist organized in order of artist. Someone needs to find this place a better DJ. Or at least shuffle up their playlist. \\n\\nOkay, one more complaint, actually: One Saturday night, the bar was over capacity. A woman took down my name and number, and said she would call when it cleared out. Luckily, Eastern Standard is close by and also serves delicious cocktails. So if you want cocktails, go to Kenmore Square. Anyway, this woman never called, even once the bar had cleared out. When Eastern Standard got too boring, we headed back over to the Hawthorne and it was practically empty. We were a little annoyed, as you can imagine. However, the staff was so welcoming that we forgot about our irritation right away."},{"name":"Donair King Restaurant","address":"1028 Davie Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"I don't know if I'd go as far to call him the Donair King, but I'll at least give him \\"Prince of Donairs\\".\\n\\nSince I enjoyed my first Donair in Ottawa, back in 1999 (Shawarma Deluxe, oh how I miss thee), I've always been on the Quest to find the best Shawarma.  But what qualifies as the best?\\n\\nFor me there are few criteria:\\n  garliciness -- a good shawarma needs a good garlic sauce (sorry ladies, no kisses for you!)\\n  toppings -- a good shawarma always has fresh, crisp veggies and purple turnips\\n  lean, crispy, evenly-cooked chicken (and preferrably Halal -- I don't know why but blessed chicken always tastes better)\\n  chicken marinate -- it needs to be tasty and not too salty\\n  consistency -- I want the same thing every time I go\\n  lack of random hairs or bits of plastic -- yeah, I've found those toppings in my shawarma before\\n  lack of extended bathroom visits the day after -- I've been told that in europe especially shawarma places are notorious for their lack of cleanliness.\\n\\nI've been going to Donair King about once a week for 3 years, and he meets all these criteria, EVERY time.  I've never had a bad chicken wrap or chicken platter.  And the owner(s) are really nice, to boot.  They are happy and upbeat 99% of the time, despite working there basically all day, every day -- I don't know how they do it!\\n\\nHowever, I would not recommend the beef donair, as I don't think it's too popular and hence winds up on the rotisserie for longer than usual and tends to dry out.\\n\\nJason D.'s review mentioned that the sauces are not made in-house -- I wonder how does he know this?  The sauces have always tasted fresh and they're atypical vis. a vis. the garlic paste/sauce, which I've never had anywhere else in Vancouver.\\n\\nI agree with Jason's comments about the Falafel King -- it is pretty good as well; I used to go there a lot (I alternated between Donair King and Falafel King, as well as Falafel House Enterprises), but got turned off by Falafel King when one day I wound up with a big lump of chicken fat in my mouth (ew!).\\n\\nAs to the other places in Vancouver?

We had made a reservation beforehand, and UNOs did a great job of setting up the private back room for us so that we would have our own space separate from the rest of the restaurant. They also did a nice job of coming up with a set menu (choice of soup or salad for appetizer, choice of entree from chicken salad, pizza, a burger, or a turkey bacon avocado sandwich, and a choice of apple crisp or brownie for dessert). Since I wasn't the organizer in charge, I'm not sure how much it was per person, so I can't speak to the cost-effectiveness of this setup.\\n\\nOverall, I was happy with the service. My water was refilled multiple times, and the kitchen was able to serve 50 people three courses in about 1.5 hours, which was pretty impressive. Unfortunately the food felt a little mass-produced. I ordered a burger medium-well with honey mustard on the side. My burger came out basically rare - it was so red on the inside that I ended up only eating the outside because I was afraid I would get food-poisoning from the undercooked meat. Every other burger that I saw was also that rare. In addition, there was no honey mustard on the side. Lastly, the number of fries that I got was pretty measly compared to what my neighbors got - I expect they were rushing the food out towards the end and it resulted in some pretty uneven distributions of food. I really love UNOs fries - they are perfectly fried, crispy, and salty! - so I was sad I didn't get more. \\n\\nThe mini-brownie I had for dessert was okay, but again didn't live up to their regular brownie for dessert. Since they had so many orders the brownie wasn't warm like they usually are when you order from the regular restaurant menu. I guess moral of the story is 1) don't be picky when part of a large group, and 2) dining with large groups does noticeably affect the quality of the food. Still, props to UNOs for the service and hosting such a large group!"},{"name":"China Pacific","address":"107 Ranch Rd 620 S","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"Meh.

The back room has some pretty fab couches and lounges alongside plush carpeting (the kind that just begs you to get barefoot for), a decorative fireplace, well-edited artwork, and the overall feel of a well-heeled friend's \\"home decor\\" Pinterest. The front rooms are more traditionally lounge-like, while the back room, with its own tiny bar and muted ambiance, is like hanging out in a Raymond Goins catalog. \\n\\nThe place is pretty happening, but people seemed to cluster in tiny pockets around the lounges, rearranging furniture to form small clumps of well-dressed but not formal urbanites, and the noise level was comfortably conversational. Service was quite good, with a couple of cocktail servers making the rounds like party hosts, popping up silently at your elbow to take a drink order, wipe a spill, or place a bowl of (thebestthingever) curried popcorn on your table for nibbling. The bartenders do take a bit of time with your drinks, so it would be wise to order #2 (or #3, or #12) while still working on #1. \\n\\nThe drinks are really the star here, of Jolie stature, quality, and price tag. A request for an Aviation was met first with a classic version with just the right amount of creme de violette and the subtlest sour-lemon twinge, and secondly with a \\"modern\\" interpretation whose ingredients I fail to remember but was sweeter, stronger, and slightly more opaque. This was followed by a pretty fabulous Belle du Jour (pink but not embarrassing, with cognac, benedictine, and sparkling something), then a Fernet straight up, and then a nap in the cab. \\n\\nMy drinks were $13-16 each, making this place more \\"special occasion\\" than \\"local joint,\\" although, for all its glam trappings, it's pretty unfussy."},{"name":"Hawkers Asian Street Food","address":"1103 Mills Ave N","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Came on a date with someone at there recommendation.

I've tried the meatball, the chicken parm, the BSB (cheesesteak) and the italian hoagie. I'd say that the ingredients in the sandwich are great, tasty meatballs, good marinara, like the cabbage and peppers on the italian. \\n\\nWhat I don't like, and what I don't understand is A) the bread which is way too tough on the italian and leads to a constant battle of trying to keep the toppings inside the sammich and not on your plate, and B) the greasiness of the cooked sandwiches seems excessive. \\n\\nI'm a sandwich freak and nothing floats my boat like a good italian hoagie. How they could spend so much time and effort sourcing the excellent selection of meats, peppers, ripe tomatoes and cabbage instead of lettuce(I'm guessing so it doesn't go all limp with the brine of the olives and peppers) and then decide to trip on the final hurdle by putting it all inside a delicious, but far too sturdy baguette just leaves me puzzled. As far as I'm concerned a truly great sandwich is a joy to eat, and while some slidage is acceptable especially with such slippery ingredients as the Italians usually have, this one transcends slidage and moves into constant ejection territory. It's simply not my favorite thing to be constantly reassembling my sandwich or to be eating the toppings separately from the bread. May not be a big deal to everybody, but to me it's a flaw that's easily fixed.\\n\\nSecond, the cooked sandwiches are just too dang greasy. I'm not averse to grease and I think I can handle more than a lot of people, but the cheesesteak may be the greasiest I've ever had. I don't understand why it's this way, and don't see why it's necessary. I've made plenty of cheesesteaks and I can say without a doubt it's not grease from the meat, it's from too much oil. \\n\\nSo all of this leaves me thinking about this place being somewhere to visit occasionally, but usually not as a first choice. In SE alone, Bunk, the Woodsman, and even the Slingshot get my money for an Italian hoagie first. If they work on their design and execution then I'd be happy to put them up there with the rest of the best, but for me right now, they just haven't made it yet."},{"name":"Shut Up and Eat","address":"3848 SE Gladstone St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"The best subs you can get in PDX.

We had reservations at 7 and at 8:30, we were searching for the server to ask where our dinners were...when they did come, my husband's steak was undercooked, he sent it back and when it came back, did not look any better. The manager came over and suggested salmon that he could deliver quickly. It was my husband's third night of restaurant salmon and it was actually the worst tasting. Our evening was totally ruined since dealing with all these issues definitely takes away from the celebration. They brought out 3 ice cream desserts that were ice cream based, so we couldn't take them home...the manager did comp my husband's meal, but we felt that was the least he could do. As a marketing professional, I really thought they would have given us some incentive to return. We have no reason to do that now, especially since we have found several superior spots to eat and they were not nearly as expensive. I've been wanting to go to Canoe for years and was very excited when I learned that was where we were going...Beautiful place, but shocked to have had this experience. I really expected much more and so did my husband. He felt terrible for me. I have shared this with many friends and they were equally surprised. I really wish they would have lived up to our expectations, which were fair, and done better to apologize and compensate us better for falling so short of their supposed high quality reputation.

More on that later.\\n\\nThe voucher set-up was quite good in that we were not restricted in choices of dishes. We could each choose any first course and any main course. I ordered the seared scallops and arctic char and we shared a bottle of Mission Hills Shiraz. The meal started out with some warm rolls and the meal was perfectly paced from there. The scallops came with a cauliflower risotto which is something that I'd love to replicate at home--instead of arborio rice, it was composed of cauliflower pieces but was still creamy. The arctic char was very nice, with perfectly crispy skin, a good portion of vegetables and mushrooms and the bonus! a small disc of puff pastry underneath. My friend enjoyed his beef tenderloin very much and I tasted a piece and I was somewhat envious of his choice. We capped off the night with a sticky toffee cake which was divided into two bowls for us...we substituted a second scoop of ice cream in place of the blue cheese/mascarpone.

The other members of the service team were courteous and kind as well.\\n\\nEven with exceptional service and really good food, there is a slightly impersonal, corporate atmosphere. The price point is not higher than other fine dining in Vancouver but there is a certain heart of small, local places that can't be programmed.

I'm not sure I'm describing it well enough...I enjoyed my dinner very much but I probably would not return, instead favouring a local establishment instead. If this meal and service were at a small Vancouver restaurant, this would surely be a 4 or 5-star review.

Okay, mistakes happen-- but the special was finally delivered to our table after everyone had finished (appetizers and main courses)!  We dutifully picked at it,  as we speculated on how the restaurant would handle this faux pas:  the manager coming to apologize? comping the dish, or perhaps even just the beer I'd ordered?  But nothing happened, the bill arrived, nothing comped, we paid it off and left-- annoyed and doubtful that we'd ever return.  Had the food been great, maybe.

The burger itself was ok, though any flavor VB or is completely derived from the toppings because the party itself was pretty flavorless.  It didn't seem like the patty had any seasoning whatsoever.  The real issue with this location is the service.  Both of the employees that were working the front counter were dismissive, moderately rude, and non responsive.

I had read reviews raving about the service so my expectations were high, but the service was poor by any standard. I think it's because we had a large party seated next to us, but for a $200+ dinner I'd expect them to adapt.  Took a long time to order, once we had finished appetizers the empty plates sat there until dinner came out, and our empty dinner plates were never cleared.  We had a leisurely dinner and were ready to pay at the end, but waited so long that we finally had to go find someone and ask to pay.  We had hoped to walk around outside but by the time we finally got the check and paid it was dark.

Note to anyone who travels to Orlando and stay in a resort area, there is nothing wrong with trying anything new!  That's the point of traveling, isn't it?\\n\\nI found this restaurant, and was ecstatic to find a tagine restaurant.  Was I excited?  *bleep* yeah!!\\n\\nThe atmosphere is clean, modern, almost like a sandwich/salad shop.  Nothing special.  Although there was a small collection of tiny tagines along the wall behind the register.  Cute.  It was 9 pm when we had arrived, and the place was quite full.  You will have to order and pay at the register before food arrives, like a fast food restaurant.\\n\\nThe menu was not extensive, but it was serviceable for a family of four, including two young ones.  We had ordered the lamb shank tagine, a gyro platter, a platter with four different meats, and also a chicken bastilla.  Chicken bastilla was impressive.  Much more flavourful than most bastillas I've had, also not too sweet.  Yum.  Although, I did not taste much egg in it.  No worries, the spices were on point.  The lamb shank tagine came out on a plate, with pilaf rice.  For all of you purists who prefer this with bread (like I wanted), we were told we would get bread, but were fooled.  Oh well.  No vegetables came with this, so don't expect anything to help you with the fibre department.  Extremely flavourful, otherwise.  Gyro platter looked dry, but was not.  Meat had a great mouthfeel to it, salad was fresh, rice was pilaf, and the harissa was fantastic.  Cumin, yum.  I did not get to try the platter with the four different meats, as my son was not willing to share his food.  He's like Joey, from friends.\\n\\nDrinks are bottled/canned, from the refrigerator next to the register.  I did, however, order a mint tea.  Not overly sweet like I have had in many other restaurants.\\n\\nNote: There is a tip jar next to the register, but do not tip until after the service has been provided.  Our food took 35 min (we were patient, no complaints, there were many other patrons in the restaurant who had to wait too).  We also had to request for forgotten utensils, and also ask for our already ordered tea after our meal, as that was also forgotten too.\\n\\nI'll be back  Maybe I'll actually try their merguez next time."},{"name":"Freshii","address":"24 School St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"FOOD POISONING!!!

My husband got the Py Jingo which we were told was their best seller. I don't normally like pale ales but this had a nice finish on it. We then got the Roasted Garlic Bulbs as appetizers. I had never had anything like this before and am a very picky eater. To me, the garlic was a little mushy and gross at first, but after a few bites I didn't mind.

Would have willingly waited longer for a seat in the regular dining room if presented with a choice.\\n\\nSkipped the appetizer this trip. My Caesar salad - yuck. Wilted greens, a lot of the hard white parts, and I dislike the dressing - too oily for my taste. Next came my prime rib. A bad cut, mostly bone and fat. Not trimmed well. I ordered it medium, but it was very rare. Dripping with blood and practically mooing, but the worst was the taste. There was none! It was the plainest steak I have ever had. I ended up cutting pieces of it and soaking each piece in the au jus for 5-10 minutes - only then was it at least edible. The apple walnut dessert was too full of walnuts, not enough apples - but the ice cream was good.\\n\\nThe service was good. Food was sub-par.

Everyone has always enjoyed it. Recently took a foursome and we had the fresh tomato flatbread pizza which is always a hit. But why did they take the duck confit pizza off the menu? It has been replaced with a sausage, blue cheese flatbread with a few grape halves tottering on top willy nilly. I definitely do NOT recommend it. \\"Too rich\\" was the comment from all and I think they were being much too kind. The mussels are a lovely appetizer and a great dish to soak your bread in. Chocolate torte dessert was yummy- a totally decadent chocolate experience and the creme fraiche that came with it was a huge mound of deliciousness. The Sorbets tasted canned and they were ordinary flavors like mango, raspberry and lemon. If you want a great sorbet go to Harvest restaurant in Cambridge. I used to wait tables there so I know. The lemon sorbet at Bouchee was so stringy my nephew jokingly called it saliva! What DID they do to it? We could only venture to guess. The cappucino was fairly weak and watery and I would not recommend it. BUT all that aside I will still come here and bring guests. Just be careful what you order. It is not all the same quality or attention to detail. By the way- we did have one of the most delightful waiters I have ever had. He was a hoot and sported a fake British accent to boot.

This place has a feeling of being a little higher end (the prices are, the decor is) - but the service fails to provide what I feel is due at a place like this. Secondly, the other food items leave a little to be desired. They just are pretty boring and not as delicious as they should be for the price. Finally, the seating is limited and they don't do a good job of helping the waiting people to get a seat. We waited forever one night because the girl thought we were just going to sit at the bar, even though we told her we wanted the next table and proceeded to the bar (normal behavior in my opinion). Also, the picnic tables outside are VERY uncomfortable. Very. And again, for the price, I'd like seats that don't hurt after 3 minutes.\\n\\nOne Saturday we got 1/2 off bubbles. That was awesome. But still not awesome enough to overcome the other issues. I'm still planning to go there about once a week/ every other week... but I wish that it made me want to come there FOR SURE once a week. :) Simplicity, if you aren't going to eat, is actually better. The food is not good at all at Simplicity, but the service and wine selections are great."},{"name":"Wayne's Smoke Shack","address":"406 Center Dr","city":"Superior","stars":"4.5","text":"Went in around 2 PM for the first time.

Boy was I wrong. I've been her once to sit-in with my family and once as a carry-out, both times being treated like garbage. The guy at the front who led us to our table was outright sexist and racist towards my family and I, and the actual waiter himself was slow and got 3 out of the 5 orders we had gotten that day wrong. We had put that behind us as to enjoy the rest of our day though. Today, I decided to get carryout for my friend and I and, again, I was treated to horrible service. Not only was our order wrong, we actually had to go back to the store to get the rest of our items, but the food was undercooked and cold, even though we had gotten there on time to pick it up. The manager offered nothing in return for our fairly bad service and felt like she just wanted to get us out of there as quick as possible. I loved the food at Max & Erma's and they are closing the majority of locations near me, so this is one of the few that are left.

I had just landed in Atlanta and was in the general area looking for a place to pick up lunch with my parents. Based on a search of the area on Yelp I decided (with their approval) that we should choose Varuni Napoli. \\n\\nParking, as others have said, is challenging at Krog Street Market, so my Mom and I went in while my Dad circled and eventually scored one of the 20-minute parking spots. Based on the side we entered from, Varuni Napoli was at the far-side of the market, but we kept our eyes on the prize and rounded the corner to the blue oven and open kitchen area with pizza prep happening right before our eyes. The staff was happy and helpful as we went to place our order.\\n\\nThe pizzas are a little larger than a personal-sized pizza, so for a party of 3 we decided we should order 2 pizzas. We went for the Bastardo ($15), which they told us was the second spiciest on the menu - it comes with fresh mozzarella, pepperoni, Nduja (this is where the spice comes in - pork sausage ragu sauce), Pecorino Romano and basil. Our other choice was the Margherita ($12) - served traditoinally with fresh mozzarella, Pecorino Romano and basil. The mozzarella was being sliced in front of us and the dough was also being prepped in front of us. The pizzas came straight from the oven right into our two to-go boxes in about 15 minutes. If you wanted to eat there, they have a counter around the entire open-air kitchen with stools for you to eat and watch them in their craft. Varuni Napoli's team makes the creation of pizza an art - and the texture, taste and freshness reminded us all of the pizzas we have tried in Naples, Italy.

But the most notable attraction - not to be missed - are the whole wheat hand-pulled noodles, made fresh to order right before your eyes! I ordered the vegetarian chili noodles for $8 bucks and the house hot sake for $5. The meal is served with Kim Chi on the side and they will bring more, upon request.\\n\\nThe coolest thing, though, about Du Kuh Bee, aside from the yummy food, is that they keep late night hours until 1a.m. Monday - Thursday and 2a.m. on weekends; great for a late night bite, an intimate date, an after movie diner dive with friends or (as I found interesting one night) a spontaneous bachelorette party stop (because everything else had long since closed) ...obviously, a fun consideration for your next girls night out!\\n\\nThe atmosphere  is casual and laid-back, not pretentious or flashy by any means. Clearly, this is a place where people can relax and be themselves.

That's where the confluence of Du Kuh Bee's sights, sounds and smells have a feel that almost Brigadoons its patrons off to the Far East Asia itself -- if only for the duration of your meal!\\n\\nThere is a little bit of a wait, sometimes, because everything is made fresh, to order and the place is always hoppin'. However, I suggest settling any anxieties with the hot house Sake, a Tsing Tao beer chaser and a Kim Chi appetizer to tide you over until the food arrives.

We ordered the barbicoa sliders (tasty but a bit dry), blue crab dip (excellent), and calamari.  I opted for the Fat Jack Burger without the jala mayo since to me mayo is a sandwich killer.  Anyway the burger was huge, perfectly done (med rare), and juicy.  It was smothered in cheddar with a few big, crisp strips of bacon and a gigantic bun with hickory sauce.  The russet fries were a perfect side to this wonderful burger.  My friend got the chicken fried beef ribs and loved every bite.  For dessert we got the chocolate bombe.

Just because it came out of a wood oven doesn't make it good. The portion was alright, but not for what they asked for it. It's equivalent to poorly made homemade pizza.

Their pasta was overcooked. It's pasta... What chef overcooks pasta? It's one of the easiest things to prepare... The fish was inconsistly cooked as well and while some pieces were cooked just right, others were overdone. The sandwich was nothing special, and you could get more for your money if you were to walk across the parking lot to Subway.\\n\\nThe service is characterized at best by well meaning unorganized servers. There were between four and five people walking around the bar area, yet it took the bartender/server fifteen minutes to come take our order even though the restaurant was half full.

He was very knowledgeable about the menu, but his foreign accent was extremely hard to understand and he acted very perturbed toward us because we had to keep asking him to repeat himself. Without going into every little detail throughout the night, let me sum it up. Service was extremely slow and even though we were somewhat expecting that considering the crowd, it was mediocre at best. Waiter was mostly rude, never smiled once, and made us feel like we were undeserving of his attention. Water guys actually poured water on top of my wife's wine two different times! How does that happen twice? Appetizers were amazing! 3 of the 4 entrees were amazing, but 1(chicken paillard) was just okay. Desserts were incredible, especially the creme brulee.

So we walked out, but first spoke to the hostess who said \\"We didn't have a table for six. Four was all we have at that time.\\" I wanted to laugh, but was too astonished by the response.

We arrive a little after 8.  Guy tells us it will be a 20-25 minute wait.  Alright.  That's fine with us.  My boyfriend grabs a beer from the bar and we hang out relatively close to the hostess stand. \\n\\nAfter waiting, I start thinking \\"Man it feels like its been longer than 20 minutes\\" and I look at the time and it is 9 o clock.

He is told by a girl \\"I'll go find you guys a table.\\"  No apology.  No explanation as to why we were waiting so long.  Nothing.\\n\\nSo she walks us to the back behind the bar where all the tables are and 1/2 of the tables are freaking empty.  So why were we waiting for 45 minutes?\\n\\nSo at this point, I'm fuming and can barely even concentrate on the menu, but I pull it together to find something to order.  I order the Chicken Pot Pie and my boyfriend gets the Shepherds Pie.\\n\\nThe food comes out relatively fast, or at least it seemed that way compared to the time we were waiting for a table.  Well lets just say that the food did not save my mood.  My Chicken Pot Pie (though I'm not even sure I could appropriately call it a pot pie) was absolutely horrible.  It was basically a bowl of gravy and peas, with about 5 chunks of chicken, and 2 chunks of carrot, and then a piece of flakey bread resting on top.  My boyfriend's Shepherds Pie was simply okay.  It was more edible than my pot pie, but we wouldn't have a desire to ever eat it again.\\n\\nThe table service wasn't the best either.  I don't think our waitress stuck around at our table longer than 2 seconds at a time, most of the time she just dropped something off AS she was walking.  \\n\\nI will never step foot back into this place again, and whenever I hear anyone talking about it, I will advise them not to go here either.

It came out blazing hot and a little spicy too.  It was a thinner version than I have had elsewhere, and while my brain wondered where the chunks were, my tongue was very happy with the taste.\\n\\nFor my main course, I ordered the lamb curry and kadai chicken, both with medium spice.  Both were done perfectly.  The lamb had a fairly typically flavored curry sauce with mild-medium spice.  The chicken's sauce had some green and red peppers and a little more heat.  The green pepper really added a nice fresh flavor.  After scooping up a bite of lamb,  I was sure that was my favorite, but then I would have a bite of the chicken and think that was better... until I had another bite of the lamb.  The entrees came with basmati rice and naan, both of which were very good.  The naan was very fresh and fluffy.\\n\\nIf you like Indian food, you definitely need to head to Maanas.

Hence the name of the restaurant, just grab and go!  \\n\\nI ordered a lamb gyro with all the toppings and a small greek salad.  I probably would have just ordered the gyro but credit card purchases must be a minimum of $10.00, the gyro was $7.00.  Even though it was busy with people in line and people waiting for their food, my food was ready in less than 5 minutes!  I took it home with me and my house is about 8 minutes away from Nick's.   \\n\\nI ate it in... minutes!  The lamb was wonderfully seasoned in the typical Greek fashion -- it was even a bit zestier than I am used to but I thought it was still very tasty.  The normal toppings lettuce, onions and tomato in the wrap were fresh and a nice compliment with the lamb.  The tzatziki was the best part;  I am glad I ordered an extra.  It was a bit more lemony than I am used too but I loved how it complimented the zestiness of the gyro.  \\n\\nThe greek salad was nothing too special, iceberg lettuce, tomato, feta, cucumber, kalamata olives and a banana pepper!

I love how it is not too sweet and not too milky compared to other bubble tea shops that I've been to. I haven't tried other drinks yet so I can't say much. For now, I am just really obsessed with their milk teas and highly recommend it for those who are sick of overly-sweet powdered milk teas. 3) They have legit snacks and sandwiches. Having actual food gives customers more reason to sit and chill at the shop. Most bubble tea shops barely have any food that is worth eating so all you do is get bubble tea and leave.

First of all, I would have to agree that there is a wait for food here.  Me and my boyfriend got there at around 6:45pm, and we didn't leave until almost 10; but we had no complaints about the whole experience there.  You have to understand that this is Keisiki style Japanese cuisine here, and you are not supposed to be rushed from start to finish.  They have put in a lot of thoughts in terms of how dishes are supposed to come out so that there is some sort of harmony involved(such as hot food or fried food first, then sashimi, then sushi, etc); and unlike all the other Japanese restaurants in town that bring you all the food at about the same time, this is a nice change, and we surely appreciated that.  The variety of choices is amazing, and even some of the items that we have desired were not available, we were still happy with the rest of our choices.  This is definitely not the place you want to go if you are in a rush, and think about it, would you like to spend a little quiet moment in your hectic day, to sip a little cold sake, and appreciate a style of Japanese cuisine that is prepared for you with a lot of hearts and souls?  To us food is not about grab and go, and Shiki was able to bring us the taste and experience that we haven't been able to have anywhere else in Boston.  It was so good that we are thinking about going back there again this week.

If I'm there Monday through Saturday, I order the BLT which is the most delicious vegetarian sausage I've ever had, comprised of crushed and sun-dried tomatoes, cheese curds, smoked shitake mushroom bacon, and a garlic aioli that is phenomenal!  With 106 beers on tap, ciders, wine, kombucha, and cold brew on tap as well, Banger's has something for everyone to drink.\\n\\nOn Sundays from 10-4, Banger's hosts one of the better brunches I've experienced with a talented big band performing originals and fun covers of popular music.  Just make sure you get there early, as there is usually a line by 10 already, and the wait can be quite long (but worth it!) especially when the weather is nice.  I always choose the vegetarian Banger's Benny which I highly recommend!  The vegetarian version of this delicious dish swaps the pork belly for fresh tomatoes and avocados, and the chipotle dusted shoestring potatoes are literally to die for.  Of course, no Sunday brunch is complete without booze!  The infamous $10 Manmosa serves up 1 liter of champagne with a splash of your choice of orange or cranberry juice in a hefty glass mug.  I'm not sure how some of you manage to knock back a full Manmosa on your own, but the good news is, they are easily shareable for lightweights like me!  The staff is even happy to provide you with individual glasses to make splitting the beverage as easy as possible.\\n\\nI have been to Banger's at least 10 times, and I've only had one ill experience.  One afternoon, I ordered a sour beer at the suggestion of my server when the brew I initially requested was sold out.  A different server brought me 1/3 of a beer and said, \\"Sorry, we blew the keg, so this is all you get!\\"  No problem, I'm hard to upset.

I loved their pizzas and specials.  I live north now and I rarely get an excuse to go.  I took my 2.5 yr old to a toy store nearby and decided last minute to stop in at Hang Town and treat him to lunch.  When ordering, I asked the cashier if the chicken tenders were really battered.

She told me, \\"no, not as much as some places.\\"  So, I ordered the chicken tenders and tater tots along with a milk.  The chicken came out super battered and hard - so much so that he didn't really even eat it.  I later discovered that I was charged $1.65 for a TINY cup of milk.  Apparently, milk isn't included as a kids drink on the kids menu!  (I guess I'm supposed to give him soda!)  Not only was the cup small, but I had to use a regular size straw which made it very challenging for my son to drink out of.  He spilled most of it on his shirt. I approached the cashier later and asked why I was charged for a kids drink, she said milk wasn't included.  I told her, \\"I wish you would've told me that.\\"  Instead of apologizing, she said she could get me a bigger cup of milk.  No thank you.  It's one thing for the food to suck, but another thing for the staff to be unhelpful or apologetic.  I will not be going back.

Wine, friends, and good food after a long weekend? Oh yes. I started with the house salad, which was divine--mixed greens, spiced pecans, poached pears, and a gorgonzola vinaigrette. What I loved was that the dressing lightly coated the salad, not overpowering the flavors and freshness of the salad. My date ordered the bacon-wrapped shrimp, for which the only word I can think is succulent. This time I went with the Wagyu short ribs with mashed potatoes and green beans, and LOVED it. It was tender, filling, and rich.\\n\\nI was a tad disappointed in my dessert--bourbon chocolate bread pudding, which was part of the reason I returned!--since it was very subtle on the bourbon and chocolate parts, but all in all it was a really great meal. I am continually impressed by the quality of food and service at G. Michael's.\\n\\nA couple of other things...\\n- Monday night is prix fixe night ($30) at G. Michael's, if you're looking for an opportune time to go\\n- The wine list is really standout with a good variety of prices\\n- The bread basket is one of the best I've had here, and could definitely compete with Rigsby's wonderful bread baskets"},{"name":"The Arlington Cafe","address":"475 Summer St","city":"Arlington","stars":"3","text":"I would have gladly given the Arlington Cafe a 4 or even 5 stars, because the food is really amazing.

Cool atmosphere and lots of beers on tap so we ordered some in bar and took out to outside patio. Soon after we were asked to leave our table because we had not ordered from patio waitress.  Our family was forced to go to a standup table with no chairs because we were supposedly taking up space in an empty patio.  We were planning on ordering another round, but treated like second class citizens.  I own a national environmental consulting company and tried to reason with a hostess with no common or business sense who was extremely rude.  Her stance was because we had not ordered from patio waitress, but still had purchased from the bar, that we were not allowed to sit in patio section.  I asked her \\"if we ordered another round, which we intended to do so, if we could have stayed in our table\\", she said yes but she didn't have any reasoning skills and referred to a manager, who was a decent guy who tried to work through a poor situation.  \\nThe bottom line is it is a cool place, but doesn't understand how to treat customers, and really embarrassed our family and soured our view of Austin.

There are a ton of other cocktails worth trying, including their Pisco sour.  The cocktails have the originality of Holeman & Finch, but without being completely inaccessible (H&F is fantastic but do you really want to mix your rye whiskey with egg whites, root beer, basil, lemon peel, and absinthe?  Creativity at that level can be hit or miss sometimes.)\\n\\n2.  VERY GOOD FOOD--there are a few things on the menu I'd avoid, but I forget what they are.

Michael's Bistro & Bar","address":"595 S 3rd St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4.5","text":"First, the background:\\n\\nI lived in Columbus ages ago, and have visited a few times each year ever since. But this summer I relocated here fulltime for work, and so am \\"re-discovering\\" much of the eating & drinking scene. In about ten weeks, I have already tried over two dozen spots. \\n\\nWe had a reservation at G. Michael's Bistro, and arrived early after a somewhat disappointing cocktail hour at another local spot. The restaurant was full (always a good sign) and no seats at the bar, but after a few minutes a couple got up to leave, so we sat down for another round.\\n\\nThe bartender was friendly and knowledgeable. One of our party is a chef, and was interested to hear a bit of background on Chef Tetzloff. The cocktail menu has some interesting selections, that were relatively well-done with noteworthy touches such as freshly-muddled ginger, but overall not \\"wow\\" caliber.\\n\\nOur table was ready right on-time, and it is worth noting that the dining room is on the small side, so reservations are probably always going to be a good idea.\\n\\nThe wine list was nice, although (as others have noted) the by-the-glass selections are limited. Fortunately our chef companion just loves Kim Crawford Sauvignon Blanc, so she was very happy.\\n\\nWe ordered three starters to share around our three diners, which was our first mistake. This is not a negative, but a warning: the portions at G Michael's are *very* generous! In particular, the shrimp & grits is entree-sized.\\n\\nThat dish, with andouille sausage was tasty. The tomato-scallion broth was well-done. Shrimp & grits has become such a trend, but is most often flavorless and forgettable. I would give this version 3-out-of-5. It was well-executed and tasted fine, but if you want a truly amazing take on this standard, try the starter at Hubbard Grille (Short North). I know some would quibble that with the addition of braised short ribs it is barely \\"shrimp & grits\\" anymore ... but oh, my, is it tasty!\\n\\nWe also had the roasted Granny Smith apple with Maytag-fig stuffing, and the 'Knife and Fork Crostini' with pulled braised beef shank. Both of these were good as well. The roasted apple being mostly noteworty for it's uniqueness. The crostini was tasty, but served a bit lukewarm. Overall, the starters were solid, but nothing that really blew us away.\\n\\nFor dinner we chose three entrees (yes, more trouble ahead with the large portions!).\\n\\nI selected the Chicken Fried Rabbit Legs with Dijon mashers, spinach, thyme cream sauce, and Vidalia jam. I am a sucker for rabbit dishes, and this did NOT disappoint. Goes on my list of WOW dishes since returning to Columbus, which - I might add - only holds three items at the moment. \\n\\nThe breading on the rabbit was crispy, the meat was flavorful and tender, amd the mash & accompanying cream sauce were delightfully paired. The Vidalia \\"jam\\" just seemed like \\"pickled onions\\" to me, but I won't nitpick the description because it all tasted so good! Did I mention the portion was *VERY* generous?\\n\\nOur chef ordered the Bacon-wrapped Pork Tenderloin with sweet potato, smoked onion, maytag, and grilled summer squash hash, Bulleit Rye and jalapeno reduction, and sweet savory slaw. It, too, had a wonderful flavor, and the smoky flavor of the hash - while it might have been overpowering had it filled the entire plate - was a nice counterpoint to the rest of the dish. She felt the pork might have been a tad overcooked, but mostly was happy with her entree.\\n\\nOur thrid guest enjoyed the grilled Lake Erie Walleye with fried grit cake. We all enjoyed the Moroccan flavors of the ras al hanout compound butter. The fish was well-cooked, and had a nice flavor. Again ... a very generous portion.\\n\\nNeedless to say, we were all way too stuffed to even think about dessert. None of us finished our entrees! This is hardly a knock, since it is rare to find such portions in a restaurant of this caliber. Next time, we will either skip starters or share entrees.

We were there on a Thursday night, so the restaurant was on the empty side, making for a romantic, calm atmosphere.  \\n\\nStarted out the meal a bit on the wrong foot by ordering a half bottle of their pg that tasted like the bottle it came from had been open for a while.  To be fair the waitress was great in recommending another wine (which was wonderful!) and replacing it right away.  I felt a little bad returning wine at such a classy place, but I was glad I did. \\n\\nWe started out with oysters on the half shell with their cucumber champagne mignonette and their signature house smoked salmon.  The portions were huge...probably meant to share, hehe but it was my birthday dinner!  When I eat oysters I'm a cocktail sauce and cracker gal, but I really enjoyed this preparation.  The mignonette was unique and there was a kick to it that I enjoyed.  However, the salmon was the clear winner here.  So delicious!  The waitress gave a whole spiel on how they smoke the salmon, I was half listening but now I wish I paid more attention!  The goat cheese and crispy potato cake were the perfect additions to the star salmon.\\n\\nFor the main course had their signature rabbit dish and the pheasant.  Both very good.  The bacon ravioli and garlic sauce that the rabbit was on top of were my favorite parts of the dish.  I was guilty of making yummy noises.  The pheasant dish featured roasted pheasant along with a croquette...I preferred the later, but everything on the plate was good.\\n\\nFor dessert I went with their creme brulee trio because it's my favorite.  I should have listened to the waitress and tried their signature popcorn ice cream sundae though, because the creme brulee was only so-so.  Not the best way to end the meal.\\n\\nOverall verdict: the food and service were both very good, but Canoe is a bit out in the boonies for us, and with so many excellent options in ATL I'm not sure it will be top of my list for a trip back.

I had the Asian noodles with tofu.  I really liked the tofu and the noodles were fine, I wish it was a little more saucy.  tasted a little bland to me.  Also, we were directly under a red light, which glowed and didn't really do any favors for the look of the food.  I'm sure they could create the ambience they are going for without such extreme darkness with colored lights.  \\n\\nNo problem with the service, or the bartender.  there might have been 2-3 other tables, and it wasn't slow, but it wasn't superb.  I would imagine that it would have been slow had there been more people.  \\n\\nWe may go back, and perhaps we didn't order well.

When we went back this afternoon, they served fries with cheddar cheese and gravy and called it poutine, which was very disappointing.  Their \\"poutine\\" was super salty, but not terrible, just more like cheddar fries with cold gravy poured over them.  Also ordered the meatloaf sliders, which were seasoned well, but on a dry bun so the texture resembled cardboard on a bun, with a coating of sticky tasteless swiss cheese.  We also tried the short rib perogie, which sounded wonderful, but did not deliver because it was drowning in it's own grease and somehow managed to have zero flavor.  \\n\\nPlus we came in about 10 minutes before \\"dinner\\" and were only given a very limited happy hour menu.  The service was inattentive, and we sat for at least 30 minutes after we finished our meals with empty water glasses and plates that need to be cleared.  For the price, they should deliver at least good service.  We will not be going back."},{"name":"Madras Pavilion","address":"9025 Research Blvd, Ste 100","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Ordered delivery from this place. It took well over an hour to get to me. Okay, fine, whatever.\\n\\nI got the naan, the appetizer sampler and the chana masala. Naan was good. The appetizer sampler was nice. Samosa, medhu vada and some other stuff. Of course, it was all pretty soggy, but that's what happens when you get stuff like that delivered.\\n\\nThe chana masala was bad though. If Chef Boyardee made Indian food, this is what it would taste like. Just bland and mucky. Chana masala is my go-to Indian dish, and I couldn't finish this. I just threw it away."},{"name":"B2 Cafe","address":"5930 Reg Bug Lake Rd","city":"Winter Springs","stars":"3.5","text":"B2Cafe is a nice quiet place to have a quick good reasonably price meal. Friendly staff, clean environment, good TV viewing if you need to keep up with the news or sports, Free WIFI, great salads and soups. Frequent buyers get a free meal after 9 meals. All in all beats the fast foods around it and a nice atmosphere too!"},{"name":"Bukowski Tavern","address":"1281 Cambridge St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3","text":"99 bottles of beer on the wall. That, to me, is about all they have to offer. This is not a place for large groups on a weekend. There is little seating. The service most definitely leaves something to be desired. Apparently the staff thinks they are too cool for school. And too cool to be nice to their paying customers. The music is absolutely horrible. The last time we went there they were playing the Pure Funk CD that used to be sold on t.v. in the late 90's. Over and over again. OH, and forget being able to talk to your friends because the music is way too loud! (Am I starting to sound like my mom?) The food is actually okay. It's also nearly impossible to find parking unless you don't mind getting a $40 ticket from the city of Somerville for parking in the residential neighborhood behind the bar. And to top it all off, it's CASH ONLY.
