Part way thru eating friend found a hair in her food(eww) upon telling the server, new ones were made. The nachos were not taken off of friends bill though, this should be a no-brainer... it's a hair, not like they were cold or something, not hygienic at all.

I hope we didn't ingest any hair.\\n\\nAlmost right after being served our nachos I was trying to get our servers attention so I could get a side of their taco/salsa type sauce, they chips didn't have too much. By the time I got her attention(it was busy) we had eaten maybe half our nachos but I got my sauce, they billed me $2 for this but I couldn't really use it all because I didn't get it until half way thru my meal.

Perhaps.\\n\\nThe pho here is decent, very much like what you'd find at any Vietnamese joint in a major city. The meat is plentiful but not always of the highest quality and occasionally very tough. The chicken curry \\"pho\\" leaves a lot to be desired: it is essentially chicken broth with some curry powder dumped in, with very little complexity or spice. I find that at Pho Pasteur, the condiments are your friends and you should use them as a celebutante uses hers: near abusively.\\n\\nThe appetizers are standard and tasty, the usual array of spring rolls and teriyaki. A \\"banh xeo,\\" Vietnamese pancake, was really good, a sort of double-fried scallion pie heaped with baby shrimp and tons of mint and served with fish sauce.\\n\\nThe vermicelli (\\"bun\\") dishes are all fairly standard; again, you'll want to employ that siracha. A hot pot with sliced pork delivered on its promises of heat. A big clay pot of meat is always welcome but the dish could have used something vegetal to cut through all the fatty unctuousness. Vegetables here can seem stir-fried into oblivion.\\n\\nIn short, food is standard, not quite to a fault. Better Vietnamese places exist in town but Pho Pasteur will serve you well if you're in the Chinatown area, or if you need a pre-Centrefolds nosh (you can see the strip club from the front windows.)\\n\\nHowever, the service is pretty hostile sometimes. Be ready to order within minutes of being seated, or risk a Category Five death glare.

I came here on a Saturday night at about 11:30 or so and it was packed even with the $5 cover at the door. \\n\\nThe ambiance of the place was pretty cool, loved the decoration and just how the bar was set up. But even with a very large bar and about 4 bartenders, I waited about 10 minutes or so just to get a drink. Even then I was actually disappointed as I was craving a Grey Goose and soda, but was told that they didn't carry that vodka. Despite this, I decided to go with a cranberry vodka, but they actually took their time (which is one of the reasons why they took so long to get to me) because they measured everything out...they had all sorts of jiggers, which is cool,  but not so cool when you are waiting a long time just to order a simple drink.\\n\\nI also think that the way that they use their space during late night is not used effectively as there is an area full of tables but no one goes there as it is so tight, so that makes the main open area where the dance floor is supposed to be extremely jammed packed. Really not a good place for agoraphobics if you ask me. Also expect to be standing if you come in late as there is almost no seating available, unless you were lucky to find a seat at the bar. \\n\\nOne thing that I did like was their DJ as they were playing a lot of retro funk music from the 70's including some disco....something that I wasn't expecting to be played at a bar, but I loved.\\n\\nOverall, this place is pretty cool... loved their drinks(but not their prices!), the music, the crowd (plenty of hipsters), and the ambiance.

Business), the only reason Jorge's is getting two stars is because of the mediocre first visit. But onto the second. \\nThree of us arrived at around 4:15 for some margaritas and happy hour food. Because of my finicky boyfriend, we had skipped past the more crowded (but probably way better) Woody's around the corner to come here. The bar was packed but the the dining room was empty besides a group of 4. The hostess, a little blonde thing (not to stereotype, I'm really sure she was hired for her stellar vocabulary) informed us, quite rudely, that the bar was open seating but she could seat us on the other side. Having two hungry man-children with me, we opted to just take the dining room. I wish we had looked harder in the bar. One guy came up and gave us chips and salsa. Awesome. He asked if we wanted guacamole. My friend said yes. He said something else which none of us could really hear, and my friend said ok (so our bad. I'll take that one). Then he was gone. Another guy came over to take our drink order, which I got a house margarita (really very good if you want a run of the mill 'rita). Then he was gone. Margarita guy came over, took our order, and we asked for chips and salsa. I then informed him we were missing the guac we had ordered from #1. He said he'd check. By this time the ravenous duo had chowed thru the first batch of chips and salsa. A third employee, a girl, came over and asked if we would like more chips and salsa. We said sure and away she went. Soon she returned with a plate of some sort of avocado/tomato mixture - no chips, no salsa. Nbd. Except we didn't want that. And had no chips to dip. When we questioned her she said \\"...oh...no!\\" So I just said I would take it and she could just bring another order of guac to my friend (who didn't want avocado, just guac. Go figure.) And away she went. Finally a fourth guy came by with some more chips and salsa, and she showed back up with some guac a few minutes after. I will say at this point it appeared to be slowly filling up, maybe half the tables were full. However there also appeared to be many more staff members arriving. \\nSo then the food arrives. Happy hour portions are small, I get it, but a little pricey for what you get. Nbd. About the time our food came, I finished my margarita. Awesome. I figure the waiter will stop by to check to make sure the busboy brought everything correctly (especially because something was incorrect and we told him about it). This is the point where I stop holding management responsible for a shitty staff as a whole and look directly to the server. He walked directly passed our table three times. Three! Made eye contact twice! And I still had to raise my voice (embarrassing for everyone involved) to ask for another one?? I already have alcoholic tendencies. The entire restaurant doesn't need to know. Oh, and the screw up on my friends order? Never resolved. He was charged and extra $4 and the avocado dip stuff I didn't want was SEVEN DOLLARS. Went out for happy hour, total bill for three people was $58. \\nBased on service alone I will stay away from here. Prices are prices, no one that works there can control that. But they are the ones who can make my dining experience awesome or crappy and it's disappointing how crappy this experience was. \\nOh, side note... When we first got there I asked the server if he had the ability to change one of the tvs to ESPN. He said \\"of course!\\" Well, by the time we left all the tvs were still on encore sports (?) and I missed Syracuse lose to NC State.

After taking a minute to summon a server, she just didn't handle it well. There was nearly an entire glass of wine on the table, and she brought a couple of napkins and a rag to clean it up. Then I had to ask her twice for new napkins for me, since I'd used mine on the spilled wine.\\n\\nHer biggest error was not asking about replenishing my wine. I knocked it over, so I'd have bought another, but she didn't ask.\\n\\nThe entree came to the table luke warm. The restaurant was not slammed, so there was no excuse, in my view, for not getting it to the table piping hot.\\n\\nSo Athens Pizza is fine if your expectations for both the food and the service are low."},{"name":"Neptune Oyster","address":"63 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Love this place.

I first fell in love with Flour when I, like many others, tried their sticky bun. When I was consulting in the city, I'd stop by the original location in the South End and get a sticky bun and sometimes their Belgian chocolate brownie on the way to work. \\n\\nNow, that I just came back, I knew I had to find the closest Flour to work and get my beloved. I don't think prices have changed for either, at $3.75 a piece. I will say I forgot that a knife and a fork would have been helpful in eating the sticky bun as it does create a bit of a sticky situation.\\n\\nI came back twice in two days and ordered sticky buns on each day. There's a great mix of pecans, honey, and dough that is so satisfying, sweet, and warm. The brownie doesn't look too impressive ever but it's got that nice soft, oozy, chocolate quality that makes you feel you are enjoying a delicious and decadent treat without overindulging gratuitously. \\n\\nBoth mornings, a friend and I came back around 8 am, and we found the lines to be moving quickly. I miss the good service from places like Flour. Everyone behind the counter was friendly, spoke clearly, and were efficient.

All the food is quite good and reasonably priced--a great, healthy and filling alternative for a quick, take-home meal when it's late or you just don't feel like cooking. And I actually did not have a bad food experience recently--I had a frustrating \\"just to get in the door\\" experience. All my previous experiences with going there and making orders in person have been fine. \\n\\nBut it was absolutely impossible for me to order on my phone last night. The rest of this review is really a long message more for the owners than any actual customers, although if you're interested in learning how to use their mobile app, head to the second to last paragraph, where I've added some pointers. (It would have made my life easier last night.) \\n\\n\\n\\nLast night, I tried to order some takeout to grab on the way home. Mind, I was only about 5 minutes away from the place; but thought it'd save time to \\"order ahead\\" on my phone. Oops, their previous app (\\"order ahead\\") doesn't work any more, and the new app (\\"caviar\\") doesn't recognize them. So I checked the website with google, and found a way to order online, instantly, from the google search page. Great! Except, if you try to go backwards, it kicks you out. Twice I had this happen, before I decided to go the browser route. Logged into their web page, and it sent me back to the same app tech. Failed on that again (it's *really* not intuitive on mobile--it took me three tries before I realized I'm supposed to click on a price, not the menu item, and the prices look exactly like every other bit of text on the page--no buttons, or anything suggesting you need to click on them), so decided \\"heck with it, I'll just call\\", and called the restaurant directly to place the order. All I got was a recording--\\"if I'm a solicitor, please hang up and remove, etc..., if you actually want food, go to the browser\\". (sigh) Tried one last time, only I went a bit further and actually downloaded their own \\"app\\". But now I have to create an account and sign in, and it asks about 8 questions trying to get even more information out of me--\\"want to get on our mailing list? Can we send you notifications? How about getting texts? Would you like to download our offline menu? Really, give us your email address!\\" (Good grief! I. Just. Want. A. Taco!) Whatever, I created an account, signed in, and tried to order. Only now, I try to order a tostada salad with chicken, the same menu item I've been ordering for a decade, but there's two places on the \\"tostada salad\\" section to add chicken. What's the difference? I'm trying to navigate this on my phone! I can't tell, and so I click the first one I see, but then think it's the wrong one. Only: once you add something to your order, YOU CAN'T REMOVE IT!!! Who designed this mobile app? By the time I'd given up, there were three salads in my order, and I couldn't figure out how to remove any of them. If you start over, your previous cart remains! After wasting 15 minutes trying to get an order in, we gave up and went somewhere else. Ironically, as we drove by their shop 5 minutes later, they were empty. \\n\\n\\nFollow up: today I tried their web page, because I wanted to find a way to contact the restaurant owners to give this feedback, but there is, literally, no way to do so. There's phone numbers, but they're the same one I called yesterday and got a very unwelcoming message. There's the same stupid food ordering technology (which actually works on a laptop, btw, and allows one to remove items, and also has text explaining how to use the technology--text that is not readily visible on mobile). And after I figured out how to use the menu on my laptop, I was able to reverse-engineer the process on mobile \\n\\n(IF YOU WANT TO ACTUALLY USE THEIR APP: it's all about clicking on the prices--that's the key link. Despite a completely non-intuitive interface, you are expected somehow to know to click on the numbers next to the menu items to get the option to add to the cart, and you're also expected to know to click on the running total on the bottom left side to get to a \\"remove\\" button. If you just go to \\"checkout\\", you have the option to \\"modify\\" your order, but when they say \\"modify\\" or \\"change order\\", what they really mean is \\"add more\\", not \\"edit an item\\".)\\n\\nIt's a long-winded review, for which I apologize. I wrote this mainly hoping the owners would read it and change their mobile experience or add some better navigation buttons or something. After almost 2 decades of eating at Pepino's, all I feel about them right now is annoyance. Without a \\"contact us\\" method on their web page, with phone recordings on their main line that say \\"please hang up\\", they seem to be a company that is doing their level best to ignore their customers."},{"name":"Darwin's","address":"1629 Cambridge St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"Although I've never been able to go there during my short lunch breaks, I've finally managed to check out Darwin's LTD with my girlfriend just days ago...

I'm impressed by this place's ability to exude both the trendy lounge and neighborhood bar vibe at the same time. My greatest impression was the attentiveness and politeness of the bar staff.

I have now been to Jam on Hawthorne twice. The first time we went mid-week at 9:00-ish for breakfast and had to wait over an hour to be seated. Our party was not happy, and in fact, they said they wouldn't return because of the wait time to be seated despite having liked their meals. The second time I came for breakfast I arrived at 8:40 on a Wednesday and was seated immediately. Our serving was very friendly and accommodated our meal substitutions readily upon request. I got the Maddie cakes and I loved them. They are these soft pancake with ricotta in the batter and topped with a warm blueberry compote. So yummy! The atmosphere is very casual. My mother in law got a scramble with just ham and cheese. Nothing really to write home about there.

Or stoned. Or if you find yourself suddenly entwined in a summer action film about rebellious youths finding themselves in the middle of the rough urban landscape. Or if you're lucky, all three. Let's see this scenario play out, shall we?*\\n\\nThe camera pauses for a moment on Javier's guacamole-green exterior: The cracked parking lot, the bits of garbage and newspapers breezing past in the cool Portland evening air. The steady red and white stream of traffic on Lombard. The cracked out guy shambling past the taqueria, his stained and threadbare tan overcoat flapping a little in the wind. \\n\\nCut to you, in your beat up red Pinto, smoking one last cigarette, nervously clutching the filter between dirty, sweaty fingers. You check your watch for perhaps the hundredth time that hour: a quarter after one a.m.. Beside you in the worn vehicle is Alice, your fiesty, moody, unpredictable partner in crime. Right now Alice is halfway through a coke binge, trying to stave off her nerves a little with a poorly-concealed bottle of Canadian whiskey. \\n\\nAlice suggests you both go inside to get something to eat and \\"figure shit out.\\" You make a derisive, wordless noise and throw your cigarette out the window, where it joins countless others that have been ground in to the pavement of Javier's parking lot over the years in similar acts.\\n\\nInside Javier's your eyes are assaulted by a barrage of scantily clad women on posters advertising about half a million retailers of pre-paid phones and phone cards. The place is barely occupied, save for a family of four near the front window, chowing down on a red plastic tray of burritos and Pepsi.\\n\\nAs the man behind the counter stares sullenly at you, silently waiting for you to order your food, alcohol-induced paranoia sets in. You stall for time by running your fingers through your hair and stare at the extensive bright yellow menu: Oregon burrito, nachos,  menudo, fried fish... the Brazilian phone card girls were one thing, this menu is a whole other beast for a drunk kid on the edge like yourself to take on. Thankfully, that's why you've got Alice.\\n\\nShe finishes reapplying her cherry red lipstick and nudges you aside while she orders a small feast for the two of you with the last of the money she stole from her parents back in Gresham. Four chicken tacos, a large order of carne asada fries and two coffees. Amazingly, she gets change back from the $15 she hands over--enough cash left to hit the 7-11 for forties later.\\n\\nThe two of you sit in an empty hard plastic booth and stare at each other, gripping your cups of coffee like rosaries. \\n\\n\\"What are we going to do?\\" You ask Alice, perhaps rhetorically. She shrugs and drinks her coffee. It's thin, translucent, bitter and tastes like it's been sitting in the pot for a week, but it's successfully killing your buzz enough to focus on thinking up a plan. It also makes you a little jumpy.\\n\\n\\"What were you thinking anyway?\\" You ask. \\"All of that trouble, for a dog?\\" Alice bristles visibly, but her response is cut off by a large tray of food set between you on the table. She settles for flipping you the bird with a little bit of stink-eye for good measure before chowing down on some serious chicken taco.\\n\\nThe carne asada fries are, to your inebriated mind, perfect. A mountain of crispy crinkle-cut fries are topped with greasy asada steak, green onions, half-melted shreds of yellow cheese, and a thick dollop of sour cream. Your troubles with Alice and the dead drug dealer you left in the gutter on NE MLK are temporarily forgotten as you drift into heaven. Greasy, carby, heaven. \\n\\n\\"You know, I think we're going to be alright,\\" says Alice as she unwraps another perfectly cooked taco.

It really wasn't necessary. It sounds exactly as described, and is done deliciously. \\n\\nPolenta & Sugo with mozzarella & over easy egg: So good. I love polenta, and the pork in the sugo was tender and richly-flavored. \\n\\nBaked Prunes with Taleggio: surprisingly delicious combination, served with toast, I'll be trying this one at home. \\n\\nTasso Hash with onion sour cream & over easy egg: Tasso, as in, Tasso Ham. In general, I really like hashes, and this was no anomaly. And I don't always like ham. Runny egg over crispy-tender pieces of potato and ham just sounds like a winner, no? \\n\\nCast Iron Frittata with asparagus, roasted red peppers, caramelized onions, provolone & torn basil: I was so impressed with how light this was. Usually, I think of frittatas as quiches without the crust, but this one was texturally fluffy, and still had a good amount of fillings. A real treat. \\n\\nDuck...Duck....Steak! : This was my contribution to the family-style brunch. It's skirt steak (really tender and flavorful, cooked medium rare) seared in duck fat, with duck fat potatoes. Um, YUM.

We had ordered the chorizo omelette, but they brought out the polenta instead. We didn't mind, and weren't even going to bring it up, but our waitress noticed the error. She then asked if we wanted the omelette, so we said, \\"sure, why not?\\" (Note, I did mention mild discomfort, and complete unnecessity.) At the end of the meal, she notified us that she had removed BOTH the polenta and the omelette off our tab. Needless to say, we left her a great tip.

My cocktail was OK, but not knock-your-socks off like my two cocktails at Andina. We were served four ordinary slices of sourdough and oil and were not offered more bread. Our appetizers were on the puny side. My $9 salad consisted of leaves and a not terribly flavorful dressing -- nothing more. I ordered the Pasta Della Casa, which that day featured a rigatoni with pork in an arugula-based sauce. It was soupy, and the pasta was just a little too chewy.

I had heard really great things about Bondir so we decided it'd be a lovely spot to come for a quiet dinner on New Years Eve. The restaurant itself is adorable - very small, but (as others have noted) the fireplace is a great addition and makes it a really cozy place (especially in the winter - not sure if this translates in the summer).  Additionally, the wine list was great and we ended up ordering a really delicious bottle. \\n\\nThe food, however, left a lot to be desired. For starters, we got 3 slices of their homemade bread - 9 grain, raisin with hops, and squid ink bread. Honestly, only the 9 grain was good. The raisin with hops was edible, but.. the hops made it just kind of taste like it had gone bad, neither of us liked it. also, we're vegetarian, so the squid ink bread was out. Disappointment #1. Again, we are vegetarians, so obviously this means that we generally miss out on a lot of things on the menu, however most restaurants make sure to have substantial vegetarian options, so I normally dont think twice about going  out to eat.  For our first course we got a vegetable consomme (I believe), which was a tiny bowl of soup that consisted of some beets and parsnips. It was good - nothing to rave about, but good nonetheless. Second course was a black walnut tart - the tart itself was delicious (but TINY - as in, 2 bites) and was accompanied by some weird textured strips of.. something. I dont know what. They should leave a menu on the table so you know what you're eating (this was something I thought of several times throughout the meal because there were a lot of.. strange elements for each course). That was disappointment #2. That accompaniment was just not good. It was left on our plates. The third course (main course) was a beet dish. Granted, it was the vegetarian option, but.. vegetarians like to eat too. This dish had zero substance. It had a half of a beet, approximately 1.5 tablespoons of some grain, 2 or 3 leaves of green garnish and some foam. Seriously. And, as a beet lover, I may have been OK with it if the flavors had been fantastic. But, they just werent. The grain was good, but the beet tasted funky. Huge disappointment. I understand that this is a multiple course meal, but giving one half of a beet as an entree was just poor form. Finally, the dessert. I ordered the chocolate semifreddo. The chocolate semifreddo itself was delicious. Really really tasty. But the squash jelly accompaniment? And whatever other white pudding type thing was on my plate? Not good. At all.  Also got left on the plate. When (out of 5 courses, if we include the \\"bread course\\"), 3 courses are not fully eaten, something is wrong. And its clearly not because we were too full. On the contrary.\\n\\nAnyway, my main gripe is that the prix fix menu seemed so much more limited than the sample menus that they post. I wish they would have told us when we made the reservation that it'd be so different, because had I known that the NYE prix fix would be such a radical departure from their regular menu I probably would've steered clear and opted to come on a regular night. I still think that the regular menus (from the samples I've seen online) look as though they could be delicious.. (in particular their pastas look good, but that wasnt an option on NYE) but the New Years Eve menu was just not. I think they tried to get too adventurous, rather than focusing on providing tasty (and, come on, a bit more substantial) food.

There were maybe 3 or 4 tables seated. We got seated right away but the service after that was SLOOOOW.  I ordered a make-your-own scramble, which was pretty tasty. but the hashbrowns were just a buttery mess, not even crisp. The toast...well...was just a barely warmed piece of bread, no butter. My friend got the corned beef hash, which he said was pretty good but only got like three pieces of corned beef in the entire scramble. What really ruined it for me was their pineapple strawberry mimosa. It came to me in a glass that was topped with some odd looking foam. In addition, there were huge chunks of what looked like some sort of flavor powder. I gave it a chance but it tasted HORRIBLE. I left it alone and by the time I left, it all had settled and it looked like a science project with lots of \\"grit\\" at the bottom of the glass.\\n\\nNeedless to say I will not be back."},{"name":"Neptune Oyster","address":"63 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Love this place!

DO NOT have it with mayo - go the butter only. It melts in your mouth. A friend had the bbq octopus salad and just loved it. Clam chower also a hit - a bit thinner than some but delicious.

I was pretty glad went.\\n\\nI was in Austin for a week and wanted to continue my workouts even while I was on vacation, so with going on a run along the Colorado River in mind, I decided to order the Green Monster, which is a blend of broccoli, peanut butter, coconut water, banana, and spinach. Peanut butter is a great source of slow-release energy, there are plenty of electrolytes in coconut water, and banana is a staple for runners, so I thought this was a no-brainer. It tasted pretty good too, with a slightly grainy but smooth texture and peanut-buttery undertone that somehow still manages to quench your thirst.\\n\\nAfter I ordered at the window, I decided to sit at one of the tables outside. There was no one else around and the area is pretty quiet even with a busy road (South 1st Sreet) right there, so it was hard not to live in that moment and enjoy some me-time.

In my opinion, I believe The Halal Guys chain in Austin is better than the super famous cart in New York on that one street corner (no they're not the same chain as the one in NY). Most of my friends will disagree but here's my reasoning:\\n\\n- The sauce. The one in New York is the equivalent of ranch. But here in Austin their sauce is like a mayo/garlic which I find much more complex and complementary to the meat. \\n- This is an actual mini resturant, so they have a larger kitchen space than the food cart. This yields more consistency since they're not cranking out orders for long line of drunk people, or for people who make preposterously large orders to bring back to their H-town peeps (ahem, you know who you are coughROBERTANDFELIXcough)\\n- Their lamb and rice is my favorite. I watched them prepare an order. It seems like they reserve the fat drippings from the roast. Then when an order is made, they slice off the meat and pour some of the fat back into the lamb on top of the grill. I watched in awe as the lamb glistened and simmered.\\n- They char their meats perfectly. I feel like the cart including the one in NY will sometimes rush the orders so you don't get the full potentials of the meat.\\n- The combo is amazing as well, and I don't don't always care for chicken.\\n\\nAnyways, Halal Guys, if you're reading this, please come to Houston you have a huge following you just don't know!"},{"name":"Luke's Lobster Back Bay","address":"75 Exeter Street","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"a very clean and nice environment.  not a place i can frequent on the regular bc it is so expensive but it tastes great and the service is good.

However, the oysters alone makes this place worth 5 stars.\\n\\nSome quick tips:\\n-The restaurant is TEENY TINY - avoid going in a large group, or be prepared to break into smaller groups and for an extremely long wait.\\n-Wait - Try to go early. The wait can range from 2-5 hours here so prepare to get there and do something close by for a few hours while waiting.

I avoided oysters for years and years until my visit here. True story!\\n\\nNeptune Oyster was the last stop before my party head home to New York City. My party arrived here shortly before 11:00 am; just about 30 minutes before they open for business. We were first on line that day! My party ordered a variety of food such as the clam chowder, lobster roll, uni toast, and of course oysters. We also have Bellini to add a touch to our brunch experience! \\n\\nUni Toast came out first. It was two slices of hot toasted bread with a bit of uni spread and melted butter. I personally did not taste much of the uni but more so the melted butter. It was okay but wish there was more uni! Lobster Roll, you have a choice to having it hot and toasty or just normal temperature. We went for the hot version as evident as the grilled, charred marks on the bread. Lobster Roll looks a bit stingy from the lack of lobster meat but it was actually a lot of meat packed in the middle section. Pretty good but high on the price mark. Fries that came with the lobster roll was crispy and well seasoned. My party loved the hints of potato skins here and there on the fries! \\n\\nNow the highlight of our visit: the oysters! Every table was given a sheet of paper that lists the oysters that they have including the place of origin, price, and taste notes. All you need to do is write the number of pieces you want. My party went with a few popular ones such as the Island Creek, Wellfleet, Kumamoto, Hog Island, Pemaquid, and etc. Little bit of each. Oysters were served in a platter sitting on ice. Pemaquid Oyster from Damariscotta, Maine reigned as my party's favorite! Pemaquid had tasting notes of salty and citrus. My party just simply squeezed lemons without adding any additional sauces. It was freakin' AWESOME! We even ordered another dozen of Pemaquid as well afterwards! Even after the restaurant, I really could not stop thinking about the taste of it!

Oh, and get the raspberry seltzer, too. \\n\\nTheir breakfast menu is somewhat limited. If you're looking for a brunch-esque menu with a bunch of specialized egg sandwich options or something scrambled or sunny-side up with hashbrowns, this isn't your place.  Their couple of hot breakfast options are good (I've had the quiche) but the pastries are really the star. The brioche au chocolat is delicious and I haven't had the sticky bun...but just look at it. \\n\\nThe food is great and the people who work in this location are as well. I've never had a bad experience (and I think at this point, I've probably had my order taken or sandwich made by every person on their staff). \\n\\nNote: It's first come first served in terms of seating so grabbing seats at the window or at a table (especially if you're with a larger group) might be tough at peak hours; however, they run like a well-oiled machine when it comes to getting people through the line -- major plus.

That's just what lobster meat costs, folks.  It's about $50 per pound, already cooked and picked at the grocery store.  Here's the math: $18 for a 1-1/4lb lobster.  More than two-thirds of a lobster's weight is water and shell.  Don't believe me, try the experiment at home.  That nets you approximately 6.5oz raw meat.  When cooked, the weight goes down by about another third. That leaves you 4.3oz cooked lobster meat.  \\n\\nTo see what getting raped on lobster really feels like, see my review of the $36 lobster roll at the Island Creek Oyster Bar in a Burlington, MA office park.

Our waiter was very knowledgable, made some great recommendations, and wasn't absent or always present. My only quibble was that he talked so softly it was hard  to hear him! But he didn't mind repeating himself.\\n\\nBefore dinner, they presented snacks--2 things that were awesome and I can't quite remember their names. One involved a dehydrated calamata olive that had an intense, awesome flavor, Another that involved an olive oil jelly (almost like a hard jello), it wasn't something I'd ever order on my own, but really interesting and a fun play on food. Throughtout the meal they brought out fun things like that--3 types of bread, 2 types of soup (a celery soup that was so fresh and delicious, and a squash soup that was comforting and great), and tiny bites of brownie at the end of the meal.\\n\\nWe all had a different app--one had the shaved wagyu beef app, another had a roasted squash salad, I had the washed rind tarte that was just delicious. Everything was beautifully plated. My dish was definitely for strong flavored cheese lover, which I am. The crust was flaky, buttery, and awesome. And it was surrounded by roasted veg (a baby brussel sprout, radish, carrot, other delish items). It set the bar really high. My friends loved their dishes as well, with the wagyu girl really loving it.\\n\\nFor entrees, one had a steak, one had the scallops, and I had duck. They were the perfect size entree--not too big, which is nice when you're doing multiple courses. The steak was rare so specify if you'd like something else, the scallops were wonderful, and my duck was really good--it came two ways and both were cooked perfectly. Rich, but great flavor. \\n\\nWe moved on to ice cream, and had chocolate sorbet, winter citrus fro yo, and buttermilk thyme ice cream. All were delicious and creamy. \\n\\nAlso to note, one of party doesn't eat gluten, and they were more than accommodating. They even made sure to tell us which in-between dishes had gluten in them and which didn't. \\n\\nOverall, great experience!"},{"name":"Fried And True","address":"1308 E 6th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Comes down to this:  delicious,  fried, yummy, melt in your mouth madness.

I give this place about 2.5 stars. \\nHad really high hopes for Tasty N Alder. I haven't been to Tasty N Sons and was pleased to hear they were downtown. The menu looked great so finally made my way out to give it a try. I however was not impressed. \\nThe overall ambiance is neat. The seating is waaaay too close together. Lunch time was busy as I'm sure any time of day that place is busy, but when I have servers and people consistently bumping into the back of my chair it's a bit annoying. I know there's not a ton of space to work with. Also, with seating so close together it's hard as hell to hear the person in front of you. I can get over that though if the food was good. But really, it was simply MEH. \\n\\nFOOD ORDER:\\n*Toast & Jam -My initial thought was that yes, I would be getting some toast with jam on the side. To my dismay it was literally one piece of bread sliced in half. Both had cheese melted on it. One topped with apple butter and another with pineapple chutney. Not worth the $5. I should have known better. \\n*Korean Fried Chicken - tried a bite of this and overall was alright. Nothing super special. The Kimchee however was fantastic and perfectly spicy. \\n*Pork Schnitzel - Mustard cabbage. good. Pickled beets. Nah, not my thing. The pork schnitzel itself was kinda bland, a tad overcooked, and was seriously missing something...like gravy. Gravy could have saved this dish and made it 100x better. Just sayin. \\n\\nSERVICE:\\nService is friendly and professional. They deal with the crowds just fine. However, my biggest gripe is that your food for your table WILL NOT come out at the same time. There was a good 10 minutes in between one meal and the other. All the tables next to us were having the same issue. Poor guy on my right...his entire table all had food but him. It was a good 15 minutes before he got his meal. The rest of the table was pretty much finished at that point that I noticed. \\nAs it's busy be prepared for a tad slow service too. \\nTheir motto - \\"Food comes out, when it comes out...when it's ready\\" Yeah. Had I known this. I wouldn't have come. I HATE when places are like this. I'm hungry dammit! Make sure you have people with you that are OK with sharing because it could be a long ass wait between when meals come out. \\n\\nFor my food items plus a coffee the tab was $30. Not terrible. Prices are OK, but seriously worth the food nor worth the wait. I can't say that I will be returning, which is rough when the other reviews of this place make it seem so great.

With the monorail whirring by, the ambiance is decent- the only downside is if Chef Mickey's is open, there tends to be a long line and it can be weird to have hungry tourists (accompanied with their crying babies) glancing at your food. I ordered the blackened chicken flatbread, which was a decent portion for the price (11.49) and had plenty of big chunks of chicken. The chicken had good seasoning and the sauce on top was refreshing and cooled down any kind of spiciness. I also liked the greens on top, but the dough itself was kind of flimsy and thing, making the chicken fall off quite frequently. Service was fast and friendly.

The patio is very nice with couches to sit on and the option of tables as well.  Unfortunately if you show up during prime-time you are going to have trouble getting one of these popular seats and may get stuck inside.  Also catering to the locals and people coming off the beach is a shower to wash the sand off outside and a little area to tie up your dog.\\n\\nDrink menu is good - there is a nice selection to choose from and glasses of wine start at $4.  The food however is really unimpressive.  I've tried a few things off the menu and haven't really found anything I liked.\\n\\nIf you happen to be looking for a casual pub to spend your Friday night in, I don't know if Local is your place to go.  The music inside is so loud you can't have a conversation and I think it's safe to say that it's the stomping ground on weekend nights for men who worship Ed Hardy and women who spend hundreds of dollars to look like boho hippies, which personally is not my taste.\\n\\nAll in all if you were at the beach and there isn't a wait for the patio or you have guests in town looking for a nice place to enjoy a cold beer, Local is an excellent choice.

That hot and buttery lobster roll...I will most definitely dream about it tonight. Although it was $29, it was worth every single penny. If you go with a friend, I would recommend ordering one lobster roll and sharing so you can try the other entree dishes. My boyfriend and I shared the HOT LOBSTER ROLL and the FRIED CLAMS ($21-but price may vary). We were both pleasantly surprised because the portion was huge! The OYSTERS and CLAMS, of course, were delicious and fresh; however, I couldn't really taste the difference between \\"sweet butter finish\\" and \\"brown butter finish\\". I guess my palate isn't as sophisticated (oh well). My boyfriend ordered 2 shrimp cocktails (it's just two pieces of jumbo shrimp) because he's allergic to oysters and he said that they were nothing out of the ordinary. \\n\\nBe ready to drop a lot of money at this restaurant (especially if you were hangry like I was) but I think it's worth it. I will most definitely come back to try their CIOPPINO (I was low key creeping on what people around me were eating and that particular dish looked amazing). \\n\\nWe got drinks as well. The server recommended a white wine and I think that it paired well with the food that we ate. I got a BLOOD ORANGE BELLINI because I adore champagne; however, I think that I instead got a WHITE PEACH BELLINI. Nevertheless, it was fruity, bubbly, and delicious! \\n\\nTip #1: Come early (up to 15 mins before it even opens) or expect to wait a long, long, long time OR come during odd hours (after 2 and before 5). I got there at 3 on a Saturday and waited 30 minutes. They call you when you're table is ready, so you can go on a mini adventure to Faneuil Hall or sit on the swings at the nearby park while you wait.\\n\\nTip #2: Don't park at the Hard Rock Cafe garage unless you are willing to pay more than $30. The boyfriend and I parked there because it was very close to the restaurant; however, we ended up paying $36 for 2.5 hours!\\n\\nTip #3: I am a huge, huge fan of cocktail and mignonette sauce BUT I fought the temptation to dunk my oysters and clams in them because I think that they mask the freshness and the taste of them.

The only downside is that they don't really give enough meat. They gave me four pieces of chicken, and a side of rice. The vegetables were pretty tasty though. The sauces of each curry were different. The one with vegetables in it has a much lighter sauce while the one with chicken in it was thicker. Nonetheless, it was rather filling when you began eating all of the naan (bread). The naan here, depending on how it's made, ranges from burnt to really good. I came here with a group, and they gave us a huge plate of naan. The first piece tasted really burnt, but the other pieces were pretty good. The service here is okay.

As an avid devotee of Chipotle, I never thought I'd encounter a fast-casual joint that could upstage my beloved burrito chain. After some poking by some close friends and reading the reviews of some trusted Yelpers, I decided to see if JJ's was worth it.\\n\\nYou know how JJ Abrams saved the Star Trek and Star Wars franchises? JJ's Grille has saved the fast-casual dining restaurants. Not that fast-casual dining restaurants were in any trouble; I just wanted to make a Star Wars reference. ANYWAY...locally owned, JJ's offers a Chipotle-esque menu with a Lebanese fusion that works like gangbusters. The set up is like Chipotle. You pick what you want (burrito, salad, pita sandwich, etc) and choose your protein, but then here's where JJ's goes into its own territory. There are three different types of rice to choose from, you can choose between beans or lentils, you can get tabouli and or salsa, and they have a nice selection sauces ranging from hummus to red wine vinaigrette (I like the cucumber-dill sauce). All of the ingredients are super fresh and they don't look like they've been sitting out there for hours.\\n\\nThe staff is very friendly. As I was by myself for my first time here, I didn't really know what the deal was. They took the time to kindly explain all of choices and ingredients and I never felt like I was annoying them in any way. These people truly love what they're doing. Also, a nice local touch, it seems like they make a point of learning people's names. After swiping my card, the gentleman called me Peter for the rest of the transaction. I like nice little touches like that. Also, the guy in line before seemed to be a regular and they knew exactly what his order was without asking. So, it's basically the Orlando Mexican/Lebanese version of Cheers.\\n\\nSeriously, try this place out. The location may be further away than your nearest Chipotle, but it's worth it. The prices are about the same as Chipotle, so really, I won't hear any more excuses from you. I can't wait to go back and try different combinations of their delicious looking food."},{"name":"Refuge Cafe","address":"155 Brighton Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"Good food and great coffee.

I don't know why but we were sorely disappointed with Neptune Oyster.  Maybe our expectations were super high or maybe it was the fact that we had to wait 2 hours for a table that made the food taste only OK...\\n\\nTRANSPORTATION: Located right at the beginning of North End so it's walkable from a lot of different areas.  \\n\\nWAIT: They don't take reservations and the inside is so small they literally have 3 tables that could fit 4-6 depending on how they move them and then a counter/bar that fits probably 12 or so people.  That is why the wait is so long.  We came around 6pm and the wait was 2 hours, and it was literally 2 hours.  They get your number and give you a call when your table is ready so that was nice.  We walked around North End, got Mike's Pastry and then went along the greenway. \\n\\nATMOSPHERE:  The inside is intimate and has some fun \\"neptune\\" statues and other things on the wall.  It's pretty narrow so there's not much walking room but sitting at the bar is fun because you can see the bartenders/waiters make your food and drinks and converse with them.  The regular tables looked like marble or something, which was kind of neat.  It's definitely on the casual side, not like Island Creek Oyster Bar, which was definitely dress nice, trendy atmosphere. \\n\\nFOOD: We got 3 dishes to share and it was plenty for us.\\n\\nCLAM CHOWDER - Being in Boston you have to try the clam chowder and the menu said that they make it to order! This was pretty disappointing though, it was WAYYY too milky and thin.  I like my clam chowder chunkier with a thicker stew/soup base and not as milky.  The clams were fresh and good and the potatoes not bad but the amount of ingredients compared to the amount of liquid was not proportional and at the end it was all liquid.\\n\\nLOBSTER ROLL - They have both kinds (cold or hot) but I read in a book that their hot butter roll was the best so we ordered that with fries.  The lobster was very good, fresh and not chewy or overwhelming.  There was not much flavor though and I didn't really taste the butter.  The bun was whatevers, seemed like a hot dog bun to me.  The fries were decent, a little on the soggy side (which I like) and the kind that are brown.\\n\\nSEAFOOD CIOPPINO - I was the most excited about this dish.  I'm not a huge seafood eater and it's not necessarily because I don't like it but because it never seems worth the money and is always expensive and I can never tell if it's fresh or not.  Reading the reviews about this dish and seeing the ingredients made me think it was going to be this savory, tasty seafood stew with rice and fresh pieces of seafood mixed in.\\n\\nIt had mussels, clams, salmon, another white fish and shrimp.  The sauce itself was very thin and pretty clear, it was spicy (for someone who can't handle spice) but nothing too overwhelming but it was totally lacking in the flavor department!! It didn't wow me or give me that tasty savory taste I was hoping for.  The seafood was pretty fresh though, the mussels were exceptionally good and the salmon SO tender.  Only the shrimp wasn't that fresh.  The rice is like a yellow rice that is not mushy but they don't give you all that much.  For close to $30, this dish was disappointing.\\n\\nOverall - not sure it's worth spending the $$ or wait here, I'd rather go to North End Fish Market for my lobster roll or Island Creek Oyster Bar."},{"name":"Lovely's Fifty Fifty","address":"4039 Mississippi Ave N, Ste 101","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"This is absolutely my new favorite pizza spot in Portland.

The happy hour special does not give you cole claw and one piece of fish, but it was very thick and came with plenty of fries.

The coffee while you wait is a really nice touch. I didn't have any (I'm pregnant) but everyone else did and said it was good coffee.\\n\\nI had a make your own scramble which was served with a healthy portion of hash browns and a piece of toast. I would have liked two pieces but my husband liked that they didn't give you a ton of toast like some places do, to each his own. My husband really enjoyed his scramble with bacon, red onion and pepper jack cheese (make your own).\\n\\nMy scramble was good, not amazing but maybe it was my fault as I picked the ingredients (bacon, bell pepper and caramelized onions). My mom had the Maddie cakes which I tasted and were quite yummy. My dad had the corned beef hash which looked great with big pieces of real corned beef. I didn't taste it but it looked good.\\n\\nService was friendly and prompt.

Since none of the other four people in the group had been to a Hooter's we were all curious.\\n\\nJust to describe our group it was the birthday boy, his girlfriend(bless her heart, letting her boyfriend go to Hooters...), a female friend, myself and my boyfriend.  Yes, that means two women, two gay guys and a straight guy went to Hooters.  I'm not sure if we got a few looks because of that or if we were younger than most of the other customers there(with the exception of the 8 year old boy who was there with his father...), but we were seated quickly.\\n\\nFirst off, the service was good.  We weren't waiting long and waitresses were always happy and bubbly.  And another point in their favor: they seemed to know that the only straight guy at the table was taken, and so the flirting which we saw rampant at the other tables was very low-key at ours.\\n\\nThe food was about average.  I personally liked the wings, and if we could've gotten them with the sauce a bit hotter(silly non-spicy food eating people we were with...) they would've been the best I've had in a while.  Unfortunately the rest of the food was only so-so.  The baked beans and the potato salad weren't very good and the sandwiches we all had weren't terrible, I can honestly say I've made better at home.\\n\\nIt was mentioned to the waitress that it was someones birthday, and I've heard stories about what they do at other Hooters.... (one such story involved the waitresses placing stickers on the birthday-boy.... although the story-teller wouldn't tell me where those stickers were placed...) and I'm not sure if all those stories are just fantasies, or if the waitresses didn't know how to handle a guy there with his girlfriend, because they only gave our birthday-boy a signed menu.  But the menu was priceless because the Hooter's girl sure know how to pun.  My favorite birthday wish was \\"To a cutie, from a Hootie!  Happy Birthday!\\"\\n\\nAll in all, my first(and probably last) time in a Hooter's was a positive experience, even if most of it came from people-watching everybody else interact with the girls.  I guess if there was one a bit closer I might be tempted to come in for some wings now and again, but I guess not liking breasts kinda defeats the purpose of this restaurant...."},{"name":"Tasty n Alder","address":"580 SW 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Great food and great service all around!

The ricotta pancakes were simply pancakes -- with a blob of ricotta in the center, unincorporated and uninspired (and making for soggy pancakes). We loved the radicchio salad. But the flatbread was undercooked, and essentially ruined by a nearly-raw egg on top. I had to scrape the runny egg WHITE off the top in order to eat it. We spent 87 bucks for 3 people.

It's in a great spot around other venues like Tin Roof. We went inside and decided to sit at the bar. The place is generally pretty clean, although the bartender did take a minute to clean off our spot. We order a Guinness and Irish Car Bomb as our drinks for St. Patty's Day. The Guinness was a Guinness and the Irish Car Bomb was fairly tasty. We then proceeded to order 65 cent wings for Boneless Thursday. The timing of bringing out our wings was just right (aka not too slow, but not too fast as to indicate that they had them precooked or just slapped them together). They included plenty of sauce for both wings, and my wife's Blazin wings were just the right level of spicy. We ate our food, played poker on the provided game tablets, and watch some NCAA basketball for about an hour. While not as exciting as a night downtown, we definitely had a good time.\\n\\nOverall, this BWW delivers on everything you would want at a BWW: good service, good food, and a good time.

All the tables were full when we ate dinner there, so what reason do you have to not smile. The bottom line is that this place is OVER RATED.

After exploring, we came back at around 4:30 because that is a rough estimate on when our table would be ready. We went in the restaurant and there was no hostess I dont even know where she disappeared to. I had to ask the woman attending the bar about my table and she gave me the excuse of \\"I don't have the list blah blah blah\\". There were a bunch of waiters and servers standing in the back corner of the restaurant, and they all saw my party and I. My mom waved her hand at a waiter to get some help, and the dumb waiter ignored us. He was blond and had an ear piercing. After five fricking minutes he came over with the list and told us our table would be ready in a couple of minutes. Okay so we waited outside the restaurant and watched other people try to get a seat in the place. We got in and ordered the octopus cocktail, the clam chowder, and the hot lobster roll. Octopus cocktail was exquisite. The octopus wasn't tough at all and the sauce was amazing. The clam chowder was such a disappointment how can they mess it up I don't understand. The soup was not thick at all and it was watery. The table next to mine agreed that the clam chowder was very thin and was not worthy. The chef needs a lesson on how to make clam chowder even though he lives in fricking New England. Lobster rolls on the other hand, were worth the hype. It was the best one I've ever tasted. Fries were way too greasy though, shake shack makes better ones. Our waiter was very nice and attentive, and after giving them a humongous tip we got multiple thank yous out the door. That rude blonde waiter with a piercing also gave us many thanks.  of course when we give you a big tip you are nice to us. Honestly some people.

But all together, my experience was completely unacceptable. Firstly it was an hour past our reservation time when we got seated. Crazy Easter morning, things happen, no big deal. In contrast I like the Bloody Mary bar because I like mine just so and no one ever puts quite enough horseradish. Once we finally got seated, it took some time to get things rolling. I understand this as well, get a little backed up and things happen. And that's where my understanding ends. I ordered the ahi tuna sandwich melt, expecting to get a seared tuna steak and receiving tuna salad. No mention about that in the menu. I got my meal a good 20 minutes after everyone else and the kitchen still got it wrong, like there's something difficult about spooning tuna salad out on toast. By this point I'm getting annoyed so I said screw it, everything was fine, I didn't expect it, but I'll eat it. Cherry on top of everything, the first bite of BOTH halves of my sandwiches had something about as big as half my index finger and I'm pretty sure was bone. \\"Food 101\\" is right because these guys need a crash course, freshman level, because they have no idea what's going on.

When we first arrived it wasn't clear whether we were supposed to just take a couple menus and sit at any one of the 5 or so open tables.

After no one came we started wondering if the sign in sheet was a remnant of breakfast, then we noticed big, paper numbers on all the tables like a place where there's no table service.  Hmm.  So I asked one of the staff who was cleaning up a table if it was ok if we sat down.  Poor fellow must have been traumatized by a nasty customer because he practically winced when he defensively repeated over and over again, \\"I'm sorry! Yes, pick a table. I'm sorry I didn't see you. Sorry!\\"  No prob!  So we sat down and asked the same fellow if there was a happy hour menu.  No. Weird, since we checked the website before coming and it read \\"happy hour 5pm-8pm.\\"  Yeah, I know, that would be a super long, fabulous happy hour so we should have known better but Jam, can you fix that?  Then we asked for the beer list thinking they probably have some great stuff considering the beautiful bar that was left behind from the last place. So, the server (very nice) comes and points out the list and has corrections for nearly everything on it.  Out of most and some additions that didn't make it to the list (like miller high life.  Good addition?).  Then we look at the menu which is pretty darn brief and boring. Salads and sandwiches. That's it.  So surprising since the breakfast menu is so extensive.

Mustve been 20 pickup orders come thru while we were there.  2 returned back with incorrect food... we had ordered wine, and mango drink for my friends daughter. These drinks literally came 2 min before our appetizers- 30-40min after arrival. Then apps- summer rolls w/tofu and peanut sauce- very very good. Fresh peanut sauce. Rolls are full of variety and size. Potstickers came next w/plum sauce. Plump, delicious, juicy.  So right after we get the apps, like 5min later, mains. Child order was chicken fried rice. Minimal chicken pieces.  Wouldve been tasty but it tasted like it sat too long scorched and burnt. I got mine at same time. Cashew nut chicken. With no cashews!?! Great portion, fresh and variable veggie, nice sauce,  but like wtf? So my friend had ordered the house curry with tofu. After about 15-20min of us eating our dishes, she still didnt have hers...finally she went and asked the harried host if it was forgotten? She said no, it was still coming...damn. so another 5min it comes out with apologies.  Me and kid are done eating. So my friend has to sit and eat her curry by herself...i tried it- effing delicious.

Like many, I've been eating Mexican-styled food all my life, from the authentic taco trucks of metros from San Diego to Santa Rosa, to the usually unfortunate Tex Mex, Baja-style, and the SF/Mission style. Pepino's manages to serve delicious food at more-than-reasonable prices, and in a sense, offers customers detours into these different styles of Mexican food. I think they excel at the California/Mission-style burritos, where you get a pretty decent sized burrito filled with multiple ingredients, often lots of meat, but the vegetarian offerings are the real prize I think. There's a freshness to the burritos, which are piping hot, slightly pressed and wrapped in foil for your convenience. \\n\\nAgain, portions are decent here, and the salsa bar offers you enough condiments to nicely compliment your chips or main course. I like the salsa verde most, and of course, I always take advantage when escabeche (pickled peppers and carrots) is offered. I had a grilled fish taco here and it was surprisingly good. Tilapia if I had to guess, but delicious nonetheless. I'd say it matches the quality of La Salsa or comparable mid-level baja-style eateries. The burritos, in my opinions, are better at Pepino's, and the same goes for other offerings. Free refills on soda. They aren't stingy with anything here. \\n\\nAs far as al pastor is concerned, I prefer a nice spit behind the counter. Also, I find Pepino's to be a bit understaffed at times, and consequently tables take a long-time to be cleaned-off. When you have a customer with a bunch of kids and they're really messy, it can be an issue for some. Some folks clean their tables better than others, obviously.

They are a B.C. only company.\\n\\nSince then, De Dutch has grown - slowly.  Their menu has changed little, and that is a good thing, because some of us like it the way it is.  It is a bit thread-bare, and at times a little under staffed, but the pannekoeken (or however you spell i in Dutch) are still yummy.  \\n\\nThis trip I brought my truly \\"foodie\\" parents, and they were not as impressed as I had hoped they would be, which sort of stressed me out and made the whole experience less than fabulous for me.  Keep in mind, this is a franchise restaurant - not an authentic one-off Dutch pannekoeken shop.   \\n\\nThere is a format and you might not get the most generous portion - that's just how it's going to be at a franchise.  But it's delicious and relatively inexpensive for a crepe style pancake that coveres the entire dinner size plate and is covered with your choice of toppings.  Eggs, ham, bacon, sausage, cheese, vegetables or your choice of fruit toppings, chocolate, whipped cream etc....\\n\\nThis particular De Dutch is TINY.  On holiday weekends, be prepared to wait.  parking is limited (street is metered) and there are two outside tables that seat 4 - or none if it's raining.

Went for a late lunch during off-peak hours when there were only 2 other tables seated. Long story short - it took 15 minutes to have my drink order taken, another 20 minutes at least to get food order taken (which only happened because I had to hail the waiter over from twiddling his thumbs at the bar), he didn't write down the order and returned immediately because he forgot which appetizer we had wanted, my dining companion got the wrong food sent out (which she just ate at that point, because we knew trying to correct it would be more hassle than it was worth). All of this with a huge side of \\"serving you is below me\\" attitude. When he disappeared completely (it was later explained that he was on break, which is fine, but generally that doesn't mean his tables should be forced to have zero service) I was looking all around the restaurant with no response from the hostess who was folding napkins 5 feet away, the bartender who had no business, or the second waiter. Any one of them might have asked if we needed help, but nothing... I finally had to ask the other waiter for our bill, which was incorrect and overcharged us by 2 drinks that we hadn't even ordered. \\n\\nI typically give businesses the benefit of the doubt - we all have bad days - however after seeing no response from management to negative experiences on yelp, I felt it necessary to also add my bad experience here, even though I have an n of 1. Needless-to-say, I will not be back unless management actually reaches out to show they care about their customers, and I will be spreading the word to my circle of friends to avoid this restaurant.

We wound up sharing blue crab nachos and their Hongos Guisados specialty with flour tortillas, and afterward didn't feel the need to order anything else.\\n\\nI've mentioned before I know nothing about Mexican cuisine, and sometimes wonder if the difference between Tex-Mex and genuine interior fare is the price, but damn, they sure have some tasty stuff here. They're big on broiled white cheese, everything was either hot or cold - I'm not fond of tepid - and those sauteed mushrooms with their homemade tortillas were so captivating I considered getting another order. I settled for more tortillas and filled them with anything left on the the table that was edible. Great stuff.\\n\\nAs we were leaving, I did wonder how this Manuel's Downtown compares to their Arboretum location, and which place is doing better business, and why some downtown restaurants have stayed the course and some haven't. I thought these things for about 65-feet, as we were running across the street and down the steps to the Elephant Room. I don't have any questions about live jazz and coffee. I know that's part of Austin's Downtown magic."},{"name":"Mix'D UP Burgers","address":"313 Blvd SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I went to the food truck at Broad Street today 5-26-17.

We had to wait 1 hour to get seated (as promised by the waitress), and this was on a random Tuesday. It's busy. It's small, and there's not a lot of seating inside. Memorial weekend must've been a nightmare.\\n\\nBro Tip: you'll probably get seated faster with a party of 4 or less. Taxi cab size. We had a party of 5, and parties of 3 and under got seated before we did. They had to put 2 tables together for us. \\n\\nAs visitors we had no problem waiting for \\"the best\\" so we strolled around the north end and admired the history, and quaintness of the entire area--as well as the filming locations for The Town. Not hard to waste time when you're entirely new to the area. Picked up some goods from Mike's Pastry a few blocks away.  \\n\\nThere was only one waitress handling the floor (not counting the one behind the bar). She was polite and helpful, though clearly over worked, running around refilling water and taking orders. \\n\\nOn to the food: \\nWe ordered the spicy seafood stew, 2 lobster rolls (hot), 3 different oysters, and 2 New England chowders. \\n\\nSeafood stew: A nice tangy spice along with some great seafood. A piece of whitefish(?), 2 pieces of salmon, and assorted shellfish. Not too bad. \\n\\nOysters: we only ordered 3 because we came for the lobster and I never had any before. They have all the different types of shellfish listed on a sheet like a sushi bar along with descriptions of their flavor--like fine wine. I ordered one from Thatch Island with a \\"buttery finish\\". I couldn't really discern anything specific, but it was cold, refreshing, and surprisingly good. Not fishy at all. \\n\\nLobster Roll: Comes prepared in 2 ways, cooked in butter, or cold with mayo. We ordered 2 hot ones because mayo would overpower the delicious lobster. It was worth the wait with it's buttery deliciousness on a toasted bun. Only thing negative was that I got some cartilage/shell in my sandwich that I had to pull out of my mouth. Not pleasant nor appetizing. -1 star.\\n\\nAll in all, very good though expensive for the casual lunch.

Arrived on time for our reservation and waited (20+ minutes) to be seated with no explanation, and my question about the seating/timing was met with a cold non-answer. There were clearly enough available tables and the right configurations to accommodate everyone who was waiting (several other parties came in after us) the entire time we waited. I've been at restaurants when the chef has quit and walked out of the kitchen into the night, never to be seen again. There was no way they could feed us in that situation, but the staff let us know, and we were able to be compassionate and understanding. Not at all what happened at Bondir.\\n\\nThere were several servers who seemed dedicated to filling water glasses, bringing bread and clearing plates. We were asked and made the mistake of ordering drinks from one -- the drinks never arrived, but eventually our other server took the order again and brought what we'd wanted.\\n\\nThe second server was well-versed in the cuisine and enthusiastic about the chef and the menu. Made good recommendations, answered questions, and described things accurately. Bondir has a lovely menu with a great variety of dishes. I really liked the small/larger portion option. It's a nice way to share food and try some different things.\\n\\nFood was delicious - fresh, delicious, beautiful, well-paced. We shared a few small plates and larger dishes.

I would have to agree with one of the reviewers about the spiciness of the spicy tuna--it's not very spicy. We definitely over ordered as we were not sure if the rolls would be small or not--we had enough leftovers for another meal the next day.\\n\\nService here is good--she kept checking in on us and refilling out tea. Our server accidentally gave us the wrong roll (which was intended for someone else). However we told her to put it on our check as we ate it and loved it (it was the Ichiro roll).\\n\\nI would definitely come back and try some other rolls and sushi. They had uni as a special on the board but they didn't have it when we ordered!! I was disappointed but had the fried oyster appetizer instead.

Only 3 beers on tap, best wine on the list (Never saw a list just what was stacked on the back bar) was 14 Hands.  I ordered the Prime rib with baker, wife got the rack of ribs.  20 minutes later the very friendly bartender delivered our food.  My wife's ribs appeared to be precooked food service product that had been reheated on a char grill.  It was so charred the bone ends were black and crumbling.  My Prime was cook medium, pink edge to edge.  As well as it was cooked they don't use a dry rub of any kind that I could tell.  Both of our baked potatoes were reheated as the starch had reset leaving a good home fry quality potato not a fluffy hot baker.  The kicker was the use of \\"Baco's\\" on the potato's.  Remember the bacon like crumbles mom used to put on the table when you were a kid, those were \\"Baco's\\".  They were leaching pink dye into the sour cream.  I really wanted Clyde's to be awesome.  In the competitive Portland market a skilled chef and owner could make something special in this space.  Unfortunately Clyde's has an owner with questionable vision and a chef that has no pride.

Le Pigeon also only serves five of their burgers each night, and we didn't like our odds given that we were looking for burgers and only burgers.

I dig.\\n\\nHere we go:\\nThis bistro burger came on a house-baked ciabatta-esque roll, flavorful and chewy enough to hold its own, but not so crusty as to tear up the roof of your mouth or make the burger self-destruct in your hands.  The beef was cooked just as we ordered it, medium and medium-well, there was definitely a difference between our two burgers in this respect, and we both appreciated it.  This was topped with my two favorite parts of the encounter: a friendly layer of Gruyere and a pickled red onion(!) The flavor on this little guy was so intense I couldn't eat the whole onion, but it added so much to the overall taste I muscled it out as long as I could, till I got to the center of it and I tapped out.  The onion did leave its essence behind, though, and I was then able to better enjoy the tasty, happy, crunchy slaw that topped the whole bag off.  I was Grade-A sad when my burger was finished, it was really, really that good.\\n\\nWe're five burgers into our quest, and this is currently at the top of my list, while Sir still prefers the one at Gilt Club, as he wasn't as much a fan of the pickled onion, so YMMV.\\n\\nBurger on, my friends."},{"name":"Tibby's New Orleans Kitchen","address":"2203 Aloma Ave","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4.5","text":"Great food !

Boston Pizza caught our eye as it was close to our hotel. We went in for dinner our first night and were impressed with the food. We had a short wait, decent service, and good food.  On our second night we decided to go back for dinner since we'd had a good experience. Big mistake!\\n\\nIt was really slow and we were seated right away. Our order was taken quickly but that was the end of our positive experience. Our food took a long time especially considering the restaurant was at less than 50% capacity. Our server tended to forget that we were there. After ordering dessert, she came asking us if we needed anything else as to give us our bill. We had to remind her that we'd placed the order. \\n\\nWhen we received the bill, we paid in US currency. Our experience with all other vendors had been that we receive the change converted into Canadian currency. In this case, we received change in Canadian currency, not converted, and even less than the amount if it had been even. We inquired with the waitress, who told us that  they do it \\"par\\". Excuse us for not understanding the terminology, but we had to ask two other employees, including a manager, who finally told us they don't have the capacity to convert the difference therefore they just give change at par but moreover seemed bothered by our questions.  If our bill had been minimal it wouldn't have been an issue but is was over $125. At the current exchange rate, we were shorted almost $30. \\n\\nMaybe this is a good place for local residents, but if you're traveling from the US, make sure you have Canadian currency or you'll get ripped off for their lack of ability to do math with a side of poor service."},{"name":"Tasty n Alder","address":"580 SW 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"This was the best overall brunch experience we've had in a long time.

The service was decent -- if your aren't familiar with The Fresh Kitchen, the food is on a line that you walk thru similar to Chipolte and Moe's Southwest Grill, giving the server your order. That's about the only positive thing I can say. There's a choice between the \\"Four Bowl\\"  and the \\"Six Bowl.\\" The Four has 2 bases (rice, quinoa, noodles, lettuce, etc.), 1 veggie, 1 protein, 1 sauce for $8.99 & the Six has 2/2/2/1of the same types for $9.99. I opted for the Four. I got citrus grilled chicken, rice, quinoa, & roasted sweet potatoes. I added roasted almonds ($0.50 extra). Unfortunately the paper menu listed mashed sweet potatoes as a base but when I went to order it I found out it's seasonal. Overall the food was ok but nothing spectacular. They offer a lot of \\"extras\\" but they all come as an upcharge item. My chief complaint is the amount of food they serve. An adequate but not overly generous portion of rice and quinoa but a PATHETICALLY small amount of meat. Overall just not worth waiting in line nearly 10 minutes for a meal that is not much of a value -- the bowls at Chipotle, Nature's Table and Moe's are hands down just as tasty and freshly made with nearly twice the food for a couple of dollars less. They had some type of bottled drinks but it appeared to be $5 a bottle (?).

She was an uppity bit*h with horrible service and treated me like I owed her something.  I saw her 3 times throughout the meal....  one to order, (someone else delivered), one to say is the food great?, and the check.   On top of that she was average and thought she was gods gift to waitresses or at least looked at us like we weren't in her class. I do OK with cash I am upper middle but I admit I dress with baggy sweatshirts and slacks because it was 27 degrees and I had 5 layers on.  \\n\\nThe waitress was condescending and looked down her nose at us all 3 trips like we did not belong.  I told my family after the bottle of wine and appetizer of incredible cheeses ( gotta admit the cheeses were good 22 bucks);  ($38 for wine) ......lets leave I just wanted out of there.  \\n\\nOf course the wife said that's rood and I was stuck.

In these shaky economic times, so many restaurants are hurting, but the Halfway keeps chugging along, and in fact recently opened a new location in Maynard.\\n\\nThink of the Halfway Cafe as what the 99 Restaurant used to be--a somewhat dark yet comfortable restaurant and bar that features better-than-average American fare and pub grub. The burgers, fries, club sandwiches, pizza, and steak tips are all excellent at the Holbrook location, though occasionally they have a dud, such as the rather bland chicken stroganoff I had there awhile ago. Prices are generally reasonable, service tends to be friendly and efficient, and the clientele is typically laid back, with lots of retirees, couples on dates, and families frequenting the place.\\n\\nI'm generally not a big fan of chain restaurants, but the Halfway Cafe is one that I do like, and go to quite often, actually.

The entire first floor seemed like it was for children, and was so packed with kids waiting to get into the different activity rooms that I couldn't navigate through it well.  The other floor was mostly a traveling exhibit that I didn't care for, and then the permanent collection was small and disorganized.

We ordered the Montreal rib eye to share and the beef bacon side. $7.00 for 4 thin cut pieces of over-cooked bacon was steep.

So I tried asking again, because perhaps she had misunderstood the word I used.  I tried this three times, and she insisted that the fries only had a little bit of gluten, so they were \\"mostly gluten-free!\\"  Thanks... but no thanks.  When asked about gluten free options were were told there were lots... like... ummmm... salad.  And they have a beer that ranks low on the gluten-index, so is low gluten.  That doesn't really help either, but thanks for trying.\\n\\nWe have had several visits like this to the Charlatan.  No one seems to really understand gluten-free there, and while I get that it is a frustrating allergy/diet restriction to deal with, it is important to note that many people can get very sick from it if their waiter is unclear on what gluten is.  We have come to accept the fact that only nachos are edible for my partner, other than salad.  And who wants a salad after playing floor hockey?\\n\\nI, on the other hand, am not limited by gluten, and have dined on delicious quesadillas and chicken burgers.  Chicken + pear + pancetta + Camembert = magic.    And the beer paddles for $5 on Mondays are awesome.

But for the Americanized approach, AC does it well, just in smaller doses. They have a solid draft list, all domestics, from all the prime-time beer locales throughout the country. A very formidable & extensive liquor list is a younger sister-like kick to PH's liquor-limited shins. \\n\\nWhile the food menu is not large, there are cheap sandwiches for the budget conscious. These not only fill one up and possibly give 'em leftovers, but are delicious and well executed as well. They have some more creative takes, with a pseudo- \\"Thanksgiving on a sandwich\\" (turkey, gravy, stuffing, and cranberries!), and a chicken skin club. (My friend and I had these choices, and they were unanimously delicious.) I appreciate that they offer veggie and turkey burgers along with beef burgers, and a generous array of toppings... although, as you're are paying $1-3 for EVERY single one, they are not generous to the wallet. \\n\\nUnfortunately, AC is not 5-star worthy - there are simply better places to go in Boston. An unfortunate first experience featuring a severe 86ing of various items (my friend was 0-3, ouch!), and a slightly pretentious manager's lackluster and indifferent approach to this dilemma kicks 'em down another notch.

I started coming to Murphy's about 5 years ago and immediately fell in love with the place.  The food, wine list, wine shop and cookies have always be consistently amazing.  So last nights service on the patio was shocking to me.  After being sat the waiter came over dropped off the menus and that was it.  We eventually flagged him down to place our food order.  I asked that he leave the wine menu because we would be ordering a bottle of wine.  After waiting and no return from our waiter I went to the bar.  Before the bartender was about to take my order the hostess asked if I needed anything.  I told her I wanted to order a bottle of wine and our waiter was MIA from our table. She immediately stepped in and within less then a minute of making it back to the table, our wine was delivered.   As another waitress is pouring the wine our waiter claims he didn't realize we wanted a bottle of wine.  Shortly after that our food was served.  The waiter stopped through when we were finished eating to collect our plates and walking away he said he would be right back with our check.  When he came back I asked if this was a new policy or if there was something special about our table?  I explained that we were the last table to be sat in this section and my observation was no other table that in our area had received a check yet.  Though tables had completed dinner and were either talking or were eating dessert.  He attempted to apologize and said he would take the check back until we were ready.  We asked that he just leave it and moments later paid the check.   \\n\\nLast nights experience was so out of the norm for me at Murphy's that I pray it was just that one off night.

We ordered a half dozen apps and shared them among us and each had dinner and dessert. It was too much for sure, but it was so good. Several weeks later I owed my wife her an anniversary dinner and a birthday dinner and she hadn't made it in for the first dinner. And we were in need of a distraction again (this time since my dad had passed away from complications after a surgery). This time the menu had changed to the summer menu and we ordered a number of apps and breads and dinners. Again it was too much and we brought our leftovers home they were great the next day. Distraction accomplished. A week later we had a friend from Indiana visiting and I couldn't think of a better place to take them. This time we sat inside and we basically ordered 14 things (mostly apps, bread and pizza) over 4 hours.

She called it \\"trendy Tex Mex\\", which I think is an accurate description.  The food was decent but unspectacular.  We ordered the campechana and a small guac to start.  The campechana was excellent -- excellent flavor and loaded with fish and shrimp.  The guac was good too, though my enjoyment of it was somewhat tarnished by the fact that our tortilla chips were a bit on the stale side.  \\n\\nFor our entrees, we ordered the beef fajitas for two.  The meat was a little overcooked to my liking but still tasted pretty good.  You get the standard fixings with the fajitas -- guac, sour cream, lettuce, tomatoes, cheese, etc.  I'd say it was on par with the fajitas one might expect to get from Chili's -- not terrible but not impressive either.  I will say that they do give you a good amount of food; you definitely won't leave hungry.\\n\\nWhile the food was decent, the reason Manuel's is getting two stars is because of the service we got.  From my perspective, service needs to either efficient or friendly (ideally both).  I don't mind if you're not the friendliest server in the world as long as you bring my food, refill my drinks and clear my plates quickly.  Likewise, if you go out of your way to make me feel welcome at your restaurant, I'll be more inclined to wait a little longer for things.  But when you're neither friendly nor efficient, that becomes a problem, which was the case with our server.  \\n\\nFirst off, our server barely cracked a smile the entire time.  I'm guessing she had been having a bad day but still -- when you're in the service industry, putting on a smiling face comes with the territory.  Our appetizers took forever to come out and when they finally did, we only had a couple minutes to eat before the entrees were brought out.  Instead of apologizing for taking so long to bring the appetizers out, our server actually asked us if we were done with our appetizers, even though we had barely gotten through half of it!  Likewise, when we asked for a refill on our tortilla chips, she walked past our table three times before remembering to bring them.  To top it all off, it took forever to get our check, which she dropped off without thanking us whatsoever.  It's too bad because we were eating on the client's tab and were ready to tip well had we gotten good service.\\n\\nWhile I'm usually willing to give a restaurant a second chance if I had a bad experience, I'm not so sure about Manuel's.  With so many Tex Mex places in Austin, I would probably not go back to Manuel's any time soon."},{"name":"Murphy's","address":"997 Virginia Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"As someone from out of town, I AM JEALOUS !

(Except for the cole slaw, which is swimming in too much mayonaise.) The only semi-satisfying meal I've had here is the \\"combo\\" lunch special, which is basically a big sauce-drenched pile of whatever ribs, sausages, and chicken parts are on-hand. But here's the thing: good BBQ shouldn't have to be sauce-drenched to taste good.\\n\\nPuzzlingly, Redbones remains something of an institution for the Davis Square area.

I wanted it to be so good, but it was so...lackluster.\\n\\nI'm not usually a fan of the order first, sit after style of restaurant, and this place epitomizes why. After standing in line for about 20 minutes, I got to the front of the line and was ordering. The place was packed and a table opened up, so my better half went to grab it. They approached her immediately and told her she had to get up since she hadn't ordered yet...She pointed to me and said I was ordering right now. They still made her give up the table. So, we stand around awkwardly like a ton of other people until we can grab another table...no harm, no foul...whatever. So, while I dress our table with drinks, silverware, napkins, hot sauce, etc (everything that would be done for you at a normal restaurant that actually provides service) I'm listening for my name to be shouted at me, meaning I have to go pick up my food. 15 minutes...30 minutes...45 minutes...nothing. Sometime around the hour mark we finally got our food (gee whiz was I so impressed with the place so far).\\n\\nWe ordered the Reggie Deluxe, a side of grits, and a biscuit with local marionberry jam. The sandwich was towering and we suck our forks in. The gravy was flavorful, the chicken was beautiful, and the bacon was crispy. It really was a tasty mess of southern cooking, but for waiting over an hour from the time I arrived, I couldn't help but notice the flaws that would prevent me from ever waiting that long for another one. We ran out of gravy well before the end of the sandwich, the sunny side up egg was cooked all the way through, and for a place that hangs its hat on its biscuits, they in no way shined in this meal. The grits were fine, although not very flavorful. I ended up using a little hot sauce to spice things up. The marionberry jam was fine...not great. It was very thick compared to the homemade jams I've tasted and reminded me of those little packets you'd find at Shari's.\\n\\nSo...maybe I'm being overly critical because I'm bitter about coming for breakfast and being made to wait to eat until lunch time, but this restaurant is a disappointment in my book.

The wine list had no moderately priced choices and I had to ask for bread. My wife ordered on of her favorites, chicken saltimbocca which was presented in a most peculiar style--cut into pieces that promptly fell apart into the separate ingredients.

When a new Brazilian Churrascaria called Chima opened in Buckhead my first thought was \\"Why bother?\\" After all, Fogo is right around the corner, and can you really improve on that concept? But armed with curiosity, an appetite and a 2 for 1 coupon, I went last week to find out.\\n\\nMy first impression was that the place must be popular. The dining room and adjacent bar was packed, and our 8pm reservation didn't yield a table until 8:50. This may be one of the few kinds of restaurants where I don't mind a wait that much since my goal is always to extend the meal (I have been known to have a full Fogo meal in 45 minutes because I can't contain myself). However, a 50 minute wait when you have a reservation is excessive.\\n\\nIf you are familiar with Fogo, the premise of Chima will be familiar. A salad bar with smoked salmon, various cheeses and salads etc. If there is one area where Chima may have outscored Fogo it may be the salad bar. There seems to be a few more choices including beef carpaccio (if the 'all you can eat beef\\" in the main course is not enough red meat).\\n\\nSpeaking of the main course, you know the drill. Gauchos serve endless selections of beef, lamb and some chicken, mostly on a skewer. A two sided card on your table alerts them when you are hungry and when you are taking a break. At Fogo, turning the card to green unleashes an assault of gauchos from all sides. Not quite the case at Chima. We had several lulls where there wasn't a gaucho to be seen. And that brings me to another point. Yes, the Chima gauchos wear some traditional garb. But it doesn't look that much different from the white shirts of the waiters and other staff. Therefore, it doesn't have that same unique appearance as Fogo where the gauchos really standout. As far as meat selections, I would give the nod to Fogo here as well. Some pieces were overcooked. Some pieces were cut too big, therefore cutting down on the sampling fun. The house special cut lacked the flavor that Fogo offers. And some of my favorite pieces were just plain missing- like the bacon-wrapped filet.\\n\\nSo for me, Fogo will still be my Churrascaria of choice in Atlanta. Chima was good, and the coupon helps (register at chimasteakhouse.com to get one). But its not like I am going to these places that often. So for the 2 or 3 times per year I do, there just isnt a good enough reason to go someplace else."},{"name":"Rosa Mexicano","address":"245 18th St NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"Ehhhh.

The decor inside is all about Mardi Gras--lots of great art and New Orleans mementos--especially memorable was a door that had the familiar spray painted red X on the window from Katrina, that had then been painted with a Creole musician playing the guitar in the flood water with a shark swimming under--great example of folk art and moving at the same time.

Came as a flattened brick but delectable and mouth-watering--I heard the angels sing as I tasted it!  Of course we had to wash that down with draft Abita amber ales, served in icy goblets.

And on the positive note, management stepped in and did the right thing to correct them.  Unfortunately, we had two consecutive problems with a same waiter who kept getting our order wrong.  I asked for a steak frites and he brought steak tips instead so I told him he had a wrong order.  Management stepped in and comped the meal as my wife ended up waiting for my meal so hers was cold.  Next time, I ordered a pizza and had a bad feeling so I asked him to double check and he snarled under the breath that he got it right.  We later saw in the receipt that order was incorrect and he wrote 'comped for a wrong order'.  (We never saw the other one).  The third time we went, we ended up with the same waiter and he gave us a nasty look and made it abundantly clear to us that he doesn't like us and we are not welcome by ignoring us throughout the entire course of our meal.  (Our glasses were empty, we had no silver, he would ignore when I ask for him so we asked another waiter for water, etc).  As a result, we now avoid this establishment as we feel unwelcome.  The very last time we went, we asked waiter to specifically avoid \\"an older gentleman who doesn't like us\\".  Hostess acknowledged that others have had problems and he was out that day.

I frequently eat here with friends and recommend it to strangers. However, this will be changing, given a recent interaction.\\n\\nI arrived with a party of five and we noticed that one of the white ceramic plates was streaked gray and slightly stained. We flipped it around and it was very much chipped on the bottom. It looked like it had been used in the kitchen to catch leaks for years, was scrubbed with steel wool, and accidentally put into service on the serving floor. \\n\\nI flagged a waiter over and asked to switch it out ( quick note that I've worked retail for years, so I'm never rude to others who work with the general public). The waiter responded with a challenging \\"Why?\\" I showed him the plate and he told me that the plate wasn't dirty - they aggressively scrub the dishes clean. In my mind, that was precisely the problem - they had scrubbed it past the point of usability. I repeated my request, and the waiter sneeringly told me it was fine, but because I was insistent, he'd get me a whole stack of plates. \\n\\nTrue to his word, he did arrive with more plates than we had people. At this point, my party felt pretty uncomfortable, but I was fine since he was the one making a bigger deal of my request than it was. I swapped out the plate and moved on.\\n\\nThroughout our meal, the same waiter gathered our finished plates, making sure to bang them around unnecessarily. Halfway through our meal, he took his lunch and another waiter helped us. We noticed that our egg tarts hadn't come out, and asked the new waiter about them. The new waiter responded \\"Oh, he didn't tell you? We ran out.\\" Cool. Stellar service. Two thumbs up. \\n\\nI never expect red carpet treatment in Chinatown, and I've let many smaller but similar situations at Bubor slide because I understand it's hard work with sometimes tough patrons. But this really takes the cake - or my egg tarts, in this situation. \\n\\nIt's unfortunate because the food is alright and the space is convenient for bigger parties, but this will be my last voluntary trip here and I'll never recommend the abysmal service to tourists again.

We ate it.... and then waited and waited and waited. But our waitress never appeared to take our order. I finally asked the hostess (who i wasnt thrilled to ask any favors of) if she could find our waitress cuz we were starving. Strike 2.\\nSoon after our waitress arrived and took our order. She seemed irritated with us and reminded us that we needed to order something at regular price in order to get the ladys nite prices on our meals.

I've only ever drank/had dinner in the bar area so my review is based off of that. You ride the elevator thirty floors up and step out to pure elegance. I remember my first time coming out of that elevator, hearing a piano player tinkling some Charlie Brown, and getting a distant glimpse of the view. I was immediately in love.\\n\\nI come here at least a few times a year and generally that's for special occasions. They are very accommodating to people with birthdays and have always been good with giving the birthday person a free desert. On one occasion our waiter even was kind enough to have the piano player to play Happy Birthday. We didn't even ask for this! The low-lit ambience is incredible and the view is one of the best in the city. I always get there early to try secure a window booth. But any spot in the bar is good as the windows are huge and have a beautiful overlook across the river into SE Portland. If you come during happy hour not only is everything much more affordable, but you can watch the sun set and the city lights start to glow.\\n\\nThe food is always delicious, and even at $30 or more a plate I never feel shortchanged. The happy hour food is much more limited but there are some good choices -- the steak burger with chips is especially appetizing. They have a great wine selection and when we took a friend there for her 21st the waiter was very kind to answer all her questions about what wine would pair best with her dinner. I myself am a fan of the Portland Street Car, one of the finest cocktails I've ever had. It's made strong but still has a fruity taste that blends well with the alcohol. Neither taste is overwhelming. Whoever mixes those up at the bar is quite the wizard. They're $12 a pop but very worth it and I always find myself downing at least a couple.\\n\\nThe service is top notch and we've never had a bad waiter. They come by to check up on us and make sure our drinks are full. The bathrooms are ultra clean and have a nice full length mirror to give yourself a once over. The general feel is of an upscale atmosphere though sometimes at happy hour there are people a tad more dressed down. I don't mean to say it's a suit only type of place, but I generally feel most comfortable going in there adorned in khakis, dress shoes, and a nice sweater. \\n\\nThe only reason I'm deducting one star is that due to the window tables being in such high demand there is a bit of a rat race to get them. If you're finishing up your dinner but still sitting around having drinks and conversation people tend to start circling your table like vultures ready to swoop in on your plate. Several times we've had people come up and ask us if we'd be done soon so they could grab our table. As soon as you stand up and grab your coat people will literally dash over and put their hand on the table while you're still in it. Some type of numbering/waiting system would be great to avoid this. That being said, this is one of the coolest places in Portland. I've been there countless times and I'm still always wowed by the gorgeous vista, the food, and the wonderful ambience. Great place!"},{"name":"Tasty n Alder","address":"580 SW 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"My girlfriend and I came to Portland for a anniversary weekend away from Boise. We had just visited the Japanese Gardens earlier that morning and were both starving. I was checking the top ten Yelp recommendations when I saw Tasty n Alder had over 2000 reviews at a 4+ star rating. We hurried down the mountain and were greeted by one of the nicest and most knowledgeable hostess' I've ever met.  (I don't recall her name but she wore glasses if that helps) she gave us the 411 on everything we asked about on that menu which really helped us decide before we were even seated. As luck would have it, we were the last couple to be seated and make it for brunch, and boy was I glad we didn't miss it!  We started off with the Burrata & Grilled Peaches which packed some incredibly large flavor for a small plate! It is just something you cannot describe but have to taste. The flavors of the fresh peaches combined with the spicy caviar was incredible. For our main meals I  had the steak & cheddar eggs which is served in a cast iron skillet and my girlfriend had the ham hash, which out of everything we ate was hands down one of the best meals I've had in a very long time. Both meals were delicious! The family style serving is a cool idea where everyone shares as the food comes out. I know this might be just another great review for the restaurant, but as an out of state review, I wanted any visitors traveling to Portland to put this on the \\"must-go\\" places to eat.

I love arriving a few minutes early, watching it come out of the oven and them spreading a layer of melted butter over the top to make it glisten.\\n\\nThey take credit cards so that's a plus.....and the seating area has like six booths which is plenty since they aren't usually overly busy.  I usually get take out and your food is always ready within 15 minutes of ordering.    \\n\\nI agree, not the best name for the restaurant but the foreign owners probably wanted to try something with a little pizzazz without knowing what entails a typical NY pizza. I'd love to go back and try a few other things but it's pretty hard to pull myself away from something so cheap and good that becomes your staple."},{"name":"Neptune Oyster","address":"63 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Best seafood in Boston.

I tried the marionberry (too sweet) and apple butter jam (better but tastes like apple sauce) jam - both are made locally in Oregon. \\n\\nSoft, fresh, fluffy biscuits - some of the best I've ever had - but stick with the sandwiches and don't miss this spot if you're in Portland!"},{"name":"Pho Pasteur","address":"682 Washington St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I love it here.

I cant begin to describe how delicious my orders were this time... Lets see\\nFirst, Yook Hue, my official tradition is to order one when i come here. Generous portion of protein(beef) and extremely delicious. What more can you ask for?\\nSecond, I decided to order something average to start off my meal and got a Spicy tuna roll. However, this roll was everything but ordinary. The spicy tuna just tasted delicious that words cant begin to describe the sensation in my mouth. MUST GET IF YOU COME HERE.\\nThird, ever seen a pancake but mixed with seafood and japanese/korean style!? Neither have i. Well, this is my first time and wow!! The \\"pancake\\" was more like a medium sized pizza. Other than having nice looks, the taste of the crispy pancake was an awesome appetizer to top off with the spicy tuna. I swear the two things were made for each other.\\nFourth, i decided to try something out of the ordinary in the menu. So i decided to give Hwe Mu Chim a try. Similar to having sashimi of different types of fishes. Well i'm not sure about other people, but it was really fresh when i had mine and it was quite filling.\\nFifth, I was about to be full so i decided to order one last roll to end my adventure this time. Due to the influence of the sushi chef jacky or \\"jacki\\" according to the Boston Globe news paper, i decided to order the volcano again. My my my, i'll never get sick of this order. The combination of the mouth watering sauce with the ingredients almost made me order another one to take out. However, i was able to hold back my desires, luckily.\\nOverall i dont know why other people complain about the service so much when the delicious food definitely would make up for it. Also, the service isnt really that bad if you come here a few more times. At least its better than the service you find at some chinese restaurants near by. I would give this place a 5 star, but i believe that nothings perfect.

I was craving Puerto Rican food big time.  It had been about 3 years since I left NYC where I became a huge fan of their cuisine. I was super happy to find out that this place existed and it did not disappoint.  My girlfriend at the time and I really enjoyed the food there. It was not as good as stuff I had before, but it was still good and very flavorful.\\n\\nI recently moved into the neighborhood and had passed by a few times, so the day before my birthday last week, I decided to go see if it was as good as I remembered.  I ordered a michelada with a dos xx since the specials sign said it had their own blend of spices and fresh clams.  It had a nice kick to it and good flavor.  The clams were ok, but of course you had to dig them out with a fork or spoon.  They did provide me with complimentary tostones (fried plantain) along with a garlic dipping sauce.  The tostones are not what some people might be used to. These were the potato chip kind that are sliced very thin.  They were fresh and tasty even though not the traditional I prefer.  \\n\\nI ordered the alcapurias as an appetizer. They are fried plantain dough fritters filled with beef.  The ones here I did not enjoy.  They surprisingly came in stick form resembling mozzarella sticks.  They had too little meat as well, but the most disappointing part was that they overcooked them a bit and had the slightly burned flavor that just masked anything good that might have been there.  The alcapurias I have always seen are rounder  in form, kind of resembling a small stress foam football and they are nicely filled with meat that every bite gets some.  I had a hankering for the pernil (roasted pork shoulder marinated in a plethora of delicious spices) so I quickly ordered that along with yellow rice with pigeon peas and a side of red kidney beans.  The pernil was perfect! Flavorful and moist, with a good amount of the outer edge of the shoulder that had crisped perfectly.  The rice and beans went perfect together and took me back to happy days.  It was a good meal even with an appetizing appetizer.  I definitely want to go back again soon.\\n\\nIt is a nice quiet place where one can enjoy a meal alone in peace, or even a quiet date where conversation is easy without having to speak loud."},{"name":"Neptune Oyster","address":"63 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Tasty take on seafood classics and nice atmosphere.

If you are on the dining plan, unlike others this restaurant is worth the two table service credits. Our bill for two adults and two children came to around $250, which is well over the 2 credit general price tag. Both adults ordered filet and lobster which comes with a mash potato and a string bean selection. We also paid out of pocket to try the lobster bisque! Amazing. Kids both had steak which came with potato wedges and string beans as well. They also had a choice of an apetizer, one got the garden salad which was adorably topped with cheddar goldfish and the other got the fruit which I ate because he didnt want it and it was yummy! For dessert, don't make my mistake and get the cheese plate. I am a cheese lover and enjoy trying new things, however this did not appease my pallate in the slighest. The other adult got the almond crusted cheesecake and well lets just leave it at life changing.

I just moved to Vancouver and saw Solly's sign during my many visits to Canadian Tire (it's on the next block), and I made a mental note to visit here soon!\\n\\nSo my elderly parents from Montreal were visiting us and I thought it would be a great idea to bring them to Solly's for breakfast on the first day of their visit. They love delis, too and they live on Montreal bagels with lox and cream cheese. My dad just wanted some plain eggs. They were excited to get some familiar food, and they kvelled over the menu and the Jewish foods in the display case (the rugelah, the knishes, the latkes, oh my!). \\n\\nThe set-up inside, for a newbie, is rather confusing: you line up from the right side and place your order, then go to the left and pay, then sit down and wait for them to call you to get your food. The woman with whom we placed our order was somewhat aloof: my dad had questions about the eggs and what the dish comes with and the woman was curt with him (he's nearly 90, for goodness sake. A little patience would go a long way!). At the cash, the guy wouldn't take my dad's $100 bill (there's a posted note that they don't accept them). No biggie, but a little issues. (Note: the new Canadian $100 bank bills are notoriously difficult to counterfeit). when our meals came out, one wasn't what we ordered (lox with cream cheese on a sesame bagel). We got a different meal instead. I went to discuss this with the woman who took our orders and she became very defensive, saying this is exactly what we ordered. Well, if we did, we didn't mean to and, honestly, any reputable establishment would simply have offered the customer what they wanted (in this case, just a bagel with lox and cream cheese. Instead we got a bagel with scrambled eggs and cheese. The woman argued that the \\"lox was inside\\". I can assure you, there was no lox at all inside this egg-cheese meal). But no, it was like talking to a stone wall. We were stuck with this meal we didn't order and ended up just picking at it and leaving most on the plate.\\n\\nThe food itself was good here. Not great, compared to east coast delis, but good. But the customer service was atrocious. In the future, if I return here, it would simply be to take our food.

My turkey was raw the first time and I had to send it back. Two out of three of our sides were wrong. My turkey was better the second time, but it was highly over-seasoned.

Eddie says something to the effect \\"He's enjoyable enough when you are listening to him, but once you leave you forget about him. His music has no soul.\\" This is how I feel about the food of the Danube. \\n\\nIt's a greasy spoon/bar institution that hugs High Street in North Campus, making it a noticeable landmark while driving, especially the mural of Vienna, blue on its north wall. But forget about it as a possible Austrian or Hungry ethnic restaurant;it is not. Its claim to fame is as a late night grub hang-out for students to escape their flat pads, shared houses, and dank dorms deep in the darker hours. That's how I used it, slouching at its booths into the earliest hours with textbooks and papers cluttering the tables, munching on forgetable appetizers, sucking on bottles of Icehouse. \\n\\nToday it has changed a bit. The food is pricier, and that's considering inflation. It seems to have become more dive bar than greasy spoon--which is kind of a shame, but it does keep the teenagers away--the townies, the skater dudes, the jailbate boppers--that once ran amuck in the mid-90s. \\n\\nThe food here had never been good, and that has not changed. They focus on too many things and so don't have a real specialty. My first trip back in a decade I decided to try the ruben. The sauerkraut was runny, lacking taste, and did not mesh with the corned beef. The corned beef was stringy--like Lady and the Tramp--and had little taste that I am accustomed too. I would not order that again. It was plain and not worth the price. Burgers here are decent, (or they were 10-years ago) ;go with that. The fries were standard out-of-the-box deal. \\n\\nBeer choices were much improved and local, examples are Landgrant and a Barley's ale that they switch out often. I had a flavorful wheat ale. \\n\\nOf course the ceiling tiles are cool. Andy Warhol shout-out, Brutus the Buckeye, cartoonish, abstract, derivative, graffiti like, and impressionistic chalked characters and scenes hang above your head; they are like attractive doodles on class note pages and black pen inked designs from backs of notebooks. \\n\\nIt could qualify as two stars but the service is good, it's a campus mainstay, it's not meant to be tops in the city.

Parking is rather limited to side-streets so you may as well valet with the guys across the street - they'll take good care of your car.\\n\\nIt's been at least 10 years since I last visited Murphy's, only due to the huge number of restaurants in Atlanta and my desire to visit pretty much all of them. I last lived on North Highland in 1994 and while I lived there and for about a dozen years afterwards, I got to know the local restaurants quite well. I had visited Murphy's a few times and have taken it a bit for granted - I'm very happy that the restaurant is doing well - it seems some restaurants in the area can stand the test of time.\\n\\nMurphy's is the corner building of a row that bends along North Highland with parking along the front - Murphy's faces Virginia Ave more along the back-side of the bend. You'll see bright yellow awnings above a patio and entry-barrier against the weather - otherwise the brick facade is painted and resembles other low-retail along Highland. The interior is very warm and inviting, brick, painted ceiling rafters and wooden table tops. Wines are prominently displayed on several walls (Murphy's is known for its wine tastings); there's votive lighting everywhere to provide a pleasant glow to everything. This is an awesome date-night spot and I can attest that it's worthwhile for brunch. We had reservation and were seated almost immediately (the restaurant was not full on this mid-week evening).\\n\\nThe menu is fairly simple (and always has been from what I remember) focusing your attention on seasonal variations and longstanding favorites. This is one of my favorite local menus as I've never been a fan of \\"the phone book\\" that you see at some restaurants. I guess the cynic in me thinks that the kitchen is unlikely to be good at everything when a menu is that large, plus I think it makes things harder for a diner when there are too many options.  On the front there are Starters, Share Plates, Big Salads, Main Courses, Sides, and a Daily feature. The back has desserts at the top and is mostly covered by a wine-by-the-glass list, with options for a few specialty cocktails and beers. \\n\\nI opted for a Sierra Nevada Beer Camp Tropical IPA (which I'm guessing is their answer to the most excellent Creature Comforts Tropicalia). The beer was very good but still not quite the offering from Athens - still a great accompaniment to the Flash Fried Calamari appetizer (apple cider mignonette, cocktail sauce).  The peppery-sweet/sour mignonette was an excellent foil to the hot/fried calamari - loved that. We were also give an excellent bread and shared a perfectly-tossed Caesar salad (another pet peeve of mine is when the Caesar is overly-dressed - this one was just right).\\n\\nFor dinner we selected the Guinness Braised Brisket - horseradish mashed potatoes, roasted carrots and green beans; and the Gulf Shrimp and Cheese Grits - field peas, soppressata salami, tomatoes, cheddar grits. Both entrees were fairly hearty with good but not huge portions and delicious. The brisket was fork-tender and full-flavored. The grits to me had a bit too much tomato - the acids seemed to overpower the grits quite a bit and the peas were a bit too al dente but I'm sure most would like them a lot.\\n\\nFor dessert we went with coffee and the Carrot Cake - walnut carrot cake, cream cheese icing, vanilla pineapple compote. It was solid but I've had better, maybe slightly dry. If it sounds like I'm being picky, well yes I am. I used to eat here quite a bit so I'm probably over-sensitive having not visited in many years so take it with a grain of salt.\\n\\nFinally on the service - once someone came by the table everything was fine but that was one problem. I don't believe the server was aware that the table had been given to her - we could see her straightening up a table across the room. We sat for 10 minutes before someone realized that we needed attention. The second item, and perhaps this is my final pet peeve - the tables next to us had an overly-attentive server that spent a lot of time talking to the couple there (sounded like at least one was a friend) - so we had someone's back to us for most of that 10 minutes - seems like she could have been more aware of what was going on around her and figured out that we needed some service.\\n\\n\\nSo I'm giving this 4/5 for the food and 3/5 for the service.\\n\\n(also posted to my food blog)"},{"name":"Neptune Oyster","address":"63 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"AMAZING!!!

The steak needed a little more salt and it was a little dry, at least the steak was better than the chicken. Chicken was a little flavorful but it was really dry.

Neither of us was really impressed but thought at least part of that was due to the fact that it was to go even tho it was only about a 10 minute ride from restaurant to plate. Decided to give them another try today since there was no line when we drove by heading to another place. I didn't know it was order at the counter and set up and bus your own table so that was an unpleasant surprise. Also no espresso machine so no fancy coffees which was also unexpected. I will say I didn't really read reviews about what service was offered so had no idea what to expect but thought it would have been full service with good coffees which is what I like in a breakfast joint. We ordered the Pine State Club, The Reggie Deluxe and a biscuit and gravy and waters. $28.50. And once again not impressed. The biscuit was good but not the best I have had and the gravy tasty but barely warm. The chicken on the club plate was dry, the batter fell off and really nothing special. The fried green tomato was about the size of a silver dollar and was mushy with no real flavor. Actually nothing on the club plate stood out as even really good. It was just ok. The Reggie was ok but not enough gravy to finish with the sandwich. It was all ok but not spectacular for us like we had heard and read about. We both decided there was nothing in food or service that would lure us back. We just didn't get why so many raves and high marks.

My friends love this place so we finally decided to order some pizza to go and drove to Salem. I called in the order and got the Picard pizza. The man on the phone said about 25 minutes. Parked and walked and that was around 20 minutes. I loved the decor. It looks like a fun place to eat at and I loved the unique pizza names so kudos to them for atmosphere and innovation. We went to the counter and they said it'd be \\"a few more minutes\\" so we went across the street and browsed the comic book store for about ten minutes. Returned, and it was still \\"a few minutes\\" which made me nervous as I saw tons of pizzas coming out. About 10 minutes later, they gave us the pizza. Drove home, opened the box and we were so incredibly disappointed. It clearly had sat under a heating lamp for a significant amount of time. Almost cold, hard toppings and incredibly burnt on the bottom. We couldn't finish the pizza and even the dog rejected the toppings. I tried heating it up a piece in the microwave and while that helped a bit with softness I just couldn't get past the totally burnt bottom, hard as a rock ham and way too much rosemary. Someone went crazy with the rosemary shaker and it really took away from an already blah pizza by adding little branches of spice every few bites. I'm really disappointed.

I love the French/Indo fusion food.  Creative, flavorful, packed with complexity.  Portion sizes are what restaurant food *should* be:  not piled on the plate in too-big portions that US diners see everywhere.  I've never left feeling stuffed, but I've never left hungry either -- which is the way we (in this way-too-obese country) *should* eat.  The price isn't cheap, but isn't outrageous; about in-line with other good downtown Boston restaurants.\\n\\nA couple of other thoughts:\\n- We arrived for an 8pm dinner on Friday night.  We were the first ones there....  Granted, it was August 13, and I'd wager much of the town was out of town.  Nonetheless, if you're an old fart and like to eat at 6:30 or 7, plan on eating in an empty-ish restaurant.  (It did start to pick up around 8:30 or 9; I'm suspecting this is because many of the eaters wanted to finish just as the place got converted to a club.)\\n- At about 10:30 we started to get serious pressure from the staff to wind it up, because as 11pm approaches, they pull out all the tables/chairs, and turn the main level into a club.\\n- We stayed for the club, hoping to dance.  But the music wasn't to my taste.  Mine runs to straight \\"deep\\" house (a'la Ben Watt, or that which can be found widely in London).  This was classic US hiphop.  While the crowd was probably not the college crowd - most were probably from 25-40 - the music was definitely appealing to the hiphop mentality, so we bugged out.  Had a good house DJ been spinning, I'd have stayed.  (Yeah, I'm 50, but I'd have stayed and danced anyway.  It's the music that counts - not the age.)"},{"name":"Match","address":"94 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"An acquaintance invited myself and a group to join him for dinner\\nat Match 'round May 2006.

I had been here before a couple years back and thought it was decent, so my friend and I walked over. Not really sure what the deal is with service. There's a bar with a bartender, and then counter service with food. I'm pretty chill as a customer, we weren't in any rush. (One of my biggest pet peeves is to hear from people they were in a rush while eating out...like...go to f*ing taco bell aight?!) So my friend and I go to order at the counter. The girl was really nice and she said she'd check us out at the register. Seemed like it was more expensive than I had remembered, but no problem...Everyone knows about the increased minimum wage and rent spikes. We say we just want water and check out. I don't know if it's table service after a certain time? Not sure.\\n\\nWe go find a seat, and wait for the food. It was pretty quick, about 10 minutes. We had just ordered water, but didn't realize it was a water station type of thing, so when I asked the cashier when she brought the food, she pointed in the direction of the water station. Cool, no problem, grab some waters and sit down. I ordered a Verde chicken taco salad, that was pretty delicious. It was the lunch special for just under $10. I'd get it again. We got cheese dip, salsa, and chips. The cheese sauce had some spice, but was super greasy and chunky, as if it hadn't been heated up enough. It's cheese, so cheese is good regardless, but it was definitely not very appetizing. My friend said her chicken relleno (spelling?) Was ok. She also got a taco. All in all it was fine, but there are definitely better mexican food options in Portland. It's pretty pricey for what it is, so I think you're just paying for eating in the city?

It was recommended by the staff on our first visit and I definately enjoyed it enough to order it again.\\n\\nFor appetizers we started with cheesy naan and a chutney sampler. If you're ordering just one appetizer, the three chutney sampler is definately more than you need, but I like to have a little variety and it's moderately priced at $5. We went with the spicey red pepper, the red onion and date, and the mint-yogurt. I dig 'em all, but found myself going back to the mint yogurt chutney most often. \\n\\nI definately could have ripped into some samosas or other appetizers, but I actually wanted to be hungry enough to enjoy my entree.\\n\\nIf you haven't tried it, the pork vindalho is ridiculously awesome. The slow-cooked Draper Valley pork shoulder is so tender, grandma could easily eat this without her dentures. It's sweet, with a hint of curry, just incredibly savory and flavor-packed. The accompanying jasmine rice pyramid also has a ton of flavor.\\n\\nThe nightly special Friday was mahi mahi with a spinach curry that I had to try. The mahi mahi was nicely seared and plated on top of the rich and creamy spinach curry. The curry was very well done, giving you intense flavor without beating you over the head with spice. Steamed, shredded carrots topped the dish and was part of a perfect bite that involved the curry, the mahi and a little rice. I'll always be in awe of chefs who pull out just the right complimentary vegetable to finish off a dish.\\n\\nI love the look and feel of this place and i definately wouldn't mind sitting for an hour or so at the modernly designed bar with one of their specialty cocktails waiting for a table. The wait staff is laid back and friendly and knows the menu well.\\n\\nThis place is a jewel on Clinton street, a neighborhood I look forward to getting to know even better.\\n\\nIf you're looking for typical Indian food, Vindalho might not be the place to satisfy that craving.

Meaning it was quite well done instead.\\n\\nBecause of how long it took to receive my steak, waiting for a new one that was actually cooked medium was just not going to happen. They do get brownie points for removing the 29.00 (a fair price if you ask me) from the bill, but I wish it was done right (I was quite hangry at that point).\\n\\nDespite an initial slow to get served experience, our server ended up being quite amazing and providing a solid experience. The crudo was delicious (we got two - the yellowtail and the striped bass) and the crostini was also quite great (with ricotta with strawberry and lardo). The octopus was good - a nice large thick piece - but the overall prep didn't speak to me for some reason. I think my husband enjoyed the octopus though.

I saw some Cioppino and hamburgers coming out of the kitchen as well. The place is small and the servers hustle, but we were VERY well taken care of. \\n\\nWe started with 6 oysters and ended up ordering another 6. It's surprisingly easy to knock back a dozen oysters and they were all magical. We had a few drinks while waiting for our entrees, lobster roll and the Sunday special fish tacos. The fish tacos, while pricey at $26 are obscenely sized and good! Theres no way to eat them as tacos with the amount of fish they serve, but that didn't bother me. The pico/slaw is the best pico/slaw ever. I make a lot of pico at home and never thought to mix it with slaw but it's brilliant and I'm stealing that idea. The cabbage brings a nice texture to the pico and when paired with the fish it was simply delightful. The lobster roll is every bit as good as it should be with the Yelp reputation Neptune has. We opted for the lobster roll served hot with butter rather than cold. This is a no nonsense lobster roll, it's a pile of lobster on a toasted buttered roll and there aren't many things better. The 2lbs of french fries that accompany the lobster roll were also great. \\n\\nWould I have enjoyed this place as much if I had to wait 2 hours? Hard to say for sure, but probably.

If you look at the menu and see prices of $45 and up, yeah, that can be considered a high price for some food. But it's not just a meal, it's dinner AND a show AND a tour guide...\\n\\nThis was my first time here. I had a groupon for a five course meal for two. It was a WHOLE lot of food! I was satisfied after the soup and full after the salad! The salad for two people came out on a platter crammed to the edges. It was just so much food! I pretty much only ate a leg from my Cornish Hen Tangine.\\n\\nMoroccan is a cuisine that can be different from American fare. The 5 course meal came with a Cornish Hen B'satti. That had cinnamon in it and was wrapped in a pastry shell and topped with powdered sugar and cinnamon. I tried it. It was ok. My friend had been there before and had tried that before. She requested a vegetarian version which doesn't have the powdered sugar. I suggest you try that one if you're not so adventurous.\\n\\nOur waiter was excellent! He guided us through the menu. I'm allergic to apricot, a somewhat common ingredient in Moroccan cooking. So I asked a million and one questions. The waiter was patient and described everything in detail, told us about the traditions and everything.\\n\\nThen there was the show. Now, I've been to Greek and Indian restaurants with belly dancers and they were just meh. This was truly a SHOW! They came out three times in the nearly three hours we were there. (NOT an eat and run place!) They had dancers in each of the areas, so you had a great view of the fun. They first came out and just danced. Then one came out with what I call wings and put on a beautiful show. She later came out and did a routine with fire, even balancing a candle on her head!\\n\\nLike I said, it's not just dinner, it's an experience. Think about it. If you go to like the Cheesecake Factory, you order an app, dinner and dessert and that's gonna come out to about $45. And THEN you have to go to the movies for another $12 to be entertained. This is a value! (And there are often Groupons or something for here saving you 40-50%) \\n\\nOh, and the valet was free!

I absolutely love this small restaurant for its fresh oysters. You can never go wrong with Wellfleet and Island Creek. I tend to prefer salty oysters that can open crisp flavors of the ocean in my mouth. Seriously. I can eat oysters here all day long if they and my wallet let me. It is definitely worth 1.5+ hr wait. \\nYesterday, my boyfriend and I went lunch time to avoid wait for the table. We got there around noon and got seated in 17 minutes. Not too bad. Started with ritual dozen of oysters. They used to have this large jumbo shrimp cocktail from Indonesia which was insanely good and juicy but yesterday, they only had small shrimp from Florida. I am not sure what happened to big one, but the small one wasn't bad. Oysters were right on the point as usual. Yum. \\nToday, I noticed Mackerel on the menu. I was curious how the chef would cook the white fish with rather strong flavor. I grew up eating many Mackerel in Korea. In Korea, it is commonly grilled and served as whole fish. It was cheaper than other fish. I noticed that Mackerel is not as popular as Salmon or other red fish in America. I find that Americans like mild fish taste. This is all my personal opinion. But hey, I miss Mackerel. So for the first time in America, I ordered Mackerel that is not in sashimi form. I waited with mild nervousness. \\nTada! \\nAs expected from the name of the dish, there it was. The whole fish. Head to tail with fancy looking vegetables elegantly placed on the body of the fish. I was instantly excited for unknown reason. Maybe because I haven't seen a whole grilled fish on a dish for awhile? Was I that hungry? I still do not know. I picked up my fork and gently picked the salad and tasted it. Perfect mix of olive oil, sweet and spicy flavors. Then I got brave and broke the skin of the fish. Attack the belly! Soon my excitement went away when I saw fish bones:  not the big fat ones that you can pick out and not worry about, but little ones that make you debate if you want to spit out or just chew harder with intentions. I suddenly remembered why I have been eating salmon filet at restaurants. So much easier to eat. The first poke of Mackerel bone reminded me of panic moment that I had when I was in 5th grade. I didn't know what to do with bones in the fish that was served for lunch at school, so I called my mom at home crying. Formal crying 5th grade child is now at a fancy restaurant in North End supposedly older and wiser faced with the same fish.  No, I did not cry at Neptune's yesterday. I gracefully took the bones out and gently place them on a small side dish. I am quite happy with how I handle the fish on my dish in public place. The fish was grilled to perfection. It was cooked thoroughly but without any dryness in the meat or skin. Each bite had perfect moisture level and flavors that were just right. Then the sauce! I never thought that Mackerel would be that good in olive oil. It took the strong fishy edge off gently without stripping the original flavors. The balance between tomatoes, small potatoes (fingerlings), garlic, chile pepper, orange and other spices with Mackerel was an epic symphony rather than battle. Seriously. There were four little pieces of oranges and that was just perfect. One piece more would have been too sweet. \\nNeptune's does not need another five star review from me. However, I want to applaud the chef for putting Mackerel on the menu and delivering it so well. I am surprised that it was only $24. After yesterday, I would probably pay more for this. Thank you for this amazing experience Neptune. If you are not scared of whole fish head staring at you and small bones poking you, be courageous and try it.

I was also surprised that after over an hour, some meats never came by. I had to ask twice to get service while the table next to me received more choices. Definitely not recommended. Go to the competitor nearby, they are little more expensive but well worth it."},{"name":"Efrain's of Boulder Mexican Restaurant & Cantina","address":"1630 63rd St, Ste 10","city":"Boulder","stars":"4","text":"I'd say this restaurant was an absolute surprise in Boulder.

Great ambiance, great beer list, sometimes very good BBQ.  Excellent smoked turkey dinner.  I don't know what happened, but I assume that the place has changed management, and the new owners or managers are trying to pinch pennies in a way that is going to ultimately destroy this business.  Prices have skyrocketed, which wouldn't be a problem if quality and portions have correspondingly shrunk to alarming degrees.  The quality of the food has also suffered.  They have gotten rid of a few menu items that I used to go there for - the Arkansas ribs and the turkey dinner.  I was told that the Arkansas were \\"a pain in the ass to prepare.\\"  The turkey dinner has also disappeared, due to its not being cost effective.  I had a drink there with a friend a few months ago, and a regular told me the bar was so (uncharacteristically to me, based on my experience) empty because they had decided to discontinue the 1/2 price appetizers.  Message to Redbones - you may coast for a while on your reputation, but you will eventually sink and go under.  BTW, the service has also gone way downhill also.

If I'm going to spend $15 on food from a truck--which I do, for example at East Side King--I really want the food to be great and to be at least full afterwards. This really hit neither.\\n\\nThe roll is a decent, but not amazing small hoagie roll. You get a 1/4 lb of lobster, which is really good, but it's always served cold which just detracts from how it tastes and how it makes you feel.

Incredible seafood and amazing oysters. If you enjoy oysters, don't bother with ANY other place in beantown. This place is tiny, and they don't take reservations, so your best bet is to go early and give the hostess your phone number if there's a wait.

Also, Neptune has the best variety of beverages in town if you enjoy unique and local micro-brews (mostly bottles) and perfectly paired wines and spirits. Try one of their signature belini's (champagne and muddled fruit) if you like something sweet! Yes, the lobster roll here is ridiculously good, but so is everything else!

Five giant stars, we got here on a Friday night and bought a happy hour bottle of wine, sat at the bar until a window seat became available. The window seat was about a 30 minute wait and worth it. We started with a fresh sashimi appetizer, it had no rice and was all fish, excellent! Ordered another bottle of wine and munched on the bread basket... Dinner was a 10 ounce filet, mashed potatoes, fresh green beans, side of Mac and cheese and my fianc√© had saut√©ed onions ordered which he topped his filet with. Our server was AWESOME, our dinner was leisurely and do not feel rushed. This was one of he best dining experiences I've ever had.

We've been looking at it...finally tried it for Sunday breakfast.  Menu seemed good...lots of choices.  Place, itself, not exactly the cleanest I've seen but a little kitchy, which I kind of like.  Very crowded.  Door open, no screen...so flies buzzing around.\\n\\nBut the food, alas, just doesn't measure up.  My omelet had watery spinach among its ingredients, which really ruined it.  I love spinach omelets, but this was awful.  Home fries cold, soggy and greasy.  Might have been fairly good if they were hot and crisped up.  Toast also cold, rubbery and barely toasted.  \\n\\nMy breakfast came a full five minutes before my husband's, so it was a surprise when everything on his plate was cold.\\n\\nHe had the 1-1-1-1.  One of each...bacon, sausage, egg and pancake.  Bacon undercooked,  Sausage precooked and barely warmed up, so it was rather hard and tasteless.  Egg OK.  Pancake cold, rubbery, not pleasant.  He waited forever for a coffee refill.  \\n\\nNot a very pleasant experience.  Felt somewhat ripped off, not very welcomed or pampered.

Although I feel like saying, 'Meh, I've had better', I feel like it is more deserving of a bump up in stars, so Luke's becomes an A-OK in my book.  \\n\\nYou'll find Luke's on Exeter street, on the side of Boston Public Library (which is beginning to look fab with renovations, btw!).  The door was propped open by a lobster trap (clever!), and the place was already packed for lunch.  It's a pretty fast paced environment: Order at the counter and take to find your own seat or elsewhere to go.  Luckily,  we were able to snag a window seat for two: keep an eye out, tables and seating gets taken quick!\\n\\nWe ended up ordering a Taste of Maine (1/2 lobster roll, 1/2 crab roll, 1/2 shrimp roll, 2 crab claws, 1 drink, choice of chips or slaw, and a pickle, $24), and a small cup of Lobster Bisque ($8).  The drinks available are pretty hipster to say the least, all in beer-esque bottles, ranging from house made blueberry lemonade, variations of Maine's Root Soda, and Green Bee Craft beverages.  \\n\\nOut of the three rolls, lobster ranks first, crab second and shrimp last.  All of the rolls had similar flavor, on a buttered hot dog bun with little to no mayo at all.  The cole slaw was ok, more like a cole slaw salad, as it was lacking the creaminess and tartness that I'm used to.  The crab claws were good, but tiny, and were accompanied by cocktail sauce.  The one true highlight was probably the lobster bisque: it had good flavor and a fair amount of lobster chunks swimming in yummy broth which was worth every penny.\\n\\nOverall, I've definitely had better lobster rolls, both in Maine and n Boston. I like the idea that you can sample all Luke's has to offer, however, the variety isn't enough to keep this girl coming back."},{"name":"Luke's Lobster Back Bay","address":"75 Exeter Street","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I don't mind paying a lot for a lobster roll, but I do mind when they skimp on the lobster meat.

There was an interesting Asian twist to the dish, and the sweet/spicy combination was quite pleasing. I ordered the filet mignon, which was tender (as filets should be) and filled with as much flavor as I've ever experienced in a steak.

(Tables have small candle in the middle, waitress placed basket squarely next to the candle). No one from the bar came over to help to distinguish fire. Instead, when fire died out on its own, a manager ran over and started screaming for the group to \\"Get out! Stop setting fires in my bar!\\" People were stunned, and tried to explain what happened, but the manager was adamant for the group to leave. After a few more futile attempts to explain to the manager that group was wrongly accused, we had no choice but to leave.

Some of the freshest, must succulent raw fish we've ever had. We had Gyoza to start and they were fantastic. Next was a sashimi trio which was out of this world.

First impressions are critical and ours was not a good one so we most likely won't go back. The food was okay. The sausage was hot but the rest of the dish was only warm. The service was marginal. At first I thought it was because there was not enough wait staff. We got our food in a decent amount of time, but after we finished, we waited and waited for a return visit. Our waitress spent a lot of time standing at the bar (waiting for food orders I assume). Instead of standing at the bar doing nothing, how about being more attentive with other customers. She would get an order, deliver it, and then go back to the bar and just stand there. We ended up waiting for over 20 minutes after we finished eating for our check. And when the check came, it was with a tablet that didn't work (out of range or something and we had to wait again). I think the waitress could tell we weren't pleased because she offered up excuses like \\"there is only one cook tonight for some reason\\". What on earth does that have to do with us?
