My wife and I each got a different broth type. They were both amazing for very different reasons. The heavier broth feels like comfort food and is great for cooler winter times. The clear broth is surprisingly flavorful, yet still light enough to not bog you down, supper awesome summer-time broth. Being a sunny winter day, we appreciated both of them. The server was awesome as was the check-in lady. The wait is terrible, but that's kind of a good thing, shows they know how to make food! Also you give them your number and they'll text you when you're up next for a table, so you can go wander around. The tea is great (oolong) and the toppings in the ramen are awesome. It was our first time, so we we didn't add anything not knowing how the broth would be, next time I'm adding mushrooms. We were almost done and we got offered something amazing, $2 for more broth or noodles in the bowl. This is perfect for my wife and I, I prefer more noodles and she's always loved broth, so woot on them. We did decline that option however as we were quite full. \\n\\nWhy only 4 stars? Well, we got calamari there and it was $6.50 for a small plate of very chewy food. With our ramens being $12.50 and MASSIVE, there just wasn't any doubt that the appetizer was a flop. It was not very flavorful and that was just unfortunate. \\n\\nTLDR: Ramen and Oolong Tea are badass, avoid the calamari appetizer."},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Best place to go in Portland for some spice.

Just a couple of fried eggs, fresh salad stuff, and fish sauce.  Also had the herb salad and phad see ew, all good.  My sticky rice was served lukewarm, and seemed like it had been sitting around for quite some time.  The coffee was strong.\\n\\nWe arrived in the mid-afternoon, so there wasn't much of a wait.  Service was nice, but very slow. The portions are indeed small for the relatively high prices, but I guess if they're always packed with diners...  All told, I'm looking forward to eating here again, but I'm not sure when that will happen as I wouldn't wait the hour+ it seems usually necessary to get a table."},{"name":"Moonshine Patio Bar & Grill","address":"303 Red River St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Tried this place for the first time a couple days ago.

I don't like kale so I just pushed it to the side and it was fine. Several people at the table had chicken and waffles.  I had the pan-fried chicken almondine which I really annjoyed.  \\nMy only suggestion- when you see people waiting for over an hour- offer a drink or something to snack on.

I ordered my usual - the massaman curry with chicken and an order of tofu summer rolls. The tofu summer rolls and peanut sauce were better than most of the other Thai places I have tried. The massaman curry was delicious. The only reason I did not give 5 stars is that it was not quite spicy enough for me! However, the food was an excellent value for the price.

I dine there at least twice a week. Why? They offer demi portions. The food is delicious and affordable. They use steam heat. The sauces are lovely. The music is good. They have beer and wine and Ginger Crush and Almond Joy. The people watching is fantastic. You see not only the beautiful people, but  the Cantabrigian element at ease in their natural habitat, but make no mistake about it: Life Alive  works because the owners bring a bit of Lowell scrappiness and know-how to the People's Republic. The staff is ever-cheerful and pleasant in a way that's sincere and well-balanced, never  awkward or uncomfortable (like one of the waiters at Veggie Galaxy when he asked me where I lived). There is often a long line to the door, but service is brisk. Like the Paramount, Life Alive offers first come, first served seating and it works. A table will open up when you need it. Just don't be one of those people who grabs a table before you wait in line to place your food order.

In fact, I've found MANY of them. They hide behind what must be intended as a Mexican  fruit juice and smoothie operation.  And if those are as good as their tacos are, well....\\n\\nIn a city which has turned tacos into weird personal fetishes such as \\"Dirty Sanchez\\" or \\"Trailer Trash\\" or \\"Taco Loco\\", La Fruta Feliz stands proudly and exclaims: \\"Lengua Res!\\". Yes, there is nothing remotely \\"specialty\\" or \\"novelty\\" or \\"fusion\\" about La Fruita Feliz. What you get are amazingly soft, yet lite, maize tortillas, ever so browned in places, filled with the most amazing, yet straightforward fillings. They offer flour too....\\n\\nI've already mentioned the beef tongue, albeit in Spanish. If you have never had tongue, you need a new taco joint (and a new girlfriend). This meat is amazingly soft and supple. And the spicy preparation is amazingly mellow and seductive.\\n\\nThe BP oil spill has NOTHING on the Barbacoa here. Yes, your Barbacoa taco will need to be eaten quickly before the orange oils saturate the tortilla and penetrate your skin. But not TOO quickly, because everything here is served piping hot. And I must say that this is very rare in the Austin taco scene.  But that oil...oh geeze, it binds that barbacoa into a meaty, tasty lump of heaven. If you're into it, you will like it.\\n\\nThe Egg and Chorizo taco deserves top scores as well for being served hot and being just so darn good. Unlike the Barbacoa, the Chorizo and Egg mixed together are decidedly NOT oily. And that is a good thing. You just get the amazing flavors of the sausage, spicy and mellow without any distractions dripping down your hand. Sorry Julio's, you have just been dethroned.\\n\\nLet me end with the Sopes. The thick masa substrate is a thing of wonder in itself. It, too, is rich in flavor and texture. And the toppings, including a truly remarkable sour cream which tastes home made, are all fresh and wonderful. \\n\\nI've done something today that I haven't done in a while. I over ate. And there was NOTHING. I mean NOTHING which fell short of perfection. Even my wife, who has worked many years in Mehico, was  impressed. \\n\\nThe dining room itself was large and airy with a down-home BBQ-joint-like feel. You can order at the counter or sit at a table and get a waitress. Your choice. The waitstaff at first seems to project a \\"No English spoken here\\" vibe, but they ultimately open up to help your gringo ass out if/when needed. I always start out in Spanish and regress back to English with my tail between my legs.\\n\\nOK, so I didn't venture into the juice/smoothie elements other than sharing an OJ with my peeps.

It's all great and ready to bring you good cheer.\\n\\nSo, here's the rules for bulk juice cleanse orders as I've had the frustrating experience of finding out, the hard way:\\n\\n- You MUST order online.  The cut off is 3pm.  The website is a bit confusing, so highly recommend you check it out beforehand, otherwise you'll be frantically clicking every button trying to get your order placed. ( I can't comment as to whether or not it's ok to order in store.  I've had my own experiences with this, and found online is just the best way to go, and the way they prefer.  You might experience headache otherwise.)\\n\\n- You order 4 quarts of juice.  They can all be the same or each different.  That's fine, but if you build your own, not all the juice cleanses are listed.  So, you have to pick one, then in the notes of your order, state the correction IE:  \\"In place of the 4 quart of Apex Twins, I want Liver Cleanse\\".\\n\\n- If you realize you cannot make it to pick up your juice on the day you specified in your online order, you MUST call.  They will throw it out otherwise.  While this isn't always the case in our experience, it does happen and they state that they have no space to store bulk juice in their fridge.  Totally ok with this, just wish it had been clearly stated in more than just our invoice. (which I didn't receive when being told this, it was only later when it was resent that I saw this rule).\\n\\nI've been told by Leilani that the bulk juice orders are new and they are working out the kinks.  I wont quit ordering my juices, but getting to a point of feeling like I've got a grasp on the situation, has been trying.  I hope that this review helps others have a more positive experience, with the right expectations.  As I told the girl when I went to pick up my most recent order:  No relationship worth having, that doenst have it's ups and downs.  I wont quit you JL, just keep trying to make it better.

I cannot get enough of this place and now since moving to Pittsburgh, I miss it even more.\\n\\nThis is a small cafe, located in Central Square - a short walk from the T stop. I have been here for lunch, evening coffee and of course weekend brunch. It is recommended you make reservations (either in person or on the phone) for the weekend brunch - they do take them up to a month in advance. However, there might be a wait even then when you arrive due to the size of the place.\\n\\nThe staff is super friendly - the owners are a couple - the husband works at the front of the house, while his wife manages the kitchen. I have to say they do a good job in running this place. The staff is super friendly and even though the place is packed for brunch, I have never felt rushed.\\n\\nThey serve freshly squeezed orange juice (excellent) and a wide variety of coffees and specialty mochas. Most of the drinks can be read off the menu on the wall. As for the food, where do I start...... Notable items for me are:\\n\\n\\"Everything but the Kitchen Sink\\" sampler - this is a lot of food on a plate - waffles topped with corned beef hash (a must try), bacon, eggs, sausage, home fries.\\n\\nSteak and Lobster BLT Benedict - the lobster and steak are perfectly cooked and their hollandaise sauce is creamy and delicious. (Lobster Eggs Benedict is another good choice)\\n\\nFig Prosciutto & Goat Cheese Omelet - this one is for the healthy food lovers that don't mind a little sweet and a little salty. \\n\\nAnd my favorite, the Corned Beef Hash Eggs Benedict - if you have never tried corned beef hash, this is where you try it. The eggs are poached perfectly on top of an English muffin to make an ultimate brunch item for me.\\n\\nIf you like to end your brunch on a sweet note, I would recommend getting a side of the French toast (you can order half portion sizes) - the Blueberry Lemon and Nutella are the best IMO but you can't go wrong with any of the choices.\\n\\nThere is plenty of street parking, outdoor seating in the summer, friendly staff, great food and the opportunity to hear local bands perform in the cafe - what more can you ask for!!!"},{"name":"Boston Common Coffee Co.","address":"515 Washington St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Another quality coffee shop in Boston that brews some very good roasts.

I'd only been to ICOB before it was ICOB (some other seafood restaurant), so I've been meaning to check it out for a while. Since we were in the area, the two of us decided to stop in at 6 on a Sat for dinner and it was already wicked packed (because of Harvard v Yale perhaps?). We were told we'd need to wait 1.5 hours for a table, but ended up only waiting about 15-20 minutes before we were seated (not sure if that was a fluke, but we were certainly happy about it as we didn't want to wait longer than like 30 mins).\\n\\nThe bread and honey butter you start with is very tasty, and I like the interesting curated beer list, especially the Night Shift Goze which goes perfectly with seafood (although everything is $1-3 too much). \\n\\nFor our meal, we decided to get a bunch of smaller items so we could sample a variety of food from the menu. As expected, the raw bar is excellent, and I recommend you focus most of your $ and attention here; oysters, littlenecks, and (ginormous!) cocktail shrimp were all perfectly on point. My small order of fried clams were tasty, although not spectacular: they had a lot of flavor from the batter (onion powder perhaps?) and were clearly very fresh, but they were on the verge of being too salty, and the clams hardly had any bellies (and the existing bellies were very small). The accompanying fries were nice though, hand cut and skin on. The unshelled PEI mussles with chorizo had nice flavor and was a good-sized portion, but these particular mussles were on the fishier side and were also very small for PEI mussles (but maybe that's a seasonal thing?). The side of baked beans was just right, and the side of buttered carrots were flavorful but were a little too al dente for my personal taste (the boy likes them that way though so he was fine with them).\\n\\nI think overall, we felt (with the exception of the superb raw bar which is where they shine) that ICOB puts up some solid food and we had no real complaints, but that we'd had better or more memorable versions of these particular food items elsewhere. I wouldn't hesitate to return, especially since the service was excellent and the seafood obviously screaming fresh, but I just wouldn't expect to be blown away (but maybe they really shine with their entrees, who knows?)."},{"name":"Shigezo Izakaya","address":"910 SW Salmon St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"We popped in here on First Thurs for a bite to eat during the 110 degree day before a movie at the art museum. \\n\\nWe were seated prompty (we sat ourselves in the bar) and Mark was our server.

Just look for the big giant orange-pinkish building, and drive towards it. It's on John Young Pkwy and Central Fla Pkwy.\\n\\nCheck in was easy enough. Go up to the front desk, give them your credit card and your name, they give you your room key and some other information about the hotel, and...done.\\n\\nFirst things first, my hot water in the shower didn't work. At first, I didn't really care because I'm in Florida where I'd want a cool shower, but then it became too cold...kinda like skinny dipping in Antarctica, if you could imagine that...so, called the front desk, left for dinner, it was fixed by the time I came back.\\n\\nThe room we got, which was the cheapest room they offered, was a little bit too small for 3 people. There is a non-functioning wet bar refrigerator in the room, and you have to request a working refrigerator, should you need one. There is no microwave inside the room, so forget about bringing your instant cooking noodles. Also, some of the channels on the TV were fuzzy and not HD.\\n\\nBreakfast was included in my stay at the Citron restaurant, and thank god it was included, because if it wasn't, it's $27 to eat there for breakfast.

I realized after standing there and watching the guy before me order, that it was basically like you order at Chipotle, only with Italian fare. \\n\\nI ordered the Select Two deal during happy hour (4pm) and decided on a small Piada with steak and Lobster Bisque.  I added an artichoke Piada stick!   I didn't know what complimentary vegetables to add to my piada to make it as delectable as possible, so I requested everything I could see!  You get angel hair pasta (though I think they should have about 3 featured pastas for variety) in a wrap that includes your meat and veggies. HEAVENLY!   Plenty bang for the buck.  Arriving just in time for Happy Hour provided me with a $.45  discount so my bill was $.27 under $10.   \\n\\nThe \\"Likers\\" on Facebook have been begging for locations outside of Columbus, namely Cincinnati and Cleveland.

We were all enjoying a bottle of champagne when (their wine manager?) brought out the bottle of red I ordered. I politely asked him if he could maybe open it up to let it breathe and then pour it later after we were finished with our champagne. He very smugly replied that that doesn't do anything and it's best to get get it in the glass and proceeded to pour. I found this extremely pushy, inconsiderate, and rude. Honestly, we're guests at your restaurant. I don't think I would have been out of bounds if I asked him to shake the bottle up and serve it over ice, we're paying for it. I understand that it was a busy night in the holiday season and they had more physical tables in there than they have normally (all of them full), but this is no excuse. I think it was just because they were just so busy that night, but I could also have taken it that they were just trying to push more wine on us. In fact now that I think about it, at the time I still had an unfinished glass of red in front of me from the bar.\\n\\nI think part of being a good sommelier/wine director/buyer/etc. is being helpful without isolating or belittling your guests with an assumed lack of knowledge/appreciation. How about offering to decant it instead?\\n\\nI didn't say anything at the time because I didn't want to take away from the celebration in any way and I'm sure the grad didn't even notice.

To its defense, the Po Boy had a great breading and nice crunch but alas it's not served with hot sauce as an available condiment. We asked the waiter to bring some when we dropped the meal off, but 15 minutes (and half a po boy later) we were finally able to get some by asking the person manning the pass (in case anyone's wondering, it came in a small metal dish but I suspect it was Louisiana Crystal Hot Sauce).\\n\\nTo be fair, it looks to still be getting its feet under it and still has that 'more waiters than clients' thing going where a lot of times you see people milling about with no idea of where to go (granted over to my table with a drink and the hot sauce would've been nice)\\n\\nAll in all, Bistro Marquee has a nice menu and a lot of potential.

The classic to-get is definitely the black squid ink pasta. It's handmade, savory and flavorful. It just keeps me coming back for more. However, one of the three visits it was overcooked. I love the combination of the swordfish with sun dried tomatoes and mushroom. It's cooked in either a vodka or red sauce and for someone who doesn't prefer to eat marinara sauce, this is not as heavy. The swordfish also comes with a side of pasta or salad. I would say the portions here are quite fair, and even on the bigger side for about $20-25 per entree. \\n\\nThe flip side to this amazing food is the service and the wait. The wait can be so long sometimes (I've waited for as long as 45 minutes) and it's even worse when you have to stand in line outside no matter what the weather is like because they do not take your name down. This restaurant is TINY - probably fits about 22 customers and oftentimes, you'll be sitting next to a stranger with your friend across the table - which is fine with me, but if you don't like that then you'd have to wait longer for one of the few smaller tables. I love that this restaurant has an open kitchen and you can watch the chef fire up your dishes with wine. It's so cozy in here.\\n\\nThe service is a hit or miss. Sometimes it's amazing and you get water refills and free bread. The last time I came here, the waitress forgot the bread and we had to ask for it when our entrees were served.

If I had to rate their service I would lean towards a 1 star rating.

Their first hostess when they opened was strange and had boundary issues (don't lean over me or touch my food please).  The second one seemed like an OSU student and she was fine but didn't last.  The current one committed so many restaurant sins on a Saturday night I stopped counting BUT as someone who worked in restaurants for years here are some things I've learned - if you make a mistake admit it immediately  Your customers are not idiots - if you have served everyone else in a restaurant and then come back to our table 55 mins later and ask \\"Have I taken your order yet?\\" you need to cop to forgetting the table and ideally bring something else out quickly to snack on.  What you don't do is disappear for another 20 mins, then return stating \\"I put your order in 50 mins ago (which means you slept on it for 25 - the math is not working for you) and NEVER throw the chef under the bus by saying \\"Oh they are so slammed in the back they just don't know how to handle the number of orders but it should be out soon - do you still want to stay?\\" Oh my.  Paul was the chef at Barcelona and I know he and Hae Ran can cook their tushys off so it's not the orders - we ordered the simplest things off the menu - it's how you put the orders in (and we watched you serve all others).  And never ask if we want to stay - I mean - what the heck is that?  You're basically telling us you wouldn't stay but still not admitting you messed up nor trying to fix it.

She asked for a side of white rice for him and was inexplicably told that we had to order from the menu.

The eggs are well poached, the biscuits are fluffy and flaky. The sauces complement all the other ingredients quite well.\\n\\nSo why not a five star rating? Getting in can be a hassle. On Sundays they open at 10. To get seated at any time between 10 and noon, you must either call ahead to make a reservation or come at least 15 before 10. By 10:30 the is usually an hour long line at the door. The other problem is the main guy doing the seating and reservations. He has a particular way of working and if anything deviates from his method, he has trouble recovering. This means if you change the number of your party or request to be seated inside instead of outside or vice versa, He doesn't quite wrap his head around it and you eventually get regulated to the back of his head.\\n\\nBut overall, the food is worth the hassles if you can get in without the 1+ hour wait.

The food here is above stellar... Delicious in taste, diverse in selection, beautiful in presentation, authentic to its region and obviously skilled in preparation. A woman sitting next to me, who I reckon must be accustomed to this kind of cooking, was overheard saying to her boyfriend/husband/date, \\"See, this is how it really should taste. My cooking doesn't do it justice.\\"\\n\\nThe reviews I've seen on here are overwhelmingly complimentary toward the cuisine, and rightfully so. Everything they say is true: their signature chicken wings are over-the-top tasty and nearly everyone will find something appealing on Pok Pok's vast menu. I ordered the papaya salad (one of my all-time favorite dishes) and thought it was out of this world, second only to my favorite Thai restaurant in Chicago. We also tried a Pok Pok dessert and some of their yummy coffees. Everything was so mouthwatering, we definitely could've eaten more, paid more, stayed longer and walked away happier.\\n\\nBut nothing disappoints me more than a beautiful restaurant with a stellar chef at the helm, undermined only by its clueless Front of House staff. And Pok Pok's tragic flaw is undoubtedly its disoriented, disorderly and all around attention-deficit service. Restaurants like this are their own worst enemy, in that they take for granted the importance of the second reason people go out to eat. The first reason is so they can have someone cook for them. The second is so they can have someone serve the food. But service doesn't mean simply bringing food to the table. It means being hospitable: welcoming, guiding, caring. Our Server and his support staff were everything but...\\n\\nUpon his first visit to our table, he asks if this is our first time at Pok Pok. We say yes -- information which evidently has little impact on his approach toward service, as he offers us no information about the chef, his menu or his cooking style. He then asks if we can read the menu. Not, \\"Do you have any questions about the menu?\\" Or, \\"Can I offer you any recommendations from the menu?\\" Or even, \\"Let me know if there's anything on the menu you'd like clarified.\\" Just, \\"Can you read the menu?\\" After reassuring him that we can both read and understand the clear menu, he takes our drink order and promptly leaves. It is easily 10 to 15 minutes before our drinks arrive (the bartender brought them) and an additional 5 minutes thereafter before we see our Server again. We give him our order -- two dishes and an order of the wings. \\"Would you like those spicy?\\" he asks. Yes, we say, spicy would be great.\\n\\nCut to 10 minutes later: The table next to us, who arrived well after we did, get their food first and begin enjoying it. Whatever. No problem. We wait. \\n\\nAn additional 10 minutes later: Our Server returns to inform us that one of the dishes we ordered is now suddenly unavailable. He blames this on the kitchen, which I find in poor taste, explaining how they switched over from the lunch menu to the dinner menu in the middle of our reservation. \\"Not my problem,\\" as far as I'm concerned... We ordered off the menu we were given. Not only is this irritating, but the Server offers us little to no useful recommendations for a substitute, and appears hardly concerned with what is now turning into an unnecessarily drawn-out and scattered dinner experience. We decline a substitution and thank him kindly.\\n\\n2 minutes after that: Our Server returns to let us know we will be receiving one of our cocktails for free, as compensation for our mixed up order. Fine. Not that we weren't more than willing to pay for the drink, but it was still a thoughtful gesture. So we wait.\\n\\n3 minutes after that: The food arrives, smelling divine. Missing? Our wings. The Server returns and asks how everything tastes. \\"Delicious,\\" we say, \\"Looks like the only thing we need are the wings.\\" He responds, \\"Great. Would you like those spicy?\\" Uhm... Yes. Haven't we been over this? \\"Oh shit,\\" he says, \\"I totally forgot.\\" NOW we're growing impatient. \\n\\nEventually, the wings arrive, hot and saucy, with no extras and no apology. And you would think, that with this many errors on a table, our Server would give us his undivided attention from thereon. But this wasn't the case. Our dessert and coffee orders are taken by a hostess and a Back Waiter ends up ringing the bill, since we had tickets to a film and couldn't afford to wait much longer. Before we leave, the Server adds insult to injury, by reminding us about the complimentary cocktail (as if this remedies all inconveniences) and thanking us for coming. \\n\\nUnfortunately, that night we end up talking more about the shitty service than the dazzling food. Not the best birthday dinner I've ever had, but I just might return to give it a second chance."},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Extremely flavorful and spicy southeast Asian food here.

They were scooped out of a pot and then they put the cheese on top of it and put it in a broiler to toast everything. Not my idea of authentic Italian food. It was just okay, considering they were old reheated meatballs. And the salad that came with it was brown, so it was thrown out.

No idea what the hype is all about. There are much better places in town to spend that kind of money and actually come away feeling like you ate something. I have no problem paying money for something tasty and satisfying but this was ridiculous. Also the food is all brown and green. I know this may seem like an odd comment but every dish looked the same as the next. Also there were no great flavours to any of the dishes. Nothing stood out. . Had the salted caramel apple pie for dessert and thought it would make up for the mediocre diner. The pie had no salted anything in it and was overly sweet.

The look and attitude she gave me for not knowing that was astounding. She followed up with \\"cream and sugar?\\" - but what she really wanted to say was \\"cream and sugar, you moron?\\" Yuck x2.\\n\\nThat said, the bagel was really, really good; perhaps a wee bit burnt, but still one of the better bagels I've gotten in the North Shore area.

This isn't a deal breaker, but come on, it's 2014 - I can literally pay with my smartphone now, and these guys won't even let me pay with my debit card.\\n\\nSo basically - TL;DR - if you like good coffee, go to either Atomic Caf√© or Gusto Caf√©, both a 2 minute walk down the street.

The event's coordinator Kelly was incredibly responsive and prompt with her communications and they were flexible with everything.

We were also able to choose our own menu to suit our needs and our guests needs (we had a few Celiac and vegan guests who were totally taken care of!), and make sure it was food that reflected us as foodies. Ceviche's menu lends itself to tapas and that was an amazing choice for the wedding because everyone got to try a little of everything. We were also able to bring in our own desserts which were fantastic. We had an open bar package, which was amazing (hello sangria!) and they were able to keep the drinks flowing all night long.\\n\\nCeviche also provided everything from linens and menus, to setup and breakdown, and beautiful, candle lit rooms for no additional fees beyond the $100 room fee.

We arrived at 8pm (T troubles, surprise surprise).  They sat us without a hitch.  The dining bar was great--wide enough not to feel cramped with a nice view of the piles upon piles of fresh oysters.  The bartender doubled as our waiter and was incredibly attentive (yet not at all overbearing).  The ambiance was pleasing as well--nice high ceilings, brushed silver wall pieces---simple, modern, and classy.\\n\\nLibation menu held a perfect variety with plenty of wines and ~20 great beer options (girlfriend had a G. Schneider & Sohn Schieder Weisse and I had a Duvel Green).  \\n\\nOyster menu had ~10-12 options from both coasts.  Our waiter/bartender was very knowledgeable and seemed eager to help us with our selection--all were between $2 and $3. While we waited for them to arrive we were given nice, crusty bread with honey-cayenne butter with fleur de sel. \\n\\nThe Oysters were perhaps the best I've had.  Oysters in general fall into three categories for me: bad, very good, best.  Overwhelmingly when I eat oysters, they fall into the \\"very good\\" category.  These were well shucked, incredibly fresh, perfectly chilled, all with very different flavor profiles.  \\n\\nI got the lobster bisque while my girlfriend got the clam chowder.  Both of them were delicious, but non-traditional.  The clam chowder had almost a citrusy zing to it and the bisque was dark and almost nutty.  If you're feinding for a standard New England bisque or chowder you will be surprised, but not necessarily disappointing--both can stand on their merits.   \\n\\nThe Oyster Sliders are silly-good.  We will probably get them every time we go.  See pretty much every other review for the specifics.\\n\\nWe ordered the Lobster Roll but they had run out so we substituted the fried clams.  I was a little reluctant because a few of my fellow yelpers had deemed them simply \\"passible\\".  Amazingly, 5 minutes after we put the order in, the bartender told us that they had the lobster roll back so we would take the clams off the tab and we would get BOTH.  I was positively giddy at this point.  Fried clams were actually fantastic.  Light, crispy batter.  Tender, whole belly clams; and a hand cut fries and thick, rich tartar sauce.  Top 3 fried clams I've eaten I do believe.  The Lobster Roll was delicious but growing up in CT, my idea of the perfect roll is a hot buttered Lobster--not the lobster salad.  That said, the serving of lobster was generous, the dressing wasn't overwhelming and the bun was warm, soft and delicious.  We split it and they served it on two plates with our own sides of cole slaw and kettle-friend potato chips.\\n\\nI feel absolutely confident in my 5 star rating.

I got the lentil soup to start- spicy and hot.

For dessert, my boyfriend and I split that chocolate torte. \\n\\nIt was a perfect meal, we felt full but not stuffed, the flavors were fantastic and just spicy enough, and it was cheap.

Good enough that driving to the noodle house in SE Portland is something I do less often. Unfortunately, the roasted duck was poorly executed, dry and devoid of taste 2/5.

I highly suggest not to be distracted from the bright lights and ambience of other restaurants because the Daily Catch is the place to go! I came to Boston to visit a friend and on my last night we decided to head over for some great Italian food. Pulling up to the place you would think the Daily Catch is not more than just another restaurant. There was a line down the street, and after my friend and his friend who live in the city talked this place up no matter the wait time I was going to get my Daily Catch. Let me just remind you they do not take reservations and ONLY take cash. We waited in line for about a hour they will fill the small restaurant to capacity. After waiting over a hour we were finally seated, but once inside you realize you aren't there for the atmosphere just for the food. They have three workers run the entire restaurant that had about 6 -10 tables. You are able to watch them prepare your food. Now finally the food experience we decided to share between the three of us the Calamari Sampler which consisted of fried calamari,squid,shrimp and some fried haddock with some French fries. Everything was great really didn't need the French fries but oh well no reason to complain. They waiter suggested to use the red vinegar on the fried calamari..BOY WAS HE RIGHT. Being able to watch the chef prepare everything you knew it was fresh. Now on to the entrees my friend and I decided to share the Lobster Fradivalo which was a great call which also included an insane amount of lobster shrimp squid and mussels. It was so good we had to get more bread to dip in the sauce with linguini. I will attach a picture of the meal because trying to describe it won't do it justice. The other person in our group decided on the blacked calamari which was cooked to perfection and had a mild garlic taste and was amazing. If you could give this place 6 stars I would definitely do not judge this place from the outside but until you go inside a Italian dish from the Daily Catch you haven't experience true Boston Italian food. Must go and will always suggest to future Boston goers."},{"name":"Piazza Italia","address":"1129 NW Johnson St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I'm no good at these because I work in food service and know that a lot of negative reviews come from eternally angry people who don't realize most of their restaurant woes stem from them being awful guests. This generally means that if I'm not crazy about a restaurant I'll weigh my experience carefully to see if I was just hungry and grumpy or if it really was a bad experience that I want to warn other people about or, vice versa, if I was swept away by fabulous food and ignored terrible service or something of the like. So let me tell you that I've thought quite a bit about how to be as objective as possible when writing this review. \\n\\nThe decor is awesome. Very homey and there are jerseys staples to the ceiling but nice tablecloths and candles and such. Really gives the whole place a sense of casual elegance which I definitely can get behind. \\n\\nI got the pesto over penne and, if I'm being honest, I'd rate it a 3.5. It wasn't bad by any means but it just wasn't anything to write home about and if I were to go again I'd probably try something else. My boyfriend had something (the name of which I can't remember) with olive oil, garlic and red pepper flakes and it was hotter than either of us was expecting but that's not at all a problem for me since I love spicy foods. I'd rate his a 4, probably (although definitely don't recommend if you're not big on spice.)\\n\\nSo why'd this place get 5 stars? Service. INCREDIBLE service. Our server, Victorio (\\"Just Victor out there, though,\\" he said, gesturing to the window) came over promptly and took our orders and stayed awhile to make conversation, asking us how our night was going and if we were just visiting. I'm from Southern California so I don't know dining customs here, but I'm fairly certain patrons where I'm from would get mad that the server wasn't running to immediately put in the order. I personally loved that he took a few minutes to get to know us. He didn't overstay his welcome at all and just chatted for awhile about how long we'd be visiting. Once he'd gone to put the order in, I kid you not, our food was out in maybe 10 minutes. MAYBE. It felt closer to 5. Once we ate, he brought us a free dessert, saying it was a welcome to the city since I've never been before. He left us alone for awhile but soon came back and we chatted more about his family in Southern California and what hikes we should look at in the Portland area. Then he quickly brought the bill and took payment on it, chatted a bit more and then shook our hands, said it was nice to meet us and to have a great night, and we were on our way. \\n\\nI've never felt so welcome anywhere and I know that sort of grade A, stellar server treatment probably isn't exactly the norm, but it definitely left me feeling like I was way more important than I actually am.

Especially with the veggie leaves, sticky rice and the spicy sauce.  My husband loved the green curry.  The menu had a good amount of options and dishes that are just really unique.  \\n\\nNow for the not as good: Portions are on the small side so it's a tad pricey for the amount of food you get.

Here are a few thoughts from someone who lives nearby and has eaten there more than a dozen times. \\n\\nFirst, get a reservation if you want a table. It is always packed for dinner, and, although they take walk-ins, I have waited an hour or more for a table. When the say \\"45 minutes,\\" they mean 45 minutes; they do not seem to overestimate wait times. Sometimes you can sit at the bar without waiting, even at peak dinner, and the full menu is available there. Jump at this option if it seems at all busy.\\n\\nA lot of reviews compare the lobster roll to Neptune Oyster's, but there is a huge difference: ICOB's is cold; Neptune's (best) is hot. Since everyone in their right mind knows that lobster rolls should be hot and contain little to no mayo, there is no comparison: go to Neptune for the ultimate lobster roll. The lobster at ICOB is fresh and delicious; they just prevent it from reaching its full potential... That said, the menu at ICOB is excellent, even if it is a bit on the small side. I have had the seafood casserole twice, and it was great both times. The fish & chips are terrific. Normally I'd say to get something else, since you can get fish and chips anywhere, but this really might be the best you'll find anywhere. Any dish mixing fish with their bacon is a winner (duh). They often have fish or ingredients on the menu that you might not recognize. In that case, ask the server. I have found them surprisingly candid and insightful describing options. Last night I tried tilefish there for the first time, and the server's description of it and recommendation was spot on. The oysters are obviously excellent. Finally, great beer menu. They always seem to have 2-3 good IPAs available, even if only in bottle, and that scores extra points in my book. \\n\\nOverall, always an excellent choice.

I'm not normally the health-nut type, but tI must say that I was impressed. \\n\\nWhen I walked in around 7, there was a long line almost going out the door. I think the real bottleneck to the process is ordering, because the food comes out pretty quickly. It took around 15 minutes to make it to the front of the line. \\n\\nI ordered the Goddess (their signature dish) with avocado, which had brown rice, carrots, broccoli, beats, greens, and probably a few more things I don't remember. When I ordered, I was a little nervous that (a) i'd leave hungry and (b) the food would be flavorless, making it a chore to choke it down. Fortunately for me, the regular size left me full (without any of the typical guilt associated with eating too much). Even more surprising, the bowl was delicious. It had a nice ginger sauce and the ingredients blended together nicely. Also, they had this great hot sauce (medium spicy - doesn't burn your taste buds off) that I recommend trying. \\n\\nI was with a group of four other girls, and we were lucky to find a table right away as the restaurant was quite busy.

Enter DUOwusa.\\n\\nLike some have said, it's a little out of the way but I think it's just located in a different area of Waterford that some people don't even realize exists; behind the shopping center.

Then find a table, fill your drinks and settle in.\\n\\nWe ended up ordering the Smoked Turkey Breast sandwich with waffle fries and Roasted Porchetta Sandwich with mac & cheese.  The turkey is smoked in house (the smell!) and had a really wonderful, not overly smoky flavor. It also came with a cranberry sage aioli which was so, so good but just a wee portion for such a huge sandwich. I'm almost positive my waffle fries were previously frozen but seriously? Who has the time/machinery to make them scratch? (PS. If you know someone hook me up!) My BF's porchetta was drool-worthy and the garlic aioli was subtle. For once we couldn't decide who won battle of the meal. \\n\\nWe were greeted as we approached the counter. We were checked ontwice while eating; with the owner being the last point of contact. He asked how our meal was and was truly interested in our responses. He asked what we ordered and listened to our feedback.

I am very impressed with how fast the service was and how nice and friendly the servers were. \\n\\nI normally come to Korea House for their AYCE BBQ. However, this time I decided to try out the other items on their menu. I got the egg drop soup to start. The soup was very good but pretty different from the egg drop soup at Chinese restaurants. It was much less yellow and came with diced green onions sprinkled on top. I liked it because it means less artificial food coloring and the green onions gave it a fresh kick. \\n\\nFor my entree, I ordered the spicy seafood soup, which wasn't very spicy. The portion was huge though and it came with loads of squid, shrimp and mussels. This soup tasted okay, I would probably not order it again. My boyfriend ordered the chicken bulgogi and he said it tasted very good. His meal also came with white rice and 6 sides of banchan. I loved the banchan and thought that each of them tasted fresh and delicious. \\n\\nFor desserts, we got the mochi ice cream to share. This dessert was good, but nothing different or special from the mochi ice cream you could buy at Asian supermarkets. \\n\\nOverall, I think that Korea House is a solid spot for Korean food in Orlando.

The french toast was probably one of the best I've ever had; it's a simple dish, but perfectly executed with ingredients that work really well together. The caramel sauce and vanilla custard add a unique touch of sweetness, which is not at all overbearing. The mac & cheese dish was also fantastic, and made me wonder why I haven't made it with eggs before. Fig and prosciutto is one of my favourite combinations, and tastes even better with goat cheese! That omelette was a huge bargain at only $13; especially since it also came with a bowl of fresh fruit. \\n\\nWhat an amazing cafe!

And we went before it opened, normal for some really good SF places if you want to eat without an RSVP.  The drinks also looked and smelled delicious.  They were really into fresh lime juice, which never hurts a drink IMHO.  The Thai Iced Tea with lime was yummy, other drinks I only saw and sometimes smelled (hot drinks).\\n\\nOne disappointment.  The menu tells a story of the wings being a local specialty from the cook's hometown in Vietnam, so since we just did a honeymoon there and tried as many of the local specialties as we could from all over the country, we asked which town he was from.  The answer was Saigon, which seems too big for quaint local recipes.

I would definitely rate it a 5 in that category, and will certainly be back to eat there again. I'm giving it a 4 overall because I think they've got some work to do on the layout and timing of the courses. This place is a gem.\\n________________________________________________\\nAtmosphere****\\n\\nWalking in, the space was much bigger than I expected. The high ceilings and simple modern decor gave a nice open feeling. I was particularly impressed with the back wall which was inset with baskets of what must have been millions of oyster shells.\\n\\nThe only spot that didn't feel open and inviting was the front of the restaurant, which was tightly packed with people. Getting a drink while waiting for our table was a trying experience since even the bar seats were reserved.\\n\\nOysters*****\\n\\nAs expected, the selections of bivalves did not disappoint. On the menu were some of the finest oysters from Washington State, Marin County CA, Massachusetts, and even some wild Belons from Maine. Though I'm not partial to Belons, I think it's great that they were on the menu. The sign of a brilliant oyster menu is its strong indexing towards west coast flavors, which ICOB has done very well. \\n\\nMy selection was as follows:\\n\\n- Hog Island (Tamalas Bay, CA)\\n- Island Creek (Duxbury, MA)\\n- Kumamoto (Puget Sound, WA)\\n- Shigokus (Unknown, WA)\\n\\nThey may have fewer oysters, but Island Creek certainly has B&G and Neptune beat on the quality of the selection.\\n\\nAppetizers*****\\n\\nLocal ingredients are key here, and ICOB hit the nail on the head. Most of the shellfish on offer were hand harvested in either Island Creek's home town of Duxbury, or in surrounding towns on the South Shore. \\n\\nWe chose:\\n\\n- Hand dug Clam Chowder (Duxbury, MA)\\n- Hand dug Steamers (Duxbury, MA)\\n\\nThe Clam Chowder was thin-style, traditional New England, with a twist. The fresh clams and potatoes were accompanied by bacon and soft miniature buttermilk biscuits ( in lieu of oyster crackers). Brilliant.\\n\\nThe steamers transported us back to our childhood. The freshness was unlike anything we've experienced outside of digging and steaming them ourselves. \\n\\nEntrees*****\\n\\nMy wife and I both had the Lobster Roe Noodles (grilled lobster, braised short rib, pecorino, brussel sprouts, squash, mushrooms). This is their signature dish and they recommend it, even over some of the specials on the menu. It is exploding with color and flavor. A definite must-try.\\n\\nService****\\n\\nOur table was ready promptly at our reservation time, however we arrived a bit early and were uncomfortable standing in the packed corner at the front of the restaurant. \\n\\nOnce seated, we waited a few minutes for water and a waiter. Everyone including our waiter was friendly, however it seems as though they have some work to do surrounding timing and organization. It took a little too long for our main course to arrive, and we were approached prematurely by the bus staff a number of times. After we paid the check and got our coats, we had to wait 10 minutes for the valet to pull our car around.\\n_______________________________________________\\n\\nIn summary, we love the Island Creek Oyster Bar and are confident that they will work out the kinks in service over time."},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Ah, Pok Pok, you never disappoint.

Lesson learned: when it comes to Pok Pok, your best bet is to come either during lunch on a weekday or to dine around the time your grandparents would if you're trying to come for dinner (say, 4:30PM). \\n\\nWe tried the famous Ike's fish sauce wings and while I loved this dish the first time I came here, they absolutely need to be eaten with rice or they're painfully salty. Fish sauce is a condiment that packs a powerful punch of umami, but it needs to be used in small doses or it's too much. Still, this was my favorite of the dishes we ordered for its uniqueness. \\n\\nMy husband was a fan of the half chicken, which comes with a side of sweet sauce and a fish sauce. I personally prefer roast chicken with more of a crispy skin, like the one we had at Pollo Bravo. We also tried the glass noodles with prawns and pork belly, which was good, but not mind blowing. I actually left behind the pork belly because it just looked like unappealing slabs of fat, but I do appreciate the flavor it imbued to the entire dish. \\n\\nPok Pok is pretty unique but it's pretty expensive for what it is. Most of the dishes are between $15-18, and the portions are small and meant to be shared, so it quickly adds up. It's worth trying if you've never had it, but there are lots of other places to try in Portland that deliver high quality food for a fraction of the price, and I'm not sure I'd prioritize coming here again if we came back."},{"name":"Pho Basil","address":"177 Massachusetts Ave, Ste A","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I am not the type of person who orders Thai or Vietnamese food with any regularity.

Lovely. \\nI ordered the Spicy Crab Rangoons ($6) for an appetizer- I am a huge fan of crab rangoons, even the imitation crab ones you get from most Chinese restaurants I think are pretty good, with cream cheese etc.  These, however, were the genuine article. I'm no crab connoisseur, but I'd seriously doubt if these were filled with anything but real crab, and their cream sauce blend, whatever it was, was amazing. The crunchy wrapper was lite and delicate, perfectly crispy fried, without being super oily. The spice gave a pleasant flavor-enhancing kick without making you start to cry. \\n\\nEntree: Saigon chicken. $14.  Pineapple ginger orange onion pepper sex with brown rice.  Heaven.  Yes, it was that amazing of an experience.  Nothing short of the best meal I have had, from any genre of food, from any restaurant in the country, in many many years.

I make it North of the river rarely, and I have only been here twice, but it is truly rare for such a place to leave such a deep impression on me--on both of my random year or two apart visits.\\n\\nOne thing I love about Flying Falafel & Po' Boys is the sense of family--it is family run and the pride in the food is so confident that I'd follow any recommendation from them.\\n\\nA year or so ago the Austin Chronicle did a cover story on the fried chicken scene in Austin (case in point: there hardly is one).  The only thing that stood out was the Wednesday special at this little place--that and Korean-owned Red Cap Chick (R.I.P.).  So somehow it took until today for it to occur to me on a Wednesday that it was the time for me to experience perhaps Austin's only real (non fast-food) fried chicken.\\n\\nThank God I called at noon just to verify my memory was in order because they had exactly one lunch special plate left.  Ah well, I said to the girl on the phone, it'd be at least an hour before I can get over there.  Wait wait she said, and called to her mother in the kitchen to hold the last order of the special for me.  Where do you EVER see such considerate customer service?\\n\\nI got there and it was like I was an old family friend.  I asked the girl who'd answered the phone earlier if I could make a substitution--the plate consists of a generous helping of jambalaya, a scoop potato salad on crispy shredded lettuce and sliced French bread.  I told her I wasn't  big potato salad fan--\\"have you had our potato salad?\\" she asked.  It's that cool confidence that told me to go with the flow, and I'm glad I did.  The ingredients of this plate are engineered to interact brilliantly.  The fried chicken was AMAZING, the jambalaya delicious and the potato salad to my surprise was an awesome compliment to the rest of the flavors.  An awesome meal.\\n\\nThe first time I went to Flying Falafel & Po' Boys was at least a year ago--I was seeking a fried shrimp po-boy and the owners son proudly sold me on a cup of gumbo as well.  The gumbo was delicious in a true New Orleans spirit.  The owner starts the stock by cooking down shrimp casings to make a multi-layered broth, then proceeding with a light (to my taste) roux.  Very good, very New Orleanais.  The po-boy was among the better I've had outside of Louisiana, my only complaint about the cuisine coming out of this little place is that everything's a bit on the salty side.

We were greeted with friendly faces and were brought to a table. \\nNori Nori does an excellent job at providing a modern yet traditional Japanese vibe. You'll notice that all the tables are relatively separated from each other, which provides a decent amount of privacy. \\n\\nBy the time I sat down and ordered tea (the tea will come in tea bags, NOT your traditional Chinese restaurant pots), I noticed row and rows of food. All these reviews aren't lying when they say Nori Nori has a HUGE selection of food. \\n\\nThere's far too much to say about the foods in particular, so I'll keep it simple. \\nIf you've been  to other Chinese-style buffets and found the food to be mediocre, lucky for you. From what I saw the majority of the foods available far your taking are completely different, but not in a bad way. As a matter fact, the food for a \\"buffet\\" is superb. Next to the row of hot dishes is a line of cold dishes. These dishes vary from salad, seaweed, and other Asian vegetables. \\n\\nIn the case that you have no interest in these foods, good for you. The main attraction is their sushi rolls, nigiri, and sashimi. They have an even larger selection of sushi rolls available. You're bound to find one, two, or even twenty that you'll enjoy. \\nThe sashimi is also very good for a buffet, From what I saw, they had tuna, salmon, mackerel, yellow tail, and one or two that I can't seem to remember at the moment. \\nThe pieces of sashimi are cut in to small pieces and are served on small dishes. While it isn't fair to compare a buffet's sashimi to a restaurant's, Nori Nori has done a  great job at providing good quality sashimi. The raw fish is quite fresh, which is very impressive. \\n\\nAlong with the sashimi they also have everyone's beloved buffet food: OYSTERS AND SNOW CRAB LEGS. Otherwise known as the greedy and unethical buffet eater breeding ground. According to NORI NORI, each plate is allowed (something like) three oysters and four crag legs per PLATE. There are signs over each of the two seafoods. Now, you're probably wondering why I care so much about this. Nori Nori attracts an ample amount of people, and food can't be served at an instant. What happens when some guy/girl/child goes up to the oyster and crab legs and grabs ALL of them? You'll need to wait 5 minutes till the server prepares more. At the time he lays out more, someone else will come on over and take ALL of them again. \\n\\nThere is also a hibachi grill (which I did not get the chance to try) and a dessert bar. The desserts are your standard buffet desserts, but their soft serve green tea ice cream makes up for that. Next to the dessert bar, is a crepe bar. The crepe are JUST crepes with whatever fruit you want available. Don't expect anything extraordinary as their crepes are essential a thin pancake with less than a handful of fruits inside. \\n\\nConclusion: Nori Nori is an excellent buffet. BUT if you do not enjoy seafood and sushi in particular, I don't recommend coming here. The bill will come out to be much more expensive than your typical buffet, and the only way to eat your money's worth is by eating seafood/sushi. The sushi isn't anything outstanding, but the quality is good enough for a buffet. Think of it like, \\"Large quantities and acceptable quality\\". The service is excellent, and the place looks quite upscale. So basically, I highly recommend you check out Nori Nori, if you have the time, money, and stomach for it. You won't regret it! \\n\\nP.S.: If you're a fan of oysters and snow crab legs, fight for it."},{"name":"Thai Wok Kitchen","address":"5000 E 4th Plain Blvd, Ste A101","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4.5","text":"Great Thai food, excellent service.

Unfortunately, I walked away feeling like I could fly to Thailand and get a better experience for not much more money.\\n\\nThe Service:\\nWe showed up in-between lunch and dinner so we were unexpectedly seated immediately in the upstairs verandah. From that point, however, it took nearly twenty minutes before a waitress came for our order.\\n\\nThe Menu:\\nThere are a lot of interesting choices on the menu that sound great, and most of them were labelled as \\"shared\\" for family style dining. The supposedly-famous chicken wings are a whopping $14.50, Thai-style iced coffee runs upwards of $5 (for a pathetically small amount, no less), and they make you order your rice on the side for an additional $2.50-$3. Seriously? Rice is some of the cheapest food on Earth and it's not included?\\n\\nThe Food:\\nI ordered the Muu Paa Kham Waan, or boar collar meat rubbed and glazed with a variety of yummy things. On the menu, the word \\"spicy\\" is casually dropped in the description of the \\"chili/lime/garlic sauce,\\" so I assumed this would be something fun to try as I can handle a moderate amount of spice (even at a Thai restaurant).\\n\\nWhen my plate arrived I was, like a small child who dropped an ice cream cone, sadly disappointed at the petite order of food in front of me. My entree, which cost $14.50, was barely enough food for one person who is only moderately hungry.\\n\\nI thought it was strange that the waitress instructed me to eat the boar with rice and then chase it down with the included mustard greens, but as it turns out, the entree I ordered was at least a 10 out of 10 on a Thai restaurant spicy scale. In other words, the second most spicy food I've ever eaten in my life. After a mouth-watering nose-running face-reddening ten minutes I had finished the tiny plate of food, but the burning didn't stop there. It continued with force for the next ten minutes, burning my mouth upon exhale as if I were some sort of fire-breathing dragon inflicting hell on the passersby.\\n\\nThe End:\\nI spent, after tip, $24 on a tiny plate of food that left me feeling miserable and a small cup of average Thai iced coffee. There are other amazing Thai restaurants of this style in Portland that serve more plentiful portions, reasonably-priced chicken wings ($7-8), serve rice automatically with your meal, and don't inflict pain through excessive spiciness."},{"name":"True Food Kitchen","address":"222 West Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Love this place.

We got the Wellfleets, Chathams, Aunt Dottie's, and John's River. The Wellfleet and Chatham oysters are saltier and brinier while the Aunt Dottie's and John's River had a sweeter flavor. My favorite was the Wellfleet. All of the oysters were really fresh and definitely worth the price. \\n\\nWe got the oyster slider and clam chowder as appetizers - both were amazing! The slider was an individual sized portion so keep that in mind while ordering. The clam chowder had bits of bacon and buttery biscuit croutons in it. It is definitely one of the better clam chowders in the Boston area. \\n\\nI got the lobster roe noodles as my entree and it was delicious. I love that there is short rib in it because it adds so much flavor to the dish. My only complaint was that I thought the dish was a little too oily but that certainly didn't stop me from eating it! \\n\\nThe cocktail menu was a little disappointing but their beer/cider list certainly made up for it (beer goes better with seafood anyways!). There was a pretty decent selection of craft beers from all over the world. I got a cider from Spain (I forget the name) and it was really light and refreshing, the perfect drink for my meal. \\n\\nWe were too full for dessert but they brought out complimentary bite size portions of their red velvet cake which was so good! The cream cheese frosting was really light and had hints of coconut in it. I will have to try one of their desserts next time I come because they all looked pretty good. \\n\\nIf you love seafood, definitely come here. Not only was the food amazing, the service and ambience were great too.

For those unaware, there's no chicken in this dish; the steak is fried as if it were chicken. I had mine with toast and man was this filling. If the steak wasn't already full of protein, the eggs, hash, and potential corn bread would have finished me off. The steak was fully breaded and drenched with the sausage gravy making it extra saucy. On the inside though, my steak was quite dry and tough to chew into. I did like that the hash was made with potato strips instead of cubes and the eggs came over easy as ordered. There isn't too much to say about the bread except that it's generously buttered.\\n\\nThe Southern Fried Chicken was a great main. If you're looking to avoid a big dinner coma, this chicken might be a great choice. This came with 2 pieces of boneless crispy fried chicken and gravy; we opted for fries on the side. The gravy was good for dipping the fries and the chicken. The chicken was less dry than the steak and had a great crunch to it.

No Thai employees that I saw. From the hostess to our server to our bus boys, not a single Thai employee. No Thai customers. Tourist trap? Possibly. Overpriced? Slightly.\\n\\nFOOD:\\n* Vietnamese Fish Sauce Wings - It's good but nothing GREAT as all these Yelp reviews have it. Being Vietnamese myself, I've had my fair share of \\"fish sauce wings\\" and these simply don't do any justice. I had one and was over the hype.\\n* Sunny's Yam Wun Sen - Glass noodle salad. Average at best. I've had better. A bit on the spicy side for medium as well.\\n* Neua Naam Tok - Flank steak salad. This was the size of a side salad you would get at typical restaurants. OK maybe slightly larger but it's tiny. Average at best.\\n* Kung Op Wun Sen - The noodles were probably the best part of this dish and they weren't great either. Prawns were OK. Definitely tasted better with the dipping sauce that tasted kind of like a salsa verde. The pork belly left much to be desired. I like mine a bit more fatty and tender. \\n* Salt-Grilled Tilapia - I'll admit, this was my fault. I intended on ordered a more sauced grilled fish. Somehow I just saw \\"Tilapia\\" and ordered this. First time, it came out undercooked so we sent it back. Second time, slightly undercooked at certain parts but I didn't want to wait again. The fish overall was SALTY! Literally, one bite and I pushed the entire dish aside. You really have to wrap it with the vermicelli noodles, lettuce and dip with their sauce to get rid of the heavy salt flavor. I can make a better tilapia at home. $26 for this when other places would charge under $20.\\n\\nSERVICE:\\n- Good. No complaints. The manager came out to apologize to us for serving an undercooked fish at first.\\n\\nAnd the verdict? I was sad. Very sad. I came with 2 locals and they vowed to never return as well. Talked to some food cart owners the day after and they seem to share the same thoughts as I do about Pok Pok. Not worth it.\\n\\nSo if you're looking to come here. Come with an open mind.

I just feel like I could go to the store and get a pizza for 10 bucks that I know my son and I will like."},{"name":"Ceviche Tapas Bar & Restaurant","address":"125 W Church St","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"I thought this place was going to be amazing because of the recommendations my friend and I received. Yeah totally wrong, got all hyped up and excited for nothing but disappointment. Lets start off by saying the atmosphere was great and that was about the only greatness for the night lol. The service was horrible and for it being our first time, our server did not introduce to us to what their specials of the day were or anything. It was almost as if we were bugging him with questions. Brought out our food with attitude and was quick to walk away before we could even ask for anything else. The food was so so only liked one item that we ordered out of everything and it was chicken but to be specific..couldn't remember the name and I wouldn't bother trying to remember it anyways because ill never return again...first impressions are everything!

Got there around 2pm and waited in the light rain for about 10 mins. Popular place and thought the wait would be longer but since we got here on a late lunch, it wasn't too bad even though it was a Sunday. With 4 of us, it was easier to try a little bit of their popular dishes since it was a family style place which was perfect.\\n\\nOrdered their Fish Sauce Wings, Sticky Rice, Papaya Salad, Glass Noodles with Pork and Spare Ribs. Out of this group, I thought the Fish Sauce Wings was a must try. So much flavor with the sauce and seasoning that goes on the wings. Papaya salad tasted ok with a bit spice. Glass noodles with pork was cooked perfectly with the noodles very soft and the whole plate being flavorful. Spare ribs I expected more because it was really more bones than meat and wasn't tender as I would liked it to be. Compared to other Thai places here in the LA area, it's a bit on the pricier end especially with LA having better Thai food. Thai tea was good though and if you're thirsty, definitely a drink to get here."},{"name":"Pho Basil","address":"177 Massachusetts Ave, Ste A","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I have been to Pho Basil about 5 times now, and I have to say I like it more and more each time. The food is very good, and the spices just right. The portions are big, you could easily pay $7 for dinner and have left over for lunch the next day. Which leads me to the price - it cant be beat for good, quality food. \\n\\nThe service is good, not perfect, but I don't mind if I have to ask twice for something since its rare I have to in the first place. The wait staff is so nice, which adds to the greatness of this place. Ambiance isn't ideal, but for $8 dinner dishes, you would normally expect less. \\n\\nAll in all, this place is great and I cant wait until its cold outside so I can sit and have some pho on the cheap."},{"name":"Great Wok","address":"1181 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Arlington","stars":"3","text":"My new favorite place for Chinese take-out!  The food is not too greasy but still tastes great- they use 100% vegetable oil.  Great Wok offers all typical Chinese food options such as crab ragoon and beef and broccoli in cheap lunch and dinner meal specials (entree, chicken wing, and fried rice for about $6 - 9) as well as more traditional Chinese foods.  I suggest the Moo Shi Pork, a stir-fry served with 4 Chinese pancakes and hoisen sauce.  The staff is very courteous and the wait time very minimal.  The kitchen is open so customers can watch while their food is being made.  I highly recommend this place!"},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I don't claim to be a Thai food expert by any means, but my dinner experience at Pok Pok was the best I've ever had.

I was a little concerned with how small our upstairs dining area was, but once the food and drinks came out, that was the least of my worries!\\n\\nI was curious to try one of the drinking vinegars, and it was delicious.  To be honest, I can't recall all of the dishes we ate but we took the recommendations of our server and he did not let us down.  Each bite was a flavor sensation - many new to me!

I was vaguely aware of it from reviews but it is easy to miss as the only sign is \\"Korean Restaurant\\". It is more of a cafe than restaurant though.\\n\\nSomewhat limited menu including some Japanese dishes even chicken teriyaki. I was here for BBQ though and ordered 2 galbis along with a Jap Chae. It all came very quickly after a small lettuce salad.  Banchan was quite limited to kimchi, broccoli and potatoes along with spicy bean paste.\\n\\nThe galbi was cut thin along the bone and the thin bone was attached. It was cooked in the kitchen and arrived super hot. If you have it cooked table side the cost is $3 more per order. I have a feeling it turns out better being cooked in the kitchen. It was well caramelized and strongly marinated to the sweet side and slightly lacking in the salt dept. the Jap Chae was delightful. All included 2 galbis, 1 Jap  Chae and a Bud Lite came to $42, not bad.

I didn't see any option on the menu to add extra toppings.\\n\\nKushiage (fried stuff) is great. They have fried mozzarella! It's a cheese stick (wedge, really) on a stick. So, if you're going with a picky eater or someone who doesn't dig Japanese food, they will have something to eat. There is also plain steamed rice for 2.50 which is highway friggin robbery if you ask me. If you're going here though you're probably interested in stuff besides plain rice and fried cheese. The crab sunomono special was delicious. Saba sushi was fresh and of a good quality. Tsukemono had a lot of bonito on it for my taste but I guess I could've just flicked it to the side. Yakitori was moist and tasty.\\n\\nThe atmosphere is fantastic! I sat in the tea room at a kotatsu (blanket table, basically) with my picky eater boyfriend. We were toasty as hell on a below-freezing night, until our legs fell asleep and we had to stand up. Still worth it. Also, the ladies' toilet has a heated seat among other options. There is a sign in the mens room saying they will get a fancy toilet for the boys once they get 50,000 customers.

Food and drinks get 5 stars, no question - perhaps among the top two meals of my trip, and definitely the best drinks I've had in a long time. Service gets 4 stars, details below. In summary, though, don't miss this place!\\n\\nFood first: I got the fried fish sandwich with fries. The sandwich was amazing. Buttery, fresh, and packed with flavor. The sauce was perfect and added a great, tart kick. The side of slaw, while very small, was also tasty. You know how slaw can sometimes be underwhelming and flavorless? Not the case here! The fries were also super flavorful, and if anything, maybe a bit over-seasoned. They had a salty rub on them that was delicious, but indeed very salty (coming from a sodium fiend). They were also generous in portion and while it's usually sacrilegious for me to leave even one fry on a plate, I couldn't finish them. Oh! And the bread - best I had in Boston. It was crusty, unlike all the other table bread I experienced during my trip. And in general, it could compete with the delicious loaves we are lucky enough to enjoy on the west coast (east coast bread, apart from what you find in NY, just can't hang).\\n\\nOn to drinks: the first one I had was some cranberry herby drink that was sweet and decent but not the best. It didn't sound like my style, but the waitress recommended it so I gave it a shot. Not bad by any means, just no wow factor. It did do a good job of disguising booze, though! I had a little buzz afterward. Moving on to the important part - the next drink I had was amazing amazing. If you like sweet-ish, tart-ish drinks at all, get the New York Sour. It was SO good, and made all the better by tiny ice cubes and single a big wine ice cube that floated and melted slowly as I drank. Beautiful, tasty, and a generous glass size. I'll come back just for this. I also liked how they organized their drink menu and that there weren't too many cocktail options - details FTW!\\n\\nFinally, service. I came in as it opened at 4pm and did not have a reservation. There's walk in seating at the bar (which is very nice - light, airy, and stylish) and at the high tops. As a single diner, the waitress seated me behind the cash register even though no one was at any of the other two person tables. I understood why, as couples on dates would probably be more discerning over their seat assignment, but it was a pretty crappy table. In her defense, I could have asked for a better one. The main issue, though, was that I could hear the staff interact with each other and it was a bit distracting from the should-be classy restaurant experience. Pretty minor issue. The waitress was a bit slow to come take my drink order, but aside from that, no complaints! \\n\\nI will definitely make this a stop on my next trip to Boston!"},{"name":"Roppolo's Pizzeria on Wheels","address":"606 Red River St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"don't let the 3 stars fool you, Roppolo's is awesome......the only reason I give it a 3 instead of 4 is that originality isn't very high and they are many great original food trucks down off 6th street but the multiple locations are great!"},{"name":"The Meatball Stoppe","address":"7325 Lake Underhill Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Ate there this evening with 3 others.

Some people are put off by the BBQ arriving at just above room temperature but that is actually how it is supposed to be served.  I'd highly recommend the Eggplant w/pork in Garlic Sauce. Ithas a wonderful flavor that isn't really matched anywhere else I've tried it.  The Sauteed Kai Lan (chinese vegetable on the menu) is a good vegetable addition to any meal and I would be lying if I didn't say I love the Sesame Beef.   \\n\\nThe noodle soups are all pretty good but hard to divide in a party because they have lots of intertwined noodles that can make a mess when you split them apart.  If you are going to split any of the noodle soups - make sure you are with friends.\\n\\nThe only reason I don't give this wonderful place 5 stars is because of consistency.  I wouldn't say that I've ever not enjoyed this place - but sometimes the dishes are a little off.  There have been a few times when the meet in the sesame beef was not very good. Also you can find them on days when there is no BBQ pork to be had - which is also a frequent complaint of my friend who's always going there for the BBQ and the Eggplant with Garlic Sauce.  \\n\\nAll that being said - the food here is really a treat and no one ever leaves disappointed."},{"name":"Moonshine Patio Bar & Grill","address":"303 Red River St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Delicious food; attentive waitstaff and comfortable.

When I traveled to New York all the time, I always went to the Oyster Bar at Grand Central before checking into my hotel. Now I don't have to leave home to find such a wide variety. Plus, I get a much more glamorous atmosphere along with some high end wine. Parking myself on a bar stool for a long term oyster love connection is going to become a welcome habit.\\n\\nYou do not really have to be an oyster lover to appreciate Island Creek Oyster Bar, but it sure helps. So many oysters, so lovingly displayed and presented. You will be mighty impressed. Three of us just finished devouring two dozen without talking, just sharing in a solid amount of polite slurping. My first time here, I went through a dozen, accompanied by some perfect wine that was recommended by the waiter. No need to ask for more lemon. So classic. \\n\\nThe menu is definitely heavy on the fish but does offer chicken and steak, plus an assortment of side dishes. I have had a beautifully prepared, lightly breaded skate and a beautiful piece of salmon. There's nothing wildly off the charts about any of the food preparation. In fact, it is fairly traditional, yet I like that. Fish is so easy to mess up and this place just lets the simple flavors of the fish radiate. No need to muck it up. \\n\\nService is good but still working a few kinks out. On one of our visits, our waiter kept making his own personal suggestions each time anyone ordered. It was only mildly interesting at first and beyond annoying by the time dessert rolled around. They do help you out if you have food allergies and are very accommodating that way. \\n\\nI found the prices to be higher than I had thought they would be, but I never complain about money when the food is this good. You are eating out. What a treat. I can't ruin a good meal by penny pinching. \\n\\nThis is a cavernous, modern space, yet it is surprisingly friendly.

Both, the owner and his son, were more than helpful with showing us favorites in the menus (there were 3) since everything sounded so so good. My girlfriend got the butternut squash and goat cheese omelette which was great. I went for the \\"everything but the kitchen sink\\" sampler which was a little more difficult to conquer. I made it about 60% before I started shutting down. When the owner said \\"if you leave hungry let me know\\" [and I'll fix that] he wasn't kidding.

The pizza has a nice thin crust and the red sauce is unique and flavorful. The white pizzas are also great. I'm a huge fan of the Bella Ragazze which is a garlic cream sauce instead of red sauce with romano and caramelized onions. It's even good left over, which I normally hate.

As my husband is on an odd diet because of GI issues, he cant have wheat (which also meant beer was out), and we didnt ask whether they could accomodate with a different type of bread (a non-wheat, but white kind).

It's always had a welcoming vibe and the same people always come back. Most days, especially at lunch, the restaurant sees many returning senior citizens who've clearly come to love the consistently first-rate food and service.\\n\\nFood (9.5/10): The food here comes in unexpectedly giant portions with equally large and delicious sides. Their unparalleled souvlaki and gyro meat come straight off the grill and spit and taste absolutely phenomenal. Additionally, their marinated potatoes and red-sauce drenched green beans taste fantastic and fresh. \\n\\nHygiene (8.5/10): Brothers Kouzina went through a renovation some time last year that totally revamped the interior design. Now, even though the interior is still somewhat darkly lit, the restaurant has a much cleaner, contemporary feel. Bathrooms are well-maintained and modern, and the open kitchen is clearly clean.\\n\\nPrice (9.5/10): The pricing here is fair at dinner, but incredible at lunch--giant platters of food during the latter can cost less than $15. Almost all dinner dishes fall under $15 and even their most expensive seafood sits at around an unbelievable 20 dollars.\\n\\nLocation (6/10): Brothers Kouzina is located in a very unassuming location just off the highway that is unfortunately quite easy to miss. Make sure to turn off the road before the sign. During mealtimes and especially on weekends, parking sometimes overflows into the gas station directly across from the restaurant.\\n\\nService (10/10): The service here is absolutely fantastic: the waitresses are very attentive, friendly and helpful! They'll check in on you, answer questions patiently and in-depth, and even really get to know some regulars like friends!\\n\\nOverall: Brothers Kouzina is the place to be for a hearty and filling family meal!\\n\\nRecommended dishes:\\n- Brothers Kouzina Deluxe (this is what I get almost every time because it's so all-inclusive and is a gigantic portion)\\n- Moussaka\\n- Spanakopita\\n- Lamb Kokonisto\\n- Fisherman's Platter (much cheaper than other restaurants, great portion size, and well-fried with crispy and balanced batter, delicious onion rings and cole slaw)"},{"name":"Kasbah Moroccan Cafe","address":"201 NW Davis St","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"Prior to entering this unassuming establishment, you see a poster of Rock the Kasbah (perhaps an omen!?).

That's when Naji (chef and owner) popped his head out from the back and said \\"no worries, we will and take your money (jokingly) and accommodated your needs \\". This was when we knew it was a special place. I ordered the Merguez Lamb Sausage. Executed to perfection in a rich tomatoes marmalade. After ordering we gazed at all the beautiful deserts.

Then we got our pasta, and well, I don't know what to say...Amazing?  Incredible?  Nah, that doesn't do it justice.  My girlfriend got the Penne al Pesto and I got the Pappardelle al Cinghiale, the wild boar pasta I heard so much about.  Best life decision in a long time.  Both of our dishes were cooked to perfection and I still don't know what to say about the wild boar pasta.  It tasted so exquisite and luscious, but yet hearty while not tasting gamy.  Simply put, it was brilliant.  On top of that, the portions were so filling that I didn't know if I would have room for dessert.  Well, that's silly...Of course I'll always have room for dessert.  The two of us ordered a Caf√© Eros and split an order of Profiteroles; others have raved about the desserts, but I wasn't as floored as others.  Admittedly though, I'm glad the dessert wasn't too spectacular (in my opinion); it allowed my entr√©e was able to be the true shining star of the meal, something that doesn't happen often enough.\\n\\nAnd just like the food, the service was wonderful.

And after our meal, as we were leaving, he playfully teased once again.  Those elements just added to what was already a wonderful evening.\\n\\nI can easily say that this is one of the best restaurants I have gone to and one of the best meals I have had in a long time (and this is after I just got back from Hawaii and had all of the delicious food there).  The restaurant is beautiful, warm, and inviting; and the d√©cor goes a long way to heighten the mood.  The service and attention is wonderful and really makes you feel at home.

The trout was cooked perfectly with small pieces of bacon added for texture and the Bouillabaise was a cioppino-type dish with mussels, clams, lobster, halibut, and veggies. Both had a ton of flavor.\\n\\nI didn't want to over eat so I only ordered one oyster, their signature one, and I definitely regret not ordering more. They have a large selection of fresh oysters from all over New England and a bunch of different dipping sauces to go with.\\n\\nThe most disappointing part of our meal was dessert. We each ordered the strawberry donut and it was just a sad, cold donut with some strawberry frosting and preserves on the side. It didn't taste fresh or fluffy and it was nothing spectacular at all.

I've never had ceviche served as simply the marinated meat component sans all the other goodness.\\nThe second dish was a pork shank- unlike the tuna, this was quite good and we enjoyed it.  The only detractor was the price.\\nWe also had roast duck . . . maybe I'm just weird, but tough meat bathed in a chocolate sauce is simply not appetizing.

I've seen her work online and feel in love with her craft. I arrived early because I live far and I'm afraid of being late. Mercedes was kind enough to see me five minutes after I arrived even though I was early. She introduced herself and had a great vibe to her. I told her that I did have some grey strands but she didn't notice until she took a good look at my hair and proclaimed I was greying prematurely which, I don't think is accurate. A few strands here and there doesn't mean I'm greying prematurely. I was little taken back by that. But on to the service... she did an excellent job with washing my very thick and kinky hair. Most salons I have been to aren't as gentle and like to ripe through my hair when wet with a comb which is a no-no. Even when she blow dried and flat iron my hair she made sure to be very cautious which I appreciate. When she was done I was in awe. The color was so vibrant and shiny and my hair looked like I had a perm. It was so light and bouncy. I was not disappointed in the look at all. I did notice a burnt smell in my hair after I left though which can indicate heat damage. I did wash my hair and it felt like my curls were a little loose but that has yet to be determined because I'm still waiting for my hair to dry. Overall, the salon is very neat and clean. Everyone seems friendly when they greet you. The prices are a little high for me though. I'm not one to get my hair blow dried or press often.

However it can be better if the chef fried it a little longer. Lastly we wanted to have the super big fried chicken like we saw in Shi Lin market Taiwan but it seems like not exactly the same from photo so we ended order salty fried chicken with basil and jalapeno. The chicken is crispy and spicy with the seasoning. This is the best for tonight. \\nStill we will come back to try more of their food.

I don't know if it's always like that or if it was because we went in on a night where there was no show playing nearby. Definitely a positive for my friend who was driving.\\n\\nWalking in with a tee and a hoodie, I felt a little under-dressed. The place gives off a more classy vibe and going here was kind of a last-minute decision on our part. Regardless, the staff and everyone else inside paid no heed to what we were wearing, so perhaps it was all just my imagination.\\n\\nThe Oregon lamb meatballs were excellent and really got my appetite going. The polenta mixed very well with it. I found myself craving a little more, but that's usually what happens when I get appetizers.\\n\\nThe chicken was the highlight of my meal. Good portions, really tender, and the skin was crispy (as advertised!!). I had to restrain myself from barbarically licking up the plate for the gravy. That stuff combo'd amazingly with both the chicken and the pomme puree.\\n\\nFor dessert, we shared the reine de saba and butterscotch pot de creme. Both were really good and I'd recommend either one.\\n\\nThe service...Wow!! The waiter was friendly, very attentive to our needs, very helpful at explaining all the items on the menu, and talkative but not intrusive.

Was a regular at the Buckhead location before where the Japanese chef was truly a Japanese chef (now Umi owner). First, a little history: owner is Vietnamese, started with a Vietnamese noodle shop at the Midtown Cinema plaza. Opened the MF location on E Ponce, then upscale Buckhead location that was way too big to be a sushi shop. He went Bankrupt, went to Houston and opened a place there. Happened to have family there and stumbled across MF again. What shocked me was the change in value, which I saw the other day reproduced in the new ATL location. Take one nigiri and cut it in half, then charge the same! The Japanese chef's at the ATL location are good, but the value is not good. Also, it really bugs me to sit at the sushi counter and have a waitress - not the sushi chef - take care of you... not the real way of eating sushi, but then, when the chef's - minus two - aren't Japanese and don't know what things are - just do as trained to make the ordinary - I guess you have to do it this way. We did \\"omakasei\\" (depend on the chef) and were served well for the money (two levels: $100 or $125). The fact that the nigiri are doll house size just bugs me. I can think of two reasons: one - he already went bankrupt once and cut costs by cutting size of sashimi (let's face it, the cost isn't in the rice!), or 2 - if you make a true nigiri size, customers fill up and don't over order. A real failure was  the temaki zushi. Temaki should be hand wrapped in front of you and the nori is fresh and flakes as you bite into it. In our case, I suspect the next dish was made in in the waiting until we were ready for it. By the time the temaki came, the nori absorbed moisture and was rubbery. Bad form. I'd really like to give the Japanese chefs kudos though - ask for them and ask for them to take care of you at the counter - not a waitress who knows nothing. MF Sushi ATL? Once was enough. The original owner's brother runs the new ATL location with the same attitude (as noted in other reviews) and new approach of cutting the product in half -  Sushi is  overpriced and undersized."},{"name":"Shigezo Izakaya","address":"910 SW Salmon St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Slow chefs.

The waitress was inattentive with poor menu knowledge. She informed the soup \\"looks good today, sometimes it's ehhh\\" um, ew. Also when informed her my spinach salad was composed entirely of romaine she said \\"huh, weird, it's been a crazy week.\\" what???  She then continued to complaim about the \\"crazy week\\" she was having in detail, not interested in hearing you complain over our meal thanks.When she asked if we were done, we said yes, and she walked away to clear off a dirty empty table. Finally when we asked to split the check half smd half on 2 cards, she said she'd split it by items. No, we clearly said half and half. One of, if not, the worst restaurant experiences of my life.

We ordered a full BBQ chicken, butter chicken, chicken fajita pizza, and finally a Chinese dish. Our ordered arrived near the 30-40 minute mark. Even after serving our food the waiter did not offer us water until we finally requested it of him. There was also only one waiter at the time and he kept repeatedly taking calls on his phone throughout our service. The Chinese chicken dish was extremely cold, the chicken fajita pizza had a 3 strands of bell peppers on it, the cheese was overdone, and maybe 3 small cubes of chicken, the BBQ chicken was very delicious but unfortunately the rice it came with were also cold, similar to the Chinese chicken dish, and finally my butter chicken never arrived. We finished our food in around 15-20 minutes and patiently awaited my butter chicken order before finally deciding to cancel it and just head home. When I went to pay there was a woman there instead who was handling our payment. I realized I had been charged for a chai masala tea whichI had not ordered. I was also being charged for a butter chicken order they had never delivered to my table. I also told the woman at the counter that I was severely disappointed in the pizza I received as it contained barely any fajita chicken. The woman argued that she had not been the one to serve me and she had just arrived - she had no clue how much of what she was telling me was the truth or not. I'm appalled that she would treat me with such disrespect and essentially claim that I was lying to her about my extremely poor service. She claimed she had no clue if I had received a butter chicken dish or had helped myself to some chai from their restaurant and was not willing to budge on charging me for these dishes which again, I DID NOT ORDER/RECEIVE. She had also tacked on a healthy 15% service fee automatically and still expected an extra tip as well for my party of 5. Eventually she agreed to give me back some of my money - she cancelled the butter chicken, gave me $2 back for the chai I never ordered, and then $1 for the unsatisfactory pizza I received. I'm disgusted by her attitude and disappointed by the restaurant overall.

Their gyoza was delicious, as was their miso soup, the latter being fairly hard to mess up.\\n\\nOn my second visit, we decided on the teppan grill option.  This visit is why I gave a two star rating instead of three.  Again, with the competitors being Amura and Kobe (even Osaka was better) for this type of meal, to be successful you had better be good.  The presentation was run-of-the-mill, and all of the meat on my steak, chicken, and shrimp dinner was cooked to the consistency of rubber.  The rice and noodles were well cooked, but the only flavor i could taste was oil and soy sauce; I didn't even see them season it with anything else.  The portion size is smaller than the other places, but I guess that's okay since I wouldn't be excited with leftovers from Fuji like I would be with leftovers from Kobe.\\n\\nAll in all, Fuji Sushi is just mediocre.

First, slow service. Couldn't get seated because the only visible server was having a long chat with some folks. Once we got seated (and the place was nearly empty) it took another 20 minutes just to get water. The server was overbearing and patronizing. When I told him I didn't want tabouli (I'm low carb), he asked me if I even knew what tabouli was. Rude! When we got our appetizer, the server picked up the pita bread in his hands to demonstrate how to put the various ingredients into it to make a little sandwich. As if he couldn't have just told us that. Then when he made mine, as a joke he started to walk away with it, which would have been just fine with me since I had no idea if he had washed his hands or not. Unfortunately he returned with the bread he had handled extensively. This is just gross since we saw him to the same for another table and clearly he didn't wash his hands in between doing all sorts of other stuff.  The bread was cold and not fresh. One of the best reasons to eat this sort of food is the warm, soft bread decent places offer. Can't they even warm the pita bread they apparently bought from the day-old bread store?\\n\\nOur dinners, which were both lamb/chicken shwarma were also well below par with similar restaurants. Just mediocre with no flavor. Also, when my mother said thanks at the cash register, the server told her to address him as \\"sweetie\\". Sorry, that is just too forward and lacking basic respect. We're customers, not buddies.   Overall a very disappointing experience and fairly expensive too. Choose any other middle Eastern restaurant and you'll be much happier.

Here is what we think.\\n\\nPros:  \\nIt's a nice venue, it's clean, upscale and this is one of its strongest points.  \\nWhile it's often busy and there's usually a wait, the service is efficient and very friendly.  There's a positive attitude from all the people working there.  \\nThey finally got their license to serve beer. \\nThey know what tsukemen is, at least on paper. \\n\\nCons:\\nThe food is mediocre at best.  The ramen is weak, and they have this idea that they need to offer low sodium options, before trying to get their normal menu options right.  I was really hoping they would nail the tsukemen since no where else we've been in Portland knows what tsukemen is, but unfortunately it's not been good the 2 times I tried it.  I think that because this is a chain, somewhere along the way the creator, the original recipes may have been diluted.  This is just a guess. \\nThey seem to have this idea that having a staff that is 85% Asian lends legitimacy to the food and somehow makes it more Japanese.  My wife is Japanese, I've spent a lot of time in Japan and I saw one guy behind the counter that \\"might\\" have been Japanese.  As I said earlier, the service is great, but I just don't like it when I see Japanese restaurants in Portland actively hiring for Asians thinking that Asian equals authenticity.   \\nFinally, the over enthusiastic 5 star reviews mean you'll probably have to wait to sit down and if you are like me, you will be very disappointed in the food.\\n\\nWe won't be coming back here.  When this place was about to open I had friends posting on facebook saying, wow maybe Portland is going to get a real ramen shop now, but sadly this isn't the case.  I was half tempted to give this place a 1 or 2 star rating because of the food and all the bogus 5 star reviews saying the ramen is so awesome but I cannot.  The fact that we've been treated so well by the people working there means I cannot completely give this place the finger, but this is what my stomach has wanted to do each time we've been here.  It also may be true that this place is better then everywhere else in Portland except for two places other places i know which I'll keep to myself.  Being at or near the top of the list for ramen in Portland is nothing to be too proud of though.  In LA this place would be 1 or 2 stars and would not last more then a month in business.  In Japan they wouldn't even let a place like this have their ramen license.  :P"},{"name":"Gourmet Garden","address":"45 Enon St","city":"Beverly","stars":"3.5","text":"Average food, fast delivery.

We were invited to sample everything--how amazing is BBQ that you don't have to slather it in sauce--and I even split the creamed corn with my boyfriend. Side note: I BLOODY HATE CREAMED CORN. That's how good it is! I dribbled some sauce on the side to dip my meat in and never used it--again, why bother when you have such excellent meat? I had the lean brisket, he had the full on fatty yummy stuff. We also split the potato salad, perfect to me, hard to explain, but not too sweet nor too salty. They serve your meal on white butcher or wax paper with a healthy over-serving of white bread. Not a big fan of white bread, but...who cares! Eat the meat!\\n\\nWe have also been here for the breakfast tacos...hallelujah and holy shit, are they phenomenal! We ordered them fresh, these are no wimpy little things.

We ordered the shrimp corndogs - while not completely appealing in thought - were delicious in person. I had the Indigo Spinach salad with grilled shrimp - it as a mixture of flavors that I've never had before - delicious. My husband has meatloaf that was also very good - it was accompanied by the brussels sprouts - so good. Little cornbread muffins were served with the meal - I swear they melted in my mouth. We had to have dessert so we ordered the Peanut Butter Mousse Pie - if you go, you have to have this pie. It earned me a long run on the treadmill - but was so worth it.\\nI highly recommend that if you are in Austin - you get to Moonshine - and sit on the patio - it was so neat!"},{"name":"Commonwealth Restaurant and Market","address":"11 Broad Canal Way","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"The food and drinks were fantastic, but the kitchen and bars were both quite slow, and the wait staff was remarkably inattentive. At any given time, there were 4 or 5 wait staff standing outside the dining room not doing anything, but we had to flag people down when additional members of our party arrived, to order food, and to pay.\\n\\nOverall, I would say the food was worth the wait, but I would like to see improvements made in the dining room, and I don't completely understand the theory behind the prices.

I am neither a parent nor a person under the age of ten; had I been either of these I am sure this place would have gotten a solid 5 stars. I was meeting some family and luckily we got there early enough (9 am) so as to avoid the hour wait the hostess was quoting on our way out. \\n\\nThe positives: The service was stellar, and that is what bumped this place up to an A-OK; the coffee was refilled frequently, the \\"pancake making process\\" was explained thoroughly, plates were cleared quickly, and the server was overall sweet as pie. I didn't partake in the pancake delight but I did enjoy watching others at the table make theirs, and the options for batter and toppings were really great. They are also very vegan/gluten-free/veg friendly which I totally dig. \\n\\nThe negatives: Lots of kids (I know, I know. I'm a jerk) if you're not into that kind of thing, although none were really misbehaving horribly while we were there. I ordered the migas (scramble with peppers, onions, queso fresco, tortilla strips) that came with potatoes and a homemade english muffin. I was really surprised at how flavorless both the scramble and the overdone potatoes were. Sad times. The muffin was really good with their house jam.

Let me first start out by saying the food is pretty delicious and authentic, but it also stems as part of the problem of what we were looking for. So take my review as my opinion and perspective on food.\\n\\nIf you are looking for an authentic Thai place, it's probably the place for you. For us, however, it was too authentic. You'd think you were really in Thailand eating on the street being served authentic Thai food. This normally would be a plus, but the smell that accompanies this prohibited us from enjoying the food itself. It was hard to focus on the taste of the actual food when coupled with the pungent smell of some other seafood dish being prepared.\\n\\nIt's a casual and popular restaurant, as there is often a line (30 min) and is popular with tourists visiting Portland. It's authentic, so if this is what you are looking for, you've found the right place. Oh, and if you brought that cup of coffee from down the street, you'd better finish it or they'll throw it out for you. A strict no outside beverage policy is rudely enforced.\\n\\nFood recommendations include the signature dish, the whole natural chicken wings. We had the pork skewers, along with the cucumber salad side dish. The food was excellent - can't say otherwise.\\n\\nOverall, mixed review. Great food, too authentic and pungent smells to enjoy what you are eating. That's my two cents."},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"This is the best Thai food I've ever had.  Long waits, but take-out if you need to.

My mother, who is severely lactose intolerant, was really excited because she usually can't find vegan pancakes anywhere. However, immediately after leaving she got VERY sick for the next 48 hours and five days later is still recovering - those pancakes were definitely made with milk and butter. \\n\\nI called the diner to let them know about my mother's reaction - if they're advertising that they're vegan then they should be vegan! Claiming that their food has certain ingredients and is made a certain way when it's not is not just a violation BUT CAN ACTUALLY BE HARMFUL TO PEOPLE'S HEALTH! I called them right after we left, no response, so I left a message with my number. No one every called me back. I called them again a few days later and whoever picked up refused to believe me - they told me she must of gotten sick from something/somewhere else (umm nope!). Needless to say, I won't be going back. If you really want your food vegan, then beware. \\n\\nThe rest of our food was fine, nothing out of this world, but nothing terrible. The homefries aren't really homefries but sage-flavored potato chips (still good, but not what I wanted at breakfast). The biscuits were the best part of the meal.

I wanted to give this place a couple of tries before reviewing it.  My office likes to order from here to reward us for when our sales team does well. The first time, I ordered the Tristan, which is supposed to have red peppers, mushrooms and pesto.  I also got the gluten free crust.  While I was impressed with the crust, which is crispy and tasty, and barely different from a \\"normal\\" crust, the rest of the pizza was disappointing.  The biggest issue was that they left off the pesto, which didn't make me too happy.  It was more like a cheese pizza with a very small amount of toppings.  I realize, however, that doing a large order for an office is probably difficult and not the same as ordering in person, especially given the mostly great reviews on here. \\nThis week, we ordered again and I had the Lucy Sunshine with a gluten free crust.  The toppings on this one are parmesan, artichokes, garlic and little dollops of red sauce.  I'm happy to report it was very good this go round!  The crust was excellent, again, and the toppings were plentiful.  It was chewy, crispy, and I could really taste the garlic and artichokes.

But, once I walked into the restroom my head was clear, I saw the sign, or the award. The chef/owner of Pok Pok received a 2011 James Beard award. They just  don't give those things out like stimulus money. This is a guy who earned his status, through hard work, dedication and a touch of genius. My mind was clear now, I was dealing with a no shit guy, who no shit, most likely knows how to cook.\\n\\nThe menu: yes it's very a typical of Thai street food. Mien Krub (I think I'm spellinging correctly) these are beautiful green leaves with dried shrimp, ginger, onion, an a paste with of course hot as he'll chili. You fold it up and pop it in your mouth. I also ordered the pork belly curry, which was very good. My sis got the pork satay, I liked it, but it was kind of Americanized and bland. The pork ribs were good and had a very Asian flare."},{"name":"Barlow","address":"737 SW Salmon St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"First time at Barlow last night for a good friends birthday.

After 2 hours, GrubHub informed me that the restaurant claimed they called me and left the food at the food because I didn't pick up. I definitely did not receive a call from them and I checked my door every half hour so that's just not true.

OK, that's an exaggeration, but we did order the fish and chips, steamed clams, fried Ipswich clams and the famed oyster sliders. The fish and chips was EXCELLENT. The fish was amazingly fresh and so was the fresh tartar sauce that came with it! It might actually have been better than British fish and chips! Can you hear my enthusiasm through the screen right now!?\\n\\nThe oyster sliders ($4 each but well worth it) were very unique: the oysters are deep fried and slipped carefully between two small burger buns with some dressing in between. What ensues is a small party in your mouth as you wolf the mini burger down. The only thing I wouldn't recommend among what we had ordered is the Ipswich clams, which were good but less amazing than the rest of the dishes. \\n\\nWould recommend sitting at the bar if you don't mind.

Luckily 4 of them decided to leave and we were able to get in quicker than expected (waited about 20-30 mins to be seated).\\n\\nThis is a very small place, seats a maximum of 20 people.

I honestly had no idea what to get since I'm not a big seafood fan, so we had to wait.\\n\\nOur waitress, can't remember her name, but she was so nice and helpful once she came back to us. I told her my dilemma with not being a big seafood fan and she suggested the black pasta, and I'm so glad she did because it was amazing.

I even asked if she could charge my phone for me and she was like oh yeah, no problem and went and put it to charge.\\n\\nMy husband ordered the Lobster Fra Diavolo (for one), because it's normally a two person plate, but even then that thing was HUGE! Two people can eat out of the one person one, it brings a whole lobster, clams, mussels, shrimp and calamari and pasta. You can leave it with the regular pasta or upgrade and pay a few more bucks for the black pasta (squid ink). I did try some of the lobster (because everyone said I had to have New England lobster before saying I don't like it), but after trying it multiple times I'm just not a fan, sorry...I tried :-/.\\n\\nAs I mentioned above I ended up ordering the Aglio Olio, which is the black pasta with ground squid saut√©ed with garlic and olive oil. I think I liked the squid only because it was ground up, otherwise I probably wouldn't have liked that either. I'm a huge fan of garlic and this dish had a ton of it, so that probably helped me love it more. My mouth is salivating just thinking back to this amazing pasta dish (even though it was 4 months ago that I had it)! I had the entree size of this, but I definitely could've gone for the appetizer size because I had left overs. Will definitely have this dish when we go back to Boston (hopefully later this year).\\n\\nAll the dishes come in the pans they are made in, so that's pretty cool.

Also I noticed the waitress took our order at the same time that she took the order of the people sitting next to us -- who had sat down about 5-10 minutes before us. We showed up at noon and were seated at 12:17, which isn't that bad for a busy brunch place, but seems silly when you see that there are empty tables right there in front of you...\\n\\nIt took another 10 minutes after ordering for coffee to arrive and when it did, it came without milk or sugar.

My friend had the omelet which looked perfectly fine. The apple cider, though, was really delicious. The coffee was only okay -- it tasted a bit acrid like it had been sitting around a bit, or the bean was over-extracted.

It is in an old house and the entire inside has been redone, and the outside is pretty much the same as it used to be. There are a few new cactii around, but the chairs and tables seem to be inherited from the previous owners? The inside ceiling and outside of the bar are oddly tiled with the white tiles you'd find in a 1950s era bathroom and there are lots of yellow orange lights hanging from the ceiling.

So, I'm too lazy to search to find out when vodka was officially recognized as a drink one could serve at a bar. Anyhoo, I'm a gin girl, so I was happy as a lark. I had the Ace Cocktail which was a gin fizz with egg whites, gin, soda, and is all kinds of yummy. Hubbie had a bourbon drink with orgeat and it was served with a metal swizzle straw!\\n\\nThe bathrooms are in a separate building and this reminded me of the setup from the Old School Paggi House from 10 years ago, back when they had DJs and showed movies outside (former owners). \\n\\nWe had an odd experience with the trees. They were releasing sticky stuff. You could see it falling from the sky. I thought it was rain but it wasn't. Then I thought I made it up, until I realized that my shirt and then my skirt were sticking to my chair. The same for the people next to us. It could have just been a high sporing day or whatnot, but it was a unique experience. \\n\\nI would definitely go here again. This is like East Side Show Room but much better because there's no messing around with the food and the crowds and etc. Also, the drinks are the best I've had in a very long time. \\n\\nPlease note that it is currently easy to find parking in the back.

A small restaurant that had its own cheese and deli counter inside the place, TVs showing the World Cup (they open at 7:00am to begin showing the World Cup games!) and soccer jerseys hanging from every available area, it felt more like a small pasta place in Italy than an establishment in Portland. \\n\\nWe were greeted at the door by a very friendly host who was more than happy to fulfill our request for outdoor seating and had a table made up for us in no time. While waiting for our waitress we snacked on the delicious Italian breads and balsamic/olive oil dipping sauce on the table. Our waitress was prompt and helpful. She was very knowledgeable about the wines and directed us towards a delicious red wine that was affordable. We ordered the Osso Bucco and the Fruitta Di Mar. The Osso Bucco was delicious! Served on a bed of creamy polenta, the meat was so tender we could cut it with a fork (literally). The sauce was zesty and tasted very fresh. The Fruitta Del Mar was also very delicious. With Portland being a coastal city the seafood was fresh and you could taste it. The sauce was light and garlicky and the pasta was aldente perfection!\\n\\nBut the highlight was dessert! I ordered the tiramisu, which unlike other chain restaurants, was not covered in chocolate sauce and bathed in cream. Instead it was deliciously restrained and had just enough coffee flavor that it wasn't too sweet. Now, the profiteroles were something else altogether. I don't think I have ever tasted anything so good. The profiteroles were light and fluffy, covered with an airy chocolate mousse it was heavenly! \\n\\nEven though we were dining pretty late, our waitress never rushed us to leave and let us linger at the table and chat as she finished her side work. She was very friendly yet not overbearing. She chatted just enough to be friendly and left us alone to enjoy our meal. \\n\\nIf you're in Portland and want a relaxing and affordable Italian experience, Piazza Italia is your place!

The Chorizo-egg was on the bland side and the egg was overcooked, the pastor was soggy, and the sope was too thick.  The flour tortillas are store bought, and the homemade corn ones were not very good.  I had one of their fruit drinks and it was sweetened with aspartame (GROSS).

Perhaps on second thought that sounds even more emphatic than I want to be, but certainly Mad Mex is not so bad as to warrant a two-star rating.\\n\\nMad Mex is dark, kind of scary, and fun. Pretty much any place that sells tequila shots in groups of three is bound to be dark, kind of scary, and fun, though. The food at Mad Mex is definitely and most assuredly merely okay, although by the prices you'd expect a heck of a lot more food with a heck of a lot more flavor. Nor shall I ever forgive Mad Mex for removing from their menu my favorite item, the cheesesteak wrap. Infuriating!\\n\\nThe service is a bit lacking in terms of how often you get any real service at all, which is probably due to the fact that Mad Mex is in the middle of the South Campus Gateway and is, therefore, nearly always busy from the early evening on. When school is in session and it's a nice night out, this place is only really worth it if you catch their late-night, half-off (certain) menu items deals.\\n\\nMad Mex is probably a much better place to just drink than it is to sit and eat: I wouldn't know, however, because I always end up eating there. I could never quite recommend it because of the prices, but on the other hand I'd never tell anyone not to go, either.\\n\\nAs a side note and as a mark of good karma, this place had the courtesy to once show a kind heart and allowed a good friend of mine to indulge a fit of depression by getting stone drunk, stripping naked in the men's room, and vomiting repeatedly over the course of an hour and an half over the loss of a dear pet. \\"Don't let anyone see him,\\" a waiter who came in to use the bathroom warned me with an understanding nod.

As others note, Powell's is just a massive, MASSIVE bookstore located on Burnside.  It's in a great neighborhood with plenty to eat nearby.

Given where Powell's is located and the scarcity of parking in Portland in general, I was fine with that price.\\n\\nPowell's is 4 stories and approximately a block of new and used books.  What's nice is that the new and used books are mixed in together.  So, one of the books I bought my son I thought was new turned out to be used, just in great condition.  This makes shopping easier, you can just look for your topic of book in one spot rather than going back and forth from new to used.\\n\\nIn addition to books, there are all sorts of Portland souvenirs and other items like t-shirts, mugs, stickers, games, toys, etc.  My 5 year old son loved it, he could have looked at stuff all day.

We tried to order with the black crab (supposedly fermented crab), but the waitress recommended trying without it first.  She said it's really fishy.  I've had fermented raw crab in soy sauce (a Korean dish) before, but I chickened out.  The other dish was cold rice noodle with pineapple, ginger, green mango, and dry shrimp.  It had a lot of flavor and was bit spicy.  It was not as good as Papaya dish, but was decent.  As the menu recommended, we ordered the sticky rice with the Papaya dish.  The rice was good, but very small.\\n\\nThe service was okay, but not that great.  For the price, you get so little food.  And, NONE of the dishes come WITH the rice.  Holy cow, I've never been in an asian restaurant that doesn't serve rice unless you order them.  They charge $1.50-$2 per rice (one is certainly not enough for me)\\n\\nI tried the dessert.  The Durian with Sticky Rice.  Yeah, that was the best one that Pok Pok had for the night.  I loved it.  That was my first durian experience, too.  It was supposed to smell bad, but it was not bad at all.\\n\\nThe drinking vinegar with tamarind was OK.  I had a high expectation for that and I was bit disappointed.  After spending $60, we came out unfullfilled.  I will be back for the dessert and try other dishes.  But, it's probably not worth waiting for 45 minutes.\\n\\nThey don't take AMEX.

Again, I opened it and thought they must have sent the wrong item.

The chicken was sickly sweet with some kind of sauce all over it. (BBQ? Teriyaki? I wasn't sure. I just knew it had NOTHING to do with Mexican food!) The quesadilla has the same sickly sweet chicken in it and some cheese. All of the cheese was jammed in one piece of the quesadilla. The rest just had the chicken, and none were filled edge to edge. You ate mosty just flour tortilla and occasionally got some filling...which was OK, because it was gross.\\n\\nWhen I finally found the \\"nachos\\" under everything, the chips were overcooked.

They do the normal breakfast fare: bagels, sandwiches, coffee as well as lunch.  I would highly reccomend lunch, they make their own antipesto to use in the sandwiches and salads.

When you walk up, it looks like an overgrown food cart.  There is a shack-like cooking building in the center, with two separate semi-outdoor seating areas (tarped and filled with heat lamps), and finally the main inside restaurant area (which is crammed tight with wall booths, small wooden tables and a tiny bar against the back wall).  Very minimally decorated throughout all areas.\\n\\nEating at Pok Pok was a whole night affair, as the wait for a table alone was almost two hours (granted it was a Saturday night, but I think this is standard operating procedure here).  No worries though, as Division Street offers many great places to knock back a few drinks and happily waste some time (see my reviews on both Matchbox Lounge and Whiskey Soda Lounge, which are both right across the street).  Whiskey Soda Lounge is owned by Pok Pok, so if you head there they will call there directly when your table is ready, which is exactly what we did.  We lucked out and after all the waiting we were seated at a table in the inside restaurant area (though it still was cold with the door constantly opening and closing to grab the food from the outdoor kitchen).  This is definitely a place where you order a bunch of menu items to share, and pair them all with some cold beer, such as the sweet taste of Beer Lao (which paired amazingly with all of the SPICY dishes)...here is the list:\\n\\n1) Papaya Pok Pok (w/Salted Black Cod) - Green papaya salad with tomatoes, long beans, Thai chili, lime juice, tamarind, fish sauce, garlic, palm sugar, dried shrimp and peanuts made to order in the Pok Pok (mortar and pestle). Our namesake. Add Salted Black Crab $2.50\\n* This dish was way too fishy smelling and tasting for me, the hard-shelled crabs were a pain, and overall I was bummed, just not my style.\\n2) Muu Paa Kham Waan - Boar collar meat rubbed with garlic, coriander root and black pepper, glazed with soy and sugar, grilled over charcoal and served with chilled mustard greens and a spicy chili-lime-garlic sauce. Northern Thai drinking food.\\na* Um...yeah, what else can I say?  Best dish we had, even though it is so spicy they have to serve a plate of chilled greens to eat it with! \\n\\n3) Kaeng Hung Leh - Northern Thai sweet pork belly and pork shoulder curry with ginger, palm sugar, tamarind, turmeric, Burmese curry powder and pickled garlic.\\n* A close second for the best dish: bursting with flavor from the amazing combinations of seasonings, and perfectly tender pork.\\n\\n4) Kung Yak Phao - Giant prawns, brined and grilled whole over charcoal, served with naam jiim thaleh, a spicy lime/garlic/chile dipping sauce.  \\n* These prawns were huge, served whole (you peel) with a refreshing, but of course spicy, sauce.\\n\\n5) Ike's Vietnamese Fish Sauce Wings - Fresh natural chicken wings marinated in fish sauce, garlic and sugar, deep fried, tossed in caramelized Phu Quoc fish sauce and garlic and served with Vietnamese table salad. Our daytime grill cook Ich Truong's recipe from his home in Vietnam.\\n* These are indeed finger-licking deliciousness, but we ordered the \\"spicy\\" versions, so I could only handle one.  I suggest ordering them regular style and enjoying!\\n\\nWe ordered sticky rice and jasmine rice to accompany everything, and even though the taste of these was nothing special, I was so thankful for them!  It was the only thing that would cut the sting on my tongue! \\n\\nAdmittedly, we ordered wrong for my taste.  I do love spicy food, but every single dish we ordered was spicy, and each outdid the other.  By the middle of the meal my mouth completely shut down and couldn't handle anything else, which was a total bummer considering how much food we ordered!

The waiter was friendly & refilled our coffee cups w/Stumptown french pressed coffee over & over. We choose to eat outside on the patio because the inside was a bit cramped. They have the BEST breakfast in Portland. Very friendly & not snooty! Worth the drive from the westside. Nothing like that over there. Almost forgot the awesome coffee cake with raspberries. Amazing."},{"name":"The Daily Catch","address":"323 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"The first time I came here was when I was a senior in college.  My dad was in town for business, so my girlfriend at the time and I drove into Boston from Worcester to see him.  He picked this place.  It was positively tiny; there are only 6 or so tables, and you are literally inside the kitchen.  But you know, that's actually part of the appeal for me.  I love food and I love to cook; I also love to watch other people kicking ass in the culinary department, which is what they do here.  I still remember 8 years later what I ordered.  I had a Chilean sea bass in red sauce over pasta.  Nothin too fancy, but oh God it was good.  So good.  I remember to this day how amazing the food was, and how the three of us were just having a lovely time eating this delicious food (and knocking through several bottles of wine).  The last time I came here I had their puttanesca with squid ink linguine.  I could have eaten it forever.  Spicy enough to wake you up but not spicy enough to melt your face.  And the way the pasta blended with the strong flavor of the sauce?  Heavenly.  Downside is that this place can have the tendency to be very crowded, due to the caliber of the cuisine and the fact that the North End is always jam packed with tourists and self-entitled douchebags.  Also, some people might take offense to certain things such as wine being served in paper cups.  But you know what?  Fuck them.  It's all about taste, and the Daily Catch delivers.  Have I had better seafood dishes before?  No doubt.  But the ones from the Daily Catch are the ones I remember."},{"name":"Sushi Kiku","address":"2770 Lenox Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"even though they say they're open until midnight on saturday, they will passively kick you out at 11 p.m.\\n\\nwe came around 10 p.m. for the decent 1/2 off sushi.  we ordered a couple of drinks, even. i'm sorry we came here late, but we specifically came here because i saw that it was open until midnight on the weekends.\\n\\naround 11 p.m., the server literally said: \\"can you sign the check so we can leave?\\" then around 11:10 p.m. they turned off half the lights and the music.. oh and the TV on which my beau was watching sports.  the other remaining table made comments about it and started leaving. my beau still had not finished his beer. 11:15 p.m., my beau was getting angry and wanted to stay until 11:30 p.m. out of spite. i persuaded him to leave then, so the staff can go home.  but by then, most of the staff had left except for maybe the busgirl and the owner. \\n\\ni would also appreciate it if the server would come by before i'm halfway done with my meal before asking if i need anything.   \\n\\ni'm sorry i came late. but i don't want to feel rushed when you clearly say that you're open until midnight. i guess it's our fault. *shrug* we get what we pay for?"},{"name":"The Greek By Anatoli","address":"1043 Mainland Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"The place is located close to Yaletown station. We went for dinner and the place was packed so we had to sit in the patio which was not bad because the weather was nice and it's a nice patio. We ordered souvlaki platter for 2~4 ppl, pita bread, humous and chocolate mousse. The souvlaki platter portion was more for 2 ppl I would say. I loved all the things we ordered except for the chocolate mousse because we thought it might be more like an ice cream but it was more like whipped cream. It is supposed to be a mousse so it was our fault for not seeing the food's name. I would definitely go back again for the souvlaki platter which was delicious and I would love to try the rabbit plates which seem very interesting:)"}]`),R={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:z},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:6,poemsData:O,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.poemsData.filter(n=>{const e=this.searchQuery.toLowerCase();return n.name.toLowerCase().includes(e)||n.city.toLowerCase().includes(e)||n.text.toLowerCase().includes(e)}).slice(0,this.visibleCount):this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},E={class:"search-container"},j={class:"card-container"},D=["disabled"],N={key:0},L={key:1};function G(n,e,s,f,i,r){const u=p("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"üéâ Restaurant Reviews ü•≥")])],-1)),t("div",E,[e[2]||(e[2]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"üîç",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=h=>i.searchQuery=h),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[v,i.searchQuery]])]),t("div",j,[(a(!0),o(y,null,m(r.filteredPoems,(h,g)=>(a(),k(u,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),r.hasMorePoems?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:i.isLoading,onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=(...h)=>r.loadMore&&r.loadMore(...h))},[i.isLoading?(a(),o("span",L,"Loading...")):(a(),o("span",N,"See more"))],8,D)):w("",!0)])}const H=c(R,[["render",G],["__scopeId","data-v-635219ac"]]),Y=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"glossary/13.md","filePath":"glossary/13.md"}'),F={name:"glossary/13.md"},K=Object.assign(F,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(a(),o("div",null,[I(H)]))}});export{Y as __pageData,K as default};
