The servers were busy running around everywhere and it was really hard to flag them down for any help. We had called about a week beforehand to make a reservation for 6 pm. I didn't think we needed it, but I'm glad we had one given how busy it was.\\n\\nMost dishes are pretty affordable, in the $12-15 range. The majority of dishes are marked with either 1 or 2 peppers indicating their spice level, but it is possible to ask them to make it less spicy.\\n\\nHakka noodles are the quintessential Indo Chinese food, so we ordered it vegetarian style. It's a big plate of noodles, so definitely good bang for your buck. It was marked as 2 chili peppers but not as spicy as I thought it'd be.\\n\\nWe also ordered the Bombay style garlic prawns, which we asked to make not spicy, and they delivered. It came with a lot of sauce to eat with rice and also shrimp chips. Prawns were giant and well flavored. This was probably my favorite dish.\\n\\nFor our veggie dish, we ordered eggplant with green beans. It was a delicious stir fry, though the portions were a bit small.\\n\\nWe also ordered Manchurian chicken, but they were so busy that they forgot about this order. By the time we asked our server about it and she said the kitchen can still make it for us, we were done with the rest of the 3 dishes and them to cancel the chicken.\\n\\nYou have to go up to the counter to pay, which can take a while if it's busy and there is a line like there was for us. I recommend sending just one person up, as there isn't much room to stand.\\n\\nThere is a small parking lot behind the restaurant with 8 spots, but when we went, it was already full. We found parking pretty easily on the next residential street over."},{"name":"Little Donkey","address":"505 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Just what Central square needed!

Turns out I'm: Wrong and a N00b. \\n\\nAfter taking my NCLEX, riddled with caffeine and red eyes from lack of sleep,  I knew I'd have to kill some (nerve racking) time before I could check if I'd passed or not, and also there were obnoxiously loud nosy asian guests at the home, so I got off before the perimeter and took a cruise. Honestly I didn't plan on coming here, I passed it, oh, I should go there, hm.. oh my goodness why is the parking at Follies full on a Tuesday afternoon at 1:30? ok the world is going to poop, lets get that sandy, u-turn, ok Lee's. \\n\\nParking close to it was full, so I parked on the other side of the gas station. I could smell pho as I was walking up, and it was nice. Its very busy for lunch. There was a line as soon as you open the door. \\n\\nThe first thing I noticed that the shape of the restaurant is sooo weird. Its angular at one end. Visually it was strange to me because it just didn't make a lot of sense. \\n\\nThe 2nd thing I noticed is that WHITE PEOPLE LOVE LEE'S. Like 80% of the people were white. This is cool because when I worked in buckhead, people used to ask for less garlic in their food because they didn't want to smell like garlic when they went back to their office. But here it was the opposite, they were rollicking and gallavanting in the intense aromas of greasy beef broth and smelly herbs, saturating their suit fibers to be dispersed later in their respective offices. Interesting. As I was walking out with my food, I saw a couple in a silver SUV slam on their brakes and point at me. I thought they were gawking at the smoothie, n00bs, but I could hear them say 'is that it?' so It seems like they were pointing at lee's and not me and destined to come here. \\n\\n3rd.

I can't eat raw jalapeno, plucked those out quick. \\nI actually took it to go and ate it on the patio of sweet hut. Does that make me an ass? No. Whatever.

Ordering\\nTrev and I split The Burger ($11.25) - Griddled 8oz burger w/ bacon, cheddar, spinach, tomato, red onion, and love. Comes with ruffles. \\n\\nWayne and Sumana also split The Burger.\\n\\nII. The burgers\\nThis burger really hit the spot. Everything was awesome! The patty was meaty, very juicy, and cooked perfectly. It was nicely seasoned and nice and peppery. The bun was gooey as we like it, and it was the same size as the patty. The bun was pretty thin, but there was still a great meat-to-bun ratio. It was impressive that the bun held up despite the juiciness of the patty. The sauce was great complement to the meatiness of the patty. The cheese was shredded, which is not something we've seen before and it was not fully melted, but still yummy. Trevor appreciated that the burger was wrapped in wax paper that helped hold the burger together and prevented some messiness. The bacon was nice and salty, and added a nice crunch to the burger. There were no pickles in this burger, which is usually a gripe but we felt okay without pickles in this burger. The spinach and red onions were good and added a bright note to the burger. Trevor exclaimed, \\"I don't hate myself right now!\\" That's pretty impressive considering how much we had already eaten at that point in the day.  Oh, and I totally tasted the love in the burger! That must be their secret.\\n\\nIII. The Fries/Sides\\nBurgers come with ruffles chips, which were a great accompaniment to the burger. We believe they are parmesan ruffles? \\n\\nIV. Miscellaneous\\nThis place is a tiny box parked in between the Gibson Street Bar and Stonehouse Coffee and Bar. You can order your food and bring it into either place. Both locations have indoor and outdoor seating, and they still deliver the food to you. Luke's is located in a trendy, hipster area of Austin. There are several small parking lots around, and it can be hard to find parking. There's also street parking if you can find it.  \\n\\nV. Value\\nWe have a new way to measure value. I ask the members how much they would pay for the burger they ate. We would pay anywhere from $8 to $9.50 for this burger. So this burger is a little on the high side since it's priced at $11.25 (including fries). \\n\\nVI. The verdict\\nThis burger is the best we've had so far in Austin. It hit all the right notes. The ratings: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, and 4.5. \\n\\nNext burger crew meeting: Hopfield's, June 4, 2017 for first lunch."},{"name":"Shabusen Yakiniku House","address":"755 Burrard Street, Suite 202","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"This place is good in choices, instead of quality when eating here for AYCE.\\nThe food here is really low quality like most AYCE Sushi places in Vancouver.

Worst Mexican food I've ever had. Granted, I did go on their \\"first day\\" opening, but unfortunately their first impression was a complete train wreck. \\n\\nWhere to begin... firstly, the name is very deceiving. They're not a kitchen, or even a restaurant, they're a food truck. They advertised their business with a \\"grand opening\\" which gave me the impression it was a new establishment, what I found out when I arrived is that they just parked their food truck in front a warehouse half full of tables. The location is terrible, in the ghetto, down a side street, across from several junk car lots. I wanted to have an open mind, and also hoped the food was worth it, so I ignored my instincts to leave and gave it a go. \\n\\nI ordered the Mission Burrito with Cauliflower and Potato, Enchilada Verdes with Cauliflower and Potato, and the Nachos Supreme. It took ONE HOUR TWENTY MINUTES from the time I got into line to the time my food arrived. There was a steady line of people but this was a completely ridiculous amount of time to wait for food truck quality food. Still, I remained patient, hoping it would be the most amazing Mexican food I've ever tried. \\n\\nWhile waiting all that time, I was able to observe the place as a whole and it was disgusting. No one was wiping down tables, the floors were filthy, the music was too loud (they were yelling out peoples orders and no one could hear over the music), it was really hot and there was no fans or air circulation (it wasn't even that hot of a day), the bathroom in the back was gross and the soap was watered down so you couldn't even wash off the filth from sitting in there. Guess it's everything you'd expect from a warehouse operation in the ghetto. \\n\\nWhen our food FINALLY was ready, unfortunately, it was COLD and WRONG. Instead of the Enchilada Verdes with Cauliflower and Potato, I got an Enchilada with Sweet Potato and Black Beans with Red Sauce. I was so hungry by the time it came out I didn't even want to take it back for fear of having to wait even longer. Plus, while discovering the order was wrong, I was nibbling on the other items and was so disappointed that telling them it was wrong wasn't even worth the effort or time. The Mission Burrito was so plain, it literally was just tortilla and potato, NO beans/vegan cheese/vegan sour cream/salsa verde/cauliflower. The Nachos Supreme had no vegan sour cream and the chips were not fresh, it looked like they just dumped a can of beans on the chips. The Enchilada (in addition to being wrong) had no vegan cheese/vegan sour cream topping. \\n\\nIt's like they ran out of ingredients and said \\"Oh well! No one will notice.\\" -because they're a freakin' food truck in the middle of the ghetto!\\n\\nApparently, they've been a food truck for several years servicing the Orlando area.

The lady at the check-in quoted me a 30-45 minute wait.  Alright- cool! Not bad for a Saturday afternoon.

We had to wait for the party to leave and for the table to be cleared of half eaten food.\\n\\nI forgot to add, while we were waiting for our bay, we grabbed a table by the bar.  It was a large high-top table that seated all 8 of us.  No one came and acknowledged our presence.

It was called the lobster tail, now this is not the lobster tail you get at a fancy restaurant, but more of a cream filled extravaganza of massive weight gain.  \\n\\nWhen I picked up the box, and we got three items by the way, my first thought was how can this thing be so darn heavy.  The box was filled with three items, an espresso (which is a type of cannoli here), a somewhat small piece of strawberry cheesecake, and the lobster tail.  Now physically the lobster tails itself looked pretty darn big, it was obviously filled with cream.  But, I've seen so many similar types of pastries before, looks gigantic but light as a feather. Not so with this lobster tail, if anything the size of this particular pastry understates its apparent density.  In other words, this thing was really really heavy. The cream inside was entirely of a heavy variety, much heavier than even The heavy whipped cream I found in grocery stores.\\n\\nThis was not the sweetest thing ever, but it sure was the heaviest. Between the three of us, my wife, my daughter, and I, We could not even finish that one lobster tail. Now ordinarily I would complain that $5 for a single pastry would be a bit much, but not here, if anything, the lobster tail was cheap for what it delivered.\\n\\nAlthough I would strongly suggest that after finishing off one of these monsters, you would be best off climbing up to Bunker Hill Monument. That might lose you about a third of the weight that you just put on consuming that thing.  Now, even three hours after eating just about a third of that lobster tail, I can still feel it weighing down my gut.  Whoever picked the location for Mike's pastry here made a very wise decision in locating it near Mass Gen Hospital.

They tasted very out of a package to me.\\n\\nOverall, I'd say the food here was good, but I think for a diner, it's a bit pricey, so if you're expecting diner prices for a burger, you're better off at some other spots in town.

The margarita on the rocks pitcher was a \\"eye winker\\"...you know, one eye closes type of deal...but I could have done without the slushy ice in the pitcher and glasses full of regular ice.

The Extra Fresca, hibiscus agua fresca and rum, was also quite stout. \\n\\nChips are good and fresh. Both salsa's are tasty, but neither have any real spice to them.\\n\\nI like how the chicken fajita nachos are served. Each chip (all 8) have equal amounts of cheese, beans, and meat on them. Extras like guac, sour cream, and jalapenos are in the center so you can decide how much you want to add. All this adds up to the neatest set of nachos ever to be consumed. You won't wind up with queso on your cheek or beans in your lap which is great.\\n\\nThe small salad is chock full of veggies and is a good sized side at $5. The added grilled shrimp to make it a light entree is $7 more. Kind of steep since the shrimp were overcooked and rubbery. Even steeper if you consider a typical entree sized shrimp salad would run you $17. Whew! I'll stick to meat free salads next time.\\n\\nTo sum it all up, if I'm gonna eat real mexican I would prefer to hit up Buford Highway. If I want this kind of bastardized mexican I would rather just go to Mezcalito's in Grant Park. There's rarely a wait and they have good food at cheaper prices.

They sold it and started this. This area can benefit from a Korean chicken place. There seems to be a revival of Korean restaurants in the area.\\n\\nThe interior wasn't done during the soft opening so the pictures are misleading. It's spacious inside. They seem to be aiming for a modern twist. They had 4 TVs up front in an area with distressed wood and tiles to finish off a clean, modern look much like Dish down the street.\\n\\nThey are going to have to look into young servers if they want to finish off the modern touch though.

It comes with cabbage salad, 1 dumpling, and a few pieces of tokpogi, and soup.

We arrived a little after 4 p.m. on a Thursday and were promptly greeted and seated in the bar - the bartender was also our server.  She was fast, but definitely not friendly.  I gave her some slack, since she was pregnant and it would just not be fun to be on your feet all day while preggo.  The drinks were yummy - I had a spicy jalapeno mango martini, and hubby had a lemon drop.  Both were good, and cheap ($5).  We had dinner plans later, so we only ordered one appetizer, their house-made fries.  The fries were great, but were served with about 1/2 a tablespoon of aioli.  Seemed a little skimpy to me.\\n\\nThe troubles began when a couple of larger parties (the after-work crowd) appeared around 5 p.m.  The bar staff (by now there were a couple of waiters) seemed overwhelmed.  A couple seated just after we were ended up leaving in a huff, having been completely ignored by the wait staff trying to attend to these larger groups.  We asked for our check three times before finally receiving it.  \\n\\nI tend to rate restaurants based on whether I'd go back, and sadly the answer is a big no here.

We were here late at around 10 PM for a post-dinner dinner (we were on vacation), and the restaurant was still jumping with tons of people. The blaring live music on the second floor just wasn't for me, as all I wanted was to eat some good barbecue, so bear that in mind if you are looking to have a relaxing meal.\\n\\nOn to the food, everything was pretty good:\\n\\n- Jalape√±o Cheddar Corn Muffins\\nThese free muffins to start were ok, but I'm glad I didn't have to pay for them.\\n\\n- Roasted Green Chili Queso ($8)\\nThese chips were not great. They were cold and looked store bought. Dip anything into that hot, neon yellow cheese though, and it will taste decent enough.\\n\\n- Lambert's Baked Mac & 3 Cheeses ($7)\\nThis was my favorite thing here. I like mac less runny and less cheesy, so this was heaven. It was piping hot with chewy mac and really delicious cheese all over it, but not the wet kind. Make sure you try this side.\\n\\n- Country Style Pork Ribs ($18)\\nThese were ok, but too fatty for my liking. There were 3 pretty large ribs, but a good portion of each them was mostly fat. The little quality meat I could find happened to be very good, but there just wasn't enough of it.\\n\\n- Natural Black Angus Beef Brisket ($18)\\nThis was really good, but some of the pieces unfortunately were a bit on the dry side and could have benefited greatly from some BBQ sauce. If you are one that likes your brisket moist aka marbled and fatty, you will probably not like this at all.\\n\\n- Cherry Fried Pie ($8)\\nThis was super sweet. The best part of this dessert though was the Pistachio White Chocolate Ice Cream. It was an absolute must to go along with the hot, overwhelming fried pie. The pie was mostly just the really thick, fried crust, with not nearly enough of the cherry filling. The crust didn't have much flavor, which made this a bit weak.\\n\\n- Butter Pecan Bread Pudding ($8)\\nThis dessert was a real winner - smothered in maple black pepper sauce, with a refreshing scoop of tangerine ice cream on top, the butter pecan bread pudding was indeed super buttery, but it was delicious. Once again, I like how these are served with ice cream, which go really well with the warm, rich desserts.\\n\\nAfter reading reviews later, I'm kicking myself for not coming here for the supposed all you can eat brunch, which sounds much better. Otherwise, at these high prices, it's not worth the relatively mediocre barbecue compared to some good old trucks and other less flashy places with much better food."},{"name":"Karma - Concord","address":"105 Thoreau St","city":"Concord","stars":"4","text":"We love this place so much!

At check in we were told reservations were running behind. They have a small seating area inside to wait. We were seated by 8p. The restaurant is dark by nature of its theme. Not a ton of decor, fairly basic. I appreciated we got a decent table that gave us plenty of space. I saw that people with only 2 people in their party were sitting very close to other parties - the type of feeling that everyone can hear your conversation because there's not much of a barrier. \\n\\nThe server explained our options for the dining plan. She came back to check on our drink orders but seemed put off when we had more questions and left us to talk with another table. The service continued with this vibe during our entire dinner though and it became uncomfortable to ask for things, plus when you did request something (ie - ketchup, drink) you waited a long while to get it.\\n\\nI ordered a filet mignon and it was cooked nicely at medium. The listed sides are barely a serving which was disappointing since soup and salad were also extra charges. My husband and son got the NY strip and it was incredibly fatty. By the time my son removes the gristle he had only half of the steak he started with. Again the sides were disappointing. My youngest didn't like the kids menu in general and got a grilled cheese ... yes, we gave us 2 table services for grilled cheese and fries so terrible no one would eat them. \\n\\nDesserts are impressive in design, okay in flavor. We couldn't order what we actually wanted because their freezer was broken. \\n\\nOverall, average food and service. Super disappointed for the prices and value we received. We ordered steak in other restaurants and Le Cellier ranked lowest.

Food is prepared with obvious care--little touches like caramelized tomatoes served with the dereke tibs are appreciated. Portion sizes are generous. Prices are a little higher than the median for Ethiopian food around the metro area; cf. spots like Embilta or Bahel, which cost a bit less for food of comparable quality. Still, Mela's atmosphere makes it worthwhile--very polished dining experience. Staff is warm and friendly, and the owner is often behind the bar--extremely nice guy, and apparently the recipes are his wife's originals. Highly recommended.\\n\\nEndnote: I saw another review complaining about \\"unusually dark injera.\\"  A darker color usually just means that the injera in question has a higher proportion of teff (as opposed to lighter injera, which tends to be 50/50 teff and wheat.) Full-teff injera tends to be a bit more sour, but this is often seen as a positive by aficionados of Ethiopian food, as it's more authentic. Desta, for instance, offers 100% teff injera at an extra charge vis-a-vis their usual injera. I don't know what blend Mela uses, but dark injera is not an indicator of bad quality, and anyone who says otherwise doesn't really know what they're talking about :).

Nothing is good about this restaurant and is the biggest disappointment I've seen in a long time and I've been to a lot of restaurants.  First off considering it's a pizza place, they should be able to cook good pizza.  I mean, that's what I thought.  Pizza was way too thick, greasy and came out burnt and cold.  As another person put it, the toppings looked like they had just been thrown on.  Some slices had lots of cheese and veggies while other slices barely had any.  It also had way too much pizza sauce.  To the point where it was literally gushing out and it was very messy and not in a good way.  My friend ordered some pasta dish and she was not happy with it either.  Way too much sauce and the pasta didn't seem cooked fully.\\n\\nNow for the atmosphere.  Our server was pretty nice, but you could tell she wasn't really happy working there or being there.  I brushed it off, I've been a server before and know that sometimes you just have off days and it's hard to hide it.  Then I saw the owner and it all made sense.  He was yelling at a cook so loud, multiple tables noticed and we're looking over.  Not sure what the cook did but, the cook was not arguing back at all.  Sometimes people mess up, I understand that I used to work in a restaurant but, things need to be handled professionally and this was not professional at all.  I felt very uncomfortable and bad for the cook.\\n\\nThe owner treats most of his employees terribly.  I could help but, notice he was especially rude and disrespectful to the female employees.  I later learned from other friends that this behaviour is not uncommon from the owner.  Owner is very grumpy and rude.

I asked to have the same coffee again as that was really my only option, and while I was waiting the barista decided that it was his opportunity to 'school' me in what a soy latte looks like.  He essentially scolded me and told me it's going to be the same.  I explained that this was like no latte I had even had and he said 'that is just the soy, it's always like that'.  This discussion went back and forth with me tring to explain that there was something really wrong (this is not my first rodeo) with the drink I got and him continuing to scold me until the man behind him (manager?) told him to stop and just make the coffee.  At this point he had just started my new drink.  The condescending manner with which I was educated on making coffee by someone who managed to sell me a $4.50 sludge earlier was unbelievable.

The one thing you constantly hear about is the line out the door and complaints of everyone trying to get in and get their own favorite riff on the classic Italian cannoli. \\n\\nWell, I can tell you two things after our trip there a few weeks ago; first - all the praise is well-deserved and of all the things we got we did not have a single thing we would not go back for specifically. Second, the wait is worth what you get once you get to the counter. \\n\\nPeople are yelling and talking fast when you get to the counter, but it's strangely coordinated for all the mayhem that appears to be going on. Strangely efficient and despite the noise, everyone is very pleasant. I guess the reason for the long wait is due to most people buying a dozen or so baked goods, so wait your turn and be patient before getting your chance to experience what has only been rivaled by the version we had in Florence, Italy. We got the classic, tiramisu, and oreo cannolis as well as the Boston Creme puff. \\n\\nWhile the items were sweet it didn't throw you into a full blown sugar coma. The shells offer a great contrast in crunchy texture compared to the smooth, creamy ricotta filling that is mixed in with the various flavors and bits to achieve their take on well-known goodies. The creme puff was a more delicate version of the classic Dunkin' Boston Creme doughnut, very akin to the pastries we had in Paris with a Boston twist for the filling. You don't need to travel abroad in order to get world-class dessert pastries and treats... Mike's has you covered in this \\"in and out\\" storefront. \\n\\nFull disclaimer, we took a few things home and they got a little soggy over 2-3 days.

Inside, the restaurant is separated into three main areas. A retail space to purchase paraphernalia and memorabilia, a dessert section, and a main dining section (two floors!). The decor is themed in 19th century Steampunk with a modern twist of old and new. The place is littered with intriguing gizmo's and gadgetry and giant screens cycle scenes of a running factory give off a fun (albeit retro) and inviting environment. The (character) mastermind behind the business is Professor Doctor Penelope Tibeaux-Tinker Toothsome. Sporting vintage fashion with a modern, sassy twist, she patrols the place ensuring all the guests are taken care of (see my tip if you have kids).\\n\\nThe menu is quite extensive carrying a variety of appetizers, entr√©es, salads, sandwiches, and hamburgers. They also serve brunch and, of course, no meal would be complete without an array of milkshakes, sundaes, and desserts. Our selections for the evening included: Harissa spiced Pork Kababs, Kettle Chip Nachos, Baked Brie en Cro√ªte, Fettuccine Carbonara, Toothsome Ni√ßoise, Red Velvet Milkshake, and May Contain Nuts.\\n\\nPork Kababs. What appeared as two corn dogs turned out to be Bacon wrapped pork kabobs, Presentation wise, these were spot on! The bacon was premium cut, and was smoked. The fat to pork ratio was near perfect (see pic). On it's own, the bacon kabob was salty. The bacon paired well with the drier, leaner cut of pork underneath and did a decent job in keeping it moist. With the cilantro-mayo dipping sauce, the kebobs were even better; getting additional elements of creaminess and moisture.The kabobs rested atop a mixture mango and cabbage slaw where the mango was more in the dressing than the slaw providing a sweetness to the dish.  3,5 stars.\\n\\nNachos. Space constraint, see pic for comments. 4 stars.\\n\\nBaked Brie en Cro√ªte. Brie is a region in France SE of Paris where this soft white cheese is made. It carries a mild flavour from cows grazing on the grass of stony riverbeds. Not to be mistaken with Camembert which is made way out west near the coast of Normandy by a different breed of cows graze on lush green pastures (producing a much stronger and sharper taste). To me, a good Brie en Cro√ªte would be one that is flavoured without outshining this subtle cheese, and the puff pastry is even and not too thick. The version served here was topped with raspberry marmalade and served with warm chocolate almond bread. Strawberries, blackberries, and almonds complemented the dish. There was a good ratio of filling to cheese, the brie was thoroughly melted, and the puff pastry was a nice golden brown. The fruit was fresh, but what stole the show was the Chocolate Almond Bread. This was absolutely delicious!  The bread is available as an appetizer and a must try! 4,5 stars.\\n\\nFettuccine Carbonara. Like most pasta, it's all about the sauce! Carbonara is a simple sauce made from eggs, bacon (panchetta), and cheese. This version had pork belly for protein, and peas which added both texture and colour to the dish. The sauce was a good consistency and kept its richness. The pasta was cooked al dent√©. Simple ingredients, good flavour, and a decent portion. 4 stars.\\n\\nToothsome Ni√ßoise. Ni√ßoise salad is similar to that of a summer salad. It contains fresh greens, tomatoes, hard boiled eggs, Ni√ßoise olives, and is dressed in olive oil. Their version of this French classic adds seared Ahi (tuna), potatoes, asparagus, and red onions. A citrus vinaigrette replaces the olive oil and subtly reinforces the summer theme. While the potatoes were a nice touch, I think the asparagus made little to no contribution. There were only 6 slices of tuna (~2 oz), but was manageable proportional to the size of salad. 4 stars.\\n\\nRed Velvet Milkshake. To paraphrase Pulp Fiction, I just had to know what a $12.50 shake tastes like. Vanilla ice cream, raspberry sauce, sprinkles, a red velvet cupcake, fresh whipped cream, and a cherry, this was one sweet shake, but nothing special. I think it was way overpriced even for Universal. 2,5 stars.\\n\\nMay Contain Nuts. Playing the pun here is an understatement! Peanut butter ice cream, chocolate peanut butter pie, Reese's peanut butter cups, peanut brittle, peanut butter sauce, topped with Reese's pieces and fresh whipped cream. A decadent super-duper sweet dish with a fun name. If you don't have a peanut allergy or diabetes, this may definitely give you both! 4 stars.\\n\\nThe Toothsome Chocolate Emporium is more than a meal, it's an experience. It was definitely one of my more memorable dining experiences, and one the entire family enjoyed. I highly recommend it. 4 stars.\\n\\nIf you would like to experience more, come dine-with-me.yelp.com, I'd love to have your company...

I finished up most of my work and hooked up with the crew at Cafe Rustica at the very end of office hours knowing that atleast some of us were heading to the Cheesecake Factory. I love cheesecake (and make quite a bit of it) and I have always loved the food at Cheesecake Factory. \\n\\nSo when we get there and there is an estimated 2 hour wait, I decide to go back to work while everyone is waiting to finish up and have them call me when our table was ready because I only work 10 minutes away.\\n\\nI go back to work and work for more than an hour, stop by Devon's to drop off some things that I had for her and the call from Ligaya comes that says that the table is almost ready. So I dart over to the Mall and I get a text from Becki saying that they are seated as I pull into the garage.  \\n\\nCool, I have managed not to have to wait 2 hours for a table, my work was done so I can relax for a bit and hopefully get out of there within an hour or so and pick my son up in Roxbury by 11. How long could it take for them to serve pre-made, Pre-sliced cheesecake. \\n\\nSome people ordered drinks, I think the table ordered one app total (at least that was all that I saw being brought to the table) but most of us just ordered cheesecake. I was told by my sitter that I could only stay out so late if I brought her back some cheesecake, so when I ordered I ordered one slice to go (at the regular price) and one slice for me to enjoy with my Yelp friends.\\n\\nAfter a while, I think at about the same time the app came to the table, a waiter came over with my to go slice of cheesecake. Cool, we will be served soon, right? After about 45 minutes of staring at my to go container of cheese cake, the Yelpers are wanting me to fork it over. But I can't, it's for Ann Marie!  I predict they have run out of cheesecake and they are waiting for the frozen cheesecakes to thaw before they serve us.\\n\\nSo I decide to go over and find out what the hold up is and see if they can make my other slice of cheesecake to go also because I have to leave and pick up my son and it's already after 11. When I walk up, I see several people behind the counter with a few slices of cheesecake and not much happening. I ask what's going on and someone says, \\"we are very busy and the only thing that people are ordering is Cheesecake and we are doing our best to get the Cheesecake out to your table\\" I explained that I had to leave and was told that it would be out shortly. \\n\\nOne of the people behind the counter asked what I was waiting for so they could try to get it out first but the other woman cut her off and said \\"They decided to have this big promotion today and we have 4 people working and all of these tables to serve, your food will be out shortly\\" and I looked for the other woman who was trying to help get mine so that I could leave but she wasn't there anymore.\\n\\nI go back to the table thinking shortly, I can deal with shortly but we wait and wait and still no cheesecake. I am getting very annoyed because I know how long it takes to put a piece of cut cheesecake on a plate and put some whipped cream on it. If you have 4 people doing it, one person gets the cheesecake, one person plates the cheesecake, one person garnishes with whipped cream and one person makes sure the order is right and passes on to the server. There is no cutting involved, it doesn't really matter how many slices you have to serve in a night.  If you run out, go back to the table and say \\"I am sorry, we have run out of the chocolate, can I offer you something else\\" \\n\\nI hit my boiling point because I was too deep into it to just walk out empty handed, I was past the point of no return it is now almost Midnight and I want my $1.50 cheesecake!! Give it to me so I can leave!!! One of the yelpers gets up to go to the ladies room and comes back and says there's no TP, I stood up again and said that there will be TP in there shortly (because, damn it I have to pee too) and i get up to go tell one of the people that are standing around chatting, that they need TP in the ladies room but I was headed off by the woman who told me that our food would be out shortly.  She had two plates with cheesecake in her hand and she was walking in our direction and said \\"it's coming, it's coming\\" so I go sit down (funny, how l no longer need to pee so bad) and she walks right by our table, WTF!\\n\\nA few minutes later our cheesecake actually comes and I wolf down a few bites and throw the rest into one of my take out containers (I had two because they put the strawberries on the side) handed Becki some cash, said a quick Bye and Ran!\\n\\nI got to my son at 12:45, I was in Big Trouble!

My friend and I decided to make the 2.5 hour trip just to try this amazing restaurant after hearing all the hype around it. The food was 100% worth the drive. \\n\\nHot Chicken Takeover is located on the second floor of North Market, so use any of staircases located in the corners of North Market to ascend to this heavenly restaurant. Upon arrival, our excellent host (shot out to Bret), explained the menu, Hot Chicken Takeover's history and their Fair Employment opportunities to give back to the community, and went above and beyond to make us feel more than welcomed. He was ecstatic to hear that we made the trip out from Pittsburgh just to try Hot Chicken Takeover, he even offered to get us a free Banana Pudding (which you get for free anyways by checking in on Yelp). We were a little on the fence about which spice level to choose so the cashier gave us whole drumsticks just to sample the different spice levels - now that's above and beyond service. \\n\\nThe Holy spice level was quite spicy and it'll leave your lips and tongue tingling for several minutes after your first bite, but the flavor is incredible. If you're a spice lover, try the Holy and use the sweet vinegar-based, crunchy Coleslaw to cool things down as needed. I opted for the Hot Chicken breast which comes with a side of coleslaw, mac n cheese, and pickles. The chicken was so good I have dreams about it. The paper thin, crispy breading on the chicken comes bathed in the deliciously spicy Hot sauce - it's kind of amazing how the breading manages to stay crispy and sauces all at the same time - gotta appreciate the smaller things in life. Their free house-made Ranch and Sweet Tea (they also offer free unsweetened tea) are the perfect pairings to this delicious meal. \\n\\nThe establishment also sells apparel which comes with added benefits - if you purchase a shirt ($30), your meal is free, and every time you wear the HCT shirt during your visits, you'll receive $1 off your meal. Also, if you want to sample the different spice levels, you can get your wings or drumsticks at different spice levels - a great way to ride the heat levels and to test your wits.\\n\\nI would gladly drive more than 5 hours if it means there's a delicious tray of Hot Chicken Takeover waiting for me at the end of the journey.

The staff-person overlooking the back of the room (Matt) was not only rude, but was condescending to us and just completely dishonest about their policies (eg. we were told that there are signs stating that we are not allowed to take photos in the back with digital cameras which was untrue) and imposed a mandatory 18% service charge on our drinks bill.  He defended himself by saying that there are 40 willing paying customers waiting for our table (which also turned out to be untrue) then accused me of yelling and refused to allow me to respectfully speak to the manager about our treatment.

I couldn't really find any justification since only about a quarter of the tables were full and it could hardly make a difference.

What are you supposed to do when you are craving dim sum and get desperate though? Unlike those restaurants, Ming's has a large space with bright lights that looks pristine. If you go for Saturday morning dim sum though, expect a little wait. It gets packed. \\n\\nThe food is amazing. Everything tastes fresh and you know that things haven't been carted around for hours, since there were few items that were sold out before it got to us and we had to wait for the next round. They also have some items that are not as common in some of the places in Chinatown. The service was also great. They were very accommodating for the large group with one toddler. \\n\\nFinally, you get all this and dim sum (get it?) for a great price!

The bathrooms are located right by the door, so I assume it was from there... but I didn't dare go in.\\n\\nI should have taken a cue from that first impression and turned around, but the munchies were driving me to the bar area.  The clientele was really sketchy, place was run down and I had already asked a friend to meet here... so fuck it I ordered.  The portion was quite large, the beef teriyaki was pretty good and so were the chicken wings and chicken fingers were as expected from a run of the mill american Chinese food joint.  The fried rice was not my favorite but they gave a ton.\\n\\nI could not take the smell of urine anymore and kept getting unpleasant wafts of it as I ate, so I didn't even want to stick around for a drink as it was my main reason for wanting to go there.  Maybe somebody's depends were leaking since the bar is far away from the bathroom as I could not get away from the piss stench.

I'm on crutches and she is a high-risk pregnancy, so this definitely wasn't our wisest move and the line is extensive, but one of the employees pulled us out of the line after waiting about 20-25 minutes and brought us to a table on one of the upper decks. We did not ask for that and were (mostly) prepared for the 2.5 hour wait we were told it would be, but she went out of her way to seat us sooner which was greatly appreciated! \\n\\nThe view here is stunning, so it's a place I'd recommend for anyone visiting Austin, even if you only come for chips, salsa, and a drink to knock you off your feet (hello, Uber my old friend! But really, they limit every guest to TWO hurricanes here! Oh, and they come in a commemorative glass you can take home) \\n\\nThat being said, The Oasis has the BEST SALSA I have found in Texas and I've lived here my whole life. It is the perfect amount of chunky veggies with the right amount of heat and tastes insanely fresh! I could drink this stuff (it's really that good..) \\n\\nI ordered the Vegetarian Stuffed Poblano and it was fairly tasty. I do wish it came with more beans/rice because it's a little spicy, but the pepper itself is a huge size and the flavors are very good. It would be lovely if they added a meat option because that would make it even better, but I would still order this again. \\n\\nFor drinks, I ordered a Mango Perfect Margarita and one of the Hurricanes since my friend was driving. The margarita was tasty but didn't have much of a kick, but there is a reason they'll only let you have two hurricanes! That puppy was STRONG with a very overwhelming flavor of pineapple. \\n\\nIf you are planning to come here, I highly recommend making a reservation well in advance to avoid the insane lines, but also be aware that the employees are often assisting an overwhelming number of tables so don't expect them to always be present. They are friendly, but a person can only do so much when they have 20 other tables they're taking care of as well. That being said, they are pretty good at anticipating your needs (extra water, chips, salsa, etc) \\n\\nThe Oasis is a really cool spot and I would definitely encourage you to check it out! The food is overpriced, but you are definitely paying for the location as well so it's worth it in my opinion. Beautiful, beautiful views and a great dinner spot to watch the sunset. Oh, and they often have live music on the upper floor to listen to while you wait 2.5 hours for your table in the event you forgot to make a reservation. \\n\\nOkay, so they say they don't take reservations.....but I've definitely had an entire room reserved before so maybe things have changed?

We took that 10 minute walk and were transported to a time of charm and class, and opulence.  I immediately felt underdressed in this replica of an age gone by.\\n\\nWe were there for breakfast, and the group of us found the Grand Floridian Caf√©.  Great find.  The host got us situated at a table, crayons and paper for the smallest of us, and menus.  What caught my eye was something called a Benedict Flight.  Samples of three different benedicts, all for just under $20.  How would they do this?\\n\\nI was impressed with the appearance of my entr√©e when it arrived.  I started with the benedict in the center, large pieces of lobster too tempting to delay.  It wasn't until I bumped into the benedict on one side that I realized the hollandaise sauce was different, the one with the lobster subdued as to not affect the flavor of the lobster, the traditional had the citrus flavor I love.  The third was a bit spicy to go with  Chorizo sausage.  Each unique, each delicious.  For these benedicts, each included a small poached egg.\\n\\nService was good, we bumped through a little communication problem but nothing serious.  The place was not busy while we were there.

Went to Banana Leaf on W Broadway (close to VGH) to try out their Malaysian food. Their dine out menu is different from other restaurants in that it's 7 courses to share family-style at $20 per person.\\n\\nSince there were 7 of us in the group, we decided that we would only order 2 dine out sets and the rest from the regular menu to share. I'll start my review with the dine out set. Note that each dish is meant to be shared between 2 people (except for the salads, which are individually served).\\n\\nThe appetizers for dine out consisted of Asian Salad with Papaya & Pineapple, Nyonya Calamari, and Lettuce Wraps.The salad was quite refreshing and definitely had a Southeast Asian flair. It was dressed with a sort of sweet chilli fish sauce, making it sweet, spicy, and salty/sour at the same time. The calamari wasn't bad. It could've been crispier but it tasted pretty good with the sweet and sour chilli sauce that it came with. For the wraps, they give you fresh lettuce with some saut√©ed shredded meat, mushrooms, and veggies for the filling and you wrap it yourself. There's also hoisin sauce to give it some flavour.\\n   \\nThe 3 entrees were Gulai Fish Fillet, Sambal Green Beans, and 10 Veggie & Spices with Boneless Chicken. I was surprised how the Gulai Fish was actually quite spicy. It was good though! It was in a curry-like sauce and it had lots of delicious lemongrass flavour. It was good though! I thought the Sambal Green Beans were just okay. They were in a dry shrimp paste. The beans were cooked nicely -- still had a nice crunch but I just thought it was a bit bland. Definitely could've used some more of that shrimp paste. Thirdly, nothing special about the chicken. It was in a red curry type of sauce.\\n\\nDessert for the dine out menu was the Pandan Coconut Panna Cotta with Gula Melaka. This is meant to be for 2 people but it's really quite small. Tasted quite good though. The panna cotta was like a jelly with both pandan (green) and coconut flavours (white) and the gula melaka is like a sweet syrup with hints of coconut.\\n\\nFor $20 per person, I would say the dine out menu is well worth it. You get to sample various Malaysian dishes which is great if you just want to try it out or if you're not too familiar with the cuisine. I highly recommend it for dine out! As for our √† la carte orders from the regular menu, read on to find out what we got!\\n\\nI love Roti Canai. It's a type of flatbread that's soft and a bit buttery served with curry sauce. The roti had nice texture. It was still a bit flaky and had a hint of sweetness.\\n\\nAnother appetizer we ordered was the Eggplant Fries. It was our first time having these and it was a delight among the table! They were served very hot, they had a thin yet crispy batter, and the eggplant was soft and silky inside. Also, they were seasoned well with salt and drizzled with Thai chilli sauce.\\n\\nThe Caramelized Ginger Black Cod was by far my favourite dish. It came out very hot which is great and the fish was cooked perfectly. Soft inside and the skin was crispy without any scales (yay!). It had a nice, sweet, caramelized flavour.\\n\\nThe Gulai Seafood had green beans, scallops, prawns, fish, mussels, clams, and squid in the same spicy Gulai sauce from the fish fillet in the dine out menu. We didn't know it was the same thing just with more seafood but it's okay we liked it anyways!\\n\\nI don't really like lamb but the Braised Lamb Shank Halal was not bad. The meat was fall-off-the-bone tender.\\n\\nThe Fried Hokkien Mee wasn't the best. It came out as soon as we ordered it so the noodles must've been pre-cooked already. They were a bit limp too.\\n\\nOverall, a solid experience here at Banana Leaf on Broadway. The service was good -- waiters were quick to clear our dishes and refill our waters. However, they do charge a 15% gratuity on parties of 6 or more so just be aware of that. Quite satisfied with the food, especially the caramelized black cod. Meals can be quite pricy though. Our bill came to around $160 after tax and tip.

I happened to prefer the hot, but if you can barely handle hot wings, go with the medium sauce."},{"name":"Sala and Betty","address":"5201 Airport Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"We're super obsessed with this place!!

I started my Orlando trip with a visit here and it was definitely a perfect start to any Disney trip. Why? because right in the center, they have their information center where you can get your Disney tickets and all sorts of information. Parking is free which was a bonus. We got out tickets from her and also got the much needed help to figure out the best way to plan our week. There are tons of stores and restaurants, and a movie theater and all sorts of other activities that by itself, you could end up spending your entire day here. Not only that, they have free boat rides from one end to the other. We took their ginormous tethered helium balloon up 400 feet to get a view of Orlando. It was truly a beautiful view, especially on a clear, beautiful day. By the way, we got a substantial discount using our AAA card (but not with our Disney single park tickets). It is definitely worth visiting as the walk was pretty relaxing. There was live music at every outdoor alcove which added to the ambiance. \\n\\nThe only problem I had (and had nothing to do with Disney Springs) was with all the road construction that was taking place right Disney Springs. As an out-of-towner and driving, and with the GPS not recalculating as fast as I want it to, I did have a hard time navigating out of this place."},{"name":"Paul Revere","address":"447 High St","city":"West Medford","stars":"3.5","text":"We have been coming to this place forever!

I have dined there 4 other times over the last 8 years, and I noticed a big difference in both the service and food this visit. If it was not billed as a premium restaurant, it would have been fine. But, by comparison to the California Grill and Artist Point, it pales. First, our waitress seemed unqualified to serve food at a premium restaurant. She was a nice enough young woman from Ontario, but she seemed more suited to working as a hostess. She knew almost nothing about the wine selection. At dessert time my children requested the non dairy ice cream. It literally took her 30 minutes to get their dessert, and, what seems worse was her lack of concern over the time it took (its ice cream, go scoop it yourself if necessary). The appetizer menu was unappetizing; so, we ordered scallops from the sides menu. We paid $16 for 2. The food was a complete let down this visit. We ordered porterhouse for two, medium rare which came with two sides. The steak was medium, and it was a little tough. The sides were very, very small. The Creme Br√ªl√©e was just okay. I've always enjoyed Le Cellier, but this time it fell short of expectations.

So I'll try to keep it objective.\\n\\nWhat Kilala is not:\\n- A place to get \\"American\\" junk food fast food sushi like california rolls, spicy tuna rolls, dynamite rolls, etc. They have them on the menu I think only because people demand them, but ordering them here is sort of like ordering pizza at a Chinese restaurant.\\n- A place to get all kinds of crazy fusion sushi with mangos and artichokes and stuff in it. See point above, except this is where they draw the line and don't even go there.\\n- A place to pay top dollar for expensive, unusual, rapidly-changing sashimi specials. Kilala is not Tojo's.\\n\\nWhat Kilala Sushi *is*:\\n- A small, casual sushi restaurant run by a Japanese family (or two, perhaps?).\\n- A destination for simple, authentic, TRADITIONAL Japanese sushi items done right, with the right attention to detail on good quality fish, properly prepared rice, and dishes you'd expect to find on an actual visit to Japan.\\n\\nWe were in the mood for a light dinner and ordered the saba battera (pressed) sushi, umeshiso (plum and shiso leaf) roll, unatama (eel and egg) roll, and negitoro (green onion and fatty tuna) roll, along with a side of goma-ae. All Japanese standards (especially for the Osaka region, where I suspect the owners have some ties). \\"Sushi\\" specifically means vinegared rice, and you can tell that's where the attention is at Kilala - the rice is the perfect texture, and perfectly vinegared, creating harmony for the fish and vegetables and not just a vehicle to deliver them.\\n\\nTo illustrate the point, my challenge to you is this: Visit Kilala, order an assortment of traditional Japanese sushi (sashimi, nigiri, battera, and/or the non-American maki), and skip the soy and wasabi, at least for once piece of each. Just do it. You'll find the maki in particular are still moist, flavourful, and pleasant to eat, and you can really taste the ingredients. After that, add all the shoyu you want, but I suspect you won't want to.\\n\\nNow try the same thing at your \\"favourite\\" neighbourhood sushi spot, and I suspect if you can even swallow the dry starchy ball of rice you just stuffed in your mouth, it won't taste very good either.\\n\\nI consider them 4 stars out of 5 because the dining atmosphere leaves a little to be desired (bars on windows, harsh fluorescent lights, cheap-looking tables and chairs, small seating capacity), which limits the friends and family I'd invite there except for a very casual occasion, but for a laid back dinner of truly authentic Japanese sushi for a couple of close friends, you're going to be hard-pressed (haha, battera joke, never mind) to find anything equivalent in Vancouver, especially  at this price range."},{"name":"Cafe Intermezzo","address":"6000 N Terminal Pkwy, Councourse B","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"So, we just ran away from this Resturant as I attempted to have a good breakfast during my layover a uninvited guest decided to show up.

Take your tourist friend here and they will love it. There a fridge for ready to grab items, a cheese counter where you order cheese and menu items, and then small glass domes with pastries. I ordered their spammich, patty boi, and charcuterie cone.\\n\\nTaste: EXCELLENT. everything was tasty. The spammich had the necessary sweetness from the jam and the patty boi was amazing on the pallet with the pickles and mustard seeds. The cheese in the charcuterie cup was delicious. My only critiques with taste was the spammich was a tad to dry, you may find yourself chugging water. \\n\\nOverall, great parking spaces, great food, comfy chairs, what's not to love?

Not over cooked (so many places do!). Perfect light pink color. Great salmon taste. I love asparagus. So, yes, this side was a great, healthy add. \\n\\nLike I said, the food was decent, so negatives. It's just this visit was not memorable.

(I'm minus-ing a star due to the sit down service, because we would've waited a decade had we not taken our hunger and salivation into our own hands)  I did grow up in Massachusetts.  Western, MA.  I had spent time here and there in Boston, but never really the north end, and definitely never to do the touristy thing.  This time was different.  I was a complete tourist minus the camera on my neck and the black socks hiked up past my Teva sandals.  Being a pastry chef, I'm picky when it comes to desserts.  I know what I'm getting myself into when I go to a good old Italian pastry shop.  Usually someplace like the place across the street comes to mind (giant pastries, not too tasty, filled with whipped cream so sweet that a corpse could come back to life).  Bigger is not better!  Quality is better.  Modern has it!  You don't have to be large to be in charge, you just have to be good, and fresh, and authentic.  \\n\\nThe Paragina - A layer on the bottom, spongey soaked cake and the top of flaky puff pastry, possibly buttered and sugared sheets resembling phyllo, with a coating of powdered sugar on the top.  Inside is a delightful, and not too sweet diplomat cream and some sort of rum liquor.  This was simple. Simply perfect.  I'd like to kiss the grandma that made this.  Gratzi!!!\\n\\nThe Torrone \\"Divino Amore\\" - Its like a chunky candy bar made of nougat and honey, pistachios and topped with marzipan and chocolate.  Oh my word.  A little on the sweet side for me, but as far as nougat goes, this was cooked to the right temperature when being made into candy.  Chewy, but not stuck in your teeth chewy.  Perfect.  There is a grandma (or grandpa) in there really doing what should be done everywhere.  Bellissimo!!!\\n\\nThe Cream Puff - I couldn't get a word out of the PIC as he was stuffing (literally, like it was the only thing he'd eaten in weeks) his entire face with this cream puff. His face was covered in powdered sugar, from bottom lip to nose (kind of Tony Montana style).  It's filled with a ricotta filling (which I ate more of than he did), whipped cream, chocolate mousse rosette and chocolate syrup.

Most of the dining institutions are well decorated to their themes.\\n\\nTraffic and the construction can put a little headache into the overall enjoyment of downtown Disney though. Traffic can be avoided though by proper planning and timing. The construction will be temporary as downtown Disney (DTD) will roll out Disney Springs in place of Pleasure Island.\\n\\n--- Summary ---\\n\\nCompared to the DTD on the west coast (Disneyland), this one is larger and offers a larger variety of activities and vendors. One of the noticeable ones is the Cirque Du Soleil show, which I thought was interesting, and some of the more art focused vendors; however, DTD on the west coast is more integrated with the parks being walking distance from both Disneyland and California Adventure. This DTD in Orlando is separated by a couple miles from any of the parks.\\n\\nIf you are just browsing the stores, you can easily spend a few hours here just looking through each store. This spot is a good location to bring a date as there are a multitude of dining options and various stores to browse. You can even watch the Cirque Du Soleil show.\\n\\nAs stated before, a lot of the dining options are well decorated to their themes. You will notice that when you see them. Rainforest Cafe has a volcano that spits out fire at night. There is a restaurant on a boat. There is a one with dinosaur skeletons and dinosaur machines. The dining can be a little more on the pricey side as expected for Disney. The only somewhat reasonable dining option in terms of pricing is Earl's and some of the other counter service options, but Earl's can get packed with long lines. I have tried Raglan Irish Pub. It was well decorated with decent (but pricey) food and live music at night.\\n\\nFor your Disney shopping needs, the World of Disney is a great store. It basically has almost all the Disney goods you can find inside the theme parks. There is also a Lego store with cool decorations in front (the Maleficent Dragon breathing fire onto a knight on cliff with fire engulfing the cliff) along with other stores. Some of the stores are targeted more toward children, so a great place to bring family/friends.\\n\\nMy favorite vendors were the Art of Disney where you can see cool Disney artwork and World of Disney for all your Disney retail shopping needs. As for food, I enjoy Ghirardelli Soda Fountain & Chocolate Shop, Earl's, and Raglan Irish Pub. \\n\\nAlso, World of Disney does not have Tsum Tsums, but Once Upon a Toy does if you are looking for the undeniably cute plushies.\\n\\nI got personalized phone cases for myself and my girlfriend at D-Tech On Demand store in the Marketplace Co-Op area. They are on the expensive side (~$40 each), but I felt like it was a good couple gift as we have the same phone.\\n\\nParking is complimentary and that adds another incentive to check this place out. Just be wary of traffic heading into DTD and the crowds during holiday seasons.\\n\\nI look forward to coming back when Disney Springs is open and all the construction is out of the way."},{"name":"Disney Springs","address":"1486 Buena Vista Dr","city":"Lake Buena Vista","stars":"4","text":"Loved all the shops and the Lego sculptures!

When that arrived in good time from the kitchen, there was lots of chicken chunks of good quality and lots of fresh pineapple chunks and cashews and rice.

That might be the only similarity, though, as the two restaurants' menus differ substantially (Ray's serves steaks and seafood vs. Canoe's creative seasonal fare) and Ray's feels more like a chain opposite Canoe's local flavor.  Not that there's anything wrong with chains, but the dining experience doesn't feel as authentic or genuine sometimes.\\n\\nRay's is an elegant restaurant, which gives me the type of vibe I'd typically get dining at a fine restaurant inside a hotel or cruise ship.  I can't really put my finger on it.  Maybe it's the live jazz music.  The space inside has a great view of the river.  Outside, you can stroll down trails alongside the river and take in the scenery.  There are benches to sit down and relax at.  The landscaping and design here isn't as lush or visually appealing as Canoe, but it's still charming.\\n\\nPretty standard stuff on the menu (aforementioned steaks and seafood).  You won't find anything wildly innovative.  Expect to spend anywhere from $5 to $15 per appetizer (or side) and $20 to $50 per entree.  It's pricey for what you get.  For example, an order of a half dozen oysters is $15.  On Tuesday nights, I can go to Fontaine's in Virginia-Highland and order a dozen for less than half that.  I'm guessing the oysters are sourced from different suppliers/areas (Fontaine's oysters come from the Gulf of Mexico), but I didn't notice a difference in the taste or quality of Ray's oysters.  Speaking of which, here are the dishes I tried:\\n\\nAppetizers/Salads:\\nFresh Cold Water Oysters - cocktail sauce, mignonette\\nCrispy Seasoned Calamari - sweet peppers, marinara, lemon aioli\\nThe Wedge - bacon, tomatoes, spring onion, blue cheese dressing\\n\\nEntrees:\\nHorseradish Crusted Grouper - goat cheese, chive-whipped potatoes, green beans\\nFilet Mignon (10 oz.) - mashed potatoes\\n\\nThe oysters were fantastic.  Ice cold, mostly plump, and succulent.  The calamari was OK.  Fried calamari is pretty much the same no matter where you go.  There are slight variations from restaurant to restaurant, but it's not really a dish that differs significantly.  Ray's version is lightly breaded, not as greasy, and a bit softer than other places.  The Wedge salad was a good, basic salad.  Crisp lettuce and bacon and generous portion size.  I enjoyed it.\\n\\nThe entrees were fine.  The best part about the Grouper was the whipped potatoes.  They were silky smooth and had addictive flavoring.  I wouldn't mind ordering an a la carte side of that.  The Grouper itself was fresh and mild in flavor, both the outer layer and the meat.  The Filet Mignon was cooked to order (medium rare).  The cut was tender and subtle in flavor.\\n\\nNo real issues with the food (or service) -- I just think the menu doesn't really provide a whole lot of value, at least a dinnertime, and I'm not clamoring to come back.  They do have a \\"$10 Lunch\\" which they advertise on their sign outside.  I'm curious how good it is, so I may wind up trying it out sometime.\\n\\nService was attentive and our food came out from the kitchen in a reasonable amount of time.

And that's why I gave it 3 stars. But sadly, the customer service is dreadful enough that I won't order from there again. When I first moved to Melrose from Boston, I was thrilled to have a decent chinese restaurant within walking distance of my new house. Throughout the summer, I ordered from there at least every other week. Always the same dish... a sesame tofu combo dish. The woman who took the orders was always super pleasant and the food was good. Sometime in the fall (I think), I called to order and the gentleman that answered told me that I couldn't get the same order that I had gotten all summer long. When I explained that I had ordered it repeatedly, he told me I was wrong. Begrudgingly, I accepted it and eventually just started ordering it as a single order (not a combo). Now it's March. I called tonight and was told that I can't get it at all, ever again. Now, I realize that they have the right to change their menu. But the staff is just kind of curt. It's just been a crappy vibe ever since the change. (I think there are new owners.) Needless to say, I decided to order from another restaurant just down the road tonight.

Although I live less than 5 miles away they don't deliver to my home address, so last night I placed an online order for carry out. I should have looked at my pizza before leaving the store. By the time I got home in less than 15 minutes, my first reaction when I opened the pizza box was that this pizza had been pre-made and left sitting out for a long time. DOA. I had ordered the pizza of the month, which is currently Steak Pomodoro, a \\"crispy thin crust with seasoned steak, mozzarella, and homemade Pomodoro sauce\\". MY PIZZA HAD NO POMODORO SAUCE. I thought they just put a very light amount on it so I pulled off the toppings and still no sauce. There was a handful of diced tomatoes on top of the pizza. Was this the elusive \\"homemade Pomodoro sauce\\" I was searching for? I would have posted a photo with my revue but after eating one cold, dead slice the rest went straight into the trash. I also ordered 3 peproni rolls and they were stingy with the fillings. A whole lot of roll and not much pepperoni, cheese, or sauce inside. Incredibly disappointed to say the least.

The drink was sickly sweet with random cucumber flavor. We tried to get a Mule instead but they were out of ginger beer (so was Jernigans earlier so someone messed up those truck orders! Haha). We ended up with a Tavern Lemonade which was good enough. Their cocktails were not as good as at the Mixer event which was disappointing.\\n\\nI ended up hungry but didn't want bar food. I also don't eat beef or pork. I ended up with the Wild Mushroom Pierogis which were delicious! I was bummed that it was about the only thing on the menu without meat but I guess I can't complain they had nothing healthy, it is a tavern! \\n\\nOverall it was ok.

It wasn't a long wait for the food even when we ordered three dishes. \\nSalmon hash: 5/5, so delicious! & there was actually a good amount of salmon in it. I think it was our favorite dish from what we ordered.  \\nCrab cake entree: 4.5/5, also SO good. I just think I had higher expectations since it's their most popular dish, per yelp. But again, so good. I would definitely get it again. But I think I would get full fast even if it's the only thing I ate.

It was nice that they also included hot miso soup with slices of mushroom, being that it was a rather cold day.  \\n\\nThe wrap was surprisingly good.  The avocados were a nice touch, and they were pretty generous with the ingredients.

They've also got free wi-fi here- just go up and ask for the wi-fi code.  Service here is pretty friendly. \\n\\nAnd as far as the unique decor...deal with it.

The bread, in particular, is just an exercise in perfection. The texture is great: soft on the inside, crispy on the outside. The first time I went, I had the \\"Lee's Sunny Side Up Egg Sandwich,\\" which is banh mi with ham, head cheese, baloney, and a sunny-side egg on the aforementioned fantastic bread. My friend had the Combo Congee, with what she and her husband refer to as soup with \\"squiggly bits,\\" a beef broth soup with Rare Steak, Well Done Flank, Brisket, Tendon, and Tripe (Pho Dac Biet). It looked really good. One day I will have to try it. \\n\\nOn that first visit, there were some delays in getting food to the table. I mean, this place gets slammed during the weekly lunch hour (and for good reason, the food rocks!). So it pays to have a little patience. But on that day, on a weekend afternoon, it wasn't so busy, and we were wondering why she was the last one to get her food. (And by a big margin.)\\n\\nThe second time I visited, I had the Pho Ga (chicken noodle soup). This may be among my new favorite things--it totally hit the spot. This soup was a very simple work of art. The broth was nicely fragrant and perfect. The vermicelli and chicken pieces were delicious. Served with the ubiquitous plate of sprouts & basil & herbs, the only thing missing was a few slices of hot peppers. I wanted to pick up the entire bowl and drain the thing. And towards the end, I did. My friend had some spring rolls, which are clearly a hit, and some Shrimp Noodle Soup (Pho Tom). \\n\\nPrices are quite reasonable. Pay at the register on the way out.

In case you are unfamiliar with Pho, here is a quick rundown of exactly what it is:\\n\\nDELICIOUS.\\n\\nMy most recent Pho conquest took place at Lee's Bakery in Atlanta, GA on Buford Highway. This place is a great. The Pho is wonderful and made with a trio of rare beef and all of the fixings (it also come with shrimp and squid, chicken, or with only the vegetables). The beef broth was definitely one of the best that I have ever tasted. I could not really place my finger on it, but it tasted much more authentic than the other plates of Pho that I have devoured.\\n\\nI was also impressed with the fresh spring rolls. I have never had an order that actually tasted so fresh. Usually the pork is grey, and the sprouts/lettuce are browning. This roll actually tastes like they pick all of the ingredients, and immediately stuff them into this rice paper. The Peanut dipping sauce is also flavorful. Loved it.\\n\\nI also ordered:\\n      Fried pork egg-rolls: They were cold. It was very disappointing. The flavor was all there, but... they were SO cold and chewy.\\n\\n     1/2 of the Bahn Mi (BBQ Pork Sandwich): Apparently this is the signature sandwich as Lee's Bakery. It was tasty, but it did not taste very fresh. It definitely had that 'lunchtime special so we make as many as we can' taste to it.\\n\\n    A Smoothie (Strawberry): So f*cking good. I don't know if it was the Atlanta heat or what, but this was hands down the best strawberry anything that I have ever had. Also,there are a ton of other flavors as well like mango and passion-fruit, and I plan on trying them all.\\n\\nI recommend this place to get your pho fix.

The line moves quickly, so don't be discouraged. \\n\\nWe got six cannolis for 6 people... could only eat 4 and saved 2 for breakfast. They are big, crispy, and filled with delicious ricotta cream. We chose plain, pistachio, and chocolate chip. Strangely enough, my favorite was the plain. You can taste the sweetness of the cream with each delightful bite. \\n\\nThe menu is a bit overwhelming, so get it together while you are in line. Nothing worse than waiting for 20minutes, and the person in front of you doesn't know what they want. It happens. \\n\\nI felt like an elite person, walking around with my Mike's Pastry white and blue box, tied with string. I imagine that's how some people feel about walking around town with their Gucci bag... not me... I take pride in my blue and white box that everyone knows is filled with deliciousness. \\n\\nOh so very good. Don't miss out on this experience.

A very crisp, spacious feel, with peppy service and a lot of natural light.\\n- Great for catching up with a few friends, or grabbing a drink with coworkers.\\n\\nLUNCH\\n- Tuna Poke Bowl ($18) with quinoa, pickled vegetables, and shiso. It was great, and you could really identify the different Asian influences in the different pickled vegetables! The shiso taste was a lot stronger than I anticipated, which was tough on me but not reflective of any wrongdoing on the restaurant's part!\\n- Avocado Toast ($10) with Mexican pickled carrots, za'atar, crema, feta. I mean, I'm biased in my love for avocado toast, but man, the za'atar really MADE this avocado toast. Highly recommended.\\n- Hot Fudge Matcha Sundae ($9) with Matcha ice cream, hot fudge, pocky sticks. Wow 10/10. Again, biased in my love for matcha, but I just can't resist whenever I have matcha that really tastes densely like thick, delicious real matcha. The creative crunch from the pocky was a fantastic idea, I'll be taking that back home!\\n\\nThe only thing I'd really recommend is taking care of noting for possible allergies or particular seasonings on the menu.

I really do hate to give one star but the service that my girlfriend and I received at Zaftigs today was atrocious and appall-able. It was actually so bad that it ruined our appetite. And I really hate to write such a poor review because the food isn't half bad but when service is so poor that you feel neglected, I feel it's justified to have my voice heard. This is another establishment that rest on their laurels which their food can life up to but not their service. It takes a short time to get seated but once seated get ready to feel abandoned. You will sit down at a table that will feel as if it wasn't thoroughly cleaned and wait minutes, I'd say ten or so to get your waters filled. After this wait the waiter will ask you for drinks. She'll take an eternity to deliver them and then when she does will ask what we'd like to eat. My girlfriend and I ordered a couple appetizers and some entrees. The potato pancakes came after 10 mins or so which are standard, the mixed pickle dish was forgotten. And after a dish is forgotten you'd expect your waiter to know and be your advocate with the back of house. In this case our waitress didn't know. So we finally get our entrees and the pickle dish still hasn't arrived. When a busser comes to clean up the empty potato pancake dish I asked him about the pickle dish. The waitress then comes over and says she was sorry she forgot it. Okay no problem. I have them another chance and went to Zaftigs again today with the wife.\\n\\nThe service was so bad today, I felt like it was a ghost who took our order.\\n\\nAgain it took us forever to get waters. The table wasn't cleaned well enough. AND OUR COMBO APPETIZER NEVER CAME TO OUR TABLE. I could not believe it. My girlfriend and I were STARVING. I had to stop the waitress and ask her after us waiting 30 minutes and I'm not kidding you, 30 minutes, for our combo appetizer and say miss is the appetizer on its way. She said she'd talk to the kitchen.\\n\\nShe then comes out with our French toast order.\\n\\nWe wanted the appetizer first.\\n\\nAfter she brings the French toast order. \\n\\nShe runs back to the kitchen and gets the other entree dishes.\\n\\nI couldn't believe it, where's the appetizer!!!?!?\\n\\nThere was no apology, no concern as to where the appetizer was. I couldn't believe the lack of concern and hospitality for an establishment in Brookline. I think this place has management problems. I don't see managers roaming the floor and I think the hostess are treated as quasi managers. My point is, this effects the service standards. There seems to be pore communication amongst the staff. \\n\\nNextly after the entrees came I kindly asked our waitress about or appetizer. I couldn't believe I had to ask her again. She said she would check the kitchen. I told her i don't know if I want it now. She said well if it's in the window I have to bring it, with still no apology that we didn't get it!!!!! I was pist but kept my cool because I felt bad.\\n\\nShe comes back and says your lucky, they didn't cook it yet.\\n\\nI couldn't believe it. That she would admit they didn't cook it yet. This was 45 min ordeal with no appetizer. And the waitress didn't apologize. I thought she would at least offer to comp something such as another appetizer for the inconvenience, so I wanted to see and placed an order for potato pancakes.\\n\\nThey came after 10 mins.\\n\\nThey were good but I was so turned off and upset at the poor service that I couldn't even enjoy my meal. So the check comes and we weren't comped for anything, not even the iced teas or appetizers, no apology. Just had to smile and say everything is good, and I tipped waitress 20% and wasn't passive. I then approached the hostess and told her how bad the service was, and she seemed sad, like I am for writing this. I told her how bad the service was today but not sure if she was the correct person to talk to. It was horrible.  I think this review may seem exaggerated but other reviews may be due to the novelty of this place. After you come a few times I'd find it hard to believe they'd have the same experience.

I had high hopes, Upon entering it was much like the other Oriental takeout place we have been to, with a few tables and a similar menu. The gentleman behind the counter was ambivalent and not very helpful. As I placed our order I had a question about what came in the one dish and he flipped over the menu and pointed to a stock picture. I asked if they could make it extra hot and he acted like he did not understand. We paid and waited for our order. They had a good sized staff working the kitchen and he assisted when no one was at the counter or on the phone. The food came out quickly and we took it home. \\n\\nMy kids had the sweet and sour chicken with some pork egg rolls. The sweet and sour was much like any place else we have had it but the egg rolls were fairly bland. I had the szechuan chicken and was not impressed. The peppers and onion were bigger pieces than I prefer but easy to cut down. The portion size was good and it looked good. What it was lacking was flavor which is sad because there was so much of the peppers and onions along with a few tiny pieces of carrot. The other problem was that I expected some kind of heat from it and was totally disappointed. I asked for extra spicy and it tasted like they went completely the other way. I added a packet each of their soy sauce, duck sauce and hot sauce and it did not really help. The plain white rice had more flavor. By the way, they made perfect white rice. The third star is for the rice.\\n\\nHeating up some of the leftovers in the morning I added a good helpling of hot sauce from a bottle plus some other seasoning. This is not what I am used to and I will be content to drive the extra distance for quality food and friendly customer service. \\n\\nIf you like it bland this is the place for you."},{"name":"Treaty Oak Distilling","address":"16604 Fitzhugh Rd","city":"Dripping Springs","stars":"4.5","text":"Great venue with options for everyone.

They text notify you too when your table is nearly ready, and allow you to text \\"2\\" if you need a few more minutes, which I super appreciate.  This was a tiny bit deceiving because it took an additional 10 minutes to get seated and about 40 minutes to get our food.  The restaurant is very very large, so I understand why.  You get seated easily because there's so much space, but you get served slowly.  I didn't mind the wait though because i wasnt in a rush.  Our waitress was so so kind and peppy and sometimes sang-talked. \\n\\nI give this place 3 stars because of the food.  \\nMy tofu scramble lacked flavor-I had to add a lot of hot sauce to it.  My boyfriend's salmon was dry and overcooked.  The cream didn't compliment it at all and kind of tasted like canned salmon drizzled with coffee creamer.  They seemed to be stingy with the protein and veggie, but super generous with the potatoes, as both dishes were mostly that. \\n\\nAs far as the menu options, I found them to be kind of limited.  This is more of a classic brunch diner, which I'm sure a lot of people are looking for.  I personally was hoping for more vegetarian + vegan + healthier options, but that's just my preference!

It reminds me a little bit of Duck Duck Goat in Chicago. Old Thousand has a lot of things going well for it. It's difficult to make Chinese food aimed at Westerners and have it still taste good. They have a lot of potential here and I could easily see them in the 4-5 star status if they just...cooled off on the freaking salt. Chinese food in general has high enough sodium as it is, but they seemed to want to up the ante for how salty something can be. That or worse...they can't tell that it's too salty. As a result, I felt, each dish was slightly ruined because of this. It doesn't mean that each dish was bad, I just felt the saltiness got in the way of how good each dish could really be which prevented us from enjoying them. Unless they tone down the salt and allow the other very capable and vibrant flavors to come through, I have no intention of returning.\\n\\nAs for the specific dishes we had, we went with the Chongqing Chicken, Kung Pao Cauliflower, Dan Dan Noodles, Mapo Dofu, and Brisket Fried Rice. Since salt was most of what was tasted, I'll say that the texture on the Mapo Dofu was excellent and it was probably my favorite dish of the night as a result. Their take on Dan Dan Noodles was interesting, but I'll take the more traditional minced pork version over their cream of mushroom soup version any day. The Brisket Fried Rice worked well combining the smokiness of the brisket with the sweetness of the Chinese sausage. Then again, it was hard to fully appreciate amidst the sodium bomb in each bite. Also, some dishes they told us were spicy, were anything but spicy. And when we asked for more chili oil, not only did they charge us for it without mentioning there would be a cost, but it wasn't even spicy thus defeated the purpose since it only made things saltier.\\n\\nFor drinks, I had their Old Thousand (their riff on an Old Fashioned) and tasted their Nasty Woman cocktail. Both were good so zero complaints in this department. I liked the heavier rocks glass the Old Thousand came in. Being a fan of the vibe, our server, and our drinks, It's somewhat difficult to give 2 stars, but the saltiness left us not wanting to come back.

The food is good, but they might take advantage of you if you are a teenager calling in an order. \\n\\nMy son wanted a sweet and sour chicken with fried rice and added broccoli. He called this in as he's done a few times. After leaving I realized that his meal should not have been so much. I called Happy Dragon to ask how much his meal should be, they tell me $10.91. \\n\\nI asked the person at Happy Dragon why was my son charged almost $18. She immediately raised her voice saying something about \\"he ordered separate broccoli and fried rice\\" and \\"this is what he ordered before\\" and some other stuff I could hardly understand. Apparently, they took advantage of my son, ringing it up as a whole order of fried rice and broccoli, instead of adding broccoli to his sweet and sour chicken. \\n\\nThis is the second time they've added an additional meal to an order. The first time they did it, I called them out for it and they issued a refund. \\n\\nI think it's important to spend your money where it's appreciated and for the restaurant owner not to be disrespectful when you address a mistake on their part."},{"name":"Pizza Bruno","address":"3990 Curry Ford Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"I'd read about this place on Orlando Weekly a whole back, and finally the family agreed to to try it.

The rice wasn't the best, but the black beans were pretty good, especially with a hint of the hot sauce they had on the counter. \\n\\nThe worst part of this meal was the horchata. It was $3 for essentially a kid sized drink. Not to mention, it tasted like chalk, because it's made from powder. Maybe I'm spoiled because I grew up with homemade (or at least better mixed) horchata, but it was disgusting. \\n\\nI'm now back in my office, $15 poorer and still STARVING.

Unfortunately, I was completely let down.  \\n\\nI'll start of by saying that the setting was absolutely GORGEOUS! We sat a few feet away from the windows, and had a perfect view of the river. Ray's is very romantic, even during the day. The lighting is dim, and the noise level is low. \\n\\nAs Far as the service, it was not what one would expect from a fine dining establishment. I don't know about you all, but when I get dressed up for a night out on the town, I want GREAT food, GREAT cocktails and WHITE GLOVE service. Lol. No white glove service at all. The wait staff were far too relaxed. They weren't rude or disrespectful, however neither of them were attentive. One of them spoke as if we were old friends, and the other used profanity when describing an item from the menu to my husband. My husband didn't mind, but it turned me off a little. Another thing that bothered me was that  although we had two waiters helping us, it was 30 minutes before our appetizer came out. Also, I had to prompt them each time that I needed a refill. Last thing, once the restaurant cleared out, one of our servers changed into his regular clothing and proceeded to blow out candles at all the empty tables. All minor, I know, but for me, it's the small things that have the biggest impact.\\n\\nNow for the food: Drumroll PLEASE! It was subpar. We tried the Calamari, and loved it. The sweet peppers were a welcomed twist on a classic, loved it. My entree, Chef's Daily Special (salmon) was a total let down. It was overcooked and slightly fishy.  My husband's steak, was overcooked as well. I had the brownie sundae for dessert and it was rich and super sweet like I love, no complaints in this department. \\n\\nOverall, Ray's on the River is great for a night out with the boo, but keep your expectations light, and no matter how hard the waiter/server tries to convince you, don't go with the Chef's Daily Special!

It reminded me of something I had in Houston.  I couldn't quit eating it.\\n\\nFor entree I had the steak tacos.  They were good and plentiful.  Three large flour tortillas stuffed with steak and grilled onions.  The steak was cooked to medium, so if you don't like that request a change.\\n\\nMy friend had the shrimp tacos.

There was a lot of variety and we especially enjoyed the roasted pork knuckle(?) - super crispy skin and not dried out.  The skewers and fried chicken were also stand outs.  I'm a fan of eating with my hands and getting to do so with friends and family is always a good time.  Everyone left with full bellies and with a smile on their faces.

I don't ask for a lot in a good coffee shop. I just want a good cup of coffee, friendly (enough) people, and a variety of relatively unhealthy but o so tasty breakfast morsels at affordable prices. I don't need it to be organic, or hip, or even cozy; just the basics. Now they have the tasty morsels, but I might have to take out a second mortgage if I planned to make it a daily stop. I get that they bake all their own stuff, but that's simply not enough to justify over-pricing a scone. I mean seriously. They want $4 for half of a grilled cheese sandwich. That might be forgivable if the coffee was good. I know we all have different standards in what good coffee is, so I'm sure others think it's just fine. I've tried a couple times now, and the coffee that they are brewing is like brown acid. I had to dump a ton of cream and sugar into it just to make it palatable, but I still couldn't drink it. It's so so very acidic. If you've been drinking it regularly, and you're having stomach acid issues, you might want to refrain. And even this might be forgivable if the staff were sweet as their pastries. They are not. I have yet to be welcomed by a friendly face. Instead, I've been met with a look that says sarcastically \\"oh great, another customer.\\" I don't know what's going on but no one that works here seems very happy. Overall, it's a HUGE let down for being smack dab in the middle of the cute little town of Kenton with very few other options for a mocha. I would love to see someone else buy this business and put some really good coffee, people, and (affordable) morsels in there.

Every single error we had last time was remedied.\\n\\nFirst, the service. Outstanding as always, still the area that I think needs no addressing whatsoever. Friendly, warm, inviting, prompt, and willing to work things out to leave you satisfied.\\n\\nThe cocktails were significantly improved from last time. Some ice equilibrium issues were still present, this seems to be a major issue across all Colorado bars. But the drinks tasted amazing, the balance was perfect, and some of the new recipes were awesome. Their bar manager being given the freedom to do what he wants and to hold it to his own standards has paid off very well. I'll be back for the Colkegan Single Malt Santa Fe take on a Penicillin that I suggested buddy. ;) - The only improvement I would say  needed now is ice. If you have a tall collins/pint glass style drink, it should be filled with ice when presented. The bottom 30% of the glass still had no ice. This causes over-dilution as the drink is drank, and unequally chilled per sip. My first drink was in an old fashioned glass with one cube, but the drink wasn't chilled properly. However it was a super busy hour that we came in, and he really did put a lot of effort into mixing it well enough. It tasted great, but 20 more seconds of stirring in the mixing glass and it would have been perfect.\\n\\nFood, everything turned around for the food. Not sure what they changed for the Queso, but it was superb. Lots of flavor, the tortillas were thankfully warm this time, but maybe should have been a bit warmer. I think they really need to move to putting them in a towel, like a traditional mexican restaurant, so they stay warm and somewhat moist. Serving them like that could be a big improvement. But my qualms with this was very minor. The Wagyu steak meal I got was incredible. Wouldn't change a thing. I asked for medium rare, it LOOKS rare, but that's just how that steak is cooked to medium rare personally. It was a beautiful steak. My wife's pozole was perfect and was not a traditional Mexican pozole, but like a New Mexican twist on one.\\n\\nOverall, glad to see such a huge turnaround at Santo.

They are also very conscious of gluten free, vegan, whatever, weird diet you are into they can help you decide.  \\nOnto the food, it is fabulous, I always start with the Japanese Sweet Potato Chips with Charred Scallion and Meat Jus Dip,  This is the best dip I have ever tasted, light and tangy, and the sweet potato chip are crisp and light and perfectly done.\\nThen onto the main course.  So much to chose from.  You must get the Garlic-Sake Clams with Udon Noodles, These are the best things on the menu, and I wouldn't steer you wrong.  They are spicy, tangy, fragrant, and totally divine.  My mouth waters every time I think of them.  You get 4 clams which are always fresh, and the rest is about the succulent udon noodles batched in this delicious lemony, spicy sauce.  I also love the House-Made Thai Basil Noodles with Red Curry and Beer-Battered Hawaiian Shrimp.  This dish is absolutely a must have for me also.  It is curry-y and spicy without being overly so and filled with the flavor of the fresh made basil noodles.   Well worth the $10 up charge.  Other dishes that I would recommend are the specials that show up, there is always something good and surprising on the specials menu, including a good beer.  Also the Salt and Pepper Skate Wing with Chinese Black Bean Puttanesca.  If you don't mind fishing around the bones, this dish is yummy!  It has the perfect mouth-watering sauce on top filled with caper, black beans, and other good things, and it makes the whole fish which is fried light and crispy just that much better.  None of the dim sum have really wowed me so I stay away from them,.  The Shishito Peppers with Sesame Powder and Lemon are nice for a fun change, you never know if you'll get a spicy pepper or not, and the powder they put on top is scrumptious, nice and lemony it's kinda fun how it dissolves in your mouth.\\nAs for more main dishes, I have frankly tried them all I believe.  The stand outs are the Garlic-Chile Braised Octopus.  This is a dish served cold, so be prepared, but it is delicious all the same with some chili oil and zucchini strands, it makes the whole dish come together and is perfect, but just not what you might be expecting.  Another dish that stands out is the Thai BBQ Short Rib with Chile Lime Glaze.  This is a huge short rib covered in non-fatty meat and dripping in a rich delectable sauce that is sweet and savory at the same time.  I couldn't get enough of this dish and I didn't even order it the first time.  You can't leave without having the cookie.  It seems simple The Cookie: Deep Dish Chocolate Chip Cookie Served Warm and Topped with Ice Cream and Soy Caramel Sauce.  This describes it all, and it is heavenly, you will think you are full, but there is always room for the cookie, just try it once and you'll be hooked.  The dishes change all the time, so some of my favorites have gone and some new favorites have appeared in the specials section - that then appear on the menu.  You never know what you are going to find which keeps it just interesting enough to make coming here every few weeks not seem redundant. \\nOverall, I love this restaurant, the food is mouthwatering, scrumptious, and always well-prepared.  The beer list is always exciting and the service is impeccable."},{"name":"Pizza Bruno","address":"3990 Curry Ford Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Went to pizza bruno with a lot of reviews and instagram influencers hyping this place up so I decided to give it a try.\\n\\nThe prices were the biggest thing that brings them down. Don't get me wrong the garlic knots and pizza are really good, but not the best I've had. 13 dollars and up for a smallish pizza is a bit too much, in my opinion it should have been around 8-9 dollars, and the garlic knots that were 10 dollars were good but should have been around 6-7 dollars.

The main perk is of course the play area. The food is nothing special and it's a bit pricey. \\n\\nThere are a few improvements they could easily make. \\n\\n1. Kids meals are $4.50 which isn't that horrible by itself. The problem is the $3 surcharge for playing. For my 2 kids to eat and play it now costs $15 not including whatever I get for myself. Maybe they were having an issue with people playing and not buying anything so they instituted a cover charge? If that's the case I feel like if you buy food the $3 fee should be credited towards your meal purchase. \\n\\n2. Unless you get lucky and sit at the counters over looking the play area you can't really watch your kid and eat. They could put mirrors up in the play place so even if you're at a table you can see them. Otherwise you have to stand or go in the play area to watch them. \\n\\n3. The toys are getting gross as toys do with use from kids. Its not too bad but it doesn't appear the play area gets a decent scrub down. If I'm paying to play I want more attention to cleanliness and order. I also feel obligated to stay longer since I paid.  I feel like I need to stay at least an hour to get my monies worth. So if I'm looking for a quick lunch I don't go here. \\n\\n4. Better food options. It's hard to feel happy after ordering a bagel with cream cheese for $2.50 and see them open a bag of 6 pack of grocery store bagels and serve that to you.  Or don't charge as much for the food. \\n\\nOverall the idea of the place is great but for the money I'll go somewhere else."},{"name":"The Toothsome Chocolate Emporium And Savory Feast Kitchen","address":"Universal CityWalk Orlando, 6000 Universal Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"The food was okay and the wait for dessert was way too long.

East Asian decor, dimmed lights, dimensions of the room are such that it is over long bar with a partially open bar. Service is a plus. Our waitress was extremely welcoming of our questions and answered them with expertise. \\n\\nRelatively small menu, but they have seperate ones for lunch and Sunday dim sum. Things are spicy all around; even those not marked as such. Presentation on all dishes is excellent. *Hot tea was good enough, though you might want to check elsewhere on this as I am no connoisseur and tend to drink a fair amount of sugar in it. *Scallion Pancakes was not my personal favorite, as I prefer mine thicker and with a lower oil ratio. *Mapo Dofu was quite good with delectably crispy skin, good flavor profile with sauce and rice. Not how it is done traditionally, but that is the marvelous thing about this place- their Asian Fusion interpretations. *Cauliflower was spicy as advertised, but not merely for the sake of it. Those chilis were ambrosial! *Da  Dan Noodles were cooked well, not mushy. Though it was a good zest, the spiciness overpowered the dish for me. Needed more meat or vegetables; very plain. *Char Siu Buns, star of the evening. Meat delicious, moist and tender. Small complaint, but too many slices were primarily fat.  Buns were lovingly steamed. Wish the extra ones were less than a dollar each. *Sesame Balls were an unexpected runner up for the night. highly recommended, these are definitely not the typical sesame ball. There is something they do that makes the consistency in the red bean paste warmer, creamier, and a more comforting mouthful of dessert! \\n\\nThis is the epitome of Upscale Asian Fusion. The dishes are pretty straightforward in that the menu tells you exactly what you will be getting. Most highlight a single or a few ingredients, so side dish ordering is recommended. Anything else, including buns or rice, is extra. That being said, it can add up. And prices are already a little on the high side. Even for special occasions, the food ranged from good to excellent- but still nothing I would deem phenomenal.

Within easy walking distance of Northstar are a Barnes and Noble, Fado, Chipotle, PF Changs, and Starbucks.\\n\\nThe space is modern - bamboo chairs, poured concrete tables and bars, all in a rotunda type space - there's an upper level that looks over the lower level that goes around the edge of the rotunda, and the space appeals to my modern aesthetics. I've heard it used to be  a Smith and Hawkens.  Kitchen is open, and there were probably 6-8 folks working back there, in traditional chef's whites.\\n\\nI was a little confused when I came in, and didn't realize I was supposed to order at the counter - wasn't sure if the counter was for quick to-go orders, and I should find a table, or if I was supposed to order and go sit.  The overall atmosphere seemed too upscale to be an order at the counter type place, but apparently I was wrong.  I was a bit surprised to see a note on the menu that \\"Gratuity is included\\",  but this all made sense by the end of the meal.\\n\\nAnyway, I proceeded to order a coffee and a Cowboy Breakfast - two local, organic eggs (I decided on poached), sausage, biscuit, and Michigan preserves.  They then asked if I was familiar with their locator system; I wasn't and they demonstrated how it works - you take the numbered placard, swipe it in the reader at the table, and then set the card on display.  A bit of Googling shows that this is the LRS Key Call table locator system.  Drinks are next to where you order, and there were four carafes of coffee, a mix of organic, fair trade, and one that was a Swiss water decaf.  I don't remember the particular coffee I had, but it was good, maybe the best part of the experience.\\n\\nAfter I filled my mug, I went and sat down, swiping my locator.  The locator is what has the Waters' quotation, and there's also a reminder : \\"please remember it is not necessary to tip at the northstar cafe\\".\\n\\nA little bit later, someone comes by and drops off my food, offers me some fresh ground pepper for my eggs (yes please!), and then wanders away.  Definitely a disjointed service experience - upscale atmosphere, the food is dropped off, and no one checks back in to see how things are - which all makes sense with the idea that you don't need to tip, but overall, it seems like the Key Call system would be more suited to a mall food court (especially with multiple vendors) than a upscale-casual restaurant..\\n\\nIn any case, the food was a bit of a surprise (and not a good one) - eggs had been poached in a mold, and seemed like they might have been done ahead of time - they were lukewarm at best.  I get poaching ahead of time, but at least learn to reheat appropriately . . . and really, who poaches eggs in a mold? The sausage was nice and spicy, and the biscuit was fantastic, but the disappointing eggs sort of ruined the meal for me - to me, good, local eggs should be the centerpiece of breakfast.\\n\\nThe bar looked interesting - okay selection of micro/craft brews (e.g. Victory, Bell's, Rogue, etc).\\n\\nOverall vibe that I got was a place trying to capitalize on the local food movement, as opposed to one that was trying to offer a solid product - lots of polish, but not much substance.  The cynic in me might say that it's a perfect fit for suburban mall and the mainstream consumer.\\n\\nOverall, the meal was about $12 - not bad for local, sustainable, and it is rad to see a restaurant with those ideals thriving in Columbus - I just wish my food had been a notch better."},{"name":"Little Donkey","address":"505 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"This place?

I also opted for the wings but mine were Hot, I'm still too  to try Holy. Mom chose Warm drumsticks. She said Warm was the perfect spiciness for her.

I give them props for both taking my reservation last minute and placing us in a window seat near the river.  Even by 8 pm, the view was nice to look at.  People walked about near the river and you can definitely see the appeal.\\n\\nOur server came out and began going over the menu with us promptly, which was great, and through recommendations, we ordered the following:\\n\\nJumbo Lump Crab Cake - $17\\nParmesan Frites - $6\\nPorterhouse for two - $96\\nHot tea \\n\\nA variety of breads and chips came out first with butter to spread.  My favorite was definitely the raisin bread, which doesn't have cinnamon but was no less tasty.\\n\\nStarters and shareables came out first, and while I couldn't try the crab cake (i'm Allergic), it was well sized, and I was told it was almost too sweet, both from the crab itself and the accompanying corn kernels and other veggies.\\n\\nThe Parmesan Frites were good.  Crispy, covered in crumbly parmesan, and well seasoned.  We both munched on these until the steak arrived.\\n\\nThe Porterhouse for two is a 36 oz steak that has been wet aged for what I believe to be 28 days.  It came with either the red wine Demi glaze or au poivre.  We asked for both and had our steak cooked to medium.  If you want your steak cooked medium well to well done will be butterflied.\\n\\nSo the steak itself was fairly tender and had some flavor to it, although not as flavorful as I would've liked.  Some of the steak was more on the rare side.  We did take the offer of having it sent back to be cooked a bit more and that was done quickly with no issue.  So far so good!\\n\\nSadly, our server seemed a little out of his depth due to several mistakes made throughout the evening.  The mistakes were as small as not being very knowledgeable about the menu he was presenting, to taking my cup of tea without asking if I wanted a replacement.  \\n\\nThe mistakes grew to leaving what looked to be a a finger sized indentation on a dessert (which kinda negated the kind gesture of comping our dessert for our troubles).  No silverware was provided with the dessert until we asked also, and upon getting the silverware, it was dirty.  \\n\\nWe did speak to the manager about this and he was very nice and did his best to make things up to us.  We both appreciated his time.\\n\\nThe stars then include the view.  If there was no river, i'd rate it as 2 stars based off of the experience with our server, who really needed more training.  As it stands, the third star comes from the views and the river.\\n\\nParking is valet, although there are self serve parking spots near the entrance.  Getting in and out of the lot is actually not bad at all, at least not on Friday evenings.\\n\\nAll in all, I wish our experience was better.  The food was okay to good, not great, and the customer service was lacking.  Management was apologetic and tried to make things right, so kudos for them taking the time to try making things right.\\n\\nDid we have a terrible time?  \\n\\nNo\\n\\nIn fact, we laughed at several of the mistakes before long. The view was also beautiful.  We're a little closer to Ray's in the City, so we may give that a shot before coming back here, but i'm not opposed to giving Rays on the River another shot to turn things around."},{"name":"Harborside Grill & Patio","address":"101 Harborside Dr","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I guess I hit it on a good night.

The complex opened in 1975 as the Lake Buena Vista Shopping Village, was renamed to Walt Disney World Village in 1977, then renamed to Disney Village Marketplace in 1989, then renamed to Downtown Disney in 1997, and most recently renamed to Disney Springs in September 29, 2015 after 3 years of renovations.  For the holidays, Disney Springs features illuminated show drones, pop carolers, a nightly tree lighting ceremony, a spirited DJ dance party, a photo opportunity with Santa Claus and an all-new Disney Springs Christmas Tree Trail filled with custom-decorated works of art. I enjoyed checking out the various unique boats on display at the boathouse, the Indiana Jones homage at the hangar bar, and the Lego statues at the Lego store. I have dined at Planet Hollywood, Rainforest Cafe, and caught a show at the House of Blues in the past few years. The Disney Springs features many pricey but unique restaurants with interesting themes and just average food so you could say they're tourist traps but it's worth checking out at least once even if you don't eat there. The retail shops that Disney Springs added are mostly high end, shops that don't interest me, or shops that you could go to in any Mall so I didn't write about them.  I don't remember going to the Pleasure Island dance clubs ever so I really can't say that I miss them but it would be nice if they added a couple dance clubs to replace the ones they took away. The coca cola shop has samples but they're $15 and not free like in Atlanta  so that was a little disappointing. On the plus side, Disney Springs updated their parking garage so that a display shows you how many spots are open in each lane and floor so you don't need to go up and down lanes looking for spots. \\n\\nDisney Springs features the following districts:\\n1. The Marketplace houses many shops and restaurants reminiscent of the American Craftsman-style of the 1930's.\\n2.

Town Center depicts the fictional town's central business district, featuring Spanish Revival architecture from the 1920's, has springs, and features many well known retailers.\\n4.

Place is very visually appealing from the outside.  The menu has items that I can't find other places.  Seemed like a great idea for dinner.  This is where the good news ends.  While the menu is very unique, the execution on food and service is very subpar.  The kids meals are very small.  I ordered the BBQ chicken salad.  The salad had many unique items but when it arrived at the table, I realized that it was 98% lettuce.  Some of the ingredients were not even in the salad (pumpkin seeds).  My wife had the fancy ham & cheese sandwich and had very little meat.  The service was also very slow even though we were eating an early dinner (5:00)\\nAt the end of the day, this place is another overpriced, themed restaurant that is near a theme park.

As I read in a comment before the oysters weren't bad at all, you can tell they were frozen before but taste wise not that bad. They had some crab cakes I really liked and my gf said the baked mussels where pretty good (and she's doesn't even like seafood like that). She also had the sushi and said it was pretty good as well. I had one go at the lobster, since you only get 1 at a time, and I didn't really like it given it was over cooked. I mainly sticked to the crab legs which were pretty good.

Lobby is well maintained. This is where the rest gets worse. The wallpaper down the halls to get to your room and the wall paper in the rooms are probably at least 15 years old. They are worn and have holes, etc. The \\"garden view\\" from the room is the car garden AKA parking and a weed grown \\"garden\\" to the left. Carpet in the room is old with holes. However those are just aesthetics. When you get to the functional part, there are lots of issues. The elevator sounds like it may not lift off ground floor or break. The lightbulb over the bed was out. There was a clock in our room but the electrical cord was just thrown on the table and not connected to any power. The clock wasn't even facing the right way so someone just threw a clock on the table beside the bed without purpose. I wasn't even able to locate an outlet on that side of the bed. Any tv channels above 10 couldn't keep a connection for more than a split second. The toilet will only flush if you lean your body weight to push down on the lever, almost to the point that you think you will break the handle and lift the toilet off the ground. The desk chair in the room as a piece of metal that cut my leg. The lotion in the bathroom had a broken seal so I threw it away thinking the maid would replace it when she serviced the room but she didn't replace it. While one thing may not be a problem, the combination of these things makes this hotel horrible. \\n\\nUpdate: A couple of days ago, I entered the elevator with an employee. The two elevators in the tower has never worked as long as he's worked there and he says the hotel has enough trouble just trying to keep the working and the service elevator!I don't know how long he has worked there but I assume at least a few months. Today, I push the elevator button and wait. I go to the front desk and all they said was \\"yeah. It doesn't work. You can use the stairs.\\" There isn't even a sign by the elevators to say it is out of service. Also a couple of nights ago, there was a total loss of electricity for over an hour.

After much anxious anticipation, it's here! And it's awesome. I had the opportunity to check out the new place last night at a private event. I was told the public opening is next week. If you've been to the brewery in Lancaster, you have fallen in love with the homey and cozy vibe. They've succeeded in bringing that same vibe to their new space in the city. Homey and cozy and romantic, but at the same time swank and upscale. Tons of gorgeous woodwork: sturdy tables, benches, stools, and bars mixed with industrial elements of pipes, lighting, metal and brick make this space just knockout. \\n\\nThe beer! If you've had Rockmill beer, you know you're getting something special. When I first tried Rockmill they had four beers to choose from. They now have 13 and each one is world class. My new favorite is the Le Boucher which is a Farmhouse IPA. It's not as \\"bitey\\" as a regular IPA and it has a soft, floral finish. It's like drinking an IPA that got dressed up for a special occasion. \\n\\nThe food! They had a select menu last night of options they'll be offering. We tried the fried chicken sandwich and the pickled onion rings. Both outstanding. The chicken was cooked perfectly and I'm not sure what they used for breading but it reminded me of Japanese katsu. Very tender and crispy. The bun that they use for the sandwich is the most chewy brioche. So good. The pickled onion rings are such a genius idea. Just try them.\\n\\nThe staff they've hired are clearly professionals. One, because I know the work history of the GM, and two, I experienced some of the most genuinely passionate staff there. We got to talk extensively with John at the bar upstairs (oh yeah, I forgot to mention there are TWO bars in the new space). He was super personable and fun to talk to. Nick, who was barbacking, chatted us up at the downstairs bar right away. He went above and beyond and took and delivered our food order and answered all of our questions when we first arrived.

I went in with very high expectations because every review is 5 stars so I'm just a little confused on why.  The customer service definitely deserves 5 stars but the quality of the food isn't good but it's not bad. To start off you automatically get garlic knots brought to the table when you dine in, which is a huge plus. The garlic knots were delicious it's the closest to New York knots that I have had in Florida. Then we ordered wings with sweet chili sauce, very good as well. From there, I thought it can only get better. My boyfriend and I ordered a pasta dish and a pizza so we can share and taste more of the menu items. For pizza we ordered the Muzzarella add chicken and garlic. So for the pizza my boyfriend never eats the crusts and he did for this one so he loved it. I thought it was pretty basic nothing wow about it. The pasta we ordered was Marsala. I could make better pasta than that, the sauce was very very watery, so there was no flavor to the meal it just wasn't very good. If I do go back I think I'll just stick to the pizza, wings and knots. One more thing, there needs to be coasters or at least beverage napkins for the drinks because it gets everywhere on the table. Everyones's taste buds are different so I would say it's still worth a try."},{"name":"Burger King","address":"305 Sunrise Blvd","city":"Debary","stars":"1.5","text":"I love Burger King but not this one or the one in Orange city.

It was also marked on the menu.  After about ten or fifteen minutes, my sushi came. I tried one piece and decided to wait for my wife's food.  After about fifteen more minutes, my wife waved to the waitress and she came over with a box for me to put my leftovers in, but the whole meal was there, minus one piece of sushi?  My wife said we didn't need the box, where's my soup, what soup, or sorry.  Another ten or fifteen minutes go by and now the soup.  So let me paint this out more, we were the only two in the place who ordered, there was a family there, that was there before us.  To recap: we ordered marking on menus and she confirmed verbally, the woman wasn't running around busy, she sat on a stool looking at us.

I ordered soup, something to fulfil my hungry tummy. \\nSo...since this is a small restaurant, mainly they sell banh mi for to-go so it's understandable. \\n\\n1) Ambiance/Atmosphere - seemed like they don't have the atmosphere here or maybe it's just me. The restaurant doesn't feel like it has much energy and the decor is very simple, sort-of boring. \\n\\n2) Cleanliness - average and fair. I came around 7PM and it's still looked ok, not that dirty. \\n\\n3) Greetings - ah the greeting...look like they have 2 main people is working so whether the lady to greeted us was tired or that's the way she is...but she just told us \\"sit anywhere you would like\\" and walked away.

We ordered Spring Roll for the appetizer, Pho Dac Biet for myself, & Combo of Beef Pho with full Banh Mi for my husband. \\nSpring Roll - same as many other places - vermicelli with shredded cabbage or herbs along with thinly sliced pork and shrimp. Served with Peanut sauce so be careful if you are allergic to peanut. \\nPho Dac Biet - I admit the broth is good. But, the meat, since it's Dac Biet (Special Combination?), it should have a little bit of everything (the meat) but from I saw is beef, brisket, and beef stripe (and it wasn't that much either). No beef tendon, no beef shank so sort of disappointed.

I had their French toast breakfast burger and that felt like jumping the shark a little - the toast were too big and I couldn't find an easy way to eat it. It felt like 80% toast and 20% burger. I think the real trouble with Toothsome is their service - understanding the size of the restaurant and all that, but the service has always been slow and unresponsive the 4 times I've been now.

First off, I went at 10:20am. Google says it wasn't very busy at that time. That was a lordy lie because the line was out the door. I wasn't mad at the business I'm just saying that to let people know. I waited in line and was super excited because if all these people are going, it must be good. I ordered 12 donuts with 3 of the strawberry rhubarb, 3 of the Nutella, 3 of the honey, and 3 of the cinnamon and sugar. I then ordered two Smoky Robinson chais for my friend and I. There was a green tea chai option which I did not choose because I do not like green tea. There was a herbal chai option but it had fennel in it and I loathe fennel. The next option was a spicy chai with a thai chili pepper and I didn't choose that because I wanted something mellow to try first. The last one was a thai chai which is like twist on the Thai tea I believe. Again, I did not choose that because I wanted something more normal. My review of the Smoky Robinson is that it's meh. It has vanilla, cinnamon, cloves, and smoke. I got both with almond milk. If I were to get this again I would get whole milk because the replacement milks are too thin for this. Next, I did not like the smoke. It over powered a lot of the spiciness of the chai and made me sad because I love the spice of chai. Lastly, it's not sweet at all which was something I disliked. I like chai to have a balance between the sweet and the spice or mostly spice with some sweet. This had none of that. It was like a cup of spiced smoke. I wish they had just a regular option for the people who did not want to experiment with their chai. Lastly, they did get our order wrong. I got one Robinson and then the other one we got was spicy like a pepper and had foam ontop while the Robinson didn't so we think it was the spicy chai. It wasn't a super big deal but kind of bummed us. The donuts are what really saved it honestly. I would not come back for the chais, but for the donuts. They're little rings of deliciousness and they're freshly made. They can help cut out of some the spice from the chai. I've had lots of chais before and I'm not someone who needs something dripping with sweetness, but I appreciate a balance which this lacked for me."},{"name":"Se√±or Frog's","address":"8747 International Drive #103","city":"Orlando","stars":"2.5","text":"The hookah guy is very rude he said he was coming back with my hookah but never returned .when I approach him he said he had paying cutomers as if I didn't pay customer service is customer service"},{"name":"Modern Pastry Shop","address":"257 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Like everyone else here says, Mike's and Modern are the boxers in the ring.

The first red flag was the difficulty, and almost hostility, I received when paying with a debit/credit card. Myself and co-workers have all been told numerous times that \\" we charge you more for using cards.\\" This rubbed my the wrong way, so I looked up Massachusetts State Laws regarding this \\"fee\\" and quickly found that businesses are not allowed to tack on extra change as a penalty for using a card, however, they are more than welcome to offer a discount for those paying with cash. FINE. The menu prices listed, however, are their cash prices, so when you do pay with card, you're charged more than the menu price. I realize this is a small verbiage formality and that I'm just sounding cheap, but my feelings of being cheated have only worsened with additional transactions...\\n\\nI have ordered the same latte, same size, same flavor shot, same woman making it, three times. The first two times, I paid with card and was charged $4.00. The listed price for my latte was 3.25, so I was confused at how tax and their 'card upcharge' fee tacked on an exact extra 75 cents. The third time around I happened to have cash, and sadly when handed my coffee, was again charged $4.00. At this point I was already unhappy with their menu pricing, so I contested it. The woman didn't know how to react. Her tactic was to point at the menu board and claim that the latte is 3.25 and tax is not included in that price. After some more discussion she reveals that my flavor shot is .35 ( which is not mentioned on their menu board). At his point I'm feeling like I might just be crazy, but she turns her computer monitor to me and punches the order in. She comes out with a total of 3.79 or so, just hands me 30 cents, and apologizes.  \\nSo my question is this, if I am being charged 4.00, but their system thinks it received 3.80, where does that 20 cents go?  I realize that 20 cents is a small sum, and that I may be over reacting, however, after the numerous confusions and issues I have had with payment alone, I feel as if there is some shady money handling here.

It's like a different restaurant. Same space and menu and all, but a totally different experience with food and drink and service, the trifecta of dining out. \\n\\nI'll start with the food: so uneven and poorly cooked (for the most part) that it's hard to fathom. Something is seriously amiss in the kitchen. We got the udon noodles with garlic and clams, the baby bok choy, duck confit potstickers, shrimp shumai, edamame hummus, and chicken wings. We also got a couple of cocktails.\\n\\nWhen udon noodles are listed on the menu as being served with garlic and clams, the assumption is that it will be a light white sauce. What came was essentially fat spaghetti noodles with a red sauce. Okay, next time I'll quiz the server (or request that management actually write a menu that represents what is being served so that patrons don't have to play supper roulette or quiz a hapless server). That one's on me. I should have asked more questions. What is on them, however, is one of the worst meals ever: clams so overcooked that they're unrecognizable as clams. Where are the plump bivalves? So desiccated from overcooking that there was a discussion at our table about whether or not there were actually clams in the dish, this amidst big fat clam shells scattered on the top of spaghetti-ohs. That dish is a crime against the culinary arts. \\n\\nThe duck confit potstickers were heavy. Edible but not tasty or really interesting. What passes at boldness -- oh, look, Asian transformation -- is really just a JV mistake. Where's the varsity team? Did the chef taste these?\\n\\nThe shumai was gummy. The chicken wings -- ordered as filler after the meal was unfulfilling (we left plenty on the table) -- were red on the inside. Dangerously undercooked. (I brought one home and microwaved it the next day. It was STILL red inside.) \\n\\nThe edamame hummus was good but the crackers were over-seasoned. \\n\\nOf all the food, the only thing I would order again or even enjoyed was the the bok choy. That's it. Good bok choy.\\n\\nValue? Not really. Two chicken wings were $12. Six tiny shumai: $12. It adds up. It's one thing if everything is expertly cooked and seasoned. But it's not. This isn't a cheap Chinese restaurant where you know you're trading quality for quantity and a recognizable flavor profile. Blue Dragon is expensive and bad.\\n\\nDrinks were crappy. In the past, the cocktails I had here were high end, comparable to any of the restaurants in the neighborhood: Oak and Rowan, Drink, Row 34. (All good choices....) The night we were there they were bland. My Manhattan was watery and tepid, as though it was missing the bitters. And garnished with one single solitary lonely cherry, as though -- what? Who can't make a Manhattan? The bartender at Blue Dragon, that's who.\\n\\nService was uneven. We arrived with reservations to a restaurant with plenty of open tables but hostess seated us at a bar hightop, the kind with teeny tiny stools, precarious like stilts without backs. Did I mention that we had dinner reservations. Dinner?! Not stand-at-the-bar-for-hurricanes-n-apps reservations. We asked to be moved to any one of about ten open tables. Really? We shouldn't have had to ask. Food arrived timely, as did drinks and clearing of the used dishes, but at the end, cash went missing from the tray. Bill was $95 and change. I put down $120 cash. Change was $18 in mixed bills. You do the math. \\n\\nIf it had been a great meal, no problem. But I feel cheated twice. Once during the meal, and once after.

Make a beeline for Burgoo Bistro! The food gods smiled on us and put us in the Sheraton right next to this awesome eatery that (thank you, Universe!) stays open late. \\n\\nFirst, excellent service! Our waitperson was delightful, and I'm kicking myself now cuz I can't remember her name. She was fun, energetic (even an hour from closing), knowledgeable, and spot-on with her suggestions. Decor is warm and welcoming, too.\\n\\nWe started with libations (of course)...my wife enjoyed her favorite Moscow Mule and I had an ice cold R&B Stolen Bike Lager that our server described with pinpoint accuracy as refreshing. It was just what the doctor ordered. We also had some simple flatbread to gnosh on while we waited for our meals, and it was perfect...warm and buttery, with just a hint of garlic. Then things got really good...\\n\\nMy wife had the chicken pot pie, which arrived piping hot in a generous-sized crock with perfectly golden, flaky pastry crust on top. When she cut open the crust to let it cool, it smelled amazing, with the sage and thyme coming through immediately. She was kind enough to share a couple of bites and it was truly delicious...perfectly seasoned with big chunks of chicken, as well as pearl onions and tiny, bite-size mushrooms. \\n\\nI, meanwhile, was presented with my After School Special (I'm old enough to remember those TV shows from the 70s and 80s, so the amusing name was a nice bonus!). It was a combo of a beautiful grilled cheese sandwich alongside a once again generous-sized soup crock of crab bisque that also gave off some wonderful aromas! When I broke open the first half of my sandwich, it did the gooey, melty, cheesy thing that grilled cheese sandwiches are supposed to, but rarely do. At our server's suggestion, I ordered it \\"all the way,\\" with bits of crispy bacon and chunks of fresh tomato. Again, she nailed it...the tomato perfectly complimented the blend of cheeses, and well, bacon! It was easily the best grilled cheese I've ever had. And, let's not forget about the crab bisque! It was the perfect balance of sherry-infused creaminess and fresh crab flavor, with plenty of actual crab meat (Dungeness, I believe) to bite into. The soup and sandwich was the perfect combination, and just what I needed.\\n\\nAdditional note on the service: We got there at 10:00 pm, closing time was 11:00. They seated a party of four next to us at probably 10:35 (I think they'd just come in from a long, international flight), and another single diner behind us a few minutes later. Not only did their food look amazing, too, our server treated them with the same energy and enthusiasm she did us, which I think is pretty special...I've walked into a place 15 minutes before closing and basically been chased out, or at very least gotten eye rolls and heavy sighs. Even when I asked how in the world a restaurant in Vancouver got named after a dish that is almost never found on a menu outside of Kentucky, she cheerfully lead me to the side of the bar to show me original cookbook with \\"Burgoo\\" in the title that inspired the owner. \\n\\nSeriously, this place is special...don't miss it!"},{"name":"Mother‚Äôs Bistro & Bar","address":"121 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Do not order the salmon.

Well, he never brought it and disappeared for 15-20 minutes, So we asked another server if he can get it for us. So Mr. Khalid came to us with the chips and salsa and rudely says \\"You have to ask for it, we are not like other Mexican restaurants where they give it without asking\\" and when I told him we never asked for it anytime before then he says its some servers usually do that. Alright, if you never ask me if I want it, how the heck I am supposed to know you have it or not in the kitchen. After that I saw I'm sweeping the floor without gloves and I don't think he washed his hands before serving anything to other tables, seeing that we didn't even think of ordering food.

Our server Christina was very nice and helpful.\\n\\n\\nFor drinks, my sister ordered the WhistlePig Old Fashioned, which consisted of WhistlePig Rye, Honey Syrup, Orange Peel, and Luxardo Cherry. I sampled her drink. ¬†It wasn't bad. You can taste the cherry and honey syrup blended together.\\n\\n\\nI ordered the one of their popular drinks the Ray's Mai Tai. It conists of Pyrat Rum, Remy Martin VSOP, Cointreau, Pineapple Juice, and Cranberry Juice. It's light, refreshing, and strong. I can see why it's a top seller.\\n\\n\\nMy sister and I couldn't decide on one appetizer so we went with two. First we had the C Crispy Point Judith Calamari. It was lightly breaded along with some fried sweet peppers with San Marzano tomato sauce, lemon aioli. This was one of the best Calamari I've ever had, and the Lemon aioli sauce was fantastic.\\n\\n\\nChristina couldn't stop talking about the Rays Blue Cheese Chips. I was scratching my head for a second. Blue cheese and chips. Boy I was wrong. It consisted of House-made potato chips, Statesboro blue cheese, scallions, tomatoes & bacon. Once it came out I was surprised. The chips were thinly cut and light. The blue cheese and bacon made it taste like you're in food heaven. \\n\\n\\nBefore we selected our Entrees, my sister and I elected to get the field green salad. It consisted of mixed local baby lettuce, candied pecans, dried cranberries, blue cheese, and house made roasted onion balsamic vinaigrette. ¬†Oh my. I am not a huge salad person, but the Artisan Field green salad was amazing! I never had a salad so light and rich with fresh ingredients. It's a salad you don't have to add meat to for it to be great.\\n\\n\\nLast was the Entrees. Knowing my sister, she always goes for the seafood. She selected the grilled Day Boat Jumbo Sea Scallops topped with lemon capers, tomatoes, parsley, and brown butter with seasonal vegetables as a side. I sampled her plate. The scallops, the capers, and lemon blended well. \\n\\n\\nI was debating over steak or fish. Another server Mike made my decision. I ordered his favorite: the Horseradish Encrusted Black Grouper. It consisted of a grilled grouper crusted with horseradish ¬†with Rainbow Swiss chard, Yukon gold whipped potatoes, orange vinaigrette, and balsamic reduction. The crusted horseradish gives the gouper a little kick, which is nice.\\n\\n\\nThe verdict...\\n\\nI was very impressed...Christina was excellent and very knowledgeable with the menu. She was also very patient and attentive with my sister and I. The ¬†beautiful view of the Chattahoochee River makes it more of a destination restaurant for dates, anniversaries, and birthdays.

I asked around to see what the coworkers have tried, liked, didn't like and decided on the Llano Poblano. After ordering and looking around, this place was a step up from the previous Mama Fu's in this location. Clean, fresh, wide open kitchens, high ceiling lines, Wide open natural lighting from the floor to ceiling windows and full length horizontal mirrors, aside from some nice art, to reflect the previous natural light and open the space up. As I was sitting at the bar with coworkers, Tim was our bartender. He had a really respectful, friendly, unpretentious, engaging, professional and welcoming demeanor. Everyone in our sitting at the bar group commented positively on him. The burger came, it was beautiful. I was wondering why it came with a fork and knife. First bite I found out. The bun while beautiful and tasty did not have enough constitution to hold the burger with condiments together. Cut in half, second bite, still a little problem keeping the burger together. Third bite the bottom bun was mush from the deliciousness of the perfectly cooked burger, bacon and melted cheese soaking into the buns foundation as an afterthought. Pro-tip, Immediately flip your burger upside down to keep together as the bottom bun is not the adequate foundation for a burger. That said, flavor wise, amazing service and ambiance, Hopdoddy, I finally get it. While not an every burger, burger place ($) if you want something better than your previous 4 burger establishments offerings, this is the place to try."},{"name":"Lee's Bakery","address":"4005 Buford Hwy NE, Ste C","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Holy shiiii. This place is amazing. I will forever compare other banh mis to Lee's.\\n\\nAh, the beautiful banh mi. A friend was on her way over and asked if I would like for her to bring over a couple extra banh mis they had picked up from Lees. Sure! She brought them over and we left them sitting on the kitchen counter while we caught up for a few hours on a lazy Sunday. She left, and dinnertime rolled around. \\n\\nMy husband and I didn't reheat them. We didn't do anything but unwrap them, plate them and then happily stuff them into our pie holes. Look, if a sandwich can taste THIS GOOD after sitting around for a few hours it was absolutely worth checking out the establishment itself. I was impressed with the crusty bread alone - soft, with just enough give and a slight crunch. I mean, I can sit here and try to describe it but it won't do any justice. Just know that their bread is the bread they serve in heaven. Legit. \\n\\nThe flavors were mesmerizing. I, for one, hate carrots. They have to be cooked a certain way or I can't stomach the smell. Weirdo, I know. But! I barely noticed the pickled carrots on the sandwich and not because they weren't worthy but because the flavor melded so nicely with the other pickled veggies, the bread and the chicken, that it wasn't until I was halfway through that I realized I'd been eating all those carrots. We were hooked.\\n\\nA week later, on a Saturday afternoon, we made the trek to the restaurant. It was fairly busy for the middle of the day. We got two combos: full banh mis, one chicken and one pork, and one beef pho and one seafood pho. No complaints! The flavors, the textures, the crunch and the soft bread... it really is a party for your mouth. We shamelessly stuffed those sandwiches down before they barely saw the light of day. The pork banh mi was incredible. The pork was like nothing I've had before, full of flavor, tender and a little crispy all at once. And the combo pho could be a single meal in itself. It's a pretty decent size! It was delicious and I enjoyed my leftovers later that night. \\n\\nI also had a Thai tea with boba and I loved their boba. Soft, sweet. My new favorite place to get them. I wish they didn't serve it with ice, though. It makes it hard to get the boba up through your straw when you near the end and I don't know about you but I'm not about to let any of those puppies go to waste. Next time I'll request no ice. \\n\\nService was a little slow. It took a long while to be acknowledged, the waiter forgot my Thai tea order and we had to finally ask about it, and the sandwiches came out waaay before the soup did so we sat there for a little bit sadly gazing at our empty tabletops. But even with the slower service, I can't neglect them a star. I have a feeling I'll be back again, and again, and again. And I'm for sure going to buy some of their heavenly bread to bring home for my own sandwiches!"},{"name":"The Toothsome Chocolate Emporium And Savory Feast Kitchen","address":"Universal CityWalk Orlando, 6000 Universal Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Pretty fun looking decor and it always gets a crowd due to being right outside of the theme park entrances.

A place that locals come to hang out.  The community sized tables often have large groups with board games hanging out at them.  They also offer free wifi, so you will often see people working away on their laptops. They have good libations and food served up in an incredibly modern spacious warehouse.  The only downside is that it becomes quite loud inside when it is crowded.  They have created a comfortable setting within this drafty open space.  They also have a quaint outdoor back patio.  There is a second bar that serves up beer in the back.  You walk to the front bar, order your food and drinks, and then find a spot to sit with your number and wait for your food to come too you.  They have a bit of something for everyone. If you don't like beer, they have cider, wine, sake, or meridian hive mead on tap.  One of the few places near me that I can get meridian hive on tap!  The staff are friendly, but the food service is slow and often get your order wrong, or the food is served a tad cool.  The menu is easily labeled for food sensitivities.  My favorite dish is the Joe Vs. avocado bowl.  It makes me hungry just thinking of it.  Their grilled spuds side is a must.  The beer is made onsite, and they have some unique brews.  You can order a flight to sample a variety of what they offer.  The staff are friendly and knowledgeable. The beer is good. Some better than others.  They specilize here in German style beers.

I had had the chicken and waffles at another Metro Diner location, and I wanted to have it again. This location just opened near me, and it's smack dab in the middle of what will be a lot of retail one day. Good location. \\n\\nI got the classic Fried Chicken and Waffle (Half a fried chicken and a Belgian waffle topped with a sweet, strawberry butter and served with our signature sweet and spicy sauce). You literally get four full-sized pieces of fried chicken that are fried to perfection. The waffle is a great size and thickness. The strawberry butter adds that interesting little pop of fruity sweetness that you didn't know that you needed. And the spicy sauce is mixed for you right on your table by your server. They use Louisiana hot sauce, and it's perfect. It cuts through all the sweetness with a little savory and a little heat. I will never come here and not get this. \\n\\nMy girlfriend got two things, the Croissant French Toast (Four pieces of light, buttery croissant, battered and grilled to perfection. Topped with powdered sugar) and the Spicy Honey Chicken Biscuit (Fried chicken tender with spicy honey on a biscuit). The French toast was solid. It was really dense, though, so even though there are only four pieces, it could definitely be a meal for someone. The chicken biscuit was the star of the show, though. The chicken was perfect, and the biscuit was obviously made from scratch. The spicy honey was very southern and very appreciated. I could have eaten four of these things. \\n\\nOverall, if you like old school American Diners, don't knock this place just because it's a chain.

We ordered a second round of drinks, they took about 15 minutes to arrive but our dinner took 35 minutes after ordering.

This isn't the first time I have eaten at a restaurant with a large group and having worked at restaurants myself I know this isn't the case, there is no excuse except for poor service.   I should also add that in that 35 minutes of waiting no one came to our table to check on us or take another drink order.  When food FINALLY did come, there wasn't any food on my plate.  Okay, there was food on my plate BUT I had ordered the house salad which should come with pickled radishes, avocado and corn and it was so sparingly dressed I had to dig to the bottom of the plate to find any of it, all of the digging didn't turn up any avocado, that was simply left off.

She was nice enough, but lacking the experience, detail-focus, and guidance we expected (for example, if we didn't have a good idea of what we were looking for already, she seemed reluctant to suggest anything specific to us)\\n--we left them with my home phone (a land line--which we made sure to note) and email address.  A week later, we got a confused message on my VM about not being able to text us the proposal and do we have another way to be reached.  My fianc√© spoke to the owner later and once again gave her my email address, and she said that she would send me the information that way.  Now two weeks after our tasting, I have still not heard from her.\\n--finally, I have some anxiety about what the cost would have been.  The girl mentioned flowers being \\"really expensive\\" (even though other bakeries seemed to think working with our florist would be simple), delivery could \\"be a big hassle\\" explaining why it's \\"worth the money\\" and a reference was made to \\"before you spend $800 on a cake, . . . \\"  $800?!

She took all of our payments at once and I was afraid she would mix up our order and our payment so I made sure to tell her what I ordered and which payment was mine. Didn't seem like she cared. She left and came back and asked me how much I gave her. I told her and she denied it. I paid cash and was sure I gave her a larger bill and should have gotten more change back than what she gave me. But I didn't want to deal with it so I just let it go. She had asked if we wanted to go boxes and we were going to eat at the bakery but after the incident and her rushing us we decided to take it to go and eat at a nearby park.

I had called three times a day for a month, off and on, and eventually landed a 7:50pm slot.  Upon arrival, showing up 1 hour a head of schedule we were told they were running 10 minutes behind schedule.  We eventually were seated at 8:23pm.  We were really wondering if this place was worth it.\\n \\nWe had Jamie as our server.  He had recommended that we start off with the complimentary bread, and told us that he would give us extra portions of their popular Pretzel Bread.  Boy, was he right to anticipate our needs.  We wolfed down the Pretzel Bread as it was within the top 3 complimentary breads we'd ever had.  Tasting like a soft baked pretzel, but fluffy soft, and so good with the sea salted butter.\\n\\nWe had selected our beers as the fruity Ephemere Beer, and spicy red amber Milefe.  Having liked the Ephemere's granny apple taste and sweetness, we asked Jamie about it, and he mentioned he use to live 15 minutes from the brewery, and how they did not ever sell it in that area, but oddly enough, they sell near the ABC Liquors near where he lives now in Orlando.  So, I will have to see if they sell them near me.\\n\\nI had the Canadian Cheddar Cheese Soup.  I've heard it raved about from previous food bloggers, and just had to have a taste.  Well, it's excellent if you like bacon and salt.  As for me, I like neither, but I can still appreciate the soup, and still say that it is a good soup, just not for my palate.\\n\\nHad the Le Cellier Mushroom Filet Mignon - 8 oz. Canadian AAA Beef Tenderloin with wild mushroom risotto, white truffle butter sauce and micro chervil $43.00.  8 oz, may seem like very little to eat, but that risotto fills you right up.  Everything on that dish is paired up so well.  This is by far the best steak dish I've ever had.  The White Truffle Butter sauce is a mildly rich flavor, and cannot be described by comparing to other food ingredients.  Just wish there was more sauce offered on the steak, but at nearly $880 an ounce for fresh premium grade white truffle, who can blame them.  This steak was ordered medium rare, and they got that perfect.\\n\\nAlso had the Grilled Bone-in Ribeye - 18 oz. bone-in ribeye with herb-parmesan potato wedges and maple-pink peppercorn butter $43.00.  I ordered this as rare as possible, and it came out perfect where the outsides were lightly charred, and the the rest of the inside was still fleshy raw.  I did ask for it to still be mooing, and I got precisely what I ordered.  It was good where the peppercorn butter had the taste of peppercorn without the bite.  It was quite smooth.  The menu mentioned this item may weight 18-22oz.  My piece I would estimate to be about 19-20oz.  If you are ordering for health, don't order this steak.  There is tons of fat on the steak, where in lies the taste.  The potato wedges are nothing special to speak of other than being what they are and having salt and peppercorn on them.  This steak is good.\\n\\nThe dessert we ordered was the pistachio cake with watermelon salsa $10.00.  The pistachio cake is about 3 inches by 5 inches.  It is tiny.  The watermelon salsa is about 2 tablespoons worth.  The cake itself is sandwiched with two hard shelled biscotti like layers, and the inner layer is spongy pistachio cake with no artificial colors.

I thought the prices were good but the portions are MUCH smaller than what I'm used to in Northern Virginia for the exact same price. The Jasmine rice is great and perfectly cooked. I got the meat samosas (prefer veggie) and got the chicken jalfrezi. Knowing I get the same (maybe a tiny bit better) quality back home, I say it's worth it overall. The Naan is great, customer service was great, and the food was cooked to perfection and piping hot when it arrived in Charlestown. I'd suggest the vegetable samosa over the meat.

However it is far larger than either of those other places. As one of the randomly placed factoids pointed out, if you walk around Disney Springs twice, you have walked a 5K. \\nThis place is very impressive with a wide variety of shopping and eateries and entertainment.\\nIt's not just Disney related things. There is a Cirque Du Soleil theatre here, as well as a House of Blues, and even a Dine-In AMC Movie theatre. Plenty to eat here as well. But I do highly recommend you make reservations. As large as this place is, it gets as packed as the theme parks do so you will end up with a 2+hour wait or get turned away outright at any restaurant.\\nAt night, sometimes there are some live performances and entertainment that involve audience participation, such as a dance-off for kids which was fun to watch. \\nAlcohol is becoming quite commonplace at Disney properties now and this place is no exception. There is a boundary for the alcohol. They do not allow you to remove alcohol from this area. As strange as that may sound, it's the policy here. Which is nice, because it seems they are curbing drunk driving. \\nSpeaking of driving, you may be better off just taking uber or some other ride share here. During peak hours, the parking is packed. It's free, but it's packed. It will take you longer to park than it will to actually get to wherever you're going inside Disney Springs. If you're being picked up by uber, I recommend you getting picked up at the Strawberry lot. It's the easiest to get in and out quickly. After learning my lesson from the first time, this is what I did and it was so worth it. \\nThere is also a convenient bus system that goes through here that takes you to various other Disney points of interest as well. It runs often so you won't be waiting too long to catch a ride.\\nKeep in mind that this is still a Disney property, so nothing is cheap here at all. They have to pay for Star Wars somehow right? \\nOverall, it's a great place to hang out with your friends, take your family, or spend a day with your significant other here. Always something to see, always something to do."},{"name":"Luke's Inside Out","address":"1109 S Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Wow the is twice in a row where the sandwich is pretty lacking and bare of meat.

We came across a nice completely empty patio outside Yaletown Brewery, so we figured why not? This could be as good a place as any.\\n\\nWe walked in and were greeted by the most unwelcome, snotty, catty, bitchy hostess who clearly did not want to be there.  We asked if we could sit out on the patio, and she immediately told us that if we were only having drinks, we would only be allowed to sit at the bar.  As we asked about the patio, she literally pointed rudely to the bar.\\n\\nNow don't get me wrong, the bar has an outdoor section as well.  However, it is a a crowded and tiny section outside, that could hardly be considered a patio, plus it was loud as hell with the stupid music.  You can't even hear anyone converse.  That is not what we wanted.  After we sat down to see if it would suffice, a server came by and informed us that all the beer on the menu (which was literally displayed on every table around) was not available due to a problem with the taps.  They had given us a make-shift menu with only FOUR beer options.  All of them tasted like shit.\\n\\nWhen the server did ask us about what we wanted, we mentioned if we could sit on the patio that we saw when we walked in as it was completely empty, and she mentioned we could ask the hostess to move us over and it shouldn't be a problem.\\n\\nSo naturally, we obliged, and went over to ask the midget bitch hostess if we could move.  She didn't even pay any attention to us at first, even though we were the only ones up at the front.  Some old couple came in and she sat them on the outdoor patio that we wanted to sit at.  She then came back and lectured us on how if we wanted to sit out on the patio, that all three of us would have to order one dinner item each, which was complete bullshit, because the old couple were just having wine and no food themselves.\\n\\nAt that point we ended up just sitting at the bar area ordering one of the four shitty beers. I had the scotch ale, which both smelled and tasted as if it came from a horse's ass.  Just absolutely disgusting beer.  Disgusting service.  Disgusting experience.  I will never go back here.  I am going to make sure all of my friends don't come here.  This was such a poor experience, which is horrible, because I know at one point Yaletown Brewing Company was great to go to.\\n\\nI will never forget how rude and snobby both the hostess and the waitress were.  Places like these are meant to make customers feel welcome, but it seems the attitude of the servers and front end staff is downright rotten.\\n\\nI would recommend skipping this place.

If you have been here or plan to visit please be aware that the bartenders do not let you know that when they swipe your card that you have just opened a tab for you. Normal establishments will ask if you want to open a tab or close it out. Since this was my first visit I didn't know it was common practice to just open a tab. Reason I found out is because of my card notifications alerted me of two charges hours apart and the second when I was out home in bed. I called Brewtorium and felt to them my concern wasn't valid and asked that they please have their staff ASK guests if they would like a tab or not. Apparently I had that second charge because they added a tip to my walked tab.

Our waiter delivered a lengthy recitation of the specials and other menu gems to all three of us pairs of couples at the window in a boisterous voice.

Although smaller in size, the exterior shell is crisp, delicate and flaky. The ricotta curd  is seriously light and just deliciously sweet. These hit all the right places on my taste buds and will give you a legit roll-your-eyes kind of pleasure. \\n\\n* Tiramisu: Just as delicious!  The combination of  moist sponge cake soaked with espresso successfully created a party in my mouth - delightful!  \\n\\nJust like any good spot in the city, expect a bit of a line up, but thankfully, it moves quickly.

It was quite different than another one I had with its lemongrass flavor and spice toned down a significant amount, but I still really liked it.

In order to meet for dinner we agreed on meeting partially outside the city in Chelsea.\\n\\nI was a little skeptical about the area which was much more humble and run down than expected and so was fusion foods at first sight. You walk in to a menu board and a staircase; confusing as this is supposed to be a sit-down restaurant. However, when urged upstairs, the top floor opens up in this very quiet, quaint, well decorated floor with 2 and 4 tops and a bar. \\n\\nMy friend A and I ordered starters after a long day of travelling and working; Chicken Satay strips [3] and friend spring rolls. The chicken was juicy and the peanut sauce was chunky as I like it. The spring rolls contained pork and there were plenty of them accompanied with the standard chili dipping sauce. The pork was heartier than expected, a plus. Attempting to delicately make use of the chopsticks we struggled with the first 1 or 2 until I abandoned the approach and resorted MBA style eating -- stabbing the spring roll vertically with 1 chopstick which allowed for a perfect fit into the slim sauce. The process was appalling to A - yet practical. A much faster way to nipping up all the delicious pork.\\n\\nAs main courses, I ordered the Pad Thai with Shrimp and A had the Pho! [Pho Sho he declares, I will have De Pho]. A perfect sized portion, with about 6 succulent shrimp and very mild spice [about a 2]. Excellent. A was overwhelmed with the Pho which came pipping hot. Lip smacking with each spoon full. Plus, they took pretty pictures.\\n\\nOur server turned out to be the owner, who was very prompt in service, yet allowed for a relaxed and delicious meal. The decor was also incredibly tactful. And the music selection was Lounge from the mid to late 2000s.

We ordered five between two people and had quite a bit to take home. \\n\\nThe Parker house rolls were good, but $6 for two rolls feels a bit steep. I love the BLT lettuce wraps. The boar pici was good but a pretty standard pasta. The Thai noodles were simultaneously incredibly spicy and not too flavorful - an odd combination. The last thing that came was the duck nachos, which I didn't have much room for but they were good. \\n\\nIf you're looking for a scene and good cocktails, this is a fun spot.

The dirty wu was just flavor overload, and the others a big too rich and soggy from the sauces. You can't go wrong with just Cinnamon & sugar. I also tried the smokey robinson chai tea and it was too smokey and not sweet enough for me. I wouldn't wait for more than 15 minutes here and it's a better deal to get a dozen.

The big margaritas were a little over $5 with the extra shot so I think those were a happy hour deal as well. The chips were great - there were three different salsas to choose from ranging from sweet corn to spicy verde. The alcohol content of the big margaritas were a little disappointing. I would not recommend getting the blended margarita, it was so sweet, it probably came from a machine. It was a struggle drinking the whole thing just because of how sweet it was.\\n\\nThe food was equally as disappointing. I ordered the crispy tuna tacos and received regular tuna. It came as tuna chunks that were extremely old/dry as if they were frozen or microwaved or over cooked. The tortillas were regular, cold tortillas - similar to what you might find in a grocery store. The toppings were half heartedly put on the tacos. One of my tacos has a lot of spicy sauce and one of them barely had any. \\n\\nService was subpar as well. Our server got two of my group's orders wrong. She always seemed to be missing when we were trying to get her attention.

The flavors were good, and the mac and cheese was stringy and melty, not overly oily or greasy. The brussel sprouts were on point, and the garlic aioli sauce really topped it all off.

Once I saw the prices I realized why - our parents didn't take us to fancy (and expensive) steakhouses when we went to Disney as kids.  Plus we never went to the Canada pavillion anyway (does anyone?)\\n\\nI am always open to trying something new and am a fan of steak so why not -  plus they have a FULL BAR here which is a requirement for parents after a crazy morning in Epcot.  We had noon lunch reservations which I would highly recommend as the place was packed by the time we finished.  \\n\\nI was extremely pleased to see poutine on the menu.  My wife had never tried it before so I was excited to hear what she thought.  Poutine is amazing on it's own - Fries smothered in gravy and cheese.  However the poutine here takes it to another stratosphere.  The gravy is beef Bourguignon including chunks of beef.  The wine flavored gravy provided an incredibly savory base which went perfectly with gruyere cheese curds, truffle, and garlic aioli over crispy fries - OMFG.\\n\\nBe careful when selecting your steak as some steaks are actually from the USA if they cannot be sourced from Canada.  The ribeye was USDA so I had the Canadian Filet which was delicious although closer to medium than the medium rare i requested.  At least they are honest on the menu about their meat sourcing.  The wife had the appetizer mussels as her entree and it was plenty since we started with the poutine as an appetizer.\\n\\nThe service here was exemplary and they even gave our son a nice birthday cake since he had his Happy Birthday pin on.  Overall this is a legit steakhouse at Disney (although I prefer Yachtsman) and will probably return.

You almost can't go wrong here. Food, Froth, and Fun...what more can you ask for when you want to break the midweek hum-drums. I went to YTBP two nights in a row (Wednesday and Thursday) and was equally pleased both nights. Then again, I like to lose myself in a crowd of people having a great time. The Wednesday night we celebrated my friends birthday and then on Thursday I popped in for some nutty event where they were selling 3 martinis for $10. I'm not much of a martini drinker, but I figured at that price you can't go wrong. At any given time, their beer is priced fairly. One of the best things about the YTBP is the microbrew. It's almost like the beer goes right from the kegs to the taps and right into my gullet. For pub style food, the meals here are far above average and the crowd is on the older side. Fellas, if you want to talk to a gal here, the secret is simple...just open your mouth and say hello. This is one of the few remaining places in town that lacks pretense....and in Vancouver, that's like finding a diamond in the rough.  Also the layout of the restaurant is awesome...it has just enough seats to allow those eating comfort enough to enjoy their meal, but for everyone else you are forced to stand up and walk around. I think that is fantastic. Imagine how many ladies you meet walking around. For me, I could either start the night off at the YTBP or have an entire evening there."},{"name":"Modern Pastry Shop","address":"257 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I wanted, scratch that, NEEDED to update my review of Modern.

The burger was as good as promised, the bacon jam bringing the entire sandwich together. The trout was also good, enhanced by the tomatillo sauce. Brussels sprouts are a must if you are a fan. The most interesting dish was the Citrus Salad, an off menu special. Slices of grapefruit and orange with edible flowers on a base of cashew butter and crowned with olives. Sounds like a strange combination but as our server explained, it hits every part of your tongue: salty, sweet, bitter. It was complex and delicious. \\n\\nThe chef has found a way to combine fresh ingredients in interesting ways without torturing them with precious preparations.

To drink, we ordered a Dragon Bowl. If you've ever been to Hong Kong in Harvard Square (which, I'll admit, I frequent with shameful regularity), you're probably familiar with their Scorpion Bowls. This bowl-based, communal version at Blue Dragon will get you the same amount of drunk with less guilt and more class. A winner in my opinion. The fact that it's made with Don Q rum (the rum of choice of Puerto Ricans everywhere) as well as cinnamon made it refreshingly innovative. I was so delighted that I definitely think I drank 3/4 of it (but my friend was nice enough not to mention the unfair split).\\n\\nFor our meal, we ordered the ceviche, which was very fresh and well-marinated, along with the teriyaki bison sliders. The sliders were a good amount of food since they were accompanied by fries and dipping sauce, and the shiitake mushrooms and caramelized onions on top added an amazing flavor to the gamey meat. The buns were also soft and sweet, which really balanced out the flavors and textures of the dish.\\n\\nFor dessert, we indulged in the large, warm chocolate chip cookie with vanilla ice cream and caramel sauce on top. It's served in a hot skillet (like a pizookie from BJ's but better). And I know from experience that you will manage to eat the whole thing no matter how full you are.

I have been to numerous places in Austin and the surrounding areas for queso, I have had them all - good ones, bad ones, salty ones, some with chili or beans in it - a multitude of queso I have had over the years. So I would like to think I have some sort of experience with this.\\n\\nRight off the bat, I noticed - I paid how much for that small amount of queso? I paid an outrageous $6.95 plus tax! I expected a bit more than that small little take home container you get from most Tex Mex places.  For $6.95, heck that usually gets a large size when there is a small and large size to choose from.  Next I notice, it is watery in some places, even traveling over here - you would have thought maybe that would have mixed it more - there was an inconstancy with texture, watered down for sure.  Next, I take a bite - expecting for the price I paid, that this here would be the best dang queso I have ever had!  NOPE! The texture reminded me of when Chipotle came out with their queso, its gritty and clumpy.  I taste onion and garlic, and there is this green sauce in the middle that reminds me of verde sauce that would go over enchiladas.  Now, either I got a really bad batch - which I will probably be writing to Lunchdrop about - or the queso really tastes like this - and people buy it??\\n\\nThere is a wonky taste as well to this queso I cannot quite place my finger on - but it is not pleasant.

Each time I've been here, I've gotten all the varieties of carts to come around - although the dumplings, shumai, and wonton/rice wrapped items definitely circulate here more (I assume to appease the diversity of folks who come around and are more willing to eat these types of food), the saving grace is that China Pearl has a wondrous hot bar that you can take your check to and pick up hot n fresh - get your stamps - and take back to your table - not different from some of the dim sum places in NY.\\n\\nNow to the food, har gow, shu mai, pai gu, chicken feet, sticky rice in lotus leaf, turnip cake, xia cheong fun, beef tripe, & warm custard buns are all top notch for Boston!

Pricing around dining and entertainment, in general, can be very much outside of the average consumer's affordability and spending capacity. I suppose that if you come from somewhere outside of Florida, where cost of living is higher than this state's, then maybe Disney Springs is perfectly priced, possibly even cheap. But speaking from the perspective of someone who knows how much things REALLY cost around Central Florida, things in Disney Springs are above the average price range.\\n\\nHowever, you'd be hard pressed finding the caliber of hospitality and variety that anyone would find in Disney Springs. From movies, to bowling, to eating, to music entertainment, the cliche \\"there's something for everyone\\" really applies here.\\n\\nYou can, however, go to Disney Springs on the cheap. There's no pricing for parking, and you could happily walk around, sight-see and have a great time if that's your jam.\\n\\nAs a local, the high element of \\"touristy\\" doesn't particularly bother me, as it is expected for the area.

This pizza is described as such: \\"Calabrian chilies, hot soppressata, fresh mozzarella, basil, S&S hot honey\\" and to me that sounds like a pizza with a kick!  I don't know if something got mixed up or what, but while I did taste that hint of honey, there was no \\"kick\\" to be found anywhere. In fact, there was no discernible heat at all. It wasn't a bad pizza, but it wasn't what I thought I was ordering.\\n\\nBut I'm glad I waited to write this review, because I came back and it was a completely different experience.  They had garlic knots (yes!) and I have to say something now.  Brace yourselves.\\n\\nBest garlic knots in town.\\n\\nThere is no equal. Previously, this award went to Goodfella's in East Orlando (Colonial and Alafaya) because they're fresh and they DUMP raw chopped garlic on those babies like it's going out of style.

That's how you get to the top of my list, none of this \\"garlic powder and grocery store grated parmesan, reheated so the bread starts to get a little hard\\" crap. Get that away from me.\\n\\nPizza Bruno takes it a step further, adding pecorino and oregano to a mixture of what they refer to as \\"too much garlic.\\" Too much garlic?! Let's not get crazy, \\"too much garlic\\" is an amount of garlic that I have yet to experience. Maybe there was a little left on the plate after the knots were gone, but every bit of pizza crust I had got a quick slide through that heavenly paste before going into my mouth, and I'd be lying if I said a bare finger didn't make it's way across that plate a few times.\\n\\nI got the KBar pizza, and it was delicious. Way better than the Crimson Ghost (which again, I hope was just a mix-up), and full of the flavors of \\"double garlic\\" (might have been quadruple garlic by the time I was done putting some of the garlic knot topping on there), flavorful italian sausage (nothing like the bland crap that most other pizza joints use) and rosemary.\\n\\nMy wife had (I think) the 'RONI -- which sounded pretty basic, but actually had that spicy kick that was lacking in the Crimson Ghost.\\n\\nGreat meal all around.\\n\\nCongratulations Pizza Bruno for winning the \\"Best Garlic Knots in the Universe Probably\\" award for 2017.

We also saw a movie in the movie theater and spent a couple hours inside Disney Quest (which I believe is now or will soon be closed). There were a few especially interesting stores. I really liked the store that sold all the pop art and the House of Blues was cool. There was also a candy store that allowed you to watch them making very intricate candy apples. \\n\\nWe were slightly disappointed by Disney Quest (a one price - play all you want - giant arcade). That was one of the selling points for me having heard all about it from my friend. However, it was pricy to get in and what was actually available and working was not worth it. I could have spent much less money with just dollar bills in a regular arcade and had just as much fun. Many of the games were broken or out of order, and some had just been so badly beaten on they didn't function that well. The virtual reality experience games might have been cool years ago, but the technology is so outdated now that it just looked cheesy and cheap...Those reasons are probably why Disney Quest is closing. \\n\\nThere was plenty of options for entertainment though with a bowling alley, Cirque du Soleil, House of Blues concerts, and more.

We were told by the waitress the restaurant does a choose your dishes and it's family style. It was so disappointing because we spent $220 on several dishes but when served the proportion size was very small and more like an individual entree size than family style. The taste was smh subpar. They used the same sauce for the tofu dish on the eggplant dish. The only difference between the two dishes was the tofu dish had pork and the eggplant dish didn't. It's overpriced for the taste, proportion size, and service. Our waitress was not tentative and didn't come check on us to get our order. We had to flag her down after 30 minutes of being seated to order an appetizer and several other times to order the main course. We tried the eggplant dish, green bean dish, tofu dish, beef fried rice, Chinese cabbage dish , pork ribs appetizers, cauliflower appetizer, noodle and beef dish, a large Chinese bbq meat with buns, and orange chicken dishes. The only 2 dishes out of all the dishes we tried and liked was the orange chicken dish and green beans dish. Taste for both was flavorful and well seasoned. There was a lot of rice and not enough orange chicken on the plate. The Chinese BBQ meat with bun.... the meat had a lot of fat more than meat ratio. Very fatty meat. There was 8 buns given and for the amount of meat there was not enough buns. If you want additional buns it cost $1 per bun. Total rip off.

My experience with the events manager, Blaine, was exceptional. He was super communicative and helpful. I was told that we could have separate checks, which was great as normally it is hard to do that with large groups. This review is 100% about the horrible service that we received by our waitress at the restaurant.  \\n\\nI booked a reservation for 8 at 8:30 PM.  We arrived, were seated, and not approached by our waitress for at least 15 minutes. When she arrived I said, \\"Are we able to do separate che-\\" and she cut me off, put her hand up at me, and said, \\"We'll figure it out at the end.\\" I was totally taken aback and her rudeness, and said, \\"Oh well when I spoke with Blaine he sai-\\" *puts her hand up again* (loudly): \\"I SAID we'll figure it out at the end.\\" I just sat there in disbelief and said, \\"OKAY THEN!\\" -- Absolutely unbelievable. We tried to make small talk with her and she gave half smiles and looked overall annoyed that we were in the restaurant. What a great start to the group's first night in Austin. She took our drink order, and we literally did not see her again until our food came out. 50 minutes later. \\n\\nThe slow food prep would have been perfectly acceptable had we a) not been treated like crap, b) had drink refills, or c) at least had WATER. Our food finally came out, and we were hoping for drink refills at that time. Didn't happen. I don't know why I assumed drink refills would be a reasonable request during our 2.5 hour meal. We then finally got our food and we didn't see her again for another 45 minutes. She never asked how our meals were, checked in with us. Nothing. When she did finally come back, one of the girls was finally able to tell her she didn't like the soup she was served. She apologized, and took it off the check. Oh, well thanks. Could have ordered something else if you came back an hour ago. She saw us sharing water from each other's glasses because we never got refills. \\"Ohhhh I'm bringing refills.\\" - Never did. Shocking. But at that point - we were all finished, thirsty, and just wanted to get out of there. She split the checks, unevenly I may add. And I quote, \\"So I'll just throw whatever on everyone's checks\\" - At that point we then realized that the reason that happened was because she got an automatic 20% tip because of the size of our group. Just a SHOT IN THE DARK, but I'm assuming that is why she paid little to no attention to us, and was blatantly rude. Homegirl knew she was getting 20% of our $500 bill. We finally left, thanking her for nothing. At 10:45 PM. We had been there for 2 hours and 15 minutes. Only seeing our waitress TWO times. Once when she put her hand in the air at me and cut me off. And the other when she gave us our checks with the completely undeserved 20% tip added on. I was *this close* to writing \\"HAHA\\" in the additional tip line. \\n\\nEven if it was busy, there is absolutely no excuse to treat a table that way. She acted as if we were not an important table because no one had ordered alcohol, and she knew she got an automatic tip anyways. I'm not sure if she was late for her poetry slam, needed to catch a plane to Burning Man, or just wanted out of her shift or what. But she needs to take her attitude home and adjust it.\\n\\nI'm not hard to please. But I expect respect when bringing my hard earned money to ANY business. I love the food at Lambert's - and Blaine was fantastic to work with to get our reservation squared way - but this turned me off completely to going back. I didn't expect to be treated that way with a $500+ dinner bill. AT LEAST be fake nice to my face and complain about us behind our backs like a normal person.

I believe it was the same day that Angus swam the entire width of the lake and back in under 3 minutes, and then threw up on Shiny Kyle.  Anyway, we decided after swimming to head over to the Oasis and have some grub before heading home.  There were about 12 of us, and our buddy Cleveland Dave's Parents even showed up, as they were visiting Austin to do some house hunting and wanted to meet all of their son's friends, mostly me.\\n\\nIt started to cloud up and look stormy during dinner, which added fantastic cloud coloring to the one thing that The Oasis consistently does right, they have the best sunset views in the State.  The food that day, as most other times I have been there, was average to good, and the service, as most other times I have been there, was slow.  All through dinner, we could hear the rumbling of thunder in the background, and Alli kept telling me how she was afraid of being struck by lightning.  I, of course, had to tell her my stories about my friend Shelby who has been struck by lightning and survived twice, about how it probably doesn't hurt much, about how the odds of lightning hitting the deck were pretty high, but hitting her in particular were only slim, as there were lots of taller people hanging out with us.  Needless to say,  this didn't allay her fears much, but I was having a lot of fun teasing her.\\n\\nAnd then, sometime later that night, after we left, the place got struck by lightning and nearly burned to the ground.

I particular like that they offer a few traditional Vietnamese dishes with a bit of a fusion twist, such as their Pho Lobster and Pho French Dip Banh Mi!\\n\\nWhat I Ordered:\\n Vietnamese Fried Egg Rolls- I thought these were great, especially since they are served with fresh lettuce, cilantro, mint, and cucumber with a side of fish sauce. These are meant to be eaten like a lettuce wrap and is so refreshing and flavorful even though it is fried. \\n Pho French Dip Banh Mi- This was probably my favorite dish during my visit just because it was so unique! The Banh Mi is a huge toasted French baguette that is crispy on the outside and soft and warm on the inside. It comes filled with roasted beef brisket with a hoisin and sriracha glaze, basil, and bean sprouts with a bowl of pho broth for dipping. The flavors are amazing as the bread soaks up so much broth in every bite. The brisket was a bit tough for me but I'm normally not a huge fan of beef so it could just be my personal preference. \\n Lobster Pho- Lobster, scallops, shrimp, imitation crab with rice noodles in a beef broth. They do a really good job with their pho broth and I enjoyed the seafood pho selection. However, I did find the scallops to be a bit overcooked and tough but the lobster and shrimp were very good. I also love the garlic butter sauce they serve with this pho to dip the seafood in. It was a nice bonus flavor that I wasn't expecting. \\n 3 Musketeer Vermicelli (Bun) Bowl- Vermicelli salad with marinated beef, chicken, & shrimp served with fish sauce. One of my favorite, go-to dishes when I go to a Vietnamese restaurant. I feel like their meat is marinaded with a bit more flavor and sauce which I enjoyed. \\n\\n Mango Sticky Rice Dessert- while this is more of a Thai Dessert than Vietnamese, it was very good. I love the contrast between the warm, soft sticky rice with the fresh, sweet mango pieces. The sweetened coconut cream adds a bit more sweetness and creaminess while the chopped peanuts gives it a salty and crunchy texture. All the flavors and texture of this dessert compliments one another so well! \\n\\n Green Matcha Iced Tea- a delicious, refreshing drink that isn't overwhelmingly sweet but still has a very aromatic fragrance from the green tea. \\n\\n\\nAtmosphere & Decor: Very clean and beautifully decorated for a casual dining experience. They are part of a large shopping center so there is plenty of parking.\\n\\nService: Everyone was very friendly and accommodating during my visit\\n\\nPrice: As with most Vietnamese restaurants, Pho With Us is very reasonably priced with generous portion sizes."},{"name":"Cafe Intermezzo","address":"6000 N Terminal Pkwy, Councourse B","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"The overall atmosphere of this establishment is warm like a nice little cafe in the middle of a crazy airport.
