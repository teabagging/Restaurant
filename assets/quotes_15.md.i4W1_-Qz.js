The fruits and veggies were all fresh, and didn't taste like they came packaged, which I think alot of places do.  Also, the fish tacos were great- and they were NOT catfish!!!  Being from Southern California, it is always a let down when restaurants in Texas offer fish tacos on the menu and then serve catfish- gross! I am not a fan of catfish so this was a nice change.  \\n\\nWhat is also super cool is that you can get mason jars to go of pickled veggies or salad dressing.

We all enjoyed their salsa; fresh and just the right amount of heat. I had the red snapper plate - smaller size with rice, beans, salad, and a few shrimp on the side! It was a massive amount of food, and the Nayarit spices were just perfect. The sizes of the fish are based on weight, but with all of the sides they come with I don't see much reason in ordering the larger size. Don't worry about the fact that the head is still attached to the fish and you may have to pick around a few bones. Take the challenge!\\n\\nAll of the seafood was fresh, flavorful, and well seasoned. All of our meals were a great deal and super flavorful. I was so happy to have authentic Mexican food and not the American version full of orange shredded cheese and heavy fried tortillas.Our server was very friendly and helpful, and even brought out a small flan with a candle for my dad's birthday! This location may be in a strip mall, but it's actually a perfect place for an affordable evening: cheap theater, half price books, and a pet store are also in the area!

Same beautiful tree cover (and lighting and fans) as Freddie's - how on earth do they keep the birds away?!  I was only indoors to use the restroom, but it's very clean and modern with a separate bar area. It's much dressier than the outdoor section.\\n\\nI want to marry the Power Bowl (Bol): Chicken Pastor, kale and spinach, avocado, roasted cauliflower and sweet potato, topped with tasty vinaigrette and a jicama/pineapple pico. The chicken and sweet potato have some heat to it, but nothing crazy. The vinaigrette made me eat all the spinach and kale, just sayin. A lot of food (I felt good about the $13 price tag) and crave worthy. \\n\\nThe guacamole was simple, but expensive at $8 for a half pint. We got some wings to go; even the next day they had a great flavor with a heat that builds. \\n\\nThey serve wood grilled whole fish here: Guajillo Striped Bass. Cannot wait to try it on a special occasion, it's a family favorite. \\n\\nThe frozen margaritas have a wonderful consistency similar to Maudie's: very smooth with zero traces of icy. (Off menu tip: get the chile rim.) The avocado margarita was outstanding, even my avocado-hating hubby dug it. The prickly pear is the prettiest I've ever seen (spare the old Vivo off Manor) and tastes great to boot. It's strong (but doesn't taste it), but by god it better be for $11. As much as I will rave about the look, mouth-feel, and taste of this concoction, I will complain just as loudly about the price. The avocado marg is $12! How on earth are they getting away with it!?

Now, I don't expect the ole $1 margs when it's over 100 degrees, but my wallet still hurts.

Also, walking to and from India House from my car, I often pass by a nearby competing Indian restaurant, sitting completely empty while there is often a wait to be seated at India House.  With those kinds of factors, I wouldn't give too much credibility to the naysayers.    I find the flavors are rich and delicious, the choices are plentiful, the spice is served as hot or mild as you ask it to be.  The prices are right in line with restaurants of this calibre.

It's an awful lot of meat and bread, folks. \\n\\nWe arrived around 1 PM on a recent sunny and cold Saturday. It might have been late for lunch, but there was still a decent-sized line to contend with, followed by a decent-sized wait to receive our food. We killed time by ordering a couple of Mini Marys - SUAE's version of a Bloody Mary. At $4 these were a steal, but unfortunately, just not very good. Horseradish dominated, and though it was freshly grated, was simply too overpowering. There wasn't enough salt or acid, either. At least the kalamata olive, cheese and crostini were an original touch. \\n\\nI ordered the Broad St. Bomber that everybody raves about. The sandwich was huge, and required eating with a knife and fork. The flavors were wonderful, though my wife thought the chef was heavy handed with the thyme. I like thyme, so no complaints here. The beef (eye round) is good quality, and the blend of cheeses was a nice, contrasting touch. It was a very good cheesesteak, but not the best in town (that honor goes to Grant's). I ordered a side of pickled vegetables, which mainly consisted of cauliflower, carrots and celery. I hate cauliflower but scarfed it all down. Pickled veggies = win.\\n\\nMy wife ordered the steak and eggs sandwich, and while the thinly-sliced top round was tender and delicious, she found the horseradish sauce (again with the horseradish!) overpowering. I enjoyed the taste I had, though. The fried egg and white cheddar elevate the sandwich, IMO. She ordered a side of the house made chips, which were crisp if a tad oily and could have used more salt. The portion was generous, though. \\n\\nMy daughter got the meatball sub, which contained 4 generously sized meatballs made of beef, veal, and pork, smothered in a zippy red sauce and a blend of provolone, asiago and parmesan. Another very good sandwich, but also difficult to eat with your hands. She got a side of fries, and we all agreed these were delicious. They are shoestrings, seasoned with salt and rosemary. Almost as good as the fries at Little Big Burger, though a drizzle of truffle oil gives those the edge. \\n\\nAll in all, SUAE is a great lunch stop. It'll fill you up, making the slightly pricey offerings a good value. With a few tweaks here and there (e.g., less horseradish!), I could see it becoming my go-to sandwich place."},{"name":"Jack Allen's Kitchen Oak Hill","address":"7720 Hwy 71 W","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"We visited Austin this Memorial Day weekend from Miami, Florida.

Upon first looking at the menu, I thought that the prices were a little steep for the portions, but the meal was well worth the price considering the high quality.\\n\\nWe started off with an appetizer sampler, consisting of halusky (potato dumplings with feta cheese), bryndzovnik (a flaky pastry filled with potato and cheese), and pierogi (a cheese and potato filled boiled pastry).  Each item was very tasty.  The halusky was very cheesy, and the pierogi were firm and full of filling.  The bryndzovnik was crispy and came with a wonderful cucumber sauce.  While we waited for our appetizers, we were brought complimentary salad, bread, and spread.  The salad was ok, but the bread was great.  It is made fresh at the restaurant, and the spread it comes with is also homemade.  It appeared to be some kind of roasted vegetable spread.  Apparently, it's a big hit with the regulars; Chef Henry's sells tubs of it on request.\\n\\nMy entree was the potato hag - a giant potato pancake filled with shredded and seasoned veggies.  It normally comes with meat, but they make it vegetarian upon request.   The veggies were very flavorful; I asked to have it spicy, and it had just the right amount of heat to compliment the flavor of the food but not overpower it.\\n\\nDessert is a specialty here.  We heard rave reviews about the strudel, and it lived up to the hype.  Even if you're too full for dessert at the end of your meal (which you will be!), get some to go.

My girlfriend and I decided to meet a couple of our friends for drinks and a meal and they recommended North by Northwest.  I'm a huge fan or craft brews and I was intrigued by the fact that this restaurant only offered their own beers.\\n\\nUpon entering the restaurant, I noticed that it was a bit loud; this probably due to the high, industrial like ceiling.  However, this did not end up being an issue.  It was a bit busy and parking was an absolute nightmare, but we squeezed into a spot without having to use the valet.  Our wait averaged about 15 minutes, which on a Friday at 7 p.m. is pretty good!  We were met by our server fairly quickly and drinks started flowing from there.  I started with a Okanogan black ale, which was a bit ballsy since it was 100 degrees outside, but I was pleasantly surprised at how light it was for a black ale.  I won't go on pretending that I'm a beer connoisseur, but I know enough to know that the subsequent drinks I got were all excellent.\\n\\nThe meal itself was also very good.  We started with fried artichoke and I had a side salad as well.  Everyone enjoyed their dishes, from an Artichoke pizza split between 2, a Fresh Veggie Grill, and mine, the Pork Chop Porterhouse.  I'm not the biggest pork eater, but this was absolutely the best pork chop I have ever eaten.  It was remarkably seasoned and paired with some of the most delicious roasted red potatoes ever.  I couldn't get enough of them!  \\n\\nI'll admit that NXNW is a bit pricey, but I like to think it's worth it considering the quality of the meal.

BUT... the young inexperienced server in her employ could not have been worse.  I was willing to overlook the unceremoniously abrupt dumping of dishes on the corner of our table next to my companion's arm, with just a slight perfunctory shove inwards - one of our special rolls on a long dish was actually jutting out precariously over the edge of the table still after she had set it down.  What was really inexcusable was the fact that this server, while still on duty, started eating a chicken wing with her hands, at the server station right next to our table in plain view... while chatting with the owner.  And she showed us what a finger-licking good wing it was indeed!  FAIL FAIL FAIL!!!  The hostess seemed to finally notice something was amiss from our incredulous stares and she cheerfully reprimanded the girl to do her thing in the kitchen (what she should have done was chew her out for chewing in front of their guests!!!).  I then watched our server head into the kitchen, with the hope that she would wash her hands, but unfortunately I just saw her wiping quickly with a piece of paper and that was it.  \\n\\nAs for the food, the Black Dragon Roll was highly recommended by the hostess, and it was good, but nothing original, consisting of two kinds of roe, unagi and shrimp tempura with avocado in a special sauce that I've had at other places as well.  The Yaki Nasu (grilled eggplant) was juicy and had a nice smoky flavour to it.  The rest was downhill from there... The Ebi Mayo had a nice sauce but the so-called tempura batter was far too thick, as was the batter for the Oyster Fry, and the oysters themselves were just tasteless sad little lumps.  We had one more dish coming, the Ox-tongue Robata, which was taking a while so we asked our server to check on it.  She came back a few minutes later, and then almost as an afterthought blurted out 'It's coming' as she shuffled by.  When it did come we found it to be lukewarm and almost cold, and it was really hard to tell whether it was actually ox-tongue we were having or just some thin slices of rubbery beef.

Our server, Matt, was super good-natured and totally humored our group (even joined us for a group photo! hahha). And a nearby table joked with us a bit! And as we left, the manager checked to see how we enjoyed our food and said good bye to us! A friendly bunch all around!\\n\\n2) Waffles + Fruit = Waffle Delight!! Belgian waffle, topped with a fresh mountain of fruit: berries, melons, grapes, kiwi, etc, etc, etc. And...whipped cream! I love breakfast/brunch, and this fruit/waffle partnership is the best. You can eat it all without feeling like you had a super dense meal!\\n\\nIn a perfect world, I would eat the Waffle Delight at Ball Square Cafe everyday. EVERY.

They were nice enough to accommodate a party our size and and gave us the last table large enough. We were sat promptly, however, shit hit the fan when management came to check our IDs. My best from from college came up to visit from Delaware, and they wouldn't let her purchase alcohol. They claimed that her ID was a fake. Management then gave my boyfriend's best friend a hard time for having a state ID and not a driver's license on him. I have never heard that you are required to have a license if you are out of state, if you'd like to purchase alcohol. Unbelievable.\\n\\nThey explained that \\"this is a restaurant\\" and that we could order as much food as we'd like, however, as it was brunch time, we were planning to stay for a while and drink. But after being hassled about our ID's, we decided to quickly eat and go somewhere else.\\n\\nAfter being hassled about our IDs, we left with a sour taste in our mouths.

Boy, was that a mistake. First, it's located on Rainey Street--so be warned and ready for quite an experience. The restaurant was busy when we arrived, but we were seated with no wait, outside on their long, beer garden benches and tables. There's plenty of seating to accommodate many, many patrons so we did not feel cramped or too uncomfortably close to any other patrons. The atmosphere here is very cool, with rows and rows of outdoor bench seating in an open field or under their patio, both areas strewn with romantic string lights. \\n\\nMy friends and I ordered a few beers and not very hungry but wanting to try their famous sausage, I ordered the BBQ Bacon and Shrimp: white cheddar grits and house-made BBQ sauce. This was delicious! The sausage, made of shrimp, was very unique and has an odd texture at first, but after a few bites, you quickly adapt. I loved the BBQ sauce on the sausage and grits; it made for a sweet, interesting addition. The grits were also appropriately rough in texture, which offset the sausage. Their entire menu serves up creative sausages just like the one I had and I can definitely dig it!\\n\\nWhere this place loses points is the service. As we arrived here late at night, I'm sure our server had her fair share dealings with overly drunk and wild college kids, but she seemed short and impatient with our group. Also during my experience, I made a trip to the restroom and noticed a patron vomited all over the floor near the bar. The vomiting is in no way the fault of the restaurant, but I get the impression this place definitely turns into a much more wild atmosphere late at night, so my suggestion is to visit earlier in the evening if you're looking for an appropriate dinner!"},{"name":"Cheyenne Grille","address":"2391 Peachtree Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"This place disappoints me.

While i would have overlooked the size if they were delicious i was not impressed by it's taste. The tortilla wasn't very good, they were made fresh, but not well (too dry) and too small. After two tacos i was still hungry and decided not to order another one because i didn't crave it, even though i was hungry.\\n\\nSalsas:\\nThere were a lot of different options to choose from and there was almost confusion as to which one was hotter than the next. There was red, green, habanero and different spice levels. I'd recommend just 3; hot , mild, medium and leave it at that. I'd also recommend FREE CHIPS AND SALSA!!. \\n\\n\\nChicken Bowl:\\nMy friends chicken bowl on the other hand could have fed us both! The portion was large and everything looked great, when i asked her how it was, she said it was great but that she was full so couldn't finish the rest.

All in all I felt an atmosphere of resentment that we'd paid $40 to have a space they weren't going to use during those hours anyway, and then easily another $60 on food and drinks.

I've heard multiple great things about this place and decided to finally try it. My bill was a little over $30 and definitely did not feel worth it. \\n\\nThe calamari was stuck together so when pulled apart, half the piece would be unbreaded. A mysterious piece of fried chicken was included on the plate of calamari. Seriously? Question mark on my face?  Where did that come from ? It was a bit too salty for me as well, couldn't even use the sauce :(\\n\\nBison burger looked creative, I loved the presentation. I'm not sure how much was bison in the mix but it didn't seem much. I couldn't really taste it. The barbecue sauce over powered the whole sandwich and made it a bit sloppy since the flatbread couldn't retain the juices nor sauce. The tuna melt was probably the best thing I ate out of all three. I believe its a cranberry sauce and it  complimented it really well. The Mac and cheese was really good too. \\n\\nTo try ?

Low light, cool crowd and extremely nice hostesses.  We elected to reserve the sushi bar so we could get the full experience.  Once we got settled in, we dove straight into the menu.  Where to begin we thought??\\n\\nWe started with a special request of a spicy scallop roll, which they were able to do, no questions asked.  Some sashimi tuna as well as the crunch lobster box, which was sooo good.  One thing that impressed us was that we inquired about the Kobe Beef roll.  We asked our waitress how it tasted and she was completely honest.  She said it was good but there was a better roll she recommended.  That was the Crunch Lobster Box.  What is impressive is that the roll she recommended was actually way less expensive than the Kobe Beef roll.  The fact that she steered us to a better roll that was cheaper, speaks volumes of their commitment to their customer experience!\\n\\nOur main course ordered was the black cod, chilean sea bass and rock shrimp tempura.  When we ordered the rock shrimp tempura, our waitress again suggested doing the 1/2 order since we had two other dishes already.  Again, thinking of our experience and not just trying to bill us as much as possible.\\n\\nAll three of the above were superb.  The chilean sea bass though, was easily the top of the list.  Honestly, the next time we go there, we'll probably just order three of those chilean sea bass.  That is a dish I get frequently at restaurants.  This has now become the best one I've ever eaten.  EVER!  And i'm telling you, I've had it at dozens of high end restaurants in many major city.  This one is the best!\\n\\nWhatever you do, this is a must eat place in Atlanta.

All of the wait staff appeared to be under 30 and there are A LOT of them. One of the reasons this place hops is due to sheer number of black clad staff moving about. \\n\\nSo.......it's my son's 20th birthday and I offer to take him to Morton's - but no, he wants Houston's. So Houston's it is - the menu is very limited compared to what it used to be. They used to have a salad that was had fried chicken, avocados, eggs, bacon and such and was served with my first recollection of honey mustard dressing - I didn't see it on the menu so I oped for the hickory burger - done just right - my only complaint was that the bun seem a day old. The cole slaw side was different and very delicious. My wife and son also got burgers and the skinny fries. Both raved about them. So we had a great meal (as burgers go), great service, and a good time.

This is one of maybe two places that have vermicelli worth driving 15 miles for in Austin. Not to mention the Pho! Their prices are the same as any other seemingly hole-in-the-wall vietnamese place, but the quality is what you's expect from a much higher-end place. The dumplings are great and a good deal at under $4 for 8. And the Pho is SO. GOOD. Just what I need for late-night munchies or as a hangover cure on Saturday morning. The service is also outstanding! Seat yourself, get served promptly, food is usually sitting in front of you, piping hot and fabulous (I've never had to send anything back) in about 5 minutes. And the staff are not your typical college kids either- they play good music (Radiohead, local artists, indie stuff, the Toadies- it's always different but always something good), and they sometimes study or play chess at an empty table when it's slow. And they have such a south Austin cult following now that they even offer t-shirts (I don't have one yet but I keep telling myself \\"next time). And for those of you who like that kind of thing, their hot dishes truly are HOT. I happen to be blessed with a future husband who always orders the spiciest thing on the menu, no matter where we are, and he's often disappointed by the promise of five chilli peppers or five stars experience- and in some cases, even a warning by staff to think twice before ordering (I'm looking at you, Thai Noodle House), only to be served something that wouldn't even make my mother ask for a glass of water. This is not the case with Hai Ky, however- when they put an asterisk or chili pepper next to a menu item, you'd better believe they mean it. They also serve great Thai iced tea at at least a dollar less than most other places. Bathrooms are always clean, too. And don't forget the cool local art on the walls ala the Omlettry or Magnolia. It really doesn't get better than this for dirt cheap Vietnamese. Go here once and you will keep coming back. My only warning: if you come late at night after a major day of SXSW or ACL, be prepared for them to be out of, say, noodles or beef- they are very popular which can make ordering at 10:30pm on the Saturday of a festival weekend interesting. :)"},{"name":"Frozen Hoagies Truck","address":"","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Not sure what the hype is... $6 for a scoop of ice cream and two dry cookies?

I was really craving California Pizza Kitchen, but after reading over the menu and wanting to try something new, we decided to give it a try. The setup is similar to Panera, where you order and pay first, and then you get your food. Even though you get your own drinks, the food is brought out to you, which means when you pay, the receipt has the obligatory \\"tip\\" section. It always makes me feel bad not giving a tip if they provide \\"some\\" table service, so I gave them a dollar. This brought the total to just over $10 for the 1/2 Crispy Tenderloins of Chicken sandwich and 1/2 caesar salad combo that I ordered, with water to drink. For that kind of money I expected Panera-sized portions, but was somewhat disappointed when the portions were less fulfilling. Further disappointment was added to the fact that I couldn't order the sandwich and salad I wanted, but had to choose from specific sandwiches and salads they listed on the menu. The sandwich wasn't particularly amazing and the salad, which had bits of what looked and tasted like sun-dried tomatoes, didn't taste like any other caesar salad I've had before. My friend liked the Smokey Southwest Chicken Sandwich he ordered but said he's had better mac and cheese. At the end of the meal, you leave your plates and cups, so you don't have to bus your own table like Panera expects, but I would have rather done that and had better food and more of it."},{"name":"Jack Allen's Kitchen Oak Hill","address":"7720 Hwy 71 W","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Lived in Oak Hill for years and was excited to see Jack Allen's kitchen open up.

I grew up in a city filled with culture and a mecca of great authentic ethnic restaurants. Having grown up enjoying homemade Singaporean/Nonya and Cantonese food we thought we have hit the jackpot with Hawkers. Their pictures looked great, the Siu Yoke looked fresh and crunchy, the Roast duck looked great it - it looked like it was served the way BBQ restaurants would have, the Laksa looked amazing. We were sold by the pictures alone. Everything looked authentic. \\n\\nWe didn't have to wait when we got there though we were there around 8:30pm. We ordered the Laksa, Sui Yoke, Roast Duck and the Basil fried rice. When they brought over the roast duck, we were flabbergasted. It looked nothing like the pictures on Yelp. It was stirfried with some sort of sauce and green onions. That was NOT what we had anticipated. The taste was too salty and it just felt like this was refrigerated roast duck and they stir fried it to hide it. \\n\\nSame goes for the Sui Yoke. Fresh roast pork does not need to be stirfried in oil! It came to us as a jumble of re-fried greasy meat. Again, it gave us the impression that this too was not fresh. \\n\\nThe Laksa was the only winner of the meal. The broth itself was great for taste. The noodles are thin and not the typical noodles normally served in this dish. \\n\\nThe basil fried rice was bland and incredibly oily. Nothing more to say about that. \\n\\nNeedless to say we were so disappointed in Hawkers and will not be going back ever. \\n\\nWhen we get that itch for authentic Chinese BBQ, we will go down the street to Tasty Wok for their delicious and fresh Sui Yoke and Roast Duck."},{"name":"Uptown Park Wine Bar","address":"1784 Jake St","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"You can always depend on Uptown when there's a sports game going on and every other bar is swarming with loud fans.

Various servers were consistently checking on us throughout the night to see if we needed anything in nicely timed intervals.  The only time that we waited to talk to someone (for a couple of extra minutes) was when we were wanting to get the bill and really that didn't bother me at all, as I much prefer being given the space to finish up dinner/drinks and keep conversing than to be rushed out with a bill before being done by a server anxious to turn over the table.  It was a beautiful evening, so getting a nice patio table was great, and it was not noisy or crowded feeling out there at all.  I was also prepared for the meal to be more about getting drinks (large pitcher of red sangria was very good) in case the food was not that great, but I found everything to be pretty good and enjoyable.  We had agedashi tofu, pork gyoza (not particularly remarkable to me, even though it is marked as a specialty of theirs, but definitely good), mentaiko yakiudon (nicely done), takoyaki (with very tender chunks of octopus), and deluxe tempura (which had big chunks of fish and several prawns, and some nice veggies.  Everything looked attractive too.  Bear in mind that we ordered more food as we went along, so we were fairly high maintenance and they had no trouble keeping up, and cleared used dishes efficiently, and all servers were friendly throughout.  This place is much better than I remember from years ago.  It's part of the Kamei group, and I have enjoyed Baru, next to the Scotiabank Theatres as well. The food is not necessarily as exciting/innovative/remarkable as, say, the Guu on Denman Street, but the prices feel right and the drinks especially seem to be a good deal in general.

Well, after almost 10 years in Atlanta, we finally went.\\n\\nSince we had early weekday opera tickets, our reservation was for 5:30. We were early for our seating, and the hostess suggested we have a cocktail or wander the gardens. We did both. The weather was cool and perfect, the sparkling white pinot we sipped was crisp and clean. The vista, charming, green and cheery. The boy's hand, soft and warm in mine. Though with all this waxing poetic I did struggle a tad in my 3 inch heels on gravel paths...c'est la vie I suppose, it meant more clinging to the boy's arm tightly...\\n\\nThe service was attentive and knowledgeable. The bread delicious...soft butter, always a good sign. Black napkin for my black dress, white for the boy's khakis...always appreciative of that.\\n\\nLoved the view from our cozy and roomy booth, did not love as much the waiters hanging at the wait station directly next to us. There should be a law about wait stations in promximity to diners in restaurants. I remember when the boy and I worked in 5 star, we were foribben to hover and to congregate on the dining room floor. We were to \\"appear when needed and disappear when not\\"...magically. I appreciate these nuances of fine dining. Though it did not kill the expererience.\\n\\nLuckily, I was for the most part distracted by the food. \\n\\nWe had:\\nDuck stuffed crispy Georgia Quail with blackberries, roasted vidalia onion puree and cilantro: This was WONDERFUL. The tart of the blackberry,. the sweet of the onion, the fresh brightness of the cilantro contrasting with the crisp light crust and the tender rich complexity of the two birds...just wonderful.\\n\\nSalmon Creek Farms BBQ Pork Belly on english pea terrine and jicama vanilla slaw: I like pork belly. I think this could have been very good. But it was cold, and cold congealed fat is unsettling. Now perhaps a hot belly would pair nice with the chilly cool of the pea terrine and the crisp slaw...but it was not hot.\\n\\nWhole crusted sea bass with garlic, lemon, fennel, capers and olives with fresh green beans: Cooked perfectly, tender sweet flesh was light and firm, buttery in contrast to the bite of the caper...perfect.\\n\\nSlow Roasted Carolina Rabbit with swiss chard-applewood smoked bacon ravioli, candied garlic jus: I had rabbit about six months ago and was wholly disappointed.  Inspired by some darlings romping about my yard this weekend, I decided to give them another chance. I am so glad I did. This was beautiful, meltingly sweet and tender. Redolent of rich dark forests bright with springs youth,heavenly and transporting, yet held to earth by the perfectly paired jus and ravioli. The boy had chosen a tempranillo for me to accompany, and it did so with grace.\\n\\nI was distressed that we had no time for coffee, dessert or aperitives.

Also, if you haven't ever tried Al Pastor, it's the only thing I eat there because you can't get it anywhere else and it's great. Also, put the salsa verde (hot green sauce) on, and don't put beans in the food, they make everything taste more bland no matter what restaurant you're in. Just sayin. This place is great. Also, get the Horchata or Jarritos if you're getting a drink, skip the american junk you can get anywhere around here.\\n\\nAs far as service goes, it can be hit or miss.

My boyfriend and I came in on a Saturday evening, around 7pm. There was nobody waiting around in the 'waiting area' at the front, but we were told the wait would be 40 minutes, and that if we were okay being seated at the bar, that the wait would be shorter. We said okay. They took our name and our phone number. Instead of walking around the plaza, we decided to just wait in the waiting area--mind you, we were seated RIGHT IN FRONT OF ALL THE HOSTESSES. And when I say \\"all\\", I mean the FOUR of them that were constantly up there, taking names and phone numbers and calling guests that had put their names in before us. \\n\\nMore people come in and leave their names, or who have gotten a call on their cell phones and are ready to be seated. We watch as the hostesses yell out the names first, then either go outside the door, or make a call on a cell phone to those guests. \\n\\nAlmost an hour later, after we've figured out there is no possible way all these people had put in their names way before and were just getting calls that their tables were ready, we approach the hostesses and find out that they had called us on our cell phone (we never did receive a call, nor were there 'missed calls', and we actually had the phone out the entire time in case they did). Mind you, the entire time WE HAVE BEEN SITTING RIGHT IN FRONT OF THEM. As in, barely six feet away. In clear view of every single one of them. \\n\\nSo, after figuring out that they have tried to call us and we have been waiting there forever, one of the hostesses finally grabs two menus and takes us over to the bar, WHICH HAS EMPTY SEATS. WE JUST WAITED ALMOST AN HOUR TO BE SEATED, WHEN ALL THIS TIME THERE WAS AVAILABLE SEATING?!???????!\\n\\nOkay, so, pretty ridiculous, right? Pshaw! That's only the beginning, my friend. When I ask to speak with a manager, I first have to explain to the hostesses--all teenagers--why I want to speak with the manager, hoping for just an apology. The first thing out of their mouths? \\"Well, we called you.\\" UM, HELLO???? WE WERE SITTING RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU FOR ALMOST AN HOUR!!!!!!!!!! The entire time, they were busy yelling out everyone else's names; why was ours skipped? Also, THERE WERE FOUR OF YOU AT THE HOSTESS COUNTER. Why didn't a single one of them bother to check on us, as we had obviously been there a LONG time?!? \\n\\nThe hostess that actually talks to me absolutely refuses to take blame---excuse after excuse is piled on: \\"Well, we called you.\\" \\"The bar is open seating, so usually people just walk in and seat themselves.\\" (Never mind that there is a sign at the front saying \\"Please wait to be seated.\\") \\"Well, people who've been here before know that the bar is open seating.\\" (Never mind that they haven't been open long enough to have regulars.) \\"Well, it's a Saturday, so we're super busy and it's chaotic.\\" This last one I completely understand---BUT WE WERE SITTING RIGHT IN FRONT OF THEM THE ENTIRE TIME. This was something none of them could grasp at all!!! It was so baffling!!! \\n\\nThis hostess basically turned away from me as I was talking to her, visibly huffing that I couldn't understand that they had done their part by calling us. She will probably never understand things from our perspective, which is quite sad, and instead will keep maintaining that she had no blame. \\n\\nFinally, they call out their manager, \\"Josh B.\\" Not sure if he's even the actual manager, as his customer service was, honestly, quite embarrassing. Excuse me, I mean his lack of customer service. His first response? \\"Well, they called you.\\" *pause for dramatic effect* HOLY S**T!!! Are you joking me?? This is the first thing out of your mouth??!\\n\\nHe never once looked us in the eye, did not even listen to us, and just offered to seat us at the bar--AGAIN, not even the point, or what we wanted--and in the end, after my boyfriend, who was the patient and nice one, extended his hand and said he understood they were busy and that we really just wanted a sincere apology, he finally seemed to relax. He offered us a free appetizer, which we declined (as there was NO way we were going to dine there after this experience), and then gave us a $20 gift card. \\n\\nWe just left there completely incredulous. I'm sure we have become just another anecdote about irate guests for them to gossip about, and they probably will never try to understand our experience or think about what they could have done differently. All we wanted was a sincere apology, and things would have been completely fine; we weren't looking for a gift card or anything (and in fact, we're just going to give the gift card away.

Chose it for a few critical reasons: 1) obv. great reviews on Yelp 2) a block away from Powell's, one of our must-do's and 3) wanted to get a good taste of a few beers before completely, 100% confidently confirming I'm not a beer person.\\n\\nRESTAURANT & SERVICE\\n-Love the decor/ambiance. Really casual, but still nice. Lots of couples, groups of friends, and even families (changing table in the women's restroom!)\\n-Got seated right away (party of 2) for a late Sunday lunch -- and loved that they were playing the Lakers/Thunder game -- and we got a table with a view of one of the many TVs\\n-Service was great! Crystal was our server and she was super helpful/friendly without being obnoxiously bubbly (that killllls me). She recommended every beer in our 6-beer sampler (6-4oz samplers) after I had told her that I hadn't tried much beer and gave us little blurbs about each one. I didn't quiiiite follow everything she was saying (hops... light.. citrusy...) but totally trusted her recommendations. She also checked in with us regularly (enough) with drink refills, a few more burger items (husband wanted lettuce/tomato and the burger didn't come with them), etcetc. A good service :)\\n\\nFOOD & DRINK\\n-We tried a few beers (six, to be exact) and youuuu knowww what? I just don't like beers! It was interesting to try a bunch of different kinds and catch all the subtle differences between each one... but yeah, I'm just not a beer person.Of the six, we liked the River Ale the best (one of their \\"Classics\\" I think) and the Saison de Perle the least (Belgian Ale... I think?). Probably won't do much good to list out the others we tried knowing that they change so often :)\\n-But, you know what? The food was great! My husband got one of their famous burgers - the Yellow Belly Burger - which had pork loin, roasted cherry tomatoes, whipped goat cheese (which wasn't too pungent, which worked out because not a huge fan) and some fries. The fries were alright, but he said the burger was good. Not as traditional by any means, but he added some lettuce/tomato/onion to balance it out :)\\n-There weren't any real vegan options (bummer) but quite a few vegetarian options. Contemplated one of the yummy salads, but ended up getting the Local Mushroom Pot Pie, which was excellent. Not too cheesy/creamy (that was my worry given my semi-vegan diet) but you know, still awesome. The mushrooms were plentiful and meaty, which went perfect with the potatoes. Yum!

Ok so Romeo I'm not, but I do have to admit, this was my first taco truck visit ever.  I had a marathon shopping trip at the Flower Factory and was pretty hungry after and remembered passing a taco truck on Georgesville.  After reading all the taco truck reviews here on Yelp I decided to give er a whirl.  \\n\\nThe taco truck shares a lot with a greenhouse type place right on Georgesville.  The truck itself looked older so I thought, hmm this should be interesting.  I walked up and checked out the menu posted outside and was shocked at how cheap they were.  $1.25/taco, $1.50/Chalupa.  I placed an order for 2 pork taco's & 1 chalupa.  I should make note that the serving portions are kinda small so if you're hungry, order a few more things than you maybe would.  I walked up placed my order and stepped back to wait with 2 other guys.  I have to say the wait was like 15 minutes it seemed.\\n\\nThe taco's had seasoned pork, that almost tasted like chicken to me.  It was flavored very well and was very moist, not dry.  They top your taco with fresh lettuce, cilantro, tomatoes & white shredded cheese.  Same with the chalupa.  Honestly the only difference from the tacos & chalupa's were that the chalupas had a little thicker soft doughy shell.\\n\\nThe meals are served with limes and also there are vinegar soaked onions, carrots & jalapenos as an add on for the taking along with 3 sauces.  I chose the green mild sauce & it was super flavorful and gave my food an additional burst of fresh herbs and spices, loved it.\\n\\nI'm not a huge flan person, but saw a couple guys eating one so I figured, ah what the hell.  I must say it did not dissapoint.  Was very creamy and swam in a little pool of a burnt sugar liquid that was the perfect topping for the sweet creamy custard.  I would definitely recommend making room for this.\\n\\nOverall would I go here again?  Yes.  Was I blown away, birds singing, stars aligning, eyes rolling back in my head?  No, but it did hit the spot and now I can say I no longer am a TTV..........taco truck virgin."},{"name":"Catedral Tapatia","address":"707 SE 164th Ave","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"Best.

Blew us away. Truly exceptional food and service. It was a little expensive, but Worth every penny. We rarely go out, but we ball out when we do. To start off--the ambiance is nice. Definitely had the classy vibe, but not to the point of being intimidating. Located right on the river, the views are gorgeous. Our server, Maureen, suggested we walk the grounds after our meal and it was pretty neat. They have their own herb and veggie garden and it doesn't get any fresher than that. It also had a really killer outdoor bar on the river which was a nice touch. Now on to the food. Crazy good. Very rarely do I have a meal where each round is a mouthgasm. We started out with a charcuterie plate. A nice combo of some different, but not overwhelming cheeses and some phenomenal meats. My favorite was actually the chicken liver pate which provided a sweet touch. Next up was the salmon/potato cakes appetizer. It had the perfect crunch and a Great sauce. If You check out Canoe, You MUST indulge in the kangaroo. I always enjoy trying exotic meats when I see them and this wasn't a disappointment. Extremely tender and with the caramelized onions--it had a Great sweet/savory vibe.   Everything was Great, but the last three dishes were a trifecta of perfection. The asparagus salad was hands down the best dish that includes the word salad i have ever consumed. A fresh mix of asparagus, fava beans, arugula and what I believe to be capers. It was powerful and hearty without making me hate myself (at this point in the meal anyway). Next up was the duck which proved to be another wise and delicious choice. I loved the asian fusion and the perfect temperature and texture of the dish. We finished off the savory side of things with the rabbit and it could not have been more impressive. The setup was as pretty as a picture and as soon as i touched it the meat fell apart in the best way possible. Sooo tender and the flavor combo with the mushroom ravioli really took it to the next level.     Maureen took amazing care of is. Coming from a fine dining background, I understand the importance of knowledge over such a diverse and intricate menu. She was amazing and full of information. We really enjoy Learning about the food and we are kind of a pain because we always have a ton of questions but she handles it like a champ.

There use to be a parking lot across the street however, they are now building some fancy apartments there so you have to park on the street. I've been ok with finding spots, but I am not great at parallel parking so that can end up being a 10 min ordeal for me. It is what it is though. \\n\\nRestaurant: Just ok. I grew up in the hood so I don't need fancy d√©cor as long as the food is on point and the place is clean. This place does look sorta depressing, but it is clean so... its cool by me.  \\n\\nService: Now THIS is where I have  problem. When I have ordered my food ahead of time and come in to pick it up. The service is ALWAYS on point. Its when I dine in that they test my zen-like patience. The first time I dined in, the server was a young slender man who was polite and attentive enough, but just seemed like he was ready to get off work and go do something more fun. Hey, I get it. I've been there too, especially when I was in my 20's like him. So I really could let that slide. The issue was I had to keep asking me to bring me things.. and it took FOREVER for him to do so. There were only 3 people there for lunch, so I don't know why he was so confused. He brought my initial meal out and forgot my rice and gravy. Once I reminded him, he brought it out and it was cold and the rice was UNDERCOOKED. I am talking crunchy as hell, yall!! With some cold azz brown glob-like gravy on it. I told him to take it back.. I wasn't gonna eat it. I told him why too and he was polite about it but very nonchalant. \\n\\nThe second time I dined in was last night. I was treating a non-vegan friend to his belated birthday meal. As soon as I walked in, (he arrived about 5 min before me and was already a table), I could tell from the looks of the waitress that it was gonna be a hot mess. \\n\\nThe waitress NEVER greeted me (my friend said she didn't great him either). After sitting at our table for about 8 min, I caught her attention and politely started to let her know that when she was free, we were ready to place our order. Before I could get it out, she cut me of and said \\"I will be there shortly\\" and continued to talk to some random dude. That was the beginning of the end. She finally made it over to our table (no smiles and I had to force her to say hello), took our orders and then we waited, and waited and waited. She brought our salads outs and my cornbread with it which I thought was odd. The cornbread was stone cold and hard as a rock. When we finally got our entrees..I asked her to please get me another slice of cornbread because the one she brought out was cold and hard. She repeated it LOUDLY and with an attitude \\"COLD AND HARD!!!!???\\". I wanted to reply \\"yeah..sorta like your heart\\" but I didn't want to chance her spitting in my food. She looked like the type. She brought another slice out and it was the same.. cold and hard and crumbling apart. My mac and cheese was cold.. my sweet potatoes were great and my collards were lukewarm. I cleaned my plate because I was starving. She brought our check out and just laid it on the table.. no Thanks or Kiss my AZZ or nothing. I left cash.. no tip and we bolted. \\n\\nThe funny thing about yesterday's experience was that my friend and I were the only black folks in the place besides the staff. The other patrons were all non-people of color and the waitress catered to them. Damn near jumped over tables to greet them. My friend and I had to laugh that maybe we were in some episode of \\"What Would YOU Do??\\" on reverse racism. LOL. All jokes aside, I don't think race had anything to do with it, as many of my non-black vegan friends have had the same experience with their service. \\n\\nAll in all, this place is good to try out but I don't think I would ever dine in again. I will just continue to take my food to go from time to time and it won't be THAT often either. So sad that a great concept is ruined by mediocre food and bare minimum service."},{"name":"Tarka Indian Kitchen","address":"11501 Rock Rose Ave, Ste 124","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Food is so innovative, fresh, healthy, and delicious!

Kudos to them for having late hours, til 11 on weeknights and whatever qualifies as \\"late\\" on weekends. \\n\\nEver feel like you are on a hidden camera and someone is just waiting behind the wings for you to freak out? I bet that's what the couple next to us felt like. We were seated in between two other couples at the bar. We were the last of the three to be seated. We had picked out our food choices during the wait for our seats and ordered right away. I noticed they had a fantastic taplist and ordered the Walking Man IPA, and before it arrived, here was our Cobb salad! Wow, that was really fast! The toppings were fresh and it looked and tasted great. I loved that they put the dressing on the side. A few bites in the I noticed they forgot the egg. I have a serious egg addiction, so this was more than a little disappointing. Wait. Hold on. The next thing we hear is the waitress apologizing to the couple next to us while we ate their salads. Apparently we had the exact same order. Understandable for sure considering we were all sitting at the bar. We were near the gentleman preparing the salads, so the couple advised again, how they wanted their salad, sans egg, dressing on the side... How do they bring out salad #2? With egg and dressing on the salad. Sad times but after waiting about 20 min for their salad I believe they got it right. Meanwhile we found a large chicken bone in our salad. \\n\\nThe couple on the other side of us? They got apologized to as well. They were given our pizza! Which also coincidentally was the same pizza all of us had ordered (the brick). Unfortunately for them, they had ordered two pizzas, so they had to wait awhile for their second one.  I think they need to come up with a better system (like numbering the seats at the bar) for delivering the food. The pizza, once we got ours, was really quite wonderful. The mozzarella was delicious, the sauce complimented everything well and the crust was great, though I agree with Gary K, it could have been a tad crispier. \\n\\nOverall, wait times are long, the pizza and beer are a tad overpriced and the service needs some work, but I imagine will improve. Once you have the pizza (and hopefully it's the one you ordered!) you'll find yourself willing to forgive a few flaws."},{"name":"Ration & Dram","address":"130 Arizona Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Ordered a milk stout, got a pilsner.

Before we arrived, we called ahead to check the wait time, and they said there was a table available inside. Upon arrival, since we did not make a reservation, they had already given the table to another party. Rather than explain the situation as such, the receptionist went on the defensive and made it out to be our fault the table was gone. A misunderstanding, I'm sure, so I let that slide.

Two of my friends are living it up in Havana as I type this but at least I have Papi's to take my tastebuds to Cuba even if I can't bring my whole self down there.\\n\\nI'd been to the Midtown Papi's and enjoyed the food; therefore I was eager to check out the latest Papi's location at Emory Point. Four of us requested to sit on the patio since it was a mild evening. I noticed a faint odor of fertilizer but I don't know if it was just me. This Papi's did seem roomier and less busy compared to its Midtown sibling; we were seated right away.\\n\\nOur server was smiling and pleasant. He was soft-spoken and had an accent so I had to strain somewhat to understand him, but it wasn't a huge deal. He was patient when it turned out we need several extra minutes to decide on our entrees.\\n\\nMy meal consisted of the vaca frita ($13.99), aka \\"fried cow.\\" The website description of this dish reads \\"Shredded flank steak slowly simmered and saut√©ed with grilled onions, garlic and other Cuban spices!\\" The steak was a little oily, but the terrific flavors made up for that. The portion size was more than plenty, though I could've used more than two chunks of maduros since I love those sweet plantains. You also get your choice of yellow or white rice. The salad was simple and fine. The black beans were appetizing too, definitely not bland. \\n\\nThe entrance to Papi's faces a grassy area; it's to the left of The General Muir's patio. You get three hours of free parking in the Emory Point deck, entrance across from Tin Lizzy's. \\n\\nWill return when I'm craving Cuban."},{"name":"Grindhouse Killer Burgers","address":"6000 N Terminal Pkwy","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"Ordered a turkey burger and received a beef burger.

How do I know? I have Thai friends and the  owners (husband & wife team) are of Thai origin. A good sign. Thai ice tea is excellent and the best authentic Thai fried bananas in town becaue they use the S. Asian types, not the N.American regular bananas from Mexico. Plus the only place that serves my favourite fruit, Jack Fruit with their ice cream with the fried bananas dessert! If you want to really try some authentic dishes, ask the server, they are all Thai and Do NOT order any combo meal.  It's catered to Western people and it isn't really Thai style. Go with at least 3 people and share all your dishes. \\n\\nThe shrimp Tum Yum dish, chicken green curry, or the beef chili salad are the dishes that Thai people actually eat. I have eaten at my friend's house who is Thai and it truly tastes like home made, and that's probably because it is!\\n\\nI've also tried the location downtown, difference is the atmosphere. It is not as quaint and neighbourly feel as the one on Cambie. It does offer more seating though and just a bit more upscale to accommodate the tourists and business patrons nearby.

All the people on the coffee side are very passionate about their products and will gladly share their knowledge or recommendations with you without being patronizing (which would be very easy with coffee being such an esoteric thing).  The owner (or at least the gentleman that I believe is the owner) comes around to make sure that you love what you are getting.  His enthusiasm and positivity are truly contagious.  A lot of times he will talk about the nuances of the espresso that I bought that day (usually the single origin espresso) and make me even more excited about it than I was before.  In all honesty, I have no idea what he is talking about half the time because my palate is not very developed but it doesn't matter.  He even hands out free tastings of the days roasts and talks about where it is from and what the qualities are of the roast.  Pretty awesome.\\n\\nAs far as the food goes, they have a solid selection of lunch food to choose from.  I don't often stay late enough for lunch but I will sometimes treat myself to the curried chicken sandwich and maybe a cup of soup.  Again, a great price for a great product.  I will say that sometimes I feel that a few (definitely not all) of the people on the food side tend to be a little cold towards patrons (in kind of a hipster, condescending way) but I am not cool so that could be it.\\n\\nAll in all, the best coffee in Columbus. There is also a great mix of people there.  You will see attorneys, businessmen, families, a lot of travelers (foreign and domestic), tons of bikers (bicycles), and just plain ol' people.  It's nice to see that everyone appreciates something so purely good.  You can't keep something like that a secret.\\n\\nOh, and before I forget I have to mention the cream.  I don't really order things with cream in them (I like espresso), but if you get something with cream in it (say the honey vanilla latte which is amazing and huge), the cream is great.  I think they get it from a farm in Wooster, OH, and it really sets this place apart and brings their product to a whole new level unmatched by other places I've been.  Ok, I'm done...

Every staff member I experienced was extremely kind.\\nI bought a Groupon for a single process dye and hair cut. When I checked in, she told me there would be an extra fee due to length and thickness of hair, which I figured would be the case since I have hair a little past my shoulder and it's medium thick.\\nThe stylist was very nice, but I think she misunderstood what I wanted. I have brown hair that lights up dramatically due to the sun (and I'm starting to get some gray hairs) so every few months I dye it a medium brown color. She wanted to focus on my roots and blend it out into the rest of my hair. I am pretty easy going with my hair so I trusted her to do what she thought necessary.\\nIt costs an extra $25 just to blow dry your hair after getting it dyed which was a huge turn off. I've had my hair dyed at several places and I've never head of an extra fee for that. She dried a small strip of my hair to give me a general idea of the coloring. It was redder than I wanted but I know that sometimes happens when the dye is settling in so I paid and left.\\nAfter washing it at home several times, it still is quite red on top and brown on the bottom a week later. Some friends at work keep referring to it as a reverse balayage. I'm actively trying to wash the dye out of my hair. It's not awful, but it's definitely not natural and I'm not too thrilled with the amount of money I spent on it when I could probably have better results from a box dye.

Ate there once for dinner and ordered take out last night.  It's a good idea that we ordered take out, because this place was freaking BUSY last night.  It appeared that they were hosting a wedding reception of some sort - every table inside (that I could see, it appeared as if the windows were covered) were packed and a line formed out the front door and on to the sidewalk.  Speaking of the sidewalk, this is where their host area had been set up, since you couldn't even make it in the front door.  Mr. \\"Pushy Vietnamese Guy\\" (as described by Izzy N. below) was manning it.  I get a kick out of this guy, but gimme a minute on him.\\n\\nTonight I had the sesame chicken (adventurous, I know) and the chinese sausage fried rice (this actually was adventurous, for me).  Mrs. Brian I. ordered what she thought would be a veggie dish with General Tso's sauce, but turned out to be tofu.  Strangely enough I LOVED her dish, but she wasn't a big fan of it.  She stuck to some of the veggie fried rice and a bit of steamed rice.  She was cranky for the rest of the night.  ANYWAY, the sesame chicken was fine, about what you'd expect of any americanized chinese dish.  The chinese sausage fried rice was a real treat.  The sausage are actually these little niblets of tangy, salty goodness throughout the rice.  Surprisingly good.\\n\\nOkay, so back to PVG (Pushy Vietnamese Guy).  I think this guy's hilarious.  It looks to me as if he's attempting to size you up for combat when he greets you.  His eyes narrow and he kind of looks at you sideways.  Once, apparently, he realizes that you do not wish to engage in physical confrontation with him he has always warmed up to me.  One really interesting thing to observe is the way he interacts with his co-workers.  I admit I cannot speak or understand the language, but it is terribly fascinating to hear the vigor with which he speaks.  If I had to guess I'd say that they were insulting each other, but I'm probably wrong.\\n\\nOh, and here's a tip: don't attempt to order an Arnold Palmer here.  I'm not sure they have lemonade on site, so they'll squirt some Lemon Juice (like that store-bought ReaLemon crap) into a glass of iced tea.

Also, you can order some add in like chicken or salmon...I got it with andouille sausage.\\nPresentation: Pretty basic with baked penne pasta and additional cheddar cheese sprinkled on top.\\nTaste: Wow, I really was not expecting the smooth spiciness of the sweet chile cream sauce.  I have never had a m&c with that sort of kick and when you add the sausage...boom, a fantastic taste.\\nTexture:  Nicely done considering you usually can get an oily consistency with these ingredients.  The spicy cream sauce brought the whole dish together and went well with the beers.\\n\\nOverall, I love the Deschutes beers and was excited to visit the brewery but it seems a bit more cheesy than some of the other brew pubs in Portland.  There was a lot of touristy types there and the wait for a table on a Friday night was over and hour.

Hawkers was one of my boyfriend's and my favorite dining experience while in Florida.  We came to Hawkers on a Tuesday evening and was pleasantly surprise that it was quite busy.  However, we were able to get seated within ten minutes.  The decor of this place reminded me of chipotle; yes, Chipotle.  It has a modern street feel to it and that is not a bad thing because it is called Hawkers Asian Street Fare.\\n\\nAs for the food, everything on their menu is served tapa-style.  Tapa-style is one of my favorite style to eat because I like variety in my life.  We ended up ordering the char kway teo, the lettuce wraps, their limited edition ramen burger, and the creme br√ªl√©e trio.  Their lettuce warps was something we could have passed on.  It was nothing special, but the rest of the items were amazeballs!!!  Let's start with the char kway teo.  It is a popular Malaysian dish and is very similar to pad thai.  We enjoyed it very much.  It was sort of like a home comfort food.  However, neither my boyfriend nor I are Malaysian or Thai; we simply love good asian noodle dishes.  \\n\\nNow, for the ramen burger.  I have always wanted to try such a thing and this was my first time trying it.  It was such a wonderful experience; one of best food experiences ever.  The ramen bun was meh; it simply was too fragile and broke apart after each bite.  Nonetheless, the meat patty and the accompanying kimchi was out-of-this-world delicious.  My gosh, it was an explosion of flavors in my mouth.  I will never forget that experience.  Moving onto dessert.  The creme br√ªl√©e trio was a trio of tea creme br√ªl√©e.  Yes, tea; how innovative!  It consisted of thai tea, milk tea, and green tea.  As a tea enthusiast and sweet tooth fanatic I was all over that dessert.\\n\\nWhy Hawkers are you not located where I live?

With this card you get to sign into the computer on location and start selecting your beers. The card helps you sample 200 different beers and helps you gain awards for drinking beer. Including T-shirts, free beer and the grand prize a $100 party for you and friends after drinking your 200th beer. \\n\\nMy favorite specialty beers are Xingu a Brazilan beer, Breckenridge Vanilla Porter, Youngs Double Chocalate Stout, Arrogant Bastard by Stone Brewery, Buffalo Bills Pumpkin Brew, and Rogue Santas Reserve. My favorite seasonals are Christmas and Fall. \\nI have currently tasted/drank 75 beers. One other great thing about the saucer is the staff. For instance tonight I was going to try the 512 Cascabel Cream Stout and I found out that it was tapped out. I then ordered a Breckenridge Avalanche, a very smooth Amber. I was asked if I wanted another beer so I asked my saucer girl to pick me out something like the 512 Cascabel Stout, knowing from previous experience that the saucer girls truly know their beers. She obliged and brought me back a very nice stout beer that had hints of meaty, smoky, coffee and chocolate, very tasty called Ranger Creek Mesquite Smoked Porter.

Lets swing by anna's. \\n\\nThough the burrito establishment on MIT campus shares the same name as the one in CC it is not on the same level. \\n\\nThe burritos are inconsistent, the flavor and mixing of the ingredients are not quite right and the biggest flaw, it has none of the anna's character that i have grown to love. This place feels... fancy. Clean, polished, brightly colored counter... even the people who work there seem more professional. Thats not what i want when i get annas.

At 1 hr wait, we still had 6 parties before us. The management system for tables is very poor. They also have open bar seating and these wooden bar flags that are first come first serve to allow you to order food from the bar. In my opinion, the bar flags make it unfair for those who are trying to wait a long time for a table. It slows down the kitchen and makes everyone wait longer for food and  inefficient. They had plenty of spots open at the tables.

I've brunched here twice and it's worth the wait in my opinion. They don't take reservations and won't seat you until the whole party is there. Expect to wait 30 minutes to an hour on a Sunday morning, but you can get a coffee or mimosa at the bar and a pastry to make waiting not as bad. They brew Rev coffee from Smyrna, one of my local faves. I got a cortado and it was tasty and strong. \\n\\nThey have indoor seating and a patio. They don't offer bottomless mimosas, which is understandable cause then people would never leave and tables would take longer to open up. You can get a mimosa flight though, which comes with either 3 ($15), 6 ($30) or 9 ($45) half pours. They have like 8 different flavors, including strawberry mintmosa, blueberry, hibiscus, pomegranate, elderflower lemon, etc. I am an unofficial mimosa taste tester, and they all have my seal of approval, hehe. My favorite would have to be the blood orange. \\n\\nWe ordered some sweets for the table- the banana bread and cookies and milk pie. They have homemade pop tarts(!!) we wanted to try but unfortunately were out. Banana bread was very dense but good, no complaints here. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE PIE THOUGH. The cookies and milk pie ($4.50 for a huge slice) was on a whole other level. Sinfully delicious layers of chocolate chip cookies and airy whipped cream. If you have a sweet tooth, definitely get this. \\n\\nI've only had the biscuits and gravy here. Actually, the whole table unanimously got them this past Sunday-- they're that darn good. Comes with two open-faced biscuit halves, sausage gravy and chorizo. Accompanying it are the most fluffy soft scrambled cheddar cheese eggs I've ever had. I've tried and failed many times to cook my eggs this perfect at home. I'd say this makes top 5 in my all time favorite brunch dishes, and I brunch pretty much every weekend. I've heard the shrimp and grits are also amazing. \\n\\nService isn't the quickest and it can get a little chaotic in there-- they're super busy. But it's always attentive and friendly.

We walked in and had no idea where or what the menu was because all the menus were where you place the order which someone was ordering at the time we got there. Once we realized they did indeed have a menu, we looked it over. Seemed like every other pizza place, nothing on the menu really stood out to us. I did like the bar selection they had some good beers and some nice wines (apparently some wines you can't get anywhere but restaurants) I had the independence sour beer... it's was delicious... but I can't give credit to aviator pizza for that beer (maybe just for them carrying it). While ordering our pizza the lady asked if we wanted ranch? Now why mention that you might ask, because any amazing pizza place will never serve their pizza with ranch! And personally I love ranch on my pizza but I've been to many pizza places that do not offer ranch and yes I am a bit upset but I did not need the ranch to eat my pizza at those places because the pizza is amazing by itself.... I needed my ranch here! So I am glad they had that option. The toppings looked alright but man that crust was just horrible. My boyfriend and I ate all our pizza but that's becuase we were  hungry as hell and well we eat digorno pizza sometimes. Shoot I'll even eat a tostinos pizza but not for the price we paid here. We may have been really loud critics in there because some lady came up to us asking how we liked the pizza... trying to be nice we didn't say up front we didn't really like it, we tried to compliment the toppings being pretty good, then after being asked a few more times I finally said I think the crust is bland. She said they do have the option of adding Garlic butter on the crust because their crust is sweeter than most and not thag saltyness most are used to....

My after work experiences have always been less than stellar with a slightly rude bar staff but I figured if we got a table and actually had a meal I might be pleasantly surprised as the food has always looked pretty decent.  \\n\\nWe went on a friday and had about a 45 minute wait which was expected.  We sat at the bar and had a few drinks first while waiting for our table and my sister and brother in law to arrive.  The hostess found us when our table was ready (about 40 minutes.  It was nice to have received a fairly accurate wait time).  We were seated at a high top at the bar which was cozy and not too loud.  Our server came over and noticed we already had drinks so left us for a few minutes to decide what we wanted.\\n\\nI ended up ordering the Cheggy burger rare with swiss cheese instead of american.  My boyfriend and brother in law also ordered the cheggy, medium rare and my brother in law asked for cheddar instead of american.  My sister ordered the fish and chips.  After taking our order we were left alone for a little while.  I noticed everyone else around us had a basket of bread and we were all starving so we finally tracked her down and asked for bread.  When we finally got it it was very cold as if it had just come out of the fridge and pretty stale.  Luckily our food came out about 5 minutes later.\\n\\nMy boyfriends burger looked great, very red, a little more rare than medium rare so I was excited about my burger as I have a hard time actually getting a rare burger anywhere.  My brother in law had the same experience, a nice red/pink color to his medium rare burger and he received cheddar as he requested.  I cut into my burger and it was medium.  There was almost no color to it at all and it was slathered with American cheese.  Being the only person at the table that ordered their burger rare, I have no idea how mine came out the most cooked of anyone's.  I also don't get why it's so difficult to put a different piece of cheese on a burger.  I was pretty frustrated and didn't really enjoy my food as anything over medium rare to me is pretty much a waste.  The fries were also disappointing.  We've ordered them before as an appetizer and they're probably one of my favorite fries.  Unfortunately tonight instead of being crispy and well seasoned they were limp and pretty bland.  My sister's fish and chips came out and my first comment was \\"That looks really overcooked\\". The fish was a deep dark brown.  It was either overcooked or they used old, dirty oil.  Either way it didn't look very appetizing.  I had a bite and it was okay but I would def. never order it after having tried that.\\n\\nWhen we were done the waitress asked us if we would like dessert.  None of the options sounded very appetizing and I know they're shipped in and not made in house so we all skipped and went home.  Service was mediocre.  Nothing great, nothing to complain about.\\n\\nI went home full but not happy.  I've given Black Horse many chances but I def. won't be recommending this place to anyone.  For an extra $3 you can get a gourmet, fresh, local, properly cooked amazing burger at Parson's Table.  This place is just a bar with substandard fare.\\n\\n***After cleaning out my purse of all my old receipts the other day I found my tab from Black Horse.  They charged me extra to switch my cheese which wasn't even switched.  An extra $2 to change from American to Swiss and American to Cheddar is kind of a rip off if you ask me. Especially considering I still got American.  Boooo***"},{"name":"Kells Brewery","address":"210 NW 21st Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Came here at a weekend.

They talk about how special it was to come here when they wanted a treat, a hot dinner already made, an this is what they could afford.  The story goes that I only wanted to eat the mac and cheese and would throw tantrums when they forced me (or tried to) to eat the rest of my LuAnn platter. I can only guess that, in addition to being stubborn from a young age, the mac and cheese must have been really tasty.\\n\\nMy parents hadn't been here in over 30 years, and now visiting Austin decided they wanted to take a walk down memory lane. So off we go, to the Luby's of their yesteryears, all doe-eyed and nostalgic. It was disappointing to them (and me), but also a lesson, that to try and relive your past memories almost invariably fails, because time has passed and things always change. Such is life.\\n\\nThe decor is blah, but that's the okay part. I have never visited a restaurant or eating establishment where every single staff member uniformly appears to be utterly miserable. It was weird, and sad, but whatever, we were going to give it a chance. It is a cafeteria, so you walk down the long line of food in metal containers, indicating to the sad-looking people behind the bar, what items you would like.  There are no labels or descriptions, its just metal tins with bland-looking food items in them. The \\"food\\" looks gross, like plastic. Even the food in the advertising displayed in the restaurant, looks gray, and unappetizing. But whatever, it was too late, we were there, and we were hungry.\\n\\nTHE FOOD:\\nI had the fried fish (the only possibly edible item on my LuAnn platter), the salmon patty (ew.), the loaded mash potatoes (500 calories I'll never get back), and the mac and cheese (absolutely a waste of everything). To elaborate a bit, the mac and cheese was just tasteless mush in a watery liquid. Others in my part had the grilled fish (which had multiple layers of variable consistency ranging from mushy to chewy, each equally flavorless), the chicken fried steak (a definite NO), the fried okra (salty as all hell). The bread roll was the best part of my meal, even without using the \\"butter taste spread\\" offered with it.\\n\\nTHE BATHROOM:\\nHold it if you can. The stench as you walk in is enough to take you over that threshold you already found yourself at, after eating the food here, and just throw up. Mildew. So gross. Really, really bad.\\n\\nTHE VERDICT:\\nI will never return, nor will my , parents. And I would advise you to seek elsewhere for nourishment. Instead of \\"All you can eat\\" (which, per my parents, did not exist in their day, but then, being obese was also not the norm at that time), they should call it \\"All you can handle before you throw up\\".

Husband did the pork chop with pulled pork- it was perfectly cooked so it had all the juiciness and none of the dry, leathery feel a lean pork chop could end up becoming.  His mashed potatoes were just so-so, a little watery and without much seasoning.  I had the trout which was done perfectly- nice and flaky with just the right amount of pecan crusting.  The sauce complimented the dish well as did the broccolini. The risotto was a little bit of a let down because it was runny and the texture was off: risottos I tend to like have that creamy, richness that makes you feel like you are eating something quite decadent.  For dessert we split the lemon tart, very refreshing and incredibly tasty.\\n\\nI have to say our server, Daryl, was incredibly friendly, very knowledgable and quite ready to answer any of our questions.

My two favorite ones were the Pilsner and Ales for Als. \\n\\nWe tried two of the small bites menu items - pretzel & grilled corn tart and they were both great.

It was also crunchy...not in a crispy sense but in hardened pieces of seasoning sense. The Porchetta comes with nothing on it, but a side of their Tomato sauce (good sauce but doesn't really go with the sandwich).

The menu is long with a ton of pizza options, but I knew exactly what we wanted! We shared the margherita (pomodoro, fresh mozz, olive oil, basil, grana padano) and the capricciosa (prosciutto cotto, oven-roasted mushrooms, artichokes, olives, pomodoro, fresh mozz). Our server recommended that each pie was personal sized, however we barely were able to finish two between us. Originally I thought we'd have leftovers but we managed to stuff the last few slices down because they were too good to even let get cold.  \\n\\nThe margherita was just slightly soggy in the center but I know fresh mozz often does that to pizza. It wasn't as bad as I've experienced at another \\"certified\\" Napoletana pizzeria back home in Denver so they are doing something right. The mushroom artichoke pizza by far stole the show though. It was lightly topped so the crust didn't go soft but there were enough tasty morsels on top to have a bit of something in each bite. The prosciutto was in small pieces, not huge slices which I always struggle to eat. It was AMAZING! The sauce on both was tangy with just enough salt. We ate all of our crust pieces dipped into the spicy oil on the table.

That was so cool of him! The drink was amazing and complicated. I have no idea what was in it, but it was tasty. I did feel bad that I couldn't finish it because I'm also trying to stay away from sugar for a while to, so I only had about 1/4 of it. My friend had more. Anyway - that was super kind and I appreciated it.\\nBesides the tasty drinks and friendly service, the place is well located in Kenmore Square and the interior is luxe without being pompous. I'll definitely be back (when I'm drinking again!)"},{"name":"Du Kuh Bee","address":"12590 SW 1st St","city":"Beaverton","stars":"4","text":"My family and I love this place.

The only con to this place is that it is way too high for what you're getting. If I'm paying $13-$14 for noodles and meat, I'm expecting a hardy portion of BOTH noodles and meat.

I checked my bank account and they had processed the charge without even stopping to see that they had over charged me. No one from the restaurant called me to inform me that they caught this mis-charge or apologize instead I had to call the restaurant to let them know that I was overcharged by 205%. They said that they accidentally charged me for the table next to mine and would reverse and re-bill for the correct amount. A few minutes later I realized that I gave my waitress a 20% tip of $157 which is $30, way too much for a $76 brunch however the restaurant never asked me about adjusting the tip amount so I had to call AGAIN. I was never offered any form of compensation for their \\"accident\\" or for the mis-charge remaining on my bank account for 3 days. \\n\\nGreat food but it's a shame that they have sneaky management.

In fact, we rushed to cross the border so we could have lunch here before the lunchtime crowd.  We were super hungry to eat their well known xlb and beef rolls.  When we got here, the parking lot was pretty full.  My husband dropped me off and I quickly went into the restaurant to put my name down.  The restaurant was super busy!  The line went out the door.  However, the staff was super efficient in getting people in and then out.  We waited for about 15 minutes until we were seated.\\n\\nFirst of all, the service was terrible.  The waitresses were basically running around busily because they were probably understaffed.  They were serving so many tables in a hurried fashion.  I had to wait about 10 min before I got one of their attention.  I tried making eye contact and raised my hands but nothing got their attention.  I would have overlooked the poor service if the food was good...\\n\\nThe food was not very good.  First of all, the portions are pretty small.  We ordered the herb/tofu dish and it was a small plateful.  It tasted okay.  The second item that we ordered was the beef roll.  It was again a paltry size.  I've had really good beef rolls before and it was always stuffed with delicious beef.  Instead, you barely get any stuffed inside.  It tasted alright.  I think it was the best thing we ordered.  Then came the xlbs.  We ordered two servings because we read on blogs that this restaurant makes one of the best in town.  I felt regretful that we ordered two of them because they weren't very good.  The stuffing inside the xlb was just pork.  It tasted really porky.  I  don't know how to better explain it.  Usually when I've had xlbs at Joe's Shanghai in New York or Ding Tai Fung, the xlbs are wonderfully seasoned where they have some green onions or some kind of vegetable to balance out the flavors.  Instead, their xlbs purely consisted of pork.  It was not good.  There was no complexity to it.  The last thing we ordered was the giu zhai ha (leek pancake).  It was under seasoned.

I love the atmosphere outside, although once the summer heat passes, it will be even more enjoyable. This place is super dog friendly as well. They have a mini dog park and offer a menu for your pup. \\nTheir beer menu is impressive. I love getting to try a new beer every time I visit. The severs have a great knowledge as well when it comes to the beers so don't be afraid to ask. \\nBoth times we have been, we enjoyed the chili cheese fries as an appetizer. I love the chili they use. It's definitely not the canned stuff some other places use. The first time I went I had the the regular old hot dog, which the name escapes me. I had it on a kolache bun with curry ketchup. This was definitely the best \\"hot dog\\" I have ever had. The second time I had the beef and pork dog again on a kolache bun, since it's the best bun ever. Again I opted for the curry ketchup because I am not an adventurous eater. I absolutely loved this once. This will definitely be what I have when I visit again. \\nMy only cons are the service is a bit slow but this place just opened.

I had the crispy chicken sandwich. The chicken was cooked well, but lacked flavor. It was incredibly bland. It had a dressing/sauce on it that made the burger impossible to eat with your hands and ruined the bun as it was soaked in this crap. And the sauce itself had good intentions, but again, very bland. My fries were okay. I love the idea of what they do with them, but when they come out cold and looking like you got the last of what was lying around, it makes you not want to consume them. \\n\\nThe BF got the chicken and waffle sliders with a side of mashed potatoes and gravy.

I really could have done without the soft taco, and in fact gave it to my husband to finish.

In Chinese, it's actually called \\"Big Town Hot Pot\\". But they translated it as China Hot Pot. I guess China is a big town. \\n\\nThe AYCE is about $18.95 per person. They give you a 2 hour limit so you don't eat them out of the business. Also, if you have leftovers, they might charge $10 per pound. So you better not go crazy. They also have a special sections which they charge extra for. These feature cool stuff like squids, tendon, etc. \\n\\nSpeaking of having leftovers, they have no indication how much food they bring you. They have a ton of stuff on the menu, and they're all different amounts per plates. \\n\\nThey have no instructions. The waitresses speak English well enough, but they don't explain how it works. Therefore, we were confused at the beginning. Since nothing was explained, we thought we had to order everything in the beginning. So we ended up ordering too much. \\n\\nSome of the plates were piled high with food. Others were not. But we freaked out how much food came out. Luckily we finished most of it and didn't incur the $10/pound penalty. It would've sucked if we did. It's better to be conservative at the beginning and order continuously as you need more food.\\n\\nFor the pots, they have 4 different kinds: spicy, nutrition,  spicy/nutrition combo, and plain. They subliminally told us to get the spicy/nutrition pot. So we did. It comes with a divider in the middle where one side is the nutrition broth and the other is the spicy broth. I think the nutrition is the best broth. The spicy one tasted like a pet store and too oily. I would just get the nutrition broth next time. \\n\\nUnlike some of the other hot pot places, everyone shares a communal pot. You don't get your own pot. So you better be okay sharing your germs with other people. I don't mind. It'll get vaporized by the boiling water anyway.\\n\\nLike I mentioned, there's a lot of stuff on the menu. I tried a bunch of them. All the proteins seemed to be enough for 1-1/2 person. So don't go crazy with the proteins in the beginning. They seem to give you the most amount for the beef and lamb slices. I suggest going with those to start. \\n\\nI wasn't a fan of their seaweed in the vegetable section. I didn't like their lamb balls either. Their squid was okay. Also, they gave us too much tendon. So order tendon if you really love it. Then again, it could be because we were so stuffed after eating lamb, fish, cuttle fish balls, squid, beef, lamb balls, and a bunch of vegetables that the tendon seemed too much. The rest of them were standard hotpot fare. Some ingredients didn't seem too fresh, but they were fine. It was good. \\n\\nI give 4 stars for the food. 3 stars for unclear instructions on how the ordering works."},{"name":"China Pacific","address":"107 Ranch Rd 620 S","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"I have never been a man of many words but china pacific definatly deserves some. great food, service and lunch specials.

Personally, I've never had \\"high-end\\" Chinese food before so had really high expectations for this menu but everything was so underwhelming that it was just hilarious. \\n\\nFor starters, we booked the Dineout reso using the Opentable platform since it was available and two days prior to the event, they had called my friend to tell us not to be late or else they'd give away our table. Well, by the time we decided on this place, the only times were either 5:00pm or 8:30pm on a Sunday night so we went for the 5:00pm availability. \\n\\nOn the day of the event, we arrived at 4:57pm and they wouldn't sit us. The hostess said we would have to wait until 5:00pm to be seated, which we did and even when the clock struck 5pm, she didn't sit us. It was understandable since it wasn't our reservation time yet and that they might have been getting our table ready so we patiently lingered around the front; besides us, there was one other party that also had a 5pm reso. When 5pm came around, we still didn't get seated and it wasn't until we reminded her that it was 5:01pm, did she let us in and I guess that's where the first red light of the night began. We were led into an empty dining room and to our seats. The other couple with the reso came at 5:10pm and they were given the equal opportunity to sit (despite being late) so I'm not sure what the call two days prior was about for being on time when we literally had the whole place to ourselves with the entire team of 5-6 waiters. \\n\\nOne of the friends had to go back to the parking lot to pay for the parking since the pay by phone function wasn't working properly and they left the restaurant. When they tried to enter back in, the hostess stopped her at the front and my friend quickly responded that our party was already seated. The hostess responded by asking her for the reservation name and checking the reservation before allowing her through. When they came back and told us the story, we were all questioning the hostess' behaviour. We had higher expectations for this place as I mentioned, the place was literally empty so I'm not sure why it was necessary to stop someone at the door and it even felt a little inattentive of the hostess to notice that the friend was the one who they talked to earlier at 4:57pm and made us wait, the friend was also the one who reminded her to let us in...so from the many interactions, you'd think the hostess would recognize at least one person in our party by now as there was no other table besides ours. \\n\\nAs for food, it was extremely underwhelming. The sweet and sour pork tasted like any other sweet and sour pork that you'd get, it'd be insulting to say it tasted like Panda Express but that was literally what our table was thinking of, or even the infamous No. 9 restaurant. There was nothing special about the dish in terms of using different ingredients such as passionfruit or lychee to bring it up a notch. The sauce has the same taste as your typical sweet and sour pork. The only thing different was that the pork is a little more lean than your typical so maybe that is what iberico pork tastes like...I have no idea. \\n\\nThe three cup chicken is served on a plate. Presentation was very underwhelming as well. Reminded us of Pearl Castle. \\n\\nThe best thing of the night was the dessert and but even then, is that worth the $40? \\n\\nBetween our appies and the main, since we were the only people there and perhaps the cooks were just batch cooking our orders, they had to halt bringing out our mains as we weren't even finished our appies and servers were already bringing out our mains. When they realized that we weren't done, they had to set the mains down and wait until we were finished with our appies before they could set the table for the mains; same thing happened with the desserts...\\n\\nWhen it came time to pay, our waitress was pretty much breathing down our necks and watching super closely to our card payments. Definitely felt very uncomfortable and pressured to tip her despite the fact that she barely serviced us the entire night. We got our water refilled once and even though people got wine pairings and the tea, they didn't bring out the pairings with the courses until we reminded them to and they only refilled the water to the tea once even though tea there is $5 for a mere little pot. \\n\\nOverall, it was really unnecessary to be dressing up to be having such an underwhelming evening. Think food is better at any local Chinese restaurant at less than half the price. You'd expect stellar staff and service at least because of the location but nope, didn't feel comfortable at all the whole evening with the staff always eyeing our table and not actually servicing us or being attentive.

Over a year now actually. LeRoy & Lewis Barbecue has been serving up BBQ for that long, and I was there on day one. LeRoy you say? Yes, it is the same Evan LeRoy formerly of Freedmen's Bar. He partnered with Sawyer Lewis who has managed Houston's Coltivare and Austin's Contigo. With all of her front of house experience, Sawyer and Evan make a wonderful duo. Located in the food truck park next to Cosmic Coffee + Beer Garden, #NewSchoolBBQ is served with a side of great customer service. You can also eat your Q in air conditioning at Cosmic.\\n\\nHungry yet after scrolling through the photos? I do not know about you guys, but I am, and I am the one who took them. I sort of have a love/hate relationship with LeRoy & Lewis. I love the food, but kind of hating the ever-changing menu. Every other week or so, I will see a new dish and want to stop by ASAP. It really is not a bad thing, but my waistline and wallet might argue with that. Check out their website for the weekly menu. Meats, sides, and desserts are all rotated in and out.\\n\\nYou can eat at LeRoy & Lewis for every meal. Start the day with a Rosen's bagel at Cosmic, and the schmear options are from L&L. Brisket schmear? Yup. Next level stuff there. Whatever is not sold for lunch service will be available for dinner. The star of that show is the smoked burger. The patties are formed from brisket trimmings and smoked. Before they are served, they get blasted in the firebox on a cast iron. The seared patties get a slice of American cheese, topped with onions grilled in the burger drippings, aioli, and pickles, and placed between a potato bun. So freaking good. It is one of the best in town. That would be a fantastic day of eating.\\n\\nLet's talk about the lunch menu. It is not going to look like most of your traditional Texas BBQ menu. Good news? The brisket might be my favorite in town. Bad news? It is only available on Saturdays. That peppery crust is a thing of beauty. What you can expect to find most days of the week is beef cheeks. It is so good that I will forget about the brisket while I am eating it. The meat is really tender, smoky, and has more surface area for pepper, just the way I like it. Because the menu is constantly changing, I rarely get the same order.\\n\\nWhen I stopped in for brisket, Szechuan beef rib, and porchetta one day, it was probably the best meal I had this year (2018). Everything was cooked really well and packed a ton of flavor. While I enjoy pretty much all of the proteins offered here, the mac and cheese stuffed quail did not blow me away. I do not think the combination of texture works well together here. When it was Evan's birthday, the crew smoked a whole hog. It made me excited for our upcoming Carolina tour. If you are around during Heat Week, participate in it. Challenge your taste buds and digestive system. A lot of fun fiery dishes will be served. There are plate lunches now so you get more value for your dollar.\\n\\nDo not forget about the sides. It is a great way to get your veggies in. The cheesy squash, marinated tomatoes, and Sambal cucumbers have been some of my favorites. I hate kale. I try to eat it to be \\"healthy.\\" The kale Caesar salad however offered by LeRoy & Lewis is a work of a genius. It is refreshing, balanced, and has a good crunch. If you see fried rice on the menu, order it. It eats like a meal and is really comforting. One time I got a banana pudding/bread pudding hybrid for dessert. The idea sounds great, but the execution fell short in my opinion. It might be that I like my bread pudding to be warmer and more fluid. They made up for it with the banana pudding ice cream sandwich with vanilla wafer cookies. It tasted like you were eating banana pudding between your finger. Satisfying. \\n\\nWhat is next for LeRoy & Lewis? Evan and Sawyer are looking for a brick and mortar location. There has been no timetable set yet. I know they want more space to work with. Once they have that, Sawyer's husband, Nathan, will get involved and head up the brewery part of the business. Until then, keep eating at one of the great BBQ joints Austin has to offer. Do go in with an open mind though. LeRoy & Lewis is redefining Texas barbecue, and it is working. It does not have to be just the Texas Trinity anymore. Someone who is smoking Texas BBQ in California refuses to go to L&L because they do not serve traditional Texas BBQ. Idiot. He does not what he is missing out on."},{"name":"Banger's Sausage House & Beer Garden","address":"79 81 & 81.5 Rainey St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"We only had 30 minutes before the movies but we really wanted to grab a bite here and try out some of the beer.\\n\\nWhen seated, we told the server that we are in a bit of a hurry.

Although I probably would try a different kind of bread next time.  I would highly recommend just sticking with 1 topping and 1 sauce... or just have them all on the side.  2 of each is a tad too much of an overload.\\n2)  Beet & goat cheese with 2 toppings and 2 sauces:  i love beet and i love cheese.  i love vegetarian food but i guess when i am eating a sausage... i want to eat a sausage?  this one really was just okay to me so i am not sure why so many people rave about it.  again, would recommend sauce/toppings on the side.  otherwise it's just too messy and perhaps a little overpowering of flavors all over the place.\\n3)  German potato salad: this was awesome.  i love potatoes in all shape of form and i like my mashed potatoes / potato salad chunky with skin... and this fits the bill!!!!\\n4)  Jalapeno Cream Corn with Onion Gratin: soooo soooo sooo good.  at first i thought it was just okay. but stir it up and make sure u get a little bit of everything in each bite and it's excellente!!!

I ordered the chicken family style meal and I'll admit it wasn't bad, the roasted sweet potatoes were good, as was the grilled broccoli, the sauce on the chicken was amazing and the chicken was moist.

I'll be very honest that if this was an actual restaurant it would probably be 3 stars but honestly i enjoyed this more than emos which is an actual restaurant. I tried the lunch special as recommended by my sister and it's choose two meats, soup, 1 mandu, rice, and half a orange. The serving is kind of panda express snd they scoop up the preprepared meat from various containers behind a glass case. The meal came out to a total of 6.50 i believe. Which is quite a steal at ut for asian food. I got the beef bulgolgi and the spicy chicken. The mandu was surprisingly good. The rice was good as well. The soup was ehh it was miso soup but i wasn't into it. The beef bulgolgi was surprisingly good as well and didn't have that bad oily fermented after taste that many bulgolgi dishes in austin have. The spicy chicken was basically general tsaos chicken at a cheap chinese take out restaurant. But i enjoyed the meal and it made me feel the nostalgia of being able to eat one of my favorite foods. My only warning is that it gets cold pretty fast so if you get the lunch special be sure to eat fast.

Granted, we did not have a reservation, but after meeting friends for drinks in the square, we noticed a few empty tables so went in to have dinner. We sat for a long time with no wait staff approaching and then the hostess noticed and brought us water and said she find out server. We ended up having a woman come up who did not appear to be a server, and definitely did not have the service, verbal or social skills or appropriate clothing to be a manager. We still are not sure what her position was. She did not tell us there were any specials and was pretty brusk. After ordering wine, appetizers and dinner, we did not see her again for quite awhile and then watched her stand at the hostess station and chat for a long time. In that time another table was seated near us and they were immediately approached by a young waiter and told about specials. Their drinks and appetizers were delivered before ours as were quite a few people at the bar. On top of all of this, I thought the wine tasted a bit vinegary. We drank it anyway and then ordered a different one. It was vinegary, too. I said something about the second glass because my husband's tasted different than mine and I thought maybe I got the last of an old bottle and he the first of a new bottle. The waiter took my glass away and brought me a taste of a 3rd wine rather than a fresh glass of the 2nd one we had ordered. The 3rd wine was the exact same color as the two previous glasses (all very light, clear red) and tasted very similar. I love red wine, Pinot Noir, in particular and it is almost never light red or vinegary. I told the waiter, never mind, I was fine without more wine. When we got our bill that glass of wine that he took away was on my bill. I own my own business and think customer service is incredibly important. This was very poor customer service. That glass of wine should have been comped or he should have brought me a new glass. I just don't know what was going on there last night. I did not say anything then because that young server said he was new there and I did not want to cause him trouble, as I see that issue being one of poor training by the management. I did love the Burrata and Arancini  appetizers but did not like the pork ribs at all. The veggies under the ribs were good, but not the ribs.

Their brewery here in Portland has many excellent beers and an even more impressive food menu.  Its a huge place with lots of indoor and outdoor seating, and very family friendly.  Yes I've seen many families toast beers with kids drinking milk.  I normally don't do beer for lunch, but I will with a good food pairing.\\n\\nI ordered their beer sampler to share with the wife: you get to pick 6x4 oz beers.  It was either by coincident or by design as they arranged the beers in order of ascending ABV: from #1 (4%) to #6 (7%).  I liked every one of the beers - I think my last three were most memorable: Inversion IPA, Fresh Squeezed IPA, and Blindside Porter.\\n\\nWe split two entrees: \\n\\nSpicy Chicken and Waffles was very impressive.  Two gigantic pieces of chicken breast, marinated in their beer to be incredibly moist and juicy.  The breading was crispy and super spicy.  The waffle was the thinner type and had layers of shredded kale and cheese to help balance the sweetness of the maple syrup.  Its a 4.5 star dish for me, perhaps slightly behind Bluestem's version in SF.\\n\\nThe Yellow Belly Burger was recommended by our waiter.  A 1/3 -pound  beef burger topped with rootbeer-braises pork belly to add some richness!  It also had a yellow tomato and some pesto.  Very juicy burger!  Fries were crispy and thick cut, perfect with that local organic ketchup. 5 stars.\\n\\nHighly recommend having at least one meal (lunch or dinner) at Portland's many breweries.  Its hard to go wrong with Deschutes!  5 stars!"},{"name":"Angelina's Greek Gyros","address":"112 NW Couch St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Wow!

The presentation is top notch and looks very inviting. The meat itself is very well seasoned and blends in together perfectly with the lettuce, tomato and pickle and Zaziki sauce wrapped in pita bread. \\n\\nThe restaurant itself looked very clean and inviting in addition to everyone being super friendly.

I just haven't been there in a while until last night. My friend and I decided to head there for a celebration dinner (she just finished her masters program) and it was great. There were so many things on the menu we both wanted to try we couldn't make up our minds! So, we ordered a bottle of wine and snacked on some bread while we decided. I love the butter they serve with their bread... its light and full of herbs and easy to spread. We decided to share the Shrimp and Grits as an appetizer... The portion is huge... I would recommend it as an entree if you are not sharing. The shrimp was perfectly cooked and the sausage was amazing... The grits were a little dryer than I usually like, but, the tomato sauce helped loosen them up a bit. \\n\\nFor our second courses I opted for the Grilled Asparagus appetizer with a poached egg and vegetable fritter... Again, a very large portion for an appetizer. The vinaigrette was great, the fritter was pretty good... I wasn't expecting to like it that much. My friend ordered the Grilled Artichokes (not my first choice), but, it looked great and I had a little taste of the Tuscan Bread salad and the white bean puree... Both delicious! \\n\\nSince we were celebrating, we shared the Cheesecake... YUM!!! \\n\\nSome of my other favorites are.... the House Salad with spiced pecans, red wine poached pears, and creamy gorgonzola vinaigrette.. So good. I also really like the Lasagna (it easily serves two), anything they make with Duck and the crab cake are also favorites. .\\n\\nYour bill can kinda get away from you if you don't pay attention and order carefully. Because the appetizers are so large, I usually get a salad and an appetizer as my entree or I like to do a lot of sharing. \\n\\nThe patio and bar area are my favorite places to sit... The only thing I was a little disappointed about on my last visit was the lack of music... It seemed really quiet in the bar area. \\n\\nI love the fact that they actually change the menu at G Michael's seasonally...

I had never been here before, though I did used to come to this address regularly when it was a Pizzeria Uno and when I worked in Lake Mary/Heathrow. I didn't know anything about the Tilted Kilt before heading over - I thought it may just be a sports bar and not much more - and ended up being surprised in several ways.\\n\\nThe group I was meeting with already was here when I arrived and were drinking glasses of beer. Just after I sat down, our server - a pretty blonde dressed in some rather revealing attire - asked if I'd like a drink. I ordered a Bud Light. After it was served, I noticed that the glass looked like a pint glass, which is why I didn't think anything of it when I saw the ones being used as I arrived. However, these are maybe slightly taller and wider (at least around the top of the glass, as far as width goes). Bonus! The group watched the football game on a gigantic (maybe that should be in capital letters - GIGANTIC) TV screen. As far as I can tell, it's the largest one in the establishment. There are many other TVs inside, but this one is at least several times the size of the others. One of my friends estimated that it might be at least 12 feet from corner to corner. Seriously, this screen is pretty unbelievable. Our group even went so far as to ask the server if it was possible to reserve this area/TV for the regular season Giants games. Haha. I think that was a little ambitious. Who knows, though? We may end up watching some games here during the season, though our regular spot is at Mugshots in Altamonte Springs.\\n\\nI can't remember anything specific from the menu since we didn't order food. My father paid for my beers, so I'm not sure how much those cost. I will be back at some point, however - maybe sooner rather than later, too, since the NFL season is right around the corner. This is a pretty nice place. All of the servers, from what I can tell, are scantily-clad females, which likely is part of the allure for many men who come here. I wasn't expecting that at all, but I'm not complaining!\\n\\nI should note that there is a cool outdoor seating area just to the left of the main entrance. When this building used to be Pizzeria Uno, this seating area did not exist. It now adds a cool touch. There also is an outdoor bar area (the bar is inside the building and you order through an opening/window in the wall) which overlooks most of the outdoor seating area. This might be a cool place to sit outside and watch a game.

When you walk into a real southern bbq spot, you should be overwhelmed with the smell of smoke. This just smells like a dive bar. \\n\\nThe sides: Fries were tasty. Coleslaw was crisp and tasted right. The beans were noticeably undercooked. It's kind of ridiculous for a bbq place to send out undercooked beans. They make a batch of like 40 lbs a day I assume.

However, I broke my vow today under the pressure of the six-year-old girl I was babysitting today. She insisted that I give pho a second chance, and when I asked if their food was salty she rolled her eyes and informed me that they \\"don't even use a grain of salt.\\" So with the reassurance of a six-year-old, I decided to give it another try. Actually, I ended up ordering the tofu and vegetable noodle bowl but it was seriously a taste sensation. It came with this magical sauce and I can't even guess what it was made of but I didn't care. The portions were huge- enough to last me about two more meals as leftovers and the prices were extremely reasonable. \\n\\nThe bowl came with rice noodles, shredded cucumber and lettuce, mushrooms, carrots, broccoli, onions, seasoned tofu and those little bean sprout things whose name I don't technically know but are served with many Asian dishes. The size of the bowl eclipsed the size of my head by a long shot and only cost about $8. Seriously, we only spent about $20 on all of the food that will easily last days as leftovers. \\n\\nThe little girl ordered the steak pho and chicken spring rolls, neither of which I tried because I don't do meat (yeah, I'm one of those girls) but she seemed over the moon delighted with them and she is generally a picky kid so that says a lot. The servers even gave her two free lollipops after dinner and boxed up all of our food for us. So great service, great food, and great ambiance. Wow, I'm sad that \\"great\\" is the only adjective that comes to mind at the moment. You get my point. I will definitely dine at Vina again!"},{"name":"Shiki","address":"9 Babcock St","city":"Brookline","stars":"3.5","text":"I do not have an extensive base of authentic Japanese food knowledge, which can always be a little worrying going into a more authentic-style restaurant. I have had experiences elsewhere where the waitstaff is brusque, bordering on rude to people who are obviously not experts on their type of cuisine. This was not AT ALL the case at Shiki. Our waitress was attentive, friendly, and extremely open to answering questions. If we weren't sure about something, she would not just tell us what it was, but also describe the flavor and even texture so that we would have a better idea of whether or not we might like it.\\n\\nWe ordered a bunch of different dishes and everything was delicious, with lots of different flavor profiles and approaches. The sushi was very good and fresh. The portions are not huge, but the only thing we ordered that seemed unusually small was a Japanese pickle plate, which went beyond small-plate/tapas-size and into 'bites,' in my opinion. There is a decent-size sake menu too.\\n\\nThere are a variety of vegetable options and some vegetarian sushi options, so if you are not into raw fish but still want authentic Japanese food, you should be able to put together a good meal here.\\n\\nIt is a very small restaurant.

Plenty of locally sourced options, and there is pride put into the quality and presentation of the dishes.  The net effect is a noticeable difference between how your typical chain treats food as a unit in a production line vs. how a place like Jack Allen's treats it as an experience for the customer.  Delicious.\\n\\n- If you are looking for a comparison, I would compare it favorably to Z-Tejas.  They have some similar aspects in terms of the Tex-ish, southwestern menu selection and general feel.

Usually I feel that I am asked to do this once and then forget about it. But because they asked us several times to give them feedback on where they can improve, we did. It wasn't anything bad. But we didn't really like the plates they used for their salads. Little stuff. I didn't leave a comment about the entrance being awkward, but I should have.

I went on a Sunday evening, which, granted, is not the ideal time to go for a place that likely has a mainly weekday lunch crowd.  But the \\"food\\" was actually inedible, and I'm not terribly picky when it comes to mediocre food, but this fell short of even that label.  \\n\\nThe server was nice.  The \\"brisket\\" was nothing of the kind.  It was tough and dry and flavorless.  It seemed like it had been boiled, not smoked, and then left out.  Or maybe someone was halfway done making it into jerky.  My boyfriend claimed that even his dog wouldn't have eaten it.  (This is probably a lie.  His dog would have eaten it, because he's a dog.  But the dog would probably prefer to chew sticks.)  \\n\\nThe beans were not good.  The sausage was fine. The cole slaw tasted alright, but was very sad and wilted, and I was suspicious it was several days old.  The rest of my party had chopped beef (not as bad as the brisket, but not good either), red potatoes (fine, nothing special), banana pudding (more like a custard than a pudding, but actually really good), and pork ribs (also pretty good).  The sauce got mixed reviews at our table: I thought it was fine, the boyfriend thought it was an insult to bbq sauce everywhere.  \\n\\nOverall, the food ranged from mediocre to truly inedible with mild suspicion of food poisoning.   There is no occasion to subject yourself to such a travesty.  If you are actually starving or entering diabetic shock, you should walk one more block to the convenience store.  Or barter with the homeless who sit right outside of it."},{"name":"Bertucci's Italian Restaurant","address":"475 Winter St","city":"Waltham","stars":"3","text":"I'm a big fan of their bread and the pizza, though specific and not the best by any means can be very tasty if that's what you're going for.

At least offer to bring another piece or dish to compensate (even though I wouldn't have eaten it because it was that disgusting).  Roast pig is supposed to have a crispy outer skin with a little bit of fat attached to a meaty piece of tender juicy pork.  This was NOTHING close.  It tasted like a pork jerky fried for 20 minutes.  I kid you not.  \\n\\nI also ordered the pan fried noodles and that was super oily and salty.

Everything about it is just plain adorable.  I kind of feel like I'm at the beach rather than in Atlanta.  I say that because it's delightfully low key - seat yourself, somewhat lackadaisical service, and dogs welcome.  All of which are fantastic as far as I'm concerned though.  In a city of pretentious brunch spots (aka last weekend's epic fail for thrice the price at Watershed), it's nice to have a laid back place to sit back and enjoy at a leisurely pace.\\n\\nThe menu is simple, and you can find some relatively healthy finds on it.  Today I opted for my old standby egg white omelet with spinach, mushrooms, and feta.  Delightful!  It's a hearty three egg omelet served with home fries and cantaloupe.  My friend had a burger, which looked wonderful as well.

The actual dining area had a very college cafeteria feel (partly because this place is popular with the college crowd). But if you're not here for a mind blowing ambience experience, you really can't find better value for your buck. \\n\\nWe both had our usual- I had the chicken drunken noodle and the boyfriend had his chicken pad Thai. Regarding my drunken noodle- really good. The noodles didn't clump together and it came with a relatively large amount of vegetables (actually, the portion itself was also quite generous, particularly for $9). The sauce wasn't very spicy, nor was it quite as flavorful as some that i have had in the past, but I thought it was OK. Overall, I was actually satisfied with my drunken noodle, which is a first since moving to Boston. The pad Thai was good, very flavorful, although I'm not a big pad Thai fan myself. The soup noodles look delicious and I will definitely have to try it when winter comes. We also got a coconut bubble tea and was pleasantly surprised that they used real coconut and made kind of a coconut slushy with it.

We've been doing so since it opened.  I think I wrote a review a couple years back, and wanted to provide an update, now that we've been there at least 20 times.\\n\\nThis place never ceases to disappoint.  To be fair, the pizza isn't bad, pretty above average actually.  It's no Ken's Artisan, or Apizza Scholls, but it's far better than a chain pizza place.  And their bar pours well, good drinks at a reasonable price.  And the decor seems quite nice.\\n\\nBut this place fails on all other fronts.  The menu is very hit and miss.  Pasta is a step below Olive Garden, and entrees look worse.  But far and away, the fatal flaw is the service.  Terrible, terrible, terrible service.  Always.  After over 20 times coming here, each and every time was terrible service.  At least half every visit we've made, our orders arrived incorrect.  No joke.  The waitstaff is sullen, and appears to be doing a favor.  We once waited an hour to be served, and once we ordered, but our order was never turned in, so we waited 90 minutes for no food.  We've come to cringe when we go here.  It's so bad that the service has become a running joke amongst my family.

I'll have to visit again to go up any stars. We came here last weekend for lunch for my hubby's bday. First thing, it absolutely stunk, literally, having to walk past the dumpsters to get to the entrance. Once at the entrance, the atmosphere is lovely with a view of the restaurant garden if you sit on the patio at the entrance. Service was excellent! They explained how the food comes out in a paced manner and explained every player in detail when it came to the table. It may have been helpful to explain with as much detail when asked about a dish before ordering, instead of saying \\"the menu is self-explanatory\\" and offering only small details. \\nPrice-wise, I expected it to be rather expensive with having to buy small plates to share; however, for the price of some of the plates, there should be more food or it should be less expensive, especially since a lot of the produce came from there own garden. I think the sharing concept is great for 2-3 people but might be excessively expensive for more people than that. We had 4 dishes, a desert, and an alcoholic drink and hot tea for a total of around $100 after tip, for LUNCH,  not dinner. I was hungry about an hour later.\\nWe had four dishes: \\n1) the smoked carrots- awesome!! Who knew smoked carrots could taste so good. \\n2) the chicken liver mousse- I did not like this dish as a whole; however, the sliced peaches on top and the fresh basil tasted yummy. On a positive, my hubby enjoyed this dish.\\n3) a chilled beans and potato 'salad'. This was enjoyable and had a very umami flavor due to the sake bushi.\\n4) the beef cheek- this was both of our favorites. The cheek was so tender and flavorful.\\nWe also had a dessert for which o don't recall the name right now but it had sugar crisps, cookie, cream, and peaches.

I saw this place on the hot list and decided to make the trip to Oak Hill.  We got there just at the end of happy hour and it was pretty crowded but, still plenty of seats left.  The building and decor is really nice.  So we sit down and try to decide what to get.  They have a decent and fairly priced cocktail menu i believe my friend got a paloma and i got a Jeremiah Weed ice tea vodka mixed with green tea.  We shared the Red Chile fries and they were DELICIOUS!  They fries that appeared to be rubbed with red chiles and topped with Cotija cheese and scallions and come with a garlic aoli.  These things were beyond addictive!  It was more than enough for three to share.  Mellie ended up going with the ambitious but, if you knew her you'd understand, Chicken Fried Beef Rib!  That thing was a honker!  The textures were amazing.  Crispy on the outside nice and braised inside with the wonderful texture of beef ribs.  Miranda opted for the Country Club Salad that consisted of greens, achiote rubbed chicken, pears, figs, bleu cheese, \\"candied walnuts\\" and tossed with a champagne vinaigrette.  Our only complaint with the salad was the candied walnuts tasted more savory and spicy than candied.  It was still nice though!  I had the five cheese macaroni with achiote rubbed chicken breast.  It was good but, i was expecting something a little more.  Nothing's better than homemade mac and cheese but, i just thought it could've had an extra oomph!  We ended up getting two desserts to split.  They aren't on the menu but, we got the chocolate bomb and i can't recall the name but, it was caramelized bananas, homemade crust with graham crackers and pecans i think with some kind of cream.  The last one was very light, fresh and clean but, somehow didn't taste as what the server had explained to us.  Secondly, the chocolate bomb was explained to be a chocolate/white chocolate mousse that was covered in chocolate ganache.  It was great but, missing the supposed white chocolate interior.  The service was nice and attentive but, seemingly awkward and it wasn't just our table, most of the servers seemed a bit awkward.  It may be that it's only been open for three weeks but, still.

So we drove around the area and saw that the place that had been the Blue Nile said it was open, so we parked and headed in as we both love Ethiopian food. I had gone to the Blue Nile a fair bit in years past and enjoyed it. We just treated it as a random adventure since neither one of us had been there before.\\n\\nWe were so pleasantly surprised! The server was really friendly and gave us a lot of recommendations for food and drink. We arrived just in the nick of time for happy hour, and each got a mango mint mojito, and they were delicious. A short time later our sambusas arrived. They were bigger and far tastier than those served at the Blue Nile. A good sign! We hadn't finished them yet when our vegetarian combo platter came out with the injera. The only modification we requested was cheese, as it doesn't normally come with the vegetarian plate (just the meat plates). It was the same as I remembered from the Blue Nile, but perhaps even better. The food was so good, but we couldn't finish it and got the rest to go.\\n\\nI can see how the earlier reviewers had a poor experience, but I think they are working hard to correct issues as they arise. I wasn't sure if we spoke with the owner or manager, but she was very nice and interested in any feedback we were willing to give, either positive or negative. They really want to make this a great place. She lived in Thailand for many years, and they also now have Thai and other Asian cuisine menus in addition to the Ethiopian food. I will definitely go back and try their other offerings. They have a lot of great ideas for the restaurant, and I hope they get to bring them to fruition. Very friendly and nice people and good food.

It is never busy, which sometimes makes me worry, I don't want it to close, EVER. I love that when I am starving on a Sunday morning, I do not have to wait in line for an hour like so many brunch places in Portland.

I highly recommend the Smoked Salmon Eggs Benedict. \\nDinner is also fantastic. Each time I have gone there, I have ordered something different. Each time it has been delicious.

Fortunately, Baiyok has it covered. Located in a pink house smack in the middle of hooker ave (82nd Ave), it looks a little sketch from the outside but is really nice, clean, and comfortably elegant inside. The staff was very nice, and the menu is pretty large.\\n\\nI went for lunch, and between the two of us, ordered pad thai (the benchmark for any Thai place), spicy garlic w/ tofu, and tom kah soup. All was really good. The pad thai wasn't too sweet or fish saucy, and the squid we got with it was fresh and cooked just right. The spicy garlic was pretty basic: brown sauce with assorted veggies and tofu, but the server let me know that it's not inherently very spicy, so I ordered it \\"hot\\" and it was the perfect amount of nose-searing Scoville units. The tom kah soup was excellent - tangy, creamy, spicy, and a hint of sweet. I'll probably go back just for that.\\n\\nOverall, I'm really pleased with Baiyok. I tried them once years ago, and my experience wasn't the best, but they seemed to have worked it out.

Chef-owner Manita Bunnagitkarn acquiesces to American tastes on some levels but unleashes meals straight from Thailand. \\n\\nThe menu is carefully curated, and cheerily chalked on blackboard. It's done impermanent so that the menu can evolve as the restaurant takes hold. Don't let homey chalkboard calligraphy and Bunnagitkarn's diminutive stature fool you. We have serious transformational skills than will kick your foodie pretensions to the curb. \\n\\nAppetizers reveal Bunnagitkarn's true style without much concession to American expectations of Thai food. Corn Cake leads the current menu, a batter dipped and fried fritter of large sweet corn kernels is served with expected sweet chili fish sauce. The corn itself was admittedly a bit sticky to teeth if the batter was perfunctorily crisp and an attractive color. The second appetizer, Poh Piah [Popiah], is the real leadoff hitter that may be the best of the group. Inside a roll of rice flour crepe are finely julienned cucumber, lightly spiced tofu, egg, and bean sprout, all in perfect proportion, size and taste. The more careful eater could dispense with the accompanying sauce to fully appreciate the crepe, knife skills, and delicate seasoning. Bonus points to the chef for suggesting the addition of Thai Sausage, not on the menu, to make it \\"Thai-style\\". \\n\\nCha Yen's Roti, a classic transnational pan-risen flatbread that is very simple, yet eye-opening because it bests any Indo or Asian version, or other too heavy savory pancakes. This is an unremarkable looking, extremely thin, easily chewable, and tiny piece of bread cut into four quadrants. So what? It is also a fist banging delight of wheat flour that has the alchemy of making one more hungry. Matched up with a Massaman curry dip built around three millimeter sized cubed potatoes, time stood still while I photographed and marveled upon its construction. The portion size is absolutely correct given today's concern about carbohydrate consumption. Speaking of, portions do run small, but so do prices. The value here is on the side of charity. I could not break 30 dollars in multiple visits even if I had four dishes. \\n\\nMy experience with the Larb [minced meat salad], was customized for vegetarian leanings and not on the menu. Larb is the national dish of Laos, and is very common in Northern Thailand, and other regions too. Most vegetarians will accept tofu, nasty farm-raised shrimp, or stripping protein altogether forgiving a meat-hungry culture, but Bunnagitkarn's version is a triumphant four mixed mushrooms. It consists of Enoki, Oyster, Shiitake, and Button. The finest Larb salad I ever tried, meat or not. It is, surprise, an authentic version of Larb. What wonders what Bunnagitkarn could do with a Yum Taley? Crackely moments were added by way of toasted Rice Powder, Um Um Um!, fist pump again! My best vegetarian dish had in this year, it does contain fish sauce though. Surely they can accommodate for vegans. \\n\\nA destination dish, the soup-less egg noodle Sukothai [Kuaytiaw Sukhothai, shoutout to EATTV on C.H., http://chowhound.chow.com/topics/993076] is picture perfect. You'd never think noodles without broth would be worthwhile, but it's gorgeous. To see eight to ten ingredients perfectly cooked and compiled in a small bowl, never mind the artist level soft-boiled egg, well, it's like a really great mixtape with no wrong notes. \\n\\nThere's more than a few things left to have, such as the chef's reputed personal favorite, Grilled Squid, presented whole and redonkulously precision knifed. Let's cut to dessert because I wisely skipped over American-Thai classics for the most part. \\n\\nDid we not mention Ice Cream? It's a second coming of New England Ice Cream. If you like hard pack and novel flavors, this is your new thing. Bunnagitkarn makes Ice Cream, all kinds of original flavors, such as Strawberry-Sweet Basil, Coconut-Thai Basil, and Organic Green Tea. Just a few bites in size and modernly calibrated in sweetness. No pastry chef, yet they do an outstanding Puff Pastry Curry Shell app. Also, why?, when the Ice Cream is this good. If $2.50 for a diet-sized to-go container seems value compromised, it goes toe to toe with New England's best. \\n\\nVerdict: Multiple fist pumps, bumps, and barely contained banging on table. Sure, try Pok Pok in NYC, it's not going to be as nearly special."},{"name":"Deschutes Brewery Portland Public House","address":"210 NW 11th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Deschutes Brewery and Public House is perfect for all ages.

With that I expected a complimentary dessert or something \\"special\\" for the my sister (the birthday person).  As the desserts arrived my sister received a dessert with Happy Birthday in chocolate syrup and whip cream added. We were all wowed and waiting for all desserts to arrive before eating. After several minutes my brother in law still had not recieved his dessert, we then realized and confirmed with the server the \\"special\\" dessert given to my sister for her birthday was actually the dessert my brother in law had ordered for himself! lol Instead of a complimentary dessert, they took his dessert (without his knowledge or permission) wrote happy birthday in chocolate syrup and whipped cream and gave it to my sister...on purpose.  Why would any restaurant take a dessert ordered by one patron, ruin it with chocolate syrup and whip cream and pass it off as \\"special\\" for another patron? It was ridiculous to the point of total hilarity.\\n\\nI think it would have been fitting for the server to at least disclose of such an arrangement so an extra dessert  could have been ordered for my sister.

We did decide to share something else, new to both of us - Ding's Crispy Chicken Sandwich. While I am seriously sad that the Biltmore is no longer on the menu, this sandwich is a tasty (if fried and a little more indulgent) alternative. Quite good. Lightly crisped chicken (that same juicy breast that was used for the Biltmore) with baby Swiss, kale and tomato on the same good buns as Houston's burger. Note- like most or all of their sandwiches, it standardly comes with mayo so request off/on the side if you don't like it - though I don't usually enjoy it, there was a restrained amount on ours so it was fine. Fries as the side, of course (duh).\\n\\nPrices have definitely gone up - um, I remember when a burger was $11 and now it is $15 (as a reference the basic burger at Zinburger is $10 and $15 if you sub Kobe beef...) and the Club salad is $16.

It was like they cooked the eggs and veggies separate and kept them separate the entire time, and just kind of folded the eggs around the veggies after the fact..... and the veggies were cooked with a good amount of oil and it made the omelet a tad oily.

I kinda got bummed out, but my husband and I scored a babysitter so we went up for date night.  Let's start out with the hostess.  Extremely warm and inviting, and dang is she smart - the restaurant wasn't super busy so she suggested we go outside on the roof to enjoy a drink and the sunset.  So she scores brownie points from us - pointing out the awesome scenery out there, and bonus points for the restaurant - making some extra drink sales.  Hey, I'm a business woman too! I'd offer that girl a job if I knew her a name.\\nNow to the table.  Beautiful restaurant, and I was thrilled that they gave us a more private booth in the back with a great view.  Our server, Francis, was quick to greet us and made lots of great suggestions.  He made us feel at ease with the menu (everything sounded good), and did a great job just picking out stuff for us.  Plus he provided excellent conversation and I felt he went above and beyond the call of duty.  THE FOOD WAS SUPERB!  The wine Francis suggested was delish.

I went with a friend who raved about it, but when I tasted the chili, I thought that maybe they had made a bad batch.  I turned to my friend to find out what she thought, but she thought it was great.  I even tried hers to see if maybe I just had a bad bowl.  But no,  she just liked bad chili.  That was the last time I went until last week, when a friend had their birthday party there.  He called ahead to reserve the entire restaurant.  They called him the day before his birthday to tell him sorry, it can't be a private event, but we were welcome to come anyway.  So we did, but they must have thought we wouldn't, because they were not staffed to handle it.   There weren't enough tables, so people were standing around, and the waitstaff was pushing their way through, yelling \\"Get the f*** out of the way, f***ing morons!\\"  So these things happen, and it's understandable.  Many places even pride themselves on their lack of couth, and it adds to the attraction of the place as a source of entertainment.  I was certainly entertained.  \\n\\nThen things got a little out of hand.  One of our party, from out of town, was thoroughly disgusted with the experience.  They were seated at a dirty table which didn't get cleaned for 20 minutes, their food arrived 30 minutes after that, and then 15 minutes out of that they were bullied into giving up their table for a new group.  So they decided not to tip.  One woman at their table wasn't on board with that, so she tipped $5 - about a 60% tip for her own bill and 10% of the total table bill.  The waitress followed them outside and screamed at them - \\"thanks for the $5!\\" the tone was unmistakeably unfriendly, and it caused the tipper to begin crying.  Her friend went inside to inform a manager about the incident, and I was standing right there and heard the manager say \\"Can't you see we're f***ing busy?  What do you expect?  I would have done the same thing!\\"\\n\\nWow.\\n\\nLike I said, these things happen, and places have off nights.  If the food was worth it, I wouldn't be put off.  But the food is bad.  The burger patty was one of those frozen jobbies that's more bread than beef, and overcooked to boot.  The chili was dry and tasteless.  How do you make chili dry?  This is a mystery to me.

The waiter comes around with a wooden board of a variety of fresh baked bread: sourdough, olive bread, cranberry nut, and cheddar crisps. My favorite was the cheddar crisps which is basically like a gigantic fancy cheez-it for a lack of a better description. That thing was full of flavor, and I loved the crispiness. Also, I decided not to get the sourdough bread in fear of eating too many white carbs, but tried a bit of my friends' and IT WAS THE BEST sourdough bread I have ever put into my mouth.

Snoop Dogg) played by a ska quartet in a beer garden. If you, too, need to learn these of facts of life, Banger's is your place.\\n\\nWe came here for a #boozybrunch on a Sunday morning, and it was unsurprisingly packed. Luckily they have a huge outside area (where the ska band was playing) that allows a ton of people to be seated, so we didn't have to wait after getting drinks.\\n\\nThey have 100 beers on tap, but the drink to get is the Manmosa, which is served in a German stein and consists of an entire bottle of champagne and a few splashes of orange juice. Despite the unnecessarily gendered name, the Manmosa was delicious and cheap ($10), and just generally representative of the party feel of this place. My friend didn't get one because he \\"had one last week and got destroyed\\".\\n\\nThe highlight of the experience was this dude behind the bar, burly AF, 6'2\\" at least, with a lumberjack beard like I've never seen before. While pouring beers and champagne, he regaled us with such stories as how he came to Austin (\\"I stepped off the plane for a bachelor party in 2005 and within an hour my return ticket was sold\\"), why the system was slow to accept credit cards (\\"We're an 8 million dollar a year business, but our computer system was built in 1963, same time as the moon landing\\"), and why they serve the kind of alcohol that they do (\\"Vodka is for pansies. We serve beer\\").\\n\\nTexas law forbids the sale of alcohol without food before 12pm, which is why they had folks running in and out of the kitchen constantly carrying trays of baked biscuits, which we were informed we needed to buy along with the beer (\\"BISCUIT. BEER. 8 DOLLARS\\" said burlyman). The biscuits were delicious, and the food was amazing too, though to be quite honest with you I can't remember what I ate.\\n\\nBut I digress.

And usually I'm okay with a sinus-clearing challenge, but I couldn't taste the bratwurst at all for the mustard, so that was disappointing--a mouth-numbing meal with no real flavor.  The pretzel bun's flavor did stand out at the end of the meal.  That's some good bread.\\n\\nAlso had the green beans and bacon side--excellent, though if you have caloric issues, you'll want to stay away from the thick-cut chunks of bacon (they were tasty).  The beans were fresh and crunchy.  For taste, this was a better dish than my bratwurst.  \\n\\nTotal cost: somewhere in the neighborhood of $12.  Service was mediocre--hostess insisted on seating me farther from the stage, and I didn't hold my ground for that; server took an inordinate amount of time to bring me the check.

Finally, we ordered some mussels.  To be fair we had just gotten back from Nova Scotia so the mussels had too much sauce for our taste.  We prefer to steam them and a mild, light wine sauce but not too much.  This sauce was heavier.  Still a nice meal.  Our server Jeremy was nice and followed up at the right amount of time.

We decided to stop in here for dinner one night to eat on the patio. \\nWe ordered a glass of sangria each, the caprese salad to share, and a pizza. The sangria was terrible. It looked decent, but it was literally one of the worst cocktails either of us had ever tasted. I only ended up drinking a small portion of mine, and left the rest - a very first for me! We debated saying something to the server, but then our salad arrived. We took one look at it, and waited to get the server's attention when she came by next. The arugula on the salad was yellow and clearly old. The server came by to ask how everything was, and we told her we couldn't eat it. She took one look at it and agreed, apologized and said the salad would be taken off our check and a new one would be right up. Since we already caused a fuss with our salad, we felt bad and stayed quiet about our drinks. When the second salad arrived, we soon realized that it was the EXACT same salad as before, they had simply removed the bad arugula, replaced it with fresh, and doubled the balsamic drizzle. You could still see the old dressing on the plate and it looked like a sloppy mess. The bocconcini was leathery and old, the dressing fake, and the presentation a disaster. This was seriously one of the worst salads I have ever eaten. The server never came by to ask us how the second salad was, but a helper came to bring us our pizza.\\nPizza was ok.

Some vendor food prices are a little high, but they also give you a lot of food.  Split between two people, it's not bad at all, on the purse and the stomach.  You may even find you'll have room to head over to Jeni's for some creative ice cream flavors that you would never have thought of but are truly amazing.  And still, if you wish not to share, have no fear, for there are some decently priced places for single servings.  For instance, if you have no allergy to fish, I recommend the Fish Guys.  You can easily get an eight ounce bowl of hearty soup to warm the soul and fill the belly for under three dollars.  Even the 16 ounce, the next size up, is under five dollars.  \\n\\nLast but not least, some vendors do take credit card, but still be sure you take plenty of cash with you.\\n\\nAll I have to say now is, don't judge a book by its cover.  Give the North Market at least a few chances.  It's got a lot to choose from!"},{"name":"Ball Square Cafe","address":"708 Broadway","city":"Somerville","stars":"4.5","text":"We have breakfasted all over the area and I am a huge fan of BSC.

It was good but not the outstanding A-list restaurant I expected.  First the good: the grounds are beautiful and the wait staff is nice.  But...I expected more based on it's reputation.  First, it took almost 20 minutes to serve our wine -- they couldn't find the bottle we ordered.  They were very apologetic but for this caliber of restaurant I would have expected someone to at least let us know rather than leave us hanging for so long.  For my appetizer I ordered the oysters -- there were two types but they came slathered in some sauce on top so you couldn't taste the differences between the oysters, in fact you couldn't really taste the oysters at all.  For a seafood restaurant this is sort of bit criminal given how delicate a taste oysters have.  My entree was good - not innovative and earth shattering but a decent fish entree.  Dessert was a surprise -- a menu of about 10 items ALL chocolate except for 1 - strawberry ice cream.  For someone who is allergic to both chocolate and strawberries I was really surprised.  I've never seen a dessert menu with so little variation.  All in all, a decent meal but by no means worth the price.

What he got was ziti with cheese on it (not resembling in the least a baked ziti) with chicken parm (note not the kitchen's fault, the waitress rang in chicken parm).  I ordered the steak tips medium rare.  What I got was brown hammered meat.  I'd have sent them back but the waitress didn't come check on us for over 15 minutes.  When she finally came over and I expressed my displeasure she said she had been standing at the bar waiting for drinks (it wasn't that busy but even if it was and the bar is slow then she could have checked on her tables and gone back).  To her credit, she took the steak tips off the bill.

I based my review off of the quality of food and quality of service. \\n\\nFOOD: \\nThe meat selection is very limited, with only 1 cut of beef available, simply labeled \\"Beef.\\" Other hot pot buffets will let you select ribeye, sirloin, kobe, etc. My boyfriend doesn't eat pork, so the only meats we tried were beef and lamb. The beef quality was mediocre and got fattier as we ordered more plates. The last plate was literally 50% fat. Seafood costs extra, so we didn't try it. What I did like was that there was a selection of hot plates you could order for no extra cost including vegetable dumplings and buns, a variety of pancakes, sweet Chinese fried dough, etc. I enjoyed the fried red bean pancake. \\n\\nSERVICE: \\nThe service is painfully slow here. It took 30 minutes for a server to take our menu selections, and the restaurant was half empty at the time. Not only is it slow, you will only receive half of the items you order. We had to send the menu back 3 times in order to finally be told that they were out of the sweet sesame pancake. Also, I didn't realize until now, but we never even received the chicken breast we ordered. There were so many items we ordered that never came that we couldn't even keep up with them. Other than the slow service, the servers were polite and mostly attentive. They refilled our brother 2 or 3 times, but were a little slow with water. No biggie. \\n\\nOverall, my experience was enjoyable, but I doubt I will be back. I'd rather pay a little bit more and enjoy higher quality meats and seafood options, so I will stick with the hot pot buffet in Boston I go to when I'm in town."},{"name":"Deschutes Brewery Portland Public House","address":"210 NW 11th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I was pretty excited to see Deschutes had a brewpub in Portland.

I went last Saturday night for cocktails and a app.  \\n\\nI'm an optimist, so I'll start with the good:\\n\\nThere was a live jazz band playing at the perfect volume so that you could both listen in and still have a conversation with someone.  And the band was good.  The atmosphere was very classy.  There is a REALLY cool dining area built in an old bank vault that had mirrors on either side of the walls, creating a really cool infinity mirror effect.  The cocktail that I had was strong and yummy- I think it was called the Ginger Snap.  It had Aita Ginger, maple flavored whiskey, cream, cinnamon, etc.  It was pretty good- although I felt like it was more of a winter time drink.\\n\\nThe not-so-good:\\n\\nIt was pretty empty but I still had trouble getting decent attention from the bar.  After looking over the cocktail menu, I asked the bartender which cocktail seemed to be their most popular.  I know this is an annoying question, but they were so empty that I thought it wouldn't be an issue.  As I asked the question, 2 more guests entered the bar.  The bartender told me to wait a second, offered the new guests menus, then answered my question by saying the name of 2 cocktails.  Her answer took 10 seconds of her time.  She didn't need to break away to hand menus to the people next to me.  They could wait the 10 seconds.  Later that night, I asked another bar tender about the history of the building.  He handed me a piece of paper with a paragraph explaining.  I understand he must get asked that all the time, but 1) that means he should have plenty of experience explaining in a concise way by now; and 2) the bar was D-E-D, dead!  He could of told me in person and chatted me up.  All in all, I left feeling like I was a drain on the bar's time.\\n\\nAlso, the beer list was just okay.  The only beer that excited me was the Kentucky Bourbon Barrel.  Not that the list was bad- it just didn't wow me (and I know that sounds snobby- so I apologize).  I just expected more from the beer and cocktail list, from the look of the place.  \\n\\nAlso, also, I ordered the \\"Frog Legs and Alligator Bites\\" app.  The frog legs were tender and juicy on the inside, crisp on the outside.  The alligator was a little tough- but I'm guessing that that is just how alligator meat is.  Bravo for having alligator on the menu, btw.  Even though the meat was cooked well, the breading and dipping sauces did not impress.  Between my date and myself, we barely ate half the dish.  Again, it wasn't bad... it just didn't seem worth continuing on with it.\\n\\nI don't think I'll be going back- just because there are so many other, better places in the area.

The salad was good, simple Caesar salad and the lentil soup would have been really good if it didn't end up having some meat in it.  The description said it only had meat broth (which I was willing to look the other way on),but there was definitely actual meat in it so one bite was all I had.  That was disappointing!  I'm on the fence about the cheese bread.  It had some sort of creamy cheese under a layer of mozzarella on a sour dough type bread.

The sauce could be stronger and the pancake can be kind of bland but I've never found a restaurant that's been able to compete with my mom's scallion pancakes.  The standard Chinese foods like chicken lo mein or fried rice is what hits on the spot and it has just the right amount of grease.

It was a wonderful dish but when the waiter brought out my check, the dinner was not on the bill. I asked if it was a mistake but the waiter said with a smile, \\"Because we could not offer you anything on our menu the meal is on us.\\" Also, I took my parents there for their anniversary. I asked them to bring a small desert but they brought a huge beautiful cake and again...the cake was not on the bill. Again, the waiter said it was on us.

I don't know if there was a major change over happening, but a managerial type seemed to be training a new wait person.  I can cut them some slack for that.  We ordered and I got my ice tea but it was vile.  It was tainted with coffee.  I took it up to the counter and let them know.  The manager said he thought it tasted fine.  Um... no.  He told me that coffee and tea were made in the same containers so that is bound to happen.  Again, not a good answer.  There are people like me that are very sensitive to caffeine and can't have that contamination.  He said he'd take the tea off my bill.  Wow.  That would be the least I would expect.  I got a can of juice which of course I had to pay for.  \\n\\nOur food came and it was not good.  The biscuit was so hard I ended up eating around it.  The cheese was not melted at all.  The bacon was great, but it did not make up for the rest of the sandwich.  After the lack of customer service I had already experienced, I did not bother to bring up my complaints this time.

From the service, to the food, to the decor, the entire restaurant leaves you feeling comfortable and satisfied. This is definitely my favorite brunch place around Atlanta right now, and I always leave with a light feeling of bliss drifting through me. \\n\\nThe inside seems simple with its scattered white tables, and might even seem a bit crowded at first sight due to its smaller venue for its enormous popularity, but after being seated, the atmosphere around you starts to feel cozy, inviting, and quite homey. It's rustic and warm with the perfect blend of simplicity, and definitely captures that \\"morning brunch\\" ambience spot-on, especially on a sunny day! \\n\\nFood - brunch is WONDERFUL. Brunch is so wonderful that I tend to associate the idea of brunch with \\"joy cafe,\\" because I think this is where my love for brunch really sky-rocketed. I love how you get fresh, warm muffins/cinnamon rolls (or banana bread, because they sometimes run out) while you wait for your meal. I remember getting Eggs Benedict for my first meal, and while I was initially mildly disappointed at the smaller serving size in comparison to those of my friends (because I never had Eggs Benedict and I didn't know what it looked like), it was really filling and delicious! Of course, I ate mine. And then some of each of my friends' meals...as always. If you want to get Eggs Benedict but you're afraid that you'll still be hungry, you can always switch out the side of fruit for hash browns, which I did the second time around. Their hash browns are amazing! I would recommend their hashbrowns, Eggs Benedict, and omelettes. For the large serving size, I think everything's really reasonably-priced. Usually after a meal here, I'm good for nearly the entire day. No kidding. On a side note, I had lunch here once because they only serve brunch on the weekends. Lunch is also delicious, but the serving sizes are smaller and there was nothing too memorable about my lunch experience. I think if you're coming here for the first time, definitely come for brunch.\\n\\nThe service is stellar, and the sincerity of the workers adds to the atmosphere. I admire how the workers are able to maintain such an air of genuine care for your meal and whole experience even when it tends to get very crowded, with people in line outside and the place completely filled inside. I think there are only a few workers who regularly work there, and everyone is really kind and attentive! I've experienced maybe a few forgetful incidents here and there, but the place is rather small and workers pass by so often it's not so big of a deal. After all, they're usually really busy. \\n\\nThe main reason why I knocked off a star is the consistently long wait time that I have to prepare for every time I go. Even though I've waited from 20 minutes to nearly an hour, the food and experience is so worth it that I know I'll be coming back (and eventually finish the whole brunch menu, perhaps). I realize that the sometimes excessively-long wait time only testifies to their popularity and how good the food and experience is. After all, there's a reason a line of other hungry people are outside waiting with me...through rain, through sun, we've been through it all!"},{"name":"Banger's Sausage House & Beer Garden","address":"79 81 & 81.5 Rainey St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"It was so good but the wait was so long and we sat inside because outside was crazy but they are expanding so this will be the perfect place to go when it's finished !"},{"name":"Eclectic Kitchen","address":"4936 NE Fremont St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Went at 815 this am.

Even for my children who ordered the scrambled egg breakfast, they charged an up charge for substituting grits for potatoes without even telling us in advance. They did not even bring us a children's menu for our two children before we asked, assuming we would just order off of the adult menu if we did not ask. One person in our party did not eat pork, and they did not offer any substitution on the menu. I also thought that the she crab soup was watery and without a lot of substance. I will also say that the bacon was probably the worst we have ever eaten. We were at the end of the serving time, so maybe they gave us the leftover bacon.

We come to Atlanta fairly frequently for my wife to get her hair done or just to stock up at H-Mart with Korean goods we can't get at local Korean markets, and each time we try to find at least one new good place to add to our favorites. This time we are here for my wife's birthday, and while I was pretty in love with the idea of going to Pampas or a Brazilian BBQ place (haven't been to one since I lived in China... odd, I know!), she got to pick because it was her day. I was not thrilled with the menu when I saw it at first, mostly because I had dreams of whole herds being slaughtered for my culinary enjoyment, but once we arrived I warmed up to it.\\nThe service was excellent. Our waiter knew our names when we arrived due to our reservation, which was odd at first but definitely added an element we had never had before in being made to feel like they had been expecting us and were glad we were there. \\nThe waiter knew his menu well, not just for the food but for the drinks as well. I'm just delving into this world, so I'm open to and often in need of guidance. I told him what I like and he came up quickly with something he thought was similar but better. I didn't agree that it was better, but it was good and I enjoyed trying something I had no access to in Huntsville. \\nFor an appetizer, we had the smoked salmon on the potato cakes. I don't normally care much for smoked salmon, but this was prepared excellently and was absolutely delicious! The flavors balanced each other very well.\\nMy wife had the trout and I had the New York strip for our entrees. I was all on board with the rabbit until he mentioned the beef was a much larger portion, and since I had foregone lunch in anticipation of good food I went big. Next time I'm definitely getting the rabbit! Anyway, my steak was cooked perfectly to medium as requested. The mashed potatoes and broccoli rabe were great as well, and the bitter was a welcome taste to balance out the savory steak and creamy potatoes.\\nThe trout was not my favorite, but my wife thoroughly enjoyed it. We were both surprised that it was a red fish because we are accustomed to white fish trout, and when we discovered it was slightly undercooked we didn't even have to tell the waiter because he had noticed it when walking by. He apologized and sent it back, and for the first time ever in my dining experience it came back perfect. Normally they end up overcooked or ruined, but they did a great job saving this cut! We didn't ask for or get any discount for this error, but since it was remedied we were more than okay with the apology of the waiter.\\nFor dessert we listened to the waiter and got the cracker jack ice cream. I don't normally care for salty sweet, and I'm not particularly fond of cracker jack, but hearing the whole process explained from start to finish and knowing that it was all made in house I was convinced. It was one of the best desserts we've ever shared. This is of particular significance since my wife hates ice cream, but ate almost half of the ice cream in the cup! \\nAll in all, this is a great restaurant! The ambiance is very nice with low lighting and lots of decorative wrought iron work and, of course, the obligatory canoes and paddles that fit the name. It appeared that on one side of the restaurant there may have been a view of a creek of some sort, but due to my wife's love of booths we were too far away to see what was out there. It also appeared there was outdoor seating for those who love a fine misting of pollen for those lovely spring evenings, but even as indooraholics, it did look quite inviting."},{"name":"Mission on the Bay","address":"141 Humphrey St","city":"Swampscott","stars":"3.5","text":"We liked the old spot and this was our first visit to \\"MOB\\"; we found the new interior d√©cor to be fabulous, welcoming, comfortable, and casual.

The place is cute, small, and clean.\\n\\nEveryone in my party enjoyed their food.  One person had the trout - it was huge and it was filleted at the table.  That said, there were still bones in it, so be careful if you order the trout.  Personally, I'm not fancy like that - I would prefer my trout pre-filleted and de-boned.  But the trout was eaten up completely (and some bones were spit out during the process).  Another companion had the aged beef and really enjoyed it.  Everything was good - the bread, salads, calamari, gnocchi, and later, the desserts my companions had (apple fritter and cake).  \\n\\nI will note that this is a vegetarian friendly place.  I had seen rutabaga on the menu and was really craving it.  So when I arrived and they told me the rutabaga mash was not available, I implored the waiter to ask the chef to please make an exception for me.  Surely there was one more rutabaga in the house.  And there was.  Exhale.  The waiter came back and let me know that the chef had time to do one (and only one) order of rutabaga mash.  Apparently the chef knew of the rutabaga mash addictive qualities.  And the rutabaga mash, along with the kale I ate, was delicious.  My only disappointment is that the rutabaga was so good, I would have ordered one \\"to go\\" if I could have.  You probably should not do that at \\"nice\\" restaurants anyway.  So instead, I think I'll be heading to the grocery store to get a rutabaga to mash up on my own.\\n\\nI can't wait to return to Cakes & Ale."},{"name":"Collard Green Cafe","address":"2566 Shallowford Rd NE, # 112","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"I cook EXCELLENT collard greens, the kind made with salt pork cubes fried to render their fat so's the de-ribbed greens can be slowly sauteed in it.

I went there and purchased lunch and, despite the fact that I spent almost $20 on a sandwich, cookie and a can of soda, was denied a cup with ice for my soda. I am not an unreasonable person but I was absolutely and completely shocked at this refusal. I was told that they do not hand out \\"complementary cups\\". I then told her that the cup was for the soda that I purchased and was still refused. Actually take a moment to reread that. I hope that the complete and profound absurdity of that resonates with you as much as it did with me. I mean, I have a healthy respect for business owners who need to protect their profit margins. I mean I'm the guy who doesn't like to take more than two or three tiny spoonful samples of ice cream at Baskin-Robbins because I feel like I'm abusing the privilege. The only satisfaction I got from this exchange was when the guy behind me, who presumably was in line to make a purchase, witnessed this whole thing and audibly scoffed and said aloud \\"that is the most ridiculous s*** I have ever heard\\" and walked away, costing them a sale. I have to say I took a little bit of guilty satisfaction in that."},{"name":"Deschutes Brewery Portland Public House","address":"210 NW 11th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"The flights, allowing you to choose six sample-size glasses of almost any beer on tap, are the best I've seen at a brewery for cost and really getting a rounded tasting.

The strip where the restaurant is located and the interior are both visibly run down, but the food really sets apart Kathmandu as a hidden gem in this small town. If you're based in Decatur, it's not too far of a drive from where you are, so definitely come out for a visit. If you're further away, still come and try this food - THE CHICKEN...\\n\\nOne of my dear friends (a fellow Yelp elite) introduced me to Kathmandu for the first time last year and brought me to their lunch buffet. If you're comparing it to similar buffets like Cafe Bombay, you may be disappointed with the lack of variety, but I promise it's worth. There's about 8 options available at the line, with several curries, rice, naan and meats - sufficient for me. Not only is the price a steal (around $10 with tax/tip), but the food here is sooo good. The spicy chicken that they offer at the buffet is the dish I keep coming back to - and, unlike other places that say a dish is spicy when it really isn't, this chicken is actually quite spicy. The curries and naan are pretty on par to what I've tried in the past, but there's something about this restaurant that I really appreciate. Employees are always so friendly, the feeling of culture and diversity is so rich here, and the food never disappoints.

We like the sushi and how it is presented. We have had two good experiences in the past, but not tonight. We got there around 5:20pm and the restaurant was half full. By the time we left at 6:30pm the restaurant was pretty full. The fact the restaurant was full by the time we left does not excuse the way that our server treated us from beginning to end.   \\n\\nOur server was a mid 20's spiked hair guy who could care less that we were there. He approached us coldly with a \\"know what you would like to drink?\\" before we could even look at the menus. I asked for some time to look. We probably would have ordered some drinks had he not rushed us. He came back about a minute later \\"know what you would like?\\" disinterested and rushed attitude. We hurried to order just to get him to go away. \\n\\nHe plopped our food down after it sat on the sushi bar for what seemed like 10 minutes. The food comes on a large family style dish and you need side plates to put your rolls on. He brought one plate for my wife and not for me. My son's food already came on a plate. I needed more water a couple of minutes into eating our food and didn't get any until I was able to catch him as he was rushing away from the bill that he had plopped down at our table, after we were done eating. He rushed past our table many times along with other staff who could have seen the empty glass sitting on the edge of the table.\\n\\nWhen I go to restaurant and spend money I expect like anyone else, some level of attention from a server.
