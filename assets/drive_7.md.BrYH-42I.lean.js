Conveniently located at the intersection of Spring and 10th, it's not far from the Midtown nightlife found on Spring St. and Crescent Ave.  Plenty of club goers wind up here on a weekly basis, especially since the restaurant isn't far from the interstate.  This Checkers location has been here for many years, at least over a decade.\\n\\nThe store is open 24 hours on Friday and Saturday and from 10am to 6am on the other days.  There are two drive-thrus and two walk-up windows.  If you're driving solo, I do not recommend pulling up to the left drive-thru or you'll be stretching over your passenger seat to grab stuff through the window.\\n\\nCheckers serves its purpose as a drive-thru fast food restaurant.  The food is cheap and greasy, but it fills you up and gets you on your way.  There are about 10 umbrella-covered tables on the patio outside if you want to consume your junk food on-site.  I have to admit I've done it once, back in my college days at Tech.  If you don't mind the exhaust from cars waiting in line at the drive-thru, the road noise from busy 10th and Spring streets, and the panhandlers begging you for money, go for it.\\n\\nYou can get unhealthily filling combo meals for less than $6-7, tax included.  At this location, I've tried the Big Buford hamburger, chili cheese dog, and Checkers fries.  The Big Buford is a double patty cheeseburger with two slices of cheese, onion, lettuce, tomato, pickles, ketchup, and mayo.  It's a messy, sloppy burger and it doesn't taste half bad.  It's Checkers' answer to the Big Mac and Whopper.\\n\\nThe hot dogs aren't very big.  They actually remind me of The Varsity's hot dogs down the street.  The chili cheese dog is topped with smooth chili, shredded cheese, and chopped onion.  Also not bad.  I do think the \\"presentation\\" at Checkers, particularly this location, is really bad and the worst among fast food chains in general.  The burgers and hot dogs are wrapped tightly.  When you unwrap them, sauce and other ingredients are smushed everywhere, on everything, and the buns get prematurely soggy.\\n\\nThe fries are tasty, crispy, and loaded in sodium.  Looking at the oil-soaked wrappers and containers after finishing your meal really makes you feel good about yourself.\\n\\nService is OK.\\n\\nI can't say this Checkers is in the safest part of town.  Aside from all the sketchy traffic that flows through on foot and in-vehicle, there's a surface lot next door where one of my friends once had his car vandalized.

Food came fast. I was surprised at the ambiance- the wooden break apart chopsticks and paper napkins did not contribute to the elegance as I thought the overall aura would be- but it didn't necessarily bother me. The Indonesian fried rice was wayyyyy too spicy with the Siracha that is plopped on top of the bowl It literally burned both of our mouths and made the rest of the meal hard to taste. However- after scraping off the siracha I happen to love the mix of egg and pineapple flavors. The miso glazed carrots were on point- though I didn't know why there were so many scallions on the dish and I felt the carrots could have been cooked slightly longer. I really liked the chicken peanut salad with rice noodles- great flavors though a little watery/soupy at the bottom of the bowl. Spring rolls were average. Nothing special- but dipping sauce that came with them was great consistency and taste. Main course was salmon teriyaki- which was cooked well and flavored well- rice was a little average and the portion was small for the price but I would definitely order it again. Overall- not the dining experience I expected from all the rave reviews, but I am again a huge critic and a very healthy eater so my standards are often far from the norm!

I have never tried Ethiopian food before so this was my first time and maybe my last. I was not impressed at all. There was nothing special about the food, the lamb dish I ordered literally looked like something out of a Chinese takeout restaurant, it was very oily and although it was seasoned, the flavors did not wow me. The dish I ordered came out in less than 5 minutes lol, either the chef is psychic and knew I was coming and knew what I was going to order and timed the preparation or everything in the kitchen has been pre-prepared like a buffet. Along with the lamb dish, I ordered two sides, one side dish was a cabbage dish, which was soggy and overcooked and the other side dish was a collard green dish which also was overcooked and very soggy, it honestly looked and tasted like they were canned veggies (still suspicious). They brought out my lamb dish but didn't bring out the injera bread so my plate sat there getting cold for a few minutes before I flagged someone down to alert them of this situation. I will say that when I arrived to the restaurant there was a lot of people so maybe they are doing something right, maybe I just ordered the wrong dish, I will also say that they sat me at a table immediately, so good on that and the server was for the most part attentive but seemed like she would only come around when we obviously didn't need anything and didn't when we obviously did, weird.

I can now fully appreciate just how amazing this place is.\\n\\nThis shop isn't as specialized as some of the places in Japan tend to be, but it is a fairly small menu as compared to other places here. This is a good thing, as it allows them to focus on one thing and do it well.\\n\\nYou can order three types of broth, plus a new vegetarian option. They're all additions to their pork/chicken bone broth (except for the vegetarian, of course). The miso is my absolute favorite by a mile, although I haven't tried the shio yet. The shoyu has less depth of flavor, which isn't to say it is bad, but I'm never not in the mood for the heavier miso broth. The vegetarian broth is actually tasty, and better than many that I've tried. I've tasted really bland broths before that made me feel bad for my friends, but this wasn't one of them. However, there is no reason to order it if you're not a vegetarian.\\n\\nThe next most important thing is the chashu. This is their star topping and comes standard on any bowl of ramen, but I almost always order extra. It's delicious. I haven't had pork in ramen this good anywhere else. Counting the seared chashu, it's some of the best pork I've ever had.\\n\\nAs for the rest of the toppings, I always get the spicy meat. It's ground pork mixed with a chili paste. I've tried the killer spicy once and the name is spot-on. Reading other reviews, no one else seems to think it's that hot, so maybe I got a fluke bowl. I always go for super-spicy food and this was in the top 3 spiciest things I've eaten.\\n\\nThe soft-boiled egg isn't quite soft enough, always arriving only a little runny in the middle. The butter is good to pair with miso or the vegetarian broth to add an extra dimension of flavor.\\n\\nThe seared chashu is the only appetizer worth getting, and I 100% recommend it. It's unbelievably delicious. I'd say avoid the others. The gyoza is particularly unremarkable. I think the curry rice is only there for kids who find a bowl of ramen too intimidating. If you want good curry rice, go to Kal√© downtown. \\n\\nThey also offer their chashu and ground pork over rice, but I'm not sure why anyone would order that (and I've never seen it happen). I haven't ordered the dessert as you can just pop in to Uwajimaya after your meal and get the mochi ice cream for less.\\n\\nThe two shakers on the table are chili pepper and white pepper. I love adding the white pepper to my ramen, and it's especially good on the chashu.\\n\\nThe only criticism I can offer is a minor presentation complaint. Usually, the ramen is placed on my table shortly after adding the cold chashu and cold spicy meat (as they're both prepared ahead of time) and it just looks a bit unappetizing. Rarely, it gets there after those toppings have warmed up, and it's much more attractive (and the ramen isn't noticeably colder).\\n\\nThis place has waits at prime times (and especially long ones when Uwajimaya is hosting an event). You can order to-go, though. The longest wait I've heard is a half hour, which isn't bad with Uwajimaya and Kinokuniya through a doorway. \\n\\nThey have finally added seats for their counter, which was a notable omission for awhile. I tend to wait for a table rather than sitting at the big one as it's a bit more awkward than other communal seating for some reason.\\n\\nOh, and the beer goes pretty good with a bowl of ramen."},{"name":"FLIP burger boutique","address":"1587 Howell Mill Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Despite his wildly overrated reviews, I have to say that FLIP was pretty darn good.  We were seated quickly, had great and attentive service, and enjoyed several items (most to our liking).\\n\\nI thought the poboyger was the best, especially with the fried lemon on top.  My husband found the cod to be his favorite.  We also tried the pork belly cheeseburger, which was to our liking (but I would have liked the pork belly to be a little more crisp).  My favorite side was the fried rutabega, which remained nice and crunchy and went very well with the goat cheese foam.\\n\\nThe burnt marshmallow shake was amazing.

Their pastries are pretty good, many of which are sourced from 3 Little Figs in Somerville.

Typical Boston fare I guess, but MEM and Tazo are wonderful so that's not a bad thing.\\n\\nNow here's why Render really stands out:\\n\\nFirst of all, they use wonderful coffee. The owner of Render used to be the manager of Pavement and Espresso Royale. Naturally, Render uses Counter Culture coffee beans, but somehow they really showcase the best of Counter Culture here, and they give me a newfound appreciation for the North Carolina-based roaster that no other coffeehouse in the area has done. This is truly exceptional coffee.\\n\\nSecond of all, the service is faaaaabulous. Probably the best service I've ever received in a cafe. You might not ever guess that Chuck (Render's star barista, who used to work at The Thinking Cup when it first opened) is the winner of Boston's first Latte Art Throwdown-- or maybe you would, if he pours you some really pretty latte art, but I digress. He is one of the least pretentious, most sincere baristas to ever serve me coffee. Heck, the entire staff rocks. The service I've gotten here is personable, punctual, and knowledgeable without being remotely pretentious-- a very very rare combination, and I will admit that even some coffeeshops I frequent much more than Render can't quite pull that off. Anywhere else I can be chatting with some lovely guy behind the counter who doesn't know a thing about coffee, or I can go to some stuffy coffeeshop where all the knowledgeable baristas talk down to you because you're some plebeian something or other.

All shortening frostings develop a crust after frosting the cupcake and sitting for a while.  Then there is the mouth feel, greasy greasy greasy.

I'm typically not very adventurous and was going to just get the Flip burger, but I thought what the hell and went with the breakfast burger. I found it to be very tasty. I don't know if it was the sausage gravy or the burger itself, but there was a nice spice that lingered on your palate for a while. This was offset by the sweetness of the maple foam. Very juicy.The consistancy was a bit looser than a typical beef burger, but the patty didn't fall apart. Messy, but really good. \\n\\nFries - really good fries. Nice and crispy on the outside. I didn't find them overly greasy (they are fries though) \\n\\nSweet potato tots - I'm not sure how I feel about these. My first one I found a bit bland, but actually likes them a bit better after they cooled off a bit. Definitely could have used a dash of salt, but none was to be found on the bar. The crispier ones were better. The texture on the inside was not what I expected (neither good nor bad)\\n\\nKrispy Kreme Shake - very good, very sweet. I think a half sized one would have been sufficient. It is just like drinking a doughnut\\n\\nWhile not a cheap meal, I certainly found my experience enjoyable.

The first time I went was on the morning of my worst hangover ever, which had been induced in the course of showcase-hopping the night before.  I'm generally pretty hangover-proof, so I was unsure of how to handle the experience, and actually argued with my friends who prescribed greasy food as a cure.  I couldn't imagine that that would help my stomach.  But I consented to going to El Chilito anyway, and dutifully ordered a couple of breakfast tacos.  Lo and behold, they actually make me feel about 70% better, and I was actually able to enjoy the rest of my day.\\n\\nThat was a couple of years ago now, but I remember it well.  So yesterday when my friend wanted to pick up some tacos to eat while we waited in line for the NPR day show, I was happy to oblige.  She suggested that we call in our orders.  She ordered 2 breakfast tacos (Charlie's Special and Migas) and a fruit cup, and I ordered a Picadillo burrito with no lettuce plus guacamole.  Our orders were ready when we got there and we didn't even have to wait in line to get them.  \\n\\nMy burrito was reasonably easy to eat in line.  Ingredients were very tasty and seemed to be in perfect proportion.  I also really enjoyed their salsa, which is an alarming blackish color but is actually wonderfully fresh-tasting.  My friend liked her tacos too.  I ate some of the fruit from her fruit cup ... it was mostly melon bits which I don't like, but there were also grapes, strawberries, and pieces of pineapple, so I concentrated on those.\\n\\nOverall, I think this place is a really great value, and seems to fill a needed niche (a very specific one in my case, but that's fine).  Maybe I won't wait until next SXSW to go back."},{"name":"Yalla","address":"99 Krog St NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Got the Todd's shawarma special and everything was amazing.

People are down on you all the time as NOT being authentic. This is not German food. Well, I beg their pardon...but you are very German food. \\n\\nHaving been to Germany, I am no authority, but I do know that there are many types of German restaurants that offer different types of German food. And you are every bit as authentic as that bar in Dusseldorf along the Rhine selling pig's knuckles with kraut......Yes Folks, it's not German FINE dining but it is German pub grub. \\n\\nIt's a great place for a work lunch or when you need to kick back for a brew or two. Schmidt's specialty brews are tasty and Warsteineron tap is like being in the old country. \\n\\nI personally can not imagine eating here without ordering the buffet. It is your best value and it is the best way to eat what they do best. The SAUSAGE. Founded as a meat packer, this place knows its bratwurst, knockwurst and its bahama mama spicy sausages. They are quality meat and delicious. Plus you can buy some bulk and take them home if you want to grill some or if you want to make your own sausage dishes. \\n\\nThe next best thing on the buffet is the Potato Soup. Always available, they will serve you a cup with the buffet even if it's not the \\"featured\\" soup on the buffet. Velvety and smooth - just like Oma (Grandma) made...make it even better with some real bacon and cheddar cheese from the salad bar. \\n\\nOther things on the buffet are good as well - mac and cheese is better than any bbq joint's mac and cheese I've eaten. The red cabbage may be canned but is enhanced with spices and Jonathan apples. The kraut is canned, yet spiked with caraway in every bite and is appropriately sour to the tongue, not watered down. The German Potato Salad is home made and the German Sweet Kraut on the salad bar is a classic sweet Sauerkraut Salad. Corned beef and cabbage on the buffet is always freshly made. Not authentic? Well, I'd say there are plenty of restaurants in Germany that use canned, commercially processed kraut and cabbage......Have you not seen the jars and cans in the German section of your grocer or World Market? \\n\\nThe desserts are ok. The cream puffs are raved about - I personally avoid them because of the use of some unknown whipped topping\\" kind of filling. I'd prefer pastry cream. The German Chocolate cake appears authentic - meaning made with German's brand Sweet Chocolate since  the authentic dessert of the country would probably be a Black Forrest Cake with real whipped cream. \\n\\nSo anyway, I am a fan. People who belittle its authenticity have likely never visited the country to appreciate the bar/pub side of Germany, which is a shame because the German's know their bier and their sausage."},{"name":"Whiskey's Food & Spirits","address":"885 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"2.5","text":"I have a friend that happens to be madly in love with this place so I find myself here pretty often when she's in town.

They also serve tacos, burritos, quesadillas, and huaraches (similar to sopes) along with desserts like flan.\\n\\nThe restaurants are nicer than your typical authentic Mexican taqueria (e.g. El Taco Veloz, Tacos La Villa, Taco T).  They actually have a formal build-out that is Mexican-themed.  The semi-open kitchen features a huge spit in the same vein as a Greek gyro spit or a Middle Eastern shawarma spit.  On Las Tortas Locas' spit is al pastor meat (pork).\\n\\nAtmosphere is casual and clientele is mostly Hispanic.\\n\\nTortas are the specialty and range in price from $5-6 each.  There are over 20 tortas (!) to choose from.  Ingredients run the gamut from white cheese to head cheese.  Tacos are $2 each and can be filled with any one of a half dozen types of meat.  Think more of the basic stuff like beef barbacoa and chorizo sausage.  They do have lengua (tongue), but no tripe.  Burritos, quesadillas, and huaraches are about $5 each.  Lunch combos are available as well.\\n\\nI've tried the Pastor con Queso ($5.50) and it was delicious.  The tortas are big.  One torta should suffice as a meal.  The Pastor con Queso contained al pastor meat (marinated roast pork off the spit) with red sauce, cheese, tomatoes, jalapenos, lettuce, onion, and avocado.\\n\\nThe best thing about the sandwich: everything.  All of the ingredients were fresh and flavorful, from the meat to the bread to the veggies.  All sandwiches are made-to-order so that's a plus.  The meat was a little fatty, but that's also one reason why it tasted so good.  Tender and savory.  The bread was soft and perfectly toasted.  It held the large sandwich together well.  The slices of avocado just made the sandwich that much sweeter.\\n\\nThe tacos and burritos looked very good.  I'll probably try their tacos next time.

The people behind the counter messed up my order FOUR times. I ordered the fried chicken and waffle sandwich off the iPad, but they first dish presented to me was just an empty waffle. I brought it back and they called my name much later only to give me the waffle with a few pieces of chicken on it (not what I ordered). Finally, on the third try they gave me the correct fried chicken waffle sandwich. At this time, the girl offered me a free matcha latte (which turned out to be pretty good, although they do not offer skim milk). My friend and I started taking photos of our food and when we were finally ready to eat, she noticed a long black hair stuck in the food. This is disgusting. Its one thing to have bad service and mess up someone's order. Its another thing to have a sanitation issue! After this incident, they remade our food (a 4th time) and refunded my money. The sandwich turned out to be only ok and definitely not worth the hassle. The chicken was yummy, but the waffle was soggy.\\n\\nI just don't understand why it took so many tries to get one small order correct, Please train your employees to wear a hair net and read orders more carefully.

There is an array of entertainment available - bowling, darts, ping pong, basketball, skee ball, shuffleboard, etc. It is a great place to grab drinks and chill with friends. However, if you want to bowl during peak hours, be prepared to wait. They don't take reservations.\\n\\nFood, drinks, and ambiance are all great, but there are two things I don't like about The Painted Pin - parking and seating. \\n\\nParking - There are a few free 2-hour street parking is available on Miami Circle, but if you're visiting during peak hours, they probably won't be free. Your only remaining options are valet or parking at the Buckhead Crossing Shopping Center and walking to Painted Pin (for the cheap-o's like me). If you park in the nearby lots, there is a high chance that your car will get booted. Up to you on whether you want to take the risk.\\n\\nSeating - Seating is also difficult during peak hours. It is first-come first-served, so you might need to stake out and wait for a group to leave their table. Otherwise, you can stand around the bar or anywhere around the venue. If you only plan to drink, it's not really a problem.\\n\\nNow that I've complained, I'll get onto the good parts - food and drink. I have tried a good number of menu items at The Painted Pin. Below is the list of items that I recall (in order of tastiness):\\n \\nDrink: They have a strong beer, wine and cocktail menu, but I prefer cocktails.\\n- Bee's Knees: This is one of my favorite cocktails in general. Very light and not too sweet. Highly recommend it to anyone who likes gin and tea.\\n- Bourbon Punch (bowl): The bowl wasn't as big as we expected. I think maybe 2 or 3 people finished it off within minutes. It did taste great though. Slightly sweeter and stronger than the Bee's Knees.\\n- Old Fashioned: Standard old fashioned. No praises and no complaints.\\n\\nFood: They offer a lot of small plates that can be shared by a group. Some items are great and some are meh. Any of their pizzas are a safe choice.\\n- Buckhead Betty Pizza: My favorite pizza at The Painted Pin. Topped with spinach, garlic, mushrooms, ricotta, and mozzarella, it is delicious! I always steer toward \\"supreme\\" pizzas, and this one has a good array of veggie toppings (also accommodates the vegetarians in your group).\\n- Margherita Pizza: Don't underestimate the simple margherita pizza. Their version has some chili flakes on top to add a small kick. My (large) group destroyed about 3 of these pizzas.\\n- The Pin Burger: Basically an overpriced Big Mac. It clearly tastes like a Big Mac, which isn't necessarily a bad thing (I love Big Macs). If you want a burger and don't have the patience to grab one at McDonald's later in the day, order this to satisfy your cravings.\\n- Pin Fries, House Pretzel Bites, & Hummus: All pretty standard and A-OK. Good plates to share with a group.\\n- Fried Calamari Pizza: My least favorite pizza. I love calamari, and I love pizza, but I don't think I like pizza with calamari. Basically just calamari thrown on top of a pizza. Seems unnecessary. It doesn't really add anything. It's not bad, but it's not that great either.\\n- Blackened Mahi Tacos: Decent fish tacos with enough flavor, but not the best fish tacos. Good enough for a non-Mexican / non-Tex/Mex restaurant.\\n- Fried Chicken Tacos: Very meh. The apples are a nice touch, but the taco felt very dry (mostly from the fried chicken). I think better chicken would improve the quality of these tacos.\\n- TPP Sliders: Basically sliders stacked with pimento cheese. I found them too salty with not enough bacon bits. If you love pimento cheese, go for it. Otherwise, I recommend passing.\\n- Waffle Dogs: Mini dogs wrapped in waffle. That's great in all, but their sauce is terrible. The sauce is savory (and not a maple syrup as one might expect). Very bad choice in the accompanying sauce. It might otherwise be okay."},{"name":"Wilfs Restaurant & Bar","address":"800 NW 6th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"We were looking for late evening entertainment and found it at Wilfs.

Whether its all the great Boxing posters on the walls, the great bar, the staff who've been there for years or the people who just keep coming back year after year, there is a lot to what makes Santarpio's great. \\n\\nWith that being said, Santarpio's is one of those great Boston places, you need to visit at least once. Truly one of the crown jewels of Eastie. \\n\\nAs for for the pizza, I have to say I only think that its decent, which is why I'm not giving it five stars. Most of the time it comes out of the oven so hot, that if you're not careful, you'll burn the roof of your mouth right off. Its also often very soupy, in that if you pick it up right away, all the cheese and toppings slide right off. So what this all means is that once your pizza arrives you often have to wait for a few minutes for it to cool and settle before digging it. Ultimately, the pizza is great, but this is its one flaw in my opinion. \\n\\nAdditionally, its also a great place to take someone from out of town and could even make for an interesting date spot as well."},{"name":"Hopdoddy Burger Bar","address":"1400 S Congress Ave, Ste A190","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I got the prime burger-amazing.

With rich miso broth, stewed for hours on end, it is what I come to expect of a ramen restaurant. The noodles are al dente with a nice chewy texture. The char-sui falls apart and doesn't have an abundance of fat attached - which is good. A bit on the dry side, it does well to sit in the soup base until juices help reconstitute it. A knock I have is that the curry was served lukewarm, when it should be piping hot, AND that the meat with the curry is no other than the only meat option possible. If you're going to go through the trouble of having something additional on the menu, switch it up a little. The lack of variance here reduces the replay value significantly.

Walking in, I was immediately warmly greeted and seated in a nice corner table near the front. The methodology for eating at a Brazilian steakhouse was explained to me (really, this was the first time for me at this sort of restaurant) and then I was off to the races. Salads are available at the salad bar, where they have a very nice cucumber and tomato relish to put on top of the regular items. I went back to the salad bar two more times while here to get more salad, as it really was a nice complement to the protein.\\n\\nDid I say protein? Well, get ready for it, because it comes at your on a very regular basis. Sirloin, top sirloin, rounds of steak and chicken with bacon wrapped around them, and even garlic rolls come around on the spit to be placed on your plate. All of them excellent. Some have mentioned the pineapple skewer, and it is as good as it sounds... they take an entire pineapple, skewer it, cover the outside with cinnamon sugar, then roast it until it is heated through the sugar has caramelized on the outside, then serve it to you... wonderful!\\n\\nHowever, my favorite skewer of the night had to be the skirt steak. I know I have seen reviews on here about the skirt steak being dry and not all that appealing. Well, that is the nature of skirt steak... but I grew up on it being a cheap cut of meat that the entire family could enjoy, and that is what I did here... and it was wonderful! They got the cut just right, and I could have sat there all night eating nothing but skirt steak.\\n\\nAll this, and the cost was half what I paid at a steakhouse in my hotel the night before.

Given where they are located, the mainstay of their business seems to be the lunchtime crowd from the area offices, and if you happen to come here around noon on a weekday you'll experience that yourself.  It can get a little busy inside, as the inside is a little small, but  with that being said, these guys are pros at moving people through at a fast pace, and I've never experienced too much of a wait.\\n\\nDuring the busiest of times, the crowd-flow can get a little jumbled up, as there is a separate line for ordering pre-made pizza slices.  The problem is that due to the shape of the room/counter, the lines have to run parallel to the counter instead of approaching and there's no way to separate them.  The pizza ordering spot is past the part of the counter where you order sandwiches, so people waiting there for their sandwiches can sometimes block a line for pizza or get mixed up in it so you don't know who is who is waiting, who is going to pay, and if you might be inadvertently cutting someone in line.  My advice is go a little bit before or after the lunch rush to make your purchase that much easier.\\n\\nI have also noticed that within the last few months the pizza slices seem to be getting somewhat smaller and lighter.  It might be my imagination (or maybe I'm turning into a giant), but I've been eating their pizza on a regular basis for about two years so I'm fairly confident that my judgment is accurate.\\n\\nBottom line: If you want a fast and reliable lunch, you will find it at Nunzio's, but there are plenty other places around that might take a little more time where you'll get a little bit more (literally) for your money."},{"name":"Eddie V's Prime Seafood","address":"9400 B Arboretum Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I was taken to Eddie V's for the first time on my birthday near the end of November and it was fantastic!

We ordered the crab cake for an appetizer and it was super meaty yet light. For one of our entrees, we ordered their special of the night, scallops in a blueberry sauce (might sound a little off, but this sauce was the perfect compliment to the scallops, more buttery-rich than sweet). For our other entree we ordered the filet mignon and lobster tail, both were perfectly cooked and just melted in your mouth. Our sides were the lemony broccolini and the twice baked potatoes. The broccolini was tender and flavorful and most of the potato was very creamy. The only food gripe for the whole evening was the bottom quarter of so of the potato didn't seem to be as well cooked and we couldn't scrape it out to enjoy it; it seemed under-done. \\n\\nAll in all, it was pricey (why it was a special occasion restaurant) but wonderful service, food, and incredible attention to detail."},{"name":"Bukhara Indian Bistro","address":"3698 Washington St","city":"Jamaica Plain","stars":"3.5","text":"I've been here for lunch buffet and for dinner, and both experiences have been very good... dare I say A-OK, as my 3-star review says?

I chose the Tiramisu and the Passion Fruit + Cocoa Nib, while the wife chose our friends' recommendation, the Hard Apple Cider Fritter and the Raspberry Rosemary Buttermilk.\\n\\nAll of the donuts were winners!  Well, I wasn't in love with my Tiramisu donut, as it was a little bland and a little too creamy.  The Hard Apple Cider Fritter, on the other hand, was full of flavor  crispy/chewy/soft.  The remaining donuts were flavor bombs and just the right texture.  Not super fluffy like a Krispy Kreme, it was more substantial in a good way and not at all greasy.  The raspberry tasted intensely like fresh raspberry and thyme, while the passion fruit had a strong passion fruit flavor, a slight spiciness and a slight crunch/bitterness of cocoa nibs.

Being Indian and the son of an amazing cook, my standards for Indian food are quite high. And until recently (I'd say the last year or so), The Clay Pit has always lived up to those standards. However, last week I went with my family to celebrate my birthday, and except for the service which was friendly and attentive, everything else fell short. On the cleanliness front, my wife complained of a very messy bathroom that stank of raw sewage, and the table and chairs were covered with a stickiness that required a major scrub down to get clean. Our food was subpar as well. We ordered the vegetable pakora and tandoori vegetables as appetizers. The pakora were over-breaded and cold, the tandoori vegetables consisted mainly of onions and overcooked broccoli. For entrees, we had a rice puloa in which the rice was severely overcooked (mushy to the touch), a malai kofta where the kofta were incredibly dry and dense, and a saag paneer where the saag was clearly old as it was an oxidized dark green / brownish color -- incredibly unappetizing for cooked spinach! The long and the short of the food is that 3 members of our dining party suffered from stomach illness after the dinner!!

I already knew I'd be getting the vegetable noodles, a brisket noodle dish for the boyfriend, and a sushi plate. Intrigued as I was to try the marinated soft boiled egg, I couldn't justify 3.00 for one egg. Maybe next time. What's great about the fresh made noodles is that you can choose from a variety of types. I opted for the vermicelli, but next time I think I'd go for the fettuccine (which my boyfriend said were the best he'd ever had).  I added chili oil to my noodles as the menu recommends, and I enjoyed the noodles, chili, spinach, tofu and peppers, but being the only vegetarian noodle dish it is just not something I'd come back for. I thought it was strange that they brought out one cup of miso soup. Did only one dish come with soup for some reason? Were we supposed to share? It was pretty tasty, but to be honest, I rarely find miso soup outstanding.\\n\\nThe sushi on the other hand... SO GOOD. The plate we ordered had sashimi of tuna, salmon, and.. something else along with an eel roll of some sort. The eel roll was amazing, although I think that was the first time I'd ever had eel.

I love Odd Duck but I am a huge coward when it comes to cold weather, so I haven't been all winter.\\n\\nBarley Swine isn't too hard to find, and is located between Horseshoe Lounge and La Feria (which has a HUGE neon sign). We had called ahead and let them know a group of six would be coming. We got there at 9 p.m. on a Wednesday and the (admittedly small) place was full- but Jason, the manager, was gracious and accommodating. \\n\\nWe were seated about 45 minutes later. Normally I would be a little upset about a long wait late on a weeknight, but the place just opened, and I took it to be a good sign. Our waitress said the restaurant had run out of food the previous night, on a Tuesday. Be careful of what time you go! I would avoid weekends if at all possible, and maybe try to go earlier in the evening.\\n\\nLike I said, the place is small, with bar seating and a handful of long, communal-style tables. The atmosphere is great- a calm, controlled energy that made me feel right at home.\\n\\nThe beer list was superb- I am a little nutso about beer and they had brewers and beers I hadn't tried before. Excellent selection that seemed carefully chosen. I had the Oskar Blues Old Chub Scotch Ale and it was incredibly smooth, with a lovely malty flavor.\\n\\nThe food- what can I say? It's very reminiscent in style to what is served at Odd Duck. I am not sure what to call it- rustic American?- but I know that it is my favorite type of food.\\n\\nThe seating is naturally conducive to family-style eating, so our group of six ordered quite a bit and everyone tried a bit of everything. \\n\\nSome of what we ordered: \\nFried brussels sprouts - We ended up getting THREE orders of this. The outside skins become light and crispy and the middle retains a lovely chewiness, just fantastic\\n\\nSalmon and beet - This was supposed to be served with steelhead, but they ran out. The waitress said they substituted salmon purposefully, for its similar taste, not just because they had it lying around. It seems like such an odd combination but it was an amazing pop of flavor. The guy who ordered it said that it was the \\"best bite of food\\" he had ever had in his life.\\n\\nPig foot with soft boiled egg - You don't actually get a cloven hoof on your plate. It is fried, and the texture is similar to schitzel. Definitely worth trying.\\n\\nScallops and duck cracklins - Delicious, tangy sauce, and the scallops had that lovely salty meaty taste and texture. These are the real deal, not the water-injected puddles of mush other places serve.\\n\\nFoie gras, duck sausage and barley - Incredible, amazing, wonderful, every great term rolled into one.

The drunken chicken was a bit of a let down, no white meat but in terms of taste it was alright. To end the meal, we were presented with a deep  fried pumpkin pastry with red bean filling, awesome."},{"name":"Xian Sushi and Noodle","address":"1801 E 51st St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"This place is a disappointment and it has so much potential. The only redeeming quality of this place are the hand pulled noodles which are pretty darn good in terms of texture. I've been here three times and have tried a variety of sushi, Dan Dan noodles, and beef noodle soup. The sushi was mediocre at best (rice was dry and hard). The Dan Dan noodles are not flavored Sichuan style AT ALL like they claim and doesn't even have any Sichuan peppercorns which is the signature spice. The beef they use for both noodle dishes is a old, chewy, and completely inedible. After three times I will have to say I will not be coming back or bringing my friends because I don't want to perpetuate the idea that this place serves authentic Chinese food. This place tries to be too much and it should just stick to making quality noodle soup or sushi."},{"name":"Veracruz All Natural","address":"2505 Webberville Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I have not had a breakfast taco prior to this visit and Veracruz has probably ruined the ability for ANY other breakfast taco to compare.

We got the seafood and chicken paella, garlic shrimp, kobe empanadas, lobster croquettes and ceviche. Ceviche was authentic, tastes like something I would get in Mexico. But everything tasted plain and are you kidding me with the lobster croquettes?! It's a cheese ball with tiny specs of lobster in. For the grand finale - one hour later after being seated - our server apologetically tells us the chef made a seafood paella instead of seafood and chicken. Fine. But for some odd reason, it takes him over ten minutes to bring it out. I thought the chef already made it? When the paella finally comes to our table - it's a big letdown. For $35, I was not impressed. Paella should be moist but this was extremely wet and cold. We ate most of the seafood but the rice was inedible. \\n\\nYes, it was a busy night but it was also our first time there and the experience was the total opposite of what we expected.

They serve dim sum here and next door is an authentic Hong Kong style noodle shop. I came here on Saturday after some epic and inexperienced fails at nearby Kirin. Wait for a party of one wasn't too bad - probably fifteen minutes max. \\n\\nI sat down and got the following dishes:  pork siu mai, durian pastry puffs, XO sauce fried radish cake, and a pork liver rice roll. Oops I might have overordered but I was also starving!  The menu here is very extensive and if I had come with a large party there would have been more I'd want to try!\\n\\nThe siu mai came out first. It had fish roe on top. This wasn't the cheap kind. I could taste them sort of pop and crunch in my mouth. The actual meat of the siu mai was very on point. The pork wasn't overly fatty, which is a problem at many dim sum places. It was slightly elastic, which is the telltale sign of a good dim sum chef. All in all I was pretty impressed. \\n\\nThe rice roll came out next. I wish here that the liver had been cut into thinner pieces. It also wasn't the best liver I've had and there was nothing special about the actual rice roll itself. Nothing stood out about this dish unfortunately. \\n\\nWhat was cool about the XO sauce radish cake is that it came out in an edible nest. Light, airy, and flaky - it definitely made the dish more fun. The actual radish cake was also pretty good and the XO sauce packed a slight kick. \\n\\nFinally while not everyone is a fan of durian, I am!  I ended the meal with three rather small sized durian puff pastries. They were also decent. What I noticed here is that all of the fried dishes I had didn't taste very heavy or oily. Sure, you can't get away from frying something without any oil, but compared to other dim sum joints I had in CA, this tasted relatively light. \\n\\nService: lots of men walking around eager to help you. The food comes out carried by lots of women. With all the people running around, you rarely have to flag someone down and the place seems surprisingly not so chaotic. \\n\\nBottom line: perhaps not on the same uniqueness as Kirin, but Neptune offers decent dim sum and an expansive menu."},{"name":"Hi Hat Public House","address":"2121 E 6th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I was wanting some brunch food on Saturday afternoon during SXSW, but I didn't want to deal with massive crowds of people.

I will keep this one brief but must note that the hospitality & customer service was superior even during such a busy dinner hour.  The manager was extremely polite & even checked with us after the meal.  But the highlight, outside of the food of course, was our waitress Kelsey!  She was so knowledgeable about the menu & shared a passion for each dish she described.  You could really tell that she loved the food & her job.  This time I tried the Shrimp Burger & I was pleasantly surprised that the  burger managed to have a large amount of chunks of shrimp in a patty that doesn't crumble or lack in flavor.   It had just the right amount of smoky flavor but wasn't too overpowering.  Kudos to the chef(s) for making this a great option for fish lovers.  Now on to the milkshakes...I was pleasantly surprised to find out that you could add liquor to some of the shakes.  That allowed me to save a few bucks by not having to purchase a cocktail and shake.  The fact that I could combine them was a great perk.  I had the Mocha Milkshake with Patron XO, which gave an added kick.  I added the candied pecans to mine, which I was happy to hear that they were grown in a former chef's grandmother's backyard.  That added another nice touch to this quaint restaurant feel.  My date ordered the Nutella Milkshake with Roasted Marshmellow's with a Khalua Liqueur and it was my favorite out of the two.  Kelsey said that she preferred it over any other Milkshake with liquor because the liqueur blends more smoothly and I would have to agree with her.  Just another good example of her knowledge of the menu...she's just that passionate about the food and drinks served at the restaurant.  All in all, I must say that this place is becoming my go to in Atlanta.  I'm not a big burger/sandwich eater but Flip pulls at my heartstrings every single time I dine there.

Either the concept of this place is utterly lost on us or it just isn't very good.  Naturally, I suspect the latter.\\nThe ordering process is similar to Boston Market with a buffet-style display case, but with more of a school lunch line feel to it.  The staff seemed a bit harried and disorganized.  They write your order on the tray paper but then cover the paper with your food items - this resulted in one of my sides being missed.\\nWe ordered a chicken and biscuit, chicken strips and the following sides: butter beans, cole slaw, fries, fried okra, rice and gravy, and corn bread.  Nothing was bad, everything was decent, nothing was outstanding.  The chicken seemed to be good quality and it was juicy, however there was too much breading, it wasn't crispy and the breading fell off the chicken too easily.  The corn bread was the best tasting item we had.   \\nThe decor is meant to evoke a southern farmhouse aesthetic, but it came across more like a pompous Winter Park take on Cracker Barrel.  The conspicuously mismatched chairs ironically revealed an overly-zealous attempt to look haphazard and rustic.\\nWe are typically inclined to enjoy and support locally-owned establishments, however in this case we concluded that our local Boston Market offers better service, Popeye's has better chicken, and both are a better value."},{"name":"The COOP: A Southern Affair","address":"610 W Morse Blvd","city":"Winter Park","stars":"3.5","text":"The food was pretty good!

This place has a lot of experimental burgers, especially for the South.\\n\\nThe Burgers:\\nPate Melt: fantastic, but a rotational burger.  I would go there more often if it was a staple of the menu. The lingonberry jam totally complemented the rest of the burger.  I do take ~1/2 of the random green stuff off the top to keep it from overpowering the other flavors.\\nChorizo: very tasty.  My default burger.  Breakfast-y flavors.\\nLamburger (not the gyro Lamburger): This was taken off the menu, and good thing.  It sucked.  There was so much toppings, I couldn't taste any meat in the burger.  A burger without meat flavor is not a burger, it is a fail.\\nLobster Burger:  This was as amazing as it was expensive.  Sadly, they took it off the menu.\\n\\nSides:\\n'spicy' BBQ sweet potato tots: The BEST side dish I have ever had.  Period.  They took it off the menu though. :'(  It was not spicy at all.\\nSweet potato tots: They are tasty, but do not remotely compare to the BBQ version\\nSweet Breads: Tastes like high-end beef-equivalent of chicken nuggets.\\n\\nMilk Shakes:\\nKrispy Kreme:  Part donut, part milkeshake, better than both individually.  This is polarizing.  ~2/10 friends did not like it.  The rest really liked it.\\nNutella + Burnt Marshmallow: Kinda weak and gross nutty-chocolate milkshake with random burnt marshmallows on top.  The chocolate shake base, was very lackluster.\\nCap'n Crunch + pb foam:  Tastes like what you would expect, delicious.

Their sausage and lamb skewers are both amazing too.  I've had my share of lamb skewers from when I was living in Central Asia, and I often order lamb here in the states, but Santarpio's has consistently had the best lamb without the weird aftertaste lamb sometimes has.

I have a personal maxim that states \\"Any restaurant that has a long line is probably not worth it.\\" Hopoddy's still fulfills that maxim. The choice of burgers is interesting, but I wouldn't say they were amazing. Juicy, but not wildly flavorful, despite the sauces on the burgers I tried. Between a long line and the a-okay burgers, the restaurant probably only rates 3 stars. I'll admit, it takes a lot to wow me when it comes to burgers, so take that with a grain of salt.\\n\\nWhere it shines are in these areas:\\n\\n1) Amazingly friendly staff. Great folks doing great work with a big smile. \\n2) My friends -- my friends love this place and that makes me happy to see them smile.\\n3) The Salted Caramel shake. This amazing little beverage is delectable. I'm not sure what they put in it, but it's thick, it's creamy, and the salt really makes the caramel pop as it mixes with the whipped cream.\\n\\nNote that if they give you the option to sit at the bar, take it -- it helps you pass waiting in line. Go up and ask; if they have room, the staff will help you out. This option is the primary reason I give Hopdoddy's 4 stars.

Upon arriving and having a table arranged for us, another host? server? manager? came up and demanded my name and # of guests I was with despite me telling him twice we had already been helped... I ordered the beef dip (Spot sized, one of my go tos besides the BC burger) and it arrived lukewarm at best with its accompanying au jus also lukewarm. The fries were clumped together in multiple balls and also not very fresh. I had to ask twice for hot au jus, which was disappointing since I ordered beef dip and, to me anyway, drowning my sandwich in au jus is mandatory. \\n\\nBesides the below par food, the service was terrible. Our server had some sort of attitude and seemed to be in a rush to get away from us all night. I think our requests were pretty standard...more water, some more napkins, more fries please.

A friend and I decided to eat lunch here on a Saturday and the place was packed but there were plenty of parking in the front and side of the restaurant.  The host was located at the front by the door and kindly showed us to our table (no wait on a Saturday in Atlanta? YES).  I liked that they included hand sanitizer at each table.  There was seating available inside the restaurant and the covered patio area.  We decided to side inside the restaurant and the first thing I noticed as we were seated was the aroma of different spices as the waiters and waitress brought out food from the kitchen.  Our waitress was such as sweetheart and took the time to explain the menu to us and to answer any and all questions that we had.  We order to steak tibs and chicken tibs with rice, cabbage, and collard greens.  I also ordered the spongy bread (I cannot recall the name) but it tasted sort of like sourdough bread and we used it to pick up our food.  They also provide utensils if you wish to eat it in the \\"formal\\" way.  It took awhile for our food to come but it was well worth it.  Everything was cooked to perfection and it was more than enough food for two people.  The meat was very fresh and included bits of tomato and small pieces of jalapeno (but they did not make the meal spicy).  We chose to eat it in \\"family style\\" in which everything was served on one large plate.  It was an awesome experience.  The meal was soooooo good that I decided to place a to-go order for steak tibs and I enjoyed that the next day.

That is because the food made my bunghole weep sweet chocolate tears.  But seriously, it wrecked my innards. To give some context, imagine my colon is Sarajevo circa 1994. I had the \\"Burger.\\"  The meat was good because it was made from meat. The bread on the other hand reminded me of \\"wood bread.\\"  But Manny, what is wood bread? Wood bread is a delicacy that my Irish friend belligerently prepared for myself and others one sandy summer night.  Wood bread is prepared (intuitively I hope) by placing wheat bread directly onto a burning camp fire log. It tastes about how you would imagine - like wheat bread covered in ash and sand. I guess what I'm trying to say is the burger's bun was burnt. My girlfriend had some other dish that they serve there. We were both very pleased with the water. You know, just the right amount of ice. Not too much, not too little.  Goldilocks' loins would be moist, trust me. Also, speaking of Groupons, their Groupon system is f**ked.  They have a deal - $40 worth of food (not including alcohol, fyi) for $20. However you can't use this unless you buy $40+ of food (not including alcohol). So our bill was $49 dollars. To calculate how much we owed independent of the Groupon, they used the following simple formula: Take the total, subtract $20, tax the remainder, add this tax to the remainder, subtract another $20 from the sum of the tax and the original total minus $20. Simple enough! Anyway, all of this to say, try the water, it rocks!"},{"name":"Desta Ethiopian Kitchen","address":"3086 Briarcliff Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Absolutely delicious.

The sour pickled vegetables and sauce were just right. I would recommend adding that delicious spicy chili sauce.

Was just surprisingly bland in a good bowl of noodles.\\n- The shaumai I had was ehhhh. Very small portion for $4?! Also was relatively tasteless besides without sauce. The sauce was very good though.\\n\\nNot a bad noodle place. I would recommend only getting the noodles since this is one of those places that nonChinese people go to in order to feel like they are truly getting a Chinese experience, but Xian definitely does not have sushi (trust me, I've been there).

Order up the bourbon barrel IPA. It had a nice bite but the bourbon flavor was way too subtle. What's this on the menu? Fried Chicken Cassoulet?  One of my comfort food favorites, let's check this out. So an interesting play on the traditional version - black eyed peas, a bed of collards and confit chicken on top.

There are times when you want a restaurant for lighter lunch fare that's healthy but doesn't taste healthy.  And when you're meeting a friend for lunch to catchup, it's good to have a place where you can sit and talk.  34th street meets those needs.\\n\\nFor lunch, you go to the counter at the front, look at a menu, order, get a number and they bring the food to the table.  The staff during the lunch hour are young and more laid back.  The menu is a nice mix of salads, small pizzas, sandwiches and a few entrees.  There are cookies and cake for dessert if you want them.  The menu features a lot of locally grown items.  The food is fresh and has good flavors.  \\n\\nIt's a small place, so if you go during the week, it's a bit crowded from the businesses in the area (it's next to Seton and Bailey square), so if you want to hang out and talk, it's probably better to go a little early or a little late from the noon peak rush time.\\n\\nI've also eaten here at dinner a couple of times.  In the evening, it's a more traditional restaurant with a more formal atmosphere and heavier menu.  I thought it was a bit pricey but that's probably because I was used to the lunch menu.  Dinner was a bit hit-and-miss.  I had some very good dishes and some thing that I didn't care for.  \\n\\nThis is a small venue- it reminds me of the original Castle Hill in that there's not a lot of tables.  We were lucky that it was not crowded the times that we went there for dinner but it was a bit noisier at dinner and I wondered whether there would be issues finding an open table on a weekend.  It also closes early, so it would probably be better to go there for an early dinner.\\n\\nThere is parking in the front facing 34th street but it's limited and it competes with the baby shop next door.  You might want to check for parking in the rear of the restaurant (there's a door in the back) or on the weekends, you can park in the Bailey Square lot.  Lunch is casual- come as you are.  Dinner is a bit more formal- business casual is fine though.  No TVs and it's easy to carry on a conversation, although it is a small space.  It's an adult restaurant, so no ill-behaved children.

Outside of Eggs Benedict your options are leaner but include garden omelet, pancakes, burrito or french toast.  \\n\\nSides: With each entree you are allowed one side.  Rosemary hash browns, corned beef hash (with actual corned beef sliced over large chunk roasted potatoes) bacon (the best I've had in Portland), ham, fruit cup, biscuits with gravy, toast, English muffin or toast.  \\n\\nPresentation:  Beautiful.  You know when you and your companion say \\"oh and ah\\" upon the plates being presented that you are in for a delightful treat.\\n\\nTaste: The kitchen has done well when your companion says, \\"You are making crazy noises with every bite.\\" Which translates to; worth every single calorie intake from the Hollandaise sauce.\\n\\nCost: You can eat for under $10 bucks per person including tip if you just go with water and entree which includes the one side.  Otherwise prepare to pay $15.  Either way, the taste/experience and no line are worth every extra penny you spend.\\n\\nBottom Line:  You will not be disappointed.

They have a his and her combo during lunch time (one of my favorite and plus it is a better deal sometimes). The food is excellent. Except (well this is my preference), I don't like a half cut lettuces with dressing on top (in the his and her). I prefer it sliced up and then dressing mixed in. Again this is my preference, some people said they like it because they know its fresh and where its coming from. Fair enough.\\n\\nTheir dinner is always good, I have tried almost 1/3 of the things on their menu and it has not disappointed me once. My favorite is the ahi tuna and that was a wow. Amazing food. I have to admit, I have never had their sushi before but I heard that its good. Especially they make it in the middle of the restaurant. That is when you know its fresh, no hidden secrets. :-)\\n\\nThe place is quite nice and cozy. Can be quite loud especially at lunch time.

They have different Suite numbers. However, someone at Yelp was smart enough to delete that restaurant as well as my review and then repost my review right here in this restaurant page which doesn't make sense. Nice move, Yelp.\\n\\nNeptune is divided into two restaurants situated side by side in a large compound along Ackroyd and No. 3 Road. Neptune Seafood is the more expensive and bigger restaurant with the red awning, open only during lunch and dinner. The more casual spot, Neptune Wonton Noodle, is open until late nights, with the green awning entrance. Having tried the Seafood Restaurant for a group dinner previously and all of us enjoying it, we stopped by again this time at their casual cafe for a pre-dinner stop. Their wide menu selection was well organized, separated according to specials of the day depending on the time. You will notice everything is cheaper from 2pm-5pm and late nights. They likewise offer $2.50 dimsum plates prior to 11am daily. \\n\\nService, as expected was friendly, fast, and efficient. The ambience is very similar to cafes in Hongkong - busy, alive, and totally bustling. Aside from wonton noodles, varying selections include congees, hotpots, set menus, chef's specials. We opted for the empress chicken as most tables seem to have this. Very similar to Singaporean Hainanese Chicken such that boiled chicken was served cold with pounded ginger dip. That and some tofu served in a claypot, nice! All dishes were delicious and abundantly portioned given the prices. \\n\\nVery good cheap eats, and highly recommended for late nights.

The udon noodle was well sauteed without the usual greasiness you sometimes find.  Unfortunately that can't be said for two different pot stickers.  By the time we were done, one of the paper napkin we were using to blot the oil was completely soaked.  Next, the chicken lettuce wrap lacked the usual half a head of iceberg lettuce that you would use to hold and wrap the filling.  Instead, we only had a small quarter portion of lettuce that just didn't do the job.  And finally, the spicy silky tofu, was a very poor and uninspired interpretation of the traditional ma po tofu.  The kimchee provided the spiciness, but because its marinated in vinegar it really ruin the taste.  Lastly, even though the wait staff was efficient and courteous, the food came too slowly considering when we sat down the restaurant was only about half full.  Chinese restaurants are usually known for their quick and efficient service.\\n\\nIncluding a beer, all this set us back around $90 before tips.

Desta is the quintessential Habesha hangout, its where us Ethiopians take all our Ferengi friends and coworkers and on some occasions go ourselves.  It's a very small cozy restaurant tucked into a plaza off of Briarcliff and Clairmont Rd, in what is now known to be Little Ethiopia and rightfully so.  Desta has creative, tasty food that is pleasing to the Ethiopian diaspora clientele as well as the American diners of all backgrounds.  My favorites here are the Fish Tibs, this place make the best Fish Tibs hands down, no other place can replicate the crispiness and succulence of the Tilapia quite like Desta, not even at home. The misir is my usual side choice.  The veggie combo is good, although at times underwhelming only because Ethiopia has so many great vegetarian dishes and it does not come through in the selections they offer in the combo.  I always order the Fish tibs with shiro ( a red pepper sauced ground chick pea stew) and its really yummy.  Its a great environment, with many other Ethiopian hangouts in the area to grab coffee at near by and they have fresh Desserts made by what I believe is the baker from the old Buhe Bakery and it is wonderful as well.

The chips are a little break-y, but they taste really good and are light which doesn't take over the flavor of the guac. And the queso? Well, really, can you go wrong with queso? The edamame is also good, though it changed a little between visits, but I love the flavor they add-- a great alternative to just tons of salt.

Asada Zing, Shrimp Tempura, Rich Man's, Gringo, Short Rib, Chipotle Lime Chicken, Pacific Rim, and Baja were all great. OK, so that's most of the menu, but what can I say? I love a good taco. The only one I wasn't super impressed with was the Rising Sun Taco-- it just came off a little meh compared to the rest of them. \\n\\nNext time we go, I'm going to check out the quesadillas and the s'mores eggroll, and probably throw in some fried plantain for the fun of it :) \\n\\nThe service was very pleasant and prompt, the staff is super nice, the venue is quiet but chic (kind of spa-like), and both times I've come out with a full belly, a smile on my face, and the feeling that I'm willing to battle Buckhead traffic to get back to this place!\\n\\nPS-- parking in the back is free!"},{"name":"FLIP burger boutique","address":"1587 Howell Mill Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Overrated, overpriced, with only so-so service.

I'm really disappointed to say that our experience last night may explain why it's easy these days to get a table there on a Saturday night without a wait or reservation.\\n\\nI'm used to paying a lot of money for a small amount of high quality food, but the amount of food we received for the $90 Chef's Tasting prix fixe menu was so small it was almost comical. \\n\\nThe difference may be due to how they're now serving the Chef's Tasting menu. Previously, the food used to be served on a communal bowl or plate that diners would share and eat out of. While the course portions were smaller than the regular menu (about roughly half), you still felt really full by the end of the meal. This time, each course was portioned onto separate plates for each of us, but each dish was much much MUCH smaller. There were 11 total courses, and 6 of the 11 courses were literally about 1 bite each (some were even smaller than a normal bite!). Additionally, for some reason the dishes I was served were consistently smaller than my husbands, sometimes looking about 1/2 to 1/3 the size of his portion, which seemed really odd and vaguely sexist, even though it was probably a coincidence.\\n\\nWhat we received for $90/person:\\n1. Green tomato tostada - This was smaller than even an amuse-bouche portion, more like half of a bite.\\n2. Popcorn custard, gulf ceviche - This was my favorite dish. The custard was silky and had subtle flavors, but my portion was half the size of what my husband received. Both were served inside a small cup about the size of a large egg, but the custard only filled a small portion of the bowl.\\n3. Chicken skin, deviled egg - We received about 1 bite each, but this made sense due to the intense richness of this course. This course was one of my favorites.\\n4. Shishito pepper, spicy chicken fat - We received 2 small peppers each. I didn't really like this dish, so I didn't mind not getting more of it.\\n5. Zucchini, arugula, beet jus - The jus was delicious, but we barely got a taste (about 2 spoonfuls) because the jus didn't even cover the bottom of the bowl.\\n6. Heirloom tomato tart - My least favorite course of the night, both in flavor (didn't taste very unique) and in quantity. We each received 1/4 of a tiny tart, literally about the size of a quarter. It felt so stingy that this left us wondering what they did with the other half of the tart.\\n7. Snapper in the husk, corn, rice - This was delicate and delicious, but again my portion was half the size of what my husband received, about 2 tiny bites worth.\\n8. Smoked duck tamale, peach salsa, basil - This was a deconstructed tamale. It was very tasty, and the portion made sense for a tasting menu. No complaints on this one.\\n9. Aged Akaushi ribeye, potato, green bean - Was extremely flavorful and delicious, but the portion was approximately the size of 1 slice of fajita meat. By this point, we were disappointed because we could tell we were going to leave the restaurant still hungry, which is rare for me because I get full really easily.\\n10. Sorrel snow, strawberry, yogurt, coriander - This was my favorite dessert. It was light and summery.\\n11. Chocolate & shiitake crepe cake, fig, lavender - This had decent flavors. The presentation was really pretty.\\n\\nNeedless to say, while we will undoubtedly come back, we will *never* order Barley Swine's Chef's Tasting menu again. As a not-so-wise man once said: \\"Fool me once, shame on...shame on you. Fool me...you can't get fooled again.\\""},{"name":"The Melting Pot","address":"1200 Commerce Park Dr","city":"Longwood","stars":"4","text":"so---been years since we were here.  we had 2 anniversaries to celebrate so family or 4 went ---wow treatment like kings and queens!  perfect meal; perfect waiter; little drink on the house to celebrate \\neven my wife said we need to go back.  son and his wife a little picky on \\"fancy menus\\" had a ball ; enjoyed thoroughly their first time at fondue.\\nso what else to say except got to try it in longwood for a treat!"},{"name":"Medina Cafe","address":"780 Richards Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Wow, what a great brunch spot, but be prepared to wait.

Anyway, I ordered some fries that turned out to be very salty and not crispy at all. \\n\\nAs for my wife's salmon; I made a mistake by forgetting to tell the waiter that my wife was pregnant... when the salmon came, it was really raw inside(my wife actually said it was like salmon sashimi). Since it was my own mistake, I just politely asked the waiter to bring it back to the kitchen and cook it longer, I even apologized to him for not mentioning about my wife's pregnancy at the first place. The waiter then apologized back and took it back to the kitchen for over 10 minutes, and when he took it back to us, we knew they had cooked it for sure since it actually shrunk a size(or two), so we thought the salmon should be fine. However, as she cut it open, it was still red and raw inside... just like before...  Therefore, I had to ordered some mashed potatoes for my wife because the only thing she could eat there was those salty french fries....\\n\\nOverall, the food quality really depends on what you order there. The fries and salmon we ordered were in no way up to the standards of such restaurants, and our friends made a joke of their broccoli side and called it \\"baby broccoli\\", but their mashed potatoes were really to die for. Our friend actually said it was \\"better than sex\\".\\n\\nAs for the restaurant itself, I really think it's more of a place for people to drink than to eat decent food. To me, it was more like a night club than a restaurant, because of the loud music they put on there, and the customers they had that were shouting. I would not recommend this restaurant to people that desired a romantic and elegant meal with their love ones."},{"name":"Amrheins","address":"80 W Broadway","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Really love this place.

Shortly after the Cheeseburgooshi came out, and they forgot to make it with turkey and hold the bacon as we requested. The manager came and quickly apologized, he explained to us that since this is a new establishment they were still working out a few kinks in the kitchen.

The manager came back and explained that turkey takes a little longer to cook than beef. At this point it had been over 30 mins from the time they had gone to replace the order.

It's generally a safe assumption that any of their establishments will deliver a good, if not great meal. Located on Piedmont just spitting distance from Buckhead Diner,  Kyma is hardcore Mediterranean.  Elegant white marble and Adriatic blue  accents somewhat transports you out of the landlocked city of Atlanta for the duration of your meal.\\n\\nFor the size of the space it's not oppressively noisy.  Noise level generally plays a part in my enjoyment of a meal. Fortunately the lack of it made me fully able to enjoy all the tastes that came to my table.\\n\\nUpon glance, and even scrutiny of the overall menu it is decidedly a seafood restaurant.  Sure there is an offering of one each chicken, beef and lamb for the landlubber at the table but make no bones about it, this is indeed a seafood restaurant. It's also very much vegetarian friendly and I don't mean the kind of vegetarian that coats 90% of their food in cheese and cream.\\n\\nThe wine list is also very decidedly Greek. I know, not music to a wine lovers ears but why not do when in Rome? I asked the waiter for a specific style of wine and he directed me right to one that fit the bill. While it was not unpleasant by any means it's still a Greek wine.  I would best describe the Green wines I've had as flat and forgettable.\\n\\nStarters:\\n\\nChilled oysters.  New Brunswick variety , petite, incredibly tender and even more incredibly fresh.  Sweet, briny and all around a win.\\n\\nPotato garlic olive oil spread with pita. Silky riced potato with no dairy. These potatoes are not resting on the laurels of cream and butter.  Heavy lemon note with a back note of garlic. Carb lovers dream when spread on warmed pita wedges.  This showed a lot of restraint as it could have gone too salty or too flat. Rejoice vegans. This one will satisfy you.\\n\\nWatermelon salad.  This composed salad has been around for a few years and there is a reason it's not going anywhere. This version is equal proporition cubed melon and feta. Very light fresh herbs and shaved onion garnish it. Deliciously refreshing with the addition of elegantly sweet watermelon sorbet quenelle.\\n\\nZucchini fritters with saffron aioli.  Round balls of squash and cheese with delicate seasoning fried in a tempura light crust and all around delicious with no trace of grease. The vibrant aioli is a perfect compliment. Again, not overly seasoned just delicately balanced. Another successful dish. I am starting to see a tapas pattern and I like it.\\n\\nEntrees are mainly a choice of whole fresh fish or shell fish grilled and served with the house prepared garnish of lemon , capers and olive oil. I opted for lobster in this style of prep.  The crustacean came to me cooked to perfection.  Tender claws removed from their shell and the body spilt  and cooked. Capers are a bit aggressive for the delicate meat but they are easy enough to eat around. Clarified drawn butter on the side proved to be a better marriage of flavor in my mouth. I loved every bite.  Let's be real, if you screw up lobster in a seafood restaraunt you really should close your doors and try your hand at burgers.\\n\\nRed snapper Briam, the chefs favorite has a beautiful pan sear and served atop summer squash, eggplant and tomatoes. Another cooked to perfection protein.  The portions are pleasantly sized and you won't leave hungry.\\n\\nBanana katafi is not to be missed. A beautiful dessert of shredded phyllo fried banana (I realize hot banana is hit or miss for some people), petite flourless chocolate cake of medium richness and all around delicious along with impossibly creamy tangy greek yogurt ice cream.\\n\\nService is perfection but I often wonder if that is because they realize I am writing a review or the staff just cares that you enjoy yourself enough to come back.\\n\\n8.5 out of 10 for Kyma.

We came last year and they closed early even though I had an Open Table reservation!  I was so mad I literally waited almost an entire year to try them again, but I'm really glad I did!  We enjoyed the Magical Dining menu, it was one of the best ones I have had so far.  I started with the baby arugula and poached pear salad, I really really loved it.  For dinner I had the filet, it was large cooked perfectly.  It came with rutmus and broccolini rather than the chard listed on the menu, but that was totally fine with me, I love broccolini.  The entree was so large I took half home and saved a little room for the Raspberry Royal dessert.  I liked the dessert, but my husband got the Chocolate Melt down and it was way better, so just go for that one!  The ambiance here is really nice and romantic.  Even with it being Magical Dining there was only two other tables here the whole time, and it was very quiet.

We liked that we could sample items on the menu while we were going through the line on the way to the register so we could see what we wanted to try next time. Great idea!\\nThe decor was very nice; typically restaurants that offer Southern food, the decor is usually too busy and cluttered. I liked that the seating is family style, meaning that you can share a table with other people. I liked that there are rolls of paper towels on the table because fried chicken can get messy. \\n\\nCons:\\nThe fried chicken was only very so-so; the breading on the chicken wasn't spectacular or out of this world. I got 2 pieces, which were both backs, which didn't have a lot of meat on either piece. I wish that they would've been mindful of which pieces were put together; serve one piece that doesn't have a lot of meat with another that does. My husband ordered the 3 piece, which for $2 more per meal, only got him a drumstick along with his other 2 pieces. We spent $20 for both of us for lunch and we had waters with our meal; that's a pricey lunch. \\n\\nI got 2 sides: creamed grits and fried okra. The breading on the okra was very good (cornmeal), the grits were okay. My husband got the carrots; they had a nice flavor but were dry. We wished they would've been served with a sauce over them. He also had the mac & cheese, which were just okay, nothing spectacular. \\n\\n*Full disclosure* I was raised in the South and had fried chicken every Sunday at my Grandma's house so I am very picky when it comes to chicken. The meal that we had today could be found at any good Southerners house on a Sunday afternoon, after church. It takes something really special for me to sing the praises of someone's friend chicken. This just wan't it. \\n\\nWe decided against getting dessert but noticed the price on the whole cream pies. The pies were very small and the price was $30 per pie!!

First off the rolls here are amazing and free and they bring a really great seasoned olive oil to dip in. Only one time have the rolls ever been cold and it was a very off-peak time. When we told the server, she graciously agreed to give us more rolls whenever the next batch came out of the oven. If you come here for lunch they also give you a free salad- basic but fresh. PS if you order take-away they still give you the salad and rolls. To save money consider splitting a personal pizza with a friend, its not a ton but with the other things it's enough, portion controlled and only 5 bucks per person!\\n\\nAs for what to order, I would say definitely pizza. I absolutely love their Napoleana style Margeritta pizza- tons of sauce, and just a bit of really fresh mozzarella, just the way I like it. If you are a cheese lover you should probably get the original kind that comes with a cute little olive. The prices aren't super cheap, but the pizza is reliably good. Not the best pizza in the world, but better than other places.\\n\\nOut of their dessert's I'd recommend the Bomba its vanilla and chocolate gelato with a chocolate shell, cherries, and almonds. It's so yummy. \\n\\nOne thing I don't like about Bertcuccis as a chain is they give no Nutritional Info...sorta makes you wonder about the calories.\\n\\nOthers here have commented about poor service-  I have never had a problem with waits or anything, and once even had a water drinking contest with a friend because they kept refilling our water glasses so much."},{"name":"El Chilito","address":"2225 Manor Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Although I enjoy the atmosphere and dessert choices here, I have been so consistently dissapointed by the quality of the food that I do not go anymore.

Therefore, I was, at once, excited and apprehensive to check out her Asian Fusion venture, just down Washington Street from Flour #1.\\n\\nWe went as a foursome (myself, the aforementioned lass, and another couple) and perused the tapas-ish menu of 'dim sum', 'then some', et cetera and then discovered a wee pink sheet with five 'date night' samplers of four or five plates apiece. After moderate hesitation and significant indecision (on the part of the ladies, of course), our group collaborated to share a Hot Date (spicier selections) and a Blind Date (at the mercy of the chef's choice).\\n\\nPrior to collecting our eats -- served rapid-fire and family-style -- our waiter carefully counseled us toward a few cocktails. Two of us had sake sangria (its flavour changes once every week or so), another enjoyed (after negotiating for a less-sweetened replacement) the Plum Wine Spritzer and our manliest rep put down a Dogfish pale ale and, thereafter, $9 worth of some swill boasting an ancient recipe.\\n\\nThen, the feast: Chicken and rapini (broccoli rabe in disguise) stir-fry (eating the little red chili peppers is a decision one might regret), sausage skewers with shiso wraps, tea-smoked pork spare ribs (the star of the show, we all agreed), udon noodles with chicken, fresh rolls with peanut sauce (a little cilantro-heavy), green papaya slaw (surprisingly spicy), corn and coconut soup (another favorite), sweet potato fritters (the bronze medalists) and a spicy eggplant dish, and generous bowls of white and brown rice. As a post-script, the full assortment of desserts (regularly $7) were offered at $5 as part of the 'date night' package and we took a coconut cream pie with lime accents to travel.\\n\\nEverything was quite edible (at worst) and brilliant (at best and, moreover, frequently) and entirely affordable, costing a total of $80 for ten (if I'm counting correctly) share-able dishes. In contrast to Restaurant Week menus ($130+ for a group of four) that too often feature shrunken portions of limited and/or dumbed-down selections, Chang's 'bizarro' (as dubbed on the restaurant's web site) answer to the RW concept seemed an absolute bargain.\\n\\nWhile the food (and, to a lesser extent, the drinks) are what remain in my mind, the service and the decor were strong as well. Our waiter was very knowledgeable, patient and helpful. He can stand to suffer a demerit for wearing an ill-advised vest and still be held in high regard. The decor was (thankfully) more South End-like than Chinatown-like and it's always heartwarming to see a restaurant owner working in her own kitchen (not to mention delivering birthday cakes and interacting tableside with her patrons)."},{"name":"Blue Star Donuts","address":"1155 SW Morrison St, Ste 102","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"This place definitely deserved a five star review.

I got a combo shake, fries, and burger meal for $12.00 plus tax and it was VERY FILLING! I was expecting to pay at least $20 plus tip, but maybe that's because I went at lunch. The wait staff was very accomodating to me. When I asked for recommendations, they practically jumped excitingly describing their favorites. I could hardly decide. Service was fast!\\n\\nI ended up choosing the turkey burger, burnt marshmallow/nutella milkshake, and fries. \\n\\nVery good Turkey burger! Flavorful, smokey, and filling! Scrumptious! So filled with toppings that I could hardly fit it in my mouth. I felt a little rude opening up my mouth SO WIDE to eat it. I hate opening up that wide. It had avocado, alfalfa sprouts, Monterrey jack cheese, and pomegranate ketchup (hmm). I was a tiny bit disappointed that I couldn't really taste the pomegranate in the exotic ketchup, but maybe it was because I didn't have some plain 'ol Heinz to compare it to. \\n\\nThe fries were also crispy, hot, and perfectly seasoned with sea salt and chives (?), but they must have ran out of the hickory smoked mayo because they gave me plain 'ol cat sup with my fries. I didn't realize that until I was already half done eating them, so I guess it didn't really matter.\\n\\nThe Burnt marshmallow and Nutella milkshake was pretty good. I loved the presentation. When they put the glass in front of me, the marshmallows on top were still simmering and smoking! And mm mm! I savored that burnt marshmallow flavor. I couldn't really taste the nutella in the shake, it tasted like regular chocolate which I guess isn't bad, but I was really looking forward to the tasting the hazelnut in a nutella flavored milkshake. The shakes are very rich and thick, could really be a meal on their own. Try as I might, I couldn't finish it without my stomach exploding, I needed another stomach! LOL! \\n\\nI definitely recommend FLIP for lunch or a fun night out with friends or family.

The entrance was laughable (pregnant ladies, be warned...you won't be able to navigate yourselves to the front door) and it's VERY noisy due to the vaulted ceilings. The servings are tiny and the food adequate but waaaay over-priced. The staff are not happy puppies, but try to get through their evening with a dash of sarcasm mixed with a sprinkling of self-indulgence and importance (live in Paris and be authentic if you wish to display this attitude....dudes.) Not the place for a nice, sophisticated or (need I say) 'romantic' evening with your significant other. It's a shear rip off folks and there are much better alternatives to be had in Vancouver, especially if you like seafood.

Although I wanted to try to vegetarian/vegan platter, I thought it would be way too much food to eat on my own, so I ordered the Ater (split pea stew). It tasted exactly as I was expecting - nothing more and nothing less. It was yummy, but if you're looking for a unique ethiopian flavor, this probably won't fit the bill. \\n\\nThe injera was really, really addicting. It has a very strong sourdough taste, but the texture of a spongey flatbread. The waitress brought a basket of two injera rolls to our table, and my Ater came with one big injera roll. It was enough to eat with my Ater, and I think the baskets of injera were refill-able (but not 100% sure). \\n\\nOverall, I enjoyed my dish, but was hoping for something more uniquely flavored. I will definitely get around to ordering the vegetarian platter one of these days, and will need to explore more Ethiopian eateries to satisfy my cravings!\\n\\nA note about service: kind of slow and hard to get the waitress' attention at times, but not the worst I've experienced."},{"name":"La Mamma Pizza And More","address":"190 Brighton Ave","city":"Allston","stars":"3","text":"Horrible!!

You walk in to be immediately greeted by the cook making the famous homemade sausage... the aroma alone is enough to affirm your decision!

From what I have heard, it's been this way since it started... and for good reason.\\n\\nNow, on to the best part... the food. I had the homemade sausage, Santarpio's staple pizza.  The price was a welcome surprise - $11.50 for a 12-14\\" pizza, and that's before taking a bite. One thing I noticed as I sat down, everyone was eating their pizza with forks and knives, and I quickly realized why once the pizza was placed in front of me. The juice from the straight-from-the-grill sausage flows over the entire pizza and soaks into the cheese, which is what makes it so heavenly. I can't begin to describe the sausage itself, but I'll just say that I have never tasted anything quite like it!

The calamari was a huge platter made Asian style. It had the full calamari with tentacles and also the rings. The flavor was unique and I enjoyed the Asian twist. The plate had some veggies and crispy noodles on it.\\n\\nNext course, I had the Chilean Seabass. It was perfectly steamed Hong Kong style in a light soy broth . My husband ordered the swordfish that came with avocado, cilantro, red chili and crab. The texture was hearty but yet light. We split the asparagus as a side dish. The asparagus was grilled with crispy prosciutto (think bacon) with shirred egg on top. The egg made this side dish just a little more delicious with added texture and flavor. I think I would of added some sea salt when grilling the asparagus. That is how I make mine on the grill at home with olive oil and sea salt. \\n\\nWhat stoled the show was the dark chocolate and crushed toffee smores. The dessert was rich and flavorful.

One of the best restaurants in Austin!\\n\\nThe restaurant is small, but has a rustic farmhouse feel to it.  Tables are communal and you may be seated next to complete strangers.  For anti-social patrons like me, they have almost like a sushi bar where you can sit and watch the chefs work. It is somewhat less annoying than a traditional sushi bar, since the chefs aren't right up in your face working and talking to you.  It was quite nice, even coming alone.  The restaurant is also fairly LOUD, as it's a lot of people in a small space.  I brought earplugs.\\n\\n**also, just a note - parking sucks.\\n\\nThe menu features a limited amount of small plates, so you're expected to order 3-4 dishes per person.  This gives you the opportunity to try new things, and the opportunity to pay more.  The menu rotates frequently by what ingredient is in season so there's always something new every time you come back.\\n\\nThe food however, is nothing short of terrific.  Each dish is inventive, carefully composed to mix textures and balance flavors, and presented like a work of modern art.  Every dish on the menu looks and tastes awesome.   I fell in love with the beet & avocado salad, the pig three-ways dish, and the peach & basil semifreddo.  And I don't even particularly like beets or pork!  The only miss for me was the salmon & funnel cake \\"special\\" which was lacking acid, but everything else was so badass, I easily forgave.\\n\\nThe amount of food on each plate isn't huge and even after four dishes you feel like you could eat a little more.  However, I think that may be because I'm used to other restaurants over-serving portions and myself coming out completely stuffed and bloated.  Although there is not enough to share, I think the portions are about right..\\n\\nThe bill for one person (not including alcohol) (after tax & tip) ended up being $60, which hurts if someone else isn't paying.

It's apparent that many of the patron's are regulars, which gives it a nice warm, comfortable feeling.  They don't take reservations for parties less than six, but you can all ahead, which I recommend.  It's also a bit challenging to find the first time, especially in the dark.  So try to give yourself a few extra minutes for that and parking.\\n\\nIt's a terrific date option, very romantic...date number three, perhaps?  They offer daily specials of entrees, soups and desserts.  If the special isn't so special in your mind, the entree list is almost endless.  The tomato basil soup has a nice balance of spice and flavor, but the bowl is a little big if you're planning for a salad and entree to follow.  They do serve some fresh bread and olive oil after ordering.   \\n\\nOur server was okay, a little off on the taboos of service, but a nice guy.

I'm glad that the staff attends to their customers and keeps the long line moving. Likewise, the food is tasty (the best of all the fast food Tex Mex places) but I can only speak from a vegetarian's point of view.

I've gone by Odd Duck about 10 times and literally every time I go on the day it's closed.  So I was happy to finally try out some of the good life.  The place is small but perfect for what it is; be patient and ready to wait.  The interior design is actually pretty damn cool and attracts a nice social atmosphere.  Open kitchen is always cool too - it's nice to see your chef tasting literally every dish before it goes out to ensure highest quality.  Fortunately our two friends got their early and had a table waiting for us, which we shared with two strangers as well.  I think you can just go there to taste the food or look at the menu online so I'm not going into detail on their food, but the concept is farm-to-table small plates (tapas style) and everything was crazy tasty.  I'd have to say the duck with risotto was my favorite, although next time we'll literally just order the full menu as I think we didn't order only two or three items.  The waitress was real helpful and divided out our order into 4 courses.  Between four of us the bill was around 150 bucks, which is somewhat pricey but not bad or unexpected at all considering we ordered the whole menu and had about 3 drinks each.  They also have a great Barley Wine and Allagash in large bottles, so it is immediately one of my favorite places to be.  This place is going to be around for a long while.

Food was excellent but what was even more mind blowing was the wine pairings.  The chef really does know what he's doing because everything that came out of the kitchen was not only beautiful but extremely tasty and unique.  The person responsible for the wine pairing is a fucking genius!  I highly highly recommend pairing your tasting menu... If that's the route you're going... With wine.

Friends gave up, they are all mad, including my mom, haven't called her in 4 months... I never knew why I have such a hard time being a decent human being; you  know, politically correct, bright and shiny, good for society, mortgage, rrsps, social butterfly, smart kids, SUV, little money on very conservative mutual funds, a good Samaritan. I tried, believe it or not... \\n\\nDidn't quite work out. I was back to the jungle, doing whatever I want, whenever I want very shortly. It is not my choice, just like James Brown said ''it is what it is...''\\n\\nI invited a friend out for her birthday and she was kind enough join me. Hopefully I still have some social skills left to keep her entertained. She mentioned Coast... Never been, why not, sure. \\n\\nOne bad addiction of mine; I love christmas music. At first it comes across entertaining to people, but it is at a very annoying level. So I popped some christmas music on my ipod and hopped on my scooter to head down to the restaurant. I am dreaming of a white christmas. I know it is June, but the song was written in California by Irving, him dreaming of a snowy Chritsmas, at least that is what I was told.\\n\\nFirst impression; kind of Joe Forte's without the Joe. You never get real good food out of this kinda joints. Usually decently executed, crowd pleasing, yet no real character...The hostess arrives with two menus, my company is not here yet, so I still have a little time to have my last panic attack and maybe listen to one last \\"Santa Baby, by Madonna''.\\n\\nThe size of the menus are hilarious. They are real life size tablets. I am sitting in this tiny table with two giant, giant menus, feeling like Moses all ready. However you can not put them down, there are no space. How about wrapping these bad boys around your head and start a whirling dervish party. Each menu would yield to 2 medium size cone shaped dervish hat. For sure. Oh there is my company, be decent now, you do not need another woman with bad memories about you. I am haunted by bad karma enough all ready.\\n\\nWell, let's get to the food. Too many selections... Flat breads and variety of salads, excessive choice of steaks...Bad bad signs of a great medium. We have ordered the sushi tile for two and scallops for entrees, bottle of beautiful Riesling. The sushi tile looked and tasted very appetizing with the exception of skin-on yellow tail sashimi -if I am not wrong- Sushi cooks would pour boiling water on the skin of the fish before serving just to soften it up and partially cook the skin with keeping the flesh raw, let's say a water baste. Very original to watch, however soggy fish skin is very unlikable for that size. Loup de mer, red mullet, anchovies and such I do not mind, but on this particular one, I had to chew through fish skin...Other than that, it is good.\\n\\nEntree; Scallops with fennel, potatoes, olives and canned artichokes. Scallops, lack seasoning, excellent temperature though (except one, raw). I do not think they are alive fresh, but a very good quality frozen shellfish, which these days there is nothing wrong with it. The vegetable garnish I am not a big fan, which lemony seasoning (it was some from of beurre blanc if I am not mistaken) covers the flaws of it.\\n\\nFirst things first I do not get the fascination of canned artichokes in this culture. That is a very hard vegetable to master to start with and the canned variety is not even a close substitute for the real thing. It is good for pizza or salads under $10. If I am paying $36 for an entree; either do not have it on your menu, or get a fresh one, clean, cook and serve appropriately. Putting canned artichoke is more like a tex-mex Mediterranean flair. At that price range, it does bother me.\\n\\nAnd as far as the lightly grilled red pepper goes; some vegetables are not meant to be eaten crispy. Like eggplant, red pepper and such. As they roast and get soft, the natural sugars would work and transform these vegetables into something so incredibly delicious, that you would not imagine. There were two occasions my grandma prepped roasted red pepper with vinegar and garlic. When she was in the weeds for dinner, to keep my grandpa occupied until she gets the entree going, or whenever she wanted to get laid.\\n\\nAll these unfocused restaurants trying to please everybody...Tsk tsk.. ''A great recipe for failure'' said Bill Cosby if I am not wrong.  A seafood restaurant has to serve the freshest seafood that their coast line offers. Nothing else. That is what the rest of the world is doing rather than Starbucks or Safeway style customer service style focused menus. Oh, by the way, those are the great simple restaurants that you remember highly from your last vacation in the old world.\\n\\nHopefully Grandma won't see this review.

Shortly after, the line was long. \\n\\nSo when you go up to the first counter, you can pick what kind of sides you want and how much. For example, I wanted lots of green beans so I got the bigger container while I got a small container for mac-n-cheese. The sides get placed on the tray and you go to the meat counter. We got pork ribs, spicy and regular sausage, and turkey meat. The ribs were so tender and smokey (exactly what BBQ is supposed to taste like)! I also enjoyed the turkey meat as well.

What I like most about the pork cutlet is the sauce, it's not too sweet nor salty. \\nThe soup is really good as well... you can decide how spicy you want it. Very flavourful and the meat is falling off the bones.\\n\\nThey have lots to offer on their Menu which I'm quite happy about since the other Korean restaurant around the area doesn't have much on their menu.

We were here to get our Meat On!! It took a little while for the meat to finally come out, but when it did, wow! The various cuts of steak were amazing! Cooked to perfection . The chicken was a little dry but tolerable. It was chicken breast after all. The beer was cold and priced just right. The atmosphere was friendly and the service was fantastic!! \\n\\nSo why did I give it four stars?\\n Having been raised in a family of restaurant management people, I wanted to leave room for improvement. This is after all the first week this restaurant opened and I am sure they are still working out any little kinks. I noticed a few things but they are not important enough to mention here. The only thing I'll say is, \\"give them a brake!\\" I think if we continue to visit this place, it's going to be a success!\\n.

They definitely brought flavor and friendliness from the big island, and the experience was as comforting as the food. San Marcos is lucky to have fresh Hawaiian food on the go!\\n\\nThe service was fast and organized. They definitely made sure everyone received their food and was fed a generous amount. The prices are fair and well appreciated!\\n\\nI had the ahi poki with rice, slaw, and a side of sweet potato fries. The tuna was so fresh and flavored with sweet onions. We received a special side sauce that reminded me of a mayo-siracha sauce usually served on top of sushi rolls. It was goooood. The slaw was tangy and light, vegetables were crispy and cold for a warm afternoon. Everything on my plate was well balanced in flavor and ingredients.\\n\\nMy boyfriend had the big kahuna with pineapple and avocado. According to him, he had delicious notes of sweet and savory in one burger. \\n\\nIt was definitely a great experience. We pretty much licked our plates clean and enjoyed the rest of our guava and mango juices we order."},{"name":"Orinoco","address":"22 Harvard St","city":"Brookline","stars":"4","text":"Orinoco still remains one of my favorite go-to spots for great food and excellent cocktails.

My grandmother's recipes knock Schmidt's out of the park in my opinion.  Maybe it should be called \\"Grandma Alice's\\" instead.  :)  I don't know, the food is just really heavy and either too strong or too bland, and there is ALOT of it.  Seriously.  Take some Beano or whatever helps you with, erm....you know...because you will have it after you leave Schmidt's.  And be prepared to pay a pretty penny.\\n\\nEveryone know's about Schmidt's and wants to bring their out of town guests here, so plan to arrive at least an hour early.  They don't take reservations, so put your name in ASAP and enjoy walking around the adorable German Village while you wait.  The gift shop down the street offers free coffee and tea which is so hospitable!  They also have cute gifts from local Ohio artisans. Schiller park is beautiful and just a few blocks away.\\n\\nSorry, back to Schmidt's  - the highlight?  Most definitely the cream puffs, specifically the chocolate one.

While the restaurant looks nice and is conveniently located, it is average at best in all other respects.\\n\\nThe Food:  I ordered a half-dozen oysters of different types and their mango California roll, hold the mango.  Every single oyster was bland and chewy.  All I could taste was the stuff I put on the oysters (hot sauce, horseradish or mignonette).  I eat oysters pretty frequently, including several of the types I ordered that night, and these are the worst I've ever eaten.  The CA roll was also flavorless , there were bits of crab shell throughout, and the rice was hard, as though the roll had been made earlier in the day and refrigerated for several hours. \\n\\nOne of my friends ordered the calamari, which I tried.  Some of the pieces I had were OK, but it overall lacked flavor.  The calamari were all long strips - no rings or legs - which tells me that it was probably pre-frozen, pre-packaged stuff.  I had to stop eating it after getting one too many chewy pieces.   \\n\\nMy other friend ordered the brussels sprouts, which was the best dish I tried.  They were a bit greasy, however.  I've got to dock points from Coast for this friend's meal too, because I pre-arranged with the restaurant for her to get a special vegetarian meal.  FYI, Coast has very few vegetarian options on its menu, but I learned from other Yelpers that they can make very tasty vegetarian dishes upon request.  When I got to Coast, they had no record of the special menu, even though I had written confirmation of it, and the manager I arranged everything with wasn't there.  As a result, my friend ordered 2 of the probably 5 vegetarian-friendly dishes on the menu. \\n\\nThe Drinks:  My sauvignon blanc was a 3/5, one of my friends like the red wine she had and my other friend hated the riesling she ordered.  \\n\\nThe Service:  While I understand that there is a cultural difference between service in Canada vs. the U.S. (with U.S. waitstaff generally more hands on and pushing to turn over the table faster), our waitress would disappear for long stretches of time and we often had to flag her down when we could see her, just to ask a question or get something.  The disappearing act was especially weird, because there was only 1 other table seated in our section and the restaurant was pretty dead, because we were eating dinner at 10:30 p.m. \\n\\nThe Price:  All of that sub-par food, wine and service cost us $65 CAD per person.  I will spend amounts that other people may consider ridiculous for food, but that's for good food.  This meal was not worth the price.  I get much better food and service at far less expensive spots.  \\n\\nThe next time I'm in Vancouver, I'll probably check out Italian Kitchen or one of the other restaurants on Alberni instead."},{"name":"Whiskey's Food & Spirits","address":"885 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"2.5","text":"The food is great!!

Not only were the colors extremely bright but they were sprayed on and any small inadvertent bump left white markings. OK that's the picky \\"I can get over it comment\\". The other things that really were a bother were the cutting and the taste. Cutting was impossible, as after the first cut the cake literally collapsed on itself and had to be scooped onto plates (it had been refrigerated up until an hour before serving). I had requested a white buttercream filling with fresh strawberries and I have no clue why the difficulty. The flavor I chose was pink champagne and the taste was funky and artificial tasting.

My party of four did the tasting menu which consisted of 1. Sunchoke caramelized egg the egg was not to dry or wet but rather cooked to perfection. The  carmel was a nice compliment to the creaminess  of the egg.  2. Pig skin noodles with shrimp hot sauce though the sauce was not too hot which I loved. 3. Shiitake pasta with scrambled eggs and grilled broccoli, I generally do not like mushrooms but this was good as the whole dish   complemented one another in that the mushroom state was subtle. 4. Poached red snapper with koji butter and brussels sprouts again i normally dislike Brussels sprouts but the butter made it sweet and savory all in one bite. The fish was perfectly cooked. 5. Parsley croissant with bone marrow. the crust was perfectly  flaked and you could drink the marrow by itself it was so good. 6. Blackened Octopus, pork fired rice and cabbage yogurt. It was a beautiful char but the cabbage taste was a bit over whelming it took away from the seared taste and rice. 7. Fried Chicken smoked fish and caramelized pickles. Good mix of sweet and sour the breading on the chicken held in the state for a lasting after taste the lingered on the tongue. 8. Duck with salt roasted roots. A little to fatty and salty. 9 Cider vinegar pie apple, way to bitter. 9. Sunchoke crusted sunflower with meyer lemon. This was okay a bit sour. 10. A box of four homemade  chocolates perfection in a box. We forwent the paring and yet in the end spent just as much so I'd suggest the paring.

They advertise the sauce as being spicy...it isn't, but they have plenty of crushed red peppers you can add.\\n\\nThe ambiance leaves a lot to be desired.  It's very bland, and has a sterile corporate feel to the place.  There isn't a quiet or intimate nook to be found in the entire dining area, so I would not put Bugatti's on the list of \\"special night\\" restaurants.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the prices are a tad higher than you might expect for such a pedestrian in a suburban mall setting.  I don't think it's really OVER priced for the quality of the food (about $15-20), and you can save a few bucks if you stick with pastas (most in the $10-14 range).

We arrived at 8 A.M. and the cafe was not open until 9 A.M. So we decided to just walk around and come back around 8:50 A.M. By the time we came back, there was a LONG line. As we entered the restaurant, it was this feeling like \\"YES we have finally made it inside!!!!\\" I ordered the waffle with lavender chocolate and the first bite was amazing. My taste buds were telling me \\"I am in heaven....\\" I also ordered the Wolves Breakfast. This meal had different types of meat and the waiter explains to you which one is which. That was super duper delicious. Portion size was perfect. Not too big and not too small. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who is willing to come early and wait before the huge line comes or wait in line for quite a while.....

It sure is nice to have another option besides pizza for dinner! \\n\\nThe restaurant was hopping for a Tuesday night. It had a nice vibe to it, though the service was a little spotty. I trust that this will improve over time. \\n\\nMy first disappointment was, believe it or not, the tap water. It tasted really awful and tap water in Vancouver is generally delicious. What's up with that? Maybe it's the fault of the pitcher that the water was poured from? I came home and drank a big glass of tap water to make up for it.\\n\\nI ordered the fish of the day, which was salmon that came with lentils, carrots, and green beans. It was also supposed to come with chard and turnips, but those never made it on my plate. The fish was pretty bland and the veggies weren't enough to save the dish. \\n\\nMy wife ordered a few appetizers and asked to have them brought out as they were ready, but they brought them all out with my entree. It was fine, but we were hungry and wanted to start eating. Maybe the waiter wasn't listening or maybe he couldn't hear us because the music was quite loud. Her caramelized onion tart was really delicious and we really liked the cheese plate! She gave a lukewarm review to the Nicoise salad. \\n\\nWe wanted decaf and dessert. Unfortunately, they didn't have the lemon tart that I wanted or decaf. Instead we had the creme brulee and the chocolate mousse and they were both very good. \\n\\nOne nice thing about Les Faux Bourgeois is that portion sizes aren't huge and prices are reasonable. Another nice thing is that they give you the option to order vegetarian versions of several appetizers and they have one vegetarian entree on the menu.\\n\\n*Les Faux Bourgeois just opened so perhaps it is unfair to review them before they've been open for a full week and I really want to like this restaurant. Oh well, I'll review it for now and plan to return at which time I'll hopefully be able to do a review update and give them another star or two."},{"name":"El Chilito","address":"2225 Manor Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"So when the wait at Vivo is up to almost 2 hours, I highly suggest walking down the street to El Chilito to grab a few tacos and a frozen sangria.

There are no vegetarian items on the menu. They do offer green salad, red cabbage, and sauerkraut on the buffet, so you'll get your daily allotment of green veggies. Soup of the day - ham and bean. They do have pretzel bites as an appetizer.

There's plenty of outlets... they even have an extension cord with a surge protector that extends outdoors, WOW. Can we give Render a giant round of applause? Another thing that makes me love Render is that you don't need a key to go to the bathroom.

I thought the concept was fun, being a gigantic doughnut fan. \\n\\nUnfortunately, due to severe fish and shellfish allergies, I couldn't order anything fried in their fryers because they do not separate fish/shellfish from chicken or anything else on their appetizer or entree menu. (This is not uncommon in restaurants, but it was a huge bummer because I couldn't try many of the items in which I was interested.) The donuts are fried in a separate fryer, at least, so we didn't have to walk out.\\n\\nI had the chicken and dumplings, and my husband had the fried chicken tenders on a doughnut. The savory donut was insane - fresh fried, moist, steaming, delicious. The chicken and dumplings were awful - a watery, cream-colored broth with weird lumps floating in it for dumplings. I mostly used it to dunk the donut. My husband loved his entree, though, and said the fried chicken was pretty good.\\n\\nWe ordered a couple desserts to go - my husband and I ordered the Salty Balls. Consumed a couple hours later, it was actually pretty gross, but that might be because it was cold, leftover donuts. I'd give it another shot in the restaurant.\\n\\nThe main reason I cut so many stars is due to terrible service. We were seated quickly (no wait), but that's about the only thing we didn't have to wait for. It took forever for the waitress to take our drink orders, bring our drinks, take our orders, for the food to arrive, etc. After we placed our to-go dessert orders, we literally sat for 45 minutes waiting for them. Even for fresh-fried donuts, 45 minutes is pretty ridiculous. (The waitress DID handle my allergy-related questions graciously and professionally, so point in her favor.)\\n\\nEven though the concept is cool, I'd probably pass on this place and just check out the trailer for dessert doughnuts if I really had a craving."},{"name":"FLIP burger boutique","address":"1587 Howell Mill Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Summary:\\nThis is mainly a burger resteraunt as most of the main course are burgers but they also serve salads as well for those who do not want burgers. \\n\\nThere is music playing in the background that is normalish mostly but on occasion there have been some really odd songs  and it has 2 tvs that mainly play sports channels.\\n\\nRecomendations:\\nThe best burgers here in my opinion are the oaxaca and the BBC burger but my my family also likes the bbq one as Well.\\n\\nIn terms of appetizers and sides I would recommend the fried ocra and the fried with the smoked mayo.\\n\\nI would recommend you do not sit at the table in the middle of resteraunt as the seats are a bit uncomfortable."},{"name":"FLIP burger boutique","address":"1587 Howell Mill Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Best burger I've ever had.

They won't tell you until you are ready to pay that THEY DONT ACCEPT ANYthing except for Canadian Credit cards or Canadian currency.  We found it absurd of course and even felt like it is a scam...we had no Canadian credit cards nor Canadian money, with current USD-Canadian dollar at 1-1.26 exchange rate, owner offered to accept our US dollar at 1-1 given such excuse that he doesn't want to deal the exchange rate...long story cut short, we had to pay in USD at the 1-1 rate at the end...\\nService is definitely minimal if any.  We ordered quite a variety of food...their wontons are pretty good and portion is pretty big which is what my 1 star stands for.  Their beef shank and tripe seem stale if not too dried, flavor is ok.  I would avoid their salted/picked long bean w ground pork, it is too soggy.  I had Hunan style of salted beans before, I know it is different than Sechuan style which I prefer.  Flavor is not right, they might have picked the long beans too long.  I also ordered a lemon chicken for my 9 yr O, it came out in pieces like dark meant nuggets instead of the white meat 1 piece then cut in pieces. We ordered stirred fried iceberg lettuce, they gave us Romain lettuce.  The strawberry banana shake came out nothing like we had but watery looking and doesn't taste right and we saw they charge us for strawberry mango shake but still it didn't taste right.  The stirred fried spicy kidney w chili came out acceptable I will say and then their pan fried chive dumpling tasted ok for the fillings but the skin is way too thick.  \\n\\nWe accepted the food didn't turn out as expected and didn't complain a word about the mistakes or tastes but the way he asked us for the 1-1 USD for our bill in Canadian dollar was kind of ugly if that's legal at all...JUST BE CAREFUL"},{"name":"Clay Pit","address":"1601 Guadalupe St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I don't like Indian food, but a friend was having a birthday here so I sucked it up.  It was Sunday afternoon (1:00ish) so your only option was the buffet for $12.50.  The buffet was pretty decent.  Had about 7 different choices and they were all spice mild with the spices you could add on the side if you liked it hotter.  The food was warm but not hot.  They had a spinach and strawberry salad that was awesome.  The rest of the food was ok.  My friends really liked the mango fish but I didn't care for it.\\n\\nTheir nan was ok.  It was light, which was good, but they had burned one side of it on several of the batches we got, which was not good.  They do have several varieties of nan, though, and I really liked the one with the cherries and pine nuts in it.\\n\\nTheir mango cheesecake was AWESOME.  Some of the best, lightest, fluffiest cheesecake I have ever had.

We wanted to take them somewhere nice, so we searched yelp for some hip and happening restaurants. This one got great reviews and looked interesting, we were excited to give it a try! They wouldn't take reservations, so when we got there we had to wait an hour to be seated, no biggy! We just went to a place next door to have a beverage. We finally got sat, and waited for someone to come by and explain their ...very unique menu to us. Although the food was very unique, that wasn't what I was referring to. We had no idea how to actually order the food. We waited for quite a while until our server finally graced us with his presence. He asked with a smirk \\"need help ordering from the menu?\\" ...um yea. Is that what you gathered from leaning on the bar doing nothing for the past 10 minutes? We finally ordered some food and a couple bottles of wine. The food, like I said before, was very unique and boy did it come with a price! Everything tasted all unique and lovely whatever, but it was nothing special. It was nothing special considering the price you paid, and what you got. We had a couple meat dishes and one of them came in a broth. We were lit-trah-lee fishing for tiny scraps of meat in the bowl. It tasted great, for those of us lucky enough to snag a piece. There were only four adults eating from this plate, which was a large amongst other large meat dishes. Let's just say we didn't leave feeling too heavy. The dessert was wonderful, I have to say. We got the apple rhubarb pie and the crust was to die for! The overall atmosphere of the restaurant is very chic, hipster, and quaint. It was warm and inviting with open ceilings, and rows of mason jars containing fruits and veggies sitting on rustic wooden shelves.

Kevin, one of the managers, came out to great me personally and extended a very warm welcome back.  Our waitress, Phyllis, was very knowledgeable of the menu and knew all of of the upscale names of all of the dishes but was skeptical that were were as hungry as we said we were.  I told her that we had to have the Cheeseburger Sushi Roll that we both shared, and my lady loved it.  It is certainly one of our absolute favorites.  The Truffle fries are absolutely to do for, as they are drizzles with hot cheese and bacon, which was a sure delight.  I ordered the Bison burger for dinner.  Their burgers are half-pounders and are simply delicious.  I loved it and didn't remember it being so spicy but I thought it was a nice addition to the tender taste of the Bison.  She ordered her burger medium-rare and mine was cooked well-done.  There was absolutely no room for dessert.

I've brought friends and dates to this place and usually it is a pretty good hit.  It's an asian fusion restaurant located in the South End.  It really has never disappointed me once and overall the food, the service and the ambiance are just perfect.\\n\\nLike I've said already I've been here for dinner numerous times and have tried a variety of what they have to offer.  I just want to touch base on my favorite dishes off the menu.  Without a doubt my top favorite is the tea-smoked pork spare ribs.  They are so tender that the meat just falls off the bone.  I heard they smoke their ribs for 3 days before serving them!  I have to order this dish every single time I come back to this amazing place!  Some of my other favorites at this place are the pork belly buns, salmon, wok-roasted mussels, baby bok choy and the garlicky spicy coal-black wings.\\n\\nNow onto the cocktails.  Of course I have had my share of cocktails at this place and all of them have been very pleasing but the one that comes to mind is St. Shar Pei.  A very tasty cocktail and I think it goes really well with the ribs.  I also recommend their sangria (which tends to be made a bit strong which I enjoy) and Bitter Sweet Symphony (a nice citrus drink).\\n\\nThe service at this place was always been stellar.  Very attentive and always around when you need them.  I think it is a very good hipster like vibe that is provided within the restaurant.  It by no means screams out pretentious like most places in the South End.  \\n\\nI also actually got to meet Joanne Chang the first time I came here.  She is a very friendly and humble person.  I still admire her for leaving a corporate life job to pursue her love of cooking.  She opened up this restaurant back in 2007 with her husband and ever since then I have been coming back here for nothing but tasty portions.  She also is the pastry chef at Flour which I have yet to visit but definitely plan on visiting before leaving Boston.\\n\\nI keep coming back so I suggest if you haven't been here yet you should at least come try it and order those spare ribs!"},{"name":"Baby Acapulco","address":"13609 N I H 35","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"I have been here for happy hour and for dinner!

Interesting if this is a franchise and 'corporate calls the shots'. 2) The word 'Bonchon' refers to those wonderful Korean side dishes that come with any Korean meal -- odd that they serve none. 3) Definitely need some beer or saki with this cuisine.

I visited this new donut shop with a friend around 11am on a Sunday. Upon walking in, I was informed they were completely out of all \\"hole donuts\\" for about half an hour. Obviously, since most of the donuts they offer are \\"hole donuts\\" I was a little bummed that I couldn't try the donut I had seen on their menu. But, they did have their hard apple cider fritter available so I opted for that instead.\\n\\nAfter waiting for about 5 minutes or so for my fritter, it arrived in a little to-go box still warm from the fryer. It was deliciously crunchy on the outside while moist and hot on the inside. The hint of the hard apple cider was just perfect. Not to mention the fritter was pretty generous in size.\\n\\nBy the time I finished my donut, coffee and conversation, they had their hole donuts ready. I ordered a the blueberry, bourbon and basil donut to bring home for my husband. Personally, I thought it was tad too basil-y for my taste but then again...not a big basil fan. However, the texture of the donut was perfect.\\n\\nI can't wait to go back to try their maple-bacon donut that looked divine as well as their fried chicken and honey butter donut.

I've been coming here for about 4 months now and the food is always great.  One of the main reasons why like this place so much was because of the prices,  especially their breakfast menu.  Classic breakfast started at 4.75 and the jumbo was 6.75 or something close to that.  Their coffee is over priced for what it is.  I understand it's fair trade coffee and all but cmon...  Really, do you need charge for refills?  Since the meals were priced right I tended to look the other way and pay for the refills.  \\n\\nRecently,  as of June 15th their prices have gone up,  the classic breakfast is now $6.75 and the jumbo is now $8.75 with the price of coffee remaining the same.  So breakfast for 2 now is over 20 something there where as before is was about $12.00... Perfect for a quick and simple breakfast.  It's breakfast, and it's no frills and thrills, just good-ol breakfast.\\n\\n I would be ok with new prices if the lowered the prices of their basic black coffee and offered free refills.  Another option would be to offer a plain dark with cream and unlimited refills.  Either way , their stock went down in my book.  I hope they read the review and make some changes.  Being a business owner myself, I know about rising cost, but there might have been a better way of raising the prices.  Perhaps leave something like the classic at the same price point, leave out one link of sausage or bacon and have all the other items raised.  I would have been ok with that too.

This place has been on my list of restaurants to visit for months, if not longer.   Not sure it will make it back onto my list or not...\\n\\nThe place itself basically feels like a nice, high end sandwich shop - what I might describe as California casual.   Plastic chairs, some rug and some linoleum flooring, order at the counter, grab a seat and wait for your food to arrive.   They do have people helping out with drink refills, so you don't have to go back up to the counter for that.   Lots of natural light, which is nice...\\n\\nThe lunch menu is basically salads, soups and sandwiches (including a burger).   Everything is pretty spendy - most items are in the 8-12 range.   I had a roast beef and cheese sandwich, which was perfectly fine although not something I'd probably have again.   With chips and a drink it was around 11-12 bucks.   It was advertised as \\"made with Boarshead meat\\".   I think I can buy that at HEB, no?  My date had the blue plate special, which at $11 and change was clearly the deal of the day.   A large serving of very good meatloaf with mushroom gravy, excellent mashed potatoes, and some delightful (albeit a bit buttery) mixed vegetables.   \\n\\nFor the prices, the place just doesn't seem nice enough and should probably have table service instead of counter service.   We spent $30 for lunch, which seems a bit excessive... If you do go here, I'd probably try one of the very fancy sounding salads or have the blue plate special to get the best value for your money.   In my opinion, the sandwiches up the street at Food Heads are much better, more handcrafted and cost less, plus they have a great patio area.\\n\\nLooked at the dinner menu and apparently they have table service at night, but it is even more spendy at ~$20 per entree.   For around $80-100 out the door with an app, two entrees and some wine, I think I'd probably go elsewhere instead.

I got a manga margarita with sugar rim and she got a platinum margarita with a salt rim. They were both delicious. The sugar rim was tart and sweet which was surprisingly nice. For food I got the chicken fingers and fries which were pretty average in quality to be honest. The spinach artichoke dip that my friend got was AMAZING. If the review was just based on that dip it'd be five stars. She got the Mac and cheese burger which seemed pretty uninspired (literally just a burger with mac and cheese on top of the patty).

Factor in the pricing for mediocre food made it extra disappointing. Finally, some items on the bill were incorrect from the advertised and menu prices but by then we were so extremely hot and uncomfortable we didn't want to argue about the bill and just paid it so we could leave before someone passed out! Save your money and taste buds and go anywhere else but here!

At the window, however, the manager in an orange shirt (did not see her name but I wish I had) started immediately and LOUDLY chastising Jazzmin in an extremely condescending manner because she had accidentally added an item to our order that belonged to the car behind us. She basically went out of her way to humiliate this poor girl in front of us, while we waited, instead of simply quickly fixing the mistake and then later pulling her aside to talk about it. She even physically shoved her away from the computer and made a point to call over someone else to take the headset.

A dosa is a long thin crepe usually stuffed with potatoes, meat (if you want it--hence the lamb dosa recommendation), onions, and a coconut chutney.

The donuts there were just too good for words. When this B&M place came up on a Yelp search for brunch spots in Austin, we immediately headed that way. \\n\\nArriving around 11:00AM on a Sunday, we were seated immediately amongst about a 2/3 full house of eager diners. My wife ordered her usual diet Coke, and our friend and I ordered bloody marys, which arrived with a strip of bacon as a swizzle stick. Oh hellz yeah. :) They were spicy and strong, and that bacon added an awesome extra flavor to the classic drink. \\n\\nMoving on to the food, I selected one of the specials of the day, their version of chicken and waffles. It featured a big, round yeasty donut slathered with maple frosting, with an awesome \\"GB&D\\" pan fried chicken breast on top. I'll shamefully add that I've never eaten the Southern original chicken and waffles, but I've been intrigued by the combo. Oh, man, did this thing deliver. The donut was substantial without being heavy, and that frosting was just sublime, with its wonderful sugary texture and rich maple taste. The chicken was a dark golden brown, but not at all leaning towards overcooked. The combo of flavors from all of this were incredible. The sweet and salty, the combination of textures and flavors made for a fantastic dish. Best brunch dish EVER. \\n\\nFinally, to just finish the dietary blowout, I tried the \\"salty balls\\" for dessert (!), which featured small, puffy donut holes with salted caramel sauce and dry roasted peanuts. I'm a big salted caramel fan, so I had high hopes. It delivered, mostly, although I actually found the peanuts to be a little too much if there were too many in one bite. Flavorwise, though, it was as good as the other dishes here. Next time, I'll get the peanuts on the side and add them carefully. \\n\\nBottom line, it wasn't a completely traditional brunch, but the food was an absolute knockout and fully worthy of the Gordough's moniker. You gotta try it, seriously."},{"name":"There","address":"305 Brookhaven Ave, Ste 1200","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"This a great spot in Brookhaven and I'd recommend it to pretty much anyone.

It was a fine burger, except for how juicy it was.  Not that I want my burger dry, but my hands were soaked.  I'm a bit of a prissy eater, and I rarely need to use a napkin.  I went through three paper towels.  I also struggled to keep it all together, and wound up essentially wadding the burger up in my fist to eat it.  The brat was split in half, but those halves were still connected, so it created another shifting plate in the stack.\\nSo how do they measure up?  \\nGood:  I like the creativity of this burger.  The meat patty was certainly good, and I can't complain about anything else regarding the burger (other than it's sloppy, which Bill J had the same issue with his).  I'm looking forward to trying something else off the menu.\\nWe sat at the bar, because I HATE standing in line for food.  I like that you have an option.\\nI appreciated that you have seat service at the bar, but there's also a full drink bar so you can serve yourself on the way out the door.\\nThe fries were good enough to call good.\\nValidated parking in the garage behind.\\nMediocre:  if I'm eating at your location, give me a big glass of tea.

There are servers who bring out your food, but no one circulating with a jug of tea or water.  I guess if you don't sit at the bar it's all self serve, except for getting your burger.\\nBad:  and I don't even want to call it bad, but I dropped $15 for a burger (with no extras), fries, and tea.

I've been here a few times since I've posted about it, but many times I could not bear the long lines and have left.\\n\\nSince I always get the fricass√©, I took it upon myself to get something different.  The cassoulet ($15), with fried eggs on baked beans, saussison de Paris, double smoked bacon, and andouille.  Served in a piping hot cast iron skillet, I liked this, but the fricass√© still has a special place in my heart.  The beans were pretty good, and I really enjoyed the bacon.  I liked the bean ragout at La Cigale a bit more, but the beans here were softer and more suitable for brunch.\\n\\nEveryone else had a  fricass√© ($16) each.  The braised short ribs dish is always the most popular, and I unashamedly used the sauce to sop my own foccacia bread.  The meld of flavours from the watercress and tender beef is always good.\\n \\nThe lavender latte ($3.60) is always popular, but due to my coffee aversion, I can't say much.  Everyone seems to like it.  The mimosa I had was a good brunch complement.  The waffles ($3.15) are also a crowd-pleaser, but I think they're a bit overrated.  Yes, they are fluffy and good, but they're also quite overpriced.  The salted caramel topping ($1) -- one of my favourites -- was not good today and tasted overly burnt.  Overall, if you can bear the lines at Medina, it's definitely a nice option in the Gastown.

I went to Hopdoddy because several friends have raved about it, and I happened to be in the area and hungry.\\n\\nI walked in, and was wonderfully greeted by a staff member letting me know how things worked. To tired to remember his directions on ordering at the back, I instead opted for sitting at the bar and having the barstaff take my order and bring it to me.\\n\\nThe staff was great, helpful, and the meal came quick and as ordered.\\n\\nI ordered the Classic Cheese.\\n\\nI had perused the menu quite a while before making my decision so I could make sure I ordered something that was safe for me to eat.  No where on the menu does it state that they put seasonings or anything in the meat itself, so I did not even think to ask.  But I did make sure the staff listed for me anything that would be on the burger so I could make sure it came free of anything I shouldn't be eating. Normally this is enough precaution for burger ordering, however I will be changing my methods to ask ahead of time if the burger is 100% beef or if they add seasonings/fillers so this doesn't happen again.\\n\\nNevertheless, when the burger arrived and I took my first bite, I got a mouthful of onion/garlic.  I took apart the burger (again) to see if they or I had missed some stray onion on the top somewhere.  No, I found out later it is in the burger itself.  Since I am allergic to onion, and hate overt onion taste, I was very disappointed.  I even searched the menu again to see if I missed any kind of wording that would have given me hints to expect this. There was none.\\n\\nThe bun was ok, though it was bigger than the burger patty, it smooshed enough that the burger was not too bready. The toppings (lettuce, tomato) seemed of good quality, but could have used more tomato.\\n\\nThe fries were good as well and seasoned.\\n\\nStill a little concerned about the onion in the burger, I came home to email them. I wanted to make sure it was actual onion in the burger and not just some grill-contamination, or that I had missed the onion on top or something.. \\n\\nI went to their website, which has to be the most aggravating company website around. There is no contact information (no phone or email), no store hours, not even an address.. unless you actually download their menu (which I found later, I didn't download the menu at first because I wanted contact info not a damn menu cluttering my computer).  \\n\\nThen I found them on Twitter, and asked for contact info because I wanted to talk to them about food allergies and ask my questions in private.  I didn't want to \\"Follow\\" them on Twitter to DM. I simply wanted to get a few answers. They answered back the next day, not with contact info, but a \\"hey ask us here\\".. which it is hard to converse such subjects in 140 characters.\\n\\nI decide to just ask them about the onions in the meat. I send them a tweet, but didn't get a response back. I waited. No reply of \\"looking into it\\" or \\"I'll get back to you\\"...  until I actually decided on my own to follow them on twitter in case they wanted to DM me (which they responded very quickly in DM after I followed them).  They tell me to call them between 3-5pm 24 hours in advance, and talk to their manager to arrange things, and give them a time to expect me, and could I please come during a slow time?  but still don't give me their phone #. They however do not bother to follow me back so I can return their DM or continue the conversation. \\n\\nBy this time I livid. I finally do download their menu, and find their phone number there on the menu. And I now realize their phone number is here on Yelp.\\n\\nHopdoddy.. for future customers, please fix your website so we don't have to jump through hoops or search all over tarnation to do business with you.\\n\\nAll in all, I highly doubt I ever eat there again.

I've never served in the armed forces, but this task is completed with military precision. However, before I could make it out to Lakeline to complete the Austin Dillard's Trifecta, I had to refuel in a big way. I figured now was as good a time as any to try the deep dish pizza that N and K had said that BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse was known for. \\n\\nI never guessed they had a revolving door out front, since I never really grasped the size of the place when viewed off MoPac. The place is enormous; a slicker, pumped-up version of other chain restaurants with the added allure of doubling as a microbrewery. And while not as easily parlayed into cheap puns as 'Evil Wiener\\", don't think for a second the name \\"BJ's\\" didn't have me giggling a bit. I may have used one on Facebook when someone commented on my check-in, though (Gary: I LOVE BJ's! Me: Who doesn't?). \\n\\nMy God, was it busy. This was a Thursday. You'd think the damned Super Bowl was on the way everyone was packed in like sardines around the bar. A bar, according to K, that uses hundreds of bottles of top-shelf liquor simply for show. Expensive items just for show? That's so up my alley. My little electronic beeper even had a note that said you could call ahead to put your name down as you leave the house. I guess that was for the days when EVERYONE in Austin decided to show up for chow, and not just half of the city like I witnessed.  \\n\\nThe hostess said there'd be a 5-10 minute wait, which I found suspicious when she told the same thing to three other people who came in after me and absolutely no one was leaving the restaurant. I sat down on the only free edge of a bench to ride it out, even though a charming couple was taking up the enter thing. The man made a token movement down to give me more room, but the chick decided to remain splayed out. Keeping it classy, I see. \\n\\nOnce I was seated, the din of noise and constant movement didn't stop. Raucous groups of people were knocking back micro brews; a Paris Hilton look-alike and her super hot boyfriend were chatting; and three moms and about a dozen kids rounded out the table next to me. Apparently, BJ's attracts a lot of different people. \\n\\nI began with a Tatonka¬Æ Stout -- \\"A classic style so rich and flavorful that it was once the private beverage of Russian Czars....Beer doesn't get much more intense than this!\\" It's delicious and tastes like Guinness. It also makes you feel you've just drank a loaf of bread. \\n\\nIt was an extensive menu, with token light fare. I started with the small bite version of the fresh mozzarella and tomato salad. On top of a nice presentation, the appetizer was surprisingly flavorful, with basil, red onion, Parmesan cheese, and a balsamic glaze that mixed beautifully. It's a nice, light appetizer to hold you over before a heavier entree. An entree such as BJ's Classic Combo deep dish pizza with pepperoni, sausage, and mushrooms.\\n\\nThe pizza is brought out and placed on a raised platform. It was cooked perfectly--not too crispy, and not too doughy. No one ingredient overpowered the other, and the cheese and sauce ratio was spot on. They were a little light on the mushrooms, but the Italian sausage was actually quite flavorful, and not just greasy little fat pellets like they can be. The waitress suggested a size \\"small\\" for one hungry person, and the portion was correct. A medium could be split, and I'm not sure how many people are meant to chow down on a large. \\n\\nThanks to their flashy slideshows by the bar, I was made privy to the existence of something called a Triple Chocolate Pizookie¬Æ: An obscene chocolate cookie made with chunks of Ghirardelli chocolate and topped with two scoops of double chocolate ice cream with Ghirardelli chocolate chips and a Ghirardelli dark chocolate square. Oh--it's chocolate, FYI, in case you missed that. I only ordered it because I love Ghiradelli, having visited the factory during a trip to San Francisco. \\n\\nThe waitress thankfully informed me that this dessert came in a mini size. Thank God, because what was described above would have sent me into sugar shock before the bill arrived. It may have skirted the line of decadence and tackiness just a bit, but you know it was awesome. \\n\\nOur waitress was polite and seemed remarkably composed during what I can only imagine was a veritable sh*tstorm of activity. She and a couple other waitresses who brought me my food were all blonde, attractive, and somewhat interchangeable. No one missed a beat, though, and the service was punctual during the entire meal.\\n\\nI know that it's a chain, and it's a little loud and cramped, but BJ's pleasantly surprised me. I'd suggest it to fans of beer, pizza, and those who don't mind crowds. \\n\\nAt the end I was glad there was a revolving door. After THAT meal, you could have practically rolled me out.\\n\\n4 Stars."},{"name":"FLIP burger boutique","address":"1587 Howell Mill Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Not a fan!

Plus Chipotle came in when Tortilla's (RIP) was closing down and I had some loyalty there.  \\n\\nNone the less- I had a free coupon so my friend and I went and grabbed some lunch.  I had a burrito bowl- i don't know why it is called a burrito bowl.  It had lime cilantro rice (it was bright white) which was not over the top cilantro-fied.  I am NOT a cilantro fan so that was a plus for me.  I had guacamole, cheese, pinto, and black beans as well as the hot salsa.  The hot salsa was really great (it made my nose run a bit!!) and the guacamole was not super garlic-y which I loved.  There was no way anyone should eat the whole thing- it was a lot of food!!!!  It tasted very fresh and I really did enjoy it.  \\n\\nThere is not a HUGE selection of items that you can have added to a burrito/ taco/ bowl but the stuff seems to be good.

Yes, I'm looking at you and shaking my head, P.F. Chang.\\n\\nWalking down Washington St., you probably wouldn't even notice the building that houses this restaurant. And yet, the moment you open the door and step in, there it is in all its glory. The decor is a mix of urban chic/hipster/casual/upscale/relaxed. That is to say, you can make it out to be whatever you want. Whether its the start to a girls night out, a birthday celebration or a first date, the interior delivers well. You can be in a dress or in jeans and fit right in. The tables are set up with table mats made out of an old Chinese  (?) newspaper, that was interesting..\\n\\nOnto the food - the menu is broken out by dish size, so you go from your appetizers to the midsized items to the larger items that can easily be shared by 2-3 people. We ordered the pork belly buns and crispy spring rolls (w/ bamboo and shiitake mushrooms) for starters.. both were very tasty and the pork belly buns were a favorite on our table. We also got the fish tacos (that come with a kimchi sesame salsa and crispy duck fried rice (special). The fish tacos, ironic as it is to order that at an Asian fusion restaurant, were unbelievable. The fish tasted fresh and the salsa wasn't overwhelming at all. Now fried rice tastes very generic, but it came with some mustard/curry tasting sauce that had a zing to it, and made a big difference to a regular dish. For dessert, we went with the crowd favorite - coconut cream pie. And I'm glad we did. The cream is super fluffy and light and the coconut shavings bring out a very slight coconut flavor without taking over every bite. Amazing!\\n\\nFor drinks, I got the Asian Mojito (mojito made with Sake) which tasted milder than other drinks on the table. The homemade sodas are delicious so try one with or without soju. \\n\\nI'm not sure how easy it is to get a table if you walk right in during dinner time so I'd recommend reserving one.

But it was so delicious and so worth it!\\n\\nSo what do you do when you're only able to sample one drumstick? You go back the next day and order some more chicken! And that's exactly what we did. We got there right when they opened and was seated right away. Again, I got the 2 Piece Dark but this time I was able to eat both pieces. Score! And it was just as mouthwatering as the day before. \\n\\nMy husband also ordered a breast. I was able to sample a bite since I'm not usually a fan of chicken breast. White meat is already dry to start off with. Having it fried on top of that usually doesn't make it any better. So I was pleasantly surprised when I took a bite and it was just as juicy as the dark meat!\\n\\nThe sides were excellent as well. The seasoned fries was cooked to perfection. The mac n cheese was moist; definitely not out of the box. The baked beans were sweet, which I was not expecting. But it tasty nonetheless. I thought the slaw was decent. (Had to have a bite since it's been days since I had any green.)\\n\\nGus's is a MUST if you're a foodie!\\n\\nPS. I'm happy/sad that they have multiple locations in LA. Happy because now I don't have to go to Austin to eat yummy fried chicken!

Really, Clay Pit is 2 different restaurants - the affordable lunch buffet and the more upscale dinner menu\\n\\nThe buffet is very reasonably prices at around $8.75 per person. You get fresh naan to your table and the buffet consists of salads, 2 rotating soups, rices, 3 rotating curries, tandoori chicken, and a rotating dessert. This is how all buffets should be done: quality over quantity. There's always at least 1 good curry per day (Thursday is the best, that's meatball korma day) and the chicken is really outstanding. It's cheaper than many a la carte Indian lunch spots so there's no reason why you should ever get your Indian lunch fix anywhere else.\\n\\nThe dinner is also amazing. Lamb Korma is my favorite dish so I've eaten it at basically every Indian restaurant in Austin and Clay Pit is the best by a mile.

Did I find an Italian restaurant with good enough food to venture off Hanover street and not be another tourist trap in the North End?...just like the Harry Potter books you gotta keep reading:)\\n \\nSunday evening is a slow night in the restaurant world but not in the North end where it's always busy and you could always find a ton of slick hair back individuals standing outside their restaurants giving you their sales pitch and inviting you in.\\n \\nI chose Trattoria Di Monica because of the many recommendations from others and we wanted to try something not on the busy street.  The place is located on Prince Street and it's close to everything. There was a parade going on that night and our reservation was for 7. We walked up and told the front entry person that we needed a table and she took us in right away and sat us toward the back of the restaurant; close to the kitchen area.\\n \\nThis place is small and the tables are all very close to each other. I'm guessing around 8 to12 total tables. I like the inside interior because of the different art on the wall and the cozy feel of this restaurant. This place doesn't try to pretend and be something it's not. It's also very loud but that's true for almost all north end restaurants. If I wanted quiet I could have gone to my local library.\\n \\nWe sat down and started looking at the wine menu. The same person who sat us down came to us and asked if we had a reservation...that's a strange practice because normally you ask that before you sit the party down. She came back ten minutes later and said our table was for another reservation and that we needed to be moved...we had to get all of our stuff and move to another table...we didn't mind moving but if she checked our reservation upfront she could have sat us in the right place from the beginning.\\n \\nI heard great things about the food and we wanted to try as much as we could to get a full taste. For apps we tried the caprese and the spinach mushroom salad. The spinach was hot not soggy and the mozzarella was very fresh tasting. Two simple dishes and both tasted great.\\n\\nNext we had the spinach ravioli and Gnocchi Bolognese. The gnocchi was melt in your mouth good!.. I loved the sauce!...tried a little of the spinach ravioli and it was very rich!\\n \\nThen we ordered the Roasted Veal stuffed and Saut√©ed chicken with mushroom. The chicken was just chicken and nothing stood out and the mushroom didn't add much to it. It tasted good but it was forgettable. The veal tasted bland and the wrapped  prosciutto made the dish very heavy.\\n \\nI felt very rushed in this restaurant. We sat down at 7 and left by 8:15. That's Domino's Pizza delivery guarantee fast! We had 3 courses and a desert. I felt like they had a timer on each table and they wanted to turn over the table as soon as possible. There were a couple of instances when I was going through my plate and they walked over and tried to clear the plate before I finished. Another time I was in the middle of the conversation and they came by and interrupted. \\n \\nWe decided to try their tiramisu and the same time they brought it along came the bill. I have never been to a restaurant where the check comes out the same time as the desert...pizzeria Uno's doesn't even do that!\\n \\nThe food is definitely good here but classy restaurants let you enjoy the food and give you room and space to converse and enjoy the alcohol. This place is good but I wasn't overly impressed. I recommend this place if you need to eat dinner under an hour.\\n\\nTrattoria Di Monica shouldn't try the Giacomo's \\"eat your food fast and get out\\" approach because even though the food is delicious; they don't have the twenty plus people standing outside dying to get in.  \\n\\nVerdict: Fuggedaboudid"},{"name":"Windy City Pizza","address":"516 Gallivan Blvd","city":"Dorchester","stars":"2.5","text":"Buffalo Chicken Pizza.

After all, for the most part, I've stuck to writing reviews on 'better' or 'good' places.  \\n\\nI tell you, a bad review looks like a pile of fetid garbage. A bad review also resembles a rat caught in a sticky trap. \\nor maybe roaches crawling over the left-over pizza you wanted to have for breakfast.\\n\\nBut since I can't/don't want to chat about those things, I'll have you know that a bad review looks a lot like Buffet Palace, so let's get to it...\\n\\nI tend to not eat at buffet-type places, reason being that I'm just not into the whole 'human trough' thing, you know? Call me elitist or whatever, but buffets generally are the not the way one should enjoy food, as you're generally going for quantity over quality. \\n\\nThat said, once upon a time, because Andrew was hungry, was coming out of a movie and was craving Chinese food, he immediately gravitated to Buffet Palace. \\n\\nAt first, I thought that it seemed like a pretty respectable buffet. The place was newer and nice looking on the inside, and the buffet itself takes up quite a large portion of the space. There are TONS upon veritable tons of different kinds of food available here.  \\n\\nThat said, these are the two things that are keeping this sad sack of a place from a flat 1.\\n\\nCalling what you eat here 'food' is kind of like crediting George W. Bush with a modicum of 'smarts'...it's just not really that accurate of a statement. There is mass produced food, and then there is mass produced food that looks nice.  Everything at Buffet Palace certainly looks appetizing, but in reality, once you start making the transition of the food from your plate to your mouth, that's where the problems begin...and call me crazy...but that's a hell of a problem to have when you're in the business of serving up food. \\n\\nI remember the first bite of food I had from my plate tasting a little like A) children's paste, B) a verp (for those not in the know, that's a burp that has a little bit of vomit mixed in for fun and foulness) and C) death. What does death taste like? It  resembles what the 4th part of a bad review looks like. See above.\\n\\nGeneral Tso's tasted like re-runs of General Hospital; kind of edible/watchable but not something you want long term. \\n\\nThere was some kind of barbecue something-or-other on a stick that looked amazing, but I think I would've done better by trying to figure out how many licks it takes to get to the center of a soap-on-a-rope in a prison shower.  \\n\\nThe noodles in the chicken lo-mein were stringy, slimy and lukewarm...three things that I do not want to think of when I'm trying to eat noodles. The chicken was...I don't know...maybe chicken? Maybe it was a pigeon?  The vegetables were  limp and not-so-fresh. It was kind of like they microwaved some vegetables yesterday and nobody ate them, so they saved them, mixed them in while they were making the day's gruel, and just tossed it in with the dishes that required limp, not-so-fresh vegetables. Gross.\\n\\nThere were two severe kicks in the arse. One a large deep tray of crab legs. Seriously...I wanted to barge through the kitchen door and scream at whomever the 'cook' was. These things were naaasty. I poked at one with the serving tongs, and because the shells had been exposed to a lot of 'wet', they were becoming pretty soft...soft enough to put a little crack in one at my gentle and grossly fascinated prodding.  The other one was the sushi. Come on, man...are you KIDDING ME?! Does someone actually think I'm going to try raw fish from a place that can't even get cooked mass food...cooked FRIED food...down? I'd rather shoot multiple BBs into my ear, hoping that the force from one after the other would eventually shove one deep into into my brain so that I would cease to live rather than eat anything remotely resembling sushi from Buffet Palace.\\n\\nThis one is not a winner, friends.

Dancing Goat's Decatur shop is HUGE, and has a ton of tables as well as comfy chairs. This was one of the major reasons I chose them on the day I did: I had a lot of work to do, and they advertise free internet.\\n\\nI got my coffee and a pastry, set up my computer, and prepared to work. When I went to log on, I found no internet. So, I went up to the counter and asked, to which I was told \\"we are having problems with it, but are working on it.\\" I took this to mean that they were working on it at that time, so I waited. Alas, after another 20 minutes, I asked again, to which I was told, no, nobody was working on it right then, and it had been out for more than a week. I asked why there was no sign or notice posted anywhere about the internet being out, to which the baristas asked me why I needed it. I also asked how it could be out for a week without getting fixed, to which I was told it wasn't a priority.\\n\\nLet me stop here and say that I think a coffee shop with broken internet is like a hotel with a broken water heater. Technically, nobody needs hot water, and a hotel can still function without it, but people check in expecting to be able to take a shower. The same is true about internet and coffee shops like Dancing Goats; when you advertise free internet and lots of space to work, people expect internet and lots of space to work. I can understand internet going down suddenly, but for a coffee shop to be without internet for a week is ridiculous.\\n\\nDancing Goats has descent coffee, but it wasn't out-of-this-world either.

The word Kobe is used in place of Wagyu as a marketing ploy to make you feel special.

Not to mention it was WELL done when I specified I wanted medium. I sent it back and got a new one but by the time the waiter came by for me to ask, my friend was done eating so I got it to go.

Not sure what the deal is with the other reviews complaining that they had trouble getting service with English as all the servers I've encountered had no issues communicating in English. \\n\\nParking is a pain in the ass as it is in Aberdeen Centre but for those that don't drive, it is conveniently located next to a SkyTrain station. \\n\\nAs an added bonus, this location has a Chatime bubble tea stand in the restaurant and you can order one with your meal. \\n\\nTL;DR fantastic Taiwanese beef noodles, handmade fresh and cooked perfectly al dente"},{"name":"El Sazon De Gto","address":"1803 Cuernavaca Dr","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Wow.

Food prices are a tad higher than I would have expected for pub fare, but worth it in flavor and quality. Love that the space is so big that there is plenty of seating right up at the bar. \\n\\nAwesome for a late night spot, can't wait to come back."},{"name":"Ebi-Ten","address":"388 Robson Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Fantastic value! A good fast Japanese lunch or snack in a pinch - authentic, good options and reliable quality. It is not at all fancy but you really can't get better for the price.

I didn't know it was a vegan bakery at first and I just went in because the sign was cute, honestly. I got a chocolate cupcake, and it was literally the best cupcake I've ever eaten. I can't really describe how good it is. Everyone needs to go and try it so they can see that vegan baking is delicious!"},{"name":"Blue Star Donuts","address":"1155 SW Morrison St, Ste 102","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Don't fall into the tourist trap known as VooDoo.  Visit a place where a donut connoisseur would call heavenly home.  The flavor combinations here all speak for themselves and live up to their names.  No over the top gimmicks allowed.  The Blueberry Bourbon and Basil is my favorite with the Apple Cider Fritter a close second.  A must visit!"},{"name":"Hopdoddy Burger Bar","address":"1400 S Congress Ave, Ste A190","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Best burger in town in my opinion. Went for the first time during SXSW, and even in the throes of all of that madness and a long line to the counter, the staff were really friendly and helpful. Highly impressed.

There was a Roast Pork and rice that sounded kind of good. They also have spring rolls and a bunch of other stuff. I really need to grab a menu and scan it in, I'm forgetting a lot of it. Most entrees come with a choice of chicken, beef, pork or shrimp.\\n\\nI stopped by today and grabbed the pad woon sen, stir fried clear noodles that came with cabbage, green onions, green peppers, carrots, and shrimp. They asked me if I wanted it hot and I said yes. Took a little while, but I got a very large container of good fresh food, two meals for me and I can eat like nobody's business. It included a little container of sriracha and one of soy sauce, but when I got it home I found that I liked it slathered in fish sauce. I'm not a connoisseur of this dish, and I had to cut it up a bit because the noodles were sticking together but I scarfed half of it and loved it. It was not all that spicy hot, was a little disappointed there.\\n\\nFor that price I can have supper and lunch the next day, and it's just right on my way home from the airport. I'll definitely be back. I do really wish they had green curry. Ah well, I'll try the red next time. \\n\\nOh, and cash only, please."},{"name":"Nine Bar Espresso","address":"11 Holland St","city":"Somerville","stars":"4.5","text":"Nice shop good coffee, not friendly at all.

Flew in from San Diego for business & stayed across the street.  Restaurant popped up as a dining option on iPad; doesn't look too pretty from the outside, but truly worth eating at.  Had the chili (needed some spice for my liking), the blue ribbon house salad was refreshing & had a delicious gorgonzola vinaigrette, the biscuits were homemade (guess that's normal for southern cooking?) and the special of the day: parmesan coated grouper with mixed veggies and mashed potatoes (typically comes w/ rice but I'm a potato gal & they generously substituted) was to die for.  A bit heavy on the butter for frying purposes, but when your in the south....\\n\\nVery friendly atmosphere, a \\"usuals\\" type of a place. Generous portions.
