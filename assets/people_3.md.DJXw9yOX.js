This was a definitely a dinner to remember!  First off, this is one of those types of places where when you walk in, you FEEL cool.  The d√©cor was beautiful right down to the artistic works displayed in every direction as well as the Chihuly chandelier over the bar.  However, the food really steals the show.  Not only did every item taste delicious, but it was such a treat for the eyes - such an artistically orchestrated aesthetic experience.  (I will warn you - we really ate a lot!)  The Spring Market Salad with wheat berries was not just an every day salad - nothing about this restaurant's food is \\"every day\\".  So clean, so inventive, genius.  The oysters and Hamachi Sashimi couldn't have tasted more fresh like they were caught from the water an hour before. Scallops were sweet, creamy and the parsnip puree it sat on complimented it so well.  We had one of the dumplings with porcini mushroom sauce - yum!  I had filet mignon and husband had the rotisserie roast of the day: Ribeye.  Both were cooked to perfection!  There are 4 exquisite complimentary sauces to choose from - our favorites were the \\"Liquid\\" Red Pepper and the Truffle Jus.  The Mamaliga polenta side dish paired so well with these entrees - we devoured it! It had a cheese on it we were unfamiliar with - Brynza - which is a sheep's milk cheese.  Delicious!  Dessert was truly a feast for the eyes and mouth - it was an elegant party on a plate.  We had the La Beaute de Nuit - and let me tell you, it certainly was!  As we were finishing our gastronomic adventure, we noticed one of the esteemed chefs wheel a roasted suckling pig to a large party.  Looked amazing.  The service, by the way, was impeccable.  Each server was as polite, professional and knowledgeable as the next.  In a nutshell, you can't possibly go wrong with dining at Liquid Art House.

The waitstaff is very friendly and the service is usually quick and attentive.  The prices are reasonable (dinners are $9-12 for fried noodle dishes, $14-18 for fish and more elaborate fair), and the food is not as heavy or greasy as most Thai places.  The atmosphere is relaxed, yet tasteful (thankfully the blinking Christmas lights that seem to be a fixture at all Thai restaurants have now been relegated to a space behind some plants.) They have also recently redone their menus, adding large photos and very descriptive text, which should be helpful to newbies.\\n\\nNothing on the menu particular stands out, though the Tom Yum is good, as are most of the noodle dishes (Pad Thai, Pad Woon Sen, Pad See Eew).

There's a counter where you place your order. There are only 3 items. We got the one that Olivia T. recommended.. the one with cheese called Doria. You get to choose cheddar or mozzarella or half and half. We went with mozzarella this time.  You also get pickled daikon that's red (I think it's daikon) and if you want you can have more pickles. You also can get spinach and a hard boiled egg. We went for the whole gamut.  Lived it up we did. It's a brown colored curry dish. It comes with nicely cooked rice underneath it all.  I am thinking this dish is something that the japanese families eat on a regular basis..  What I really know is that it's a comfort food. And you eat it with a spoon.\\n\\nNot sure though on the whole location of the place. It just seems so big for this type of food. The place does not feel as cozy as the food does, though they do have some japanese books around, and the lighting is not too bad either.

I love that they have their own vineyard so you know exactly where they pick their grapes. The land is covered in luscious trees, different types of decks and patio areas that you can find anything you want. We were told we'd have to wait a little over an hour. We ended up visiting Salt Lick cellars and buying a 6 pack of beer while we waited. We only ended up waiting 45 minutes so that was exciting. When we sat down and looked at the menu, we knew we were going to get the all-you-can-eat. You get unlimited plates full of brisket, sausage, and pork ribs with sides. The bbq was amazing and the brisket was extra moist. We got the end chair of one side of the brisket and man, I could eat that forever. I'm not a huge sausage fan, but the sausage was amazing. The pork ribs were my favorite. I don't know what they did to that but I could have eaten those all night. The sides were unremarkable.

You can get a couple varieties of meat (roast beef, bacon, turkey, chicken, etc.) or a vegetarian alternative (babagnosh, falafel, hummus). \\n\\nIf you have astigmatism and are unsure of what meat choices are offered on the bulletin board behind the cashier you can just look to the right wall where there is a large picture of cartoon meat products with the phrase \\"Meat The Group\\" underneath. There's many caricatures of food stuffs with big smiles and obvious names, and if you look real hard you can figure them out.\\n\\nThe ad scheme in this place is eerie and kind of makes me cringe like when you watch a girl slip and fall on the icy sidewalk only to get up smiling with tears in her eyes because she just wants things to be okay and everyone to be happy. The fact that I often walk by the sidewalk sign and under the big banner through the door and the place is dead empty only heightens this feeling (although this could be deceiving because they deliver, and I tend to eat at off times).\\n\\nI feel like there is a real disconnect between the large eyed beaming french fry named Frenchie and what it actually must be like to work here. The staff is generally pretty cool though and it reminds me alot of another chain called DP Dough- which use to employ alot of alternative slackers- maybe with shag or dreds and/or a beard, possibly with extended lobes, listening to Stone Temple Pilots- showing that the style of the aforementioned cartoons on the walls isnt the only thing with a slightly dated vibe.\\n\\nThe price for a chicken breast pita is 5.50. You can generally use that as a guide to approximate the price of other pitas, with beef costing more, and veggie costing less. \\n\\nThey have a fountain machine and bottled drinks there, but since this place makes me yearn for Radio 104 Fests of old I always run across the street to the convenient store and get a Yoohoo. \\n\\nWhen you first walk in there will be tables off to your left and an ally alongside the counter directly in front of you. Orders are placed at the end of the counter and the customers back track parallel to the line to the behind-the-plexiglas food station to choose what you want them to put in it. Behind the counter is a flat sheet metal grill where they'll heat up the meat and chop it for you; you can have them throw cheese on the meat if you want it melted. \\n\\nWatch the veggies they put in, sometimes they look a little stale (mushrooms or lettuce might look a little brown or old). This doesnt matter to me since veggies often look more degraded than they actually are shortly after chopping, but i'm sure there are plenty of privileged Brooklinities that care.\\n\\nOnce they've loaded it with veggies, they have a couple dressings they can throw on. They use to have blue cheese but they no longer have it and I secretly suspect it is because it doesnt come out of a squeeze bottle on account of the chunks so they would have to undo the top each time and pour it out with time consumeing limited success.  \\n\\nLike this review, this place tries really hard but I think its ultimately depressing, especially since its right next to Wings Over Brookline which has a product so good they could cock slap everyone who walks through the door and they'd still have a 20 minute wait time."},{"name":"The Salty Pig","address":"130 Dartmouth St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Great relative value for the area.

Although it was dark and rainy we could still glimpse the Japanese garden outside, which really added to the serenity of the atmosphere.\\n\\nWe decided to order an unknown dish, shabu-shabu, which ended up being very similar to fondue or Korean BBQ. Our waiter brought the burner over along with plates of beef, three kinds of mushrooms, tofu, onions, spinach, and other greens. He and an older waitress explained how to eat the dish to us. I can't remember the waitress's name, but she was fantastic. She was very sweet, personable, and attentive.\\n\\nI would definitely recommend the shabu-shabu. It paired very nicely with the sake we ordered and everything was fresh and delicious.

Not the best discount for a voucher deal - basically free desserts - but a good enough excuse to try someplace new to me that had fish tacos among its offerings - mmm... fish tacos....\\n\\nParking wasn't too difficult - we noticed a spot right outside of Acitron, but didn't want to make a U-turn so we parked on a small residential street a short walk away.\\n\\nWe were given our choice of tables and without askance, our party of two was situated at a four top table by the wall.  Perfect for parties sharing food!  A basket of chips and salsa came shortly after.  The chips were of good consistency and thickness, as they broke easily in my hands (on purpose), yet not in the dip, which was not too spicy for this spice wimp.\\n\\nService was terrific, with suggestions offered freely once I opened the paths of communication.  Sure, my water glass remained empty for a short time twice, but our server was cheerful and friendly, and we could see that the two sole servers were getting more busy as additional parties arrived.  But understanding our decided lack of spice tolerance, our server considerately had all our sauces served on the side.\\n\\nFor our first course, we went with two appetizers:\\n\\n. Sopes Surtidos $6.95 Three assorted sopes : potato and mexican chorizo, mexican style shredded chicken and cactus salad with cotija cheese\\n\\n. Quesadillas Surtidas $7.95 Two flour tortillas filled with oaxaca cheese and shredded pork, poblano pepper strips and portabella mushrooms\\n\\nAlthough the first had caught my imagination more off the menu, the second ended up winning on taste.  But then I am a flour tortilla girl (vs corn).  As for the three topped mini corn tortillas (made to order!), my preference was the vegetarian cactus salad (although I wasn't sure where the cactus was, as I mainly spied diced tomatoes) due to its refreshing nature, followed by the potato & chorizo.  Each was maybe 3 inches in diameter - perfect for a party of two to each have a taste.\\n\\nThe first entree was an easy choice - Tacos De Pescado $15.95 Fresh tilapia seasoned and pan saut√©ed, garnished with red cabbage, avocado, cilantro and chipotle aioli, which arrived 3 well filled tacos to a plate.  For a non-fried version, I found these to be rather tasty, and I preferred it over our other entree - Camarones Con Salsa Cilantro $18.95 Saut√©ed jumbo shrimp in a creamy cilantro sauce.  My DC's preferences, however, were in reverse.  At a count of 6 good sized shrimp to an order, this was nothing to sneeze at, but weird-me preferred the cilantro sauce as a dip for the remaining chips vs as accompaniment with the shrimp.\\n\\nWe both gave the side top billing to the corn.  Each of their entrees come with a choice of two of the following three options you see: Rice of the day, Beans of the day or Elote (corn on the cob).  So we opted for two of the corn and one each of the beans (black) and rice (Spanish?  We were in a Mexican restaurant.).  The corn was tasty, a bit charred in spots, utterly covered in aioli and cheese, and conveniently stuck with sticks to daintily hold onto.  The beans were tasty, but quite wet.  The rice, however, though well flavored, was unpleasantly mushy in texture.\\n\\nBefore dessert, my top choice was the Tres Leches $7.25 Sponge cake soaked in three kinds of milk, condensed milk, evaporated milk and media crema (mexican table cream).  After dessert, it was the Flan Del Dia $6.75 Flan of the day - ask your server for details (Caramel).  The Tres Leches had a bit of an off taste in my opinion, and wasn't nearly as soaked as I wanted it to be.  The flan, however, was dense, smooth, creamy - yum!\\n\\nAfter 3 courses each, we were stuffed, and I still took home half the quesadilla and the third fish taco.  When I peeked at my take-out bag, however, I noticed that our server had also packed the pico de gallo and the cilantro sauce!  Yup, T-riffic service here!\\n\\nNote: their bathrooms are individual, gendered and handicap accessible, but in the ladies' room, be sure to slide the lock, as I discovered that the door knob button didn't really lock anything."},{"name":"Joy Teriyaki","address":"18010 NE Glisan St","city":"Gresham","stars":"4","text":"Food is affordable and great.

A host met us outside and seated us immediately in one of their two large dining rooms.  Walking into the restaurant, we walked past the food prep area with a large open pit where a glorious array of meats were being grilled and the smell of wood smoke filled the air.\\n\\nOur food and drink order was taken promptly.  I only wanted water, but for those wanting beer, wine or liquor, Salt Lick was BYOB.  I got the Thurman's Choice, a combo platter with brisket, a pork rib, and a sausage.  It came with a side of potato salad (the only disappointment out of everything I had), cole slaw (perhaps the best cole slaw I've ever had), and baked beans.  Bread, pickles, and onions were also provided upon request.  The brisket had the requisite smoke ring, was nicely seasoned, and was moist, juicy, and flavorful.  The rib meat was fall of the bone, juicy, and flavorful.  The sausage seemed to be filled with a coarser ground of nicely seasoned and spiced beef and pork, which was preferable to me, compared to many sausages I've had, as it seemed less dense, juicier and picked up more smoke than others.  Not that I needed more food, I couldn't resist ordering a 1/2 lb. of brisket, which allowed me to also try the burnt ends.  The burnt ends were meaty, moist chunks of brisket that possessed a delicious smoky char.  For me, it was the perfect \\"dessert\\".  Service throughout our visit was fast, friendly, and efficient.  My water glass was always kept full without prompting.\\n\\nTo sum up my experience, this was the barbecue that I have been craving for a long time.  The DC-area simply doesn't have anything that comes close.  If you come for lunch, get there early as it filled up quickly and a good-sized line had formed by the time we left.  Also, bring cash since they don't accept credit cards.  Salt Lick BBQ has set my new standard to which all other barbecue will be compared."},{"name":"Raglan Road Irish Pub","address":"1640 E Buena Vista Dr","city":"Lake Buena Vista","stars":"4","text":"So glad that I chose this place for lunch.

I've been to Chambar twice in the last month and have been completely and utterly disappointed on both occasions. \\n\\nFirst, was dinner. Although we had a reservation, it took us way too long to check-in for our table. There was only one flustered hostess working the front door, so it took a while to even be acknowledged upon arriving. \\n\\nOnce we were seated, our server was slow, inattentive and unhelpful. It took her about 10 minutes to bring us waters upon arriving, and then she would sporadically disappear and re-appear throughout the night, and was never around when needed. Tables around ours that had been seated after us received their drinks and food before we did. The food was mediocre, at best. I had the beet carpaccio (a classic Chambar dish, I'm told...a little boring), the coquotte moules et frites (too salty, not enough umami) and we shared a sour cherry pavlova dessert (fine, but not great). My date had the boeuf and champignon appetizer followed by the lamb tagine. He definitely chose the better meal than me.\\n\\nToday was brunch. Our table got a large, secluded booth at the very back of the restaurant. It was about 11:00 in the morning when we arrived and the morning sun was pouring into the restaurant. Unfortunately, the sun was shining right into our booth for our entire service. Now, Chambar has just undergone an extensive renovation. The interior is well-appointed and clearly \\"designed.\\" One thing the design team forgot, though, were blinds, rollers, sheers, or ANYTHING to cover the massive four windows at the rear of the restaurant. I think I have a sunburn on one side of my face. Apparently, the blinds will eventually be installed. If I could give a review about the design firm used by Chambar, I would give them a zero simply for not thinking about installing window coverings at all. What an amateur move.\\n\\nBrunch service was another debacle, and actually worse than our dinner service. Our server (a petite lady with a French accent and strong eyebrows) was downright rude to our table and simply left our table after taking the drink order of only one person at our table (@$#%!!???!?), but only after she actually scoffed at my friend's order (a soda water with lime). \\n\\nWhen it came time for us to pay our bills, yet another farce ensued. It took about 5 minutes for our bill to arrive, and then nearly another 10 for the portable credit card machine to be brought over to us by an official-looking gentleman (this time in a jacket and leather tie). Then, the bill machine ran out of paper, and it was another almost 5 minutes before the machine to be brought back. There was more annoying drama afterwards, but I will spare the details in this review.\\n\\nOn the bright side, our food came out quickly (it actually arrived before our drinks) and was well-done. Everyone at the table was pleased with their meals, but the universal opinion of the table was that the service was laughably terrible.\\n\\nOverall, the front of house experience at Chambar needs a very serious overhaul. i should clarify that some of the service staff (i.e. the hostesses and bus staff) were friendly, attentive and professional, however, the \\"main\\" servers were unprofessional, unhelpful and unpleasant to deal with. The kitchen is clearly pulling its weight, but the service was so poor that it dragged down my entire experience. Twice.\\n\\nI will not be returning."},{"name":"McDonald's","address":"3519 Cedar Hills Blvd","city":"Beaverton","stars":"2","text":"Chicken nuggets, they are my all time favorite.

I ordered the Glen Rhee Bao, Kickin Chicken, Veganville with a side of truffle tots. Out of the three I have to say my favorite is the Glen Rhee Bao which has marinated Korean short rib. The truffle tots were also very good and the truffle taste didn't overwhelm the entire dish itself which is always a turn off for me.

We come here frequently as downtown Beverly doesn't have many (if any) European cafes.

Sadly, they are prepared ahead and warmed to order. If you love food then you can tell the difference in taste and texture when something is made ahead to save time. It's a shame to compromise speed with quality.

Definitely a highlight. All three ramen dishes were very flavourful, but the truffle ramen really stood out. The chicken was tender and a great complement to the broth. Also, the noodles were firm and not at all soggy. The truffle ramen also comes with a side of dried seaweed and a kale chip. Unfortunately, my kale chip was burnt so it had a very unpleasant bitter flavour. But overall, great dish! \\n\\nWe got the yuzu parfait, matcha parfait, and matcha creme br√ªl√©e for dessert. Unfortunately, I didn't enjoy any of the desserts. I'm not sure why either of the parfaits are named \\"parfait\\". They're light and refreshing, but a little weak in their flavours and has the texture of frozen whipped topping.

I waited outside for my friend and her family to arrive, and I was absolutely blown away by the live music performance on the outside terrace. The acoustic covers of songs both new and familiar really set a relaxing tone, even on a busy Friday night.

I was excited about Mammy's Roast Chicken, but unfortunately, my bird was a little undercooked and greasier than I would have liked. The vegetables were excellent, but there was a mountain of potato and very little braised carrot to be had. The waitress was absolutely darling and exceptionally efficient in her tending to our needs, but I didn't have the courage to ask her to send my plate back. The stage show was riveting which helped offset my less than perfect meal experience. I capped off my meal with the Fluffy Lemon Clouds (lemon meringue tart) which was so divine, I wish I had brought a container to bring the rest home! \\n\\nThe traditional dance show and live music is absolutely engaging, and I could have easily spend the entire night just sipping beers and chatting with my friends. If you want to hear your dinner conversation parters, I would suggest being sat slight further back from the heart of the action because the volume can get quite loud.

The fried calamari has includes some fried peppers too, which gives it a nice sour/spicy kick every few bites. The calamari is always fried perfectly, the breading is always crispy and the calamari itself has a tender bite.  \\n\\nJust found out today that there's a sauce for the mussels that isn't listed on the menu: spicy lobster sauce! It is a slightly spicy tomato-based red sauce that has seafood flavor. No surprise that it went well with the mussels, that were very fresh and well cooked. Other sauces that are good include red sauce and the diavolo sauce. \\n\\nI usually get one of the seafood pastas as my entr√©e, and the seafood has always been very fresh, and I really like the red sauce! Tried the special for the first time today: pepper pasta with baby shrimp, spinach, mussels with a creamy mushroom sauce. There was a very smoky flavor to it which reminded me of bacon or smoked foods. The mussels in the pasta dish was a lot saltier and smokier, which makes me think that it was smoked. While I liked how this dish tasted, I probably will not be getting it again because it is heavy/creamy dish, and I was struggling to eat it after the first couple of bites. \\n\\nFor dessert, our server strongly recommended the fried apple cheesecake.

With that kind of reputation I can certainly say I was excited the first time I walked through the door. What I got was good. It really was. What it was not was the best, or honestly even the third best, burger in the city. I was so confused and deflated that I went back a second time thinking I must have missed something. I hadn't. That was the day I first understood the amazing power that runaway group-think has in creating a reality that people will not only believe but promote as gospel. I hadn't thought about that burger place in a long time until the day I tried Antico.\\n\\nIs their pizza good? Sure, of course it is. Are the ingredients high quality? Absolutely. Is it deserving of the hype it gets? I don't see it but that whole thing is on runaway mode now anyway. Honestly, I thought the pizza was soggy and missing whatever the 'it' factor everyone seems so convinced is there. Personally, there are three other mom and pop places in town I'd go for pizza before I made a return trip here. \\n\\n Antico is good, 3.5 to 4, star pizza. Stuck between where to rank them I thought about the smarmy staff I encountered who really do seem to think they're doing you a favor. \\n\\nSo how's that burger place in Austin doing all these years later? They're right where they ought to be, between 3-4 stars, they don't even make top 10 lists any more, and to my knowledge haven't won best burger in years.

I ordered the mussels which were pretty good but found it quite salty.  My friends who ordered steaks also said their food was very salty.  It was actually good value for your money, but I was expecting the food to be more flavourful. When we were ready for dessert, we were once again not acknowledged by our server.  It would have been better for them to over staff the place because once again, I cannot tell you how terrible the service was.  We were barely approached by any server and sometimes when they did come around, they would refill one or two of our waters, but not everyone's water at the table.  Would I go again?

I ended up ordering the Pad Thai.  Most of their Thai dishes are spicy, but there are convenient peppers beside each dish to tell you the level of spice. The Pad Thai serving was HUGE.

Raphael left the bar to do some work in the back and after my friend arrived we couldn't get service to save our lives. The remaining bar staff ( all men ) basically stood around chatting with each other with the exception of the one near us who was super busy chatting up two young heavily cleavaged women. After waiting for 10 minutes to order after my friend arrived, I finally walked over and asked the guy for some service. He reluctantly took our order, he seemed annoyed that we were even there. We ordered sushi and it came without soy sauce. After trying to get a barstaff's attention and being ignored again, I got up and asked one of the floor staff and they promptly brought us some ( which was terrible by the way, very thick ).

Turns out they whip up some good fish down in Tasmania, because I've never had better sushi.\\n\\nFor what it's worth, I did a little research on the fish, and it turns out that called \\"Tasmanian Ocean Trout\\" and it's basically the same thing as what we would call Rainbow (or Steelhead) Trout. It's the Pacific Salmon variety of the trout species of fish (or some such thing). But you can call it whatever you want, I might go back and order a plate full of just that.

The food and service on a recent visit were right at par-level for the trendy, upscale bracket the restaurant occupies.\\n\\nThe menu is rather limited, and the concept of incorporating brewing ingredients and byproducts feels a bit gimmicky in some of the offerings. None of the house beers were available yet, but the selection of non-proprietary beers was good. The options for small serving sizes is nice, letting you match different beers to different dishes, though pairing suggestions on the menu would have been helpful. \\n\\nOn the table:\\n\\nHearth bread was, well, bread. Big slices from a soft-textured loaf. The accompanying nut butter and roasted garlic were each good but didn't play well with one another.\\n\\nRabbit carnitas were tasty but a bit ill-conceived. The meat had nice, crispy edges, but there wasn't enough tender contrast to complement that. The pig's blood mole seemed superfluous on the side, as the meat was already moist and well-seasoned.\\n\\nChicken paprikash looked pretty, but the only interesting part of the dish was the beer grain spaetzle. The sauce was bland, the lardo relevant only as a color contrast, and the chicken's advertised crisp skin was only marginally so. I'm not one to gripe about portion size, but this just wasn't a dish worthy of a $22 price tag.\\n\\nThe miniature ice cream cones were tiny, but a nice signature dessert.

I ordered two medium pies, one with mushroom and pepperoni and one white. I also got 3 cannolis to go. I thought everything was good. The sauce was tasty. I prefer thicker crust, but understood this was fold over, NY style. What I didn't like was that the toppings were raw! Just a few minutes under a broiler would have crisped up that pepperoni and brought out so much more taste even from the shrooms! The white pizza I started to fall in love with at first bite! Although garlicky, which I didn't mind, it was the big glob of ricotta you ran into about 2/3 down the slice. Like I said, wasn't bad and I may give it another chance, but still no place like home!

I asked her what dining options they had, hoping there was a sushi bar, which there wasn't, but we chose to do Hibachi in leu of table service dining. \\n\\nWe were sat at an empty hibachi, so we had plenty of time to wait for others to join the table, which allowed us time to enjoy some sushi and sake before our meal began. We had the Yum Yum Roll, which was recommended by our smiley server when I asked about full Tempura rolls... I like when the WHOLE thing is fried, not just the topping... this was probably my only disappointment during our visit. It was tasty, but I would never order it again. A: It was too robust, which made it hard to eat B: It wasn't served with wasabi, which is kind of a standard thing for me with sushi of any kind C: the batter was not crunchy, but more cakey... almost as if it was wrapped in sponge cake... it was wierd... could've been MUCH better. I will definitely try more of their sushi selections upon my next visit. \\n\\nOnce some more people joined our hibachi we got started. Typical showmanship... nothing I've never seen before. Our cook was a great guy... plenty of laughs, what not... the meal was great, especially considering we got $30 off with Scoutmob. Nothing to phone home about, but it's certainly a solid Hibachi experience. I would really like to go again with a larger group where we can have our own Hibachi... that's always the best. \\n\\nAll in all, a great time with a great friend... plenty of sake and japanese beer... great service, wonderfully friendly staff...

At off-peak hours, the place is charming. When the crowds come poring in (as they often do), it still ain't bad. It's a small place, but for whatever reason, I never feel cramped or annoyed despite the very small and often crowded bar.\\n\\nThe beer list is extensive, but if you're reading this review you already know that. The food is similarly as ambitious as their beer menu and almost all items are made in house. The problem, and the only reason I'm docking the Porter a star, is that I've had equal hits and misses with the food. The goat cheese fritters with honey and black pepper is perfect. I don't care if Ecco did it first, Ecco isn't this chill. I once had a pork Vindaloo ravioli with those beautiful little watermelon radishes that was as splendid to taste as it was to look at. I'm also a big fan of the mac and cheese. However, pub staples have always suffered every time I've ordered them - particularly that burger.\\n\\nWhere to start on that damned burger? Let's work our way in. Starting with the delicious bun. It comes on an oversized, delicious asiago cheese bun. The bun is delicious on it's own, butit doesn't work with the burger. Not to mention you can't figure out how to hold (because of the cheesy top) or bite (because it's oversized) the thing. The pickles and pickled onions (I wish more places would throw this on a burger) are really quite good, however an entire clove of pickled garlic made its way onto my bun on my last visit. I think it was part of the pickling solution. The bacon has always been overcooked - like too crispy strips of bacon bits. Given the quality of much of their food, you'd think they could cook a hamburger patty to temp. NEVER. Every time I order medium rare, every time I get medium well. Really aggravating. Additionally, I think that they should really switch to hand-cut fries as these get boring after a few. They're advertised as Belgian fries, but they're just not there.\\n\\nOutside of their burger and a couple of other small items, their food is pretty terrific and leagues above Brickstore Pub.  The Porter is one of Atlanta's best offerings and I encourage anyone who likes beer, or just a different non-Atlanta vibe to stop in. Seriously one of the best joints in Atlanta."},{"name":"Ruth's Chris Steak House","address":"45 School St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"This place is kind of hidden.

There was still some butter left over from the bread, so I slathered this on top of the sizzling filet mignon.

For me, it was a bit too greasy and I thought the corn cake was strange--bland and dry. For entrees, the skirt steak was pretty good, but not spectacular. There wasn't much meat since it was a very thin strip. It came with bean soup, rice, and plantains. I liked the half rotisserie chicken better. It was moist and flavorful. My husband said it was the best chicken breast he's had (he usually doesn't like chicken breast). \\n\\nService was not good. The server forgot that we ordered chicken and also didn't give us any sauces (the white and green one) until I asked for some towards the end of our meal. I noticed that other tables were given the sauces right after ordering. \\n\\nDespite the service hiccups, we had a good experience trying Peruvian food. I just wished they gave us the sauces in the beginning because they were delicious."},{"name":"Lime Leaf","address":"435 Columbian St","city":"Weymouth","stars":"4.5","text":"This might be my new spot for Thai food.

My friend from BC recommended this place as a good place to eat. At first, I didn't feel like traveling all the way to Brookline for Korean bbq whereas I could have gotten it at Koreana (more convenience and no transfer of subway line for moi). Peer pressure gave in and so...I complied. \\n\\nAnyways, we ordered two orders of special kalbi, one beef bulgolgi, one pork bulgolgi, and rice dumpling type of soup. The bulgolgis were decent. The pork which was supposed to be spicy...was not spicy IMO. The soup was pretty good and definitely something I would order if they offer at other korean restaurants I might be visiting in the future. The special kalbi was AWESOME. In the end, we ordered another set of special kalbi and the best part..its BONELESS. This means less hassle (the meat is cut into cubes).  The korean side dishes are decent also. \\n\\nThe interior's really nice, somewhat on the lines of an upscale restaurant. Korean bbq do not come cheap but one can pay less than $20 a head providing that you had about 7 people (I did).\\n\\nBtw...who's signature is #55 Mats..something? Is it the Yankees player? I saw his signature as I stepped into the restaurant.\\n\\nOverall, I would go here again when I feel like splurging or to venture somewhere a little out of the way."},{"name":"Flour Bakery + Caf√©","address":"12 Farnsworth St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"This place is definitely hidden.

We really enjoyed this appetizer after picking out the red onions.  Also, it was a little difficult to eat the with the thick cabbage leaves. Serving it with butter/iceberg lettuce would have made the dish more refreshing and easier to eat.\\n\\n2. Pad thai - Like at many other thai restaurants, there was a little too much sauce on the pad thai =(( The lime was much needed to balance the sweetness. I don't know if it's just my personal preference, but I really think pad thai should be stir-fried a bit instead of just mixed in with the sauce.\\n\\n3. Red curry beef- This was our favorite dish of the night, although I would have preferred a little more coconut and heat in the sauce. Also, they put spicy peppers w/seeds instead of green peppers in the dish and they could kill your palate if you cannot take  the heat.\\n\\n4. Basil chicken- Our least favorite dish of the night. The sauce was thinner than the curry sauce and barely coated the chicken (which could have been sliced thinner). Would not order this dish again.\\n\\nDrinks: Thai iced tea\\nTry then, they are yummy =)\\n\\nThe portion sizes are balanced and we were so stuffed after the meal.

We were warmly greeted and then seated.  Our server came and took our coats and hats and gave us a ticket for the coat check.  Everything was precisely laid out from the napkins to the menus.  They certainly focus on detail here.  Not normally something I would care about, but you can tell that it is something they take pride in.\\n\\nOur server was wonderful, and helped with recommendations for gluten-free substitutions.  There was no trouble finding something to eat for the two GF diners.  I had a great red wine to start, a Blue Mountain Gamay Noir.  I was told this was an excellent choice and had been voted as one of the top 3 BC wines.  It was amazing and reasonably priced.  I was thrilled.  A nice, lighter bodied red I figured would pair well with whichever meal I decided to choose.  And it did!\\n\\nWe only ordered dinner, no appies or dessert.  I had the tajine, which was a great choice and a real bargain considering the size of the meal.  Meals here are on the pricey side, but not over the top for the atmosphere, service and quality.  Definitely worth the money for a special night out.  However, while two of my dining companions had the duck (normally something I would have gone for), their portions were a bit small.  My lamb shank was giant!  And instead of the couscous (gluten) I was presented with some roasted vegetables which went so well in the tajine that I preferred this option to what would have been the couscous.  The figs, honey and cinnamon in the sauce with the lamb were heavenly.  I am definitely using figs in the next tajine I make at home.  Wow.  There was also a dish of roasted eggplant that went with the meal.  Again, another thing I love.  Perfection.  \\n\\nAs I mentioned, the service was exceptional.  I went to visit the bathroom and while I was up a server (not even ours) ran over to refold my napkin and place it neatly presented back on the table.  How fancy!  Although I felt like I was being a bit scolded for not having folded my napkin myself, and having just left it in a haphazard pile on seat.  But really, I know that was not the intent.  \\n\\nThe atmosphere is a little dark, but beautiful, totally romantic if that is what you are going for, and the music was varied but excellent.

Score! I don't even care that most of the books on the shelf were utterly unreadable and bland, I just loved that I was greeted with cheap books.

Not for the faint of wallet and aimed to stimulate your senses. Eat, be inspired and buy art if your heart desires!  I'm really torn giving this review on a number of levels...  First, there is the antitesis of the expectation, yet the anticipation of what will be when it all comes together.  Second, there is the deep respect for some of the key staff members such as Donnie Simon and the up and coming wine director, Shaun Snow and needless to say, Chef Rachel Klein and her down to earth, true to themselves kitchen staff... Third, is my reputation as a food and travel blogger, a trusted persona when it comes to some folks spending their hard earned dead presidents on everything from hot dogs to a dining experience.  So here we go...\\n\\nThis is a NEW restaurant.  So lets cut it some slack - a lot of slack even though they command good dough for dine.  What is it?  It is a transformational experience in a hub dominated by the \\"bad boys\\" of steak house strongholds.   It is an aggressively pretentious endeavor, whose \\"haute\\" nature is tempered by the humble humanity of some members of the staff, confused with others that seem painfully misplaced... Its new.  So there is a lot that needs to come together, to sing as harmoniously as the fluidity of the open, bright, ethereal space it is in.  From the spectacular murano chandelier that sparkles to the Spanish tile floor, through the rustic plates, brazilian wood benches, the softened hues of maroons and greys and whites and greens, to the mix of clear and cork, marbles and metal - there is a warmth amidst the cool of stone - the decor itself evokes earth wind and fire in an enchanting way.  There is art everywhere even in how your drinks are presented. \\n\\nThe kitchen is open, fluid, high end everything - not a single penny went skimped on.  Lets face it - the place is gorgeous.   5 star gorgeous.  \\n\\nDid I say its new?  Lets get to the food.  All the flavors are there. Chef Klein cooks food that is familiar, evokes flavors that are familiar, in gently restrained artistic ways.  She won't wack you with molecular gastronomy.  She doesn't transform ingredients outside the boundaries of their natural elements - what she does guide her team through is how to coax the full potential of your meal to meet its most sublime flavors.  For starters, we had the hamachi crudo so lightly flavored and paired with a crisp dry cava.  We also shared a hefty serving of duck confit................. everything duck confit is and should be.... At $17 it was so delicious, one could overlook the price. Chef Klein is known for her dumplings so we ordered the cheese dumplings (really gnocchi pillows of cheesy greatness) and the mushroom.  The fried porcini sprinkled on top really made the 'shroom goodness just linger in all its earthy deliciousness.  For entrees, I ordered the salmon - immorally crispy skin but the fish was delicately melt-in-your-mouth at the perfect doneness possible, in a puddle of sauce and little quail eggs and potatoes and just perfection.  Hubbs had the lamb and son had the roasted chicken - each plate was perfectly on point.  And the portions will not leave you hungry.  BUUUUUTTTTT...  Must I remind you its a new restaurant?  Temperatures for food were all over the map and the service was slow.  One could say that the food is maturing quicker than the synergy of the staff.  I honestly think that for a week, Shaun should lose the suit and take a servers post and teach how its done - teach the dance, the dance between the kitchen and the floor, between the floor and the tables and between the bites and the people.\\n\\nAnd this is where my heart breaks.  I want to give it 10000 stars!  And I know it will get there.  Hawk Eye Simon keeps his eagle vision standpoint over every detail.  He loves what he does and he loves the people that come in through the door.  Chef Klein commands flavor.  Shaun Snow masters the wine list.  They will lead the charge.  The younger and less experienced (like the server that was leaning against a column while taking an order) will learn and grow - together.  Just give them some time.\\n\\nIt will get there.  In the meantime, there is room at the bar and the bar menu.  There is an affordable wine list and elegantly unpretentious multifaceted wine list.  And there are plenty of things to do - you can browse.  You can shop... Yes, things are for sale.  You can nibble.  You can sip. And you can help them come to their own by joining the flow.  This is a place to be seen and to enjoy the beauty of the decor and the food.  Pace yourself and price yourself.

You'll get your money's worth on seafood with this order. If you're looking for more personal order/plate, any of the ravioli dishes are great. Lastly, the prices for a bottle of wine are pretty great and I think everyone should take the opportunity to get a bottle with their order. \\n\\nA few additional side things: it's a cash only establishment, but there's always people it seems that miss the signs. There are plenty of banks/ATMs nearby within a minute of walking. Also, order all your food at the beginning - because they're so busy, they often will not let you order another item after your initial order. It's a courtesy to the people waiting in line outside."},{"name":"Sushi House","address":"3779 Sexsmith Road, Suite 2182","city":"Richmond","stars":"3","text":"My favourite time to go to Sushi House is during lunch time. It's never too busy, so the service is consistently unhurried. There is usually a considerable number of staff on hand and I've more than once come in when they've just gathered together for a meal of their own. They're never fussed though and are just as efficient and casual as usual.\\n\\nSave for the all-u-can-eat joints (which is a totally different story), the nigiri and maki are some of the cheapest (yet still decent) in Richmond. The sushi is dainty and flavourful, with neither too much rice or fillings, the way it was meant to be savoured. There are a number of boxed lunch options to choose from, but at these low prices, it's a satisfying change to just go a la carte and get only the things you really  want.\\n\\nIf you do come during lunch time, stay clear of the seats directly in front of the windows. The blinds are often not enough to keep the glare of the sun out of your eyes. It will make you very grumpy, unless, that is, if you were looking for a horizontal striped tan."},{"name":"The Salty Pig","address":"130 Dartmouth St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Awesome charcuterie board, only downside was all the olives still had their pits.

The decor was interesting.  They have a plane on the roof, they have some funny photos, junk on the walls, and they were very friendly.  But they live and die by their sauce and not the meat itself. The sauce is good mind you and the meat was tender and tasted decent. Still it was missing something.   I had the ribs and they were tender but they lacked any char or smoke to them.  I liked the sweet potato souffle, it was great but as a desert not a side item for dinner, far too sweet.  I had the okra which was bagged and fried and the broccoli casserole.  They were both just average at best.  The portion was also lacking, like ten nuggets of okra sort of thing.  I hate to be a downer about these guys but the whole thing was a step about a Sonny's but no where as bad as say Kroger ribs.  I can think of five or six better BBQ spots in town that I would not mind driving right past this spot to get to.

Sitting at the bar can be fun except it means you are often subject to hearing the less happy waitstaff complain throughout your whole meal to each other about customers, other servers, etc.  I have worked food service and I know its no fun, but....it makes sitting at the bar a real drag.\\n\\nMy stars above are all for Sarah, the other great waiters and waitresses, the muffins (especially blueberry!), the magazines, and my two favorite lunch meals (tuna melts and the veggie burgers, both with sweet potato fries!).  Just request a spacious seat and Sarah as your waitress (or some of the others who are pretty good as well) and you should be pleased."},{"name":"The Salt Lick BBQ","address":"18300 Fm 1826","city":"Driftwood","stars":"4","text":"Great barbecue with good outdoor seating area.

We had a large party and traffic was terrible. We were not seated until 40 minutes after our reservation. When we learned a table outside was available for us, I was shocked. I spoke with the hostess who said they have to utilize all their seating. She said it would be an additional 40 minutes to wait for indoor seating. At this point, our guests had been waiting in the heat to sit, thinking we would be inside, and also getting very hungry. It was too late to change restaurants. The hostess did send a chilled bottle to our table, which was a nice gesture; however, when all was said and done, it was a tremendously disappointing dining experience. \\n\\nThe restaurant was overly crowded, the seating was cramped and uncomfortable, and this was a poor choice for dinner.

Amazing barbeque in an awesome environment. I love this place because it just feeeels so Texas-y. There's freakin' sheriffs directing traffic! I'm telling you, this is legit BBQ.\\n\\nDon't expect to walk straight in and sit yourself down to some yummy BBQ though. You'll have to wait your turn. While the waiting royally sucks, it is definitely worth it. They even had a little lemonade stand to help quench your thirst while you wait. Smart. While you're waiting and sipping on your lemonade, take a peek at the famous BBQ pit. It really is a sight to see.\\n\\nVisit #1: I had the plate with brisket, sausage, and pork ribs... and potato salad, beans, cole slaw... and pickles and bread... AND some cobbler and ice cream. Oh, goodness. I was in BBQ heaven! I am a petite Asian girl. I finished it all. Every bite was delicious. Enough said. Moving on...\\n\\nVisit #2: As if the BBQ platter didn't have enough meat, I thought I'd try my hand at tackling the beef ribs... all 3 of them. Why I ordered the large portion (the regular portion comes with 2), I'm not sure... but they were so good. Smoky, tender, moist, and did I mention they were GINORMOUS?!?!? Because they are. Granted, I didn't finish, but no one minded helping me finish the darn things.\\n\\nI like how The Salt Lick's cole slaw and potato salad aren't globbed with mayonnaise like most traditional BBQ places. The BBQ itself is rich enough as it is, and the clean flavors of the cole slaw garnished with sesame seeds and potato salad help to balance it out. Too many places nowadays cover their slaw or potato salad with too much mayo. You can't taste anything but mayonnaise! But at The Salt Lick, they really respect the ingredients, and you can really taste the potato and the cabbage. I like that. Oh, and the pickles are delicious. COLD and crisp and very refreshing. We asked our waitress to refill our plate 3 times. No joke.\\n\\nA few tips before you go:\\n- Get here early so that you can get that delicious BBQ in your mouth ASAP!\\n- BYOB. You'll be thankful you did when you find yourself waiting outside in the Texas heat, and it goes great with all of the yummy food.\\n\\nSo get your booty over to The Salt Lick.

In the past, tolerance of bad service was traded for good foods, but not anymore. The 2 stars are mostly for nostalgia and a little bit for the foods. If this is my first time eating here, it would definitely be a one star review.\\n\\nAs for service, bad service is almost always expected at most Asian-owned restaurants (let's face it, it is a fact, 9 out of 10 restaurants in Chinatown or surrounding areas are like that) anyway. As for foods, lots of salt/MSG was added as I felt a lot more thirsty than past years. The 5 spice beef sandwich is dry and blend. The soup dumplings are probably from Primefoods dumplings (ÂòâÂòâ, I eat that a lot so I immediately recognized it), that is disgraceful. The pig ears is very cold (it is a cold dish but it is like freezer cold). Even the scallion pancake is overly fried (used to be one of  the best in the area). The Taiwan chow mein is greasy and not that good.\\n\\nAs recent as 10 years ago, there was not a lot of variety or competitions in the area but that has changed in recent years. So why tolerate bad service and bad foods when there are better ones out there (Shangri-La in Belmont is just a tiny bit better but I heard that they were affiliated many years ago)?

One thing as I write this review is that they have changed their menu since I've last gone which is awesome and amazing because too many places don't adjust for the seasons. Also, note that I am able to remember items that are no longer on the menu because they were just that delicious.\\n\\nThe homemade sausage appetizer with broccoli rabe (and arrabiata sauce?) was amazing.

I long for this dish, and I'm really sad to see that it's not on the menu right now.\\n\\nI had the traditional antipasto which was well worth it, if only to shove endless piles of flame roasted red peppers into my mouth. There was also cheese and meat, but the vegetables were very excellent. I only wish there was something like crostini to go with it instead of asking for more sides of the same bread you get standard.\\n\\nChicken with spinach/feta risotto cake was also amazing, especially the creamy cake. I wish this were still on the menu so you could eat it! It was a very carb-heavy entree which could have used some vegetables, but it was still too delicious to complain about.\\n\\nThe mushroom ravioli had delicious mushroom filling, but the marsala sauce was way too weirdly sweet for me. I was hoping for a richer, creamier experience. I think mushroom pastas work much better with a cream-based sauce or maybe the use of a drier marsala in the sauce.\\n\\nI also had an amazing broccoli rabe pasta (also with sausage and a red sauce I believe?) that had amazingly generous portions. The portion sizes were kind of variable depending on the visit. Again, it did an excellent job of complementing the bitter broccoli rabe with salty and acidic notes to balance the dish out.\\n\\nThe carbonara was pretty delicious, but it was definitely non-traditional with the addition of cream. It was almost a little too thick with the sauce and cheese which added a bit too much funk (not bad, but funk in that way that cheese and scallops taste) to eat a giant pile of.\\n\\nMy major complaint is that the olive oil that comes with the free bread could be better.

For $5 you can taste five of their 10+ wines; white, red, rose and dessert. And for $5-10ish you can take a glass over to your dinner table. I took the BBQ red and it paired nicely because it, like many of the reds from the winery, is pretty light. They also serve to-go beer, I think the cheapest was $10 for a 6-pack. Not bad!\\n\\nThe BBQ of course was great too, really awesome homemade sauces. We got the Family Style which is all-you-can eat beef brisket, sausage, pork ribs, potato salad, cole slaw and beans with sides of bread, pickles and onions on request.

On paper it sounds great, and there were some great flavors at play but overall the vibe of the food was austere and frankly, not fun to eat. We started with four different cocktails that were all very herbaceous again, interesting, but not exactly something I enjoyed. My three dining companions, all local folks who like this type of food, agreed that these four different drinks lacked balance, citrus or some sort of acid. We got the grain fritters to start and that was just upsetting. Two lukewarm chewy fritters for $12. Eeek! The entrees were ok. I really did love my steak-it had awesome flavor and charred onions, but the wheat berries added that un-fun vibe I was starting to pick up on as a trend at this place. My poor boyfriend got the walnut/veggie sausage on barley-it was all, in a word.., chewy. The dessert was amazing and our server recommended wines for our entrees that were great, but overall we all thought this place was really expensive for food that lacked a fun and fresh element. The thing that really summed this place up for me was the snack the chef sent out. Other places I've been this could be a small bite of food, or some sort of dip etc.. We got.... Pickled carrots. Not a sliced mix of pickles including carrots, but whole unpeeled carrots in vinegar.

They are delicious and unlike most other samosas. The dough is more like a pie crust than the more common flaky filo-like dough, and the mixture inside is more like mashed potatoes with the occasional pea than diced vegetables.\\n\\nThe vegetarian entrees (palak paneer, chana masala) I've gotten are good. My favorite Indian dish is palak paneer, which is pretty good here (though not as good as at Aab India or at Banana Leaf). There's a fair amount of paneer, which I appreciate because it's expensive and likely to be skimpy (looking at you, Curry and Hurry!). It adds green bell pepper, which is an addition I've never had before in palak paneer.\\n\\nThe sides are okay. The rice is fine, but the naan leaves something to be desired. It's very heavy and somewhat oily. \\n\\nI find the spice to be at a great level. I usually order at \\"medium\\" to be safe and find that it has a great kick to it. If you don't love spicy food, order \\"mild.\\"\\n\\nAll in all, Indian Kitchen is pretty good.

Not only was the food amazing but the people were the nicest you can imagine.  The owners and employees all knew my kid's names and what they ordered and they were all smiles.  The food was fantastic and the place was immaculate.  If I could have given them 6 stars I would have.\\n\\nBut for reasons unknown, they went out of business so we're left with this place and the one on campus.\\n\\nThe burgers at this one are not bad but I've been here 5 times as we do business nearby and while they're still pretty good, twice they've been overly salty and once overcooked.   In addition, the fries that all of them used to make were unique and awesome and recently they've switched to a different fry that's pretty much the same as many other places and not as good.  The lettuce was also brownish today.  \\n\\nBut if you look at Jebidiah's review below, that's not the biggest problem.  The people who own these are Korean (not Chinese) but THIS guy is the equivalent of the Soup Nazi.  There are all kinds of rules posted all over the store and he charges $4 for lettuce and tomatoes from the toppings bar if you split a burger.  \\n\\nSay WHAT?!?\\n\\nLast time my wife and I went we were getting an order to go and I told him we would get one drink for both of us, at which time he chimed in immediately \\"No sharing drinks!\\"  \\n\\nGee, sir...the order is TO GO.  \\n\\nAnd today, I asked him if they had gone back to the old fries (which were divine) or still had the new fries and he literally just curtly barked at me \\"new fries!\\"  Uh...okay, skip the fries then.\\n\\nBasically, the guy is just rude and how anyone manages to get away with his attitude is a mystery.  I like the food OK - it's not nearly as good as it was at the Oak Hill location and I don't think it's even as good as the campus store.

But the description didn't say that there would be beets in the salad...and the beets were about 40% of the salad too!

Many wine lovers have probably never tried a wine from Dom. Jean Bourdy in the Cote de Jura, but it is one of the oldest wineries in the world.  The wines are famously long-lived (I've heard the 1865 is drinking great!), and their cellar still has bottles dating back to the late 1700s.  I have quite a few bottles in my cellar, but nothing older than 2000 (which I brought along to get autographed lol).\\n\\nTo quote Tony Maw's email:\\n\\n\\"Jean Francois is the keeper of Europe's largest wine cellar, a bastion for the traditions of Arlay and the Jura, and likely has the finest mustache on his side of the Atlantic. His family has been making wines, essentially the same way, for five hundred years (that date isnt exactly pinned down, but think 1475). It's worked out.\\n\\nWhen given the opportunity to try an old Bourdy bottle (in my case 1945 Vin Jaune), it's truly a window into the past and a testament to tradition.\\n\\nThis tradition along with one of the specialties of the Jura, roasted chicken with morel mushrooms and Vin Jaune sauce, gave us reason to celebrate. Chef Maws will be offering his take on this excellent dish along with a delicious four course menu to pair along with Jean Francois' wines.

I took a few friends from out of town here and was excited to do so. Part of me was dreading driving out to the middle of nowhere just for dinner, but I figured, if other people do this, why not?\\n\\nFirst thing is first, when you get to the grounds, there is a street sign that points towards Salt Lick. It made me laugh a bit that this establishment was so well known there was directions leading to it. The place is gigantic though and now I understand why people say it is an experience in and of itself just coming here. The grounds have that rustic old west type feel that seems to exemplify the mood for BBQ. The wait on a thursday night was 20 minutes. Shocking for the middle of nowhere, but for this place seems normal. \\n\\nAll 4 of us got the all you can eat, and I want to say, it was the best overall BBQ I've had in TX. Now, hear me right. It does not have the best meat that I've had from BBQ (that honor goes to Sno's) but this was close. The sides and the restaurant feel catapulted this to the best overall experience though. The ribs were succulent and went perfectly with their sauce. Sausage is probably the best I've had from any establishment and should be eaten without the BBQ sauce (the sweetness of the sauce is good for the ribs but not the sausage). The brisket: we got burnt ends. They were amazing, though I still think I prefer Rudy's or Sno's. The sides were great: potato salad was very well balanced and flavored. The cole slaw was not that special but it was a good palate cleanser. Beans had that well charred flavor too. The bread, something many take for granted, was amazing, probably one of the best I've had at a BBQ joint outside of Spring Creek in Dallas.\\n\\nThe cobbler at the end was really good, though a bit too sweet for me. Peach and blackberry that day with a scoop of ice cream, yum.\\n\\nOur waiter was always buzzing around to make sure we had enough bread and meat. He kept encouraging us to polish off the plate so that he could grab more and best of all he asked us what we wanted so that we could get more ribs and less sausage, not that we didn't like the sausage, but cmon...its greasy and some of us have New Year's resolutions.\\n\\nAlso to note is the amazing smoke pit where you can see the magic happen. It makes logical sense they put the sausage above the smoker to capture that flavor.  There's an episode where Man vs. food came too if you look it up on youtube.

I have no complaints about that.  It's the service that bothered me.\\n\\nWe waited in line for about 35+min outside, which isn't terrible for what the wait could be for Giacomo's.  If you're going for ambiance, don't bother.  This is NOT a date night place.  People are packed into the seats like sardines, and you constantly have to squeeze in to let people (patrons and servers) in and out of the seats around you, and it's loud.  I will give the servers credit that they do not mess around.  They take your order, give you your delicious food, done.  There is no time for chit-chat or customer ass-kissing.  I respect with that.  As a server, they got a ton of people waiting to get in and a bunch of people to serve, and they know that the food is good enough that customers can deal with  a little impatient lip in order for them to get their job done quickly and correctly.  The fact that they could weave in and out of the restaurant as fast as they do without dropping plates is impressive alone.\\n\\nHowever, as a server you do not need to go out of your way to be straight up rude to guests no matter how good you know the food is.  The other person I was eating with said \\"Wow, seeing those people out there and considering we waited like 40 minutes-\\" the waitress filling his glass cut in \\"You wait in line and eat good food, why are you complaining? You're in a seat, right?\\" and then stormed off.  Well if you had let him finish the statement is was making to EVERYONE ELSE BUT YOU, he was going to say \\"-but the food really is worth the hype.\\"  He was not addressing the server at all, nor did he even realize she was there initially.  If he really did have a complaint he would have said it directly to a member of staff.  Patrons are allowed to make observational comments about their experience, you don't need to treat them like crap because you've been working there since before I was born.  Chill the f-out.

We told the waitress and she didn't seem to care at all. Then she sat down and ate her dinner with her back to the room as we waited patiently for the check.

We had heard good things and upon entering, we immediately liked the vibe of the place (particularly in the back room).  As we were walking toward the back bar, a girl walked by us and said \\"I hope you're not looking for a drink.\\"  Her comment didn't even register until we were on our way out 20-30 minutes later having been completely ignored by every staff member in the place.  You read that right, we were in the bar for 20+ minutes and we were unable to get a drink.  The craziest part is that we managed to get a big enough space for two of us to lean directly on the bar, money in hand, and attempt to get the bartenders' attention.  However, in the entire time we were there, neither bartender as much as looked at us!  I have never seen bartenders who worked slower in my life.  They weren't looking around to see who they could serve next, they weren't communicating with the customers or each other, they were simply in their own little world making drinks at half speed.  I don't care how cool your vibe is or how awesome your shuffleboard tables are, if you can't serve the people in your bar then you're doing it wrong.

For our neighbourhood we have no shortage of fine Japanese establishments. But we wanted something new, something can surprise us so we chose this place opened a week ago and just one review done here. And we were pleasantly surprised! \\n\\nFor us ramen is all about the soup base. The soul and the calling card of ANY bowl of ramen. And this place has a chicken stock for many restaurant-goers these days who aren't drawn to pork stock for a variety of reasons. And boy the chicken soup base had flavour. I am talking about proper chicken flavour that doesn't taste coming from a canned stock base. This soup stock tasted in-house, carefully curated and wonderfully balanced. In our group we have two very discerning eaters: one being vegetarian-whenever-she-can, the other is gluten-free-but-loves-all-things-ramen. For most ramen house, the attitude would be just \\"too bad you picky eaters who fail to appreciate authentic food so it's your loss.\\" And most ramen places in Vancouver's West End do such fabulous business they could care less about those \\"picky\\" eaters. But not here. The fact that they've developed chicken stock and toppings tells you they've done their research and realize those discerning eaters represent a sizable market segment that deserves their attention and catering to. And all their ramen dishes can have rice noodles rather than just the usual wheat-based ones. Right away our GF member jumped at the option and ordered their seal salt chicken ramen with a clear broth. I ordered the creamy chicken broth one. The third member of our group opted for a tofu rice set that came with bottomless miso soup and salad side dishes. Wow...that was a nice touch. We didn't end up utilizing the \\"bottomless\\" promise but for those of you coming in hungry, this can the deal clincher. We also ordered the usual vegetable tempura but there was nothing usual about it, taste wise. It was not greasy and the server told us the breading was done in house, not another stock option that universalizes all the texture of tempura. The vegetables were fresh, flavourful, and cooked at just the right degree. Not under. Not over. Just right. For tempura, that's not a small fit. \\n\\nOur ramen took an extra few more minutes to come compared to the usual. And they were worth the wait. The soup was...sensational. You can tell there was no MSG in it. You could tell the flavours were extrapolated from the ingredients in the making of the soup base. The the egg yolk was soft but not runny. The chicken topping was succulent and tender. The noodles had the right kind of bite to them. The curry tofu rice set was a lot larger that usual. And the curry, while remaining distinctively Japanese curry, was spicy, and a bag of flavours. \\n\\nA couple other details: they provide you a plastic box for you to place your handbags in it. I think that's nice touch as well. Many of their clientele carry properly pricey bags. This is a good move. The servers were attentive and provided a lot of product details. Some may think they hover a bit but we didn't mind at all. We suspect they were the owners so their eagerness was perfectly understandable to us. \\n\\nI don't usually write epic reviews like this. Too busy and most places aren't worth writing home about. But once in a while, a caring thoughtful place pops up in your neck of the wood you just can't help but want to give a shout out for them. This place is about 10-15% more expensive than their competitors but given Vancouver's exorbitant real estate rent, they may just have no option in order to stay open."},{"name":"Bonefish Grill","address":"174 University Ave","city":"Westwood","stars":"2.5","text":"I went recently and it was okay.

So nori should be toasted for the hand roll and not left raw because it is tough and impossible to get a nice bite without struggling to tear the seaweed every bite.

But now that they've nixed smoking completely, welcome back to the rotation!\\n\\nSeating is tight at The Porter. It's not because the gastropub is minuscule (it sure looks that way from the street) but because it's cramped. While there are a lot of tables, they're close together so gingerly maneuvering between wooden furniture, getting the back of your chair bumped by passersby, and intentionally eavesdropping on neighboring conversations are to be expected. Oh yeah, once I sat across from the bathrooms, just hope you don't get those tables. \\n\\nIf beer is your drug of choice, pack your bags for The Porter. The regularly updated beer list resembles a novel, and there are thoughtful hooks under the tables so you can hang on to the lists for later. There are gobs of quality craft beers on tap, and millions more in bottles and even some aged options from their cellar. For the non-beer fiends, you'll find something to imbibe, whether it be ciders, wines, spirits, cocktails (I recommend the grapefruit margarita), iced teas, kombucha made in-house, grapefruit juice, the choices are endless.\\n\\nEven though the beer is the main draw here, the food isn't something to pass over. During one dinner, I had a po boy that I wasn't wild about but usually I'm pretty content with the edibles. On my last visit, I had the 12 hour brisket and pierogies ($14.75). You'd expect there to be plentiful portions of the house-created potato pierogies and limited beef quantities, but it was the reverse, beef-fest for sure.

I think I'm with Krista P. on this one - it likely is the best hamburger I've ever had. Wow. It's just phenomenal. (I must say that, if you're going to stop by here and order this, you may not want to make plans to eat the rest of the day, since this burger is gigantic. It's actually two hamburgers within one bun.) When I ordered it, the owner (I apologize for forgetting his name now, but he's exceptionally friendly and cool) asked if I wanted mustard, ketchup and mayonnaise on it. I said yes, and then he remembered that he had a mango-flavored topping, which he suggested I substitute for the ketchup. I did so, and that was an excellent choice. The hamburger is out of this world, made even more so by the outrageously-good bread as well as grilled onions. (Mine also had Swiss cheese.) I still can't believe I finished the entire thing as it was much more food than I was expecting, though entirely in a good way. The owner mentioned that he put a hint of cinnamon in the burger, which my taste buds picked up but couldn't 100% identify until he brought it up. Overall, this was just an incredible hamburger experience. This may be my new favorite, even topping my previous favorites at The Hideaway and the Crooked Spoon truck. (I don't know; I don't want to award a 3rd place or even a 2nd place trophy out of those three, so let's just call it, as far as I'm concerned, a three-way tie between the three for the best burger I've had.) The burger came with chips, and the owner even gave me a can of Coke (which I wasn't charged for; bonus!).\\n\\nSo, on to the deep-fried Oreos. Well, I ordered them, but couldn't really get to them since the hamburger was so filling. I did bring them home with me and just tried one. WOW. I'm guessing they're probably better when initially served, though the one I just tried here at home was almost as sinfully delicious, albeit a little cooler. I think you get at least 4 of these evil little goodies for $2.50. It's worth the price. Also on the dessert menu today was a deep-fried Twinkie, though I'm not sure I'll ever get around to that. (I'm not a big fan of \\"regular\\" Twinkies.) If this truck ever does have deep-fried TWIX, though ... well, I'll be all over that.\\n\\nThe owner, as I mentioned, is very cool, personable and knowledgeable about not only his own menu, but menus of other food trucks and non-food-truck establishments. I really enjoyed talking to him and am hoping to get back to his truck for another visit sometime very soon. He was telling me that he's still trying to figure out a way to accept credit cards (it's cash-only now) and that, at some point, he's hoping to offer delivery services. His potential plan involves buying a moped and delivering to customers within a 5-mile radius. That would be an awesome weapon to have in the food truck industry! I hope he's able to do it and that he has continued success.\\n\\nOther menu items I noticed on the board (on the outside of the truck) today included the Chimoo sandwich (see other reviews), a quesadilla (which I'll probably try next time, if possible) and ... hmm, that's all I remember. The owner did tell me he's thinking about experimenting with a vegan/veggie burger (he said he'd recently seen a recipe calling for one with avocado in the center ... MMM!), a plantain burger and more. Keep your eyes peeled for updates - there's a Twitter page (http://twitter.com/treehousetruck) that the owner himself uses, so that's probably the best bet - for now - to find out what's on the current menu & what's on its way.\\n\\nI'm looking forward to my next visit here and hope most everyone else who sees this review will give it a shot, too. It's definitely worth your time and money. Hopefully this food truck is here to stay!"},{"name":"Nakato Japanese Restaurant","address":"1776 Cheshire Bridge Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Delicious, fresh sushi and great service!

The dining room is quite small but warmly appointed. \\n\\nOur waiter was excellent; friendly, knowledgeable, self effacing, there when we needed him and not when we didn't. \\n\\nTwo things at Craigie can conspire against the unadventurous. One, the menu is short. And two, they serve a fair amount of offal. \\n\\nThe American Heritage Dictionary defines offal as (1) Waste parts, especially of a butchered animal; (2) Refuse; rubbish. \\n\\nFoodies will agree that this is an awful definition for what can arguably be some of the best food on the planet, especially in the skilled hands of the folks at Craigie. \\n\\nExamples of the offal on Craigie's menu last weekend: \\n\\n1. Beef marrow - offered as an appetizer. \\n2. Cocks' combs - also an appetizer. \\n3. Sweetbreads - an appetizer you guess? Wrong, an entree! \\n4. Cod cheeks - okay, not actually offal but it sounds like it. \\n\\nThe food was so good that I wished for more variety but I was delighted by my two choices, cocks' combs and sweetbreads. The cocks' combs were served as a ragout with mushrooms, in-house sausage and a poached egg. The sweetbreads were perfect as well. Served with a deliciously rich brown sauce. The only knock on this dish is there wasn't much else on the plate besides the sweetbreads. My wife had them as well and she felt a bit overwhelmed by the amount and the lack of sides. \\n\\nI wish I had the ability to wax more poetically about my first experience here. My final analysis is that it was a wonderful experience and one I highly recommend.

It was the temperature of something pulled out of the microwave too early.we sent it back to get reheated.... it returned STILL COLD. But a little drier. The cut of the meat was fatty, the veggies were burnt (again) and cold. All in all a complete disappointment.

The Salt Lick has it's own culture and routines. Yes, there are hoards of tourists that migrate here but that just adds to it's charm. Most are here to taste some of the best BBQ that Texas has to offer, others are here to just say they were here. \\n\\nI can't say that the BBQ here is my preferred style, but if what you are looking for is a classic Texas BBQ then this is it. They make sauces that center around a spicy kick with a bold finish. One of the sauces (and one of my favorites) even incorporates habanero peppers. It has a beautiful yellowish-brown color that resembles more of a mustard than a BBQ sauce. But it's unique qualities is what I like about it.\\n\\nThe ambiance is just what you would expect. Just an old wooden house with a huge BBQ pit out in front where you can view brisket and links roasting over an open flame.

If we had more time, I would have taken him to Smitty's in Lockhart, too - but I like my BBQ to come with side dishes, and while Smitty's excels in smoking meat, its side dishes leave something to be desired. \\n\\nWhile I know he would have loved Smitty's, dad was in heaven at the Salt Lick. We ordered the family platter, of course - and boy was he thrilled to see the waiter stop by to refill it. It's loaded with brisket, sausage and ribs. They bring out a bowl of Salt Lick's bbq sauce in case the sauce they pour over the platter isn't enough. If you're ok with spice, ask for the habanero bbq sauce; it's outstanding and the heat isn't deadly.\\n\\nEven with all the 'que, the strange potato \\"salad\\", the coleslaw with sesame seeds, and the beans, leave room for dessert. There's a scrumptious pecan pie - offered a la mode - or peach or blackberry cobbler. (Yes, Phil, I said \\"cobbler.\\") Can't choose between the two cobblers, they'll give you both, with ice cream! I find the peach to be a lot too sweet, but the blackberry is perfect, especially with the ice cream. Portions are big enough to share, or to bring home for leftovers. (It's been known to happen!) \\n\\nP.S. The Salt Lick is BYOB."},{"name":"Ruth's Chris Steak House","address":"45 School St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Ate here for a celebration dinner after I got into college.

Maybe my opinion is spoiled from coming here so much, but now that the glitter and bright blue paint has faded I have to say Pambiche isn't all that after all.\\n\\nBreakfast here is too expensive for what you really get.  Does $10 justify two eggs, dry beans, and rice?  No?  I agree.  The French Toast comes with 1/2 pound of fruit cocktail.  Why do I want to eat that much fruit cocktail?  It's better to just not fill the plate rather than fill it with subpar afterthoughts just to make it look like it's worth $10.  Have you ever thought about pairing plantain with sour red onion?  No?  Why do I want a dollop of this on everything I get?  Their fufu here is just so, so, so....incorrect.\\n\\nSo what is an Elena Ruz?  An Elena Ruz is white sandwich bread, slathered in ONLY strawberry jam and cream cheese and packed with sliced turkey.  So what the hell is this cheese and parsley on Pambiche's Elena Ruz?  What is this bread?  Is this another improvisation from whoever came up with the fufu?  \\n\\nMore burning considerations:  No matter which kind of croqueta you order, they all taste the same, except the fish which is subtly fish scented.  The tostones are dry little starch patties and I feel sorry for the people I see ordering them during la hora.  Why do the rice and beans have that \\"sitting on heat all day\\" dryness in the morning?  It feels like fried rice in my mouth.  I like the pollo frito, but it's not really Cuban.  I also like the Tres Leches cake, and that's also not really Cuban.\\n\\nThe happy hour is the only reason to come here.  Nice drinks and a la carte plates.  Let me just put it this way, you can pay cheap for something during the happy hour or you can pay twice as much for the same thing with dismal sides that are only there to justify the higher price during regular hours.

Secondly, the service is consistently good. The servers are very attentive and helpful if you want a suggestion on what to order. Third, the prices. They're extremely reasonable. A few recommendations: try the Crunch roll. It is so delicious - just the right blend of shrimp and crunch to take your tastebuds over the edge. You will gobble it up in 4 seconds flat. The rock and roll is an eel roll with avocado and a wonderful sweet drizzle on top. The spicy tuna roll melts in your mouth and isn't so spicy that it's overwhelming.

Refried beans, slices of avocado, Rice or guacamole are common accompaniments.\\n\\nUpon ordering Huevos rancheros from Casa Garcias I was given a plate with two eggs sunny side up one broken and over cooked, in a pool of red, what tasted like spaghetti O sauce no onion or any other visible vegetables just a weird red sauce, no tortilla, a small daub of re-fried beans, minus queso fresco (Isn't this normal?) 5 or 6 tiny cold potato pieces, and two strips of under cooked bacon. SEE PHOTO\\n\\nI'm in awe. When the sever asks if we want tortillas. I am looking for my tortilla under my eggs and sauce. None to be found. I ask for corn for myself and flour for my companion. The server was confused, I repeated my request, corn for myself, flour for my companion please. As I'm sitting there trying to figure out the taste of my red ranchero sauce, 5 minutes later he shows up with 4 corn tortillas. \\n\\nAt this point I ask for queso fresco for my beans and ask for fresh potatoes because they where not cold but almost chilled cold. The server leans over and politely says I will be back with a fresh plate. \\n\\nThe first right thing he has done so far.. I can tell he is new.\\n\\nMy companion says her food was cold also so she picked at the parts she could choke down, and it wasn't much, I tried to nibble on her food but abandoned my attempts.\\n\\n10 minutes later and my food arrives, and we had just about enough of this place. I ask to have it to go, and he brings back a Styrofoam container and I'm so frustrated I can't even calculate the tip after getting the bill. \\n\\nI didn't stiff the server because he redeemed himself by taking my whole plate after my concern of cold food, he did apologize after I handed him my credit card stating its been a busy morning.im sorry but for a place that has been in business for years apparently, a busy morning should not be an excuse for horrible food.\\n\\nBut in NO WAY would I recommend this place to anyone who is expecting even a hint of Mexican food. \\n\\nHow do you screw up Mexican food?

I have been to many top sushi bars from LA and SF to Seattle and Vancouver BC and am more than happy to fork out huge sums of cash for quality sushi.

I had to go become a 'gopher' and get my own utensils.  She came back long after taking our order to deliver the dessert menu and give us our check (lucky me).  We used to get really good service, but perhaps those days have disappeared?\\n\\nThe food has come down a notch since the honeymoon period with them.  \\n\\nThe goat cheese salad used to be a MEAL SIZED salad (it's priced accordingly).  Now it's four goat cheese portions and four lettuce leaves.  They should be embarrassed to charge the enormous sums for very little food.  \\n\\nThe risotto used to be rich and yummy (butternut squash, I believe it was), but now has been replaced with a 'pea' risotto, which, is still good (risotto is hard to screw up), but it's spread very thinly on a large plate so you must eat it in 3 minutes in order to avoid it getting cold.  Also, the cheese on this risotto was barely melted and large unmelted chunks were staring at me from the plate (was this the failure of a microwave preparation gone baaaad?).  It certainly smacked of microwave food in terms to the way it was presented, but I have no clue how it was prepared.  For $20 a plate, this is not a winner.\\n\\nThe mushroom soup was mostly fat and cream, and not too much on the mushrooms.  Good, but cheaply prepared and lacking depth of flavor (made up only by the cream and rare mushroom).\\n\\nThe portobello sandwich was just 'ok', but what can you REALLY do with a portobello mushroom sandwich?  It's just not that special.  I know what you could do... not charge $15 for it!  It's NOT WORTH IT.\\n\\nThe bread pudding is still the yummy recipe that it used to be years ago, but it has been jammed into a tiny coffee cup now (again... did they nuke it inside the cup to make it so white hot?).  It's impossible to get the sauces included with it into the 'bread' part of the pudding since the bread is so tightly packed into the cup.  They used to just combine everything FOR YOU in a BOWL that made the pudding easy to eat (and also maintain an even temperature so that you don't burn your tongue upon a deep scoop into the pudding).  Good recipe, bad preparation... \\n\\nThe lemon tart is still good... I was never the biggest fan, but it's pretty much the same old thing.  I'd suggest one of the chocolate deserts or the trifle, which was ridiculously good the last time I had it.  \\n\\nI spent $40 per head at this place tonight and the meal probably was worth about $20 per person.  Final, Raglan Road has become 'overpriced'... not because they CHARGE too much, but because they don't seem to CARE as much about my culinary experience with them... and, considering there's not a lot of food choices out there, is pretty sad."},{"name":"Dunkin'","address":"98 Central St","city":"Wellesley","stars":"3","text":"This is my favorite Dunkin Donuts.

But, oh, this risk did not pay off.  $15 for FOUR SHRIMP.  FOUR.  And they were overcooked.  The grits were good (put cheddar and bacon on anything and it'll be good) but nothing stellar.  The collard greens needed to be cooked a lot longer.  When you're dealing with something that tough, it needs to be cooked; it's not like spinach.\\n\\nAnyway, the food at Trident is typically good.

We are pretty healthy individuals and enjoy the type of food they have there so we figured we had nothing to lose. Wrong. Don't get me wrong, the food wasn't bad (nothing to write home about though either) but the prices are a bit much. Cost us almost $30 to each get a bowl and iced tea. The worst part about Savoree is the service. When you walk in and are the only customers in the restaurant you expect to be greeted or at least given direction of how to go about ordering, but no one said a thing. They have these \\"quick order\\" forms that you fill out with a marker and isn't easy to follow. When we finally ordered our food we were given a buzzer to notify us when it was ready. Now here is the confusing part. We tried to order drinks but were told you can only do that at the next register when you pay. Fair enough. We go to the second register and have to call someone over to let us pay. So we pay and never receive our drink cups. We aren't sure if they are going to bring them to us or what so we stand there looking lost and no one seems to care (and remember there is only one other customer in the place at this point). We finally are approached by the manager and we tell her we didn't get our drinks. She thinks we didn't pay for them so she starts interrogating the staff. We finally get cups of ice to fill our own teas. Never seen such a fuss over two cups of ice. We go sit down and our food comes out pretty promptly but they never even used the buzzer we received. Just for show I guess. I had the Elsa bowl which was pretty good and my wife had the create your own quinoa bowl which she said was very gritty.

I lived an hour north of Columbus then, and it immediately became my foremost destination for refreshments when I visited the city. \\n  The decor (cowgirls, skulls, scorpion stencils on the walls) and the lighting (chandeliers, lots of deep red) appeal to my aesthetic sense.  Seems like the place could be out of W.S. Burroughs' novel The Place of Dead Roads. To me, that's a good thing. \\n  On to the menu: All of the pizzas, the meatloaf, the salads, the chicken gravy with biscuits, the hummus and the salsa are delicious, as well as not too pricey.  Now and again, the kitchen will work up a special dish of the day that turns out to be a pleasant surprise. The pastas are not the best of the options at the Surly Girl. The chili is good when it's fresh and makes for satisfying frito pies and chili nachos. Since I've moved to Columbus, those chili nachos have felt like salvation on more than one late night. \\n  The bartenders are all excellent and congenial. That is if you don't mess with 'em too hard. The Surly Girl can get cramped and crazy with people and space is limited, so don't be surprised if you or your cohorts get called out on being a pain in the ass if you are generally too loud or obstruct the front of house folks from doing their job.  Patrons who behave with a modicum of consideration will almost certainly feel well-taken-care-of by their server.  \\"Bubbles\\" Green is my favorite bartender/server at SGS, an endearing man with wit to spare.\\nThe beer selection is well thought-out and I have to credit/blame the SG for introducing me to that lovely potion called Bell's Two-Hearted Ale. The cocktails are fine and dandy.\\n  The Surly Girl also conducts weekly scheduled events and activities (like stand up comedy and punk rock aerobics) and special events (live musicians, book readings) in their small but cozy back room, or parlor.  The entertainment value of these shows can vary widely.\\n  All in all, The Surly Girl Saloon is an idiosyncratic and attractive little place which holds on to a great many regular customers and is well worth visiting for both eating and carousing."},{"name":"Tropical Restaurant","address":"429 Lynnway","city":"Lynn","stars":"3.5","text":"This place is great, it's different than what your accustomed to seeing in El Tipico or Tony Tipico.

So, loyalty, benefit of the doubt and all that only seemed fair. \\n\\nDinner tonight was so bad, I literally couldn't stomach it. 3rd strike.\\n\\nStars are for ambience and service only, there is nothing positive to say about the  food. \\n\\nHere's the cols notes version of tonight's visit.\\n\\nWhen I called to make the reservation, I confirmed the 30% wine discount for Sunday night. After putting me on \\"hold\\" (I could hear the conversation on the other end) I was told yes it was on. Then \\"but you aren't using any vouchers right?\\" That was correct. \\n\\nWhen I arrived I noticed the 30% was advertised as per usual on their bistro board outside and on the blackboard inside. I was also happy to note they extended their dine out menu. I specifically asked if the 30% applied to the wine pairing suggestions on the dine out menu. Yes it did.\\n\\nParty of 6. We all ordered the 3 course pre fix and wine.\\n\\nAbout ten minutes after ordering the server came back to say he just needed to make sure we realized that because we ordered the pre fix we could not have the 30% off wine. Was that clear??!  Was it?! (The over clarification/annunciation spelled guilt to me haha) We said no, but it is now. It was pretty obvious that after we ordered they decided to revoke the wine promotion. So tacky. None of us said anything, that really wasn't a big deal, just bad manners. \\n\\n\\nHere's the big deal: it was by far the worst food, lowest quality imaginable. The others in our party had never been here before so they had nothing to compare it to and we didn't say a word. Apparently, we are the worst kind of customer because we hate complaining, just won't go back. But honestly what can you say when everything is bad. Plus, you are out having a nice evening with friends, focusing on the negative just sucks. So as soon as we parted ways hubby was like wow, that was bad. He said his steak frites (which he raves about to anyone will listen) was deplorable. \\nDidn't even feel like the same place. \\n\\nMy bouillabaisse, which I always get here, was literally a bowl of flavourless tomato water with a couple hunks of fish and three icky mussels. I don't know how they could not be humiliated to serve that. Hub said it looked disgusting when it came and how did I even choke that mess down (hungry, focusing on good company, that's how!)\\n\\nWe haven't done dine out in years because we find it's usually a cheap-o version of the establishment's regular offerings. That paired with difficult to get reso's and rushed seatings we just don't see the value. \\n\\nDidn't think this would be the same scenario since dine out is over and it was their choice to offer a pre fix menu (no pressure/ competing for dine out business). The restaurant was empty to boot. No rush jobs or frenzy to blame here. This meal was the equivalent to the watered down soup Grandpa Joe had to endure before Charlie hit it big with Willy Wonka.\\n\\nI don't get the business model. I can imagine how much competition there is in the food industry and with the tough economy it can't be easy for restaurants. However, many rooms are packed full every night of the week in this city, proving people will always eat out and spend cash they prob do not have if it's good. Booze and food get cut last. I hopes places with so much potential like this realize Vancouverites have ample options and step it up. Feed us good and we will come. Give us shrimp water and salted mystery meat and really why would we?  Such a dissapointment. We shall have to shop for a new neighbourhood haunt. Loving espana and l'abbotoir lately.

I feel guilty because I love food and want restaurants to succeed. Bananas certainly has been succeeding, and a lot of people love it, so I don't feel nearly as bad writing this review than if it was somewhere struggling for business.\\n\\nOut of an office of 7 people, 4 of us decided to go to Bananas for lunch, along with a client who was here from out of town. We were immediately brought 5 waters, which normally be a good sign. Unfortunately, that was the highlight of the service. Water. I can sneak into your Aunt Edna's backyard and steal sips from the water hose and receive the same satisfaction.\\n\\n10 minutes after the speedy water delivery, our server shows up to take our order. We started with the fried pickles, 3 cups of soup, 2 blue monkey salads, 2 lobster rolls, and 1 fish sammich (mine).\\n\\nI wasn't at work, so the delay in getting the pickles didn't bother me nearly as much as my boss, who was also there. 20 minutes after our order was placed, our server arrives with the pickles. That was the first time we saw her since placing our order.\\n\\nRegarding the pickles themselves. I had never had fried pickles come in spear form, and they were quite tasty, especially with the dip it came with.\\n\\n20 minutes after receiving the pickles, our server came to check on drink refills. It was at that time we asked why the soup had not been brought yet. Her response was that she thought they (the 3 who ordered it) wanted their soup to come with their meal. This may be believable, except while camping out we watched a few tables that arrived after us receive their soup before their meal. I've had soup at Bananas a few times and it's always come before my entree. When a server follows up your order with the question \\"would you like to start with a soup\\", it's not assumed that the soup will come at the same time as the entree. Start = Begin = Before... Right? Was this a bad assumption by the soup orderers? It felt like a poor excuse for forgetting to put our order in. Whatever. We let her know that yes, people wanted their soup first and it should be brought.\\n\\nAnother 10 minutes pass and at this point my boss goes to find our server. With no luck, with no luck, another server said she would find ours and send her our way. Our server arrives back at our table, and my boss, a woman far more vocal than I, asks what's going on and how much longer things will be. The exchange was as follows...\\n\\nBoss-Pants: \\"How much longer for our food? These people have not received their soup yet, and we've been here for over an hour.\\"\\n\\nServer: It should be 5 minutes\\n\\nBoss-Pants: Ok, I can wait five minutes if that's all it will be.\\n\\nServer: It might be longer. I'm not sure. I'm sorry, I'm just being honest with you because I'm not in the kitchen.\\n\\nIt was at that point that my boss canceled her order as she was so hungry. She left to Wendy's, and the rest of us, along with the client from out of town, said to package our orders to-go. 10 minutes later, everybody other than myself, went to the front to cancel their orders. At that moment, the to-go orders were ready and we cashed out, ready to get back to the office to quickly devour our food.\\n\\nThis food... Hmmm. That was unfortunately a disappointment as well. For mine personally, I'm assuming a lot of that had to do with getting it to go. A fried fish sammich and fries. Neither are items you would expect to keep very well, and that's a correct expectation. I've had this before, and it was different. Like it had been double fried, burnt, and left in the oil too long. I usually have an iron stomach, but a few hours later I definitely did not feel the greatest. I know at least one co-worker tossed her salad (snicker) because it was so soggy and wilted when we got back to the office.\\n\\nThe end result? Boss-Pants' canceled lobster roll was included (no charge) and the server took the fried pickles off the order. I think I'm the only person that tipped. I figured I still have no idea how much of the problem was the kitchen and how much was the server.\\n\\nWith the exception of one other time, I've had mediocre to good service at Bananas. This afternoon at 12:15, the place was at most half-full, so there really was no excuse for this. Regarding my rating... I'm going with 2-stars because I'm combining this visit with visits I've enjoyed and I really don't want bananas to be my first ever 1-star review.\\n\\nI'm glad that others do enjoy the place so much, and I even like what Funky Monkey Inc puts out there. I may even end up back at Bananas at some point, but it's definitely going to be a while.\\n\\nAs a side note: Before leaving, one of my co-workers asked to speak to the manager. When we were told there were none available because they were at a managers meeting, I started to wonder... While the parents were away, did the monkeys play?"},{"name":"Mojito Restaurant & Lounge","address":"Wyndham Hotel Midtown Atlanta, 125 10th St NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"2.5","text":"I think this place has so much potential and it's too bad that it is run so poorly.

There's a charm to waiting for something anticipated to be amazing anyway.  Luce was that - amazing, but honestly, the staff is taking themselves way too seriously and it's not charming.  Maybe it's the fanfare from Bob Appetit, but honestly, the \\"we can't possibly accomodate the seven of you because our kitchen doesn't work like other kitchen's and it might not be fast and...and...and...and...ten more reasons why we really would prefer not to seat you, even though we clearly have the room to at 2:00 p.m and if we don't seat you, we'll seat the two tables of four right behind you anyway, was really just a senseless and unneccasary introduction to what ended up being a mostly fantastic meal.  \\n\\nThe meal might have been far more fantastic without the ridiculous \\"coming from a place of no intro,\\" because after all of the lead up to \\"the food is so special and so amazing and prepared so meticiulously that it will take hours for your seven to eat anything and you'll complain and because we are so good we really don't need your business feeling given to us by the host,\\" the food was absolutely simplistic in everyway leaving one to wonder, why is the kitchen so truly, truly slow?  The antipasto menu selections were delicious, every one of them, but how long does it really take to prepare two tablespoons of beets? four teeny little clams? a plate of cabbage - albeit the best I've ever put in my mouth.  I grew up in a restaurant, a well known good one on the east coast, known for it's meticulously prepared foods, and I am pretty confident that it was a doable for this kitchen to simply seat us and let a bunch of foodies enjoy their bottles of wine and friendship over a good meal without the negative set-up for endless waiting. \\n\\nI can say this, I had the best mussels I have ever had at Luce and would go again, just for them.  And it was not because of flavor, it was because they had the most tremendous texture of any mussel I have ever eaten, and this coming from a New England girl raised on Mussels. The food is unassumingly presented.  So simple one feels that they deliberately made no attempt at presentation of any kind (which I actually thing is true). But honestly, one bite and you couldn't care less.  It's part of the charm, as long as the food truly stays good and doesn't get too sure of its minimalist style and becomes a cliche. The staff may help that along.

I ordered 3 salads and an asado nacho.  The salad lettuce was brown and was already bad.  There was no Mexican cheese on them like advertised and the service was even worse. The two ladies at the counter are the worse representatives of a restaurant ever. Even tipped them 2 dollars before the food came to hopefully change their horrible attitude.

It's hard to say which part is better.. the food or the atmosphere. Since most people go to a restaurant for the food, I'll start there. The BBQ was fantastic, but I'm sure you can gather that from everyone's reviews. What was most important to me about the food was available in portions for everyone. My mom and I tend to eat much smaller portions, so we sat outside with the dog and ordered from their little to go window. They have such a range in portions there that we could get tiny amounts of everything so we could try it all. My dad, brother and boyfriend were able to eat inside and do the all-you-can-eat deal and were totally in love. My dads big on BBQ, and can be pretty picky with anything that isn't NC BBQ, but he loved this place.\\n\\nAs far as atmosphere goes.. whoa. You feel like you are in the Australian outback or something. It is in a fairly remote area, but its a beautiful drive from downtown Austin. When you get there you see the massive parking lots.. but because they are dirt parking lots with plants separating them instead of concrete, it looks just a big open field. The buildings are great stone shacks with a total rustic feel. Dining outside we were able to sit under some amazing trees, and the boys loved the indoor seating too because you can see the sausages hanging and everything.

I was severely disappointed in that one per a previous review.  I still heard great things about this place and had wanted to eat at the original, but just never found myself in the area.  Well, that changed last week, I was in the area and had the family.  It was a Thursday evening at 7pm when we got there and the parking lot was almost full.  I expected a wait, but did not expect to see a bunch of cops waiting around the corner where you check in.  That bothered me a bit.  Why does a restaurant need to have an arsenal of officers? Anyway, we checked in without being frisked and walked on in and were seated immediately in what I guess is the original part.  We perused the menu and found some stuff we could get for the amount of cash we had on hand. I can only think to evade taxes is why you would have a cash only business?\\n\\nAnyway, the old pit was cool looking, it was loud in there, wait staff was ok, very busy and we had to wait.  We ordered sausage, brisket, ribs and sides.  When we got our food the waitress dumped out bread on the floor, but wen and got us another one.  I know these things happen, but it helped me understand maybe why this place was on the dirty side.\\n\\nThe sausage was ok which is what I had, my son loved the beef ribs and he doesn't like to chew so that says something. My wife ordered the brisket as did my daughter.  It was ok, we have all had better. I did like the coleslaw, but the potatoes were not good.  The kids really like the beans and the bread was, well, bread.  The pickles and onions were ok as well. Nothing special.\\n\\nBoth of the sauces were sweet which I did not like.  This is a personal thing.  I have never liked sweet bbq sauce and never will.  I prefer a bold,er, spicy sauce, but I prefer to taste the meat and the smokiness which the brisket and sausage were lacking iin this case, and I don't know why.

I was happy to see one of my old friends was the bartender, so we got a drink there for round one, then moved to a table for dinner, then back to the bar for round three and four.

(At a much more reasonable price than I have seen at some other places. *cough* Edgewood Corner Tavern *cough*) For dinner, we had the scallop special, which was great. The scallops were perfectly cooked, served over roasted tomatoes and fennel, and it was yummy. We tried the mac and cheese too, which was also good, but I hate when it says macaroni and it is actually shells. (Hey, they are still getting five stars, it isn't that important. Just let me know what I am ordering!) We also split the burger...ah, the burger was great. Bacon and cheese, cooked just the way I ordered it? You would think this would be an easy task, but many places over cook to the point that I might as well start ordering rare so it will come out correctly. Our server, Justin, was nice and sufficient, even though he was very busy. \\n\\nWe grabbed a seat at the bar, and Ty made me a perfect mint julep. (or three.)

It was a very traditional southern family style BBQ house. Smoke pit located in the center of catering room, cooking, cutting and serving all happened around it, busy but in order. No waiting on seating and food was served pretty fast. I ordered Thurman's choice with a half pound turkey in addition. Meat was generally very well grilled with a depth of smoky favor and smell. Ribs had a amazing glaze on the skin: delicious sweet flavor and appetizing red color, cooked medium on the tenderness. Sausage had a very nice balance of meat and fat, with the fat roasted into oil making the sausage very juicy. The slightly crispy skin was a nice touch. Ribs and sausage were the absolute stars of the night. Briskets and turkey also had decent performance, good moisture in taste. Briskets's muscle fiber was a bit rough but still within a understandable spectrum. The other details on the table were also handled with care and precision. Homemade BBQ sauce integrated a favor of nice depth in sweet and very controlled sour, a little spice as a kick.

This food court eatery serves a grab bag of Asian food: Chinese Cantonese, Malaysian, and Vietnamese (pho and banh mi).\\n\\nThe menu is massive and looks more and more disorganized each time I pass by it, after checking out of the grocery store at H Mart.  It looks disorganized because they keep adding onto and changing the menu.  The good thing about the menu is almost every item is accompanied with a picture.  The bad thing about the menu is the aforementioned disorganization and \\"cutting and pasting\\" of item descriptions and prices.  It can be overwhelming for the first-time customer.\\n\\nWith that said, the food here is affordable.  Most entrees are less than $7.00.  Good deal.  I assume this is a Chinese (maybe Malaysian-Chinese) owned and operated business.  In other words, Vietnamese food is most likely not their forte.  Either way, I still ventured to try their pho.  Here are two dishes I've tried from this place:\\n\\nBasil chicken ($6.99)\\nBeef combination pho ($5.99)\\n\\nThe portion size for the basil chicken was very generous.  There was a lot of steamed, almost-too-wet white rice, topped with plenty of vegetables, a bit of chicken, and tons of sauce.  Vegetables included, but were not limited to, green beans, onions, basil, green bell pepper, carrots, and zucchini.  The chunks of chicken were tender, \\"fresh,\\" and flavorful enough.  At best, this entree was satisfactory.  More chicken, less sauce, and less watery rice would've been nice.\\n\\nI wasn't expecting, nor should you, a Buford Highway or Gwinnett County pho dac biet  (special combination pho) out of T1 Bento's beef combination pho.  However, I was still curious to try their pho since \\"Pho & Noodles\\" is displayed so prominently on their storefront.  T1's beef combination pho amounts to a medium-sized bowl of pho that includes beef meatballs and thin slices of ribeye accompanied with onion, cilantro, 2-3 slices of jalapeno, and a wedge of lime.\\n\\nThe broth was murky and sweet.  I thought it was weird I had to eat this bowl of pho with cheap disposable wooden chopsticks and a flimsy plastic spoon.  I also thought it was weird that this bowl was not accompanied with the usual pho sides (e.g. basil, culantro, bean sprouts, etc.).  Rather, everything you need is already in the bowl.  No Hoisin sauce either, but they do have Sriracha behind the counter which you may request.\\n\\nWith the pho, pretty much what I saw was what I got.  My advice: go to one of the standalone pho restaurants on Buford Highway if you want a real bowl of pho.\\n\\nAs far as service for this place, there isn't much to speak of, since you order and pick up your food at the counter.  I will say that I'm surprised at how fast the food comes out from the kitchen from this little shop.  Free water is available from the communal dispensers.  You can request (tiny) Styrofoam cups from any of the food court businesses.\\n\\nOverall, I wouldn't consider T1 Bento & Grill fantastic, but it works if you're in a pinch or too lazy to go anywhere else.  It's neither significantly better nor worse than its neighbors in the same food court."},{"name":"Antico Pizza","address":"1093 Hemphill Ave NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Part of me hates Antico.

For such a small space, you really do not need the volume to be that loud. They sat a group in front of one of the speakers and I could see all of them just yelling at each other. I'm sure the dj and the singer were good, but it was such a high volume.. all you could hear was noise. \\n\\nNot that this is the bartenders fault. But since we ordered a pitcher and it was sitting on the bar. A guy sitting near us just poured himself a drink from our pitcher. Excuse me, rude. I said something and he apologized. Very weird situation. \\n\\nWhen we were finally sat in the dining area I was excited to not have to yell at my friend. I was wrong. It was still rather loud in the dining room. It didn't make for a pleasant experience. When you are dining somewhere you want to be able to enjoy the meal and the company you have. Not have to yell at them across a small table. \\n\\nThe food: I ordered the patatas bravas, the fig dish, and the empanadas. Everything just tasted ok. I wish I ordered differently. I will say the bread for the table was rather good and the combo with the olive oil was delightful."},{"name":"Antico Pizza","address":"1093 Hemphill Ave NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Best Pizza hands down and a really fun, community atmosphere.

I'm not typically a dessert person and usually pass on it, but her explanation of the cheesecake was so decadent I had to give it a shot - especially since it's the special of the day.  I got it topped w/ strawberries.  CFC & Cheesecake..... I'm on a roll here.  Why not throw in 2 sticks of butter to go?   \\n\\nFood came out very quickly, I was impressed.  The manager here has been working at Jim's for over 20 years, he was extremely friendly and nice.  We discussed how Jim's has evolved throughout the years in Austin.

Okay, how about some crow gizzards and possum belly?  His jaws drop.  I was JK, dude.  \\n\\nThe CFS was pretty darn good, not too greasy.  The brown and white gravy rocked.

Are interactive and simulated rides more your style? Then Universal Studios is the perfect theme park for you. Interactive rides/simulated shows from your favorite films and TV shows such as Twister, Shrek 4D, Jimmy Neutron, Revenge of the Mummy, Terminator 2 3D, The Simpsons, Menn In Black, Jaws, ET, and more. There is only one rollercoaster at Universal Studios,  Revenge of the Mummy: The Ride (with the exception of the kid's coaster, Woody Woodpecker's Nuthouse Coaster) which is 20% simulated, and 80% coaster. Some of my favorites here, were the Terminator 2: 3-D (50% 3-D show, 50% actual actors) and the all-time classic, ET. One of the most technologically intriguing is The Disaster Show, where several guests are selected from the crowd to star in a film. What made it so interesting was the use of holographic images, where Christopher Walken appeared so surreal, as if he were really there. You have to see it with your own eyes. The new Simpsons Ride has been voted as the \\"World's Best New Theme Park Attraction\\". I beg to differ. The building was very cool, making you feel as if you are going into some massive Krustyland playhouse. The actual simulated ride was a bit disappointing and nauseating with the 360 degree domed screen. The Men In Black interactive shoot-em-up laser gun ride was fun, but it was a bit hard knowing how many times or where you have to shoot for the points to register.\\n\\nFood at Universal Studios is slightly more expensive than the Disney theme parks, but has a wide selection of choices (but don't expect ethnic diversity like the food at Disney's Epcot Center) laid out across the different areas of the theme park. Also make sure to bring a poncho if there is a chance of rain forecasted. Random thunder showers can fall leaving you drenched. You can wait it out, but not knowing how long each rainfall is, can get agitating and waste a lot of time. Universal Studio's sells a rain poncho at all their stores, but expect to pay $7 for a piece of plastic vinyl.\\n\\nParking is convenient.

The filet was a nice slab of meat.. cooked to my liking, which was medium rare. My filet sat on top of an extremely hot plate with melted butter. Ahh, this is your classic American food. Sometimes you just want something simple, classic with no twist to it. Finally, we ended our lunch with the bread budding, which was another hit.. especially the whiskey sauce. You definitely taste the whiskey, but not so strong that you can't handle it.

Both plates come out and look identical except for a pork rib on the Thurman plate. The waitress said the sides are the same size on both plates and the only difference was the meat portion. So we paid $7.00 for one pork rib. Really!!?. The brisket was moist, but because it was sliced about 1/16 of and inch thin, any meat can be made moist. It was also flavor less. The sausage and pork rib were \\"ok\\", but again lacking flavor. The waitress explained the mild and spicy sauce bottles to us, \\"ok\\" taste but not spicy at all. Beans are not what you would expect from a quality bar-b-q restaurant. Again \\"ok\\", taste like \\"ranch style\\" beans out of a can that I grew up on. The potato salad is a bust. Basically some smashed up potatoes with pickle juice and something else for a little color. No taste at all. Probably the best thing on the plate was the coleslaw. We also had some pecan pie. Another looser. Tasteless and mealy. Have lived in central Texas forever, been around the food industry for a good long while, and I have eaten at most of the well named Bar-b-q places.

If you are looking for an excellent Bloody Mary, go to Whiskeys nearby. \\n\\nThat said, the food was quite good and made up for it!  The Beef Tongue Rueben was delightful - the only thing I'd change would be to add more tongue - so delicious (if not gross sounding). The sausage pizza was an Italian style pizza- thin crust, thin sauce, spots of cheese. We added red peppers to it to give it a little spice. It was very tasty. If you like really cheesy, thick crusty meaty filling pizzas, this pizza is not for you.

Finding ourselves at the airport a little earlier than we needed to be, we had time to not just settle for lunch somewhere, but to actually enjoy it.  And boy did we enjoy our lunch at McCoys!\\n\\n   On the way in, a couple Hyatt staffers let us know we were heading to a great place for lunch. They recommended the burgers, cuban and the crawfish chowder.   Despite a menu that was tempting us in all kinds of directions, we went with all three of those suggestions, and were thrilled with those choices.\\n\\n   Chowder was exquisite!  Slightly spicy, creamy, with chunks of tender crawfish, and a lovely sherry taste, topped with a homemade \\"cracker\\", that was almost piecrust-like.  This was amazing, and for just five bucks for a cup...incredible!\\n\\n  Husband went with the Cuban and I went with the Meyers Natural Angus Burger. Both of us were happy that we were allowed to substitute the fried side dishes for salads.  Score!\\n\\n   Husband's response was that \\"this is a chef that CARES\\"  (seriously, he said that, and he's not a guy that normally says something like that).  He also said it was the best Cuban he's ever had...from the bread to the homemade mojo dipping sauce...he was in awe.  \\n\\n  I was equally mesmerized by my burger.  It came with two adorable little glass jars...one had the red onion jam that MADE this burger, and the other held a rich horseradish sauce that also added to the charm of this burger.  Perfectly cooked medium as requested, with a bakery-fresh bun and delicious white cheddar, topped with the most perfect tomato slices ever, and slices of crisp lettuce...I'm telling you, this is cheeseburger in paradise for SURE.  \\n\\n   Just guessing that they are used to having to tailor to such a variety of tastes, so they deliver all the special touches from dressings to toppings on the side, so you can make it your own.  \\n\\n   As if the food isn't incredible enough, we also had awesome service...and I kid you not, the prices were beyond reasonable!

Vegetables are ok here, with offerings such as spinach with beef, and lentil stew.  The roasted lamb was really nice, but since it was so large, a lot of it had lost heat and it was a bit lukewarm.  Most dishes were something special and more unique than most buffets.  The tabbouleh and hummus were really good. The dishes gave me a chance to sample Persian cuisine.

The ramen, namely the broth and the noodles, is pretty close to the original Totto's ramen. The pork, on the other hand, needs some work. It could be cooked a little longer because it's not as tender. The fatty parts are a lot more noticeable instead of melting in your mouth.

The attention to detail is fantastic, down to the street signs in old New York to the \\"Flaming Moe\\" drink in Springfield (which literally smokes) to the British signage and ads in King's Cross. If you're an avid fan of any of the different themes, you won't be disappointed.\\n\\n- The Harry Potter attractions in particular are phenomenal. You feel like you are literally in the movie. The Hogwarts Express between Universal Studios and Islands of Adventure was genius. You board the train, which looks exactly as it does in the movies, and instead of looking out a window at the swampland of Orlando, through video magic your window looks out at the streets of London and then the wizard world. \\n\\nThat was the good. Now here are things I wasn't really a fan of.\\n\\n- One Hit Wonder - Universal Studios may as well be called \\"Harry Potter Studios With Some Other Random Stuff Thrown In\\". It't clear that most park visitors are there for Harry Potter. The only other ride I felt was exceptional was the Despicable Me one. And the Simpsons world was well done. But most of the others (Jurassic Park, Twister, Men in Black, etc.) felt hopelessly dated. That reflected in the lines--the waits for Harry Potter were 2-3 hours, while the other attractions sat empty. The best way to alleviate crowd control is to build more things that crowds want to see. It didn't help that \\"worlds\\" like Amityville now make no sense given that the Jaws ride has shut down. \\n\\n- Poorly Managed Lines - We got to Universal Studios when the park opened and headed to Diagon Alley. There was a huge line there to get it, and when we finally got to the front of it we realized that everyone had been standing on line for no reason--you could just walk in and out. The fact that there were no park employees guiding us was disappointing. Worse, when we got on the line to Gringotts, there was mass confusion--could you leave the line to check items into the lockers? How long was the wait? Which line should you get on? \\n\\n- Poor Experience for people on line - We ended up waiting over 90 minutes on line, and 60 of those minutes were spent corralled into a nondescript holding area of lines weaving in and out. It wasn't until the last 30 minutes that you started to see some of the attraction (and at that point you were moving so fast you couldn't really enjoy it. \\n\\n- We paid extra for early entry into the parks, but we were prohibited from using it in Harry Potter world, the one place we needed it most. So much for paying hundreds of extra dollars. Again, an example where Disney with its Extra Magic Hours and Fastpass+ system is far superior. \\n\\n- Ride the Movies - I remember being blown away years ago the first time I rode Back the the Future (which sadly has been retired). But now, every one of these \\"movie rides\\" feels exactly the same. Put on your 3D glasses. Get jerked over to a scene where someone tells you something. Rotate to another scene where someone tells you something. Get picked up by a monster of some kind and thrown. Get spit on. Rotate to another scene where someone tells you you saved the day. Exit and return your glasses. It feels like they just use the same track for every one of their rides, and it gets pretty mundane after a while.  \\n\\n- Disney seems to have perfected the use of biometrics (thumb print scan) for park entry and re-entry. With Universal, both days I went I was stuck on line while people tried over and over again to get their fingerprint scans to work. \\n\\n- I noticed subtle things in how employees carried themselves. While at Disney, all the \\"cast members\\" pretty much all seem passionate and cheerful,, at Universal it was very hit or miss. Some employees at some of the rides seemed to take the initiative on their own to immerse themselves into their roles, but that seems to be the exception. On line at Harry Potter, I saw a girl in an elf costume who looked like she was just counting the hours to close out time. It's subtle things like this that make all the difference, something that Disney understands. \\n\\nTo sum up, when I left Disney, I felt like I got what I paid for and more. With Universal, well, let's just say that back in 1928, Universal Studios screwed Walt Disney by ripping Oswald from him. Ever since then, they've been playing catch-up with the Mouse. This theme park is no exception."},{"name":"Maria's Pastry Shop","address":"46 Cross St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Much more accessible than Mike's and anything else in the heart of the North End.

The menu was extensive. I didn't think before ordering to inquire if the cauliflower bisque was soy-based or dairy-based. By the time I returned from washing my hands, a cup of it was sitting by my place setting. I am certain it was soy-based. I couldn't send it back, since it had already been served, yet I should avoid soy for a certain health reason. The flavor was interesting, but neither here-nor-there, more like a melange of flavors than that of cauliflower. \\n\\nI think the establishment should state on the menu if anything which is traditionally prepared with a cream base, like a bisque, is actually soy-based; otherwise, it is very misleading. And puzzling, since they described everything else in elaborate detail. Also, I would have preferred if the waitress had waited to serve it until I had returned to the table, especially since it was not particularly busy at that time. There were other indications throughout the meal that the waitress was either inexperienced and untrained, or just couldn't be bothered to do things properly.\\n\\nWe split the pizza of the day, with caramelized onions, red peppers, and other goodies, and it was chewy and delicious - not at all greasy, and definitely enough for two. We also split a spinach salad with grilled pears and a fabulous, light dressing. We drank mineral water with a hefty splash of fresh lemon juice, which was refreshing. Good food. \\n\\nThe atmosphere was another thing. It was sweltering in there, let alone in the corner, with no apparent ventilation - no discernible air conditioning, no fan, no open windows, on an 80-degree, muggy day. By 7:00, as the tables started to fill up, the noise level became excruciatingly painful, close to sonic-boom level, with everyone talking louder and louder to be heard, and the tables right on top of each other. \\n\\nBetween the heat, stillness and noise, I began to feel faint and bolted outside. After my friend paid the bill and was about to leave, I returned and told the waitress that I enjoyed the food, but the room was hot and noisy to an extent that I had to leave. She shrugged and replied defensively, \\"It's a small space,\\" to which the other waiter nodded in agreement, implying that they did not care. What an ungracious response to a polite comment of concern from someone who was simply attempting to remind them of their customers' expectations for a pleasant dining atmosphere, even in a casual place like this one. \\n\\nPerhaps they think this atmosphere makes it seem like a hip, happening place. To me it seems amateurish, and I would not plan to return. There are plenty of other places to get a casual, light, moderately-priced, meatless meal on that same block, let alone in the immediate area.

And since several of us came from California, they wanted to give us the full experience and drive us to the original location (versus the \\"new\\" restaurant nearer their house).  While I was not the driver, we did have to take a 45 minute drive to Driftwood to get to the mecca of Austin BBQ.\\n\\nFirst impression:  once we drove off the country road to follow the signs, there were Texas State Trooper directly traffic through the parking lot.  Note:  do not stop your car to drop anyone off at the entrance.  The troopers do not appreciate this.  So, we drove through the dusty and unpaved parking lot until we could find a space.  Even at the early hour of 5:30, the lot was almost full.\\n\\nWhile the rest of our party hung out in the waiting area as they prepared our table, my wife & I looked through the General Store.  They had a few shirts on sale, as well as some BBQ sauces, a dry rub, and some sundry gifts.  I knew I would purchase some gifts after dinner, but they called our party to be seated right then.\\n\\nThe 14 of us sat at a very long table with bench seating on both sides.  While there were menus on the table, all of us ordered the family style meal, which is all-you-can-eat pork ribs, beef brisket and sausage, along with unlimited rolls, baked beans, cole slaw, pickles and onions.  And this only cost $20 per person.  (I don't want to even think how much that would cost in California!)  We also ordered drinks; I got an iced tea (at the Salt Lick, always unsweetened).\\n\\nSoon afterwards, the waitress brought us all the sides, and then two large platters full of the meat.  The meat had some of their mild sauce pour over it (not too much, just to get a taste), but the table held some other sauces, too, including a tart vinegar sauce and some hot sauce.  The sausage was good, and the ribs had a good taste to them, my favorite was the brisket.  It had a nice smoke ring, and the bark was very flavorful.  I wish they hadn't sauced the meat ahead of time, so I could taste the meat by itself.  But the sauce was good, too.\\n\\nMy dinner companions dove in right away, chowing down on the food with reckless abondon, but I slowly made my way through my plate.  We did order several more portions of everything, and the waitress kept on bringing the heaping plates to us.  Eventually, everyone stopped eating, but I kept on plugging away, until all the meat was gone.\\n\\nOne thing that tripped me up on this place.  I guess the county that the Salt Lick resides is dry, so no alcohol is sold in the restaruant.  Many people brought in their own beer in coolers, including some of our friends.  But I also noticed that the Salt Lick now has a winery and offers wine tastings?  WTF?!?  I'm so confused.\\n\\nAnyway, some folks got some pecan pie a la mode, but I was too full from all the meat to order dessert.  I could get pecan pie anywhere, but BBQ this good doesn't come my way this often.  \\n\\nAfter paying our bill, I ran to the general store and bought a few shirts and bottles of sauce for gifts.\\n\\nOverall, I had a great experience.  If I come again, I'll probably order a plate of beef ribs, just to try them out."},{"name":"Great American Tavern","address":"303 Main St","city":"North Reading","stars":"2.5","text":"It was OK.

Their raw oysters were delicious, fresh, and clean (try the Aunt Dotty's!) as was the salmon crudo. For entrees we had the potato latke dish (not impressed...the latke was rather flavorless and overfried, the smoked salmon was such a tiny portion, and the eggs which were supposedly sunny side up were over fried and the yolks were no longer runny), the nori bagel (really delicious tunafish salad on a warm nori bagel, this was a hit!), the fish sandwich (I didn't try it but the person who had it really liked it), and the mussels (tasty and plentiful mussels). The fries and onion rings were delicious but overpriced for the small portion size you receive. Service was slow but it was Sunday brunch so very crowded. For some reason, our raw order was re-written on another slip (I don't know if that's part of their operational practice or what) and whoever did so wrote it incorrectly so we didn't get 4 that we had ordered and they also forgot to bring out a drink we had ordered.

I remember going to the website and finding zero reservations for a party of two. I was crushed. Luckily, I placed myself on the waiting list for July 5th, knowing we would be going out to celebrate our 7th wedding anniversary that night. \\n Month's later I am haunted by the incredible press and accolades that Langbaan continues to accumulate. I check for reservations occasionally but never find anything available. Then, as I sit at my desk packing my stuff up to head home one Tuesday afternoon, I get a text message. A table for two has opened up on July 5th at 5:30! I had 15 minutes to reserve it, so thank goodness I was just sitting around. Good fortune had clearly smiled upon me. \\n The day arrives, we have already looked over the prix fixe menu a dozen times. Every dish seems as though it was created just for us! It's a central Thailand themed menu, heavy on greens, coconut milk and seafood. All our favorites. \\n The meal starts with three snacks. first a delicious prawn and naval orange  wrapped in a tasty leaf. These are followed by rice cups filled with tender scallops and a sweet lemony coconut sauce which blows.my.mind. The hand woven egg net filled with pork and water chestnuts and topped with a pickled cucumbers totally wows us too. Each snack is two of three bites which is larger than we were expecting. Next comes soup which luckily we don't have to share. Savory pork meatballs, cuttlefish and greens in a rich broth. Then, two salads; the octopus is my husbands favorite with thai basil and a creamy dressing. The octopus is cooked perfectly, it's soft and savory, not chewy. I preferred the salmon with pickled watermelon skins which are a little spicy. \\n Finally, it's time for the main course. We are given all three entrees and a bowl of rice at once and instructed on which to eat first. The cod and fermented rice starts us off, we pile it onto leaves and cucumber boats. Next, the Peking duck with spicy dipping sauce. This is a dish I have always wanted to try and it did not disappoint. The third entree is a main lobster which is soft and sweet, served in a coconut curry. The rice is a great tool for mopping up all the delicious sauces. \\n At this point we are stuffed. I don't know how anyone has room for any wine with all this food. Dessert is coming though and as soon as I see it I know I can make room. It's a coconut granita with melon balls and tapioca pearls. It's incredible and light. Then, one more dessert because why not. It's a warm coconut custard. It's so thick it's almost like a little cake, and somehow it's the perfect end to the meal. \\n The food aside, the staff really goes the extra mile to make this an incredible experience. They explain everything as they place the for in front of you, they keep the table clean and effortlessly move from dish to dish. The chefs are nearby and you can watch them systematically prepare each plate. It's perfection, from beginning to end. They have thought of everything. If you ever have the opportunity to eat here, take it in an instant. You will never forget it."},{"name":"Pizzeria La Sorrentina","address":"3000 SE 164th Ave, Ste 107","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4.5","text":"Really a great experience including quality, efficiency and friendly service.

I didn't taste the lemongrass, lime leaf or lime at all. The soup was supposed to be sour, not too spicy and a bit salty. All we tasted was sweet and way too much coconut milk. The soup was not supposed to be thick. It tasted more like a red curry to us. The sea bass fillet with garlic, chilli and lime (pla ma-nao) was decent.  Papaya salad (som-tum) was not bad and it came with sticky rice (kao-niew) and 3 very thin slices of pork jerky.

We're all about food, and wanted to have a decent dinner before I hopped on a bus back to New York. After a few hours of perusing restaurant week menus and reviews on Yelp, we decided Antico Forno would be the place to have that decent dinner. And for the most part, the food was good, but our experience was disgusting.\\n\\nWe called a few hours ahead, made reservations, and were immediately seated upon arrival. The hostess was friendly and everything started on the right foot. The waiter was not the friendliest or most communicative while taking our orders, but he got everything down and was at least polite.\\n\\nThey brought us a bread basket, with some olives in oil. We were starving, so we demolished the bread in a couple of minutes. It was delicious.  \\n\\nOur appetizers came: arancini di riso (rice balls stuffed with bolognese sauce, green peas and fontina cheese, house tomato sauce) and melanzane (roasted eggplant topped with mozzarella and tomato then baked to perfection, topped with basil pesto). (Parenthetical descriptions from their menu.)\\n\\nI took a bite from the periphery of my giant rice ball and was very pleased with its taste, so I cut it in half to dig right in and it was frozen solid in the middle. Luckily, it seemed like my snowball arancini was an outlier. The other one at the table was perfectly fine, and the waitress who whisked it away for a fresh one was very apologetic. She said it was one of the most popular items that night.  And for good reason. It was definitely a solid appetizer, even for something that was premade and defrosted.\\n\\nBut before my replacement or our entrees had arrived, a terrible thing happened.  As previously mentioned, we immediately downed the bread basket. But one of us investigated the basket for leftover morsels because we were that hungry. Instead of bread, we found small, dark, nut-shaped nuggets at the bottom.  \\"What are these?\\" Closer inspection (taking them out of the basket) revealed that they were wet.\\n\\nAnd then we realized they were olive pits.  Wet, spit-out olive pits.  And all five of our olive pits were accounted for on our plate.  You know what that means.\\n\\nTHERE WERE WET, SPIT-OUT OLIVE PITS FROM A PREVIOUS CUSTOMER AT THE BOTTOM OF OUR BREAD BASKET.\\n\\nWe called over our waiter and asked him what he thought the dark little things were. He remained uncommunicative, and shrugged off our question, and so we pointed out that they were olive pits from someone else. He mumbled \\"sorry\\", grabbed the basket away, and brought it to the back.\\n\\nWe obviously asked to speak to a manager the next time someone came to the table. She immediately came over, and it was clear that she thought our complaint would be about the frozen appetizer. Which we did briefly mention.  But she had no idea about the olive pits, and was absolutely stunned when my friend filled her in.  She had no response but \\"that is absolutely disgusting. There is no excuse for that.\\"  And you could tell she was extremely angry that she heard about this from the customers, and not the wait staff who had been informed of the issue.\\n\\nAfter a few more visits to the table, and a lot of sincere apologies, she eventually told us that our entire meal would be on the house. (Though she initially tried to give us free drinks to make up for it -- we were all sick, tired of drinking after St. Patrick's, or in the middle of a study day, so no alcohol for us. Though even if I was drinking I'm not sure I would have taken a free glass of sangria to make up for the fact that someone's spitty olive pit touched the bread I ate).\\n\\nBut back to the food (yes, I know, we continued eating here but we were hungry and she assured us over and over and over again that this was not something that happened frequently).\\n\\nTwo of us had the Bistecca Pizzaiola (braised short rib topped with saut√©ed peppers and onions, smoked scamorza gratin, balsamic condimento) which was somewhat disappointing by their accounts. They thought the dish was a little too lukewarm and didn't have enough food. It was basically a pile of meat with very little else.  It needed a starch or just something more.\\n\\nMy Cannelloni con Pollo e Spinaci (cannelloni stuffed with chicken, spinach and ricotta cheese, baked with roast garlic cream sauce) was great. There was a somewhat uneven distribution of chicken and spinach (with one cannelloni being all chickened out and one being all chickened up), but the roast garlic cream sauce was delightful. It was on the thinner side but packed with flavor. I certainly enjoyed it.\\n\\nDessert was take it or leave it: bread pudding and cannolis, I've had better and I've had worse.\\n\\nHaving someone one else's spittle on the table should be one star, automatically.  I'm giving two stars because the food was pretty good and the manager handled the situation well.  Given the circumstances, however, I will not return."},{"name":"Adobe Rose Cafe","address":"1634 SE Bybee Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"My wife and I love this place and eat there almost weekly.

From what I've heard, there's usually a veryyy long wait, especially on weekends. It's yummy enough though, it might just be worth it.\\n\\nA few people in our group straggled in later so we started with a round of drinks for the folks who were on time. They have some great beer and wine options, but they don't have a full liquor license.

Not a big deal, but if all you're into is whiskey or something, be forewarned.\\n\\nWe started with a cheese and meat spread that we chose ourselves. It was all wicked delicious, but for the price, the serving of each meat/cheese is quite small. It was fun for a special occasion, but I'd recommend making your own charcuterie boards at home to be more economical. \\n\\nI loved that for main courses you had the option to opt for half sizes on the pasta dishes. After sharing starters, I loved being able to order a cheaper/smaller main course that I actually could finish instead of wasting a bunch of food.

They also brought me a little cupcake in a jar with a candle for my birthday which was a really sweet touch to end the meal. \\n\\nI will say I was a little disappointed in our server. Like I said, we lingered over drinks to start as we waited for some late arrivals, so she definitely tried to take food orders a few times when we weren't ready yet. Then once the whole group was there I think she was annoyed with us for taking so long cause we would go 30 or 40 minutes without being checked in on at all.

This place is much more for families and you can tell by the absence of really really good rides. I'm not a big fan of the one in Cali... but I can say for sure that this one is better. The Mummy ride is cool, it is an inside in the dark roller coaster... so hold on to your hat!! That's how my bf lost his and had to wear the extra cap that I had packed for him... Spongebob, HAHA!! The Terminator one is more of watching a movie than a ride... it's like those 3-d movies with the effects from your seat. That is the same story with the Sherk ride... although I believe that is also on DVD as the Sherk 3-d movie that came out a while back as a special... I actually have it too, so I should watch it again to see if it really is the same one, I could be wrong!! Most the other rides are just like watching some behind the scene special effects, after all this is a movie park! Needless to say, I'd probably wouldn't really spend the money to come here again if it weren't for The Simpsons & Men in Black ride... and the fact that you can get it with the Islands of Adventure ticket (I'd go there again!!!)"},{"name":"Chambar","address":"568 Beatty Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"We were visiting Vancouver for 3 nights and decided to try Chambar.

At first I thought Kal√© was a goofy/faux-sophisticated way to name a restaurant after the leafy vegetable, but it made sense instantly when I saw the sign in Katakana. Clever stuff. Being almost smack in the middle of downtown Portland, close to Nordstrom, Banana Republic, and Target, location is obviously central and convenient. Parking is fairly plentiful downtown, particularly after 7pm.\\n\\nThe interior is unlike most Japanese casual dining in that it's not small and intimate, which threw me off a bit on my first visit. In contrast, Kale has tall ceilings and expansive seating options, but does contain some faux-tatami areas reminiscent of Izakayas. \\n\\nKale closes early (8pm), but I suspect two reasons - most of the customers go for lunch and Makoto-San (the owner) doesn't want to compromise other aspects of his life (which I respect).\\n\\nFood:\\n\\nGordon Ramsay would approve - Kal√© has a compact, focused menu that attempts to deliver mastery in a few areas. The curry is legit Japanese comfort food, and is prepared in an interesting way. I'm more used to having dishes like Katsu Curry or Hamburger Curry, where there are chunks of meat in the sauce, but in this case the meat and vegetables are ground into the sauce, so the end result is a hot meaty paste. Interesting, but you might end up questioning how much substance actually made it into the curry. The curries are also somewhat customizable - you can add as many toppings (at $1 each) to your heart's content. I'm a big fan of the Fukujinzuke (pickled daikon) and spinach! All told, the curry doesn't sit very heavily in your stomach afterwards (unlike most curries) yet you'll feel very full and satisfied. \\n\\nAnd did I mention the $2/$2.50 (for \\"Premium\\"/Import beers like Fat Tire or Sapporo) beers? Outrageous prices - admittedly half the reason I go.\\n\\nService: \\n\\n...and the other half is for the homemade, authentic feel and service. The owner (Makoto-San) is very passionate about his craft, has great enthusiasm, and is keen to build great rapport with his customers (we arrived one day after closing time and he apologized by handing us a pack of Hi-Chew - haha). He's always up for conversation and has a bucketful of easy smiles. Service is extremely quick (curries are usually ready within a minute) Besides, not too many places where I can brush up on my Japanese in such a friendly environment. Only drawback might be that you'll have to bus your own table (as part of his business model), but I really don't mind considering the minimal staff, low prices, and quick food turnaround time. It's really a great place to spend a bit of time in the evening.\\n\\nValue: \\n\\nI've already mentioned the crazy cheap beers, but generally great value here (you'll see this as a theme in my reviews). Regular curries are around $7, and already come with Fukujinzuke - additional toppings at $1 each, but admittedly that can add up quickly. Good sit down meal for the price (usually ends up being ~$9 for me with beer).\\n\\nOverall: \\n\\nProbably down to personal preference, but Kale has a unique, homecooked feel, whereas I'm usually into a more unhealthy, industrial Japanese curry experience. But there's a reason why I've made Kal√© a must-go ritual every week for Japanese comfort food. Makoto-San's enthusiasm and passion for his craft, the fact that somehow the curry doesn't feel \\"heavy\\" after eating, coupled with the insanely cheap beers, has made Kal√© a weekly appointment for me.

It's a very cleaned-up version of every breakfast/sandwich joint you've ever been to.  The WASPs of West Peabody wouldn't dirty their pretty fingers in a greasy spoon, so this place had to be built.  I went here today with my parents and my mom ordered a chicken salad club.  The first time around, a hamburger club came out, and on the second try a grilled chicken club came out.  Finally, right around the time that my father and I were finishing, the meal she ordered in the first place arrived at the table.  What was most infuriating was that there was no deduction on the bill or any indication that they had screwed up 2 times.  \\nOh, for the record, my father didn't care for his salad, and the grilled chicken in my sandwich had the same consistency as the sole on the shoes I was wearing.\\nI won't be rushing back.

She assured me she would let our waitress know and it would be no problem, she even asked me how I wanted it billed to the check. Dinner goes by and we order food, the garlic shrimp was amazing but the empandas had no taste to them, the beef tenderloins looked and tasted gross. The lobster ravioli was ok but nothing to brag about. The evening comes to a close and I promised my friend a surprise, well the only one surprised was me when we asked for the bill and she brought it with no cake, no singing nothing. So I politely ask her what happened and the waitress tells me, oh well you didn't ask for it, and I told her I told the hostest she then responds yea she told me but I was waiting for you to mention it. Ok, if I'm trying to surprise someone why would I tell the waitress again, after I already made it clear and told them how I was going to pay for it.

Last night was a disappointment and although a minor annoyance enough so that I write about it in the hopes the management will address as we do enjoy the restaurant. We were eating dinner on the early side as both of us had skipped lunch. Walking into an empty restaurant one expects to get in and out fairly quickly however the hostess felt compelled to take a phone call while we were standing in front of her. After we waited and listened to her conversation for a while a waiter finally took us to a table. Once seated we realized we were between meals and they were short of staff. Our waiter made up for that as he was quite attentive and brought bread, water and wine promptly. My issue is we were presented with two menus, the every day one and a prix fixe which had an entre that really appealed to me. However I was told there were NO substitutions.

My theory is that people see Yelp and realize that it is the \\"it\\" place to go to, so they come to the north end some weekend night, wait in line for an hour and you sit in a cramped dinning room, are forced to pay in all cash and at the end of it, they think that this was a fun authentic experience and rate the restaurant higher than it is.\\n\\nI live around the corner so decided to pop in one cold winter night when there was no line and found the food average and affordable. Rating on the food alone, I would give 3 stars as I am neutral: I've had better Italian food but I've also had much worse. What bumps it down to 2 stars is a combination of all the other crap, which may some consider \\"part of the experience.\\" Maybe they think they are getting a taste of the old north end and while Giacomo's is a nice break from the more upscale restaurants which have become the norm in the north end, I just don't understand the appeal of waiting in line and eating elbow to elbow with strangers.\\n\\nIt would be one thing if their food was amazing but I feel you could go to The Daily Catch, Assagios, or La Familia Georgio's and get similar food for similar prices.

There are dozens of kinds of curry paste used in Thai cuisine, which all taste very different.   My green curry chicken tasted like a decent penang curry, which is sweet and red.  I asked the waitress (who is Thai, so she should know better) why they used penang curry paste to make green curry, and her response was \\"This is OUR green curry.  See, it has green beans and green peas, that makes it green curry\\".  Uh....not quite, sweetheart.  Green curry has a distinctive flavor and this wasn't even close.  Green curry dishes are also characterized by the use of basil, which helps create the flavor - no basil in sight.\\n\\nCurry paste has a limited shelf life, so apparently they make only one kind to save money and use it for all their curry dishes.  I have never eaten in a Thai restaurant that would even consider doing this, until now.\\n\\nI'm amused by a previous reviewer who always bases her review on how good the Pad Thai is.  Pad Thai is considered street food in Thailand, commonly ordered from street vendors as a quick snack.  It is rarely served in restaurants.

We were at the restaurant on a Tuesday night around 7:30 and the music was cranked up to late night Saturday levels. Totally ridiculous.

The tacos just aren't up to par. My friend had tried the fish tacos at the private opening and liked them but this time she ordered the chicken tacos and I ordered the carne asada tacos.

So freakin' delicious I stole half of my husband's. \\n\\nTo sum up, service was great, the noise level  was off the charts unpleasant, the tacos were three times the prices of Taqueria del Sol and not as good.

I walked in expecting a warm, communal style atmosphere, where strangers exchanged Mmms and Aaaahs over a shared passion for the pizza that was melting in their mouths.

Those of us accustomed to scanning for key words and phrases such as 'foie gras' 'seasoned with pancetta'  or honing in on the lackluster pasta/salad/soup offerings have to rejoice when gifted with the menu at Red Lentil. \\n\\nThe options range from the Asian-influenced 'Nirvana' plate , nori and sesame crusted tofu with mustard greens and maple-tamari sauce (a recent special) to Southwestern (sweet potato quesadilla, black beans, avocado) and uniquely delicious (pisatchio and herb encrusted tofu with corn cakes, spinach and a jalapeno drizzle). Though these are just a few of the main dishes and specials, there are also great sides, salads and desserts to choose from. Drinks are of the non-alcoholic sort, so if you're looking to booze while enjoying the meal, tough luck. Go for the ginger brew or the fresh made juices and fetch your glass of wine for another locale.\\n\\nOn a recent Saturday  night visit, service was quick and getting a table was no problem. Our waiter was attentive without being clingy, although refills for water weren't automatic (a wave of the hand solved that). There were tons of specials, but we both went with the pistachio encrusted tofu, as it sounded like something I'd never replicate at home (regardless of my culinary skills). We also shared the belgian sweet potato fries, and had a ginger brew (Reed's). \\n\\nThe entrees were cooked perfectly, nothing was too oily or too dry, and the combination of ingredients in  the corn cakes made for a crunchy yet soft treat.

The tofu was fabulous, and for those of you who simply tolerate tofu or lower your expectations when ordering it in any non-stir fry dish, get ready to savor the soy.\\n\\nWe abstained from desserts, but they look luscious and are mostly vegan (or all vegan).

We had to wait a bit to get seated despite having a reservation, but waiting an extra 5 minutes didn't mean much else to me when you have a gigantic craft beer selection at the bar awaiting you. I did partake in several of the local brews available, enjoying every drink that I had (which was a few) over the course of dinner. We did eventually get seated, and our food came out in a pretty orderly fashion - never having to wait too long.\\n\\nAs for the food, it started out really well. I'm used to clam chowder done New England-style generally being thicker in the Northeast, but I was pleasant surprised that the chowder here was much more in the mold of what I've had out in SF - more on the brinier side with thinner broth, but with stronger flavors than what you find out west. I really liked it quite a bit, especially since it didn't leave me feeling too full going into the rest of the meal. The oyster selection is quite impressive - and even though there's almost an exclusive focus (IIRC) on East Coast oysters, there was still enough variety that you didn't end up simply tasting those that resided on the briny side of the spectrum. In particular, I really appreciated those that had a cleaner finish to them. For the main course, I got the fish stew, which was really well-done. If anything, I liked it because it didn't throw in every last kind of fish that was in the kitchen; instead, it focused on a few (monkfish for your typical fish; mussels for the shellfish; and a dash of spicy chorizo to mix it up and add a bit more depth and flavor) and did them really well. Surprisingly, I liked it better than the lobster roll, which (and this is probably heretical to say) was a bit bland...and have had better back in New York. At least for the nearly $30 price tag, it certainly didn't make me feel like I got a roll that smacked it out of the park, even though the lobster was certainly fresh. We finished it off with butterscotch pudding, which was really good - much more creamy and less thick than I thought it would be, and with a highly tempered flavor that doesn't overwhelm like I recall it doing when I was younger.\\n\\nLobster roll aside, everything was done pitch-perfect at Row 34, and I'd highly recommend it to seafood and beer lovers alike. With an ambiance and spaciousness that recalls what was probably used as a warehouse in the past, it's a great (slightly upscale) casual place to kick back with friends and have a delicious meal. I don't come to Boston that frequently (this was my first time in 13 years), but I'd make a strong effort to come back next time I do visit."},{"name":"Western Bikeworks","address":"5741 NE 87th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"As much as you want to hate the new, big, chain-store like shop in the neighborhood, everyone here is actually very nice and extremely helpful.

Even then, it was brought to our table in to-go boxes even though we were seated and dining in. \\n\\nThis place was rated the best Thai food in the Boulder weekly, so we at least expected the food to taste good. In fact, it was awful. I wanted fresh spring rolls, but they don't offer them (first Thai restaurant in my experience to not have fresh spring rolls). I ordered the fried version instead. What arrived was four greasy soggy oil tubes stuffed with flavorless cabbage on a plain white plate. Even the sauce was non-descript brown stuff. There was absolutely no detectable spice whatsoever.\\n\\nThe Pad Thai came with enough portion to easily make three meals out of, but again, was bland and flavorless. The only flavor was the fresh lime i squeezed over it with a finish of the dirty oil it was cooked in. The menu stated it came with egg, but there was none to be found. \\n\\nMy friends' dishes were not much better. The green curry was just okay, but had some strange bright green color suggesting food coloring. I don't know what the other dish was, but it had some basic bland brown soy based sauce with no detectable spice. On her first bite, she complained immediately that there was some kind of grit that she bit onto.\\n\\nI've eaten Thai food everywhere. Thai food is all about the intricate lively bright spices and herbs and delicious sauces. With such a high rating we had high expectations, Honestly, we would not have cared about the plain interior or slow service either if the food was fantastic.

Third time sent back, Dad didn't want any more beans at this point!!  Come to find out, the burner wasn't on under the beans.  What ever happened to quality control?

Give it a try and you'll see what I mean. Anyway, I had the drunken noodle dish with wide flat noodles which was very good and my husband had a Vietnamese sandwich with chicken that tasted like roast beef. According to the wait staff, the chicken is marinated in a sweet sauce that give it the unique flavor. I usually only go to certain Asian and other ethnic restaurants that I feel safe in going to.

The Hogzilla bao was a disappointment, the sauce over powered the natural flavors of the pork belly and was kinda on the salty side. Maybe it was just because the Hogzilla flavor was so overpowering but the Glen Rhee bao tasted like the Hogzilla, the only difference was the Asian pear salsa on top. We loved the OMG because the fish was perfectly battered and paired well with the tartar sauce. The Kickin chicken reminded me of the chick fila sandwich in bao form. Perfectly cooked chicken, not to dry. The tots were good, can't really mess up tater tots, I want to try the pork next time. The igloo dessert bao was different but in a good way.

I make it at home when I have time and I always have enough to eat for days.. I digress.\\n\\nCame across this restaurant on Yelp and decided to go in to give it a try. I love Japanese curry rice so this was a no-brainer. The restaurant have no waiters as it is a pay-and-pick-up-at-the-counter setup, but the interior ambiance definitely exudes a better atmosphere than your typical order-at-the-counter joint. It's nicely lit, with tatami seating as well as your traditional table and chair seating. I can definitely see this as a place to grab a bite and chill with some friends over their $2.50 beer. \\n\\nNow onto the curry rice. It is served on a large, flat plate as is the norm in Japan, with rice on one side and curry on the other. The curry is nicely flavored, definitely better than the packaged roux you get at your Asian supermarkets. The rice is nicely cooked as well. My only complaint is that the portion is a bit on the small side.. If you are a girl, I think it should be just fine, but if you are a guy or someone with a bigger appetite, you probably would not feel \\"full\\" afterwards. For the price, I think it's fine but a bit more food would be nice. Also, the curry Doria is quite good, which is basically your curry covered in a layer of baked cheese.

I made a lot of very good decisions but this unfortunately was not one of them.  Maybe it was just a problem with the language barrier but it ended up being a most uncomfortable evening. \\n\\n\\nI had read about how good Pal Campo's sangrias were so we went there to see for ourselves.  We asked the girl at the check-in desk if we could sit at the bar and be called once a table was ready.  The lady behind the bar was very nice and gave us tastes of both kinds of sangria and we ended up choosing the white.  A man asked us what size we wanted and we quickly became confuse and were assured the $16 glasses were the best deal.  I noticed they had pitchers listed on the menu so I asked to do that instead.  The man pulled out a beer pitcher before saying he couldn't do that.  I did not ask for a huge beer pitcher full, I asked him for the $24.99 pitcher they had on the menu.  We ended up getting these 16 oz. jelly jars that were mainly ice for $16.00.  I felt like I had been hustled.\\n\\nWe continued to sit at the bar and were asked if we wanted to eat there but we told them we would prefer a table.  There was a bit of a language problem so we were not sure we were going to be seated and decided we would just leave if we were not seated by the time we finished our overpriced sangrias.\\n\\nWe were surprised to be seated in the dining room just before we finished our sangrias.  I had a glass of water in the bar but I was very thirsty from the heat so I asked for another glass.  The first glass was poured from a jug and tasted like drinking water.  My second glass was not.  It tasted like it had come straight out of the swamp.  I was so thirsty and the taste of the water made me nauseas so I asked for some ice tea which is also listed on the menu.  The waitress told me they did not carry ice tea.  I guess their menu is more of a joke than a real menu?\\n\\nOk, time for my rant.  I have a huge problem with restaurants that claim they are high quality and charge high prices but are too cheap to put in a simple water filter for their drinking water.  It shows a total lack of class and respect for their customers.  End of rant. \\n\\nI ordered the Chuleta Kan Kan.  It is a huge pork chop that is deep fried.  It truly was a huge chunk of pork but it was dry and over salty and I had a hard time eating it with only swamp water to wash it down so I ended up taking most of it to go.\\n\\nJust to follow up on the sangrias, they were not near as good once they were so watered down with ice.  We did not realize it but the price included the glass which was something we really had no use for and was more of a burden.  A refill was $11.00 which seemed overpriced when we knew it was going to be heavily watered down with ice."},{"name":"The Porter Beer Bar","address":"1156 Euclid Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"A friend introduced me to this spot in L5P today, and I cannot thank her enough.  Two days later and I'm still nursing my post-NYE celebration post-hangover-but-its-all-still-upsidedown-strangeness, so beer was off the menu -- although the selection was extensive, and nicely paired with meals for you.  In lieu of beer, I had the best black bean burger of my life!  It wasn't some frozen patty thawed on the skillet, but rather a fresh mash of quinoa and black beans, cooked up nicely, and heaped with feta, and topped with tomato, lettuce and onion, served on a delicious aziago roll -- something like aziago or foccacia.  What's even better is that the side salad that was served with it was easily the best side salad I've ever had -- with a veggie burger no less!  Don't know what was in it (base was arugala), but it was delish.  And all for $8.50.  Hell ya, I'm going back.  Atmosphere was cozy, old-school with lots of raw wood surfaces and old americana artifacts (although it was bordering on too much of a constructed atmosphere/experience).  Service was friendly, if a little cordial, and prompt.  The place was dead (or at least slow) when I went (1:30pm), but with the tight quarters I could see the experience being a little more cramped and complicated during a crowded evening dinner (which I believe influenced many of the other ratings).
