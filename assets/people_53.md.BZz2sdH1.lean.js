I decided to go back after a long absence last week, and boy was I shocked.\\n\\nSome other recent reviews have alluded to the fact that the Salem Diner was sold to Salem State, which just happens to be across the street. I cannot say for certain this is true. But if one looks at the evidence, the hypothesis seems to be supported.\\n\\nWhen I walked into the diner, I was overpowered by a sort of general \\"old man\\" smell. I thought they might have repainted, and that was what I was smelling. But I looked around and realized this place probably looked pretty close to the way it did in the 40's, so that couldn't possibly be the case.\\n\\nI briefly considered leaving, because the smell was almost too much to bear. I wondered if the (few) other patrons could smell it too, and were just too polite to mention it. But then the waitress came over to get my order, and I elected not to leave. Instead, I ordered the eggs benedict and a hot tea...\\n\\nImmediately I was overcome with regret. The smell of the place hanging in my nostrils, as if I was in a badly run nursing home. But still I stayed. I had ordered, and I had to honor my commitment to this place. I glanced over at the ketchup bottle. \\"Hunt's\\" it read. That says it all. A restaurant that serves Hunt's ketchup instead of Heinz is all done giving a shit. The evidence that this place had been sold off was mounting....\\n\\nI received my food, It looked decent enough. The potatoes were all cut to uniform size, small cubes, as if prepared in a factory. \\"No human cuts potatoes like this\\" I thought to myself. I squeezed a blotch of Hunt's inferior ketchup onto the plate and began eating, and I ate until the food was gone. The eggs benedict part was decent. Nothing special, and I'm pretty sure I've had better literally EVERY other time I've had it. The potatoes weren't anything special at all. I would say the best part of this meal was the hot tea I ordered to drink. \\n\\nIf I had to describe the food at the Salem Diner, I would liken it to the Hunt's ketchup I was forced to use with my home fries...It's incredibly mediocre, and shows apathy on the part of the ownership.

We somehow made the drive all the way back to Long Island without laying a hand inside the pastry box.  Once we got home we dug in and I was a tad disappointed.  The caramel turtle brownie tasted like it had been sitting in the window for too long; The frosting just didn't taste freshness.  The cake part of the brownie was fairly dry as well.  The peanut butter brownies were just loaded with frosting and fudge, more fresh than the first but still not the quality flavor I expected.\\n\\nI didn't like the cannolis either.

No manager came over to acknowledge the fuck up with a proper apology or some kiss ass for the horrible service which by the way my table was never  cleaned of appetizer dishes and salad plates the whole time i sat there.

The two of us each tried a bento box - Shrimp Tempura/Sushi and fried pork, which each came with rice, california roll, miso soup, salad and veg tempura.  The quantity was generous - its not the kind of sushi where you leave hungry!  I would say the quality was just average.  California rolls were good, miso was watery.  The tempura was crisp, but the shrimp did not have a fresh flavor.  The pork was ok, but the tomkatsu sauce was overly sweet and cinnamon-y (a very strange flavor for tomkatsu).  The atmosphere was fancier than we expected, and the staff were nice and soft spoken, if not always readily attentive.  About half the tables were full, and based on other reviews, I would say this put them in a \\"crunch\\" - it took about 20 minutes for our food to come.\\n\\nI would recommend it as a decent sushi or lunch option in the area.  Southwest Austin is a little devoid of choice, so I welcome Yanagi's addition.  Other tables near us ordered rolls and sashimi, which looked very tempting.

Now I wish I would have asked for a refund or a new item on the menu because the salad was honestly worth no more than $5. Also, when I opened my silverware to start eating, the fork and knife were stuck to the napkin by this sticky glue-like substance/food. Were these never cleaned? Regardless, I had to get new silverware. I would NOT recommend going to this location. Their ingredients are terrible and LOW quality.

I can't really complain about the food. It was good, but not great. Didn't hate it but would never go back. I see Lambert's as the kind of place that the convention goers and business people go when they really can't get to a better BBQ joint or are not willing to stand in 100 degree heat for over an hour to maybe get BBQ before they run out at the other better places in town. (What is up with Austin restaurants? Do they have something against indoor eating? I'm not about to sit outside in 100 degree heat and eat a meal. I'm not an animal.) That was our predicament. We really, really wanted to eat at the other spots but absolutely not willing to wait.

Second, my partner got 4 measly ribs for the same price we can get a half rack at home. Same with the brisket. Four very small thin (not thickness) pieces had a very tasty bark but was so dry and chewy it was like eating beef jerky. Then there was two moist, almost pot roast like pieces. Completely inconsistent.

They brought out the wrong appetizers (again I was the only one here) and my chai was brought out hot. The menu doesnt say hot or iced but I have always received iced in other Indian restaurants. When it was finally brought out as iced, the server stated it was without sugar, as if he decided himself if I should have sugar or not. \\n\\nThe samosa was really spicy hot, the pakora was tasty but the bread was gritty as if it had dirt on it.

He grabbed a menu and flipped through one page and said nope, everything has sugar. I asked him to then ask the chef. He was gone literally a minute before he came back and said no we don't.

So when I went today for a short christmas day trip to Boston, I had to try and get some Dim Sum. Over all this was a fantastic place, and honestly if I wasn't spoiled I may have rating it Higher, I am going to start with the Positives and then head on over to the negatives. We chose to come here over the other Dim Sum restaurants on this street because of the people we saw eating here, Mostly asian people, and the smells coming out of the door, Follow your nose people, it usually never leads you astray!! \\n\\nOn the Positive side, \\nAll the food I had was warm/hot and fresh. I was impressed with the food quality, The building was nice on the inside, it looks like they took the time to make the place look amazing. getting a table was a little hectic, but it was just two of us, and they are more set up for large groups, and we did come a little later than typical Dim Sum start time, so I didn't mind the wait. The Hostess was amazing, she made sure we knew how Dim Sum worked, and even went as far as to break the pricing down on our tally sheet for us so we could keep track of our spending. The Carts were stocked with various delights, although we did see some carts that didn't seem to come to our area, then again we didn't sit and wait for too long, we could have just been too impatient, and missed their rotation through. For the two of us we spent about 30 bucks before tips, which is a good price for decent Dim Sum. \\n\\nOn the negative, \\nThe only dish we tried, that I wasn't particularly impressed with was the Pork buns, They had almost a sugar glaze on them, instead of just the bun being sweet, so the sugar almost overwhelmed the savory of the pork. The ladies who were pushing the carts did not speak english very well, and what little they did speak was quiet and difficult to understand, but they were more than happy to open up a dish so you could see what they were trying to ask you about, which also meant you got a good sniff of the food, so even if you didn't know what it was, you could make a good guess as to if you wanted it. The wait between some of the carts was longer, which was kind of annoying, but it gave you time to sit and chat, and make sure you really needed that extra plate of goodies! It is very easy with the carts, to take everything!! Don't they will circle back, and if you get a plate of everything in the first shot, you will have to much food!!!\\n\\nOver all this was a great experience, and I would come back, I might even bring people to try Dim Sum here, there is no comparison to out west, although Im sure even that is nothing in comparison to what Dim Sum in China would actually be. I haven't tried many other places here in Boston, but this is the one to beat!!"},{"name":"Mike's Pastry","address":"300 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"When I moved to the North End all these people made a big fuss about how locals don't go to Mike's Pastry and blah blah blah.

However, service was absolutely terrible. The waitress who served us barely spoke to us other than \\"what are you guys having today?\\" Also, me and my wife shared a cup of coffee. Sometime we share and sometimes we order separately but we felt like sharing one that day. This waitress comes up to us and says in an accusing tone, \\"Are you guys sharing??!?\\" I honestly answered, \\"yes.\\" She turns around, brings us another cup of coffee and just drops it in front of my wife. It would have been nice if she told us that was against the restaurant's policy or something. She said nothing. We later found out she charged us for 2 cups of coffee. I have never had this sort of experience for past 30 years of my life. A cup of coffee is $3.00 I don't have problem with paying $3.00 when I'm paying $10 for french toast.

I personally like to sit outside so that I can scoff as passersby as they stroll down Pennsylvania avenue, for I have a mimosa and they have nothing but the tattered rags which cling to their emaciated frames. Begone with ye, urchin! \\n\\nI really like their club sandwich. I know that it's odd to hold a club sandwich in such high regard, but their club sandwich is unusually delicious. \\n\\nTheir pancakes also rule. They are big, fluffy, and delicious, much like my main bitch's ass. Much like that ass, these p-cakes are sure to satisfy. \\n\\nI'm also a big fan of the country benny, which is like eggs benedict but with sausage gravy. Fifty years from now, few will know what an eggs benedict is.

Well, at Greenbeat, you know exactly what goes in your salad and you can make it as healthy as you want. All ingredients were fresh and delicious. I ordered a customized salad, with the base of arugula and kale, topped with mushrooms, beets, artichokes, red onions and shrimp ceviche, dressed with ovoo, and sprinkled with salt, pepper and red pepper flakes. The main things that keep me away from eating salad are how non-spicy some salads are, and how most dressings are cream based (not my favorite!). I am so glad that at Greenbeat, I was able to make my salad spicy and dress it with lighter dressings. I am also happy that they have a variety of different vegetables for the base of the salad, instead of the boring romaine lettuce. They have so many different varieties of veggies, toppings and dressings that I think I could have a different salad everyday for at least two weeks. In my opinion, having options is always a great thing!\\n\\nI also got a fountain drink with my salad and and my total came out to $14. I know it is pricey for a salad, but I think it is worthy considering the quality and available options. \\n\\nThe staff here was very nice and welcoming despite how busy this place was for lunch time. \\n\\nOverall, I loved this place.

Every time I pass by, for some reason it's not meal time. Or, I've come from the Clintonville Farmers Market and I don't have time to get some pulled pork because we need to get the ground bison in the freezer.\\n\\nBut today, after a crappy day at work, I said, I'm going to put on my shoes and walk over to Ray Ray's. There were about 5 people ahead of me in line but it took a good 15 minutes until I was waited on. Yet, the 15 minutes flew as the two cooks were chatting it up with the customers, making funny jokes and asking if we were frequenters or virgins. Well tonight, Ray Ray, you have taken my food cart BBQ V-card.\\n\\nI ordered the pulled pork sandwich (of course, because I ADORE pulled pork and had yet to find excellent pulled pork in Columbus), the slaw, and the beans. $7. I mean, how awesome is that?! The walk home to my apartment was one of the longest five minutes of my life, as I could smell the sweet thick BBQ sauce creep into my nostrils.\\n\\nI got home and opened it up quick, and took a big bite out of the Pulled Pork. It. Is. Pure. Wonderful. Sauce went flying, my hands were covered, and I was in bar-be-heaven. Then I opened up the beans, which were in the same sauce. Other worldly.\\n\\nMy only disappointment was the cole slaw. The slaw was very cold and pretty bland. I have high demands for slaw though, as I prefer a a creamy, semi-sweet cole slaw. But nevertheless it was still GOOD slaw, it was just about as tasty as cole slaw from Cane's. I was just expecting with the godly pulled pork and beans that this would follow suit. \\n\\nAs I took my final bite of the pulled pork, my green self did not care that the carry out box and the cups that once held beans and slaw were a non-recyclable styrofoam. I did not care that my hands reeked of BBQ sauce (I am still putting my fingers near my nose to smell it at the end of every paragraph). It was just that good.\\n\\nAs much as I wish Ray Ray's had a full restaurant and big staff, and as much as I wish they were open more than four days a week, I feel like it would ruin the fun and atmosphere of it all.

I read a review that stated \\"there's one person running the show.\\" I'm sure the loyal customers don't mind waiting. Most customers were meeting people who arrived. (They didn't seem in a hurry.) The lack of behind the counter played a role in why I gave the location 3 stars and not 4. It took about 8 minutes before my order was received. It took about 15 minutes to to receive my order. The two breakfast burritos I receive were great. Great taste, great presentation, and great combination of breakfast items wrapped in a nice soft tortilla. The only issue I had. The burritos were below luke warm. I wasn't expecting hot off the grill, but I also didn't expect my kiddo to chomp into it with no problem. Most food we buy when we sit down to eat needs to cool before we serve it to our child or before we dig in.

The service is fairly attentive and friendly.  The food is relatively quickly prepared, and typically seasoned accurately.  I would say there's some lacking in regards to presentation, but it's the dealer's choice whether or not you ding points in regards to that topic, because, unless you've ever been slammed with 30 tickets hanging and a line out the door, sometimes presentation takes a little bit of a beating.\\n\\nI suppose my biggest gripe about Mother's (and it's not really a gripe, overall I enjoy everything) is that wait times and places to wait can be quite difficult to overcome.

My favorites are probably either the mini corner booths (so teeny tiny!) or the 'hidden' room that's sorta-upstairs-in-the-back.  It's like a hideout and it's wicked.  The staff was so warm and kind, and their food selection seemed pretty tops; everything from salads to wonky cookies (pretty big with heaps of interesting ingredients like fruity pebbles!), sandwiches etc.  What's so neat about the menu versatility is that you can pretty much accommodate for everybody's dietary needs (or, you know, just kick it with some espresso like I usually do).\\n\\nI found out that they also have heaps of events here; live music and whatnot, so I'll definitely be coming back during one of those posted events to see what that's all about.

Never mind that. Anyway!\\n\\nCambridge Common serves a purpose. I've been going here for years. I can't stop.....even if I wanted to.

And if you need a place that offers a guarantee of a table and a meal that won't poison you, this is the spot.  \\n\\nAnd Two - If it's after 10PM on a weekday or 11PM on a weekend and you realized you've been busy all day and forgot to plan anything for dinner and your tired and you could use a drink, this is the spot.\\n\\nPros: \\nThe drinks are poured pretty strong, especially if you are a familiar face to the bartender.\\nThe manager is really nice and tries to make people happy.\\nIt's one of those places where you can either hide-in-the-crowd and enjoy your anonymous dining and drinking experience with a book or a laptop OR you can get comfy at the bar and look around for some friendly faces --customers and servers alike-- and have a nice chatty burger and brew . And the beer selection, in case no one else has mentioned this (wink wink) is GREAT. \\n\\nOh yeah, and it's a good place for groups. If all the cons listed below are ok with you.\\n\\nCons: \\nIt's hit  or miss with the waitstaff being super informed about the beer selection.

I am not a HUGE beer drinker, so when I want to try something new I like to make a good choice.\\nThe food is sooooo average. Nothing stands out. I really wish they would do something about the bread they use to put their burgers on. It's always dry and unbelievably boring. The rest of the things I've had there have never risen above adequate and decent. I really don't go there for the food, as I mentioned earlier. I go because anywhere else i want to go is already closed or because I need a place I can count on for  no-wait dining.\\n\\nI go to Cambridge Common because it's there. Maybe that is a sad fact. Maybe there should be a better option. But there isn't right now. For what they do, they do it with effort and pride. I think that counts for something.

There are no prices on the bags of bread, but you will pay less than at a store.  There is a price list on the counter, if you have to know.\\n\\nThe selection isn't huge.  I usually get bags of sub rolls (they have 2 different sizes of white and wheat), loaf of bread (choice of almost any kind), and bagels (choice of plain, sesame, cinnamon raisin, wheat).

They did however have plenty of waffles and French toast (at 5pm, on Thanksgiving).

It's a steam punk themed place, with lots of touristy things at their gift shop area to buy, usually Wonka themed candy. The wait times are usually ridiculous, so reserve ahead, or plan what you want to do beforehand. Time will be wasted if you're on a limited amount. Even though it's a candy themed place, there's more of an adult vibe indoors. The muted colors, and the dark copper and brass remind you of the Tim Burton version of the chocolate factory. What they are known for are the extremely large sundaes and shakes. They're about 12-16$ per order, and diabetes in a mason cup. Be prepared for a sugar rush, and to share with at least 4 other people. I couldn't get past two spoons after eating around other candy from the park, and a slushy. The place really is beautiful at night. There's also dining outside, where you can overlook CityWalk, and see the NBC screen and whatever Olympics rerun/sports ad they show. The lake is also right in front of the store, and it's adjecent to the IOA entrance. This is a place you'd go for date night, and enjoy the atmosphere. Some of it is overpriced, but it's at a theme park, and you're paying for the gorgeous building with the subtle desgins, and the chimney with white smoke chugging out all picturesque against the night sky.

We picked this place because it was 'central' to the 3 parties meeting up. (Cambridge, Concord, and Babson). \\n\\nThe evening started off with a few hiccups... We arrived first, 15 minutes before our reservation and decided to check in:  no reservation found. So, we called Mom who informed us that she did make the reservation and spoke to a woman who took it. She distinctly remembers since she mentioned that it was a birthday and would prefer a 'quiet' table for 5. No reservation found. That being said the Manager said he would try to find us a place. \\n\\nThey did accommodate us, however the Manager did write it off as 'whomever took the reservation must not know how to use the system'. Concerning, but they accommodated our party.\\n\\nFirst glance at the menu... wine list: Abysmal. For a place that is supposed to be 'Tuscan', the wine list is shamefully short. The Montepulciano was ok, not nearly as tanniny as I would have hoped. We asked the waitress for a suggestion for a good full bodied yet very dry red... she didn't seem to know wine very well, and mostly just followed our lead/speculation that the closest thing they had was a Cab. The Cab was actually sweet, and not dry at all... strike 1. \\n\\nOnto the food. The bread was shockingly oily. The entrees we had included the pappardelle w/ duck ragu, braised shortrib, the veal, and the scallops. The pappardelle was served on a very hot plate, but the food itself was barely warm, the shortrib was tasty, however the big failure was the scallops. The scallops came with a very bland puree of white bean, that clearly had been sitting under a heat lamp as they dried out and had a slight crust on them. Further, the person who had the scallops also ordered a side dish that never came out until we asked for it, and also arrived cold. Strike 2. \\n\\nDessert: we ordered gellato. Which, unless I'm mistaken is Milk, not cream. The gellato came and was much more of an ice cream consistancy, and had ice crystals throughout the scoops. That usually means it was melted and refrozen. I'm guessing they scoop them out beforehand, and freeze scooped. Good for restaurant efficiency - bad for texture and flavor. On top of that we had 3 people order gellato and only 2 arrived. We asked for the 3rd, and we got it.... 15 minutes later. \\n\\nWe had to argue to get the side dish that arrived late and cold removed from the bill, which they did begrudgingly. \\n\\n1 Star for food and wine. 2 Stars for service since they did try to accommodate. \\n\\nI won't be back."},{"name":"Bia Bistro","address":"35 S Main St","city":"Cohasset","stars":"4","text":"we dined on a Saturday night.

That meal could've easily been great with actual blackened fish, rice and beans and saut√©ed greens as a side. No effort was put into that meal. Like, who makes only cornbread a side for a meal with fish?? The salad was iceberg, cut up tomatoes and cucumber.

My children were very much looking forward to meeting the characters in the story. We had 3 kids and were seated in the back and we asked our waiter to please send Jacque our way when he did his rounds since we seemed to be out of site. So Jacque came to our floor but after several requests he never came to our table. This was part of the whole restaurant experience for the kids and that was disappointing. Determined to get at least one minute or pic with the character after dinner and payment we asked the floor manager if he was around. She checked and said he was on break and said it's not a character dining so there is no guarantee to see them or be greeted by them and that if we wanted to stick around 30 mins he will probably be back.

I ordered country french toast which is supposed to be \\"stuffed\\" with ham and cheese, but what I received I would describe it as 4 big pieces of deep fried bread, a little cheese, and one bite of ham, chopped up and split between two sandwiches.  I was there on a windy, cool evening and sat outside.  Putting the flaps down around the patio would have made dining pleasant, however we overheard a staff member telling another table that complained that are not allowed to put them down unless the temperature was lower, so we just had to suck it up while the wind made the outdoor heaters useless.  The last item is that, although they do ask about allergies up front, the solution to their vast sundae selection for L.I. people is to provide one flavor of non-dairy ice cream.  When asked if I could order a sundae with this ice cream switched out, the answer was unclear.  I recommend they feature delicious nut milk ice cream that anyone would want to order.

So here is my advice to you on when to eat there, since they do not take reservations, go at lunchtime.  This is the best time to go that guarantees you no wait time.  We went at 2pm on a Friday afternoon and there were plenty of open seats.  There is outdoor seating as well as seating on the first floor and the second floor.  We were seated on the second floor which was a circular setting with an open middle. The walls around the entire floor were videos that looked like you were in an actual chocolate factory showing chocolate pouring and being made and it looked extremely lifelike. Penelope Tibeaux-Tinker Toothsome (the creator of the restaurant if you read the story in the menu) also walks around the restaurant greeting guests and talking about her love of chocolate. \\n\\nWe started off with the Warm Chocolate Almond Bread with salted caramel butter.  It was delicious. It did kind of taste more like a dessert than a bread before a meal but I would for sure order it again.  Eating chocolate bread was for sure a different experience. There were a few other fun appetizers that have chocolate in them that I would love to try if we stopped back. \\n\\nFor lunch we got the four cheese flat bread (added chicken) and Another Caesar Salad with chicken.  I enjoyed the Caesar salad, the croutons were homemade and delicious.  The chicken was flavorful and juicy.  It's the perfect meal for when you're saving room for dessert and you are spending the day walking around the park.  The Cheese Flatbread with Chicken was good, a bit too cheesy and not a fan of the clumps of ricotta cheese on it, would probably not order this again. \\n\\nFor dessert we got the Peanut Indulgence Milkshake and Flourless Chocolate Cake with nutella ice cream.  The Peanut Indulgence Milkshake was good, it wasn't as extravagant as some of the other milkshakes but peanut butter is always a good choice.  The milkshake was good, I found it extremely thick and hard to drink through the straw and I had to start using a spoon.  The Flourless Chocolate Cake with Nutella Ice cream was delicious.  The cake was warm and moist.  I tend to like my flourless chocolate cake not as gooey and more put together but this was also good.  The Nutella ice cream was fantastic.  I would order the flourless chocolate cake again, but perhaps try a different milkshake. \\n\\nOverall the experience was great at this place.  The service was a tad slow at some points.  It took almost 15 minutes for our waitress to get us coffee.  I think some of this has to do with us being on the 2nd floor and I think the servers have to do a lot of running between the floors which can take some time.  We also asked for a 2nd straw for the milkshake and it took her almost 10 minutes to come back with that.  \\n\\nI recommend going, however avoid going during dinner or when the parks are closing otherwise you could be waiting awhile."},{"name":"Mike's Pastry","address":"300 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Extremely over rated bulk produced low quality stuff.

I went again today, and found out they've completely redone their menu, much for the worse. Not only that, but the service was terrible. Let's start with the food.\\n\\nFirst I ordered a \\"peach tea\\" that was listed on the menu along with raspberry tea and iced tea. I was huffily told that the place only had sweetened and unsweetened iced tea. I don't think the waitress even realized the restaurant offered peach and raspberry tea. I got milk instead.\\n\\nI usually get a smoked salmon omelette that is delicious, but that was not available on their new menu which got rid of a lot of old favorites (like the brie cheese plate). Today I got a \\"Blackstone Benny\\" with poached egg, bacon, and tomato on an English muffin. The muffin was soggy, and there was something giving off an odd sour flavor that was not the tomatoes. The bacon was neither crispy or soggy, but a stale texture. The overall serving was half of what their platters used to be, and the pricing is about the same. They used to include a side of potatoes or toast or something with almost every item, but apparently not anymore. I thought it was a joke when they brought out my \\"blackstone benny\\" in the round plates they used to use and half of it was empty. My lunch companions similarly thought the potatoes or toast would be coming out as a side later but that never happened.\\n\\nOur waitress was this impatient lady who 1) doesn't know the menu, and 2) has zero charisma, and 3) is apparently dumb. Besides the fact that she didn't know the menu, she took forever to write down each person's order, and did not give us silverware. We had to ask the guy who brought out our food to get it for us.\\n\\nBeing UT college kids eating here, we used \\"Bevo Bucks,\\" a school form of cash recently added to Broken Egg as an acceptable form of payment. I understand that when using this, SOME restaurants ask that you write down the tip amount before they take the card to swipe. This waitress took our cards to swipe, before coming back and rudely telling us that we did not do this. Not only that, but either a co worker or manager came along to tell us that next time we go to any restaurant that accepts Bevo Bucks we HAVE to write the tip amount before they swipe. This is NOT TRUE. Most stores are capable of swiping Bevo Bucks just like credit cards. Only a few ask that you write it down first, and they usually just bring it back with a pen and ask you to write it. This lady was downright rude, and literally could not comprehend when we told her we would write it down so she could reswipe. She for whatever reason wanted us to verbally tell her. I also don't appreciate her coworker or manager telling us something about Bevo Bucks he clearly does not know about. This restaurant just started accepting it, and everyone at my table had been using them for three years.\\n\\nEven after telling us we needed to write down the tip, the waitress did not give us a pen, and when she came back with my friend's credit card receipts to sign, she didn't give him a pen either. Then she acted rude when she realized we had yet to sign them.\\n\\nI'm crossing Another Broken Egg Cafe off of my list of tasty and good value restaurants. It used to rank higher than Kerbey Lane and about the same level as 24 Diner and Blue Dahlia in my book, but I guess I will be going to Kerbey Lane more when I want brunch/diner food near campus."},{"name":"Zaftigs Delicatessen - Brookline","address":"335 Harvard St","city":"Brookline","stars":"4","text":"Post call breakfasts are the best!

Toothsome looked so inviting all the way from across the water.  Lots of indoor/outdoor seating (covered). Florida heat can be oppressive.  No reservations but we only waited 20 mins for a table as it was Sunday evening, two hours before the parks closed. It was packed by the time we were done.  The waiting area has super cool steampunk decor and costumes (some items were for sale).  The best part was all of the chocolate treats and fancy desserts on display.  It's deceiving how big the dining area is. The lower level was a little dark but the second level was lined with windows facing the opposite side of Citywalk with tons of natural light.  The upstairs bar had a great view too! We took the glass elevator up. It smells like warm chocolate. So worth the 5 second ride.  The menu had a lot of great options depending on your hunger level or budget.  They serve breakfast all day so I was hooked! I ordered the waffle with lemon curd, fresh berries and whipped cream ($8.99).  I don't see the point in ever ordering anything else! My daughter ordered a similar meal except it was French toast with the same toppings. She liked it, not loved it. The bread tasted deep fried more like a donut and she was a little overwhelmed by that.  My son ordered the French Onion soup and said it was very, very good. He ordered a bowl and finished off her donut toast.  My husband ordered the Fork & Knife Ribeye sandwich.  He said it was very good, however the rib eye was pounded super thin. But good flavor nonetheless. He opted for the homemade chips instead of fries and we all liked those.  Our bill was considerably modest given we skipped the dessert menu and alcohol.

It was basically an egg and cheese omelette with a little bit of corned beef hash mixed into the egg before it was cooked. Call me a breakfast purest, but I was expecting the omelette to be filled will corned beef hash and cheese. At no point while eating the omelette did I taste the corned beef hash. On a positive note, the home fries were better than average and the coffee was very good. My GF got the Fried Egg B.L.T.

Dalina is a small little grocery shop that sells fun, healthy products, plus a cafe serving up delicious, healthy treats. It's located in the heart of Chinatown, on the corner of Main and E. Georgia. So compared to a lot of the other shops and restaurants in the area, Dalina stands out as a bit more of a cleaner, hipster spot. \\n\\nWhen you walk in you're met with the cafe side first. I ordered myself a london fog, a small breakfast veggie frittata, and a bowl of the maple glazed sweet potatoes w/ lentils and pomegranates. I took a number and they said they'd deliver it to my table when everything was ready. \\n\\nTowards the back is the small market/shop. A small selection, but nonetheless fun and unique. There were quite a few seating options - a communal table towards the cafe and plenty of tables along the window. Along the grocery side, there are a few other smaller tables and window seating. My favourite part though? Their covered, heated patio. It was a cold, rainy day, but I opted to sit out here since it was empty and quiet. What a blessing in disguise! It was so cute and cozy out there. It felt like a little hidden oasis amidst the busy and rainy Main St. \\n\\nMy food and drink came out quickly after I'd settled in. I was a big fan of the breakfast veggie frittata. For one small piece, it was very filling and tasty. Maybe it's because it had sweet potatoes in it. I'm not sure, but it was great. Speaking of sweet potatoes, my little bowl of those orange tots were SO good. The lentils and pomegranates were a surprising, yummy touch. I think I'm going to start adding pomegranates to a lot of my other salads from here on out. Dalina, you inspired me! \\n\\nThis spot also serves cocktails, so if you're looking for a mid-day adult pick me up, this isn't a bad spot to come to.

After 45 minutes a different server than the one we had, came out and said our waitress lost our order. He was going to take our order again and rush it through. At this point, we're starving but okay, mistakes can happen.  After 20 minutes and still no food, I ask the server what's going on since I see many other people getting their salads and they arrived much later than us.  Keep in mind, most of the people who were there when we arrived were already gone.  Seriously, three salads should not take that long. He said something about everyone wanting the gyro meat.  Not sure why that would matter since our 2nd order should have jumped ahead of everyone else at that point.  Five minutes later our salads come out.  After asking for the check, we thought perhaps one of our meals would be comped or dessert offered but nothing. Not even a 'sorry for the problem' from our original waitress who did give us the bill.  The only excuse I can find for no offering of a comp in some form is that management had no idea and the wait staff was covering for one another.

We wandered the Saturday market and then wandered back. It was 1:26 when we got the text saying to check in, so we went inside within two minutes of receiving the text and checked in. We were told to have a seat on the bench and we would be seated in a few minutes. 30 minutes go by before I went back up to the counter and asked if we had been skipped.

However, I am also a foodie and am extremely critical of restaurants.  Latin Flare is a breath of fresh air to the Avalon community.  After multiple visits to this new restaurant I'll share my thoughts in 3 categories.\\n\\nService - Top notch.  I've been to many soft openings for restaurants and not one that I've attended has gone as smooth as this one.  Every employee made me feel welcomed and that they cared about my dining experience.  They were courteous and attentive without being fake or overbearing, which I feel is a problem with a lot of servers in the restaurant industry.  On my multiple visits the service has not dipped in the least.  Grade A+ for service.\\n\\nFlavor - Great flavors and diverse food.  The food here is not pigeon holed into a single type.  They have foods from all sorts of latin cultures and they execute all of them very well.  I've had their pernil (roast pork), arroz y gondules (yellow rice and pigeon peas), frijoles negros (black beans), pollo guisado (stewed chicken), and so many other items off of their menu and they were all flavorful and fresh.  The two items that stick out to me the most are the tostones and the mofongo.  The tostones are always hot, crisp, and fresh and have a nice hint of garlic.  The real winner though is the mofongo relleno with chicken.   It is one of the best mofongos I've ever had.  It is right on par with ones I've had in Puerto Rico.  It was flavorful, seasoned properly, and very juicy.  And the portion is massive for only $9.  I eat a lot and had to take half of it home.  It was delicious and I highly recommend it.  And last but not least, their Sangria is so good.  Just the right amount of sweetness and the perfect amount of kick.  Grade A+ for flavor.\\n\\nValue - Almost everything on this menu is less than $10.  The portions are more than enough and you certainly won't go hungry.  I don't think you can get a better deal for great tasting food and great service for such a low price.  Grade A+ for value.\\n\\nOverall if you live in the Avalon Park community it's most definitely worth a try, and even if you live outside the bubble, it's a place worth traveling in for."},{"name":"Mike's Pastry","address":"300 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Delicious cannoli, but only taking cash?

Unfortunately, our first experience with this place yesterday left a lot to be desired. Wait staff was very friendly and helpful, but the meals we were served were subpar. Neither can one know what to expect from the restaurant website's online menu, as the real menu has changed in both content as well as prices -- the latter being higher than those listed on the site, of course.\\n\\nFor our lunch we ordered the Club Steak and the Western Filly menu items. The Club Steak has been changed from a grilled 6 oz. sirloin to a sirloin marinated in pineapple and teriyaki sauce. The first problem with this item was that it was severely undercooked, being completely raw and cold inside and merely seared on the outside despite it having been ordered on the medium side of rare. The second problem, which could not be overcome by the recooking of the steak, was the horrible teriyaki sauce that completely obliterated any taste of beef. Even though our server had indicated that everything in the restaurant was made from scratch, this terribly salty and bitter sauce reminded me strongly of Lawry's bottled teriyaki sauce, which any teriyaki fan knows is not worth buying. After lunch it took several hours to get that horrible flavor out of my mouth.\\n\\nThe other lunch item ordered was the Western Filly, Santa Fe Cattle Company's version of Philly cheese steak. While the flavor was fairly good, this was a drippy greasy mess to tackle, apparently due to the fact that the slices of steak seem to be grilled in an overabundance of oil before being smothered with Jack cheese.\\n\\nGiven the fact there are as yet few restaurants of the non-fast food variety in this area, we may try Santa Fe Cattle Co. again, making different choices from the menu next time. The decor and atmosphere of the place is kitschy and pleasant enough, though a bit on the noisy side for our tastes even though there were few other diners in sight when we went. And the server we had promised that anyone who doesn't care for \\"seasoned\\" and \\"marinated\\" steaks and other dishes can always ask for them to be prepared \\"plain.\\" And, who knows, with a bit more experience the kitchen staff may even learn how to cook a steak. \\n\\nOn an interesting note, this is the first Santa Fe Cattle Co. restaurant to open in Florida. The Cagan Crossings area seems an odd choice, considering that it is off the beaten track of Orlando, Tampa and even Disney World. Even so, we are glad they are here if only to add to the variety of dining choices in the area. And we hope they can rise above the mediocrity that seems to prevail in a place that usually doesn't try too hard to please the mostly transient (tourists and snow birds) clientele.

While there is nothing to really complain about there's also nothing to write home about as it relates to the food or drink. It is your standard TexMex fare which can be found for less time, less money and more authenticity at other locations around the metro area.\\n\\nATMOSPHERE\\n\\nAs with most Ford Fry joints, the atmosphere is great. The attention to design and detail is apparent the moment you walk into the restaurant. This is easily the busiest restaurant in Krog Street Market. It is clear why they don't take reservations - they don't have to! The amount of foot traffic the restaurant has access to AND the fact that many people make this their dining destination - once people arrive, they aren't apt to leave, so basically you have a captive audience. Relatively brilliant and it will be interesting to see as the restaurant ages if they will be able to maintain this level of interest and fervor.\\n\\nBEVERAGE\\n\\nWhile I did say I had nothing to complain about - this is where I will actually lodge an official complaint. I rescind my comment in the 'short version' above. I may be wrong, but I feel that drinks from the bar are one of the primary money makers for a restaurant. There was an EXTREME disconnect between bar service and our actual server. It took upwards of fifteen minutes to get a glass of wine for my dining partner while my margarita, that was hand crafted, came much faster. The second margarita that I ordered before our dinner came out from the kitchen didn't arrive until we were actually finishing dinner. Upon the drink's arrival, our server immediately informed me that she had taken this off the bill. This was a very kind gesture on behalf of the restaurant, but I feel like this is an issue they need to resolve and ASAP.\\n\\nPrior to being seated I had 'The O.G.' margarita which, to me, read as the simplest version without added sugar. The more tart my margarita, the better it is in my opinion. When I took my first sip, it was cloyingly sweet. Once seated, I asked our server if she could recommend something similar to 'The O.G.', but that isn't sweet. She said, do you want 'The O.G.' without sugar?\\n\\nI've copied and pasted from the menu below the description between 'The O.G.' and their house margarita:\\n\\nMARGARITA DE LA CASA\\n\\nEl Jimador Reposado, triple sec, fresh lime,\\n sugar, frothed and slushy 8\\n\\nTHE O.G.\\n\\nEl Jimador Reposado, triple sec, fresh lime,\\n short and strong or on the rocks 8\\n\\nNote that sugar is an added ingredient in the House Margarita, but NOT 'The O.G.'. What gives?\\n\\nFOOD\\n\\nWe started with the queso fundido (add chorizo, ignore the layer of floating fat at the bottom of the baking dish) - it was quite good. For some reason the manager sent out guacamole to our table, which was also very tasty. We split the mixed fajitas which was MORE than enough for two - the entrees that we saw were VERY large coming from the kitchen. When I die and am called home to Glory, I hope that I can be basted in the Mexican Butter that comes with the fajitas. Not sure what was in it (guessing possibly crack), but it was pretty insane on the fajitas.

Sits down to eat it and learns that she prefers them prefilled, as it allows for the shell to soften. She's not a fan of the crispy. So she cracks that bitch open and licks out  the filling. Pleased by the moderate level of sweetness but disgusted by the lumps of actual ricotta in the mix. She is well aware that the filling is made of ricotta, but she's had many cannolis and has never had lumps of ricotta. She may have caught them on a bad day when the cannoli mix stirrer was tired.

The place is at the corner of a busy street so make sure you know where it is as it's a quick turn into the alleyway for parking.

This dip was overwhelmed by the spinach, which I guess wasn't a bad thing from a \\"healthy eating\\" perspective but who eats that dip and expects it not to be unhealth-ly satisfying? lol The rolls that I ordered (Vegetarian & Atlantic) were okay....nothing amazing to report. I didn't get to try my friend's potstickers but I tasted her Philly roll (she's slightly new to sushi, so she doesn't know what tastes bad and what doesn't) and the salmon that came with the roll was surprisingly salty.....in fact, it tasted more like the lox salmon you'd have on a bagel with cream cheese for breakfast (YUM). I've had Philly rolls before and this was definitely the worst out of all of them. \\n\\nIn the end, we waited another 20min for our check. \\n\\nIf we do come back, we might order the CheeseBurger Sliders because from a distance they looked pretty good. \\n\\nSIDE NOTE: while this has nothing to do with the restaurant, our waitress had really really BAD B.O. :-( I'm not sure if this was a result of her working all day and being exposed to all the food in the kitchen but it was definitely unpleasant."},{"name":"Strip","address":"245 18th St","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"I live in Atlantic Station and avoid dining at Strip due the consistent lack of service I receive on every occasion.  With prices to rival a fine dining establishment you would think their service would match, but that is the complete opposite. My sister was craving sushi, which is actually very good at Strip, so we stopped through to grab a bite.  I ordered a glass of Malbec at the bar and found a piece of glass in my mouth that I fortunately didn't swallow.  I alerted the bartender who also discovered that she may have chipped the glass while pouring the wine.  As a businessman I have the luxury of eating out at fine dining establishments on a regular and expect a certain level of service as a patron.  When I received my check I realized I was still being charged for the wine. I was given attitude by the female bartender because she felt as though the new glass she poured for me was a resolution to the situation.  In other situations at restaurants, similar in stature to what Strip claims to be, would have not only comp'd the glass of wine without question, but would've gone above and beyond to ensure the satisfaction of their guests.  This is clearly not the way Strip views customer service.  I had to ask for the manager because the female bartender claimed her hands were tied on this issue.  The manager greets me in the most unprofessional way, as if we were on the street, with a \\"Whats up Yo\\".  He had obviously been informed, prior to, of what I was going to ask him about and quickly said he would comp the wine before walking off just as fast as he arrived.  Already offended, I felt even more bamboozled by their nonchalant attitude when attempting to appease the issue.  The price of the wine was not the issue here, it was the principle around customer service.  Everyone was very unprofessional and tried to make me feel as awkward as possible as if this was something that just happens, so I need to deal with it.  As I mentioned earlier, I have lived in Atlantic Station for 2 years now and can count on one hand the amount of times I have visited Strip for reasons similar to this.  However, this situation was the straw that broke the camel's back and prompted me to write this review.  They need to step their game up as a fine dining establishment because their service, speed, and professionalism are truly of fast food caliber."},{"name":"Treaty Oak Distilling","address":"16604 Fitzhugh Rd","city":"Dripping Springs","stars":"4.5","text":"Ok third visit but first time meeting the owners and workers.

Bringing my mom out.. we needed something that wasn't too far from the home and I was running out of options that my mom would be ok to eat with.... I guess cheap Japanese it is once more. Coming here is a drag, as the parking lot situation is a true joke. If you know the plaza, you know that there is a Staples here... and also that they have most of parking spots downstairs.. and if you are to park in these spots and eat at Sushi Garden... well that cheap Japanese food just went 'Tojo's' on you... without you digesting anything ($80 warning when you enter the restaurant!!!). So unless you are here after 8PM where the spots are free on the street.. make the effort and park upstairs in 'no-man's land' and walk down to the place.\\n\\nI dropped my mom off to get seats, and go find parking on the street, I came back.. and she was still waiting.... for service. I was very surprised, as this place is always packed... why is it.. I still did not understand... and this lack of service already made me feel a little fearful of what was to come. Eventually after I came in.. and someone finally noticing us at the doorway... we were seated. The place was full, as usual, and while watching other tables...and their orders come out.. I can say that either people have huge appetites... or their eyes are bigger than their stomachs... as it clearly looked like everyone here tonight was over ordering. This one table beside us.. 5 people, clearly ordered to feed a town as the whole time we were sitting down... I barely saw any food disappear magically off the table.\\n\\nLooking closely at other tables.. it was the same thing, massive amounts of food, some tables surprised me more that they actually were able to devour all that was put in front of them. Think Samurai Sushi... in terms of portion size... huge and cheap... bang for the buck... check, check.. check. If you want entertainment for the eyes.. come here, you will be surprised.\\n\\nI allowed my mom to decide on what we should have... and she does have a thing for California rolls... so we put that in, yam tempura roll, filet-o-fish roll (yes.. they had this... I had to see just for fun... fried fish and processed cheese!) potato croquette, and a dish of mentaiko udon. As or order was put in, I looked toward the sushi bar... and those sushi chefs looked like a sweatshop factory... as they kept on putting orders on plates... and then our 3 rolls arrived on one plate, nicely presented... and big. I think we were shocked at the size too and were already thinking of how much we could actually eat.\\n\\nEventually the last two cooked dishes came... nothing too special, the mentaiko udon wasn't bad, for everything we ordered, it came up to a little under $23. Would I come back... no, as I would rather go to Sushiholic.. which isn't too far from here. Asking my mom what she thought... value wise.. yes.. quaility and taste wise... the same. I actually felt heavy after eating this meal, and so did my mom. We did have to box up the cooked food... and it was handled quite quickly. Service.. was ok.. wasn't anything spectacular... it must be a comfort zone for many... 2.5 in my mind but I can see why people come here."},{"name":"Pip's Original Doughnuts & Chai","address":"4759 NE Fremont St, Ste C","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"If I'm in the Fremont area.

She was really trying though, and to give her credit I think she'll be great once she gets more experience. We actually ended up asking her how long she's been serving and she said 3 days but that the training was 2 months long & that they had to memorize the whole menu. To be honest, I'd think she'd know more about the menu after that long of a training process. For example, we asked details about the risotto dish and whether the chicken was diced or shredded and she said she honestly wasn't sure because it was \\"hidden under the cheese.\\" When I worked at a large chain restaurant, we were required to know every detail and were also presented/educated on each dish individually. She just wasn't confident and I can only assume that is a reflection of poor training. \\n\\nShe did tell us about Penelope and the Robot that would be walking around... But we never saw them in the hour and a half that we were there. Not her fault- but why are they training servers to talk about the characters that don't even show up?

We always get Italian birthday cake with peaches and have always loved our experience there.  Today,  I was asked to wait in the pastery line even though I pre-ordered my cake the previous week and was told to walk up to the counter to pick it up.  I waited in the notoriously long line and when I finally made it to the counter the women working there were having a conversation that they had me wait to finish.  One women finally went to look for my cake, came back after 5 minutes without a cake, and proceeded to speak wIth the other counter help about how I must have ordered the cake from their other establishment in Medford while I was standing there.  They didn't ask me,  but called over to the Medford store to find that I had not ordered it from them.  Then all 3 women went to look for the cake and couldn't find it.  One women came back after a few minutes to ask if I ordered it from Medford. I said no and they asked me to step back from the counter while they called the baker who would have made the cake that morning.  The baker didn't answer and one women told me their was nothing they could do, but they would call me when the baker called back.  I left to wait in my car.  After about 10 minutes one women called to say they didn't have my cake but did have another rum cake they could write on. Mine was supposed to have peaches, so she offered to put them on top for me and still write happy birthday.  She promised the cake in 10 minutes and told me to come back then. At this point I had been in the store or my car for 40 minutes and was late to the birthday party but I agreed.  After 10 minutes I went in. The cake was not ready.  I continued to wait nearly 20 more minutes.  The cake was brought up and was twice the size I had ordered.  The women generously offered not to charge me for the peaches, but the price she quoted was still $12 more than the cake I ordered would have cost. When I said I wasn't happy with the price she knocked it down $6 because I was ,\\"getting a bigger cake\\". I was now 70 minutes late and could not argue any further. As I left, one woman rudely shouted after me that she didn't \\"have time to argue with me either.\\"  I give the place 2 stars because the cake was still delicious and one woman behind the counter felt sorry for me when I was waiting for the last time and gave me a free cappuccino.

The meat, for being incredibly fatty tasting, was very dry. I guess they get credit for HAVING chicken tamale as an option, but I've since had much better at another food cart so I know greatness can be achieved. The beans and rice were the only tolerable thing on that plate, but even those were bad with an overwhelming lard taste. I should've thrown the whole thing out, but I was hungry. \\n\\nBut no, I walked over hoping that if I ordered a vegetarian burrito I'd find less odious flavors. No such luck. The zucchini burrito had all the spice I expected to find in the tamale, but it was totally misplaced. Also, the $7 price tag is not a welcome site. Usually meat-free options are LESS expensive.

They use fresh mushrooms in the mushrooms and peas vegetable dish which is impressive.  The Tofu and potatoes didn't have any potatoes, which i didn't mind ata all, and came in a pleasantly mild and creamy sauce.

I haven't tried most of the foods in the combo and they were all delicious.\\n\\nThe banana french toast was AMAZING. I'm a huuuuuuuuge french toast fan, pretty much order it every time I go to brunch, and I love the idea of bananas inside the toast. I'll admit, I've had french toast that was cooked to a little better quality - this french toast took a little more work to cut than I prefer (slightly over cooked? The tiniest tiniest bit rubbery, almost). Not that it wasn't delicious - I'm just being nit-picky and there isnt much else I can give negative feedback on.\\n\\nPOSTIVES:\\n- If you haven't tried blitzes, potato pancakes, knish, or kugel, get the Zaftig combo! Excellent dish, and I love trying new things.\\n- Memorable menu - banana stuffed french toast was awesome, and there were two other types of french toast.\\n\\nNEGATIVES:\\n- The flavors are really good, but I wouldn't say the dishes are quite cooked to perfection. I'm just playing devil's advocate here - gotta balance my positive points with something!

Service started out a bit rocky...like being in no mans land where we have waiters all around us but nobody helping us.  Once we resolved that issue, we started off with the rock shrimp.  It may have been the sun but they had a sheen...like they hadn't been fried enough or were a tad soggy like they soaked up too much oil.  Nonetheless, the shrimp were sweet not needing the side of ranch on the side.  Ranch and shrimp-only in TX.  We then shared the ribs along with Mac and Cheese.  The Mac n Cheese had a nice crust which I adore but tasted of processed cheese which I despise.  I can get Velveeta Shells n Cheese at any local grocery.  The ribs and slaw were tasty on their own..slightly above average...but it wasn't until I removed the meat from the bone, mixed 4-5 dashes of BBQ sauce, 3 dashes of hot sauce and then topped it with the slaw-that's when I got the perfect bite.  I hate mayo so the slaw was refreshing bc it wasn't the traditional mayo based slaw.  But it was the nuts in the slaw which really stood out at the end of that perfect bite.

My last visit here was about 5 years ago before the garages were erected and holy moly, what a difference. Parking was a breeze and as my husband said, he felt he pulled one over on the man or 'stole something' because we didn't pay for parking. And it was a breeze getting in and out as well.\\n\\nPer usually Disney, the place is immaculate from the garage, elevators all the way throughout the entirety of Disney Springs. This is such a great place to go if you are in Orlando with a wee little one and aren't planning on doing a full on Disney trip (parks everyday) and just want to stroll around a bit. We had our toddler in a stroller for the most part but took her out for some dancing to live music. It would have been great to bring the ergobaby carrier as well and walk with her in it. There are some 'rides', for older kids/adults, there's an air balloon that goes up very high over the water & there is also a cool looking 1950's era car with propellers that goes into the water like a boat. For little ones, there's a little carousel and train. The first two attractions are probably on the pricier side whereas the other two were $3 a token. \\n\\nThere are plenty of places to eat; however, a lot of the sit down restaurants are part of Disney meal plans so beware - walk in waits can be around 1.5 hours (that's what we were quoted by Rainforest Cafe around 6:30pm). There are plenty of walk up windows like a fancy assuage/hotdog place, an alternating food truck (we tried chicken and waffles but sad we missed the tacos), there's a Wolfgang Puck Express as well as a Morimoto Street Food among many others.

But the worst thing is there is no cell phone service. So my kids are worried because I am so late. We keep calling and texting each other but the cell phone reception doesn't work. They have to go to a restaurant land line to call me. If Disney is going to take so long to fix it up so in the long run traffic and parking will be better then in the meantime they should have Wi-Fi connection for people to get in touch with others who are stuck in traffic so they can connect to meet up.

So I give him a good tip and take my food upstairs... only to find out they GOT THE ORDER WRONG!  I don't eat meat, so I ordered a personal Athena (which is supposed to be all veggies and cheese, but found pieces of meat in it), while my husband is a meat lover and that's why he got the medium Meatball.  It was all wrong and backwards and I ended up giving him half my food.  I called up Southside Flying Pizza to inform them that the food did in fact arrive, but the order was completely wrong, so after a long discussion and the guy being really short with me on the phone, they offered either a refund or another pizza.

Frankly, the few times I've had sushi, I was pretty underwhelmed with the texture and taste.  Plus, I'm not a big fan of wolfing down a whole piece of sushi in one bite.  Therefore, I typically will find another type of food to eat when I'm traveling.  \\n\\nHowever, I can be swayed to try different things just for the experience.  Life's too short to have such a closed mind, methinks.\\n\\nSo the fellow I was working with suggested this place.  \\"Do they have anything besides sushi on the menu?\\" I asked.\\n\\n\\"Sure, a bunch of other stuff.\\" came his reply.  Satisfied that I wouldn't starve or complain, we launched from our nearby hotel.  \\n\\nWe arrived at 11:45am on a Saturday, only a little past when they opened.  The pretty young hostess asked us if we had a reservation.  I looked around at all the empty tables (just before the lunch rush, I guess) and semi-sarcastically said \\"No, but do you think you could squeeze us in?\\"  We were led to a nearby table with no drama.\\n\\nAll You Can Eat (AYCE) lunch runs until 2:15 or so this day.  And this includes the BBQ, one of those propane grills mounted in the middle of your table, which you use to prepare your chicken, beef, pork chops or spicy pork.  $16.95 CAN, plus all the hot tea you wish for.\\n\\nSure enough, the little white paper sheets that you use to place your order indeed had other things besides sushi.  Miso soup, gyoza, yakisoba, fried rice, teriyaki beef, chicken and tofu...I wasn't gonna starve.\\n\\nWe used the provided pencil to order a bunch of different things, BBQ spicy pork, chicken teriyaki, fried rice, gyoza and--for me to try--a California roll and a Salmon roll.  My coworker ordered some tuna rolls, salmon sashimi, spicy tuna cone and teriyaki salmon.  \\n\\nWithin a minute, it seemed, a bowl of the raw spicy pork was delivered to my table.  They fired up the BBQ and I got to work playing Iron Chef.  The BBQ was great at searing the thin slices of pork, eventually providing a nice carbonized print on each side of the slice.  Yummy.  Fun cooking, too, though a little smoke drifted into my face once or twice.  \\n\\nThe fried rice was interesting in that it had bits of cooked salmon in it--I've never had salmon in my fried rice before, but it was good.  The gyoza were tasty and fresh.  I ordered some yakisoba, which worked great with my 2nd helping of BBQ spicy pork.\\n\\nThe California roll and Salmon roll seemed pretty good, too.  Still more than a mouthful of food to me, but I was hungry and gulped it down.  If I ever wander into another sushi place, I'll know that I can handle some of this stuff no sweat.\\n\\nEach table is provided with a large pot of tea, which I always like, obviating the need to request refills from the servers.  By the way, I thought the service was just fine.  I know of several complaints logged here on Yelp about the service here.  All the young ladies bringing us food or taking our orders were friendly.  True, the male general manager probably would break his face if he tried to smile, but I was not offended.  Some people are just like that.  He quickly brought our bill and accepted US dollars, though he provided change to us in $ CAN.  No problem!\\n\\nBottom line--solid food, plenty of it given the AYCE option, and a good value.  Worth going back to when I have a hankering for a hunk of sushi (or BBQ)."},{"name":"Lamberts Downtown Barbecue","address":"401 W 2nd St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Great BBQ with nice sized servings.

Case in point, we were seated beside two Asian douches who kept making lewd comments while ogling Cactus Club servers next door.  One of them also kept throwing in words like \\"bra\\" and \\"roll\\" like they're in some kind of topsy-turvy Fast and Furious world.  The other one was sporting a thick yellow gold chain which didn't help his case at all.  We wanted to tap them on the shoulders and be like, hey, \\"tap\\" is not a cool word used in conjunction with a woman and you're like 5'6 so the chances of you scoring with the hot, TALL, Cactus Club server is zero.  It doesn't matter that you drive a pimped out Beamer.  It's just not happening.

Anyway, there is plenty of delicious goodness to eat that does not contain meat.  I was so excited about all the great options, I didn't know where to start.  My goal was to try a little of everything (but not meat, of course).  There is a bar set-up with serve-yourself foods, and you can also order anything off the breakfast menu.  And remember, this is all-you-can-eat, so go crazy and just order everything.  I was so impressed that, even though they make A LOT of different food for the brunch menu, every single dish is absolutely delicious like it was the only thing the chef made, so he knew how to make it great.  The food was so good that we actually sat at the table for about 45 minutes, sipping coffee, waiting to get hungry again.  It is a good idea to maybe not eat the night before so you'll be extra hungry for all this good food.  I did not want to leave.  I did not ever want to eat anything else besides the food at Lambert's brunch.   So well-presented, high quality, and flavorful.  This is one of those times when expensive food tastes better.

To me, it's always been a shame that there are not many nice restaurants with a craft beer focus.  Rockmill, along with Wolf's Ridge, is helping to fill that void in Columbus, and I appreciate that.\\n\\nThe space is a gorgeous update on the old World of Beer.  There is tons of rustic wood siding and exposed brick.  Everything is very dark.  Several of the old WOB beer coolers are gone.  Great plants around the room.  It's a beautiful space.  I have two complaints about the ambiance, though.  First, there are a surprising number of TVs in the space.  I can accept one or two over the main bar, but there are additional TVs behind the upstairs bar and around both floors.  It seems inconsistent with the vibe they've tried to create in the space.  My second complaint is that it's very loud.  Some noise dampening would be a welcome addition.  Those points aside, though, it truly is a lovely space.\\n\\nThe food was very nice, definitely a step up from most bars.  I had a tavern burger because I kept hearing how good it was.  It didn't disappoint, although it was VERY bloody and was undercooked from my medium specifications.  Nicely seasoned.  Pickled onions and bacon jam and cheddar cheese and a delicious ciabatta roll.  The fries were quite good too.  The burger was $14 and the fries were a la carte and cost an additional $5.  I think that's pretty steep for a burger and fries even if it is good, but to some degree you're paying for the ambiance.  The charcuterie board was just okay.  It was somewhat limited in its selection.  If you want a good charcuterie board, I'd go check out The Crest instead.\\n\\nThe beer was delicious as expected.  A large lineup of Rockmill beers is available on draft or in bottles, and I'm a big fan of their beers.  Wine and spirits are also available, and it looked like a nice booze selection behind the bar.\\n\\nThe service could have been better.  My wife had a long hair in her beer and the server watched her fish it out.  The server halfheartedly asked if she wanted a new beer and my wife felt embarrassed asking for one, so she declined.  A restaurant that sells a $19 burger and fries should be a restaurant where the server immediately whisks away a beer with a hair in it and replaces it without question or hesitation.  Our server also had no idea what was on the charcuterie board, which definitely seems like something she should know.  Very friendly, but not that great.  Hopefully this improves in time.\\n\\nOverall, it wasn't perfect (I hope I haven't focused too much on the complaints, because I really did enjoy my experience), but it was very nice and I had a pleasant visit.

I have a true appreciation for a spice that can make or break a dish. And given the extent to which I am adventurous with spices - especially those that make your palate go a bit crazy with heat; the use of Szechuan peppercorns in a couple of dishes I had at Blue Dragon the other day was my biggest take away from my first dining experience at this very fine restaurant. Here are my thoughts:\\n\\nAmbiance: 5 stars\\nLow key, yet very modern - the vibe at Blue Dragon is very sophisticated and yet very casual - a rare combination. That is largely due to the fact that the restaurant is quite small but the seating arrangement suits for pretty much any occasion or group setting. You can go there for a first date and get a cozy table by the window or the bar or right in the middle of the restaurant floor - depending on what time of the day you go there. Similarly, if you are a group of 6 or 8 or just going out with a couple of your best buds, there is a decent sized bar or tables with different chairs' counts. The decor is quite chic but really reflects the minimalistic attitude as is also evident from the food menu itself.\\n\\nFood: 4.5 stars\\nAgain, not a huge menu. But big enough for anyone who is not extremely indecisive to be able to make up their mind about what they want to eat, in max 5 minutes. The drinks / wine menu was quite extensive and they even had a very tempting specials of the day menu. And what I got to taste for my first experience, I have to say I am looking forward to the next time. \\n\\nPork & Scallion wontons: The wontons were delicious. What made them amazing was the red chilli oil which wakes up your taste buds - in the most literal sense of the words. We had to ask our waiter to find what were those flavors that was not heat but left a minty yet tingly sensation on your tongue. That's where we were introduced to the magic of Szechuan peppercorns. The real magic of the spice was in one of the main course dishes. That follows next!\\n\\nDan Dan noodles: The base of this dish is the very same red chilli oil in the appetizer described above. Now warn you, this may not be a dish for everyone. And so also the wontons. It just depends on how adventurous you are with your palate and what it can handle. I may not be in the mood to have this kind of spiciness in every other asian dish I would have in the future. But somehow it worked both for the wontons as well as for this noodles dish. I must say this dish was actually quite big as goes the quantity. Yet the minced pork, the combination of all the spices along with the chilli oil base - it all worked.\\n\\nPad Thai with scallops and bacon: Super fantastic. Probably my favorite of all the dishes. Despite the fact that the above 2 dishes had a bold flavor, the Pad Thai really stole the show - for me at least - primarily due to it's simplicity and also due to the fact it was a departure from what I am used to - in the form of spicy drunken Pad Thai and other flavors of the traditional Thai noodle dishes. The baby scallops were soft and melted in my mouth. And the bacon was - let's just say, the real, good stuff - fatty good ol bacon! (gym - I promise I will be back in action tomorrow). Fried egg, sweet and sour base, and those subliminally divine pieces of thinly minced red and green Thai chillies - and there were just 4 slices of them in totality. And a part of me wished there were 2 more a piece. But, then - maybe there was a reason there were only 4 of them.\\n\\nService: 4.5 stars\\nQuite full even for a very early Saturday dinner time, the staff was on their toes, working really hard, always around checking on the guests and keeping them all hydrated. The open kitchen was a reflection of what a well run establishment should be. Very impressive indeed.\\n\\nOverall: Every aspect of this dining experience at the Blue Dragon was a standout. If this is how this place is on a very busy summer evening, (and possibly during lunch hours given the Fort Point business district) - I can imagine the scene on an off weeknight. Every item on the menu looked very promising given the excellent experience for the very first time. On a parting note, if you have to use it, do try the first (unisex) rest room (of the 3) and get an up close look at the kitchen from the bathroom sink window. And yes, don't worry. The staff cannot see you from the other side!

However, after half an hour or so, the whole place was filled up with people. The yelp rating looked really good so I definitely had high expectations coming in. \\n\\nWe ordered summer roll with shrimp and pork, signature pho/beef noodle soup, and I also ordered a grilled pork banhmi to take home. The summer roll came with peanut sauce. Overall it was an okay - pretty plain. I didn't taste much pork. This is probably not something that I would get again. I got the signature pho in small. It was definitely more than enough in terms of portion. If you can't eat a lot, I would suggest you not getting the large one. The pho came with Chinese style meatballs, rare beef slices, beef stripes, onions, and green onions. A side of beansprouts, etc. was also included. Pretty standard offerings as all the other Vietnamese/pho restaurants. Honestly, if I were to given opinions on just the pho and summer roll, it only worth 3 stars to my standard. However, I have to highlight their grilled pork banhmi. It was way too delicious! I would come just for this! It came with grilled pork, mayo, cucumbers, pate, jalape√±os, cilantro, and pickled carrots. That crispy baguette was something that I can't forget and can't resist eating! This definitely bumped up my rating for Buckeye Pho to a 4-star restaurant. \\n\\nOverall service was an okay - not the friendliest but pretty efficient.

From the poke, raw oy/clams, to the king crab to the special ikkura in the soy sauce, each item was fresh, kept ice cold, and amzingly delicious.

For a Saturday night, prime time dinner hour, the place was dead and no need for any reservations. The food on the buffet line looked straight out of a horror film and seemed like it was sitting there all day from their lunch buffet. There was just something off with the selection of food. The sushi looked scary... I've never seen tuna so light in pink color before. I did not want to touch the raw bar or cold bar at all. The two things that I did have was the crab and the peel and eat shrimp. Both relatively average and had just the right amount of old bay. The lobster was next and they only allow one per plate as long as you come with a new plate each time, they will happily oblige to pick the lobster that you can't see and place it on your plate. The lobster was subpar as they are so small, you start to think if they caught these at legal size. Maybe I'm just a snob from the northeast where we can have lobsters pretty much anytime of the year but this was totally not worth it. Honestly for $37/pp not including tax and tip, I could've ate like a king up in New York. \\n\\nAlso, there are 4 things on the menu that you can't find on the buffet line that they will happily bring out for you if you want, baked potato, french fries, filet mignon and lobster bisque. The filet mignon was not cooked to order eventhough you can tell them how you would like your steak. Medium rare still came out medium after 4 orders of it. The lobster bisque tasted more like cheese soup and not a bisque at all. \\n\\nI only give it an additional star because the service was great. We did not have our coupon for a free drink but they still honored it when we googled it and found it on our phones to show them. They were also very attentive and kept changing our shell bowls and refilling our drinks. They also ask you once you're seated if you would like wine with your dinner. I think they try to make the place a bit fancier than it really is which is at the end of the day, still just a buffet. The selection is great but if the food does not look/taste good, you would feel limited to your choices and I did not want to chance it.

She came over and proceeded to explain to us exactly the same thing he said; \\"the kitchen overcooked the shrimp and was redoing it\\" and it would be out shortly - not helpful. That was it... Shrimp take like  a redo shrimp takes about 5 mins and a salad shouldnt take any longer either. Regardless of the issue i would have expected more of a fluid and sympathetic communication from the manager. Not saying we wanted the meal comped but a simple \\"mistakes happen i am sorry for your wait\\" would have made us feel better. Iv worked in the restaurant  industry for 5 years, i get it, shit happens.

Our party of 3 didn't have to wait but we were asked to share a big round table with another group. The restaurant is spacious and nicely decorated. It looked really clean compared to other dim sum places around Boston, which is probably their biggest appeal right now. Like many other reviewers have mentioned, the service is just okay. I asked for more chili sauce and never got it. I also asked for a can of gingerale and got a cup full of ice with very little soda in it. I finished the drink in 3 sips! Seemed like they filled it with ice and only poured half a can in. I know this is a Chinese restaurant and I don't expect them to speak English but it was frustrating communicating with them. I asked the cart ladies if they had certain items in English, signaling the fact that I can't understand/speak Chinese. Instead of realizing that and showing me what they had in their carts, they continued to shout at me in a language I don't understand. You can clearly tell I don't understand you so why keep shouting at me? It's a bit frustrating. \\n\\nWe ordered the usual dim sum fare: shrimp/beef dumplings, shrimp/beef rice noodle rolls, spare ribs, tripe, meatball, fried turnip cake.. and everything was decent/average. The consistency of the food was good. Didn't taste like they've been sitting out for a while, unlike some other dim sum places, but the flavor didn't stand out for me.

However, upon the realization that it was JUST before the Atlanta rush-hour and I still needed to make it back to Buckhead, I decided to make a short trip up the street to the new-ish Wendy's that I had heard was serving breakfast. Now, the concept of a Wendy's offering breakfast is totally new to me and I really did not know what to expect. Even more surprising, I had never been to such a new location and was astounded, just from going through the drive-through, to see how modern and up-to-date it seemed to be.\\n\\nI expected to be a bit confused and slow upon ordering and figured that I might have difficulty in finding the breakfast portion of the menu, seeing it from a distance and figuring out my order quickly enough so that I did not aggravate whomever was taking my order. Wow, I was [very happily] wrong! Luckily, there was no line behind me and the woman on the other end of the speaker very graciously told me to take my time putting together my order and to start talking whenever I was ready. Phew! Secondly, the automated, electronic screens only displayed the items that were currently available, thus allowing for space on the display for the menu and making the print and descriptions large enough for my lackluster eyes to read. Score! I finally decided that I would order a Mornin' Melt Panini and would order a sausage/biscuit platter as a supplement since I was unsure if my initial selection would actually be enough. In addition to the anticipation that I had for this new breakfast feast, Ashley was probably the friendliest and kindest drive-through team member who I have ever encountered and I think half of my excitement to dig into my meal stemmed from her enthusiasm and good-naturedness. I swear, anyone who can be this accommodating and nice at this time of the morning deserves an award!\\n\\nThough not huge, the panini was larger than I expected and I kind of wish that I had just ordered two. The melted cheeses (asiago and cheddar, I believe), bacon, fresh tomato (which actually tasted like flavorful, fresh tomato!) and fried egg (which was still squidgy and gooey in the center... YAY!) made this grilled composition perfect for a morning wake-me-up. I opened the platter tray when I got home and was a little sad to see that I had only scrambled eggs (these were better than any others I have gotten from a drive-through), a biscuit (again, not bad at all) and fried breakfast potatoes (I really liked these). I figured that the team was still ironing out kinks with the new addition and thought I would shoot as friendly of an email as possible to their location via the Wendy's website to compliment the service and just to let them know that their platters might not be totally mastered yet; I like to know when I am missing things at work and when someone tells me in a friendly and constructive way I oftentimes am quite appreciative. Within around 6 hours of sending the message I had received a response and I definitely look forward to heading back. I may even have to check out the inside, as this looks like the most modernized Wendy's that I have ever seen. I will definitely be back!"},{"name":"Cafe Intermezzo","address":"6000 N Terminal Pkwy, Councourse B","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"I'd give this place two stars, except I will always love the fact that it's an airport bar/restaurant/bookstore combo. The location is awesome - right in the center of concourse B in the airport. I've been there several times, but this last time I was pretty disappointed. I ordered a caesar salad with chicken and asked for the dressing on the side. It took FOREVER, which in airport time feels like DOUBLE FOREVER. So when the salad arrived, I saw the ramekin of dressing and it looked great. Except, then I saw under the chicken, that what I thought was shredded parmesan cheese, was actually dressing. \\n\\nSomehow the kitchen must have mistook \\"dressing on the side\\" for \\"extra dressing\\" on the side. (To be fair, they probably get a lot of that too...) Since it took so long for the original salad, I didn't want to send it back. It was okay - not drowning in dressing - but a lot of the lettuce was wilted and the chicken was gummy. It just seemed to me that the quality of the food has taken a hit.

Fresh fruit and fresh fish were used for our meals and it's easy to tell when places cut corners in this aspect, which I'm glad to say Thai Curry did not. I'm fairly certain they didn't even use frozen fish, or at minimum it was cooked perfectly and very tender. Portions were average to generous and did not disappoint. Our waiter was well mannered and attentive, not a single problem. The atmosphere was a very clean and they succeed at being a step ahead of the little strip mall they're found in. Not going to lie, I'm actually salivating thinking about it, but I am a little hungry at the moment. \\n\\nOverall I was pleasantly surprised, as the food quality is generally found in much higher scale restaurants but with portions to match a mom and pop shop.\\n\\nMy parents have been back a handful of times since for the food.

It draws you in with a nice looking facade, a neat little story, some epic looking desserts...and then sticks it to you with mediocre food, poor service and an 18% gratuity (for 5 people).  Chicken texture was like the thing had been freeze-dried, and had no seasoning whatsoever.  Chips/crackers that came with our brie appetizer were stale.  And I don't mean like lacking a little crunch.  I mean like chips you left in an open bag in your drawer for three months stale - these things had no crunch at all.  Dessert was fine, but really, wouldn't you have to try extremely hard to screw up a chocolate milkshake, topped with a brownie and fudge sauce?  If you can't do that then, well, \\"Chocolate Emporium\\" is a bit of a misnomer, isn't it?  \\n\\nAs for the service,  I'll say this - our server was nice and seemed like she was trying.  But she was either overwhelmed or new or I don't know what.  The pacing of the dishes was terrible.  We were brought the wrong dish, and charged for both.  Every request was followed by an unreasonable wait time.  And if that wasn't enough, they forgot to give us back our credit card, which we didn't discover until later that day.  The restaurant did not respond AT ALL to any of our numerous contacts.  Did I mention the 18% gratuity?\\n\\nIn the end, this place has so much potential.  But I get the sense that they would rather use their eye candy (pun intended) to draw in the crowds rather than give their customers a good experience.  Scanning the Yelp reviews, I noticed that the business owner only responds to 4 and 5-star reviews.  That is a sign that you just don't care.

Still, it was a bit after 11:00 AM when I went in. They have two donut display cases flanking either side of register/place where you place your order. I am not exaggerating when I say that they had fifteen donuts. That's not fifteen (15) *types* of donut, that's fifteen *total* donuts. If I had been going to get a decent regular mix of a dozen donuts, I would not have been happy with the selection. Also, they had no regular glazed donuts, the go-to staple of any donut shop I have ever been in. \\n\\nI want to add that I am ALL ABOUT supporting small, local establishments, and I want to allow for the possibility that they just had abnormally low stock or high sales on this day, but, you can't sell what you don't provide.

Our two orders of spring rolls came out fried, not resembling the fresh and succulent looking rolls in the picture on our table - which apparently were NEVER a menu item.  My guest's Grilled Steak Salad was a pile of iceberg lettuce with a few good shakes of crushed chili pepper and some tough beef, doused in fish sauce.  And my marinated chicken came out as a chicken leg on a plate - that's it - a chicken leg on a plate. Who the hell wants that?\\n\\nI was so embarrassed to have brought someone visiting from out of town to this place.  Not at all representative of the food options available in this city.

I've been here a few times over the years.  The food is OK especially considering that it's all-you-can-eat, but they ALWAYS seem to \\"forget\\" part of your order.  It's happened every time that I've been here; food mysteriously never makes it to the table.  Where's the Jell-O dammit?!\\n\\nWhen we arrived, the host curtly asked if we had a reservation.  We told him we did, but he couldn't seem to find it.  He brushed us off and told us to wait for our friends.  Turned out our friends had already been seated; we had to take it upon ourselves to go into the eating area and take a look since the host did not know which table to take us to.\\n\\nFood arrived shortly after it was ordered, but as I previously mentioned, we didn't receive all the items we ordered.  Also, the heat on our BBQ grill wasn't even.\\n\\nI believe Shabusen has a time limit of 1 1/2 or 2 hours.  After a little under an hour, we decided that we were done eating and wanted to sit and chat for a bit.  Our server asked if we were done ordering as he cleared away our plates.  We said we were and we received our bill very shortly thereafter and were told that we could pay at the front.  For the next 15 minutes, the staff did not ask how we were doing and only gave us dirty looks for occupying a table that they probably hoped to give to more paying customers.  No one asked if we wanted more tea; one server \\"helpfully\\" pointed out again that we could pay at the front.\\n\\nIf you want a \\"Wham! Bam!

For those of you who don't know, musubi is a snack of Japanese origin. It consists of seasoned rice, often with a little bit of something tasty in the center (such as cooked salmon, spicy tuna, umeboshi (pickled plum), or cooked donbu (seaweed). It is shaped into a triangle and wrapped in fresh nori (the seaweed wrapper used in sushi rolls). So you get this tasty rice ball, with a bit of something, wrapped in nori. Basically a Japanese snack. The Hawaiians took this concept and added spam to it. The spam version takes on a rectangular shape, with the nori holding the whole contraption together. Ok, food lesson is over. On to the review...\\n\\nGod (or the Devil) is definitely in the details, and Musubi gets those details down! The rice is perfectly seasoned, and holds together long enough to reach your mouth, where it gently falls apart into recognizable tasty grains of rice. No gluey rice here folks, you get great rice. \\n\\nI ordered the seasoned seaweed, and the salted salmon for my two musubi. Both executed well. Great flavor, and neither too much nor too little filling. \\n\\nI ordered it to go, and here is where they won my undying love. You see, if you just wrap the nori around the rice, it becomes soggy by the time you get it home. So the Japanese perfected a secret origami wrapping technique where the plastic wrapper actually keeps the nori and the rice separate and distinct. You pull a red tab at the top, and then pull the corners off the two sides, and the nori magically enfolds the rice at the perfect moment. It's the Asian equivalent of pouring the milk on your cereal at the exact right moment so that you don't end up eating mush. \\n\\nI did not try their spam musubi, but they make their own version of spam by hand, and I suspect that it is Ono.\\n\\nFinally, I'd like to give a shout out to the aloha of the owner. He is warm and friendly, and you can feel his heart in his restaurant. He has plans to have a happy hour with pupus and beverages, and I am sure it will not disappoint. \\n\\nThe limitation of the restaurant will be its limited seating space. There is a 4 top bar, and maybe room for a 2-4 top table. But, look people, this is a great snack meant to be enjoyed as a brief moment of simple pleasure during a busy day. So go do yourself a favor and enjoy a bite!"},{"name":"Grand View Szechuan Restaurant","address":"4181 Fraser Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Probably my most favourite go-to Chinese restaurant.

I really love the place, and it lives up to it's name of a dhaba--or roadside cafe--with all the implications of cheap, quick, satisfying food.  The quality of the food is comparable to or better than most Indian restaurants in the area, many of which charge nearly twice as much (clearly a high end Indian restaurant that charges $15 and up per dish might prepare their dishes more thoughtfully prepared, but by all means, Punjabi Dhaba's standards like saag paneer--at just $4.95!-- compare favorably to these standards elsewhere which are frequently in the $8-$12 range).  My favorites are saag paneer, chicken saagwala ($6.95), chicken tikka masala ($6.95), and the Dhaba Special chicken tikka masala with chickpeas ($9.95).  The chai is DELICIOUS and the lassi's are also very good--I get the sweet lassi (I think they call it Punjabi lassi) and the mango lassi.  Naan is also good.  If you're in the mood for something greasy, try Punjabi Chole Poori--it's poori, a fried bread, with a chickpea dish for $3.95 (ironically, it's listed under 'Light Food').\\n\\nIf you want take out, call ahead to avoid waiting in line.  This place is packed on weekend nights (and often on weeknights, too) but that's part of the fun.

I saw something that looked good between the bodies -- Oreo Cheesecake, so I walked right up to the counter and placed my order.  The guy was super friendly and packaged me up quickly.\\n\\nWhen I ate it later that night, I actually wasn't all that impressed.  I mean, sure it was good, but it wasn't the best I'd ever had.  I hate to say it, but Cheesecake Factory is probably better (and I detest chains).  Mike's cheesecake isn't at all sweet.  Creamy, yes.  Sweet, no.  If I'm eating dessert, I want it to be sweet.\\n\\nMy friend got a cannoli, and I'm not at all a fan of cannoli, but I will say it was the best I'd ever tasted.  She also got a lobster roll... is that what they call it?  And why?  There's no lobster in it.  Kinda tasted like a cream puff.  Good, but again, not sweet.\\n\\nIt's worth a visit.  It's even worth a return visit.  I'd go again and try something else.  It's kinda fun being part of the madness, but I would probably stay far away if I actually lived in Boston.\\n\\nCa$h only!"},{"name":"Modern Pastry Shop","address":"257 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Last night I woke up from a dream, reliving the amazingness that was Modern Pastry's Vanilla Custard Cannoli with chocolate chips, and immediately hopped online to check and see if I could find a cheap flight to satisfy my craving.

Let me say this right up front, the service was outstanding last night. Our waiter was pleasant, knew the menu and made us feel right at home. We started with an eggplant dip that was only ok, the presentation on this dip was just bad, laying a semi viscous dip on a large leaf of romaine makes it difficult to eat and just did not look appetizing. The dip had good flavor but was a bit too thin. The tossed salad for me and Caesar for my wife were fine, but a bit of attention might have kept the kitchen from using brown lettuce on mine.  My wife had the appetizer portion Mac N Cheese, it was a much larger portion than she expected and it tasted great! The issue here is that to be a great dish Mac N Cheese should be creamy, a bechamel would have made this a fantastic dish. As served it was dry and a bit oily.  I had the vegetable risotto and again, great overall flavor with a boat load of fresh vegetables. Here again, the texture was not what a risotto should be.  This was more or less a sticky rice, it needed more time in the pan and more stock added to get a classic risotto feel.

My review is so that you don't make the same mistake of driving past Woody and Jo's day in and day out, wondering if it's worth the stop. It's totally worth the stop.\\n\\nAppearance is everything, and that's probably why so many of you have skipped over this Rib Shack. A window here and there that isn't boarded up, a better sign, perhaps some cheerful paint and this place would have 40 Yelp Reviews. After living in this 'hood for 2 years I still hadn't stepped foot inside. It took moving out of Weinland Park and to Olde Towne and then back to Campus before we were drunk enough to say \\"Fuck it, let's go get some ribs\\". \\n\\nAnd then we feasted.\\n\\nThe inside is just as in need of repair as the outside. A wealthy friend of the neighborhood could do some great work helping out this locally owned business just by buying some paint. The girl at the counter was sweet as can be and took our order for a whole slab and half slab of ribs. For 4 people the total came to $30. We took our loot home (nowhere to dine inside) and stuffed ourselves and had ribs leftover. Our order came with buttered bread which was not needed, but the boys made short work of it by using it as a primitive tool for slopping up sauce. Our ribs were sloppy saucy, just the way I like it.\\n\\nThese ribs aren't Ray Ray's ribs. They're not City BBQ ribs. But they're still darn good ribs. Smokey and meaty and just a bit tough, this is quality drunk food. I used the leftover bones and meat to make a bean soup (which was amazing).\\n\\nGranted, I was intoxicated, but I'm pretty sure Woody and Jo's is cash only. And I think I saw a sign about not accepting $20 bills? So bring $5's and $10's to be on the safe side.\\n\\nWith Weinland Park facing some major renovation and gentrification in the near future, I really hope Woody and Jo's sticks around. Maybe with a facelift and room to dine in.\\n\\nGo. Eat.

Pulled up to the orange garage and LOVED their new parking spot technology. Before you go I the garage there is a board that tells you how many spots there are on each floor so you can already know what floor you are going to turn into instead of just going around looking for a spot. Once you pick a floor then each row will have a sign telling you how many spots are down the row, and then once you look down the row each parking space has a light above it and when there is a space available then the light will be green. Makes parking ( used to be the worst part) the easiest part of your visit. \\n\\nOnce you get to Disney springs they have options for everyone. They have all different types of shops and restaurants all around. They also have many different options for dining. We went to planet Hollywood for late lunch/ early dinner ( will review that on a separate post). The scenery is exquisite around Disney springs.

However, our server came over and when asking us how we were enjoying everything, she looked at our mac&cheese and asked us how particular we were enjoying that side. She told us that their mac&cheese normally does not look so burnt (without us even mentioning we agreed), and told us she would prefer to give us a brand new one if we would not mind waiting two minutes.

So, naturally, I was told of Mike's Pastry and their famous cannoli's and other assorted deliciousness. Located nearby the North End Church and the Paul Revere House, Mike's Pastry is one of the more popular ones out there in the North End and I was hard pressed not to go there during my day trip to Boston. The line was not particularly long that day I was there, but it was crowded for sure.\\n\\nThere were quite a few flavors of cannoli to choose from and I ultimately ordered 3 of them for lunch. Not that healthy or ideal for me, but it was cheap. I got the blueberry and 2 strawberry ones. I figured that I would just stick to the classic flavors and I will be alright. The taste here was nothing short of awesome, although it was a bit too sweet for my tooth. Don't get me wrong, I love this stuff, but I guess having too much isn't very good either. Still it was good and well worth the trip to Boston's North End.\\n\\nThe service here was fast and hastily. Like a regular bakery, you want to service the most people as fast as you can and I understand that. Most of these establishments are not personalized when a mass of people just want something from the display case, so it was just a mad rush to get in and out without any questions asked. Prices were on the cheaper side, so that was awesome. I had cash on me at the time, so I paid cash, unknowing that I needed that for tolls later on in my trip. Whoops. I want to love this place, but I don't know. Sure, the desserts are to die for, but something was missing. Can't put my finger on it though. Its one of Boston's iconic businesses and hope that they are going to be in business for many years to come.\\n\\nOverall, I would recommend going to Mike's Pastry to sample their cannolis and other decadent treats.

The arepas rellenas with shredded beef are very unique to Colombia/Venezuela, and if you haven't tried them, you are definitely missing out, they are to die for, and are way different than tacos/gorditas/ pupusas.  The grilled masa/dough in the arepas was so delicious, and the beef and cheese and avocado with the tomato salsa was amazing.  Although Artessano has tacos on their menu, tacos do not exist in Colombia, and the owner said they added them after everyone was asking for tacos. :/  Do yourself a favor and skip those and try the arepas and patacones and fresh juices blended with milk.

They were super small (what on earth do the normal size nachos look like?) and there was basically no cheese or toppings on them. A few of us complained to the waitress, who started to argue with us. We asked her to take them back and add more cheese. She was very resistant, but finally complied. When they returned they weren't much better, but some bits of cheese could be seen. The waitress then was a no-show (perhaps embarrassed at how she spoke to us?) and we had to hunt her down for the bill. They did charge us half price for the nachos, which was decent.

What a decadent place for dessert. Spent so long trying to decide on what to get cause there are a ton of amazing options. Ended up getting the \\"may contain nuts\\" sundae, which was a peanut butter lovers dream. Peanut butter ice cream, Reese's pieces and Reese's m&ms, cheesecake coated in chocolate,  and peanut brittle (my favorite part), topped with whipped cream and peanuts. I shared with two people cause there's no way I could eat it all myself (probably was enough for 4 people). We all enjoyed it, although it is a bit extreme with the peanut flavor, and I maybe would've liked other flavors to balance it, like maybe more chocolate or vanilla. \\n\\nOverall though we were glad to indulge at this place, so much so that we went back for lunch the day. We got brussel sprouts, which were cooked well with good flavor but a bit over-salted since it came with feta cheese that's already salty. My sister ordered the veggie panini, which came on deliciously toasted bread with really good French fries. My mom ordered the artichoke and goat cheese flatbread--it was good but I prefer soft flatbread versus the crunchy wonton like thing it came on. Also would've liked more tomatoes and fresh veggies on it. My Sedona BBQ chicken salad came late cause there was a mixup, but the waiter apologized and was aware. It was fresh and pretty much just what you'd expect from a chicken tortilla type salad. For dessert this time we got the flourless chocolate cake, which took a LONG time to come but worth the wait.

I guess if your kids will only eat chicken fingers this works.\\n\\nThe building is across the street from the BJ's in Weymouth.  The front of the building is a rather large bar area, that on the one occasion that I've visited for take out was relatively full of people.

Today, I didn't bother, and tried one of the fries. Soggy and partially burnt are the best descriptor words I have for them....aka not good. The tuna melt was ok, lots of mayo...almost a bit soupy, lots of butter for flavor and the bread was slightly over toasted...occasional taste of burnt coming through, but it had pickles (love tuna melts with pickles....guess that is a further draw back if you are a pickle hater).

Interesting factoid: I was actually in the DVD that was sent out to potential Boneheads franchisees.  I happened to be walking in for lunch when they were filming one of the promotional videos.  That may have been my zero seconds of absolutely no fame.\\n\\nAnywhoo... Fishook Grille (FG) is basically the same as Boneheads (BH) was, but oddly everything has been craptimized (opposite of optimized) just a little bit for some reason.  I don't think it would take much for them to get back to the quality that BH had, but right now it is lacking - sorely.  \\n\\nWe had the Fishook Shrimp appetizer.  I used to love the Bonheads Shrimp and this is basically the same.  HOWEVER, the shrimp seem a bit smaller and the breading is a bit thicker.  These two changes push the breading to meat ratio into the undesirable regime for me.  Additionally, the increased surface area of the smaller shrimp means there is more mayonnaisy sauce all around - also not a good effect.  We had a cup of the gumbo soup, as well.  It was a D+ at best... worthless and weak!  Also, they put a different number on our order than the one they handed us for the table.  Funny, maybe... funny enough... I don't think so.  We had to force a reset condition on the little humanoid automaton that was carrying around our apps in an endless loop.  Since the numbers didn't match, she couldn't believe they were ours.  The fact that there were no other tables that matched the number and our receipt showed that we ordered exactly the apps she was holding just didn't seem to compute to this advanced tinker-toy-android.\\n\\nNext the entrees come.  Normally I hate to wait for anything, but at the same time I have a real peeve with entrees arriving when I am still eating my app/salad.  Uhhh.. or in this case when I am just lifting the first bite of the app into my mouth.  Of course, that may have been because of the extra time it took to wrest the apps from the aforementioned android.  In a further app-spoiling glance we notice that two of our sides are missing.  It appears that in addition to keying in the wrong table-code, the surferdude-acneriddled-manchild (SAM) that took our order at the counter also missed hearing that we ordered sides.  This was after having us repeat the order a few times because he seemed totally brain dead.   \\n\\nSo, SAM's sidekick, the delivery android, examines our receipt only to tell us that we \\"didn't order the sides.\\"  When we explained that we did indeed order them, she looked at us with vile displeasure and queried vacantly, \\"do you still want them?\\" ... No, you little yam head... when we ordered them, we were just kidding!  In frustration, we told her to forget about it.  She was happy to oblige.  The entrees themselves - a salmon salad and a taco trio were barely average crap.  Definitely nowhere as good as I recall BH being.  That is for sure.  \\n\\nOur salmon was a little overcooked, and thus rubbery.  While we ordered two tilapia tacos and one piri piri chicken for the taco trio, all three were tilapia.  In this case, the receipt was correct, so it wasn't SAM but his colleagues behind the grille.  It looks the whole staff is equally fabulous at this establishment.  Regardless, the tilapia seemed decently fresh, but was totally flavorless.  I did not approve.  Both the asian slaw and the sweet potato fries were quite good though. \\n\\nIn summary, clean up you act boys and girls.  You are so close, but just no cigar.

Huong has great prices on every dish and huge portions! Vegetables are fresh, noodles aren't mushy and soup had great taste! I ordered a bowl of Pho with everything in it as well as shrimp springrolls. I then ordered grilled pork vermacelli and another order of springrolls to go. Everything was AWESOME!!! I'm tired of those restaurants that try too hard to please the public by overhead, color and new flavors. They need to keep it authentice and original. I will definitely recommend Huong's to everyone craving some Vietnamese food."},{"name":"Feisty Lamb","address":"2174 W Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Our first Christmas in Portland and we needed a place to go for Christmas Eve dinner.

However, I have to say that their ricotta filling is much creamier, yet not as heavy as Mike's cannoli. I like it more. Their shell is also a bit thinner and crisper, which can go either way depending on your taste. Overall, I find Modern's cannolis to be more refined. I wish they had more varieties like Mike's, but if I ever just want an original flavor, I'll definitely come to Modern."},{"name":"Thai Basil","address":"1215 Thurlow St","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Probably my favourite Thai place in town.

The hostess said she would send someone in shortly to get us a drink. The whole time we were there, servers kept coming in and making drinks for customer that were eating. Every time that happened, they asked us if we needed anything more. We ended up getting more service than if there was a bartender\\nthere all the time. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. They even asked if we were sure we didn't want food. I felt that since they were being good to us that I would order and appetizer and one dish. The BBQ Pork and the Kung Pao Chicken were pretty good and the drinks were great. I gave them 4 stars because of the service mainly but  the food we had was good too. Being in close proximity to the Keller they really should have someone working the bar on event nights. Mainly because in the hour or so we were sitting there, about 15 people tried to sit in the lounge. Since we were in the bar already they kinda had to let people that were just having drinks stay but asked the people that were eating to sit in the dining room. I'm sure that was easier on their servers but it also assured the customers that they would get better service than a lounge area that did not have a full time worker in there.\\nPlease add a weekend bartender but also kudos to the staff for trying to serve everyone in the best way that they could."},{"name":"Mother‚Äôs Bistro & Bar","address":"121 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"By far the best breakfast joint in Portland.

Not bad, but the broth was average to American restaurants. Comes with the standard veggies for pho, and was happy about that. Otherwise, I was not blown away (which is standard) \\n\\nBeef spring rolls: Eh, mostly veggies and filler. Not bad. The fish sauce dip they make here tastes like sugar, but it's easier to add fish sauce than to make it sweeter. I'm assuming this was done to accommodate tastes.

We found a seat at the upstairs bar which is very eclectic atmosphere (think the Wild Wild West movie with Will Smith), Maria the bartender was excellent in her service and conversation.  After about 40 min into our wait, a table of 8 opened near us.  After waiting 10 min I inquired to the hostess on status of that table.  She informed me there was another party of 8 in front of us who had just been paged.  Not a problem.  Another 10 min and no one sat.  Then a second table of 8 opened up and was ready.  Back to hostess.  She indicated she would look into it and came back 5 min later saying the table was still reserved for the other 8 person in front of us plus a pre reserved table.  Another 10min before I finally got my text our table was ready. Oh thanks.  We didn't get one of the empty tables (still empty) by us but a downstairs room with no view.  However after a nice conversation the host/hostess accommodated and sat us at the table of 8 that had been open for at least 30 min. Our server came rather quickly and was very accommodating.  Overall food was very good and reasonably priced and almost everyone at our table was very satisfied.  Portions were decently large and satisfying.  The only issues, which was more safety related, was the slipperiness of the upstairs floors. In normal running shoes from being at the park all day the floors were very slippery and the restrooms were even worse. Almost like being on ice.   Even commented to server who said they've complained about the same thing to management.  A real safety hazard for both workers and guests.  Overall great food and good prices.

The main shopping area had plenty of parking, though a longer walk.\\n\\nService:  Attentive and nice waitresses.

You have to tell the cashier your table number and she rings you up. I had to tell her what number my table was and what I ordered (corrected her that I ordered 2 instead of 1 banh mi sandwiches). \\n\\nVietnamese Iced Coffee:  I ordered this to go and was missing 1/3 of my drink (picture). I was expecting it to be a full cup not 2/3. This was my first time ordering it and it was extremely strong (I think I was supposed to get more milk in mine - the other 1/3 perhaps?). \\n\\nOverall, a great experience, food and service.

Having heard that they do not take reservations, my coworker and I arrived at 6:15PM on a Friday. Parking was not too difficult, as there's a parking lot off back, otherwise you may have to find street parking in the South Congress (SoCo) area. But maybe that's if you arrive early, as we did. Since they start seating at 5:30PM, we were told it'd be 45 minutes at least before a table opened up. Yes, they were already full! So we took a table by the wall in the bar area, and what a wonderful bar it is. And the decor is quite nice, an exposed-brick-and-glass fronted by an impressive antipasto case, and in back a seasonal garden filled with the likes of eggplant, tomatoes, chard, green beans, and squash. Here too the bar was already packed. It's also a very romantic setting, but not too dim. It can be noisy, but not uncomfortably so. By the end of our meal, the bar was packed 2 and 3 people deep. And quite a good-looking crowd as well. And what were all these people waiting for? There's a reason Vespaio is the number one restaurant in Austin, and it's the flawlessly prepared sublime and complex Italian cuisine by celebrity chef Ryan Sampson. The bar has a long list of antipasti on the wall, and the regular menu comes with a separate page full of daily specials. There's also an extensive wine list. Service is very good, as well. Our bread came with a cannellini bean dip with garlic and parsley oil, which was amazing. I loved it for not being commonplace butter, and being lactose-intolerant, I was further overjoyed as well. Not to mention that it tasted wonderful. And cannellini beans are known for their buttery taste. With this kind of start, you know the remainder of the meal will not disappoint. For my starter, I had the zuppa, a brandied fish bisque served with basil-wrapped gulf coast shrimp, $8. It was one gulf coast shrimp that came on the side, but it was huge, the size of a roll of quarters curled up into a spiral. I added it to my soup, which was so very yummy. Next I had the potato-crusted ruby snapper over creamed fennel and leeks finished with Tasmanian lump crab meat, $29, another daily special. It must be a Texas thing, to have two kinds of meat in one dish! The potato crust reminded me of hash browns, or shoestring pommes frites, and had a delightful crunchy texture. This dish was very delicious. And portions are large, enough to share. My coworker had the spinach salad and the prosciutto-wrapped gulf coast shrimp with risotto cakes and mustard greens. The risotto cakes, crabcake-like spheres, were a delight to eat. We were both nearly full by now, but managed to fit in dessert. I had the Fuji apple bread pudding, a warm brioche pudding studded with apples and golden raisins topped with Calvados (an apple liqueur) hard sauce and finished with a golden raisin syrup, $7. I enjoyed this dessert very much, the Calvados sauce an excellent pairing with the Fuji apples. My coworker had wanted something to cleanse her palate of the salty prosciutto, and the Meyer lemon sorbet did the job perfectly. You can eat more cheaply at Vespaio, but you'll wind up spending about $44 if you order one of the more expensive entrees, but no matter what you decide, it's all splendid."},{"name":"Mike's Pastry","address":"300 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"4 stars instead of 5 only because sometimes the wait is just absolutely absurd.

The famous yard stick drink is enormous and although the drinks are deliciously favored with many juices those suckers sneak up on you! Senor Frogs has a variety of drinks to choose from such as house drinks, margaritas, shots, froggi-tinis, ice cream drinks, and beer. You have the option to choose from either a regular size drink, the palm ($14), or the yard stick ($19.) The cup is a souvenir that you can take home and refilling it cost only 2 bucks less than the original price. You could never go wrong with the famous Senor Frog drink or the Frog Buster. Like I previously mentioned they are disguised juice drinks so remember that before you decide to hit the famous Senor Frog's conga line because they will give shots.\\n\\nSenor frogs is a restaurant as well and they have food items such has appetizers, sandwiches, quesadillas, mexican platters, pasta, and more so you could never go hungry. The absofreakinlutely best part about this place is the way it's decorated inside, it's all carribbean themed with dim lighting, they have a stage for entertainment, humorous bar butt chairs, painting of frogs dressed as tourist. Just by looking around you will be entertained and that's not mentioning the reggae band, jello shot girls, live entertainment by the energetic staff, and dancing contest. \\n\\nThis is a great addition to the I drive area and I am ecstatic about this Senor Frogs finally being in Orlando.

There's a huuuuuuuuuuge variety of reduced prices apps and plates, and the drinks are reasonably priced and pretty delicious. \\n\\nThings that are not great: consistency and food delivery times, which are simple fixes and errors that only inexperienced servers should make. The most offensive of silly mistakes was that we ordered sushi rolls and dessert at the same time. Keep in mind that the dessert was served warm and had ice cream, so it was melting quickly, and it arrived within minutes of us ordering it. I was thinking that I wanted to ask the server to take it back and have it brought back after our sushi had arrived, but we didn't see her and as a result, we started eating it. Our sushi rolls arrived about 5 minutes later, and I'll be honest, it was kind of gross and off putting to eat sushi after dessert. When I brought this up to our server, she was basically just like \\"really? Well I put the dessert in 5 min after the sushi, so I guess they took longer with the sushi\\". The only issue with that explanation is that the dessert arrived within 5 minutes, so the timeline definitely didn't match up. I get that mistakes happen, but can you not lie to me? I'm not an idiot...I used to be a server. I know how a kitchen works.\\n\\nThe second issue: I ordered a sparkling sangria that was seriously great...so great that my friend ordered one as well. It was fabulously presented with beautiful raspberries and oranges, yet my friend's identical drink has zero raspberries. She brought this up to the server, who said the fruit was in the glass, and pointed to the oranges like we were dumbasses, but it was just oranges, no raspberries. She asked for raspberries specifically and the server reluctantly brought out this dish of three raspberries...one of which was weird and rotting and gross. So, thanks for that? \\n\\nPrices were good, food was good, service started out great and then dropped to severely lacking. I'm a super patient customer, I understand when shit gets real and I'll empathize with a rough day. However, if you lie to me? And more than once? Game over. I'll definitely go back and give it one more chance, with the hopes that it's a one time offense, because the prices were so great and I really enjoyed my food.

It's a bit dingy, but it's also dirt cheap and the food is surprisingly good. You order and pay at the counter. Then you sit and wait for 5-10 minutes for them to serve up your meal in stainless steel trays. Not a spot for date night, but we visited on an early Monday evening and service was speedy.  \\n\\nAlso, the guy taking our order at the counter was really helpful! We tried to order 3 dishes, thinking that the cheap prices meant skimpy portions and he shook his head at us, and said with a frown, \\"For just you two?  Too much food!\\" Now, the boyfriend eats like his stomach is a bottomless pit, so we were pretty skeptical but took his advice and ordered 2 entrees since we weren't actually starving. We also tried to purchase a bottle of water from the cooler for $1, but the guy pointed out the free water from the dispenser and we put it back. Seriously?  You are trying to dissuade us from spending more money?!  That was kinda funny and cool, so I tipped him a little extra ;)\\n\\nWhen our food came up, each compartment of the tray held a different item--basmati rice, main dish, sliced red onions, a tangy onion chutney, and a cooling yogurt sauce with shredded mint and carrots. The chicken tikka ($6.95) was made with large tender pieces of dark meat, but I think the sauce was a bit watery and less flavorful than versions I've tried at Punjab Palace and Rani. The saag paneer ($4.95!) was really good and creamy. Funny how good overcooked spinach can taste, huh?? Also, the counter guy was right. The portions were just right, leaving us sated but not overstuffed. \\n\\nI wanted to try the lassis (pre-made and stocked in the cooler), but the outrageous hot neon coloring of the drinks kinda scared me off...maybe next time.

They stepped out of the normal box that is in the traditional sense of a pho restaurant and made the menu, well, interesting.\\n\\nThere's different varieties of pho to choose from from seafood, chicken and different cuts of meat. They experimented with a new type of pho called the lobster which i haven't gotten a chance to try but have heard from great things about. Unfortunately, i would prefer to have a \\"special\\" bowl of pho with all the cuts of beef in it to make it special but that's up for debate between the owners. I ordered the meat lovers bowl of pho but they ran out of tendon (new restaurant, new kinks) so i replaced with beef tongue, not bad. My friend had the \\"pho with us\\" bowl with the rib in it, she's never had pho with a rib in it and neither have i so it was a good experience for us both. \\n\\nThe pho was unexpectedly great for me. Good portion size, flavor was there, and like an southern Vietnamese type of pho, the broth wasn't overwhelming which allows creativity between the guests and have guests \\"create\\" the flavor to their liking. Commend the chef and owner on that. \\n\\nCreate new twist with the green tea Thai tea. I would've liked to taste a bit more tea, and less milk but that is probably due to errors that can be fixed later in time. \\n\\nDecor is new, modern with a twist of traditional Vietnamese architecture in it, with a beautiful mural on the wall of the restaurant. \\n\\nOverall, great experience, a few flaws here and there but it was great."},{"name":"Mike's Pastry","address":"300 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Like a dream.

The crust was cooked to perfection and the toppings were delicate yet paired so appropriately with the sauce. We also had the Cioppino which had the most delightful sauce. I would bathe in that sauce if I could. It was fatty yet light, had incredible spices and was made to be soaked up by their crunchy and chewy bread. I don't remember the name of the wine I had, but it was a bold red that paired perfectly with everything we had. We topped it off with some lychee ice cream which was unexpectedly yummy. We sat at the bar which was cozy and had a very old school Italian vibe from the decor to the waiters.

That establishment had an excellent reputation for kick-ass burgers, assorted pub foodstuff and an excellent draught collection. Be aware that these are new owners, though! [Please see owner comments below; the restaurant is not as new as I may have implied].  Arlington has a shortage of good weekend brunch places so we decided to gingerly test the \\"grounds' one Sunday afternoon.  Hmm, the Huevos Rancheros sounds good, even though we're a 3,500 drive from the Yucatan. The menu declares \\"Eggs any style\\", so I'll have mine poached, por favor!  The immediate reply from the waitstaff: \\"The chef doesn't do poached.\\" Ok, I'll have them sunny-side up (the online brunch menu does say \\"non-poached\\", so this bogie is on me ;-)).  Except for that bit of kerfuffle, the fried eggs were perfectly cooked, the pico de gallo savory, the Spanish sausage delicately spicy, and the black beans, as dark as night.  We also ordered the waffle and that was excellent as well. Points off for non-fresh squeezed OJ and mediocre diner-pot coffee but those were a trifle compared to the mains.\\n  \\nWe decided to graduate to the dinner menu one weekend evening. The restaurant  is not busy until around 7 or so and we arrived on the early side of 6:00.  First order was to try a selection of the 20 of the draught beer selection. The best way to do this is to order a flight of 4 and the baked pretzel (which comes with honey-mustard and something known as \\"beer cheese\\".  The flight passed with flying colors, i.e. pale pilsner, amber IPA, chocolatey porter, and a dark stout.\\n  \\nNow what from the main menu?  Hmm, I sense this is a burger a place, but I'll try the 1/2 roasted chicken with mashed potatoes as I am in need of some comfort food.  \\"Is it juicy?\\" I asked our server. \\"It's VERY juicy\\". Great! There's nothing like a nice roasted chicken to delight the senses!  After what seems like 1/2 hour (now they're busy, but they're probably roasting my chicken!!).  Oh no, what's that?  A plate of what looks like a skinned rabbit is placed in front of me.  \\"Err, excuse me\\", I asked the food delivery person, \\"I ordered the 1/2 roast chicken but it looks like you delivered a portion of road-kill\\". \\"I'll get your server\\".  Now we begin kerfuffle part two.  \\"Yes, that is the half roasted chicken\\", she declares. \\"But where is the bone?\\", I asked. \\"That's how we serve it; the menu doesn't say it comes with a bone\\", is the response.  \\"Yes but it also doesn't say it is boneless!\\", I  pleaded as she rushed away leaving me to figure out what to do.  I tried what I took to be the breast, and of course it was dry and rather tasteless so I asked for the manager.  I must say the manager is a delightful  chap and he quickly righted the wrong and served me my back-up choice, the lamb sliders, in under 5 minutes (always have a back-up choice is my rule!!).  The sliders won the game for me and hence the three stars.  The bottom line is remember that the CG is first and foremost a pub, so best to order the pub-style food. The beer selection is awesome and the brunch is among the best in the area.  On a subsequent occasion, after ordering a properly dressed burger, I may just have to revisit the rating!"},{"name":"Mother‚Äôs Bistro & Bar","address":"121 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Amazing food and definitely a great place to people watch!!

It should be the consistency of custard or a really good Greek yogurt.  In Greece, it is served on a plate, never a bowl. The moussaka was okay, but it was missing the bechamel sauce on top that makes moussaka so good and the potatoes were on the top instead of on the bottom where they would collect all the juices from the beef.

We went in on a Sunday around 3 with plans to lounge on the couches, enjoy some food, booze a bit and study on our laptops. Our first round of drinks came out after about 10 minutes, even with only 2 other tables in the whole place filled, and the calamari we ordered was decent. My boyfriend then ordered a 2nd drink. The main issue began when our entrees came. We felt as though the cobb salad that my boyfriend had ordered wasn't what he had intended it to be. For an almost $15 salad, there were oiled leaves surrounded by a few pieces of avocado on one side, some slices of bacon on the other, and a few slices of chicken that did NOT look good. By 'not good' I'm talking over-cooked dried out meat. My lean cuisine frozen lunches have better looking chicken than that. We were uncomfortable returning it (which we even told the waitress apologetically), but it was an unimpressive, unhappy looking salad and we didn't want to eat it. After we sent it back, the waitress brought it over to the bartender who began shooting us some rather unfriendly looks. No one came back to offer something alternative on the menu, or ask us any further about our issue. ALSO, we still hadn't gotten the drink my boyfriend ordered over 20 minutes before.  I had finished my meal when that drink finally came, WHICH we had watched as the bartender took the shaker he was making it with away from the bar and back into a separate room. (I don't want to sound paranoid, but how would you feel if you were being made uncomfortable by the staff then they go off to 'prepare' your drink in another room?!) My boyfriend thought it was a safer bet to not take a risk on the drink, but was going to pay for it none the less. Then our bill came, with the salad still on it... Yep. When asking to speak with a manager we got, you guessed it, THE BARTENDER! Apparently he's the owner's son. He arrogantly argued for over 10 minutes that in his opinion, there was nothing wrong with the salad. He told us he didn't care what my boyfriend's reasons were for sending it back, that it wasn't his problem. He then finished by saying there was no one else to talk to there, and if we didn't pay he would call the cops. We were pretty much in shock. It's not like we ate half of it then decided \\"nevermind\\". We didn't like the items, we sent it back right away and no staff approached us with any questions or alternative choices It's really crummy that manager is such a cocky a**hole.

To our great disappointment, the tamales did not taste anything like traditional Tex-Mex tamales we were accustomed to having.  The masa was much thicker than we had wanted and the filling was unlike anything we had previously experienced in a tamale.  Really tasted more like a jellied like substance.

My scramble was what I would normally consider to be a little undercooked from what I usually like but it was SO TASTY I didn't care. And you know what, I may like my eggs a little underdone now! There was a weird scuffle/shuffle when I was there because there was a couple trying to sit at the bar, and I was still enjoying my coffee but was almost done. Anyway, one of the couple came and sat in the seat next to me, but then #2 got a little antsy waiting for me to finish so she asked everyone to my left - and then me - to move one seat over. I don't know... Was that appropriate? Should I have been annoyed? I kind of wanted to get out of there by then anyway but there was something about it that kind of rubbed everyone the wrong way.

It used to be you would have been hard-pressed to get me to make a trip out here for a meal. Was not worth dealing with the touristy chaos.\\n\\nNot the case anymore. CowFish is an Orlando favorite of mine and after my recent trip to Toothsome, it joins my list of CityWalk restaurants I'm willing to make the trip for. Locals will have heard a lot of hype surrounding this new eatery and I can assure you, all of it is true.\\n\\nWhat's not to love? I'll start with the restaurant itself. It's just plain cool. Basically a steampunk version of Wonka's Chocolate Factory. Very cool decor. In the dining area there are large screens with simulated factory workings. And the staff is dressed to fit the theme as well. Just a very interesting and unique theme. We really enjoyed the vibe.\\n\\nSo, what about the food? First of all, if you don't order any of their appetizers that include the chocolate almond bread, I don't know what's wrong with you. I'm serious when I say you need this in your life. You can order it on its own but it also does come along with several of the apps, once being the baked Brie, which is what we ordered. A solid choice. I'm a lover of anything that involves Brie.\\n\\nMy boyfriend ordered a burger and he really, really enjoyed it. And he's picky when it comes to a good burger. I went with the superfoods salad. My goal was to keep it light so I had room for one of those glorious milkshakes. Priorities, right? I honestly didn't expect much from a salad at a place like this but I can tell you it was really very good as well.\\n\\nCan't forget the drinks. My boyfriend had a Chocolate Old Fashioned. Wow, you guys, was it good. And I hate whiskey. But let me tell you, I would drink this. We have plans to recreate this amazing beverage at home. Toothsome has a variety of really interesting sounding sweets-related drinks. One of these days I'd love to go back just for drinks. This time around I just opted for a glass of wine, again trying to keep it light so I had room for a milkshake.\\n\\nYes, the milkshakes. I'm sure you've seen the #foodporn shots on Insta. People have been posting these all over social. With good reason. They are certainly something to behold. It's worth noting there is a stand at the front of the restaurant where you can also order milkshakes and other sweet creations - you don't actually have to dine in the restaurant to get your hands on one of these bad boys. And that worked out well for us. My boyfriend, whose eyes are bigger than his stomach, didn't have room for a shake at the end of our meal but we certainly weren't leaving CityWalk without one. We had plans to see a movie so we swung by Toothsome again after the show to get our shake fix. We both ordered the Chocolate X5 shake. So. Much. Chocolate. It was amazing. I regret nothing. As hype up as these shakes were, it didn't disappoint one bit. I will 100% be back to try the others. Red Velvet is next.\\n\\nAs with most theme park restaurants, they do have a gift shop out front that sells some kitschy things. But some of their wares were actually really cool. There was a steampunk octopus liquor decanter I have every intention of going back to purchase for my boyfriend. You can also buy a variety of sweets, of course.\\n\\nI can honestly say there wasn't one thing we didn't like about this restaurant. The only trouble now will be deciding between CowFish and Toothsome when we dine in CityWalk from now on."},{"name":"New Ginza","address":"63-65 Galen St","city":"Watertown","stars":"3.5","text":"I have been to this place once per week for last few months and have been generally satisfied.

Much of the staff seem to be related - and if you go at an off time (like lunch on a Tuesday,) you will often hear them arguing with one another from the back room and basement. This sounds like a complaint, but, honestly, as an Italian American myself, it genuinely reminds me of some family gatherings - even though they are often hostile and verbally abusive towards one another, I can spot the underlying love which hides behind the fire-y Amer-Italian personalities. And what's better than being handed your take-out with a smile and a kind word immediately following a slew of abusive and hilarious Italian epithets? I feel like I'm in a beloved friend's dining room - it's worth it for the food and the entertainment - it's not a \\"yes sir, no mahm\\" kind of spot, but do you really want that kind of shit anyway? What is it, 1988? Nah... suck it up and be a modern, evolving human being. Appreciate another culture that isn't your nannie's family visiting from Guatemala...

All their cannolis are delicious and a long time ago I had the pleasure of seeing one of my best friends bite into one and literally had a food orgasm right in front of me. I prefer their Lobster Tail which is my favorite item to get here. Most everything else is good here as well like their chocolate cake, gelato, cookies, cupcakes, etc. Still cash only so make sure you have bills on you to pay.\\n\\nMy one gripe with this place is when people order their stuff at the counter in the signature Mike's Pastry box and then proceed to go sit down in the cafe area to eat their stuff. This never used to be the case because the cafe area is supposed to be for table service only and the staff used to really enforce this rule but nowadays it seems that has stopped so I do find it annoying when I want to sit at a table to order some pastries with some coffee or espresso but can't because some tourist family or couple decided to sit and eat their cannolis after ordering them at the counter.\\n\\nAs a resident of the North End now, I do prefer Maria's Pastry these days as my go-to spot to score an Italian pastry but ultimately there's nothing wrong with going to Mike's to say that you've gone here."},{"name":"Zaftigs Delicatessen - Brookline","address":"335 Harvard St","city":"Brookline","stars":"4","text":"This place is fantastic!!!

Chills run down your neck. What better way to warm up the soul is a good hot pot place. I heard of this restaurant from Sing Tao newspaper and word of mouth. A supposed divine place with delicious AYCE mutton and fresh ingredients. I have been to a few AYCE hotpots so my expectations is a little higher than the norm. First off, the soup base is important. The price is slightly higher than most places I been in. At $9.99, I expected something that would compensate for the cost. I picked the meat bone soup. It had a bit of cow meat bone in it. This deserves a 4 star. Now with the ingredients, I ordered the usual sliced meats, tong ho veggies, some wontons, mussels/squid (only fresh seafood there), quail eggs (normally not seen in most ayce menus), fish/squid balls as a start. I also ordered plum drink (refillable). Its a good drink especially when eating hotpot. It helps offsets the harmful effects of spicy food and hotpot. They also have a self serve dipping station. Bonus! I can have as much satay and peanut sauce. Now we wait.... 20 minutes later, nothing yet.. not even the soup. Then the table beside us (seated 15 minutes after we were seated) got their soup first. WTF? And we got our soup next. Okay.. maybe because of a busy restaurant and a full house tonight, its taking longer than normal. I wouldn't hold it against them. As the food started to arrive at a decent time. What I wanted was my plum drink. I asked the waitress for it and they keep telling me its coming. Well 1.5 hour later, I am full from eating and drinking the soup. But alas no plum drink. Okay I am still fine.. plum drink didn't come even though everyone table beside me got theirs. Its not a big deal. I just hope they don't charge me for it. When it came to the bill, lo and behold, what do I see? They did indeed charge me for the plum drink, the plum drink that never came. I complained of course, the lady didn't seem to believe me until I told her.. she eventually believed me. What lousy service! You just lost 2 stars there.

Well, before sticking your nose up at a non-local, keep in mind that the person holding the container heroically waited on a lengthy line just to place an order for the delectable Italian goodies.

Unfortunately, the hungry mob obscured my full view of the 5 or so huge display cases, but, since I had been there several times before, I had a set goal in mind - obtaining cannolis and brownies were musts.  \\n\\nThe Peanut Butter Brownie was as dense as fudge and was topped with a layer peanut butter-infused fudge frosting.  The Regular Brownie was more like a rich chocolate cake, but was covered in the same sugary chocolate frosting.  These were hands down two of the best brownies I have ever had.\\n\\nThe Pistaccio Cannoli had a perfectly cooked shell, but its cream filling was bland.  I also found that the chopped nuts did not provide the same sort of satisfaction that the standard chocolate chips did. \\n\\nLastly, the massive Eclair was stuffed with a sweet custard.  The dough was moist, mushy, and not overly fried.  A swipe of hard chocolate frosting lay across the top, but its dry quality pulled the decoration right off with the first bite. \\n\\nMike's Pastry is an elaborate Italian bakery that is worth at least one visit as a tourist or an occasional indulgent treat as a local.

But she shouldn't really let that affect our experience - right?  \\n\\nAnyway, she brought our drinks and a little while later our food came out.  She came by to check on things as we started to eat and asked if we needed anything else.
