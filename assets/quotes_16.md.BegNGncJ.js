The outdoor patio is also appealing in warm weather. What looks good on the surface, however, is a far cry from the reality underneath. The food is mediocre at best. The salad greens were tired, their dressing bland. Salmon was bone-dry and flavorless, its only saving grace the large capers with it. They inexplicably had run out of bread, in an area spittin' distance from some of the best bakeries in the city. Service was excrutiatingly slow and inattentive; it took three requests before water glasses were refilled.

This restaurant is all about location, being right in the center of Harvard square, but SADLY it's the only thing it still exists. While clearly thriving on tourist money judging by the groups of uniformed people, the owner (or the guy in the front) carried on this air that he disdains tourists, especially mainland chinese i suspect. the lunch orders were standard american chinese lunch fare, with a touch of szhchuan and hunan flavor. Of the five dishes none really stood out, actually they all tasted and looked exactly the same, as if the same sauce were used on all. the waitress kept on spilling drinks on us, and had to come back to clean it. the owner were not all that pleased with her. He asked my friend a couple of time to move her chair around so that others can squeeze by. At the end of the meal, we couldn't wait to leave. The food was probably the worst i had in any Boston area Chinese establishments, albeit one as long standing as Yenching. \\n\\nThe owner put a 18% tip on the lunch bill for the 3 of us. I am just appalled. It's not that I cannot calculate my own tip 15% for a bad service.

I came to Dosa-n-Curry because of the Groupon and because I pass it every week on my pilgrimage to Market Basket.   \\nMy dining partner and I ordered the idlis+sambar appetizer, paper masala dosa, aloo naan, bhindi masala, and rice pudding.  (Including groupon, tax and tip, I paid $24).\\n\\n1) Idlis + sambar: Idlis are steamed rice+lentil cakes.  Their sponginess is nice to absorb the flavors of the sambar (spicy tomato-based lentil-veggie soup) and chutney (coconut and another - possibly tomato).  I think people admire very fluffy idlis, and although these were not insanely fluffy, they were fluffy enough and tasted good.  The sambar had just the right balance of vegetable-flavors, hints of sourness, and spiciness (at least spicy for a broad palate - I prefer mine spicier but they're running a business).  The coconut chutney also hit all the necessary notes, but there was something missing that I couldn't put my finger on (perhaps I prefer mine less smooth so there's more texture).  This dish was substantial and I think this appetizer plate would be a satisfying lunch.  \\n\\n2) Paper masala dosa: These were HUGE.  Imagine a 4 foot long rolled up crepe. It was thin, crispy, and even colored, and you can easily taste the slight sourness which was nice.  It was accompanied with a potato masala, along with the two chutneys from the idlis and a bowl of sambar.  The potato masala was good - not over cooked, well spiced and reasonable in quantity. Only quibble was that the the oil-to-dosa ratio is a hint above my liking, but that's what you get with paper dosas.  This was not dosa-n-curry's fault.\\n\\n3) Aloo naan: It was large, warm, stuffed with flavorful potato filling, and good.  The only caveat was that it seemed a touch oily when it came out. Maybe if they dimmed the lights some more it wouldn't have bothered me as much.  But between the potato and the oil, it was pretty filling.  \\n\\n4) Bhindi masala: This okra dish was fine.  The dish might need a bit of stirring before serving, as the bottom was oilier and the top had the cilantro.  We ordered the mild and it was neither spicy nor devoid of flavor.  \\n\\n5) Rice pudding: I haven't eaten this yet.  We were too full so just got it to go.  \\n\\nService/Ambience: The staff were friendly, and the food was prompt.  They were pretty cool about being willing to let us use the groupon to order something besides the dosa or curry listed in the fine print; they said it would have been fine to order a House Special or an Uthappam.  They had fine leftovers packaging (although I encourage them to move away from styrofoam) and clean bathrooms. \\n\\nAll in all, I wasn't blown away, but I was spoiled growing up as far as South Indian food goes.  Dosa-n-Curry was a really good meal.  I look forward to going back."},{"name":"Anh Hong","address":"291 Adams St","city":"Dorchester","stars":"4","text":"I don't get the other posts and reviews.

So glad he made that decision (completely at his own will) because they were fluffy and delicious. My cousin ordered the biscuits and gravy.

I would says it's Titanic meets nursing home.  The place is interestingly eclectic but in an old school, victorian way.  They have decorations and chachkees you may find in your grandmother's attic--brass lamps, antique fixtures, older pictures, but paired with the smell of moth balls and a musty smell.  Everyone in the restaurant was definitely 70+ and definitely had some patrons with conservative views, which I couldn't help overhearing as the group next to us were all wearing hearing devices and yelling their conservative political opinions and discussing the demise of our country.  Not really a meal breaker, but definitely affected the experience.  The food on the other hand was better than expected.  My dining parter and I both got steak (filet mignon and beef tenderloin) which were tender and juicy, although they were both smothered in a disgusting yellow and brown liquid they claimed to call bordelaise and b√©arnaise sauce.  The bordelaise sauce tasted like they had mixed powdered gravy mix with water, and the b√©arnaise had no flavor.  Scraping the sauce aside, the steak itself was great.  The vegetables on the other hand were worse than high school cafeteria food.  They were steamed to a point of mush, and had no seasoning what so ever----bland, bland, bland.

The location is great: situated besides the river with a small vegetable garden (heirloom tomatoes, okra, carrots, squash...) and a sizable garden to walk through, this isn't a place to just eat and leave. And walking was necessary after noshing through the appetizer, entree, and dessert. Here's a rundown:\\n\\nAppetizer: Mussels in curry-like, lemongrass broth. I like mussels, so I'm already biased. But I liked the suggestion from the server: dip your sourdough bread into the broth - it's like a meal on it's own!\\n \\nEntree:  Australian lamb. Wow. This may have been the first time I've had lamb cooked medium-rare and I do not regret it. Not funky like lamb can sometimes taste, the outside was seared until crunchy and the inside was soo tender. I ate a chunk of fat and did not gag. Yummy. Served on a bed of risotto (double yum) with a tart-ish dressing. I could've done without the capers, but that's my only complaint. \\n\\nSide note: Heirloom tomatoes were extremely flavorful. Not on my dish, but recommended. \\n\\nDessert: Semifreddo of blueberry sorbet, sweetened yogurt served with lavender sauce. I was hesitant about this dessert, but this sounded like the lightest thing on the menu. The syrup smelled so nicely of lavender that I wanted to bottle it up and sniff it all the way home. The greek yogurt was so delicious and it paired well with the sorbet (and I'm not normally a fan of sorbet). It was sizable enough to share.

We tried the pizza and pasta. I like that you can select your toppings but they don't put very much on the pizza. They have a small scoop for each tipping and that's pretty much all they put on it. With your pizza you are allowed 4 toppings and then each additional topping is $1.00.  I think they made a mistake because she counted the cheese as one topping.  I asked for arugula and she said they would put it on after the pizza was done. They were a little confused where the pizza's came out, not sure who's was who's. They did kind of all look the same :). They forgot to add the arugula and when I returned to have them add it I'm pretty sure he grabbed 3 leaves and tore them into small pieces. I saw a picture of a pizza piled high with arugula but it must have been a dream or really, just a picture. The pasta is very similar to another place but a much smaller portion. Although the menu didn't list that the toppings were limited they still used the tiny little scoops.  The whole bowl was maybe a little more than 1/2 full. The pasta definitely didn't fill us up. The pizza was great. The sauce is the kind I like, not sweet and the dough was chewy, my favorite. I was pretty amazed at how quickly the pizza was done. I ordered 2 pizzas and 1 pasta bowl and the first pizza was already done when I reached the cashier.   Then I wondered why all other pizza places take 30 minutes.

That was a complete joke. Every single employee/chef was definitely 100% not Japanese. Not a totally bad thing because sushi at the end of the day shouldn't be restricted to race, but there is a consistent trend in the quality of the sushi/japanese dishes that are made and served by nonJapanese folk. that is, the quality of the food is lower. sushi preparation and execution that leads to a worthy experience requires certain personal traits that are in a way natural to Japanese people. there is good sushi joints run by foreigners in this world, but oga's follows the trend of lower quality food. \\n\\nthe sushi chefs claimed that most of their ingredients come straight from Japan weekly and that they do a lot of difficult prep work in their kitchen. I don't doubt this, but the taste is just mediocre. sure, Japanese fish and home prep are impressive for Boston, but it does not guarantee quality and taste. I'd personally rather have local/\\"less fancy\\" ingredients with better care, skill, and execution. for instance, they said that they get their anago (sea eel) from abroad and then prep the eel completely themselves (process almost unreal in Boston area), but the taste of the anago sushi was disappointing. another example was i ordered chawanmushi. it is a fairly difficult dish to make well. it was done horribly and the bar chefs noticed immediately. sent it back and it came back even worse. lol kind of funny because the chefs were very embarrassing. they are very nice there though... I couldn't be mad. it is what it is. they're simply not very good at executing dishes that require a little bit more skill. but, since the Boston area is so limited for sushi options, Oga's is not a terrible choice, even though it's all the way out in Natick. pretty nice, clean interior. good service, reasonable prices. the place is not bad, but not very good."},{"name":"Versalles Cafe","address":"9036 S Orange Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Best Cuban sandwich I've ever had.

Burgerville doesn't seem to understand that they can offer healthier choices that still taste good.  The chicken breast was grilled plain, unseasoned completely and looked more like it was boiled and had those fake grill marks on it.  The BBQ sauce was bland and runny.  Is it too much to ask for a little seasoning?\\n\\nI decided to go against my better judgement and ordered the Chocolate Monkey shake.  Apple juice in a chocolate/banana milkshake?  That can't be good, but I'll trust the powers that be and try it anyway.  Turns out I was right.  The apple juice just turned the shake  sour.

The last thing I expect from a dish of Mediterranean grilled meat is juiciness, but Chicken Kebob definitely delivered on this front. The chicken and lamb shish were grilled to perfection, with a juicy center and pink interior respectively. The gyro had a nice char while retaining its chewy tenderness. The grilled vegetables deserve a special mention too for cutting the richness of the dish with crunch and slight acidity. Every single element on the dish was executed with finesse, which is something I rarely see in dishes that cost twice or even three times the price nowadays...\\n\\nThey have a large selection of desserts including the well known bak lava.

I had the crispy salmon that was cooked to perfection with a tomatillo salsa on the side a salad of tomato wedges with lump crab, arugula, watercress and whatever.  It was all crazy good.  The dinner prices are ridiculously reasonable for food prepared this remarkably.  And for a restaurant this large, the wait for our meal was remarkably, no really, remarkably short.  There is a reason you cannot find a parking space here and I salute this restaurant for not raising it's prices to what the quality of this food and service could demand.  \\n\\nSecond night, same song second verse.  Amazing consistency.  And get this.  Last night our server gave us one of the most detailed explanations of how the dishes we were considering are prepared, that I have ever heard.  When she left my wife and I looked at one another and said, \\"Whoa, that was amazing!\\".  Tonight, different server, same story. You would think you were talking to the chef.  Were these two servers just that interested in the food, or does this restaurant educate them that well?  I dunno but it is hugely impressive.  \\n\\nAnd the servers are remarkably attentive but not intrusive.  I saw our server look to our table numerous time during the course of our meal.

I read bad reviews so now I just have a negative mood about the experience I haven't quite had yet. Well, we sat at our table when the rest of our party showed up and put in our drink order. The drinks came quickly and we placed our order. They gave us each a packaged wet napkin to clean our hands which was dripping wet when I opened it and smelled disgusting!!! I couldn't get over how badly it made my hands smell so I went to the bathroom to wash my hands! I couldn't help but notice that the grill was not clean at all. I was assured that the grill would be cleaned before and after our meal. The chef came out quickly and was friendly but seemed nervous and quiet.  As he pulled out his spatulas to twirl around we noticed a black thing fall from it and onto the grill. I leaned in to see if it was a bug and another person pointed it out asking him to clean the grill. I am not sure if it was a bug but that's what it looked like. My husband tried to calm me down but I was nervous. I only ordered fried rice and sweet potato maki since I was afraid to eat any of the meat here and I am extremely allergic to shellfish. The rice was just okay, and the sweet potato maki was decent. Everyone else seemed to enjoy their food and ha no complaints. After our chef left and we were about to leave I leaned over and took a peak at the floor in between the grills. I was absolutely disgusted and was surprised I didn't throw up right there, not that they'd clean it anyway because it looked as though it's never been cleaned. The floor was covered in old rotten food, new food and DEAD BUGS. Everywhere. I'm telling you people, I can only imagine what the friggin kitchen looks like. As we walked out I noticed that the dining room seemed to have filled up a little more and wondered if I was the only person to notice the disgusting grill and floor. I went home imagining the chefs in the kitchen swatting away cockroaches off the food. (I have a pretty good imagination.) \\n\\nSUMMARY: This place is a health hazard and I can't believe it's still running. It's FILTHY.

I just had a wonderful meal here with my mom and dad. Food, ambiance, service, price - all was fantastic. \\n\\nI had the hanger steak and fingerling potatoes - the steak was cooked to perfection. Potatoes were splendid, and the green salad (with adorable haricot verts!) that accompanied it was dressed just right.\\n\\nMy dad had the cod with corn and crepes - EVERYBODY should eat this dish at least once in their life. Honestly, the dish is brilliant. The corn ... there are no words.\\n\\nMy mom had one of the special entrees of the evening - steel head trout with a crab meat and corn salsa and wilted spinach.  Colorful, fresh, and the best part was that the fish wasn't over-dressed.\\n\\nWe shared raw bar to start - some of the best oysters I've had in a while - as well as a roasted beet salad, and pork rillettes (you only live once, right?) The rilletes was great - a coarser, looser version of the dish than I'm used to, but I liked the way you really got the texture of the pork from the larger pieces, and despite the fact that I know the dish is 85% fat it didn't actually seem too heavy. \\n\\nAlso present at the table were a green salad (in a damn near perfect vinaigrette) and the tomato and fennel soup, which was delicious save for a slight over-peppering on the part of the chef. We mentioned this, and the soups were generously comped from our meal, even though we had them boxed up and totally plan to eat them for lunch tomorrow.\\n\\nOur waiter Jared was helpful, friendly, knowledgeable, and hung out for just the right amount of chit chat when he delivered each course. We also got some excellent recommendations on wine, and a lovely visit from the manager at the end of our meal.

Sushi there is pretty decent too, so I'll switch between that and hibachi when I go.  The hibachi show is pretty typical, nothing spectacular or unexpected.

Three of us arrived right on time (6:25) and were the first people there, so we went to check in. The hostesses were rude to us right off the bat (would a smile, or common decency, kill you? I thought it was your job to be welcoming?); upon us saying we were the first to arrive and just wanted to check in, they told us that if our entire party didn't show up soon, they'd give up our table. Way to be a giant b*itch to us after we were polite as heck to you, kool. (And it wasn't even 6:30 yet.) Strike 1.\\n\\nAs people trickled in (everyone was there by about 6:45), we realized there was a last-minute addition to our party and we would now need a table for 16. After telling this to the hostesses, they freaked out on us; said a table for 15 would not fit 16, that we could not squish, that they would be giving our reservation away and we'd have to put our names back in, and we would need to break up our party into two groups for two separate tables, and we'd have to wait about 20 minutes. All in an extremely rude and abrasive way, mind you. \\n\\nAt this point, we should have left, but there were 16 of us and Bisuteki is sort of in the middle of nowhere, so just trying to find a place that accommodated that number of people on a Saturday night, never mind getting the whole group over to that place, wasn't really worth it, so we decided to stay and wait, and went upstairs to the hotel bar to have a drink.\\n\\nFlash forward to about 7:45, after multiple \\"20 more minutes/5 more minutes\\" (lies!), and a group member even defecting from our party and skipping dinner because she had somewhere to be (that she could have gotten to if we had sat at 6:30 like we were supposed to) thereby bringing our table back to 15 (too late), and we get seated (at a 16-person table, not 2 8-tops), with only a cursory \\"sorry\\". Lady, I've worked in food service, and while I understand you don't have control over what tables you have available, you sure as hell have control over your words and actions (and tone of voice). NOT APPRECIATED.\\n\\nOn to the food: I'm a sucker for hibachi so was pretty excited about this meal, preliminary rudeness notwithstanding. Our table had 2 chefs, one of which was a bit more animated than the other, both of which seemed more reserved compared to the other crazy chefs in the restaurant (or others I've seen in the past) and barely did any cool tricks (I'm pretty sure the onion volcano singed our chef's eyebrows, oops), but who both did an OK job entertaining and an excellent job with the food IMO.\\n\\nI had the hibachi salmon dinner ($19.99 all inclusive, a great deal), which comes with the usual onion soup/ginger salad/3 shrimp app/rice (I got fried)/veggies, and my 2 giant fillets were cooked perfectly, not to mention the shrimp and fried rice, it was delicious (and the soup/salad/veggies were good as well). I love the dipping sauces they give you, although you didn't necessarily need them because things were flavorful enough on their own... man that was some tasty stuff, I'd go back anytime just for the food. Everyone else was really satisfied as well, with almost all of us getting a full hibachi dinner of some kind (chicken, steak, shrimp, scallops, combos, etc), and the odd man out getting some uber-fresh sushi to munch on. Portions were huge, most of us rolled out of there in food comas (especially those who ordered themselves extra apps and/or fried ice cream for dessert), and there was a large menu selection of not only hibachi dinner options but other typical Asian fare as well.\\n\\nAside from that, we had a flaming drink (cool to look at, tasted like a typical scorpion bowl), and because it was a birthday celebration for both myself and my friend, they brought out cheesecake for the both of us and sang us Happy B-day using a gong (our friend even got to use the gong). Service was a bit slow in the beginning getting everyone's various drinks with some waters forgotten, but after that the waitresses were pretty on-top of things.\\n\\nIt's a bummer this is the only hibachi place of its kind within the Boston area, so those of us sans cars don't have much of a choice. If you do have a car, head to Hibachi Steak House in Norwood, it's *much* better. But if you're going to Bisuteki, know that things can be very inconsistent, and steel yourself to deal with all the crap before you can enjoy a decent meal."},{"name":"Mario's Italian Restaurant","address":"1733 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Lexington","stars":"4","text":"Its cheap, but you can taste the cheapness.

Pretty easy to locate and you need to find street parking.\\n\\nService: they were friendly, no complaints\\n\\nFood:\\n1. Broad street bomber: I was happy to see that they named the cheesesteak after an actual street in philly and then they informed me that the owner was from philly as well!  I've tried many cheesesteaks and even had my favorite (Jim's cheesesteak in philly).  SO..this is nothing compared to that... however, we are in the northwest, so I will be nicer as I rate them.  As unhealthy as it sounds, the typical cheesesteak has cheese wiz in it. So you can see how I was disappointed that their sandwich was provolone cheese instead of wiz.  it is actually looked down upon if you ordered provolone cheese in your cheesesteak in philly.  Aside from that, the hoagie was good, the meat was cooked right with the right amount of oil and it was a huge portion where you can share with another person. So it was good but not comparable. \\n\\n2. We also ate this one cold sandwich that was a salad.  I forgot the name but it was a special and it was not good.  We were thinking that it was an actual salad until we got our order.  It was not memorable and it was our misunderstanding so I didn't base the ratings on this sandwich.  \\n\\nOverall: There's no place like this in portland that has philly cheesesteaks so,  I would give this place another chance.  However, if youre going to name a cheesesteak after a street in philly, i think it deserves the option of wiz so it can be more authentic."},{"name":"Merguez Restaurant","address":"11951 International Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Amazing service, great food and atmosphere!

My parents are visiting from out of town, and I was so excited to take them to see you. Why did you let me down?\\n\\nWe had reservations for tonight (a Saturday) at 8:00 PM. They were completely slammed, and our table wasn't ready right away. That was fine. We walked out back to the river bar and got some drinks. My parents really enjoyed looking at the river.\\n\\nSo we get to the table a little after eight. The service was rushed and slow at the same time. Every single step of the meal took forever. We waited ages for water. Ages for our waiter to take our appetizer order. Ages and ages for him to come back and take our entr√©e order. Excruciatingly long for the food to arrive... just sooo much waiting! By the time he came back to ask if we wanted dessert, I was ready to bolt. Then he made us wait even further because he didn't pay attention to our response, which was that we didn't want dessert. He brought us menus anyway and darted off, so we waited even MORE for him to come back so we could get the check!\\n\\nI feel so conflicted. On the one hand, it's not our waiter's fault the place was crowded. I really do think he was doing his best and he was just overwhelmed. Maybe someone called out sick? Who knows. But in the end it is my experience which matters most. And I was most displeased. \\n\\nEveryone except me loved their food, so that was the saving grace.

This location is hit or miss.  Starting out they seemed to be unprepared and unorganized when they first opened. Now, months later, they still don't have their act together and up to the standards of the Anderson lane branch. They never have a consistent amount of cilantro, jalape√±os, limes, and green onions out. It's kind of a toss up on whether you get basil. If you do, it's maybe like three little leaves.  There weren't any plastic containers out for side items. Only lids. The staff seems to change often. On several occasions Ive tried to call in my order with only ringing and no answer.  Consistency is the biggest problem. My order yesterday and today (yes I love pho that much) was pretty much the same, veggie pho, but I get home only to find the tofu completely missing today. The young lady at the register seemed uninterested in taking direction from her manager and uninterested in working in general. The young lady told me there was no more pork, oxtail, and they were out of limeade.  I tried to use a coupon and the young lady called the manager who was very nice and helpful and you could tell was working very hard trying to run the store. The manager under her breath told the young lady to go and make some more limeade. The young lady slowly walked to the back and then came back out sans any evidence she even heard or cared what her manager told her to do. The poor manager was sweating like crazy working in the kitchen and had to go to the back to reset the register system to enter the coupon. The location always appears to be low on supplies and seems unorganized and messy behind the counter. I love the veggie pho and filet mignon pho so much that I will continue coming here. But come on owners... Get a better register system, make sure you get them some kind of AC unit so they aren't dripping sweat in the kitchen, hire better employees behind the register, get a better consistent practice of answering phones and taking phone orders, make sure you figure out how to have your products available at all times, and be consistent with ingredients and amounts in your to go orders.

Now, the goal here as we understood it from Thuy, is food prepared in its truest form and locally sourced, aside from just a few exceptions. Thus, there are no gluten-free items, no milk substitutes, and the like. Also, don't expect Tito's Vodka as some ingredients are sourced other than from Austin. As I have no challenges here, I was fine. My business partner had a few food allergies but was still able to find delectable menu selections. \\n\\nMy choice was the Pastrami Sandwich without the cheese, as I don't care for melted cheese and the Chicken Cobb Salad. Each was divine and quite filling. The price point is what would be expected for a restaurant offering fresh meats butchered in house. \\n\\nOur meal and the service were delightful. When in the neighborhood again, we'd certainly eat here again."},{"name":"Flying Saucer Draught Emporium","address":"815 W 47th St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Very good experience.

My first visit left me with a bad impression of the establishment's service. Having worked in restaurants before, this meant a lot to me. However, the owner took the time to personally follow up with me and ensure that my next visit would be a great experience. Today, I left with a completely different outlook.\\n\\nMy friend and I arrived just before noon and the restaurant was already packed with the brunch rush, but that did not take away from the high-quality service we received. Once we were seated outside, the manager came out and introduced himself and made sure that we had everything we needed. He proceeded to check on us throughout our meal even with the busy atmosphere, which I really appreciated. Our server also checked on us often. We ordered some food (I had the Steak, Eggs & Fries special which was delicious!) and two Manmosas (those things are serious!) There was a live band playing some fun cover songs and the whole atmosphere was a reflection of the way Sundays in Austin generally feel; lively and joyful. \\n\\nI really felt taken care of today and cannot thank the owner and manager enough for the accommodations made. The way in which any business responds to a situation speaks volumes about the service, and is more important than the issue itself. It is clear to me that Banger's works hard to uphold excellent customer service. I will definitely be returning for brunch in the near future! I highly recommend Banger's and I would say to arrive before 11am, if not right when they open at 10am, to avoid a long wait because the place is popular! They are even constructing an extension of the restaurant, so you know it's hopping!\\n\\nThank you Ben and Alex!!!\\n\\n*\\n*\\n*\\n*\\n*\\n\\n1/21/18\\nI went to Banger's today for the first time and to say that I left disappointed and taken aback with the level of customer service, is a total understatement. I had never been to Rainey Street before and chose to make Banger's the first stop to try out their popular \\"Manmosa\\". \\n\\nMy friend and I went up to the bar to order the drinks and then sit at a table, as the host said we could do. When I asked the bartender (I wish I had asked his name) for two Manmosas he said that we had to get an entree in order to have them. We were stuffed from food we had just eaten, but I was willing to order an entree just so that I could have the drink. I started reading the menu and a few moments later the bartender said \\"Oh and we're out of table numbers so you actually can't even order food and can't have a Manmosa.\\" I looked at him, shocked, and asked \\"We can't buy a Manmosa just because you're out of table numbers?\\" to which he replied WITH A SMILE \\"Yeah that's just how we do it here and there's nothing I can do about it!\\" \\n\\nAt that point I almost lost it! Not so much because we couldn't order the one thing we went there for after waiting in the line for so long simply because the restaurant was out of table numbers (which was not our fault or problem), but because of how unprofessional the bartender was! What kind of customer service is that?? I have worked in several restaurants and I would never deliver information in that manner, nor would I be so short and unaccommodating with a guest, no matter how challenging the situation. Unreal. So as not to ruin what was supposed to be an enjoyable afternoon, I did not call him out on his unprofessionalism and lack of tact. We ordered two regular mimosas and sat outside to listen to the band.\\n\\nI really wanted to like Banger's and recommend it to friends and newcomers to Austin, but after that experience I do not plan on returning."},{"name":"Jack Allen's Kitchen Oak Hill","address":"7720 Hwy 71 W","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"It is a bit out of the way for most Austin people but unlike other reviewers, we found it right away. JAK is a large restaurant (with a large parking lot), which serves slightly refined, locally sourced American cuisine. We were greeted warmly by the host staff, and, expecting a long wait on a Saturday night, were pleasantly surprised when a booth became available after 10 minutes. Once seated, they offer a delicious homemade pimiento cheese on flatbread crackers (also available on the menu \\"in case you didn't get enough\\"). We shared chips 'n' salsa--the salsa is house made and is one of the best I've ever tasted. That good. You can take home a Mason jar of it for four bucks. The chips were thick with a strong flavor of corn. The adult drink menu is extensive. Though not listed on the menu, Mrs U ordered a caipirinha--a Brazilian cocktail made with cacha√ßa (similar to rum), sugar and lime. \\n\\nAfter reading that the appetizers are not to be missed, Mrs U opted for the spinach walnut gorgonzola ravioli appetizer as a main course. Very hearty: it has about ten ravioli and three slices of toasted ciabatta. When dining at a new restaurant, I always look for the \\"thing in the box\\" (what they are best known for). I thought it a good sign that JAK has its own category for \\"Chicken Fried Anything,\\" so I chose chicken fried steak and was not disappointed. JAK's portions are large, and mine had sides of gravy, chunky mashed red potatoes (\\"smashers\\"), and vegetables. Great flavor, if a bit too salty. The wait staff was on the ball, friendly and helpful. Alas, I cannot comment on the desserts as we could not save room.

They are definitely working out some kinks in understanding the neighborhood and their menu and prices but it's getting there. They gave us two free entrees and that was nice. However for a family of five (one is a baby) the bill was still over $200 with tip. I also tipped 20 percent the actual bill not the reduced. The waiter Alex was awesome. They seem to be struggling from an identity crisis and overcharge a bit but the food is good too. The food is a mix of seafood, Asian, Mexican, and high end steakhouse. Quality is high. I had the vegetable dish and it was pretty epic. Bok Choy was grilled perfect. I generally hate seaweed but loved the seaweed salad. I think the dressing made it. Appetizer choices were thin and pretty specific. Dessert has fun stuff like their signature s'mores sundae and I had sorbet. All very good. My husband said the burger that he stole part of from\\nMy stepdaughter was epic. However after dining about two weeks passed and we got a call from marketing about how dinner was and I was really honest. They were super receptive and even gave me their number in case I wanted to talk more. This is what restaurants should do. It will make a huge difference. Tons of respect. I will go back maybe when they have a kids menu and some lower cost entrees. For now stick to roof top drinks and lunch and the ice cream window.

Way past the little ones bedtime and now it is starting to drizzle. We had to leave after waiting over an hour.

After we mentioned the problem, it was remedied with a smarter solution. \\nWe ordered dinner and I got the market price fish sandwich. It was grouper so I was definitely excited! It took a while for food to come out considering how few people were there but it really didn't bother me. \\nWhen dinner came, I received about a 3-4 ounce cut of fish in my sandwich. Seriously. I couldn't even taste it considering the amount of bread of toppings on there. Very disappointing. Now I could have sent it back and had them correct it but by this point, we were ready to get out of this place. What changed? At roughly 8pm, the music changed to rap and dance music and we had to scream at each because it was soooo LOUD. Now before you assume... Oh, he's just an old fart and I'm sure it wasn't that loud... I challenge you to check it out for yourself. It went from a restaurant to night club in a matter of minutes. We made jokes about the volume with the waitress a few times but it didn't make a difference. Was this just a Saturday night thing? Don't know. Not sure I'll be going back anytime soon though. Can't imagine it'll survive as a foodie hotspot for long with this formula but maybe sunny day lunches are a better time to visit. I hate to write negative reviews but figured someone might want to know.

There are a few meat and fish purveyors, but mostly this is a prepared food and specialty food market:  barbecue, Indian, sushi, pho, Italian, deli sandwiches, crepes & Belgian waffles; several vendors of baked goods such as pretzels, doughnuts, and various traditional bakery fare; popcorn, cheese, ice cream (save for listeria weekends); coffee, tea, beer...whew.  I could spend all day.  Roll me out of here!\\n\\nOn a Sunday, all of the vendors are supposed to open by 10, but that wasn't observed on the day of my visit.  Most were open before 10, but a few were either still shuttered outright or open but offering minimal goods for a while.

We were lucky to beat the rush as our arrival time was close to opening, and seated quickly.  This place is a cute restaurant for couples or small groups but from what I could tell they only had one really large booth for larger parties.  I liked the blue and wood theme throughout the restaurant and the natural lighting and the cute decorations of dried herbs and flower arrangements on each table.\\n\\nP(B)iscuits and Gravy with Chicken Fried Elk (5/5) OMG this was so freaking good, first off I love chicken fried chicken so in Elk form I had to try!  I would say definitely more gamey but I like gamey, perfectly battered and fried, and a bit on the thinner side, but that just means I get to chew less...I love how it was paired with 2 biscuits, as they were top notch, the outside was super crispy but when you bit in it was nice and flaky and buttery just how it should be!  The only thing I would do next time is to ask for EXTRA gravy but it was finger licking good and I didn't have enough.\\n\\nMcGroover toasted pancake sandwich with venison breakfast sausage, scrambled eggs, cheese and cane syrup (3.5/5)  The best way to describe this is a super fancy McGriddle... I was actually not a super big fan of the pancake as I guess I was too enthralled with the piscuit and gravy that it got kinda cold and was a bit on the chewier side more like a hamburger bun, but I really liked how they did their egg, as it was super puffy and thick but still airy with a nice crispy edge around it, yums!  The Venison breakfast sausage was definitely more gamy and lean but seasoned well and paired well with the cane syrup, this stuff was super sweet so you really didn't have to use a lot.\\n\\nOverall, I thoroughly enjoyed my brunch experience as I love the concept of local, sustainable, farm to table food, and just how delicious they make it!  I can't wait to try more of their foods, and will definitely be back to hopefully try one of their rotating themed menus/tastings!

The server told me that they would only charge me for pecans in one pancake due to their error, but when I checked out, they charged me for all 3.  I pointed out their mistake, but the guy who cashed me out started to whine about how expensive pecans are, and I was not going to argue about a few pecans, as life is too short...I am just not going to ever return to Cafe Java.

The pancakes were on par with Aunt Jemima's complete pancake mix where you just add water, and the hashbrowns were very bland.

Price points were a little high for the portion size.  Paying $16 for a smallish bowl of pasta with no meat seems silly to me.\\n\\nI've seen many reviews criticize the service, and I admit it was quite slow and our server was at best indifferent.  I think the fact that we had 9 people and were engaged in our own conversations helped blunt this, but if I were there 1 on 1 the service would likely seem excruciatingly slow.

Everything that I order is SO good. I can't get enough of it. I love the menu because they are not afraid to keep it authentic and they show you a different side of Asian cuisine. You won't find any of your usual take out classics; instead they open the door for all these amazing flavors and traditional recipes that sometimes you don't quite see in the US. All of their soups are amazing. Everybody's right with the Roti Canai. Order it. Yeah, it is small. Order another. The skewers are great and have the best charcoal smoky flavor. The duck and the char-siu pork are phenomenal. They usually have great beers on rotation and have happy hours featuring a couple of craft beer and small dishes for cheap!

I didn't get that far because the service was the worst I have ever experienced in my life (keeping in mind that I go to every new restaurant in the city and usually have a great experience). Food and staff etiquette combined, I give this place a 2. From the second we walked into this place, we felt a vibe as if the STAFF was doing US a favor by feeding us, not us going there to give them business. Starting it all off was the hostess. Given the empty restaurant, the hostess made us feel like she was trying to squeeze us into her empty restaurant and it was extremely inconvenient to seat a party of 7. Next was another hostess that was helping our waiter serve champagne since we were celebrating an engagement. She spilled 3 champagne glasses onto our friend that just got engaged. Granted she brought back full glasses to try to make up for it, but she didn't even utter a genuine apology. Full glasses don't make up for something you don't apologize for. To top it all off, we asked our waiter for extra bread for our cheese plate and received a condescending response (again) to make us feel like we were causing a huge inconvenience to them. He said, \\"I will have to go all the way down to the basement and across to the other side. I'll work on it.\\" We brushed it off and said okay, thank you. Waited about 20 minutes and it still never came. When he came back we hinted again politely, \\"Hey man, I think we're still waiting on some extra bread...\\" We received the same condescending response from him as before. That did it. After all of the \\"inconvenience\\" we caused and the condescending mannerism of all the staff, we had it and decided to go somewhere else to have dinner. We complained to the manager. Our waiter approached our table again questioning why we complained to the manager - WHY would you confront your table?! That is just plain WRONG! After all of this, we were told that our entire meal was comped. We finished up and started to exit the restaurant, but then the waiter approached us again and said I'm charging you for drinks. That was fine, but then he snatched our cards as we were standing in a doorway between the restaurant and the outside patio. Long story short, the manager apologized again and said our meal was supposed to be completely comped. The waiter approached us again (and only after the manger spoke to him) and said, \\"I'm just trying to make a living, I'm sorry.\\" I appreciate people that try to earn to make a living, but you should recognize when you're not meant for a job where customer service is key. The appetizers we ordered were great and I appreciate the manager taking action. I will eventually go back for the food, but only after I know the service has improved, because they ruined the entire experience for us -three strikes (in this case more!), you're out."},{"name":"City Winery","address":"650 North Ave NE, Ste 201, Ponce City Market","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"This is a great place to attend an event.

I definitely felt the focus here was more on local beers, however.

Walked in and was greeted by the owner and her assistant up front. The smell of BBQ in the air was intoxicating. I looked over the menu for a few, and decided it was best to ask the boss. She recommended the Brisket sandwich with 2 sides or 1 side and a drink. I opted to go for the 2 sides and also got a small piece of cornbread. \\n\\nThe brisket sandwich was served on Texas toast, which was made right in front of me on a really cool toaster machine. The brisket was moist, and had almost no fat (which I liked). There could have been a stronger smoked flavor, but it was very good.\\n\\nThe fried pickles were awesome with the dipping sauce, enough said there!\\n\\nThe beans were a little bit of a modification on the standard beans, because they had what looked like red beans in the mix with the more traditional baking beans. There was a nice think consistency and you could see the extra meat.

Go enough times so that they recognize you and the staff will warm up a little bit, but apparently the true friendliness is reserved for those dedicated patrons who have completed the challenge and get their drafts in the big, glass mugs behind the counter.   Still, I do know the annoyance of going on a random afternoon when the place is completely empty, sitting in the window, & being ignored.  A few of the bartenders could genuinely care less about helping you, it seems.  (Seriously, if you think you are too cool to be a bartender, perhaps you should look into a different line of work?)  Too be honest, I only put up with it on rare occasions because I like the beer selection and it is nice to sit in the window.  If they didn't have those roll-up garage doors, I would probably never come here.\\n\\nIt seems like the majority of the menu has changed quite a few times over the last year or two.  I used to love their mac & cheese, but then they completely changed the recipe.  The white trash cheese-dip is always a nice accompaniment to a few beers, but other than that, I tend to stay away from the food now.  If you ever sneak a look in the kitchen on the way to the bathrooms, you'll know why...\\n\\nThe real attraction here is the beer.  Whomever oversees the selections knows their stuff.  Certainly on par with Lord Hobo, but with less of a selection on draft and heavier on the domestic craft brews.  They do have plenty of bottles, but so does my fridge at home so I prefer drafts when I go out.  A lot of people complain about the beer prices, but they have actually come down a little bit recently to more reasonable rates.  \\n\\nIt is also rather lame that so many other reviewers complain that they are cash only.  It's not like they try to hide this fact.  Kinda hard to miss the giant \\"cash only\\" sign right by the front door....  \\n\\nTwo years ago, before more competition started to creep into the area, I would come here more often.

Here's why:\\n\\nThe Flying Saucer traditionally has a great vibe. I've been to Saucers in Fort Worth and Addison (Dallas) and they all have character and atmosphere. This Saucer just feels...contrived. It feels like it belongs in an upper-middle class suburban strip mall for the yuppie crowd to get their kicks trying different beers. It quite frankly has no soul.\\n\\nThis isn't just due to how new this location is, but I was more than disturbed to find a bar inside of this establishment...like a fully stocked bar serving mixed drinks. This shocked me, as the whole premise of the Saucers of old was essentially 'drink great beer or get out'. \\n\\nAside from this disturbing addition, the service the last several time I have been was less than average. In other Saucers the place could be packed yet it feels like a well-oiled machine of beer delivery and order taking. This Saucer leaves that mentality at the door, especially on average nights.\\n\\nIf you want great beer and a place with some soul, head further south to The Gingerman. If you loved the Flying Saucer in another city, you will be sorely disappointed by this particular one. Do yourself a favor and keep driving."},{"name":"Gustav's Pub & Grill","address":"10350 SW Greenburg Rd","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Gustavs makes my tummy happy.

You find yourself staring at the red and yellow sign of Chico & Chang's attached to a relatively nondescript maroon colored building which clearly has seen better days. After you make your way past the crackhead in the parking lot hitting his pipe, step around the homeless drunk laying near the shrubs just after you're propositioned by at least two skanky, toothless prostitutes, you finally make it up to the window to place your order. \\n\\nNeedless to say, the problem with Chico & Chang's isn't the food (though we'll get to that in a moment) it's the neighborhood. There are two homeless and rehab shelters adjacent or near Chico & Chang's and the residents tend to hang near the lot to beg for change, dig in the dumpster, pee in the shrubs, and poop in the parking lot. Safety tip: You don't want to visit here too late in the evening unless you want to mingle with the dregs of humanity. Tip #2: have your order delivered.\\n\\nOkay, the food then: Chico & Chang's has the usual fare of Americanized Chinese: fried this and fried that; chicken, pork, beef, and fish slathered in sweet and sour, spicy, or other types of sauces. C & C fried rice is decent, however unexceptional. The other half of the menu is  Mexican food: tacos, burritos, and all that jazz. Not surprisingly, the Mexican food is mediocre too. \\n\\nGenerally cheap and of moderate quality, there are worse places to eat than Chico & Chang.

Staying in the Courtyard Marriott, it's perhaps very convenient if you don't want to go out. But if you want average to bad food, this is THE place. Asked for the steak bento box. Nibbled on the salad and the spring roll, which were average. When I tried a couple of pieces of the steak it was cold. Tried a third piece to give it a shot, just to be sure. Called the server and mentioned that it was cold and i couldn't eat it. Her first reaction was that you have already eaten 3 pieces of the meat and I should have told her before I ate more of it and I was going to be charged for it. That was it for me, asked for the manager who also seemed to suggest that I had to pay for it as well.  This was for a $20. \\n\\nI paid for it and on my way out told the manager that all they had to do was switch the plate out. To have the server suggest that I was going to have to pay for it, which I was going to do anyway,  was a bit insulting. I am usually generous about cutting restaurants slack because every day is not perfect, but you can make up a bad food day with extraordinary service. That was unfortunately not the case. The on duty manager offered to make it up in the evening and I politely declined. I wish my first review was a positive one, but, sadly that was not the case.

The only knock is that it was cash only.  I had to borrow cash from my friend and pay him back later.  He said that all Anna's are like that.  I guess they don't want to pay the small percentage to the credit card company.  They might be perfect if they started allowing cards.

Yelp helped us select this gem and we were so appreciative of it!  The location was just off the main \\"drag\\" in Brookline.  We snagged a parking spot just across the street from the restaurant (otherwise it would have been a pain.  We arrived around 6pm and what looked to be just before the main push for dinner on a Wednesday night.  \\n\\nWe elected to do Hibachi over the standard dinner option.  The Hibachi chef was very exuberant and lively - almost to his detriment.  (Would have been good for a crowd of 8-10 but it was early and just us at the grill/table so he probably could have toned it down just a bit.)  The food was cooked well but lacked the seasoning we had previously seen and been used to at a Hibachi steak place.  He used no butter and we saw no salt/pepper added to the food - just alot of rice vinegar.  The meat and vegetables were cooked wonderfully though, so that sort of helped make up the seasoning.  (the only reason I didn't give a 5 star though)  One thing that did irritate my wife was the chef giving a portion of her steak and shrimp entree to me (and not giving her any of my chicken).  I understood her position, but hey - I benefited so I can't really be upset.\\n\\nI will say - the sushi I had for an appetizer was FANTASTIC!  I tried a Japanese Fusion roll called the American Tango - Hot pepper tuna, cucumber, avocado, goat cheese, tempura shitake mushroom with strawberry and balsamic vinegar sauce.

The cheese was really thick and chunky, and most of it slid off my burger when I ate it. I eventually had a big enough pile of it to scoop it back on my burger at the end. The fries were good, seasoned well and they give you a generous portion! Everything came out piping hot and fresh off the grill.\\n\\nMy friend got the California chicken sandwich, and subbed the jalapenos for mushrooms, and got the zucchini/squash as her side. I can tell she didn't hate it because she sent a clean plate back to the kitchen!\\n\\nBest of all, everything is reasonably priced.

You'll wait in line for 45+ minutes only to be charged $5.00 cover, which is blasphemous considering you'll probably wait another half hour once you're in to actually get the bartenders' attention. \\n\\nThe layout of this place is brutal. There's a really long, table top area that runs parallel to the bar that basically acts as a huge barrier from getting a drink. The back room has another bar which is smushed in the corner of the room, so basically everyone just crowds into that one nook and you can't get a drink there either. It wouldn't be so bad if they didn't consistently let way too many people in, it's impossible to walk around without bumping into people and feeling like you're in a herd of cattle. \\n\\nAnd the music... oh the music. Please don't believe that \\"live music\\" involves  bands that are up-and-coming or local bands performing their own tunes, all they are is cover bands playing the same bon jovi songs we've heard countless times everywhere else. Most people look too drunk and sloppy to care that the music is extremely lackluster and way too loud. The dance floor is also really well lit, which isn't a good thing. \\n\\nYou want to go to a bar in the fenway area that's doesn't charge a ridiculous cover, has great music, and plenty of room to actually exist? Go to Cask n' Flagon up the street. I avoid having to get dragged to the Landsdowne at all costs."},{"name":"Shiki","address":"9 Babcock St","city":"Brookline","stars":"3.5","text":"Came for lunch.

I ordered soup and a chicken parm sandwich (1/2 of which I was hoping to take home to my husband).  The soup (wheat bisque?) was amazing; creamy, rich and delicately seasoned.

The breads were really nice, and the channa masala and coconut tomato soup was amazing.\\n\\nService was a little awkward, I don't think our server understood us very well. First, we asked her if we could have the bread basket, but swap out the 3 types of bread for bread we chose ourselves. I wasn't sure if they would do this for us, but she said yes! Then, the manager came over and asked us if we were sure we wanted to order so much bread. We were confused. We told her that we wanted to swap out some of the bread options in the bread basket, and she said no, they didn't do that. Just a little mis communication there I guess.\\n\\nNext, I ordered some bhel puri with the rest of our food. When they brought our food out, our server gave me dal poori. I told her that wasn't what I ordered, she brought it back. Then, a couple of seconds later, another server brought the same plate of dal poori out. I then had to tell him as well, that it wasn't what I had ordered. Our server came back to inform me that I had ordered dal poori. I then told her that we must have misunderstood each other, and I had meant to order bhel puri, they sound pretty similar. She looked frustrated with me, and I just told her that I didn't want the bhel puri anymore, we had already had enough food.

This was a Sunday evening around 6 PM on the day after changing back to standard time from daylight savings, so a) it was really dark and b) it didn't quite feel like dinner time. Few tables were occupied when we arrived, more by the time we left.\\nI love a place with a great draft beer selection, so I was excited to try this place again. My memories of my first visit, about a year ago, was good beer and good food, and I don't recall exactly what we ate/drank. \\nWhen I say a great draft beer selection, I mean a great selection of classic beers: pilsners, IPAs, English Bitters, ales, stouts. I have strong opinions about the many \\"off\\" beers that have become fashionable, as in \\"watch me make a beer so different from the rest that nobody will drink it\\": fruit flavored beers, saisons, wheat beers, white beers, sour beers, and beers with high alcohol content. Fritz Hahn of the Washington Post recently published a great article about this phenomenon: because of the explosion of new breweries and new beers, the great old standby's are being crowded out. \\nSo on the walls, in chalk, are names and descriptions of many types of beer. Try finding them on the rotating beer menu? Good luck. I am an IPA guy, and had an IPA that was not particularly interesting. My wife likes stouts, the server kindly gave her small tastes, and same thing, nothing that interested her. So: 3 for the beer curation. Some of us wound up ordering bottled beers, there is a huge selection. But come on! The whole point is to trust the proprieter to curate great beers. To bring in the \\"off\\" beers strikes me as one-upmanship, like a game of beer chicken or the Emperor has no clothes: I dare you to try this horrid beer and tell me you like it. I'm not playing that game.\\nService was ok not great. We had a hipster server who didn't seem interested in serving us. She went off somewhere and was tough to flag down. We wound up flagging down another server who took over, and then did a good job. Lag between ordering beer and having served was long (recall the place was pretty empty).\\nFood was ok not great. We are non-meat eaters, and the selections were limited, which is ok and not unusual. I had a spicy chinese salad which was good, mostly noodles, flavor was good, nothing to write home about. Others were similarly unenthusiastic about the food. \\nAll the above need not be the case. The atmosphere of the place is good, nice room, good decorations, good music selections and sound system. Bukowski can easily step up their service and food game and include a better selection of draft beers that are delicious: Anchor Steam, Sierra Nevada, Harpoon, and the thousands of new breweries in New England and elsewhere."},{"name":"The Lansdowne Pub","address":"9 Lansdowne St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I've spent many nights at this bar and god if those walls could talk. \\nOverall they have good drinks, live music, and coatcheck if need be.

I've been several times over the past year, only for happy hour (so far just in the bar inside), but I think it's one of the best happy hours in town. Potential sources of bias for me include that it's in my neck of the woods, and that I am really particular about margaritas and this place has about 6 different varieties of margarita that include some variation on the tequila or the orange liqueur (my favorite is the local one with extra Paula's Texas Orange). Drinks and appetizers are 1/2 priced during HH, which runs all 7 days, but the times are different during the weekend. I always get the queso, which is good but the roasted pork chunks that come with it end up displacing the volume of queso, so you always run out of queso before the chips. The nachos are pretty solid, the barbacoa stackers really tasty, and the beef rib quesadilla is also pretty substantial (but the sauce is a little too sweet/bbq-y for my taste). The red chile fries are unique and addictive, and the pimento cheese sometimes given in the beginning is a nice touch. I haven't had anything outside of the appetizer menu, but it's pretty substantial and includes things that could be a main meal, like fish tacos and a rich-sounding pasta dish."},{"name":"Hawkers Asian Street Food","address":"1103 Mills Ave N","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Every dish was so delicious, loved the tofu.

We order take out once a week from here. We haven't eaten in yet, but we want to as soon as we can. The space is colorful and clean and everyone there is friendly. The food has a very homemade quality to it, like you are eating something that a really good cook made in their own kitchen.

I loved the ambiance. Lots of seating, very spacious, and a nice decor. The music had me dancing the entire time. It was the right volume and the right tunes!  We had the most A-MAZING server named Amani! She was awesome with answering the many questions my friend and I asked about different dishes and their level of spice and flavor profile. Glancing over the menu I see all of my Jamaican/Caribbean favorites and a few other interesting sounding dishes. I'm getting a fusion vibe after looking through each item on the menu. \\n\\nI selected the conch fritters for starters. They were darker than I would expect a fritter to be, but I jumped right in. First bite, was ok but they are very spicy if your palate is sensitive. My palate can only take a little bit of heat and these were really spicy. The sweet chili dipping sauce was a good match for this dish. However, there was an awful lot of breading and not much conch. \\n\\nFor my entree, I opted for the Cuban Coconut Lime Chicken, cabbage and coconut rice. It was a generous portion for the price. My eyes were drawn to the cabbage which was prepared more southern style than Caribbean which was obvious looking at the limp cabbage leaves. It was not crunchy at all, very much over cooked. It also did not have much in the way of flavor. I'm a cabbage girl...I'm also a southern girl so I'm ok with overcooked cabbage, but not when I'm eating Caribbean food. I want that crunchy, fresh, flavorful goodness. I took a few bites and had to stop. The chicken was beautifully charred and the coconut lime sauce looked so full of flavor. The chicken was very tender as I sliced into it. Awesome for a chicken breast as it was not dry at all. Very juicy, very tender, but had no flavor. I dipped into the coconut lime sauce and I struggled to taste the lime or coconut. What overpowered the sauce was the base (flour or cornstarch) and a very sugary taste. I added a little salt to try to help amp up the flavor and it just wasn't happening.   It wasn't super bland, but lacked that full body flavor that I'm used to getting at Caribbean restaurants. I moved on to the coconut rice. It was just ok. Not much in the way flavor again. I tasted my friends brown stewed chicken and knew immediately that this was not going to be your widely accepted dish. This was fusion with a twist on that dish you know and love.\\n\\nThis wasn't the worst Caribbean meal I had ever tasted, but it wasn't the best either. I would come back just to give them another try. Although I only gave 3 stars, I would say it is worth a try. However, I'd like to offer a few tips/pointers to those who have never been here. Do NOT, I repeat DO NOT have your mind set on that real authentic Jamaican food. You will be let down. Think of this as more of a fusion of different regions of the Caribbean. Secondly, look at the pictures that other have posted to have a good idea of what you can expect for the look of these dishes.

We walked in and across the room past the bar and we were greeted with smiles.  We were seated immediately in the next room at a table for 4, so we had plenty of room.  It was a lovely atmosphere, with white tablecloths.  There were a lot of windows and our view was the patio and 3rd St.  Our server was fantastic.  She brought water and took drink orders and gave the specials.  My lemondrop martini went down nicely.  We started with the Calamari Fritti (very good), and each had the House Salad (nice greens, with spiced pecans and red wine poached pears), which were pretty large.  She brought us warm sliced bread with butter.  I think there was red bell pepper in the butter.  Delicious.  We shared a bottle of Barbera with our entrees:  my husband had the Pan-roasted Wild Alaskan Halibut, and I had the Almond-crusted Trout.  I couldn't finish but am looking forward to the leftovers for lunch today.  We ended our meal with a dessert each (one being complimentary for the occasion).  When we arrived, I only saw a few diners, but by the time we left, the room we were in was nearly full.  I would  love to come back again.

I thought the food was just okay. I liked the tamal the best. The cochinita pibil plate was decent, but I thought the pork was dry. The tinga chicken was also a little dry and not very flavorful and I didn't expect the chalupa to be thin and flat like a tostada. The self-serve salsa station was also out of a couple salsas.

We were seated right by a window, but unfortunately, it was dark out, so we could not take in the spectacular views.  We started with some Pino Noir and the fried oysters (special) and kangaroo as appetizers.  Both were simply amazing.  I had never tried kangaroo and I absolutely loved it.  Also, they bring several bread options to the table and you have as much as you want.  The sourdough was my favorite.  For dinner, I had the swordfish, which was delicious.  My friend had the monk fish, which was a special.  His was delicious, as well.  For dessert, I had the popcorn ice cream sundae with cracker jacks.  It was beyond amazing and quite a sizable portion.  My friend had the chocolate grotto, which was great, as well.  The service was spot on the prices were reasonable.

I'm normally the one to wreck on restaurants that normally get 5's with my throat-cutting 3's and 2's.  Here, I am apparently playing the vigilante.  I chose this place to eat with my friends before leaving Austin for the summer season.  I figured... I love Sunday brunches, and I love trying new places.  \\n\\nWe pulled up at 11:05, and there was a 40 MINUTE WAIT!  FOR A BRUNCH THAT STARTS AT 11?!  Most brunch places don't even open until 11:30AM, much less seat before they even open.  4 friends and I quickly gave up that 40 minute wait and scrunched onto a baby sized 2-person bar stool.  That didn't play so well, as 4 plates, 4 cups, and 4 sets of silverware don't really fit on a 2 foot circle.  For being really annoying and dropping 6 sets of knives and forks throughout the meal, the service was great and accommodating without ever being snobby.\\n\\nThe food, oh boy.  Normally, you don't put yourself in a food coma if you know it's coming.  In this case, I KNEW that this food was able to induce a food coma, and I let it hit me... with open arms.  I mean, I'm all for justifying eating what you pay for, so $13 isn't hard to eat your fill on... and I ate well into and past that $13.\\n\\nThe buffet was not HUGE, but my friend put it best: \\"everything on the buffet has a flavor that blends well with anything else.\\"  I was literally eating cream chicken with sweet, tart ham topped with smoked salmon cream cheese.  Everything on the buffet had about 1 or 2 strong flavors that really could pair with anything.\\n\\nSome disappointments were chicken fried beef tenderloin; I know you're probably asking yourself: beef tenderloin?  fried chicken style?  how can that be bad?  To this I answer: do you like well done beef tenderloin?  Also: why not try their chicken fried pork tenderloin, which by the way was extremely moist and flavorful.  Also, the biscuits were a bit dry, and the gravy was a bit bland; a bit sad since you could order them fresh.  Cheese enchilada casserole was pretty boring, in flavor and creativity.  Another disappointment was the sides:  broccoli casserole, tomato salad, and green bean salad.  They lacked a bit of character.  Lastly, the grits... I'm normally a grits man, and these cheddar grits would have set this place apart like no other, but the grits were a bit lumpy, and dry.  Beyond these numerous faults, the brunch was outstanding.\\n\\nRefried black beans were all I ask for in beans: flavor, heartiness, creaminess.  Mama's Sunday chicken was a bit pedestrian with a cream sauce, tender chicken, but the mushrooms MADE the dish for some reason.  The springy fungus just absorbed up all that flavor.  Fresh avocado salsa was a great addition to pretty much anything you ate.  House-cured ham was the right amount salty, and it had a nice sweet-savory, honey-mustard sauce.  Smoked salmon had more salmon than cream cheese, an attribute that most places don't offer.  Fried pork and beef tenderloin were good, more so the former.\\n\\nSo they didn't have THAT many good items, but the limited amount of good items that were offered were ridiculously good that I had 2 full plates of just beans, avocados, ham, and salmon.\\n\\nThis brunch is one of the best options you have for $13 in Austin, so get here, and get here early.  If no tables are available, be annoying and sit at the bar.  Service is great, and the food is even greater.

I was unable to finish my tasting tray and spoke a soft, sad (and probably far-too-long) apology to my wasted beer as I left the table.\\n\\nMy rating has nothing to do with my personal state of health at the time, obviously. I would just have to say that, compared to other breweries that I visited in Portland, Deschutes came off very commercial. It was packed to the brim as well, so perhaps that's why we also had lags in service. In all: the experience just didn't feel very authentic. For those two reasons, I've docked a star. I almost gave them three stars total, but I can't in good faith. Their beer is just too good!\\n\\nSo I was able to try sips from each of the beers on my tray, and also tried my friend's Black Butte Porter, which I enjoyed. On my tray, I had the Mirror Pond Pale (a-okay), Inversion IPA (not my favorite), Obsidian Stout (fairly good), Zarabanda (what isss this saison!), Fresh Squeezed IPA (love love love), and Dissociator Doppelbock (darn good).\\n\\nI didn't try their Chainbreaker White IPA or Red Chair NWPA during my visit because i've had both of 'em before in Philly and knew already that I loved them a whole bunch.

And almost EVERY time I pass by here, I am contemplating pulling over to b-line it inside. YES, the food is THAT good. If you LOVE Asian food you will LOVE this place. First, there are so many options to choose from (i.e. Korean, Chinese, Szechuan, noodle bowls, etc.) that there is something for everyone. And the great thing is, the prices are SO incredibly reasonable that you can try several things without breaking the bank. And if you notice a friend sneaking onto your plate, no need to stress! Think of this place as an Asian Tapas restaurant, sharing is encouraged. I must say, the service is hit and miss. The first two times I went, service was impeccable. The last two times...not so much. But keep in mind they have take-out and special events throughout the week like BYOW (Bring Your Own Wine) with no cork fee that makes up for the hit and miss service days.

He returned with a small plate of the scampi and said I could have that while I waited.  About 10 minutes later, my steak arrived, and was cooked to medium rare perfection.

Every review on here raves about this dish, and for good reason: it IS quite delicious, and since it is the only offering that is distinctly and completely Nepalese, the Chicken Momo is a must-order item.  The Chinese influence ends there, however, as all of the other meals tastes much like amazing Indian food.  My wife and I eat here often, and we typically get either the Vegetarian Meal-for-Two or the Non-Vegetarian Meal-for-Two.  This just makes the most sense because you get such a wide variety of flavors and at a very reasonable price considering that this Meal-for-Two could actually feed four people!  Nothing like some tasty leftovers the next day!  They have all of the traditional Indian staples from Lentil Soup and Vegetable Pakora (like vegetable hushpuppies, if you will) to Saag Paneer (a creamed and curried spinach with cubes of cheese) and Chicken Tandoori.  I've never had Mali Kofta before eating here, and it has such a thick creamy texture and flowery flavor that I prefer to dip my Naan in it over anything else; as a bonus, the two nutty dumplings of sorts hiding at the bottom are simply divine.  Be sure to order your dessert that is included in the Meal-for-Two when you place your order as well, because they often just assume that you are rightly too full to eat anything else.  I never knew Pistachio Ice Cream could be so good; you'll be delightfully surprised.  Kathmandu is exactly what I look for in a local restaurant: a modest, no-frills interior (sometimes with live music) with a good health score that offers amazing meals at cheap prices.

The menu was a mixture of German, French, and American dishes, and that is fine - the original owners were German trained in French cooking, and I like German food. I ordered the shrimp and crab cake, which was quite small for the price. It came with some greens, which were way too bitter. I told the waiter, who told me that they were radicchio and mustard greens and are supposed to be bitter to help with digestion. He seemed arrogant and unfriendly, and I know mustard greens and radicchio, and this was just a case of bad greens. I thought that shrimp and crab would be tough to put in the same crabcake since they are fully cooked at different temperatures. Sure enough, the shrimp bits in my crabcake were overcooked.

DH really liked his Wedge salad, he said that despite having to construct his own salad, the dressing was great. On that note, I took away a star for some of the food presentation choices. The wedge salad comes with two pieces of bacon and cheese on skewers meaning it's up to you to take apart the bacon and cheese and cut it up. I just want to eat a salad, didn't I just pay for you to prepare it for me? Also, they serve the burgers with a huge steak knife sticking out the top.

Tried again and still the service is miserable!   Arrived around 2 PM yesterday (Sat 7/7/18) for lunch and ended up sitting at the bar since the place was empty.   First mistake.   Bartender had another couple and moved at an amazingly slow pace.    We finally ordered and she slowly made our drinks.   A third couple sat down by now so we figured we'd better order food since it had already taken 15 minutes to be acknowledged and served a cocktail.    We did.     15 minutes later one entree arrived.    Was told the other would be \\"out in a few\\".   10 minutes later, no food.    5 minutes later finally got her attention and she said, \\"it takes 15 minutes to make a flatbread\\".  I reminded her it has already been 25 minutes and why would a cook send out one entree without the other because now one of us would be done eating while the other one continued to wait for food!    She literally glared at me and went to find out where the flatbread was.   By this time another bartender had arrived - Will - and he at least cared about what was going on.    \\"She\\" took another 5+ minutes to return during which we discussed with Will that they either forgot to make it or someone left it sitting there.   \\"She\\" came back up and never came near us.   Will asked her where our flatbread was and she told HIM, that they made a mistake and burnt it and had to make another.    She never approached us, she never apologized for the inconvenience, she basically didn't care if we ever saw that food.  Will jumped and apologized, offered a free cocktail (we declined) and helped us with a gift card issue (side props to the manager who fixed our gift card - she was great).    Finally got the pizza and had a couple pieces - took the rest home.    Will got us a to-go box and our check.   \\"She\\" never came near us again.       I think it's a shame that a person with complete disregard for guests and a complete lack of concern about the company in general would still be employed.

A chefs rule is typically that if your menu is too diverse, you'll inevitably do some of it wrong, and that is true here. First, the ambiance is great-- and I really liked the waitstaff and the hostess. I think the owner was around, too, though he didn't stop to chat-- he was busy helping servers, which I thought was cool. The menu is global, reflecting the name of the restaurant. The drinks are generous for the price. The food needs some work from international chefs who can spot basic culinary mistakes. So, first we started with warm olives and warm spiced nuts-- a traditional way of beginning a multi course meal-- and they were delicious. Well saut√©ed with nice spices. Next, grape leaves: much too dry, under spiced. A stuffed grape leaf should not fall apart, and should not have tough veins, but these had both. Then, fish tacos-- a huge portion, actually-- with thick white fish, black bean sauce, and great dippers. Good, though not your traditional baja style. Then salads nicoise with... Pickles? Odd, but not horrible, though I would have liked fresher tuna. And the cheese platter, which makes two unforgivable mistakes, if it hopes to hold up to French tradition: no baguettes (they offered focaccia?!), and three strong cheeses, rather than a trio that built on each flavor. The waitress told us to eat them in the wrong order too-- Roquefort first (note to reader: never, ever eat the Roquefort first!). The utter disappointment was the dessert. We ordered baklava, which came in a generous \\"share\\" portion for two. But with only one top layer of phillo, and a thick filling of what seemed to be the spiced nuts from earlier in the evening mixed with cinnamon, it was wrong in every way. This is such a serious mistake for a foodie. Eat some baklava!--it's either pistachio with honey (Greek) or walnut with simple syrup and rose water (Middle Eastern), and it always has several layers of phyllo dough, with thin layers of nuts. This wasn't passable in any ethnic tradition.  Will we go back? Probably, to give the Asian fusion a try (Korean, Chinese, Thai). Will we recommend it? With the caveat that its not culinarily accurate food, and that it's too expensive to be disappointing. Recommendation for the owner: seriously, serve baguettes, not oily, spicy focaccia, with a menu that is mostly NOT Italian. The focaccia ruins the flavors of other dishes, where baguettes would complement them."},{"name":"H Harper Station","address":"904 Memorial Dr SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Nice atmosphere, great bar and bartenders.

It was tender, and the sauce was sweet.  The meat just fell off the bone.  Even eating with the plastic fork we received with our takeout - a knife was not necessary. \\n\\nAlthough my boyfriend originally thought the spicy goodness of his jerk chicken had prevented him from tasting the veggie rice that accompanied his entree.  The reality was, the rice just didn't have a flavor and, to me, seemed a bit under-cooked.\\n\\nSo, for us anyway, the chicken dishes we chose were good - sides, not so much.\\n\\nThe staff, however, was immediately attentive when we wandered in off the street unaware that this would be our first foray into Jamaican food.\\n\\nSo, 3.5 stars overall.

I had a great time, delicious food, and wonderful service there, so imagine my delight when I came back to Atlanta and learned of a location opening up here! \\n\\nI went with a small group of 3 on a Friday evening. Worried about long waits, we got there just before 6. The restaurant was about half full when we arrived and we got seated quickly. The hostess handed us 1 sheet of paper and pen for us to order with. \\n\\nYou mark your soup base (not spicy, spicy, or both) and then choose the items you want. Meats include beef, pork, lamb, chicken. There's also a plethora of vegetables and tofu. There are multiple noodle options as well. At the bottom of the sheet, there are some rather random items you could order, including fried turnip balls, fried dough, different buns, green onion pancakes, and so on. Mark your broth, how many servings you want of each item (i.e. 3 lamb, 4 napa cabbage, etc), and hand it to your server. \\n\\nService: Rather all over the place still. We had 3 different servers come by and ask us if we had the mixed pot (both spicy and not) - no, we had the spicy only. When our orders came, we were missing some of the items we ordered, like some veggies, fried turnip ball thing, and all of our meats. There was 1 male server, \\"Meat guy\\" we called him, who kept pumping out plates of different types of meat from the kitchen. He would just stop at our table and ask if we wanted meat - uh, yes please! We had no dietary restrictions, so it didn't really matter to us what exactly we were eating (important since he didn't tell us what it was).\\n\\nFood: It seemed like it didn't really matter what # you write next to the item when we went. Those we wrote \\"2\\" next to were the same size as those we wrote \\"4\\" next to. But whatever - it's all-you-can-eat so just ask for more! The spicy broth was not spicy at all, in our opinions, although it contained a very thick layer of chili oil. Be warned - you will not be feeling too great by the end of this food fest. But hey, I thought it was worth it! The broth was seasoned very liberally and was very aromatic (and salty). The veggies and meats all looked and tasted fresh. \\n\\nFavorite: fried tofu, frozen tofu, lamb, beef, taro, hand-made (shou gong) noodles, and all the green veggies (napa, spinach, dou miao, si li hong, etc). \\n\\nThis is a great place for both small and large groups. Don't come when you're limited on time, because not only are you not going to make it, you'll change the experience. This is a place to sit, relax, chat, cook, and stuff yourself like there's no tomorrow, not an in-and-out restaurant. \\n\\nI hope they fix up the service here, because once they do, it will be a glorious, glorious restaurant that will really give the other hotpot places a run for their money. For now, it's a tasty restaurant that will test the limits of both your stomach and patience.\\n\\nTips: Get here early with an appetite and wear clothes you plan on washing. By 6:30, there was a small crowd gathered at the door. With 20 bubbling pots of broth hard at work in the restaurant, you are guaranteed to smell like grease, meat, and spices by the time you leave."},{"name":"Smile Thai Cafe","address":"16 Eliot St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"2.5","text":"blah. decent thai, but not even close to Rod Dee and Dok Bua"},{"name":"Grindhouse Killer Burgers","address":"6000 N Terminal Pkwy","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"Stopped here in between flight and it was very mediocre.

The waitress was genuinely warm and friendly. She made us feel like we were guests in her home and gave us a complimentary coconut pudding to take home which was  scrumptious.

It's the last hold-out mom-n-pop type establishment in an upscale town center, but that's what keeps people coming back. You don't go there for gourmet dishes with intricate recipes. Just go there for simple, hearty Italian dishes, smothered in red sauce and cheese, you will not be disappointed. \\n\\nThe atmosphere is very old school: dim lighting, hardwood chairs, tacky wall murals and red/white checker tablecloths. The staff is friendly, but they can get rushed as this place tends to draw a crowd.\\n\\nJust follow my #1 Mario's tip: Always order the meat sauce! I'd bet dollars to doughnuts that reviewers here that say they didn't like the sauce ordered marinara on their food. The marinara is ok, but it is a little bland. The meat sauce has a lot more oomph.\\n\\nTheir menu is short. I strongly recommend anything parmigiana (veal, chicken or eggplant) or their lasagna. Their pizza is very good, but it has a very unique crust that doesn't always click with everyone, I suggest trying it once to see which side you're on. And always check the specials on the board! Usually you can get a good combo plate.\\n\\nBy far, my favorite place to just chill out.

We were seated 5 minutes into waiting, and luckily enough the hostess was able to explain to us what was popular and what was best known as we wanted to get the $12 sampler. Pretty good price for a sampler with 6 beers. \\n\\nWe also shared a bacon brie burger and decided to go for the pretzel everyone raves about with the dipping sauce. The flights came first and they specifically liked all the Pale Ales the most. However, this sampler was totally worth it and I saw that mostly all the tables had it!! You get to try so many beers and it's an experience in itself. Our burger came out and it was pretty good, the bacon was hefty and I very much liked that it complimented the sampler beers. \\n\\nPretzel & dipping sauce: I thought it was alright. I know everyone raves about it but I think it is meant for a bigger group because my friend and I thought it was just okay and ended up barely eating half. The dipping sauce was a bit too much for me with the pretzel, and the brown mustard sauce was ... interesting (something I wasn't very much used to). I didn't quite enjoy it as much as everyone did here and neither did my friend. However, the pretzel looked like it was freshly made and if I wasn't too full, I would've enjoyed it more.

As soon as I walked in, I was greeted by a very friendly staff member who also handed me a menu. When he saw my boyfriend and I struggling with a decision, he asked if it was our first time and gave us his suggestions from the menu. I opted for a calamari 'appetizer' and a side of peanut corn salad for my meal. My beau got the chicken caesar panini. We also got drinks.\\n\\nWow. This calamari was good. They even fried thin slices of lemon with the calamari and it tastes unique and delicious. The corn peanut salad was okay. It's a huge bowl for a side dish (same size as my 'appetizer'!) but the corn got a little much after a while. My boyfriend's panini was also quite large, and he got a side of chips. The drink options are awesome, the fresh teas and lemonades are so yummy, and so many options! \\n\\nThe place is really nicely decorated, with a small fire in front of the kitchen. The place is warm and cozy, but not overwhelming. However, there isn't much space between the door and the cashier, and I can see how this can be overwhelming during their busy hours.\\n\\nMy only complaint would be, like everyone else, the price.

We've mostly ordered noodle dishes here: stir-fried hand-pulled noodles with various types of protein, jjajangmyeon, \\"Mae-Kom Dal-Kom\\" chicken noodle, as well as some non-noodle dishes like the Korean cabbage and pork stir-fry and mapo tofu.\\n\\nAll the noodle dishes have been excellent: the noodles are thick (and clings to sauce easily) and have a wonderful chewy texture; the \\"wok hei\\" is excellent as you really taste the char and caramelization in the hot wok; the veggies are crispy and complement the chewiness of the noodles very well; the sauce is not overly spicy (medium) and the flavors are well-balanced.\\n\\nThe excellent stir-frying technique can be seen in some other dishes, too - in the Korean cabbage and pork stir-fry that I ordered last time, the bok choy was expertly cooked, nicely seared and crispy, and the pork pieces were tender and juicy, all nicely coated in a sweet-spicy gochujang sauce - goes very well with rice.\\n\\nI've never tried the grilled dishes like bulgogi, so I cannot comment on those.:\\n\\nThere are a few things that I don't like, though:\\n- The place is TINY; the wait can be very long - not just for the seats, but also after you sit down (last time we wait over half an hour after we placed our orders for our food, I think we were behind someone who placed 7-8 to-go orders); service can be a bit slow as they appear somewhat understaffed to accommodate all the customers.\\n- The banchan is obviously not a priority for them; neither the cabbage nor the daikon kimchi is memorable - the daikon kimchi especially has a strong stink from the daikon; maybe that's authentic? I don't notice it as much in the daikon kimchi of the various other Korean places though...\\n- All the tofu pieces are cut in uniform rectangular cubes, whether in stir-fried noodles or in mapo tofu; that makes it very hard to eat with the noodles together because of the differences in shapes (for example, the tofu should probably be cut into strips instead of cubes). The mapo tofu was sour - did the tofu go bad? We never ordered it again.\\n- The jjajangmyeon was not as good as other places; the noodles clumped together and was difficult to mix with the sauce, and the sauce was too bland.\\n\\nOverall, I feel that their specialties - the stir-fried hand-pulled noodles - are absolutely spot-on and excellent in every way; however, some of their other dishes have left me wanting. Go for the hand-pulled noodles and stir-fries at least - they will not disappoint.

The guys and I went on a Thursday night for our usual guys night out. There are 6 of us so we expected to wait to be seated. This is where the first problem kicked in. The hostess was quite clueless and told us it would be about 20 minutes. 45 minutes later we had to check again with her and she totally forgot about us despite the fact that we were sitting directly in front of her at the bar. So after the reminder she sat us close to the door. The one bright spot at this point was the bar tender. She was very attentive and courteous. After we were seated our waitress came over and gave the usual niceties.However, it was quickly revealed that she was also clueless . My buddy asked about beers and she pointed him to the food menu but couldn't exactly locate it for him. Then he asked about the other beers on tap that we had been shown at the bar while waiting. The waitress had a blank stare on her face for about two minutes then said \\"Oh\\" and pulled a crumpled piece of paper from her apron and gave it to my buddy. He asked about a couple of basic questions about the beers on the crumpled list and she replied \\"I don't know\\". Okay, soldier on. The waitress came later to take our orders. That process seemed smooth except that she came back a few minutes later because she had totally forgot one of our orders. This was wierd because she was writing it all down while taking the orders. The food came pretty quickly. The only problem was 3 out of the 5 orders were wrong. One of my buddies got the wrong salsa and not only was it wrong it was the hottest one they have and it totally fried his mouth because he thought it was regular salsa. Yikes! My other buddy did not get his extra guacamole and the last friend got a regular burrtio instead of a burrito bowl. In addition, the food runner proceeded to dump my ranch dressing all over my lap when he handed me the food. Epic fail.

One star over-all seems harsh, given that the restaurant was clean and the food arrived promptly, but the two-star rating says that it signifies \\"Meh. I've experienced better\\", and that is just too much of a forgiving shrug for my last experience at this place.\\n\\nI've heard that the lunch buffet at India House is a really great deal, and maybe it is, but dinner there on a Thursday night? NO. I've eaten at India House before and found it to be mediocre, but I was there as a guest of someone else's family, and wasn't paying, so I didn't complain and figured maybe the kitchen just had an off night. But this time, we all paid our own share of the bill and I ended up pretty aggravated -- and more enlightened -- so here's why I don't like India House.\\n\\nTwo reasons, one compounding the other:\\n1. The food is not at all wonderful. I ordered my favorite Indian dish, Lamb Korma, and while their sauce was just edible -- bland and unexciting -- the lamb itself was mostly INedible. Except for one bite, the flavorless meat was uniformly gristly and sinewy, the kind of thing you can chew for five minutes straight without breaking up the tough little rubber- band- textured bite. So you can either swallow it whole or wait until nobody's watching and spit it into a kleenex. (Guess which option I went for? Nasty handful of bunched up tissues disposed of in a garbage can outside on the way to the car.) \\n\\n2. Then, after the disappointment of my highly-anticipated-because-I-was -ravenous meal, what's this extra $3 charge on the bill? All I had was lamb korma and a lassi. The rice? The RICE?!?! Ok, I already am paying $14 for an entree that was essentially just $2 worth of cream and spices because the lamb was garbage, but they have the nerve to charge me for the rice?!? \\n\\nLook, I understand that I'm not just paying for the food -- I'm also paying for the restaurant's rent and bills, the ambiance, and for people to cook the food and serve it to me so that I can relax and just eat. But $14 at another restaurant would've gotten me all that AND a tasty, wholly edible meal...and the rice would have been included! I have never, never, never been to an Indian restaurant -- or ANY restaurant, come to think of it --  where the essential component of the meal (the rice goes UNDER THE SAUCE -- you would not eat the sauce by itself with a spoon!!) is sneaked onto the bill as a separate charge from its topping. Wow, the more I think about this, the madder I get. \\n\\nSo anyway, that was my last time at India House. I don't care if it's open late; I don't care if I have to spend more around the corner at South Park after a movie; I don't care if I have to wait til lunchtime the next day to get a REALLY good bargain for great food at Swagat -- the Chicken Korma at the Swagat buffet is heavenly! -- I am not going to India House ever again. I feel like I was cheated with that sneaky $3 rice, and that feeling is not a good digestion aid."},{"name":"The Original Dinerant","address":"300 SW 6th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Creme Brulee french toast....that's all that needs to be said.

The waiter didn't come to check on us as often as we would have liked, and sometimes when he came to one end of the table, he would forget to check in with the folks at the other end of the table.  Hence, minus one star.  Throughout the evening, sometimes someone else would deliver our food & drinks (the owners perhaps).  That person would always assure us that she would send the server right back out to make sure we had everything we needed.  And true to her word, each time our server would swing back by to make sure we were okay.  So plus one star for the consistent follow up.  To address the gaps in service, perhaps they can ask customers to order food at the counter and have the server deliver it.  That seems to work pretty well for the Hideout when they are short on servers.\\n\\nThe other stars are for the food and atmosphere.

Many of the Google reviews say \\"Excellent!\\" and the dress code was business casual or better. So, buying the gift certificate from out of state, he thought Petite Auberge sounded like a pretty nice place.\\n\\nWhat we found was a dated restaurant located in a strip mall (laundry mat, nail salon, tanning, groceries, pub, liquor store, etc.) with a dated interior and a much older clientele. The menu was decidedly not French. In fact, we thought it might even have been British. Maybe simply European. \\n\\nWe felt overdressed but, since it was a long-awaited date night for us, we didn't mind. The staff was friendly, eager, older, and easy to talk to. We were relaxed by this atmosphere but disappointed that it wasn't what we expected.\\n\\nMy husband had some sort of steak dish and I had the lobster. I started off with the crab/shrimp cake appetizer which was good enough but really nothing to write home about. It was well cooked but the flavors were quite bland. The lobster was just a tad undercooked and felt rubbery. Again, the flavors of the lobster were just not there. The vegetable was a strange steamed squash that was cooked fine but, once again, had no real flavor profile. I didn't eat much of that. The bed of rice was simply yellow rice, well-cooked.\\n\\nMy husband had Steak Frites, which is just French for steak and fries. We don't even know what type of steak it was but my husband said it was \\"Okay\\". He opted for desert and got the crepe with ice cream. Again, no special flavor profile to make him say \\"Wow!\\".\\n\\nI had a glass of the Petite Auberge Cabernet which was okay, too, but I switched to the Kendall-Jackson. Much better choice.

I chose a six spiciness level, because I like food spicy but am cautious the first time I order from a new restaurant. The caution was warranted, because it was just a bit too spicy. I thought the heat covered up the taste, which is unfortunate. The texture of the saag paneer was wonderful (I'd love to get my homemade saag paneer this fluffy), but I was very disappointed by the amount of paneer. There were three or four standard-sized cubes in the whole bowl.\\n\\nMy partner chose a seven spice level for his bhindi masala.

Their phone was ringing off the hook with to go order after to go order. Even amongst all this bustle, the cashier still managed to maintain pleasant conversation with me, and never dropped her smile. She managed to give the numerous customers on the phone attention while still making me feel important the entire time I was inside their store. The food was amazing. I have noticed most Chinese places now use yellow rice for their fried rice, and it's almost become expected to me, although I would prefer the traditional fried rice. This place cooks it so well though, that I almost didn't even notice I was eating yellow rice. The meat was delicious as well. I also got lo mein, which blew my taste buds clear out of my mouth. Oh yes, and the fried wontons were awesome.\\nBased on the location of this restaurant, and all of the other positive factors, I can see myself coming here at least once a week until I'm either 500 pounds or I die of MSG overdose."},{"name":"Harpoon Tap Room","address":"1 Harborside Dr","city":"Boston","stars":"2.5","text":"Out of the salad & given an attitude about it!\\n\\nPutting my beer down & getting out of here. \\n\\nDon't waste your time, eat before you get to A19 terminal!"},{"name":"Cafe Java- Austin","address":"11900 Metric Blvd, Ste K","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I love this place!

While I understand that butter may drip down in a bowl, salt and other seasonings should not. The entrees were not great. For $10, I expected a lot more. My chicken was dry, the pineapple was overcooked, and it just kind of tasted like the food had been microwaved. It was so hot, more so than food cooked on a stove is.

Ginza didn't really do right by me, or either of my two dining companions.  I'll admit, I went in here somewhat under the weather and with a new dietary restriction that I haven't quite figured out how to analyze menus from, but I just felt let down by my experience here.\\n\\nIt started because I didn't want to go for pub food.  We'd initially been planning on Elephant Walk, because I've found them to be ace in the past and they have a whole gluten-free section to their menu.  So I convinced my two people to avoid three other restos to come here.  But their menu was exceptionally limited for someone who was 1) vegetarian and 2) attempting to go gluten-free.  The only rice-based dishes they had were in the maki/sushi section, and they didn't use egg noodles,  so at first I just asked if they could make something:  I'm really not picky, I'll eat anything that's a vegetable.  \\n\\nIts a trick that works in almost any steak house:  \\"Can you just make me a plate from the sides?\\"  But instead, because I was in a Japanese place, I just asked if they could fry me up some veggies and throw them on some rice.  They said no.  They had a similar dish that was stir-fried veggies but on buckwheat noodles, but for real, girl just said no.  When pressed, she said I could have some broccoli.  And then just left me there with my mouth wide open.  We'd already ordered drinks, so I couldn't just walk out.  My roommate called over the host a few minutes later, and asked him if he could do anything, and he was much more responsive.  He's the only reason this isn't a one star review.  We asked if maybe they had other vegetables besides broccoli, like say maybe the ones they use for tempura.  He said he'd ask the chef.  There was a lot more talk, especially when the server came back, and I'm guessing in there that something got twisted, because what eventually arrived on my plate was a selection of artfully arranged un-battered tempura vegetables still dripping with oil.  And a small bowl of white rice.  My hungry hungover heart broke into hundreds of tiny pieces when I saw this plate.\\n\\nOther small oddities ... my roommate was served a margarita in a martini glass with no ice.  And our third dining companion asked for a small side order of noodles, to go with his admittedly very tasty looking food, and was told that wasn't possible.  We had no idea why not.  \\n\\nI don't know, the whole thing was off-putting, and although they tried to help me out, there were just enough awkward moments and disappointment that I won't be going back."},{"name":"Hawkers Asian Street Food","address":"1103 Mills Ave N","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Welcome to my life roti canai.

There was a good amount of Paneer, but not really so much in the cashew/raisin department. Definitely yummy though, and along with the accompanying rice and the extra chapatis we ordered (2 for $3.00) left us feeling full and happy. \\n\\nThe bill for 1. two samosas, 2. two lassis, 3. Shahi Paneer with rice, and 4. two chapatis was around $25.

Getting salads and a burger to go helps me out a great deal when cooking isn't an option. \\n\\nUnfortunately, over the past two years the quality has declined and it's only after a series of frustrating experiences that I write this review. Last night's visit was the latest in a long line of \\"no just no\\" experiences which prompted this review.\\n\\nConsistency and quality control are big problems at this location. Last night I ordered our usual and they forgot the chicken in my husband's chicken cobb salad. It's clear that the orders are not checked prior to release and even though we've made it a habit to double-check (something that should be done by M&E's staff) we didn't check before leaving. \\n\\nSometimes the salads have very little lettuce (sometimes brown, sometimes only the bottom of the bag remnants) and the substitution upcharges are a mystery to me. I'm very specific and clear on our orders and M&E's gets it right only about half the time. Last night I called as soon as we discovered there wasn't any chicken and I told them I'd be right up to collect it (we live 5 minutes away, at most). I waited at curbside pickup for about 5 minutes and then decided to call in so my food at home wouldn't get any colder. \\n\\nAfter that, someone brought out the semi-warm chicken in a plastic container and with no apology for the hassle. I was kind of surprised at this and a little miffed. Having worked in the food industry, I was trained that an apology goes a long way and, in certain situations, comping the meal is appropriate. However, I got nothing in the way of satisfaction last evening. This is both a training and a management issue and one that is very fixable, IMHO. \\n\\nIt shouldn't be the customer's problem to make sure the order is complete and correct. Frankly, the wondering if my order will be right thing has become almost a stress situation and I'm both saddened and disappointed because the convenience factor is great - when things are right. I also like that there are various events to support teams and school organizations and I want to take part in those events but a 50% accuracy rate is not something I can tolerate much longer.

Usually complaining about their job, other staff, getting their hours cut, etc. Food sitting under the heating lamps, ten, fifteen minutes.  I actually went up and got it myself a couple times.  They know it's been sitting there because you will order something like salad or desert and they will tell you be careful ,the plate is hot.  This is, of course as you wait for the cooks to even start on it.  Standing around high giving each other.  Not a one of them has ever cooked a steak correctly. It appears they hire staff based solely on looks. Cheerleaders and jocks.  Bubbly and talk like they are Valley Girls.  They won't make eye contact, and it's not unusual to be ignored for 20 minutes at a time.  Then comes time for the check.  This is where they set the bar for utter incompetence-  I've sat there staring, STARING at someone ANYONE to take my card.  Even if they look at you, they stare through you.  The manager of all this (when the manager is even around) is about 21 and is usually just there to flirt with other staff members.   Every one of them over the years has been the same.

Given that the typical lunch hour is over, some of my negatives may have been mitigated during the rush.\\n\\nThat said, I found the lunch buffet to be very lacking.  There were less than 8 items on the buffet, and only 2 that were gluten-free (which is not something that I fault them for, just sharing), and items were not being refilled.  When the broccoli ran low, it was dumped into  1/2 of the rice tray, and the salad was empty for the entire time we were there.\\n\\nNow, I freely admit that I went for the Brazilian meat, not the broccoli, so I'll get to the important stuff.  Unfortunately, while the flavor of the spices was great on the garlic beef, every single piece of meat was super well done and chewy - the pork and the beef options both.\\n\\nI love 'hole in the wall' places and was so hoping this was going to be one for the books, but I'm fairly confident I won't give it a second shot.

I learned two things that day. First, I will never come here again and second, there are plenty of people here who have no idea what they are talking about. \\n\\nThe first thing I noticed about this place is it is not real Mexican. There were no Mexicans eating here. If a place is supposed to be authentic Mexican and there are absolutely no Mexicans eating there (or really any Spanish speaking people), that ought to tell you something. Also, in the back they had a Puerto Rican flag on the wall, not a Mexican flag. \\n\\nI was expecting this place to be jamming since it was 5/5. It was not busy at all. Yet despite this, it took forever to get drink and food orders (not only to get the order in, also to actually get it). I had to be a jerk a couple of occasions and actually interrupt the waitress/owner.\\n\\nYes the place is cheap, but the price is still not cheap enough to match the atmosphere. When I read 'plastic table cloths and authentic Mexican', I immediately thought of a high value $2/beer hole in the wall type of place. Beers were $4 and selection not too great (though they did have Negra Modelo, Modelo Especial, and of course Corona). The Sangria was pretty good, but not $20 for a small pitcher good. Come to think of it, I've never really had bad Sangria before. I had the 3 beef tacos for $5.75 deal. The beef was real but the tacos were cold. That salsa and chips were OK but not spicy/hot at all. \\n\\nAs far as the atmosphere, instead of authentic and traditional, I found it to be desperate and vaguely depressing. I read there was sometimes a mariachi. There was no mariachi tonight. If nothing on 5/5, I question if there ever actually was a mariachi. The music was playing so quietly and the woman working didn't seem very happy.

You can have a great location, the best services and the most stylish d√©cor but if the food sucks, you're going to fail. I wanted to try something different for my venture off the happy hour menu.  I had the Fried Chicken Double Down which was a pounded chicken breast, split and stuffed with ham.

Resurrected from the ashes and a bit cleaner than it once was, Trackside did not lose the vibe that won over a diverse cross-section of clientele before being gutted by fire in early '09.  With the exception of a few charred mementos of the old place, there's no sign of the devastating blaze that left so many of us socially homeless for a solid two and a half years.  Trackside is a dive bar with all the fixin's.  \\n\\nThere are a couple of pool tables that you can use without having to wait a month for your turn.  Quality dartboards are set up in a logical way that greatly reduces the likelihood of impaling a passing patron.  Ample flatscreen TVs are scattered conveniently about the walls that allow you to easily stay up to date on whatever sports may be in season, you're unlikely to be subjected to a belligerent fan screaming at a screen.  The bathrooms are great.  I mention this only because anyone who knew pre-fire Trackside will be blown away at the spacious, clean, fully-functional facilities.\\n\\nThe place is hoppin' when you'd expect, and the characters certainly qualify as one of the best elements in the experience, but you'll never have a hard time finding room, and service is always prompt and responsive.  Trackside clearly has a devoted gallery of regulars, and many of these folks are what make it so unique.  The chick covered in tattoos may just be a professor at Emory, while the grandfather on the other end of the bar plays lead guitar in a rock band and can drink you under the table.  Lawyers and doctors mix with Agnes Scott students, 20-somethings, and hospitality employees from other bars that don't stay open as late as Trackside, and are pleased to have found a place to do some serious post-work drinking, and the whole thing is watched over by the folks behind the bar, who are as knowledgeable as they are friendly.  It doesn't matter if you're a regular or this is your first time in Decatur - they'll take good care of you from your first stiff drink to your last, while happily calling a cab to get you safely home.  But why leave?  Trackside stays open late.\\n\\nThe food is what you expect at a dive bar.  The wings are good, the potatoes are fried, and the burgers are as filling as they are flavorful.  Since the re-opening, a few new items have crept onto the menu.  They have exotic-sounding dishes made mostly of green and vegetable matter - my wife called it a \\"salad.\\"  I haven't gotten that experimental yet, myself, but if you come to a place like this looking for foie gras or sushi, you're not paying attention.  The food goes well with beer, and that's the whole point.\\n\\nAside from the people, the best part is the booze.  The bar is stocked.  Rarely will you request a concoction that can not be provided.  The bartenders know how to mix a beverage - you will not be disappointed.  An excellent selection of tap beers is complimented by a healthy variety of bottles.  If you can't find something to drink at Trackside, you need to reexamine your life.\\n\\nParking is a breeze.  Trivia on Tuesday is at 7:30, the caller is great, and the competition is stiff, but fun.\\n\\nWhether you're looking for a comfortable watering-hole for a quick drink after work, or somewhere to go hide from the world while having some interesting conversations and several leisurely drinks, Trackside is what you seek."},{"name":"Wendy's","address":"355 Washington St","city":"Stoughton","stars":"2","text":"This location is plain and simple terrible, most of the time the food does not taste right, IF they even include your food... just today I bought a 4 for $4 meal with a jr. bacon burger, I get home and to my surprise I find the sandwich WITHOUT THE DAMN BURGER.

The service here is amazing, very attentive and they get little details down.  The hostess seemed to know who I was right as I walked in and also made sure to pronounce my name correctly.  She asked for the reason of our visit (anniversary) as well.  They also knew I was a first-time diner, so i'm sure they're keeping track of visit dates as well.\\n\\nWe started out with two cocktails, both were excellent but on the pricey side (minimum $10 no matter your selection).  We then moved to our table and our waiter instantly knew my name and the fact that it was our anniversary.  Our guy was a little off on his descriptions of the menu items (stumbled a few times), but I have to give him some slack since he basically has to memorize 20 different item descriptions.  He was very attentive and also swept any food crumbs off the table at various points throughout the night.\\n\\nThe food was excellent.  I had the sage-roasted pheasant with sweet potatoes, which was both filling AND extremely tasty.  We finished off the meal with a dessert (i forget what, something chocolate but that's not my thing) and they wrote \\"Happy Anniversary\\" on the plate, which was impressive.\\n\\nOther miscellaneous notes:\\n1. We were the only non-white people there that I could see.\\n\\n2. Dress was not strict, but mostly people were wearing a nice shirt and pants (guys) or a dress (women).  I don't think they would have kicked anyone out for not dressing up though.\\n\\n3. At one point, I felt like dining at places like this all the time would make me very Patrick Bateman/American Psycho-esque.  Reservations for Dorsia?\\n\\n\\n\\nI want to give it 5 stars, because it's probably the best restaurant I've dined in Atlanta... but the price is ridiculously expensive.  I already mentioned the cocktails, and the entrees were all minimum $27.  Desserts were all $8 too.  I spent a ton of money here.  I know that you have to pay for quality, and I do like this place a lot, but I just have to reserve 5-star reviews for restaurants which are amazing and have reasonable prices.\\n\\nAnother negative about this place is the valet parking.  Canoe is in a little mini-mini mall, and you have to valet your car.  This is common in Atlanta, but most of the time somewhat necessary because nice restaurants in the city are in the middle of high traffic areas with limited parking.  But in this case, the other shops next door are strict about not parking there, and the only parking lot for Canoe was literally right outside the door.  The parking was complimentary, but you obviously have to tip the guys for the valet.  This meant that I had to pay a tip to watch a man get in my car, close the door, and drive FIVE FEET and park it.  When I saw that, I was laughing my ass off.  Thanks, dude.  I gave him 3 bucks which isn't a lot but I computed a $0.60 tip/feet driven cost.\\n\\n\\nAnyway, 5 stars for food, service, atmosphere.  -1 star for the exorbitant prices and the ridiculous valet situation.  A very high quality 4 stars."},{"name":"Aviator Pizza & Drafthouse","address":"6501 S Congress Ave, Ste 1-105","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I went here with a friend and it was absolutely delicious.

That said, both the butcher and the fishmonger are worthwhile if you're planning to cook something special. The pasta maker is also worthwhile, both for the gnocchi and some of their sauces.\\n\\nAs for the food stands, I invariably head for Katzinger's, although both the Polish stand and the Vietnamese stand are worthwhile as well.

We each ordered a different flight of 6 beers for $12 each (Brewer's Choice and Classic tray,) and did a little tasting session between the two of us. The beers tended to run on the lighter, less roasty side, but they had a wide range of flavors - Some very unique hoppy beers, and a couple particularly odd fruit beers. As with all beer flights, you won't dig every flavor, but with such a large beer list, you're gonna find something you like (given you have a credit card, hours of time, and a completely wrecked liver.)\\n\\nThe truffle fries ($8.25) we ordered was a huge portion and amazingly delicious, but the flavors were so strong, they overpowered the beers as the tasting proceeded.

So far I've had the sea bass and tuna, both were excellent. The pork carnita tacos are also really good. I had the shrimp kabobs one time, they're packed tightly with shrimp and vegetables.\\n\\nWhat I like about this place is you can substitute a salad instead of rice & beans for no charge. I'm trying to eat a little healthier, so grilled fish + salad is just about as healthy as you can get for a 30 minute lunch. \\n\\nThe owner is a good guy, but may come off as a little gruff to first time visitors. I've never seen him be rude to anyone, but he is balancing being a good host and getting people served as quickly as possible. When the lunch rush has died down, he'll go around and make sure everyone is enjoying their meal. You can see it means a lot to him when people tell him his food is so good.\\n\\n\\nIn keeping with my other reviews, I'll talk about the heat potential of the food. They do have a spicy sauce, which has an excellent flavor, but the spiciness is akin to tabasco or sriracha. I like to dump it on my food as it has a great taste to it.\\n\\nAs far as heat potential goes, on a scale of 1-10, 1 being a bowl of rice and 10 being a Chilean Gaucho's branding iron, I'd give Sausalito's a 4."},{"name":"First Printer","address":"13-15 Dunster St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"I've come here a few times since it opened and always had a good experience, as have my dining and/or drinking compatriots.

Or rather the taste of the food still hasn't left my mouth and I find it slightly disconcerting.\\n\\nOne of my friends just turned the dirty 30 and had been wanting to go to hibachi forever for her birthday. We kept it quiet and ended up surprising her yesterday evening with just what she wanted - hibachi. \\n\\nIt was my first time going to anything even remotely like this, so that part of it was pretty neat. We got hit with a bad snow storm yesterday and they were still open and accommodating to our party of 7. (You should read that as: The place was absolutely dead and we didn't share our table with anyone else) \\n\\nOur chef was mildly entertaining, even if I was not prepared to let him throw food, or squirt anything into my mouth. Just.. no. I found myself contemplating just how filthy the top of the stove he cooked on was. I mean.. how often do they clean those things? I watched the food cook and it started to make me feel a bit queasy. \\n\\nThe shrimp I ordered was done first, and it tasted a bit like rubber. A few minutes later the vegetables were done and then the bean sprouts. Everything cooked at it's own pace causing everything else to get cold by the time came to eat it all together. During this time the waitress never came back to check on us, and I was dying for another beer.. or water.. or anything liquid (except for what he wanted to squirt in my mouth.. remember.. no..) since you had to ask for water. \\n\\nAfter he finished cooking he just wiped down the grill and moved on. I really hope they do more extensive cleaning between guests...\\n\\nSince it was our friends birthday she got her meal complimentary after showing them her ID. She also got a completely out of tune birthday song sung to her, at the expense of my eardrum that had the gong right next to it. \\n\\nThe positives? It was a good atmosphere for a large party. They comped her meal and gave her a free piece of cheesecake. We also brought our own cake that they gave us plates for, and even let us goof around exchanging gifts. They however did take forever to bring the check then even longer to ring it up. \\n\\nI still can't quite shake the bad chemical taste the food left in my mouth, even a full 24 hours later. My girlfriend hasn't stopped talking about how whatever she eats has a plastic chicken taste to it. So I guess we won't be going back there. \\n\\nOverall? Expensive.

The food is not oily, greasy or rich. It is simple and something I would eat @ home back in India. The choice of dishes and flavors are good. I like eating here for lunch because I can have Indian food and not feel sleepy thereafter. \\n\\nMP is predominantly a South Indian restaurant. Most Indian buffets here in Austin are heavy on North Indian dishes. MP is a South Indian buffet and as a result their attempts @ making North Indian food are lame at best but I don't go there to eat Saag Paneer and Naan, I go there to eat their curd rice, lentils, vaadas, idlis and dosas which are all South Indian dishes. Because their cuisine is South Indian based, it tends be less greasy and more rice based. Some might find their food a little too soupy/flowy because it is meant to go with rice. \\n\\n\\nI do have a couple of suggestions for management if they are reading this, since they wanted their customers to yelp, so here it is.\\n\\n-Bring back Papadam.\\n\\n-Make mini dosas & uthapams and put them in the buffet. I think offering free\\nregular size dosa for buffet customers can't be cost effective.\\n\\n-Avoid Indo-Chinese fusion dishes like the sweet & sour machurian. Instead replace it with some authentic South Indian dish.\\n\\n- Don't add mushrooms to Indian vegetable dishes. Mushrooms do not belong\\nin Indian cuisine. I know this is America and you are trying to blend in, but please\\nMushrooms belong on a Pizza, not in an Indian curry. \\n\\n-You guys need to educate the non-Indian folks about South Indian cuisine. You are competing with the likes of Bombay Bistro (a few blocks away), Tarka etc who specialize in N. Indian food. So when non-Indians come waltzing in here they need to know not to compare your Saag Paneer to theirs. I would suggest you take it out of your menu and educate Austin about good South Indian food which you are so good at fixing.\\n\\n\\n-I see Food Network shows regularly and if Robert Irvine (Restaurant Impossible), Gordon Ramsey (Hell's Kitchen) were to visit your place they would tell you to stay true to your roots. Serve the best South Indian food, let the other 99 Indian restaurants keep serving North Indian food.\\n\\n\\n~A loyal MP customer."},{"name":"Bukowski Tavern","address":"1281 Cambridge St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3","text":"I'm really amazed at the reviews on this place, since they all seem to complain about the service.

Your cell phone deactivates the key, so if at close range, you need your key reactivated. you have to always be cautious about it because it's such an subconscious thing. wifi is only in public areas, such as the lobby. To have wifi in your room its and additional $12.95 for the first day and the rates gets higher for any additional day. Thats not enough to take away any stars from this place though.

How you can screw up beans from a can is beyond me.\\n\\nI pay extra every time for sour cream, but you could flip a coin on whether or not I'm going to get it. I don't like getting ripped off but when you short me on orders for the kids and now I've got upset kids because someone is missing a couple of tacos, then ripping me off becomes a big problem. Will I still go? Yes, begrudgingly but I will check each and every item, and I will go in...no more drive through because you guys have consistently proven you can't be trusted. \\n\\nI've lived for quite a while with taco bells close to my places more than once and I have to say this is the worst taco bell ever. Avoid it and steer the kids elsewhere if you can help it or be diligent and check every thing in your order.

How do I know? I went there today for the very first time in my life, and had the best eating out experience I've had in a looooong time. It's funny because although I've lived. 2 blocks away for almost a year I never really noticed it until recently (I guess due to all the new renovations they done that took it from drab to FAB). So I decided to finally try it. You know when you go into a place you've never tried before, and you're kind of confused about what to try? I hate that feeling! Lucky for me I when I asked the gal behind the counter which of the sauces were healthiest. She told me, and turned around to ask a guy in the back for. A second opinion and he came right over. Turns out he was one of the new owners. I told him it was my first time, and he flew into super helpful guy mode. He was sooo sweet and adorable! Regrettably, I didn't catch his name, but there's always next time (I will def be back). He told me all about how the menu works, explained every,Ast detail, and even showed me some of the new renovations they've done. He is so passionate and excited about his product, which to me is ALWAYS a great sign! Complacency is a real bitch, and she'll get you every single time! None to be. Found over here... I still wasn't totally sure what I wanted (I'm admittedly indecisive to a fault) but knew I wanted something healthy. He told me don't worry about it, he'll hook me up. And he made me the most awesomest wrap I've had in forever! They have amazing fresh Tzatziki sauce and they even put the veggies for the wrap on a grill !!  VEGGIES FOR THE WRAP ON THE GRILL!!!! WITH THEIR SECRET SAUCE!!!! DO YOU EVEN UNDERSTAND HOW EPIC THAT IS?!???? AND it's healthy? AND they have whole wheat pitas?!? AND you can customize it so many ways you could probably eat their every day for a year and not repeat yourself?? AND they have smoothies??? I think I died and went to fast and healthy Heaven...

I show up the next day for brunch with a friend and her dog and the waiter came out to us to inform us that they weren't serving on the patio and that he was afraid of dogs and didn't want to come near us.  And this was not five minutes after I had just called while sitting on the patio and spoke to the hostess who said it was fine to be on the patio and that someone would be out shortly.  The waiter said that he'd be willing to make a \\"special exception\\" for us, but after the reception we got we couldn't get out of that place fast enough.  I will never go there again.  It would be one thing if we just showed up assuming we'd be served on the patio with our dogs, but I called not once, but twice to confirm this and then was treated as if my business was a major inconvenience.  This is not the way to run a business."},{"name":"Dai Due","address":"2406 Manor Rd, Ste A","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Holy Moly, what an adorable spot!

Plantains are a crap shoot to cook in advance as they tend to get tough, my lunch was no exception. Jerk chicken was spicy and very little said \\"jerk\\" besides the name. I was very happy with the quality of the mixed veggies though! Broccoli and beans are bright green and were crisp, tender. I added the Cajun with the jambalaya...it was really spicy just spicy fried  rice with chicken...wasted space.\\nThen, bourbon chicken? What the hay?

Rustic Kitchen offers a warm and cozy ambience with friendly and attentive service.  My friends and I had an early dinner on a Friday night at the Park Square location.  We started off with some arancini (rice balls), which were excellent.  I had previously tried the Pasta and Clams entree at the Hingham Derby Street location and was sadly disappointed, so I opted for something different, the Wild Boar Ragu with Pappardelle.  The pappardelle pasta was a little too thin, but fresh, and the wild boar was much tougher than I expected for something that was slow cooked.  However, the flavors of the dish were good.  We ended the night sharing a trio of desserts, Black Bottom Creme Brulee, Warm Chocolate Cake, and Tiramasu.  The creme brulee was smooth, but a little runny.  The chocolate cake was decadent but had the consistency of half-cooked cake batter than actual cake.  I'm a big fan of chocolate molten cakes which tend to be extremely moist and fudge-like, but this wasn't the case.
