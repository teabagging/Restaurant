The burger tasted okay definitely nothing special here. The fries weren't anything to write home about. The salad bar is where you go to dress your burger and get a salad.

Just one thing... there was absolutely no chicken in the dish.  We actually didn't even notice until we had both finished and then realized it.  \\n\\nHalf portions are absolutely the way to go for me.  I could not imagine having a full portion of these pasta dishes as I would be eating it for the next three days.  Also, sharing dishes is the way to go if you are on a bit of a budget.

Sure. My friend asked for lemon and simply never got it. \\n\\n5) The waitress (the 2nd one) got one of my friend's orders mixed up - she had ordered scrambled and got over-easy instead.

When we went back here, nothing much had changed. There was still ample outdoor seating placed in the same arrangement three years prior. Service was good, but not phenomenal. There were more tea options than we expected, so that was a nice surprise. I got the blueberry green tea, which was a bit too sweet for my taste. The blueberry flavor was strong, but almost too much so to the point of being overwhelming. The view was gorgeous (we were three during sunset), and the place was packed. Finally, mozarts has managed to regulate the temperature inside. I remember my undergrad days and the temperature indoors was constantly fluctuating; it would be sweltering one day and Siberia the next. As such, it was nice to know they finally got the temperature under control. It wasn't night yet, but I wondered if they still had their string lights up. They would reflect off the lake and make the place feel magical and somewhat surreal. Sad we weren't able to stay long enough to see that. All in all, mozarts is a great place to go hang out with friends and get a cup of joe. Studying there is okay if you can manage to ignore the noise, or if you go in the middle of the day on a weekday.

One of my friends mentioned that he had been to a Barcelona location in another state so we were eagerly anticpating this restaurant opening.  We sat on the patio on a gorgeous autumn evening.  The restaurant is half a large bar (left side) and half dining room (right side) with a large open kitchen, along with patio outdoor seating bordering the entire restaurant.  It also looked like there was an outdoor bar and fireplace/firepit, which was not open while I was there  The decor was great- rustic woods, iron or iron-like accents, floor to ceiling dark wood cutout dividing the space, large chalkboards with the wine specials and a drawing of a pig (they have charcuterie & cheeses).  By the way, the bathroom has soft lighting, which makes my skin look great!\\n\\nThe menu consists of a variety of tapas, appetizers, salads, entrees, and some \\"per person\\" meals of mixed grill and paella that look wonderfully delicious.  We tried empanadas with fresh guacamole, figs & chorizo skewers, endive & arugula salad, and short ribs entree.  All had great flavors, were generous portions, and wonderfully presented....can't wait to go back to try different tapas.  The fresh crusty bread and oilve oil brought to the table was also a highlight.  We also tried dulce de leche crepes and a chocolate hazelnut molten cake for dessert- both were pretty good, and generous sizes as well.  Large wine list of many wines...they even had wine flights that looked pretty tempting.\\n\\nPrices are very reasonable- under $10 for most tapas, and around the $20-27 mark for entrees.  Barcelona is located on the corner plot where Zaya used to be.  They have complimentary valet parking, which is great b/c it can be tough to find parking in this area at times.

The turkey was surprisingly moist and had a slightly smoky flavor, but it wasn't anything amazing. The brisket was VERY dry and had very little flavor. I know there are the fatty and dry pieces of brisket, but the brisket was so dry it was ridiculous. I ended up putting it on the bread and piling stuff like jalapenos and pickles on it so I could finish it. The rib was amazing--it fell off the bone, was amazingly caramelized, and was delicious even without the sauce.\\n\\nThe sides were ok. I really liked the coleslaw, but it's not the mayo-y stuff you might be used to. The potato salad was alright, but kind of weird--not German potato salad, but not mayo based either. The pickles were homemade, not soggy and with a great garlic taste. The beans were alright. I did like that they weren't sweet baked beans. The sauce was \\"interesting\\"--not bad, but not something I would seek out.\\n\\nBasically I'm giving 2 stars just for the ribs. The other pros are canceled out by screwing up something as basic as brisket. I was also unimpressed by the terrible service we got, from a server who said she would get us silverware and never did (I should NOT have to walk up to the pit 10 minutes after getting my food and ask where I go to get silverware), to a waitress that didn't bother to check on us or refill our drinks.

I felt the pan fried dumplings were better.\\n\\n3 cup chicken was very flavorful, I was expecting total sweetness but it had a little spice to it so that pleased the taste buds.  The downfall to this dish is the chicken is not boneless.  \\n\\nProbably not a good 'first date' selection since you are constantly trying to get small bits of bone out of your mouth.  Unless of course, it is a bad date and you want to scare her off quickly.  However, the bone picken is worth the effort.\\n\\nThe pork in hot garlic sauce was pretty tasty, but not so much hot as the oil flavor overwhelmed it a bit (sesame oil?).  \\n\\nThe dry rubbed green beans were great.  I don't know how they made them, I am assuming garlic and soy sauce was in it, and maybe some scallions.  They were killer.\\n\\nThe best was the fish in hot oil.  Amazing.

The restaurant appeared to be a little more high end with several outdoor dining and a nice interior decor. Took about 10 minutes to get seated but was not so packed. Several of the servers were kind of nice but one had some attitude towards my brother. To begin with appetizers, we ordered the waffle with the topping of white chocolate pistachio. After a 30-45 minute wait, it turned out that they never took the order. There was another server who wasn't even ours(Asian male) forgot his name, that tended to our needs and made sure we finally got that order. The other workers just sucked honestly. Disappointed in the service. Once they finally brought out the waffle, they gave the wrong dip. Whatever, the Asian male server gladly put that order on the house. Besides that, there was this other server that had the nerve to say that the waffles was supposed to be coming last like a dessert. That made no sense when our other party received all of their waffles before their entree(nice excuse ladies). Anyways, I decided to try out the duvel Belgian ale which was pretty taste. For my main dish, I paired my drink with a fricassee which composed of braised short ribs, balsamic cipollini onions, potatoes, watercress, fried eggs, applewood smoked cheddar served with a piece of bread.

As a HUGE fan of this winery, I quickly became excited over it, but their listing price was $94/bottle, and I knew that was well over twice the retail price.  Then I had the sudden urge to bring our own bottle of wine to the restaurant instead, something that I had never tried in the past.  I asked the restaurant if they allowed patrons to bring their own wine, and if they did, what was the corkage fee.  The fee was $25, a bit higher than normal if you ask me.  So I decide to head over to Seiyo, which was right around the corner, and picked up a nice French bottle of cab as well as a bottle of the Gary Ferrell Chardonnay!\\n\\nHeading to the restaurant was simple enough, taking the orange line to the State Street station, and then about a five-minute walk from there.

As we enter, they have our reservations ready for us and kindly check our coats.  The restaurant has several floors to it, each floor offering different aspects of the establishment.

It's got some pluses and minuses, but the pluses eventually outweigh the minuses.\\n\\nA bunch of fun and exciting Yelpers converged upon Harvard Gardens after our original destination's wait was too long.  After a walk that included the sighting of an intramural Quidditch match (there should be more of these, but that's another discussion for another day), we arrived at Harvard Gardens, ready to have some grub.\\n\\nConsidering that it was relatively quiet, the staff was ready, able, and willing to sit our larger group, and with a major assist from the group sitting next to us (who moved over, and given the opportunity, I would give 5 stars to), we all plopped down, ready to eat and drink.  \\n\\nOn the drinks, I ended up with a mimosa, which was quite good (the OJ and champagne mixed quite well).  The waiter was also quick to check and confirm that the pear bellini was not available.  A little inconvenient, considering it's on the menu, but the fact he checked before he finished the drink orders was a plus.  On the downside, after that point and the food orders, we didn't see much of our waiter.  I didn't get my water refilled until after I had started on the food.  Not the worst thing in the world, but still not ideal.\\n\\nAs for the food, it was right on target.  I ordered the omelet with homefries and bacon and toast.   This resulted in getting a good amount of homefries and bacon, and a decently sized omelet.  As for the taste itself, the omelet was good, not the greatest I've ever had, but very good nonetheless, and the bacon was a little tough for my own desire.  The homefries, however, were amazing.  They were little potato wedges, and not only were they well-seasoned, they were generally yummy.\\n\\nOverall, I'm waffling between 3 and 4 stars.  It's not the most exquisite brunch I've had in the course of the series (Gaslight wins that), but I'd put it in second place as of now.  While I kind of wish the server was around a little bit more, I can understand, and the fact that they did a good job of fitting us all in without a reservation merits that 4th star."},{"name":"Mozart's Coffee Roasters","address":"3825 Lake Austin Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I don't really know what to say about Mozart's.

Overall the flavors have changed a little since I've been here last but it was still good. This review is about the SERVICE. \\n\\nThe servers have changed throughout the years, which is natural. However, the service is usually good and reasonable. The night I ate here with my family, we had a horrible experience. As usual, there were 2 servers. They were lagging behind so badly, that although they have 3 tables open, Thy would not seat customers that were waiting. It's a small restaurant so usually there is a wait but that night there really wasn't a reason to have one. Anyway, our service was extremely slow and didn't ever come by to ask how we were doing or refill or drinks. It was either the other server refilling our drinks or we would have to ask. When it came time for payment, my father in law set cash down and said no change. Within 5 minutes of her grabbing our check, she came back and asked my father in law for more tip. He had already tipped her 15% but she started to say it wasn't 18% and how he needed to give more. We told her that she wasn't the best that night was it was reflective on her service. She kept on pointing to her top chart and would not leave. After he gave an extra amount that was over 18% (pre tax) she said \\"well it's not exactly 18%, but that's okay\\" and walked away. Astounded, we spoke loudly about what happened and walked out. \\n\\nI can not believe that she had the audacity to ask for more and wouldn't leave until we did.

I complained to Omni but no one seemed to care, especially since I booked through hotels.com, at least it seemed so to me. I won't ever stay at an Omni hotel again because this shows me how they do business overall, squeezing every penny out of a tired hotel that clearly needs updating.

There is no doubt that the pizza is at least good.  It has a unique taste.  The service is excellente, magnificiento, bueno and all that good stuff.  My gripe, my beef, my issue.... - the price.  At face value, the pizza is very good but $23??  Did I just type that out right..- $23???  When I think of 23 - I think of Michael Jordan.  When I think of 23 - I think of the famous soccer player David Beckham.  When I think of 23, I think of it as a powerful prime number.  There's nothing powerful about buying a $23 pie except the damage it does to your wallet.  When I think of 23, I think of that Jim Carrey film from 2007 (or 2008), i can't remember exactly the year while writing this review.  When I think of 23 - I think of Lebron James Number he wore in Cleveland.  But just like his #23, makes me wanna arson that pizza box for the price.\\n\\nThat's not even the half of it.  The parking situation is TERRIBLE!  I mean no where to park on the street.  Most neighborhood's driveways is larger than their parking lot across the street or behind the building.  It is an absolute joke.  No one is knocking the service - that staff is friendly.  A little too friendly.  They do a good job, very good workers.  \\n\\nI guess in Atlanta's terms as far as quality of pizza, I can see why most people would at least put 4 stars (which is reasonable) and those who put 5 stars on their reviews are probably on that narcotic or bath salts.  When it comes to pizza pies, my advice is to review users who are originally from the Chicago area or the NYC area.  I have read reviews over the years from different people and the up north are most honest when it comes to pizza than any other food that exists.  So whoever rates Antico a 4/5 more than likely is not from Chicago or NY area.  They kinda over appraise the experience.  Put extras and accessories on it. That's the thing about Yelp, as much as I trust the reviews before I deep sea dive into an establishment I a) evaluate \\"who\\" is doing the review b) \\"where\\" that review person is originally from.  No offense to my Yelpers that grade pizza but lot of ppl overrate the turkey stuffing out of these pizza reviews. I mean $23 shouldn't be the cost of a medium pizza (as far as up north standards).  A larger pizza at better quality is almost $10 less - easily!!!  My bad, I'm still stuck on that twenty three theme!  If Yelp ever went to subjects for reviews, the title of this review would be 23.  \\n\\nPizza comes out in 5 minutes.  Pretty quick for a pie.  Potential red flag.  I would have to see what the hell they doing back there for a pizza to come out that fast.  I will say that it is a nice crowd.  Good looking people come to the spot.  Very diverse group of people come here to get their pie on!\\n\\nGrade: C (it's not because of the food or the service, it's because of the totality of everything around that)"},{"name":"Universal Orlando Resort","address":"6000 Universal Studios Plz","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"I had a GREAT time here today!!!

Our 3-course meal unfortunately didn't hold up to my expectations.  The seafood gumbo was just okay and the color was kinda funky.  The entrees and side were all bathed in butter.  Don't get me wrong, I love butter, but I think you can make a really good steak without that much heart-stopping butter.  As I told Deb K, I have had better steaks at Texas Roadhouse and better creamed spinach at Boston Market!!!  The steak didn't have much flavor except butter and um butter.  And my first bite of the steak was scary.  It almost tasted like the meat had gone bad.  The rest of the steak was fine, but it just didn't bowl me over like other good steaks I have had at S&W or other fine steakhouses.  Even I have made better steaks . . . \\n\\nFinally, the Chocolate Mousse dessert was a sweet ending to a big meal.  Again, though it tasted pretty good, I was expecting a high quality dessert from this fancy schmancy steak chain.  (Ever have Morton's chocolate cake???? To die for!)

Pad thai is pretty standard and I enjoy the dish here. It's pretty average compared to the rest of the thai restaurants. The portion size is not bad. The curry-based dishes here are good. Curry chicken panang pairs incredibly well with rice and you can't go wrong with this option. \\n\\nIf I were you, I'd order some of the other, non-standard dishes. I hope to try some of these during my next visit! For example, the pad kee mow here is really good, and I think it's miles better than some of the other competitor restaurants.\\n\\nThai fried rice is where things go a bit downhill. Compared to some of the other restaurants, this is definitely lacking. Sure the prices are cheaper, but the quality is significantly lower. The chicken that the dish came with was slightly undercooked and it came with two slices of lazily cut tomatoes (quarters). The amount served was not bad but the food just lacked too much taste. Sure this is probably not the best choice on the menu, but something this basic I expected better execution.\\n\\nService is a little slow, however water service is good.

(Picture is now posted, I had to do so on my laptop) I am a fairly new vegetarian so I opted for the spinach ravioli meal.  My friend and I were very hungry and it was our first time patronizing this establishment.  We specifically asked the server about the portion sizes and he motioned his hands to give an idea of the portions and we were satisfied with that.  For wine, I prefer sweet wines but my friend likes reds so she asked the server if they had any red wines that were sweet.  He proceeded to say yes, but that type was unavailable for sampling and had to be purchased by the bottle.  This should have been the first red flag, but my friend agreed to try it out.  The wine was NOT sweet, not even to her so that was an epic fail.  So we get a $10 bottle of wine for over $20 and it wasn't even good. I know restaurants mark up alcohol prices but good grief. (I googled the amount of the wine after we left and sure enough it was about $10) Now for the good part, I ordered an entree size of the spinach ravioli, why do I get a plate with 3 or 4 ravioli on it?  To add insult to injury, the ravioli was extremely flat so it's not like they were large and heavily stuffed with spinach.  I asked the server was that the entree size, he said yes.  I asked how many come with the appetizer size, he said two.  Are you kidding me?  I am a petite woman and that wasn't enough for me, I could only imagine the look on the face of a grown man ordering that.  It was really like a kiddie meal, no full sized adult would get anywhere near full off of that.  For $20, I was very disappointed in that dish.  We could have just saved the fluff and went to Magianno's where I would have paid about $12 for my meal and been able to bring leftovers home.

We all ordered the family style bbq dinner, which was about $15/person.  I thought that was a good value considering the mass quantities we consumed.\\n\\nPros: \\n~tons of meat (brisket, ribs, sausage)  They just kept bringing more plates full.\\n~good bread.  It was heavier than the whitebread you usually get at a bq place.  I think it was homemade.\\n~neat atmosphere and pretty drive.  if you like rustic and scenic, it's perfect.\\n~BYOB\\n~doggie bag.  Even though it's all you can eat, they pack up the leftovers for you to take home.  \\n\\nCons: \\n~side dishes were really mediocre.  I'm not crazy about slaw and potato salad, but these were on the low end, I think.\\n\\nNote:\\nThe sauce here is unusual.  It looks like honey mustard when you see it in the bottle on the table.

We had the calamari, prosciutto, rollatini, scallops,  and mushroom starters. My only complaint were the scallops - they were very small, almost too small to really capture the flavor.

Masitas: Fried chunks of pork in a delicious mojo sauce. This was everything I hoped it would be. Especially that mojo sauce.\\n2. Lengua en Salsa: I knew this was going to be a winner right when I saw it. Tongue is friggin' awesome when done correctly and Pambiche is already known to do everything correctly. The lengua was tender without being mushy and completely full of flavor. the salsa just elevated it to perfection.\\n3. Medianoche: Got a thing for that classic porky, cheesy, pickley, mustardy, crunchy sandwich. Theirs does not disappoint. Just what I was lookin' for. We split this three ways and it was enjoyed by all.\\n4.Tostones: Fried green plantains. Rather light on flavor by themselves, very nice with the sauce that accompanies.\\n\\nDessert (Postre):\\n1.

I am so sad that I did not have a good experience, I hope if I ever do try to go back it will be better...I can't even tell you how the food was, this is based solely on service.\\n\\nI went on my short break from work to buy a gift certificate and grab a quick bite to go. it was mid day during the week, there were three tables in various stages of being served and eating when I arrived. There were two servers. The gentleman that finally came to assist me seemed a bit \\"put out\\" to have to sell me a gift card, and I felt rushed when trying to scan the menu I have never seen before to order some take out. He made me pay for the take out and gift certificate separately, which was awkward. I decided to order the sweet potato quesadilla, figuring it was simple and quick and it came highly recommended by some people I know. Well I sat down, forgetting my phone in my car I did not have the time, but I felt like I was sitting there forever....the servers did not acknowledge me after the point of ordering. Finally someone I figured is a manager/owner came out on his phone, paused to ask if I was being helped and yelled to the kitchen. I thought, oh good now I can get my food and go back to work. Nope, I kept sitting there and finally got up to ask the server who TOOK the order where it was. Mind you by this time TWO of the THREE tables in the restaurant have LEFT, this is a small restaurant as well, its not like they couldn't see me sitting by the entrance. I am a very patient person, but are you telling me a quesadilla takes so long to make? When I did get up to ask, I finally checked their clock, I had been sitting there for 30 MINUTES, yes I guess it was my own fault to be so dumb and sit there hoping that when they came from the kitchen and stared at me blankly that someone would remember my order, especially ...if I failed to mention, the server WHO TOOK THE ORDER. I guess I also must be dumb to expect when the aforementioned manager/owner check with them about my order that they would have remembered, but nope.... So, remaining calm, I asked them about it, told them I have to get back to work....I look into kitchen, the cook didn't even make it, DIDN'T MAKE IT, 30 minutes!!!!! REALLY? Now I feel like a total idiot. I told them if they didn't have it made I didn't want it, they said no it is made, I can see the cook making it as they tell me. I should have asked for my money back, especially since when they hand it over to me with a half assed apology, I am late back to work and had no time to eat it. So it sat there, got cold and I did not get to eat anything that day during my break or get to enjoy the damn thing that I wasted almost 10 dollars on. I wanted to even return the gift certificate...why would I give someone a gc to a place like that. Maybe I wasn't vegetarian/Vegan looking enough for them or something! And it can't be because I didn't tip the waiter for taking the order, because I always do so when they bring me the food, so it was his loss..\\nI am sure the food is beyond spectacular there, really, so I am not writing this to say it is not, but sometimes the service is equally important, and it just wasn't there, the experience was horrible....to just get some take out shouldn't make a person be late for work and upset and aggravated about the experience. Very sad."},{"name":"Burger Tex","address":"5420 Airport Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"I remember Big Tex Steakhouse from many years ago which was at this location. I still have fond memories of it. Not being a big burger fan (pretty ordinary food that I can make) I didn't really want to go here much. However,  on impulse I gave it a try and think it's really good. It's not fancy at all and in fact, is very casual. I would say you get good value for the money here. \\n\\nLike others, I liked the sweet potato fries and the fresh condiment bar that you can help yourself to. If you are an old hipster like me, the condiment bar will make you think of Burger Chef, a good chain that sadly went out of business. I loved getting the teeny burgers there and making a sandwich that looked like an accordion with all the veggies stuffed in there!

You can sit and watch the beach from your table.  You can't beat the view.  I ordered the Greek salad with chicken.  The meat was really high quality with a great herb flavor.  Vegetables were so fresh and crispy.  DH got the Lamb special, which was a huge portion.  He said the lamb was tasty and so tender.  Eating keto so couldn't try the rice.  The kids had pepperoni pizza and Santorini pizza.  They said it was yummy and fought over who would get the last piece.  This would be such a great place to get food for the office or catering.

The beer selection is great, I can almost always grab a seat at the bar, and they have this pizza on the menu that I love. I'm actually surprised no one has mentioned it in the reviews I've read, because I order it every time I go. It's the butternut squash and fontina pizza and it's strangely divine! \\n\\nI most recently hit up this place on Saturday afternoon, after lunch and before the dinner rush. There were only a few regulars in there, so my friend and I saddled up to the bar just as the Sox/Skankees game started. I have forgotten the bartender's name, but he was great for two important reasons:\\n1. Knowing how to make small talk. He offered just the right amount without being overbearing. Too often in Boston I get bartenders who only offer a grunt or a head nod and aren't able to make any well-educated recommendations. This guy knew his menu as well as the well-selected background music that was playing and he occasionally dropped into our conversation to offer up something interesting. A+ for people skills.\\n2. Attentive service. He refilled my beer and water glass at just the right times, made some stiff drinks for my whiskey-loving friend, and was generally pleasant and accommodating. \\n\\nI can't speak to how this place gets late night (and judging from the reviews by other Yelpers, it probably wouldn't be my cup of tea), but for me it's great for late afternoon and after work drinks.

First of all we went there right around dinner time and there was literally only one car in the parking lot...bad sign. We went ahead anyway because of the 4 stars on yelp. Service was okay but the server was not very clean. The decor is mixed - some of traditional Indian but with some weird nautical mix which seems like leftovers from previous tenants like a fish and chips place or something. Both of our waters had little particles in them. Asked for a new one but it was much the same so probably is from their source of water. We both ordered the Korma curry with paneer. While it was served rather fast, it was not great quality. It was very pasty and somehow seemed pre-prepared and just warmed up. The paneer was very bland compared to other places.

I have tried the Greek food, the home style side items and the salads.  As mentioned by other reviewers our favorite is the trio $8,99, where you select half a sandwich, wrap or panini then a soup and salad option.  My husband prefers the prepared pasta salad choices and I usually get the salad where you choose the items and they toss it for you or the fresh fruit cup.  I am not sure what they do but the salad here always is tastier than the ones I make at home with the same ingredients.\\n\\nYou can get in and out of this place in no time and the food is kept fresh.  I generally see the same professional people working there and the service is good.  You fill you own soda or tea and there are some different choices including a Keurig coffee and bottled teas and waters located in a case near the front door.  \\n\\nBesides the food and the convenience,  the restaurant is always clean and the tables are comfortable.

The fish first - a bit dry and not a lot of fish ( 1 small piece actually), I used the Olivia sauce on all three ( and damn that stuff is good!) which gave it the flavor it was missing. Next the chicken, a bit more meat than the fish had, still a bit dry and in need of a flavor boost ( again, thank god for Olivia)The beef is what gave them three stars - over flowing taco, moist, flavorful , almost didn't need the sauce.

We did want to try the seafood paella, but seemed a bit pricey, $24.50 per person. We don't mind splurging on food, but getting that on top of our already large selection would of been insane. Possibly return just to try the paella.

Alborz has, hands down, my favorite lunch buffet ANYWHERE. They have your standard kabobs and cooked chicken, but where it really stands out is the stews. Persian cuisine is partially known for it's think and hearty stews which take hours and hours to prepare and alborz makes them perfectly. Their ghormeh sabzi, Bademjan, Khoreshe Karafs, and Khoresh Gheymeh are all incredible and all available on the lunch buffet. I usually get some of each of these incredible stews along with tabouli and  Shirazi Salad and have some fresh watermelon for desert. Its about $10 for the buffet and worth every penny. \\n\\nFor dinner, I prefer the stews but they also have a baked salmon which is incredible as is the lamb.

The summary review from the group is as follows:\\n\\nFood 4 stars\\nService 4 stars\\nD√©cor 4 stars\\nOverall 4 stars\\n\\n(also voted a \\"favorite\\" among the 170+ places we have eaten)\\n\\nDespite its FF Favorite-earning scores, often hampered by \\"if only\\" or \\"but.\\" Ultimately everyone agreed that you can't go too wrong with pork as it's, well, pork, but quibbles include the menu having \\"not a ton of selection\\" and \\"no interesting pairings\\" between the cheese, pork, and liquor/beers. What The Salty Pig lacked in selection, it was more than compensated for by the atmosphere of the place. Multiple reviewers mentioned they were impressed with the atmosphere and found it be fun and inviting. Some were upset by the loud music\\n\\nFull unedited reviews below:\\n\\n\\"I had this place built up to such high expectations going in that I was destined to be disappointed, but I ended up being surprised because it blew my already high expectations out of the water. I found the food to be particularly outstanding. I shared a small chacuterie plate for an app. and the Salty Pig pizza was truly unique and wonderful. I loved the interior as it was fun, socially engaging, clean, and just made me want to smile. I will be going back. definitely.\\"\\n\\n\\"Meat and Cheese... How could you go wrong? I thoroughly enjoyed the charcuterie board that I had as my meal. I was definitely jazzed to see the Robiola on the cheese list. It is delish and a cheese favourite! I definitely want to return and try out some of the other fare. Everything on the table looked so tasty. Service for a Friday night was quite attentive and the waitstaff was certainly pleasant. D√©cor was fun and made use of an unique space, especially the Far Side wallpapered lavatories. I also appreciated the 90's on 9 - esque soundtrack to the evening. So good to see that a space that housed the tragic 6Burner, has turned itself around.\\"\\n\\n\\"I had the same worry as others that it would be hipster central, but actually everyone from the staff to the patrons was really friendly. the food is good and exactly what they say -- salty pig parts and stuff to go with them (so you have to be in the mood for that, it's not a place for vegetarians!), and the industrial-geek-chic decor from the equations on the walls, to the cool lighting, to bathrooms plastered with \\"Far Side\\" cartoons was fun and inviting. Overall, both trendy AND comfortable - a hard mix to pull off.\\"\\n\\n\\"I was hoping for more options on the main dish menu ( I think there were 4 options), and I wish pork was featured more prominently and just incorporated into the dishes. That being said, my entree was tasty but not spectacular. The lettuce wrap app was so-so. I tried some of Greg's pizza and it was really good. I'll likely go back and try some items from the charcuterie side of the menu.\\"\\n\\n\\"Do you know what's wrong with pork? Absolutely nothing! I love salty cured meat. I live for stinky cheese. I just didn't see any interesting enough on the menu to want to eat and, this is my hang up, there were no interesting pairings. There was no coordination of wines or beer or food or cheese or meat- just a seemingly random collection. Oh, and I don't like high chairs or loud places. But I adore you peeps which always makes every place worth trying.\\"\\n\\n\\"The pasta Bolognese was nice, though a bit creamier than I wanted. Maybe some more meat would have given it the heartiness I desired. It was good, just not what I was expecting. The fried mushrooms were delicious. Our server was friendly and attentive and the space was fun.\\"\\n\\n\\"I really enjoyed the place; the fried mushrooms and the pasta were really good. Not a ton of selection, but I was really pleasantly surprised by the reasonable prices, and the quality of the food for those prices. Like Tim, not a huge fan of high-top tables, butt other than that, it was very comfortable. Definitely worth a second look, if not for dinner, than apps and drinks. As always, the company was great.\\"\\n\\n\\"I love the concept of this place! I love eating like this....lots of little things to try on the same board. By making different combinations of charcuterie and crostini it keeps you interested with every bite. I tried a couple of craft beers off of their extensive selection and was not disappointed. Waiter was very helpful with recommendations. Service was a little slow with the food but I did get a quick refill on my drink. Love the decor! But I did think the music was a little too loud...I could barely hear my dinner companions across the table! I would love to go back to try the cocktails and, of course, to eat more salty pig parts.\\""},{"name":"Daisy Garden Restaurant ÈáëËèäÔøΩ?142 E Pender Street","address":"BC","city":"V6A 1T3","stars":"76","text":"2012/7/15 5:18"},{"name":"Ruth's Chris Steak House","address":"45 School St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"After having heard about the chain for years, I finally tried the new Boston location in the summer of 2006.

Oh, also, mussels appetizers must still be in the ocean somewhere. \\n\\nFirst off, must say I love the restaurant decor and feel. Very nice and upscale for Revere. Unfortunately everything else about the night was a bit of a disappointment.\\n\\nWe had many waiters serving our table of four but only two were efficient and acceptable. The Bread Guy, no names were given so I will have to call him thus, reminded me of Dory from Finding Nemo. I know I am being so mean but he is really forgetful. He's super nice but had that clueless look. When he came to clear our bread basket, he asked if we wanted more bread and we said yes. 15 minutes later, after our first appetizer came out and was ready to clear, we reminded him of the bread and he said he would get it. After our four entrees came out, still no bread. I guess we will never get the extra bread. It was good though. Dipping oil was not flavorful at all. Just your EVOO. But still very good bread. Can you tell I am really bummed out that we never got this second basket of bread?\\n\\nThe worst waitress though was the one who came to clear our calamari plate and asked us if we were finished and when my husband said he is still working on it and she gave us this annoyed look as if we were in her way of doing her job of collecting plates. Oh my goodness. She went back to the waiter/waitress station and crossed her arms and not once did I see a smile across her face the whole time I was sitting facing her and while she cleared and serviced other tables. As for the dish itself, the Calamari Fritti, which in the description read fried calamari, hot cherry peppers, aioli, spicy tomato sauce, was a very good appetizer. It was crispy and delicious. I wish they hadn't fried the hot cherry peppers because it would look much more appealing with the red cherry peppers not breaded and deep fried together with the calamari which made the plate all one color, minus the two sauces, a red marinara and a white tar tar. \\n\\nCozze Pazze - Mussels Fra Diavolo sauce or white wine sauce, garlic crusty bread. This was the second appetizer that never came. After 15 minutes of waiting for the second appetizer, and seeing that our entrees came instead about another 10 minutes later, I am glad I didn't ask for it because the mussel in my sister-in-law's dish, and she's pregnant too, was not fresh. Half dead and funny tasting, and half tiny and flavorless like the rest of the seafood in the Frutti di Mare Vesuvio. Brother described it as boiled scallop and shrimp that did not have any flavors, did not soak up the sauce. The male waiter who never brought the bread warned us that the red sauce which we picked for the dish over the white sauce was spicy. The dish was anything but spicy. Instead, he should have warned us that the sauce was strangely on the sour side. Sour, and not acidic. Sour in a strange maybe it's the canned tomato sauce sour kind of way. Not sure but brother and sister-in-law was overall very disappointed with the Frutti di Mare Vesuvio. Did not finish nor wanted to take left over home.\\n\\nMy brother ordered the Agnolotti con Zucca - Butternut squash agnolotti tossed with sage brown butter, toasted pistachios and Parmigiano cheese. It was not what he had expected. I tried some, thought it was sweet and had a creamy cheesy sauce to it. But for a dinner entree, it's not very filling. Feel bad for the big guy. He should have ordered something with meat in it.  \\n\\nHusband had the Bistecca Tips - 12 oz of grilled flap steak with BBQ glaze, roasted potatoes and grilled vegetables. He said the steak was okay. I thought it was pretty good. But I am pregnant and for some reason, almost everything tasted better than usual. But he knows his steaks. I cannot disagree since I don't know how to properly cook a steak as he does. \\n\\nFor myself, I ordered the Gnocchi Sorrentina - Homemade potato gnocchi, plum tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese and basil pesto. Now this is the first time I had gnocchi and I do not have much experience none-the-less credit for critiquing such a dish but I actually liked it. Husband and brother did too. Who knew potato could.\\n\\nOverall, meal came to $90 and tip another $14. Wicked expensive and if it wasn't for the Groupon we had that saved us $25 dollars off of the meal, I would have walked away very hungry and and even more disappointed than just a bit disappointed. I was hoping I could avoid waiting the long lines of Rino's in East Boston and someone on Yelp said they saw the owner of Off the Boat here? Both husband and I agreed that the food at Off the Boat in East Boston is much better and less pricey. Rino's however still takes the trophy in terms of closest Italian restaurant to home without me having to go into Little Italy where there is absolutely little to no parking. \\n\\nI would like to give this place another shot.

I had a hard time giving the appropriate star review.  Overall, i have been going back and forth between 3 or 4.  The pizza was great but the service was ugh.... \\n\\nFood:  4/5 -   yes I gave it a 4 the pizza because it was the best fresh pizza i have yet to have.  Not only that, it was cooked under 6 minutes too.  We had 3 pizza:  San giraldo,  Lasagna, and a marguerita with pepperoni. All of them were amazing with crispy crust and very proportional distribution of toppings.\\nThe quality of cheese were amazing too.  This is the love part.  The hate part is that OVER-PRICED for Pizza.  I mean godly over priced by like $5-$6 per pizza. They know it too, but they can charge it because people still willing to pay for it. \\n\\nService:  2/5  -  Even though the pizza can be made under 5-6 minutes, and the queue line moves rapidly.  The people who attends the customer, are just ridiculously RUDE and sometime I feel like they are incompetent.  I guess that comes from Management that triggers down to their employees.  I tried to add another topping to my Pizza and willing to pay extra, they wouldnt let me.  At the gelato place next door ( same owner),  they wouldn't let me know try any samples. Yet alone, their expensive  $6 \\"large\\" gelato is like 7oz. Their small is $5 for 5oz cup.  Talking about over priced food,  the gelato is much over priced. The cashier who served for both places have no animation, no willing to assist you any questions. They were monotone.  It seems like the owner purposely hired these type of people for a reason.  Anyhow, This is the most frugal place I have ever been to.  This is the hate part too. \\n\\nAtmosphere: 3.5   Overall, i like the place but very limited seating. It is a very chaotic seating situation because there is no control of where everyone can seat. You have to fight for a seat. It is hard for a group 4 or more to find somewhere to sit.  It is very cool how you can see them make the pizza though.  \\n\\nOverall, I would go back if my friends wanted to go to try the pizza. But i wouldn't go out my way to go just for the pizza.  It was a great pizza joint though. However, i do want to try their other restaurant around their pizza place to see how their service is like.

Ordering is a simple five-step process: (1) size; (2) type of ice cream base; (3) flavor for the base; (4) your one free \\"mix'n\\" to jazz up your ice cream; and (5) any additional add-ons.\\n\\nExtra add-ons are good to note. You can inject more flavor into the ice cream or get an extra mix'n for 50 cents each. There's also an \\"extra liquid nitrogen\\" option for 50 cents extra, where you'll get your ice cream frozen rock solid. It's a nice benefit if you have to wait for a few minutes and enjoy your ice cream later.\\n\\nThe small is the equivalent of one scoop, medium is like two scoops, and large is about three scoops. Basically a dollar more per scoop.\\n\\nIce cream bases can be premium (probably your best bet for real creamy ice cream), a fat-free and sugar-free choice, or a vegan coconut milk. There's a long list of flavors for your ice cream base and another long list for add-ons.\\n\\nYeah, I did it. I ordered some maple bacon ice cream with the premium ice cream base. A pleasing maple flavor here. I've deemed bacon an automatic win, although having the bacon crispier would probably send me cartwheeling down the street.\\n\\nThe texture of the ice cream reminded me a bit of Dippin' Dots. Some parts had hardened a bit more than others, but if you actually take your time and savor the bites, the ice cream will probably soften up enough for a real creamy experience. I generally ignore the \\"slow down and enjoy the moment\\" part of the memo.\\n\\nOn top of getting your ice cream, it's always a show when seeing the liquid nitrogen go into the metal bowl.\\n\\nNext time, I'll probably consider other mix'n choices like Snickers, Reese's PB cups, and Twix bars. It's possible to even make S'mores ice cream with two mix'n options (graham crackers and mini marshmallows with chocolate ice cream) or three (graham crackers, chocolate chips, and mini marshmallows probably on vanilla ice cream).

It was going to be my girlfriend her daughter and myself. We decided on Ruths Chris Because of their reputation and location. Week prior to Thanksgiving I called the restaurant to find out about a reservation and what menu options were available . My girlfriend's daughter is a vegetarian and I want to make sure there would be ample vegetarian options available to her. The girl who answered sounded like she was not intrested and It did not know what she was talking about she told me that there was no vegetarian options available and the only thing on the menu for Thanksgiving was a special Thanksgiving menu of turkey and Fixin's. This didn't sound right to me so I called the Waltham location. Staff at that location will much more helpful and Professional they informed me that there was the full menu with several vegetarian options and the Thanksgiving Day specials . So I called back to school street location and explained my experience to the manager he seemed about as interesting as the 1st girl I spoke with at that location.  But in trusting in the Ruth's Chris name  we made the reservation anyway. We Ordered  2 appetizers . Mushroom caps and ravioli . They were both lukewarm and the mushroom Tasted very fishy. For entrees and sides We ordered a cowboy ribeye a regular ribeye With lobster Mac and cheese , Creamed spinach and her daughter got a salad and Mac and cheese. The Mac and cheese Had no flavor and the lobster What's this weird shade of paint that also had no flavor we sent the whole plate back un touched  The stakes were good and cooked right but my steak must have been done before hers because it was cool the only thing that even remotely salvaged it was the sizzling hot plate . I table was loaded with crumbs and dirty the entire time the waiter never came over to see how our steaks were cooked right and done to our liking . I asked him for a couple suggestions on a wine and a port wine . You seem to have no knowledge of the Of the wines and simply seemed to suggest the most expensive ones on the menu 3 glasses $65. The manager never came to a table even know we sent a plate back. At $365 with tip I've had better service and meals at Texas Roadhouse .

The service we had from a young lady named Chay, though I may have her name wrong because her name tag was faded, was very attentive and genuinely friendly though we had three children and one toddler with us.  I had always heard great things about the Driftwood location and it lived up to the hype with flying colors.  All of the meats were absolutely delicious and the blackberry cobbler topped them off superbly though the crust was a bit too soft as I was expecting it to have more of a crispy or crunchy texture.  Nonetheless, the flavor was tasty and satisfying. I will be eating there again as soon as I can make it back to Driftwood or maybe the Round Rock location."},{"name":"The Hummus Stop","address":"11140 SW Capitol Hwy","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Fantastic variety of smooth, delicious hummus, crisp, flavorful falafel, homemade pita & fresh med salads.

The glare off the cars outside was blinding, but other than that our food came out quickly enough (though I wouldn't say \\"fast\\"), it was tasty, and the staff was very pleasant. It was a pretty standard experience. Their pitas are good, and the lunch special on Thursdays makes them pretty affordable.\\n\\nThe second time I came here was what really impressed me, and it could have worked out terribly. I came in and ordered a pita, grabbed a Coke, and sat down to wait. I still had some Christmas shopping to do, so I figured I'd pull out my phone and check out Amazon. After awhile, I needed a refill, so I jumped up to get one. As I was at the counter, I looked at the clock and suddenly realized it'd been about thirty minutes, and still didn't have my food. As they were refilling my drink, I politely asked how much longer until I would receive my food. They stared blankly at me for a second, then realized that they never served me. My meal had been lost in the system. They were immediately apologetic beyond any necessity, and I told them not to worry about it and just get it to me whenever they could. I sat back down with my Coke, and kept shopping online.\\n\\nImmediately after I sat down, the manager came to me and asked me how long I'd been waiting. A quick check of the clock said it'd now been a little over 30 minutes, and I could tell he truly felt terrible about the mistake. I actually wasn't all that bothered about it, as I was in no hurry to get back to work, but he wouldn't hear it and instead without a word ran out to his truck to grab some gift certificates. He covered my next meal, and again apologized. Shortly after, my food came out (rather quickly, I might add!), and it was tasty as usual. I finished it and took off back to work.\\n\\nA few days later, I returned to use my gift certificate. When the cashier saw the certificate, she immediately remembered why I had them and apologized again for the mistake. She even threw in a brownie on top of the free meal.\\n\\nAny place can and eventually will make a mistake. You can't really hold those mistakes against an establishment, but their response to the mistake can tell you a lot about the business. These guys clearly care a lot about their customers, and want them to feel welcomed and appreciated. I will certainly be returning here many times in the future, thanks to the good food and great service."},{"name":"Canal Wigwam","address":"4 S High St","city":"Canal Winchester","stars":"4","text":"This place is amazing.

I'm definitely a Francophile, even though I can probably only say about twenty words in the French language.  It's a French/Bistro type place and I find that very chic. The tables had nice linens, the restaurant was very clean and laid out well, and the music was a collection of classic 1940/50's standards.  I made a reservation for brunch because I didn't know how crowded it was going to be.  By the way, I love it when restaurants offer the option of brunch.  \\n\\nThe restaurant wasn't crowded at all on a Sunday morning and though the service started out slow, we had a very pleasant meal.  All three of us ordered off the prix fixe brunch menu (this is actually served all day).  This $9.95 meal included coffee or tea, a glass of juice, a cinnamon roll, and an entree (either scrambled eggs, an omelette, or French toast).  Considering that juice alone can be $3.00 a glass at some restaurants, this was a good deal.  I ordered the omelette, which had gruyere cheese and carmelized onions, accompanied by breakfast potatoes and toast.  My friends had the scrambled eggs and bacon.  The egg dishes were rich, but they literally melted in your mouth.  All in all, the breakfast was quite good.

WARNING: PEOPLE WHERE SMOKING EVERYWHERE; EVEN INSIDE!!!\\n\\nI had the app sampler with fried pickles, wings, and cheeseburger sliders. The wings had more fat on them then actual chicken. The fried pickles were mostly breading; and without any sort of flavoring on the pickle or breading it left them tasting bland. The sliders were soggy because the plating was done poorly. The burger itself was simple but nothing special. As a true Texan I always order queso. The queso was alright but it had a weird pickle taste to it. Overall the food was not something I would go back for.\\n\\nAs I said this place is more bar than it is restaurant so I was upset when the drinks were sub par. For starters they are way over priced in my opinion at 10 dollars a cocktail. It would be one thing if they were stiff drinks, but some of them tasted watered down. I should be able to taste the whisky in a whisky sour, that's all I'm saying. \\n\\nThe service was also not great. There were not enough chips for the queso and by the time we got our refill the queso was hard. It took what felt like forever for the food to arrive and as noted above the food was disappointing which made the wait even worse. Our waitress was inattentive and never gave us any sort heads up about the wait time on our food.\\n\\nThe worst part about this place is the smoking. People were smoking all around us, even inside. I find smoking repulsive and it is shocking that there are still places that allow it. I don't care if people are outside on the patio. A place that serves food shouldn't allow the act. Lucky for us as soon as our late food arrived the people seated directly next to use decided to light up, not one, not two, but three cigarettes; which was enough to last our entire meal."},{"name":"Daedalus Restaurant","address":"45 Mt Auburn St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"energetic, young, cool place right off the main drag on Cambridge MA.

I'll be the first to admit that sometimes first impressions can be wrong. \\n\\nI've been to Barcelona on numerous occasions (at least once per month) over the last year, and I have found the food, wine, and service to be on point. I think the best way to approach the menu is to stay away from the obvious (the exquisite, \\"best I've had outside of Spain\\" tortilla being the exception), and go for the less familiar. Anything \\"a la Plancha\\" is a sure bet - the ca√±a de oveja (grilled to charred perfection goat cheese), scallops, duck hearts, clams, you name it. Seafood is spot on - pulpo is your new BFF, gambas are delicious (make sure to use the crusty bread to sop up the garlic & parsley flavored olive oil), if it comes from the sea, get it. The vegetables are not to be missed - mushrooms, sunchokes, cauliflower, anything with squash: get it! Just had grilled duck breast - exquisite. Did I mention the tortilla? That tortilla is pure perfection. \\n\\nNow, the wines: if you're not drinking Spanish reds, you're missing out. The staff is extremely knowledgeable so just tell 'em what you like and they will expose you to incredible garnachas & tempranillos and you'll soon forget that Napa exists.  I would write a sonnet about the Laurona but I am not a poet. And if you like the wine, you can buy a bottle across the street at the Vinoteca  \\n\\nThe only downside is that the restaurant can get quite loud. Especially on the weekends (including Friday), it's a scene and a zoo, so unless you have a reservation, you'll be waiting a while.

Like, over 20% for one drink, one refill, and removing dishes as soon as you finish so you won't reuse your plate and get them in trouble with the Health Department.

While I appreciate the owner's zeal, I recommend a little less sales pitch, it's a little over the top.  He runs a cute little store that has some nice complementary products such as olive oil, vinegar, tea, etc.   The variety platter is a good deal, but would prefer it come with those yummy chips than so-so pita bread.  So who has the best hummus in town?  Hoda's on Fremont is my favorite (not sure about their other location.)

I was able to eat lunch here for a pretty decent price (about $12) by getting a son-in-law egg and a chicken fry bread, both of which I quite enjoyed. \\n\\nThe son-in-law egg is like a soft-boiled egg that is deep fried and comes with tamarind sauce, dried chili jam and house aioli. I loved the flavours in this dish, and thought it was a great way to start off a meal!\\n\\nThe fry bread was also quite tasty and a good size for lunch if you get an appetizer. Otherwise, I would suggest getting two for lunch. The chicken on the inside was moist and flavourful, especially combined with all the other toppings inside. The actual bread was also quite fragrant and had a bit of a sweet flavour, which was pleasant.\\n\\nGiven the ambience, this would be a great place when you are craving Vietnamese food but want a slightly more upscale dining environment - the best of both worlds. I believe they offer some different things on their dinner menu, so I definitely want to come back and give it another try.

There was very little cheese on there. And the sauce that was on there was in more quantity than the previous pesto pizza we had. I was really acidic, with moderately large chunks of stewed tomatoe like action?! The breaded eggplants were large chunks of breaded eggplant that were soggy. Overall the crust this time didn't hold up sturdy under these toppings. The chunky sauce overpowered the pizza, virtually no cheese, and soggy eggplants. I was really expecting something more like eggplant parmesan on a pizza crust dough, but alas no such thing. So I say good thing we are going to New York we can really get some pizza up there.

Unfortunately, on a recent visit, what I found was food sweetened for the American dining experience and less than great meals.\\n\\nAMBIANCE\\n\\nFirst things first. Little Bangkok is in a tiny strip on Cheshire Bridge and the area is every bit of the sketchy reputation that Cheshire Bridge is known for. There is virtually no where to park. We found a spot in front of what is an adjacent law firm, but those spots are only available after 6. I have no idea where one would park otherwise.\\n\\nHowever, once you get inside, what you see is a small and intimate restaurant with Thai artwork everywhere. Almost filling every available space of the restaurant. There is not enough space in the little foyer to sit down and it reminded me of a small place you'd find in Greenwich Village in Manhattan. One thing that's both good and bad, there are a lot of different size tables, so it does accommodate groups. (Down side, is we saw a group of 6 arrive after us and get seated before our own group of 4.)\\n\\nSERVICE\\n\\nI thought that this was decent enough. The restaurant has a substantial take-out business which does take up some servers. But generally speaking, food came out quickly and dishes were removed punctually.\\n\\nFOOD\\n\\nThere are far too many overly positive reviews. If you have had good Thai food, then you will be disappointed, if you had my meal. (The only exception was the Chicken Panang Curry which was excellent.) First, we ordered Fried Egg Rolls -- I mean Fried Spring Rolls which were just Fried Egg Rolls. That should be removed from the menu immediately. I was certain a Food Network Star was going to interview us afterwards as part of a show to reform kitchens. It tasted like a dried out, yet fried, egg roll. Unfortunately, Spring Rolls have a fresh connotation and the Egg Roll did not have that.\\n\\nNext, we ordered Thai Iced Tea. A staple of Thai restaurants. Excellent everywhere. Except this was sweet, sweet, sweet. Like you could pour half of the glass of water and extend the life of the tea for an hour and it would still be sweet. (The problem is that the water then throws off the tea, sweet balance.)\\n\\nFor an appetizer, we ordered Thai Dumpling. Chicken and Shrimp in a Dumpling? Bizarre flavor combination that did not work. It took the idea of a good dumpling -- much like the Fried Spring Rolls -- and ruined it with an odd twist.\\n\\nWe also ordered Tom Ka Soup. Next to Pho, this is one of my favorite soups on earth. However, this soup -- which was pretty good -- tasted as if the Penang Curry was its base. Further, it, like everything else we had, was diabetic coma-type sweet. Less sweet and this would be pretty decent.\\n\\nI ordered Penang Curry Chicken. This was excellent. The sweetness of the food -- which is ubiquitous -- was cut well by the heat of the meal. If you must come with friends who are dying to show you an \\"authentic Thai\\" meal in Atlanta, order this and remain ignorant of the sugar-infused menu.\\n\\nOverall, this place was \\"meh\\" -- save the Penang Chicken. Great Ambiance but  when the awards are all from 10 years ago -- with nothing newer -- perhaps its best to try somewhere new, rather than take a chance that something old, won't leave you feeling blue."},{"name":"Pambiche","address":"2811 NE Glisan St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I only wish I lived closer so I could sample the amazing dishes at this place more often.

The Bruce Lee that my friend got was fantastic and I recommend that to everyone, it was just a load of Chinese-barbecued meats and if that wasn't glorious enough they put an egg on top too.

Really? Bon Appetit put them on their \\"Top 50 restaurants\\" nomination list??\\nThis is Portland Pretentious with 2 capitol P's. \\nFor starters, they don't take reservations, so we signed in at 5:30...and got seated at 6:50pm. That's okay. We had a great time across the street at June. In hindsight, we should have just eaten there. \\nWhile we did get our bread and salads within the first 20 minutes, I had to ask where our main courses were - after we'd been seated for 90 minutes. Literally, when we sat down at a table outside it was warm out. By 8:30 - when we finally got the final portion of our meals, it'd gotten really cold. That may have contributed to what made the meal nothing more than \\"Meh\\". \\nI will agree with my friends that the focaccia bread was good. Sadly though, I've had better at a certain \\"Italian\\" chain restaurant in that neighborhood. \\nThe Cappelletti in brodo was nothing more than a can of chicken broth and a handful of little cheese tortellini's. For $8 I'd expect more. More food. More flavor. \\nThe linguine with avocado, almond and walnut sauce tasted suspiciously like those   \\"Farmhouse\\"  boxes of  $.99 fettuccine you get at Winco. It lacked the  flavor of fruit or nuts and basically tasted like noodles tossed in a green alfredo sauce.  \\nThe hanger steak was flavorful, but the bite I got was a little tough. \\nThe tagliatelle with beef and pork ragu was good..but could have done without the noodles. There were wither too many, or not enough sauce. \\nMy friend sent back her baked stuffed trout because it was grossly over-salted. I could have endured the salt, but seeing it's baked face and dried up eyeballs was enough to make me want to send it back. I may love meat, but I don't want it staring me in the face. \\nI know I sound harsh, but after trying the other 2 restaurants that made the Bon Appetit list (OX and Woodsman Tavern), I can't help but be really disappointed. \\nMy biggest gripe was the wait. Had the restaurant itself been the slightest bit swanky or even just comfortable, it might not have been so bad. As it was, the 4 of us were seated at 2 rickety tables covered in those cheap picnic red checked table clothes. We had plastic folding chairs that matched the table and the decor of the inside of the restaurant. Think square room with white walls, shelves adorned with ingredients (ie bags of flour) and nothing much more. It looks like my grandma's kitchen on her farm in Montana, which isn't saying much. My friends joked that all the owners money must have gone into the kitchen appliances. \\nI'm told this Bon Appetit reviewer favored Luce because he likes Italian food. I've been to both \\"Little Italy\\" in NYC and the country of Italy; and would not have known this was an Italian restaurant, if not for being told it was. I still have my doubts. \\nI think the only plus here was our server. She really knew how to sell us on the mediocre food (referring to the Cappelletti in brodo as \\"a delicate chicken broth with hearty cheese tortellini shells\\"). She was also very apologetic about the extremely slow service and overly salted trout (taking it back and not charging us for it).\\nWhile this isn't the worst restaurant I've been to on the SE side (a snooty French restaurant on lower Burnside holds that honor from me), I am befuddled about the hype and can only guess the place is mostly popular amongst the hipster scene."},{"name":"Saba Blue Water Cafe","address":"208 W 4th St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I was in Austin for the day for business  and had to drive to Waco that night, so I could only get a tiny slice of the city.

The three of us had a drink each (they didn't make my basil mojito, but the regular one was well done - I liked that they used simple syrup and not sugar that collected at the bottom). Then we split four of the half price tapas - the fried calamari, fried oysters on BBQ chips (weird, but it worked), lobster and brie empanadas, and crawfish cakes. Decent calamari, interesting take on the oysters, fantastic lobster empanadas, but the best dish was the crawfish cakes with this spicy vinaigrette. \\n\\ni liked the decor, but that fish tank needed to be cleaned. like yesterday.\\n\\ni would recommend Saba for drinks and a small bite.

The mismatched furniture gives this place a very laidback, cozy feel - kind of like Halcyon before that makeover made it way too trendy and modern.  But anyway, the mismatched furniture and eclectic artwork totally work.  It made me feel instantly comfortable with my surroundings, since I generally don't do places that are too fancy or trendy.  \\n\\nI think my friends and I ordered the right dishes, because everything we tried was delicious (though some dishes had more of a \\"wow!\\" factor than others).  The shrimp and grits were amazing.  I didn't know grits could be so good.  But then again, I think the last time I had grits, they came from Waffle House.  One of my friends who doesn't like grits said, \\"That doesn't count as grits.  That's really good.\\"  The dish had just a hint of spiciness and a ton of flavor.  The warm brie with croutons were heavenly.  As was the andouille sausage with mustard.  The Nutella s'mores may be a dish I'll absolutely have to order every time I go to Simplicity, though.  The marshmallows were perfectly roasted, and the dish dish was just such a scrumptious, gooey mess.  Yes, the food was simple, hence the name Simplicity, but sometimes, simple, quality food with big, bold flavor tastes the best.  \\n\\nBetween three people, we ordered nine dishes, a bottle of wine, two additional glasses of wine, and a sangria.  The total came out to be under $80.  Unbelievable!  We'll definitely be going back to Simplicity again and again.  Of course, the fact that the restaurant is so green is also pretty darn cool.  It's just such a good place to linger over food, wine, and conversation.  And I adore the concept of a low-key, laidback wine bar.

I came here with a date on a Wednesday around 12:30pm for lunch.\\n\\nThis was our first time here, and we both found the setup and structure to be rather unintuitive. It was pretty obvious that you go up and order your pizza at the counter, but after that, what do you do? We had gotten a bottle of bubbly water from the cooler and asked if we could have a couple glasses. The woman behind the register was a bit annoyed at this question and said that there were cups on the table. Um, our bad?\\n\\nWe then looked behind us to see one very large communal table and another smaller one behind it. As there was nowhere to sit at these tables, we meandered back towards the front where there were some seats by the windows. We asked a member of the staff who was walking by a question about seating or silverware or something, but the woman clearly did not understand English and just said, \\"Yes\\" and walked away. Eventually we then noticed there was a doorway near the large communal table. Oh duh! That's where all the seats are!! We scurried over to the doorway (as it was getting pretty busy) to find a big room with lots of communal tables and an open kitchen layout at the back where you could see pizzas being made. \\n\\nDon't skip out on this back room when you come here! There is a little station at the back that has some nice toppings to adorn your pie. For example, there is parmesan cheese, freshly minced garlic, oregano, basil, red pepper flakes, olive oil, spicy oil/vinegar, and nice whole red peppers that were like fancypants versions of Papa John's pepperoncinis.\\n\\nI gathered up what I could carry while my date scored us some seats. It was unpleasantly noisy and chaotic as the staff shouted out numbers while simultaneously dodging patrons to deliver the pizzas on enormous baking trays. I like this as a concept, but functionally, it was extremely cumbersome. The trays are huge compared to the pizzas, so they take up a great deal of unnecessary space at tables that are already cramped.\\n\\nI will commend them that the pizza was pretty tasty, although for a Margherita it seemed a bit heavy on the cheese and lacking in sauce. But I did enjoy the chewiness of the crust. The pizza was not as thin as I expected it to be, but delicious nonetheless. Ultimately, I'd be curious to try some other pies, but I was disappointed in the general disgruntlement of the staff and the confusing layout of the restaurant. \\n\\nWishlist:\\n*¬†Coat hooks\\n*¬†Water pitchers\\n*¬†Smaller pizza trays\\n*¬†Even smaller trays to transport the cups of assorted toppings to garnish your pie\\n*¬†Better parking\\n*¬†Some fabric on the ceiling/walls to absorb all the noise\\n*¬†Friendlier staff"},{"name":"Le Parisien","address":"751 Denman Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Went here for DINEOUT with a bunch of people.

I've been to bad restaurants before but they have either bad service but good food or bad food but good service. This place has neither of both. \\n\\nWhen my girlfriend and I went in, several waitresses just passed in front of us back and forth but none of them greeted us. One young waitress even looked at us a few times and then ignored us. By the way, we didn't look like homeless people or robbers! We waited for a few minutes with no one greeting us. I had to ask the young waitress if they were doing business. That's when we were finally received. We never even saw hint of a smile on her face the whole time like i owe her money or something. Our appetite was basically half ruined already before we were seated. \\n\\nThe other half of our appetite was quickly ruined too after our food was served. I ordered extra spicy ramen, but there wasn't even one tiny trace of spice in my bowl. I asked the waitress who served our table. She just said \\"oh, I forgot your spicy sauce\\" then brought me a small dish of spicy sauce. She didn't even say sorry like it was not her fault. Both of our noodles were somehow undercooked and there were only two slices of fatty pork laying on top of the noodles. By the way, the menu says you can choose either pork or chicken. The waitress did not ask our choice at all and just defaulted our choice to be pork (although that's what we wanted). The broth is no better than the Shin Ramyun which costs less than 2 bucks from the grocery store. It's so tasteless that makes Sapporo Ramen the king of ramen (I swear I don't work for Sapporo). I am pretty serious here. I am Asian and  I was basically raised on ramen but this is the worst ramen I have ever had. And they charge you 11 bucks for such a tasteless, small bowl of ramen which is simply a ripoff. I saw the menu and prices before stepping in the restaurant. I knew the price was bit high for ramen but I was having expectation that the food would live up to the price. Needless to say, it was a big mistake and ultimate disappointment. \\n\\nWhen I foot the bill, I gave the waitress 30 cash for the 23 bill. She asked me if that would be it like I would not want my change back. Hell no....I am not giving you over 30% tip for what service and food I just received here!  \\n\\nIn a nutshell, we will not go to this place again and I would tell my friends not to go either. If you read my review and did not believe me, check the bad reviews from other people. I really wish I had had read these reviews before I went here. It's been an hour after our visit. Now I am waiting to see if my gf and I would vomit or have diarrhea later as other people had experienced after having their food. I wouldn't be surprised if we do. Finger crossed!\\n\\nSuggestion to the owner of the restaurant:\\n1. Try other ramen places and see how much better their ramen tastes: Sapporo Ramen, Pikaichi Ramen etc.  and improve yours\\n2. Train your college kid-looking waitresses to be professional or hire some professional waitresses.

But after having a few dinners here, I can safely conclude that the food is consistently subpar. \\n\\nThe menu descriptions of their entrees all sound really appealing, and a couple even sound exciting...but Daedalus makes a misstep that is all too typical of restaurants in this genre: they overseason everything. If your entree includes garlic, expect it to be loaded with unreasonable amounts of garlic. Expect the most dominant flavor in your dish to overwhelm all other flavors on your plate. Expect sauces that are just a tad too heavy. I most recently ordered the lobster ravioli, and - despite that protein's infamous richness - the lobster was overwhelmed by the sauce, cheese, and seasoning. Unnecessary!

To give you an idea of what it's like, I think Senegalese is to West African food as Cajun is to Southern food. Not that the flavors are similar, but that it just has an extra kick, at least as compared to Moroccan and Tunisian food (which you can find elsewhere in this city). Same general types of dishes (couscous and stews with a bit of French influence), but punched up a notch with some bold flavors. E.g. the Yassa Guinaar is a grilled bone-in chicken breast smothered in this really sweet lemony caramelized onion sauce.\\n\\nQuality of food is about what you'd get if you had a friend from Senegal and his/her mom was a pretty good cook. The dishes are pretty simple (most of the dishes are just a baked meat or stew with some plain rice/couscous on the side). Chicken breast was a little dry, croquettes de poisson appetizer (fish cakes) a little mushy, but the lamb shank was super juicy. As a bonus, they say the meat is halal, except one or two dishes.\\n\\nThe presentation is definitely a cut above what your Senagelese friend's mom can do. The rice is plated with molds, the sauces on the appetizers are drizzled in swirly patterns and/or served in little spoons that sit on the plates, which are huge and rectangular, making for a pretty dramatic presentation. Doesn't totally mesh with the home-cooked feel of the food, but the effort is good.\\n\\nDesserts are unique, but most miss the mark. Thiacry (sorta like rice pudding) is really thin-- closer to a horchata than a substantive dessert. Beignets Dougoup have a bit of a misleading name-- don't expect French style beignets, but rather really dense fried dough discs that aren't too sweet. Mango Tarte Tatin was great though: super ripe caramelized mangoes in a pastry shell with creme anglaise.\\n\\nAmbience is bistro-esque, lots of dark woods and dim lighting. Bathrooms require keys to get into, like a gas station (why don't they just put locks on the inside?). Servers are friendly but a bit unprofessional-- one abruptly stepped away while taking our order to shut the door to the hall that leads to the bathrooms. If you go during a busy time, service can be incredibly slow and you'll have to wait forever to get your food. And although they supposedly closed at 11pm, we got a \\"hey our kitchen is closing so order now\\" at only 9:40pm.\\n\\nDon't forget to try one of the crazy juices. The bissap is awesome, with a taste between prune and cranberry and rosewater (it's actually made from rosella fruit). The ginger juice is super strong, but great if you like ginger.\\n\\nIn short, great place to try something different and expand your culinary palette."},{"name":"Chilli Duck Thai Cuisine","address":"829 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"This is absolutely my favorite Thai restaurant in the Boston/Cambridge area.\\n\\n1) The prices are very good. The lunch prices are great; lunch is served until late in the day (I think I had a lunch special at 4pm once); and the dinner prices are consistently $1 or $2 cheaper than at Cafe Spice in Harvard Square.\\n\\n2) The main thing I love about this place is that they don't use sugar in the curries. I had to call and confirm this. Cafe Spice does use sugar. I am on long-term antibiotics and due to Candidiasis I can't eat sugar, but I can eat coconut milk, so I love it that I can get my Thai fix at Chilli Duck. From my own experience, I suspect that Thai Basil uses sugar. The curry at Chilli Duck tastes great even without sugar.\\n\\n3) There are many options here that you won't see at other Thai restaurants. I particularly enjoy having DUCK curries (green curry, red curry). I try to have a rotation diet where I don't eat one meat within three days of eating it, so as to minimize food allergies, and it helps to be able to have some duck at Chilli Duck so that I'm not always eating chicken and beef.

Not bad in flavors, but ikea's swedish meatballs are better....\\n\\nRibeye with mushrooms: I could recommend these along with the hanger steak as the 2 favorites. Grilled and saut√©ed just right. \\n\\nPotatoe bravas: It's a habit for me and my boyfriend to come to a tapas place and get potatoes, I love these because it was roasted perfectly, and the sauce to top was amazing. \\n\\nDessert: Hazelnut chocolate indulgence cake with coconut ice cream. I could eat the coconut ice cream by itself and be satisfied, the cake was great and very rich, but as i'm getting older my sweet tooth is dying out, This was just a bit to sweet for me. However, still great. They also had churros on the menu with chocolate sauce, and Flan-I should have gotten thought instead. \\n\\nBarcelona is a great place for date night, surprised my boyfriend by coming here and he ended up loving it. Make reservations definitely, especially on a Saturday night and enjoy the tapas on the patio where its less noisy from inside.

Took awhile for for it to come out since the stuff is freshly made so we took a spin through the rest of the trucks.  Opened up the bag and took a peek - nice sized breast sitting atop of a piece of thick sliced bread. I guess I thought Texas Toast meant it was buttered and grilled, not just the bread labeled as such.  The chicken was an oddly dark color so wasn't sure if there was some sweetness in the coating that got dark when it hit the grease, or if the oil was old.

I JUST THOUGHT YOU SHOULD KNOW!\\"  \\n\\nwe came to no real conclusion as to who had the best meats.  rudy's does have awesome brisket where you can choose moist (fatty) or regular, but I found the SL brisket to be just as good, although not as fatty.  I avoid gristle and fat so I was happy with salt lick brisket.  the turkey...  most people in our party said rudy's was better, but maybe only marginally.  I thought the sausage was real good but my wife suggested it was a bit salty.  then we arrived at the ribs, my wife and I both loved them and we are hard to please with ribs.  they were easy to eat off the bone without getting all caveman.  and they did not need any sauce (sawse)\\n\\nnow let's get to the sides... that is where we all agreed that the potato salad and coleslaw were MUCH better than rudy's (Rudy's is sort of our benchmark for bbq).  the SL tater salad is more of a german style, made with vinegar instead of mayonnaise or miracle whip.  same for the SL slaw, it was crisp and fresh without the need for creamy mayo.  both went well with the meat.\\n\\npeach cobbler was good and tasted home made.\\n\\nIMHO this was the best barbecue restaurant experience ever.  (my ribs might be better but I'm not in this competition)\\n\\nI noticed a few yelps mentioning the high cost, $14 per plate.  yes, the rancher's plate is $13.95 and is the most expensive option on the menu, it comes with several different meats and sides.  there ARE less expensive options and that rancher's plate was enough for 2-3 people.  we had one rancher's plate and one 2 meat combo.  those two plates fed three adults and three children and we came home with a BIG box of leftovers.  cost of our meal was around $32.\\n\\nremember BYOB although I think I saw people buying wine and beers from the winery/cellar next door and bring cash, but there is an ATM if you forget.

I honestly live about 5 minutes away if you're walking.\\nDespite my asking how much blue cheese comes with the wings, I didn't get any when the delivery driver arrived (be careful, the driver rang every doorbell in my apartment building). So, I called them and mentioned it and was told that I had to wait for the delivery driver to make his other deliveries before he could get me the rest of my order to which the rude employee responded with \\"well, what do you want ME to do about it?\\". Me being a very non confrontational guy just said \\"I'll wait for it\\". \\n40 minutes later I call again and I'm told that \\"she should have been there by now\\". They had given my celery and sauce to an employee that had already punched out for the day. It had been almost 2 and a half hours after my initial order that I called one last time to tell them that I was sorry I ordered with them and that they shouldn't expect any return business.

So my expectations were already high going in.\\n\\nWe all ordered off the prix fixe menu and we all got the lobster bisque. That was a bad call. It was super salty and was difficult to get through. (Note: go with the salad next time.) After that, I readied myself for the crushing disappointment of reality that awaited in the filet. The waiters brought over the main courses and I took my first bite of the filet. It melted like butter in my mouth - exactly how I remembered it. It's the most tender and juicy steak I've had, and the only thing I could say for a few minutes was how good the steak tasted. The mashed potatoes side and bread pudding dessert were also good, but really nothing could compare to the filet. The others in the group had the crab cakes and salmon main courses, and they thoroughly enjoyed those as well.\\n\\nThe service was all around good, so no complaints there. The steak was just so good that not even the bad lobster bisque took away significantly from the experience.

We just went to the counter and orderd the crawfish etoufee(sp.?)  w/ candied yams, red beans and rice, and cornbread.  \\n\\nAfter ordering, you're kinda left there to look around and read the handwritten letters on the wall and listen to the gospel AM radio station which is blaring pretty loud.

The food was AWESOME.  I swear I could've literally licked my plate clean, it was so good.  It wasn't a big deal that the yams ran altogether into the rice beans and crawfish and cornbread, because it was one whole plate of goodness.  I don't think you can find food this good at a chain.  Overall it was a good experience...\\n\\nA couple warnings though, if you're not comfortable with Christian related things, you might not feel at home, lol.  I was kind of afraid for my roommate's car outside.  Lastly, seating is pretty limited, luckily we were there when there was only one other couple.  There's an 8-seater table, a 6-seater table, and a 2-seater table.  I'm guessing people sit together at the 8-seater table even if you don't know them?

We just brought more cold beer the next time. My favorites are CaprIcciosa and San Gennaro and if you like spicy (it's more of a warm spicy that builds rather than a searing hot), try the Diavola. The crust is always perfect, not soggy like at other places, and the dough has a certain depth that I don't find elsewhere. The pizzas are out of the oven faster than you can sit and the staff is always helpful. I think they have a small selection of wines and beers now, but we always bring our own.

She was nice enough, but she was very slick. Let me explain.\\n1. When we first sat down, she asked if we wanted sparkling or still water. We said still and she brought over a bottle of water. We thought she meant ice water as there were people walking around with water pitchers filling everyone's water glasses. Instead $6.95 was added to the bill for our warm bottle of still water.\\n2. We ordered the lobster bisque. She asked if we wanted sherry with it. We assumed it was a choice to have it with or without (just like you can have your steaks with or without butter). She brought us a shot glass with a spoon in it. We thought it was kind of strange that A. they didn't put it in for you and B. it was in a glass w/a spoon and not something classier like a mini-pitcher so we could pour it in. When the bill came there was a charge from the bar for \\"Harvey's...$9.\\" So basically we were charged for a shot from the bar and it had nothing to do with sherry for the bisque.\\n3. We had 5 gift cards that totaled $175. Our bill was more than that, so when my husband handed her the bill, he specifically said there was $175 in gift cards included with his credit card. When she brought back the bill, it was $25 more than it should have been. We called her over and told her the mistake. She came back and told us some BS story about how she threw the gift cards away, but was able to retrieve them from the garbage and when she checked there was a $25 balance on one of the cards. We know she pocketed one of the $25 cards thinking we wouldn't notice. She was blabbering on and on about it and just seemed guilty.\\n\\nWe were celebrating our anniversary and we knew we were going to pay a lot for a great meal.

First on a Thursday night and again on a Monday. Monday is definitely pretty quiet there, but they were doing pretty steady business. \\n\\nThey make delicious mixed drinks. Their in house muddling makes a big difference. An Old Fashioned was rated the best ever tasted at our table. Our server seemed a bit lacking in knowledge of the spirits list, and maybe in cuisine, as she didn't seem to know what Macallan (The Macallan, single malt scotch) was and started listing various things from the list before handing it over. (They do have Macallan.) \\n\\nThe special was Confit of Duck, which two of our party ordered. It didn't seem to be a traditionally prepared confit, but was still considered delicious in its probably lighter preparation. The jus and other sauces are amazing. Five stars for sure. The classic dish, pumpkin filled ravioli with sage and browned butter sauce was excellent. \\n\\nMeats when requested Medium tend to be on the rare side of medium, so be aware of that if you are squeamish... this pertains to both the lamb and pork dishes we ordered. Sides are interesting and nicely prepared, though they tend to be so inventive that I often forget what the full description was on the menu and end up guessing at what , I'm eating. They are tasty though. \\n\\nThe flavored olive oil served with bread is very good. \\n\\nDesserts were better the first time than the second. More classical preparations of fruit tarts ordered in the summer were very good. More recently we ordered a chocolate pecan tart served with sweet corn ice cream, and an interpretation of a \\"s'more\\". I'd rate the s'more as interesting, but somehow it needed more structure. The graham cracker crust was good but really thick, compared to the silky airiness of the flourless chocolate and marshmallow cream. Too much contrast or something. Or maybe I'm just not into foamy desserts. The pecan tart was good, but none of us really loved the sweet corn ice cream. \\n\\nThe location is funky, in the Table Mesa strip mall, but it's nice to have a good restaurant in that part of town (in addition to Tandoori Grill, Ajuua, etc.). The 60's modernist decor seemed somewhat over the top to our interior designer dining companion from NYC but he loved the food and rating the kitchen highly so that counts for more! \\n\\nOver-salting meat seems to be common here... Last time it was the pork, most recently the pork was fine but the duck was too salty. They should work on that. It's noticeable even to me, a salt lover. \\n\\nOverall, very good. I'll agree that wait staff could be better, in terms of knowledge, but they are friendly. They replace used cutlery which is nice. Having water in a bottle at the table is good (a la the Kitchen). The Kitchen and SOBO are similar; both focus on locally raised meats and produce. There is a something more effortless about The Kitchen, but SOBO is definitely good. \\n\\nSOBO has a limited (very standard) kids' menu, crayons, and a coloring sheet (the menu) which we do not order off for our toddler as she eats our food, but it's good that they are welcoming as they try to be a neighborhood restaurant."},{"name":"Toney Bento","address":"1423 SE 37th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3","text":"Having a beautiful day enjoying the streets of  W-Horethawn and decided we wanted some food.

My friends were visiting from out of town from the East Coast and were looking to try some authentic southern breakfast food. When we entered the restaurant, it was very busy and packed with a lot of people. The restaurant allows you to \\"check-in\\" on the waitlist through Yelp and you have to be there by a certain time to see the hostess. Anyway, we arrived there and were told that it would be about 45 minutes wait, but normally it would be a 2 hour wait. We were hungry but didn't mind waiting for a table due to all the good reviews this place had. We waited over  1.5 hours which was fine for us. However, when we were seated, it took about the server about 10-15 minutes to approach us to ask us what we wanted to drink. Prior to this, one of my friends saw a server and tried to wave him down so he could approach us (since we were all ravenous at this point). The server did see us but was occupied with another table. Once he was finished talking to them, he came over to our table and said -- \\"I see you ladies here, and I see you waving, but I am busy getting another table their drinks so I am going to need you be a little bit more patient.\\" YES we were trying to get our drinks and order right away and were trying to quicken the pace HOWEVER, it is NOT necessary for someone else (especially a server) to tell us to be \\"more patient.\\" Once, our beverages came, the wait for food was really long, which we expected. However, when we were eating our food the server did not come over to ask us how we were doing and if we needed anything else. Instead, the server would ask all the other surrounding nearby tables how they were doing and if they needed anything else EXCEPT for us. Towards the end, when we finished our meal the server actually forgot to ring in our peach cobbler french toast and when we asked him if he had rung it up (cause if he didn't, we would just cancel it) but instead of letting me finish speaking he immediately darted away and disappeared for 10 minutes before appearing with our toast.

The only way to describe the bewildering speed of both the owner and staff of this place, is to say \\"I want a lamb kabob\\" out loud and violently shaking your hand inches from your face. With that said, it's obvious to suggest that you should look at the menu and plan your order BEFORE you get to the counter (after waiting for less than 10min).\\n\\nOnce you're there, you're automatically greeted with a sudden smile and a handed a huge piece of hot, fresh falafel dipped in hummus, by none other than the \\"falafel king\\" himself. The owner takes your order, passes it on and you're shimmied along to the cashier. Who barely has time to take your money before your food is already there, waiting for you.\\n Afterward, I'd suggest just to walk down the street and eat somewhere in the park.

We come in as a group of 5 waiting for the 6th person to show up in a bit. We get seated by a 12 year old and are all brought waters. Said 6th person comes a few minutes later and we chill. And...we keep on chilling. Finally after about 15 minutes of just chilling, we walk over to the kitchen to find someone who can take our order. A different and more older person comes out to take our order finally. Great food and they gave my friend some free mango sticky rice, which was very nice. But the service was just awful.

DELICIOUS, and more food than you should really every eat) and the beer selection is just as sophisticated as Brickstore and others, but I don't think quite as pricey. \\n\\nOh! and another positive note, the last time I went the service was better... pleasant, helpful, and not snotty at all when I pointed at the beer I wanted to try rather trying to pronounce it... \\n\\nLove the atmosphere!

The four of us spent more than $400 and would rather have gone out for pizza.  Two appetizers and two meals were cold.  Steak ordered medium-well was rare, but it took so long to get the meal we didn't send it back.  Ravioli was just plain boring. Our main waiter was friendly but inattentive. What really made us annoyed was being charged $36 for one appetizer.  My friend asked if she could get a smaller portion of risotto (listed as a main course) for her appetizer  -- which they said yes.  (It IS nice that you can switch appetizers for main courses.)  What they failed to tell her?  She would pay the same dinner price for her appetizer.

The vibe in the front room is casual with a nice view looking out onto Park Ave. The back room is more formal. The upsatirs lounge gets going around 9:30 or 10.

The entire structure is built in a fashion quite reminiscent of Japanese architecture.  The wood and wall materials, as well as the plinth surrounding the foundation (a gray slate? not sure the material) recall houses and manors one finds on the Japanese Isles.  The interior is luxuriantly vibrant with blond wood and deeper rose-coloured accents.  The flavour of the decor tends towards austere, but hardly discouraging.\\n\\nThe location caters towards an older crowd in its personality, but people of any age can enjoy the food.  Mushroom sautees and other delights are available on the cooked food menus.  Delightful.  Hibachi and Sushi are also available, which are quite competent.  While some diners have had spotty experience with the food quality, I've enjoyed my jaunts to Nakato.  It's a high quality, well-established restaurant with history.  You can feel it.\\n\\nI can't vouch for the consistency of the fish, as I tend to be pulled toward the cooked dishes.

I'm always on the hunt for new bookstores and places to eat, so I figured it'd be fun to kill two birds with one stone. I was actually impressed by our experience. First, the bookstore itself is great. Independent bookshops in Boston are a rare sight and I was more than happy to give them my business -- they have a very well-stocked store. I'd definitely recommend searching the stacks after your meal.\\n\\nFor the food itself, our table ordered a round of coffee, an omelette, the corned beef hash, a standard breakfast plate (i.e., home fries, eggs, meat, toast), and an order of pancakes to share. Holy moly. First of all, splitting the pancakes was brilliant because we all got a taste of their buttery fluffiness while still saving room for our own dishes. I had a bite of my mom's corned beef hash, which was stellar. Seriously, so flavorful. My omelette was also enjoyable; it wasn't rubbery at all, the ingredients tasted fresh, and the size left me more than satisfied! I even passed up on having toast and couldn't polish off the last bite between it and the pancakes. \\n\\nThe service was great. Our waiter was incredibly attentive without being overbearing.

When we got there the place was quiet with only a couple of families there. We where seated quickly and watched the restaurant fill up. While the place never filled up by the time we left they were probably three quarters full. \\n\\nFor an appetizer we tried the hush puppies with pimiento mayo. The puppies were crisp, hot and tasty when the arrived. The mayo had a very mild pimiento flavor and would have benefited from a little more pimiento. Also the promised jalape√±os were absent without leave. Overall the puppies were some of the best we've had. \\n\\nThe dinner was a split decision. The meats were all well prepared. The pork and beef ribs both had good \\"pull\\" and were tender. The brisket had a great smoke ring and was fall apart tender. The pulled pork was smoky and tender but could have benefited from more char. The sausage was well a sausage. Acceptable but not anything I'd walk across the street for. \\n\\nThe sides were less terrific. The cornbread was dry, the meaty chili beans tasted like it fell off the Sysco truck and the greens were not my cup of tea. The owner worked at Russell St BBQ before opening Paulo' and the greens were very Russell like. I liked the greens at Miss Delta much better. The coleslaw has promise. The dressing was a little runny and the slaw was not cold and crisp but it has promise. \\n\\nThe sauces were good but not much distinction between them. The mustard sauce was good on the sausage. The spicy tomato sauce was the regular sauce with a little more punch. The good thing was that the spice didn't overpower the tomato sauce. The weakest sauce was the North Carolina which was really bland. \\n\\nIf Paulo's can improve their sides I would give them five stars till then they are 3.5-4 star BBQ."},{"name":"Aquitaine","address":"500 Legacy Pl","city":"Dedham","stars":"3.5","text":"Review based 2/28/2010\\n\\nWent here for Brunch for a Girl's Day Out.

I originally asked for the outdoor space, with multiple checks. I was told they could only accommodate separate checks in the bar. I then asked, how much the event minimum would be for a single check (thanks to venmo - this isn't really an issue). The event coordinator refused to give an estimate for number of people in my party; instead she gave an estimate for 10. She said a party of 10 people would require 1 check and a $1000 minimum.She also said, it might be tight outside with 10. First of all, the area outside is huge and can accommodate more than 10 people. I've eaten at Barcelona on a Saturday many times before with parties of 10-12 with no minimum required so I'm baffled at why there would be a minimum for such a small party. Furthermore, my party is not a party of 10, it's a party of 20-30. Why couldn't the event coordinator provide me with an estimate for a party of my size. I've been a loyal customer for years. I was at Barcelona opening night when the bartenders were standing on the bar pour champagne into peoples mouths. It's consistently been one of my favorite spots.

We arrived promptly at 530 to assure we got a seat at the bar which is first come first serve (ie no reservations).   The bartender (who's name escapes me) was great.  She was an extremely seasoned bar tender and it showed by her finesse behind the bar.  With an expert hand, she crafted cocktail after cocktail effortlessly.  She made for me the Ardois (Rain vodka, sage, juniper and lime) which was delicious.  There was great flavor out of this sour drink.  \\n\\nJenny and I decided on splitting an appetizer of the fried pig tails.  I don't know about you, I have never had pig tails before and let me tell you - these little suckers were amazing.  So rich and full of piggy flavor, fried to perfection, this dish made me a believer of the head to tail philosophy of Craigie on Main.  Then after much hype in the local news, we each had to try the famed hamburger.  Cooked to a perfect medium rare, topped with cheese, fried onions, house cured bacon, homemade ketchup and other accoutrements; this was by far one of the best burgers of my life.   You could really taste the meat which is so important.  The thick wedge cut fries that came with it were nicely crisp.  On the side, we also sampled some bone marrow and some saut√©ed mushrooms.  If I had any idea, how large the bone marrow side was, I probably would not have gotten it. With the pig tails, giant burger, I was bordering on being way too stuffed for my own good.  Yet the bone marrow and the mushrooms were both delicious.\\n\\nJust as I was about to call it quits, the amazing bar tender sent over some dessert foam that tasted like an apple pie.  I'm glad is was foam and not pie as I was so full. Speaking of full, I had no idea how full of flavor foam could be.\\n\\nGreat food, Great service, and nice decor.  What an amazing first impression of Craigie on Main.

The flavor is terrible, heavily oversalted even on the plain cheese -- you'll especially want to stay away from any of the feta-and-olive pies, which taste like salt licks -- and even the underside of the crust is drowning in unpalatable grease.  And the taste and texture of the crust, which ought to be fresh and bready, are instead burnt and cracker-like.  I sampled three different pies, and none was close to acceptable.

The Pomodorini is topped with bufala mozzarella, cherry tomatoes, garlic and basil. The pizza itself is very simple, but the simplicity is what allows the ingredients to shine, the essence of the ingredients remains. The cherry tomatoes are blistered and sweet due to the high heat of the pizza oven. The cheese was gooey and melty, and there sure was lots of it. Now this is a white pizza so the amount of cheese makes sense. The crust was to die for. I could have eaten the crust plain that's how good it was. I love my crusts chewy, soft, and puffy. This crust delivered on all three of these standards. There was also a nice char as well. Great pizza with fresh ingredients, yum.

I eat quite often at their Surrey location but the menu here is way more limited and much more expensive.  A bowl of fish congee that is $6.95 at their other locations is $9.95 here.  All the menu items are basically $3 above what their other locations charge and the portion size is only about 2/3 of what you normally get too. $6.95 for shrimp dumplings? WTF?

The ambience was great and they even had a big screen for us to watch the Olympics, so we were very happy.\\n\\nFor dinner, we started with the poutine, which had a delicious tamarind base and blue cheese that was surprisingly delightful.  We ordered a side of bread to soak up the delicious gravy before our meal arrived.  (The paprika butter that came with the bread was a bit too powerful.)  The \\"le canard aux epices\\" was very tasty, although the portions were rather small, with three small pieces of succulent spice rubbed duck breast with a dollop of whipped goat cheese that came with an excellent tamarind gastrique.  This was supplemented by a spice-filled side of butternut squash puree and red delicious caramelized apples.  My friend had the \\"tajine d'aziz a l'agneau\\", which was a delightful, fall-off-the-bone braised lamb shank with honey, figs, cinnamon & cilantro, served with cous cous and zalouk.  It was a little too cinnamony for my taste, but still very delicious.  The $3 supplemental harissa and raita was unnecessary in our opinion.  You can't go to a Belgian restaurant without moules frites.  We ordered the coquette, which had mussels that were cooked in a white wine cream with smoked lardons and a lot of onions and spring onions.  This was served with a side of delicious fries and the obligatory mayo.  \\n\\nThis would have been a 4-star meal without the dessert, but the dessert moved it into a 5-star territory.  The \\"le cafe Belge\\" was complex in a good way, as it contained different kinds of chocolate flavors that combined well together.  The espresso cheesecake was complemented by the belgian chocolate mousse.  The creme de cacao gelee was delightful, as were the crisp chocolate wafers.  What send me over the edge was the \\"le gateau poire\\", one of the best desserts I've had in a long time.  The presentation was beautiful with the vanilla cake baked on top of pear compote.  The rasberry creme anglaise made the cake that much better and the lemongrass ice cream was a bit out of this world.

After seeing cool pictures from Escobar's Instagram page, my friend and I decided to come here on a Saturday night. When we first got to the entrance, a \\"bouncer\\" was there and just looked at us in silence. My friend and I both had to instruct him on how to do his job by saying to him, \\"Hey do you need to check our ID's?\\" and \\"Do you need to look in my purse?\\" When we entered the bar we looked around the establishment to check out the ambiance. It felt more like we were at a kickback than a bar which was fine with me. When we decided that we wanted a table I went to the hostess stand and requested a table. When we got escorted to our table, there was only one chair there so I had to wait for the hostess to find me one. The area in which we were seated (by the front entrance) in had NO LIGHTING at all. We had to use our phones to look at the menu. The two menu's we were given were crumbled up and we were told by our server to not look at one side of the menu bc it was old/outdated and to only look at the prices on another. We only ordered drinks and appetizers. The drinks were alright. I ordered the chicken slider. The temperature of the chicken sliders were barely at room temperature. At this point, my friend and I were way over this place to complain. When we got our checks, I noticed that I was charged gratuity. I was confused about the gratuity because 1. There was only 2 of us dining there 2. We only ordered drinks/appetizers and 3. There was not a note on the menu informing us about the added gratuity. My friend's bill was $20.06 and she only had two $20 bills and asked our server for change and our server responded, \\"I don't have any change.\\" So basically she was either trying to get a $20 tip (which she was definitely not getting) or you're just too lazy to get change.

The Wizarding World of Harry Potter is here and if you want to see all of it, you need to purchase park to park passes. At the purchase counter, you will get your paper card that gives you access to the park. You will also need to register your fingerprint at the gate. You can go in and out of the park no problem. If you have park to park, you can enter/exit via the main gates or take the Hogwarts Express between WW locations (Hogsmeade and Diagon Alley). Universal Studios is more up my alley as compared to Islands of Adventure. I think Islands of Adventure has more of a focus on kids and families. Universal Studios is more for grown-ups. Rides and shows are available in both parks. If you are going during peak dates, expect quite a long wait. We were here in April and we still had to wait quite a while for some activities. of dining options and snacks, as well. Look into the dining plan to see if it makes sense for you. It did for me and my friend. There is also a full service restaurant dining plan, but you have to purchase that in advance and make reservations. The quick service version you can buy at many locations throughout the park. Also, you may be asked by staff to fill out surveys about your experience. They are super quick - please do help them out. It will make for a better park in the future. Universal is tons of fun for adults and kids. I have been twice in less than 3 years. I expect that I may return one other time in the next few years. If I lived in the area, I would go much more often. The park offers a great military deal - check it out at your local base."},{"name":"Trident Booksellers & Caf√©","address":"338 Newbury St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Loved the tator tots stuffed with cheese and giant size paired really well with the craft beers we also had a side of bacon and a mood enhancer a vegetable drink my girlfriend ordered the hash and eggs were perfect cooked over hard but not dry the hash was amazing very nice brisket mmm the waitress was very attentive and the atmosphere was amazing we even discussed the new beer list with the manager very knowledgeable \\nA true gem of a place"},{"name":"Totto Ramen","address":"169 Brighton Ave","city":"Allston","stars":"3","text":"The best ramen in Boston.

There are also a lot of good hot teas and smoothies if you don't really feel like stuffing your fat face with food. \\n\\nAssuming you're not illiterate, their book selection is O.K., but I rarely even check out the books. Everyone is so busy in the cafe part chatting about their yeast infection or some bullshit, so it's not really a good reading place.\\n\\nThey do have a pretty clean bathroom, but there's only one, so the wait can be frustrating sometimes.

This is not the case anymore for me. Perhaps I came on a bad day, but my server who was an elderly lady was extremely rude and unsanitary. As soon as we sat down, she asked \\"any apps???\\". I'm sorry, but we just sat down after waiting outside for an hour and she barely gave us time to breathe. Out of instinct, I quickly ordered the fried calamari without thinking because I've had it before and knew I'd like it (which I would recommend as an appetizer). \\n\\nI told her we needed some time to figure out which entrees we wanted and she just turned around and walked away. After literally two minutes she turns back to us (the place is small enough that she can just turn around to our table from the next) and asks us what we wanted to order. At this point, we made really quick decisions as she seemed to be growing more impatient. We had ordered a linguine with clams and mussels in Giacomos sauce, fettucine with panchetta and peas, and my go-to butternut squash ravioli. As the linguine came out, it only had mussels and one of the cooks / other servers quickly took it back and told us that they would add clams in it since that's what we ordered. As they put it back on the counter, to my HORROR, our primary server took her finger to taste the dish to check if it was ours. That is extremely unsanitary and if I were in a worse mood I would've told her that that was so and that they should cook an entire new dish for us based on that action alone. Then, as all the dishes came out, she transferred the rest of our unfinished calamari to a smaller dish to make room on the table in which she used her HANDS to transfer the fried calamari. Waiters, no matter how clean their hands might actually be should not be using their hands (especially in front of restaurant guests) to handle food, taste food, or transport food. I am actually disgusted with her behavior and left a lower than average tip (10-15% of the bill) in which she shook her head as she saw it... In retrospect, I shouldn't have given any tip at all.\\n\\nAlso, as I went to the bathroom I was disappointed to see boxes of Barilla Fettucine downstairs, which means that they don't make the fettucine pasta fresh / in-house. There's nothing authentic about the bad service (good Italian restaurant service is the complete opposite of what you'll experience at Giacomo's) nor the boxed mass-produced pasta.\\n\\nOverall, even if the food was decent, the service left me extremely disappointed. Unless you want to inhale your food and pay all within 30 minutes, I would not recommend you come here.

The food is great, portions are good, lovely ambience (especially in the summer when the patio is open), and never had a bad experience with service despite the place being busy.

The waffles are just OK in my opinion - some people love them but I think they are pretty standard.

I didn't try the sushi here yet but I hear its good. So lets get down to the food.\\n\\nI went in for lunch so my first instinct was to go for the lunch specials, don't ask why. I ordered the cliche chicken teriyaki lunch box. It is more than enough for one person I have to say. I didn't end up finishing it. It came with the usual miso soup in the beginning. What can you say about miso soup? Its miso, and its soup. Don't laugh at me. Anyway, the lunch box comes with rice, sushi (which I didn't eat), chicken teriyaki (or whatever you ordered duh), vegetables, tofu and some sort of an omelet (scallions maybe?). The chicken could've been juicier though it wasn't dry or anything. The rest was all really good. Oh, we also ordered the scallion seafood pancake for appetizers and that was awesome! It came with the regular kimchee, bean sprouts etc etc. and some spicy soy sauce thingy. I would highly recommend this. This place is pricier for dinner entrees. Also, pricier than some of the other restaurants around.\\n\\nAll in all, good experience. Good food, good atmosphere and good servers.

Nice little get-away.  And now they have a wine-tasting room.  AWESOME.  $15 a plate - and it's all you can eat.\\n\\nRandom tidbit:  We've had Salt Lick bbq at other places besides the restaurant, such as my fiance's company party last week, and I'm not sure what happens to the brisket, but it's not as tender as when it's served at the restaurant.  I'm not sure if it's cooked at the restaurant, and then carried to the location and reheated, or cooked at the location (away from the restaurant).

That was one big lie!! Also the other reviews of the 5 stars on here I belive are friends of the owner or know them personally since they are all big lies! The only real review on here is the one from Amy T., but I wish I trusted that one bad review I usually never trust a bad review when the rest are amazing! To list off all the pro's and con's:\\nPro's:\\n1) The resturant was clean\\n2) The bathrooms were very clean\\nCon's:\\n1) Upon entering the resturant since it does open at 5pm and we had arrived at 5:30pm it was a terrible experience and unprofessional! For starters you open the door there are no customers at the resturant and apparently no server! No joke took us about 10 minutes for someone to even notice us even being in the resturant after a loud irritating bell sounded off should've alerted the waiter in the back! \\n2) Just because the resturant was clean the cleaning detergent they used smelled very strong a lot like clorox clean up, either way I would not have minded much if they at least opened a door or aired out the smell before allowing guests to come in! They open at 5pm that's plenty of time to air out a small place.\\n3) The waiter that served us very unprofessional, resembled a high schooler who had no clue what is and isn't on the menu had to look at the menu himself. After requesting something that IS LISTED ON THE MENU I was told that is no longer served and it was supposed to have been removed, so fine thats okay I pick something else instead.\\n4) Now to weed out some of the lying reviews on here! The review from Tarek M. that picture posted of the nice tea and tea cup was what I was in the mood for that day, but of course when asking our waiter about if they have fresh hot tea he said no we have unsweetened ice tea so I just took that instead was not too happy about it and I also ordered a water, but when the drinks come out I was expecting to see 3 drinks, nope only 2 came out one was the unsweetened tea for me and a water for the person with me...took the waiter 30 minutes to get me a water! A flag should have gone off in my head then, but me being the nice person I was still being patient and willing to give it a chance!\\n5) Also the comment made by Nora M. was another lie and I quote \\"They also had different drinks that I haven't tried before that were very good such as Vemto (raspberry flavored)\\" I know what a Vimto is and had requested if they had that drink was also looking forward to that, but of course should have guessed no we do not serve that here. Another red flag goes off!\\n6) The food took too long I understand it is made fresh, but I cook at home and it does not take me that long to cook for 2 people since not a single soul was in that resturant besides me and the person that was with me, but before the waiter could run to the back and inform the staff of our order I had informed him that someone has a severe intolerence to milk so if possible to please make sure everything is clean, but I know when I am being lied to since the nice thing about a severe intolerence is that you can't hide it from me once I start to react! If you wished to not honor my wishes please inform me since throwing up due to the intolerence for almost 3 hours of dry heaving until I see blood is not a good thing for my health!\\n7)THE FOOD WAS BLAND AND NO SPICES! and I love using different spices! I was expecting a little spicy since I have friends who are Indonesian and they use so many different lovely spices and flavors this was a joke! The food could have even used some salt and pepper at least, the shrimp with tomatoe was no joke tomatoe paste that was not even fully desolved and water!\\n8) Now what really irritated me also was the music, but not a fan for hearing profanity in my music. With that being said a song that shouts out the F word is NOT a KID FRIENDLY PLACE TO ME! Also I did not see as to why the music was full profanity and in english I was expecting a more Middle eastern or Indonesian music to be played since that was the theme of the resturant an boy was I wrong!\\n9) Also the talking loud in another language in front of customers is something I find disrespectful mainly when that young waiter is busy talking to someone that works at the store next to them as if this restaurant is some kind of joke and so these customers are also no big deal! Talking bad in another language is also not smart since technology has greatly evolved and google translate also has a great way of translating from any language to english!\\n10) After almost an hour and a half of this place being open and we still seemed to be the only two guests made a lot more sense as to why this place had no customers and the other two places next to it on each side were doing much better!\\n11) In the end I still wanted tea so we went to Bosphorus which was less then 10 min away! No comparison!!"},{"name":"Pino's Pizza","address":"1920 Beacon St","city":"Brighton","stars":"4","text":"Update:  I've since dropped a star.

But, she couldnt express enough how rich and buttery everything was. By the end she was scraping her plate because it was so tasty. \\nAlthough, to cut everything down: mine was two slices of toasted bread with two kinds of cheese, melted, then put together. I got a side salad, but it was just some escarole with cut tomatoes drizzled with oil, vinegar, salt and pepper. This entree, was 10 smackers. \\nMy friends dish was two poached eggs on top of an english muffin, which of course is then topped with hollandaise sauce.

The menu says they've been open since 1977.  The restaurant is located next to Ansley Mall near one of my favorite Thai restaurants, King and I.  Across the street is Top Spice (Thai and Malaysian cuisine), so there are a lot of good options for Thai food near Ansley Park.\\n\\nIf presentation and ambiance are your thing, go to Top Spice.  If you want great Thai food for dine-in or take-out, go with King and I.  If you want outstanding and friendly service, Bangkok Thai trumps both.\\n\\nThe restaurant has a casual atmosphere.  It's a sit-down place, but the decor is minimal.  You're coming here strictly for the food.  They could stand to update the interior, but I thought that to myself when I first stepped inside 10+ years ago.  Window treatments are nothing more than standard metal blinds, giving you a glimpse of the sometimes-seedy parking lot and Piedmont Ave.\\n\\nBangkok Thai's menu is reasonably and competitively priced (for good reason).  It has most of the main Thai staples from curry to noodles.  They've renamed some common dishes.  For example, their red and green curries are called \\"Ruby\\" and \\"Jade\\" curries, respectively.  The tom kha (coconut) soups are called \\"Fowl Play\\" soups.  Here are some items I've tried at this restaurant and are worth a look:\\n\\nAppetizers:\\nSatay - skewered chicken served with peanut sauce and spices\\nYum Woon Sen - bean thread noodles with ground pork, onion, scallions, lime juice, and hot chili\\n\\nSpecials/Curries:\\nSpicy Catfish - served with curry sauce, basil, and bell pepper\\nPanang Curry - coconut milk-based curry\\n\\nBeverage:\\nThai Tea - served with ice and sweetened with sugar and condensed milk\\n\\nI like the condiments served with the Satay.  Along with sweet peanut sauce, it also comes with a small dish of chopped, vinegared vegetables such as cucumber and red onion.  The chicken was tender and moist enough.  The Yum Woon Sen noodles are made out of mung bean.  They're a clear, thinner, and more slippery noodle.  This dish is normally served with shrimp, but I ordered mine without.  It's a sour and spicy app.\\n\\nBoth the Spicy Catfish and Panang Curry were OK.  The catfish filets were deep-fried and rather succulent.  I had the Panang Curry with chicken, though you can have it served with pork, beef, shrimp, or tofu too.  The chicken was rubbery, but the sauce was good.  Mild and creamy.  Generally, food was alright, but presentation could be more appealing.\\n\\nThai Tea was amazing.  Mix vigorously.  Try and enjoy it or you'll drink it too fast and have to order another.\\n\\nBangkok Thai is open five days a week for lunch, seven days a week for dinner.

It was very obvious they over booked themselves from the second we walked in. Now the food was delicious. We tried a new appetizer cauliflower and feta and that was ok. The Caesar salad was a really big let down for me :( it has like 3 mini croutons and a lot of head lettuce. Everything else we tried was a home run, however. The chicken Parmesan was fabulous. The carbonara, bread and burger everyone enjoyed. The dessert was a hit as well. The tiramisu is some of the best I ever had. We had a nice server but, you could tell she was overwhelmed. Drinks took a long time. If was really loud in there. Overall, the food was good I would likely give it another shot...."},{"name":"Giacomo's Ristorante - Boston","address":"355 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"This is my favorite Italian place in Boston.

Maybe if they should marinate the meat before cooking ...Finally I gave up and squirted on my faithful companion to all food, Ketchup.\\n\\nThe good: The chicken was VERY tender. It's very hard to get juicy chicken, and to get it at a semi-fast food restaurant is pretty impressive.

Next, I used to really like this place when I worked for a nearby firm.  I visited regularly, knew the owner well enough to engage in small talk and trusted them with my lunch. During a recent visit, they were in a bind because the customer in front of me misordered, resulting in mustard on my Italian sub. The sandwich maker, who had taken our orders, didn't catch it.  I agreed to take it anyway, in lieu of having them remake it and slow down the entire process.  But also, I was curious as to how they react, if at all. So, how was I rewarded?  A small discount? No.  Chips? No. Have a nice day? No.  The cashier, with owner looking on, offered to let me buy chips and soda at the regular price. When I politely declined, I was summarily dismissed. I will revisit this spot in hopes of giving it another star, but as those few readers of mine know, this space is equally about the dining experience as it is the food.\\nAn amendment is being added due to proprietor Claudio's gracious invitation to have lunch gratis. A fine showing of hospitality.  In addition, he is correct, the broad use of the term deli is apropos here, a shop selling prepared meats.

If you're craving red meat and don't have the patience to take chances on the quality, come here. Spend a little extra and get one of the sauces. Completely unnecessary -- but these are top-notch sauces you're not going to find at the grocery, so a steak goes from great to really great.\\n\\nSave room for dessert.

When the food arrived, and the waiter handed me my plate, I almost fell over, so heavy was it.  I was thankful, however.  At my first bite, I began weeping, uncontrollably.  I never wanted the BBQ experience to end.  The sauce was tangy, the beef was tender, the bread that accompanied it soft and pillowy. I like neither coleslaw nor potato salad, but the Salt Lick iterations of these sides was German-style.  No mayo, just pure and wonderful flavor.  I couldn't get enough (that's a lie--I have the fickle appetite of an infant, and was full after a few bites).  \\n\\nI don't know how I could have forgotten an experience so wonderful, so life-changingly good.

The chili aioli was my favourite part of the plating (which was beautiful, by the way) and I swirled up as much as I could in the tender squid. It's important to note the calamari is not fried like at pubs or Greek restaurants and that's okay because the veal inside was very tender. I would have liked a little more veal as my calamari cups were not completely outstretched with veal.\\n\\nThe pasta of the day was a crocchiette (cup-shaped pasta) plate with the dressings of dried sage, arugula, and butternut squash topped with parmesan. Man the pasta cups were al dente to a T! Each bite had a satisfying chomp to it and I could get behind the dried sage which added an herby taste that wasn't too overwhelming. Too bad it was hard to taste the fresh parmesan because there wasn't too much of it, but this will be great for mild cheese lovers.\\n\\nLast but not least was the Liege Waffle. I didn't get to eat this in the restaurant (more on that later), so the photo is taken back at my office desk. This waffle had a chewy and somewhat chewy texture to it.

The udon noodle soup was everything I expected, hot tasty broth with soft noodle, that's all I need in the cold days! The roll was also great, not like those everything-fried-covered-in-Mayo ones. The hot pot was good, though we didn't read the description carefully and got the wrong broth, we still quite enjoyed it. The broth came in a traditional pot with clear broth (or water? it's kinda bland), while meat and veggie were presented in the plates. Our cute waiter took about 15 minutes to put the veggies into the pot, and he did a great job making them look sooooooooooo good. He told us to cook the meat for 8 seconds in the boiling broth, and then eat with two different kinds of special sauces. It tasted good:)\\n\\nAmbience and decor is good, dining utensils were delicate, especially the tea pot and cups our green tea came in.

The calzone is stuffed with different meats, mozzarella and really really outstanding ricotta cheese.  It is juicy, gooey, spicy on the inside (a lot of hot peppers in this bad boy), perfectly crusty on the outside.  Seriously, nothing you can do to make it better.

I have never in my life been to a restaurant with so many employees who were this rude.\\n\\nWhen you get to the restaurant you will see an hour long line outside waiting to be seated. When you get closer to the door, the host will come out and ask you the number in your party. When it is finally your time to go in, the host will come out and yell out the number of people in your party then tell you a general area of the restaurant where your table is and then walk away, For my party of 4 we were told \\"In the front\\".\\n\\nThe restaurant is very small. As we walked through the door, a party of four in the front of the restaurant began getting up from their seats to leave. Because there was hardly enough room for one person forget about two, I decided to step to the side by the door to let them out. Before they had even passed, our waitress began screaming at us \\"In the front! In the front! Just go! In the front!\\" When the other party had finally left, we went to our table which was actually in the back by the bar/kitchen (we knew this was our table because it was the only clean an empty table in the whole restaurant, there are only about 10 to begin with).\\n\\nWe sat at our table for a good 5 minutes before our waitress came over and asked us if we had been to the restaurant before somewhat confused (what could possibly be so unique about an Italian restaurant in Little Italy?) we said no. \\"Well let me get you menus then\\" She then proceeded to patronizingly explain that the menu is the same as what was on the blackboard and that there were entrees on both sides of the menu (wow who knew?).\\n\\nWe were given about 2 minutes to decide which would rarely be enough to even agree on an appetizer but fortunately we spent a good 15 minutes on line staring at the menu so most of us already knew what we wanted. The waitresses yell the appetizers across the room to the kitchen (which again, was in the room just behind a bar which made the entire room even hotter than it was outside) They would add a 'please' to the end of their yell, as if that made it polite. After writing down our entrees, the waitress then lectured us about how we needed to put our bread plates in front of us (then why did you set them on the corners of the table?) \\"Oh no that ones not yours this one is yours.\\" She then made us pass our plates to the left. She then lectured us about how we needed to make room in the middle of our table for the fried calamari which wouldn't even be served for another 10 minutes.\\n\\nThe restaurant is far too small only out done by the size of our table. We had four people huddled around a small square table that two people would feel cramped at. We were close enough to the table next to us that we could breath on them. There was no room to be comfortable, I had to sit sideways so that I could get as close to the table as possible. And yet I still was smacked across the back every time a server walked past. I had to bend down and lean over the table just to take a sip of my drink because if my elbow ever left the perimeter of the table, my elbow would have been rammed and my drink sent flying, While taking one such sip the waiter brought our appetizer and almost smacked me in the head with it because he couldn't be bothered to wait two seconds for me to get out of the way. This wasn't the last time calamari was shoved in my face though. One piece had fallen onto the table while transferring to my plate (not a big deal, but I didn't really trust the table to be clean enough to eat off of). I put the dirty calamari on my plate when I was done, and so when the waitress came to take my plate she held it up to my face and said \\"finish this last piece\\", yea no thanks.\\n\\nThe only slight glimmer in this train wreck was that the food was decent, but hey if you can't find a decent Italian restaurant in the North End that doesn't treat you like a herd of cattle, the North End would have gone under a long time ago. The waiters would clear your plate as soon as you finished your last bite even though everyone was still eating, one by one they would take someone's plate. Literally as the last plate was being taken, our waitress slapped the bill on the table.\\n\\nThere really is no excuse for how god awful this restaurant is. Do let anyone tell you that this is a genuine Italian experience. I grew up in an Italian household. I have been to many different parts of Italy. I have never seen a waiter shoving whole pieces of bread in his face in full view of customers. I have never seen a waitress grab an elderly customer's chair and move it with her in it to \\"balance the table out\\". Don't give this sorry excuse for a restaurant your business or your dignity. If you're going to the North End, there are plenty of other restaurants that you can get a good Italian meal."},{"name":"Tube","address":"18 NW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3","text":"Rude crowd, small dance floor, cover charge, expensive drinks, lousy bartender...

You can get everything here from breakfast till midnight, coffee, fresh squeezed juices, even beer and wine. The food is as diverse as well, they have really good salads and awesome comfort food such as the chicken quesadillas and sweet potato fries (which come with three very delicious dipping sauces).  This is a great place to come alone or with friends or to meet someone for a first casual date.\\n\\nHowever, every rose has it's thorn and beware of the service here. If you are in a hurry or expect a full- fledged dining experience where you are going to be waited on hand and foot, it isn't going to happen here. Examples? The last time I came here, I waited at the front to be seated for ten minutes before I sat myself and then was moved to a smaller table by a waiter who said he wanted to save the table for a larger party. After telling him I had to seat myself, he apologized but then failed to give me a menu or offer me water or anything. He then abandoned me for twenty minutes, until I stole a menu from the table next to me and went up to the bar and told the woman that no one ever took my order and placed it with someone else. Good thing I did, because that waiter never came by the rest of the time. Another time I walked into this place during a BLIZZARD. There were less than five patrons in the entire establishment. This time, the waiter (a different one) gave me a menu but then never came back to take my order. I wasn't in a hurry because of the blizzard but after finishing three magazines and trying to get his attention numerous times (I had been there about 40 minutes) I just left. Another time the waitress completely LOST my credit card and I was there for at least thirty minutes while she looked for it frantically. She eventually did find it, but I was a little irritated. 90% of the people they hire here are idiots. You have to ask them constantly for things like menus, silverware, and water- over and over again. And it will take forever to get the check. I mean, FOREVER.\\n\\nI don't like supporting places that have terrible service, but what keeps me coming back is the fact that I like the food, diverse menu and ambiance- especially when it gets late and the options are limited. It's a nice place to go alone and watch the people on Newbury street and until I find somewhere else that I can bring my laptop and order breakfast at 11 pm I guess this place will have to do. I just have to definitely be in the mood to deal with the shitty service or at least be in the place to find how bad the service is slightly entertaining.\\n\\nIf you decide not to come here because of the crappy service, at least know that the bathrooms are pretty much the only public restrooms on Newbury street."},{"name":"Austin's Pizza Guadalupe","address":"2324 Guadalupe","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"Not sure why the bad reviews here, probably just college kids whining the food is bad when they're drunk... this place just happened to be close to my hotel I was staying at for a work trip.

While the food can be good, the stress of acquiring it is not worth while.  Well, I visited again today and I absolutely regretted stopping by.  Without a doubt the worst experience I've had in a restaurant in recent memory.  And of my 80 reviews, this place gets my worst rating ever.\\n\\nSo today, I walked by at 1145 and saw there were only 2 people in line. So, I thought I would give it a second shot.  A poor decision on my part.  \\n\\nAs always, its difficult to determine what you want due to the horrible menu layout and not being able to see most of the baked goods before you have to order.   However, I had my child with me so I quickly made a to go order after about a 5 minute wait for the 2 people in front of me to order.  A breakfast sandwich and a roast beef to go, simple enough.  Ohhh, no!\\n\\nI've avoided this place before because I have a handicap child.  Its difficult enough to get out to go eat and so my child doesn't bother other patrons I try to get \\"to go\\" orders to avoid bothering others.   I spent over 30 minutes in this place with my child and never received my food.\\n\\nAfter I ordered, the bakery filled with parents and children from the Children's museum and quickly all available space was filled to maximum capacity.  There was absolutely no where to stand in the bakery to wait for food (again because of the miserable layout of the restaurant). The bakery had taken in way more orders than they could fill.  I spent my wait dodging other patrons and holding my kid the entire time.  \\n\\nI waited an additional 25 minutes.  In the meantime, the 2 orders in front of me were filled and more than a dozen orders by people behind me were filled.  I was not the only one waiting.  Another person also waited a long time and went and inquired about where their order was.  \\"Oh, the grilled sandwiches take longer.\\" was the response.  Right!\\n\\nAfter this, I realized part of the problem was that those filling orders don't really like doing the grilled sandwiches which are more work, so if you order an easier item to make, you are more likely to get through the line faster.  A tip for those crazy enough to suffer through getting your food.  Don't order anything that sounds complex, they'll make you pay for it twice - first with your cash and second with your time.  Likewise, it seems there is a high error rate on the orders.  I watched 2 of the dozen orders that were filled after mine come back to the counter because their food either wasn't what they ordered or they were missing something.\\n\\nAfter I counted the 13th person behind me getting their order. I exploded.  I went to the front and demanded my order or my money.  The staff acted flabbergasted.  They then asked for my name to track down the order - they couldn't even find it.  They had no record that I had even ordered and NONE of my sandwiches had even been started.  \\n\\nI demanded my money back. Again, they couldn't even find my order in their own register.  I had to dig the receipt out of stuff to prove to them I had ordered and to get my money back.  Then, the line manager wanted my receipt to keep.  No way, I have it with me and I'll make sure to post it on another discussion board.  \\n\\nBottom line, this place may have good baked goods, but their operation SUCKS.  If they can't fill the orders they take, then they should take less orders.  I'll never enter this place again and I'll encourage others to avoid it.  It is literally easier and less time consuming to get dessert at Mike's Pastry on the North End, and you know that is what you are getting into when you go there - a mob of people, a long wait and a bad attitude.

Fun cocktails and mocktails, and finally a delicious lemon cheesecake to finish. Would definitely recommend for a fancy night out!\\n\\nBonus: some of the artists were at the restaurant and explained their work, which as cool.

We were greeted by the obvious owner-a Bostonian with deep Italian roots. We were fortunate enough to be seated at the only two counter seats. The equivalent of a VIP kitchen vantage viewing experience.  It was delightful. The food was amazing. It is clear that this owner has high expectations of his crew-from the delicious 'house sauce' to the way his kitchen crew shines the front of the 12 burner gorgeous gas stove in this cozy impeccable kitchen in the middle of dinner service hour. I love that he tallys his tickets at a table amidst his diners. The food is to die for.!  The garlic bread is the best either of us have ever tasted. The mussels & house sauce-we used the garlic bread to soak it up-it was amazing. The Chicken Marsala-Tony, our greeter & owner, was kind enough to accommodate my non red meat eating request and made it without the prosciutto-I used a spoon at the end to eat up every last bit of the light and flavorful sauce. I should mention that when u walk into this place the vibe is so welcoming, remember to look up-the tin roof is beautiful and there is an oil painting on the back side wall of a sea scape-I suspect it has a story behind it although I did not ask.

As a lifelong BBQ fanatic, this was a pilgrimage for me (although I nearly had to high-jack our bachelor party's plans to do it). For other Fort Worth denizens, Salt Lick kind of reminded me of the setup they have at Joe T's: cash only, sprawling outdoor complex with lots of seating. But naturally that is where the comparison ends. \\n\\nI am happy to say that Salt Lick lived up to its reputation. I have had BBQ in nearly every corner of the United States and this has to be some of the best I have had from a vendor, definitely the best brisket. Tried both types of brisket cuts and the most defining, the most delectable aspect about the brisket is the thick bark and the very sweet flavor that resides within it. The most flavorful brisket I have eaten. We had a great deal of leftovers and much to the chagrin of my friends, I continued to snack on them all throughout the weekend and thus the delightful Salt Lick smell  hounded us for the remainder our misadventures in Austin.\\n\\n\\nI also love to see BBQ with a bit of variation in it and Salt Lick has that in regards to their mustard-based BBQ sauce. As we all know, such sauces are usually restricted to the Carolinas and west of the Mississippi ketchup-based sauces usually carry the day  (as in Kansas City). Here in Texas either mostly Vinegar-based sauces are prominent or in the case of the places in Lockhart, sauce is not offered at all. Now, their sauce has more of a \\"Texas touch\\" to it so it does not taste exactly like a Carolinas mustard-based sauce either. Unique and delicious. \\n\\nHighly recommended and go in a group so you can try everything.

My friend had the Georgia Wild Shrimp and Grits and I ordered the Buffalo Shrimp Po' Boy and we were both very satisfied. The portions were generous, the service was expedient, the wait staff well-informed. I will definitely be coming back! \\n\\nI go here so frequently it's ridiculous. Comparable to Argosy or Brickstore. But somehow more convivial. Reminds me of the dwarven halls in LOTR. Is that beyond nerdy?

Wings is a good example of what I mean here. On my first trek here, I ordered the Chilean Chili, three pepper rated on the Wings scale. This may have been the biggest overpromise since George Lucas said he could recut s better version of Star Wars: A New Hope. On a spiciness scale of of one to ten, they'd warrant a negative number, although they had great flavor.\\n\\nThe next time there, I went to up my game. After the bartender talked me out of signing my life away for a challenge, I settled on the Jakarta Heat, the other three pepper sauce. This burned like an insult comic at the top of his game. In fact, they may have been too spicy. But the flavor was good as well.\\n\\nThe inconsistency of the heat is my one nit. My two nits are the inconsistency of the heat and the lack of meat on the wings. But in general, the sauces I tried (the Peri Peri, the Buffalo, and the Sweet Thai) had good flavor. The bartenders were also very friendly, and willing to find the NFL game I wanted to watch, in spite of only being able to have two different games on.\\n\\nThis really isn't a bad place to watch a game, drink a beer and eat some wings.

Now for $12 I expect a well crafted and/or a stiff drink (speaking from 13yrs of bartending experience).  My fiance received a drink that tasted watered down and devoid of any flavor.  I ordered a cocktail with bourbon and bitters--way too much bitters.  \\n\\nNow let's proceed to the salad course....steak house salad with blue cheese dressing.   It tasted pretty good to start, but as I got further into the salad I realized the bottom layer of lettuce was partially frozen.  And the bread was less than impressive--soft white bread without much of a crust.  \\n\\nFinally the main course delivered--a good suggestion from the waiter, who suggested that I order their most flavor full steak--the cowboy ribeye.  It was cooked to perfection with a great au poivre sauce.  If I based my experience entirely off this steak I would give it 4 stars, but too many other things went wrong with this experience.  My fiance struck out again--she ordered the filet topped with 3 shrimp.  The filet was grossly overcooked...a medium-well steak that should have been medium rare.  They were amazingly prompt in delivering a new steak which was cooked properly.  I will give them that.   Now the sides were not as impressive.  The broccolli tasted like it might have been frozen.  The asparagus was terrible--lacking in crispness and color. \\n\\nFor desert we had a duo of carrot cake and chocolate mouse.  The carrot cake was undercooked and lacked a rich cream cheese frosting (although it did have some nice spice).  The mouse was salty, which only seems appropriate for darker chocolate (and this was milk).  \\n\\nFinally, to really end the evening on a sour note the valet told me that they were unable to start my car--and that the battery was indeed dead (in the cold rain).  Mind you, when I had dropped the car off the battery was perfectly fine. They did offer to get jumper cables, which they did quickly.   They attached a battery charger with cables and it started immediately.  The next morning my car started immediately as well, which leads me to believe that the valets probably left a light on in the car.

The decor is, yes, a little cheesy - all grand scale and Italian-American movie classics like the Godfather(s), Goodfellas, and Raging Bull playing on loop on TVs on the central wall and this inexplicable St. Louis Arch-looking thing (I commend whoever gets seated at the table under that thing because you'll feel like you're at a wedding in the 80s. Actually, maybe I'm jealous.) in the middle of the main dining room, but the rest is all white linens and a single tea light and rose on each table. Classic. Service over the course of the meal was attentive, non-intrusive, and friendly.\\n\\nWithin minutes, our waiters (yes, plural... a waiter and a sidekick) arrived, the former rattling off the lengthy list of specials thoroughly and with a delightful Brooklyn Italian accent to boot (was it real? was it fake? I DON'T CARE.) to my delight. I ordered a cocktail and my boyfriend ordered a beer, and in the few minutes before those arrived, the sidekick brought over nice crusty Italian bread and olive oil for dipping. For an appetizer, we ordered the day's special - fried clams. They were fat, tender, and sweet, with deliciously light crispy batter, and whipped tartar sauce - delicious! It's tough to screw up a fried clam, but these really were great, and my boyfriend mopped up the rest of the tartar sauce with some bread, because you can take the couple out of Allston, but you can't take the Allston out of the couple, y'know? For entrees, he ordered the short rib special, which had lobster meat and was served over (homemade, of course) papardelle, and I had the swordfish special, which was done puttanesca style over spaghetti. Both meats were cooked perfectly - tender, fresh, and not overwhelmed by their accompaniments. The pasta, as fresh pasta tends to be, was to die for. Though I could have finished off my meal, I saved some for today's lunch, and I don't even feel bad that I'll be the person on my office floor nuking the fish, because nothing's gonna rain on my swordfish parade.\\n\\nDessert was creme brulee, which we split, and a decaf cappuccino for me. I'm not a huge creme brulee fan, as it tends to be too heavy, especially following a rich meal, but this was light, almost like a whipped pudding, with the usual delicious caramelized sugar crust, and a few strawberries and chocolate drizzles on the plate. It was completely delicious, especially with my cappuccino (fresh whipped cream and cinnamon on top), and we pretty much licked the plate clean. (How rude, you might think, but considering I spent the appetizers-'n-cocktails-time finding clever ways to deposit my olive pits, this was an improvement.)\\n\\n(Hint: the napkin in the lap hides EVERYTHING.)\\n\\nThis is certainly a pricey splurge place, but the food was genuinely, shockingly delicious, and I'll gladly return here for any remotely special occasion (or non-occasion, such as a Wednesday, because they have lobster mac and cheese on Wednesdays.

Actually, it looks a lot like the cafeteria at the Aquarium, glass tile and little kids and all.

Why would every taco plate they offer be three of a kind?  Three fish tacos or three pork tacos... how boring would that be (even if they were good)?  The only way to mix and match is to order a la carte, which I'm not sure is an option on the menu.

I love spicy so this was right up my alley. You could tell that the fish was fresh and I was satisfied. Lastly, I got an entree because I was just so hungry. I had the yellow chicken curry. I love yellow curry with carrots and potatoes but it is not that popular of a dish in Atlanta. I was happy to find a Thai restaurant with the yellow curry on the menu. The sauce was warm and flavorful. It had that little kick of spiciness but I definitely could have used a bit more spicy. The vegetables were mostly cooked through but some were a little firmer than my liking. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed the dish. I had some to take home, so that was great. My friend ordered this amazing sushi roll called the Kaboom Maki. It was a fried roll with shrimp tempura but then they rest it on a sauce of panang curry. The flavors went so well together.

Perhaps that's because the restaurant is such an institution, or perhaps it's because it's so unassuming. Whatever the reason, Old Mohawk deserves a little love tossed its way.\\n\\nThe atmosphere is a definite step above dive bar, but it also has a lot more character than a standard tavern or whatnot. A large wooden bar juts out in the middle of the restaurant, but there's also ample seating -- the usual blend of booths and standalone tables. In other words, there's really nothing exceptional about the feel of the Old Mohawk...yet there's a certain comfort to it that I can't quite put my finger on. \\n\\nThe menu is surprisingly large, and features a wide array of sandwiches, burgers, and other items -- none of which are overly pricey. I have to admit that I get the same thing every time I go in: a French dip. It's what brought me there in the first place, early this year. I had been craving a good French dip, and couldn't find one anywhere. On my girlfriend's suggestion (she'd been there before), we tried Old Mohawk, and indeed, the French dip was *exactly* what I was looking for. Here's the thing: we normally like to explore different restaurants and try new cuisines etc., but there's something to be said about having a classic done right. And that's really what Old Mohawk is all about. Based on what others I've been there with have had, as well as my own experience, there's nothing overly exceptional about the food, and yet all of it is essentially good, familiar food done well. \\n\\nI also want to mention the service. The servers have been good for all the visits, but on my most recent trip, when the restaurant was almost full, I was particularly impressed. Our food took a little while longer to come out than usual, but none of us were concerned. That being said, I noticed our server (without checking in with us) was regularly eyeing our table and looking back toward the kitchen with a concerned look on her face. This was really subtle, but I could tell that she *cared* that our food had yet to arrive, and it looked as though she went back to the kitchen a couple of times to get them to hurry it up. Most servers would just wait for the order to be up and serve it when ready, so I was simply a little impressed by our server's attentiveness. \\n\\nUltimately, the Old Mohawk isn't the kind of place I could give a five-star review to, but it really is an excellent place for when you want a certain kind of comfort food in a very casual, relaxed atmosphere."},{"name":"Row 34","address":"383 Congress St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I literally love this place.

I have, of course, had Salt Lick at the airport but it took me awhile to finally get the chance to make it out to the real Driftwood spot, and boy is the experience totally different! The Salt Lick is located on a beautiful ranch with tons of open space. While it is a bit out of the way, I think it's one of those places where you could really make a whole day out of it. It's a completely different experience from the classic wait-3-hours-in-front-of-a-food-truck. You can take your time here, enjoy the local hand-crafted drinks, eat comfortably, and most importantly - not wait in a crazy massive line.  \\n\\nI was lucky enough to come on a weeknight for a work outing. To start, we enjoyed some of their local wine outside on this gorgeous wood patio that felt rustic and calming. Both the reds and whites served were delicious. We then moved indoors for the real feast. Plates and plates of brisket, sausage, pork belly, pulled pork, sides, breads, and the whole galore were served. The meat was cooked to perfection and melted in my mouth... There were buckets of delicious BBQ sauce, but honestly the meat didn't need any sauce because it was so moist. However, the real treat were the burnt ends. Trust me, ASK FOR BURNT ENDS. As if the meat wasn't already tasty enough, the burnt ends had their special heavenly seasoning smoked and crisped into the ends of the brisket. \\n\\nOverall: This is first class BBQ on a gorgeous property with phenomenal service. It's definitely all about the experience here, so I can see this being an amazing place to take out-of-town visitors to, or just to get away and enjoy a day of drinks and melt-in-your-mouth BBQ."},{"name":"The Salty Pig","address":"130 Dartmouth St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Delicious pizza, great charcuterie, fantastic cocktails and wonderful beer selection.

My friend and I put our name down, and the hostess said she would call us when a table is ready. Typical setup. They called us once, and I missed the call, so they gave away the table. Totally understandable. I asked to be put on the list again, and when I got the second call, I said we'll head over there in a minute. When we get there, mind you it was a minute or so after I got the call, there were two couples checking for tables. The good hostess who was trying to get everyone settled in gets overtaken by the horrible hostess who thought the good hostess couldn't handle it and ends up giving our table to the people who just came in. After realizing that the table was meant for us, the horrible hostess just gives us this fake, smug smile, and says that we're the first on the list. It was probably the most irritating thing I've ever experienced at a restaurant. Seriously, not even a freaking apology!!! Not sincere at all, and you can tell she was so fake and plastic about it. Thankfully, the good hostess apologized about the whole fiasco (particularly noting that she knew the table was ours and it was the other hostess's fault lol). Ugh, it angers me thinking about that absolutely horrible hostess.\\n\\nHowever, we get a table a little later, and press on with the meal. We ordered a charcuterie and a pizza (The Salty Pig), but the wait was longer than expected...MUCH LONGER. I'm pretty sure it doesn't take over 40 minutes to slice the meats and cheese and put it in a board. The pizza took another 40 minutes after we finished the charcuterie. It was pretty much a 2 hour dinner where we talked, not over dinner/while we were eating. We were talking to do something to distract our growling stomachs while we waited for food. Honestly, I would have given this review 3 stars, if only our waitress came by and checked in on us and apologized about the delay. I know that kitchen delays can't be blamed on the waitress, but letting us know/doing something about it helps a lot actually. Alas, she did nothing of the sort.

Delicious food and attentive service. Def recommend!"},{"name":"Simplicity Wine & Eats","address":"4801 Burnet Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Nothing beats good, inexpensive wine and tasty munchies after a long, stressful parent-teacher meeting, the topic of which is your behaviorally challenged child.  Trust me on this one.  Simplicity really came through for me when I needed them.  \\n\\nFirst - to drink.  Simplicity has lots of wines by the glass (range of $5-$9 per glass), some really inexpensive 2-glass carafes (at $7), and many full bottles to choose from.  We had three wines by the glass (the Saint Chapelle dry Riesling from Idaho was a favorite), plus 5 different small appetizers.  The total for everything was right around $40, which seemed very reasonable to us, seeing as how it pretty much eliminated the need to have dinner.\\n\\nThe 5 apps we got were:\\n\\n1.  Duck roulade - three tiny pieces on crunchy toast - flavored with blueberries.  Small but really really delicious.  On the \\"specials\\" menu, so may not be available all the time.  Highly recommend. \\n\\n2.  Shrimp & grits - 4 big plump grilled shrimp on a bed of cheesy grits.  Wonderful.  Also on the \\"specials\\" menu.  \\n\\n3.  Tortilla espanola - not a Mexican tortilla - instead, a traditional Spanish wedge of fluffy scrambled egg.  This one was a bit bland and came blisteringly hot outside and cool to the touch on the inside - microwaved, perhaps?\\n\\n4.  Samosas - I love samosas, and these were very tasty.  Thick, deep fried shells with a slightly spicy puree of peas and potatoes.  Served with tamarind and mint sauces.  Deep-fried carbs  stuffed with more carbs - what could be better.\\n\\n5.  Slow roasted garlic - two complete garlics, roasted and served intact. You dig the individual cloves from the papery shells and spread them on the nice, chewy bread provided. I needed to add a slight sprinkle of salt, but otherwise delicious.\\n\\nNote that all the food is served on compostable paper plates and all the utensils are corn-based plastic or bamboo single serve ice cream-type spatulas.  It does detract somewhat from the atmosphere, but I really appreciate the commitment to not producing any landfill waste.  (See menu for more explanation of their \\"green\\" philosophy.) Nice going.\\n\\nThe interior of Simplicity is eclectic - sort of like Epoch Coffee but more upscale.  I liked it - fun and inviting.  It's a lot bigger on the inside than you would think from the small store front, and the tables are nicely spaced inside.  When we were there, the music wasn't too loud, and there weren't too many people, so the noise level was reasonable for conversation.  Given all the hard surfaces (ceiling, walls, concrete floor) though, I bet the place gets really loud when fuller.  \\n\\nFinally, I should note that the staff is super-friendly.  They made a point to tell us that (a) they were really happy we chose to come in, (b)  this was a laid back place to hang, and (c) if we didn't like anything, just say the word, and they'd fix it.  Really nice.  I do not consider myself the \\"cool' type that usually gets extra attention from snooty waiters, so when servers are especially nice to me, I appreciate it.  \\n\\nI have to agree with some of the other reviewers that the outside really needs a make-over. The fake grass is tacky, the font in the signage looks cheap and the newly installed \\"patio\\" has chairs, tables and partitions that would look more at home in a DMV waiting area.    The low-class exterior does a terrible disservice to the great interior, food and staff.  \\n\\nI'm totally excited by having Simplicity in the neighborhood, and given the decent prices on wines by the glass, I'm glad the place is within walking distance of the house.  Yay.  South Burnet Road, you are really coming along.  Maru, Blue Star, Apothecary, Pacha, Cosina de Consuelo, Omelettry, Sampaio, Sarah's Mediterranean, a soon-to-open Torchy's, and now Simplicity.

Once we were seating though it took 25 minutes and three different waitresses who came over to ask if we've been helped yet to finally get our order taken. 25 minutes is a long amount of minutes for a relatively dead Sunday afternoon. Finally, once our order was taken, we got TWO meals we didn't order. \\n\\nAfter wrapping our meals to go because after an hour we didn't have the time or patience to finish (or even begin) our meals in the restaurant, the manager didn't offer anything for our troubles and we were presented with a check for the full amount.\\n\\nI think it's finally time to convince my dad that we should meet for lunch elsewhere.

That area gets crowded, too, and then you have to push back through the line people to get back out of the door. 8 of 10 times that I've been at this location, while waiting in the holding pen for my drink, an employee has crossed through said area with a bag of rubbish to deposit in the \\"staff only\\" area directly across from the registers.

I can't finish another bite.\\nB: You're going to let a pig's head defeat us?!\\nMe: Okay... one more bite. That's it.\\n\\n----\\n\\nI'd been reading about Craigie on Main for ages on Cocktail Virgin Slut's blog and had been meaning to try out their drinks for months. The boy was thoughtful enough to snag us a booking for Christmas Eve, after I landed on an inbound flight from Chicago. \\n\\nAs fortune would have it, some poor schmucks had to cancel their chef's table reservation, so we lucked into getting the best seats in the house - right at the kitchen counter, overlooking all the dishes being plated and sent off to their destinations!\\n\\nNot only were the servers extremely professional and generally efficient (sans one minor incident where a drink order got mysteriously held up), they were also a wealth of knowledge about cocktail lore as well. Not just one of them. -All- of them. Not dissimilar to Blue Duck Tavern in DC, it appears that while we had a primary server, the setup is much like team service, where anyone is happy to help you with putting in an order or bringing you whatever you need. Quite grand, really.\\n\\nAnd beyond luscious libations (have the bartenders craft you something!), Craigie on Main's cuisine is beyond reproach (if you don't mind a touch more salt than necessary). We opted for a ever-so-slightly more conservative $65 a head three-course menu rather than either of the chef's tasting menus, as we wanted a bit more control over our choices and a possibly less food. We failed.\\n\\nThe Spanish octopus starter was delightfully tender and flavourful, however the bone marrow 'small' course was absolutely massive. Two huge... I don't even know what they were... femurs?... came with some huge slices of bread and a small pinch-bowl of salt. Absurdity. Delicious, fatty absurdity.\\n\\nAnd although our server warned us the pig's head would take about an hour to arrive, it was definitely to our table within thirty minutes of putting in our order. And it was epic. Served much like the mu shu pork I grew up with (don't judge, I was an Americanised Chinese kid), you're ostensibly meant to slather some house-made hoisin sauce on their pancakes, toss on some posh slaw, and nom away on the fatty, crispy, succulent meat. I loved that upon delivery of the dish, the only instructions provided were these: everything on the pig's head can be eaten, including the eyeball; get messy. So we did.\\n\\nAnd whilst the desserts were a great way to polish off a meal (along with a glass of Fernet, of course), they were utterly unnecessary. We were barely able to finish off 90% of the pig's head, let alone anything else. The trio of sorbets were great for cleansing palates, though.\\n\\nBuck for buck, I'd argue that Hungry Mother is a better deal, however there's a lot to be said about paying for dinner and a show - at least at the chef's table. Though you'll be shelling out for it, our dinner at Craigie on Main was virtually flawless.

This place claims (while you're on hold via telephone) to be rated \\"the #1 pizza in AMERICA\\" that's right, the entire country.  Rated higher than Bianco, rated higher than Delfina and Una too.  Wow, quite a claim.\\nI ordered the gold standard of pizzas, the Margherita.  The simple elegance ot the pie with just a few ingredients makes it the clear pie to prove a place gets it right.  It's easy to over do the ingredients and create a sloppy mess. Fortunately, these chefs got it right, sort of.\\nI've had a pie from the original Una in NYC another joint that cooks \\"until we run out of dough.\\" That pie with heirloom tomato marinara and shaped like a 3 year old tossed the dough, was good but was about $25, maybe it was $28 dollars.  So I ordered the $19 Margherita assuming I'd get the same hipster, tatted out, too kool for any skool, pizza vibe.\\nI was surprised when I got to the place.  Up front it's not much, in the back of the house it's like Buca de Beppo with tables in the \\"kitchen.\\"  3 massive ovens with bakers are in the back and big communal tables join them in a lively, raucous room.  Clearly this is a place for many friends, mucho beer and a few pies to share. I was missing out just getting a pie for myself to take home.\\nI got the pie which was HUGE, enough to feed 3 people!  The crust was chewy and pleasantly though close to too much, burnt with the essence of coal (call it wood fired if you must, ahem).  To my mouth the crust texture wasn't much, I prefer more bite and less latexy chew.  The cheese and basil were modestly distributed, a good thing for this pie.  The marinara though was far from subtle. HUGE chunks of garlic really overwhelmed the entire pie.  \\nMaybe it's part of their big ol' \\"that's amore\\" Italiano thing to throw in CHUNKS of uncooked garlic hoping anyone mentions it and they can blast you with their \\"mama mia you don no nuttin about apizza pie\\" and shame one into their car and back to another artisanal food source? I'm telling you, it's heavy handed garlic.  Yep, maybe with enough beer, noise and a pretty girl to impress I might sing a different song but any other time, no.\\nWould I go again?

It's hard to make poutine anything less than amazing in my book, but this was just meh.  My entree was the chicken fried steak.  It just wasn't good.  It was crumbly and completely devoid of flavor.  In DC's defense, the mashed potatoes it was served on were excellent, but that still doesn't excuse the lousy chicken fried steak.\\n\\nMy wife had the shrimp po boy and a side of jalepeno cornbread.  I've never eaten blander cornbread.  No flavor whatsoever.  My wife said the po boy was decent, but it's unclear how a simple sandwich with a side of Sysco potato chips should cost nine dollars.  I guess that's the overhead of their location, but if so, they really should have found a spot in Italian Village or something.\\n\\nWhich brings me to the space itself.  I know they tried to make it seem down-homey, but it doesn't.  It feels like a cold, generic space.  \\n\\nThe service was okay.  We had a really bro-ey server who was pleasant and hustled, but was just kind of douchey.

We were told it would be over an hour wait for a table at 8pm.  Note this is a CASH ONLY restaurant.  ATMs are available everywhere onsite for the fee of $2.  They had potable bathrooms in a trailer which was the most disgusting bathroom I have ever seen and been in.  Toilets were over flowing the smell was beyond disgusting.  We could not even use the bath room.  We ended up sneaking into the restaurant to use the restroom.  Yes there were long lines and lady's asking for the next stall for toilet paper.  Common sense people your know your restaurant is busy. You need to have a bathroom staff on those busy days.  \\n\\nWe sat down pretty quick. 20 minutes pretty happy that it was not over an hour. My friend did all the ordering. We had brisket, sausage, pork ribs, beef ribs, potato salad, cole slaw, pickles, onions, and bread. They were all really great choices. We were stuff!!!  And we had left overs galor!  \\n\\nHence my 3 star rating.  I deducted one star because of the bathrooms being in disgust. i deducted one star for service.  Our waiter was no where to be found.

Here's a course by course rundown:\\n\\nFirst \\nME: Winter Salad with fennel and feta foam - boo.Pretty mediocre, and the feta foam was a bit sad, buried under the greens. \\nBOY: Smoked Sablefish with pea puree - YUM! I could eat this every day. Smoky, rich and perfectly paired with the peas. I am craving this right now. \\n\\nSecond\\nME: Panfried Lingcod with 5 grain risotto\\nThe fish was delicious, and I really appreciated the tangy harissa paired with the nearly SE Asia risotto. The only problem I had was that the risotto was a bit...gummy. Risotto is meant to be unctuous and spread on the plate - this was molded into a lukewarm mound. A bit weird.\\nBOY: White wine Mussels with frites\\nSince a devastating mussel incident 5 years ago I can no longer partake, but I did sample the frites and the broth - yum!!! The only problem with the broth was that it was strangely bland. Boyfriend loved the mussels themselves, saying that they were lovely and tender and tasty, but the broth needed hella salt. \\n\\nThird\\nME: Cheese Plate\\nHuge disappointment.

Which were quickly hogged up by a group of hipster girls who were just standing there drinking wine. Even the lady who brought out our pizza mentioned they had already eaten and asked them if they needed anything else a polite way of asking them to move along. I had to ask them to move so we could sit as they were just standing around, they were offended and were rude but moved. I'll try to return next time I'm in town during a less busy time. Just because the pizza was so delicious."},{"name":"Antico Pizza","address":"1093 Hemphill Ave NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"This place is very unique.

I have been to other Hibachi restaurants and the food portions here left a lot to be desired as well. \\n\\nMy friend told the waitress it was my birthday (unknown to me) and I was greeted with a slice of cheesecake with a candle. I was surprised and happy. To my real surprise when the bill came I had a $7 charge for my slice of \\"surprise birthday\\" cheesecake. I questioned the waitress and she said well one of your friends said it was your birthday, although I never told them it was my birthday nor did my friend know of a charge (I have never been to an establishment that charges for the birthday surprise amenity, they may require ID, but never have I seen a charge). When leaving I mentioned to the manager that I did not ask for the cheesecake nor was my friend told that it would be a charge. I had already paid the $7 and let here know that for future reference they should make sure they inform people of the charge, the manager apologized, then told me that if I could tell her whose bill it should have been on she could credit me my $7 and charge them (which meant she totally missed the point I was making).  I paid the bill for me and my 2 friends; there was no bill for her to transfer the charge to. On top of that I have never been to an establishment where there is a party of 3 and they charge 18% gratuity automatically.

Being Vietnamese myself, I have never had Vietnamese food with an african twist.\\nI must say everything I had that night was delicious and the flavors all blended nicely. \\nFor appetizers, we had the fataya fish filled pastry.

She didn't know much about the wine on the menu (but hello...it's a pub) and had to ask twice about their Foursquare deal of a 'free glass of wine or champagne on your first check in) - that could happen to anyone.\\n\\nAll-in-all I'd like to come back for food and see how that aspect of the place is."},{"name":"Surly Girl Saloon","address":"1126 N High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Whether you're here for a deeply gratifying meal of Americana to the max or just a beer or twenty with friends, Surly Girl as good as it gets in the Short North. The decor alone, which gives it the feel of some of the grittier confederate dives I've visited in antebellum strongholds like Chalreston and Savannah, is worth the trip. The walls are painted a dark blood red color that would perfectly compliment the many leather bound books and rich mahogany woodwork of Hannibal Lector's personal library, and the mild glow given off by the chandelier in the front room seals the deal. The saloon feel is easily the most authentic that I've encountered anywhere north of the Mason-Dixon line, that's for sure.\\n\\nThe menu isn't too much of a deviation from what you'd find at any casual dining spot in the Short North, but they take their craft seriously here nonetheless. The spaghetti and meatballs dinner, which sounds uninspired on paper, is actually bursting with flavors and is the perfect happy ending to a night out in this lively area. My personal favorite here is the chili mac, which boasts a spicy italian sausage and a zesty chili sauce that's still easy on the stomache after you've had one too many PBR's. Oh yeah, they an above average selection of cheap beer as well. Almost forgot that not-so-minor detail.\\n\\nThe crowd here is always colorful and upbeat, but rarely obnoxious and boisterous in a \\"We never come to the Short North so let's act like unhinged yokels\\" kind of way. The smaller back room area provides the perfect atmosphere for the rowdier patrons of Surly Girl to dance and act like idiots when the people in the front that are zeroed in on their food aren't having it. So if you're looking for a saloon atmosphere that's just as well suited for dinner with friends as it is a place to drink off the dinner friends, Surly Girl is right for you."},{"name":"McGrath's Fish House","address":"12501 SE Second Cir","city":"Vancouver","stars":"2.5","text":"Food was wonderful.
