I don't often hear about the prevalence of depression in other artistic media, the depressed painter or sculptor or dancer isn't a trope. That may be that unlike other artists writers can't keep their traps shut: it is, of course, how they go about their craft, the formation of words. Similarly, there is a Godwinesque law that the longer a writer actively writes the probability of her writing about the act of writing -- whether as nonfiction or fiction, poetry or any other form -- approaches one. It's certainly so that artists in other media talk about their craft, but rarely do they implement their craft to depict their craft. Even Escher is just representing his craft, adequately outlining the impossibility.\\n\\nAnd who is most victim to accusations of such autological scratchings? Rare is the interpretation that a great painting is \\"about painting,\\" but it is very often the case that an otherwise innocuous piece of writing will be interpretted as being about the act itself. So it's folly to avoid this genre as a writer, as I have attempted. And so I here engage it, at least on my own terms. Major depressive episodes permanently loom on my dysthemic horizon, so why not subject myself to the narcissism of autological writing, embrace my nature and my chosen art? \\n\\nOf course, it comes and goes; though my general mood has been sinking for some months I haven't had a major episode for some time. Acute, brief pangs can be alleviated by addressing a chemical imbalance: so often it's the case when I speak to my similarly severely depressed friend (she too a writer, though often far too depressed to produce) \\"when did you last eat?\\" is a common introductory refrain, alongside when it was we last went outside and how hydrated we are. Caffeine is also sometimes a palliative and it's with these twined goals in mind that I enter the Clover brick and mortar on Main Street.\\n\\nThe coffee here is excellent. The rosemary fries the things of leged and indulgent enough to make me feel I have some handle on my own agency, even if just for a moment. The mood here too is also ebullient and I admit that it's difficult to feel depressed when surrounded by such positivity and good music, R&B and Motown lately. The staff is friendly and they make a show of endeavoring to remember my name, such is the frequency that I come here and, truly, the effort is more than enough. For however long I'm here as I my slow-drawn coffee cools and I munch on my mountain of fresh fries, I'm not depressed. I'm not happy either; I'm not anything. That's enough, in the middle of the day taking a break from a job that consistently causes me despair. And it's cheap enough for me to come back time and again."},{"name":"No Mas!

The bathroom was simple but adequate and included your own coffee pot.

The potato salad tasted just like how mom makes it (good thing :), and the mac and cheese, though cover with crumbled BBQ potato chips, lacked something. A little dry.

The feel of this place is anything but comfortable or leisurely.  From the loud contemporary grind of music to the uninviting decor and furnishings (bare plywood and rope being the primary materials - not a quiet zen-like minimalism but more like a 6th grade art project with raw materials), this place was definitely not a soft landing after a long day, or a cozy place to huddle into conversation with a friend.  There is the feeling that one is to keep moving...get in, eat fast, get out.

I added an order of Gyoza to the mix after reading some reviews that suggested it was not to be missed along with a beer to wash it down.   \\nIn keeping with the quick pace, the food arrived within five minutes of taking my seat at the bar (another recommendation by the staff for individual diners).  \\nMy long anticipated first spoonful of the Tonkotsu broth was not pleasant.  It had the flavor of pork grease that had been diluted with water.  I decided I should include some of the thin noodles and egg into the mix to see if that would provide a better blend of flavors but the pork grease flavor was just overwhelming.   I moved on to the Gyoza hoping it would redeem my quickly diminishing enthusiasm.  These dumplings were also drenched in the pork grease flavoring and so it didn't matter much what they were stuffed with...it couldn't be distinguished from the grease flavor.      \\nPerhaps that's why things move so fast....there is nothing to savor or linger over. Instead I felt a bit bludgeoned by the whole experience -  the food, like the decor and ambiance, is unadorned, bland, and lacking in flavor & good taste.  \\nI'm always a little baffled when my experience is so different than the majority, but this review is for those that share the disappointment.

All of the broths are made from pork bones, which is supposedly traditional.  There's 1 veggy item, the curry bowl, which is a tasty bowl of rice with curry, and an excellent daikon side salad, but that is it.  \\n\\n2) All of the Ramen dishes are rich, buttery, and packed with flavor.  If you don't like rich and fatty, go elsewhere.\\n\\nThankfully I love rich and am not plagued by a vegetarian diet, and man was this place awesome!  I don't really know much about traditional Ramen, but they have a variety of broths with countless options to customize.  You can add one of 6 or 7 toppings, double up on everything from the pork belly or egg to the actual ramen noodles.  There are also a variety of \\"bombs\\", which add even more flavor to your broth. I tried the corn bomb, which was basically a shot of corn in cold seasoned butter that you melt into your bowl.  \\n\\nI tried the #1, which had pork belly and egg, and added to it bamboo and the corn bomb.  it was awesome but the broth itself is already super buttery, and with the added fat from the pork belly you really don't need the bomb.  I could have gone with double the egg (another $.50-$1.00, i forget) as the egg is deliciously flavorful and the texture of the soft-boiled yolk was excellent in the broth.  \\n\\nAs other reviews have mentioned, don't sweat the line. it moves fast and gives you time to navigate the plethora of choices before you.  Also, MAKE SURE TO BRING TOGO CONTAINERS FOR YOUR BROTH, as they don't make them available.\\n\\nI was particularly fond of the hands-on and welcoming service we received from every staff person we encountered.  They really hit it out of the park and made us feel welcome and appreciated.  \\n\\nI'm very happy about Ramen Tatsu-Ya and will definitely will be back....I really hope they get their veggie act in order as it's a big hole in their offering, but man is the experience otherwise worth it!"},{"name":"BB Pocha","address":"1500 Robson Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"Tasty food and super spicy unless you're careful.

I could not point my finger on it until my friend said was it the filler?   I said yea!   Next time you chomp down on their burger, look at the patty.  It's very uniform, almost like the beef was ground into a blender, put into a tub and squished onto a forming press and then pressed perfectly round and uniform at 7 oz. burger patty.  And it didn't taste...right?  Or perhaps I've been spoiled by other burger places.  I'm not sure, but it bothered me enough to write about the Burger patty.  I've never had a beef patty that tasted so...sterile?  I'm not going to say bland, because there were some spices in the patty, but it didn't taste like beef.   I really wanted to give this place more stars.  I loved the service, it was great, and the 50's theme was what drew me in.   The pricing was a little high, but wasn't terrible.  But as the two stars state, Meh, I've experienced better.   It was kinda weird.  I thought to myself, this is kinda like being charged overpriced items by someone you really really like.  You know you're being ripped off, but the niceness and the fact that they try to give you good service sorta makes you not want to say anything bad about it but hide your embarrassment and just avoid doing business again with them.  I still having mixed feelings on if I'd go back.  But who knows, it wasn't so bad that I wouldn't go back a second time.

Good for them that they've experienced such wild notoriety and success, but I think they've done it with smoke and mirrors; artificially injecting scarcity in their product by cooking way less than they know they should. If they cooked more and stayed open longer they might sell even more, but if they did, there wouldn't be a line out the door everyday to get passers by to think \\"wow, look at that line!

I went with the Taste Explosion Roll to try out their sushi/burger fusion, and I was both confused but interested the resultant flavor. It was somewhere between a greasy, homey ground beef/pesto mixture and an elegant bed of rice that was trying too hard. The flavors didn't taste woven together but more stacked on top of each other. My boyfriend's high expectations of \\"The Cowfish Has Officially Left the Building\\" Burger were deflated when the promise of peanut butter, fried bananas, bacon, and a burger combined into an explosion of flavor turned out to taste generic and surprisingly bland. Again, the dish felt like stacked, not woven flavors. He wished the peanut butter addition had been converted into a more complex peanut-based sauce to increase the cohesion of the burger.  The fashionable ambience and my association with sushi as more of a luxury meal built my anticipation to dine on what was simply less-than-satisfying park food. \\n\\nBUT THE MILKSHAKES.

We had a group of 10 in the restaurant tonight, 6 of us eating, 4 others just drinking. Only one diner had anything positive to say about their meal (the plain fettucini alfredo) How is it that blackened chicken alfredo tastes like buffalo wing sauce? This dish was passed around the table with everyone in agreement that not only did it taste like shit that what kind of alfredo was red?! SERIOUSLY? This was a sad performance on an extremely easy dish to make. On a side note to that, why is it that one dish of alfredo was white sauce while the other was red? This dish was even sent back to the kitchen and brought back out to say that this is how it was supposed to be prepared. All the rest of the dishes on the table were extremely over salted. \\n\\nLastly, the service (Jess? Jessica?) was less than satisfactory. For one, she messed up multiple drink orders, including over charging one diner by two whiskey drinks when he only ordered one and then didn't fix the bill; he ended up paying for the drinks out of pure frustration.

There are daily fry, soup, and shake specials which make eating here exciting every time.\\n\\nThe wedge salad was ridiculously awesome.

We tried the following things:\\n\\nchicken liver appetizer (I know, but trust me on this)\\nbread basket for the table (on the house)\\nchicken and waffles\\negg-white frittata\\n\\n\\n---------\\n\\nChicken Liver Appetizers: I love liver.  I love pate, I love foie.  It was a tough decision between the fried green tomatoes, another southern staple I adore, but this just looked really good.  Chunks of seared chicken liver topped two pieces of sweet brioche which was placed on creamed corn puree.  Corn puree!  This was then drizzled with the sauce used to cook the chicken livers I believe.\\n\\nPROS\\n-large for an appetizer, definitely for the table unless you plan on sharing an entree\\n-amazing flavors: the sweetness of the brioche went well with chicken liver and an even sweeter touch with the corn puree.\\n-chicken livers were cooked well: it's really easy to overcook liver, and then it comes out hard and chewy.\\n\\nCONS\\n-certain parts of the brioche slices became somewhat soggy because it was sitting on the corn puree.  It might be good to put it on the top or on the side perhaps?\\n\\n--------\\n\\nBread Basket: two cornbread muffins and two biscuits were served with butter and jam at the table.\\n\\nPROS\\n-fills you up if you are starving, which we were\\n-came out nice and warm.\\n-the cornbread was super fluffy.\\n-I like this form of \\"southern hospitality\\" because it's a little something extra but it shows generosity on behalf of the establishment.\\n\\nCONS\\n-cornbread could have used some sort of salt component like jalape√±os or bacon bits.  It was a tad bit on the sweet side for me.\\n-biscuits could have been fluffier.\\n\\n--------\\n\\n\\nChicken and Waffles: two big breasts of chicken with about four pieces of waffle.  I had heard good things about the waffles here so I was really excited to try it.  The raves were as good as their word.\\n\\nPROS\\n-generous portions: the chicken pieces weren't that small.\\n-waffles were the fluffiest and softest that I've had: slightly sweet, they went really well with the chicken\\n-chicken was nicely breaded, not super crunchy topping which is fine because I wanted chicken and waffles, not fried chicken and waffles.\\n\\nCONS\\n-that's it.  just chicken and waffles.  HAHAHAHA.  It'd be nice to get some kind of pickle or vegetable garnish.  I mean, it was great but the plate just looked so \\"lonely\\" and \\"barren\\".  Then again, it may be right up the alley for a dude.\\n-salty.  The chicken was mad salty.\\n\\n--------\\n\\nEgg White Frittata: this had some amazing mushrooms, tomato, and goat cheese.  For extra healthiness, there are kale bits!\\n\\nPROS\\n-ridiculously tasty: the mushrooms were marinated ahead of time I believe, in some kind of vinegar based sauce.  It went well with the tomato and goat cheese which were also in themselves, slightly acidic.\\n-eggs were nice and fluffy.\\n\\nCONS\\n-maybe more cheese of a different kind.\\n\\n--------\\n\\nCheese Grits: my sister ordered these as a side to her egg white frittata.  I was actually pretty curious as I've had cheese grits at Egg Harbor and love them.\\n\\nPROS\\n-very cheesy: mad props for not being stingy with the dairy product\\n-good quantity: same amount as Egg Harbor, more grits than Highland Bakery.\\n\\nCONS\\n-slightly on the dry end.

It may probably be the best brunch that I've had in Atlanta.  Until I find something better, this is the first five-star brunch establishment that I've written about in awhile.

There were two line cooks and two waitresses (who seemed more intent on gossiping to each other behind their order slip pads).

Two of the carts are now closed so if you're looking for Fomo chicken or the Taco place, you're out of luck. We love Koi Fusion but frankly we can get that at many other locations so we wanted to try something different. That left the burger place and the Sushi joint. Maybe I'm cheap but when I took a look at the prices for the burgers, I thought $11 for a burger with no fries was excessive so we ate at the Sushi joint.

I was pleasantly surprised by their ability to accommodate us, given how packed the place already was at 6:30pm.  If you get there early, parking isn't a problem; we parked on the street, just 20 feet from the door.  Paid parking only goes through 10:00pm, so if you stay late, it's OK.  I think we paid $6.50 to the meter for around five hours.  In case you don't know, the Pint & Plate is in the Biltmore complex, next to Halo.\\n\\nThe servers might look a little scary, but that's just part of their charm...like going to Eats or Fellini's on Ponce.  The service was fantastic, especially since we were all over the place...they even moved our tab outside when we went to sit by the firepit so we didn't have to close out.  The patio, BTW, is huge.\\n\\nThe food was really good; I can personally vouch for the fried mushrooms with roasted garlic sauce and the French Dip sandwich.  The shrooms are done in rice flour, which makes them extra crispy...really a nice appetizer.  The sandwich came with hand-cut french fries that were dirty in a good way; the carmeized onions and swiss cheese all sorta melted together in the perfect-sized meal.  I think I was finished in less than 10 minutes.  I also tried the pimento cheese sandwich (with a fried green tomoato) and the side salad.  I'm not a particular fan of pimento cheese, but it was really tasty.  I tried a couple of the root vegetable chips that came with the edamame hummus and can't complain about them, either.\\n\\nThe beer selection was solid, but this is not a Taco Mac.  The best part about their tap list is that the house \\"Cypress draft\\" is actually Sweetwater IPA, and for only $3.00/pint.  I had about eight.\\n\\nAll said & done, we spent $116 including tip for dinner and drinks for two, so it ain't cheap.  But, then again, nothing in midtown is, huh?

It looks quite similar to the old restaurant (Franklin), and we had strange plants hanging off the wall in front of our booth which didn't seem to work.  The menu looked good and we were especially happy with our appetizers.  The watermelon/heirloom tomato salad was excellent, the tacos were also good as was the tamago.  We tried 4-5 appetizers and liked them all pretty much.  Good flavors.  Not cheap, but decent portions and good quality so it felt worth it.  We were less impressed with our main courses (the veggie burger, the scallops and the chicken were all good, but not great or special.  The burger was mushy and seemed to fall apart as we tried to eat it.  I think the scallops many have worked better if they were bigger or more (just 4 small scallops) and if the corn was worm and not cold.  The flounder was by far the best, with nice flavors and portions, an excellent dish.  The chocolate bread pudding was also excellent.  I ordered a mojito and the bartender clearly didn't know how to make one.  It was basic and weak, with no muddled mint, just a stick of mint sticking out of the glass.

A steal!) and the hot seafood salad (12.50...also a great deal for the amount of seafood and large portion). \\n\\nThe halibut cakes were our favorites - it came with 2, creamy mashed potatoes (needed little more seasoning) and roasted veggies. I normally don't like tartAr sauce, but theirs is delicious and paired well with the halibut cakes. \\n\\nThe seafood salad was huge portion -it came with salmon, bay shrimp, and rockfish. I would have preferred a different dressing (maybe like a creamy dill or green goddess) but it was still good. The salmon and shrimp were great, but we found the rockfish excessively fishy - it needed lemon or some sort of acidic marinade/dressing to cut through that fishy flavor. \\n\\nAll in all, I'd definitely recommend giving this place a go.

Of course many people recommended Vortex and I have to admit that I was really interested in going there after seeing it a number of travel shows and seeing the crazy awesome food.  However, after reading their \\"smoking policy\\"  on their website and referring to smoking bans as \\"nanny state\\" activity, I had to look elsewhere. \\n\\nFortunately many recommendations were for Cypress Street Pint and Plate.  We headed down there, easily found some metered parking (ok, so it was a weeknight), and strolled on up.  An well bless his heart, the bouncer carded this over 30's girl and I was stereotypically pleased.   The patio was full and LOUD (read: full of drunk college kids), so we opted to eat inside. The decor is modern industrial I would say with a splash of sports bar.\\n\\nI was trying to be good, so I ordered a thai salad which was pretty good, but I am kinda wishing I had been bad and ordered the sublime doughnut burger.  Fortunately my fiancee ordered their famous sublime burger (bacon cheeseburger with doughnut buns) and I forced him to share it with me.  Yes, this is America, home of fatass food like a bacon cheeseburger between two doughnuts, and it tastes so good!\\n\\nThe doughnuts are not that sweet so it tastes more like a light fluffy fry bread with a hamburger in between them.  \\n\\nWe also got some meatball sliders and some bbq eggrolls.  I loved the sliders, but the eggrolls I just couldn't get into.  I'm not a huge fan of collards so that's really why I didn't love them.  I'm sure they are great for those that do however.  \\n\\nNext time I'm in ATL, I wouldn't hesitate to come back to Pint and Plate."},{"name":"Punjab Cafe","address":"653 Southern Artery","city":"Quincy","stars":"4.5","text":"The chicken tikka masala is amazing.

All items are always hot and in good sized portions upon arrival. This place is one of my few Chinese delivery places I will use in the Brookhaven area due to their Wonton soup - its legit some of the tastiest amongst delivery places in this area! They still use a chicken broth based soup versus a beef base, which makes a huge difference - you never really think about how important the broth choice is until you end up with a cloudy bowl of brown broth and broken wonton noodles on a night when wonton soup is all but the only thing on your mind! With that being said, I have found two places in my delivery zone that treats my wonton soup right, so I treat them right...and one of them happens to be this place!\\n\\nPrice point is around the same as all the other places in the area, but their delivery minimum is only $10 compared to some of the other places that boast a $20 minimum.

Be prepared to wait in line 4-5 hours on a typical day. When he is sold out, that's it.  Is the wait worth it? You will have to judge - for me yes. I had taken a Foodways Texas  Brisket Camp at Texas A&M earlier in the year; Aaron Franklin was a keynote speaker.  I just had to see for myself the techniques he used to make consistently great BBQ.  I certainly got my money and time's worth from my Franklin BBQ day.   His brisket with the dark wonderful bark, smoke ring, is cut to order, served hot, moist, tender. The complex flavors are heavenly reminders of the value of low and slow smoking done perfectly.

I have never had the pleasure of enjoying a real deep dish Chicago pizza at an actual brick & mortar location. I started with an Italian Margarita( Reposado Tequila topped with Disaronno) crisp sweet and refreshing! ,  and a Caesar salad. Lauren my mixmaster presented the expertly crafted cocktail, was pleasant and efficient, helped me chose a pizza. At this point , sadly, the story goes downhill. The salad arrived , looked good , but had ZERO dressing, on further examination, it was swimming in 1/4 \\" of water from God knows where. Ordered dressing, poured off water onto a spare plate( which was immediately bussed off the table for me) added dressing, salad was tasty , but Parmesan shavings were over 1-8 \\" thick, kind of like thick toenail pieces, but overall, salad tasted ok. Pizza came out , looked simple but impressive, server decanted one slice into dinner plate . Here we go again, over 1/8\\" of fluids (not sauce) under pizza on plate. Dug in, no outstanding flavors, crust under toppings was raw, had to actually spit it out, edge crust was acceptable, but really flavor -wise it was flaky cardboard . The bottom line, come here for a great mixed drink, but for now, I do so hate to say this Digiorno might be a better investment."},{"name":"Franklin Barbecue","address":"900 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I had the 2 meat plate with brisket & sausage. It was ALL juicy and flavorful, and the sausage was awesome. They were also very generous with the meat  - it was a cornicopia of meat! There was no need for sauce, but having heard so much about the espresso sauce I had to try it. It was just the way I like BBQ sauce - more tangy than sweet, with a rich deep flavor. Now I'm confused - the meat doesn't need sauce, but the sauce is so good I want to eat it! Maybe I should just drink the sauce. The coleslaw was also great. The potato salad was meh - but I feel that way about all potato salad. I waited for 45 minutes on a Wednesday and they ran out shortly after I got my plate. It was worth it. I can't wait to go back and try the ribs. Minus one star for the wait time and risk of them running out of food."},{"name":"Franklin Barbecue","address":"900 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"My wife and I are here on vacation visiting her brother and we already looked on Yelp for some good BBQ, this place stood out.\\n\\nIt's reviews we're really good, and the hype is no joke, it's for real.\\n\\nWhen I read that if your willing to wait 3 to 6 hours for BBQ, I thought - it's going to be worth it - because who in their right mind would wait that long for so so  BBQ, I was sold.\\n\\nWe got there by 8:30am, there were six people in line when we arrived, not bad, and for the wait we So. Cal Foodies came prepared, we brought chairs, hats, water & sun block.\\n\\nThey come out to take a meat count (you buy it by the pound), another fella selling water and sodas, and a guy across the street renting chairs and umbrellas. (it's serious man!)\\n\\nBy a quarter to eleven we took our chairs back to the car and waited eagerly. Doors opened, it was cool inside (awwww!), we placed our order and were offered a sample of the brisket... OMG soon as it hit my mouth I knew it was going to be a good day!\\n\\nIt's served to you on brown paper (just like they show on all those foodie channels)\\n\\n1. Let me be honest and say that I've only had BBQ California, from Norther to Southern and also our previous visit to Austin, and they were all good. I don't know who rated Franklin the Best BBQ in the Nation but all I'm gonna say is that they were spot on! My quest is over... Period!\\n\\n2. I really have a hard time putting into words how good this BBQ was, it was so good, you just have to try it yourself if you have the opportunity.\\n\\n3. If I could give them a 10 Star rating I would at the drop of a hat, it's THAT GOOD!\\n\\nEvery piece of meat my fingers touched literally fell apart as soon as I picked it up, it was beyond tender, it was the perfection of tender, no dried out spots at all!\\n\\nSo first I try the Pork Rib, like I said I picked it up and the meat was so juicy and tender that it bent like a wet noodle and split apart like \\"Buttah\\".\\n\\nAs soon as it hit my mouth it melted! OMG it has so much smokey flavor I could have cried!\\n\\nMy mouth couldn't believe what it was tasting. I looked at my wife and all I said was \\"I'm ruined\\" I must have repeated it a few times because she just laughed. :-)\\n\\nThe second piece of rib in my hand was so juicy, I didn't want any of the juice to escape so I used a slice of white (wonder?) bread to eat it like a sandwich. I know this may be taboo for some, but this is the way it's eaten in many parts of the south I'm sure? they serve it with the bread!\\n\\nNo loss of flavor with the bread (in my opinion), it had to much and it was all over my fingers. :-)\\n\\nOk here comes the pulled pork, it was so tender I cut it with a plastic fork, it shredded easy! It had a nice peppered flavor to it, wow good!\\n\\nI put it on the bread and loved every bite! Again smokiness that was beyond description, it almost tasted to good to be true.\\n\\nMy last piece was the Brisket... When my wife pealed away the fat from the slice, it came off with ease, no knife needed to cut it of, just a clean peal!\\n\\nSo I went to pick up my slice and it just fell apart at my touch. I couldn't believe how tender it was.\\n\\nWhen it hit may mouth I knew this was the real thing, authentic and amazing flavor!\\n\\nIt was like I was eating the actual piece of smoked soggy wood used for the smoke flavor. The flavor was that true to taste and beyond!\\nI really couldn't believe I had just the best BBQ, it's unreal.\\n\\nI say this with all sincerity, comparing Franklin BBQ to anything I have ever had before is like comparing liver to steak, it's just not in the same league.  \\n\\nWhat can I say... I really wasn't sure if waiting in line for 3-4 hours was going to be worth it, but man I see why people do it, it really is worth the wait, no disappointments.\\n\\nIf you live in Austin or in the surrounding area you need to do this once, and if you are visiting from out of state and you have some time, it's a must try!\\n\\nI might be wrong to some, but it was more than worth it for us!\\n\\nTC"},{"name":"Barrel & Boar Creekside","address":"121 Mill St","city":"Gahanna","stars":"4","text":"We had a very nice dinner.

Please order from the dark haired, ray ban eye glasses bartender, he's a tad bit more experienced than the others and ALOT nicer. This must be the starting point for servers and bartenders because training is definitely in order. Pricewise, I just feel like every drink should be 1.50 cheaper than it is... Except for the Zombie.

The lobster cocktail has been on the menu at Aria for quite some time and is considered \\"emblematic\\" of their style, but I have to say I was terribly underwhelmed.  My date ordered the potato and goat cheese raviolis that were infinitely more memorable, and he was quite happy with his trout.  Next time, I'd be tempted to come and do a tasting menu ($56) to get more of their flavors, but I was happy with the filet mignon I ordered.  The steak was a bit tougher than I expected for a filet cut, but the brussels sprouts that accompanied it were covered in some creamy sauce that transformed them into little green pieces of magic.\\n\\nAchilles heel: L-O-U-D.  It is so loud inside Aria that you can barely hear the person across from you.  Throughout our dining experience, my partner could hardly hear me.  I'm fairly certain that the party seated next to me only opened their mouths to order and to eat.  It may be quieter earlier in the evening, or during a weekday, but I don't think I will be returning to find out.\\n\\nAphrodite factor: Lots of couples on dates here, although I have to admit it was a terrible \\"date\\" for me.  It's impossible to have a \\"date\\" if you cannot hear your companion (although I'm guessing there are plenty of dudes who are down with NOT hearing what their date has to say - you can talk about football!

She was a really interesting person so it wasn't at all intrusive. \\n\\nWE WILL RETURN!  :)  \\nI didn't do a 5 star because it simply isn't my kind of food, but the drinks and the staff make it a really awesome place to kill some time.  I'm really interested in trying some of their many, many milkshake recipes.

As a matter of fact, we felt as though we had a new \\"bestie\\", the back and forth banter was great.  Super nice people.  I ordered another \\"Valley Of The Dolls\\" and it was just as fantastic as I remembered.  The tots were fresh and delicious (I'm not a meat eater) and the grilled cheese was 2nd only to my Nanna's.  And yes:  they cut it diagonally the way a sandwich should be cut!  \\nFun place, decent food (excellent food if you like large meat dishes) and a super cool staff.

They opened at 11:00 and I still stood in line for another 25 minutes to get served.  It was worth every minute and more.  The brisket is moist and flavorful and the ribs may be the best I have ever had. The sauces are interesting but not necessary and the sides are pretty average but none of that matters.  Just get some meat and eat!  Customer service was fantastic and waiting in line is actually kind of cool because you will most likely meet someone who is into food and of course a conversation will ensue.  They are moving into their new store on 11th st. in a bout two weeks.  I hope that doesn't change anything besides location.

The sides of cole slaw and rice and beans were fine and the corn bread was awesome.  My friend ordered a two meat combo - pulled pork and fried catfish.  I have to say, the fried catfish stole the show.  I would say that it was better than the catfish I had in Memphis.\\n\\nThe service was fine and overall, the bbq was decent.

Unfortunately, our dining experience tonight got off on the wrong foot from the start.  \\n\\nEven though we had a reservation and arrived on time, we were asked to wait in the bar area for our table to be prepared.  We were immediately asked what we wanted to drink, rather than IF we wanted something to drink.  This was a bit off-putting and seemed a bit like a ploy to jack up the bill by forcing us to wait for our table and order overpriced drinks. \\n\\nWhen we were finally seated after 15 minutes of waiting, we were \\"greeted\\" by possibly the least friendly server in Atlanta -- a gentleman named Kim.  Kim is not one for small talk, or any talk for that matter.  In fact, he only said about 3 things to us during our meal: \\"Right there\\", \\"You finished?\\", and \\"You ready for the check?\\"  Seriously, that was it.  As a general rule of thumb, if you want to be considered a quality dining establishment, you should hire personnel to reflect the quality you would like your customers to perceive.  Kim should NOT be interacting with customers since he's clearly not a people person.\\n\\nAs for the food, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't that good.  For the prices they're charging, I would have expected it to be better than average.  I will say that the bartender, as well as the valet, were both very friendly.  Perhaps they should bring the valet inside and have Kim park cars instead.

I figured, since I'd already gotten fish and chips, I might as well go all the way down the rabbit hole. The donuts were like donut holes, but heavier.

The fish and chips was $18, the Topo Chico was $5 (I would have liked to have a warning when ordering the bottle--I assumed it was for 1, and just a normal bottle of Topo, not a 750ml bottle), and dessert was $6.

Bravo.\\nMilestone's cuisine has a Southern/Cajun bent. The appetizers are pricey, but the rest of the menu is reasonably priced for the amount and quality of the dishes. There are plenty of pescetarian options - shrimp and grits, crab cakes, salmon, perch sandwich, seared tuna salad. True vegetarians will be limited in their options (although surely they can be requested). I ordered the roasted cauliflower, which was an entire head of cauliflower, nicely browned, with an Asian slaw, brown rice and a lovely curry sauce. The sauce was spicy enough to add the necessary flavor profile to both the rice and vegetables. Impressive presentation and execution.

My review will be brief, as I had already been drinking around the world before both of my two trips there (I like to start in the UK and work counter clockwise, so sue me) and my memory isn't exactly perfect. The first time was doing the Food & Wine festival and they were doing the VIP tequila tasting (I can't remember if they do this all the time or just for F&W). I'm not a fan of tequila, in fact, I pretty much hate it, straight anyway. I wasn't thrilled when we had a multitude of shots in front of us, but the hostess explained perfectly how to take them so that we didn't feel any burn. Also included was a mezcal shot, which tasted like a burnt tire, but was certainly worth it for the experience. The second time, we just ordered menu margaritas and they were among the best I've ever had. Maybe it was their synergy with the margaritas, maybe it was just Disney magic, but even the tortilla chips seemed much better than the average.

I give you credit, Portland has some damn hipster coffee, with their hipster barista and sh*t.. Took instagram photos... we didn't even need a filter because it was that hipster. \\n\\nAfter an hr and half wait, we were promptly seated. We knew what we wanted. The chicken. We had a party of four girls, We ordered 2 orders of the Chicken and Waffles, 1 Order of (some type of) Eggs Benedict, and 1 order of the Lemon Ricotta Fritters to share. We should have ordered 1 plate of the chicken and waffles since the portions are huge. \\n\\nChicken and Waffles: I did not care much for the waffles, but damn that chicken was good. Crispy on the outside, but moist as heck. Juicy, fresh, white meat. The syrup that came along was the perfect consistency, gave it a sweet touch.\\n\\nI did not care for the benedict, benedict dishes always come off a little heavy to me. But the roasted potatoes that came as a side dish was delicious. You can't fail at making potatoes. \\n\\nThe lemon fritters was a great item to share as a snack with the table, since there were about 7-8 pieces with a nice tart dipping sauce. \\n\\nPrices are extremely affordable, with tip and a drinks, we ended up at ~20 per person. I would definitely come back for the chicken. Just the chicken, they can toss the waffle... along the with that attitude/hate for Californians!"},{"name":"Lily's Sandwich","address":"10901 N Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"This IS as good as it gets for a sandwich shop.

YOU WILL NOT WAIT LESS THAN 30 MINUTES FOR SLICE OF PIZZA AT THIS PLACE. The service is soooooooooooo slowwwwww and they are always pretty much empty which makes no sense.This is my 5th time coming to edgewood pizza and i have never waited less than 30 minutes. it took them over 40 minutes to make 1 slice of pizza and a calzone. When we received the food, thats when the disappointment came. The calzone we received wasn't a calzone. It was 5 pounds of dough with a sprinkling of meat and cheese and NONE of the extra topics that we paid for!!! Then came the idiotic waiter. I ask the guy to cut my pizza (king slice) into 3 slices which would indicate him only making 2 cuts in the darn thing. He made 6 slices out of one king slice. I saw him hacking away at my pizza and already knew smh. So i sent it back for a new one since it was not edible in my opinion. I also watched the idiotic waiter put his hands all over my pizza while trying to use it for leverage while he was cooking. EWWWWWWWWWWW.\\n\\n My friend who ordered the calzone wanted to return the item or have it remade correctly. We called the owner over and showed him a picture of what a calzone looked like. He had given us a pretzel shaped piece of dough with VERY LITTLE TOPPINGS. It cost $13! Instead of taking the pointers and remaking the food, the owner proceeds to give us back ALL of our money (you actually gave us a dollar extra so thanks). Im thinking he's going to comp the king slice, but no he tells us that he won't serve us at all!!!!!

I will have to return and give them another try becasue the entrees just weren't spectacular like I had been led to believe by reveiws and the overzealous couple dining next to me who I feared was going to reach across their table and grab my lobster cocktail (some places just sit you way too close to the next table). \\n\\n What was great was the dessert; holy smokes, after inhaling  the nut cake and playing a spoon battle with my husband for the last piece, we seriously contemplated ordering another serving.

The first time was on my bday and the service food and drinks were ok.. Nothing to rave about.. Everything was pretty much overrated and over priced ..But fun for a one time experience.. The 2nd time I came it was for a friends gathering celebration.. The service was not that great.. The waiter rarely checked on us and food was once again okay..my friend slipped and fell that day from the employees mopping but there was not a wet mop sign anywhere near where we were sitting.. The employees were not apologetic .. They continued on with their day as if nothing happened.and we had to BEG for a manager or owner to acknowledge the issue and say sorry. My friend had to go to the emergency room from severe aches and pain..\\nThe 3rd time.. I popped in for a quick dessert with a group of friends and before we ordered we stood at the patio stand waiting for about 5 minutes for someone to greet my friends and provide customer service..but no one came to he rescue so we just headed indoors and ordered ice cream at the parlor and took our food to the nearest empty table..once we sat down.. The waitress told us that we were not allowed to sit at the table and enjoy our food unless we were dining in..that policy was not clear to us before we ordered our desserts.. Even though we just spent our dollars on their goods.. What a waste of time and lack of customer service .. I'm not much of a fan of this place and probably will not be coming back. Mind you there was not a wait of any kind and there were about 20 open tables not waiting to be filled.. After our ice cream was halfway melted we finally were seated in a back corner where no one came to check on us again to see if if we needed anything else because there was not a waiter assigned to that specific seating area..Strike 3 ..

My fears were confirmed when the chips and salsa brought to me were stale and lacking any kind of flavor whatsoever. Not quite ready to call it a night, I ordered a blended margarita and an order of beef nachos. These were my second and third mistakes, as the margarita was made with quite possibly the lowest-grade tequila I've ever had. \\n\\nThe nachos deserve a special paragraph, because I have previously believed that there are some things in world that are impossible to f**k up, such as, for instance, tea, fried eggs, and corn chips with cheese and salsa. Holy s**t did this place prove me wrong! When the nachos arrived, I actually had to do a double take to make sure I wasn't confused: the plate was covered corn chips, sure, but on top of them, instead of actual cheese, was about a can's worth of Tostito's queso dip. Underneath this swill was what can only be described as canned meat; adorning this turd pile were marinated sliced jalape√±o peppers. The only fresh ingredient about this crime against cooking were the tomatoes - small comfort, considering I never made it past the first few bites to actually confirm if they were fresh or not.\\n\\nIf this review seems unnecessarily harsh, consider this your public service announcement. The Allston-Brookline area has plenty of better Mexican places to eat, the two Sunset Cantinas and Camino Real being not the least noteworthy of them, and not even the profoundest of hungers should coerce you to go to Jalape√±o's over any of them.

I thought the fact that there's no menu wouldn't be a problem, but it really is.  The place is small, but super busy with only two waitresses - they could use another. We went on a busy Saturday night and not only is it extremely noisy in there, it's like watching disorganized chaos.  The waitresses are rushing about, yet don't seem to be getting anywhere.  Long waits in between sitting down, being greeted, getting water, ordering etc.  \\n\\nWhen we walked in, we were never greeted or acknowledged - not that they need to jump the minute we walk in, but the place is so tight that while we were standing in the doorway, we felt as if we were on top of the other diners and in the way.  Meanwhile there were three empty tables available, so I finally walked over to the waitress, told her we had a reservation, asked if we could be seated - she pointedly looked at the clock and stated that our reservation wasn't for another 5 minutes.  Ok, we were a bit early, but they totally ignored us standing there and again we felt as if we were in the way because of how the place is set up.  After being seated, we were left sitting for awhile, again with neither waitress seemingly concerned that we were there even though they walked by our table numerous times.  In fact, a couple who came in well after we did, ordered and got their appetizer before we were even spoken to. \\n\\nNow to the dinner.  Having been told when I called for the reservation, that they could \\"make anything\\", I went with a few ideas of what I might order.  I asked for a chicken dish and each time the waitress asked what I wanted on it, she would say they didn't have those ingredients or couldn't make that dish.  They had no spinach - really??  For a restaurant that can \\"make anything\\" I would think spinach would be a pretty basic ingredient to have on hand. Me - \\"Ok, so what do you have?\\"  Answer - \\"Well what do you want?\\".  And around and around it went - it's way too much work.  Finally she made a few suggestions, none of which I really wanted, but she seemed so frazzled and rushed that I felt like I was bothering her, so I just ordered one of the first things she suggested - chicken saltimmboca  - it wasn't anything special at all. It certainly didn't live up to all the hype, nor was it worth the wait.\\n\\nOur waitress seemed especially bothered and a bit grumpy every time she came to our table - the other waitress seemed cheerful and upbeat.  After we finally got our food, the others in my party enjoyed their meals, however they agreed that the overall experience of the place and the service was odd.  Anyway after a long ordeal and so-so service, we finally got the check - which took FOREVER. We had to ask the other waitress several times because ours actually left during our meal. When it finally arrived, it was just a total on a scrap of paper written by the second waitress.  Why this took so long, I do not know - again it was just a number on a piece of paper.  $109 for three meals and an appetizer - considering we had no alcohol (it's BYOB) - we thought this was high.  I asked if we could get an itemized bill, as we were not sure she even knew what we had - as I said, our waitress had left and this girl, for all we knew, had no idea what we had eaten.  Our waitress had never written anything down when we ordered.  Because it seemed  high, we thought perhaps it was wrong.  When I asked for an itemized bill, she seemed very annoyed - her response was an unfriendly and sharp \\"I can do that\\" - well then why didn't she just do it in the first place? It seems rude to hand us just a number on a piece of paper - I'd like to know what I'm paying for.\\n\\nOne other thing - two of us asked if they had cappucinno - the answer was yes, but that the machine was very touchy and she could only \\"try\\" because the machine didn't often work. Fine - when the third person said she would just have a regular coffee, she was told they do not serve American coffee.  So they only serve cappucino and espresso, but the machine doesn't often work?  You don't even have the option to just have a regular coffee - doesn't make sense.\\n\\nOverall, not a great experience - they need a menu and they need to expand.  I'll be going back to Cafe Lantana up the street next time I want a good meal and good service."},{"name":"Sforno Trattoria Romana","address":"1308 Pearl St","city":"Boulder","stars":"4","text":"Stopped in for dinner with my family as my sister wanted Italian food.

Time to catch up!\\nFirst visit:  Breakfast on a weekday.  We both had the shrimp and grits, and both elements were perfect!  They came with two eggs, and my sunnyside up eggs were also perfect.  I opted for the biscuit accompaniment, and ordered a side of gravy to go with it; the biscuit could be tad fluffier, but that is minor quibbling, and with the excellent gravy, it was a terrific meal with lots of leftovers.  We shared an order of the breakfast tots, which were a very interesting sweet and savory twist on the plain version.\\nSecond visit:  Early dinner on a Sunday.  Yes, there was a wait, but it seemed to go fast since there were only two of us waiting to be seated.  We both opted for the fried chicken dinner.  That dinner consists of a huge flattened breast and thigh, each battered and deep-fried, served with mashed potatoes and brown tasso ham gravy; I got the cole slaw instead of the greens.  I'm not a real fan of the flattened meat, but it was perfectly executed, with the ideal combo of crispy and juicy, so we'll leave my personal preferences aside.  The same goes for the gravy:  I'd prefer a cream gravy, but the tasso gravy was fine.  The cole slaw was very nice, with a very light vinegar-based dressing.  Lots of leftovers that came home with me!\\nThird visit:  We had a very short wait for a weekday lunch.  We each had the fried oyster po-boy, and agreed that the execution was perfect.  I don't know how many times I've had soggy oysters in po-boys, but these were crispy and abundant!  I asked our server about his favorite side, and he raved about the mac and cheese, so I went with that.  No, not the best version I've had, but adequate, and not enough to lose a point.\\nSpeaking of service:  Every single visit has been marked by exceptional service.  That includes not only the servers themselves, but also the host/hostess, and even the kitchen staff who are known to bring food to the tables themselves.  \\nI don't eat out \\"that\\" often, and when I do, I enjoy trying new-to-me places.

Time is precious to me and so having hoards of people have to carve out hours of their day just to eat is a little silly in my opinion. People choose to do it which is why they have a great business. I'm not saying that their brisket isn't the best ever. It really is delicious. I just don't see myself choosing to do it again. If I could make a reservation or whatever, of course I'd consider it.\\n\\nI will say that the service is great. They know how to take care of their customers. They sell beer while you're in line and update you on when you can expect to eat or if something sells out. The fatty brisket is melt in your mouth moist. It might give you a heart attack so practice some self control. Keep in mind that waiting in line for hours will likely cause you to over order.

Things I like about Masa: The decor. The attentive service. The food styling. The cornbread they brought to the table at the beginning of the meal.\\n\\nThings I didn't like so much about Masa: The food was just ok. We had two of those $5 carafes of sangria, which were pretty much watered down grape juice. My friend had the chorizo and shrimp quesadilla, which he said was amazing. I had the romaine salad, which supposedly came with a green chile dressing but really just tasted like over-done caesar dressing. For entrees, he had the adobo roasted chicken, which was tender and juicy but looked incredibly lonesome on his plate. I, on the other hand, ordered the steak which came with a side of chili-powder doused fries and a mini salad. The steak was perfectly cooked (medium), still red and moist. But -and my friend agreed- it tasted like it hadn't been marinated. A distinct lack of marinade. Now, I know North Americans are supposedly afraid of spice but would a little Tabasco or Cholula really hurt?\\n\\nDessert was good; he had the chocolate cake (which I stole a bite of ) and I had the flan, which was light and refreshing yet creamy.

It sounded awesome! And made me wonder why we couldn't do that here.\\n\\nWell I found something even better!\\n\\nI had walked past SoulFire numerous times, but always wrote it off thinking I didn't have enough time to stop and eat there.My roommates and I were craving meat and BBQ sauce and without any other plans for the evening we decided to finally give it a try. \\n\\nFrom the rich wood and deep red walls the atmosphere was spot on with my expectations, but I was surprised that there was no table service. Everyone order's their food and drinks at the counter and then speedily picks up their order further on down the line, after the soda machine and the condiments. The set up works so well for them, and this way you have the option to stay and eat or take out. If you want, there is a bar to sit at where you can be waited on and served drinks. But if you are looking to just grab dinner and a drink and not linger (which is what most people seemed to be doing) you can order a beer from the person taking your meal order and ringing you up. Its like classy, casual, fast food.\\n\\nWhen we first arrived it did not look too busy and the waitress behind the counter did not seem to mind us taking a few minutes to figure out how the restaurant worked. We all ordered the same thing, pulled pork sandwiches and mac and cheese, which she joked would confuse the kitchen. I was not even done getting my water when our order was up. The kitchen staff teased us for having the the same meal, I guess they are used to more complicated meals at SoulFire. The food was pretty good, exactly what I had wanted when I walked in. The sandwich hit the spot and the meat was smoked perfectly. I also loved the mac and cheese with a generous amount of crushed bbq potato chips on top. And the pickles! I don't usually like sweet bread and butter type pickles, but there were homemade and were a wonderful combination of vinegar and sugar. I even wanted to go order half pints of these sides to take home and enjoy later, but I resisted the urge!\\n\\nOne gripe I had was that I would have liked a better selection of sauces, especially since here you have to sauce your own meat. I ended up having to mix my own in order to get it just the way I like it. So on one hand that it good because you get the sauce the way you like, however it is not the same as having the meat mixed in with the sauce the way they do it at some places. If I were getting this to go (which I now know is very easy to do), I would prefer having the sauce already on there instead of having to get cups of my own.\\n\\nThat said I will definitely be back soon, its a faster alternative to a sit down restaurant in the area, and priced pretty reasonably. The staff was very friendly, the waitress even yelled to us to have a good evening over the building crowd as we left. The food is quick and excellent, and I can even grab a beer with my quick meal.

The potatoes with mushrooms and pork were just okay-none of us were crazy about them, plus they were sitting in a pool of grease. I love beets but not crazy about these.

We live very close and had always wanted to check it out.\\n\\nWe were seated and a friendly waitress came to our table. That's where things started taking a downturn. My fiance was able to order an app and her main. I then tried to order a main course and a beer. I was informed that unfortunately they were out of that main course (they have about 5 main courses and were out 1 - I wanted the \\"braised short ribs\\") and also that they were out of the beer I had ordered. \\n\\nI was pretty disappointed since I'd checked the menu in advance (online) and went in for that dish. Ok, 1 main course out of 5 is not available, happens. I ordered the next best thing  \\"bangers and mash\\" and was informed that they were also out of that.\\n\\nSo having ordered 2 main dishes, they had neither available and the beer I ordered was also unavailable. OK. I looked at the menu and just couldn't find anything else I wanted, I figured why force myself when I could just come back another night. So, we were pretty hungry but now decided to leave. The waitress was very nice and apologized asking that we try them again, which we were thinking of doing.\\n\\nI suggested that if they're out of something and people call ahead, they might want to have their hostess or whoever answers the phone mention it. Being out of your 2 most popular main courses is something worth noting. She agreed.\\n\\nWhat really turned me off and put it past trying again was the owner coming over. I am a business owner myself and believe that he should come over. However, when he did he just said 'hey sorry we're out of both the main dishes and the drink you're ordering (Saturday night at 8 PM here) but we caught some bad breaks etc'\\n\\nThat's it, no hey folks you called ahead just to make sure then came out to our restaurant to give us a try, here's $5 of drinks on the house or let us get your next check by 10% (let alone doing more which I think you should).

The baked beans were the weakest of the group, they have a strong molasses base, but not the best I've ever tasted. \\n\\nThe star is the meat, as you would hope in a BBQ joint.

Important things to note - do not go on a first date here it's entirely too loud and bustling. Do not come starving or exhausted. Be prepared to wait. Knowing these things and setting up time to experience this place is key. \\n\\nThe food was amazing. There is something for everyone. We tried different things since we were treating ourselves. The popcorn shrimp was not popcorn at all, sizeable and delicious. The white chocolate burger was actually way better than I thought it would be and they cooked it right. The French fries were heaven. Probably the best fries I've had in a long time. We got the hot goblet it was different alcohol with extremely hot pepper gummies. It's 40 bucks this isn't a cheap date lol but totallt worth it (I suggest sharing the goblet it's too much for one person and it will help the end of the dinner bill.) \\n\\nI took pics of every ice cream and milkshake i saw. The banana Nutella shake was so good I sucked it down instantly. Our server was friendly and helpful. Note- the servers are super busy. The events (bday, anniversary, wedding) that people celebrate are done up. The music gets put on blast and your dessert comes with a sparkler and everyone there gets involved. I want my bday here next !!!! \\n\\nThe food was good. The wait was long and the service was slow but knowing this coming in makes it well worth the wait.

I ordered a D√∂ner Plate with chicken and a chicken schnitzel with sp√§tzle. Sat there and look at the decor, really odd. They must have just kept the lighting fixtures from the last tenants. Nothing matched and it just comes off sterile and weird but that's not why I give them 2 stars. \\n\\n30 minutes later I got my food and took off home. It was still hot when I got home so happy to see that. Then we looked at what it was and it looked like fast food. The sp√§tzle was running and not fully cooked and didn't seem homemade. Their website says fresh ingredients so not sure why the sp√§tzle was mushy and the chicken schnitzel looked and tasted like it was a preformed premade patty..... I will say the best part of both of our meals was the pita bread that came with the D√∂ner Plate. The meat on the D√∂ner Plate was dry and not appetizing. Everything else we ate but felt more like we were just eating to fulfill our basic need of food and if we had something else in the house would have eaten that instead.\\n\\nI will not be going back.

First time I ordered Peking Ravioli, crab Rangoon and salt and pepper  Calamari. Crab Rangoon is great the ravioli was also good (I got the small, about 4 raviolis) the calamari was good though it was covered in a thick layer of spicy glaze. Which was good but overpowering, also this order arrived in about 30 min. My second order was beef with Szechuan sauce with porn fried rice and an order of juicy dumplings. The dumplings were so good and their dumpling sauce is very good. The pork fried rice was white rice with soy sauce and I didn't actually find any pork. The beef dish was really chewy beef with again the thick spicy glaze all over it which is a great flavor but just too over powering for my taste.

We went on a Friday evening so it was pretty packed. The atmosphere was very much a \\"sports bar and grill except way more trendy than usual\\" affair, and the bar was well stocked with good liquor and decent beer. It was packed when I went and the music was really loud, so unfortunately my companion and I had to practically shout at one another to be heard. I ordered a Bratwurst done \\"Razzle Dazzle\\" style (with cream cheese, grilled peppers, and onions) and a side order of onion rings. All in all, the meal was just okay. First and foremost, I was disappointed with the size of the brat. It was tiny and not very flavorful at all - it was certainly overwhelmed by the giant bun and pile of condiments. The peppers and onions were served raw instead of grilled, which was gross, and on top of that there were waaayyy too many onions in general... to the point where the Brat just tasted like raw onions until I finally took all of them off. The grilled peppers weren't really well-cooked, and their flavor was entirely lost amongst the onion mountains. The onion rings, however, were absolutely delicious- you could smell that they were fresh out of the fryer. Yummm! While I acknowledge that my meal was overall sub-par, I must take into account that I only paid around $6 for it. If Dirty Frank's  has a strong point, I think it must be their low prices. And the service was great- we were in and out of there in forty-five minutes.\\n\\nDirty Frank's: it's certainly got trendy cred, but from what I experienced the food isn't that great.

I finally got up went back to the host to say no one had come over. A younger server came over was nice but kind of rushed us while we were still eating giving us the check. Not asking do you need anything tried to ignore it thought maybe she was cut for her shift (I am a server) turns out not so. If we come in with my parents or my mother in law we have prompt fast service, as soon as we're sat a server comes over coffee pot in hand. But if the two of us go alone forget it not to mention we have had the same server multiple times.

And why does anyone think it's ok to butter only one side of a bagel and then smush them together?  Do you really think both sides are going to be buttered?  So after getting a half slanted bagel with the other half soaked in butter, I've decided the only way to get a bagel is to take back to my office and toast it there, but they can't even do that correctly.  90% of the time, they only give me enough butter for half my bagel, and as I said before, I don't want a bagel soaked in butter, just enough to cover both sides, but they can't even make that happen.

First, the other reviews were spot on when they said that the place was noisy, I could not hear my wife from across the table on a third day night. The food was good, the goat cheese raviolis and the short ribs great. The service was pretentious however, maybe it was just our waiter, but we couldn't help but get the feeling that he was disappointed we weren't spending more money. We still spent over $150 on drinks and a light meal so his attitude was not really appropriate. Look if you want to earn more money get s better job or be a better server but I digress. It seems as if this restaurant is stuck in the middle of an identity crises trying to balance buckhead sheek with classic elegance. The result, a entryway and cocktail area reminicent of a average strip club. Silver beads separate the front door from the dining area and the red fabric sinking seats round out the package. Maybe I'm a bit bitter here. I think I am. But I just expected more from a restaurant with such a good reputation but I promise a better meal with more accommodating service can be had at sotto sotto any day of the week. One last complaint, they have about 7 wines by the glass. 100s of bottles, but 7 by the glass. A restaurant should be all about the food, you pay for ingredients and then a premium for service. I just could help but feeling that I was helping pay the rent. It's a shame because I really think that the food could stand on its own but everything else here detracts from it.

I also had the heirloom tomato salad, which was one of the best (if not the best) tomato salads I've ever had.  We then got some of the famous, secret recipe cornbread, and it was as wonderful as we had heard - buttery, almost creamy, with a golden crust and a distinct bacon flavor.  For entrees, we couldn't decide between the catfish and the fried chicken, so we decided to each order one and share.  The catfish was moist and well-seasoned, and the spicy tomato gravy on top was delicious.  The fried chicken was excellent - juicy and crispy with a flavorful coating that had a hint of spice.  We ordered several sides - creamed potatoes, macaroni and cheese, field peas, and mushrooms.  The mac and cheese was some of the best I've ever had - creamy, very cheesy, and topped with crushed potato chips.  The creamed potatoes were very good as well.

I was blown away to find out that a genuine Japanese Ramen noodle shop was open in my own backyard! \\n\\nFirst off, let me preface my review... I have eaten REAL Ramen in several Ramen noodle shops in and around Osaka and Kyushu while visiting family in Japan. So my review is from a point of view that may be a bit skewed toward being kinda harsh, but only because I care and want Tatsu-ya to be a success!\\n\\nHere's my review...\\n\\nTatsu-Ya blew my socks off... but, just about nailed it instead of completely nailing it. \\n\\nHuh, wait... you say \\"just about nailed it\\"? \\n\\nYes, Let me explain... Their broth is exquisite. Rich and creamy from the pork marrow, with just the right amount of savory aroma to get your mouth watering. My first sip of broth from the Tonkotsu ramen instantly transported me back to Osaka. Mmmm, so lovely and silky. Then I noticed the noodles. Oh my heart sank. I was so sad to see thin white vermicelli style noodles instead of the fatter yellow kansui based noodles I've grown so fond of while in Japan. With dampened spirits I slurped my first piping mouthful of noodles. (\\"Sugoi!\\") The slightly different texture and noodle flavor actually complemented the broth nicely and my spirits began to raise. I ate every bit of my Ramen, (\\"ippai\\"). \\n\\nI'm hoping the thin noodles are only due to it being extremely hard sourcing fresh fat ramen noodles in the middle of Texas. I've shopped around locally and you really are only left with buying Chinese kansui based noodles which are very similar. So, I forgive you guys for using an easier noodle to source. It works and tastes great so it doesn't really matter. I love Tatsu-Ya's unique combination! You guys are sort of like Tokyo style with the thinner noodle.\\n\\nSo, why did I only give four stars instead of five. \\nTwo simple things...\\nFirstly, the music was just a tad bit to loud to carry on a conversation. \\nand...\\nSecondly, I really was looking forward to the staff yelling out \\"irasshaimase\\" when customers walk in the door.\\n\\nWe will be back again for more.

We did have a slight mishap to begin. I had called about 2 weeks in advance to make a reservation because of the size of our group. When we arrived, the gentleman couldn't find the reservation and there was some initial panic because someone else said they didn't take reservations for after 6pm. I said I had made it through Universal and the gentleman-who was wearing a Universal button- said, oh no wonder. But he radioed upstairs and a table was set for us on the balcony within 10 minutes. The kiddies amused themselves by making fish while we waited. The drinks were top notch and creative. We shared the togorashi shrimp, tuna nachos, fried pickles, and edamame as appetizers. The shrimp and the pickles were excellent. You can't mess up edamame but they could have used some salt. The nachos were ok. For the mains, reviews were mixed. The vegan loved her roll and the burger people were pleased. The pb&j roll bento box was a hit. The lobster and steak burgushi was deemed tasty but the lobster was overwhelmed by everything on it. I had the chefs special sashimi, some of which was very good and other parts so-so. I think I would stick to a roll or a burger, although the rolls were a bit too fancy for my taste.

All of their rolls had way too much rice. Four of us each ordered something different - burgers, sushi, and bento box. I was pretty disappointed with my bento box since more than half of the bento box was side dish not the main entree. It was quite odd the way they arranged their bento box. I ordered it thinking I will try a little bit of everything but I had a huge regret after seeing my friend's burger. In their bento box, they gave a loooooot of pickles. Not sure who eats that much pickles in a single bento box. \\n\\nOther than my weird bento box, my friends' burgers looked pretty good. One of them had a burger with jalapeno infused cream cheese and that looked very good. I definitely recommend to get burgers over sushi here. \\n\\nIt is definitely a little overpriced for what it is. Understandable given that it is inside a theme park property. But really, don't get the bento box or sushi."},{"name":"Domino's Pizza","address":"1931 E Oltorf St","city":"Austin","stars":"2","text":"Long story short!

This morning I woke up with a craving for waffles, which as my boyfriend knows is a very rare morning. I love the savory things. He suggested Milestone 229, since their brunch menu was just announced online last week, and I was on board as soon as he said it. Waffles? Maybe...chicken and waffles? Yes, please!\\n\\nWe arrived shortly after 10 a.m. (when brunch begins), and it was quiet. By the time we left at 11:30, the crowd picked up. Today was only their second week of the brunch menu, so be prepared for them to work out a few more kinks, but I have to say it was delicious. Like I expected, I picked the chicken and waffles as my dish. The chicken thighs were hot, crispy, and perfectly cooked. The waffles were fluffy with an excellent spicy honey butter and real maple syrup. On the side, the braised collard greens added just what I needed--some greens with the right amount of texture and flavor. This serving was huge, and for $12 I got a gigantic waffle (split into four quarters), two chicken thighs, and a generous helping of greens. Yum.\\n\\nMy boyfriend decided on the biscuits and gravy, which were also tasty. The gravy was nicely spiced, and the cheese biscuits were a nice twist on the usual. Add two over easy eggs and a three-potato (including sweet potato!) hash, and this was a filling and delicious meal. The only downside to this dish was the caramelized onions, which he felt didn't really add much to the dish and instead kind of overpowered it.\\n\\nI've been here once before for drinks and appetizers with friends, and I have to say that the Bavarian pretzel with multigrain butter was the perfect accompaniment to CBC Summer Teeth.\\n\\nAnyway, I hope you'll give Milestone 229 a shot. The ambience inside (and out) is classy, warm, and inviting. It would make a great date night, I think, because the food is really reasonably priced but with a nice variety and location. The service is good as well, though nothing particularly standout."},{"name":"903 Mills Market","address":"903 S Mills Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"I tried the Philly at 903 Mills Market today and was happily surprised at how fresh and delicious it was.

Cream cheese or butter cream icing. Nope nothing crazy there. Am I missing something? Yes I know about Michael Jackson still just chocolate cake with cream cheese frosting.

If they would make a chocolate peanutbutter cupcake that would be the bomb, lol but maybe we'll just stick with the classics that won't go out of style.\\nOk so my first experience was a little disappointing, but it was a few months ago and I think i was expecting too much from them at the time. expecting a gigantic selection of flavor combos, but one of the delivery drivers where i work would bring in cupcakes a couple of times so now i'm hooked. I really like the red velvet and the michael jackson.  those would be my favorite. I like the strawberry cream cheese icing on the sweetberry, but not so much the cake, I'll take the icing on the chocolate or vanilla cake though that would be nice. Is there a lemon cake cuz that sounds good right now. I might have to take a ride out there I'm getting a jones for cake now. Mmmmmm...... Oh but at 3 bucks a pop they are kinda pricey, but there are worse things I could spend 3 bucks on I guess.

Here's why I like it:\\n\\n1) The location: It's probably the most centrally located quick-service restaurant in the Magic Kingdom. It's inside Tomorrow Land (with three different entrances), just steps from the main square and castle, and very close to Fantasy Land. You can also get here within 5 minutes from some parts of Adventure Land (such as the Swiss Family Treehouse) and Liberty Square (such as the Hall of Presidents).  \\n\\n2) The size: It's also probably the largest quick service restaurant in the Magic Kingdom, with lots and lots of air conditioned seating. I have never had a problem finding a seat here, even during the busiest of times (there is, however sometimes lines to order food, so do yourself a favor and order ahead with the Disney App).\\n\\n3) The food and prices: I absolutely love the chicken nuggets and fries here: they are really, really yummy and something I look forward to every time I come to Disney World. That said, the food here isn't going to win any Michelin Stars, but most of the dishes are an extraordinary value for theme park dining considering the reasonable prices. Additionally, they have a very large \\"toppings bar\\" where you can take as many veggies as you like.\\n\\n4) The ambiance: I also really like watching the animatronic alien \\"piano man\\" who entertains diners with jokes and songs. As far as I know, this is the only quick-service restaurant in any of the parks that has something like him. It's really a nice touch and a great way to keep kids occupied during dinner.\\n\\nWhile Cosmic Rays isn't going to win any awards for its food, it is a great place to get out of the heat and enjoy a reasonably-priced meal in a fun setting. \\n\\nThey have a full allergy-friendly menu (as most Disney restaurants do now)."},{"name":"Fat Matt's Rib Shack","address":"1811 Piedmont Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Did not like ribs... until Fat Matt's entered my life.

Among the sandwiches, our server said her favorites were the BBQ pulled pork, the smoked beef brisket, and the pimento cheeseburger. Their \\"Southern-Style Banh Mi\\" sounded the most interesting but I decided to go with their \\"Fried Chicken Salad\\". I hadn't been to South City Kitchen in a while but I remember enjoying my Fried Chicken Salad at their Vinings location. \\n\\nFRIED CHICKEN SALAD - $11.75\\nMixed greens, Valbreso feta, chopped cucumbers, big thick chunks of smoked bacon, and their yummy herb-buttermilk dressing (which had a nice kick too!). Interestingly the fried chicken fingers were served next to the salad (vs. on top). Regardless, the chicken was so flavorful and tender. Nice portion and I actually couldn't finish the chicken -- so I had a nice snack for later (and had the leftover herb-buttermilk dressing as my dipping sauce).

We ordered both entrees split in half, and that's what we got, four plates with exactly half of the entree.\\n\\nBoth entrees were kind of average.  The pizza was decent.  Properly baked with a crispy crust.  The crust appeared hand-spread out, but I'm not 100% sold on if it was made from scratch, but it was a prepared well.  The sandwich, served on a brioche bun had all the ingredients as promised, but a little too busy for your tastebuds to decipher.

Chef Mike (the microwave) must have been pulling a double that day. Dry, tasteless, and old was the common denominator here. Usually I am not so crappy, but when you see both meals hardly touched and we didn't ask for a box... that should have been the hint.

My plan for this evening was to mix it up- the chicken liver appetizer, soup and a side veggie. My man ordered the shrimp and scallops with grits.\\n\\nThe She crab soup arrived first. I was looking forward to a nice warm soup on this chilly evening and found gloppy gravy instead. A thick soup is great if its thick because of the number of ingredient, but this was just plain thick. It was so heavy we had a few spoons and put it aside. I had a feeling that I would remember this soup for all the wrong reasons later. (Yep, confirmed.)\\n\\nEntrees arrived quickly after. My chicken livers were supposed to be lightly pan fried, giving me the hope that there would be a little crispiness, but that was not the case. These were dense and overly sauced. I believe they were \\"pan fried\\" hours ago, losing any sense of \\"crisp\\". After a few bites I gave up- another disappointment. My man's entree looked good, but very small. For $18.50, there was little more than a handful of grits, 2 scallops and three shrimp. Sheesh. The grits were very course and tasted strongly of the shrimp- a little too much of the wrong flavor for our tastes. \\n\\nSince we both had plenty of room left, we opted for the carrot cupcake for dessert.

Though ironically enough, even though I was most eager to try the chicken, I left in love with a cocktail.\\n\\nBack to the chicken, it was pretty good but not so good that I wanted to start being a missionary for the cult of South City Kitchen fried chicken. It probably didn't help that I was still kinda full from a huge lunch and the appetizers beforehand. I did appreciate that the generous portion of chicken was deboned which made for easy eatin'. Juicy inside, crispy outside. The accompanying collard greens and mashed potatoes were excellent.\\n\\nOur group shared the local smoked trout crostini ($19) as an appetizer, and it was okay. Not too memorable though, could've used a little more flavor. You get a complimentary bread basket to start--hooray for that.\\n\\nOn the beverage side of things, the Peach Next Door ($11) came highly recommended by our server. Initially I was wary since it contained [local] vodka and I'm not a fan of the colorless liquor, but the vodka taste didn't overwhelm the cocktail. I love shrub and peaches, and Prosecco is fine by me, so I was super content. Yay.\\n\\nOur server was great, really professional and attentive.

This is pretty much as good as it gets without actually going to Japan. If it's good enough for Matt Heafy of Trivium it's sure good enough for me. \\n\\nThe owners put their heart into making these bowls. They all look like works of art. The place just screams Austin. The bathrooms are all covered in elaborate artwork. Yes, you will wait in line. Yes. It is worth the wait. Yes, I would love to accompany you for a bowl of ramen!\\n\\nThis was the one thing that made me sad when I left Austin, having to say goodbye to this place. Houston has Tiger Den, but Ramen Tatsuya is far superior, which is saying something, because the Tiger Den in Houston is awesome. \\n\\nI've been to this place so many times. I've tried everything on the menu. Yes. Everything. Literally. Everything is good. Everything. Yes. Everything. Don't make me repeat it. \\n\\nToppings I like:\\nBeni Shoga - their housemade pickled ginger. Amazing. Good. Fresh. Get it.\\nAjitama egg - marinated egg. Done very well. To perfection. I won't eat ramen without it.\\nNaruto Maki - standard japanese fish cake. Nothing really special about this, doesn't really have a strong taste, only that it looks purty, and it reminds me of too many anime shows. \\nBrussel spouts - chargrilled (and fried?). You will be a believer in eating your veggies.\\ncorn bomb - buttered corn. Simple, yet good.\\nspicy bomb - will make your ramen spicy delicious. It does have a good kick.\\nfire in a bowl - Yes. It is fire in a bowl. This shit is hot. Has a pepper paste consistency. You might be insane to put the whole thing in your soup. Share with this others. \\n\\nAppetizers I like:\\nSweet & sour yodas - They're chargrilled brussel sprouts with an apricot vinegar mix. I just know that I can't stop eating them. Sweet and sour as suggested.\\nGyozas - They're done well. pan fried.\\n\\nFavorite Ramens:\\nMi-so-hot - This is pretty much my holy grail of ramens. I notice this ramen is slightly thicker that the others (probably because of the miso paste) and I always find it difficult to finish. the flavor is so delicious. So rich. So flavorful. There's so much going on in it. \\nTsukumen - Dipping ramen. This is for the experienced ramen goers. the broth is condensed and thick. There's almost a subtle smoky flavor that I can't quite put my finger on. the noodles are thick and chewy. They give you a lime to spruce up your noodles halfway through the bowl. \\nTonkotsu shoyu - My sisters and friends like this one a lot. I get this to change up from getting the mi-so-hot all the time. It's pretty much the tonkotsu original with a soy sauce blend. I'll get this and add a bunch toppings. \\n\\nOther stuff: The cashu pork over rice is excellent. But let's be honest. You came here for ramen.\\n\\nOverall this is the best place to come for ramen. I wouldn't come here with a big crowd though as seating is very limited and it's always packed, unless y'all are wiling to divide your party. Ideally no more than 3-4. After eating this you start to think back to your college days when you ate that 10-cents-a-packet crap and wondered what the hell you were thinking. Don't worry. You know better now. \\n\\nOh, one other thing. If you come here for the lunch service they have a different ramen (ol skool ramen). It's not the tonkotsu that everyone raves about, but if you want, try it out. They don't do take out but they will give you to-go cups for what you order inside.

That concludes the features, but it's totally cool because what they do works.\\n\\nThe fries were just about the closest to McDonald's fries I have found, and I mean that in a good way. When you add the truffle oil they become about as addictive as cocaine. The burger was cooked as requested, and although the burger was small, it was packed with flavor. It had a very beefy taste with loads of black pepper that I loved. It was also salted well. We tried bacon on ours, and while the bacon was good, I felt it only distracted from the nice beef flavor. I would skip it next time.\\n\\nTheir in house ketchup has a twist of spicy to it that I liked. This is a nice little burger stop.

Also, many of the other local dining establishments exhibited the ambiance of multiple board of health violations, and we set our level of enthusiasm accordingly as we continued ambling about the neighborhood.\\n\\nI can't believe there wasn't a line out the door to get into this restaurant, especially because it is pretty tiny. The atmosphere was like being in someone's home, but the home of someone who invited you over for dinner and not someone whose home you burglarized and is pissed off to find you there and calls the cops and possibly shoots you. This was the definitely like the first one, I would say.\\n\\nI hate eggplant. I don't know what family of vegetable that eggplant comes from, but I'm pretty sure it's the Vomitus Throwupitus species of plant life. This knowledge not deterring my aforementioned woman, she starts trying to persuade me to try her meal, which was a combination of chicken and eggplant parmigiana. I don't even know why I agreed to try it, since I'm pretty sure I would have preferred to have a donkey hoof-bash me in my genitals, given the choice. I guess I wasn't given the choice, since I ended up trying her eggplant/chicken hybrid concoction.\\n\\nThis was one of the most delicious things I've ever eaten. I'm not kidding. I ate half of her dinner, and she was gracious enough to share half of mine. I ate like a total slob, and we left there fat and elated with our good fortune in having discovered such a gem as Mario's. If you like to be fat and elated, this is the place for you. That's what I think.\\n\\nWe don't go into the city often, but we have actually been talking about going back to Mario's, except we didn't recall the name. We grabbed a cab and directed the driver to the general neighborhood we remembered wandering around in 2 years, 6 months, and 3 weeks ago, and we found it. Anyway, the name is Mario's, so don't be an idiot and write that down right now. I'll wait.\\n\\nWhile you're at it, make a note that it is located in Day Square in East Boston. It is a pretty quick walk from Airport Station on the blue line of the T, except if you're totally lost and aren't looking for it, in which case it is a much longer walk.\\n\\nYou know what else? I'll tell you. When they bring out the bread and the butter, the butter is room temperature so you can actually spread it on said bread. It's a small detail, but I don't know how many times I've had to put subzero butter in my armpit or the crack of my rear end at a restaurant for a half hour in order to render it usable. The bread, meanwhile, has grown a fuzzy layer of penicillin on it by the time the butter is ready to do its job. All of that is unnecessary in the presence of restauranteurs who aren't morons. That's Mario's for you. If you like going to places that are not run by morons, then this is your kind of place. I feel confident in saying that.\\n\\nGo to Mario's, and when you go there, don't forget to order some food. That's the best thing to do at this place, in my opinion."},{"name":"Tia's Waterfront","address":"200 Atlantic Ave, Fl 1","city":"Boston","stars":"2.5","text":"I had gone to Tia's once a few years ago and was very unimpressed, but when I went back last Saturday, I enjoyed it.

There was no dish among the 8 dishes we ordered that I was impressed with, except for possibly the corn pancakes.

Additionally, we got the dark chocolate dessert option, and the bread appeared to be burnt?\\n\\nAMBIANCE: I went to the restaurant at 6:30pm, and it was already incredibly dark. For that time of day, I definitely think there should have been more light. It created somewhat of a weird ambiance inside.\\n\\nSERVICE: The service was fine, but not outstanding. For instance, it would have been nice for the restaurant to comp the dessert since it was a birthday dinner.

I mean, to the point that if anyone had asked about my meal, I would have told them it was gross and wouldn't have felt bad about getting a refund.

But yelp doesn't give me the option. Ramen is hoso-men (skinnier noodles) with a rich tonkotsu base. The sad thing I saw is how many people treated eating ramen like your average wine and dine experience. When one does that they end up with bloated noodles that's lost all texture. Eating ramen requires certain actions. It's Japanese comfort fuel food. You eat the bloat-able noodles asap while still enjoying the other toppings and broth. The egg topping is by far the best I've ever tasted. The egg alone I would say is to die for. I have no idea how they always perfectly cook that soaked half boiled egg with so much flavor. If your looking for authenticity in Ramen, this could be the place in South central Texas for ya. 0.5 stars lost for all the hipsters too worried to get splashes of broth on their faces while eating at the said establishment."},{"name":"Condado Tacos","address":"132 S High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"First time ever eating here & I love it.

It is now my favourite HK wonton noodle shop in the Vancouver area!  \\n\\nTried a few dishes:\\n\\nBeef Brisket Wonton noodles:  I have a big mouth, but these are two bite wontons.  The wontons were close to perfect.  They had nice juicy shrimp which had a pleasant crunch and the wrapper was a very thin tender skin.  The brisket was extremely tender, just the right amount of fat, and had a nice hint of star anise to highlight the flavours.    The noodles were perfectly cooked, didn't clump together, and did not have that ammonia taste you sometimes find at other wonton noodle shops where they don't change the boiling water often enough.  The broth pulled it all together, and was not overly salty. The brisket ended up giving the broth a slight anise overtone as well, that added nice complexity to the flavour profile.  I particularly liked the housemade chili sauce that had a nice hint of spice and slight smokiness, without being overpowering.  It highlighted flavours without killing them.  \\n\\nChinese Veggies:  This one was an accident.  I thought we were ordering a side of steamed veggies with oyster sauce.  But it was actually also a noodle soup!  Oops!  This one came with a clearer broth, which was once again flavourful, but not overly salty, and had more of a shrimp taste than the other broth.  The veggies were perfectly cooked, still with a slight crunch.  The noodles were the same perfect little wonders.  So although it was a misorder on my part, it turned out just fine - but they could make that a bit clearer on the menu I think.  \\n\\nChicken knees:  Some people love breasts.  Some love legs and thighs.  It is knees for me!  I'm a chicken knee addict.  I crave these little crunchy morsels whenever I am within range.  The version served here was a generous portion that had them mixed with sliced jalapenos.  The dish was salted - but to a pleasant level, and the spice of the jalapenos balanced really nicely with the crunchy fried knees.  One of the better renditions I have had in the Vancouver area.  \\n\\nThey also gave complimentary drink of your choice (Horlicks, Lemon Iced Tea, Coffee, etc.) as in HK.  The lemon iced tea had a generous amount of lemon slices (4 or 5) and a ton of sugar.  It was slightly over sweetened for me.  I laughed when I noticed a person at the next table who also got the lemon tea and they turned the sugar container upside down and started watching it all enter the glass.  It looked like someone waiting for an hour glass to completely empty.  That person will be diabetic by tomorrow I think!  But I digress....\\n\\nThis was a great recommendation, and I will definitely be returning to work my way through the rest of their menu!  \\n\\nSidenote:  If you can't find the place - just look for the shop across the lot called, \\"Exotic Meats.\\"  Not sure what they have on offer there.

Probably should have looked at yelp and seen that there's virtually no mention of anything about a Lobster Roll... Bad sign. Not even a picture.

It is the perfect balance of savory from the cured ham and sweet from the fig jam all on top of a thin crispy crust. \\n\\nNow the lobster roll... my boyfriend had the perfect word to describe it. Underwhelming. Painfully so. You know all those pictures of lobster rolls you see all over Boston blogs and yelp and such? The ones where there's a mess of glorious lobster claw/knuckle mixture all on top of a buttery roll that can barely keep it contained??! ... This was the opposite.

I was excited because I love burgers and I figured the \\"Sauce\\" was similar to the Tasty Burger sauce (most burger places seem to imitate the Big-Mac sauce or something similar) - when I unwrapped the burger it was very soggy (bun is already moist and being wrapped with all the heat made it very mushy) and the fries were the same.

This time I got onion rings which were OK.\\n\\nToday I went and decided that I would order in house to see if maybe this was better than the soggy wrapped burgers previously. I ordered the Bacon Blue Burger - it was fairly good (nothing mind blowing) but definitely was a step up from previous experience. The burger was cooked well and the bun was very soft.

The concept is fun, albeit a little kitschy, with plenty of stoner jokes and psychedelic art all over the place. I guess it makes sense seeing that it's smack dab in the middle of the U-district?\\n\\nAs for the food, the highlight was the bruschetta, with the addition of feta (Greek twist) and a little drizzle of balsamic. Really light and tasty. The pizzas seem to indulge in the crazy flavor combinations, so we got a hot wing pizza and the bayou blue (Blue cheese+shrimp)..The wait was rather long for our group (20+ minutes?), and the pizza was alright, but nothing to write home about. If anything I was surprised that the blue cheese+shrimp combination worked, seeing that they kept it subtle. \\n\\nTotal price without drinks was about $40 for two small pizzas and an app, which was a little hard to swallow.

It's not bad, but a 5 star average? Come on... The now defunct Classic India on Hancock might have deserved such high ratings, but not Punjab.\\n\\nI was very excited to first find Punjab on Yelp, because I'd been looking for a new local Indian restaurant since Classic India closed. My first impression: the mild Chicken Tikka Masala was very bland, they didn't bring out Papadum before the meal as is custom in Indian restaurants, and even when I ordered a serving of it, it arrived with the meal and without tamarind sauce. The inside was very cramped with people sitting all around us, and the overweight waitress(/owner?) struggled to squeeze in between the tables. It wasn't a great experience, I didn't plan to go back.\\n\\nMy father tried the place again and said it was much better, that the Tikka Masala was much more flavorful when you ordered it Medium. I did so on another occasion and it was great. The next time I came back, I ordered the same dish and it was so spicy I couldn't stand to eat it. Maybe this was a fluke? I came back again and ordered the Medium - way too hot a second time. I went again and tried to explain to them the problem with inconsistency, that I didn't know which to order, so maybe they could make it somewhere in between Mild and Medium, or a Medium that isn't terribly spicy? They acted as though this was impossible and I ended up with food way spicier than I would eat yet again. I'm not sure if I'll go back, it's just so frustrating for a restaurant to have an inconsistent measure of heat in their food. I feel as though it's generous of me to give a 2-star rating given multiple unsatisfactory visits. Not once did their fare come close to the \\"best Indian food I've ever had\\" as so many reviewers proclaim. I can only assume they've never tried India Quality in Kenmore.\\n\\nAlso, beware of their \\"delivery.\\" They deliver through a delivery company, which claims to offer \\"free delivery,\\" while they increase the prices of dishes to somewhat outrageous numbers, especially if you're ordering for a group."},{"name":"The Hideaway Bar","address":"516 Virginia Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Gross and disgusting.

Most of the times I have visited the Wild Horse Cafe I have ordered the duck offering (if there was one on on the menu at the time) and I have had pork and beef there as well. Brendan Crockers cooking style, sides and sauces compliment the meats very well and I have always been satisfied if not blown away. One of my favorite meals of all time was eaten at this very restaurant, it was a plum duck dish that was rich and tasty, soft and crispy, without being gamey or overly oily.\\n\\nI plan on writing a more comprehensive review after my next visit which I hope to make in the near future. I give this restaurant four out of five stars because of it's strange location for such a nice place and I have not been in so long I feel wrong handing out a five until I let the food blow me away once more.\\n\\nI also wanted to comment about something pointed out about the service in a previous review. I am a fan of micro brews or small breweries and uncommon beer styles, but many people are not. Including waitstaff, and often even bartenders. I also happen to be a bartender during the summer and know that not all of my coworkers drink beer at all, even though they pour them all day. It is important for the staff of a restaurant to familiarize themselves with products, but because we aren't allowed to drink on the job, the management of the restaurant should set up tastings when bringing in new stock. Waiters should offer tastings, but it is unfair to expect a waiter to do something and then not ask them to perform it. If I were a customer and expected the waiter to offer a taste, I would ask for a taste. Ommegang is also not super well-known to most people, and Belgian beer styles (as Ommegang is actually from NY) are strong and unappealing to people who don't often drink beer (my wife). So for anyone reading this, just ask the waiter or bartender for a taste if they don't know how to describe the beer. It's too bad if they don't but they shouldn't refuse you a taste. If they refuse, then complain."},{"name":"Ramen Tatsu-Ya","address":"8557 Research Blvd, Ste 126","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Triple UPdate? ugh! ugh!\\n\\nTatsu-ya now offers their full menu during lunch!!

Of course you're on theme park property so the prices will be more than usual, but in my opinion, I still like to enjoy what I'm paying for. And if my $12 drink comes in a tiny water cup, I'm not super pleased.

She said what I expected, there was no where good in Portland for good Chinese food. We chatted about other cities that host awesome Chinese food, like San Francisco (possibly better than St Louis). Then almost as an after thought, she mentioned she had been hearing a lot about Wong's King on Beaverton Hillsdale. \\nSo today I rallied the family for some Dim Sum. I was thrilled, the fried rice was truelly fried rice. The BBQ Pork Rice Rolls were heavenly, and the Crab Wontons, actually were loaded with crab and not with cream cheese! \\nMy entire family of 4 ate and stuffed ourselves for $26.

The corn muffins are so, so good with sweet corn kernels baked in and the biscuits remind me of my own Grandmother's, which was such a great memory to rekindle.  My entree was one of the fish specials of Grouper, which was so, so good.  Hot and perfectly cooked.  My sister the lamb shank and absolutely loved it.  We were too full for dessert but plan to return soon for brunch, which Evangeline recommended.

My friends had never tried banh mi, so I suggested a trip to Lily's.  I had already eaten,  so while they lunched, I camped out and nursed a bubble tea from next door at Short 'n' Sweet.\\n\\nWhile I was at Short 'n' Sweet, I spotted some pre-made packages of sticky rice with Chinese sausage on top.  It looked intriguing, but I wasn't that hungry and it looked like these packages cost $7 or so, so I left them behind.\\n\\nAnyway, the next morning, I woke up with an INSANE craving for that sticky rice with Chinese sausage.  So that's how I came to leave my cozy little central Austin territory for the wilds of Chinatown twice in the same weekend.\\n\\nI went to Short 'n' Sweet.  They were out of sticky rice.\\n\\nSo I went to Lily's.  And there, on the shelf next to the counter, were some pretty ample packages of sticky rice topped with Chinese sausage and chicken.  I took one to the register, fully expecting him to ask me for $5, $6, or even $7.\\n\\n\\"Two dollars,\\" he said.\\n\\nTWO DOLLARS?  Brimming with glee, I gave him my two bucks and wandered out of the restaurant, clutching my little package of joy.\\n\\nAnd it was good.  It tasted like something my grandmother would have made.  The meat was flavorful and the sticky rice was the perfect texture.  I even discovered some little paper-thin siices of fried garlic goodness.  It was like going home.  Only better, because instead of being in Minnesota, I got to sit on the bleachers in the big tent that had been set up for the Lunar NY celebration and watch some traditional Japanese dancing while I feasted on my two dollar lunch and soaked in the balmy Austin \\"winter\\" weather.\\n\\nCan't beat that.\\n----------\\nEDIT:  3/16/08:  I tried the banh mi here ($2.50-$3.00) this weekend and wasn't impressed.  They're OK in a pinch, but as others mentioned, they butter the bread, which tastes all wrong to me.  And I asked the guy at the counter whether the one I ordered (the \\"Lily's Gourmet Sandwich\\") had pate' in it, and he said it did - but no pate'.  Pate' is key to a good banh mi, IMO.  Also, Tam toasts its banh mi just a little, which I prefer - it gives the bread a little of that fresh-out-of-the-oven crunch and flavor.  I'd pick Tam over Lily's given the choice, but if you're in the Chinatown complex, still a good place for some cheap eats."},{"name":"South City Kitchen Midtown","address":"1144 Crescent Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Great food, great service.

If you don't know this, the UK is just jammed with really great Indian/Pakistani/Bangladeshi restaurants - quite possibly the best of their genre anywhere in the world, save for the very top places on the sub-continent itself. I've also been eating this type of food for over 40 years. So, sorry - I'm going to have to pull rank on the average US Indian food denizen here and let you know what's really going on....\\n\\nThe Indian food at this place is just painfully bad. Bad, I tell you! The curries are watery and bland, which comes as something of a relief since the portions are so small and puny - god forbid there would be great food at these sizes! I ordered Lamb Vindaloo medium-hot, but no hint of the vinegary, mustard-seed-like searing flavour here... tasted more like a nondescript thin gravy of some kind.  My wife ordered Chicken Tikka Masala and, again, was watered-down and bland to the point that we could easily be eating Campbell's tomato soup with canned chicken bits mixed in. Naan bread was dried out and not buttery, I swear the rice was just Uncle Ben's - not aromatic at all, stuck together - ugh. Christ, even the Taj Mahal beers were flat as a pancake and just how the hell can you mess that up, anyway?! The one redeeming feature in the food here was the tandoori chicken - moist, fresh and flavorful. But this was a side-dish for us and cannot make up for the disastrous main courses.\\n\\nService was prompt, warm, courteous and pleasant but what difference does that make when the food misses the mark so widely. Ah well, lesson learned - will continue to visit the far superior Indian Delight and Fishtail Kitchen in nearby Weymouth - they're not perfect, but head and shoulders above this place.\\n\\nI can only conclude that the buffet is somehow superior to the dinner offerings here - I never tried it, and probably never will now - since so many high marks on here seem to mention that.

Oysters were fantastic, but the Popcorn Crawfish needed to be crunchier on the outside to complement the meat on the inside, but the aioli served with it was very delicious.  The Horseradish Crusted Salmon and the Dungeness Crab and Shrimp Stuffed Salmon were good, but felt a bit lacking.  The Stuffed Halibut (what I ordered), despite being one of the more expensive items, just was not up to snuff; the edges were much to bland to be pleasurable, although the center provided me with several bites of bliss which sort of made up for it.  Surprisingly, the item that I felt was the best was the Chicken Linguine; despite being under half the price, the flavors were nearly as good as what I ordered.  This was quite unfortunate.  I'm so glad that their dessert selection did a fairly decent job of removing the buyer's remorse that I had felt.  The Chocolate Mousse was pretty good, and so was the Bread Pudding.

The staff seemed inattentive with a lost in space kind of mentality because we were standing at the host stand for a good 2 minutes waiting for a hostess or some kind of acknowledgement. No hostess at the hostess at the hostess stand. The blond bartender with the stylish hair dew was shaking a drink behind the bar and she saw that we were waiting, but never made a gesture or inform anyone to service us. \\n\\nFinally a young lady, who seemed to be the hostess came to the host stand to greet us. No apology for no one being there to greet us and making us wait, which was a little off putting. \\n\\nShe welcomed us and asked if we had a reservation. We replied no. She asked how many in our party and we replied \\"3\\"! She informed us that they don't have anything available at the moment, but if we would have a seat at the bar, we might get a table in about 20 minutes. I don't have a problem waiting 20 minutes for tables. What I have an issue with is that We were asked to wait for a table in a restaurant that was currently only serving 2 tables. She said that the rest of the tables were committed, but if one didn't show we would get the table. \\n\\nIf one didn't show? What kind of answer is that? What they do show? Does this mean we'll have to wait longer? I have to gamble our time on wether or not someone shows up for a reservation? I could have accepted if she told me we were completely booked for the moment and have something in a couple of hours, but to sit at the bar and see if we \\"might\\" get a table is amateurish. \\n\\nThen a manager came over and instead of offering a more informed quote time to get a table, she offered us seating outside. Now the weather outside tonight was optimal for outdoor seating, and my family and I enjoy eating outside from time to time. However, their outdoor seating looked more like a waiting area and not a dinning area. Not set properly! Incomplete! Uninviting!

Bar-B-Q","address":"1238 Dekalb Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"To review Q - oh, the danger.  The problem is that Q is deeply personal.  People who grew up in Atlanta (like me) generally like sweeter, tomato-based sauces.  People who grew up in North Carolina, for instance, seem to think vinegar is the only important ingredient in a sauce.  For the funniest summary of various preferences (and some gratuitous but funny slams on Alabama and Yankees), see http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ubTQfr_tyY.  Disclaimer aside, here's my take on Fox Bros.  \\n\\nOff the bat, I'm a certified Memphis BBQ Network/Memphis in May Q judge, so I'm a good bit pickier than your average bear.  They are for my money the best Q inside the Perimeter - I haven't been to the places in Marietta folks rave about, but ITP I think they're it.  I almost always get the ribs, which range from good to exceptional (when they have the perfect come-off-the-bone-with-a-tug texture).  I also love their poppers, the sides generally, and the Tomminator and Lopez are the best things to happen to tater tots ever.  Oh, and the 'burger' is a stunning tribute to gluttony, even by my meat-centered standards.  \\n\\nFor folks from TX, which is where the Bros are from, their brisket is occasionally pretty dry, but again I don't know of better inside the city (largely because beef ain't Q, but that's another rant).  Their pulled pork is also usually pretty good, and isn't shredded to all get-out, so you can actually appreciate the quality of their work.  Again, if I wasn't a judge, and spoiled by competition Q, I'd probably rave on about it.  Haven't tried their chicken, since pork is the point.  \\n\\nBottom line - on average days, the best Q in town (ITP).

The ramen quality itself seemed average I guess I expected more but either way the things that come along with it really seem to compliment the dish well. The soft boiled egg gives a good consistency and flavor to the broth. The broth itself was very hearty which is good for ramen but was a bit fatty for my liking. The chashu is to die for...not entirely sure how this is prepared but its magic in  your mouth. Nori is a must (seaweed) as is onions (green and white). \\n\\nThe price is a bit more then I expected for such a simple dish but they have a good reputation as well as an amazing presentation when it comes to \\"a bowl of ramen\\" I would highly suggest anyone check this place out if its in  your area!"},{"name":"Franklin Barbecue","address":"900 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Overrated.

I had Tatsuya on Fri and Michi on Sunday. I like Michi's noodles (preferred thick noodles with good springiness to them. Tatsuya's are fine as well, but thinner). Michi's eggs were tasty (added to bowl, does not come with the standard order) and had a hint of soy to them. Tatsuya's eggs were comparable, and we're included.  Chashu at Michi was not as flavorful and was not as fatty, nor did it fall apart. Looked like there were grill marks on them, but it didn't taste like it.. didn't taste like much. I prefer fatty chashu that falls apart when picked up and with a more smoky flavor. I liked Tatsuya's chashu more because it had a good flavor. I think either I went to Tatsuya on an off day, or my expectation offered bias, but I felt like their broth was less complex than I remembered(I remembered it being multi dimensional in terms of flavors,  but sadly I felt like this was more like just ham like porky thin broth) I liked it more after a spice bomb, but I hate changing up the taste myself. I went to Tatsuya late night on a stormy, colder night while starving, so I still savoured my bowl there, but it wasn't quite what I remembered from my first experience there a few years ago. The bf had a curry bowl at Tatsuya, and it was served lukewarm. It seemed to be a pretty generic curry bowl, but I guess you don't really come here for that kind of thing. The star is supposed to be the ramen. The ramen was the same way in terms of temp. In terms of the wait~15 min at Tatsuya on Friday (research blvd location) and none at Michi @12 pm on Sun. The other couple we went with preferred Tatsuya over Michi because they liked the taste of the broth (they had miso), but overwhelming preference by the whole group for Michi's noodles. The other couple also thought the kimchiladas were strange, and didn't finish those. I'd probably give it another shot if there is a short line and I'm in the area, but otherwise I can take myself elsewhere."},{"name":"Ramen Tatsu-Ya","address":"8557 Research Blvd, Ste 126","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"This place is not for the weak.

They don't give big portions of noodles with your order. So be prepared to order kaedama. The ajitama is seasoned well with a melty yolk. I felt they could improve on their chashu - I would like it more tender and fatty. Also, the spicy paste that we added on tastes like gochujang (korean red pepper paste), which I felt did not go well with either noodles.\\n\\nThe price is good at $9 for the tonkotsu ramen and $1.40 for kaedama.

I've pretty much tried everything on their vegetarian menu and can really say I love every single dish. They give a generous amount with each dish they serve so there are always left overs and the price to food (quality) ratio is great! Plus they serve hot tortilla chips and salsa to start off with and you really can't ask for anything more....actually, I take that back. Definitely ask for their Margaritas! Their strawberry frozen margarita is my favorite, but all that I've tried (everything from the original to the melon) has been great. The mixing is awesome and I can seriously have 2-3 of those in a row and be good for the rest of the night.\\n\\nI've been here a fair amount of times now and it always amazes me how big this place is. It must serve at least 200 people in one go on a busy dinner night and that's not counting the people at the bar. With that many people you'd imagine that having been there 10 times or so, at least once would have been a bad or a not so pleasant experience. Except that hasn't been the case at all. I've ALWAYS had smiling waiters who are ever so willing to bring you anything and everything you ask for. And that too with haste. Really am very satisfied with them. \\n\\nAnd lastly, the location is easily accessible. It's in Harvard Sq right next to the T near the theater. Plus it serves mainly to the university crowd so the prices are more than affordable - in fact, you can almost get 2 meals out of their entrees.

We decided to check it out and were optimistic at first.  We were seated right away (6:00pm on a Friday night) and our waiter was attentive.  The drinks and food all came out quickly, and I was already writing a great Yelp review in my head... until I bit into my burger.  \\n\\nAt first, I thought they had brought me a veggie burger.  I had ordered the Mighty Mushroom burger, and I called our waiter back to ask him if he had brought me the wrong thing.  It seriously did not taste like meat.  He then told me that the mushrooms had been mixed into the burger, which I assume is what happened with the bacon as well, but I tell you what, I couldn't taste a damn bit of it.  It was like a spongy veggie burger of the worst degree, which made the BBQ sauce overwhelming rather than complimentary.  I got no mushroom taste all, but there was an dominate taste of red pepper, of which I am not a fan and which was not mentioned in the menu description.  So much for the \\"mighty.\\"  \\n\\nMy boyfriend got the English burger and was equally unimpressed by it.  It was underwhelming and a bit too rare for a medium rare burger.  There was nothing exciting or different about it; we have definitely made better burgers at home.  \\n\\nI will say that the fries were pretty good.  \\n\\nThe service was ok, nothing extraordinary, but not bad either.  We were served in a very timely manner, but without much personality.  Some people like that, but I don't mind a little enthusiasm.

After a long wait during the construction, and one false start when we thought they were open and walked over recently to find they weren't ( that's okay, we kept walking to 1803 Pizza Kitchen around the corner), we got in for dinner this past Saturday at about 6:30.  The table service is open now, and there was a large party of 18 taking up two tables and most of the restaurant. We sat at one of the few 2 tops, but quickly realized that the noise would affect our dining experience so opted to be moved to the outside bar window.\\n\\nFirst, I have to say that the wait staff was very friendly and helpful.  We ordered chips and salsa for 2 (2.95), guacamole(9.00)right off the bat,and it was delicious. We also had a glass of wine each.  The dishes were explained, and we settled for a piri piri chicken dish ( barbecue half chicken with a dipping sauce) which came with fries (perfectly cooked and a bit salty) and a rather small typical salad (13.95), and an order of 3 Carnitas Tacos, which were pork (10.95).   Carnitas were great, tasty and fresh.  The chicken dish is supposed to be served with a brush to apply the dipping sauce however they had run out of brushes, and the barkeep only found that out after the dish arrived and had to ask for it. My first bites of the leg were wonderful, as was the subsequent thigh, however when we got around to the breast, we found it  a bit rubbery and tough, and though not rare, it was just barely over that threshold, and it definitely could have stood an an additional few minutes cooking to make it as tender as the dark meat.\\n\\nI found the atmosphere overall fun and casual, and it reminded me of sidling up to a bar stool at a beach bar.  The outside patio which fronts Corinne filled up while we were there, and the guitarist arrived and began to play. Music was just right - (provided background ambiance and didn't overshadow the dining experience by being overly loud).  \\n\\nI'd like to try again when less busy - this is a welcome addition to the Corinne corridor which now has many great little spots.  It would be great if they could find a way to minimize the noise inside the restaurant.  I think the floors were concrete, and though probably easy to maintain, they promoted the sound level to an unpleasant din.

Best freaking ribs EVEEER! I visited Atlanta because my bf had a work thing going on and I tagged along. Since we were in a BBQ state, I thought to myself \\"I'm definitely going to be trying some BBQ\\". I did some research and asked locals on Yelp talk. Judging by reviews and pictures, I decided on Fat Matts for several reasons.\\n1) It was the closest to where we were staying\\n2) The reviews and pics\\n3) I'm picky about my BBQ. I really am not a fan of super smoked charred BBQ. I know for some people, thats the standard, but not for me. I like tender, juicy slathered in tangy BBQ sauce ribs.\\nWell Fat Matts delivered in every way possible! When you first go in to this local hot spot you order at the front counter. The menu is small, simple and straight forward. Once you order, you get a little sign with a number on it. After that you need to wait for a seat to open up. This is a very small place that gets crowded, but people are pretty quick to eat and get up. My bf and I got a seat right up front near the awesome live band playing good ole southern jazz. I got my half rack with rum baked beans in no time and it looked delicious. Once I bit into those ribs.........well you know that episode of the Simpsons where Homer bites into the ribwich from Krusty Burger and his eyes dilate and he begins to have crazy hallucinations, well that was me. I was transported to my BBQ happy place and didn't leave till the very last bite. The ribs were EXACTLY the way I like them. Meaty, juicy, tender, fall off the bone covered in perfect BBQ sauce DELICIOUS with just the slightest bit of char. I had the rum baked beans as my side and they were soooooo rich and packed full of amazing flavor. Some people don't like this place probably because it's just not their style of BBQ, but if you read the reviews, the majority says this place is awesome. If you like your BBQ the way I do, this place is a MUST! I'm sooooooo glad I chose Fat Matts.

Booking the meat order was straightforward but not high tech - had some questions and dealt with them by email.  Basically on the day of your order you pick up the meat at 10:30 AM and avoid all the lines (I ordered brisket, pork ribs, and pulled pork).  While waiting inside for the various booked orders they offered ice tea / soda at no charge which was nice, also no waiting outside!  As this was my first time at Franklin's I decided that I would do a taste testing with my family and friends and also picked up the same meats at Salt Lick and Rudy's to compare directly the local BBQ favorites with Franklin's.  I ordered moist brisket and the standard pork ribs from each.  Then gathered family and friends together for a blind taste test of the BBQ to determine who has the best.  I laid out the three pork ribs and the three moist brisket BBQ  in a Battle to determine who has the BEST BBQ.  Everyone lined up to test each one. They could see, smell, and taste each plate but did not know who it was from until after everyone's vote was in.  Votes were based on each individual preference and not on any consensus. On the pork ribs the comments were Franklin's had a very strong pepper flavor but was thick and moist (several of the tasters don't like the pepper taste).  Rudy's had a great taste and was moist.  For the brisket the Franklin BBQ was a clear winner for taste and moist and juicy meat.  Based on the comments it clearly beat Salt Lick (my next most favorite) and Rudy's brisket.\\nSummary - The Winner for the best moist BBQ brisket by unanimous vote was Franklin's BBQ!  The Winner for the best pork rib was Rudy's BBQ (from Rudy's off south 360) with Franklin's BBQ getting some votes and Salt Lick getting one vote."},{"name":"Moonshine 152","address":"152 Dorchester Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"We came here last night with a Groupon.

The nachos were an unexpected dinner choice, but with the egg on top, they felt like a complete meal.  We finished with the chocolate bread pudding.

The place is nicely done with modern, pop-art ish burger-related (of course) art pieces. It's a colorful place. And it's very clean. \\n\\nSo before I came, I already checked out the menu and was deciding between a Kahuna burger or a Hubba. I went with the Hubba, which is a burger with chili and spicy cheese sauce. My friend ordered a Jalape√±o burger. The Hubba is a hot mess. It's wrapped up nicely when they give it to you but once you open it, oh my, you're in for some messy eating. Thank god for the red tray to catch all the chili, cheese dripping madness. The Hubba was satisfying, but I would have enjoyed more chill in it. It was more cheesy than anything else. If you want a cleaner but still spicy burger, I'd go with the jalape√±o. IT'S SPICY!! I think everything's spicy but this time, even my friend who's used to Korean spices thinks so. So BEWARE. \\n\\nIf you aren't a fan of red meat, you might want to ask them to cook it more well done. Our waiter informed us all patties are cooked to medium. It was slightly redder than I expected but I like red meat so I didn't mind. \\n\\nWe also shared a 50/50 with is a tray of fries and onion rings. Both had a nice crisp to them, but the fries were a bit too salty. The onion rings were really good though and their sweetness very apparent.\\n\\nI'm staying in Boston over the summer.

But the remaining 4 who were ordering shakes kept being passed over for customers ordering ice cream.  After 30 minutes, the 4 coworkers ordering shakes still hadn't gotten their orders and the 3 of us who ordered ice cream were done and ready to go.

Both dishes are relatively cheaper ($9 -$13) than the ramen price in NY ($13-18). \\n\\nIf you want a hot and satisfying ramen experience, definitely get the original ramen. It has a rich broth and i never had such a thin noodle before (even in Japan). It makes slurping much fulfilling experience. however, the downside is you have to get an extra noodle if you have a big appetite.\\n\\nMy first impression of tsukemen is that it is too rich and tasted like peanut sauce (my friend think so too). There's also lime in the sauce which help to cut the thickness. Downside is you probably have to drink lots of water while eating this dish.

We had just been to Eastern Standard the week before and had a fantastic time. But things started off bad when after a couple of our group members had a hard time finding parking and were a few minutes late for 11a reservations. The hostess came up to those of us that were there and informed us we only had our table until 12:30p as they had another group with reservations for our table coming in at that time. Mind you, we were a group of 5, not 15. The restaurant was better than half empty. And it was just a few minutes after 11a. Anyway, we sit by 11:15a and try to not let that ruin our morning. \\n\\nUnfortunately things didn't get much better. Service at the table was nearly non-existent. Multiple times we sat there with empty coffee mugs, water glasses, or drink glasses. And trying to flag down our waiter seemed futile too. You ask for coffee and water and you'll get one or the other. Apparently you can't ask for two things in the same breath.\\n\\nUnfortunately for Masa, the food was actually not bad. If I were reviewing just the food, it might have gotten 3 stars. The eggs benedict were alright. However, the portion size was grossly inconsistent. When sending the same dish to multiple people at the same table, you'd expect to keep things looking at least similar.

I got the meatball, which is not really meat in ball form, but really loose meat in a little gravy.  The roll was really really fresh and just perfect -- a thin crusty crust, with nice soft bread that soaks up the meat juices and squishes down EXACTLY the right amount so you get the perfect mouthful of bread,  cold crisp marinated cucumber and carrot, fresh cilantro, just enough jalepenos, and warm meat.   It was devine.   \\n\\nIt was only $2.50 !!!   I wanted to buy a dozen right there on the spot and eat one every day for lunch,  but you have to eat one of these right after its made, so the bread is fresh, the veggies are crisp,  the cilantro isn't wilted, and the meat is nice and warm.  Thats why you have to eat it in the car, before you get home.\\n\\nI really recommend the meatball.  Delicious spices.   I am sometimes afraid of getting a chicken or pork sandwich because I hate biting into that unexpected piece of gristle, not that I have ever done that here...

HOB is very casual and I love how its decorative  from head to toe it giving you a sense that you are in NOLA or the Mississippi delta.  We made reservations and were seated promptly and our waiter Robert provided excellent service however when asking for recommendations I did feel he was trying to upsell some of the items on the menu, rather than giving his own opinion.  The menu had changed since when I had last been and was disappointed to find less entrees and more sandwiches on the menu.  I feel the items have changed from being less cajun/Creole to now more bbq food giving it more of a southern themed menu than the Cajun menu that I remember - granted it has been years since my last visit.  We ordered the shrimp and grits, build your own burger and crispy chicken meal with tator tots and baked beans.  The crispy chicken was very good, but not crispy - not sure why they called it crispy chicken.  The baked beans and tator tots were good as well (but can you go wrong with tator tots?)  I thought the shrimp and grits were excellent and they did not skimp on the shrimp in my meal either.  The prices are a little higher than what I would like to pay for a meal however we are in Disney so that is an automatic expectation that the prices are going to be jacked up.

I have gone several times for lunch and taken clients or co-workers and they have always been impressed.  This is truly a unknown gem.

I woke up around 8 so that I could get there around 830, and when I got there, a line was already forming! Keep in mind that the place opens up around 11. I waited there for about 2 1/2 hours before it opened. The line that formed within those 2 1/2 hours was intense. It curved around the building and everything! Once the doors opened, I had to wait about an hour or so before I actually got my food. I loved how everything was really local and it didn't look like a big shot restaurant. I felt comfortable and kind of home-y. Franklin was adorable! He was really nice and friendly. He told us that each day, they serve about 1200 pounds of meat and it takes about 20 hours to get everything cooked for the next day!\\n\\nSo let me break down the meats. I got some brisket, ribs, and sausage. Their brisket was the greatest brisket I've ever had. It's smoked on the outside and juicy on the inside. There's just something about it though. It's amazing how he cooks it to where it just falls apart in your mouth! The ribs was amazing. The meat literally falls off the bone before you could even get it inside your mouth. It was probably the greatest ribs I've ever had. It was so soft and juicy. I've never been a huge fan of sausage, but these were great! The outside was so crispy and you could hear it snap once you bit into it. The only thing is that sausages are so full of grease and fat. When I squeezed it, grease and fat started dripping down my hand. Some people would like that, but it kinda made me feel ehhh... Over all, the food was amazing. This is probably the best bbq I've ever had.\\n\\nTheir bbq sauce was really good too! There was about 3 kinds of sauces. I'm not sure what they're called but there's a light colored one, medium colored one, and a dark colored one. I liked the lightest colored one just because it had that sweet tangy flavor to it. Some of my friends would mix the sauce, but I was just focused on eating lol\\n\\nIf you haven't gone to Franklin's, you need to! They give you everything you need. I went along with 4 friends and they actually gave us a whole loaf of bread at no extra charge so we can share. We also got extra sauce because face it. Without sauce, there's nothing!

So I can safely say I had enough ramen to be a fair judge. \\n\\nThe ramen here is decent but will not categorized as a culinary sensation. The noodle they use is a white thin noodle where it is chewy but not the right texture. The pork chashu pork is more of a roasted pork than a true pork chashu slice. Soup base has enough flavor but the original broth is too creamy. It made it taste good but over powers all other ingredients. The noodle sticked together as I was eating it so it was not boiled fresh or correctly. I ordered the original ramen with extra chashu and a beer. The total was $21. The bowl came with 3 pieces of chashu pork and was considered extra. \\n\\nThe price of the ramen, portion and quality is not impressive but I do ask you to be the judge of it and try it out before you take my review for granted.

The closest thing was a chopped pork sandwich, so I tried it. Not good at all. The pork was drenched in a sweet BBQ sauce (I DO NOT like sweet BBQ sauces) and the pork was quite soggy. The potato salad that I got as a side dish was obviously a couple days old and completely dried out.

We sat down and the new waitress (her 2nd day) was scrambling to help the chef/owner/ostensibly Jamaican \\"Dr. T\\" get ready a meal for the only other table of people in there. We eventually get menus from her- every menu is misleading. THERE ARE NO INGREDIENTS ON THE MENU. JUST NAMES. The \\"menus\\" have misleading \\"starting at\\" prices and that's it. So you will order something thinking it's 5.50 only to find out \\"Oh no, that was only the startin' price darlin\\". Anyway, the new girl didn't know where anything was and \\"Dr.\\" T just kept ordering her around, so it took some time to ask the price of everything etc. We eventually got a crepe (it was a pancake) and cost 12 dollars. It was pretty good, but again we didn't know what was all even in it. If you ask Dr. T says \\"Ohh good things, you'll like it!\\"  We finished the crepe in about 5 minnutes, but due to only two people working, it took us 40 minutes for the waiter to come back to us. We asked for a dessert  and \\"Dr.\\" T came out with something we didn't even ask for and served it to us. It was 6 pieces of chocolate, a little bigger than a Kiss. They were alright. We eventually walked up to pay and it was 23 dollars for one crepe and six pieces of chocolate. The only people who seem to not loathe this place are elderly people who have extra time and extra money to spend.

Considering that there are at least 50 Q joints in Austin, some chains and some mom and pop places, some relatively new ones and some that have been around for decades, it's simply ridiculous to assume that you can tell which brisket is the best or which sauce is better than all others. Clearly, online, TV and paper reviews have decided that Franklin is the best. However, do these reviewers come to Austin and try all the spots? Of course not. They go to the one that's currently the most popular, stand in line, smell the hype and write theiir story.

I never would have thought to combine sushi and burgers under one roof, let alone together in the same dish. But it just works.\\n\\nI've dined at Cowfish twice now. Here's my tips on what to order:\\n\\nAppetizers:\\nIf you like fish, order the Tuna & Avocado-Tini. Just trust me on this one. It's one of the most amazing appetizers ever. Rare tuna, chopped avocado and seaweed come together in a delicious sauce that is served in a martini glass. It's sushi fusion perfection.\\n\\nEntrees:\\nFor the burger lover: The beef is high-quality and cooked to perfection. My favorite is the Black Truffle Cheese Burger, which I definitely recommend for those of you who enjoy mushrooms. To be honest, you really can't go wrong with any of the burgers on this menu. To bring Japanese inspiration back into your American dish, order a seaweed salad as your side.\\n\\nFor the sushi lover:\\nOnce again, Cowfish delivers a high-quality product. I could tell the fish was fresh. I'll be honest, their sushi wasn't my favorite. I'd recommend it only if you like wasabi (I do not). Cowfish spreads wasabi in between the fish and the rice so the sushi comes prepared with the spicy paste already on it. I will say that, although it wasn't my favorite, I had a few friends who like wasabi try the sushi and they raved about it. So, if you're a wasabi lover, nom down on their sushi to your little heart's desire.\\n\\nFor the lover of both land and sea: Burgushi. Yes, you read that right. You can actually order meals at Cowfish that marries burger and sushi. It may sound odd. But if you're feeling adventurous, I recommend giving one of these dishes a try. You'll be surprised at how something so odd can taste so amazing.\\n\\nAdult Beverages:\\nCowfish has a decent selection of wines and beers. But their specialty cocktails are what shine. The Ruby Panther is my favorite. It's a fruity vodka-based beverage that is very refreshing. My boyfriend, who loves a good Old Fashioned, is especially a fan of Cowfish's Rum Old Fashioned, which adds a unique spin on the classic beverage by using rum as the base instead of bourbon. And for you gin drinkers, I had a friend order the Bees Knees and he really enjoyed it, so I can also vouch for the quality of that concoction.\\n\\nDessert:\\nOh, you actually thought you'd have room for dessert? That's cute. :)\\n\\nBottom line, if you have any love for sushi or burgers you have to try out Cowfish. It has become my new favorite place at CityWalk. And as an Orlando native who generally avoids the touristy areas of CityWalk and Disney Springs, I can tell you I will be out there more often so I can enjoy food from Cowfish. 100% worth the trouble."},{"name":"Cosmic Ray's Starlight Caf√©","address":"1180 Seven Seas Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3","text":"Okay, okay... not the best food, but still good.

It just doesn't work for you.\\n\\nI'm sure RT is very authentic and the people who like Ramen will absolutely love this place, but nothing worked for me at all. Leaving my food practically untouched was really an embarrassment for me and I feel awful about it. \\n\\nI had the Tonkotsu Original (super boney flavor, to me it tasted like liquid dog food) \\nKOROKKAAAYYY (a hash brown with pork, I would have liked it better without the pork.)\\nSalad. Actually the salad was very good. Crisp and sharp lots of flavor. \\nI also tried the Tsukemen and Gyoza. I definitely liked Tsukemen more than the Tonkotsu.

The chicken was moist and flavorful,roast beef fork tender and potatoes cooked well. For me the green beans were a little too al dente. The dessert was the only down side to the meal with the cake obviously frozen and mushy. I will upgrade the dessert next time.  I enjoyed a beer with my meal but they have a full bar. \\nThe show was interactive and it looked like all the kids enjoyed themselves helping the pirates. The acrobatic performances and sword fights were impressive and the length of show was perfect.

There were light up swords displayed and the child next to us during the show had one from a previous trip so my friend wanted one for her grandson but was told they COULD not sell her one???

Trying to get rid of the taste of raw potato, I ordered mochi for dessert and was disappointed by the amount of stuff on the plate. There was so much whipped cream and so much chocolate you could barely see the mochi. The phrase, less is more, really is true. They took away from the dish by doing too much to it.

The chicken and waffles is AMAZING.  I highly recommend taking the chicken off the top, putting some syrup on the waffle (not too much so it gets too soggy tho), put the chicken back, put on some of that unlabeled hot sauce, layer on the praline bacon and then dig in.  Crispy, peppery, spicy, nutty, sweet - you get it ALL in one amazing bite!!! The chicken itself is tender and the batter was a little bit too peppery for the 2 yr old.\\n\\n2. The Eggs Sardou (poached eggs on artichoke heart on creamed spinach on a toasted English muffin) was a good mix of flavors.  The artichoke really pops with the vinegary but then it gets muted by the creamed spinach.  The egg adds a depth of richness that lingers. The side of grits was pretty good as well.\\n\\n3.  Our Praline bacon was not crispy.  It was still excellent on a flavor scale with the salty bacon and brown sugar/pecan topping. I thought it was coated in the pecan mixture but it's actually layered on.  \\n\\n4. The hot chocolate was really good - nice thick layer of whipped cream.  Not sure why it was served with a straw as it was scalding hot...especially as a small child was drinking it.\\n\\n5.  Got here at 8:40am, 20 minutes before opening at 9am.  There was already a line of maybe 50 people.  The guy at the front had a book, not sure what time he came.  By the time they opened at 9am the line had an additional 50 or so people behind us.  We were the second to last table seated in the first round.\\n\\n6.  The ordering took a while, and we somehow got our food after the people who seated after us got their food.

Well I'm glad we did!\\n\\nFirst of all, food over service all day.  Amusing to find an elite yelp reviewer leaving racist comments because who the f cares if Sushi is made by a Chinese dude.  Complaining about the slippery floors? COME ON!  \\n\\nNow I got that out the way... Let my palate do the talking.\\n\\nHaving a 2 year-old means that we are on a budget and to tell you the truth, we had low expectations because it's rare to find something good on Groupon right?\\n\\nWe arrived at around 7pm and found free street parking right in front of the restaurant.  \\nGiven, it is small place with about 25 seats and it would have been more inviting if they dimmed the lights for dinner (my wife wanted me to write that but I can give a rats-a about the lights because I'm a man and I only care about food).  \\n\\nAs we seat, they offered us a high-chair which we appreciated (I counted at least 3 high-chairs plus a couple of boosters).  Right off the bat, we let them know that we came with Groupon and the server didn't care (which is always a good sign).  She brought us a Groupon menu and we chose the following:\\n\\nMiso Soup: Not a big fan of miso soup so ask my wife about it if you really want to know.\\n\\nShio Ramen: Always try the soup first before touching anything else.  Right away, I could tell by the rich flavor that these guys boiled the broth for at least 8 hours.  I tend to like my noodles firm which I also liked about this dish.  My wife could voucher for me because I'm not a noodle lover but this I appreciated.  Chef being Chinese actually played in favor of this dish because the Cha Shu (pork) had a hint of the Chinese BBQ pork which I love.  Don't worry you probably won't notice it.  4.5/5    \\n\\nSpicy Tuna Tartare: This was pretty EPIC!  Crab meat between two layers of well sauced spicy tuna topped with avocado, chopped scallop and roe.  Looks like an epic sushi mountain.  Very, very good.  5/5\\n\\nTruffle Salmon Carpaccio: Not a big fan of this dish.  Didn't think that the truffle worked too well with the salmon sashimi.  But my wife loved it so... 4/5 (wife)\\n\\nYam Bam Bam: Yam tempura with house-made mayo and roe.  Tasted like it was not pre-battered.  Very fresh, hot, crispy and delicious.  Never had tempura like this before.  My son loved this the most so... 5/5 (son)\\n\\nSakura Roll:  First of all, I hate special rolls that are overly sauced.  Sushi restaurants will do this to hide their crappy rolls with crazy unnecessary colorful sauces.  Well this is roll is definitely on point in terms of using just the right amount of sauce which is the biggest reason why this was roll owns most of its competitors.  However, I do have a problem with the texture of the rice as it was too soft and mushy.  Taste was fine (not too sweet and not too vinegary) but it looked like the chef touched the roll way too many times to make that perfect shape and unfortunately the rice paid the price.  You need to care less about the shape and presentation of the dish and add more air in the rice buddy!  Still this roll deserves at least... 4/5\\n\\nCopped Scallop Nigiri: My wife is a chopped scallop nigiri fanatic and this place by far has it the best.  If you are like my wife, you can visit this place just to have this and nothing else!  This is what nigiri is all about my friends... less rice and more stuff on top!  You won't be disappointed.  5/5\\n\\nToro Sashimi:  I saved the best for last.  This is by far the best toro I've had in Vancouver.  Nicely sliced, good temperature, and very fresh (in my opinion).  My way of checking for its freshness, I saved a piece for my last bite of the meal.  This way I have time to let it rest at room temperature and it should smell just the same as it was brought to the table.  By pinching it, you should also notice it being firm.  EPIC in our opinion.  5/5\\n\\nNote: I don't know if they have more than one Chef nor do I know about their skills but ours was a dude named AJ.  To NO surprise he is also the owner and operator which is distinctly evident in all of his passionate dishes.  Get rid of your Chinese owned sushi restaurant stereotypes because this not all-you-can-eat sushi and this place definitely deserves an applause.   \\n\\nYoo Family gives this place an epic 4.5/5 (i round up) for giving us a breath of fresh air in the sushi department.  \\n\\nGood job guys!"},{"name":"Casa De Las Empanadas","address":"1709 W Oak Ridge Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"3","text":"No doubt it is a pretty good place, but am I blown away by it?

However, my ribs were fatty, so that reduced the amount of edible meat. The outside of the chicken was fairly tasty, but the white meat inside was bland. The beans stood out, as did the collard greens; both were very tasty, with a good spicy, tangy flavor on the beans.
