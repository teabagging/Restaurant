This along with a few other restaurants are located within the Marriott Gaylord Palms hotel.  Each has a limited menu and is way over priced.  You are paying for the fancy decor of the hotel and restaurants, not the food.  \\n\\nThe sides are $11 a piece and are labeled as \\"family\\" style.  They are delivered in mini cast iron skillets which a couple could split but certainly not a family of 4.  I had the Mac & Cheese and the Brussel sprouts with bacon.  The Mac & Cheese was on the dry side and lacked full flavor.  The bread crumbs on top were a nice touch.  Overall editable but disappointing especially for $11.  The sprouts/bacon were also lacking a bit in the full flavor range despite they are also cooked in a cast iron skillet with a vinaigrette sauce.  The sauce was so runny is was more of the soup the rest sat in rather than an addition to the flavor and texture.  The steaks range in the $40-$50 area which I did not order one but other reviewers have stated the steak quality are not worth the price.  I ordered the wedge salad which was around $15 I believe.  You get a (small) 1/4 head of iceberg lettuce with a few bacon bits and few diced tomatoes covered with about a tablespoon of blue cheese dressing.  I could buy a full portions of each ingredient at the store for that price. \\n\\nThe wine list was extensive including an entire page of \\"vertical wines\\" which range into the hundreds of dollars.  Of course the wines are not as expensive as they price them as.  For example, a bottle of La Crema Chardonnay was $79 dollars.  I can buy a bottle at my local grocery store for under $20.  I got a glass of another Chardonnay which was $13 for 5 oz.  A small pour considering most restaurants will serve a 6-7 oz pour for between $7-$12.\\n\\nThe servers were nice but seemed more adept for Chili's or Dick's Last Resort - a guy seriously asked a lady if she was pregnant when she declined to order an adult beverage.  And this is supposed to be a high end steakhouse where the staff are wearing suits - keep in mind it is still in a tourist trap hotel so everything is part of a role.\\n\\nThe ambiance is 5 stars and the cheese tray is the most awesome looking collaboration I've seen in a restaurant (too bad I didn't go that route).  The servers are nice but not fancy restaurant quality and the food is ok but nothing spectacular and certainly not worth the price tag.  From what I gathered all the restaurants in this hotel run at this standard.

They started us off with some soft white bread with a lovely and cool hummus which my friend easily devoured.\\n\\nThe Goat cheese fritter on an oven dried tomato with garden greens in a sweet basil vinaigrette was okay - I liked the contrast of the warm juicy tomato with the salty fried goat cheese.  Even better though was the Carpaccio of roasted portabella mushrooms in a sherry vinaigrette with capers and red onion with roasted red pepper rusks - it came with two slices of bread (presumably) spread with the red pepper rusk (what's rusk?)... a third or even a fourth slice would have been better given the multitude of portabella slices on the plate... yum!  (And I'm not a mushroom-lover!)\\n\\nI guess something went wrong with the kitchen or the service, cause after a significant amount of time, we narrowly escaped being served dessert.  But maybe we should have just grabbed the dessert plates when we had the chance, cause it took a while longer for the dinner entrees to arrive...\\n\\nOther than that though, service was earnest and pleasant.\\n\\nOur entrees of choice were the Grilled 10 oz. top filet steak au jus with seasonal vegetable and potato, and the House made butternut squash ravioli in a sage buerre blanc.  I've never understood why ravioli and fish entrees come in such small portions!  In this case, there were only three large (perhaps 2 inch square? but not particularly thick) ravioli on the plate - although they were butternut-squash sweet inside and al dente outside.  The beef was tender and well seasoned, and were served four decent chunks to the plate, atop a hill of mashed potato, smothered in a brown gravy with mushrooms, with thin slices of carrots and a couple of peapods besides.  Very good sized portion.\\n\\nFor dessert, the Homemade mango & dulce de leche cheesecake was a bit odd in its texture and taste, reminiscent of greek yogurt (thick, rich, and a bit salty)... and while I could see and taste the fresh mango chunks atop the slice, I'm not sure where the dulce de leche description came in... However, the Traditional Spanish Flan was smooth and lovely.\\n\\nThe place was utterly packed... so I'm not even sure why they were offering this special menu, although I'm really glad they did and that I was able to come in to enjoy it!\\n\\nI couldn't find any mention of it on their website, but Tasca has valet parking available for $6 (which is cheap in comparison to the $18 charge I faced recently in the North End!).\\n\\nThe room attempts at romance with dark lighting and fake candlelight at every table, however noise carries and tables are placed rather close together at times, so it isn't the best place for a deeply personal conversation.\\n\\n(added 2/21/09)\\nps - almost forgot, I knew about the $15 Appetite stimulus Menu because Tasca themselves emailed me about it.  Join their mailing list (check out their website - and roll on down to the bottom of the page) and you'll be in on things too.\\n\\n(added 3/5/09 for another visit... doesn't quite rate a whole updated review (except I'll update my three stars to four for the $15 deal of a menu), so here we go!)\\nService went a lot more smoothly this time around, with a better flow of food to the table.  I tried my friend's chicken and corn chowder - not very corny, and I figure the creaminess may be due more to the help of a potato than any actual cream.  It was okay, but I had more fun with my rabbit canelon, especially in finishing up the sauce with help from the bread basket.  My taste of pork chop was very flavorful and tender, but I rather enjoyed the buttery mashed potatoes with the saucy veal and lamb in my dish... although I have to admit I had some trouble telling my meats apart. :(  My flan was great once again, but this pineapple cheesecake was lighter than the mango cheesecake...

I also like the fact their staff seemed to enjoy eating their own food.  I like seeing the staff hanging out during breaks and eating the food.  \\n\\nI also feel compelled to comment because they were cool about giving me a decent sized cup for water that I could refill on my own.

I was hopeful for the Merguez Couscous, but when it came I was really disappointed. Our plate had a messy heap of couscous and sausage links around the outside of the plate. The flavours were ok - but somewhat bland almost like the spices didn't break down and the couscous was too wet. The lamb sausage was the most disappointing, seemed like really poor quality.\\n\\nAll in all, I wouldn't return.

Negative.\\nWhen I dined: Sunday afternoon.\\n\\nDo you like menus that have giant photos of the food? Photos that are so big you can only fit 3 to 5 items on a page? This might be the restaurant for you!\\n\\nMy date chose this restaurant because we were in Richmond and she was craving dandan noodles. Almost everything in the menu had at least one little chili icon beside it, sometimes up to 3 of them. Since I can't handle capsaicin spice, it was a challenge to find something that wasn't scary to me. I also wanted to order a dish that was under $16 (all of the items on the menu had little stickers for prices - they had obviously altered the original menu prices). Also, some items on the menu had prices in Chinese, which I cannot read. The food seemed overly expensive but I managed to find a noodle dish for about ten bucks that had no chili icon and I verbally confirmed with the server was not spicy.\\n\\nWe did not wait long for our food, and it was actually quite tasty. My co-eater (a term of endearment) also enjoyed her spicy noodles. I had very low expectations and was pleasantly surprised. If I enjoyed spicy food I think I would have had a better experience.\\n\\nAs expected, there are no smiles or pleasantness in the service here. Also the server's phone was constantly going off in her pocket. I read a review on another site that the server chased down someone trying to leave because they didn't leave a big enough tip.

Hooray future of planet Earth!\\n\\nBiggest Rave: At no time during our dining experience were was there more than three tables occupied. Apart from the obnoxious phone ringer in the server's pocket it was very peaceful.\\n\\nBiggest Rant: This place is cash only, unless your bill is $60 or more.

The waiter came back and said they ran out of ribs. Really? That's like Burger King running out of whoppers. So he order another dish but was disappointed. I as well. The over all dish had at least 4 servings of bland pasta with a few bland shrimp. The only bright spot were the drinks. They had a delicious strawberry shaker.

That's normal for that time of night I guess. The service was friendly and that was never a problem before. This time, for my fiance's sake, I hoped they had ribs. They did but they disappointed him.

So I yelped the closest beignet place, and it just so happened that √äpicerie was right around the corner.\\n\\nThis review is based on two main things: the beignets and the coffee. \\n\\nIf you're looking to learn more about their other dishes, you probably won't find it from me--the prices for many of the dishes are on the pricier side of what I'd like to pay. \\n\\n√âpicerie is literally what it says it is: a cafe and a grocery store. Translated, it literally means grocery store--so stacked in very aesthetically pleasing ways are chocolates, sauces, coffee, and liqueur, and at the counter is an assortment of cheese. The first time I heard of this place, I thought I would literally be sitting in a dank grocery store, but that wasn't the case. The restaurant is a cute place with a great atmosphere and is perfect for brunch or dinner.\\n\\nI don't have much to say about the service. The waitresses were friendly--nothing more or less. My food and coffee came out pretty quickly, but I didn't order any of the meals that would take a long time.\\n\\nIf you're looking for beignets, I definitely think √âpicerie hits the spot. The beignets aren't written on the menu, but they are printed on the coffee menu near the bar. They serve them all day for $5 a plate, which comes with three huge donuts drowned in powdered sugar. They were about four or five inches and pretty dense and fluffly--a really great combination. I've had my fair share of beignets (coming from a Vietnamese family who loves Cajun food and used to eat/make beignets at home all the time), and I thought these were super tasty! Eat them while they're hot because once they cool down, they lose that perfection. \\n\\nFor the coffee, I thought it was just simply okay. It was on the bitter side, and they only offer sugar/sweetener as their sweetener so don't come in expecting any syrups.  I think it's a great drink to have with the beignets, so if (when) I come back, I would order another cup.\\n\\nThe main lesson from that is--don't come for just a cup of coffee! \\n\\nMy main con: it can get REALLY noisy. The shop is kind of small, and I guess that resonates all the sound. If you're one who likes at least a little quiet to talk, √âpicerie isn't it. I didn't mind the sound too much, but it was pretty noticeable. \\n\\nAnyway, I loved this place! Will definitely be back but most likely for just beignets and coffee. If you come, I really just recommend trying those two things before you attempt the rest of the menu (simply because it's great, and I think, the cheapest on the menu)."},{"name":"Cook Out","address":"403 Moreland Ave SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Oh my goodness I am in love.\\n\\nI was such a FAT WOMAN TODAY\\n2 Burgers\\n2 hot dogs\\nFries\\nMilkshake\\n\\nThe line was long but it was moving.\\nWorkers were outside to direct the cars & help cars back out from the parking spaces.\\n\\nPacked in the INSIDE!!! \\nDrive Cashier was friendly\\n\\nTHEY HAVE TONS OF HELP!\\n\\nI love the place overall\\n\\ndispute having the bubbleguts later LOL TMI!"},{"name":"Zesto","address":"2469 Piedmont Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Very good Icecream\\nFriendly staff\\nInterior needs renovations if you want to take someone on a date."},{"name":"Edamame Sushi & Grill","address":"3946 Morse Crossing","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"This is a stable for me when I am in the Columbus area.

We received two menus, a 3-course set menu for the V-day and an A-LA Carte menu where you can order menu items separately. My husband went with a 3-course menu (Lobster Tail, Beef Tenderloin, Cheesecake trio, Chowder soup) and I got a medium Duck Breast. My waitress was very confused with the concept of an A-LA Carte menu and kept insisting it was instead a three course- set menu. After taking our orders, she came back 5-6 times to explain why I couldn't get the items SHE said I could get, even though I already explained to her that I knew and was okay with ordering without appetizers and dessert. I could tell she was in training/ and was very confused. But it just took so long for her to get the orders in because of the confusion that I have to take a star off. Food was fab except for the Cheesecake Trio- it's just not worth the price, there are three bite size flavours dressed with a few pieces of blueberries. Also, the steak and the duck were overly salty. I was craving for sweet strawberry jam on the side of the duck the entire time, it just would've made the best combo.

It had a nice smokiness to it, and was so creamy and delicious, it definitely warmed my heart a bit.\\nFOr dinner, I ordered the native cod over corn chowder.  A few things I did not like about this dish.  For one, there was tons of bacon in the corn chowder, which was not stated on the menu.  Second, the menu states that the cod is \\"over\\" corn chowder, but forgot to tell me that it's actually swimming in the chowder.  The cod was ok, and cooked fine but the real issue was that the bacon in the chowder gave it an off taste, almost like burnt oil.  I managed to eat it, because I did not want to ruin a perfectly amazing evening in Boston. \\nMy fiancee ordered sea scallops which were awesome.  I feel like I probably did not make the wisest menu selection, and therefore cannot call it a total dissapointment.  I think Stephanies is probably otherwise, a pretty decent place.

The inside decor and setup looks like it should be in a magazine. The outside patio is a great spot as well to hang with a group or sit and talk on a date night.\\n\\nStart with a caprese salad as it is a perfect take on this classic.  Try the scallop carbonara as a lighter pasta option.  The pork belly is a touch fatty with a nice compliment of flavors, but it is unimpressive compared with other options across the city.  Sides are just ok. The polenta is bland, but fine mixed with the other flavors.  The Brussel sprouts are a touch undercooked yet would be tasty with some additional time on the burner.  The flourless torte is a great chocolate desert.  Needless to say, I'm a fan of the start and the finish.\\n\\nAll the cocktails we have had are worth repeating. I cannot remember names, but try a rye or tequila drink.\\n\\nOn our last visit we waited almost 18 minutes before we finally flagged a waiter down to come to our table to get our drink order or tell us about the menu. They were obviously apologetic and ended up comping a desert.\\n\\nMy final comments are regarding food allergies and intolerances.  On our most recent visit we asked the waiter about gluten free items or items that could be made with out gluten. He gave us one item in response to our question and then started to sort through the menu with only two more listed, then saying there is a lot of gluten on the menu.  It was a nice conversation but once we pressed we found there were a ton of gluten free options including most of the pastas and main dishes.  I just assume he was busy because he knew much more as we asked questions.  He failed to even mention pizza as an option although we knew the pizzas were an option based on a previous visit.

When you eat it, it comes out extremely dry.  And despite so much pecan nuts around cheese, probably because it comes out so dry, it really doesn't provide the flavor that goat cheese normally does.

If I had to make a guess as to why, I might cite unpredictable hours or letting the coffee run out and packing up all the cream and sugar two hours before close as having something to do with it.  Of course, it might also have something to do with the fact that calls and emails to the manager about scheduling options and other concerns were frequently ignored, and employees seemed to be helpless to make any changes without consulting said absent management.\\n\\nIn the meantime, we're scrambling to find a new location to replace them.

I thought maybe it was a mistake, so he kindly asked \\"so that price is including tips?\\" And the guy said no. Then we started to break them down.\\n\\nHe took out his cell phone and showed how the prices are broken down and the total should be $16.10 + tax + 15% tips would equal to $19.44. The guy seems to remember prices of the items AFTER tax and said the drinks cost $4.50 after tax. I took out my phone and showed them that a $3.55 drink + 5% tax is $3.72 so how would it be $4.50?!! I don't remember the exact price of the sub they told me, but it definitely did NOT reflect the menu price. The guy who was charging us seemed a bit flustered so another server guy came over and we explained the situation to him.

Newsfeed cafe obviously gets its name from the fact that it is right next to the WGBH (local NPR affiliate) radio booth and both are housed in the new and improved and renovated and luxurious Boston Public Library building. How many other coffee shops do you know in Boston that have this distinction? None, right? Which makes this one, what? Unique, exactly! So, if you're tired after having checked out your free CD's and free DVD's and free books (don't get me started on what a treasure our beloved Boston Public Library is and how lucky we are to have it), and want to have a good cup of coffee, while looking out onto one of the most central streets in Boston (Boylston Street), with its beautiful, upscale, professional, pedestrian traffic, then this is the place to be! You know what else is unique about this place? The music! Where else do you hear beautiful classical music at a coffee place or any other place in Boston, for that matter? Only at the Harvard COOP, as far as I can recall. I' m not sure if you can actually have your coffee while a show is being broadcast literally a few feet from you, I'll have to look into that, but a small plastic note on the table I'm sitting at, that politely requests that customers not make noise with their chairs and silence their cell phones during a radio broadcast, would point towards a positive answer . The environment is extraordinarily quiet, the quietest of quiet, which of course you'd expect from a library crowd, right? Now, the menu; there seems to be a wide selection of pastries and beverages and whatnot and all I want, naturally is a hot beverage and my first instinct is to go for something different, this being such a different experience and everything - so I go for a small hot tea; to my surprise and dismay, there is no small size for the tea, because apparently they come prepackaged or something - and I find the available size (large)  rather overpriced, in the range of $3+. The funny thing is that the lady waiting in line right after me takes it upon herself to repeat the tea situation to no one in particular, certainly not me, maybe to herself; she reminds me of the log lady from 'Twin Peaks'. So anyway, I go for my familiar small coffee, which tastes fine and everything, (maybe it's a little strong) I think is in the range of $2, and I make up for my slight dismay over the tea debacle with an extra helping of cream and Splenda (extra points for the full jug of cream, guys!). Also, the server is cute, am I allowed to say that on Yelp? Well, I guess I just did! So, despite my hot tea scandal, I will still give this place 5 stars, because the overall experience is so unique and also because probably something of my long-standing love for the BPL apparently rubs off on everything associated with it. I loved the BPL when it was a dump and I love it now that it's renovated because I consider all the value I've gotten from it for free (sans some late fees) over the years.

To me patatas bravas should be crispy on the outside and soft on the inside- these more resembled home fries that had been sitting on the plate for a little too long, the crispy was gone. They try to cover this with a tasty sauce, but it doesn't work. The flavors are good, the presentation is poor. The Albondigas were good, not special. The best dish we had was the Setas al jerez- a very rich creamy mushroom sauce with crispy bread slices. The tuna dish was very refreshing, not at all fishy- I would order it again but I've still had much better.\\nThe hostess was pretty lame- she sat us right next to the kitchen door when there were many open tables closer to the walls and much more pleasant to eat at- we asked to be moved, she didn't seem like the sharpest tool in the shed.

It also played finishing school to several of Austin's finest sushi chefs (Tyson Cole, e.g.). \\n\\nIn the roaring '90's, I did my part to help the high tech boom and dropped a lot of coin on a lot of fish here. It was notoriously busy. The wait could be two, sometimes three hours. Which was ok because they also had a great selection of sake. \\n\\nI have eaten, although not always liked, every kind of raw fish imaginable.\\n\\nTime passed, and sushi joints proliferated. There is cheap sushi, hip sushi, expensive sushi, sushi to-go at the grocery, etc. Sushi got caught in the tornado of market adoption and went mainstream. \\n\\nI hadn't been to Musashino since Smoky was head chef and Tyson was next in line. And that, my friends, is a very long time ago.\\n\\nSo I was excited when a work colleague suggested Musashino for lunch. I hadn't even realized they were open for lunch!\\n\\nI got their Sushi lunch combo, which came with a small salad, miso, three pieces of sushi (maguro, sake, hamachi), and a California roll for $12.95. A pretty good deal. \\n\\nThe miso was...unique...compared to others I've had. It had a vaguely smokey, almost toasted flavor. Not bad, just...odd. Salad had a nice, semi-spicy ginger-y dressing, which was the most interesting thing about it. California roll was rolled in tempura flakes, which was a nice change from the usual sesame seeds or masago. And the sushi was divine.\\n\\nMy friend had a rainbow roll, which looked amazing. And a large bowl of some kind of ramen. She was expecting something smaller, and ended up taking the majority of it home in two take-out containers. (It was that big.) She declared it \\"ok,\\" and pointed out the half boiled egg that looked a little gray. Probably due to the broth, but presentation is so key to a sushi place that it needs to extend to all dishes. \\n\\nSo, the rating I am giving is for my experience alone. (I would guess she would give it three stars.)\\n\\nBut I have to confess: I miss the Musashino from the '90's. I miss Smokey. And Tyson. And sitting up at the bar, chatting with the chefs and sampling new and strange things I've never had. \\n\\nHip doesn't have to be new.

We were therefore extremely excited about Sweet Cheeks' opening, and we were not disappointed!\\n\\nSweet Cheeks offers family style seating where you sit at a large table next to people you may/may not know.  The decor is as trendy as a BBQ restaurant can be with wood piles, large TV screens, and open kitchen.  Drinks are served in mason jars; you eat on metal trays covered with butcher paper (which will make you think of upscale TV dinner); and, biscuits are brought to you in a paint can.  This makes for a very fun and lively atmosphere.\\n\\nFor only being open a week, our server knew the menu extremely well.  She was informative and attentive without being overbearing.\\n.\\nMeat is available on 2-meat ($24) and 3-meat ($28) trays with two sides, as sandwiches ($10) on Texas toast with one side, and by the pound.  We decided to split the 3-meat tray (pulled chicken, pulled pork, and brisket with a side of broccoli and potato salad).  We also ordered a few ribs, hush puppies, and biscuits.\\n\\nThe hush puppies were average.  The BBQ was very good (especially the ribs), but the fat on the brisket should have been better trimmed. The biscuits were fantastic, but I wish they were served with honey only rather than the honey butter.  Because the biscuits are already extremely buttery and moist, adding more butter was an overkill.  The potato salad was also very good, and the side of broccoli was amazing.  Covered with cheese and cracker crumbs, the broccoli really was a treat.\\n\\nThe three table sauces for the BBQ were also extremely good, especially the \\"911\\" sauce.  It isn't as spicy as promised, but it does have all the peppery fruitiness of habanero.\\n\\nI would have given Sweet Cheeks a five star rating if it wasn't for the price.  When we ordered the $28 3-meat tray, we were expecting to get a lot of food.  Instead, we really only got enough food for one person if we hadn't ordered the hush puppies and biscuits.  For $28, I would just expect to get more than one piece of brisket and small scoops of pulled chicken and pork.\\n\\nAll in all, I am very glad Boston finally has good BBQ!

I must admit I was a bit taken aback on the decor.  For some reason I expected a high end steakhouse, but instead the decor reminded me up an upscale diner.  It looks a bit outdated, but that's no surprise given that it's in the older wing.  Nevertheless, it was still clean overall.  The acoustics weren't ideal, but we worked through our dinner just fine.  \\n\\nThis review is difficult for me to rate because our service was 5 stars, especially our server.  She was fantastic.  I was going to just order a pasta dish and my husband a steak, but she mentioned that they are known for their steaks so I decided to give the filet a twirl.  My husband ordered the skirt steak, we split a baked potato and creamed corn.  Both sides were enormous and can be shared.  Baked potato is a baked potato so nothing to complain about there.  I liked the creamed corn, but my husband wasn't a fan of the way it was seasoned.  We also ordered a small cup of minestrone and it was huge!  Pretty tasty too.  Now for the hard part, the steaks...\\n\\nMy husband ordered his medium and I ordered my filet medium rare.  His came out more rare than mine so the server took it back to the kitchen.  Really really sweet and we didn't want to make a fuss, but she insisted.  So as we're digging in, I notice that my filet is awfully dry for a filet.  When trying one another's steaks, we both agreed that my dish was disappointing and way too dry.  We also ordered the horseradish and house steak sauce which is seriously just BBQ sauce.  I'd ask for A1 and skip this $3 sauce.  \\n\\nSo overall, as much as the service and our server rocked, their focal point really disappointed.  The steaks were just not good.

It definitely didn't have the mouth feel or unctuousness of a real tonkotsu broth that is boiled with bones for hours.  The soft-boiled egg was decent, although a bit too sweet.  The pork itself was a weird shade of light brown and sort of off-putting.

Yes, I, the self-proclaimed cuisine experimentalist, will overlook all of those fancy, foreign pastries in favor of the divinity that is the croissant. It is the best rich, buttery, crescent-shaped roll of leavened dough that you will ever taste, or in my case, inhale.\\n\\nLuckily, no offense is taken by the clair Caf, Normandy Apple Toast, Almond Friand, Gteau au Chocolat, Champignon Frittata Croissant, Raspberry Valaine, or any of the other colorful specialties on display - they get plenty of action as well.\\n\\nOnce you get your salivation glands under control, you will notice the bakery's dcor makes you feel as though you are among the authentic charms of provincial France. The fantastic use of natural light and thick wooden floors and tables give the entire boulangerie a rustic glow. The entire kitchen is open, and you can watch as the bakers roll out the bread for the clay firebrick bread oven.\\n\\nThe overall experience of the NW Thurman location is charming - bikers stop in after their ride in Forrest Park, and entire families congregate on the community table for a Saturday brunch.

I was very disappointed and after two bites I spoke to a manager because only a fool would pay that price for soup that comes free with sushi. \\n\\nThe manager was not apologetic, but he did clear the soup and have it extracted from my bill. When I mentioned that I was disappointed that the dish I originally wanted couldn't be made without bacon the manager's excuse was that they pre make the quesadillas to save time.

I got the eggplant Parmesan half sandwich, and honestly it tasted awful - maybe freezer burnt, and definitely not fresh. I really struggled to eat it and ended up throwing most of it out. I also got the avocado veggie half sandwich, and nearly all of the avocado was browning inside - I had asked the girl beforehand if they prepare the avocado the same day, and she said it is a spread so I figured it would be ok but it really did not look fresh so I threw out the avocado. Finally, they need to have one person consistently at the register so you are not waiting to pay, and also move the cream/sugar station for customizing your coffee to a larger area because as it stands only one person can use it at a time which is ridiculous given that this is in a super busy area. \\n\\nOverall though I do like how many options this place has and the pricing - so please fix the above issues asap."},{"name":"Megabite New West","address":"527 6th St","city":"New Westminster","stars":"2","text":"I love mega pizza.

Great service, friendly and check on you pretty often which is great since it is an ayce style. \\n\\nThe atmosphere: our first time here we were surprised they had some people singing. It wasn't a live band or anything but karaoke so that was a little different. We were sat in one of the very nicely sized large kbbq booths near the back though so it was fine. Second time sat in the same place, I like how big the tables are. \\n\\nThe food: my friends agree their bulgugi is really good! Not overly sweet or marinated like some places can make them.

Finally, they acknowledged my presence and I told them how many was in my party. I had to repeat myself a few times because...well...they were busy, or so it seemed. I guess someone went to get my table ready. I eventually sat down and waited because again, there was no clear communication as to what was going on. \\n\\nOk, now my party has been seated. After being seated, a waiter came by and placed a basket of bread on our table but didn't introduce himself or say anything at all. Two of my guests went to the bathroom but promptly came back. Drink orders had not been taken yet. Finally, after several minutes without anyone coming back to the table, I stopped the person who put the bread on the table and asked if he knew who our waiter was. Quite curtly he said, \\"It's me. I'm the one who set up your table, put the glasses of water down and gave you your bread\\". How should I know that? He didn't introduce himself nor did the hostess say anything when she seated us. Irritated at his comment, we proceeded to place our drink order. By the way,  the water glass had old lipstick marks on it. He brought a fresh glass of water after I pointed it out.\\n\\nDinner was fine. We chose family style dining since there were 5 of us. The food was fair. The dessert was tasty. The waiter was attentive, enough but there was still an edge about him that made me uncomfortable.\\n\\nWhen we were ready to checkout, I noticed a discrepancy with the family dining rate on the bill vs what I saw on the menu. When I brought it to the waiter's attention he said,  there's nothing I can do about that, you must've had an old menu. Now, at this point,  I'm ready to really go off on this person but,  cooler heads prevailed. I had him double check his menus because more than one of us saw a different price than what was listed on the bill. He said,  \\"You couldn't all have possibly had an old menu\\". Yes...he...did...say...that...to...me! Needless to say, they adjusted the price but the manager never came over to say anything to us or to apologize for any inconvenience. The waiter said, after they looked through the menus, they did notice that there were several that were wrong and they were being discarded immediately.\\n\\nDid I mention that this waiter spilled a glass of water...twice? In one area where the water was spilled, he never placed anything on the floor to clean it up. Someone could've slipped and fallen. I digress.\\n\\nThe food was descent, not great.

They had a coke free style machine which is fun for a sit down restaurant. I was highly impressed with the children's menu. My daughter had an appetizer of carrots & celery with ranch, 3 ribs, a simply gogurt, mashed sweet potatoes and an apple salad they make, I loved the smaller portions and more of a variety. All for $6. Most places serve kids kraft mac n cheese and fry's for $5 and I have to beg for veggies. \\n\\nMy husband ordered a rack of ribs, and I ordered the filet medallions medium with corn and wild rice. I thought the corn on the cob may be grilled and delicious based on the waiters recommendation. He made everything sound delish but when it came out the corn was just corn when I finally got it. I originally had broccoli and my husband ordered cole slaw and got mashed potatos. The grilled veggies looked like frozen veggies steamed. Honestly the food looked pretty sad. Nothing more than something I'd get at a family restaurant. My husband's ribs were tough and my mini filets were cold and cooked medium rare. They had amazing flavor and the rice was just rice. The manager did come over and replace my husbands and daughters ribs and they came out great after that. He was very friendly. The onion loaf was great. Our waiter was on top of it but not overly friendly. I was disappointed with the price point. It still reminded me of a good family style restaurant and I think they could come down a few dollars on some of their items. $21 for cold filet medallions just seems like a lot.

She stated she has been with the company for over 15 years.  My wife and I started with chicken wings.  They did not disappoint.  They came out hot and fresh and had a great taste and a spicy kick.  They are a must.  My wife ordered the full rack of baby back ribs.  The ribs were saucy, tender and had a great flavor.  The arrived hot and were very fresh and moist.  I ordered the small plates.  I had the Pork-Strami ribs with the Agave Mustard Sauce.  I was hesitant at ordering this dish but took a chance based on what our server had told us.

It was great! and the portion size was huge. It was a bit pricey (extra large size for 16.95) but when you factor in the portion size it's an above average value for the quality of the pasta. The menu IS huge and I am honestly not sure I'd order anything but pasta here, but the pasta was worth it.\\n\\nService: here is where it gets tricky. the service was good. I was there by myself and mainly wanted to eat and listen to music. the server left me alone until I was done immediately took care of packing up my meal. That was the good.\\n\\nThe bad - first charging $1 for bread that I didn't order is just tacky, but it was tasty and I did eat it - fair enough. Second, I had a GroupOn. I advised them of this up front as required. The GroupOn was for $15 and my bill came out to about $25 after tax and tip.  I was charged $15 and change. I called them on this after paying with my credit card and they gave me $5 in cash back claiming they \\"should have used a calculator\\".\\n\\nI have a REALLY hard time believing any server or business owner gets $25 - $15 wrong. Furthermore, other people have reported having issues using their GroupOn here. I would like to give them the benefit of the doubt and I could well be wrong about this, but my gut was definitely screaming \\"just tried to scam me and almost got away with it\\".\\n\\nOverall: I really liked the food, portion size was good, value was above average and I don't mind the outdoor patio experience. I also live a half block away and thought I'd found my new regular pasta place.

The Peking Duck duck was served with steamed buns rather than pancakes, we liked the bao bao so that was fine. The skin was crispy and the meat was good. Seemed like a nice leg on the duck that we got. The odd thing was the scallions were slit on the ends instead of sliced into strips so you could easily put on your servings. The Beef Chow Foon was a solid, tasty dish. Noodles done well and the beef in the dish was good. The String Bean with Beef was excellent.

I guess I'll just dive right in and start describing everything that is wonderful about this random Italian restaurant.\\n\\nLocated in the Bethel Centre at Godown & Bethel Roads, Morone's is truly a hidden treasure.  In the same centre there is a Cosi, BW3, a couple bars, and a Panda Inn.  Way in the back nestled between a hockey store and another bar is this delicious treat.  There are three areas at the end of a long foyer, the dining room, another dining room (which I believe is reserved for parties) and the back area for picking up pizzas (where the bar is also located).  The whole place smells delectable, and as the server takes you to the table your brain is already contemplating what kind of Italian meal you'll be feasting upon today.\\n\\nThe menu is simple, featuring pasta, pizza, sandwiches, salads, and dinners.  There are a few appetizers, desserts, and drinks.  Very easy to read, very easy to choose from.  They even have an a la carte section for people like my mother who like to order chicken fingers, two meatballs, and a side salad.  My favorite dish, if I had to pick, would be the lasagna.  I am a HUGE lasagna fan, so I am very picky, and I could literally eat Morone's lasagna three times a week.  It is tall, filled with cheese and meat sauce, but not too saucy and runny - it stays in \\"loaf\\" form and that is what I love.\\n \\nThe one thing I dislike about Morone's is the service.  Most of the servers are teenagers, and while I was a teenager working in foodservice once, I can only excuse so much.  They tend to only check on you once or twice, and if you ask for something, such as more butter or bread or whatever, more often than not you have to flag down someone else to remind your server of the request.  The most annoying thing to me, having also been a server, is an empty cup.  This is a problem at Morone's as well.  On a trip to the restroom I think I figured out the cause of this neglect - in the back, where the bar is, I came across four servers just hanging out, talking, waiting around for who knows what.  One of them was my server, and I had been out of pop for at least ten minutes.  Perhaps they should hang out in the server station adjacent to the dining room, where at least they can keep an eye on the tables... Just a thought!\\n\\nAll in all, Morone's is a great place to go any night of the week if you are hungry for good, comforting, stick-to-your-ribs Italian fare.  It's good for families, dates, business lunch (they have a buffet during the week), or any other reason to go out!\\n\\n\\nOverall Scores: (1-5, 1 being lowest, 5 highest)            \\nCleanliness: 5\\nValue: 5\\nAccessibility: 5\\nFriendliness: 3\\nMenu: 5"},{"name":"Stephanie's On Newbury","address":"190 Newbury St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"I had family in town visiting and wanted to go some place nice for brunch.  One friend recommended Stephanie's and it looked nice, so I made a reservation.  This meal, however, was a disater.  We had a reservation for 12 but we were never seated until 12:45.  Everytime I went up to ask when our table would be ready they said it would only be another minute because they were resetting the table.  They never appologized for the wait or explained why we had to wait.  When we were finally seated, almost half the tables in the restaurant were empty.\\n\\nOur waitress was friendly and took our orders.  While we were waiting for our food, someone came around and took the syrup and sugars off the table and then set them up for lunch.  I found this extrememly rude since we were still there and needed both the syrup and the sugar.  \\n\\nWe waited an unusual long time for the food to come out (especially given how empty the restaurant was).  Finally, 3 of the 6 plates came out.  We were told the rest would be out shortly.  We waited about 5 minutes and then 2 more plates were brought out.  It was another 5 minute wait until all of the food came out.  The manager came over to appologize and tried to say that the kitchen got confused over some of the allergies.  However, the person waiting for the plate had no allergies.  When we told the manager this, he seemed confused and walked away.  \\n\\nTwo members of the party have very serious allergies, so it took some time explaining what the problem was and she had to check with the kitchen.  Despite all this time, they still messed up one of the orders.  When my friend received her meal, she questioned the dressing that they had put on the salad.  Two waiters said that they thought it was fine and told her that she was wrong.  She, however, insisted that they check with the kitchen.  She was ultimately right and was allergic to the dressing that they put on her salad.\\n\\nBy the time I was eatting it was an hour and a half after our reservation.  The food was decent.  I had ordered chocolate chip pancakes.  But the pancakes that I get at the diner near my apartment are a million times better and about half the cost.

My first impression upon entering the building was that it seemed like the Varsity of sushi (for those of you that don't know, the Varsity is a famous cafeteria style hot dog place in downtown Atlanta).  It just didn't have the typical ambiance a sushi place has.\\n\\nWe had come here because we had a friend in the group who had been to the Midtown location once before and said it was a blast, packed, whole place doing sake bombs, etc.  At the Buckhead location I think we were the first ones there to do a sake bomb.\\n\\nThe service was ok, it wasn't amazing.  It took a while for the waiter to get us drinks, take our orders, etc.  Once we did order I thought the food came out pretty fast.  The menu is pretty overwhelming with all kinds of different rolls, lots of them seeming to have strange ingredients I would never think to put in a sushi roll (oysters???).  We ordered four rolls which were pretty tasty.  Two of them were HUGE, needing 3-4 bites to finish, whereas I typically like smaller rolls that you eat in one bite.\\n\\nAll in all I would say this is an okay sushi place.  If you had a really large group and were celebrating a birthday it might be fun to come here and sit at one of the large tall tables to do sake bombs, but if you are just looking for some yummy sushi in a quieter, non cafeteria feeling place then I would not come here."},{"name":"Yakuza","address":"5411 NE 30th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Worst service ever.

None of it was. Bummer. \\n\\nMy mom's chicken and waffles were excellent, though!

It's simple, if you are going to  charge a premium price, the food should be of premium quality.  \\n\\nFor instance, if it costs $10 for basically 4 table spoons of \\"ehh\\" tasting spreads and a pita, please don't charge another $3 for pita.  If you do, at least have your servers let the patron know they are going to get charged.  You are in Disney, for goodness sake, and kids love bread----give a Dad a break.\\n\\nFurther, if you are going to charge $26.99 for a lamb shank, it should not taste like a salt lick.  Also, the side, singular, should be more substantial than something I could whip up with about a minute of prep time.  Cubing potatoes and throwing some salt on 'em and popping them in the oven, just doesn't seem to cut it. \\n\\nThere a lot of celebrity chefs out there opening up their restaurants with expectations that their name will add a premium .

I had great memory of the latter growing up going to there.  But ever since they sold the business to someone else, I've not been able to find that style of cooking (many Cantonese restaurants in town are really influenced by HK style cooking, Canton Cook was more traditional Cantonese in some ways).\\n\\nSo when my parents told me the brother open up a new joint, I had to try.  And I was not disappointed!  Their garlic honey pork chop is one of a kind and the taste was still the same after 10+ years.  Their Peking duck, though it's not Cantonese dish, uses wraps instead of buns so it's more tasty than the other places (even beats my long time favorite Golden House).  And everything else we've ordered (egg with shrimp, chinese brocoli, etc.) came with lots of wok hei.  It's definitely an ideal Cantonese restaurant.\\n\\nThis restaurant is located in a strip mall in the suburb so parking was not a problem.

I rarely eat steak after having been vegan for several years due to medical necessity. I found I actually grew to like vegan foods, but did miss a steak once a year or so. Then medical circumstances changed, and docs told me to eat meat again, including steak. Now, just because I'm not a huge steak fan doesn't mean I don't know a damned good piece of meat when it lands in front of me. I grew up in my dad's house, after all, and that man is the master of the grill; he can season, marinate and grill the best meat you have ever had. High-end steakhouses can only hope to match the mouth-watering tender flavor of my dad's whiskey pepper steaks. By the time I was twelve, my Dad had me trained to know cut, cook and marbling, flavor pairings, and even smoke types. WE lived gourmet meat in that house. So the other night my friend felt like a steak and introduced me to Frank's, apparently a staple in the area. I\\"m a California girl; I like open, airy concept restaurants, so the decor in here lost me at hello: dark, dank, smells and looks old. Not nice old, either. But I can forgive dark and dank for a good piece of meat if I have to. Not... so much. I ordered the club special, which turned out to be less than special. I ordered medium rare and got steak that I could barely swallow and was charred black in places. If I'm going to indulge in a steak, at least let it be an exceptional one, and per my friend's reviews, I thought that's what I'd get.  My friend's pepsi was seltzer water with no flavoring, my baked potato only came with a tub of sour cream and no choice of other toppings. My Caesar salad had huge pieces of lettuce and my apple crisp was... not. Gooey mush on top of over-baked apple mush topped with crunchy bits of burnt bitter brown sugar does not an apple crisp make. The service was good, but everything else let me down after my friend's raving. I felt like I'd walked into Denny's-gone-steakhouse, honestly.

Their menu is inventive, featuring such things as a crawfish avocado salad or peanut soup, and they serve a nice variety of breakfast, lunch and dinner fare.  Prices are on the higher end (aforementioned crawfish salad will run you about $10 after tax), but the food is high quality and tasty.  And I dig the atmosphere at this location - very cozy and funky and Austin-ish - and the fact that you can sit outside if it's nice out is a plus (although doing so means you run the risk of sitting next to somebody who's smoking, which cuts into my dining experience).

We both live in the area and were excited to try a new local spot. My friend arrived first and was given the option of indoor or outdoor seating. There was plenty of tables available for both, without having made reservations. She chose inside because it was a 90+ degree day. I'm glad we stayed inside because I felt cool and comfortable during our entire meal.\\n\\nWe started with drinks, and I was so excited to see fros√© on the menu, I knew I had to give it a try. I had such high hopes when my drink came out in a stemless wine glass, with a flower and fun straw - it looked so pretty. However, I was immediately disappointed upon my first sip. The drink didn't have the smooth consistency of a slushee, but it was watery, with chunks of ice beads in it. It wasn't the enjoyable, refreshing drink I had hoped for and I ended up sipping it slowly throughout my meal, not because I liked it, but only because I knew I had to pay for it. \\n\\nFor food, we ordered the guacamole to share and I ordered the kale and farro salad for myself. The guacamole came with too many chips and just a small bowl of guac. The guac didn't have enough salt and lime for my liking. The salad was good, but definitely not what I was expecting either. The portion was large, which was great, but instead of kale, it came with mixed greens. Also, the salad barely had any farro in it - maybe one tablespoon, if that. At first I thought they had forgotten the farro and it was only upon close inspection that I saw a few scattered grains. The menu tag was deceiving, with the two main ingredients advertised not even being key players in the salad. I will say, however, the salad was perfectly dressed and there was plenty of feta and olives. \\n\\nThe 3 stars goes to the pleasant atmosphere and surprisingly good service. Our waitress was perfectly attentive. \\n\\nThere is no parking lot, but free street parking is available (you might have to park a little further down Dorchester Ave. and walk a little, which is what I did).  \\n\\nThe restaurant was a great spot to catch up with a friend, although I don't think I'll be running back anytime soon.

Definitely a hole in the wall kind of place...I was actually in the parking lot and couldn't find the restaurant. It wasn't until I almost drove away that I saw it tucked away in a corner of the strip with the name printed on the door (no other signage). So happy I found it!\\n\\nThe restaurant is quaint and definitely reminiscent of an authentic Japanese ramen house. We got there only a few minutes after open and the place was already half full. The staff was friendly and the service was fine, nothing to tip the scales either way.\\n\\nWe started our meal with an order of Konnyaku (yam cake), The server warned us when we ordered that it was not like what we were thinking (she said not like potatoes). We went ahead anyway because, you know, when in Rome...Well I wish we would have listened as she must have known we wouldn't like it. Konnyaku is not yam at all (by the American definition). It was a grey, firm gelatin with no distinctive flavor. I'm not at all a picky person, nor am I grossed out by textures generally, but I found this dish pretty bad. I remember this type of texture being much more common in Japan than the US though, so it must be popular elsewhere. While this appetizer was a complete flop for us, it is the only complaint I have about the meal.\\n\\nI took the advice of the many before me and ordered the house ramen (pork belly) for my meal. This was definitely the best ramen I've had since I went to Japan 3 years ago. I have to say that after the konnyaku I was a bit nervous about the pork belly, which others have mentioned has an unpleasing texture due to the fat. I had never tried pork belly before tonight, but let me tell you: this was the most flavorful piece of meat that I have ever eaten in my entire life. The whole thing disintegrates in your mouth, and while I am generally not one at all for fatty meats it really didn't bother me with this. The pork bone broth was absolutely delicious and the whole dish just worked so well. Definitely my new spot for ramen and in contention for best soup place with Luc Lac in downtown Portland.\\n\\nOverall I thought this was a great place. Maybe if I had stuck with gyoza for my appetizer it would have approached 5 stars. As it is, I consider it a must go if you are looking for a good bowl of ramen."},{"name":"Watershed on Peachtree","address":"1820 Peachtree Rd NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Had my recent birthday dinner here with a close group of friends.

We first ordered a bottle of white and then a bottle of $75 red with the entrees. She poured the red into the same glass, with some white remaining, into my wife's glass. My wife immediately told her that there was still wine in there but she just apologized. No effort was made to replace the glass at all! At this level of service she should have known to bring different glasses for the red. Second, she continually reached across me with her left arm, essentially back handing me, to serve my wife her food, drink etc. Once again I can expect this at Applebees but not at here. \\n\\nSeveral dishes were lacking correct seasoning.

Their antipasto is also good and well made and makes for multiple meals.  I have reports that the mozarella sticks are fine as well.\\n\\nOn to the wings.  Yes, I know I am a fanitic so take this with a grain of salt.  I am probably the only Boston Yelper to consistently comment on the wings at non wings places.  But it matters.  To me, at least.  Finding their wings on the menu wasn't that easy (we went through Foodler.)  They were labeled 'Chicken Wings' (as opposed to Buffalo Wings) so I specified that they come 'hot and sauce, please' as I do when not given specific options.  The wings arrived and they were, in fact, saucy, but they were not hot.  They were medium at best.  And more importantly, THEY WERE WING DINGS!  Wing Dings /= Chicken Wings.  Wing Dings are battered (breaded) chicken wings.  In many places (including the late great La Palmoma Pizza of Alden, NY, where I had my first job....), they serve both, so they specify 'Buffalo Wings or Wing Dings?'.  If you do not specify on your menu that you are serving Wing Dings, I'll assume these are just plain fried Buffalo wings.  It's a pet peeve of mine.\\n\\nAnyway, the Wing Dings that they sell were fine - they were cooked right and there was a good quantity.  I know 'hot' is subjective, so I won't really ding them on that.  But to sell Wing Dings and not tell the customer, that's just not right in my wing-addled mind! :-)\\n\\nWill definitely be ordering from them soon despite anything I say about the wings."},{"name":"Beijing Noodle House","address":"6451 Buswell Street, Suite 190","city":"Richmond","stars":"3.5","text":"Stopped by on a crisp afternoon hoping for some noodle goodness.

The hamburgers \\"rou mo\\" came out as a minced pork stir fry mixed with vegetables, sandwiched in a thin chewy bun split in half.  I thought it was delicious.  Their table chili oil is smoky and is a perfect accompaniment to this dish.  The other condiments FYI are black vinegar and soy sauce.  The noodles came out quite similar to Lanzhou-style noodles, with cilantro and pine nuts (I think) as garnish.

We ordered the yummy crunch, caterpillar, and another roll I can't recall.  The yummy crunch is good, the only criticism I have is that the roll is big that it's tough to eat cleanly.  You have pinko all over your mouth with soy sauce dripping down your chin and you leave a battered tempura tail left in the roll? It should really be removed. I love eel and avocados so the caterpillar roll was a winner for me.  I think Sinju can do a better job in making their sushi rice.  I don't think they put enough rice vinegar into it.  I love my sushi rice with some vinegar taste to it, and I really didn't get too much of that in the rolls.  Anyway, we enjoyed our lunch.  It's a bit expensive.

Saw the review and decide to try this place out.  The environment was great and feel nice they give you a warm towel to wipe up your hand.  However, the sushi/sashimi didn't really get it there.  I ordered a boat for two that included varies of sashimi and nigiri with a \\"lover roll\\" which is basically krabmeat mixed with sauce inside top with tuna and supposedly tempura flakes and scallops on top it. (I just realize the one I got didn't came with it. Lol). First of all, the roll was way too salty.  Not sure if they try to preserved it because there too many amount left or just a badly seasoned.  Nigiri was quite good except there no wasabi inside at all. But no surprise there.   Next most importantly I felt that gave this place a low score was the sashimi.  The knife work is very inconsistent. Some of the piece are way too thick and short.  What make it worst was that the fish was either not stored properly or not fresh.  The sashimi were too watery.  When u bite upon it. There too many water came out and totally ruin the texture.  I do like the miso soup tho, if anyone ever visit.  As for customer experience of server.  The guy that served us was nice and trying to do the job which I appreciate.   Although he seem to be new and lack of experience.  Once in a while, he seem lost.  For example,  take him three visit to get the drink we wanted to order.  He didn't really follow up when we got our food to see if we need anything extra.  The wait time was a little long.  Then while we in the middle of eating and having a conversation.  He drop by couple time within a short period of time to see if we want anything.

We got one tonight at the store. The flavor is so rich and wonderful and the pastry is delicious! We called ahead to order a preheated pie (you can also buy frozen or fresh and heat it up yourself). It was ready when we arrived and was a perfect temperature for eating when we got home. We got the white meat with vegetables. By vegetables, they mean diced potatoes and carrots. I also use peas in chicken pies when I make them, but we just had peas on the side. This is a great choice for a busy week night, especially with the option to call ahead to get your pie heated. Their pies are loaded with meat - very filling! We also purchased an apple pie tonight. The pie crust was excellent (same as the chicken pie) but the taste of the filling was a little different - the flavor of what I think was mace was very strong. It wasn't bad, but I found it to be a bit strange. I won't get an apple pie again, but I will try their other fruit pies. The shop in Medford is bright and clean and has plenty of parking. The cost of a pie that feeds 6 is $19.95, which I think is pretty good compared to the cost at other places, and the pies are much more packed with meat and vegetables than other pies I have purchased (at Wilson Farms and Whole Foods)."},{"name":"Ko Sheng Chinese Restaurant","address":"3350 Cleveland Ave","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Great rice, extremely fast delivery, but so far, even the non spicy food is in fact spicy."},{"name":"City Landing","address":"255 State St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Best veg burger EV-ER.

The #1 consists of cuban breaded steak, shredded pork leg, ham, franks (yes, hotdogs), mozzarella cheese and some veggies.   Yes, all that stuff on one sandwich!   The #7 is chlanga steak, chorizo, cheese and veggies.   All sandwiches are served with pickled jalapenos (on them or on the side) and are accompanied by a very spicy chipotle sauce.

Carthage Cafe has the feel of an antiquated restaurant, complete with dark walls and really neat chandeliers.  We arrived around 9 PM, and were given a cozy table at the back of the restaurant.\\n\\nThe food served here is french, with appetizers costing around $10, and entree's ranging anywhere from $20-32.  Carthage Cafe has a whole section of their menu devoted to mussels, with a variety of different sauces and flavors, each for $15.\\n\\nSince my friend and I were both guilty of snacking before our super late dinner date, we decided to opt for appetizers and a shared plate of mussels.  We received a small french bread and butter starter, which was a nice touch.\\n\\nFor an appetizer, I opted for the classic french onion soup ($11), which was smaller than I expected, but pretty good.  I've had better french onion soup, but it was still worthwhile.  My friend had the salad special for the day, which looked great.  For the mussels, we chose the Carthago mussels, which came in a spicy cumin sauce.  The mussels were great, but not as spicy as we hoped.  The mussels did come with a side of frites (aka fries), which were crispy and hot - try dipping them in the mussels sauce for an extra burst of flavor!  Another tip: keep some bread around for dipping, we were very happy we had done so.\\n\\nOur waiter was really friendly, and refilled our water glasses at least 5 or 6 times throughout the meal.  He gave us the full spiel on all of the specials of the night, and was great at answering questions, such as \\"what is harissa?\\" (turns out it's a spicy sauce).  He also didn't treat us any differently after we didn't order any alcohol or dessert.  It took awhile for us to get the bill, but everything else came out in a timely fashion.\\n\\nOverall, if you're looking for a nice hideaway restaurant to share a meal, Carthage Cafe is a great place to go."},{"name":"Jim & Patty's Coffee","address":"4130 SW 117th Ave","city":"Beaverton","stars":"4.5","text":"This is my first visit after reading about their new location opening in Beaverton.  \\nLove the fresh bakery selections.

A friend and I wanted to do our part and donate as well.  We researched where there would be a truck and a time to go.  This brought me into the Davenport area.  Unfortunately we could not donate that day, but I took the opportunity to stop by the Alehouse and give it a try.  Firstly, I want to get out there that this is not a Miller's Ale House.  It's more along the lines of a mom and pop trying to piggy back off of a popular brand.  Sadly the quality of food they serve makes it quite obvious that they are not on the same level of standards.  \\nSince my friend had other obligations, I came in alone and sat at the bar. It was a Tuesday afternoon so I wasn't expecting a big crowd, but the place was totally dead.  At the bar I was greeted by a very nice bartender who quickly took my drink order, gave me my menu, and a few minutes later circled back for my order.  I decided upon pork crackling for an appetizer and for an entr√©e, a sweet ginger wrap. (I am not sure if they still have these items on the menu.  The web page for the appetizers doesn't work and appears the wrap is gone).  Friends from the UK make a roast pork with crackling as a side.  I love it, but only get it twice a year.  I was hoping for that, or something like it.   Unfortunately not even close to their recipe, but it came out piping hot and fresh which was great.  My suggestion is less crackling.  It tasted good but there was way too much of the product.  You get tired of the taste after a while, and you were only given a small amount of dipping sauce.  It never hurts leaving them wanting more, which is the whole point of an appetizer.   \\nNow the wrap was a separate issue all together.  It was chicken in their sweet ginger sauce on top of coleslaw.  I love ginger sauces especially with chicken and am a pretty big fan of coleslaw.  So this seemed like a good combination.   I was wrong on many levels.  My first issue was that it had a very bland taste, which is very shocking to me.  Ginger has a very distinctive taste and should be quite noticeable throughout the wrap whereas in this one, I could not taste it for the life of me.  What may have changed this is if they used fried chicken instead of grilled.  There was nothing for the taste to grab on to.  The one taste that was overpowering was the slaw.  This leads me to my second issue which was the sogginess of the whole thing.   The coleslaw did not help this at all.  I got through the first half but could not finish the rest.  I just gave up on the whole thing.  They offered to box it up, but I had no desire to take that home.  \\nOver all I would not waste your time and money here.  I mean the items that I had may have just been bad, but why take the chance.  I know I won't be back with better options in the area.  Like the real Alehouse in Champions gate.  One thing I can say is that the service there was good and friendly, which is the only saving grace for here.  Final conclusion is that Davenport Ale House is Fat Kid Tested but sadly not Fat Kid approved.  \\nAs Always Stay Peckish My Friends."},{"name":"Pan Roma Pizzeria & Grill","address":"1026 A Commonwealth","city":"Boston","stars":"2.5","text":"Blegh.\\n\\nI had high hopes for a place that was \\"probably\\" underrated because it's next to T.

Since I've only done omakase here, I was fortunate enough to try just a little bit of everything. The fish here is exceptionally fresh and the sushi chefs are masters, garnishing each dish subtly to play up different flavors. This is a high-end sushi experience in a very traditional non-pretentious setting. It's fairly dim and feels relatively private, so a great place to dine in solo.\\n\\nI've had ramen here as well which was solid, albeit a little sprouty.

I started out with the moonshine drink, it was delicious, especially love the dried apple soaking in the drink. Don't be fooled by the size; it seriously packs a punch. \\n\\nI got the pulled pork sandwich, mac and cheese, and coleslaw for dinner. The pulled pork sandwich was absolutely delicious and super flavorful on its own, though as a fan of barbecue sauces I poured a healthy portion of the house sauce over it and loved that even more. It came with homemade pickles that were wonderful and definitely not to be forgotten in the crazy amount of food.  The coleslaw was awesome, nice big pieces of cabbage and a nice creamy sauce. The mac and cheese, however, was just divine. I am a huge mac and cheese fan and this was deliciously homemade feeling. The sauce is not overdone, which is often an issue with restaurant mac and cheese, and the buttery crackers are a very happy edition. Top it off by serving it in a mug and I am just feeling cozy and at home. My husband had his meal with the broccoli and cheese casserole, which was really tasty and he absolutely adored it. To finish the meal, because we simply couldn't resist despite the food coma we were entering, we shared the giant nutter butter. It was seriously giant and I can't imagine finishing it myself.  The cookies were super crispy and had a really nice salted peanut butter taste to them. The filling was so light and creamy that I could have eaten it with a spoon and been completely happy.\\n\\nIn terms of staff and decor, I thought they hit it dead on. I love the homey feel of mismatched utensils and napkins that you had to dole out yourself. The trays with butcher paper that they serve the food on are a no nonsense way to really show off how awesome the whole meal is. Mason jars were a huge hit with our party, much more fun than the same old glasses. The staff was absolutely amazing. Our waiter could not have been nicer and was really down to earth, joking around with our group. I wish I had thought to get his name to point out how great he really was. We had one individual with some intense food allergies and he checked very thoroughly with the kitchen, which was very appreciated and thoughtful.

The general consensus is spot on: Maybe a little pricey, and the wifi isn't free, but the atmosphere is unbeatable.\\n\\nTo expand: Yes, the prices are a bit high, but honestly, the price of a good sandwich anywhere nowadays is high. Sure you could get a big mac at the McDonald's down the block for a lot cheaper, but why would you want to? And more importantly, would you want to sit there to eat it? Think of it as a $5 sandwich with a cover, and maybe it hits closer to the mark. And steering away from fancy items, basic drinks like coffee and tea aren't higher than, say, Starbucks, but are better. Wifi too is prohibitively expensive -- but sometimes I'm glad it is. Diesel is already almost always too busy to even find a seat, so I don't mind a little less incentive for others to park themselves on a couch and  monopolize the space all day.\\n\\nDiesel is the kind of cafe that makes me go out of my way to find myself in Davis so I can stop in. How many cafes do you know where you can shoot pool? The whole place bleeds cool, without coming off as artificially slick. It's a great place to sit with some tea and people watch, it's a great place to grab a coffee after a movie with a date. It's a great place to hash out some ideas with a colleague.

Quite tasty. They did fry the tortillas supporting the dish, and here's where the trouble started. The kale pretty much instantly softened the corn. So I don't know about you, but if I am going to have the extra calories of something fried like that, I want to get the requisite crunch. Truth is, the kale not only deprived me of that satisfying crisp tooth shatter, but for the first half of my meal, it made it extremely difficult to cut into--like tough leather. As time progressed, they did soften back and became more manageable, but that returns us to why fry at all?\\n\\nPerhaps if they wrung out the kale before loading it on the plate? Perhaps if the tortilla were put to the side with kale, beans and eggs in the middle--sort of a deconstructed redux? Perhaps really fresh plain steamed corn tortillas? Choices abound. \\n\\nOn to the guac--fresh, yes. Ripe avos, yes. A little pasty and overworked to my taste, though.

Which is a problem if you're full and then a cart you've never seen before carries the spareribs, the tofu skin wrapped shrimp, and the tripe, and suddenly you have to make room for 3 more dishes because they look so appetizing.  Needless to say, I was completely stuffed after eating here.  I'd definitely come back.\\n\\nWe tried one item off the regular menu, walnut shrimp, but the shrimp had no flavor.  I'd recommend sticking to the dim sum carts."},{"name":"Davide Restaurant","address":"326 Commercial St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"I would give Davide 1.5 stars but Yelp won't let me.  I went here on Friday night with my boyfriend and his dad, who was in town for business (the dad, not the boyfriend) and he was meeting some colleagues at Davide, and asked us to join him.  It just so happened that Friday night was also Game 1 of the Sox-Indians series.  Yes, I know..you're asking yourself, why in heaven would anyone make the choice to go out to dinner instead of watching the Sox.  I asked myself the very same question that evening and my experience at Davide did not help me feel better about my choice.\\n\\nWe started with cocktails.  Despite the small, unimpressive bar, my drink was pretty good, but it was just Belvedere and Sprite..hard to mess up.  We then ordered wine and the table decided to go with Chianti, at the suggestion of our server (more on him later) who claimed it was the best they had.  I'm averse to Chianti but I didn't want to be the squeaky wheel.   I decided to partake so as not to feel left out and I was not impressed (to top it off it was $56 per bottle).  The wine was completely unremarkable and didn't seem to complement our meals well.\\n\\nNext we ordered scallops, carpaccio and the eggplant for appetizers.  Didn't try the carpaccio, but the scallops and eggplant were good.  The scallops were flavorful and cooked well.  The eggplant was a bit heavy as it was cheese filled.\\n\\nFor my entree, I ordered the lobster ravioli.  The ravioli was in a cream sauce and came with about 5 or 6 pieces.  The pieces were quite large, which actually detracted from the dish.  There was almost too much lobster in the ravioli.  It was very average.\\n\\nNow for the service.  At first, I was impressed because they continued to update us on the Sox score (yippee!!!).  What happened next shocked me.  Towards the end of our meal, the men at the table (four men, I was the only woman) were asked if they would like another drink.  I waited for the server to get to me, but he completely ignored me.  OK, maybe it was an oversight.  Well, it happened again at dessert.  He paid no attention to me, taking everyone else's coffee orders and ignoring me.  For the remainder of the night, the server blatantly ignored me.  \\n\\nGood appetizers, bad service = 1.5 stars.  Shame on you Davide for being sexist."},{"name":"IKEA","address":"3320 Jacombs Road","city":"Richmond","stars":"3","text":"When I first moved here, I went to IKEA on a weekly basis.

It seemed, and still seems, fine to me.\\n\\nWe found a deal on a rug in the As-Is section.  Don't overlook this section, tucked away right by the warehouse.  Good finds are to be found here.  For instance our rug, the tag said \\"dirty.\\"  But it's a multi-color shag rug. There's no visible spots...  We later discovered that we got it at a quarter of the original price- score!  We've also gotten a display futon from this section for half off.  So again, always stop in the as-is section.\\n\\nThe rest of the store is a little crazy.  Did you know there's an elevator in the wall art section?  I don't remember where it lets you out on the 2nd level (maybe the desk section), but I do consider it a good shortcut if you're going back to look at one item.  \\n\\nAs for the cinnamon rolls by the checkout.  I think IKEA has perfected the cinnamony smell, but not yet the flavor.  They're good, but they are just never as good as I want them to be.  If that makes any sense.

I'm VERY surprised by the poor reviews on the coffee- I've actually been really pleased with their switch to Counter Culture Coffees.  Counter Culture is widely regarded as one of the best coffee roasters in the country- just Google them!- and I've really enjoyed tasting the varieties that Northstar provides.

Trusting what one person defines as a good burger is often tricky, because some people think grease defines good, others - size...others, affordability. This one is all of the above:\\n\\n- Just greasy enough, AND flavored very well! - Flavor, check\\n\\n- You can trust the grease because the burgers are organic/grass fed, and the fries are cooked in olive oil - Healthy choice, check. As Michael Pollan puts it, \\"You are what you eat eats, too...\\"\\n\\n- Price-wise, we were happy. The elevation burger is a double patty, and costs about $7 after tax. The three of us split one side of fries, happily (though two hungry people could probably handle it). And, we saved room for some cookies!...budget friendly, check.\\n\\nAlso, if Marvin the robot and a jukebox had a baby...their baby would be the Elevation Burger fountain machine :)\\n\\nMy one critique was that we showed up during an apparent lull, at about 1:15pm (and were one of three sets of customers there), and couldn't find a table that didn't have crumbs all over it. Having worked a number of years in the service industry, I was a little disappointed that someone hadn't thought to come out and clean during that brief period before people started trickling in again.\\n\\nIn my opinion, going here is like stepping into the future. If society is trending toward awareness and responsibility, then hopefully others will follow suit.

The dish was better qualified as a pasta salad -- penne roughly tossed with several items from the salad bar, dressed with oil and topped with cheese -- and lacked a cohesion of flavors I typically expect from pastas. The sliced chicken breast (for an additional $3) was dry  and had a tough charred layer from sitting on the grill for much too long. Very disappointing dish that alone would have received 1 star at best. \\n\\nThe reedeming factor for Carrabbas was their complementary bread.

The buns are house-made and fries are actually hand-cut everyday according to the chef/owner. The portions are huge too. I will definitely come back to try the rest of their menu. The owner also told me that they would have seasonal menus so that should be something to look forward to. This should be a good joint for beers too with their cheap appies.

We sat at a table and I picked up the menus.  There were 6 to look at, everyone was filthy, with food from previous customers.  We really should have just gotten up and left but the beer selection looked good and I wanted to try something new.  They must be extremely proud of their beers because they charge $6.25 for a 10 oz glass.  Really? Who does that?  The beer was good but thats the only good thing I'll write in this review.  They had beer cheese soup on the menu and I asked for a sample before ordering a bowl.  The waitress said that the chef usually won't do that but it was slow and she would ask.  She came back and said, no, he said he's not going to start playing that \\"game\\".  WOW, apparently good customer service is not something that interests him.  I told the waitress that I would not be ordering any soup and ordered a sandwich and french fries, I also asked for some tarter sauce.  The food arrived and like the beer, it was overpriced for what you got and additionally there was nothing special about.  Chef?  I have had better sandwiches at Subway.  Even my wife who never complains said \\"I don't need to ever come back here\\" after getting her food.  Now for the straw that broke the camels back.  When our waitress brought our check I looked it over and saw that I was charged 50 cents for the 1 oz container of tarter sauce she brought for me to dip my fries in.

On the bright side, the majority of the ingredients (rice, beans, cheese) are very tasty - but I can get this at Taco Bell for a couple of bucks. A $6 chicken Chipotle burrito can feed me twice but the one here, when unwrapped - wouldn't fill a 1/4 cup. At least the quantity has been consistent as this is usually my go-to item. My guest ordered the fajitas and asked if he could substitute the accompanied guacamole for sour cream. Yes! our waiter said but extra sour cream is .49 - so he doesn't want your guac but you'll charge him to substitute sour cream? Maybe there was a language barrier there but really? Oh, did I mention the small amount of chicken in the fajitas but the overwhelming amount of peppers and onions on the fiery plate?\\nChips are very good and they make some of the best salsa I've had in Portland. As we left I told myself I will never go there again - not because the food's bad but value, especially for Mexican food, is lacking here. But I'm a sucker and will probably give it one more try."},{"name":"Dan's Hamburgers - Austin","address":"5602 N Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I was in the mood for a hamburger, but I thought I'd give Phil's Ice House a break ('cause absence makes the heart grow fonder).

The dining area was pretty messy, but that's not important to me if the food is top notch.  Unfortunately, my meal was just okay.

The shining star of the meal was the potatoes. They were cooked to perfection and had an amazing creamy white sauce on them which was delightful. Our waitress suggested we take them as leftovers because the sauce gets better overnight. Boy was she right! I heated them up the next morning and mixed them with some scrambled eggs and it was a real treat!

First, I should admit to having eaten here previously - in fact many times prior to the restaurant expanding into the adjoining space. You'll find Los Hermanos on the left side of the Publix shopping center in Tucker, right on Hugh Howell Rd (Lawrenceville Hwy splits to the left and continues as Hugh Howell if you're coming from i285 - you go on the right fork. If you're familiar with Handy Hardware it's the shopping center you would hit when leaving Cowan Rd instead of turning left or right onto Hugh Howell). \\n\\nMy prior experiences were very good until the restaurant expanded. I had the misfortune of eating there one busy night after the seating was doubled and it was just horrible. I figured they needed some time to get their act together and last night was my first visit since then. It's been several years so it was time for another try, right?\\n\\nI'm happy to report that Lost Hermanos has indeed recovered and I'm giving it a solid four stars. The service was amazing and the food excellent. \\n\\nThe starter salsa is very different from your usual swag-Mex fare. The term that comes to mind is \\"meaty\\" - not that there's a speck of animal remains in it - it's the heavy flavor of ripe tomatoes. You actually get that up-front, then a hit of cilantro (there's plenty of fresh green in the salsa), with the remaining flavors last. There's none of that after-taste you get from the stuff gotten from the bottle/can. Also it doesn't have the heavy acid you usually taste in conventional salsas - I liked it quite a bit. My only change would be to add some heat - either a bit of Hatch green chile or to keep it fresh a mince of serrano pepper. The chips were also awesome and above average (both by being fresh and the flavor/smell combo), slightly thicker than average and very flavorful.\\n\\nAlthough this restaurant is billed as a taqueria, the rest of the menu and particularly the specials always entice me to get something other than tacos - last night I chose the mole chicken enchiladas from their specials menu. Wow, this was perhaps the best mole I've had in Atlanta - thick and rich with the combination of earthy flavors and chocolate that makes mole dishes so delicious. Along with a side of rice, a spoon-ful of pico and a Mex-first for me, green beans. I know it sounds weird but the green beans were tossed with onions and large chunks of garlic, heavy sauteed and were quite good. I give this dish an easy 4 stars (I also uploaded an image of the dish).\\n\\nMy dining companions chose the Shrimp Corn Chowder (I've had it before and it's quite good) with the only comment that it was sweeter than they expected but they still thought it very good. They also shared the House Tamales from the specials menu which they raved about. This was two tamales, one pork with green chile and the other chicken in red (looked like achiote) with black beans. The pork had large chunks while the chicken looked to be pulled and slightly shredded. They particularly brightened at the pork, even pointing out the wonderful consistency of the masa and size of the pieces. I think I'll try this next time if it's offered as a special.\\n\\nFrom memory, I've had a few other dishes - in particular the shrimp soup from the specials menu comes to mind - imagine a huge margarita glass filled with gazpacho with the rim lined with peeled shrimp - delicious! I've also had the carne asada burrito and the fajitas in various combinations - all quite good. All plates came loaded with food - you won't be leaving hungry. Also the prices were very reasonable for the quality of the food you receive. The three of us spent around $45 with drinks (two entries - one shared, soup, two sangrias and a beer).\\n\\nIn all, a good experience with great service. The only failing of this restaurant is the lack of tequila as Los Hermanos only serves beer and wine combinations (even the margarita is made with wine and in my opinion not worth the effort). If you're in a beer mood you're in luck as the selection is better than what you'll find in a typical swag-Mex place (including Blue Moon, 420, and Yuengling). Also they offer a selection of entry-level California wines for the winos, however the snobs won't be happy. Last night I had the sangria and it was OK - there was an intensity of flavor that I liked but little \\"snap\\" - the fresh fruit felt like small bits of apple (hard to tell over the flavors other than consistency). While good not great.\\n\\nWe forwent the dessert but if I had still been hungry I would have ordered the tres leches or flan - probably the former as it's one of my faves."},{"name":"Del Frisco's Double Eagle Steak House","address":"9150 International Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"The food was great.

Don't let the thought of half a pound of food scare you, half a pound consisted of 4 crab legs that were meaty and juicy. We also ordered 1 lb of shrimp and half a pound of mussels. So that's about 2 lbs of food for 2 people, which was just nice. There are 4 different flavors that you can choose from- we chose the Shakin (cajun) for the crab legs and the Seoul (miso) for the shrimp and mussels. For the shrimp, you can choose to have it served with or without the heads. You can also pick the spice level- we chose medium for both. The Shakin was not too hot, but the Seoul was really really spicy, I had to drink more of my pineapple express to cool my poor tongue. We also ordered a side of sweet potato fries which were amazing.\\nService was just ok. Once our food came, our waitress disappeared.

Finally, I had a chance to try out Do on a Thursday night, our reservation was for 10:00pm. Due to the complimentary valet parking being full I drove around for about 20 minutes trying to find a parking spot, thankfully I drove around long enough to catch someone pulling out. When I walked inside I was greeted by a very friendly hostess who asked me the last name and seated me immediately.  I was seated at a table with 4 strangers and automatically  thought there must have been a mistake and she mixed us up with another party. The hostess explained that the seating was open and each group received a IPad to order and notify the waiter. Once seated the nice young lady set up the IPad and then demonstrated how to place a order. She was very patient and since it usually takes a minute for me to catch on to anything new I was grateful that she took her time explaining the process to me.\\nThe lightening was dim and the decor was very cool all white everything very contemporary. I took it all in and smiled. Even the rest rooms had me impressed which showed a light if it was occupied so you didn't have to keep knocking to see if anyone was in there and you could take a selfie as a mirrior. \\n\\nOur waiter arrived shortly after we sat down and was enthusiastic and professional. I had the Glass Pear cocktail and also the Berry Gordy and they both were excellent, nice flavors and just enough alcohol in my opinion. I had the classic cheese pizza and it was really good, better than most that I have had in Atlanta.    My friend had the chicken Ceasar salad  and was pleased.  To top off my Thursday night they had a live band \\"Quinn & Jukebox\\", always very entertaining and the audience was able to vote on which songs would be performed.

It was a delicious side dish and more healthy than just your usual fried potatoes or hash browns. Also a plus: homemade jam for the toast.  Possibly the best part of the meal.  My sausage-and-cheese omelet was so-so; the sausage was overcooked and chewy.  My boyfriend seemed to like his french toast.\\n\\nThe prices are great; 4 of us ate for about $30.

Ramen simply involves ordering straight off the menu. Hot pot, however, means you sit at a table with a ceramic boiler plate in the middle. You choose a soup base (broth), starch (rice/noodle) and protein. They'll bring your broth in an enormous pot that you bring to a boil and keep simmering throughout the meal.

For those people who have complained about the food, it is exactly the quality of food you are going to get from this kind of delivery place. I agree with the person who said their fries are perfect. I've gotten their pizza before, and I would say it is good. My favorite is their mozzarella sticks and the buffalo chicken kid's meal. It's the perfect amount of food and it's only like $5! What I like the most about Elton's is their service. They are always friendly when we call in orders, always get our order to us quickly, and sometimes even throw in some perks for being such loyal customers!

I think I've been to all finally.\\n\\nHad a high expectation for Toji.  But, I was deeply disappointed.  I give two stars because only the main dish was fine.  The waitress was horrible.  She converted the meat grill to a normal gas cook top and turned it on like 20 minutes before the soup arrived.  I've never seen that before.  Why did she want to waste energy and keep us so hot while the soup was not even ready.  It was almost 90 degrees yesterday.  In Korea and other restaurants, they usually lit the gas right before the soup arrives.  I know it's different for the meat grill because it takes time for the grill to get hot.  But, we weren't cooking meat.  It took more than 1/2 hour to get our food.  \\n\\nThe side dishes were mediocre.  Dry green onion kimchi, sweet potato looked like weeks old, kimchi was not fresh, the number of side dishes isn't great.\\n\\nThe thing about kimchi is that it gets sour as it ferments.  If you go to a good Korean restaurant, it's usually fresh (just made or lightly fermented).  Because they serve so much of it, the kimchi usually doesn't last to become heavily fermented.  Okay, Gam-mee-ok in New Jersey or Manhattan is a different case.  BTW as a side note, Gam-mee-ok has the best kimchi that I know.  Actually, it's so awesome that they opened a shop in Korea. (http://gammeeok.com/)\\n\\nWe ordered a gop-chang-jun-gol and it was okay.  The food is also overpriced.  It's probably the most expensive one in Portland area.  Not worth the extra money.  I looked at the meat that the people at the next table was cooking.  It looked nice, however.  So, if you really need to cook right at the table, try this place.  Otherwise, Nak-won definitely wins.  Too bad, it's sub-par compared to LA or other cities with a larger Korean population.  Portland really could use a good Korean restaurant.  A place I can take my friends to and be proud like Gam-Mee-Ok.

One of my favorite spots in the Square. I somehow find myself at the Kong at least once every weekend, usually around 1am, with a big group of friends. \\n\\nThe Kong at night on the weekend is such an experience -- it's always fully packed and yet I've never had an issue finding a table with a group. The Kong just has this incredibly familiar and comforting feel; you look around as you peruse the menu (even though you already know exactly what you want) and you realize that you recognize at least 30% of the other students at the restaurant. We always end up ordering a combination of the same few dishes: crab rangoons, scallion pancakes, dumplings, hot basil fried rice with tofu, tofu pad thai... Everything is completely fried, but it's okay, because that's what you expect from delicious late night Chinese food. Pair your food with a scorpion bowl, a sugary alcoholic drink, and you have a satisfying end (or beginning or middle...) to your evening. \\n\\nIt's important to note that not every Kong experience has been after a night of partying and drinking. I've enjoyed the Kong on weeknights for late night food as well. Whether I've been sober or drunk, every single time I've been to The Kong, I've made lasting memories. \\n\\n\\"The Kong\\" is such an integral component of the college experience (to such a degree that the verb \\"Kong-ing\\" has emerged).

It's always a go to when I'm feeling lazy and don't want to cook, but want something tasty, delicious, and relatively healthy. \\n\\nThe past time I went to Noodlebox (on Main Street), I was not as impressed as I usually am. The boxes weren't full and there were next to no veggies in it - but it was still tasty. But after my experience yesterday at Noodlebox in Kits I will not be going back. The service was horrible. We called in and they told us 20 min. We got there, payed, etc. and had to wait about 40 min from when we ordered the food for it to come out (they obviously waited for us to pay to start making it). In addition, out food came out, they didn't call our name and had to actually go up ask if any of the many boxes there were for us. This isn't even the worst part. \\n\\nAfter getting home and opening up our two dishes, we found them both to be incredibly bland with little to no flavour. We actually added salt at home on the hopes it would help. One dish we ordered with prawns and it literally had 3 prawns in it!!! And one of the dishes wasn't even slightly saucy - it was basically just cooked noodles! I mean zero sauce!!

I was both surprised and impressed. I have always been a bit hesitant to try this place due to the price and the fact that I always eat at El Pelon when in the area.\\n\\nSweet Cheeks does live up to the hype. Normally when dining at restaurants with celebrity chefs, I expect beautiful presentation or exquisite dishes most people would not be able to make. Good bbq is usually reserved for that southern comfort grill master or at old family restaurants not prevalent in Boston or New England. This is a true gem breaking barriers.\\n\\nThe main focus here is pig. There are some chicken and beef options, but they don't seem to be highlighted as much. The pork ribs and pork belly were favorites. The ribs were not fall off the bone baby back ribs, but were meaty and flavorful. Many seem to complain about how fatty some of their meats are, but the pork belly is supposed to be! It was juicy with just the right amount of bark. Pulled chicken was properly seasoned dark meat. Homemade bbq and hot sauce were decent.\\n\\nThe farm salad and mac/cheese really shined as side dishes. The combination of nuts, grapes, balsamic, and cheese is genius. Why don't more salads have grapes to make them more sweet? Perhaps I don't eat salad as much as I should, but this is a very suitable dish for any carnivore to try and pair with their meal. The trays do come with pickles and onions. Mac and cheese was the typical homemade style.\\n\\nA cocktail I would recommend for dessert is the Indian Summer. Listed as a normal cocktail, but definitely a bit sweet to drink with the meal. It came off as a coconut apple caramel latte on ice. The mason jar was rimmed with cinnamon sugar and coconut flakes.\\n\\nWe never had problems with service as some other yelpers have managed. It was in fact one of the positives.

The only reason I continued to buy their food was because they were one of the few people open late.

The bar area seemed pretty cool, although empty at the time of our visit. I believe four small TVs on the back wall of the bar area only. The service was fine, not fast or slow, as well as our order. My wife had the clam chowder which she enjoyed. Filling was her best description.

I always remember my dad coming home some nights with a box of goodies from this very place... the box usually consisted of lobster tails... Honestly, the lobster tails are to die for... It is love in every bite. Everytime I speak of it I crave more.. Not only do they have those delicious lobster tails but they also have many other choices as well... For example, they have their pizza.. Their pizza is the tastiest pizza I have ever tasted in my life at this moment.. They don't have the usual triangular shape slices,, they have the actual square slices that are normally seen in Italy.. And let me tell you those squares slices are jam packed with flavor.. I am NOT a big cheese person but I could literally eat this pizza all day the cheese is amazing on this pizza.. And the sauce is so delicious.. And don't even get me started on the crust. Each slice is white and fluffy and just cooked to perfection.. I can go on and on just talking about their wonderful food.. But I don't want to bore you. I do have one thing that I dislike about this place though. They are a little bit pricey. I have been to many other bakeries around here, and I feel like la casias is the most expensive. And although the prices are not so great here I still come here quite often and not just for the pizza but also for the other amazing dishes that they have. One of them being their mouth watering steak tips sub.. That is all I have been eating lately for some reason.. But anyways going on about the restaurant itself.. It's a very cute little place with seating inside and also a couple of chairs outside.. I love the location because it is near my house and also near the park.. And last but not least let's talk about the people that work there.. So far they've all been amazing people.. They are very helpful, funny, caring , wonderful people.. An overall the service is just great.. As you can tell I really love this Bakery and I hope to be coming here in the future with my kids and I hope that it's still around so that in the future my kids can even take their kids.. So that way they can all experience the wonderful food and the wonderful hospitality that this please give to everyone. Thank you so much for reading my review.

The food is bar food, but you won't see any 8-pack whitebread hamburger buns or american cheese slices here; they take pride in their food and it's reflected in the dishes.\\n\\nFinally, the atmosphere.  As others have complained, it certainly does pick up in the summer and is very often too crowded to find a table outside in the patio area.

Little Sheep is definitely one of my favorite hot pot places when I'm home in California, and I was feeling extremely lucky that this location was within a few blocks of my Austin apartment. When we arrived around 8pm, there was almost no wait and we were seated very quickly. However, the menu that we were handed was only the create your own dinner menu (where you select however many of each item you want). As we're attempting to eat healthily during our time in Austin -- a real struggle -- we noticed that it would add up quickly to order each vegetable ($1.50 ~ $2.50 each) that we wanted. It's $3 for napa cabbage man --\\n this location is near UT Austin housing, do they realize college students aren't made of money?? We asked if there was a veggie combo option like the one that my friend usually orders from her go-to Little Sheep location, which is when our waitress brought out our Dinner combination menu -- which is the menu I am most familiar with at LS. I'm not sure why they wouldn't give us the combination menu to begin with.\\n\\nWe ordered the half and half soup and lamb meat from combo A -- basically your most utilitarian combo which covers all your soup/meat/veggie/fish ball/tofu/etc needs. We also added on an order of the black fungus and vermicelli noodles -- they let us know that we could not substitute the noodles in the combo for vermicelli noodles. Which is a bummer, but I won't fault them for that; HOWEVER, that would have been an opportunity for them to win back a Yelp star. I always start out my Little Sheep meals with a bowl of the regular broth -- other locations have placemats with text touting the digestive benefits of doing so. However, at first sip, I could already tell that the broth was a little different. Not quite as flavorful, and also, simply flavored differently. \\n\\nWhen they brought us our plates, things arrived sporadically. First the lamb, later the black fungus and vermicelli noodles, and then finally the rest of the combo items -- all spaced apart. We were also told that we would have to pay for dipping sauces (at my home location, they simply bring you bowls of all the sauces, and at my friend's location, they have a sauce bar -- both free of charge). My friend asked for some hot sauce and they only had the chili in the sauce section of the menu which you have to pay additional for -- most Asian restaurants would at least have bottles of Sriracha at the ready. Once again -- we're not made of money! We decided to omit the sauces, you know, out of principle.  \\n\\nBeyond the soup, the ingredients were fairly standard and satisfying. However, the soup refills were sporadic -- we would be scraping the bottom of the pot before a waitress finally came around with refills. At my home location, even though it is *much* busier (restaurant packed with a ~20 minute wait time), the soup is always flowing and the service is better. \\n\\nAll in all, not the worst. It'll hit the spot, but this location is a disappointment compared to other Little Sheep locations. They have random (and excessive) charges for things that should be free or at least cheaper, they don't even give you all the menu options, the service was dismal, and the soup wasn't the most flavorful."},{"name":"Stephanie's On Newbury","address":"190 Newbury St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"This was the first restaurant I ever ate at when I moved to Boston and I'm sorry to say that it left a very bad impression on my Beantown memories. \\n\\nI usually don't remember much about my restaurant experiences but Stephanie's was so bad that I can remember it minute for minute. I arrived, waited for 45 minutes even though the place wasn't terribly crowded, and was seated in a cramped booth in the corner. The waitress was both snobby and lethargic, moving at the pace of a newborn sloth while maintaining an air of superiority.\\n\\nAfter waiting 20 minutes to place my order, and more waiting, the food arrived.

The water glasses were never refilled once and we walked out $80 poorer and an unsatisfied stomach.\\n\\nThe only reason I can think of going here again is if someone else was paying or to sit on the giant patio and people watch. even then, it's not worth the terrible food and service."},{"name":"Haveli Indian Cuisine","address":"225 Ted Turner Dr NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"This place is conveniently located in downtown and a short walk from many hotels.

The portion size on the first four meats that came out was far more than what would normally be given for 6 people. In my past experiences dining at Korean barbecue restaurants they start bringing small portions and when you've made it through most of that you have the opportunity to order more, as to not waste food. We had a very hard time making it through the first portion of meats, we didn't get to even try the other 2 that were included in the option we ordered. With only a few pieces left on the plate we felt pretty good about how much we had eaten, when the waitress came over and somewhat rudely pointed out we needed to eat.

When it shows up a half hour later it has one small fried egg, half a piece of toast, one over cooked tomato slice,two  pieces of regular American bacon and a few sauteed mushrooms caps. When I asked where my bangers were I was told \\" oh we are out of bangers, I thought I told you that\\". No, you didn't. Nor did you tell me you were out of back bacon. I was told that I got an extra piece piece of bacon(total of 2) to make up for my troubles. So...I just waited half an hour and paid eight bucks for a single fried egg two pieces of bacon and HALF a piece of toast a slice of tomato and four or five mushroom caps. Which part of this is English? The tomato? The mushrooms? Sorry, I can make regular bacon and eggs myself. I might even splurge and give myself a whole piece of toast."},{"name":"101 Steak","address":"3621 Vinings Slope SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Amazing food in a lovely setting, very accommodating.

She was hoping for jackfruit, but unfortunately they were out, although it was before 10 on a Thursday. I have to hope that was an unfortunate one-off thing, especially as I'm not seeing a lot of other reviews saying the same.

The salmon was a touch overly marinated, but I could still taste the freshness of the salmon. The spicy sauce was also a tad too spicy, but I took it like a man. I tasted my friends' savory tuna poke bowls and I did enjoy the savory sauce more, although the tuna didn't seem to have the same freshness as the salmon. Seemed very odd that my bowl only had one slice of avocado. My friend noticed that hers only had one slice, as well, while another didn't even know there was avocado in his bowl. The seaweed salad was a nice touch. It could have used a little more crunch, but I mostly enjoyed my salmon poke. For me and my friend Lisa S, it was the perfect portion, but Albert Y. found it to be not filling. \\n\\nI thought the prices were a little steep.. But it may be due to the location.

There are also two size options for the deli: regular or NY stack. NY stack is double the meat. I'm glad I went with regular because I was stuffed afterwards. I thought my food looked like Panera Bread. The sandwich was good, but not heavenly good. It didn't blow my mind away. Potato salad is just like any other salad. It is also overpriced. My food was 9.99 (if I got NY stack, it would be $15). For the same food in Panera Bread, it would be roughly $7. SO overall, I think Goldberg's is overpriced version of Panera Bread.

If you're looking for an awesome inexpensive meal and don't care for falafel, just get a veggie pita and you'll get hummus, baba banoush, and whatever you want from the bar that will fit inside the bread. But in my opinion, their fresh, delicious falafel for less than $5 is a meal that cannot be beat. The fries are also delicious, with or without the spicy seasoning. I like my falafel pita sandwich with hummus and baba, and medium spicy.

Our server told us we could get a side of our choice and suggested the baked french onion soup as my friend wanted something hot. The soup was delicious and hearty and she couldn't finished it all so we shared. \\n\\nThe Pepperoni Pizza Burger was disappointing. The first bite had a frozen pizza taste. Not sure if this how it normally tastes or that this was in the freezer for too long. Would have given them points for creativity but unfortunately, it was a fail. \\n\\nLastly, we got the NY striploin which was supposedly would have come with seasonal vegetables, toast and our choice of side. My friend ordered mash with gravy as the side. It came with two portion of mash and no gravy nor veggies. My friend didn't seem to mind too much and would have preferred without the veg anyways. He was reluctant to ask for the gravy as we thought we wouldn't be charged for it. Both the steak and the mash was ok but not up to steakhouse standards which is what we expected anyways. \\n\\nThe service at this location was immensely terrible. The server never came to fill our glasses and when we were handed the bill, we noticed that they messed up with my friend's sides. An additional charge of mash and two charges for gravy. Also my friend who ordered the soup was unaware that subing out the salad to soup would add an additional charge as well. She didn't mind since she enjoyed the soup and would have paid extra for it. However, when we told the server that there was a mistake for the additional charge of gravy and that we never got the veggies, she seemed displeased and told us it was correct and refused to correct our bill. Then after a short while of dispute, she huffed and puffed to the computer to make the changes. When we all paid our bill, provided that we still tipped her for the terrible service, she threw our receipt to the table and left without saying anything.Did I just tip you for this kind of service?!?!

The steak pizza was decent, but it was overwhelmed with baby spinach and for 19 dollars, it pales in comparison to other comparably priced pizzas like Upper Crust.\\n\\nThe service was fine and the atmosphere was good.

We were seated after about 15 minutes, which wasn't bad at all for a party of four. The patio was super-crowded, and I was surprised that there was more than one stroller in attendance. Totally cool; I'm sure your one-year old enjoys people-watching and people-critiquing on Newbury as much as the next baby. But must you put your stroller on TOP of my chair?!\\n\\nOur server was a little absent-minded but very nice. Our drink order took a little while, and I am positive I got a Coke instead of Diet Coke. I'm not just being paranoid and Kate Moss-y about it ... regular Coke makes my teeth hurt, and it was SO regular Coke ... anyhow, only two of the four of us ordered glasses of wine, and I'm afraid this failed to keep his interest. However, our server LOVED the baby at the table next to us ... apparently, that baby was drinking the $15 margaritas. Not a big deal, I understand, I'm 20 and I cannot legally drink. Still, I'm a paying customer, and I wish I weren't always ignored because I am forced by federal law to get only soda or apple juice at your fine establishment.\\n\\nFor lunch, I ordered some sort of yellowfin tuna salad that was kind of ... tasteless. It was bland, in an I-come-precooked-and-bagged-from-Aramark kind of way. The vegetables weren't fresh and the dressing made everything salty and soggy and indistinguishable. It was very chain-style, and I was not prepared for that. My companions' food was similarly meh, and one complained that the clam chowder was lukewarm and bland. One member of the party enjoyed his burger but said it was nothing special, and our other companion's salad was pretty mediocre and sadly devoid of the goat cheese it promised.\\n\\nThe view is good, of course and it's a nice piece of real estate. However, there are other places on Newbury at this price point or less, and with better food. I know it's something of an institution and can be fun, but I just didn't enjoy my meal as much as I had hoped I would.

Me, drunk, and unable to get my ass outta Mehf'id.\\n\\nI was told by my local guide (newbie yelper, Jocelyn W.) that this was one of my best options for \\"this time of night\\" which, in my opinion was not THAT late, but I guess you can take the girl out of Cambridge, but the Cambridge ALWAYS wants to order food late night and there isn't much that will change that. \\n\\nI had a lovely chat with the guy who answered the phone, I told him we wanted to make our own pizza, (the bottle of wine I'd had made it a bit trickier to explain that I didn't actually want to MAKE it, I just wanted to CUSTOMIZE it, like a mug... Uh, yeah, I don't drink that much all that often, poor bastard...) \\n\\nWe tried to recreate a really good pizza we had had a few weeks earlier at one of our favorite places. Alfredo's, however, doesn't have pepperoncinis. For reals. A sub/pizza shop that doesn't have pepperoncinis. They have the word \\"Italian\\" in their name, but still, nada. Eeesh. They did have jalapenos, so we substituted. Ricotta, mozzarella, and since they also didn't have roasted red peppers, we got green peppers. Yikes. Strange sub shop. \\n\\nThe guy was nice, and worked with my slightly incapacitated self during the ordering process, about 25 minutes later (read: a glass of pinot later...) the food was there. It slowed the drinking, and we didn't scarf the thing down immediately, cause of the plentiful jalapenos. Not bad. Not what we had ordered elsewhere, but it did the job. \\n\\nIn the end, I'd order again, maybe one of their own specialty pizzas, for which they'd have all the necessary ingredients, and I'd try to be more coherent when I called... Either way, I got home that night, and it was thanks in part to Alfredo's."},{"name":"Burgerville","address":"10903 NE 4th Plain Blvd","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"Burgerville has to be the best burger place ever!

First of all, the pizza crust was hard as a rock, and the pizza itself was very tasteless. Even the salad with those toppings would taste better than this. I think it wasn't tasty because of the main ingredient of the pizza, the crust, wasn't tasty at all.\\n\\nThey had another chance to make this up, but then this Chicken & Mushroom Fettuccini ($16.99) was unbearable. The overcooked pasta was very mushy and soggy. Their signature Marsala cream sauce was bland, and didn't go well with the noodles because there wasn't enough sauce and the sauce it self was very weak in flavours.

Undrinkable coffee.\\n\\nIf they had good coffee and opened an hour earlier, I'd eat here everyday. For breakfast, the Cloud Nine Pancakes, Classic Egg Sandwich, Prosciutto and Poached Eggs, Ham and Cheese and Praline Scones are all excellent. The fresh fruit drinks such as orange, strawberry and carrot are fresh and wonderful. For lunch the Chicken and Avocado Sandwich, Niman Ranch Cheeseburger and Sweet Basil Burrito are all great. There is nothing artificial in the food and much of it sourced locally and/or organic.\\n\\nUp until recently, the coffees were some of the best darker roasts in Columbus. Now, even though they offer at least three different brews, all taste more like pureed green olives than coffee. There are specialty coffee shops like CREMA in Nashville that have excellent beans and use lighter roasts so as to leave the varietal qualities of the bean intact.  That's great if your beans are superb and all you do is coffee. But if you are serving coffee as an accompaniment to food, then, as in wine parings, it is not just about the coffee, its the combination of food and coffee. The caramel flavors of Vienna roasts work a lot better with baked goods, butter and jam than the raucous taste of raw green olives.  \\n\\nThe service is usually outstanding, but recently spirits seem a bit worn; perhaps complaints about the coffee have taken a toll. I'll still be dropping by for the food, but I'll be bringing in my own coffee or selecting one of the excellent fruit juices instead.I sincerely hope that the proprietors can see there way to offering at least one medium or dark roast choice, and as soon as they do, I'll be back here to revise my rating.

In Portland, however, where restaurants such as these seem to be as ubiquitous as snobby coffee joints, craft beer pubs and antique (second-hand) shops, this cozy Hawthorne bistro is just another example of the diverse and healthy dining options available to you in this vibrant city. With their playful and health-minded takes on traditional comfort foods all set in a comfortable open dining room, Harlow is, for me, quintessential Portland dining.\\n\\nI was on a recent trip to Portland with my brothers and we decided to venture onto Hawthorne for breakfast. Yes, there are a lot of options, but we settled on Harlow. It was good choice. Harlow is a casual dining restaurant where you order at the counter and the food is delivered to your table. Their menu includes a lot choices for those looking to avoid meat or gluten or GMOs. I don't eat eggs, so it was nice to see that their breakfast items offered the choice of eggs or tempeh. \\n\\nI ordered their Chickpea Hash. When you think traditional hash,your mind (at least my mind) goes towards a hearty, greasy mix of meat and potatoes. \\n\\nNot at Harlow. Their hash consists of kale and spinach, sauteed with mushrooms, zucchini, cabbage and chickpeas, topped with wonderfully-fried bars of tempeh. Drizzled on top is a spicy red bell pepper sauce. At first, I was a little disappointed in the serving size, but after savoring every single bite, I found myself absolutely stuffed. It was amazing!\\n\\nMy brothers ordered the Mercy Blues (Harlow's take on eggs benedict, served up with polenta and kale) and the Pride of Portland (A bowl of brown rice with a poached egg and avocado, served with a green juice). They looked good, and my brothers were happy as well.\\n\\nAll in all, if you're coming to Portland and want to get a taste of the city, look no further that Harlow!\\n\\nEnjoy!"},{"name":"Zhous Chinese Restaurant","address":"1930 Como Lake Avenue","city":"Coquitlam","stars":"3","text":"Good fried rice - love the sweet and sour pork.

I asked him to go light on the toppings, he looked at me and threw a glob of tasteless guac on my last taco. I was starving and figured the tortillas would hold up. I sat at the bar space, tried to pick up my first and fail. The whole thing fell apart due to the mountain of crap that was loaded on top. Oh well, I'll eat with a knife and fork. What I found was cold, tasteless (literally tasteless, I knew something was in my mouth, but there was NO flavor) pile of shit.\\n\\nI turned around and told the girl at the register that they were terrible and I wanted my money back.

When we arrived the restuarant had a total of 5 tables that were being served. Our party of five was seated at a obnoxiously large picnic style table. Communal maybe?? Whatever! The ambiance was ok, very cold and dark inside. I wasnt feeling the best so I wanted something brothy, and I thought Miso soup would cheer me right up. For some reason glancing over the menu \\"Miso Soup\\" didn't jump right out at me. I realized that it didn't because this wasn't the \\"traditional\\" miso soup that I was getting. This miso soup had clams and all this other sh*t in it. I hoped when she saw that I just wanted miso she would have jumped in and said \\"hey, just so you know our miso has clams in it, just in case you're allergic or something\\", but I guess it was my bad for not reading thoroughly. My friend ordered the warm Sake. I felt it took a lot longer than it needed to boil some water and throw some tofu in, and warm up some sake; but thats just us. Damn New Yorker's, can't take us anywhere.\\n\\nOur friends arrived, and we all placed our orders. Surprisingly the sushi came a lot quicker than my salted hot water, and my friend's tepid sake. Unfortunately for us, for the price, we were expecting a decently sized sushi roll. What we were given were these rolls about the size of a quater. WTF??? I've gotten bigger rolls at Sushi Land, and for a lot less!! One of our friends found hair in her napkin and the bartender (side note\\" He doesn't work there normally. He's just doing a favor for his friend who owns the place\\"....I know this because he mentioned at least 3x....Alright I get it, you're not regularly employed!) was kind enough to offer her a drink on the house. I guess he was thinking the alcohol would either kill whatever bacteria she had just ingested, or at least forget about it. We got our check after about 20 minutes after our table was cleared, along with a comment card.\\n\\nNeedless to say my friends and I weren't impressed. If anything we were annoyed, and still fairly hungry. The comment card was filled out and the person filling it out simply expressed how they felt. They commented on their experience, and gave their feedback. Is that so wrong?? Then please tell me why the bartender (who doesn't really work there because he's helping out a friend who happens to own the place) storms out of the restaurant, bangs on my friends car window and then starts screaming at us saying \\"I don't know who accused the waitress of being on her period, but that was uncalled for\\"......ok I'll back track. The comment read, and this was in no way an attack it's just someones opinion and their personal experience. The comment read \\" The waitress pissed everyone at the table off. She may be on her period. I get that way too. The service was subpar, and it's too far to come back to\\". So he said that it was uncalled for and over the top. I didn't realize there was a limit to what you can write, or that we needed to sensor ourselves. \\n\\nNeedless to say we won't be going back, but whomever that bartender/not currently employed at Yakuza Lounge but is helping out a friend who is the owner, I totally respect you for coming out and calling us out on our comment. If you were offended thats too bad, not our intention really. But instead of yelling at us for accusing some chick of being on the rag, maybe you should focus on the spotty service because you just lost at least 5 people.\\n\\nMaybe you're on the rag too!!

We had eaten somewhere else, so we weren't hungry, but my sweetheart was so impressed with Lure that he wanted to take me there for a late afternoon cocktail.  From the moment we entered the Lure walkway, I knew we were in for a treat.  The subtly nuanced architecture, and decor let me know (immediately) that we were going to the sea.  Upon entering, we were greeted with smiles and a very charming bartender, Brent Gatehouse.  Let me tell you, I have traveled all over the world and lived in Los Angeles for 20 years and I have never run into a bartender with such passion and knowledge of \\"The cocktail.\\" Mr. Gatehouse, in essence, took us on a magical tour of Bali hi, which is populated by Blue-eyed boys and a wonderful concoction called Shochu.  \\n\\nMr. Gatehouse takes his craft seriously.  I mean, where else can you get a hand-blended, and hand-bottled cocktail?  Yes, Brent mixes and then bottles his own personal elixirs from \\"The Bottle Shop.\\". There is the bali hi, described as domaine milou with benedictine, st. germain, and hopped grapefruit bitters; then there's the micha caliente, a provoking blend of lemon-lime soda, jalapeno vodka, orange liqueur, cranberry, and verdejo; finally, there is the blue-eyed boy, which is an appropriate marriage of bombay sapphire gin, mint, elderflower and peach bitters.  I mean seriously!!!!!  Who is doing this kind of thing?  The first one we tried was so deliciously-subtle and refreshingly-light that we decided to split one of each from the bottle shop.  \\n\\nThe more questions we asked about his liquid creations, the more Mr. Gatehouse morphed from a bartender to a cross between a college professor and mad scientist, which became more pronounced when I asked him about some of the mysterious-looking bottles with Japanese writing on them.  They were clearly not Sake.  This is where Scooby Doo, cocks his ears and looks sideways with that wonderful way Scooby talks... Rhatt????  \\n\\nThe bottles contained Shochu, which is described on the Lure drink menu as \\"somewhere between a martini and a glass of white wine.\\" Okay, that hooked us (insert wink at pun here ; )  ....Mr. Gatehouse treated us to an amazing tasting / tutorial of the marvelous qualities of Shochu.  In an attempt to keep this review brief, I will sum it up in two words.  Try it!  Shochu is everything the menu promises.  It is unique in its elegance and flavor.  The crowning splendor of this cocktail is the ice, which Mr. Gatehouse also makes.  No pre-formed cubes out of an ice maker will do for Mr. Gatehouse, NO!!  He makes his ice to insure clarity and then he chips each piece by hand, which (I have to admit) looks like a piece of ice sculpture, jagged and very elegant, floating in the drink.  This kind of attention to the cocktail elevates the whole experience to a spiritual plain and it left an indelible mark on me and my sweetheart.  \\n\\nTonight we are going to experience Lure again, and this time we will eat dinner, so stay tuned for that review."},{"name":"Del Frisco's Double Eagle Steak House","address":"9150 International Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Decent, but the one in Vegas is far better.

The side of tomato soup is a nice touch for a lot of grilled cheese lovers and went over well at our table. I personally ordered the Southern Comfort burger.

Overall, the food was very solid and that alone will have me coming back.\\n\\nOnto the service. Like I stated before, Toasted is fast-casual ala Tijuana Flats, so you order at the counter and the food is brought out to you. The food came out promptly and management was also very friendly, stopping by to make sure everything came out well and that everyone was enjoying their meal. They also offer curbside pickup to serve all your pajama wearing, grilled cheese craving,  \\"I don't want to leave the car\\" needs.\\n\\nOverall I think Toasted has solid food and seems to be a well-run establishment.

It must be a subconscious thing, because I was close to ordering Thai food about an hour ago.\\nStill, I ended up ordering China Palace to be delivered to my hotel room. \\n\\nFirst, I like the seamless online ordering. It was quick and easy. The delivery guy showed up at my door within 30-40 minutes. Excellent.\\n\\nThe Soup\\nAs always, I order Hot & Sour soup. While this one has a nice consistency, and plenty of tofu, mushrooms, eggs and bamboo shoots, it's missing two things: hot and sour. It's not terrible. It's just bland. Think of it as a really rich Chinese-style chicken soup -- with a few pieces of tender pork. If that's your thing, this is the soup for you. It's not the soup for me, however. Not hot & sour, anyway.\\n\\nSzechuan Eggplant\\nIt's a treat when a Chinese joint serves eggplant, because frankly -- it's rare. The eggplant at China Palace is just downright good. They do peel it before cooking ... and I'd rather be seeing purple skin. But that's not a deal-breaker. There is a slightly sweet flavor that gives way to a little bit of heat. The eggplant is very tender, and there is enough for three people. Seriously. It's unfortunate that some of this is going to be left in the hotel room fridge.\\n\\nGeneral Tso's Chicken\\nLet's face it. General Tso's is to my 40-something generation what Chow Mein was to our parents. It's the thing you order when you don't know what to order. It's the epitome of Americanized Chinese. That said, China Palace's version is damn good. I don't even know why I ordered it, but I'm glad I did. The batter is light. The sauce is slightly sweet and garlicky. There are crisp tender chunks of broccoli, along with a few mushrooms and some water chestnuts. Again, there is enough here for three people. \\n\\nI was honestly thinking this place would get three stars, based mostly on its service. The bland soup must've been an anomaly, unless the locals happen to like it without pungency or spice. If I lived here, I would be a regular customer of China Palace.

Being that we are foodies this is an exciting moment for us Floridians (considering most Florida restaurants do not recieve accolades).  Unfortunately this experience was a complete miss.  We arrived an hour early for our reservation and decided to have a drink at the bar, the bar was packed so we decided to go to a bar down the hall(in hind sight of would have been nice if the host would have taken a phone number and called us when our table was ready but either way no problems)!  \\n\\nWe were seated towards the back in a large booth.  The decor of the restaurant is dated, the lights were very bright and we were sitting under a loud speaker that was playing pop music.  My husband and I were hoping to have a romantic dinner but the atmosphere was just not helping.  The restaurant was FULL of kids (we have 3 of our own so that is ok and considering it is in a hotel and its summer that is understandable).  We mentioned the music to our waitress several times and she sort of laughed it off(we would have loved for her to rectify it, but I guess not).  \\n\\nWe were excited to try many of the things we had seen in the yelp reviews but unfortunately many were not available.  The restaurant has a farm to table philosophy and grows much of there produce on site or it is purchased locally.  I love this concept.  \\n\\nWe decided to order a lamb salad to start, it was delish.  For our entrees I ordered pasta with a fresh mushroom ragu.  My husband ordered lamb ravioli.  Both were completely dry (maybe a teaspoon of sauce on the bottom of the plate and my pasta had soooooo much grit from the mushrooms it was uneatable). The waitress asked if we liked it and we said they were ok but she should have pressed considering neither of us ate our dinners.  For desert we order the chocolate cake which was like many molten lava cakes I have had in the past.  \\n\\nAlso we brought our own wine and it was slightly warm when we arrived.  They supposedly chilled it for an hour while we were waiting to be seated.  When we arrived at our table it was sitting in a bucket of Luke warm water.

It was very light, and very nice.  Would be interested in trying the Nutella pancake at some point...\\n\\nI think it's interesting to have a place such as Full English in the location it's in.

If it wasn't the day after Thanksgiving and I was hungrier, I may have ordered the Full English Breakfast...\\n\\nThe tea selection was a little peculiar.  PG Tips was offered - but I have actually heard PG Tips is considered the \\"crappy\\" English tea!  I had the chai latte - not exactly an English specialty, I know.  It was good, a bit milky and not quite spicy or sweet enough for me.  Lipton tea was on the menu, as were others that didn't seem especially English to me.  My mom stated that the water for her tea was barely hot enough. \\n\\nThe biggest drawback of my experience here was that it was hot.  REALLY HOT.  On a typical August day in Austin, I can imagine (and really hope) the air conditioning in Full English is in full swing.  But today in late November, when the air was just a tad crisp and the temperature under 70, I found myself sweating like a whore in church on Easter Sunday as I sat in the restaurant and ate and drank my one cup of tea.

We are from Texas and are relatively picky about our barbecue. Overall, I thought this place produced barbecue that ranged from mediocre to superb. \\n\\nThe food we tried:\\n\\nPork ribs: These were the best, in my opinion. Perfect texture, with just enough chewiness, enough smoke, and not overly sweet. Might be the best ribs I've had in an \\"upscale barbecue\\" place. \\n\\nSliced brisket: Excellent brisket! Not overcooked, great flavor, and not over-seasoned. I would definitely order this again. \\n\\nPulled pork: Perfectly good pulled pork, but nothing spectacular.\\n\\nSausage links: This was the only disappointing spot for me. My husband and I both tried the sausage and thought it was spongy and a bit dry. Sausage is one of my favorite things to try in BBQ places so that was a let down. \\n\\n\\"Ranch Beans\\": They need to rethink their beans. These were way too sweet with an odd herbal note that just didn't work for me. Beans should be simple, and these had too much happening. \\n\\n\\"Texas Caesar Salad\\": This was sort of like a wedge salad with spicy dressing and cheese on it. It was decent, not overly heavy. I'm glad I ordered it as a side over the potato salad. \\n\\nPotato salad: Mediocre potato salad. It was just sort of bland--not really worth ordering, IMO, but not outright terrible. \\n\\n\\"Salt and pepper potatoes\\": These were absolutely delicious. Crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside, perfectly seasoned. Definitely give these a try and just skip the potato salad. \\n\\nThe sauces: They had three available on the table, all were excellent. One tasted like a mustard-based sauce, one was a sweet fruity mild hot sauce, and one was a much spicier hot sauce with a smoky taste. \\n\\nThe ambiance and service: The place has an industrial feel to it that is pretty common these days. The restaurant was crowded and fairly loud but the noise level wasn't that bad. The service was prompt and the staff was courteous. We had our 2-year-old son with us and they were great about expediting some food for him and getting him crayons. If you have kids, this place is an option for you. They even stored our stroller for us. \\n\\nThe price was pretty much what I would expect for good barbecue in Boston: my tray was 24 and my husband's was 26, plus 8 dollars for the potatoes (which we all three shared).

Since it was restaurant week, I did do their 4 course meal. It was more like 3 since the 4th course was just a choice of naan. For a starter, I had the hot and sour chicken soup, next up, the ginger chicken, and for the main course I did chicken tikka masala with butter naan (medium spice). Overall, everything had great flavor, but it was fairly spicy. The soup and ginger chicken appetizer was more spicy then I had anticipated but it wasn't off-putting. The chicken tikka masala was perfect spicy level at medium but it was oddly sweeter then I'm used to, but I liked it a lot. Would definitely order everything but the soup again. \\n\\nI've been told they do a lunch buffet during the week which is phenomenal given it's location downtown. \\n\\nIn conclusion, I gave it the full 5 stars because it really did blow me away with the flavors and service and decor.

I used to swear by Sazon as a great little hidden secret in my back yard. I can't say the same anymore. \\n\\nLast night was the straw that broke the camel's back. Our party of 5 arrived around 8 to a half-filled inside & patio. We were seated out on the patio. Within a few minutes, a small band erupted. One hint: Don't stick guys with bongos and guitars directly next to your patrons. Especially when you have a covered patio. Reverb fail. Also, tell the bongo player to stuff a towel in the open end to keep the sound at a reasonable volume. He drowned out not only his band mates, but also the group of customers. Many left when they started. \\n\\nThe server was mediocre to say the least. Twice forgetting drink orders, failing to bring more than one 3oz side cup of salsa for a table of 5 when we asked for bigger servings three times. When she first came to take our food order, she noticed she had no pen, said she'd grab one and be right back... 10 minutes later. I ordered the enchiladas de pipian and my beans were cold. Not at that perfectly torched, fresh from under the salamander hot. Not warm. Cold. \\n\\nThen we get to the check. 5 people, 4 cards, $90 tab. We each write our names to match our cards and the amount to be paid on the back of the check. Pretty usual thing at a restaurant, right? About 15 minutes after presenting our cards to our server, she returns. One card was run for his correct amount, yet also for an extra $30. Mine wasn't run at all, and was written on the check to be charged $9. Yup. I had a $9 tab. Just food. No drinks (shocking for anyone that knows me). We tell the server the error, hand over our two cards, and ask that she run mine with the $9 as written and also correct his extra $30. Time goes by and she finally returns. Hands me a receipt for the $9 charge and tells my friend his extra charge was refunded... yet presents him no receipt as proof. We blow it off, thinking all will be fine. \\n\\nThis morning arrives. I check my account. The server seems to have not only run all of our cards last night as instructed, but also ran mine for the whole tab in addition. WHAT?! Seeing that it's an authorization, I know my bank can't do anything until it posts. I call the restaurant to see if it has been batched and processed, and figure a manager on duty can help. Too bad one isn't there. NOT A SINGLE MANAGER. How do you operate with no manager in the house? What if someone needs a refund or a comp? What if the health department comes by? Imagine what they would say. The server from last night happens to be on the phone with me, so I ask her to help. Not only does she inform me that she can't, she insists it's my fault since my group made it so difficult to run our check. Umm... Re-read the above part about how easy we made it. \\n\\nShe tells me that a manager will be in at 2, and that I should call back then. Sure. No problem. I call back at 2, and she answers again. Still no manager present and she says he won't be in until 5 now. I'm livid at this point. I leave my name and number, ask her to call the boss and to have them call me. At that point, I tweet them, leave a message on their Facebook wall, and even email the joint. Over an hour later, no response. This is why I've written such a long review. \\n\\nIn short, I'll never be a patron at Sazon again."},{"name":"True North Coffee","address":"204 Cambridge St","city":"Burlington","stars":"4.5","text":"Awesome Place!

Beef is my flesh of choice in most cases, but it was a little overdone at Junior's. It wasn't shoe-leather by any means, but it was a bit tough and chewy for something I'm supposed to eat on the go. It was well-flavored, though, and the tacos on the whole were a revelation. It was the most authentic taco I've ever had, really, considering I'm a Taco Bell fetishist. Well, was, I guess- I still love Taco Smell, but it's hard to call those things \\"tacos\\" anymore.\\n\\nIf anything Junior's did something for me far behind their good tacos- they opened my eyes to the wider taco truck phenomenon, which I intend to further explore.

It was late afternoon, and we had missed the lunch rush but were well ahead of the dinner crowd; we had the place entirely to ourselves. Our waiter sat us at a table in the back and handed us two hot, wet towels. Greg and I looked at him, thanked him, and set the towels on our saucers. When the waiter left, Greg nudged me: 'What are we supposed to do with these? Clean our own table?'... 'I don't know; it looks clean to me.' There was no one else around to set an example. We left the towels on our saucers and sheepishly looked at our menus until our waiter returned and removed them. Later, while watching a movie, I learned we were supposed to clean our hands with the towels. I share this embarrassing story with you in confidence.\\n\\nWith the towel incident behind us, Greg and I ordered - again embarrassing. I got three octopus rolls and the orange chicken. Greg got his usually General Tso's. Our waiter emerged with two large, steaming plates filled with chicken and rice and three smaller plates lined with sushi rolls. I had intended to eat three rolls...total. \\n\\nThe orange chicken was the best I've ever had. It was perfectly crisp, the sauce was scrumptious, and I had no nasty chewy chicken pieces like you find in low-end joints. The sushi was fresh, and Haiku had soy rolls for people like me who don't enjoy the tangy zip of seaweed (plus ten points). I somehow managed to finish my chicken and one plate of the octopus and humbly had the other two plates boxed.\\n\\nThough I was red-faced pretty much the whole meal, I had an astoundingly good time and have had a good time each time I have gone back. Haiku is gorgeous and creates a perfect mood. I love the artwork and all the handwritten customer haikus pinned to the support beams and walls. The dark, mysterious feeling of the restaurant reminds me of the ancient orient. The real Japanese sushi chefs - not Mexican like those you will find in Lima, OH - are both funny and polite. And the patio is stunningly beautiful; it's like being in a Japanese garden on High St. There are koi ponds under the bridges and tiny lanterns hanging from the masculine terrace.\\n\\nA lot of people I know are afraid to go to Haiku because they don't like sushi. To this, I say 'pish-posh!' Haiku has wonderful, wonderful food that anyone who has ever had Chinese take-out can relate to.

Another person came back and pointed at a little piece of paper tucked in between the condiments that was meant to educate the customers about their policy. It wasn't prominently displayed and I actually mistook it for a copy of the specials because it was the same size. In the end it was a small amount of money and I just paid. If the manager of Gigi's reads this review, I would like to suggest that she take time to ask for our feedback and maybe find out why we want to leave a smaller tip. Also, please make it more noticeable instead of loose paper on the table. We left feeling frustrated and we don't want to go back.

However, in America, you needn't give a crap.\\n\\nSo what if you use a fork? No one is going to derisively gaze at you while you fit an impaled dilapidated cluster of rice and fish into your mouth, unless it is some sort of traditionalist douche (the type that is, but most commonly assumes the position of by mere heritage, from a certain place, and tells you how to pronounce things foreign to your language.

Yes, but I don't like those people^, even though I am Mexican (born and raised) and I could well tell you how to properly pronounce \\"salsa\\".\\n\\nBack to Sinju. My point in the first couple of sentences was that you cannot expect Sinju to be a Japanese location with traditional Japanese food: you will find that the rolls, for instance, have quite a bit of creativity in them. They taste good. I often order from the nigiri menu, as it has the most ample array of selections, and they are good. I actually love the tamago (sweet egg).\\n\\nI also have to compliment the ambiance. It is modern, yet cozy and comfortable. Another minor problem is that the service can be slow. And yet another problem, though more hilarious than anything, is that people often mistake the entrance (a square wooden door) for the exit to the exterior dining area. I was eating outside, and saw at least five people open the little black metal gate and walk into the restaurant from the wrong side. Very disconcerting to the patrons, the prospects and the staff.

Thnks fr th Mmrs. Seriously though, you and your staff have become such a big part of my times in college that introducing Freddie (the owner) and the waiters to a new boy was a BIG FRIGGIN DEAL. I only wish that last point was exaggerated. \\n\\nWhen I first arrived on campus, a petrified college freshman, I had the fortuitous coincidence of being placed in the dorm closest to your doors. The red-yellow glow of your sign beckoned from my common-room window. Dad frequented you while I was out at orientation, and, as your wait staff spoke Cantonese, he became fast friends with everyone there. This was the last place we ate at together before he took off, leaving me all alone, but not without introducing me to everyone there and asking the waitresses to \\"look out for my girl.\\"\\n\\nAnd look out for me your staff did, for better or worse. That first month, my homesick self would order from you when, tired from Annenberg grub and missing mom's food, I would seek solace in those chicken fingers I will never order again, while the waitress would ask me how I was adjusting to life here. When my friends and I started frequenting this place, tagging along with the wiser upperclassmen, it became our default hangout spot after 2am on the weekends. Mistakes, brilliant life decisions, awkward sort-of dates, friendships and more have been forged under the dim mustard lighting of your suspended table lamps. During the harsh blizzards of '10-11, my roommates and I had Kong delivery so frequently that they memorized our credit cards, address, and \\"usual orders\\". It was kind of like my very own Cheers, a place where you could bet that half the room would know your name (if they weren't so intoxicated). Every time I brought any friends who happened to be a boy here, the waiters would grill me in Cantonese - \\"Who is he? What are you doing out so late? Is he your boyfriend?\\" All except Freddie, who wasn't afraid to ask any guy point blank what he was doing associating with me. I guess one could conclude that they accomplished everything my father entrusted them to do. \\n\\nI was incredulous when the City of Cambridge attempted to limit your working hours, validated when I was old enough to sneak a peek at the club upstairs (really a hangout for grad-school students and other people from the area), and near tears in nostalgia when I spent my last night on campus after graduation here, nursing one final order of scallion pancakes. \\n\\nWhen I was 17 going on 18 and a overexcited freshman, I made the promise that I'd celebrate my 21st here. True to that claim, I rang in my 21st on a Tuesday night with a dozen friends, 3 scorpion bowls for the table and 1 free flaming double shot from Freddie that a waiter then tried to push down my throat because I was too chicken to down it in one.\\n\\nI realize this post has turned into more of an ode and lament rather than a review, so here's the best of their menu, in 10 lines- \\n\\nFood: Honestly, all their noodle and rice dishes use the same innocuous MSG-based brown sauce, so pick the one with the best topping (beef or chicken, they have a below-average picking of veggies). Do try to order the fat rice noodles (ho fun). In terms of late night drunk cravings, get what my roommates and I call the KONG HOLY TRINITY: Scallion Pancakes (the best I've ever had, make sure you dip it in the vinegar sauce they provide), Crab Rangoons (the only place that actually does this terrible dish some justice), and fried Peking Raviolis (like pot stickers on steroids). \\n\\nDrinks: Scorpion Bowl, how many a person have you corrupted with your deceiving tropical goodness? DO NOT get them with the plastic animals, however. Sanitation issue, trust me. \\n\\nTo the Kong and their staff, thanks for being there their for me during my formative college years.

But the knish was the find of the morning - fried, dense potatoe-y goodness... even my grandmother would approve of that."},{"name":"Beth's Burger Bar","address":"5145 S Orange Ave","city":"Edgewood","stars":"4","text":"This place was really good.

It comes with one medium sized chicken breast, a handful of shrimp, onions, peppers, and mashed potatoes.  The chicken is tender and flavorful, however the shrimp is chewy. The mashed potatoes come without gravy, but goes well when dipped in melted cheese (what doesn't go well with melted cheese?!).\\n\\n(5/10) Southwest Mac & Cheese\\nWhen we saw the picture in the menu, we knew we had to get this one, especially since we love macaroni and cheese. The delicious description made our mouth water - juicy fire grilled chicken with creamy white cheddar jalapeno sauce.  However, this this dish did not come as described and was a huge let down.  First of all, T.G.I. Friday's uses penne pasta instead of macaroni. Secondly, they left the chicken in the fire-grill way too long.  The entire piece of chicken was dry and half of it burnt to a crisp. There is no hint of jalapenos and the cheese is not \\"cheesy\\" at all.\\n\\n(4/10) Fiery Chicken Popper Sandwich\\nThis sandwich is neither fiery nor popping, and did not live up to its name. Its described as a crispy chicken breast, smothered with cream cheese & jalapeno habanero jelly and topped with jalapenos.  Naturally, one would expect a spicy sandwich but there is no jalapeno kick to it.  They skimped on the chicken and the ciabatta bread was dry and hard. Stay away from this one!\\n\\n(8/10) Brownie Obsession\\nT.G.I Friday's finally got something right! If you are a chocolate lover, then your mouth is in for a treat.  The brownie is served warm and drenched with Ghirardelli chocolate-fudge sauce and topped with a delicious scoop of creamy ice cream.  We'll use three words to describe this dish: rich, chocolaty, fudgelicious.  It doesn't get any better than this!\\n\\n(6/10) Chocolate Peanut Butter Pie\\nIf you are a fan of peanut butter desserts, then this is for you. The pie has a graham cracker crust, a thin layer of chocolate, peanut butter mousse, and topped with whipped cream. It is rich and fluffy, but if you want more substance, get the brownie.\\n\\nService (5/10)\\nIt was a slow night when we went so we were seated immediately. The service is mediocre. The waiter checked up on us once or twice, but never refilled our water. Also, since he rang up the bill incorrectly, we were overcharged.\\n\\nAmbiance (6/10)\\nT.G.I. Friday's amibiance is similar to that of Chili's - very casual.  The restaurant is large and has plenty of seating in the dining and bar areas.  Parking is sufficient because it is located in a shopping area. If you are looking for a restaurant with a huge variety of food that is good for families or friends, we recommend Chili's or Bennigans."},{"name":"Frank's Steak House","address":"2310 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"Well....my fiances father was a big fan of this so called steak indigestion house or spend all night in the bathroom house would be more to the point. We were seated and our waitress , who must be suffering from shin splints , arrived and greeted us with a dead look on her face. All i could think of was a Howard Johnson's waitress with a bad attitude. \\n  We placed a drink order and were promptly ducking menus just thrown  on the table.  After an unusually long time for two sodas and 2 beers....must have been brewing them to order to take that long. Then  the waitress of the year asked if we were ready for appetizers in a tone that could only denote \\"i wish you would just leave me money and disappear.\\" We got chicken fingers that you could get frozen at stop and shop , and loaded potato skins that were soggy and luke warm.\\n   Next , my fiance got an allegedly \\"sizzling sirloin\\"...with no sizzle and less taste.  I got the 16 ounce sirloin well done. It was no more than one inch thick and looked like a doormat...also it wasn't well...it was medium.  I have cooked over 20 years and in every kind of restaurant i have NEVER seen a steak that thin not cooked well done on the first try...except here. The only reasonably edible piece of food was my father-in-law's prime rib. Then after sending up a flare to get our \\"servers\\" attention i asked to have my steak cooked to the right temp. She gave me the look of death and wandered off. When it returned it looked like they had cooked it with a blowtorch. Completely black and inedible.  Obviously these orders were put in with the appetizers and sat under the heat lamps until  swifty managed to gps her way back to the table.  I started drinking soda because they were closing in three hours and didn't have time to wait for another beer. \\n   Then the infamous ice cream puff appeared ...it actually didn't look bad. The table was never cleared ... the food was just dropped on the table and if we needed anything we practically had to hog tie the waitress to ask her for what we wanted.\\n   I have no idea why everyone i talked to likes this shithole...but i will never again believe a word of what the phantom says....they must have spent a fortune bribing them.\\nIf you want a good steak go to Dom's meat market in Madlen , buy a good steak and grill it yourself would  HAVE be better than this.."},{"name":"SnowBean","address":"5310 E Colonial Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Lots and lots of potential here!\\n\\nPros:  \\nDecorations/ambiance is awesome\\nComfy lighting\\nClean lines\\nLots of different Asian/Korean pastries\\nSnow desserts\\nKPop playing in the background\\nBeautiful patio seating\\nView of the lake \\nCool artwork\\n\\nCons:\\nSeems empty\\nKinda weird that it's right next to the KBBQ spot\\nPoor signage from the street\\nThey serve the snow ice in a tall glass making it hard to eat.

They did the usual Austin Restaurant schtick with doubling the prices and serving you prix fixe with little choices and small portions.   1st course were 2 oysters with salmon roe.  One per person  Nothing special.  By that time you're hungry and waiting 20 minutes for the next course.   Got about a teaspoonful of over-salted beef tartare on rice cracker....one bite gone.   Next was a bowl of kale with vinaigrette with sorghum popcorn.  Finished in 1 minute.   Wait 15 minutes for next course.   My water glass was probably filled 3 times by the time of the next course arrived.   Next was their plate of SCRAMBLED EGGS?   Yes, believe it or not mushy scrambled eggs with butter.    Yeah so they upscaled it a little with caviar and creme fraiche and toast on the side.  But it's SCRAMBLED EGGS.  CHEF WHAT THE $#@8  IS GOING IN YOUR mind?   They probably only used one egg too because we finished it in minutes.  My 7 year old daughter could have cooked the same scrambled eggs.   Next was their spaghetti bowl that was quarter filled with spaghetti and cheese sauce.   4 bites each.. we're done and my stomach was rumbling.  At this point I'm thinking forget about making pasta from scratch and just boil up a box of Ronzoni.   Next dish was four 1 inch cubes of poached fish with shredded potatoes which is their better dish..nice touch with the kaffir lime...yet again so small.  After one and a half hours of getting served these bite sized courses, what finally got us somewhat satiated were 6 mini overglazed boar ribs split amongst the two of us.   Last plate was 1 plainly cooked short rib with 1 roti split amongst the 2 of us .    I'm not sure what kind of cuisine they were shooting for Mexican/Indian?  The starfruit sorbet dessert was good but the chocolate cheesecake with beet glaze was kind of weird.     \\n\\nAll in all about $200 per couple with tax and tip.   They restaurant probably spent $20 dollars for ingredients.   So I got gouged.  Again don't come in hungry because you will continue to be hungry for an hour and a half.     At least they didn't use foam.

It's a great location, with a fabulous, oak shaded deck and a warmly decorated, cozy little cottage-like restaurant serving Italian comfort food. They offer free valet parking so you don't have to deal with the frustration of trying to find a space along the parking desert that is west sixth. \\n\\nThere is a decent wine list, refreshing, inventive cocktails, and yet, both times I've visited, I've left with the feeling that the food, while adequate and good, never has me dying to come back. In fact, it's been probably two years since my last visit. \\n\\nI certainly like it more than the chain restaurants like OG or JC. I guess it is a case of expectations being too high.  Anyway, here is a breakdown of my visit. \\n\\nThe last time we visited, the inside was packed!  No reservation meant no table, so we sat outside on a hot day. Thank you, oak tree, for making that bearable. This time, showing up at 6:15 without a res was no problem at all. Only two tables were full. We were greeted and seated on arrival. \\n\\nOur waiter was friendly, but sort of like Steve Martin's \\"wild and crazy guy\\" sort of way. My dining buddy and I each selected a version of meatballs with sauce and carb. I had the lamb and pork version with marinara over creamy polenta, she had the chicken meatballs with marinara over spaghetti. We both enjoyed our hearty portions well enough, although I felt the meatballs were a bit tough. The best meatballs I've had were at Rao's and they are like buttah!  Also, I'm not sure if it was an oversight or just something they don't do, but it would be nice to have some bread and butter to start the meal or as an accompaniment. I did ask for bread and received it promptly. We also were not offered any dessert or coffee. Too bad, because we could have easily been coerced. \\n\\nI suppose, in summary, Winflo is fine. Other than a slight lapse in service, it really is adequate. Not exactly the accolades a restaurant hopes to receive, but in my humble opinion, it's what they are. I started out this review issuing three stars, but felt three and a half was more fair, so it is rounded to four."},{"name":"The Narrows Nightclub & Pub","address":"1970 Spicer Road","city":"North Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"Cheap chicken wings in North Van by a dump?

Our curly- haired waitress was absolutely perfect- the right blend of personality, attentiveness and what I believe was once called moxie. We liked her a lot.\\n\\nI had KILLER porridge with strawberries and cream, just a taste to start, but it was really good. Then I had the full Scottish breakfast with runny eggs over baked beans (not the British kind in the blue can that taste like candy, some sort of special crazy highlander warrior beans that blew my mind). I wasn't completely in love with the blood sausage- could have been a bit crispier- but the bacon was 100% porkalicous. Wife had breakfast sandwich and looked very happy, our son had the same. Good strong coffee.\\n\\nOf particular note: the owner Jason is very personable and took a moment to speak to us.I very much appreciated the Scottish playlist: a bit of Camera Obscura, English Beat, Teenage Fanclub- there was an old flyer for Orange Juice (the band) in the men's room- gotta appreciate that.\\n\\nI look forward to returning for dinner.

Our waitress told us 5-10 more minutes.\\n\\nThe three-person table beside us that arrived at the same time had already received their appetizers and main courses and were on dessert.\\n\\nBy this point - an hour and a half after first arriving to the restaurant - we still had no main meal, no water refill and were late for our movie showing. \\n\\nI finally asked to see a manager. Quickly and slightly panicky, the hostess (finally) filled our waters and brought us a bread plate. When the manager did come, we asked for our meals to go. The manager ended up paying for our appetizer and gave us a $25 gift card (at no request by us). We still paid for our meals - two scallop pasta dishes - and the waitress brought the boxes without a bag. \\n\\nWe were furious as we left the restaurant. We opened the boxes in the car, half too upset to eat at the restaurant and half too upset to even eat at all, to find a generic alfredo dish with three meek scallops placed on top. It was lacking many of the ingredients advertised on the menu, including a \\"farm raised egg,\\" tasted very gritty, and the middle of the scallops were undercooked. (We took it home and ate it, defeated and trying to kill time until a much later movie time. We ended up disliking it so much we ate at the Alamo Drafthouse instead. Now THAT is delicious pizza.)\\n \\nIt took them AN HOUR AND A HALF to make a worse alfredo dish than chain Italian restaurants like Olive Garden. And it wasn't even advertised as alfredo. It looked very thrown together at the last minute, too - I am posting a picture. \\n\\nI am throwing the gift card away, because I am never going back and will never recommend this restaurant to anyone.

It's killer.  I can't say enough good things about how tasty - and full of fresh fruit - it is.  And the pitchers of sangria are a great deal - $18/pitcher, and you can get about 7 glasses out of them.  Another pro is the service.  The bartender, Dave, was friendly, funny and prompt.  And our waiter was equally personable and professional.  Also, the atmosphere is cozy and decently authentic.  \\n\\nThe cons:  The wait for a table, even with a reservation, can be long.  More importantly, the food was a bit of a let-down.  I ordered off of the $15, 3-course 'Stimulus Menu', and wasn't really thrilled with anything that I ordered.  The roasted duck salad was under-seasoned and the lettuce was limp.  The suckling pig was delicious, but the 'mushroom sauce' consisted of about five tiny slices of mushrooms and the mashed potatoes it was served on top of were beyond bland.  The chocolate truffles for dessert were decent, but nothing exceptional.  And, over all, the presentation was pretty sloppy, too.\\n\\nI'll definitely come back for the sangria and the ambiance, and I'd like to give the food at Tasca a second chance by trying some of the more traditional tapas offerings.

We came here on a Friday night, waited for about 20mins and its a small place where you will seat close to others. We had the following:\\n\\nSushi & Sashimi Combo $19.95: 6 pieces of humongous sashimi (3 each of salmon & tuna), 6 nigiri (salmon, tuna & shrimp) and King's roll (shrimp & salmon with onion & garlic). More than enough to share and more than enough to leave them alone...\\n\\nYakitori $4.25: Soft inside & flavorfully charred outside. The only redeeming dish they did right.\\n\\nSunomono Salad w/shrimp $3.50: The girl sitting next to us (who is a regular), vouched that this is the best in town. I have never try this but was curious. Its clear noodle in cold clear sweet & sour broth (mainly vinegar), and there's nothing salad/veges about this...

Cheap and definitely a good place for sushi-fix if you dont care about the authenticity of a well-cut and prepared piece of sashimi goodness.

So why you ask did I come here?\\n\\nFirst with all the holiday parties and dinners that have occurred this week I needed a healthier option in which I was in control of what was on my plate. Knowing exactly what ingredients and their points value (Weight Watchers) was a blessing. I didn't care if it was fresh or frozen as long as I could ID the ingredients. I am also not that picky considering that I have been to a lot of questionable restaurants with unfamiliar ingredients I cannot pronounce in the past year.

It's inside a shopping plaza, relatively small place but wasn't crowded. The girl at the counter was very friendly and helped us figure out our order. It basically is a chipotle style restaurant- pick a base, fish and then toppings/sauces. I'm a huge sucker for poke bowls and sashimi bowls in general. Brown rice and tuna breathe life into me, and of course these were two of the options. They have a few fish options- tuna, salmon, shrimp, octopus, etc. This is where the 4 vs. 5 stars comes in- I'm not 100% sure on the freshness when it's been sitting in the metal tin. I didn't ask how often it's changed out or refrigerated, but eating any seafood product that has been out for a while makes me a little nervous. The toppings include edamame along with your other basic veggies, and then fancier toppings like seaweed salad and mango. They have a few soy sauce options (including their OG sauce) and some creamy sauces (things like spicy mayo). At the end you can have a sprinkle of sesame seeds, fried onions and a couple of other things that I definitely did not pay attention to. Overall, the taste was good and it wasn't too pricey considering you have a variety of options. They do charge extra for some of the toppings, like avocados or extra of the normal toppings.

This will not be it."},{"name":"Sweet Cheeks Q","address":"1381 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"First time here and it was really good! We went at around 4pm on a Saturday and it wasn't too filled. Got seated right away and the waitress was really accommodating and really helped us figure out what we wanted. My friends and I got the trays and me specifically got the brisket and the pork belly, the pork belly was good at some parts but really tough in some. The brisket was really tender and flavorful. They have 3 sauces which u can pick from at the table and they were all unique but good on their own. Mac and cheese and the seasonal roasted salad are a must. Mac and cheese could use some more flavor but the salad was spot on. Also got a growler for 3 which is really decently priced and good for around 7 mason jar drinks. Would go again!  Very reasonably priced around 30 bucks for the drinks and the tray. Way better quality and more filling than an all you can eat place."},{"name":"Atmosphere Bistro","address":"1620 Piedmont Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"We went for the Prix Fixe Menu, had the eggplant and tomato and Croque Madame, topped with a fried egg sunny side up . Was wonderful, just like the ones I had when I lived in France.

That's a good thing since they have so many people waiting to eat there. When we arrived there was almost an hour wait.\\n\\nThe aromas were heavenly and made me and my wife drool and our bellies growl. Once seated we ordered some pan fried dumplings and shanghai spring rolls to start and the sichuan beef in noodle soup as my main course and my wife had the ginger beef as hers.\\n\\nAll the food was great and we felt completely satisfied by the end of it. We were seated close to the front waiting area and my wife and I noticed an older asian couple that was watching me thoroughly enjoying my beef noodle soup. I noticed when we were leaving the gentleman was enjoying the same dish at his table.\\n\\nIf we are in the area again I will definitely make a stop here for a meal."},{"name":"Atmosphere Bistro","address":"1620 Piedmont Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Amazing food.
